"3820","4","This is a good peach cobbler - just the right spices and sweetness. You should note however the amount of baking powder - this is a very 'cake-like' cobbler. Also, the amount of cinammon-sugar on the top makes it very hard to tell when it is 'golden brown'. 'very thin' slices of peach also lead to a less chunky peachy cobbler than I really like, so you may want to make your slices reasonably substantial if you want good sized chunks of peach."
"3219","5","This is the best cobbler I have tasted! Family went nuts over it. Easy, too! I will make this again, for sure. I would include details on peeling the peaches for newbies. Place the peaches in boiling water for about 60 seconds, remove and plunge into cold water. The skins should slip right off."
"2339","4","This recipe is delicious. I have two suggestions to improve it though. First, I used fresh peaches from my boss's peach tree - some of them were quite under-ripe - and the recipe still came out very sweet. I will definitely make this again, but I will use a bit less sugar in the fruit and in the topping. Second, while the topping is super tasty (if a bit sweet), there's not enough of it! It doesn't need to be doubled but maybe 50% more topping would be great."
"1015","4","This is a very good recipe, but having been born and reared in the south, I remember all my mother's (and grandmother's) cobblers having a crust on top (not just spoonfuls dropped over it, but a full top crust.) Researching this in my mother's old recipe files, I found something interesting. This recipe is almost identical to hers, but steps 3 and 4 would be changed as follows: Combine 1 and one-half cups each of flour, sugar and milk. Pour this over the peach mixture. Sprinkle with sugar, with or without the cinnamon, and then dot with butter. Bake approx. 30 minutes.  I tried this recipe both ways, and my mother's way is an improvement. It is also easier, by the way."
"918","5","Coming from the Peach State, I'm really picky about peach cobbler. This recipe is fantastic! I made it with fresh peaches that were about to spoil in a day or two, so I ended up using all I had. This meant that I almost doubled the suggested amount of fruit, and even though I did not double the other ingredients, the recipe came out very well and I had none left over. So be generous with the fruit if you can!! Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream. Also, consider using other fresh fruits if peaches are not yet in season. I've made this with mangoes, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries, and each time the results have been fantastic."
"470","5","This is absolutely one of my favorite recipes that I've tried so far. The ingredient proportions are right on the mark, and the procedure is so easy. I tried boiling the peaches to peel them, as suggested, but that didn't quite work out. Instead, I just peeled them with a knife, which worked out just fine and wasn't a hassle at all. When choosing peaches, be sure that they do not have any green on the skin -- this means the fruit hadn't developed before being picked, and it won't get any sweeter afterwards. The crust is unbelievable. When you pour in the boiling hot water, it immediately puffs up into a thick dough. This bakes into a thick, crumb-cake-like topping. The sugar amounts can be adjusted as desired. I found it to be just right. It is incredible with a scoop of vanilla or butter pecan ice cream (or both). My 'southern' gentleman companion, who has had his share of peach cobblers, really enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"427","5","Made this fabulous dessert with my diabetic husband in mind for a church gathering. I used regular Splenda & Splenda Brown Sugar in place of the sugars, and served with sugar free ice cream. My husband couldn't get enough, and the non-diabetics loved it!"
"323","5","First, if you use salted butter cut back on the amount of salt that the recipe calls for by half otherwise the recipe will be really salty. Second, instead of baking it for thirty minutes cut that time in half otherwise it will be over done. Third, instead of 6 tablespoons of butter add 8 tablespoons. Other than that the recipe was really good."
"314","5","As a southern girl, I've had many variations of peach cobbler. This one definitely tops them all. I too cut my peaches into thicker wedges, 4 tbsp cornstarch and 8 tbsp butter."
"279","5","This is peach cobbler perfection! Delicious, old-fashioned taste. The brown sugar makes it so yummy and the crust has the perfect texture. I used 6 peaches and had ample filling. I highly recommend this recipe."
"273","5","We just loved this peach cobbler. I made it for my Mom's birthday, and it was quite the hit. We served it with vanilla Bluebell ice cream. If you make it in a 9'x13' pan like I did, be sure to increase the topping - maybe even double it. It is the best part of the dish, and we didn't have enough of it - several spots that were peach only. Also I'd increase the amount of cornstarch that is called for; we had a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan that did not thicken up, nevertheless it was all delicious, and we'll definitely make this one again and again. We used a good vegetable peeler to peel the peaches - made the job a lot easier."
"134","5","Excellent! After trying many recipes, I think this is my favorite. I made it exactly according to the recipe other than using only about half of the amount of the cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top.  For my own taste, I would probably cut down a little on the sugar next time, as my husband and I both prefer our desserts a little less sweet than most people.   I would probably also use more cornstarch, since it came out pretty liquidy. (But my peaches were a bit overripe and very juicy.)  A lot of people have commented that there isn't enough topping. The recipe calls for a 2-quart baking dish - that's an 8x8' pan. It sounds like a lot of the people are using 9x13 pans - that has nearly twice the surface size, so of course the topping isn't enough for that size pan. In an 8x8 pan, the topping was enough to just cover the top completely. With more batter in that size pan, the topping might not cook all the way through.   But with that said, I do agree that the amount of peaches was a bit much for that size pan and the amount of topping. I'd probably only use 6 peaches next time, for the same size pan. For a 9x13 pan, I'd probably increase the peach mixture by half, and double the topping."
"88","4","Very Good! Caution for those who are tempted to double the topping. The topping needs to be exposed to the heat in order to make a nice cobbler crust, so any dough that is unexposed to direct heat will be soft a gooey."
"87","3","This is an okay recipe. To me though, it's not a peach cobbler, it's peaches and biscuits. I live in the south and I don't know why this would be called southern peach cobbler. It was way to dry my family added cream to it just because it was to dry, and didn't have much of a taste. I followed the recipe as stated. I think next time I will be sticking to my old peach cobbler recipe."
"82","5","This came out really well... I had to double the recipe because I was cooking it for about 15-20 people! I went to the store only to find they had absolutely no fresh peaches! So I bought 7 bags of high quality frozen peaches. Defrosted them and followed the recipe exactly. Next time I may add another bag of peaches because there seemed to be much more dough than peaches... Oh and don't worry if the dough doesn't get all crumbly it should still come out just fine. I did have to cook it about 25 minutes longer than the recipe called for probably because I doubled it but I really also like a crisp top. Just pay attention to it towards the end to make sure you don't over cook the top. The cinnamon may make it appear as if it is golden and done but you really have to open the oven and take a good look at it to make sure. I have been now named the family's official cobbler maker! Thank you for sharing this really yummy recipe! I will be uploading a picture soon."
"76","5","Awesome topping-- everyone loved it. I skipped the 10 minutes baking the peaches on their own, and it turned out fine.  Also, I wonder why the recipe calls for boiling water-- I learned that everything needs to be COLD to create a tender crust. I used room-temp water, and the topping turned out great.  Thirdly, I'm not quick with a pastry cutter, so I opted to freeze my butter, grate it, and then freeze it again. This kept the butter cold and in little bits in the dough, which results in a tender topping."
"60","4","Wonderful and extremely easy recipe. The only changes I made was to use 1/2 cup of light brown sugar instead of 1/4 white and 1/4 brown. Also, as someone else suggested, used big slices of fresh peaches to feel texture. Last piece of advise on how to skin your peaches: 1. prepare a big pot of boiling water on high heat 2. Drop your peaches in and time it 55 to 60 seconds (and not a second more) 3.while waiting prepare a big bowl with ICE cold water with lots of ice in it 4. take peaches out of boiling water and drop them in ice cold one. If your peaches were ripe and you did everything right skin will slide right off the peaches. This is called blanching."
"44","5","This was my first time making cobbler and it turned out great!! I doubled the topping after reading the reviews and I'm glad I did it was the perfect amount. I also substituted white flour for whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup oats to add a little crisp. I will definitely be making it again."
"42","5","I have been using this recipe for about a year now, and find that it is great with every type of fruit imaginable. I have of course used peaches, as well as, blueberries, blackberries, mango (was surprisingly good), cherries, and apples so far. I find this recipe to be very quick and easy for the results. Last summer I also made batches of the filling and then froze it, and had delicious cobbler all winter long.  When it comes to the topping I found that spooning in small little droplets (about the size of a grape), all over the filling netted the best result. It keeps the topping from being too thick in anyone place, and I generally have a bit of the topping left over."
"37","5","So good I almost slapped my momma!"
"34","5","Definately one of my new favorite deserts! I stuck to the recipe completely, though next time will use slightly more cornstarch as mine was still a little soupy. Here's what I did for the baking of it though. Put the peaches, and everything that goes with the peaches into a large cast iron skillet, cook on the stove boiling and letting it thicken for 8-10 min. Then scoop the cobbler topping on top and sprinkle with cin/sugar, same cooking as before.  p.s. do not forget to foil line a baking sheet to put under your dish!"
"27","5","Fabulous if you reduce the sugar. I took (as usual) other reviewers advice, and it turned out really, really perfect! I changed all of the '1/4 cup' sugars (with the peaches, and with the flour) to '1 Tablespoon' each, and it was still sweet, but pleasant. I also made an extra half of the topping (ie: 1.5 cups flour, 1.5 Tbsp white sugar, 1.5 Tbsp brown sugar, etc)  For the sprinkle on top, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon is plenty."
"26","5","This was delicious! the crust was soft and sweet... i used fresh peaches even though they are nowhere near in season, but the whole thing, top to bottom came out delicious. will definitely use this again."
"25","5","Make this once and you will get requests to make again and again. I have to confess though, I have never actually used fresh peaches. Either because they aren't in season, or I'm just feeling too darn lazy to go to the trouble. If you are a lazy bum like me, just make sure and drain the peaches real well. I think I use about 3-4 cans of the kind that is in juice, not syrup. Also, serve with vanilla icea cream to get the full experience. My boyfriend and his daughter request this for their birthday instead of cake."
"21","4","I'm not a peach cobbler fan but this was good. I added 2 cups blueberries and some cinnamon to the peaches and used a few tablespoons of flour in place of the cornstarch. As others suggested, I lowered the heat to 375 after baking the peach mixture at 425 for 10 minutes. The peaches were not mushy at all and the topping was nicely browned."
"20","5","Wow! This is a beautiful, easy to do cobbler! I don't even LIKE peach cobbler- but my family does. The topping is what does it for me. Thank you again to the person who suggested the boiling water method of removing the skins of the peaches- they literally slid off! No wasted peach!  I doubled the recipe and I added a handful of raspberries- it was incredible and gave the cobbler some eye-catching color and tartness. This is the only peach cobbler recipe I will ever use again."
"19","4","Well, I'm from the South and I thought this was a little too sweet as written. If I make it again, I will definitely decrease the sugar somewhere (maybe also leave off the extra sugar in the cinnamon/sugar mixture that gets sprinkled over the top. If anyone uses the boiling water then cold water method to remove the skins, make sure you either do one at a time (removing the skin/chopping up one peach while another one is boiling) or take them out of the cold water immediately. I did all of my peaches at once and then let them sit in the cold water as I did them one at a time. The first peach worked beautifully - skin came right off. The subsequent peaches were harder and harder to get the skins off, until ultimately it was like I didn't put them in the boiling water at all. So I think you have a 'time limit' in which to get the skins off once you've put them in the cold water. I used 7 peaches and had enough filling. I also used 5 teaspoons of cornstartch, which kept my filling from being runny."
"16","5","Very good cobbler, the only suggestion I have is to cut the sugar/cinnamon mix that you sprinkle on top in half, the stated amount is way too much and makes it impossible to tell when the cobbler is golden brown."
"16","5","I really enjoyed this recipe. The only two changes I made were not hugely significant: I had some nectarines on hand as well as peaches so I used half nectarines and half peaches. It turned out great. The other was that with the extra 2 Tbsp. of butter left over from the cube of butter I pinched little pieces off and dolloped them onto the cobbler dough before baking. I don't know if this made a difference in the texture or not, but the cobbler was delightfully crispy and delicious. One thing I thought was strange though was what is the point of taking the time to cut the butter in when the point of cutting butter is to create a pastry like dough, but since you pour boiling water into the dough it just melts the butter, making the dough less pastry-like and more biscuit-y (not a problem for me, but just thought I'd mention it)? I will definitely make this recipe again!"
"15","5","Edit: I should also say I used a 9x13 pan and this time I did 1.5 the amount of topping. The topping is wonderful. Original: This is amazing! I didn't change a thing other than cooking it for only 25 mins the second time. This is the peach cobbler recipe for me! I picked up a tip from another peach cobbler recipe on this site: to get the skins off, take a pot of boiling water and put the peaches in it for about a minute. Carefully remove them from the water and let them cool slightly. The skins peel right off! And it's also really easy to cut them apart too."
"15","5","This is a great recipe. My husband loved it. I think next time I will use a little more peaches because we like our cobblers a little thicker."
"14","5","Very, very yummy!! I used two bags of frozen peaches and it turned out VERY good! I'm sure fresh Georgia peaches would be 100x better, but in the dead of winter frozen peaches worked fine."
"13","4","This is a wonderful recipe! I wasn't happy with the topping so I made my own because this batter is thick and didn't look very pretty. Used crumb topping consisting of brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and chilled butter. I covered it lightly with foil half way into cooking so the topping wouldn't burn......amazing!"
"13","5","This was an excellent Cobbler. I made minor modifications, based on other reviews..Added an extra 2tsp of cornstarch, lemon zest and 1 tsp almond extract to the filling, as well as 1 cup of blueberries. For the topping, i made 1.5 of it, and baked it all in a 9x13 dish. Delicious!"
"13","5","I tried this for a potluck, so I decided to increase the serving size to 12. I also used Del Monte's Orchard Select Peaches (jarred) which are amazing! The initial peach mixture had more liquid which I expected from canned peaches, but I added a little more cornstarch than called for, and sprinkled a couple handfuls of oats over the peaches to help soak up some juices. The breading soaked it all up nicely, and the whole dish came out moist and delicious! I got rave reviews at the potluck!"
"12","4","I love me some cobbler, and this recipe was a big success. I did, however, make several changes based on a pretty thorough review of the other reviews... 1) I did not bother to peel the peaches, 2) I cut bigger chunks rather than thin slices, 3) I cut the sugar for the fruit part in half, 4) I increased the topping amt made by 50%, 5) I also cut the sugar for the topping in half, 6) and I should have just mixed 1 TBS of sugar with the 1 tsp cinnamon for the final topper, I threw out most of the sugar/cin mix I had made b/c it would have been way too much. A lot of changes, but the recipe came out super yummy!"
"11","4","My family is known to have one of THE best Peach Cobblers in the State of Texas. This filling closely resembles what we typically put in a cobbler, so I knew right away it was going to be a winner. The only reason I didn't give this a 5star was because I thought it deserved some BUTTER! I put half a stick of butter in the filling, because I like a juicy and buttery tasting filling. It came out great! The crust was DELISH and I will be making this again! I will likely be adding some ground up walnuts and oats to the mixture for an added layer of flavor. But even if you don't this recipe is a winner! Also, I used canned peaches....I used one can plus the juice of another can. LOL YES, I like it juicy. I can't wait to fix this again!"
"11","5","Flavor is divine. I like more pie crust type cobblers, but this will definitely do! I found that the peach to dough ratio was just fine, added a tsp vanilla to peach mixture and added extra cornstarch as recommended. I'll do without extra cornstarch next time because I think the dense crust needs the extra juice. Thanks!"
"10","5","I was really torn between the drop-biscuit type of cobbler or the lattice top, but I'm soo glad I went with this one. I only used 6 peaches and had plenty of filling. I made 1.5 the amount of topping because that's my favorite part, but that's just personal preference, the amount stated in the recipe would have been just fine. I threw in a bit more cornstarch only because my peaches weren't all ripe. This turned out perfect! My grandpa who's from the South raved about this! However, I do have to add that peeling the peaches were the biggest pain in the butt! Boiling them and tossing them in iced water only worked for the really ripe peaches, I'd suggest a vegetable peeler. Also, I think canned sliced peaches would work just fine--I doubt many could tell the difference. Anyhow, absolutely delicious! Thank you!"
"10","5","Slap yo mama good! Easy as heck, peaches are way toooo expensive, frozen was too, so I used canned and they turned out GREAT! First time I left some of the canned juice in it, but there really isn't a need for it! If you want more 'cake' double the topping recipe, although I love it just the way it is! By accident when I made this the first time i did not read the instructions thoroughly, so I sprinkled with BROWN sugar and some cinnamon. 2nd time I did it the right way (with white sugar) and loved the brown sugar/cinnamon more!"
"10","3","Maybe my peaches weren't as juicy as everyone else's, but if I didn't add much more liquid I would have had cinnamon flavored paste with my peaches. After having to tweak the filling part of the mixture as much as I did (I added a couple of pats of butter, 1/4 c milk, and 1/2 cup water -- wanted to add some brandy for depth of flavor, but didn't want the extra calories), I just used my regular Bisquick cobbler topping (1 c Bisquick, 1/4 c milk, 1/4 c sour cream 2 T sugar). The end result was wonderful, but improvising made it turn out well. Of course, I don't think my peaches were from Georgia, so that probably had something to do with it! ;~)"
"10","5","I work as a baker in a middle school cafeteria and was looking for something different than the normal crust we use for cobbler. I used this recipe's topping for 100 servings of blueberry cobbler and without fail, everyone who ate it said it was the best they had ever eaten (missing vanilla ice cream only). Thank you very, very much."
"10","1","I made this cobbler for a church social we were having. I had great hopes in it turning out well with all the good ratings it had recieved. But I must say I was Very Disappointed in its turnout.The overall look came out too dark from the cinnamon mixture{easy fix}. On serving, I noticed it was a bit runny.Although, the following day after refrigeration,that wasn't the case. But the one thing I cannot ignore: the batter cooked up bitter. Baking powder most likely the culprit. The peaches taste was pretty good , something to work with. But the batter is a total DO-OVER. It was not a scrape down to the bottom item at church, which usually occurs."
"9","5","Excellent recipe! As written, the recipe provides a little less crust than I like so I just increased the crust ingredients by 50% the next time I baked it and it was perfect. Also, it is a bit sweet so if you prefer a more tart cobbler you can decrease the sugar a little."
"9","5","This was FABULOUS!!!! I took it to a gathering where there ended up being 5 fruit desserts (cherry pie, apple pie, raspberry tartlet, etc.) and it was the only one that got RAVE reviews! I did do two alterations - 1. I increased the topping to about one and half times as others had suggested. 2. I used 6 peaches and a pint of blueberries since I had them on hand and it sounded good to me. Everyone LOVED it - I even got a 'this is just like my grandmother would make!' Definitely a keeper recipe."
"9","1","I was very disappointed with this recipe. The batter of the cobbler turned into more of a cake consistency, and did not have much flavor. I typically make a cobbler with more of a streusel topping, but wanted to try something different. I would not make this again."
"8","1","I followed the recipe exactly, except that I accidentally put 3 instead of 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in it (accidentally grabbed the 1.5 teaspoon). It was a runny mess. Peach soup as another reviewer described it. There was more peach juice than anything else. The peaches were floating and the dough was sinking. Even the accidental extra teaspoon of cornstarch didn't help to thicken it. The crust was still raw after 30 minutes @ 425 but the sugar topping was starting to burn."
"8","5","This was fantastic! Only thing I did differently was used 10 peaches, and cut them into small chunks (was feeding 7 people.) I baked the first half at home, then waited to bake it the final 30 minutes until I was at the house where it would be consumed. Let it cool for about 20 minutes before we topped with vanilla ice cream - so yummy and simple!"
"8","5","This is a classic recipe which is fine as written. However, like any similar dish using fresh fruit, your proportions often should be adjusted slightly based on the size of your fruit and the degree of ripeness. I slightly under-measured my sugar as my peaches were pretty ripe and used a tiny bit less baking powder. I also used a little less white sugar and made up for it with more brown sugar, just because that is my preference in a recipe like this. The only thing I wish I'd done differently is to spread the batter more thin over the top because it was a bit thick in places, but that's easy to do next time. All-in-all, a 5 star classic!"
"8","5","I really enjoyed this recipe - and I'm not a big cobbler fan! It was a little sweet for my liking, so the second time I made this I cut back on the sugars just a tad. Oh, and fresh peaches make all the difference in the world! Thanks for sharing."
"8","5","This is completely delicious! The only change I made to this recipe was that I only used 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder because I didn't want too cakey a cobbler. I also slightly reduced the quantity of sugar - maybe using only 3 tablespoons of white sugar and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar. Also, I followed what another reviewer said and boiled the fresh peaches for 60 seconds before taking off the peel. It was definitely easier after boiling them to remove the peel but I also peeled a few with a vegetable peeler with no trouble. This cobbler tasted absolutely amazing. Both my boyfriend and I loved it."
"8","5","Just Wonderful!! Why would I make pie when it much easier to make cobbler. Doubled Peach filling except for the sugar and made 1 1/2 times the topping. Baked in a 9x13 glass dish and served with homemade vanilla ice cream. It doesn't get better than this!"
"8","5","This is the cobbler recipe I've been searching for! Easy to make and delicious. The topping is perfect. I served it for dessert tonight and my family couldn't get enough. I was hesitant to put the cinnamon sugar on top because I thought it would be too sweet. I didn't quite use the full amount but it complimented the dish nicely. I will definitely make this again. Thanks Amy!"
"7","5","followed directions to the letter. would not change a thing. came out perfect. lots of acalades."
"7","4","Very good cobbler, probably not the best I've had, but, still very good. Who would not like a warm cobbler made with sweet Georgia peaches and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on top?"
"7","3","I followed the directions exactly, I even used real peaches, no cans.......it wasn't bad, but it came out sickly sweet. I mean so sweet my lips and cheeks puckered with each bite.....we just couldn't eat it."
"7","5","This was really simple and SOO good. It was my first time making peach cobbler, and this was way easy. I didn't bake it as long as it said to, I think I only baked it for about 22-25 mins total. I just watched it and took it out when it was brown enough for me. The top part was sweet enough, but not too much. Went with the peaches wonderfully. I used fresh peaches and the flavor was delicious. I will definitly make this again."
"7","5","This came out really good. I doubled the crust as other viewers suggested and i'm so glad I did. I also put 2 tablespoon of cornstarch and it came out perfect."
"7","5","After taking my daughter peach picking this week, I was left with a bounty of ripe fruit and this recipe was my choice to highlight its flavor...and a good one! It did not turn out soggy as others complained, but we did let it cool completely before eating. (It did turn a little soggy the next day, but that's to be expected.) Also, there was a lot of liquid in the bowl after mixing the peaches with the sugar mixture (and letting it sit a few minutes), so I only poured 1/2 of that liquid into the baking dish. To combat the early browning, I checked the cobbler at 20 minutes and then turned the oven down to 375 for the last 10 minutes. We enjoyed this cobbler by reheating individual servings in the microwave for 25 seconds on 70% power. Some vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect complement. I would not call this recipe perfect--I was not fond of the topping, which was a bit too plentiful--so I might try another before settling on this one again. But it was very delicious and I might just have to go peach picking again! *Update 9/2/06* I made this again yesterday and I have upped my rating to five stars! I did not have any early browning issues and I made one minor change and reduced the amount of sugar in the topping by 1 tablespoon. Next time, I think Turbinado sugar might be an interesting choice for the topping. I love how the cake has a light texture that is not too sweet."
"7","5","Really easy to make and turned out great. The whole family loved it. Will definitely make it again."
"7","1","I did not like this recipe at all. Way too sweet. I couldn't taste the natural sweetness of my peaches at all because of the sugar. I also did not care for the crust on top. Reminded me of the peach cobbler in a tv dinner...yuck!"
"7","5","Fantasic cobbler. I used salted butter so I cut back on that but otherwise great. My first attempt at a cobbler and a total success. Yeah Amy!!"
"7","5","I take care of my elderly parents and the first time I made this last summer my dad said it was just like his mother used to make. That is the ultimate compliment in my family. Terrific recipe. Thanks so much Amy."
"6","4","Delicious flavor and texture. I will use 10+ peaches next time with the other measurements as is since it was a bit sweet and it needed more of the star ingredient. I was second guessing the oven temperature and thought it was strangely high. Against my judgment, I put the cobbler in the oven and went to walk the dog. When I returned, it had been in only 23 minutes and the topping was burned. Underneath the burnt top of the breading, the remainder was still a bit doughy. It still tasted really good! I will make this against but will bake the peaches at 425 for 10 minutes then turn the oven down to 375 for about half an hour for the rest of the baking."
"6","3","Made as written. Way too much sugar in every part of it for my taste. I might try it with half the sugar, and none sprinkled on top."
"6","2","I have had peach cobbler many times over and I decided to give this recipe a try as it seemed popular and highly rated. I can say that I will not be making this recipe again. The crust is more like a dump cake crust versus the traditional cobbler crust I desire and even with extra baking time, the underside of the 'crust' at the center was still raw and the edges were beginning to burn. Overall, the crust tastes okay....just not what I would refer to as 'cobbler'."
"6","4","We thought this was very good but we just prefer the crumb topping to the bread I guess."
"6","4","very good! I have never made peach cobbler before but with the excellent peach peeling skills of my husband, this was a snap. the topping was great though the filling was a little runny with the amount of cornstarch in the recipe: I will add more next time and trust me, there will be a next time. Thanks for sharing, we really loved it with vanilla ice cream! indulgent!"
"6","4","very nice taste! the 'topping' is more cake like then the crumbly kind i'm used to... still delicious. after reading other reviews i decided to only bake mine for 23 minutes and it came out not so burnt looking. thank you for the recipe!"
"6","5","This is SOOOOOOO very good! I have made this recipe about twice a month all summer long. Last time I used a mix of peaches, blue, black, rasp, straw and marionberries! Turns out perfect every single time. Just be sure to put a sheet pan underneath to catch any boil over. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!"
"6","4","Yummy! I used nectarines because our tree is on overdrive this year. A little bit different from peach but just as good. Also, it is just my husband and me so I made these in 5' spring form pans and some in a muffin pans. after they cooled I froze the cobler muffins in the pan and then they pop out nice and clean, wrapped them in wax paper and plastic bags and they keep great for individual servings ready for when I want them this winter. Had to increase the topping by 1/2 to have enough topping with the seperate cobblers."
"6","5","Excellent! My daughter who doesn't like fruit desserts loved this one and she couldn't get enough. Next time I will increase the topping as I think it needed a little extra. Great recipe a must have. Thank you."
"6","5","WoW!! What a Great Cobbler! Its just the best! I am very pleased witht the way it turned out"
"6","5","This is absolutely THE BEST cobbler recipe out there. The fresher (juicier) the peaches use a little more cornstartch so it's not too soupy. I increased the topping recipe....perfect!! Nice consistency. I'm going to make again only this time add some of the topping crumbles mixed in with the peaches too. Not too much though...just enough to have some tasty crumbles throughout the peaches. Has anyone tried this?"
"6","5","Awesome peach cobbler! To make peeling the peaches easier put them into boiling water for a few seconds and then plunge into ice cold water. The skin will come right off!"
"6","5","I don't like peach cobbler, but this cobbler is AWESOME! it's not sticky sweet like a lot of the cobblers out there. I don't know how many peaches I used; mine were bruised and getting soft, so I trimmed and tossed them all in. I also added a heavy dash of cinnamon to the crust. Perfect without ice cream!"
"6","5","My family LOVES this cobbler! The second time I made it, I increased the topping part by 50% since my family likes a little more crust. Wonderful recipe!"
"5","5","OMG!!! This is the best peach cobbler I've ever made. To die for. Follow direction but tweeked just a bit. I added coarse sugar with the cinnamon for the final topping. Just that bit of sweet crunch to put it over the top. Adjusted to 3 level tsps. of cornstarch. and added 7 tblsps of butter instead of six and a bit more sugar and brown sugar overall. I'm from the South and we like it sweet and buttery. Definitely bake for the full amount of time or possible 5 minutes more depending on your oven. You won't be disappointed."
"5","5","I have been making this for a year now and it is the BEST peach cobbler!!! I do however have to increase my cooking time by an additional 10 mins, otherwise I have a gooey middle..."
"5","5","I made this cobbler with a few changes taken from some of the reviews. I used 6 medium sized peaches. I pitted and cut them into eights. I put all of the filling ingredients into a skillet and cooked for 6 minutes then added 3 teaspoons of corn starch. I lined my 8x8 dish with pie crust and poured filling in and baked at 400 for 7 minutes. I made topping per instructions spooned on top and sprinkled sugar mix on top. I baked at 425 for 25 minutes and took it out. Came out perfect for me. This will become a regular in my dessert rotation."
"5","4","This was very good! I was afraid while spooning the topping that there wasn't going to be enough, but after it baked, it was perfect.I will definitively make this again!Watch your time, 30 minutes was perfect for my oven any longer and it would have been to brown."
"5","5","I love this recipe. Have made it a couple of times and it is my new favorite cobbler.   I have switched up the fruit - first time I only had 4 peaches so I added equal parts apple and about a cup of frozen blueberries. Last night I used apple with some leftover canned pineapple.  I omitted the white sugar (effectively halving the sugar), and left off the cinnamon sugar topping.  The second time I mixed up the dough in the food processor and it worked really well. I used cold water instead of boiling, and last night I used the cold pineapple juice (yummy)."
"5","5","I have tried many any peach cobbler recipes and I always fine the bisquick one nasty and hard tasting. This was a nice change. I didn't have fresh peaches so I used 2 large cans of peaches and drained them. This did perfectly. I also did a tsp. each of the cinnamon and nutmeg in the peach mixture and it really tasted amazing with the extra spice. I think I may try this recipe with cherries and apples too, i love this!"
"5","5","This was my first time making and eating peach cobbler. I simply went for a highly rated recipe, and this one is perfect. I can't believe I waited so long to try it, and I can't wait to get more peaches and make it again. The cobbler part is absolutely perfect, not too crisp, not too doughy and the cinnamon is just right. This one is right up there with my all time favorite recipes on this site!!"
"5","5","Delicious recipe, I love that it uses fresh peaches instead of canned. I added about 1/2 cup of oats and increased the flour by 1/4 cup for the topping. came out nice and crunchy."
"5","5","One word... AMAZING! I'm not a huge peach fan so instead we used this recipe but used 4 apples instead of 8 peaches and it was delicious! The cakey topping with cinnamon and sugar mixture was so good! If you are planning on making a peach/apple cobbler, use this recipe! Some people said it was a little hard to tell if the top was golden because of the cinnamon, but don't worry you'll know! Do not risk the delicious cinnamon flavor! :P"
"5","5","This was great. I used fresh peaches as directed. It got raves on Laber day weekend. Thanks"
"5","5","This recipe...all I can say is my lawd! :0)..Knock Your Socks of Peach Cobbler-nificent...is what this should be called!. The flavor is unbelievable, the spice, the cinnamon,the slight crunch..this so good ice cream on the side isn't necessary the the the..ssorry my mouth started to water again. I urge you to make this ' Peach Cobbler-nificent'! Guaranteed to be remembered!"
"5","5","Using the fruit I had on hand which was plums, apricots, and an apple instead of the peaches I ended up with a wonderful dish. I did everything else per the recipe and will definately make this again."
"5","5","Absolutely delicious! My family loved, loved, loved this. And while I'm sure fresh peaches would be out-of-this-world amazing in this, I just used canned ones because I decided to make this last minute and it was all I had in the house. I drained the peaches,cut back on the sugar, and cut the peaches into chunks and it was perfect. It's a very quick and easy dessert when you just want to be able to use what you have in your kitchen."
"5","5","Simply wonderful. I have friend and relative in Georgia. Everytime we visit them we go to either someone else's house or a new restaurant for a peach cobbler. They are usually ok, but not wonderful. I made THIS one of our last visit, and they are still talking about it. So nice to teach the Georgians how to bake!"
"5","5","This recipe was delicious. I trippled the cobbler and picked my own peaches. I also used a little Rum flavoring mixed with butter Land -o- Lakes only (brush the crust with rum & butter before pouring mixture in) and placed it all in a molded pan of crust. I layered it like a lasagna umm...umm...good. So far I have made (7) for my family members. This recipe was a 'BIG HIT'. I'm so glad I found it. Thank you, Thank you, and Thank you. This cobbler gets a 20 star from me. ***** The Best ***** Crystal"
"5","5","I have used canned peaches with this several times with great success. I just substitute 1 large can of peaches for the fresh and follow the recipe from there."
"5","5","This was very yummy! I was having a huge craving for peach cobbler, and after wandering through several recipes decided to use this one. Since I was short on time, I used one and a half large cans of sliced peaches rather than cooking my own. I just poured a little of the juices in the pan. For the dough, I added the cinnamon rather than topping with cinnamon sugar. And I used salted butter, so I omitted the salt altogether. Was very tasty, and not too hard!"
"5","5","SO YUMMY!! Brought to a BBQ on the 4th of July and everybody loved it. My favorite was the topping,, it was like a snickerdoodle cookie. (I think somebody else on here said that too) It is so pretty and tastes awesome. I have made it twice,, the second time I put the peaches in boiing water for a few seconds and then peeled them as suggested,, and it was SO MUCH easier!!"
"5","3","This was good, but needed some adjustments. Cornstarch needs to be doubled in this recipe and I baked mine at 375 for 30 minutes. 425 would defineitely have burned the topping before it cooked through. I also added a bit of vanilla to the peach mixture."
"5","5","This was a very easy recipe to follow and turned out delicious. The crust is great I used canned peaches as well and added sugar to taste. Even if you are not a pro my 13 yr can make this one."
"5","5","This was incredible!! Serving warm with vanilla ice cream is a must! I found that it got brown on top in 20-25 minutes instead of 30, and was just a tad soupy. The next time I made this, I used 4 tsp. cornstarch instead of 2, and that solved the soupy problem! I prefer not to slice the peaches thin - makes for a more chunky cobbler, and I don't peel the peaches - timesaver, and it's not even noticed! I also had to use a 3-qt dish to make everything fit. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"5","5","Such a unique and delicious cobbler. I doubled the breaded too as suggested by other users and I'm so glad I did! I tried this recipe twice, once with yellow peaches and once with white peaches. Although the white peach is usually my favorite, in this recipe I HIGHLY RECOMMEND only using yellow peaches. I'm going to definitely make this recipe again!"
"5","5","Big hit at Christmas dinner. Used 3lbs. frozen peaches--will try 4lbs. next time because I like lots of fruit. Added 2 tsp. Grand Marnier to the peach filling. Very yummy."
"5","3","This is good, but not great. I made this up twice. Both times I was disappointed. If you use salted butter, eliminate the salt in the dough or it will taste salty. Also, use really good peaches or you'll have to add more sugar so it won't taste bitter."
"5","5","we enjoyed. I used whole wheat flour and also only used the brown sugar (not the white). everyone wanted seconds."
"5","5","Delicious. It was good while hot with ice cream, and good th next day when a little warm too. Will be making again. Thanks!"
"4","5","i ate 3 peaches before i could start :)i used @ 3 cups fresh blueberries and 4 excellent Georgia peaches. this is the real georgia way my grandmother made peach cobbler."
"4","5","Oh My Goodness!!!! Oh My Goodness!!! Oh My Goodness!! I didn't change a thing. Amazing! I agree with some that the top is a little dark. It looks burned but it's not. It is just the cinnamon that has browned on top (deliciousness). The next time I make this, I will bake uncovered until it gets to the color I desire, then I will cover it loosely with foil so that the steam can escape for the remaining time. I can't wait until later this summer when the white peaches are in season! The Belle of Georgia is my favorite peach of all! White Nectar peaches are delicious too, and are not as fragile as the Belles. Here is some friendly advice from someone who used to live on a peach orchard.... using over-ripe peaches is best for this (or basically any fruit) recipe. They do not look as pretty and you may have to cut off a spot or two, but they are usually much cheaper (mine were given to me) and they are much tastier. Don't worry about the bruises. Those spots cook out. Also, NEVER buy a peach that you can hardly smell. It was picked too early and will never be sweet by itself. A peach should smell like a peach! And please don't squeeze them. They bruise easily!"
"4","5","I made this for the Family Chili Cook Off. I thought it was amazing, but ended up happening was my Great Aunt brought out Banana Pudding, and one thing Southern's adore is Banana Pudding. I stood no chance, a few folks ate my Peach Cobbler, but I went home with a lot. reheated it in the oven the next morning, and had it for a top notch breakfast."
"4","3","The topping wasn't great and had lumps, and the whole thing was a little bland, in my opinion. The texture ended up a little slimy."
"4","4","This cobbler turned out so well and lovely but was a touch too sweet for my liking. If you're into sweet cobbler, this is a great choice!"
"4","5","I made this for my wife and got laid...so I give it five stars! My wife said it was the best she had ever had...the cobbler that is. Also, i found that i needed to double the topping recipe to cover the entire top of the peaches. I also parboiled the peaches for an easy peel. This is seriously a legit recipe! Truly great cobbler."
"4","5","DELICIOUS! Would not change anything! I served it last night with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Could not have gotten better compliments!"
"4","1","Terrible, too much in it! Peaches are naturally sweet and do not need much added to make cobbler!"
"4","5","Canned peaches work too! I followed the recipe exactly, with the single exception of using 2 cans of mostly-drained sliced peaches instead of fresh. It turned out just beautiful, and very, very yummy..."
"4","5","best peach cobbler I've ever had!!"
"4","5","Came out fantastic! I did 1 1/2 times the topping recipe since I really like that part, and followed everything else exactly, and it came out great!"
"4","5","Followed exactly. Delicious! Husband is a cobbler fanatic and he LOVED this one."
"4","5","I made this tonight and WOW, so good! The topping was not like a pie crunch texture, kinda cakey with a crunch but very delicious! I did bake the peaches in the first step 20 minutes longer (30 total) since mine were a bit harder and I used 5 since mine were huge! To kick it up a notch I also threw in a 1/4 cup of bourbon in that step! I also substituted all sugar with Splenda and the Splenda brown blend (better for diabetics) except on the very top, I used real sugar just so it would caramelize! So yes I adjusted here and there but it was a great! Will make it again and try with various fruits in season!"
"4","5","OUTSTANDING!! Made exactly as the recipe states and it was yum-o-rama! Served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Will be making this again and again."
"4","5","This was an absolutely delicious dish and very easy to make. By far the best peach cobbler I've ever had. Don't use canned peaches...."
"4","5","This was exceptionally good. I followed the recipe with the only deviation being I used frozen sliced peaches instead of fresh."
"4","5","My family loved this! I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers and doubled the cornstarch and added 1T add'l cornstarch. Wonderful winter dessert using my frozen peach inventory from fall harvest!"
"4","5","This was fantastic! I made it for Thanksgiving. I was a littel afraid of it so I made one for 4 of us at breakfast first. It was all gone by dinner. Also was a hit at Thanksgiving later on. I used frozen peaches and I am getting ready to make it again this morning. Took 2 - 16oz bags. Otherwise didn't change a thing."
"4","5","I made this cobbler & added a roll out crust on the bottom & layered with peaches.. Put the mixture on top of peaches & a 2nd roll out pie crust on top & cinnamon sugar on top! Excellent! Bake until golden. Enjoy"
"4","3","This is a very cakey cobbler. It tastes alright, not like you would expect peach cobbler to taste though. I would cut the cooking time too, it almost burned on top at 30 minutes."
"4","1","WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR to put on a naturally sweet fruit! It is cake-like and not a crumble topping which I have learned we like better---also, there are no nuts in this recipe--I added some."
"4","5","This is pretty kick *** I'm kind of a main course sort of guy but I love Peach Cobbler and couldn't get anyone to make it for me but I found Peaches on sale and this recipie at about the same time so I decided to make my own. Over the top good! Apparently we are not allowed to use Biblical words like *** here so I edited my review."
"4","5","Made 1 & 1/2 times the dough mixture. Delicious!!!"
"4","5","This is an exceptional recipe! Fresh and superbly delicious. I cut my peaches into thick wedges and it worked great. Also, another reviewers suggestion to peel the peaches couldn't have been easier. Just drop the peach in boiling water for about 60 seconds and then drop in a bowl of ice water for about 60 seconds. The skins will slide right off. Yay! I will definitely be making this recipe again and just for my taste I will be doubling the topping. Loved loved loved it!"
"4","5","This is the best peach cobbler I have ever made! (Or eaten) Served hot out of the oven, it was the most delicious, bubbly comfort food ever!"
"4","5","I decided to try a new recipe after using my favorite recipe for several years. This took a little more effort, but was not difficult, and this will now be my recipe of choice. I made it exactly as written."
"4","5","Great!"
"4","5","I've never had cobbler before so I didn't know if I would like it or not. The first batch I made, the crust was too dry and sank. Not so pretty, but tasty. The second batch I made I added a little more water to the batter and it turned out perfectly. Very delicious!"
"4","5","All I had was canned peaches, so I estimated how much to use, but it was delicious anyway!!! I happened to have one of those ginormous cans of peaches, like a school might use, and then doubled the recipe. It worked out fine for the crowd I was cooking for. :-)"
"4","4","Like other reviewers said, the sugar in the filling needs to be reduced and the topping needs to be doubled (I used an 8 x 8 pan). I didn't use all of the cinnamon sugar mixture and I baked the topping for 18 - 20 minutes. Other than that, this is a great recipe."
"4","3","It was good, but VERY (TOO) sweet. I made a recipe in the past that was better but can't find it. I'll keep trying recipes on this site until I find it."
"4","4","Really sweet, but good. Next time I'll use half the sugar."
"4","5","I used this recipe specifically for the crust. I have been looking for a crust like my Grandma used to make... This was it! I used canned pie fruit - and it was great! My children now have a taste of history."
"4","5","This was great!! The cobbler is the best I have had. We had it with vanilla ice cream and when it melts in with the peaches it is so yummy. *tip- to easily peel the peaches dip them into boiling water for 30-60 seconds then dunk into ice cold water."
"4","5","yummy"
"4","5","Great recipe! Made as directed but next time I would double the topping. One review gave a great way to skin the peaches...place in boiling water for 60 sec. then place in a bowl of cold water- the skins peel right off in your fingertips!"
"4","5","Delicious, easy cobbler. I had to use canned peaches, because the fresh peaches at the grocery store weren't ripe enough. I used two cans of sliced peaches in juice, but probably should have used three. Not quite enough fruit. Still got raves, however."
"4","5","Great cobbler! My first one from scratch! I did the topping one and a half times the recipe and it was perfect. Some suggested peeling the peaches by boiling for 30 seconds and then putting in ice water... the skin came off with so much ease! Wish I'd found this recipe earlier in the peach season, since it's almost over. May try with canned peaches."
"4","5","Awesome! Made as directed. I didn't see what size pan to use and used an 9x13 and it was way too big. Other than that wonderful recipe!"
"4","5","Excellent (and up until today, I hated peach cobbler and baked peach pie)! The only thing that I did differently was to use Splenda in place of the white sugar in order to cut out a few calories and it was fine."
"4","5","I used canned peaches instead of fresh and it was fantastic! Will be making this time and time again!"
"4","5","This is SOOOOO good, words aren't enough to describe it. The topping is really good, I am so glad I doubled it on the advice of other reviewers. Baked it in a 9x13 glass pan with canned peaches and it was fabulous!"
"4","5","Tried this with fresh Ontario peaches this past August when they were in season, and it was fantastic! Did it again about 2 weeks later with about 5 nectarines, 2 apples and some raisins, and that was just as good too. It's just as good (if not better) after being covered for a day and the topping gets nice and soft. Thanks for this one, it will be used often."
"4","5","Family loves this. I did reduce the sugar a bit, and I personally thought it was still too sugary (but nobody else thought so). I also used half wheat flour, and baked for only 25 min."
"4","5","Best I've tried - and tried quite a few! Followed recipe exactly except cut back on the sugar cinnamon topping by about a 1/4."
"4","5","This is my new cobbler recipe. It was delicous. Instead of putting the first ingredients in the oven, I cooked them all on the stove top. I wanted to control how much the peaches were being cooked, because we like ours really soft. And I forgot to put the cornstarch in, but it turned out perfect. Also I didn't add the water to the topping, I doubled the topping mix and then layered the dry mix on top. I used a box grater to grate frozen butter so it would be easy to incorporate into the dry mix. I don't own a pastry blender so I always use my box grater. And I didn't put any more sugar on top, it was sweet enough as it was."
"4","2","I don't know what went wrong, but this recipe did not turn out at all. Maybe it was that my peaches were too ripe and juicy? All I know is it was very runny and the topping all sunk in and dissolved. It looked fine about half way through, but there was too much moisture and it ended up being peach soup. It was a disaster. I was embarrassed because it was for a dinner with friends, too. We ended up using it as topping on the vanilla ice cream instead. Too bad. I'll be trying another recipe next time."
"4","4","Turned out very delicious. My peaches weren't very ripe, but I was delighted by how well it turned out- I didn't change a thing; by substituting margarine for butter, it can be a kosher dish. 2nd time: Way to watery. Not sure what happened..."
"4","5","I followed this recipe almost exactly and it came out wonderfully! I used 9 fresh peaches (they were small peaches). My husband, who is a born southerner, says that this was the best peach cobbler he'd ever tasted."
"4","3","this was a bit too sweet for me. And it wasn't very good served cold because the topping got very hard."
"4","4","Very good cobbler, but not the best one I've tried. One thing I will change next time is not use brown sugar in the batter. I'll use 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 1/4 cup of each. The brown sugar made the batter a dark color and also I think it made the top burn a little. Overall, a good cobbler recipe and it wasn't difficult to make."
"4","5","I have made this recipe many times. I use Splenda in place of the white sugar. It always turns out delicious. I have also tried a little more cornstarch, which does help thicken the sauce. The dish is always clean at the office/church potluck! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"4","5","This was excellent. couldn't get fresh peaches, so i used plums instead and it was amazing! the fruit was sweet, so next time i might cut down the sugar a bit. also, i baked the fruit for about 20 minutes before adding the topping, then only needed to bake for another 20 minutes till it was done. i followed the recipe exactly, except that i added a little milk to the dough to make it softer and easier to spoon. this looked beautiful when it came out, with the top lovely and golden and the fruit bright pinky purple! the first cobbler i ever made and i'll definitely make more."
"4","5","My 11 year old grandson and I made this tonite and it was very good topped with vanilla ice cream while still warm from oven.You need to put 4-5 tsp. of cornstarch in filling to get just right.Good and easy recipe!"
"4","4","Boy oh boy...did my hubby ever like this dessert! He said I could make it for him all summer long. He loved it. My children thought it was okay (hence the 4 star rating), and thought that I over-cooked it because the top was 'brown'. I told them that it was cinnamon topping(but perhaps I did cook it just a bit too long). I used a bag of frozen peaches, and 2 fresh peaches. I could not tell the difference between the two after this was cooked up! Anyway...give this delicious dish a try, you won't be disappointed."
"4","5","By far, the best cobbler I have ever had! This is just the recipe I've been searching for ...thank you for sharing. I would not change a thing :)"
"3","5","YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY!"
"3","2","This recipe just didn't taste the way I remember peach cobbler tasting"
"3","5","This was amazing ! I made it for my boyfriend who loves peaches. I on the other hand don't like them. We sat watching tv and devoured it. Im shocked I ate so much of it. We have decided that it should be inplace of dinner....because we didnt stop till it was gone !!!"
"3","5","This peach cobbler was amazing, following some of the other reviews I added a bit less sugar, milk instead of water for step 3, and an extra peach. It turned out perfect! This recipe was so good that I decided to write my first review. It is more cake-like on top of the peaches, it relies on the sugar topping for its crispness which I like. I will definitely be making this again."
"3","5","Easy recipe and is delicious! Agree with a couple of others that the topping needs to be increased, but other than that perfect!"
"3","4","Delicious! It was a little too sweet for me, so next time I am going to leave out the brown sugar on the peaches themselves."
"3","5","This was the best Peach cobbler ever!! I did 1 1/2 recipes of the peach mixture and 2 recipes of the topping and cooked it in a 9'x13' pan. I tried the blanching method for the peaches and the were very hard to cut as they were very moist and the pits kept breaking. But blanching them did make the peaches softer in the end. I also cut the peaches into thicker wedges and they turned out perfect. Overall, with a few modifications, this is the best recipe around! :)"
"3","5","Im just learning how to cook for the family and I think this is an awesome and easy recipe! I am eighteen and I help my foster family with dinner almost every night! I give this recipe 5 stars! I absolutely loved it! :-)"
"3","5","This was the first cobbler I ever tried making. It was easy enough to make (peeling the peaches takes time) and it tastes wonderful! I used fresh peaches from a friend's tree. They were a little smaller so I used more than eight. Otherwise, didn't change a thing in the recipe."
"3","1","This recipe disappointed it tasted like warm peaches with raw cookie dough on top."
"3","5","I've made this several times using fresh peaches from the farm stand we frequent. I have not had any of the problems some of the negative reviews mention about runny filling, it being too sweet, or the topping part not coming out quite right. It's been the perfect sweetness for my super sweet tooth and my boyfriend's not so sweet tooth, it's not been too runny (try leaving the peaches in the oven for slightly longer before adding the topping would be my suggestion for that), and we enjoy the topping very much. I made the original recipe the first time, the second time I changed the sugar to splenda and we liked that a little better (made us feel slightly less guilty as well), and the 3rd time I added about 2/3 tsp of almond extract to the topping and a 1/2 tsp to the peaches. The winning combination for us was the addition of the almond extract. It adds a whole new dimension to the cobbler. For the cinnamon sugar that goes on top, many people have said it's hard to tell when it's done- don't use the whole amount! I don't, I just sprinkle enough cinnamon sugar (which I keep premade in a spice jar in my spice cabinet) to look pretty, and we're good to go!"
"3","5","Wonderful and pretty simple. I would do one thing differently--I would make the spoon-sized dollops of cobbler that you drop on top of the peaches smaller than a spoon size--I liked the cobbler more crumbly and less doughy, and when the sizes were bigger, I noticed that they were more cake-or bread-like, and not cobbler-like. Very easy problem to fix, though!"
"3","5","This dessert recipe could not be any easier. I used both fresh peaches and nectarines; both were not quite ripe yet but you would never know it from the final results. The first cobbler I've made that the fruit did not turn to mush while baking; the slices remained perfect and were so wonderfully tender. Yum! Now, when baking I rarely change the recipe but my sister said 'yuck' when I told her brown sugar was an ingredient so I used all white sugar. We really think it is the best fruit cobbler I have made. (And there will be a time when I will use the called-for brown sugar.) The leftovers (can you believe there were any?!) went to my workplace and the recipe was requested my several co-workers (it is fun to share good recipes and I'm printing them now). I never review recipes but had to with this one. This will be my 'go-to' cobbler recipe. Thank you aeposey for sharing!"
"3","5","It's ridiculous how good this is. My kids and I started with a bowl for each of us and we ended up eating right out of the pan. Now that's our tradition that we just eat out of the pan. House smells great while it's baking. My daughter always calls her best friend to let her know I've made it and she usually comes running over. Really good recipe. Thanks."
"3","5","I gave this a try the other day and I really loved it!   However, I adjusted the amount of flour topping to double as it was not enough to cover the peaches in the dish and also the second time i made it i sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon mixture in about 10 minutes before it was done because the first time the sugar was getting burnt when sprinkled on too early! Also add a few more teaspoon of cornstarch in the peach mixture as it was too watery."
"3","4","Everyone loved it but it would be just a bit better with a little more moisture. I Used canned peaches since fresh peaches were not available."
"3","4","Great recipe. I used up the last of my summer canned peaches to make this, two jarfuls. I zoned out while I was making it (too many dishes on the go), and accidentally put 1/2 cup of each type of sugar in the wet mix, but it turned out fine (taste wise, perhaps not waist wise!). The cinnamon mix on top is a must, and the dough is lovely. I prefer thinner, almost-crunchy topping, so I would recommend sprinkling it in a crumbly, evenly distributed fashion rather than dropping spoonfuls, but that's preference. Fantastic fresh out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or dollop of whipped cream (or both)."
"3","5","I made this last night for my small Thanksgiving dinner with my children. It was crispy and delicious and eaten up! They requested another so I started making it tonight and realized I used cornstarch in my biscuit topping instead of baking powder. It is still delicious done correctly but that extra crispy topping was really awesome. Sometimes mistakes make for a good recipe also! Thanks for sharing this, it is a keeper mistakes or not!"
"3","5","Wow...this was a huge hit today for Thanksgiving. I've never made a peach cobbler before; I only remember how my grandma's tasted, and it was the world's best. This was my very first go at it, so when people told me this was one of the best peach cobblers they had ever had, even resembling my grandma's, I knew the recipe was a keeper. Thank you so much.  BTW, I followed the instructions to the letter, and discovered later (by those that know these things) that the key to this recipe's success is how the butter is handled: cold, cut into slices, kneaded into the mixture by hand until coarse. If you mistakenly melt the butter instead, the dough turns into biscuits, FYI."
"3","5","Followed the recipe exactly, except used 5.5 peaches instead of 8 (because they were pretty big). This turned out delicious! I loved the crunch of the topping with the sweet peaches and goo of the inside. Served with vanilla ice cream and it was amazing. Will definitely make this again while there are still fresh peaches around."
"3","5","This is excellent. The crust came out soft but crispy on top (even with a little less butter), and the filling was delicious. I made it with raspberries and nectarines. I also cut back a little on the sugar. Thank you so much for sharing. Made this again with strawberries and peaches. I might use a little less sugar next time, but it was still great."
"3","4","Made this last night as we had peaches and nectarines that were really ripe. It came out delicious. I did not have cornstarch so I used flour. I added a handful of blueberries to the peaches and nectarines and cut the sugar in half. I had never had cobbler before and everyone just loved it and I will be making it again."
"3","5","Amazing! Company loved this! I doubled the peach part, with the exception of the sugar. I kept that at 1/4 c. each. I also used 8 tsp. cornstarch for the double batch (as my peaches were really ripe and juicy) and baked in 9x13 pan. I tripled the topping for the 9x13 pan, and had the perfect amount. The taste was amazing. Thank you for this great recipe!"
"3","5","This was by far the best peach cobbler I have ever had!! I will say that I made the regular 4 serving size and it would actually feed an army!! I also decided that I would try using Splenda's sugar blends, for both the sugar and brown sugar and it came out fantastic, so I felt a little less guilty!! I can't wait to try this with apples instead of peaches!! Two recipes in one."
"3","4","I only had 6 peaches so I added in some blueberries I had, I halved all the sugars in the batter and fruit mixture, it was plenty sweet, very good with vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","Oh my goodness, fresh peaches at their best with this recipe! I made this after Wyattdogster's suggestion and sooo glad I did. I made it as written, only adding a little more cinnamon to the topping. We loved this best, warm, with a scoop of ice cream."
"3","5","Super fast and easy to make.. We used fresh peaches we had canned (poured out most of the juice) & added 2TBLS more Butter and Cornstarch as others suggested. This recipe was FANTASTIC! We will be making this again (maybe even later this week),"
"3","5","very yummy.. my husband loved it.. being my 1st time making peach cobbler it turned out pretty good. being a noob at making it I now know not to drop such large balls of dough.. still turned out good thought"
"3","5","Followed recipe, loved the results. Don't listen to those who say it is too sweet (I used a tad less than the called for amt of sugar mixture on top) - it is not too sweet. Also don't listen to review on the cake like cobbler, this is what I think peach cobbler should be, wasn't that cakey, had a very large fruit layer, fairly thin, crusty cobbler topping. Best time to eat it is of course, while it is still warm from the oven! I used 10 peaches because I had plenty to use and some of mine were sort of small I thought and it turned out great."
"3","5","Served this at our Memorial Day Cookout and my mother-in-law informed me that this was the best peach cobbler she has ever had... and she was very sincere. If it can make my mother-in-law happy... then you KNOW it's good! I quadrupled the recipe and added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the topping and it turned out amazing. It tasted like breaded toffee. We just got a new crop of local peaches (I live in the south) and I figured since tackling the peaches is the hardest part, I would make WAAAAY more than I needed so that my wife and I could enjoy some throughout the upcoming week. Needless to say, the whole thing was gone in about 20 minutes. Luckily, my wife tucked some away for me, or I would have gone without. After 7+ years of family cookouts... I have never received so many compliments for a dish we made. Thank you aeposey for a wonderfully simple, yet delicious recipe!!"
"3","5","Just made this and boy oh boy is it delicious. I used canned peaches and other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Nothing needs to be changed. This is definitely a keeper."
"3","5","This will definitely be my go-to peach cobbler recipe from now on. My husband and I both devoured it! I used seven peaches which were plenty, and used a little less sugar in each part of the mix since the fruit already brings some natural sweetness. I thought the amount of breading was just right, and 30 minutes cooking time is just perfect."
"3","5","Amazing! made the recipe as written, don't usually do that but this one was perfect as is. Kids ate it up! ( I didn't have fresh so I used frozen peaches, also I didn't see the last part of the recipe with the sugar and cinnamon so I didn't use that part, still delish without it)"
"3","5","this peach cobbler is BANGIN!!! the only thing i would do differently is add crust at the bottom. most people feel the best part of a peach cobbler is the crust. (i thought about adding crust at the bottom right away, but decided to follow exactly as instructed) wow!! finally a great peach cobbler recipe that i can tweak. after i made this peach cobbler, i let my friend try, and do you know what she said? you are too young to be able to make a peach cobbler that good! mmm hmm! lol"
"3","5","Love this. I use milk instead of water, add a half teaspoon baking soda to the flour mixture (which I mix in the food processor) and double the lemon juice. A few extra peaches don't hurt, especially if they are small. It also takes me less than 30 minutes in the oven. Wonderful!"
"3","5","This was fantastic! I am not the biggest peach fan, but had some from a farmers basket I had to use up. Only variation to the recipe was only used 6 peaches, but they were humungous. Will definately make again."
"3","5","YUM!"
"3","5","This is the best peach cobbler! This was my first time making peach cobbler and I wanted to make it for my family for Thanksgiving this year. I made this recipe and one other for my husband before Thanksgiving to test it. He absolutely loved it. The real test was my father who was used to my mother's cobbler (which is really good) with strips of dough on the bottom and top. We really love a nice thick crust. Well, this recipe won my father over! He wants the recipe for himself. I did add more peaches and used a combination of canned peaches and frozen peaches because fresh peaches were not in season. I will definitely keep this recipe in my book and will make it every year, I'm sure!"
"3","5","I couldn't get this out of the oven & into my mouth fast enough! It did not disappoint my taste buds! It was FANTASTIC! I had 6 soft, tasteless peaches that I needed to do something with & this recipe was the magic trick! I can hardly imagine how good this will be when I try it with ripe, sweet peaches. This recipe is a keeper & I will be making it again & again & again!"
"3","5","All I have to say is wow this is a fabulous recipe follow it to the letter and you will have a super successful cobbler."
"3","5","This is the best peach cobbler recipe I have ever tasted! Everyone loved it. The only things I did different was to add more peaches, doubled the cornstarch, and used 8 T of butter. I recently went apple picking so made the recipe with apples. It also turned out fantastic. I will be making this for years to come,"
"3","5","My peaches were really tart so I used 1cup brown sugar instead of splitting between the white and brown for the peaches. I also doubled the 'cobbler' portion because my family loves that part so much. The flavor was great! Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
"3","4","Absolutely delicious. I used more than 8 peaches and it still turned out excellent. I loved how the crust was crunchy but also still fluffy and somewhat cake like. Will definitely make again!"
"3","5","Excellent. This is different than any cobbler I've ever had before, but it is really delicious. I used peaches from my brother-in-law's tree and they were all varying in degrees of ripeness, but it worked out perfectly. My husband even really liked this and he is not a big fan of sweets. Thanks :)"
"3","1","The cake topping that everyone is raving about is more biscuit-like, and that's with adding more water than the recipe calls for! The peach part is good, but I won't be repeating this recipe."
"3","5","I have never made peach cobbler before. I thought about cheating and buying frozen peaches but I did not and I am so glad. I made this exactly like it says and it is soooooo good! I kept taking bites saying 'I can't believe I made this!' Thank you for the recipe its so good!"
"3","2","Topping too sweet for me. I much prefer the shortcake type recipe. This one comes out pretty but the topping competes too much with the Yumm of the peaches themselves."
"3","5","5 stars for at least the cobbler part of the recipe. I already had some sugared up peaches so I made a batch of this cobbler to go on top- the bomb. I accidently added the cinnamon to the mixture instead of putting it on top, and I think I liked it that way."
"3","5","Amazing! This recipe is the perfect peach cobbler."
"3","5","Delicious and simple to make."
"3","5","Made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was one of the most amazingly delicious peach cobblers I've every had! We had just went to a local farm and had about 15lbs of peaches - it was just what we needed to use up a bundle :)  This is going into the recipe box for life!"
"3","5","Super easy and very tasty! I followed the advice of several previous reviews and made 1.5 times the topping then wished I hadn't. It was too much and would have been perfect as written. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"3","3","[3.5] I'm a little biased by my mom's recipe, but for whatever reason, that doesn't last–not even overnight; so I thought I'd try another. ///   This was pretty good. Not great. It was a little too sweet, in fact, it kind-of hid the natural sweetness of the peaches that were in season at the time I made this. And the cinnamon/sugar topping was a bit overwhelming (too much) and didn't caramelize as anticipated—so basically there was a bunch of dry sugar/cinnamon perched on top of the dessert (one of my pet-peeves). ///   If I were to make it again, I think I would add less sugar to the peach mixture & make about half of the cinnamon/sugar topping that is sprinkled on top. Better yet, maybe I'll just stick to mom's."
"3","5","So good and so easy! Love it! I followed the recipe exactly (except that I cut it in half) and it makes more than the 4 servings that it states. The only thing I would do would be to increase the amount of the topping dough. It does spread out and fluff up as it bakes, but it didn't cover the peaches entirely. So I think I would use either 1.5 or 2 times the topping, depending on your taste. Very very delicious! Will make again!!"
"3","5","Peach Cobbler- was great!!!! WAYYYYY yummy!"
"3","5","I made this for the first time tonight. I followed the recipe exactly, used 8 fresh (ripe, some very soft/even bruised) peaches from yesterday's local farmers market which I did boil for 60 seconds to get the skins nicely off. I used a 9X13 (3 quart) pan, so when I plopped the dough part on, I felt like it wasn't enough and quickly whipped up a second batch and plopped that on too (didn't add any extra fruit). I think it totally wasn't necessary ultimately but it still tasted AH-MAY-ZING!!! Seriously. I served it with Bryers Natural Vanilla ice cream, my husband was moaning the entire time he ate it. My kids asked for seconds. This will be a staple dessert for my family!"
"3","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I'm not a peach cobbler expert but this was amazing!"
"3","4","Love putting the spices in, tastes great but you do need to double the topping."
"3","5","This was wonderful. I made it just as written minus the nutmeg (I don't care for it). Great way to use peaches!"
"3","5","This is was the best cobbler that I have ever had. The only change that I made was, I cooked the peaches in a saucepot instead of baking them in the oven for 10 minutes."
"3","5","easy with basic staples. Delicious - delivered a serving to a friend down the street and she said it was also delicious! Make and share!"
"3","4","Wonderful cobbler! First I've made!  Note: Do not use whole wheat flour :o)"
"3","4","I almost didn't make this recipe because, well, the photos look kind of ugly.   I made it anyway and it really isn't all that pretty but not as unattractive as some of the pics. The taste is amazing - absolutely delicious. The individual servings are very pretty when you can see the peaches. I served it with vanilla ice cream but it didn't need it.    I followed the recipe exactly except I used turbinado sugar instead of white. It is perfect - not too sweet at all (I don't like sweet stuff nor does my boyfriend who loved this).  I agree with another reviewer that the sugar/cinnamon topping makes it hard to see if it's 'golden brown' - I would make sure to pull it out earlier rather than later if you aren't sure.  And like other reviewers I didn't make the slices too thin - but not too thick either..."
"3","5","This recipe is so delicious. The only thing I did differently was to cook the peaches on the stove top for a few minutes rather than in the pan in the oven, I really don't know if that makes any difference. My husband proclaimed this to be the best peach cobbler he has ever eaten and he reminded me atleast two times to save this recipe. My M-I-L, however, refused to try it after he said how much he loved it, and then he skipped her pie. SCORE. I'll be sure to make this for EVERY family function I possibly can!"
"3","5","Easy and delicious! I made it with blueberries, peaches, & blackberries. I did reduce the sugar since the berries were so sweet and used white whole grain flour. Will be my go to recipe for extra fruit from now on!"
"3","5","I think I died a little when I ate this. It was AMAZING. Next time I might double the peaches mixture or halve the topped. Update: I've made this again and again. Also worth noting is that this can be done in the crock pot. Takes about 3 hours or so. Awesome and I don't have to heat the whole house witht he oven!"
"3","5","I absolutely loved this recipe!!!! I am from Arkansas and currently live in California. Good Peach Cobbler is hard to come by. This recipe was perfectly sweet with the right amount of crust to filling ratio. I made a double batch for a 9x13 and baked it for about 20 minutes. The crust came out perfect any longer baking and it would have been over done. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper for sure!"
"3","5","This cobbler tastes SO good!"
"3","5","Oh my gosh...fabulous. I made it for my employee's birthday and he loved it. Very easy and I didn't even turn my kitchen into a disaster zone like I usually do when I bake. This is definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","Tastes excellent! My only tip would be to not make the globs of dough on the top to big/thick bc otherwise they take too long to cook through, which is what happened to me. They turned out doughy on the inside. I cooked it longer, but then the top was getting overdone. But that was my fault, the recipe itself is great!"
"3","5","Amazing! Thank you for the tip on boiling the peaches for 60 seconds. It worked really well. I want to make again and double the topping. It's so good."
"3","5","everytime I make this its gone before I can even get seconds. I use fresh peaches and I make it as the recipe says didn't make any changes at all other than cooking it in a 9 x 13 pan and it turns out wonderful every time. My family loves this."
"3","4","This was a good recipe although didn't match up to my mom's GA Peach Cobbler...everyone loved it though! Other reviewers were right about the topping not being enough and it was a little 'cake like' so next time I will change that up but I'll definitely use this one again!"
"3","5","Excellent dessert! I doubled the topping like others suggested and it tasted like heaven ! YUM YUM YUM!"
"3","5","Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! All I can say is My husband is the cook in the house, not because I'm selfish, I'm just not that good. But He was going on and on about peachcobbler the other day and I thought since he doesn't bake I'd give it a whirl! This is the best recipe ever. My husband was in love with me ALL Night!!! He was like wow are you kneading dough!!! Even I was surprise at how simple and delicious it was. I let my southern chef co-worker taste it and she was like Girl this is a winner! So I'd like to say Thanks again...I read these directions like I was studying for a midterm and it came out perfect."
"3","5","Great, I melt the butter, its easier and it still comes out great!"
"3","5","My kids LOVED this! I did substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour and dried cane sugar for the white and brown sugar and they did not even notice... thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","4","I used 1 quart of homemade peach pie filling and used the topping in this recipe. Next time I'll put it in a 8x10 baking dish and double the crust. It was very doughy the first time so I'll reduce the oven temp and up the cooking time."
"3","5","This was my first time making a cobbler and I took it to a ladies Bible study.... Like others, I too made extra topping. I left with an empty dish. So simple, soooo gooooood!"
"3","4","Good, but WAY too sweet. For a long pan, you need at least double the crust, and I added some molasses which people really liked. And you don't need to peel the peaches."
"3","5","This was the best cobbler our family ever had. The topping was very good and great texture."
"3","5","What an amazing recipe. I was given a bag of peaches and needed to make something, this hit the spot! I was all out of nutmeg so I did without and it still tasted fantastic."
"3","5","I've now made this three times in 2 weeks! Much easier and lower in fat than pie, and just as good. I added an extra tsp. of corn starch so that the peach part is a bit less runny and more of a pie consistency when it cools. A word of caution - be sure the dish you make this in is big enough so that it's only filled 2/3 or so high. The last time I made this I doubled the recipe and thought I was using a big enough casserole dish, but it bubbled up and created quite a sticky mess on the bottom of my oven."
"3","5","Excellent recipe; it was gone in 20 minutes flat (4 teenage boys!) when served hot with cold ice cream. I agree with previous reviews - DOUBLE the topping (but not the sugar/cinnamon bit at the very bottom), because there's not enough to cover the peaches as it is. And make sure you watch it carefully the last 10 minutes of baking, because it will brown (or blacken!) very quickly with the sugar coating on top. MMMMM!"
"3","5","Very good. Made this recipe with no alterations. Very good stuff. Will be making again...and again...and again!! Thankfully, we have a peach tree in our front yard! Woohoo!"
"3","5","This was really good! I don't always love desserts with fruit but this is very good. I want to bottle the peachy syrup!"
"3","5","Awesome! I added a couple extra tablespoons of butter and I didn't bake it as long as the recipe called for, but it tasted sooo good! My family and I will definately have this again."
"3","5","Made this last night and it turned out perfect! 5 stars for sure!!! So easy to make and simple ingredients! I did the boil/ice water technique to the peaches for easier removal of the skin, but I find it much easier to just use a regular carrot/potato peeler. Next time I will be adding the sugar/cinnamon mixture after it is finished in the oven so it is easier to tell when it is done cooking. Excellent recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!"
"3","5","A few days after making this cobbler, my husband said, 'Last night I think I had a dream about your cobbler.' Needless to say, this is a superb recipe! Give it a try! Just as an aside, I peeled the peaches by putting them in boiling water for a couple minutes. Then the peels slid right off."
"3","5","Just made this and it is FANTASTIC!!! We had to put a little vanilla ice cream on top, and WOW! Thanks so much for sharing!"
"3","5","Oh my goodness, best peach cobbler EVER! My only regret was that there wasnt more. I must double the recipe next time because every one wanted seconds but it was gone with the first serving! And boiling the peaches before hand to peel off skins was an excellent idea, thank you to all those who suggested it."
"3","5","Since i do not eat cobbler, this rating is solely my husband's view. He loves it to death! I used peaches from the garden. Since there are some worms inside, I used more than 8 peaches. I wish there is a measurement such as how many cups of cut peaches. Also, I have cut down the white sugar mix on the last step to 1 tablespoon as I was doubting the white sugar will melt completely in the oven at the end. As i thought, it didn't melt."
"3","5","Yum! I've never made cobbler before since I'm more of a pie person, but - after much pleading from my husband - I finally made this using peaches from our farmer's market. I don't think I've ever had a better cobbler. None of that sickeningly sweet cake mix . . . this is really, really, good."
"3","4","This was a delicious recipe and I made it as the directions stated with one exception. I sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture on 1/2 way through the baking time b/c I was afraid it would burn. I'm glad I did b/c it came out very dark after only a short time in the oven. Overall, delicious flavors and I like the cake-like topping!"
"3","5","Best peach cobbler I've ever made! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9X11 pan."
"3","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I made this for the first time yesterday and I am making another batch as we speak! Peaches were on sale for .69/lb so I got plenty! The recipe is perfect as is. Note that if you use a 2 qt dish as noted in the recipe, you have just the right amount of topping. I have to say that the topping is fantastic! Yum!!! This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","Just what I wanted for a cobbler! I didn't have nearly enough peaches so I used apricots and blueberries to fill it up. The toppping on this cobbler is so good, even though I cooked it a bit, I loved it. A new favorite, perfection!"
"3","5","I am in LOVE with this recipe. So is everybody I make it for. My only change is that l did 1.5x the topping (because I like a lot of topping). Fresh peaches are best; Vanilla bean ice cream is best! I can't wait for peach season...."
"3","5","The easiest peach cobbler ever. Made it for Easter because my uncle loves anything made with peaches. He loved it! Said, it was the best he'd ever tasted."
"3","5","I was born and raised in the deep south and big crust on cobblers is what it is all about. This recipe did a fine job of catching the essence of the southern peach cobbler. However, the grocery store did not have fresh peaches :( , so I had to use can peaches. It equates to about 4 cans(drain them really good). It was delicious and on par with what you would find in any mom and pop diner in the deep south. I can only imagine the fresh peaches."
"3","5","I used 5 cups canned peaches (drained). The results were great!!! I placed the batter in a ziploc bag and drizzled it over the top. My topping was not the least bit doughy. And it did not get overly brown. It looked beautiful and tasted GREAT!!! I actually used a tin lasagna pan so it was thinner than it would be in a 9x13. I wanted to not have a problem with bubbling over and didn't. Yeah...what a sweet treat!"
"3","5","Delicious! I should have baked it in a 9X13 however as it bubbled over into the bottom of my oven (a pain to clean!). But as for the cobbler itself...delicious and quite a hit. I was hoping it'd last more than just 1 night (as I was hoping to treat myself for breakfast with a hot treat!)...it didn't last 30 minutes after being initially served! So if you're looking for that perfect guest pleasing treat...this is it! Just expect it to be *Poof* gobbled up and gone before your eyes :)!!"
"3","5","Great cobbler. I didn't have any fresh peaches (good ones are almost impossible to get in the islands) so I used frozen peaches. Other than forgetting the lemon juice I followed the recipe as written. Then only thing I'll do different next time is go about another 5 minutes on the bake. Mine was a bit dough in the middle. Sure didn't stop people from eating it though!! LOL"
"3","5","Yummy!!! Delectable!! I have made this twice now. The first time with peaches and this morning with apples. I was in a hurry this morning so I didn't look at the 'most helpful' reviews so I forgot that I made more crust the first time. If you like a lot of crust I do recommend that you make 1 and a half times the ingredients for the topping. Also I remember when I made it with the peaches I used frozen ones and I didn't bake the peaches first because of the cooks here commenting on the peaches getting mushy. With apples you don't have to worry about that. Also watch your time if you use the amount of crust that the recipe calls for. It was done much sooner this time. As I remember the crust took longer to bake and you need to check it with a toothpick because of the cinnamon-sugar topping it looks done before it really is. Nothing is every too sweet for anyone in this house. Sugarholics all of us."
"3","4","I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. This was delicious but really too sweet and I only put 1/3 of the cinnamon sugar topping on. I cut the butter down to 4tbsp and that was great, I would cut down on the sugar added to the fruit and leave off the cinnamon topping so it's less sweet but overall, divine!"
"3","5","Wow! After looking for a cobbler recipe for weeks, this one is a keeper. Very good, and like the cobblers from my childhood. The only thing I added was a 1/3 cup of chopped peacans to the peach mixture. Amazing!"
"3","4","I just made this and I just wish it had more topping so I will double next time and since we used fresh peaches it produced A LOT of juice. Next time I will add more corn startch wich should make sure it's less juicy and more syrupy thick!"
"3","5","Yummy! I've made this twice now- the first time almost to a 't' and then the second time I made the following changes: I increased the dough by half, and waited till 5 mins before taking it out of the oven to put the cinnamon sugar on- this way and doesn't burn/brown. I will make this one over and over again! Thanks!"
"3","5","oh my god, we ate the whole blessid thing last night. I served it with homemade icecream."
"3","5","I made this when I was at my son's house as a dessert for dinner. It was a hit! I altered the recipe totally by accident but it was wonderful and I will continue to make it this way. I used a bag of frozen peaches and elimanated the water completely. The flour/sugar/butter mixture was sprinkled on top of the cooked peach mixture and returned to the oven for 20 minutes. It came out splendid. It had it all...crunch, sweet, and cooey. Everyone liked it so much they requested I make it again the next day. Thanks for the recipe."
"3","5","I doubled the recipe and used canned peaches. It was a little runnier than I wanted, but it was still amazing."
"3","3","This recipe did taste good but coming from someone that has eatten peach cobbler from the south all the way to the west this peach cobbler does not taste like real southern peach cobbler. However it is a good taste and I'd have to agree with the other reviews the crust on this is a bit like a giant cookie. It is hard to tell if its done because of the sugar and cinnamon that you sprinkle on top. great recipe though. my kids liked it and my husband to but like i said I'd call my self a number one fan of peach cobbler and this does not taste as good as the real stuff."
"3","5","I've been making this for a few years now, and it's hands-down the best peach cobbler I've ever had."
"3","5","I got the greatest compliment that I have ever had on this cobbler. My husband said, 'This is the best cobbler I have ever tasted!' Will I make this again.....you better believe it!"
"3","5","We live in 'pick your own' country and this recipe is the best. I have found it to be more successfull if the peaches are left in larger pieces or chunks"
"3","4","This is wonderful! However, it does need more topping, I just doubled it. And I added a little extra water. With those adjustments I'd give it 5 stars!"
"3","5","My goofy husband didn't like peach cobbler and then he had this...let's just say he now loves peach cobbler."
"3","5","Best cobbler ever! The crust is perfect, not too crispy, not too chewy. I've used this recipe several times before, with several different fruits... apples, spiced pears, even strawberries... A hit every time!"
"3","5","5 stars because it was easy and great tasting. I dropped my peaches in boiling water for a quick minute to make them easy to peel. I used splenda instead of sugar."
"3","5","I baked this peach cobbler yesterday for a dessert for lunch and it was delicious. It came out perfectly. The only thing I would say is that it is MUCH more than 4 servings, more like TEN! I served it with homemade cream (heavy cream and confectioners sugar). I also made slight moderations. I used SPLENDA instead of the sugar (except for the sugar cinnamon topping--I used real sugar for that). I also didn't have any cornstarch so I threw in a couple of spoons of confectioners sugar to thicken it and that worked fine. Overall I cut the calories on this with the SPLENDA but you sure couldn't tell! It also seemed to work fine in glazing the peaches and in the crust."
"3","4","This was quite good. I followed the recipe as stated. The only thing with this was that we much prefered the taste of it when it was cold as opposed to warm from the oven. Served with good vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","It was wonderful! Everyone raved about it! I used fresh over-ripe peaches, which i believe made it even better! It would probably be better with more topping as others suggested. For those who said its not juicy must not be using good peaches. It was just right for me. I dont think i would change a thing except maybe double the topping. Thx!"
"3","5","Very very good espically warm with vanilla ice cream. Watch your cooking time because the cinnamon and sugar on top will brown quick."
"3","5","This is a great recipe! Works well in a crockpot. 3-4 hours on high. Like others have said, increase the topping. It is too good to skimp!"
"3","5","This is a great recipe , do not change a thing before you try it just as is . Its got the right amount of ingredients and its wonderful in taste , i also did one with apples since i'm an apple man and loved it ( 4 Granny Smith ) i also experimented with Crisco and it came out ok but butter is better in my opinion . So enjoy yourself and since i could not give this any more stars i can tell tell you its a 10 on taste and how easy it is to make . Fantastic"
"3","5","Followed the recipe to a T and it came out wonderfully! Brought to a dinner and got great compliments. Served with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe."
"3","5","I made this for my husband and 3 of his friends, and they ate the whole 9x13 pan of it!! It was really good. I followed the recipe except made one and a half times the crust recipe and substituted half wheat flour for white flour. I'll definitely make it again if I have peaches."
"3","5","Wonderful, easy and quick. Suggestions: Double the amount of topping. Increase cornstarch to 2tbl. Mix the peaches right in the pan you will bake it in. No need to dirty an additional bowl. Also chunk the peaches for more peach bite."
"3","5","Excellent Recipe! OMG!   Followed the directions with a couple of exceptions mentioned here in the reveiws.  1.Fresh peaches are the best. I used 6-7 medium to small sized peaches.  2. I sprinkled the peeled peaches with vanilla.  3. I used about 2/3 of the sugar cinnamon mixture.(There was plenty)  4. I decreased cooking time to 25 mins.  5. I used a 1.5 quart baking dish  it was the perfect size.  This is worth making It's fabulous!  Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","Quite good and flexible. I doubled it for a 9X13, and used a combination of dubious fresh (some green!) peaches and one small can of peach slices (with the juice, since I was worried about the sweetness of the fresh peaches). It was more cinnamon than I thought necessary - if I double it again, I would not double the cinnamon."
"3","5","I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't put cinnamon in the topping, but put it into the 'cobbler' mixture. This was unbelievably good, better than my mom's. I couldn't believe it. You have to try this recipe even if you have a cobbler recipe. You will not be disappointed!"
"3","5","This peach cobbler was awesome! Made it exactly as the recipe states and it turned out great! Will make again!"
"3","5","This was delicious, except for the lemon juice..too much for my liking...and I baked it too long...the topping was too brown. The hint about putting the peaches in boiling water was WONDERFUL..it was so much easier to peel."
"3","5","Exactly what I wanted to taste and easy too. Crunchy on top, soft cake underneath. Found a bag of peaches from last summer in the freezer - exactly 8 cups sliced. Defrosted and drained excess juice. Perfect amount of fruit for this recipe."
"3","5","This was very yummy! I used frozen peaches, just thawed them out before using. At first I thought that the sugar/cinnamon topping was too much but I put on what was in the recipe anyway.. it came out very good! It makes the top get all crispy, crunchy.. good stuff!"
"3","5","I used canned peaches, (2 24 oz.jars Del Monte Orchard Select) My kids were visiting, and this disappeared in about 5 minutes, we all gave it five stars! This will replace our old favorite. Thank you"
"3","4","I liked this recipe very much, except the topping over the crust. I thought it made the entire recipe too sweet, with too strong of cinnamon flavor. The next tiem I make it, I will simply sprinkle a smaller amount of cinnamon, perhpas mixed with nutmeg over the top for the colour contrast."
"3","5","We loved this and have made this a couple of times. Tastes great with frozen peaches, or once we didn't have enough peaches so substituted nectarines and apricots. Still amazing. Give this a try, you'll not be dissappointed."
"3","5","This recipe was FABULOUS!! I used canned peaches instead and I doubled the crust after realizing what I had wouldn't cover the dish, and I'm glad I did....it was just YUMMY! Don't change a thing!! This is definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","Used Ontario fresh peaches to make this wonderful cobbler. Will definitely make again and again."
"3","4","Pretty good. I don't know if my peaches were too juicy or what. Maybe the cornstarch is supposed to be 2 Tablespoons. Mine was runny and using a 2 Qt. Corning dish, ran all over the oven - had to put foil below it while baking. Might try again in a 9 x 13 dish and will double the crust recipe (the crust is good - crispier than other cobblers I've made). And will probably add more cornstarch or some oatmeal to thicken itmore."
"3","5","This was great! I used frozen peaches and did not have a problem. Next time I would like to integrate rum for a new flavor ~ maybe Southern Comfort! But this recipe is good the way it is made. One suggestion would be to not make the batter too thick on top because it will not be crisp and will take longer to bake."
"3","5","If this isn't a true 'southern peach cobbler' I don't know what is. It's awesome. THANKS to the reviewer who saved me LOTS of time (I quadrupled the recipe both times I made it) with her tip on dipping the peaches in boiling water for a minute, then plunging into cold...the peelings really do slip right off and there's no peach flesh wasted."
"3","5","this cobbler was absolutely fantastic...of course i love cinnamon and added just about 1/4 tsp more to each part of the recipe than what it asked....the top of my cobbler did start to turn a little TO brown before the rest of it was cooked through so i had to cover it with tin foil to stop it from browning anymore than it already had...i would check the cobbler at 20 minutes if you are baking at the temperature that the recipe asks, but the next timei prepare it i will be baking it at 375'F and hopefully wont have to cover it during half my baking time."
"3","5","This was excellent..I had some frozen Peaches from this summer and didn't really know exactlly how many to use but it doesn't really matter as long as you don't get carried away. I used the recipe as is and it couldn't have been better.Every one really enjoyed it and I had fun making it.Thanks Amy for sharing."
"3","4","Great easy recipe. Next time I will double the crust topping portion, it's the best part. I used 3 bags of frozen peaches and it still tasted amazing. No one knew they weren't fresh, don't use canned ones though! I did add some flour per other reviewers and it wasn't runny at all."
"3","5","This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I doubled the topping because we like a lot of it. Everything else was perfect."
"3","5","I really liked this recipe. It was very easy. I read the reviews. It said if you are using salted butter and it called for unsalted butter to cut back the salt from 1/2 tsp. to 1/4 tsp. I did that. It tasted wonderful My family wants me to make this again. It is a keeper!! I will file away in my cookbook!!"
"3","3","Mine turned out way too soggy :("
"3","5","Really enjoyed this recipe-- much easier than I expected! I loved the cobbler topping but my peaches weren't that flavorful. Probably because I had to settle for California peaches (there were no fresh Georgia peaches to be found) but regardless, next time I will use a little more sugar. All in all, a surprisingly fresh and light dish and a perfect way to end a summer meal."
"3","5","This was delish! I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and the next day it was perfect! Warmed it just a tad in the microwave and found heaven in a bowl!"
"3","5","I loved this!"
"3","5","AWESOME!!!! I have found the ultimate comfort food!! If you can freeze your fresh sliced peaches this recipe is the key for comfort food for the winter time!! I just had some straight from the oven and WOW! Thanks Amy!! Five plus stars all around!!"
"3","5","RAVE: So quick & easy, yet everyone will admire your baking skills! Versatile too - any kind of fresh or frozen fruit - especially berries! - will work (add water to the fruit before baking it, if necessary, to get the same consistency as peaches). Tips: 1) Before putting back in the oven, I brush the dough with milk and sprinkle it with sugar for a thin pastry-style crust. 2) Great of course served with ice cream or whipped cream - but plain heavy cream is perhaps the most decadent of all! Thanks, Amy, for a fantastic recipe that will always be near the front of my box!"
"3","5","This recipe is definitely great! I had tried to make a peach crisp out of an apple crisp recipe, to which my husband gave a 'thumbs down.' But he loved this! I brought it to a potluck and it was gone before I could even have seconds. I used 4 tsp cornstarch like some recommended. Thanks for the idea about how to peel the peaches easily - it made the recipe go really quickly. The only thing I wish was clearer was exactly what volume of peaches to use - eight large peaches produce a substantially larger amount of peaches than eight small peaches! I had to guess and use about 7 large peaches. I guess it doesn't really matter, though. Thanks for this absolutely delicious recipe! It will be part of my permanent collection!"
"3","5","I love this recipe! Can't believe I was able to make something quite this good. It was different than other cobblers I've made....the topping was more of a biscuit texture. Thanks for sharing this recipe!  No offense to 'ConnoisseurMan', but I think the previous reviewer must have done something wrong!! I can't imagine anyone not loving this and there was absolutely nothing bitter about it."
"3","5","This is a true gem. I didn't bother to peel the peaches, making this a snappy dish to put together. My only problem is the serving size, this should easily serve 8."
"3","5","It was so good I couldn't quite believe I had made it!!! Thanks so much for posting this  wonderful recipe. I did use tree ripened peaches for the cobbler. Can't wait to make it again."
"2","5","I ran accross this recipe a few years ago. I love it. It always gets devoured at church. I cant make it too often for home because I will be the one who ends up eating it all. The recipe is fine as written. most of the time, I dont have lemon juice on hand so I just go without. More Sugar, Less Sugar ... fresh peaches, canned peaches, frozen peaches, 2qt dish, 9x13 dish ... whatever. it's pretty darn good if u ask me. ? Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
"2","5","Hands down the best peach cobbler since the ones my momma used to make! I inadvertently made a few changes though, which may or may not have led to its awesomeness :). The first change (actually a mistake) that I made was using 1.5 cups of all purpose flour. I had meant to increase the dry cobbler ingredients by 50%, but halfway through I forgot and only increased the flour (I have young children and their constant energy affects me ok!). The second change (mistake) I made was I forgot to add 1/4 cup of water to the dry ingredients. I just spread the four/sugar/baking powder/salt/butter combo right on top of the peach ingredients. After I put all this in the oven, I realized my mistake, so I pulled it out and drizzled @ 1/2 cup of tap water on top of the dry ingredients. After @ 30 min in my oven I could tell this was going to be good. Some of the sugar carmelized on the sides of the pan...the cobbler topping wasn't too soft or cakey...nice and sweet with the tiniest bit of crunch. Of course we ate ours with vanilla ice cream, which made it even better, but by itself this cobbler is awesome. I think I'll keep my changes next time only because it turns out so yummy...but probably as written it'd be 5 stars also."
"2","5","I've used this recipe twice and it is wonderful and easy. I used a bit less sugar since we usually eat it with ice cream. I peeled the peaches by cutting an X in bottom of each, then dropping into boiling water for less than a minute. This is followed by an ice water bath to stop the cooking; then pulling off the peel is easy. Be sure the peaches are not overripe but yield to a slight pressure. Can use for other fruits but I LOVE southern peaches when in season!"
"2","4","I made this twice this weekend. The first time, I followed it exactly. Way too sweet for us. So I suggest slowly adding the sugar based on the sweetness of your peaches. Mine were also very large, as 8 peaches filled my 2qt dish to the rim!! So, the next day I used 7 peaches, eliminated the white sugar from the peach mixture, added a bit more of the spices, and also doubled the cornstarch, as my peaches had a lot of juice. Then, I placed them in a larger dish, and doubled the topping, to cover the entire dish. TIP: the less you stir the dough, the fluffier it will be! Then form the sugar/cinnamon topping, I used just a small sprinkling to lightly dust the top. The amount called for is too much cinnamon, and way too much for my taste :) this time it turned out fabulous!!!! :)"
"2","5","Very good. I halved the amount of peaches. (Or double the biscuit topping). I did make adjustments. 1) I also used only 3/4 cup of flour, and added 1/3 cup of oat flour. I always have some on hand. I just pulse oats in my food processor and keep in my pantry."
"2","5","Last year, I wanted to make a peach cobbler and of course I went to all recipes .com, and came across this fantastic recipe, that I have share with many friends and family, they all rave about how delicious it is and this year since is peach season again I'm about to start making this marvelous recipe."
"2","5","I've made this about 5 times and LOVE IT. Beat recipe I've tried. I have switched up the recipe and used nectarines instead or white peaches/nectarines and as long as I kept the amount of fruit the same- it turned out great with all of them!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe to the tea the only thing I did different was use milk instead of water . My husband response was oh wow. My husband favorite dish. I am diffinetly making this is again."
"2","5","Easy and so good! I followed it exactly and it turned out yummy!"
"2","5","This a good recipe I recommend reducing the sugar and brown sugar in the recipe by 1/2 of what the recipe calls for"
"2","5","This recipe is amazing! I have had many requests to make it since. I used frozen peaches and it was delicious. I did have to bake it longer so now I bake it for 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. It comes out of the oven perfectly done. For my taste I added 1t. Cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","Very good recipe! Very forgiving. I was hurrying to get some dessert ready and made an error by putting a tsp of baking powder in peaches (oops!). I also did not have butter so substituted coconut oil. I cut back on the sugar as the peaches were very sweet. Delicious!"
"2","5","My husband is Southern born and I am Northern born. I have mastered a lot of southern dishes except for Peach cobbler. I found this recipe and made a few changes and he loved it! I used frozen peaches (slightly thawed)and since I used them I increased the cornstarch to 1 1/2 tablespoons. I also added a scant 1/2 teaspoon of almond flavoring. The 'biscuit dumplings' were the best, although I did not add the cinnamon to the sugar for the topping. WILL DEFINITELY keep this recipe handy."
"2","5","This cobbler is delicious! And very easy to make."
"2","4","I tried this recipe with canned peaches, and it worked out pretty well, but I think the next time I will drained the peaches. The biscuit crust was very good. Will try it again. Thank you for sharing the recipe."
"2","2","I feel this recipe is good however the pastry topping yield is WAY too small for the amount of peaches called for. As prepared it was spiced peaches with a bit of crumb, not at all the ratio I like or expect from a peach cobbler. You could use this base but I'd double or triple the topping."
"2","5","This recipe reminded me of my Georgian grandma's .. so yummy! the only changes I made was to add more cornstarch (I used fresh peaches that were WAY juicy) and doubled the spices. I can't wait to make it again and again!"
"2","5","Great recipe. Very easy to make. The cooking time and temperature of oven I have to master because it can look done and it isn't."
"2","5","Better than pie! I use this recipe for peaches, apples, pears, eis. It's the best!"
"2","5","Delicious!"
"2","4","Next time i will put less nutmeg or no at all for me its to strong but this recipe its amazing!!!"
"2","5","To die for!"
"2","5","Amazing"
"2","5","The BEST ever!!..if made with Calif. peaches. Georgia peaches are hard to find and when you do..they are small! The big peaches you do find in the stores in Georgia are from California. So much for the Peach State. I just had to say...."
"2","4","Follow the above directions! It is delicious!"
"2","4","Bit sweet I would recommend reducing the amount of sugar in the fruit."
"2","5","This is one the the best I've tried. Will definately keep this recipe handy."
"2","5","This is a delicious recipe! Everything a peach cobbler should be and more.. Personally i wouldnt change anything about it. Everyone loved it. Thank you!"
"2","4","This was good, but it would be just as good if not better with half the sugar the recipe calls for. Make sure to put a cookie sheet under the dish while baking also, as it runs over."
"2","5","Buttery, tasty, easy and quick to make. Highly recommended!"
"2","5","Delicious recipe! My husband raved about it to his friends since they go to a local diner just for their peach cobbler. Turns out that diner uses canned and it just doesn't compare to this. I didn't change a thing except after the first time I doubled the topping because it is so yummy, I wanted a little more than the recipe asked for. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! It made a mess bubbling over the sides of my 8x8 2 quart baking dish, but it was so worth it. I was worried all the sugar and spices would hide the natural peach flavor, but that was not the case. This peach cobbler turned out great!"
"2","5","Wonderful recipe, with a very delicate and delicious topping. It is best with really juicy, fresh peaches."
"2","5","Wonderful cobbler recipe. I altered the topping some, similar to judih's note above. This is for a double recipe, fits in a large lasagna pan (deeper than 9X13). Double the recipe, using about 12 to 16 peaches, depending upon size. For the topping: 2 cups flour, 1 1/2 c. white sugar, about 1/3-1/2 c. brown sugar, 2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp salt, 3/4 c. butter, cut and blended together with dry ingredients using a pastry blender. Omit the boiling water. Add about 1 1/2 c. milk (start with smaller amount, work up), blend together until batter is smooth and thick, like cake batter. Pour over top of baked peaches (spiced as for double recipe, peaches baked 10 min as original recipe). Top all with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Bake approx 30 minutes. This makes a fluffy, soft topping with a crunchy top layer. The juices come up through the cracks, but the peaches are still very juicy, not dried out. Wonderful for a large family or guests. My church social raved."
"2","4","Finally, a cobbler that I didn't end up throwing away after baking. However, I did make some changes after reading some reviews. First I used canned peaches, 1 large and 1 small, drained/liquid saved. And I only used about 1/8 cup of sugar in the peaches. For the topping, instead of water, I used the saved liquid from the canned peaches. For the cinnamon/sugar mix,I used only about 3/4 of it. the whole thing just seemed to be too much, and after tasting the cobbler, 3/4 of it was just plenty. However, it does come out burnt looking. Maybe next time (because I will definitely make this again) will sprinkle on during the last 10 mins of baking, so it won't be so dark looking."
"2","4","Made this yesterday for our supper club. I increased recipe to 12 servings. I used a large aluminum pan for easy transport. I also used frozen peaches...so much easier than peeling 24 peaches . I defrosted peaches in morning, after defrosting added the sugars and let stand on counter ready to cook. I made the topping and placed in refrigerator to keep cool. Frozen peaches were delicious, they held their shape. The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 c each. Tasted to sweet to me. When making the topping, the increase to 3 cups flour was perfect for 12 servings. Men and women loved the dessert, served with ice cream. Will definitely made this again.  I baked it during main entree so that by time we were ready for dessert , it was still warm."
"2","5","BEST PEACH COBBLER EVER!!!"
"2","5","I love this recipe. I did try a 'no additional sugar' version where I used Splenda sugar & Splenda brown sugar. Conversion is 2 tbsp. each of the Splenda sugars for the 1/4 c. sugars. I also did 2 rounded tsp. of corn starch, a little more than recipe calls for, and used frozen peach slices verses fresh peaches. My husband is a diabetic and he loves peach cobbler so I thought I would try it out. It came out so good! You couldn't tell this was made with Splenda, in my opinion, the frozen peaches worked perfectly and I also topped it with sliced almonds which gave it a little crunch. Now I have two ways to make this recipe."
"2","5","Since I was snow bound this afternoon, I made this recipe...with a couple differences...my peaches were frozen, fresh from the orchard last fall...I thawed them, drained off the juice.. The only real difference I made was that instead of water in the topping I used the same amount of juice from the frozen fruit....also doubled up on the topping recipe...it smelled sssssoooo good while it was baking and tasted even better for dessert.... GREAT recipe."
"2","5","I love this recipe!! Instead of the extra sugar and spice on top I leave it be!! Delicious with Ice Cream or Whipped topping!! :D"
"2","4","Excellent recipe but I made more topping because my guest loved it. I also snuck a taste of vanilla in also. Overall a great cobbler"
"2","5","Oh...my...goodness!!! The absolute best peach cobbler I have ever tasted. Hands down."
"2","5","Delicious. Served this decadent dessert with homemade vanilla ice cream while it was still warm. Brought me right back to childhood. I'd submit a picture, but it got eaten too quick! Life is good."
"2","5","We just tok the kids to the orchard to pick peaches. Decided to make a cobbler at husband's request and found this recipe. The ONLY addition was a tablespoon of honey that I added to the peach filling, otherwise, I made it exactly as stated and it came out great! I have no idea why someone said it was too dry. Ours was very juicy with some to spare. Maybe use very ripe peaches? Husband went back for seconds and thirds! Awesome recipe!"
"2","5","This was delicious. A few modifications - I used 4 teaspoons cornstarch and used splenda and brown sugar splenda. In this recipe I couldn't taste a difference to regular sugar. I read about people boiling/cooling the peaches to remove the skin. If you have a good peeler it comes off easily and much quicker than that process. Peeling worked for both very ripe and more firm peaches. I'd make it again for sure and would also consider using other fruits."
"2","5","Made this after a recent visit to a peach farm, this cobbler was fantastic! Perfectly sweet and peachy. Used the exact recipe posted, wouldn't change a thing."
"2","5","Very excellent recipe. Compliments and rave reviews all around. I tip: you can blanch peaches and slide skin off just like tomatoes. Drop peaches (whole) into boiling water for few 1-2 mins. depending on type. Remove from hot water and drop into cold water. cool and slide skin off. Thank you so much for recipe."
"2","1","Oh wow what a waste of peaches, thank goodness I live in the Okanagan in British Columbia, I have way more than I like right now. But still a waste of ingredients. Hubby loves anything dessert, he said don't keep this recipe. That won't be a problem."
"2","5","Excellent"
"2","5","delicious and very easy to put together with items from the kitchen. Excellent warm from the oven or at room temperature.Topping just can't be beat. Would be delicious with any type of fresh fruit. Thanks so much for sharing."
"2","5","This was phenomenal! I made an extra 1/2 batch of batter and so glad I did! The bad part - No left overs!!"
"2","5","My husband and I thought this recipe was awesome! I read peoples comments and made a few changes. I cut back on the sugar a lot in the filling and breading to personal taste adding more corn starch, cinnamon plus almond extract but sprinkled the very top with full about of sugar and cinnamon. Made sure I used a 2 quart pan. Used salted butter so I cut salt to 1/4 tsp. Didn't have a lemon so added fresh picked raspberries for tang and added color. Tried both soda and baking powder cause someone suggested it. It was done in my oven in 20 minutes. It was perfect hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. As far as the crust I spread it out evenly and with the topping of sugar and cinnamon it was perfect. Boil the fresh peaches 30 to 40 second than cool under running cold water to remove the skin."
"2","4","This was really yummy! I agree with other reviewers that it needed a whole lot more topping. Next time I will add at least 50% more. I also added blueberries, which was DELICIOUS! I added about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries after the peaches had baked for 10 minutes and then I put on the cobbler topping. They provided a nice tang (and beautiful color) that balanced out the sweetness of the peaches.  I had my cobbler in for about 23 minutes and checked on it and it had already started to burn. Will definitely keep a closer eye on it next time."
"2","5","This was a very delicious peach cobbler. I had never made anything like this before. Crisps yes but not this. The biscuit topper was amazing, I did bake for 30 minutes as indicated, but next time 23-25 minutes might be better. The sugar caramilized with the cinnamon was quite nice. My husband and I decided we liked it better than peach pie. And I make a killer peach pie."
"2","4","Made with peaches which were a little over-ripe, this recipe came out a bit too juicy. But that's not the recipe's fault."
"2","5","This recipe does not need another great review; however, we also think this is exceedingly yummy. Our biscuits are not sweet and do not come out with caramelized sugar cooked through and through them, as this topping does. We did increase the flour mixture by 1/2, but not sure it needed to be done that way though it made for a plentiful top crust. Thanks for sharing this relatively easy and delicious way to eat summer peaches!"
"2","5","This is a good recipe. Family loved it. I read the other reviews before I attempted it, so here's my two cents: 1- if you use a 2 qt baking dish like you're supposed to you won't need to add more dough, and 2- if you take a shortcut and try to use canned peaches, its probably going to be too sweet. The fresh peaches gave it the right amount a tartness without being too sweet. I cut my peaches thicker as suggested by others and I spread the dough a little (or use smaller drops closer together) to avoid the 'biscuit' effect. The only I'm doing different next time is cutting back (probably by half because I had plenty left over after totally covering the top) the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top because it's hard to tell if it's browned."
"2","5","Made this over the 4th of July weekend when unexpected company stopped in for a visit, and it was fabulous! I have made many cobblers in my day, but never one that added baking powder and boiling water to the topping...The result was a cake like topping! I made the recipe even easier by not peeling the peaches, just sliced them as I buy organic. I will definitely keep this in my favorites!"
"2","4","It would have been perfect if the oven wasn't so hot. 425 is too hot, I knew better but went with 425 anyway, it came out too dark. Next time I'll bake it at 350, with a little less nutmeg."
"2","4","This is a wonderful base recipe. I did not give the full five stars because I made a few adjustments. The first adjustment I made was to double the amount of fruit, just because that is what I had on hand and did not want it to spoil. The second adjustment was to correspondingly increase the amount of sugar to go with the increase in fruit. Please note that I did NOT increase the amount of cornstarch. The third adjustment I made was to double the topping - as it tends to be my favorite part of the dessert. Instead of mixing the topping with boiling water, I just melted the butter. I know this goes against everything you've ever believed but it works out just fine. Finally, I shortened the cooking time to around 20 minutes. This kept the cobbler wetter rather than allowing it to set up like cake - a problem other reviewers mentioned. Turns out really well with these adjustments! I've made with strawberries as well as peaches. Everyone comes back for seconds and thirds!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! Printing it now to add to my recipe binder. This will now be my go to peach cobbler recipe. :-D"
"2","5","This was the best cobbler that I have had in a long time. Myself and my husband are not huge dessert eaters but I made this for a family dinner and it not only got eaten but we helped clean the dish. It has an amazing taste and I have made this with both fresh and frozen peaches, both are great but nothing really beats fresh. The only thing I would change is to add more biscuit topping, the amount made from recipe didnt cover the cobbler and that was one of the favorite parts of the dish. All in all, it is AMAZING!"
"2","5","I made this for Thanksgiving. I like a lot of topping, so I doubled that part. Since peaches aren't in season, I used frozen peach slices. I let them thaw about 3/4 of the way, thinking that if they thawed completely before baking, they'd be mushy by the time the cobbler was done. I also baked it in a 9x13' dish. Contrary to a previous poster, my topping completely covered the peaches and I had no spots of 'doughy' or underdone topping - it baked completely through all over. Will be making again in a few days for Christmas!"
"2","5","My aunts a Chef and everybody always raves over her cooking during the holiday meals!!! So to make this and have her ask for the recipe and everybody rave over this, I was excited and knew this was the best recipe for peach cobbler I've tried!!! I've made peach cobbler so many times before but this was so easy and abolutely delicious!! I added the 8tbsp of butter, a pinch more cinnimon, and an extra tsp of cornstarch and cooked it about 20-25mins. Ive made this now about 2yrs now and its always a highlight dessert!!! Its great for all seasons! LOVE IT!"
"2","5","This was wonderful! After reading reviews and because my peaches were pretty sweet to start with, I halved both white and brown sugars in the peaches and in the batter. The result was perfect!"
"2","5","I've never found a cobbler recipe I like, but after making this, my search has ended! I didn't change a thing and after eating it, I don't recommend you do either. The topping is the perfect level of not too sweet, and textures vary from crispy to chewy...yum! The peach mixture was also perfection. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","I made this last weekend. It was the best cobbler I've ever had or made. I used fresh nutmeg, which I think makes it so good. A really great recipe - and I didn't make any changes - but next time I'll add another peach or two."
"2","4","Made this a couple of times. Used the original recipe the first time and it was delicious but the fillling didn't thicken enough for my taste and there wasn't enough crust. *NOTE: I now use 10 peaches, cut the peaches into thicker wedges and use 1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch in the filling. I use 8 Tbsp butter instead of 6 for the crust. I increase all the the crust ingredients by 50% for 9x13 pan (ex. 12 Tbsp butter for 1 1/2 recipes of crust). SUPER delicious."
"2","5","This is my favorite peach cobbler recipe! We have a peach tree and I have tried several different recipes, but this is definitely our favorite. I love that the topping does not get mushy like some others that put the batter in the bottom of the peaches. Great recipe!!"
"2","5","Great recipe! The fruit filling is pretty sweet, I scaled back a bit on the sugar. I also covered the dish with a loose piece of aluminum foil for the first 10min of baking and then took it off for the rest of the time. The topping was just starting to brown at 30min. Delicious!"
"2","5","Thanks for a wonderful and delicious recipe!!! The only change that I made was to use Truvia for baking instead of the white sugar as another reviewer suggested to cut down on the calories."
"2","5","I made this last night....and OMG it was delicious! It was surprisingly easy to make. I followed the directions and it came out perfect. Will be making this again!!"
"2","5","Despite my five stars I made a few small adjustments, but this recipe is fabulous and I found it in the heart of peach season! I used a good veggie peeler to peel the peaches, cut the slices a bit thicker and added more peaches (3) I kept the peach seasonings the same, adding 2 pinches of cardamom which marries well with peach. I made 1-and-a-half times the topping so the dish would not disappear so fast and it allowed peaches to peek out around the dollops of topping. I used my cinnamon-sugar shaker to lightly shake over the dough, (less sugar and cinnamon by half I would guess) and suggest watching it closely while in the oven so the topping doesn't get too brown. I will use this with other fruit in season! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!"
"2","5","The best peach cobbler ever made! Super tasty and the crust was cake-like which is just what I was looking for. I used canned peaches instead of fresh: 1 can no sugar added and 1 can in light syrup. Because of this, I slightly decreased the amount of white sugar in the peach mixture. I also added more cinnamon because I love it!"
"2","5","Made recipe as written and it was fantastic! Cobbler tastes vary, and this one is easy and delicious."
"2","3","I made this recipe 4 times. The first 2 times it was phenominal except for the topping being overcooked. The last 2 times I made it I tried cutting down the baking time of the topping by 5 minutes and it didn't bake all the way through. I may try lowering the over temperature and leaving it in the oven for the full 30 minutes."
"2","5","I made this recipe exactly as printed and it came out wonderful! I had a little trouble with the juices boiling over in the oven but that's my own fault (I accidentally used too small a bowl. The final result was a little runnier than I had expected so I think I'll try a little more cornstarch in the next batch. All in all though, amazing dessert and it will not last long!"
"2","4","A very good cobler recipe, thanks for sharing."
"2","4","Tasted great, I also only baked 25 minutes ...20 would have been better as the topping was a little hard. Next time I will add more peaches and way less sugar."
"2","4","The servings are more like 6-8 unless you're a pig and can eat a quarter of a pie! ;)"
"2","5","This was the first cobble recipe that I made and it was easier than I thought! i put half of a lemon in there instead of what it called for. It was such a great idea! The sweetness of farm-fresh peaches mixed with the tang of the lemon juice was AMAZING!!!!! I will make this again!!!"
"2","5","Wow."
"2","5","Oh heck yeah! I made this in a 9x13 pan, which made a thin-ish not too deep cobbler - you could easily double the peach layer with the same topping in that size pan. I followed the suggestion for 8 Tbsp butter and baking only 20 minutes, and it worked perfectly. I also ended up using just about half of the cinnamon sugar on top and it was great - I loved the crunch it creates! This is a great treat, especially with a little splash of half-and-half on top - but how dumb am I to make cobbler without vanilla ice cream in the house?! Next time!"
"2","5","Best cobbler ever! Buttery, sweet and perfect with ice cream."
"2","5","O.M.G! best cobbler ever! I love this recipe..it's very easy and I'm glad it uses fresh peaches. So many use canned and I'm just not a fan of canned fruit because it's so sweet. Nothing needs to be changed about this recipe. My cobbler did come out very juicy because my peaches were nice and ripe and I also added a half pint of fresh blueberries. I chose this recipe because it does not have any milk..as I am allergic to whey and need to avoid milk products. I wish I could put some fresh whipped cream or ice cream on top but it's great on its own. Thanks for sharing! Can't wait to try it with other fruit too like apples or berries."
"2","5","Family loved this. I didn't use Georgia peaches, instead I used Fredericksburg peaches ;) It was perfect. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Thanks!"
"2","5","Amazing! The 'cobbler' part is sweet and chewy, like a cookie. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the hubby said it was a definite 'make again.' Only thing I would do differently next time would be to take it out of the oven a little sooner. It was a perfect golden brown after only 20 minutes. 30 minutes is a little too long."
"2","4","I did not personally cook this one, but watched as DH did. He used fozen peaches and they came out just wonderful. I helped clean the bowl the peaches and sauce were in. But the topping kind of ruinned the desert for me. It came out like a whole cake on top of the peaches. He has made this recipe three times in the past month so he must love it but I have had better cobbler."
"2","5","Absolutly perfect is all i can say."
"2","5","This is a keeper! This Cobbler was enjoyed by all. Didn't have fresh peaches on hand, so I use canned peaches instead. I guestamted each 'drained' can equaled two peaches. The Cobbler turned out fantastic, albeit, a bit sweet. I will cut down on the suger, for the topping by half, in the future. I can't wait til I try this recipe with fresh peaches from my tree. Thanks for sharing."
"2","4","I added oatmeal and doubled the ingredients to the topping- perfect"
"2","5","um.....WOW! Had to bake a little longer, but sooo good and easy. Used milk instead of water, frozen peaches instead of fresh."
"2","5","Only one we make! Rave reviews all the time!!!"
"2","4","I was going to remove the skin from the peaches but then I decided I was too lazy and fruit is more nutritious with skin on. I loved the cobbler but I lowered the sugar just a bit and still found it delish."
"2","5","I made a few small changes that made this into one of my favorite sweet treats. First I cut the amount of cinnamon / sugar topping in half. I also used canned peaches instead of fresh due to the season and added a package of fresh raspberries to the fruit mix. Baked in individual mini loaf pans and served with vanilla ice cream..absolutely to die for. the 6 others that tried it devoured it as well! YUM."
"2","5","This is great. I used 3 bags of frozen peaches instead of 8 fresh peaches and everyone loved it. I had never made a peach cobbler before and had no idea what it was supposed to look like. Didn't look pretty but tasted amazing."
"2","5","Oh My Goodness - This was so good and I didn't change a thing. So much better than any recipe I head ever tried/heard of."
"2","5","I have made this a few times. It is perfect. I always get compliments."
"2","5","Very good cobbler!! I made this for Sunday dinner and it was devoured. I used a little more sugar because I like my mine very sweet and i didn't have any baking powder, but the crust was still great, I will make this again!!"
"2","5","sounds great does anyone know how to calculate can peaches vs fresh ?"
"2","5","Oh my! This is a yummy cobbler! I used a 9 x 13 pan and only baked for 25 minutes. Served with ice cream of course! I'll think of this every time I see a bunch of fresh peaches because I'll buy them to make this!"
"2","5","Loved this! Def need more of the topping, and don't skimp on the peaches.  This was prob the best cobbler I've ever had. It got rave reviews from the family."
"2","5","I would give this 6 stars if I could! I have made lots of peach cobbler and this recipe is by far the best!!"
"2","5","Delicious!"
"2","5","This is my go-to dessert. I find that this recipe can work with peaches that aren't ripe so if anyone has some, no worries. I double the topping, as others do. This recipe makes the best peach cobbler."
"2","5","Excellent cobbler! Only changes for next time - add more cinnamon (i'd double it), and make 1/3 more topping - it was the best part!"
"2","5","I had never made cobbler before. This was so easy and so delicious! My husband and Mother in law both said it was the best they had ever had. I used about 8 cups of frozen peaches i had let thaw on the counter for a couple hours. I might try fresh peaches next time, or maybe not. Oh i also used 4 tsp cornstarch and the sauce was perfect. Great recipe!"
"2","5","I absolutely loved this. It was so so good. I may just not be able to make it again cause it was so good i would be to tempted to eat the whole thing and gain 5 pounds. One thing is I would rather gain 5 pounds from eating this than something else. I didn't have any corn starch so I used flower. I also did not have any unsalteted butter so I used sated butter and left out the salt. I used canned peaches and drained and rinsed them. I didnt have a lot of juices like others but I did use one level ts of flower and one heaping instead of the corn starch. If someone takes this to a potluck and it doesn't get devoured I think they probably made it wrong."
"2","5","First cobbler ever! Turned out great, can't wait to try an apple cobbler."
"2","5","This was wonderful! I am not normally a fan of anything 'peach' but this was delicious! The crust is definitely my favorite part, while my husbands was the peaches. All together..we love it!"
"2","5","I have done this a couple of times and as directed, it turned out really lovely...."
"2","5","My family and I have made ourselves sick on this cobbler dish. It is the perfect combination of fall flavors!!"
"2","4","This was easy to make and smelled so wonderful while cooking. My family loved it."
"2","5","My whole family loves this recipe. It is quick and easy too."
"2","5","Easy to make. Didn't change a thing since it was my first time preparing. Next time, I would add blueberries. But it was quite delicious as it was. We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream. Really hit the spot. One of the other reviewers thought 30 minutes was too long, so I checked it at 20 and let it go another 5 minutes. My husband likes crunch. I liked the topping with 25 minutes cooking time."
"2","5","Excellent in every way! SO delicious. This recipe has become a family favorite. The topping is very good, adds a nice little crunch -- I did add a few chopped almonds on top of the peaches, then put on the crust... just trying to use the toasted almonds. Not too sweet, which we like. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe."
"2","5","I followed this recipe to a tee - came out perfect! To easily peal the peaches, I cross-hatch the bottom (a plus or X) and then drop into boiling water for about 60 seconds - then immediately drop into cold water. The cross-hatching allows the skin to start the peeling process so you don't have to work that hard at it. Great recipe."
"2","5","I made this dessert yesterday for the 1st after telling someone that I can make a GREAT peach cobbler ( I didn't have a clue where to begin...lol). This dessert came out so delicious! I doubled the ingredients because I was serving more than 4 people. The only thing I would change would be the final part of putting the topping on...presentation is key so next time I will roll out the dough and lay it across the top of I will do a lattice topping. STANDING OVATION for the recipe!!!!"
"2","5","EXCELLENT!!!!!!!! doubled the topping and took it out after 25 minutes. Big hit!"
"2","5","I tried this recipe because of all the reviews. The BEST peach cobbler I have ever had. It's better than my mother's recipe. This was my first time ever making one. It was so easy and simple only thing I added was a added 1tbs vanilla extract and I doubled the topping like most of the reviews said. I too used fresh peaches. You won't be disappointed. TRUST"
"2","5","Love this recipe. My hubby doesn't like peach cobbler and he ate one third of the dish! It was voted 5 stars by all in our house. Next time I may double the crust. You can never have too much of a good thing. :-)"
"2","5","simply amazing!!"
"2","5","Awesome recipe! Love this -- ALOT."
"2","5","I've been making this for 5 years. I make it at least twice a month during the summer, and once a month the rest of the year. My family loves it. I make it with all kinds of fruit, but especially like it with blueberries, however the peach is better than anything else. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!"
"2","5","Amazing! This turned out really yummy. Since this was my first time making peach cobbler I followed the directions exactly and I wasn't disappointed. The only substitution that I made to the ingredients was using baking soda instead of baking powder. And the crust was soooooooo yummy. The texture was perfect not cakey at all. Next time, I will add more brown & white sugar to the peaches mixture. Since I would like it to be sweeter. But this recipe is a keeper!"
"2","5","This is an amazing peach cobbler recipe. I didn't change a thing. I'd love to try it with another type of fruit to see how it comes out."
"2","5","This was an amazing recipe! My boyfriend absolutely loved it! Throw some vanilla ice cream on top.... TO die FOR!!!!! Thank you soo much for such a great recipe!"
"2","4","This was lovely, great to use up peaches that need eating. I did not pr-cook the peaches, not necessary, also i did not use water, but 1/2 C cream. Will make again."
"2","5","5 stars! Not the 'crumb' type topping we are use to, this is more cake-like and we like it. stating the number of peaches instead of cups is kind of ridiculas, we had to just keep slicing until we were satisfied with the amount and ratio of sugar to peaches. Very tasty and warm with a scoop of ice cream was orgasmic!"
"2","5","Delicious! Didn't change a thing and everyone loved it."
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! Recipe also doubles for a 9x13 baking dish quite nicely."
"2","5","Delicious! I didn't change a thing, which is unusual for me. I did use a 3.5 qt container, which turned out great because there were more chewy, caramel-y bits. Will be making again soon, and will probably through in some raspberries for tartness. This will be my go-to cobbler recipe from now on!"
"2","4","by far one of my most favorite desserts, and my husband is hard is to please but he loves this. i know this would be better with fresh peaches but if unavailable, the canned ones work just as well. the only reason i rate this 4 stars is the presentation. i wanted to rate it 4.5 but thats not an option."
"2","5","More cakey than I was hoping for but the flavor was great! I only used 6 peaches and it was perfect."
"2","4","Good but too sweet. I'll cut the sugar in both the cobbler and on the fruit in half next time. It was so sweet it was hard to taste the peaches."
"2","4","This was a really good cobbler. I've only made it once but I would definitely make it again. There is room for improvement, however, just for my family's tastes. They like things slightly sweeter. As always, make sure your peaches are ripe."
"2","5","Yummy. I got fresh summer peaches and skipped peeling them and putting them in the oven for 10 minutes. Mixed the peach ingredients, spooned on the topping and baked 30 min. Delish and no one noticed they weren't peeled. A summer staple at our house now. Also, used Smart Balance instead of butter for less fat."
"2","5","My family loved this made just like it was written..Thanks for posting it..."
"2","4","A little too much sugar and cinnamon for my family's taste."
"2","4","Very tasty!  I did reduce the sugar somewhat. Instead of a total of 1/2 a cup in the peach mix, I used about 1/3 in total.  And for the sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on top, I ended up only using about half of the mixture.  It turned out fantastic! Nice full crumbly, slightly crunchy topping, very flavourful peach filling, good consistency.  Will definitely make again."
"2","4","Very good cobbler recipe and easy too."
"2","5","Block party favorite. I layered the first batch of topping as a bottom crust (without the water and only 1/2 the sugar) then added 6 very ripe, very sweet peaches and baked 10 minutes. I tossed 2 cups blueberries on and then used the topping suggested by another reviewer of equal parts milk, flour and sugar, but I shorted the sugar again, those peaches were already so sweet."
"2","5","Loved it just the way the recipe was, wouldn't change it at all. I will definately be making it again, I think my husband will insist on it!"
"2","5","Scrumptious. To lighten it up slightly, I only used the white sugar (1/4 C) in the peach mixture, and in the flour mixture, I used white whole wheat flour (yay-fiber!) and cut the white sugar in half. Thanks for a very good recipe! I thought the topping was enough for 8 peaches; I baked it in a 9-inch square pan."
"2","5","This recipe was easy to make and turned out great. I like a cobbler that has a little crunch to it without having to include nuts. This one did the job. I did reduce the amount of sugar in both the peach mixture and the topping. Reduced it by about 1/4 and it was still very sweet without being too much so. did include an extra teaspoon of corn starch and the consistency was fine. I did double the topping ingredients and can't imagine using less. Last but not least I only had salted butter, so i eliminated the salt measurements and what was in the butter was sufficient. My husband loved it and there is plenty left over for tomorrow night. YUM"
"2","5","What a great recipe! Leaves the best taste in your mouth - made it exactly as written but doubled the crust and put it as a bottom layer, an old 'Mom' trick!"
"2","5","This was amazingly wonderful... It was sweet and tart... This was very easy to make and I am not a baker. Thank you for sharing."
"2","4","Very good...easy to make"
"2","5","awesome. I cut the peaches a little thicker and I think I used 10, other than that I followed it to the T. It was devine."
"2","5","This was my first attempt at making this and it came out delicious!With the brown sugar and cinnamon on top it was a little hard to tell when it was browned, but it still worked out well.I think next time I will double the recipe and use a larger baking dish like a 9X 12 size!"
"2","5","This is the first review I've ever left. I've been making this recipe for about 2 years as a comfort food dessert for our family. I make it as written except that I use 6 cans of lite peaches and I double the topping, as fresh peaches are not always available and it's much faster to used canned peaches. You can NOT go wrong with this recipe!! Thank you for sharing!"
"2","5","This was soooooooooo delicious! I was a little suspect of the hot water as the 'batter' looked too 'wet' to me. The result was crisp on the top, cakelike inside. I didn't read the reviews until too late--definitely will do more topping next time--it really made it. Definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","Oh my goodness!! I have eaten a lot of peach cobbler but this is by far the best! I doubled the batter recipe and used 4 tsp of cornstarch, also instead of 6 tbsp of butter I did 8 (16 when doubled). It baked for exactly 30 mins and was perfect."
"2","5","This recipe reminds me of the cobbler my grannie made......Yummy"
"2","4","I loved that someone suggested boiling the peaches for 1 minute then dropping them in cold water to remove the peels. Great recipe minus the topping. It was kind of bland. I like the yellow cake cobbler topping better."
"2","5","BEST PEACH COBBLER I have EVER made!!! Every summer I crave it and try new recipes. Something is always missing. Not this year!!! You've hit the nail on the head! Thank you so much. I quickly copied the recipe and added it to my personal cookbook collection to keep forever."
"2","5","Delicious! Wow, this was awesome. I cannot think of anything that needs to be changed. I had to halve the recipe because the peaches were kinda spoiled and I had to cut a lot off, but it still worked out perfectly. Thanks so much for sharing this! :)"
"2","5","Very good easy recipe!. i always taste my peaches to see how sweet they are before adding sugar. I like the cobbler topping. Its a very forgiving recipe as in I don't measure the ingredients out and it always comes out! I also cook in a cast iron skillet makes all the difference!! Thanks for the recipe."
"2","4","Very tasty peach cobbler, but I did feel it called for more topping than the recipe indicated. I would almost double it."
"2","5","This recipe is WONDERFUL. I too have been experimenting with a peach cobbler recipes. I have now found THE one. Many thanks to the lady who made this recipe. Linda Florida"
"2","2","The cobbler looked great, but tasted bitter to me. I see reviews that it was just sweet enough or too sweet. I haven't made a peach cobbler before.. so maybe it was just me."
"2","3","Halve the sugar amounts; the rest is fine."
"2","5","The first time I've ever made a Cobbler, or even tasted one, for that matter, and it was exquisite. I substituted the corn starch for double the amount of flour, because corn starch isn't readily available, but it was still fantastic."
"2","5","This is by far the best peach cobbler ever! If you want your guests to rave about your cooking, this is it! The lemons give it that 'made with love' taste, and the nutmeg adds the perfect kick! I love recipes like this that come from the kitchens of truly talented chefs who don't mind sharing. Thank you, Thank you!! Keep em coming!!"
"2","5","This was delicious!"
"2","5","if u like a 'cake like' bread this is the recipe for you. i love it. tastes great!"
"2","5","My wife and I tried this out and loved it. Made as is and was the best peach cobbler I've ever had. Can't wait to make again!"
"2","5","i made this the other night, followed recipe to the tea and turn out wonderful"
"2","5","SIMPLY AMAZING!! I MAKE THIS EVERY YEAR. IN FACT, MY 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAS BEEN HOUNDING ME CAUSE I HAVEN'T MADE IT THIS WINTER YET."
"2","4","this recipe is awesome. I cut the sugar in half by only using the brown sugar and very ripe peaches. For the topping, I also only used the brown sugar, and I added 50% to the recipe. DELICIOUS!!!!"
"2","4","This was pretty good! Peaches are out of season here so we had to use canned peaches and it still turned out well."
"2","5","Everyone raved on this. Having neer made a cobbler before I didnt know what to expect. Peeling the peaches were a pain."
"2","5","DH and I both loved! I cut the sugar in half and it was a treat served a la mode!"
"2","5","Love this recipe, the topping is wonderful! I use more cinnamon and nutmeg and used frozen peaches"
"2","5","I have to say, I've never made the peach filling from this recipe but I love the cobbler topping!. I use it as the topping for green tomato cobbler and it is consistently good. I use an apple pie filling recipe and substitute in peeled, sliced green tomatoes (plus a little extra lemon juice and zest). Once that is ready, I use this recipe to finish the cobbler. It's a great way to use up unripe tomatoes early in the season, or after the first frost!"
"2","4","I've made this a couple of times now. I tried the route that some reviewers suggested - boiling the peaches and sliding the skin off. That didn't work for me, and I wound up wasting a lot of the peach, because it came off with the skin. It was easier and faster to use a peeler and slice the peaches the old fashioned way. I also like to add more cinnamon (about 1 tsp), 1/2 tsp allspice and nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves to the peaches. They're great fall flavors for sweet, baked goodies. I'll be baking this again and again. This really goes so well with French Vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","Very good. I would cook the peaches for 10 minutes longer in oven. Cobbler had a nice flavor because of the brown sugar. Will use it again. Thanks."
"2","4","The best (so far) cobbler recipe I've tried. I omitted the extra sugar/cinnamon in the last step and found it to be quite sweet enough. Nice texture to the topping. I chose to increase the topping by another half and found it to be exactly right. I didn't peel the fruit as I like to keep all the natural fruit benefits in the dessert. Will definitely make this my cobbler standard."
"2","4","I made this gluten free by omitting the flour and baking powder and adding a gluten-free 'baking and pancake mix.' The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because there definitely wasn't enough crust(which I love). Too bad I can't add half a star. I am not gluten free and I still loved the flavors as did my gluten free mother-in-law. Next time I will double the crust and half the topping. I used 4 golden delicious apples instead of peaches."
"2","5","I saved this recipe two years ago and have been making it ever since with no alterations. I double it and make it in a 12 qt. dutch oven when we go camping and it's always the first dessert request--especially when the peaches come from our own tree. It IS quite sweet and you may want to adjust the sugar, but then I guess it depends on how ripe and sweet your peaches are. You'll love this recipe!"
"2","5","Holy cow this is good. I made it just like the recipe. It is dense on top, but the flavor was very surprising. Hands down my favorite cobbler yet!"
"2","5","This is absolutely my favorite cobbler recipe, I have been using it for a couple years right now and since I am making it again today I thought i better get on here and review it while I have the time! some tips, I always double the topping recipe! I just love it and I always use fresh peaches and way more than it says so it balances out perfect! I add a full tsp or more of cinnamon, gives it a little extra and I also sometimes will throw in four apples or some berries, all of them work well with peaches to me, though blackberries are the best! I have put merengue topping on it before when i was making other pies and didn't have any icecream or whip crm and it was blissful! I also sometimes will add a topping onto the batter that i use for apple crisp! it makes it that much more special! also if you mix it all together rather than just top it with the batter (doubled recipe on batter) with a cup of raisens and drizzle warm vanilla pudding over it afterwards its one of the most amazingly decadent bread puddings ever! i would give it 10 stars if i could!"
"2","5","Used 6 fresh peaches and omitted the nutmeg. Turned out superb. :-)"
"2","5","We made the cobbler in small onion soup bowls and it was awesome!"
"2","5","My husband LOVED this recipe. I found him in the kitchen literally licking the pan. This is the first time I have tried Peach Cobbler and it was a very easy recipe. I love the use of fresh peaches instead of canned."
"2","5","Made this for work and had 5-6 people ask for the recipe! I cut each peach into about 10 segments and then cut those in half, to make nice sizeable chunks. I used a 2.5 qt casserole and made 1.5 times the topping recipe; next time will probably just go ahead and double it."
"2","5","This recipe is very much like the one I grew up on in Colorado. I do recommend using fresh grated nutmeg; this turns a good cobbler into a wonderful cobbler. Also top with good vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","This was great reminded me of my daddys"
"2","5","I used a bag of frozen peaches and it turned out wonderful! Very tastey topping. Thanks!"
"2","4","I have made this recipe a couple times and my family loves it! Being a little lazy I use the canned peaches in light syrup and it still comes out great. The topping is really good and thick. I would give it 4.5 stars but I can't figure out how. Great warm with vanilla ice cream."
"2","4","This recipe is extremely good, the taste is great. I love the cake like topping. However, the recipe calls for a 2 quart pan which is too small for the amount of peaches required for this recipe. I used a three quart and it was perfect except the topping was not enough to cover the entire dish. Great recipe, highly recommend trying it."
"2","5","This is an excellent recipe. I always skip the sugar on top and make my own filling with strawberries & apple. Although with the peaches it is excellent as well! My husband always asks for this topping!"
"2","5","OMG, this is the best peach cobbler I've ever had in my life. It's also the first I've ever made and it came out perfectly. I do agree with the person who said that adding the cinnamon/suger mix before it goes into the oven makes it a little misleading as to determining when it's done because I pulled it out of the oven a little too soon but it was easily fixed by popping it back into the oven a little longer. Other than that....it's perfection. The only thing I did differently was adding a little allspice and nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon."
"2","4","Great recipe. I used regular old grocery store (not-quite-ripe) peaches and it still came out just right. I think the recipe could call for a little more of the topping, and chunkier cuts of peaches."
"2","5","This is the best peach cobbler I've ever tasted. I made this all last summer and it was a hit everytime. I made it again this summer its still the best I've tasted. Thank you, Thank you!"
"2","5","This was really yummy!! I felt like I was in my granny's kitchen again as a little girl. Thanks for the recipe! I made mine in a 9' round pan in the toaster oven. If you go that route, use the full amount of time for the peaches and sugar mix and then 1/2 the time (15 minutes or less) turning the pan one time halfway through after the topping is added. The only ingredient change I made was to reduce the amount of butter. 4Tbsp. was more than enough. (Thanks too to the reviewer who added the note about how to get the peels off nicely, that's a great trick.) :)"
"2","5","My husband did not want to eat this but I guilted him into it. He couldn't quit raving about it. I did double the topping."
"2","5","I loved this recipe and everyone else loved it too. I do think that the peaches are sweet enough that you could cut the sugar almost in half in the fruit and in the mixture on top. I didn't peel the peaches because I love the peel and it turned out just fine. I will use it again and again!"
"2","5","Great recipe. I did slice my peaches in larger slices. Adjusted the cornstarch to 1 TBS. Perfect cold or warm. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Perfect recipe, didn't change a thing! We loved the biscuit topping. We had our cobbler warm with vanilla ice cream on the side. MMmmm!!"
"2","5","Wonderful and simple recipe. I've made it twice now and both time got rave reviews. If your peaches are very ripe you may want to add a smidge more corn starch to help thicken it up though. Great flavor, I always added a bit more spices just cause I'm that way. Very good, very easy and all around great recipe."
"2","4","I made half recipe. Except for peeling the peaches, it went pretty quickly. I think the secret is pre-baking the peach mixture before adding the topping. It's good, but I can really taste the cornstarch thickener. Will try with tapioca, next time, I think (if I can find it.)"
"2","5","My new 'go to' recipe for peach cobbler. I did cut the sugar mixed with the peaches down to 1/4c. Next time I may try using honey instead of sugar mixed with the peaches. Before baking I finished it off with a sprinkle of Sugar in the Raw, really nice touch! Thanks for the recipe, we ate it all in ONE night!"
"2","5","i normally don't even like cooked fruit of any kind - but this recipe has changed my outlook! i doubled the recipe for the dough since i'm a carb kinda girl, and it was just perfect. i also added a little butter to the peach mixture and mixed dark and light brown sugar for the perfect blend. any kind of butter will work just fine and i'm sure splenda will help if youre trying to cut back on the sugar intake. i loved this recipe and so did everyone else. i'll def make again."
"2","4","I added about a tablespoon of vanilla because just about everything I bake ends up with an extra tablespoon of vanilla and it came out pretty heavenly. I personally found the sauce with the peaches a bit too sweet as well, but I had to substitute apple-nectarine juice for the lemon as well. Used pretty big chunks of peaches instead of thinly sliced as well. Still, tasty."
"2","5","This is a smash hit. I always follow the directions exactly and very time I make it my husband cannot eat it fast enough. I served it at a Fourth of July BBQ and it was quickly gone. Everyone wanted the recipe. I will definitely make again."
"2","5","Some of the peaches I had were bad, so since necessity is the mother of invention, I threw in blueberries and some really good fresh cherries (pitted of course). Took it to a dinner party and everybody was 'YUM YUM'."
"2","5","This is divine!"
"2","4","This is a great recipe, but if you use more peaches than called for to make a bigger batch, you may want to double the topping recipe. No need to double the sugar on the fruit - it's still delicious! This was a hit, and very easy to do!"
"2","5","This recipe was delicious!! It came out perfect and very tasty. The only suggestion I would make is to 1 1/2 times the crust topping, not double like other reviews suggest. Will make again :)"
"2","5","Incredible peach cobbler!!! This recipe is very similar to one a friend gave me years ago; hers was good, just missing 'something'. All I changed was to add a little lemon zest. Thanks aeposey for tweaking it to perfection and sharing!! Bring on peach season!"
"2","5","If you can manage it, do not eat this until the next day. It is SO much better after it sits all night."
"2","5","This cobbler is delicious and one of the best I've had! It was simple to make and came out just as I expected. It's cake-like but still crusty on the top and the peaches came out the perfect texture. I'll definitely make this again!"
"2","5","My cobbler came out just like the photo, but after the following tweaks: *chunky cut fruit *3 tbsp cornstarch (from 2) *8 tbsp butter (from 6) *reduced all sugar to 1/3 cup total instead of 1/2 cup *reduced topping to 2tbsp sugar used peaches that i froze from last season which i cooked in the oven til bubbling, then with topping it baked for full 30 min. delicious right out of the oven, didn't need ice cream."
"2","4","A very good recipe. Since peaches are not yet in season where I live, I had to use canned peaches -- they worked just fine. If you use canned peaches, drain them thoroughly and cut back a little on the sugar. I also doubled the crust recipe because I like a cobbler with lots of crust (to me it's the best part!!) I'll definitely make this cobbler again."
"2","5","oh so delicious. I sprinkled in some ginger and truthfully, after I tried it I believe it didn't need it in the first place. It is great the way it is."
"2","5","This is the BEST cobbler recipe ever! Do increase the dough topping (I used one and a half times the recipe)."
"2","5","This was very good and easy to make. I will make many many times."
"2","5","Delicious cobbler!! I followed this recipe to the word except for sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar mixture on the top. I forgot to do that and ended up sprinkling about half of the mixture on it towards the end just so it would look nice. I hand mixed the dough as instructed. The result was the most wonderful cobbler with a crispy crust.  My 70 year old neighbor who said that peach cobbler was her favorite has rated this as the best she has ever had...I'd say that is quite a compliment!!"
"2","5","I've tried at least 6 different peach cobbler recipes this summer in an attempt to find the perfect one. This is it. Hands down, the BEST peach cobbler I have ever had. I didn't change a thing. I've made it four times now and absolutely loved it every time."
"2","5","Wow! This is my very first cobbler ever, and it is FANTASTIC! Fruity, with just the right amount of sweetness and cinammon as an extra touch - perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, apart from the amount of cornstarch (I doubled it - 4 teaspoons instead of 2) and it did look as if 1-2 more teaspoons wouldn't hurt... But still, one of the best desserts ever! Thank you for sharing!"
"2","5","This is a very good recipe. I used 6 or 7 jumbo peaches and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. I followed the advice of others and made 1.5x the topping amount. I also increased the cornstarch, I initially used 4 tsp, but after baking the peaches for 10 min, I noticed how 'soupy' it still was so I added about 1-2 additional tsp, I stuck it back in the oven for 5 min before putting the topping on. I also increased the butter in the topping to 8 tbsp instead of 6 tbsp. My family absoultely loved this!! I don't know if I loved as much as they did, but I'll definately make it again."
"2","5","This recipe was very good... I always use more peaches (fruit) than a recipe calls for when baking a dish like this as the fruit breaks down--I like lots of fruit. I also added a little bit of Armaretto in with the peaches...oh yum! Thank's Amy...."
"2","5","Perfect!!! I'm making it with apples tonight - can't wait! I did seem to have too many peaches - Western Colorado peaches are HUGE. So I did the topping x 1.5 and put it in a 9x13 pan. It seemed like too much cinnamon sugar when I was sprinkling it on, but it was actually just right. Delicious! Thanks so much."
"2","5","Best ever! I made this once and loved it but forgot to save the recipe. The next time I went to make it I looked everywhere but couldn't find it so I tried one that I thought might be it, but it didn't even come close. Finally I found this one again- delicious! This is the only cobbler recipe I'll use now."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly except I used ascorbic acid (powdered Vitamin C, you can get it in the food preservation section of the grocery store) instead of lemon juice and this is so incredibly good!!  Edit July 2011: So that review was in 2008. I printed this up yesterday not remembering I had made this before! This time, I found that 6 peaches + 1 cup blackberries required me to double everything and use a 9x13 glass pan. A lot of reviewers mention a cake like topping but I did not get that. It had a really nice crunch, and between myself and 2 teenagers, that 9x13 pan was gone in 4 hours. My diet suffered but my taste buds didn't mind a bit. LOVE this recipe!"
"2","4","Made it as written. Only problem was that it was watery. Don't know if it was my peaches or next time I will add more cornstarch as others suggested. Two teaspoons did not thicken it at all. But it did taste good."
"2","5","Fabulous recipe! This was my first cobbler and it turned out great! I scaled up the recipe by 1.5x for the fruit and 2x for the topping and it fit a 3 qt dish perfectly. I would not change a thing!  We loved it so much that I made a second cobbler the next day, but using blueberries instead of peaches. For this one, I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg and used a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, and added 1/4 cup of orange juice to the fruit mixture, but otherwise left the recipe the same. The blueberry cobbler came out just as wonderful!   Thanks for a yummy dessert!"
"2","5","I made this for the first time and it came out awesome! However, after reading the reviews before I made this, I made the following changes:  Skipped white sugar & replaced it with dark brown sugar - (total of 2 cups). Also note, anywhere the recipe called for white sugar, I used dark brown sugar.  The liquid issue some were having, I used 8 tablespoons of cornstarch - (no extra liquid here).  Butter I used 1 whole stick of salted butter & I did not add any salt since the butter already had it.  Peaches - I used 9 and cut them small not thin, it was just right.  Cinnamon - I doubled it.  The only thing I would do differently next time is add more butter to the topping as I thought it needed a bit more flavor. GREAT RECIPE, THANKS FOR SHARING!!"
"2","5","I only had four peaches on hand, and made in a 8x8 inch baking dish. I made the full amount of topping though after reading other comments people made about wishing they had more topping. It is WONDERFUL!"
"2","5","Absolutely fantastic! People raved over this!"
"2","5","I searched high and low for a Peach Cobbler recipe, and this one will forever be locked in my 5-Star recipe collection. I used fresh Gala peaches, and didn't change a thing. Simply delicious."
"2","5","When I make this for breakfast, I use less sugar in the peaches and dough. I also use whole wheat flour. So good! I serve with milk or yogurt. The topping makes this the best peach cobbler around!"
"2","5","This is what summer tastes like! I just made this for the first time, and my husband has declared it his all time favorite peach cobbler. I blanched and peeled enough peaches to fill a 9 x 13 glass dish. Then I doubled the sugars and spices and used 2 TBLSP of corn starch. I also added 1 tsp of almond extract. For the topping I made 1.5 times the recipe. It covered the dish perfectly. I will be making this frequently. Did I mention my husband is now on his THIRD dish?"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! The whole family gobbled up the cobbler at one time! Very tasty."
"2","3","This was ok. I thought the topping would be more of a crunchy crumble but it was actually cake like. Also, am I the only one who had way too much cinnamon/sugar on the top? I even baked it for an extra 10 minutes to try to make it crunchier but it was still a tad mushy. A little too much sugar, even for my sweet tooth. Kinda overpowers the peaches."
"2","5","Perfect. I added blueberries, since I only had 4 peaches. It was unbelievable, thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Perfect and very easy to make! I wouldn't change a thing. My husband doesn't even really like desserts usually and he loved this."
"2","5","Very, Very good, especially with a little vanilla ice cream.. mmmmmm. Peaches weren't in season yet the first time I made it so I used canned and it was fine, not all that firm but fine."
"2","3","I am from the South. I followed recipe exactly. To me this tasted like peach cake NOT peach cobbler at all."
"2","5","I made a few changess yesterday when I made this: I used canned peaches, didn't cook them the first 10 min as directed for fresh peaches and used 1/4 cup of the peach juice from the can (warmed). As with other reviewers, I did double the topping and wow, it was great. I served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream...great recipe! Thx!"
"2","4","Good and easy. I omitted the water also like other reviewers."
"2","5","This is a wonderful recipe for cobbler, better than my maw maw's, as much as I hate to admit it. Though the recipe calls for eight peaches, the four large peaches I had seemed just the right amount. I loved the topping, that's what really set it apart for me."
"2","5","The *best* I've ever had ~ I added additional peaches and uses the peach syrup from canned peaches instead of water. Amazing. It was gone too quickly!"
"2","5","This recipe came out a little too sweet for me. The sugar and cinemon topping might have been overkill. I won't use the topping next time. Other than that, a very good recipe. Thanks!"
"2","5","My sister-in-law made this last summer and we have requested it several times. My husband and I are so excited to have the recipe so we can have it at home whenever we want. This recipe is good enough to make me want to plant another peach tree. =)"
"2","5","This was fantastic! My fiance loved how it tasted like a snickerdoodle. I used fresh peaches and doubled the crust. I added a hint more cinnamon and a splash of vanilla, too. I baked the cobbler at 400 degrees for 20 min and 425 degrees for 10 min. It was wonderful. Not to sweet and the peaches were just right-not mushy. Excellent, thanks."
"2","5","this recipe was extremely easy to make and was loved by all. I used 6 medium sized peaches (georgia, in season and ripe) and 1 cup of NJ blueberries. Blanched the peaches to remove skin b/c they were soft.   The topping is delicious. I love that it is more sweet than a traditional biscuit topping -- just the way I like it.  For the filling, I found it easier to toss the peaches and blueberries in the lemon juice, then pre-mix the dry ingredients and add that to the peaches to get even distribution.  Awesome recipe!"
"2","4","Divine, the only reason I left off one star is because the baking time is really too long. I took someones advice and baked for 15 minutes - and it came out perfect. I have a lot of peaches, so I'll probably make several cobblers and give out to people. I also plan to freeze some peaches, and then use them later around thanksgiving or christmas."
"2","5","My husband and I LOVED this! It was terrific! We both loved the topping which was almost like a cookie- so we will have to double next time b/c we did not get the abundance of topping that is shown in the pictures. Ours did not turn out dark either. But it was REALLY GOOD! We used canned peaches as well."
"2","4","I used 4 cans of sliced peaches drained, instead of the fresh. And doubled the flour topping because I was making it in a 9x13 dish. I got mixed up when the directions said 1/4 tsp cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice and cornstarch. The nutmeg was 1/8 tsp so I had to much! And the cornstarch was 2 tsp, so I had to little! Make sure you follow the ingredients and not the directions."
"2","5","UNBELIEVABLE!!! This recipe was perfect all I changed up was using frozen sliced peaches and teh dish was perfect. I ahve been an executive chef for many years now and I love it!"
"2","5","Excellent. Easy to make. I used frozen peaches."
"2","5","This is the best cobbler i've ever made. delicious, and everyone loved it!"
"2","5","Mmmm! This cobbler is too delicious for words!! Down right sinful. The Best ever."
"2","5","Delicious, my niece said to was 'AWSOME'. She is a pastry chef."
"2","5","I made this and was expecting to not eat it because I am not a real cobbler fan, but I had a lot of fresh peaches I need to use up and my husband had suggested a peach cobbler. I made it and took it to a family gathering everyone ranted and raved about how great it was, so I tried it, it was fantastic. The only peach cobbler for me will be making it every year when peaches are on. Thank for sharing this great recipe. Don't forget the Ice Cream for the top. (="
"2","5","'Best peach cobbler i've ever had'...says my 94 year old cobbler connoisseur of a grandma. Thanks for the recipe...it's FANTASTIC!!!"
"2","5","We had an abundance of peaches this year and I have tried many recipes and this is the last one I will experiment with. I left out the nutmeg and forgot to boil the water and just added hot water to the crumb mixture. It is the absolutey best peach cobbler recipe ever!!!!! Try it, you won't regret it."
"2","5","Wow, this is so flavorful. Used fresh Oregon peaches! Next time I will use a smaller dish, so the peach layer is deeper and the cobbler topping seems more plentiful. Also, I only used a few sprinklings of the cinnamon/sugar mixture."
"2","5","Just picked the last of the peaches off my tree and needed a quick and easy recipe to use them up in. This one caught my eye because of the brown sugar in the topping, so I gave it a try. HOLY SMOKES what a delicious dessert!! Can't wait for next peach season!"
"2","5","Wow this was amazing. I used fresh peaches that had a lot of sweetness to begin with, so I cut back the sugar that I mixed with the peaches. The cake/biscuit topping was awesome. I would make the topping again and eat it by itself."
"2","4","We really enjoyed this recipe, partly because it was so easy, partly because it's so good. We did use 8 T. butter (I guess that adds to the unhealthy, huh?!), 4 T. cornstarch, and baked it for only 15 minutes on the second baking time as other reviews recommended. Also, the second time I made it I used a somewhat coursely ground whole wheat flour, to make it more healthy, and it gave it a great nutty crunch and texture. With the whole wheat we'd all give it 5 stars (we're earthy health foodies types though!) ;) We'll definitely make this one again. Thanks!"
"2","5","This is a wonderful. I made some changes cutting back on the calories. I use splenda sugar and brown sugar. This recipe is a real keeper. Brenda"
"2","4","This was good and juicy but next time I will make my dutch apple pie topping as the topping was too doughy and soggy, but a nice recipe to start a peach cobbler."
"2","5","Absoluetly, positively THE BEST peach cobbler we have ever had! Thank you so much for taking the time to come up with this recipe. A definite keeper!! I HIGHLY recommend this one."
"2","5","Everyone in my office loved it. I am not a true Peach Cobbler fan, but when I tried the finished product, it brought me to my knees."
"2","5","Very good! I used 8 fresh peaches, cut the baking powder in half, and doubled the crust. I added about a tsp more cornstarch based on others' reviews. This truly is a southern style cobbler...heat it with a scoop of ice cream, and it's pure heaven. Update: I think it's better to 1.5x the crust rather than doubling it. :) It gives you that little extra crust which I LOVE, but it allows the cobbler to stay moist."
"2","4","I liked this a lot, however my peaches were pretty ripe which I think made it too sweet."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe (delish served warm with vanilla ice cream)... I won't change a thing! Anytime my husband tells me that something I've made rivals 'Mama's', I know the recipe is a keeper... Thanks!"
"2","5","I have made this about 5 times now, and it is great every time. I make the filling ahead of time and have taken the dish with the unbaked topping to a friend's house. She puts it into the oven and voila! The house smells great and the cobbler is fresh from the oven."
"2","5","great and so easy! I used canned peaches, since that was what I had, and added strawberries and raspberries. The raspberries melt away, but they lend a wonderful flavor. Everything else I did exactly as specified and it was wonderful. Will definitely make again with fresh peaches."
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly and it was delish. We had an overabundance of peaches from the neighbor. They weren't very good to just eat. I made this twice and it was eaten up quickly."
"2","5","Made this recipe exactly as written and it was marvelous Amy! Your experimenting paid off nicely. The cobbler was enjoyed and devoured by my houseful of guests last evening. Thanks so much!"
"2","5","This peach cobbler is so good..just the kind of recipe I was looking for!!! I made it for my family last weekend...and brought home an empty pan. I used Dole frozen sliced peaches instead of fresh."
"2","5","This was wonderful cobbler. I used fresh nutmeg and I only had 6 fresh peaches. I used more boiling water to thin the topping down some so that it was easier to spread all the way across the top. Turned outjust like my grandmother made. Thanks for the recipe Amy."
"2","5","Very, very good. Had it warm over vanilla ice cream! I didn't use all the cinnamon/sugar and didn't need to bake it the full 30 minutes. I used an 8' square glass dish."
"2","5","My husband who is 69. His mother was the best baker around said ' this is the best cobbler I have ever eaten ' and I must agree just FANTASTIC. I made it according to the recipe. Thanks Amy"
"2","5","It's soooo good! There's no need to tweak this recipe...If you like peaches, you'll love this!!!"
"1","5","Best thing to do is double the sugar and brown sugar with the peaches"
"1","5","This was SO good! I love peach cobbler, but had never made it and this recipe was easy. I substituted flour for the cornstarch - just doubled it. And a friend gave me some peaches from South Carolina. It was so good I tried making it again with canned peaches - don't do that!! It was way too sweet. There are other recipes on here that actually call for canned peaches."
"1","5","Brought it to a party and EVERYONE absolutely loved it. I used a 9x13 because 8 peaches were just too much for a 2QT dish. Because I used a larger baking pan, I had to double the topping. There was no cobbler left and we had 2 other desserts."
"1","5","We enjoyed this cobbler very much. I used 7 peaches because that's what I had, other than that I followed the recipe as written. The next time I make it I will double the topping because my DH doesn't think there's enough of it. This is definitely a keeper."
"1","5","This was my very first time making peach cobbler and boy am I glad I chose this recipe. I'm pretty picky and this was absolutely amazing! The only change I made was that I doubled the amount of the topping. So delicious! Highly recommended!"
"1","5","Quick and oh so tasty!!!!!"
"1","5","This was a hit in my family, I will be making this again"
"1","5","I changed nothing. It was awesome as it is. Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"1","5","A co-worker of mine gave me peaches from Georgia (given to her from a patient). I used these peaches for the cobbler. I browsed through recipes but yours had more ingredientsthat I liked. Everyone loved it. It was gone so fast. thank you!!!"
"1","5","Didn't make any changes. Loved it. One of my go to summer desserts."
"1","5","This recipe looked so good I made it with great excitement. One problem went outside to read a book and my phone alarm did not go so it was burnt badly the batter was quite yummy and we managed to eat the center of the cobbler. I have to try this one again! KK"
"1","5","I made this recipe for a Fourth of July church potluck and there was none left! This was the best, most balanced peach cobbler I've ever eaten. It was just the right amount of sweetness, even with the added cinnamon-sugar on top, and the perfect consistency. I used frozen peaches (thawed) because there were no perfect fresh peaches available for me to use, but they were just as good! You couldn't even tell they were frozen, and they were cut into perfect wedges. However, there wasn't enough topping in my opinion, so I made the regular amount but added another half of the regular amount and it was just right. 30 minutes in the oven was perfect. This recipe was so simple, fast, and easy. I can't wait to make it again!"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. I made it exactly as written except I accidentally used a full stick of butter then realized it was 2T over what was called for. Came out so good. I would serve this to guests. I used fresh peaches, they were smallish so I used about 10. This recipe is now my only cobbler recipe. Do not need any others."
"1","4","Just made this cobbler, I cut the sugar in half and it turned out wonderful!"
"1","3","I like the more 'cakey' cobbler but this was too sweet for me. peaches are delicious in their own right next time I'm going to half the sugar"
"1","5","Amazing! And pretty easy to make. The family went nuts for it! This is quickly becoming an everyday treat!"
"1","5","This is amazing just the way it is!!"
"1","5","This was easy to make, I doubled the recipe & it was a big hit. The only way to make it."
"1","5","Rave reviews even though my peaches were still hard. great recipe. am making again right now."
"1","5","This is a huge hit EVERY time I make it!!"
"1","5","This is the best peach cobbler I have made!! I did everything to a 'T' except I left out lemon juice and used canned peaches (drained) instead. So because if the sweet canned peaches, I will only use 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar topping next time. Warmed up and paired with vanilla ice cream is HEAVEN in a bowl!"
"1","5","This recipe makes me appreciate stone fruit season 100% more than I used to. We couldn't keep our spoons out of it. There is nothing I would change about the recipe, except to make sure that you have at least the 8 peaches that this recipe requires (maybe 10 if the peaches are really small) or you will end up with too sweet peaches and too much 'cobble'. lol"
"1","4","This recipe was delicious and easy enough to make. I rewrote it for my use so that the ingredients are listed in the order they are used. This really simplifies the prep for me. I think I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time, especially if the peaches are ripe and sweet. Yummy!"
"1","5","amazing recipe! I loved it it was so delicious and my family loved it too. I made 4x the amount because it's a huge family! and I kind of had a hard time spreading the topping but I was able to get it on almost all of it and to my surprise it was actually a good amount of topping but that was not a problem for us because we loved the topping! I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","My whole family loves this recipe. This will be one to hand down to the grandchildren. Thank you."
"1","5","Unbelievable! I am amazed how delicious this turned out, and how sustainable the recipe is. I had to make it gluten free and dairy free for my hubby - so i swapped out APF for gluten free flour; swapped out butter for Earth balance. I also did not have access to fresh peaches so I used canned and added frozen strawberries. It was just so vibrant and flavourful - can't wait to make it again!"
"1","3","I didn't care for the cake like cobbler part. It was Ok but still trying to find that perfect for me taste!"
"1","4","Yum! I made half the recipe and added about 1/8 tsp of vanilla"
"1","5","I had 8 mangoes that were on their last legs and I was going to slice them for work, but I am terrible at presentation, so I decided they had to be baked into something. They were fantastic in this recipe instead of peaches. Also, I wanted the mangoes to shine through since they are so tasty on their own so when it came to steps 3 and 4 I used 1/4 the amount listed for each ingredient. It was superb - just enough to sweeten the fruit up, but keep it light!"
"1","5","LOVED IT ....Everyone in my family was amazed of me making this and they love it."
"1","5","It tasted great! I totally forgot the cornstarch & it still turned out OK. I did add butter after I sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture since I used apples."
"1","5","YUMMM!!! This was a great recipe. I used canned peaches, 4-15 oz cans, drained. Which was about 4 cups total. I also used a 2 qt. baking dish that was deep and oval shaped. I used Judih's suggestion from her comment on Sep 15, 2008 to change how I made the batter for the topping. The topping was really thick and I had to cook it a lot longer. I think I could have avoided this by using a shallower and wider pan. Like a square 8 X 8 or 9 X 9. But it was delicious!!! Serve warm with some vanilla frozen yogurt ;-)"
"1","4","This was a quick and easy recipe. I was able to make quickly for delivery to a friend."
"1","5","Awesome! Served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, delicious :)"
"1","5","Delicious! My first time making it and my husband who has tried many peach cobblers said it was the best he's ever had! Definitely recommend the recipe!"
"1","5","Our family loved this recipe as is! I doubled all of the ingredients and put in a 13x9 pan. Thank you for a keeper!!"
"1","5","OK, im a sugar-holic. Doubled the sugar and it was good. I've made this pie several times and everyone say's its the best they have ever had."
"1","3","My family complimented it, but this cobbler wasn't really my thing."
"1","5","Delicious!! Made this today for my husband and he loved it!! It was easy to make and so delicious. I did forget to add the lemon and didn't add salt. Will definitely be using this recipe again & again!"
"1","5","Loved this-easy. It was amazing served warm and very good right out of the fridge!"
"1","5","This an AMAZING RECIPE !So simple and easy. And being handicapped with severe Osteoarthritis in my hands, well if I can do it then you can. I have also found that my oven burns it if I go with the 30 min. time. I have found that 20 is good....besides the aroma makes waiting an other 10 minutes unbearable ! Top it with a small scoop of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and it becomes #1 in the dessert file !"
"1","5","This is absolutely amazing!!"
"1","4","I made this for a birthday party with fresh peaches and it was a rave! I followed the recipe exactly"
"1","4","Use nectarines, not peaches. You'll be amazed at the difference."
"1","5","Delicious!! Made it almost exactly as written but I did increase the topping ingredients by 25%. I didn't think 1 cup of flower was enough and it wasn't for the 9x13 pan I made it in."
"1","4","This didn't last long once the family dug into it. It was too sweet for my taste but I will make it again using less sugar, as I really want to taste the fresh peaches."
"1","4","Petty good. I think it might have been better if my peaches had been sweeter."
"1","5","Without a doubt one of the best peach cobblers I have ever tasted. A friend gave me some peaches off her tree and the end result was delish. Even my hubby enjoyed it and he isn't a fruit lover! :)"
"1","5","Tried this recipe with peaches 3 x's now. First time with fresh peaches, second time with canned peaches. Of course the fresh was soo good!! But I must say the canned were also pretty good! I used all of the juice from one 29 oz. can of sliced peaches with 100% juice and then just scooped out the peaches from the other 29 oz.can. and continued as the recipe called for. Followed recipe exactly and didn't change one thing. So, so good!!! It's now my favorite cobble recipe! Thanks for the recipe AEPOSEY!!!"
"1","4","This was FABULOUS. That being said, there was way too much sugar. What I mean is that I made this in a standard 9' pie pan and had a THICK layer of the sugar/cinnamon layer over the 'crust' and still had about 2/3 of it left over. Only make 1/3 of the sugar to sprinkle on top and you have a serious winner."
"1","5","This recipe was easy and delicious. I upped the cinnamon and added ginger to the biscuit-y mixture. Also baked it in a cast iron skillet. One thing to note- this should definitely serve 6 and not 4 people."
"1","4","This was good but I think if I made again I would not slice my peaches so thin. I would have chunked the pieces."
"1","5","Oh so GOOD!! Made exactly as the recipe stated with one exception, did not have cornstarch so used twice the amount of flour."
"1","3","I found there to be too much 'cake' where the spoonfuls of topping were dropped on the peaches. Maybe the solution would be to drop smaller spoonfuls or pour the flour mixture in a baking dish first,evenly spread it, then put in the cooked peaches (like other recipes).I used milk and cream instead of water, and used 1/2 cup of that,not just a quarter. But all the other portions were exactly as stated in the recipe. & the taste of the cake mixture was great. Really liked it overall."
"1","5","This is amazing! The only thing I would say is I cut back on the sugar part a bit when doubled and it still turned out great. I really love the topping :)"
"1","5","I had some fresh peaches given to me and this dessert is delicious. It was easy to make and a real treat. My husband loved it. Will put it on my list of favorites."
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful peach cobbler. I added 1tsp of cinnamon and pinch more of nutmeg than it called for."
"1","4","So good! This was my first time making cobbler and I could not have asked for a better recipe. It's very sweet so I can't eat that much in one sitting, but it is excellent nonetheless. All in all, I deem this cobbler delicious!"
"1","5","Quick and easy! I usually have everything on hand (I sub frozen peaches). Great for just us or as company-over dessert!"
"1","4","This was the first peach cobbler I have made. Simple enough and delicious. I made no changes. My husband finished it off the next day and I am still upset that I only got one helping."
"1","5","This is a fantastic cobbler! However, I would use less cinnamon sugar on the top as it does make it difficult to determine how brown the topping is becoming while baking. I used an early variety of fresh peaches from the beautiful Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, and they were smallish in size. So, when I make this again... in a few days because it is so good....I will use 12 peaches. It had the perfect amount of moisture//juice and topping. As per another reviewer that commented that it was too dry, I would suggest that they use riper peaches! I used a 9' x 9' Pyrex baking dish. Thank you eaposey for this fantastic recipe!"
"1","5","Very delicious! Just did add the lemon juice cause I was out. Next time I think I will add a little bit more sugar to filling and some roasted pecans."
"1","5","I decided to give this recipe a try and it is to die for! It's all in the topping. I was a little unsure of adding the boiling water to the crumb topping and almost omitted it. I'm glad I followed the directions and added it. We're a family of 6 with 4 teenagers so I decided to double the recipe and use a 9x13 inch pan. I also added about 3/4 cup of toasted pecans to the topping. I baked it for approximately 25 minutes after adding the topping. This is my new go to recipe for cobbler. Can't wait till apples are in season to try in place of the peaches. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Great cobbler recipe! I've made it twice now and my family raved about it. Not overly sweet and perfect topping. I make in a smaller 8X8 pan and add peaches until it's full then you don't run out of topping!! Saving this recipe for the future! So delicious!"
"1","5","Just cut a little of the sugar and it is delicious. Made with fresh picked peaches. Yum"
"1","5","Mom gave us a bunch of giant peaches and I had a little time, so I made this cobbler and it was easy thanks to the good directions. It seems like there is a lot of sugar in this, but it tastes great."
"1","5","Excellent. Doubled the recipe except the sugar- I left that at the listed amounts. The result was a pleasantly tart dessert that was fabulous with frozen yogurt. I used a Corning Ware 11x8 baking dish that is about 4' deep. Be careful with the cooking time. If you bake this at 425 degrees for a total of 40 mins, I think it will burn. I turned the temp back to 375 after 20 mins and removed it before the slotted time ended."
"1","5","This is the best peach cobbler recipe ever!!!  We substituted splenda for the two 1/4 cups of white sugar (for the glucose challenged) and added 1/2 cup blueberries to the peach mixture.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Per some suggestions from other reviews and 3 attempts of my own I made the following modifications to better suit my personal tastes: added blueberries, used 15 peaches, used 8 tbsp (instead of 6) salted butter so left the actual salt out, and made 1.5 times the amount of crust topping. Delicious every time! Huge hit with everyone and especially my dad...which is the biggest complement since he's the pickiest person I know!"
"1","2","You can't cook this at 425 for the 30 minutes and not have it burn. All that work and no result."
"1","5","I used a combination of fresh white and yellow peaches, it was perfect!"
"1","5","I made this exactly as written and it was delicious! I will definitely make it again. The topping is more like a puffy, cake like topping not a traditional 'crumble' but it's great as is. To peel the peaches, blanch them for a 10-20 seconds and the peel comes right off."
"1","5","Perfect ingredient proportions! One tip: Make sure your pie plate is DEEP and not entirely full, maybe 2/3 full or definitely line the bottom of the oven with foil or possibly put a cookie sheet on a shelf underneath because my perfectly ripe peaches made QUITE a delicious mess bubbling and splattering :-)"
"1","5","Easy & yummy"
"1","5","This is a delicious, super easy recipe. I loved it, and have made it twice already, everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was I made it sugar free, substituting ALL the sugar with Splenda. I am dietetic so I had to try it, no one knew it, and couldn't believe it when I told them . Thank you for a great, tasty, easy recipe!!!!!"
"1","4","I've made it twice, once per the directions and the next time with double the topping. It's a 5 star recipe with more topping! (And you don't have to use it all. It just needs more than what's indicated in the original recipe."
"1","5","I added fresh cherries and figs since I didn't have enough peaches but it turned out awesome. I love the topping."
"1","5","This is a personal favorite of mine, and I use it all year with different fruits as they are in season. I just switch up the spices depending on the fruit. For example when I make it with plums, I use ginger and coriander instead of cinnamon."
"1","2","It really shouldn't have cinnamon and nutmeg."
"1","5","Hands down, this is the best dessert I have ever had!!! This recipe is amazingly perfect!   When I first read this recipe, I was concerned about the amount of sugar used in the 3 step process. All ingredients measurements were perfect. I urge anyone who considers making this recipe, follow this recipe exactly as written and you will not be disappointed.   Thank you aeposey for sharing your recipe. I will make this cobbler time and again to share with my friends and family.  Bravo!!!"
"1","5","I love peaches and grew up next to a peach orchard. I make peach pie in the summer. I had some peaches that were ripe, no time to make a pie, so I found this recipe and it is awesome. Like, I almost don't need to make pie anymore 'cause this is so good. And obviously it is much simpler than making a crust and shaping it in a dish and everything else for a pie.  Delicious."
"1","5","Omg, love this recipe. Made it 3 times out of fresh peaches and my friends and hubby's co-workers loved it and ate it all. I wouldn't change nothing about this recipe."
"1","4","Very good but a little heavy on the sugar"
"1","5","Absolutely perfect. My mom wanted me to make something with 6 peaches that were getting too ripe, and this recipe was AMAZING. I baked it only for 20 minutes because the crust was browned and I like the crumble to be a little doughier than usual, and it was heavenelyyyyyy."
"1","4","We really liked the cobbler, but like other reviews, the 'cobbler' part is a bit biscuit-y. That being said everyone enjoyed it and fresh peaches are the key. I think it could have used a little more spices and topping for us......will definitely tweak it a bit next time for our taste."
"1","5","Elegant, peachy goodness! Followed suggestions in the reviews for easy peel method, cut peaches thick and slightly reduced sugar in topping. Delicious! The whole family took seconds. Will definitely make again!"
"1","5","Amazing!"
"1","5","I used a 2 and a half quart casserole dish and it turned out great. This recipe is wonderful everyone that tried it loved it!"
"1","5","Step by step was very easy to follow. Wonderful flavor, I also used fresh peaches that were harvested this year."
"1","5","So glad for real cobbler! I just bought an 1/8 of a bushel of fresh Hill Country peaches, and wanted to use some in a cobbler. I HATE 'cobbler' that is just peach pie in a casserole dish. This is the real deal, tastes great, and I had every single ingredient on hand. Thanks so much! I did add some toasted pecans to it, just because that's what we like at my house."
"1","3","This was ok...I've used better recipes. There just didn't seem to be much 'goo.' It was mostly the cobbler topping."
"1","4","Good flavor, very bicuit like texture though. If I am going to go to all the work of peeling, pitting, and slicing peaches again I will likely try a different recipe, it did not wow."
"1","5","I have to admit I have never rated a recipe before and I am not a person who makes desserts. That being said, I was given a whole bunch of fresh peaches and I was trying to figure out what to do with them. I followed this recipe to the letter and I was very impressed. It is probably the best cobbler I have ever had and I was the one who made it! My family was in awe!"
"1","5","My go to recipe! My mom, rest her soul, used to make peach cobbler and I could kick myself for not standing over her and watching. Thankfully, when I found this recipe, she was still with us, so it got her seal of approval. I love this recipe. I love the simplicity of it b/c sometimes we get a craving for it at home or other times, I need an easy but scrumptious dessert to take to church events or parties. I have made this several times in the last four years or so, and it's always a hit. I follow it nearly to a tee except I usually use canned peaches (I keep them on hand for snacks). Also, the first time I made it, I did the flour mixture on top, but every time after that, I just used ready-made crust. This is soooo delicious! I am literally warming the oven to start making this now. Just had a craving and had everything I needed to make it, so here we go! Highly recommend this recipe!"
"1","5","Great recipe! Its sweet without being syrupy sweet and the crust isn't doughy. I sliced my peaches a little thicker and added a teaspoon of almond extract to the peach mixture and a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the dough. The smell was awesome and you knew you were in for a real treat. Get ready folks, this cobbler is awesome. PS: Don't forget to serve it with vanilla ice cream (or your favorite ice cream)."
"1","5","I used six peaches and two Granny Smith apples because that is what I had. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","I just made this recipe and loved it! I doubled it to serve more people. I checked it at 23 min and it was done. It would have burned at 30 min. I did not add the extra sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar to the top. Served with French vanilla ice cream puts this dessert over the top."
"1","5","My daughter wanted peach cobbler so I found this one and tried it and she loved it as well as the rest of the family. How ever I didn't have fresh peaches so I used canned. I used the same about of peaches as fresh and it was still very good. I was wondering if you could use this recipe for blueberry cobbler?"
"1","5","Fantastic! One thing that I like about some recipes is the ability to make some minor modifications without severely altering the flavor or texture (inevitably I am missing an ingredient anyway). I made this just as it is written but added twice the cinnamon and nutmeg, then added 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/8 tsp mace. Also, I put in 1.5 Tbsp cornstarch. I didn't add the sugar and cinnamon blend to the top, instead, I spooned out some of the juice after cooking the peaches for the first 10 minutes and then poured it on top of the bread topping. It was fabulous! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","My husband wanted cobbler instead of cake for his birthday. Fresh peaches are not in season in April so I used frozen instead & doubled the recipe. The only change I would make is to cut the sugar/cinnamon topping in half, there was just too much of it. Great recipe & the spices are just right, the topping is very cake like. A keeper!"
"1","5","Yummy! Was sweet, but very delicious. I used frozen peaches, there was alot of juice, but this was good cause it soaked into the cake topping. I will make it again."
"1","5","I'd never made peach cobbler, before and stumbled upon this recipe. I'm so glad I did! I followed the recipe, except that I used frozen peaches. I thawed them and then sauteed them in a little butter to evaporate the excess liquid. I was worried about the crust, but everything came together, perfectly. My wife and daughter absolutely loved it. Well...I did, too. Thank you, aeposey, for sharing."
"1","5","I enjoy making this just as much as people enjoy eating it :)"
"1","4","Great recipe, not quite enough crust, using teaspoon drops would stretch it just enough. Cooked in less than 30 minutes at 425 and a 'lot' of sugar/cinnamon sprinkle over the top, but the taste was great, crust is quite tasty!!"
"1","1","I've made this recipe twice, with poor results both times. Most recently the topping burned badly before it was cooked through. I've checked to be sure I followed the recipe correctly, and I don't see what I've done wrong. Not at all impressed."
"1","5","This recipe was delicious i made for thanksgiving and it was a hit, even got to ask to make it to give to someone else for a birthday gift, making it for christmas again, thank you for this recipe"
"1","5","My family loves this peach cobbler !!! All though I add lots more cinnamon & ground nutmeg ;) ..."
"1","4","Like some of the other reviewers, I don't consider this a cobbler either however it is still a really good peach dessert! I reduced the sugars for the peach mixture (3 tbsp white sugar and 1 tbsp brown sugar) and kept everything else the same. Instead of baking I heated the peach mixture (I had only frozen peaches on hand) in a pot over the stove until I got the thickness and taste I wanted from the juice. Then I poured the peach mixture into my 8x8 baking dish and made the dough exactly as instructed, with small dollops covering the surface for a more evened out look. I also skipped the cinnamon and just sprinkled some white sugar on top. It was delish and will make this every holiday!"
"1","5","I like it and thought it was very good. I did use can peachs instead."
"1","5","This is my first time writing a review. This recipe was amazing! Taste just like the peach cobbler my granny used to make. Thank you so much!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe: easy to make and tastes wonderful. Add 1/4 t. nutmeg to the cinnamon and sugar to really set it off."
"1","5","Hello I just wanted to say I love it I'm not gone down this recipes love it came out turnt out great the crust was cake like/homemade buttermilk biscuits....it had a melt your mouth texture fakie not too crunchy just rigtht, perfect amount of sweetness um it was really easy to tell when the Crust was done is very easy to make ,in my very time ever cooking it I love it thank you so much for much sharing"
"1","5","So good! I put a scoop of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ice cream on top and my guests loved it. They are still talking about how good it was."
"1","5","A sure crowd pleaser each and every time!"
"1","5","Next time I'll put it in a 9x13 pan instead and double the topping. Then it will be perfect. :)"
"1","5","Oooh my yummm!!! My family loved this. We topped each piece with vanilla bean ice cream and it was gobbled up so fast. We wished we had more! This was the first peach cobbler I've ever made and it was easy to follow. The only thing I would change next time is to make two batches because it was gone so quick. Lol. Also, I agree with some of the other reviewers on doubling the topping. Delicious! This will be my go to recipe every summer my Aunt brings me a box full of peaches from her garden. Thanks! :)"
"1","4","we love this recipe, my husband requests it often! We do make slight changes per our taste: we use 4 bags frozen peaches bc we like plenty of fruit in our cobbler and we use more cinnamon and nutmeg. we scoop on vanilla ice cream and its a hit"
"1","5","Excellent recipe .... I doubled the cake portion ...will definitely make this again"
"1","5","I love Colorado peach season and am always looking for something I haven't made before. GREAT choice as this cobbler is awesome. I only had salted butter so omitted the salt and it is perfect. Thank you!"
"1","5","I thought this recipe was great. Next time I'll use more peaches but otherwise I wouldn't make any changes. Reminds me of the peach cobbler I ate growing up. It was also a big hit with my friends who've somehow never had peach cobbler (what?!)."
"1","5","This recipe is a KEEPER! Fantastic every time and EVERYONE loves it!"
"1","5","This is one great peach cobbler. My husband loved the crust on top. I made some adjustments to this recipe. I used 3 Tbs of tapocia instead of cornstarch and let set for fifteen minutes before putting in pan. I also stirred this every so often during that period. When I put peach mixture in pan I added a half cup of milk. I didn't have any lemon juice nor did I want to use nutmeg so I did without them."
"1","5","AwesomeI! I wouldn't change a thing... I may add more topping it was so good."
"1","4","I would recommend using 4 tsp cornstarch and making extra topping (50% more). I used canned peaches and it turned out really well. I would also lower the baking temp to 375F or 400F since the top came out a little dark. I will definitely make this again."
"1","4","I just made this and my family LOVED IT!!!! I had to alter it just a little due to only having self-rising flour. It turned out great. Thanks for helping in the kitchen Allrecipe.com"
"1","5","Excellent recipe though I thought 30 min was too long in the oven. The top got too dark so I reduced it to 25 min and it was perfect. I also reduced the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top as it was too sweet. Best Peach Cobbler I've tried!"
"1","4","I cooked the peaches to thicken on the stovetop before adding the cobbler topping, and substituted some flour for whole wheat. Delish!"
"1","5","Great recipe! There weren't any leftovers at all! In fact, we ran out before all of our guests were able to try the cobbler. The only confusing piece of the recipe was when you add the boiling water, the dough turns mushy (instead of crumbly from working the butter into the flour.) I was worried that it wasn't going to turn out properly, but it was great! The consistency just goes from a crumbly topping to more cake-like. Regardless, it was great!!!"
"1","5","This is a family favorite and our go-to dessert recipe when we have company.   My modifications: I try to crumble the topping over the peaches since I prefer that rather than a biscuit-like topping. I only bake it for 20-25 minutes since the topping tends to burn if I leave it in for 30 minutes. That might just be my oven, though. While I know fresh-picked peaches would be the best option, we have only used sliced peaches from a jar. It is still quite delicious! I just drain and set aside the juice."
"1","5","This is the first time I have rated an allrecipes offering, enevn though I use it all the time. I was hosting a dinner party and wanted something quick and easy for desert! This was great. I had the seasoned peaches in the oven by the time we sat down to eat. While eating and socializing we could smell the incredible aroma. I cleared the tables and served up a great desert. Now it isn't the cobbler of my childhood which took a lot longer to put together and cook. This however is quick easy and taste great!"
"1","5","Cut the recipe in half and it still came out great! Quick to put together, too."
"1","5","This is absolutely delicious! Not overly sweet ,which I loved. Next time I will double or triple the recipe so my family can enjoy the next two nights as well."
"1","5","I have to admit, this isn't the yummiest LOOKING cobbler, but it taste WONDERFUL! I was a little skeptical when I pulled it out of the oven and it looked dry and bland; but it was out of this world good. We put a scoop of vanilla ice cream and WOW! I used 10 peaches instead of 8 and I chunked big slices; Added a 1/2 tsp extra cornstarch; made 1 1/2 batches of doughy topping; and only cooked 25 min on the second timing. It was really GOOD!"
"1","4","This was pretty good. Everyone liked the flavor. I wound up using salted butter because it is what I had on hand. I did not put sugar & cinnamon on top, just the cinnamon. I also used 8 cups of frozen sliced peaches that I thawed & drained. I am sure it would have been better with fresh peaches. I used my square Pampered Chef stone pan & it worked perfectly. It was very easy to make."
"1","5","Very yummy! Just made this and added this one to my recipe box as a most keep. I've looked everywhere for a really good peach cobbler. This one is it if your looking! Thanks for sharing it."
"1","5","Newest update: Made this for the third time last week, cut down on the white sugar by about half for the filling and almost the full amount for the crust and it was perfect....juicy, peachy and yummy. Final verdict: the recipe is a sweeter one, so definitely adjust to your personal taste. Update: Made this a second time for my neighbors. I thought it came out a bit too sweet this time around, but apparently, it was well-received and didn't last too long at their house. So I would simply say, adjust sugar to your taste when making and if it comes out too sweet, add some whipped cream, ice cream, plain cream or mix it with some oatmeal in the morning for breakfast. Oh, and as far as blanching the peaches, I didn't bother and just used a veggie peeler both times I made this. And I also didn't bother boiling the water ~ why chill the butter only to add boiling water? All in all, this recipe is soooooo yummy and I'm definitely keeping it! Thank you!"
"1","5","Everyone said this was a keeper and had no other opinions...that means a lot!!!!"
"1","5","I just cut the peaches normally, not thin and added a little extra. It was delicious! next time I may double the crust part because it was to die for!!!"
"1","5","I made this recipe exactly as instructed and I thought it turned out great! I am not qualified to comment as to if the recipe is truly 'southern', but I thought the recipe as is tasted fantastic. My only issues were that the sugar/cinnamon mixture bubbled up, spilled over the side and made a mess on the bottom of my oven. Maybe a layer of aluminum foil on the bottom your oven would prevent my unnecessary cleanup."
"1","5","Best peach cobbler I've ever had! I doubled the topping like some of the reviews said and it was perfect! I will be making this a lot from now on! a must try :)"
"1","4","Very good recipe. I used about 10 small peaches for a total of 6 cups thickly sliced. Next time I'll use 8 cups peaches, for a better peach to topping ratio. Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","My husband insisted he hated peach cobbler until I made this. I'm not a fan of peaches and I even loved it. Fantastic recipe. I used fresh peaches. I felt the amount of cinnamon and sugar for the topping was too much. I used maybe a little more than half of it. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","This cobbler received the highest praise from my Southern born and bred husband. 'This is just like my mama's cobbler!' The recipe is easy and fairly quick to make. I wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","Very good recipe. Followed recipe as is and the entire dessert was devoured! Will make again!"
"1","4","I'm not a cobbler fan, but my husband is, and he liked this well enough. Followed recipe to the letter and baked this in an 8 inch square casserole dish, served warm with sweetened whipped cream."
"1","5","I had extra fresh peaches and was looking for an easy recipe to use - this one certainly fit the bill. Although I had the 8 peaches called for, I only used 6 and, being somewhat lazy, decided not to peel them. The end result was wonderful - so much taste. My husband loved it as well. I would certainly make it again."
"1","5","This was amazing.. but make sure you put a cookie sheet under it.. mine just spilled all over the stove and smoked up the house.. but the recipe its self.. I will make again.. awesome.."
"1","4","Delicious. Watch ... the topping will burn."
"1","5","Made 1 1/2 times the topping. So good !!"
"1","5","Love the way it makes my whole house smell like cinnamon! Delicious."
"1","2","Did not like this. Like some people said... peaches with biscuits on top. It is not a peach cobbler. I think that it might have been better with canned peaches."
"1","5","I have had a craving for peach cobbler, and finally found this recipe!! So good!! Used a little less sugar in the fruit and in the topping, but kept everything else the same. Wish I would have made more....will have to very soon!!"
"1","5","This is such a good recipe. My husband told me to give it ten stars. We had it with homemade vanilla rum ice cream. It was over the top! I am really particular about peach cobbler. This does not disappoint. I used a 13x9 pyrex dish....what more can I say ...Make it ! It's fab !"
"1","5","This is the best peach cobbler I've ever put in my mouth! A true Southern classic!"
"1","5","We loved this cobbler! Crispy topping and very cinnamony."
"1","5","I combined this recipe with another recipe from a different website. I made this recipe with peaches and mangoes. I skipped the brown sugar and used 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice, and 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice instead of a teaspoon. I also skipped the cinnamon and nutmeg and used 2 Tablespoons of whole wheat flour instead of cornstarch. I made the rest of the recipe exactly as is. It was perfection!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe twice this summer. It was a hit both times! I followed the recipe just as it is written."
"1","5","I never made peach cobbler before but I have eaten it and love it, so I decided after picking up some peaches on our way home from Myrtle beach to NC I wanted to try making it, I of course went to this site and found this recipe, it was very easy to make, the only change I would make next time is to use 1/2tsp. of baking powder as I somewhat tasted it in the finished product, but overall I loved it and so did the family.-Deb"
"1","5","This was fabulous. I chopped my peaches into smaller, bite-sized pieces and made half-again as much topping (since we really love that part at our house). If you opt to do so, I recommend putting in a bit larger or deeper baking dish as I lost some of the really yummy sauce to the bottom of my oven. I will make this again and again. It's delicious! Thank you for the recipe!"
"1","5","My family LOVED this Peach Cobbler! We liked everything about it! I did make as the recipe called but I added 1/2 again as much of the dry ingredients as suggested in one of the other reviews. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a big hit!"
"1","5","SO GOOD! My favorite cobbler recipe ever. I decreased the sugar a little and decreased the butter by 1 tbs to try and save some calories. I actually burned the cobbler because I left it cooking to long (completely my fault) and it still was amazing! Thanks for posting :)"
"1","5","Made exactly according to directions and it was amazing."
"1","5","I love this recipe! It's perfect as written, but also lends itself well to adaptation. Last night I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 and used a combination of fresh and frozen strawberries, blackberries and blueberries instead of peaches. SO GOOD!!!!! It got rave reviews by everyone in my (very large) family for the taste as well as the look. It turned out beautifully. Even grandma was impressed! It's also super easy to make. The only time consuming part is cutting in the butter (or peeling the peaches if you're using them). You need to make this now!"
"1","5","Followed directions exactly and came out perfect. Very easy to make. My husband said it was the best peach cobbler he's ever had."
"1","5","This peach cobbler is delicious! Wow! It was a hit. The kids loved it! I loved it! My husband, who hardly ever eats dessert, had seconds! It's soooo good! It's super easy to make. As far as the prep goes, what takes the longest is peeling the peaches. This is an easy weekend dessert treat. I served it with vanilla ice cream on top, which made it even better."
"1","5","sweet spiced peaches bubbling under a buttery crust leaving you feeling full and satisfied.what could better!"
"1","5","I made this recipe and my boyfriend LOVED it , the recipe for the topping needs to be increased as there was not enough to cover the entire top, I will use double next time. This will become my go to recipe when I want to WOW folks !"
"1","5","This is a great cobbler recipe. I did not have corn starch on hand, so I used two heaping tablespoons of flour...perfect consistency! I also added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract...makes the flavor pop!"
"1","5","Great recipe! You can use any type of fruit - I made it with half peaches and half strawberries - turned out great!"
"1","4","Very good. I only had frozen peaches (much easier) so will try when they are in season. I read other reviewers and doubled the crust but I think I'll leave it alone next time. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","2","made as recipe indicated; terrible cakey topping; sugar top burned; what a mess;"
"1","5","Made this tonight and it was yummy! Thanks for the share and I did use canned peach's since its January in Colorado...lol still very good"
"1","5","Gone 15 minutes after I took it out of the oven, so it must be good! We ate it hot with vanilla ice cream. My son brought me a quart of home canned peaches, and I used them to make this cobbler for breakfast. The peaches were canned in light syrup, and I drained them and used about half the peach liquid in the fruit layer, along with an extra teaspoon of cornstarch. A good tip is to put the fruit layer in the microwave for the first cook time, as it's quick, and it's easier to tell when the filling has thickened completely. The only change I might make next time is to add a bit more butter to the crust, maybe another 2 tablespoons full, because I like more of a buttery taste. This one's a winner though."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! Had some peaches that had that gross, meal-y texture that just could not be eaten raw. So, my mother suggested peach cobbler and I tried out this recipe. I ended up making a few changes as per previous reviews: I made 1.5 the topping (but didn't do 1.5 the sugar), and used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Also, I did not use boiling water.. it would have completely negated the rubbing in or cutting in of the butter! Turned out amazing! I will definitely be making this again. Would love to try it with a variety of fruits.. we do have some slightly old plums too..."
"1","5","This recipe was very good. My entire family loved it and my daughters wants me to make it for her sleepover. I did however have to double the the recipe for the crust."
"1","5","I have made this three times now and I still can't believe how good this cobbler is!!! I took the advice of others and doubled my spices as well as doubled the dough topping. It turns out perfect every time!!!! I actually gave a pan of this away as a gift.... it was hard to watch it go without eating it all up!"
"1","3","Flavor of the filling was good, thought the topping was to doughy. I expected more cruch."
"1","3","I was disappointed by this recipe. The only change I made to this recipe was to cut the sugar in half across the board and I only used brown sugar. The net result was alright - but nothing to rave over."
"1","5","This recipe is awesome. Best peach cobbler I've ever tasted. I think the key is using fresh peaches that are just a day or two away from being overripe. I didn't modify this recipe at all and it turned out perfectly. I did do what another reviewer recommended - dropping the peaches in boiling water for a few seconds. The skins just come right off and it's a whole lot easier than trying to peel with a knife."
"1","5","This was amazing- making for the second time today! I didn't change a thing (other than only use 6 peaches as that was all I had!) and it's perfect. Thanks to the user who added the tip about boiling the peaches 1st for a minute followed by the cold water bath to remove the skin- I am a newbie at cobbler and that was really helpful!!"
"1","5","My husband and I made this together. It turned out really well, but I think we made the topping too thick. (Both the batter, and how it was applied.) It is a tasty top, but next time I'll make it a little thinner. Also our fault, we weren't sure if we were using too many peaches but it turned out to be not enough. We used an 8x8 pyrex baking dish and four large peaches. Next time I'll use 5-6 peaches. Yum!"
"1","5","I made this as part of Sunday night dinner. My boyfriend went back for thirds! Will definitely make again ! I did boil the peaches then submerged them in cold water and the skins came right off !"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!!!"
"1","5","Outstanding! I followed the directions exactly (even though I was skeptical about the boiling water) and it turned out perfectly!!! My guests were vying for the last two servings. Next time I make it I might try using slightly less sugar, but in a way I hate to tinker with success. Also, I intend to use this recipe as a basis for other fruit cobblers -- apple, blueberry, rhubarb/strawberry etc."
"1","5","Fantastic! Sooooo good. You won't be disappointed. I made this with blackberries too."
"1","5","This turned out to be a delicious recipe perfect for taking to dinner at your friend's house. We used 10 peaches because ours were rather small. On top of that, our peaches came from a relative rather than the supermarket, and even though they were low quality, the cobbler turned out amazingly. We devoured it and it is absolutely a recipe that we will be making again soon."
"1","5","TASTY! Definitely agree with other reviews advising using less sugar and more topping, but my husband loved it. This one's a keeper :)"
"1","5","This was simply amazing! I wouldn't change a thing. The sugar/cinnamon topping gives it a crispy texture I wasn't expecting. Absolutely perfect served warm with vanilla ice cream. This is going to be one of our new favourites."
"1","5","I took one bite of this and gave myself a pat on the back! It was delicious!!! My hubby agreed. I can't wait to share it with others (the next batch, of course). I took an earlier suggestion of a quick dunk in boiling water and then into cold water for easy peeling before slicing the peaches. The topping is perfect and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes the dessert divine :)"
"1","5","I really like the peachy flavor of this recipe. Traditionally when I have peach cobbler it is far too sweet. I substituted organic cane sugar for white sugar and spelt flour for all-purpose. Excellent recipe."
"1","5","This was **exactly** as I'd hoped it would be. I have friends from Montgomery, Ala., and they made the best peach cobbler and this reminds me of it, which was what I wanted. I didn't think it was too sweet at all. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I doubled the topping, because I like a thicker top and it was a MAJOR hit for a party, even though my husband accidentally turned the oven off and I had to re-bake it. It is officially a go-to family classic. PERFECT."
"1","4","Recipe tastes good, but even with ten peaches, it still needed more for a 9x13 pan. I used a doubled recipe of topping as other reviewers suggested, as well as a tad more cornstarch as my peaches were ripe and very juicy. For a 9x13, double topping, double peaches, or make original recipe in an 8x8."
"1","5","This was very delicious. It was light, not too sweet, and very easy to make. With some good vanilla ice cream, it was to die for! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This is a fabulous fresh peach cobbler recipe. Made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. It's a very sweet cobbler so if your peaches are on the sweet side as mine were, you could easily reduce the sugars in the peach mix. I will definitely be making this my go-to peach cobbler recipe! My husband & friends loved it as a nice afternoon dessert with coffee. Thanks for sharing it!"
"1","5","Oh...my...gosh...! This is the best cobbler I have ever eaten. I didn't change a thing and will definately make this again!"
"1","5","Love this recipe. I didn't read the recipe correctly the first time I made it and didn't add the boiling water to the topping mixture. Since I had a crumbly mixture, I sprinkled it all on top of the peaches, then sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top of that. It came out sweet and crunchy! I haven't made it the proper way yet, because I love the crunchiness. My family loved it too."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe! My peaches were large and very juicy. I added another 1/2 tsp. cornstarch and cut back a bit on the sugar. Thickness of sauce was great. I used Vietnamese cinnamon as it adds a depth of flavor. I used a 7 1/2' by 10' pan. Topping (moist and yummy) covered nicely. I cut the final bake down to 25 minutes. This recipe is a keeper!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. For me 8 peaches equaled 6 cups of peeled cut up peaches. Came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","4","Added fresh blueberries, just for kicks. Great!"
"1","5","I have looked for the perfect peach cobbler recipe for years and have finally found it! I made this for a large group and multiplied by 9 - the result was incredible. I left the peaches in the oven to caramalize for about 30 minutes (just because there were so many), but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly. Wow! Of course our peaches were of the home-grown CA variety ... :)"
"1","5","Excellent flavor and the texture of the topping was great. I will increase the amount of topping next time I try it."
"1","5","This is outrageously good. I have never had a knack for these desserts, but this one has changed my status completely. I am now the cobbler queen.   I wonder if I could cut out the sugar and turn the topping into dumplings for stew? Any ideas?  Thanks, Georgia Peach.  Rebecca"
"1","5","We loved this recipe! That is really saying something, because my husband doesn't like peaches! Used fresh peaches, didn't change a thing, with exception of baking time. 20 minutes did it for us. Thank you"
"1","5","Just made this -- it is WONDERFUL!! My peaches were just a tad over ripe -- will be sure to get more firm ones next time. Otherwise, everything came out spectacular! Thank You for sharing this!"
"1","5","excellent cobbler - probably the cooking of the peaches first that does the trick. very yummy"
"1","5","i cut the peaches chunky and left out the cinnamon in the sugar for the top. exactly what i wanted. best peach cobbler ever!"
"1","2","waaaaaay too sweet, cloying. disappointing."
"1","5","I used peaches and apricots."
"1","5","Made this for dessert last night and it was soo good! I do love a 'traditional' cobbler with a pie type crust on the bottom and top, but I think I might like this version even better! I only used five large peaches because that's all I had on hand, but I thought it turned out just fine! I loved the crunchy cinnamon sugar topping and the cake-like crust. I made the recipe just like the directions suggested (minus the number of peaches) and I personally liked the consistency, not to runny or too thick! I also thought this was a pretty easy dish to put together. Will be making this the rest of peach season!"
"1","5","This was SO good that I made it twice this weekend! I doubled the topping as I agree with another post that it is the best part!"
"1","4","Super yummy and easy - 30 minutes in the oven was a bit to long though."
"1","5","This was the second time I baked this recipe. I had positive feedback both times. The only thing I will change next time will be not to add the cinnamon over the top of the dough mixture. It makes the cobbler look dark...like as if it is burned. It is delicious though and everyone loved it!"
"1","1","The crust was too much like a cake wwe did not like the flavor"
"1","2","My guests liked it and went for seconds, but I thought the cake part was too heavy and too large. It didn't seem that the topping would expand as much as it did, but it overwhelmed the peaches. I used a lot of peaches, assuming that the dessert would be predominantly fruit with a moderate topping. Unfortunately, it turned out the other way around. I wouldn't make it again."
"1","5","I made this with both peaches and blueberries and it was fantastic! I doubled the cornstarch because I anticipated more juice. I will certainly save this recipe"
"1","5","This is a great cobbler. I used a 7 1/4x 11 pyrex dish and it worked wonderfully. I made twelve balls of the dough, flattened them and laid them on top. I also added ginger to the peaches just because I LOVE ginger on peaches! As written, the cobbler was in a nice ratio with the peaches and would have been the perfect balance to some vanilla ice cream had I had some! But if you are not making it to go with ice cream, I would double the filling. This recipe would make a great apple cobbler as well!"
"1","5","Yummy!"
"1","5","This recipe was so delicious! I used both fresh peaches and fresh cherries. I added about 50 percent more to the breading (as suggested by another review) and it came out fantastic. To peel the peaches I tried placing them in boiling water as suggested by another person and the ripe peaches peeled perfectly. The peaches that I picked that weren't too ripe I had to use a knife to take the peel off. Great recipe."
"1","3","I made exactly as written with out changes. The top was too 'cakey'. I didn't care for this. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","This peach cobbler was amazing!! My husband said it was the best he's ever had in his life and I agree. It will always be our go to recipe now. I was worried when I read one review saying it was'cakey that it would be more like a coffee cake or something but it wasn't in my opinion. It is like a cobbler but the cobbler part is a little more cakey than just crumbly if that makes sense. I took the advice of others and cut my peaches into larger chunks - about 8 slices per peach. They were perfect after cooking. To make peeling easier I dropped my peaches in boiling water for 30 seconds and then into an ice water bath. The skin came off very easily."
"1","5","This had a great crust, I used fried apples from a can and still added all the ingredients. It was amazing."
"1","5","This was a night of firsts for me. The first time checking out this website, and the first time making peach cobbler. This recipe was so easy to follow, and the end result was absolutely delicious! My family enjoyed it immensely! This was a sweet ending to my wedding anniversary."
"1","5","Fantastic...though next time I'll leave off the sugar dusting...a bit overkill."
"1","5","Look no farther for a peach cobbler recipe. This is it! I have tried several different recipes and something is always just a bit off. Not this. This is spot on. The cake-like topping is moist and the sugar-cinnamon mixture adds the perfect touch. My husband said he would pay for this!"
"1","5","This recipe is delicious. I made it for my boyfriends birthday and he loved it. I'm dieting right now and I had a taste of it and I thought it was so good that I couldn't stay out of it. Once completed, I only baked for 20 minutes."
"1","5","I had never tasted, let alone made cobbler before this recipe. This cobbler was delicious, though, and my roommates gobbled it up in two nights! I'll definitely make this again."
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!!! So much better when this is made with real peaches!"
"1","5","This was AMAZING!! Everyone loved it!!! I'm not known for my 'baking' skills... and this redeemed myself with my hubby! He was impressed! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!!"
"1","5","There's a reason this recipe has 1160 reviews!! It was the best I've had hands down and I've had alot of different types of peach cobblers. I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","4","I had never made cobbler before and this recipe was VERY EASY. It was definitely good, not overly sweet. I believe my peaches were probably too small which led to too much dough topping, but with more peaches it would have been perfect!"
"1","5","We loved this especially the crust! Only wished I have added a half more of it. Make sure to taste your peaches before adjusting the sugar. Mmm best cobbler yet."
"1","4","This was pretty good, definitely fit the bill! However, I did change a few things. I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla, added 3/4 cup of melted butter, used flour (as oppose to cornstarch), cooked the peach mixture on stove (and not in the oven), cut crust in strips and used a traditional horizontal/vertical pattern. Also, cooked at 425 for 15 minutes (until crust browned) and then turned oven down to 350 for 55 minutes."
"1","5","This is so so so good. It was easy, fast and it cooked up yummily!!! I didn't feel like going to the supermarket so I used canned peaches....it was still fabulous. Other than that I followed the recipe. Enjoy!"
"1","5","I love this recipe! I've attempted the recipe more than once now. I used frozen peaches and omitted the topping for the cobbler. The dish is sweet enough without the topping."
"1","4","I liked how easy and fast this recipe was. My only suggestion would be to use a lower oven temperature if your oven tends to run a few degrees hotter, like mine."
"1","4","This recipe is BEST with fresh South Carolina ABBOTT FARMS peaches!!!"
"1","5","Amazing! Topping is like a pour-on pie crust! STOP LOOKING FOR COBBLER RECIPES, this one is the only one you need!"
"1","5","This was a good recipe. However, I used frozen peaches and substituted Truvia in place of sugar and Splenda brown sugar in place of the brown sugar. It was great."
"1","5","This was a HUGE hit with my family. I used canned peaches and it came out just fine too!"
"1","5","Excellent! I cut down on the the sugar to make it a bit healthier and it was still sweet as can be. I will definitely be saving this recipe."
"1","5","I LOVE this recipe its easy and you can change it to fit what you like!"
"1","5","This was easy to make and delicious. The topping is more cake-like, but everyone liked that."
"1","3","I followed some by adding sugar cinnamon on top. I used peaches that I had put in the freezer last summer. This recipe is OK. I would probably not make it for company, but for just a simple weekly dessert it's passable."
"1","5","Delicious!!! I make this a several times every year when the peaches are at their peak."
"1","5","Easy-peasey recipe. I followed it exactly(except I used pears instead of peaches!)   The only thing I would do different next time is double the topping/crust. It was awesome and family loved it..."
"1","5","Fantastic! This is best fresh, as it doesn't keep well. One of the tastiest desserts ever."
"1","5","This was not like any cobbler I have had in the past but it was very good and my family did enjoy it. I will say that the cobbler does not last as long as a traditional cobbler but still good."
"1","5","THIS IS AWESOME...I made it for 1 serving and put the 1 serving in 5 damskins to reduce calorie intake and of course portion control"
"1","5","Great dish~ Will definitely make again. Gonna try it next time with apples. Yum~"
"1","5","This recipe is very good. I made it using peaches I had already canned. They ae in a light syrup, so after draining I just sprinkled a little bit of sugar over them, added the spices, omitted the lemon juice and did not pre bake them. I doubled the topping recipe and used an ice cream scoop to put on the peaches for even baking. I only sprinked a bit of sugar over the topping. It came out so good and it was gone in no time at all. A scoop of good vanilla ice cream made it top notch."
"1","5","It was my 1st time making peach cobbler -- and it was better than any that I have tried at restaurants or purchased from stores. My husband and I absolutely loved the crust -- I might make 1 1/2 times the crust next time. It was not too sweet for us. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","Made this cobbler using fresh PEARS from our tree. Delish!!! Everyone loves it!!"
"1","4","while i am not generally a cobbler person, this was pretty good. i thought the peach/topping balance was a little off - i would prefer more peach, less topping. however, the cinnamon sugar sprinkle on top formed the most wonderful crunchy addition - by far my favorite part. i choce this cobbler recipe because it called for fresh peaches instead of canned, and i definitely thinkt hats the way to go as long as peaches are in season. i think the freshness of the fruit is able to shine through well in this recipe. thanks!"
"1","5","AMAZING!!!!"
"1","5","My kids and dad couldn't stay away from this. I added extra butter as suggested and cornstarch and was just perfect."
"1","5","Being from Atlanta and growing up with peach cobbler, I have to say this is the best ever. Even good with canned peaches if fresh aren't available. Try Margaret Holmes brand O'sage peaches if you can get them."
"1","5","WONDERFUL!!!!!! Just made it for the hubby tonight! The only thing I changed was made extra topping. This recipe is a keeper!"
"1","5","I made this for the first time tonight and the only thing I changed was using canned peaches. I love this recipe! This and Paula Deen's will be my go to recipes for peach cobbler!"
"1","4","Decrease the cooking time to about 20 minutes - it will burn if left in for 30. The topping isn't quite what I expected (was hoping for something a little more crumbly), and I could have handled more cinnamon flavor, but overall I thought it turned out delicious."
"1","5","I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out great! I used up all of my mealy peaches in one go, and they taste great in this cobbler."
"1","5","dynamics of this recipe made it easy to convert into a work of art  i just guessedimated measurments and when it was time for boiling water i grabbed the coffe pot"
"1","5","So good-- did what others suggested and double topping! So yummy had a cake like top no tasting like biscuits!"
"1","4","Only gave this a 4 star because it needed a few changes from the original recipe. I added 4 more peaches and used 3 Tbls corn starch to thicken. Excellent flavor and easy to make."
"1","5","my family loved this"
"1","5","This was my first time ever making or eating peach cobbler and It was AMAZING! Everyone who tried it loved it. I followed the recipe exactly I just cut back on the sugar because I knew the peaches I had was very sweet. Thanks for sharing! Definately will make again."
"1","5","This is a great recipe. I followed exactly as written and it turned out fantastic!"
"1","4","Delicious"
"1","5","What a wonderful cobbler! I had some fantastic fresh peaches on hand, so I lowered the sugar that is mixed in with the peaches to just a 1/4 cup (all brown). The topping was the best peach topping I've had: light and moist (not biscuity), perfectly spiced, and just the right sweetness."
"1","5","I was a little skeptical of the look, which I think that was my own error with the topping, but the end result was delicious!"
"1","4","this was my first attempt at a cobbler. I usually make crumbles. I thought cobblers were supposed to be bready or cake like so i dont get those complaints. mine turned out just like a crumble however. I followed the recipe exactly, but the peaches i used were HUGE so i think that made the difference. we really liked it though. it was kinda soupy, but not too bad. i can see how it would have been too sweet if i didn't have the amount of peaches i did but not bad."
"1","5","very good. Not a lot of topping though... will probably double topping next time."
"1","5","yum! this was my first cobbler ever and it was easy and tastes amazing! i did have to use nectarines instead of peaches (because that's what i had on hand) and i can only imagine it's even tastier with the peaches. as other reviewers suggested, i shortened the topping baking time (i did 20 mins). next time i will take other reviewers' advice and make more topping because the topping is amazing and i want more of it! but the recipe as it is is awesome! p.s another reviewer suggested boiling the fruit first to make the skin slip off and it worked like a charm! thanks!"
"1","5","I made this recipe for my Wednesday night church group and everyone raved about it. This is the best Peach Cobbler recipe I have found. I did double the toppping mix because I love the topping and it was perfact. must try!"
"1","5","One of the best cobblers I have ever tried, at home *or* at a restaurant!   I left the skins on and had to make 1 1/2 times the topping called for because our peaches were huge! Other than that, no changes. Great recipe, you will not be disappointed! :)"
"1","5","It was great! Easy to follow! We loved it!"
"1","5","Very good! The recipe says it's 4 servings but I think it's more like 8 (especially if eaten with a little vanilla ice cream on the side). I think I would have preferred more topping so I think I'll try doubling that next time."
"1","5","My husband says 'The best dessert ever!'"
"1","5","Will be making this again soon - everyone loved it. I reduced the sugar throughout as the peaches were sweet to start. Delicious!"
"1","4","This recipes was a hit. I was told that they were going to slap me and also reach back 3 generations and slap them as well. My husband even said that the cobbler was realllllly goood he had to go out and get some ice cream for it. And that is the way he finished it off........."
"1","5","WOW, I'm going to buy really ripe peaches more often just so I can make this! I used all brown sugar in the topping and forgot the cinnamon sugar- but it didn't need it. With fresh, chunky peaches and good vanilla ice cream I'm not sure I can think of a dessert I'd rather eat...and I LOVE chocolate so that's saying something!"
"1","5","I made it exactly as recipe states, was great. First time ever eating or tasting peach cobbler though."
"1","5","Made a double batch because I have a gazillion juicy white peaches from my tree. (Double batch didn't put a dent in my harvest- but I digress.) Great recipe- delish. Made it exact to spec. Cinnaminny ... and definitely southern taste and feel- like something you would get in a bed and breakfast. Yum :)"
"1","5","Thank you, thank you, thank you. After using a recipes from the other recipe site, both were a mess, I found this recipe!  EXCELLENT"
"1","5","We loved this recipe! I did make a few changes: we had to substitute lime juice for lemon and flour for cornstarch because that's what we had on hand. I also added a cup of oats to the peach mixture and 1/4 cup of oats to the topping mixture. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the fruit mixture as well. Served with cool-whip and it was amazing. The sauce caramelizes very nicely. I will definetly make this again."
"1","5","Awesome recipe! Stayed moist and delicious days after. Would cut down on sugar just a bit. Fantastic, will make again. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","I got the BEST reactions to this recipe! It was so yummy! We loved it and I plan to make it again!"
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh peaches. It was okay and had a good taste. The consistence of the 'dough' was disappointing as it was mealy or crumbly. After seeing all the rave reviews I expected something better."
"1","4","This recipe was good to me. I used dark brown sugar, maybe next time i will go with light. Also with the flour/dough mixture I made an extra batch and made a bottom crust out of it. I spooned it on the bottom of baking dish and cookes for ten minutes then I put the peaches in!!!!! I'm a crust lover!"
"1","4","This was very tasty but I would caution bakers to check the cobbler frequently - the top of mine burnt before the alloted time (my fault - just a cautionary word.)"
"1","5","This was my first time making peach cobbler. It came out delicious. I added a little more lemon juice, 2 tsp total, as I like things a little less sweet. My husband detests butter so I used coconut oil which I keep in the fridge. I took it out a few hours before so it wasn't rock hard. The results were great. The topping even has a hint of coconut. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious!!"
"1","5","WOWZERS! This was nothing short of perfect!"
"1","5","We had a lot of peaches, so we doubled everything and had a very nice cobbler for our dinner party."
"1","5","I added 50% more topping, and used slightly underripe peaches that were on sale. Still turned out AWESOME! Just add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you've got a delicious dessert. Thanks!"
"1","2","Unfortunately...an maybe I did something wrong, don't know....but this turned out to be too cake-like. Was hoping it would be more of a fruit slump...a term I first heard about from 'Good Foord w/o Meat' in 1974....LOL!"
"1","5","This is the perfect end of summer treat before school starts. We live in the chicagoland area and drove up to Michigan with my girls and picked the peaches right off the trees. (Red Havens are recommended for peach cobbler) My peaches did seem small so I ended up using 10 peaches instead of 8. I did not want more cake than peaches. Be careful with these peaches tho because when ripe they are very delicate and messy. Also, I only used 2 TBLS of sugar for the topping instead of 3. As I was sprinkling it on, 2 TBLS felt like it was enough for me. We ate it with vanilla bean flavored ice cream. I will be peach picking and making this cobbler an annual tradition from now on. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","This is a fantastic cobbler. The top tastes like nothing I've had on a cobbler before. The only change I made was to substitute apple pie spice for the nutmeg. It was delicious. Next time I may add just a pit more cornstarch. Topped with coolwhip, it is perfection!"
"1","5","Cobbler doesn't get any better than this. Delicious~"
"1","5","Woe baby! Yum, Yum and Yum. Definately a keeper as is...if you get the right size dish, there won't be any problems with the amount of topping. Served to guests who requested the recipe! Will try with some other kinds of fruit. I've been looking for a great cobbler recipeand this is it; thank you for a great recipe!"
"1","5","Really easy to make and probably the best peach cobbler I've ever made (at least my husband says so!). I used fresh picked peaches and agree with the reviewer that you can increase the amount of peaches and it works just as well, without changing the amount of other ingredients (especially when they're ripe and you don't want to waste them). I also reduced the sugars in the peaches a little bit since my peaches were so ripe and sweet and it was just perfect."
"1","5","Made this yesterday afternoon and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! It did take me quite a bit longer than the time listed though, and I followed nearly all the directions to the letter. As per other reviewers, I made 1.5 servings of the topping and it came out just perfect (I think doubling would have been too much). I was originally worried about the filling being too watery, but it turned out gooey and perfect - not runny at all! A must-make recipe for anybody who loves peach cobbler."
"1","5","Made just as recipe states and it was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","4","Perfect and simple cobbler recipe to use when peaches are in season and are ripening too fast for you to eat them. I used 6 large and ripe peaches which was plenty. Pared the skin with a knife. There is enough butter crumble mixture to cover about 3/4 of the top (which I think is traditional for a cobbler). So if you want more, make more. It is everyone's favorite part! Everything turned out great! Only used about half of the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top. My peaches were plenty sweet on their own."
"1","5","This really is a great dessert! The most time consuming part is blanching, peeling, pitting and slicing the peaches, but it's well worth it! I made mine in an extra large fiesta bowl and it was the perfect size. I needed about 6 minutes less cooking time than the recipe called for. I'll definitely be making this one again. :-)"
"1","5","This was great! Fast, easy and absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","Never made a cobbler before, it turned out excellent! I saw all the sugar and decided to subsitute honey for the white sugar in the peach sauce. It turned out great!"
"1","5","Very Very Good. All of it was gone before I could go back for seconds."
"1","5","This is fantastic. I cut my peaches chunkier as other reviewers have suggested. I also added just a little bit of almond extract."
"1","5","VERY good!"
"1","5","I have no natural talent for baking so it is something I rarely do. But this recipe was so easy and delicious. It appeased a range of palates and I couldn't be happier! It was gone in less than 2 days. Thank you."
"1","5","Really awesome, especially served with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream."
"1","4","My dad brought home a whole box of peaches a few days ago and they were badly in need of being used. So I went online and looked up peach cobbler recipes and found this one. Made it in two hours (had to slice the peaches). Instead of 8 peaches I used 10 and had ample amount of fruit. I don't like nutmeg so I didn't use it and I doubled the topping and it came out great. I gave this recipe four stars because so many changes were made to the recipe. So use as much fruit as you want, use 4 tsp of cornstarch, and 8 tsp of butter. Thanks for sharing!  ~Hayley~"
"1","5","YUM! I actually used canned peaches (the fresh peach crop wasn't so hot around here this year), and didn't have enough. So, I added some canned pears as well. The end result was still fantastic!"
"1","5","This couldn't have been better. I had to use 6 peaches because that's all I had. I used about 3/4 tsp baking powder instead of the whole tsp. Since I only had a round 9' cake pan to bake this in, the topping was sufficient. However, if I baked it in a wider pan next time, I'd use 1.5 x the ingredients for the topping."
"1","2","Way to sweet and not as biscuit like as I was hoping for. I'll keep looking"
"1","5","great recipe!"
"1","5","Very good. I doubled the cornstarch but my peaches were very ripe."
"1","5","This was so good. I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks."
"1","5","This is an outstanding peach cobbler! I increased the dough for the topping by about half based on the other reviews. I used only about half the sugar the recipe called for and it was still plenty sweet. I useed tapioca startch instead of cornstarch. The nutmeg and cinnamon really give the peaches a nice flavor and the topping is soooo yummy. And don't cut down on the butter - that's what makes it so good!"
"1","5","Made this just as the recipe is written. Very good cobbler!"
"1","4","This was my first time making homemade cobbler, it was good. Maybe less baking powder next time, very cake like crust."
"1","5","I'm originally from south Georgia and love southern cooking. My dear deceased BigMama use to make peach cobbler that was out of this world. Last weekend, I purchased Georgia peaches from a produce stand in New Jersey and decided I would try to find a recipe similar to hers. I found this recipe and make it last night for dinner. My son, husband, and myself ate all of it within only a few minutes. It was DELICIOUS! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with everyone."
"1","5","I did not add the baking powder and it turned out like my grandmothers old fashion dumpling style cobbler. It was great!!"
"1","5","Delicious! I followed the recipe with no changes & we loved it! I served it hot right out of the oven with a big scoop of french vanilla icecream. The next time I make it (& I WILL be making it again!) I will watch the time closer. After 25 minutes it was a little too brown on top. Excellent recipe!"
"1","4","I made this for our Father's Day bbq but added raspberries with the peaches. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I'll definitely be making it again."
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it was superb!"
"1","5","Delicious and easy. I will be making this one again!"
"1","5","THE BEST. 'Nuff said!"
"1","5","I made this a few weeks ago and then last night m husband requested I make 'that peach stuff' and this is what he was referring to! This is delicious and can be made with other fruit. I double the topping and it turns out great!"
"1","5","LOVE THIS!!!   My only changes (based on looking through the other reviews) -   - did a little less than the necessary sugar - 4 teaspoons cornstarch rather than 2 - 8 tablespoons of butter rather than the 6  AND I did 2.5 times the topping... my family likes topping a lot. I think 2 times would be sufficient for normal, non-Georgia natives :)   I think I may do 3 teaspoons cornstarch next time... but it could just be that the edges aren't very 'juicy.'  I'm a southern girl - born and raised. I come from a long line of natural born Southerners - and this recipe is THE recipe we always made when I was younger, but we lost the recipe.   Enjoy!"
"1","5","Very easy recipe!!!! I changed this recipe by not doing the topping, instead I used refrigerated cinnamon rolls!!! I baked the peaches uncovered 20 minutes, the added the cinnamon rolls for another 10-15minutes until golden, iced the cinnamon rolls and WHOLA!!! It was very diffrent and everyone who ate it wanted the recipe!!!! Always look outside the box, that is where the best recipes come from!!!"
"1","5","Im not normally a big peach cobbler fan because I don't like 'pie crust' type desserts. This one was perfect! I loved it! It had more of a cake like texture. I made it with fresh peaches and it couldn't have been better."
"1","5","This was the best cobbler we ever tasted!! We loved the topping!! Thank you!"
"1","4","This is delicious! The topping is kind of like a cakey pie crust. The peach mixture was pretty sweet...I might cut down on the sugar next time. Would make this again for sure!"
"1","5","have made more than 10 times the way its wrote hear and a little twist of my own by adding ginger gave it a even better kick"
"1","5","This cobbler was amazing!! Wasn't sure it would be since I used fresh peaches out of season, but everyone adored it! The top was crispy, sweet perfection, and the peaches didn't have that weird 'bite' to them like most cobblers do. Will definitely add this to my cookbook at home!"
"1","1","crust was foamy. filling was runny. this is the first recipe on this site that was a disaster."
"1","5","I doubled the recipe and cut back on the sugar - I figure I can always shake some cinnamon sugar on top if it is not sweet enough. I used peaches I had frozen. It turned out great - got lots of compliments."
"1","3","I didn't have any fresh peahes so used 2 bags of frozen peaches. I had to add extra 2 tsp of cornstarch since the batter wasn't really thick enough. It was not bad cobbler but I personally like more crunchy toppings."
"1","5","I made this recipe for 25 people, did not have access to fresh Georgia peaches, used can peaches unfortunately, and Oh, my gosh was it heavenly! Of course everyone will not be pleased but 2 out of 25 unhappy people are excellent numbers! :-) The unhappy peoples' complaints were that 1)'I never seen dough that thick on cobbler before', 2)'It's not how real southerners make it, but it was still good'. Everyone else loved everything about it, the dough, the peaches, the flavoring! This was my first time making anything from scratch, so thank you very much!"
"1","4","I was searching for a recipe for a cobbler that had just the right amount of 'cobbler crust' for me. I took the advise of a few others and doubled the crust recipe so that i had enough to cover the top and boy was i delightfully pleased with the end results. I also used 2 cans peaches in heavy syrup and instead reduced the sugar of the recipe slightly. I would definitely make this again."
"1","5","This peach cobbler was to die for and easy to make too!"
"1","4","I doubled my measurements for the topping, and added ginger to the peach filling. Gives it a lil sumtin sumtin. VERY tasty."
"1","5","This is a wonderful recipe. Looks just like the picture! I subsituted the sugar with Splenda brown sugar (3/4 c) and it turned out wonderful! Added a extra peaches too :-)"
"1","5","I really loved this recipe. I made it exactly as shown and it was wonderful. I might add it was my first time ever making peach cobbler. I am looking forward to trying it with different fruits. I think you could use apples or Blackberries and it would still be great..."
"1","5","WOW.... I took this to our family reunion and everyone loved it! I did cut down on the lemon juice and added 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour to the peaches. IT WAS A HIT!"
"1","5","By far the best peach cobbler I have ever made! The only thing I did differently is instead of sprinkling cinnamon sugar on the top I used coarse sugar."
"1","5","This is my standard peach cobbler recipe. I like to increase the recipe and use a 9x13-inch pan. I double all filling ingredients; however, since I'm a sucker for cobbler topping, I triple the dough ingredients. I can't imagine ever using another peach cobbler recipe. Perfection."
"1","2","I tried this recipe after all the rave reviews, but sadly I thought it was less than wonderful. It came out really pretty, but bland bland. The crust was a bit flavorless, maybe it was the flour? The filling was just OK. I used fresh ripe, Colorado peaches which are yummy! But not even my husband liked this recipe and he loves every dessert, even if it's not great. I'm going to tweak it and see how it comes out. I like the thickness of the crust, just not the flavor."
"1","5","very good had requests to make it again"
"1","5","This is the best peach cobbler I have ever made. All the kids in my neighborhood see me picking my peaches and ask if I am making peach cobbler, because last year I gave them all their own little pan of it. This year my husband and I decided we are having them all over for peach cobbler and ice cream. I am also giving all my neighbors a pan of it."
"1","5","This is so delicious. Double the recipe and keep half of it all to yourself!"
"1","5","delicious. I had 5 medium sized peaches that were very ripe so I didn't need all the sugar. The cake mixture amount was perfect for the 5 peaches, if I had more I definitely would have doubled it. I also did not add the extra sugar and cinnamon on top of the cake mixture. It was very good!!"
"1","5","Turned out wonderful!"
"1","5","This is my first time to rate something, This cobbler is AWESOME!! It's a keeper. Thank you!"
"1","5","BIG HIT! My mother-in-law said that it was the best peach cobbler she EVER had. Used fresh picked peaches and topped it with Pillsbury's Crescent Rolls (un-rolled) then sprinkled the white sugar and cinnamon mix over the rolls and baked it. LOVED IT!!!!"
"1","5","Five stars for this one!! It is just wonderful, I would add a little less sugar on top, but it is just divine!!"
"1","5","AWESOME!! made it for my girlfriend & she loves peach cobbler! she ate the whole pan and barely wamted to share. this recipe is a must. I used canned peaches in heavy syrup & still folowed all ingredients & it turned out great. just be sure not to put all the heavy syrup juice in the pan because it will overflow! GOODLUCK! DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","This cobbler is absolutely fantastic! The topping is soooo good that I may try it with an apple cobbler or other fruit. I followed other reviews and made about 1.5 times the topping. I used about 10 smaller peaches. . .and it was perfect. Even Ohio peaches make a wonderful dessert!"
"1","3","I'm not sure why but my cobbler burned with the sugar topping. I don't see any other reviews that mention this so I wonder what I did wrong. It doesn't say to turn down the oven temp after the initial 10 minutes of baking. After scraping off the burnt part of the topping, it tasted good and no one knew covered in ice cream!"
"1","3","Not the topping I was expecting when eating a peach cobbler. Not horrible tasting, but I'll try other recipes before I make this one again."
"1","4","This was a great recipe to take to a picnic, everyone loved it...I did double the toping recipe for the peaches, it was not enough! I would forgo the surgar mix on the top if using fresh peaches, it is not necessary and browns to quickly."
"1","5","love it"
"1","5","um. wow. i halved the recipe because i had 4 peaches. and this recipe is insanely delicious."
"1","5","I would have to agree with an earlier comment about increasing the amount of toping. I had only 5 peaches left that needed to be used and the amount of toping was perfect for the smaller dish. Otherwise excellent!"
"1","5","oh my goodness! this is one delicious cobbler!!! this was my first attempt at making a peach cobbler and i got rave reviews all around. i followed the recipe as is except for a few exceptions: more peaches ( i think i used 10 and wish i had used more!), 3-4 teaspoons of cornstarch, and from reading other reviews, made 1 1/2 of the topping ( i didn't double it). i didn't think the cobbler was too sweet with the amt of sugar listed....and my non-sweet tooth husband didn't either. you will not be disappointed with this recipe!!!!"
"1","5","My husband said it was the best peach cobbler he had ever had. The peaches came right off our tree, so super ripe and delicious, the cobbler part was like cookies, crispy and light, not all soggy. I did do 1 1/2 recipe of the topping using raw sugar, after reading another review. First cobbler that could stand on it's own and not rely on ice cream or something. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","YummmmmO! This was really good. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 c. and used sucanat instead of the white and brown sugar. in the peach mixture. I used about 12 peaches so I also increased the cornstarch to 3 tsp. I also used sucanat in the topping and doubled the topping. I'm glad I did. I was delicious! It was crunchy on the top from the cinnamon and sugar and tender underneath. Can't wait to make again."
"1","5","Absolutely Amazing! I have a peach tree in my backyard and everyone in my family gets so excited when it's that time of the year again to make this cobbler! I usually need to alter the recipe to make more topping because I usually use about 50 peaches!"
"1","5","This was the recipe I'd been looking for. I did 1 1/2 times the topping, and it was almost too much, but not quite--go figure. Added 1/2 cup flour to the sugar and peaches to thicken the juice, and it was just right. Next time I would increase the peaches just a little and still 1 1/2 times the topping. Was delicious warm with vanilla ice cream!!"
"1","5","Delicious! I added 1 extra teaspoon of cornstarch based on the other reviews. Perfect!"
"1","5","What a great peach cobbler recipe. I made it exactly as shown and the only thing I might change the next time is to make more of the cobbler topping. I like a higher cake to fruit ratio, but this was great as it is. I tried what another reviewer suggested about scalding the peaches and then plunging them in ice water. Didn't work for me but my peaches could have been a little more ripe. That may have had something to do with it."
"1","5","This was a really good and easy recipe - haven't made peach cobbler in years, and was anxious to find a good one. (It is sometimes difficult to find peaches in the grocery stores which will ripen properly - without just shriveling up before they even get ripe.) Had 8 large-ish peaches sliced and ready to go the night before, which saved me time putting the cobbler together yesterday. I wondered about using boiling water, after using chilled butter in the mix - so used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk instead, as I normally do. The brown sugar in the 'cobble' was a nice addition for flavor! I did make extra 'cobble', as I used a 13 X 9 X 2 pan...I doubled it, but 1 1/2 times the recipe would have been just right for us. My husband, who loves homey desserts, was delighted with this cobbler - served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, of course!! Will most definitely make this again soon!"
"1","5","double sugar"
"1","5","I can't believe I made this!! I stepped back in time 30 years to my childhood in KY!!! This cobbler is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and I'm sure it won't last once the family gets home."
"1","5","This recipe was wonderful!!! I usually edit recipes I find on this site as per other users recommendations. But I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it was fantasitc. The topping was very cake-like - it was delicious! I liked the topping to peaches ratio, although if you especially like topping you could increase it. I thought the amount of sugar was perfect. The only change I would make for next time would be to increase the cornstarch. I did have extra liquid. But we poured it over the vanilla ice cream and it tasted great! I'll be making this recipe again!!"
"1","5","I didn't change a thing! Yummy! I especially like the topping, it was nice and fluffy."
"1","5","Followed the recipe with the exception of only using about 1 Tablespoon of sugar over the top with the cinnamon. Very yummy!"
"1","5","I made this last night just as the recipe read. It was a total hit. Make sure the peaches are fresh and ripe and this is a no fail delicious and easy to follow recipe"
"1","5","Excellent recipe!! Easy to make and the comments about cooking time are just right. The cobbler cooks about 30 minutes to get golden brown. My husband asked for this to be made again just a few days from when I first made it. I only made it with fresh peaches."
"1","4","This was so easy and YUMMY!! Just made it today with fresh peaches and it couldn't have been better. I didn't need to pre-cook the peaches for 10 minutes because they were really ripe and already soft enough. Just baked for 30 minutes."
"1","5","Great recipe. So easy to make. Used ripe peaches and fresh lime juice. My family loved it."
"1","5","Made with white peaches from Carrefour---perfect!"
"1","5","I'm just learning to cook and was genuinely surprised that I had cooked this myself as it was so tasty and easy to do."
"1","5","Fabulous recipe! I used an equal amount of Splenda for Baking in place of the white sugar, and half the amount of Splenda Brown Sugar, as my husband is a diabetic with a sweet tooth-he couldn't get enough! Still have some fresh Georgia peaches, so I'm making it for the second time this week! Thanks for sharing this!"
"1","2","dough isn't the greatest and the mixture to toss around the peaches doesn't tastes the greatest either. I'll try a different cobbler recipe."
"1","5","This is amazing!!! The topping is light and crispy and the filling is perfect! Thanks for an amazing cobbler!!"
"1","2","Maybe somehow I did my calulations incorrect but I used 2 cans of peaches instead of fresh peaches because it was all i had and this same out very dry and crispy. Even with using the canned peaches i dont see how this would come out very good. The crumble covers the entire cobbler and it becomes thick and very cake like and then there is not very much filling on the inside. I was dissapointed with this recipe and will not try it again"
"1","5","Yum Yum and more Yum! I doubled the filling recipe and it STILL wasn't enough. The crust topping was a little too moist, I would recommend half of the amount of water for it. Recipe is a Keeper!"
"1","5","This was the first time I made a cobbler of any kind, and I am so glad I chose this recipe!!! Thumbs WAY UP! Loved it."
"1","5","THIS IS A KEEPER we were going to a 4th of July party and needed to bring dessert. WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE to find this Southern Peach Cobbler recipe. It sounded so good and it turned out better than expected. I doubled the recipe and it wasn't enough. It was go good everyone actually ate it before the main course."
"1","5","This is the best Peach Cobbler. My family loved it. We used fresh NC peaches and they were great."
"1","4","Overall this recipe was very good but way too sweet for me. If I make this again, I would ease up on the amount of sugar. I love the topping, I feel it balances out the sweetness."
"1","4","Overall this recipe was good. I added 1/4 to 2/3 cup of oats to the flour&sugar mixture. Since i also had some raspberries, i added a handful of them as well. It wasn't too sweet or too bitter!"
"1","5","I used fresh peaches which took quite a while. Did not have enough to feed our family of 5. family loved the crunchy crust on this cobbler. May try canned peaches next time to cut down on time to make. Not overly sweet which was nice for a change"
"1","5","used fresh picked apricots instead. Perfect!!!!!!"
"1","5","I bought some fresh peaches and paid a fortune for them....$2.99/lb. I was debating whether to make a pie or try a cobbler to get the most from these expensive beauties! I happened to find this recipe and based on all the rave reviews I gave it a try instead of a pie! What a delicious dessert! I didn't have fresh lemon juice so I used my bottled stuff but I did grate fresh cinnamon and nutmeg which added remarkable flavor to the filling. I followed the recipe as stated and it is fantastic just the way it is written. I do understand why some readers said to increase the topping either by 50% or even to double it .....it IS that good! I can't wait to try it with blueberries next!"
"1","5","This was almost exactly what I was looking for. I only wish I had picked better peaches. I used a 9X9 and had plenty of topping."
"1","5","Love this cobbler, but the first time I made it the topping was too dark for my liking. Baked the second at 375, and it came out totally perfect. Served it to my guests last night with the ice cream and ended up sending some home with them. They loved it. One other note. I have a Ninja Food Prep machine that I use to cut in my butter. Cut the butter up real small, add to the mixture and with 6 pulses the butter is cut in perfectly."
"1","5","OH MY GOSH! This was sooo delicious!! After it was just baked and still hot we topped with whipped cream and had a side of vanilla frozen yogurt and it was soooo good! I DON'T like peaches but I loved this cobbler! Right out of the oven it was sweet and tasty. After sitting for a few hours my third helping was super sugary-I guess letting it sit for a while after sweetens it up even more. I prefer it straight out of the oven but still loved it when it was super sugary sweet as well. The only downside is that peach cobbler goes fast in a family of 5 and I need to double this recipe next time. Also the crust (which was super delicious) recipe needs to be doubled to cover the entire pie generously. I waited to put the cinnamon and sugar topping on until 10 minutes before it was done. I also doubled the cinnamon sugar topping so that it would be plenty to cover. Make this recipe-it's DELISH!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","This was great!! My whole family loved it. I loved the the crumbly cake-like texture. I was looking for a cobbler to make from scratch, and this was easy to follow. I felt like a gourmet chef. :) But next time I'll used canned peaches. Though there was nothing wrong with it, preparing fresh peaches is A LOT of work for a busy mom. And once cooked, they taste the same as good quality canned peaches. But this recipe is great, and I'll be making it again. Also, I tripled the cinnamon. We like cinnamon in this house!"
"1","5","This was soooo good. I used canned peaches instead of fresh ones. We all loved it and I will defanetly make it again."
"1","5","I have made this 5 times now. It's sooo good! I made it again today. Peaches are not in season and they were not even that ripe. It still turned out great!! Thank you so much for this recipe. My family and I love it!"
"1","5","Made it tonight and it's all gone now! It was very easy to make and came out delicious. I made no changes. I used about 9 peaches or so, basically it filled up the bottom of a 9x13 pan. The crust was simple too. Maybe my only change would be to make more crust (it was good!). I'll be making it again maybe tomorrow!"
"1","5","This was my first attempt at a peach cobbler. Per my husband, it was as good as his grandmother's. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It is definitely a keeper. I used some of the peaches I canned in lite syrup this summer. So I reduced the first stage cook down to 6 min. instead of ten. Could not have been easier!"
"1","5","Very good! Made recipe as written and it came out perfect! I had to use canned peaches (29 oz drained) because it is now winter where I live. I also threw in some leftover frozen blueberries with the peaches, wow how good!"
"1","5","Very, very good. My husband who does not typically like cobblers was a big fan too."
"1","5","This was my first cobbler and me and my hubby were blown away with how amazing it came out. I followed the recipe except for the fact that i left out the lemon juice (i didn't have any) and i only used about 1/4 tsp of salt because i use salted butter. The best cobbler hands down, must try!"
"1","5","Family loved it!"
"1","5","I am giving this recipe a 5 star since it worked with my adjustments. I substituted a mix of splenda and truvia for white sugar since that is all I had. It came out great. I am still searching for a recipe with a crusty crust."
"1","5","This was fantastic just as written. I will probably reduce the sugar that goes on top next time, but this was a huge hit! Thanks for making my first cobbler a success!"
"1","5","This was absolutely WONDERFUL! I made it just as the recipe stated. It was completely gone in 30 minutes LOL...will def be making this for more occasions!"
"1","3","This was good but not great. I love fresh peaches and was expecting something fantastic. After cooking the peaches they tasted like canned peaches. The topping was a little too sweet. I think I will end up sticking with fresh berry cobbler. The fruit taste so much fresher with a little bit of tartness."
"1","4","This was good and not difficult to make. It was the first time I had made cobbler, and the first time my family had eaten it (not too common in Canada, I think). The cooking time was too long for my oven, so it was a little burned on the top, and I would reduce the sugar a little the next time, but otherwise it was good. Thanks!"
"1","5","My mother was going to an ice cream social and wanted to take along a dessert. This was a HUGE success!!! Everyone loved it, I've made it a couple of times and my mother has also made it a couple more times since."
"1","5","it may not look the prettiest if serving to guests for a more formal 'do' but who cares.... this is to die for. screw the guests, you'll want this all for yourself! thanks! You MUST pair this with a scoop or 2 of real french vanilla ice cream - theres a big difference between plain o vanilla and french. mmmmm mmm mmmmmm"
"1","5","my husband has made this twice and it is AWEWSOME!!! so good. wonderful. excellent. and don't even think about making it unless you have vanilla ice cream on hand to serve with it. absolutely the best peach cobbler we've ever had."
"1","4","Made this for a Southern friend who loves peach cobblers and he gave 4 stars. The topping is flaky, cake-like, yet dense and really good. I will use the topping for pies and other fruits."
"1","5","Perfect!"
"1","5","Excellent dish. Easy to make. Simply delicious. The only change I made was to add some ripe plums we had laying around and this added excellent flavor and color to the recipe. Yum. I can't wait to make this and eat it again."
"1","4","I made this recipe last night, and the taste was awesome. The only problem I had with it, is in the 1/2 hr after the topping was on, the topping was going very dark, yet when we ate it a couple hours later the dough closest to the fruit wasn't cooked, still wet. But a very tasty recipe, I have copied it into my own book!!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious and so easy to throw together. For those of you who might not know, to easily peel peaches, first scald them for a minute in boiling water. Take them out of the pan and immediately rinse with cold water. Skin will slip right off. I may have to go buy some more peaches, this recipe rocks!"
"1","5","I should have known to double this recipe. It was gone in 1 hour. Nice way to use up a lot of peaches. Definitely double the amount of corn starch. I would not reduce the amount of sugar. UPDATE:If doubling, use 2 2 qt dishes. My large batch was uncooked under the topping, yuck."
"1","5","This is a fantastic peach cobbler recipe. I made it with fresh peaches picked from a farm that were just ripe but not too watery. I followed other advise and used a little extra corn starch and less sugar but otherwise followed the rest of receipe as is. Came out extremely well. The topping was just yummmmm"
"1","4","everyone loved this, i would double the dough mix and up the cornstarch as some other members suggested"
"1","5","Oh my goodness!! I did just like the suggestions said and added a bit more corn starch and did 1 ½ times the topping. Go with fresh firm peaches if you can – it always makes a difference. It turned out fantastic! I didn’t get to take a picture… it had a “taste test” to make sure it was perfect for my guests later today… You will not be disappointed with this one folks! This one is worth that extra time on the tread mill."
"1","5","My motto is butter is better, but I had no butter when making this so I substituted Smart Balance Light with hesitation. To my suprise it turned out wonderfully. So if you would like to cut the fat in half try it! But I guess cutting the calories doesn't help if you still end up eating half the pan. Delicious!!!"
"1","5","I made this for a dinner party and it was the rave. Very tasty. However, if this makes 4 serviings for the submitter s/he must be serving 4 line backers from the Miami Dolphins. I got 6-8 servings out of it."
"1","4","Excellent!!! Only complaint was that there wasn't enough batter to put ontop, will double that part of the recipe next time. I too went easy on the sugar/cin last step. Mmmm, very good!!!"
"1","4","Pretty good. The cobbler dough came out too wet and thin, but overall it tasted good. It did not keep well, and I would recommend eating it the same day it is baked."
"1","5","Excellent just as is. I made mine in a 9x12 pan. What I did not do was skin the peaches. No need and too much work. My organic peaches (including skin) baked up nicely and made a delicious cobbler!"
"1","5","I am not a cobbler fan. My husband loves cobbler so I made it for him because of our peach tree. Wow I can honestly say I am now a cobbler fan. Wonderful!"
"1","5","Fantastic! I used peaches that were no where near ripe, but they cooked and were just as juicy and soft as they were supposed to be. The topping was delish! It was a little more crust- like, and a little less cake-like, which is exactly what I wanted. I think the sugar/cinnamon sprinkled on the top made all the difference. Mmmmm, I'm gonna go get another piece!"
"1","4","This came out very good. However, it was very sweet! I chose this recipe over others because it seemed to call for less sugar than others. Mine did come out a little runny too. I put a little vanilla ice cream over it and that did the trick! If I make this again I will add a little more cornstarch and less sugar."
"1","5","This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have quite enough peaches, so I added blueberries and made it into Berry Peach Cobbler. My entire family devoured it and begged me to make more the next day. The topping is quite yummy. And it is great when it's hot, and also quite tasty after a day in the fridge."
"1","5","So easy and yummy! I added fresh blackberries for a bit of tart. Everyone loved it with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","Great recipe. I have made it twice now, and it got great reviews both times."
"1","5","This was a great tasting cobbler. I will keep this one in my recipe box..Thanks"
"1","5","I have never made Peach Cobbler and decided to give this one a try and glad I did. My husband's exact words were, 'this is the bomb'!!! I will be making this again. I made the recipe exactly as stated."
"1","5","This is one fantastic recipe! I made it exactly like the recipe described and it was perfect .. I would not change a thing. It was so good my husband told me it would win a prize in a contest. If it were me, I would follow the recipe to a tee the first time you make it, then alter it based on your taste . .. but until you make it the original way, you won't know how good it is!! (And I totally disagree with those that say there is too much sugar - it is a dessert and should be sweet!!)"
"1","5","Turned out great the first time I made it. Just a few changes; used sugar/sucralose blends for both white and brown sugar amounts, you should add half the amount called for. I also used soy margarine instead of butter (dairy allergy.) I agree that you could make twice the cobbler topping for an even better result and of course use Georgia peaches."
"1","5","Great recipe! I followed the advice on making 1 1/2 times the amount of topping as suggested. And also the tip for getting the peeling off of the peaches worked perfectly! Thanks!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe as written - wonderful! True Southern heritage, and by the way, I live in Atlanta and used fresh Georgia peaches. Perfect."
"1","5","This was excellent! I did however forget the peaches so I had to use canned peaches (a drained 29oz can) and next time I will double the peaches. I did use only 1/3 cup of the brown and white sugar in the filling and it was plenty sweet. We loved the topping and the cobbler went great with some Blue Bell ice cream."
"1","4","Out of all the recipes on here this is by far the best as I have attempted more then a few. I have done this recipe as directed and found it had to much brownsugar, cinnamon on top and to cake like. So now make it without as much dough and holding the sugar, cinnamon. Other then that, it is the BEST!"
"1","5","This was so delicious. I made it for the 4th and there were no leftovers! Very easy also."
"1","5","This was fantastic! Also very easy! I don't even care much for peaches but went back for seconds. A perfect recipe for fresh-picked peaches."
"1","5","Fantastic! I made this recipes twice and on each occasion it was a big hit."
"1","5","Awesome. I still added an extra peach because ours were on the small size, but kept everything else the same.. Came out beautiful"
"1","5","This cobbler was delicious and loved by all."
"1","5","I recently made this recipe for a neighborhood gathering which my husband was unavailble to attend. I had to quickly set aside a small serving to take home to him because it was going so fast. Everyone absolutely loved it.  Update: After making this several times I too have made adjustments using more peaches and more corn starch. I also like to add about 2 tsp. of Vanilla extract. And, to get a better crust, I press the topping flat (not too flat) between my fingers and carefully lay the dough on top of the peaches, giving the crust has a better texture and taste. (I recommend this method to anyone who doesn't like a cake-like crust.) This recipe never fails me as a go-to crowd pleaser. I will be making it again for our family reunion coming up in September. I am so happy to have found this recipe."
"1","4","Just ate this and pretty good. I really like these 'cakey' kind of cobblers so was very pleased with that. I used peaches from last year that we'd frozen (trying to clear out the freezer)and followed the spice and sugar instructions but with a tad less sugar (especially in topping) and 4 tbls butter. Result was a tangy but sweet cobbler with thick, crusty top. Would make again."
"1","5","This was the FIRST time I made peach cobbler. It was so good I had seconds. I did use frozen peaches instead of fresh but it was great and gone in one night at my house. Easy to make....almost all ingredients one hand.....excellent taste."
"1","5","This cobbler was simply the best I have ever eaten! DH LOVED it; said the filling reminded him of his grandma's, although she used a piecrust instead. I froze a small portion to see if it freezes well--4 servings filled a 2 qt. dish! 4 servings for giants? LOL! DH just wished I had bought vanilla ice cream to go with it. He gave it a 10! I would definitely make this for company. A KEEPER!!!!!!!"
"1","4","Overall flavor was great, however the dough was a overwhelming - will use more peach mixture or less dough next time."
"1","5","I first made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it, so at the request of everyone I made it again for Christmas, it was a big hit both times. I think my boyfriend is a little jealous because he usually makes peach cobbler but it doesn't taste like this!! Thanks. I'll post a pic of it. I also wanted to add that I didn't use fresh peaches I used 3 cans of Del Monte peaches (drained) and I also doubled the topping it didn't seem like enough."
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and everytime a potluck something for the kids school comes up, this is always requested. Fresh peaches are great but can be just as easily prepared with canned (drained) peaches when fresh are not in season. I always double the topping because my family loves that part! I will continue to keep this recipe in my family!"
"1","5","Amazing! Truly a great recipe!"
"1","5","My family loved this."
"1","5","This cobbler is the best ever. I didnt change anything. It makes me wish peaches were in season all the time."
"1","5","Having never made a cobbler or pie before I was nervous about messing it up. But the peaches at the Monterey farmers market were irresistable and my husband (having grown up two hours from Georgia) loves peach cobbler. Everyone adored it."
"1","5","This is so delicious! Even my peach hating husband loved it!"
"1","5","Loved it! Took it to a get together with friends and they loved it. Doubled the recipe to serve 8 but didn't need to. That's a lot of peaches to peel(boiling water tip helped). Would like more crust/dough so I will make more of that next time. Enjoy!"
"1","5","After many tries at making Peach Cobbler the way I remember...this recipe helped me perfect it. It's just they way I remember."
"1","4","This is a great comfort food, my family raved about it. My only issue is that it is a bit on the runny side but could have been the juicyness of the fruit. I have made it twice and loved it."
"1","5","I used flour in place of cornstarch, didn't use the nutmeg or baking powder and doubled the amounts everything in the topping and everyone loved it! I didn't use those ingredients only because I didn't happen to have them.  I love this recipe! The topping tastes like Mrs. Smiths crumb topping on the pies you'd get at the super market."
"1","5","delish and very easy to make. loved the topping."
"1","4","I found making this in a more shallow pan spread the topping out better. In a deeper dish there were too many peaches versus topping for my taste. Don't forget the sugar and cinnamon on top, makes a big difference!"
"1","5","Great tasting cobbler! I found it a bit on the runny side so next time I would add more corn starch and probably a bit less sugar topping - Would make this again for sure!"
"1","5","Increased the number of peaches to 10, and it turned out great!"
"1","5","This was so easy and delicious. I actually made it twice in one week because of unexpected company. Everyone loved it and my husband keeps asking when I'll make it again. Thank you Amy - this is one I'll make again and again."
"1","5","I had never made cobbler before but this recipe took me through step-by-step to the best cobbler I've ever tasted! It was a hit with both family and friends!"
"1","5","D-LISH...I made it as the recipe reads. best peach dessert I have ever made. Thank You!!!"
"1","4","Very yummy but very sweet!"
"1","4","This cobbler was AMAZING! Made it for Labor Day BBQ and it was a big hit. The only issue I came across was using a 2-qt dish. The 8 peaches I used must have been jumbo compared to what the recipe called for. I ended up using a 3.5 qt dish, but forgot to make more topping to compensate. It still tasted delicious, but could have used more toppig. The cinnamon was a very nice touch. Will definitely make this again, but with more topping!"
"1","5","So easy, very good! I didn't adjust the amount of corn starch and mine was perfect."
"1","4","Mine turned out to be too runny... =( But the topping on this, I love it! =)"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful! I used Colorado peaches and did the topping 1.5x as some people suggested. It was PERFECT!"
"1","5","This is a really great recipe. My husband absolutely loved it and asked for more, which is big because he's not a 'fruit person.' I followed a couple suggestions by adding 8 tbls of butter and increasing the corn starch to help set it up more. I also decreased the baking powder so the topping was more crispy and less cakey. Also, I was short on time and didn't peel the peaches and you couldn't even tell. The peaches I used were fresh home-grown and the peeling was so soft and sweet it didn't make a difference."
"1","5","This is fabuloso! I have never made anything like this and everyone, including my 9 and 12 year olds, couldn't get enough. Made exactly as written (peaches off of grandpa's tree) and served hot, with cold vanilla ice cream. Yummy!"
"1","5","very good, I will add more thickener next time, and I went with all brown sugar instead of half. Turned out really good though."
"1","5","This was delicious, however I think that there was way too much cinnamon/sugar topping. I might cut back on that next time as it was a bit too sweet for me. Other than that it was great. Serve hot with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","This peach cobbler was absolutely fantastic!! Everybody in the house loved it! I've now made it twice, the first time I made it how the recipe said to. The second time, I cut the sugar in half and used whole wheat flour and it turned out great too! Although, even with half as much sugar, it was still a little to sweet for me. Other than that, I had no problems with this recipe. It looks wonderful and tastes even better! I will definitely make it again."
"1","5","Very tasty. II had a mixture of under ripe and over ripe peaches so i used them and this sweetened them right up. I am a fan of cake like cobbler and this recipe ranks. i will definitely use it again"
"1","5","Future in laws, fiance, and I all LOVED this cobbler! I would probably add more cornstarch next time since mine didn't thicken quite as much as I would have liked. I also did 1/2 teaspoon lime juice in addition to the teaspoon of lemon juice and it added a nice little tart at the end of every bite. Oh, and cinnamon and nutmeg in everything - the peach mixture, the batter mixture, and the topping. Yum!"
"1","3","It does need a little more topping to cover the peach mixture."
"1","5","I'm picky about my cobblers and really enjoyed this one. The sugar on top made a nice sweet touch. I like the idea of the almond extract someone suggested. Best cobbler so far."
"1","5","This was a great recipe! The only thing I changed was omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have it, still turned out great. I probably cut up more than 8 fresh peaches though, it doesn't hurt to have too much. Thank you!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! I didn't change a thing. Well, I used northern peaches from my tree in the backyard and they were a bit smaller so I used about 9 peaches. I made a dish for my parents and one for my family. Everyone absolutely loved it. The dish was gone in 2 days!!!!! Great warmed up with some vanilla/carmel ice cream. Yummy. Thanks for sharing. This is a keeper. update: summer 2009. this recipe rocks. i always change recipes from this site. this one i follow to the tee and it's perfect!"
"1","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I found it works best if you double the recipe and make it in a 10x15 4 quart baking dish. When I made a single batch in a 2 quart 8x8 baking dish, the crust was a bit thick for my taste. The 10X5 size is great for a group."
"1","5","Very yummy but a little too sweet. Less sugar in filling and topping next time. Made 50% extra topping."
"1","5","This is a great recipe, I have made it twice this summer with fresh peaches, my husband usually doesn't eat cobbler, but he loves this."
"1","5","This was great. I added pecan meal to the topping and topped it off with pecans."
"1","5","This cobbler was so simple and easy to make! This will definitely be my go-to cobbler recipe for now on."
"1","5","I have tried a lot of peach cobbler recipes but this one is the best, my family loved it. I used 8 large fresh Georgia peaches which I sliced thin and I doubled the topping and put it in a 9 X 13 pan. Must try, you will not be disappointed, it is delicious."
"1","5","Made this for a party and everyone raved about it!! Will definitely make again, only next time I will double the recipe because it went so fast. Thanks for sharing!!"
"1","5","Hot Fresh peach cobbler w/ Fat Free frozen yogurt on top! Need I say more, YUMMY! Cobbler part did not rise as much as expected, but I think my b. powder is just old. Followed recipe to a T! LOVED IT! Thank you for submitting... so much better than that Bisquick mix cobbler LOL"
"1","5","Wow! Very, very good. Super easy to make if you blanch the peaches to remove the skins. Mine ended up having a bit too much saucy goo that covered the topping, which prevented the 'dough' from cooking completely. To remedy, I simply put on low broil for about 4 minutes and - tada! Will make many times over."
"1","5","Very, very good. Followed the directions exactly except added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch to the peaches. The dish was not overly sweet which I liked! It may look like there isn't enough topping but it puffs up nicely in the oven."
"1","5","Delicious. Next time I will make 1.5x the amount of the cake part, as there wasn't enough for my family's preference. I used 7 really big, almost overripe peaches and it was absolutely divine. Thanks for a keeper!"
"1","5","I just made this and it is wonderful. I have some GREAT southern cooks in my family, but this is the best peach cobbler I have ever had!"
"1","5","Followed recipe exactly. Was the best peach cobbler ever. Perfect for our 4th of July festivities!  -   Made this again for a blackberry cobbler. Left out all cinnamon and nutmeg flavors, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. SO good!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and this turned out great!! My husband loves Peach cobbler and he said this was the best he has ever had! Will make again for sure. Thanks."
"1","5","Wow, my husband loved this recipe and it was a big hit a my dinner party. Thanks! The only thing I did differently was instead of scooping the dough on top of the peaches; I took the dough in my hand and crumbled it, making several layers over the top. It resulted in a kind of crunchy dutch-apple pie type topping/crust. Love it!!!!"
"1","5","I'm not a huge peach lover but found myself with about 80 lbs of peaches after my roommate's father shipped them to her from his farm. I cut and froze the peaches in the first mixture and when we're ready for cobbler I thaw it, bake for the 10 minutes while I make the second mixture. Everyone loves this cobbler and my co-workers actually fought over it. This is the best cobbler I have ever tasted and now I look forward to this years peach delivery!"
"1","5","I made this for Father's Day, and it turned perfect. No changes here. This recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","This is the best peach cobbler I've ever had. I even impressed my boyfriend's mom with it. One of the best recipes I've ever used for anything, period!"
"1","5","The recipe is so easy to make and delicious. I did not change anything and I will make over and over again. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","This cobbler is delicious! I used frozen peaches and only about a third of the cinnamon/sugar sprinkle mixture at the end. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","I made this a few nights ago for everyone and they loved it! I used 2 large cans of peaches and it was wonderful. I will definitely make it again and try with fresh peaches when they are in season."
"1","5","My best friend (a Houston born Florida guy) and I (a Maryland born Georgia girl) made this recipe for his coworkers and it was fantastic! I am not really a fan of peach cobbler, but I definitely ate this one topped with vanilla ice cream. We made 8 servings and substituted the fresh peaches for two cans of peaches in heavy syrup, drained, and it was just fantastic! I actually joined allrecipes just to tell you how fantastic it was so keep up the good work!"
"1","5","Excellent! I made a couple changes though. I used 12 peaches instead of 8 (3 qt casserole) but didn't use more topping. Also didn't add any water - just sprinkled the topping on and baked it until the caramelized juices bubbled up in the center. I did bake it for 30 min. on middle rack - keep in mind to adjust cooking time for your elevation."
"1","5","This was a great recipe...easy to follow...and the taste was superb."
"1","5","I used fresh picked Washington peaches for the cobbler. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It was very good, not too sweet and tasted wonderful with fresh whipped cream!"
"1","5","This recipe was great. I used frozen peaches instead and I also added a little more topping as well."
"1","5","My girlfriend is from Alabama and she and her Momma takinn' certain foods very seriously - peach cobbler is one of them. I made this for them and they both LOVED it! I used canned peaches and it came out fine."
"1","3","I don't know where I went wrong. I followed all the directions. It tasted ok, but it was not that sweet. It smelled delicious, but it was not a fav at the Thanksgiving dinner. I will try it again."
"1","5","I love this! The only changes I make are to add a tiny splash of vanilla to the peach mixture and increase the butter to 8 tbsp. I also decrease the cooking time slightly as others have noted -- it gives it a wonderful cake-like texture. My friends and family ask for this cobbler all the time. I'm happy to oblige so I can eat the batter... heh! Great recipe!"
"1","5","Great Cobbler! I used frozen strawberries and sliced them, no nutmeg, otherwise everything exactly as stated---PERFECTO! Not runny at all."
"1","5","This is my first try at recipes on allrecipes. This peach cobbler is wonderful. I doubled the topping recipe. Well just because I love extra toppings anyways. This is a must try...it's sure to be a hit with the family!"
"1","5","so EASY! so affordable! so GOOD! thanks!!!"
"1","4","has a buscuit like topping. I added a little sugar to sweeten slightly, and served with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Great recipe. I combined suggestions from several other reviewers and it was delicious. I used salted butter and deleted the additional salt. I also reduced the temp. to 375 after cooking the peaches for the first 10 minutes and baked for the 30 min. I added just a tiny bit more (didn't measure - maybe 1/4 teaspoon) corn starch so it wouldn't be runny, and it wasn't. I also doubled the topping and baked in a longer pan. I think it would work well with other fruits as well."
"1","5","This was delicious. I made it a little easier by not even peeling the peaches. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T."
"1","4","It was really good, the whole family enjoyed it, even my brother, who went back for seconds. Tasted even better the second day. The topping was definitely the best part: crumbly and delicious w/ the cinnamon sugar topping. I did not find it too sweet. It was a bit soupy, but it was still really good. Easy to make, except for pealing the peaches, which was messy and annoying."
"1","5","This is my first peach cobbler and the first time I made cobbler, I love it! Easy and delicious. Thx Amy for share"
"1","5","Yum and Double Yum!!! My grandmother from Texas loved it so much it's now going to be her new cobbler recipe!!!"
"1","5","Very very good. I also did not add the water to the topping mixture. 1 1/2 times the topping would be perfect for me. Yumm"
"1","5","yummmmmmmmmmm"
"1","5","excellent!"
"1","5","This is the best peach cobbler I have ever had! Definately use fresh peaches if you can. I followed the recipe as written, but next time I think I will take the advice of other reviewers and double the topping. It was the best part! Goes great with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","This is so easy to make! My husband thinks I should open a bakery because of all the yummy desserts I find on this site. And even though he's gained a few pounds, we're happy with all the recipes I've found here. Thanks for another winner!"
"1","4","Pretty tasty. Thanks"
"1","5","Outstanding recipe, everyone raved at the scumptous taste of this fresh homemade cobbler at our family picnic.   I did not change anything on recipe, but I wish I would have tripled it instead of just doubling it, as there was not one mouthful left."
"1","5","This was great! I changed the topping from regular white sugar to raw sugar and it gave it a sweet and crunchy texture which my neighbors all loved!"
"1","4","Very tasty! I usually like more of a pie crust with my cobblers but this was nice and quick. I will make this again."
"1","5","One word: AMAZING!!!"
"1","5","great recipe thank you"
"1","5","I added more peaches as suggested earlier as well as more cinnamon and nutmeg. I'm not a big fan of peach cobbler but this was fantastic. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to make it again!"
"1","5","This is a really good peach cobbler and  very easy to make. My family LOVED it! I followed the recipe exactly as written."
"1","5","I've made this one every summer when peaches are in season for about four years, but I haven't gotten around to doing a review. This is the best cobbler recipe I've ever had and I look forward to making this each year. The ingredients listed are flawless, so I follow it exactly. I make the pastry crumble in the food processor with frozen butter. This time I forgot the sugar/cinnamon topping, but it was still excellent. The only thing off with this recipe is the calorie count and serving size. The recipe states that this makes four servings, however in a 2 liter square pan I easily get 9 average slices. There's nowhere near the fat and calorie content listed on the recipe, and it's probably less than half listed!!!"
"1","5","Fantastic! I made this cobbler twice in one week, with frest South Carolina Peaches, and it was devoured. Everyone asked me for the recipe."
"1","5","this recipe was absolutely delicious!!! I used salted butter instead of unsalted. That was my only change. Thanks!"
"1","5","I wasn't a fan of Peach Cobbler until this recipe. I loved it. TWO THUMBS UP.."
"1","5","Wonderful and super easy recipe - was looking for something to satisfy my sweet tooth and this is just it! quick and easy - try it mixed with apples - having mine right now yum! Thanks Amy!"
"1","5","So tasty and easy! Will make again soon!!"
"1","5","Just to add to the rating. This recipe is perfect just the way it is. I made no changes and it turned out great."
"1","5","All I can say is YUMMERS! I wouldn't change anything with this recipe! Excellent!"
"1","5","This was exactly what I was looking for! Thank you, thank you!!!"
"1","5","Very Fabulous! Oh so good served with vanilla/caramel ice cream."
"1","5","It was a huge hit among my friends, homesick for American comfort foods. I doubled the sauce thickener, only used brown sugar (crust was darker), added a little cinnamon to the peaches and split the cinnamon between the sugar sprinkling and the crust (thanks to all for the great suggestions). It was served, of course, a la mode, but was also good cold the next day."
"1","5","Delicious! I baked this 'better than Mom's' cobbler on my outdoor cooker/grill which has a separate firebox. I only use natural hardwood lump charcoal and NEVER any lighter fluid. I waited until the peaches just began to bubble before adding the pastry topping and 10 minutes after that before adding the sugar mixture. The topping was light and almost cake like, not soggy at all. It took a little longer than 30 minutes to be just right but well worth the wait. My search for the perfect cobbler ended with this recipe!"
"1","5","Wonderful! I'm not a experienced cook and this recipe made me look like a professional! I'm from Louisiana,so we love our peach cobbler. Tasted great!"
"1","5","This peach cobbler is so good it makes you wanna smack somebody.   I had to bake mine for 45 minutes, as 30 minutes didn't cook the cakey part in the middle. 30 mine burned the top too much, so next time I will put the glass lid or foil on top after 25 minutes of cooking.   Serve with vanilla ice cream on top.  Better than s*x!"
"1","4","I followed this recipe exactly as it was written and the end product was just OK, not great. I probably won't make it again because of how long it took to peel the peaches."
"1","4","Yum! I was given a bag of fresh peaches and used them in this dish. very yummy. I made 2 smaller portions and it was fine. The sugar on top turned the tops of the cobbler a bit to brown."
"1","5","I got suckered into buying a whole box of peaches, and needed to use some of them up. My mom and I had bad luck with a peach cobbler before (one of those recipes where you pour on two cups of boiling water), so I was hesitant. I was almost ready to try one of those again, but decrease the water, when I found this recipe. Wow! This was excellent. I actually thought it improved on sitting overnight. Oh, and I love cinnamon, so I added a little extra to the peaches, and then split the other tsp between the cobbler topping, and the cinnamon-sugar sprinkle."
"1","4","wonderful ... really loved how simple it was and the topping was spot on! Made this for my husband and almost got none for myself ... suggest serving this with ice cream ... I personaly thought there was just enough juice to make this a hit but other viewers thought there was to much ... i suggest you make it both ways befor you decide ... will make this often thanks"
"1","5","just wonderful. the cinnamon is key! I cut the sugar back a bit because my peaches were very ripe, and it was perfect. We topped with Haagen Dazs Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. My guests devoured it in minutes! I'll double the crust next time - it was the the best part! Crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inner. mmm.... I used mostly yellow peaches with a few nice white ones thrown in there. This one is a keeper and the only peach cobbler recipe I'll ever use. Thanks a million!"
"1","5","I had alot of peaches given to me by my grandmother and didn't know what to do with them. Tried this recipe and loved it. Family Favorite and will definitely make it again!!!!"
"1","5","AMAZING! I'm no peach cobbler expert, but it was THE BEST peach cobbler I've had PERIOD!"
"1","5","really yummy. I didn't add cinnamon to the crust though. I prefer a plain topping."
"1","5","This is truly amazing cobbler. I used 4 lbs. of frozen peaches and doubled the recipe and baked all in 9x13 pan. The topping is divine and I could eat only that! You must serve this warm with vanilla bean ice cream. This is one of those dishes that when you serve it, there is a time where there is no speaking as people can't stop eating to even talk about how amazing it is! Plus it is super easy."
"1","5","I jsut made this today, and it was HEAVEN! The 'cobbler' part tastes almost like a coffee cake, with peaches under it. I've never had a cobbler quite like this, but it was out of this world! No more bisquik for me!"
"1","5","Snaps for Amy! I absolutely loved this dessert. I did add more peaches, however it was the topping that blew me away! I wanted to make a dessert using peaches as they are just in season. Next time I will use a 9x13 pan so I can double the topping. Great recipe!!!"
"1","5","Thank you for this recipe! I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan - it turned out great. I would like a little more peaches, though. My husband liked it just the way it was and the kids gobbled it all down. Next time I will add a few extra peaches or hold back a little on the batter topping. I felt like I was in Georgia... we served with homemade whipped cream. Very yummy!!!"
"1","5","This recipe is so good! I was short on peaches, and I think it will definitely be better with the correct amount. I added 1/2 c of Blueberries after the fruit cooked, and it turned out great!"
"1","5","Oh boy! Favorite dessert recipe on this site. If you make this once be prepared to be begged to make it again. Simply exquiste served warm with some Berber's vanilla bean ice cream and champagne."
"1","5","Great Recipe! I modified it quite a bit. I used loquats and blackberries and deleted the cinnamon and nutmeg. This was one of the best cobblers I have tried. My wife loved it and she is not even a big fan of cobblers..."
"1","5","Very good! Might try with a little less sugar next time, but still a great recipe!!!"
"1","3","This was way too sweet for us. Additionally, the topping was more closely related to a biscuit than a cobbler topping."
"1","4","This was really good, I will make again."
"1","5","This recipe is wonderful. My 21 year old grandson said it is hands down the best dessert he had ever tasted."
"1","5","Excellent"
"1","5","This was the most amazing peach cobbler I have ever tasted! I've already made it twice. My brother hates peaches but loves this."
"1","5","MMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm. This cobbler was awesome. :-)"
"1","5","This is by far THE BEST Peach Cobbler I have ever had! I'll have to make sure to double the recipe next time because it doesn't last long! YUMMY!!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome, awesome, awesome!! I doubled this for my lasagna pan & I know it's not going to last. No changes needed."
"1","5","My boyfriend said this was 'the best he ever had,' I would have to agree! This one is a keeper!"
"1","5","Delicious recipe! I made this yesterday with sweet Georgia peaches. I did not need to add any more sugar because the peaches are so sweet. It is great warm or cold, with ice cream or milk poured over it."
"1","5","Excellent.. everyone in my family loved this. Since, it was my first time making this kind of desert, I got kind of nervous having it in a 425 degree oven for 30 min .. I took it out alittle to early. Next time I will leave it in for sure.. I love it kind of crusty on the top."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. I normally don't like peach cobbler, but I loved this one. I put 1/2 cup of sugar in with the peaches and they weren't tart at all. Everyone had seconds!"
"1","5","Fabulous! One of the best cobblers I've eaten. Great way to use up those succulent summer peaches."
"1","5","I made this today and it is very good. The peaches were delicous. I took the advice from others and used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/4 cup. I didn't have any nutmeg so I used a few sprinkles of apple pie spice. It still turned out excellent! I will surely make this many more times. Thank you for posting this great recipe Amy! :o)"
"1","5","How do I give this 5 stars each for the six people in my office who LOVED this? :o) My boss said 'pump this into my veins'. SO easy to pull together - I used eight apples that were too soft to eat. I used a 9x13 and the dough didn't quite cover the apples but no one cared. I'm thinking about having someone over just for an excuse to make this again."
"1","5","WOW!!! I finally found a recipe comparable to gramma's."
"1","3","This was OK. My peaches were very juicy and ripe, so I increased the thickener. Still wasn't enough - it was way to watery. Also too sweet for my taste."
"1","4","use extra brown sugar!"
"1","3","This recipe is ok. I've made it saveral times and it just comes out way too dry. If using fresh peaches I just triple (or morer) the amount of lemon juice to make it saucier. I've also just used canned peaches adding the cinnamon and nutmeg, and it's come out fine."
"1","5","This is awesome! We ate the whole thing between 3 of us... don't change a thing!"
"1","5","Best cobbler I've ever tasted. Not too sweet. Gave some to my neighbor and they agreed it was awesome. I served it with vanilla ice cream on top."
"1","5","Great cobbler, everyone loved it. It was almost gone before I got to taste it!"
"1","2","This recipe wasn't anything special. I have never had a cobbler before, and didn't really know what to expect. I will stick to Crisps. I found that there was almost a bitterness to it, but my boyfriend thought it was too sweet. Sorry, I won't be using this recipe again."
"1","5","This was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again."
"1","5","Wonderful!!! I used ripe red haven peaches and substituted the sugar with Splenda and it came out great! Will definitely make this again. Nice summer dessert."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. I will be making this again. It is a keeper for sure!!! Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","This recipe was fabulous!! I didn't even know I liked peach cobbler until I tried this. I followed it exactly and loved the results. I would highly recommend it!!"
"1","5","Served this today as we had a bumper crop of peaches this year...Have been trying different recipes but this is the best..My adult son said it should be called 'peach heaven' Well worth the effort...."
"1","5","Absolute PERFECTION! I followed this recipe exactly and it was divine."
"1","5","This is sooooo good! When my son dropped the bag of peaches my father-in-law gave for us, I knew I had to use them quickly. So, I immediately began peeling and slicing peaches. This turned out to be the perfect cobbler recipe. The brown sugar and spices help to make a rich, sweet sauce. We LOVED it!"
"1","5","This is by far the best cobbler I have ever eaten! My husbond said the same thing - he even suggested it might be the best thing I have ever made. The topping is delicious and the seasonings are perfect. I am going to make this again and again."
"1","5","I made this cobbler yesterday and served it to my family. They loved it. I followed the recipe but doubled the dough and not as much cinnamon sprinkled on top. I also loosely covered the pie with foil the last 6 minutes to keep it from over-browning. Turned out great. Very rich and delicious with vanilla ice cream. Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!"
"1","5","I made this for a potluck and it was the most popular item there! It was absolutely delicious. I think i will use a little less butter next time (to try to make it a little healthier). This is my new favorite peach cobbler!"
"1","5","Delicious, easy and beautiful!! Great flavor with fresh or frozen peaches!! Crust was perfect - soft on inside, crisp on outside. Perfect seasonings and thickness!!"
"1","5","Deeeeelicious!!! --And super easy, too! This recipe is wonderful!! Thank you!!!"
"1","4","Pretty good, but I have had better. It kinda seems like its missing something. The topping is delicious."
"1","5","This was delicious!! I am from Arizona so the peaches I used were from a neighbors dwarf peach tree. They are smaller than regular peaches so I had to use more than eight. Also, baking it for 30 minutes is too long. The topping was starting to burn after 27 minutes."
"1","5","This is the BEST Peach Cobbler I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly as it said except I used Del Monte peaches in light syrup and drained most of the juice. Perfect with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","This recipe is great. I have made it serveral times, always to rave reviews. I never hoped to find a recipe that my husband actually prefers above the local *Country* restaurant, especially being raised in Upstate, New York! I generally use canned peaches for this recipe, so I reduce the amount of sugar that is mixed with the fruit. Other than that, and aside from doubling the recipe every time, I follow the directions exactly. VERY VERY GOOD!"
"1","2","I didn't like the crust. It was too bready."
"1","4","This was very good, and was just as easy and good as the recipe promises. I give it four stars only because I prefer oatmeal or granola in my crisp, but this is a very good alternative. And it is not too much cinnamon."
"1","4","Good recipe, would increase the amount of peaches used. Thanks for sharing"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Our entire family loved this dish and it was easy to make."
"0","5","The best ever! I have been making peach cobbler for 50 years and this is by far the easiest and the best tasting!"
"0","5","I don't know what size peaches y'all are used to. My Costco box had Costco sized peaches. 7.5 peaches filled my baking dish to the brim.   I didn't use the cinnamon-sugar to sprinkle on top since I prefer less sugar all around. Next time I will double the biscuit topping. There wasn't quite enough for the amount of peaches I had."
"0","5","I have had lots of cobbler in my life. This one is fabulous. I started with fresh ripe peaches and finished with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Perfect. I don't generally like cinnamon, but this recipe rocked."
"0","5","Crust was flaky crusty and amazing topped with ice cream! I will add more peaches next time, and I used the canned kind but it was still every bit as delicious as I hoped it to be ! I just finished the pan and I am looking forward to making more!!"
"0","5","Maybe add less sugar to the peaches bc it was reallllly sweet. Crust was perfect."
"0","5","I've never made peach cobbler prior to this recipe but the family loved it! Was told by everyone it's better than what they've had at restaurants! We Appreciate the post! ??"
"0","4","I really loved it, but the family found it too sweet. I followed the recipe without any change, and it was very good. It wasn't dry because I used peaches that were few days old and quite soft and juicy. This is a keeper, and we already made it twice."
"0","5","Crowd FAVE! This is the winner. The 2 step process (peaches then topping) is well worth it! In a pinch, I made it with canned peaches and it was still excellent (MUST DRAIN). I made 2 diff recipes and brought them to a dinner, everyone raved over the topping on this one and they didn't mind the canned peaches (prefer with sweet, fresh peaches tho!). I also used a long, shallow dish which made for a taste of yummy topping in every scoop. Mine was not 'cake-like' at all, I think bc I dropped small amounts of topping and the crust was a thin layer, not a deep thick gooey layer. It cooked all the way through and had enough to cover the whole cobbler (don't forget to sprinkle with cinnamon sugar)."
"0","5","Only used 2 Tbsp sugar on topping. Am consider cutting it back further. Otherwise, it received rave reviews when I took it to a family gathering."
"0","5","This was a great hit at my family party. It was pretty quick to make other than peeling the peaches. Definitely will make again. I think mine actually made more than the recipe called for because the peaches I had were very large."
"0","5","Much better than pie. I left out nutmeg and probably halved the cinnamon. The peaches were too delicious to be masked by spices. This will be my go-to cobbler recipe."
"0","4","I followed exactly as it said. There was a bit too much liquid and the top was a little too brown. next time I won't leave it in for 30 min. It tastes amazing though and will def make again."
"0","5","Definitely going to make again."
"0","5","Perfect!"
"0","5","My mom and dad loved it! Though both times that I've made it my pan has been too big, so once I figure out that I'll be thrilled! It was delicious though, and I would make this again once I have more peaches next year!"
"0","5","Will definitely make this again. Very simple recipe and unlike other cobbler recipes, this one called for half brown sugar and half white sugar. This really enhances the flavor along with the cinnamon. Love it!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe.. I didn't change a thing and we loved it."
"0","5","My family loved this cobbler. I doubled the recipe, added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg and added huckleberries. Also, just sprinkled over cinnamon and sugar without measuring so probably a little less sweet.  Made it both ways - peaches only and peaches + huckleberries. Both were excellent."
"0","5","Came out wonderfully! My only add was chopped pecans in the crust."
"0","5","Will definately make again. My entire family loved it!"
"0","5","l made this recipe yesterday and it turned out great. My dad and I loved it. I will be making this again for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays."
"0","5","This was the perfect peach dessert!"
"0","5","Used fresh picked peaches from my orchard. They fell off into my hand, so definitely ripe. Here's what I changed: topping -1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup unbleached flour, 1/8 cup sugar (no brown sugar) all other ingredients went unchanged. For the filling, I used 1/8 cup sugar and 1/8 cup maple syrup. Everything else was the same as the recipe given. My husband, who usually just eats what I make without comment good or bad (we've been married 41 years so I already know what he likes) said, 'This will work!' Which means he loved it! Way better than my old method of making cobbler. Thank you so much! This recipe goes in the frequently grabbed recipe pile! So awesome!"
"0","5","I made it as written and it turned out really good. I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","Made just as directed. Was delicious!"
"0","5","It was fantastic! The kids weren't sure they would like it, but after having seconds and trying to have more, they are huge fans. Thanks for a new favorite recipe :)"
"0","4","Very delicious cobbler,my boys enjoyed so much that I was able to taste it..lol"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Didnt change anything....didnt use all thr cinnamon sugar at the end....my family loved the topping. I guess its a matter of taste :-) I will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","This was really good. My husband, who isn't a fan of cobbler, liked it and asked for more. My only changes were I added about a quarter teaspoon vanilla extract to the batter and I made it gluten free with the following combination: 1/3 cup white rice flour, 1/3 cup sweet white sorghum flour and 1/3 tapioca starch with 1 tsp xantham gum. Also, I 'cut in butter' using a food processor. This recipe is a winner."
"0","5","Excellent. Easy recipe!"
"0","5","Heady peachy goodness!! Should be labeled as addictive. Almost like a fruit liquor by the time you finish. So yummy!"
"0","5","OMG. I followed the directions to the letter. I bought the peaches at the local farmers market and came home and made this cobbler. It is the best peach cobbler I have ever eaten. I tried it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, but to be honest, it is best just the way it is. This recipe is a keeper and will definitely be making it again. Thank you so much for submitting this wonderful recipe."
"0","5","This peach cobbler is amazing! It takes a while to make but it's worth it."
"0","4","Decent, but too sweet, and I have a sweet tooth! No need to make this a Diabetes Cobbler. You do not need a half cup of sugar on peaches in an 8x8' pan. Guessing half the sugar in the filling and maybe 2/3 the sugar in the topping will be just right. I didn't sprinkle even close to all the cinnamon sugar on top either. I did add more cornstarch--3 rounded tsp, and it was a great consistency. Also 8 Tbsp of butter as suggested, and served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","We loved this recipe! Delicious! Wow! Thank you! I had to substitute salted butter because I was out of sweet butter. I didn't cook the peaches first because I forgot and I also forgot the cinnamon and sugar. I am definitely making this again."
"0","5","Good taste. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream"
"0","5","Made last night, Turned out great. Made in a cast iron skillet. Ran over in oven and made a real mess.Wife laughed at me. It was worth it.Taste was great."
"0","5","Doubled the recipe then used more peaches--enough to fill a 9 X 13 glass pan. Skipped cinnamon sugar on top. The sugar was just right. Served with whipped cream."
"0","5","Soo good! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is an easy recipe to make and yummy! Watch final cook time carefully as it Browns fast especially when using convection ovens."
"0","5","This was fabulous! I used a bit less sugar with the peaches only because we just got fresh and very ripe fruit from a nearby orchard. My husband LOVED it and said it was the perfect balance of fruit and topping. The kids gobbled it up too. This is a keeper!"
"0","3","It was okay. I'm going to try another recipe next time I make peach cobbler."
"0","5","tip on step 3: don't combine with the hot water until right before you mix and drop on the fruit.  I tried with truvia baking mix AND truvia baking mix/sugar mixture...the sweetener/sugar mix was better.  also added a few raspberries to the peaches for an extra pop of sweetness and OH. MY. GOLLY. so frigging good.  enjoy!"
"0","5","This cobbler came out tasty,but the top was burnt a little bit. As someone else said it is hard to tell when it is done because of the cinnamon on top.I will make this again,just bake a shorter time. The 'biscuit'part of this is crispy on the top and gooey on the the inside (just the way I like it)."
"0","5","I really love this recipe. I kind of messed up though and made this in a 9 x 13' baking dish instead of a 2 qt. casserole dish. There wasn't quite enough topping to cover the 9 x 13. If I would have used my oval 2 qt. casserole dish, I think the topping amount would be fine. I LOVE the topping in this recipe, so I may just double it anyway. Also, once the topping was on and the dish was placed back in the oven, I felt it was done in less time than 30 mins. I ended up baking it for 20 mns. I also used 3 teas. of cornstarch because I used very large peaches and they were super-super juicy."
"0","5","I made this for my southern mom. She loved it and managed to eat it all in a week. It was very tasty. Definitely a keeper. I think I will double the pastry recipe next time."
"0","5","I used fresh mangos from my mango tree instead of peaches and it was divine. I will definitely use this recipe again."
"0","5","Very good! I didn't have enough brown sugar, so I used honey to mix with the peaches instead, but kept the brown sugar in the topping. I enjoyed that the topping wasn't too sweet. This was a perfect way to use fresh peaches and I will make it again."
"0","3","Way to much sugar. Over whelmed my lovely sweet ripe organic peaches. I had to double the crust recipe to cover 5 large peaches. Like another suggested it's best to dice up larger pieces of peaches. I also use a product called sure gel, it makes a perfect consistancy for pie juices because it doesn't break down under heat like corn starch does. I don't think I will make this recipe again."
"0","5","Perfect recipe! Turned out great and rave reviews from everyone. Will make a bigger batch next time to fill a 9x13 dish."
"0","3","Considering all the great reviews, this was a bit of a let down. The filling was tasty, but the topping was too cake like. Will look for another cobbler recipe."
"0","5","added more peaches used 12 peaches medium to large and this is the best recipe ever took longer to cook than it says but I think it's because I used more peaches"
"0","1","Followed the recipe and the cobbler turned out very cakey."
"0","5","I apologize in advance for the following confession: I've used this site for 10 years. I have found tons of great recipes that I use over and over. But...this is my first time writing a review. Again, I'm sorry. But here it goes...  O!M!G! This is not only the best peach cobbler I've ever had but quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten, PERIOD.   I followed the directions to a T. No if ands or buts. Once it cooled just enough, I scooped it into a bowl and added vanilla ice cream. Drizzling a little juice from the bottom of the baking dish on top of the ice cream. I CAN'T EVEN!   Make it. Like, NOW. Don't change a thing. Your life will never be the same."
"0","4","This is good, but a bit TOO sweet... I even lessened up on the sugar! The sprinkled sugar on top is not really neccessarry either, I'd just use the cinnamon. Also needs to be eaten day of, not really good the next day."
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. The crust on top gets a little crunchy and underneath it's soft and tender. So delish! I followed shoes58 to remove skins, it was a bit messy cutting them because they were boiled, but so easy to remove skins. I used 10 peaches (I wouldn't use less) and baked in a 9x13 glass cake pan. I made 1-1/2 of the topping and added it by spreading it out with my fingers (some thicker, some thinner) and laying it over the peaches, instead of spoonfuls. Best Part! Because I wanted it hot-out-of-the-oven, I left it at this point and baked it during dinner. It was amazing! PS- I forgot the cinnamon for the topping, didn't even realize until later. YUMMY!!"
"0","5","O...M....G!!! Seriously the best dessert I ever made. I would have loved to make this a true southern peach cobbler, but I used fresh picked New Jersey peaches and it was really good! Took SHOES58 advice(peel came right off... Thanks!) I served it at room temp and used fresh cold whipped cream and sprinkled a little of the cinnamon/sugar on top for a pretty presentation. To die for!! Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","5","This was made for a cottage get-togeher, and it was AMAZING! However, sugar for peach mixture was halved, as was the amount of sugar-cinnamon mixture for the top. Served with vanilla ice cream, and it was even better the next day! (Only know that because we had to save some for missing guests!!) Definitely a keeper...and Ontario peaches work just fine (no snub intended to Georgia's product!)!"
"0","5","Perfect. Definetely will make again. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","My version followed the basic recipe but I added raspberries and blackberries. It was to die for! Next time because of the added moisture of the berries, I'll double the amount of cornstarch."
"0","5","We changed this recipe by necessity but loved the outcome. We substituted 2 tablespoons of molasses for every 1/3 cup of brown sugar and added about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.What a great cobbler!!! Its in my favorite folder for sure :)"
"0","5","Good recipe but a little difficult to follow. Made it as suggested and added more peaches additional 1/2 cup more flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tablespoons butter. A little more cinnamon sugar."
"0","5","Most delicious! Easy to do and tastes simply fantastic! Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","I followed the directions but used 2 more peaches and a half of cup more sugar for the filling. In addition I added an additional 1/4 cup of corn starch so that it the juice from the peaches would not be too runny. It turned out beautifully and my family loved it. It is a definite keeper."
"0","3","It was a lot sweeter than I like, and I was not too crazy about the bread topping"
"0","4","This was very good!"
"0","5","I mix nectarines and peaches was great"
"0","5","My parents visited from Holland and never had this before. My wife said she would grace their presence with a dutch apple pie but I insisted on making this dish - the peaches from costco were for just eating but I took them quickly. I wish I could have shared the look of their faces, including my wife's when they took a bite. Need I say this recipe is so good. Better than any pie or dessert I had in a long time. Oh so good!"
"0","5","Best cobbler ever!!!!!!"
"0","5","We made this cobbler, and it is the absolute best one I've ever had. The taste of the brown sugar & cinnamon can be tasted really good throughout every bite. I would definitely make this recipe again. It was quick, and pretty easy to make. And absolutely totally delish!!!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at peach cobbler, and I have to say it was delicious! I think I'll use a little less cinnamon in the peach mixture next time since it's being sprinkled on the top as well."
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","I made it exactly as directed except I added 2 extra tsp cornstarch per previous reviews. I also used a 9x13 pan instead of 8x8, so the topping didn't completely cover the dish, but it was still delicious!"
"0","5","Omg this is so good! Georgia peaches are in so I made this morning and it is perfect. I made another one and will put in freezer for company in a few weeks. Outstanding and I look forward to making this with Apple's this fall! Deserves ten stars! I never change a recipe from this site...other wise I would not rate it! Yummy!"
"0","5","Only change I made was the lemon juice. I didn't have a real lemon so I used bottled juice. It was still excellent!"
"0","5","All I can say is 'OMG!!!'!! the BEST Peach Cobbler I've ever had! And this is my first and only time ever making it. I'm shocked, to be honest I didn't think it would taste SOOO good! I'm more of a cook than a baker. Its easy to make and yes, I will be making it again and again......??"
"0","5","Loved this recipe and I don't think I will ever use another. This is the easiest homemade cobbler recipe I've used. It is the perfect balance between sweet, tart and spice. Knowing that the more ripe peaches would cook down more than the less ripe peaches, I sliced some thicker than others. The topping came out perfect. Crunchy on top and soft in the middle. I'm having this for breakfast in the morning!"
"0","5","Found this to be a great cobbler and was a huge hit. I did feel that it needed more topping, so I would increase those ingredients by 50% to cover more of the apples. Would definitely make this again!"
"0","5","I got 5 peaches off of my Grandma's tree and I made this tonight. It was delicious! I didn't have as many peaches as it called for but that didn't matter to me because I like lots of dough anyways! I will definitely be making this again. My husband said it tastes better than my mom's cobbler and my daughter agreed as well!"
"0","4","I made this dessert for my daughter's birthday celebration. I bought the peaches a day ahead and was concerned that the peaches were not yet ripe for eating, but the consistency was perfect for the ccobbler. I added a few more peaches and should have increased the topping also."
"0","5","We loved it....even my kids who aren't big peach fans thought it was a keeper! It was the perfect recipe for the peaches we got from the farm. Delicious!! Thanks!"
"0","5","This was delicious! I served it with ice cream, my guests and family loved it! Will make again."
"0","5","Just as you imagine perfect peach cobbler to taste! Warmed up with some vanilla ice cream is like a taste of heaven in a bowl."
"0","5","I had some extra peaches on hand and tried this recipe for a backyard pool party. It came out excellent. Not too sweet and pretty easy to put together - I used more peaches than called for."
"0","5","Great recipe. Def make again!"
"0","5","I used my home canned peaches, left them chunky, used real butter, less sugar (since peaches were already sweet) I doubled the topping, added a bit more cinnamon and fresh ground nutmeg, topped it off with pecan pieces. Perfect!"
"0","5","Your peach cobbler recipe is on point and the best I ever had . The recipe instructions were easy to follow. The best thing I loved, was the flavor and that it was not runny like most cobblers. I know your recipe called for fresh peaches, but Please forgive me, it was out of season. And I used canned peaches light syrup and render the syrup down and then still followed your recipe to the letter. And at the end it tasted heavenly, golden brown light crisp topping and moist fruit. It was the talk of the thankgiving dinner. Even from other peach cobller makers. It was my first time making cobbler ...THANK YOU .. GOOD SHOT"
"0","5","this was great.."
"0","5","My granddaughter and I had fun making this recipe. It was easy. We added a little more cinnamon and the last sugar and cinnamon we only used 1/3 to sprinkle over the top. This recipe was just right since we do not like recipes that have too much sugar. We will definitely make it again."
"0","5","Now trying it with strawberries will update later"
"0","5","I made it as stated and there wasn't a spoonful left after my cookout. I didn't even get any!!"
"0","3","I made this recipe almost exactly as written (though I realized after the fact I added a whole stick of butter instead of 6 tbsp). Overall it tasted good, but the texture was extremely mushy. My friends liked it, and took some home for their husbands, so it couldn't have been too bad, but I have made other recipes that I liked much better. I wouldn't make this one again."
"0","4","THis was delicious! I ended up baking it for about an extra 15 minutes. The peaches bubbled up over the top, which I didn't expect - so it wasn't as beautiful as I'd hoped after it baked, but it sure was delicious!"
"0","4","This recipe turned out pretty good. I've never been able to get homemade crust right. This one turned out really well. I filled the recipe with the addition of extra butter added to the dough."
"0","5","Followed this recipe perfectly. Absolutely the best! Everyone loved the dish!"
"0","4","Tastes Excellent!! Easy to make too!! I did take the advise of previous reviews and I actually doubled the ingredients for the crumble and I'm glad I did!! I have attempted other Peach Cobbler recipes and unfortunately I have failed but this turned out wonderful!! I will definitely make this again!!"
"0","3","Too sweet and the topping gets VERY dark!"
"0","4","The topping was to much like a cake for my liking."
"0","5","I've made this twice and it was really yummy! My family really enjoyed it. The only thing that I would change is the sugar. It's a bit too sweet. I plan on making this again for a 4th of July cookout/ birthday surprise party for a uncle whose turned another year older on this day. So happy 4th and thank you to the men and women whose out there fighting to protect us each day."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly.Use a 8x8 baking dish.I sort of spread the topping over the peaches.I did not sprinkle cin/sugar mixture over the top,not needed.Great recipe,thank you!"
"0","5","Oh my goodness is all I have to say. Don't change a thing. Awesome!!!"
"0","5","Delicious! Even my picky toddlers liked it."
"0","2","This is my first time trying peach cobble with fresh peaches and I've got to say I like it better with canned ones and I thought this recipe didn't have enough batter and it was too sweet, maybe I didn't do something right. It just looks all brown on the top and it's not brown from the baking, it's more from the cinnamon and sugar."
"0","3","Like"
"0","4","425 seems too hot to cook the topping, almost burnt mine...I think 350 or 375 would be a better temp for that part"
"0","4","This was much easier than I anticipated!! Can't wait for it to cool to try it. The peaches I've stolen so far are delicious."
"0","4","Very good cobbler recipe. I tried the recipe 'as-in' and it worked well with nice cinnamon flavor. The nutmeg was slightly was noticeable, however pleasantly light - too much nutmeg can really overpower the other flavors. Nice cakelike topping and the perfect amount to cover the round casserole dish I used. I look forward to using the basic topping recipe for other fruit cobblers - blueberry, apple. Thank you."
"0","4","Never had peach cobbler so I'm not sure what they're supposed to taste like but I would imagine this is exactly what it's supposed to be like. I wished it would've been sweeter but I'm a sugar addict and love extremely sweet things!"
"0","4","Really liked it. Can use canned peaches. I would double the amount of the topping next time because I love that crumbly stuff."
"0","5","didn't change a thing, it was pretty delicious. The right dessert after a BBQ, with a bit of ice cream that quite compliments it. For us it's quite perfect as it is; I admit that the crust is a bit 'biscuitlike' and not crumbly, you can always change the crust with something with oats or so, but... it would be another recipe, wouldn't it?"
"0","4","Delicious...I looked at all of the other comments and went from there. I thawed my previous frozen peaches. Used 8 Tbsp butter, 4 Tbsp corn starch and use cold water instead of hot and everything turned out terrific. Easy to make!"
"0","5","Almost identical to my mother in- laws famous old fashioned cobbler. Delicious!"
"0","5","Made this today for National Peach Cobbler Day!! First time making a peach cobbler and it was wonderful. My family absolutely loved it."
"0","5","I love, love, love cobbler. This one is by far THE BEST recipe I have ever come across and I have thrown away all the others I have in my possession. This is the one all my friends ask me for."
"0","5","We loved this!!! I ran out of peaches and used frozen mangos and strawberries instead and it turned out amazing! Will definitely be using recipe again and again."
"0","5","I just needed a filling recipe I already had dough, so I tried this one and this one was delicious nothing needed to be changed. Thanks for adding."
"0","3","Delicious recipe but way, way too sweet! Sugar (2 cups+3 T total in recipe) could easily be cut in half. Also, my oven at 425 browned the crust of the cobbler while leaving the rest of the batter raw. Recommend reducing heat to around 350-375 for second half of baking. Will need to increase baking time acccordingly"
"0","5","Peach cobbler is one of those dishes that I usually don't try. We had a 4 gallon can of sliced peaches in the pantry. I added brown sugar to them but otherwise followed the recipe. The flavor was awesome! I made one for my family and one for my Aunt. They were in love!! Great recipe!!"
"0","5","Awesome!"
"0","5","Made as written except that I didn't have fresh peaches. I used 2 1lb bags of frozen peaches.  This was pretty much perfect for me. Just sweet enough, but not too sweet. (I think the peaches had a lot to do with that.) I ended up with a lot of crust for the amount of peaches. (I prefer it that way, but the wife thought it was too crust heavy.) Next time I will use a smaller diameter cooking bowl and use another bag of peaches. I also think it would be really good to sprinkle course sugar on the top instead of 'normal' fine sugar.  This is now my standard, go-to cobbler recipe."
"0","5","My family loved this cobbler! I used frozen peaches that I had put up this summer, heated on the stove top. Wonderful, this recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","This was a great recipe and it turned out awesome. The family loved it, it was perfect! Thanks alot"
"0","5","I have made this dish 3 or 4 times now. I have made it double and triple - every time people beg for more.... this is definitely a hit with everybody. best peach cobbler I've ever made!"
"0","4","Though the directions weren't completely clear, I was able to piece together everything and it came out pretty good! Especially with some Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","This is my favorite peach cobbler recipe. Just made it again. So good!"
"0","4","This was really awesome. Only thing is that either the directions are wrong and you need to turn down to 350 when put the cobbler in OR my toaster oven running too high. First time I made it, the top got burned. But when reduced to 350 and cooked a few minutes more, it was best so far."
"0","4","My family really did enjoy"
"0","5","I played around with the recipe a little, especially the topping, but this recipe was WONDERFUL! Fun to make and easy to please.  Cut my hand slicing peaches, but was well worth it! My attendees of my dinner party loved the dessert!"
"0","5","This was a fast easy recipe to follow and prepare! And the taste was excellent! I didn't have peaches so I subbed pears and skipped adding the white sugar to them. Other than that followed to a 'T' and it was excellent. Loved the bit of sugar sprinkled atop the cake mixture before baking. It added a wonderful crunch!"
"0","4","we tried this recipe and substituted sugar for honey, all-purpose flour for spelt flour, and butter for Earth Balance. I know some other families would oppose this idea but when you train your taste buds to healthier options, it's not that bad."
"0","3","Tasty but WAY TOO MUCH sugar, even though I have used peaches that were not too sweet. Next time I will half the sugar and turn the heat down a little bit, probably to 200 degrees C from 220: I followed the instructions provided, and the top was burnt."
"0","5","Haven 't tried it yet but I intend to . Sounds wonderful."
"0","5","This was so easy to make, and it was delicious! The only thing I would suggest is to double the recipe so you have leftovers!"
"0","4","I'm not a big fan of peach cobbler but I made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it! Gone in no time!"
"0","5","I've made this twice. The first time I had so many peaches that I had to double the recipe. On top of that, I goofed and did not bake the peaches first as directed. (I obviously have difficulty following directions :-) I ended up baking it for the 40 minutes (don't ask, directions obviously elude me) which made the crust overdone. Nonetheless, my son deemed this the 'BEST dessert ever!' Second time, followed the directions to a 'T' except for the cinnamon and sugar on top. It is plenty sweet enough and didn't need the additional crispness or shine that it would add. Excellent! And if you blanch the peaches to peel them, it is incredibly easy and fast. Also, just use the boiling water from the peaches for the cobbler and you don't have to boil water in another dish. MMMM...MMMM...Good!"
"0","5","This was great! I used peaches and nectarines, a nice fruity flavor. Made the recipe as it was written. Again very flavorful!"
"0","5","I halved the recipe and also substituted organic vegetable shortening made from palm oil for the butter. Great recipe!"
"0","4","One of my family members has a dairy allergy, so I wasn't able to use the butter in the topping. I substituted an equal amount of butter-flavored shortening with no ill effects that I could see. The biscuit topping was great! I agree with previous reviewers that the cinnamon-sugar mix should be cut in half. Also, be sure to get ripe peaches - mine were a little under-ripe, and they still had noticeable crunch after baking. Still tasty though!"
"0","4","Great recipe. Took off one star because even though I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4, it was still way too sweet."
"0","5","added extra fruit Have added cherries with the peaches came out great"
"0","4","Very delicious but I had to cut back on that sugar and butter!! I tried it with all measured out ingredients -- way too sweet -- so today, I cut the sugars and the butter in half, it was perfect!! Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!!"
"0","5","My daughter and I made this together. Our family loved it!!! Very simple to make, and I would definitely agree with adding 1.5 to the topping ingredients. That was the only way for us to cover the whole dish with topping."
"0","5","Delicious. Only gripe I have is how the recipe is written. Needs to be better organized."
"0","5","Delicious! The whole family loved it!"
"0","5","Wow, this WAS delicious!! I will certainly be making it again."
"0","5","My peach cobbler keeper recipe! Look no further! The multitude of 5 star ratings makes the results of this cobbler speak for itself! My whole family loved it. I made this exactly as it requested!"
"0","5","Loved the recipe. I did the topping the southern way. 1 1/2 cups each of flour, sugar and milk, 1 tsp cinnamon and a little sugar sprinkled over the top. Next time I will try the biscuit type topping. I would probably lighten up on the sugar a bit next time. I used 12 peaches, but it was still a little too sweet for me."
"0","3","I ended up making my peach cobbler the way that Judih posted! With finishing it with a different crust topping, that was her grandmas recipe. It says to bake for 30 minutes. At 30 minutes it was still a very liquidy cobbler. It did however, smell amazing! I left it in for another 15 minutes and the only change was that some of the peaches were getting very brown, and starting to smell a little burnt. I took the cobbler out of the oven, there's no crust on the top just liquid. I have yet to try it because it's still cooling. I'm sure it's delicious, I just wish a crust formed."
"0","4","I really like this recipe, it goes great with vanilla icecream! The only thing I changed is I add half a cup of rolled oats to the flour mixture. (because I put oats in everything)"
"0","4","was a sweet for us but will try again and use a lot less sugar,"
"0","5","It was easy and turned out great!"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing! We doubled the recipe thinking 4 servings wasn't enough, however, doubling it was WAY more than enough. We dropped our peaches into boiling water for 2 minutes and the skins practically fall off. Much easier than using a knife. We also used salted butter and then left out the actual salt. Great recipe and we already had all the ingredients in the house! Will for sure make this again!"
"0","4","This is a very good recipe. I made it exactly as written the first time and it really was too sweet. The next time I cut the sugars in half for the peaches but kept them the same and doubled the other ingredients for the topping. Baking it in a 9 x 13 dish, it came out perfect. The right sweetness and the perfect amount of topping."
"0","5","This recipe is extremely easy and comes out perfect. I have even substituted pears and made pear cobbler which turned out amazing. I believe any fruit would be good."
"0","5","This was the BEST PEACH COBBLER when I added some advice from one of the reviews on Sept. 15, 2008 I followed the recipe and used my peaches that I canned last year. I made the batter from whole wheat all purpose flour and Stevia for sugar sub and spread it on top. I will do this recipe again. Thanks it will be even better with whipped cream or ice cream on top."
"0","5","My whole house smelled wonderful! It was a cold, rainy evening and we enjoyed this cobbler to the max. I will certainly make this again and again!"
"0","5","Made this last night, had everything on hand, so no need to modify. As soon as it cooled, hubs and I dug in. Oh, modification, i topped our portions with canned whipped cream."
"0","4","I made this today and it was a hit. Just remember if you are making for a large group double the crust recipe. Besides that it was so good. Will be baking this again."
"0","5","Very Easy to make. Tastes great too!"
"0","3","The recipe was extremely sweet. I would prefer to add a maximum of 1/4 cup of sugars to 2 quarts of peaches. However, I did like how the cornstarch thickened up the peach sauce."
"0","4","easy and quite tasty"
"0","5","Oh my oh my! This is so yummy. I love food that makes you moan and groan while you eat it and this definitely does it! Perfect peach/ cake ratio. I didn't sprinkle all the cinnamon sugar on top of the batter because I though that was a bit much for me. Great recipe, thank you so much for sharing!"
"0","5","This cobbler was literally 'plate-licking' delicious. My husband and I totally devoured it in a couple days. I saved one piece to share with my boss and he also admitted to licking the plate clean. I had never made a peach cobbler before, but had lots of fresh Michigan peaches and I have always wanted to make peach cobbler. I didn't change the recipe at all, but I wish I would have doubled the entire recipe! It was messy and more work than I would have liked to cut up the fresh peaches, but I now realize it was worth it!"
"0","4","Was a big hit!"
"0","5","Made it exactly to recipe. It was fabulous. I liked the topping not being so much a thick biscuit and this was not."
"0","5","Not just a great recipe,but tasted fabulous!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Holy cow! I made this dessert with fresh picked peaches from outside our kitchen window! Definitely the best peach cobbler I've ever eaten. Quite possibly the tastiest dessert I've ever had!"
"0","3","The filling was pretty good but I love crust. This was my first time trying this type of crust and the cake like texture isn't for me."
"0","4","Great recipe.. Kids loved it.. Mine was rather juicy though?! Lots of fluid."
"0","5","Flavor was great, but I was missing the crumbly texture for the topping."
"0","4","Just made this, and wow very very good. Was my first time ever making a peach cobbler. So simple my 3 and 12 year old did most of it :) only thing I Did a little different was added more brown sugar to make it sweeter other than that I followed to the 'T'!"
"0","5","My family and me love love love this peach cobbler recipe. I make different peach cobblers and must say this one is the absolute best one.Making it today."
"0","5","Made as directed, and wouldn't change a thing. The only problem was that we ran out of vanilla ice cream. Definitely will make this one again. And again. And again..."
"0","4","Needs more cinnamon/sugar in peaches"
"0","5","I made this recipe tonight and could not have loved it more! It was easy to assemble with very little cleanup. I didn't have quite enough peaches, so I added some fresh blueberries. What a perfect combination! The top is much better than most cobblers I've tasted. Not so puffy, and with a beautiful sugared top. It has a beautiful crunch to it and not at all soggy. I would highly recommend! I'm looking forward to making it with other seasonal fruits."
"0","5","made it 4 times this peach season and it's already a favorite. I can't leave recipes alone so of course I tinkered with it but only to add more topping, I've added a few peaches then doubled the topping and that works for me. Gives the right amount of 'crunch' to go with the peaches and homemade vanilla ice cream I make during the summer!"
"0","4","Really enjoyed this recipe, but if you're a pie crust lover, this may not be the right recipe for you, topping has more of a cake texture :)."
"0","4","I have tried this recipe and it's no wonder that a million people and children love it. All that sugar. I used less sugar. THIS IS THE BEST PEACH COBBLER RECIPE I HAVE FOUND."
"0","5","However you describe the topping it is delicious. Hopefully, anyone looking for a cobbler or fruit crisp recipe will ignore the fact that this recipe calls for peaches. I have made it 'apple/blackberry' then 'peach/blueberry' and 'pear/raspberry'. Wonderful every time. I'd say the topping is more like a flakey pie crust. Don't forget to sprinkle the sugar on it before baking as it adds an extra crispyness. Thank you for a great recipe. So glad I found it. Oops - forgot to say I halved the topping - maybe that's why mine was more pie crust like? Loved it anyway"
"0","5","It's really good! Easy to make and really easy to eat! The only thing I changed from the recipe was to cut the sugar in half. I am not a fan of really sweet desserts and even with the reduced sugar it was still plenty sweet. Also, the peach slices should be cut a bit larger so they will keep their shape after the baking."
"0","5","You can tell this recipe was well tried and tested. I made this tonight for myself and my partner, it was absolutely fantastic first time I'd ever made it my self and first time he'd ever eaten it. I've tried peach cobbler before in a little American bistro and didn't think I could eat a better one and this is it!! Absolutely unbelievable. Only issue I had was with the cinnamon sugar top it just wouldn't set on the top and crunch up I'm thinking I need a blow torch next time ;) defiantly need ripe peaches, I was worried mine were to ripe and it was gonna turn to mush in the bottom of the dish however they didn't it was absolutely perfect I'm very impressed and think it would impress any one defiantly really impressed my fella tonight he's just fell in love with me all over again so thank you for your recipe."
"0","5","This is our new favorite peach cobbler. I took the advise of another reviewer and made 1 1/2 recipe for the topping. I had a few extra peaches I needed to use so I adjusted the recipe for that also. My husband said why make any other cobbler? And I agree! Finished cooking in exactly 30 minutes."
"0","5","delicious!"
"0","5","Definitely the best peach cobbler recipe I've found! The only things I tweaked were using less sugars and adding pecans to very top sugar mixture. Very tasty! Will use this recipe over and over again."
"0","5","Very good. I used 6 peaches as mine were very large and it filled the plan."
"0","5","Great cobbler, easy to make and family loved it."
"0","5","I omitted the nutmeg"
"0","5","I've never made cobbler before and I followed the recipe except I had 5 huge peaches not 8 & I used ready made sugar cinnamon at the end on top. Instant hit! Good taste. Only baked 20 minutes instead of 30."
"0","5","I loved this recipe! It's nothing like the terrible Bisquicky taste I remember as a kid in the biscuits. It tastes more like a Peach Crumble than a Cobbler to me, but that is an improvement. Also, since I had to go gluten free recently, it was easy for me to swap out the flour for 1/2 portion gluten free flour and 1/2 portion of almond meal to make a delicious and crumbly topping for fruit."
"0","3","Much too sweet."
"0","5","We love, love, love this! My husband who is 'Oakie' born and bread, said it's the best cobbler heh as had in 30 years."
"0","5","Excellent! Husband rated it as outstanding. definitely 5 star"
"0","5","I've made this recipe a few times now and I always tastes good! As was mentioned before, the 1 tsp of baking powder gave the top a more cake like consistency. I only put in 1/2 tsp of baking powder and it turns out just fine but not so much like cake. On the top I put a bit of cinnamon and sugar along with some allspice and it tastes quite good. I have also found that this recipe can be used with other fruit as well. More recently I have made a strawberry and peach cobbler. Overall, very nice recipe!"
"0","1","Sickeningly sweet!"
"0","5","This cobbler just came out of the oven and I'm in LOVE! It is, by far, the best cobbler I've ever tasted. The flour mixture is just sweet enough for me. (I don't like biscuit-like cobblers, so this being sweeter is perfect.) It doesn't need ice cream or whipped cream--just serve it up with a glad of milk and you'll get rave reviews!"
"0","4","My family loved this recipe. The only thing I would change is to double the topping as there wasn't enough to cover the entire top and it was really delicious with the peaches. I used some ripe and some less ripe peaches and it turned out fine. I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","Yum"
"0","4","I'd never made cobbler before and this turned out great, didn't change a thing!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I made two small changes. My peaches weren't quite ripe, so used an increased amount of sugar and cinnamon for the mixture that I used to coat the peaches. I used 1/2 cup of brown and white sugar instead of 1/4 cup of each, and I used 3/4 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4 tsp."
"0","5","This was a very simple and yummy recipe."
"0","4","This was good but the topping is not my favorite. Next time I will utilize the brown sugar with the write sugar with my normal recipe. Like the brown sugar addition."
"0","5","This cobbles was goooood"
"0","4","This was my first time ever making peach cobbler. My husband really enjoyed it. He loves sweet things but I could actually use a little bit less sugar than the recipe calls for. I liked the crust and would like more of it. I'll definitely be making this recipe again with the slight sugar adjustment. Thanks for the easy recipe!"
"0","5","This is so good that I have to hold back from eating the whole thing myself. This with some nice fresh whipped cream is heaven :) Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","This recipe is so delicious!!! I added an extra two peaches, because mine were on the small side. I also added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe as well. I will most definitely be making this again."
"0","5","Really great and simple recipe. I happened to have some peaches in the kitchen and decided to try this. Fresh peaches are key!!! This was devoured in 24 hours!"
"0","5","Made with blueberries, very good!"
"0","5","Awesome! Made this for dessert over the weekend and it was a smash hit. Everyone loved it; best to use ripe yellow peaches (we had some white peaches mixed in which also worked well, but I wouldn't try this with only white peaches). I added a small amount of freshly grated nutmeg in the peaches and it really 'popped'. This is definitely a keeper."
"0","3","Okay, will not be one I go to. Not sure if it was peaches to cobbler ratio or not. Maybe my 8 peaches larger then what recipe calls for."
"0","5","amazing"
"0","5","I just came into a whole bunch of peaches and this recipe looked easy enough to try! I'm so glad I did!!! I made it as written and it was great!! I only put about half of the cinnamon sugar topping on over the crust and that was plenty for me!! Great with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","Super yummy. Double the topping."
"0","5","This is the best Peach Cobbler I ever made. My husband loved it. This receipt definitely goes in my receipt book. I will use this over and over again. I wouldn't change a thing."
"0","5","I've made this three times & each time it is incredible. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe."
"0","5","Delicious! I use a little less sugar in all stages and whatever seasonal fruit I have like pears and will even mix like with nectarines! I especially like that it's almost a one bowl dish. Only problem is that it doesn't last long!"
"0","5","Wow, this came out really well. Our home-grown peaches are tart, so the sweet, crunchy crust was just the right balance. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream, and my husband and I couldn't stop raving about it. If I ordered this in a nice restaurant, I would be completely satisfied. I noted comments about baking powder taste and used just a smidge less than a teaspoon, but I didn't notice any lingering taste."
"0","5","Just made this peach cobbler tonight exactly like recipe. Not a bite left. Best cobbler I have ever tasted and very pretty. Tks for the great recipe !!"
"0","5","Great"
"0","4","Really good! Just what I was craving. I think it could use more cobbler though, and would likely double that next time. Also, I left out the salt, as it is totally unnecessary, I used gluten-free flour, and I left out the cinnamon sugar topping, because I thought the recipe had enough cinnamon already. I really liked this, and made some for a gluten-free friend, who loved it as well!"
"0","4","So easy! Quite delicious, too ."
"0","5","I've made this twice - both times it was amazingly delicious. Easy to follow recipe and a fresh summer treat in no time. I omitted the last step sprinkling with sugar and cinnamon - it's tasty enough. Once dished I added a spoon of frozen vanilla yogurt. YUM thanks for sharing"
"0","5","Yummy!!! It was soo great!"
"0","5","I am 49 years old, born and raised in Georgia and about to lose my 'southern girl card' because I had never made a peach cobbler. I am SO glad I chose this recipe as my first attempt. So good!!! My picky husband and 20 year old man-child loved it. I made it exactly as instructed, no changes needed for us."
"0","5","Made this with fresh peaches grown locally! It was delicious and I didn't alter a thing. It is a wonderful recipe."
"0","4","It would have received a 5 star, if it had not used nutmeg. I am not a fan of nutmeg."
"0","5","Doubled the recipe and made this with some very juicy peaches. Peaches were cooked for 10 extra minutes because there were so many. I was worried it was going to be soupy and to sugary. I was wrong! After it cooled for a couple hours on the counter we had some and it was delicious! Didn't use nutmeg and added a teaspoon of vanilla. To die for..."
"0","5","Best cobbler I have ever made. :)"
"0","5","Very easy recipe!"
"0","5","Best peach cobbler I have ever made. I doubled the recipe but used a little less brown sugar as other reviewers suggested. I used very ripe seasonal peaches. My guests raved about it. Bonus... Very simple to make."
"0","5","This cobbler is delicious. I cut thick slices of peaches because I like my cobbler chunky. I made the topping with the same spices and sugar that I put into the filling. The only thing I didn't add to the topping was the cornstarch. Will make this again and it didn't last long in my home."
"0","5","My peaches were fresh from my peach tree so fairly small. I used 16 for one cobbler"
"0","5","Excellent recipe. My only change was to NOT cook the peaches ahead of time. I do not like mushy fruit dishes, and by using ripe peaches, slicing thinly, and not baking them first they were absolutely perfect and juicy when the final product came out of the oven. I used a 9x11 pan and had to double the topping because the amount given didn't cover the peaches much at all in that sized pan. Oh darn! LOL It's juicy but not runny and the flavor is wonderful. The topping baked up nicely and had a slight crunch on top from the sugar sprinkled over it. I had some with whipped cream and it was delightful, but I bet ice cream does it proper justice."
"0","5","I'm not a baker but have a peach tree and too many peaches so needed to do something different. This was easy to follow recipe. Only change, I used regular butter since I didn't have unsalted on hand. Would definitely do this again. Very yummy and perfect served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","I made this and took it to our Church picnic....there was nothing left, all of it was gone! Now that says a lot! I'm making it again right now!"
"0","5","First time ever making Peach Cobbler! This recipes was a hit for our July 4th Party. Very good!"
"0","5","I have tried numerous recipes for peach cobbler and this one is the best I have ever made. It was gone in minutes. It was just right in every way."
"0","5","Served for the 4th of July and received rave reviews :)"
"0","5","I've never made cobbler before but living in GA decided nothing says July 4th like a fresh peach cobbler. It was a huge hit. There were several cobbler snobs in the room that said it was some of the best they had ever had. It's a keeper! Also I cut up all the beaches the day before soaked them in iced lemon water for 10 minutes then refrigerated in a ziplock. Kept them fresh and peachy and saved me tons of time the next day."
"0","5","Made this for July 4th. One of the best peach cobblers I've ever tasted. Didn't change anything. I used an 8x8 glass baking dish and everything fit perfectly. For the topping I broke off small pieces of the dough and sort of flattened it slightly in my hand and layed it around to fit. I also didn't use all of the sugar cinnamon topping. Your house will smell wonderful while this is baking!"
"0","5","I made this with gluten free flour for a friend. It still turned out great."
"0","5","Delicious, although more like a peach crisp than cobbler."
"0","4","Although I prefer a pastry crust on cobbler, this was very good. ."
"0","5","Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, aeposey! I was finally able to get some fresh peaches to make this cobbler. What a treat! The spices were perfect for this luscious fruit and it was relatively easy to make. Everyone loved it. Cheers!"
"0","5","First tried this at a graduation party. Best peach cobbler. Make it everytime peaches are on sale."
"0","5","Excellent as written! I prefer more peaches, but it's just like moms :)"
"0","5","We loved this cobbler! The top got quite dark but didn't taste burnt at all, so don't be discouraged when you pull it out of the oven."
"0","5","It tastes amazing. I made it for my niece and everyone loved it. So much in fact my mom requested it for her birthday instead of cake :)"
"0","5","This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. I used canned peaches in lite syrup to cut the preparation time and a little more cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up. I cut the sugar used to go in the peaches because the lite syrup is sweet. The crust browns up nicely. I served it with vanilla ice cream and everybody asked for seconds."
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe! Best peach cobbler ever!"
"0","5","My peaches were not as ripe as I would like but everyone loved it just the same. Great recipe, thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This was super tasty. I made extra crust and it was perfect!!!"
"0","5","I used a large can of peaches & substituted the juice for the water (I used all the juice in the peaches). I also used a stick of real butter. It turned out delicious. Will make often."
"0","5","This cobbler is my go to if I want to impress. I hate a mushy cobbler and this one has an excellent consistency. The fresh peaches play a big part in that so definitely don't go for canned. Perfect cold with whipped cream or hot with icecream. Yum Yum Yum."
"0","5","Always get compliments"
"0","5","Easy to follow, I added blueberries in with the peaches, which since its not quite peach season yet, I used bottled peaches. Sweet and tasty, will be my basic go to recipe"
"0","5","Easy to make and tastes great too"
"0","5","Can I prep this ahead of time, like the night before, and pop it in the oven while guests are eating dinner the next day? I'd like this to be warm when we eat it, so I'd prefer not to bake it ahead of time....Please let me know if this would work..Thanks!"
"0","5","This was very, very good even though I didn't use peaches. I thought I had some in the freezer - nope - only cherries. Used approx. 5 cups cherries and tapioca instead of cornstarch. Cooked on stove top first instead of the oven (I didn't think 10 min. in the oven would thaw the cherries)and then added the batter. Baked for 25 min and covered with foil for the last 10 min. Didn't use the sugar topping. It was plenty sweet. I will make again with peaches and probably try apples or combinations of fruit too. Thanks for the recipe aeposey!"
"0","5","So easy!So Delisious!!!! Never even made it to the plates, my kids and wife ate it all up as soon as the could bear the heat! I didn't have fresh peaches so I used Canned and added 1\2 teasoon of chia seed to help with extra moisture, and ground the cinnamon fresh."
"0","4","This is delicious! We didn't have fresh peaches so we used the ones canned in fruit juice and it worked very well. We also had some passion fruit on hand and it gave it a very nice flavor. I'll definitely make it again!"
"0","5","I didn't change anything. The crust was delicious. I don't like a cake-y cobbler."
"0","5","WOW is all I can say! This recipe is SPECTATULAR! Every year, I buy a bushel of peaches and can my own peach pie filling. This recipe is definitely worthy of my home-made filling! Thanks so much for sharing it!"
"0","5","This was awesome and pretty easy. It took 30 min to bake, as stated. One reviewer said to"
"0","4","We liked this dessert but very much like an English crumble but with more butter. Good base for all kinds of fruit fillings."
"0","2","I baked it as directed yet the dough.did not cook completely (maybe because i.used canned peaches and did not drain them completely), taste was very good"
"0","5","Yummy! The crust was just unbelievable delicious! And the recipe was so simple. Enjoyed baking and eating it."
"0","5","Loved it! I made this yesterday and it was a hit."
"0","4","I've had better, but this is good!"
"0","4","Really good desert..not time consuming at all. Pairs well with vanilla ice cream and Reddi whip"
"0","5","This Peach Cobbler was simply amazing. I only used 6 peaches and that was enough. It wasn't too sweet, it was light, it was delicious!"
"0","4","This recipe was pretty good. I did however alter the dough part adding nutmeg and cinnamon so that both dough and compote would merry properly. It tasted exactly like Moms."
"0","5","OMG..I made this cobbler and everyone from my family and friends to my barber were jaw locked. They loved it, and many requested a whole cobbler. Im a dessert baker amongst my circle a nd this recipe is a newly added favorite. It compares to my Great Grandmas'. The topping is delicious"
"0","5","I love this recipe, its not peach season so I used home canned peaches and they were amazing. I added extra cinnamon to the flour mix and a dash of nutmeg so the flavor carries through the whole thing. My boyfriend and I just LOVE the flavor.. there is no such thing as leftovers with this."
"0","5","this was an absolute HIT in my family....they are begging for more...."
"0","5","Made this recipe for my husband. He absolutely loved it! Will making again very soon."
"0","5","Excellent. Very easy to make."
"0","4","Very good cobbler recipe that got the approval from the worst critics (my friends & family). I did however have to double the batter recipe. I also cut down the cinnamon & nutmeg in half because I'm not a big fan of cinnamon and nutmeg. Other than that, it was amazing! I will keep using this recipe!"
"0","5","Made this using can peaches. Wonderful recipe. Everyone loves it each and every time."
"0","5","I've made this a few times already and am about to make it again for Christmas!! I follow the directions to the tee and I love, love, love it!!!!!!"
"0","5","This is my go-to peach cobbler recipe.It's gotten the stamp of approval from my family, and that is very important to me :)"
"0","5","Incredible...the crust is crispy throughout, not just at the sides. Flavorful and full of yummy!"
"0","5","My family loved this recipe! Especially my mother-in-law. She went to the farmers market and bought two huge boxes of peaches just so I could make more. It's such a popular dish in our family now! I did add 1/2 of tapioca to help it from running when you serve it."
"0","4","I always try to stick to a recipe as closely as possible the first time around, however I had to substitute canned sliced peaches instead of using fresh. I used two (large) 29 oz. cans. It made quite a bit of filling, just right actually. I drained all of the juice out of the cans and pressed as much as I could without squishing them. My review: This was a delicious cobbler, it had great flavor. I did my best to drop & spread the dough by spoonfuls and got pretty good coverage. My husband was disappointed because he was wanting the 'crust' to be more like a pie crust. This turned out to be more like an inch thick layer of cake. Really good, but not what I was looking for. Oh, and pretty sweet. I LOVE sweet stuff. You could probably cut back on the sugar and be ok. Please be sure to use an 8x8 pan. This recipe isn't written for a 9x13."

"0","5","Made peach cobbler for the first time using to recipe. It was perfect!!! I can't wait to make it again."
"0","5","Made this tonight and it came out great. I did use a pie crust to bake the peaches in - didn't change otherwise and it still tastes wonderful! My 6yr old even helped."
"0","5","THE ABSOLUTE BEST PEACH COBBLER RECIPE. thank you aeposey!"
"0","5","Delicious"
"0","3","The topping of the cobbler however was excellent, it was the inside of the cobbler that didn't taste too great. I baked the recipe just as it's written; no changes."
"0","5","everyone loved this.. I did not change anything"
"0","5","Delish delish delish!!! Wow this was great! I couldn't stop eating it! My peaches were not that fresh and they were on their last legs. I salvaged all I could for this recipe cutting out parts that weren't good anymore. And the recipe was still delicious! Yum!"
"0","5","It was great! Easy to make. Not the traditional crust I am used to for southern cobbler, but delicious."
"0","4","Very light and fluffy crust! I used 4 very large peaches and it made two dishes worth. Yummy! I kept my skins on the peaches, but I might peel them next time. For the topping, I needed to add more boiling water so that it would incorporate. I also sprayed my dishes before putting in the peaches. Finally, next time I will only bake it for 20-25 minutes. My crust was a little too dark, but still very good."
"0","4","It was close, but not quite the cobbler I was imagining. Taste wise, it was good ( even with the 29 oz. canned peaches I wanted to use up). I did up the cinnamon because I love it in cobbler, and per popular suggestion, I increased the topping, which resulted in a more biscuit-like, crunchy topping. I was hoping for a more cake-like texture. It was good, just not exactly the 'it' peach cobbler recipe I was looking for."
"0","5","I have never made a peach cobbler so my inexperience may sway my review but this recipe turned out great. My family loved it and it was so easy to put together in a short amount of time."
"0","5","This recipe was perfect! Peaches are not in season right now so I couldn't use fresh, so I had to substitute with two large cans of sliced peaches in heavy syrup. Because I didn't use fresh I cut the sugar back to 1/8 cup in the peach mixture and drained one of the cans of of peaches and omitted the lemon juice. Everything else I left the same. Based on other ratings I used 1 1/2 times the amount of stuff for the topping! It tasted great and my family loved it!!"
"0","5","Great cobbler recipe! My husband and I both agree it's awesome. I would definitely make this again and probably with other fruit too. We didn't find it too sweet, and I followed the recipe as is, although I was short a couple of peaches."
"0","5","This was the most delicious Peach Cobbler I have ever eaten and it was simple to make."
"0","5","Loved this recipe. I made it exactly as it instructed and I wouldn't change a thing. Simple, fresh and delicious."
"0","5","It's really easy to prepare. Had only 6 peaches and that was enough. Maybe next time it's better to reduce the amount of sugar mixed with peaches. Want to try this batter with canned apples and plums."
"0","5","Best cobbler ever. Best recipe I have made. I added some oats to the topping and sliced the peaches into big slices. (Just my taste.) We all loved it!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! This was easy to make, and was a hit. I served this as dessert after a very 'autumn' dinner and it went perfectly. I put extra cinnamon and sugar on top and cooked it about 35 minutes until it got nice and dark on top."
"0","4","This is definitely worth another attempt, but overall it was what I was looking for. Be careful not to overcook! I found that even an extra 5 minutes makes the topping a bit hard and began to dry out the dish. Also I would NOT recommend blanching the peaches in order to peel them. However even with my user-error, the taste was right on the money!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe on the grill to keep the kitchen cool. Mixed the peaches (in larger chunks as 1 reviewer suggested) with a few left over raspberries and tossed in ingredients mentioned in step 2. Covered in foil, then put on the top rack of grill while husband grilled chicken for dinner. Grill was about 300 degrees. When dinner was served, mixed topping then placed back on top rack of grill (300-325degrees) and let it cook while we ate dinner and cleaned up. After about 45 minutes, it had simmered and reduced to make a yummy, crispy topped dessert. Served with vanilla ice cream- the whole family raved."
"0","3","it was delicous not a good crust i improvised with oat meal"
"0","5","I've tried MANY recipes and this was the BEST!!!"
"0","5","Amazing peach cobbler, it was a hit with everyone"
"0","5","Wow! I am not a fan of fruit desserts but this has made me think twice! Made it for a family gathering this summer and everyone was so impressed. The only thing I wish I had was vanilla ice cream! Oh well, maybe next time because I will be making this soon!"
"0","5","Wonderfully adaptable! We substituted GF flour blend and sucanat ilo sugars and everyone loved it! For a family who very seldom gets sweets this was wonderful!!"
"0","5","This has to be THE BEST peach cobbler recipe ever! I used the jumbo peaches from Costco, which were slightly overripe. Didn't matter. The cobber just perfect in every way. My kids, that can't stand peach cobbler, wanted more! It was just awesome. Can't wait to make it again next summer."
"0","5","Made this with my fresh frozen peaches I put up last year, and it was excellent. I did add more cornstarch due to the fact there was more liquid than normal since they were frozen and thawed. Everyone loved it!!!!"
"0","5","We made this gluten-free, and it was great. I had 7 or 8 LARGE Colorado peaches, so I'm glad I went with a 9x13 dish. After doubling the topping, it still overflowed and made a bit of a mess in the oven. We used King Arthur All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour, and I used about 1 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar topping, and the amount of peaches to topping, baking time, temp, sweetness- everything was perfect. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!"
"0","5","Taste great"
"0","5","I made this for my local firefighters on 09/11 and they loved it! It's all gone. I followed the recipe except for the white sugar and cinnamon topping on the crust. I lightly sprinkled the top with sugar and cinnamon. I also added a bit of vanilla to the topping. I served it with vanilla ice cream, and it was a hit!"
"0","5","This 'crust' is what makes this so awesome. I omitted the nutmeg, added vanilla and only used Brown sugar and doubled the topping on a suggestion of another review, came out divine!!!"
"0","5","This was soooo good. I took the advice of another reviewer and made 1 1/2times the amounts of the batter mix. It was just the right amount. I agree with cutting the peaches in chunkier pieces! Also, I did not put the sugar mixture on top. It's just extra sugar that isn't needed - especially with a scoop of ice cream on top. :) YUM!"
"0","5","I made this for my mother-inlaw, who is famous for her peach cobbler, and she said it was better than hers! It was a hit and we have made for the second Sunday in a row. Delicious! ( the only change I made was doubling the recipe and I added 2 tsp of vanilla)"
"0","5","Delicious and easy. Followed the recipe exactly as written. I served with sweetened whipped cream that I had added a little vanilla to. Everyone loved it!"
"0","5","Absolutely loved this recipe. No need for adjustments its perfect. My husband isn't a desert guy buy pushed people aside for seconds of this. Only thing I would change is I would serve it with vanilla ice cream next time."
"0","5","Amazing! Have made it twice so far. You will be eating it out of the pan it's so good."
"0","5","Best peach recipe for this summer!!! My oven runs hot so down to 25 minutes. Did not change any proportions and mixture of brown and white sugar was right on. Perfect with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream! Thanks aeposey"
"0","5","I used canned peaches in light syrup, and sugar in the raw. This is definitely a family favorite!"
"0","1","I had to scrape the topping off and add more sugar . It was sour. I won't make it again. I fixed it and put a differant topping on it."
"0","3","I read some reviews before trying, but other than increasing cornstarch to 4 T, I made as directed. If I do this again, I will cook the peaches longer ahead of time. The liquid was so cloudy and soupy, the final product looked inedible. But because of the super-sugared top that had begun to burn, I had to pull it out of the oven! I would double the peach mixture baking time to 20 minutes to give the peach juice the chance to thicken. I would reduce the sugar/cinnamon topping by half. The only reason I gave it three stars was the taste. Also, may consider a larger dish as the bottom of my oven was wrecked with the two quart dish."
"0","5","Recipe was easy and worth more than 5 stars; so good that I made 4 in 3 days ..amazing ! You will not be disappointed"
"0","4","I made this for my family yesterday. I did blanch my peaches, because they were pretty hard. It did make them easier to peel. It turned out very good, as expected. I stuck with the original recipe, other than adding a tsp. Vanilla to the peaches. I agree with a previous review, I would make 1-1/2 of the crust next time. But, overall it was excellent."
"0","3","Not bad but not a fan of the biscuit topping. Still prefer crisp topping but thought I'd give this try anyway. It did have wonderful flavor though, but was a bit runny. If I make this again I will add more cornstarch to thicken it up a bit more."
"0","5","Well it was so delicious. The crust was very convenient all ingredients right there in my kitchen, did have to roll out the crust or purchase from crust from the store. WONDERFUL! ekayebinion"
"0","4","Pretty simple and good. I like how it went together."
"0","5","My grandpa is from the south, it's hard to compare to my grandmas cooking but I made this and he loved it!"
"0","5","This is the first time I've made cobbler, and this recipe was so easy to follow, it came out great!"
"0","4","I live in Central Europe and I've never heard about this here. It sounded interesting so I gave it a go. I like it, maybe a bit too much sugar for my taste but definitely tastes good and has an interesting texture!"
"0","2","Did an internet search for the highest rated peach cobbler and was directed to this recipe. Followed the recipe to a 'T' and, well...how do I say this...oh yes, yuck! Waste of time and good ingredients. Sorry but my search continues."
"0","5","I made This and it was a hit! This is the only recipe I will be using for Peach Cobbler ! Nana P"
"0","5","It was the best cobbler Ive ever made! Thanks for posting it."
"0","5","I made this recipe on breakfast and served it with yogurt for my husband and I drank almond milk. It was delicious and as my daughter said Super! The main alteration I made is substituting 2/3 cup of flour with Oat for a richer breakfast. I also reduced the amount of sugar to our taste. Since I only used 4 peaches (1/2 the quantity recommended)I used also 1 teaspoon of corn starch (the recipe calls for 2)but the juice of the peaches seemed to be too much so I pumped it out of the dish once baked (it seems that my peaches were big). I think I will use this juice on top of a toast as a snack. I did not have a baking dish so I used glass dish (Pyrex) and what I did is that I put the pyrex into a pan and poured boiling water in the pan and baked as instructed. Sprinkled walnuts on top, delicious! I will definitely make this recipe again."
"0","5","This was very good. Next time I think I'll add a few more peaches."
"0","4","The peaches on the bottom were fabulous (& I even had to use under-ripe peaches). The crust on the top was good (not great). Overall I liked the desert & will make again."
"0","5","This is the most delicious dessert! Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. TO DIE FOR!"
"0","5","Super easy to make! Mine turned out a little runny :/, but you couldn't notice, it was just that good! Sssoooo yummy!"
"0","5","This was my first try making peach cobbler and boy did it turn out good! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I made 2 small changes, I ran out of white sugar just shy of the 1/4 cup required for the topping (it was still sweet enough), and I only had 6 peaches so I also threw in an apple (still fabulous!). This is a really great recipe and so simple! If I made this again in the future I would probably use extra fruit."
"0","5","Wonderful! I'm not a nutmeg fan so I just used half the amount; however, I will omit it the next time I make this recipe 'cause I'm a super cinnamon fan and would like to taste just that spice with the peaches. The topping is delicious with the fresh peaches."
"0","5","This was super easy. I think the most time consuming part was preparing the peaches...but after that, super quick. It was also immensely delicious and was not to sweet at all. Perfect actually. I saw someone said that due to the amount of cornstarch it made it a cake like cobbler. I disagree, didn't seem cake like in the least. And did I mention it smelled delicious?!!"
"0","5","My first time ever baking peach cobbler. I was nervous and quite apprehensive because I've heard this this dish can go terribly wrong I.e runny, crust not crunchy etc. but I am excited to say it was super easy to make!! This is a winning recipe!!! Everyone loved it!! And I was feeding some harsh critics! If you ever thought about making this it's more than worth a try! A very big thank-you to whom ever shared this!"
"0","2","I did not like how this recipe turned out at all. Be careful when sprinkling the sugar and cinnamon on the top at the end. It will burn and harden the crust. Overall it was way to sweet and I couldn't eat it."
"0","5","So easy and really good!"
"0","5","This was excellent! I made two versions - one as above and another substituting the sugar with splenda. It was so good and I couldn't tell it was a 'light' version."
"0","5","i tried this and I loved it it is just the right amount for me and my hunny and extra if I have companie"
"0","5","This turned out really good as is. I did alter the recipe slightly, I didn't use 8 peaches, I only used 5 because they were huge peaches. I also didn't add the salt since I used salted butter. The only complaint I have is there isn't enough breading. I would like a bit more breading but it is a superb cobbler!"
"0","5","My 19yr old daughter thats an aspiring chef made this yesterday and it was delicious! Topping was good but going to try biscuits next time."
"0","5","Yum all the way!!!"
"0","4","My first attempt at making a cobbler of any sort, tested it with family who like their sweets. Even my oldest son enjoyed it, would make it again."
"0","4","This was yummy! I will be making it again. I did make 1 1/2 times the crust."
"0","5","Made this cobbler this weekend and it was great, some of my peaches were not quite ripe, so I used a little more sugar & corn starch and cooked it a little longer before adding the topping. I also left my peach slices thicker. My taster (Dad & sister) thought it was very good and they liked the cake-like topping. I'll be making this again."
"0","2","I was pleased with the topping and will continue to use that as my recipe for cobbler. The fruit part ended up mushy and tasteless, which could be due to the peaches I used. Although I reduced the sugar as many suggested, it was still way too sweet. I had been looking forward to the cobbler for about a week before I got the peaches and really wished it would be a five star recipe."
"0","5","The absolute best Peach Cobbler recipe I have ever tried....!!!"
"0","5","Family went goo-goo over this. This recipe is inline with what my grandmother and great grandmother made. Njoy."
"0","5","so easy and yummy. my fiancée couldn't eat it fast enough and there wasn't any left overs!!!!"
"0","4","Good served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","3","This was good but nothing spectacular. I'm still in search of the BEST peach cobbler."
"0","5","This was great! My new favorite. Very juicy, I served it on ice cream. However, you can serve it by its self. I had read one comment that it was dry. Mine was juicy not dry at all!"
"0","4","Okayyyy so I don't know if I'm not doing something right or if I'm in a high altitude but this recipe didn't work for me. The batter was too doughy. I have tried this recipe two times. And usually I can fix it the second time. However after the second, it still didn't turn out right. I really want this recipe to work because this is the only recipe I found with the crunchy topping. Any suggestions on what I may be doing wrong? Please and thank you !!"
"0","4","This is a great recipe! If you like the bread part of a cobbler, double that part of the recipe! (Use less sugar if you want it to be less diabetic-inducing, or try splenda as a substitute.)"
"0","5","I made two of these one night for my parents and they were a hit. Had to redo the dough once, but that was my fault, not the recipe's."
"0","4","Made this cobbler last night. It was really easy and very tasty."
"0","5","This was my first peach cobbler ever, brought it to a potluck and it was devoured!! Will make again!!"
"0","4","This peach cobbler was good. It's a simpler recipe that I've used before so that was a plus. I didn't read the directions and used unpeeled peaches. It's fine that way to me. Next time I'll not put the cinnamon sugar on top. It was not necessary and made the top kind of crunchy. Also, I only had to bake it for about 15 minutes after I put the topping on for it to be quite golden. I almost burned it."
"0","5","It came out perfect using the recipe as written. No changes needed. Delicious! Thank you for sharing."
"0","4","While I really liked the taste, I agree with other reviews that there is too little crust. Next time, I will omit the water in the dough and make crumbs, even though it will be more of a peach crumble then."
"0","5","This was excellent! We had company for dinner and I served Peach Cobbler for dessert. It turned out very well and was enjoyed by all. I followed the recipe closely -except for an extra teaspoon of cornflower, since the peaches were very juicy. Thank you sharing your recipe with us."
"0","5","i have made this twice this week. It is ABSOLUTELY DELUCIOUS. I added vanilla extract to the recipe and made double the side..YUM!!!"
"0","4","Yummy, but I guess I like a crisp better"
"0","4","Did it just as the recipe called. I did have to bake it for about 5 - 10 minutes longer because the crust wasn't done. It is best to have a thin layer of the crust over the whole pan in order for it to finish baking on time. There ends up being a lot of liquid in the pan. I think it will thicken in the fridge over night if there is any leftover, but I would also say to add more cornstarch to the peaches if you like a thicker sauce."
"0","5","Have made this recipe several times and it is absolutely wonderful. Have done the metric increase in order to make for a large crowd because I know my friends at church will enjoy this one!"
"0","4","I followed some suggestions from previous reviewers. I doubled the topping and it covered the 9 x 13 pan. I also added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch and the fruit was not runny, so I consider both modifications necessary."
"0","5","Very good!"
"0","4","Fantastically easy! It came out great. I did find the trick of putting the peaches in boiling water a great help. The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar. It did come out a little too sweet for my taste but my fiance and I both loved it. He can't wait for me to make it again!"
"0","5","This was a big hit for a summer dinner party.. Yummy!! I added a touch of vanilla and extra cinnamon, perfect touch."
"0","5","Very good! My whole family loved this."
"0","5","Very yummy!"
"0","5","love this cobbler recipe...I have made it several times, easy and delicious!"
"0","4","this was very good - my girlfriends loved it."
"0","5","Have never made peach cobbler before and this was so easy! But even better was how good it was. I wouldn't change a thing! I only had 6 large peaches on hand but made the rest of the recipe as is and it turned out great."
"0","5","So delicious and so easy! I added fresh blueberries and this was a delightful dessert, bursting with the gorgeous tastes and colors of summer! I did, however, exchange the cinnamon with vanilla because to me the flavor of cinnamon brings to mind autumn with its headier flavors and spices. Peaches, blueberries, vanilla, and lemon - are a perfect summery combination. A definite keeper. Thanks."
"0","5","Made this one last night for me and my husband. It was very good made as written...I made no changes. The peaches I had were perfectly ripe and sweet, there was no way this could have gone wrong. I will say the peach layer was a bit too runny. The next time I will add more cornstarch to prevent this issue."
"0","5","Very good peach cobbler. Hated to have to peel those fresh peaches, but would use fresh peaches again. Putting them in hot water for about a few minutes was easier to remove the peel. Very very good, but I think I left them too long in the oven, because they were a little too dark on top. Are they suppose to be that dark on top? They were not dry, lovely sauce from the peaches."
"0","5","The recipe was great, easy and best of all, delicious! I used 'green' peaches, so the flavors could have been increased if my peaches were more ripe. But other than that, there were no problems and I will be using this recipe again soon!"
"0","5","My family loved this recipe. Served warm with ice cream."
"0","5","This cobbler was perfect! I used fresh Georgia peaches and it turned out wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","5","Delish!!!! I would use this recipe again. A definite hit!!! Only recommendation is maybe having more topping. Someone mentioned adding about 50% more, and I think that would be ok. And I didn't need to cook it the whole 30 mins, I took it out after about 20."
"0","5","Love this recipe, especially the top crust!"
"0","3","Soupy peaches and the cobbler didn't cook completely in some areas. I baked it longer than the recipe stated to see if it helped and it did a little.. It had a really good taste though. I would give it another try just to see if it turned out the same. Hope not..not liking the soupy mess."
"0","5","I made this with a little more bread than called for, and it was the best peach cobbler my wife and I had ever tasted!"
"0","5","Very good"
"0","5","I tried this recipe last night and it was ABSOLUTELY delicious...we finished it the last night and I'm making another tonight... I did it EXACTLY as written...it was PERFECT... the best I've ever had."
"0","5","We loved this! It was not dry at all and my family really enjoyed this. We will be making this again soon!"
"0","5","I just made this peach cobbler today and I have to say 'TOUCHDOWN'!! The right sweetness and crust consistency!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This was so easy and turned out perfectly. I actually used self rising flour and a bit less sugar than recommended. I mixed the topping in the electric mixer. Very quick. Would be a good base recipe for different types of fruit."
"0","5","Loved it! It was delicious, even my hubby that's not really a cobbler person liked it. I only had 6 peaches so thats all I used but I still followed the directions to a tee and it was great. Definitely will make again :)"
"0","5","I needed a recipe for a cobbler topping and this one is a keeper. I did place the fruit in the oven for 10 minutes before adding the topping. I'd never done that before but it makes sense as that helps cook the bottom of the topping immediately. I chose not to add the final cinnamon and sugar coating. My family found it just the right sweetness without it. I recommend that the cobbler be eaten pretty much right out of the oven. Believe me, that wasn't hard to do as it smelled delicious and tasted even better! Left to sit, it can become a bit soggy."
"0","5","Received this recipe early this morning; made it using Splenda white and brown sugars. It was delicious - very easy - actually used 4 peaches and 2 nectarines. Had a lovely dessert for luncheon with friends. Thank you.egp"
"0","5","This is a great recipe! Everyone loved it! I added a pint of fresh blueberries to the peach mixture and it was awesome!"
"0","5","Beverly - I am a chocolate lover. But, I just made this. It has to be the best dessert I have ever tasted. Just a touch of tartness with the fresh peaches and lemon juice. With vanilla ice cream this cobblers to die for."
"0","3","I made this as written except used 3/4 cup brown sugar (no white) as my peaches are really sweet.. The topping tastes just like Bisquick! Was awful!! The peaches were great."
"0","5","omg this was incredible. i'm not such a big peach person so next time i'll just use apples. the nutmeg makes all the difference! don't skip it! oowey goowey sweet cinnamon goodness... yum!"
"0","5","just yum...nuff said"
"0","5","My new go to peach cobbler recipe! I used fresh peaches (and thanks for the tip on peeling the peaches easier!) and it came out great. I didn't change a thing. The cinnamon does make it difficult to see when to take it out. I ended up taking it out at 27 minutes and it was a nice consistency, crispy top and moist inside. Delish!"
"0","5","Great. Not a cinnamon lover when it comes to peaches so I cut back. Also sliced peaches thick, my preference."
"0","5","Delicious! Perfect blend of tartness and sweetness from the fresh fruit and topping. I used peaches that had bruised (we dropped them on the floor!) so there was a lot of juice by the time I peeled and sliced them, so I added an extra teaspoon of corn starch to the peaches (we made the 8-serving size). And I love that the dough is not the kind that bakes and gets absorbed into the fruit and juice so that it's almost like cooked dough and peaches rather than peach cobbler. This has the peaches, the delicious tart and sweet peach juices spiced with the perfect blend of cinnamon and nutmeg, and thickened by the cornstarch, and the delicious crust cooked with a crispy, cinnamon-sugar shell on the top. So good! Oh, because I made the 8-serving size, I felt it needed extra cooking time, so I cooked it an extra 15-20 minutes."
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly. I'm not normally a cobbler fan, but this was really good. Though I had marginal peaches, the sugars made up for the lackluster fruit. The only difference is that I used a 3 qt. glass pan. It filled it up completely. The 2 qt. would have been too small."
"0","4","I made this with very juicy fresh peaches. I would probably increase the cornstarch if that was the case next time. I also shouldn't have cooked the 30 minutes. I would have liked it better if the crust weren't quite so baked. Good flavor with the spices. I would probably make it again."
"0","5","Very tasty! Peaches were a little bit sour for my taste, next time I will add a tiny bit more sugar to the fruit filling only, the pastry top was perfect . But overall - excellent cobbler. I followed the recipe exactly and will make it again."
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly. I boiled my peaches for 2 minutes to help peal the skins as suggested, but I think I needed to boil and cool longer than suggested. I used Peaches that weren't too soft, so maybe that was apart of it, but regardless I was able to peal 50 - 80% of the peach with ease and then had to use my knife to remove the remaining. The Cobbler is delicious and will make again!"
"0","5","This turned out AMAZING! I can't stop going back into the kitchen for another spoonful. My peaches were hard and under-ripe, and I was concerned about how this would come out, but it's a fluffy, super sweet instant favorite."
"0","4","Added just a bit of minced fresh mint. Really good cobbler!"
"0","5","This absolutely the BEST recipe for me. I tried at for the first time one week ago. Will be making another one this week. It was so,so good and very easy to make."
"0","5","Being married to a Southern man, it has been hard to find a good peach cobbler recipe. This is my go to recipe now. It's so good that my son wanted this for his Birthday party instead of a cake! I do kick up my brown sugar to 3/4 cup tho. they like their peaches on the sweet side. I up my nutmeg to 1/2 tsp & cinnamon to 2 tsp. other than that nothing else. Thank you asposey for sharing!"
"0","5","I have wasted so many fresh peaches by using bad peach cobbler recipes that I was reluctant to cut up my gorgeous beauties and give this one a try, but I am so glad I did. This will be a staple in my summer kitchen going forward. I made only one change to the recipe to suit my families taste. I omitted the spices from the peaches and flour batter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top. We prefer the clean taste of peaches without the spice. I will agree that the cinnamon sugar on top makes it difficult to judge when golden brown has been achieved. I live north of Atlanta (elevation unknown) and I only had to cook for 25 to achieve perfection. This one is a must try!"
"0","5","My husband loves peaches; I hadn't made a cobbler in many, many years so tried this recipe. It was wonderful. I did not change a thing. Will be making this a lot during peach season. I want to try it with blueberries and also mango."
"0","5","I used fresh peaches and didn't change the recipe at all. It was delicious!!! My family and friends loved it!"
"0","5","I wouldn't change a thing! I don't understand some of the comments from others regarding changes. Made this for the first time yesterday. Family loved it! The recipe is going into my keep stack. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!"
"0","4","We really liked this. I've never made peach cobbler before and this turned out great! I only had 5 peaches so I only used a1.5 qt casserole dish and just barely scaled down the ingredients and it was delicious. We served it with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","This was really good. I made the recipe as is except I used frozen peaches in bags. Turned out perfect and the crust is wonderful tasting. Thanks for sharing your recipe aeposey"
"0","5","I subbed 2 lb. of fresh blueberries for the peaches and it was fantastic! I imagine most any fruit would do. It was a perfect cobbler. Lots of fruit, not too sweet, crispy on top, and not too cake-like. I don't know why someone said it turned out like biscuits. They must have done something wrong. Only thing, and maybe it was my oven, but I only baked it for 20 minutes after adding the batter. 30 was going to burn it."
"0","5","Yummy! This is easy to make and is so delicious. I made it exactly as shown on the recipe. Deserves a 5 star for sure!"
"0","5","I didn't change a thing and it was delicious!"
"0","5","I thought this was delicious. The cinnamon and nutmeg add another dimension of flavor. Definitely will make this again. I used frozen peaches that were overripe so I did add more corn starch. These peaches came off my tree last summer. Amazingly good. Also of note, I did not bake this the full 30 mins. Take a look under the topping to see if it is done. One person noted they couldn't tell if it was done because of the sugar/cinnamon topping. Mine was definitely done in 25 minutes."
"0","4","double the cornstarch if using fresh juicy peaches"
"0","5","I loved it, i even used the light syrup from the can in the mix since I did not have fresh peach's"
"0","5","This was perfectly amazing. I used peaches and plums and apricots!"
"0","5","Perfectly proportioned! This is the first time I used fresh peaches in a cobbler. The peaches were not perfectly ripe, but this recipe brought out the flavor. The top was awesome! I may have left in the oven a little longer than needed, but the little bit of edge chew was yummy! Thank you for posting my new go to recipe for cobbler."
"0","5","Made this recipe for colleagues and family. Everyone thought it is very good as for taste. Some felt the peaches could be softet. Overall, Excellent."
"0","5","Excellent. I made this as written except with frozen peaches. I put the peach mixture in the oven for 15 min because they were frozen. Other than that I followed it exactly and everyone loved it. I placed the topping on in spoonfuls but then smoothed it over. My family likes crisp and pie better but this is easy and they all had 2 helpings anyway."
"0","5","Soooo delicious. I followed the directions and voila a beautiful cobbler."
"0","5","Tasted good to me....especially with vanilla ice cream on top! I used frozen peaches from last year...next time I will use fresh off the tree this year."
"0","5","This is a 'I didn't think I like cobbler but we LOVE this recipe' review.  We have made it with fresh peaches from our tree, frozen peaches, frozen strawberries and blueberries. Each time it is fantastic.  The topping isn't dry and bland like most cobblers I have tried. The fruit juices thicken perfectly."
"0","5","I had only frozen peaches, and the dish was spectacular despite that. This is the best ever cobbler topping. It's worth the bit of work. I'm going to make another today using different fruit, maybe cherries."
"0","5","This is really good hot out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! It was easy to make, and the taste reminded me of my grandma's cobbler. Definitely use fresh peaches. Farmer's market, if you can find one."
"0","5","I have tried this recipe with both peaches and apples. Both where fantastic, best cobbler recipe, the topping is crunchy, light and abundant. When using apples I made a few changes, added orange zest and a bit of ginger."
"0","5","Made it and everyone loved it."
"0","5","very good the only thing I would change is I will roll the topping out like a pie crust next time and cover it. So very yummy"
"0","5","Easy and delicious!!!"
"0","5","I didn't have enough peaches, but supplemented with plums, and it turned out just fine!! It was a tad sweet for me (the fruit was VERY ripe as it was), so next time I will cut the sugar, but the instructions were easy to follow, and the whole family enjoyed this dish, so it will be a keeper!"
"0","5","Loved it."
"0","4","This cobbler had a great taste, but the crust is more like cake. If you are looking for a flakier crust this is not your recipe. I prefer a flakier crust too. I used canned peaches and still tasted great. Also this recipe wasn't to presentable. It was hard to spread the crust on top, seemed like it wasn't enough to spread so it didn't look to great at the table. I love to bake and decorate, I have all the right baking tools so I know it wasn't me. lol. Other than this, the taste was great. Give it 4 out 5 stars. Hope this helps."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly, and this was the best cobbler! Everyone that I served it to loved it. I made it several times also made it once with fresh apples. THanks for sharing the recipe."
"0","5","Outstanding as is!!!!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! I used a jar of peaches that I had canned and omitted the white sugar and added bluberries. My kids loved it. I can't wait until peaches are in season to try this again."
"0","5","Great recipe my family loved it!!!! Its a keeper"
"0","4","The peach cobbler was delicious but I like the more flaky breading."
"0","5","Just awesome!"
"0","5","Fabulous!!!!! The only thing was there was a little bit too much sugar so it was loose on the top. It still turned out great and of course everyone ate it all up with some good old vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","This cobbler is amazing and so easy. I've made it both with fresh peaches, and frozen sliced peaches, and both times turned out good. The fresh peaches had a more tender texture, while the frozen ones were a little crisper, but both were great."
"0","5","This was my first time trying to make peach cobbler and it was sooooo good. I doubled the recipe to make a 9*13 pan and it wasn't the season for fresh peaches so I used canned at it was still perfect!!!! I will definitely try this again and again and I can't wait. Thanks!!!"
"0","5","I've never made cobbler before, and this one turned out good. I used drained, canned peaches (that's what I had) and I sprinkled demerara sugar on top instead of mixing white sugar and cinnamon (out of sheer laziness). My brother-in-law said it's different than the traditional 'southern' style, but he said it was very good. I'm going to save this one."
"0","5","Love this recipe. It was so simple and easy to follow the results were great. Thank you"
"0","5","This was the first recipe for peach cobbler i tried, and it was wonderful! It would be helpful to know how big the peaches should be, in South Africa we have a large variety of peaches that greatly differ in size, I used about 500 grams of sliced peaches."
"0","5","Peaches are my favorite fruit, and this was seriously the most delicious dessert I had all summer. I used organic peaches that were a little underripe, and it didn't even matter - the cobbler was ridiculously good. I followed the suggestion of another commenter and made about 1.5 times the topping since I was using a shallower pyrex. Try it with vanilla ice cream. Just as good the next day!"
"0","4","This recipe is sooooo good a friend and i made it and it was a great success. Although, I do recommend putting a little less sugar in in but overall, simple and great tasting!!!!!"
"0","5","This was the first time I had ever made peach cobbler... It was out of this world!! My family loved it!! And it made lots!! We served it warm with some vanilla ice. I followed the recipe to a 'T' but I as well as others found that a 2 qt baking dish was not big enough. Therefore I used a 3 qt baking dish and doubled the topping only, not the cinnamon/sugar mixture as this was more than enough. The only problem I had, and this is no ones fault but my own, was that the topping did start to burn a tad bit because I have a wall oven and the coils are at the top rather than the bottom so it was too close to the coils. Just wanted to put that out there for others who have a wall oven or an oven with coils at the tops. Definitely will be making this one again!! Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","5","No! I haven't tried but, am going to. Just about anything from the south is great! Besides how do you mess up a peach cobbler? My grand kids is always telling me to make a peach cobbler..... Thanks for the recipe anyway and I will try yours."
"0","5","Hands down, the best cobbler I've ever had!!! The crust is absolutely delicious."
"0","5","Delicious, my fiance devoured this cobbler!"
"0","5","Best peach cobbler I have ever made! Did not have lemon juice so I made it without! It was YUMMY! I'm going to try it with apples next time! YUM!"
"0","3","well.. i needed to use my apples. i made this into an apple cobbler. was ok, but i like it much better as a 'betty' than as a cobbler.even if i had used peaches i like it where i have a mix of flour brown sugar and butter, then sprinkle that on top instead of blobs of stuff on top.more than likely will not make again"
"0","4","The taste was excellent but I wasn't a huge fan of the 'bread' part. I felt it was a bit too heavy but my husband liked it a lot."
"0","4","Yummy! And easy!"
"0","5","loved it"
"0","5","OMG! Tastes just like grandmas. It was so delicious I'm making two more for friends and family. It tastes even better on the second day. :)"
"0","5","This peach cobbler turned out wonderful!! I followed it exactly and it was very easy to make. For sure a keeper!!!"
"0","5","Very good. This was maybe the third time I can recall having peach cobbler in my entire life. Definetly a winner."
"0","5","This recipe was AWESOME!!!!! Really easy and everyone LOVED it! Even my hard to please brother in law who was literally speechless after his first bite! A must save recipe! Thank you!"
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious I added blueberries to the recipe and served with hot custard"
"0","4","Well, it was pretty good. I did end up doubling the topping mixture, which made a big difference. Plus I threw in some chopped walnuts. That made it over the top for me. Oh, and I didn't have lemon juice so I used a little lime juice. It was ok, but I'm sure it would've been better if I had lemon juice, to add a little tartness. But overall it was a great recipie."
"0","5","Really good right out of the oven with vanilla icecream."
"0","4","I loved this peach cobbler recipe and my family loved it!"
"0","5","I love peach cobbler but have been afraid to make it because I have had so many cobblers that were awesome...Well this recipe is Awesome and my family loved it. I must admit I love top and bottom crust so I used a separate recipe for my crust. The spices and sugar make this a keeper for me and my family."
"0","4","Very good. Be aware that the cinnamon should be one teaspoon, not tablespoon. I also agree that thin sliced peaches are not so great. I like thicker slices or chunks.  The amount of cornstarch called for was not enough, so up it, possibly to 2 T. I upped the butter to 8 T as well.  I piped the topping on instead of spooning it on. It may not have turned out quite the same, not sure, but it certainly looked nice.   Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","Excellent cakey-cobbler texture."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful...will definitely make this again!"
"0","3","Way too sweet and I wasn't crazy about the topping. Followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","Hands down the best cobbler recipe I've ever tried."
"0","4","Used real peaches in Sept of 2012.  Good with vanilla ice cream.  Leftovers got soggy."
"0","5","Awesome recipe. I made it once for a work potluck and I received so many compliments! Real easy to make!"
"0","5","More then delectable! Perfect amount of spices."
"0","5","Although I have used AR for years, I have never rated a recipe, until now. This IS the best peach cobbler I have ever had and served. My husband and I are both raised in Texas and this one is better than any cobbler we've had. I made 50% of the topping as suggested and it was perfect. As per my hubby, 'best cobbler of his life' !"
"0","5","amazingly fantastic"
"0","5","Great Recipe! I did make a few changes, as I doubled the corn starch because I had a lot of juice. I also added a 3 Tbl Sp of butter to the peaches. I used 1/4 of cold milk instead of the boiling water, easier. Hate to make changes to a recipe then rate it, but made as written is also great. Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","Love this cobbler. Double the top if you remember."
"0","5","This IS the best recipe for cobbler. It works with 4 peaches, too. Just put it in a buttered glass loaf pan."
"0","5","Outstanding - made this for the family and was gone in no time!"
"0","5","Perfect with ice cream!"
"0","4","I enojoyed this cobbler and will make it again. I followed the recipe for the most part...I ended up using 5 fresh peaches and I eased up on the sugar a little bit. Some reviewers seemed concerned with the cooking time but I found it to be just right.   Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I haven't made peach cobbler in a while and this one was superb! Just make sure that when you drop the spoonfuls of topping that you smooth it over the peaches to make a nice even covering!"
"0","4","The filling has a great consistency. I added some fresh minced ginger. The topping has a bit too much salt for me. Next time I will cut the salt in half."
"0","5","Amazing recipe. Wowed my friends, they offered to supply me with the ingredients for as many as I'm willing to make. The smell while baking was heavenly. Used a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg, but other than that all original. Really enjoyed making and sharing this dish."
"0","5","LOVED this. Served with Vanilla ice cream and everyone had seconds. Could make with any fruit - berries, apples, etc!!"
"0","5","Without a doubt, this is the BEST peach cobbler I have ever had! Everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","This wasn't the old-fashioned cobbler I remember, but still quite good. Delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Wasn't sure if this was going to turn out as I used frozen peaches that we had picked last summer. There was a lot more liquid than I thought that there was going to be, but it turned out great. I didn't add the extra sugar and cinnamon to the top as I thought that it was already sweet enough. I also didn't add the nutmeg because I didn't have any, but I substituted the same amount of pumpkin spice and it was just as good. The only thing that would have made it better was a dollop of home made whipping cream or vanilla ice cream."
"0","3","Not a horrible recipe however, I'm used to things being sweet. The crunchy bread topping over the peaches is a great consistency but a little bland for my likeing. If I make this again, I will be sure to add extra sugar and maybe some vanilla. Fairly easy recipe to make though. Perfect recipe for someone not wanting overly sweet cobbler."
"0","5","I am looking for a 6th star for this recipe. No leftovers at all!"
"0","2","I made this exactly as written, peeling fresh peaches and all, and was disappointed. The cobbler topping was very bland. I'll keep looking, thanks."
"0","5","My 20 year old son pronounced this a 'keeper'. The only change I made was doubling the cinnamon and nutmeg in the peach mixture. I'm not a huge peach fan, but this was really tasty. I may modify it for use with apples or mixed berries."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly! Its the best peach cobbler I've ever had!!! YUMMMMM"
"0","5","I never write online reviews, but this time I simply had to because this recipe is SO delicious, and easy! The cobbler topping has great texture and flavor, as do the spices on the peaches. I made it my own by keeping the peach skins on, eliminating the nutmeg and lemon juice, and also eliminating the extra cinnamon sugar topping. YUM!!!"
"0","5","I am very funny about peach cobblers. This by far was the best!"
"0","5","Delicious!!! First time I had tried 'real peach cobbler', and it was excellent! I didn't change anything in the recipe and everyone thought is was superb. I've already shared this recipe with others!"
"0","5","Perfect! Made it as per the recipe, no substitutions and it was amazing. Thank you!!"
"0","3","I was disappointed after reading all the good reviews. Won't make again."
"0","4","I had over ripe peaches and made it in a 9x13 pan so i didn't have a really thick crust. It turned out great will make it again"
"0","5","The top of mine was too dark when I checked it 5 minutes early, so I will cover the top with foil towards the end the next time that I make this, but everyone in my family loved it, with or without vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","My neighbor gave me quite a few peaches fresh from his tree. This was the perfect dessert to make using those peaches. I had to omit the cinnamon because my husband hates it, but the nutmeg gave it enough spice. 30 minutes seemed too longer for my oven - - I went more with 23-24 minutes. Great served with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Aeposey."
"0","4","Loved it! Just a bit too much sugar though..."
"0","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE this peach cobbler. I don't peel the peaches and usually set the butter out on my deck when i start slicing peaches and it is ready by the next part. Really delicious."
"0","5","This recipe was fantastic! I was a bit heavy handed with the cinnamon and nutmeg, but I really think it was the peaches that did it. I've heard that the peach season is really good this year, due to the drought because the peaches are not being waterlogged. With that in mind I also reduced some of the white sugar. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"
"0","4","This was really yummy, but I made a few changes/additions based on my preferences. Since my peaches were extra ripe, and I don't like a lot of sugar in my desserts anyways, I omitted all of the white sugar and reduced the brown sugar amounts a bit too. I only used white sugar in the sprinkled topping, but 3/4 of the suggested amount. I didn't have cornstarch, so just used about 1 tsp. of flour instead.   As an extra topping, once everything was finished baking, I added shaved almonds and sprinkled some fresh blueberries on top. It added great texture and a nice contrast of flavours. When reheating it, I warmed it in the oven for a bit with the almonds, but not the blueberries (added those at the table).  Next time, I think I'll add a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg than suggested by the recipe, as I found it could have used a little more. But overall, a fantastic dessert for peach-lovers!"
"0","5","Delicious! No changes necessary in this recipe. And a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top makes it pure heaven!"
"0","5","Excessive!"
"0","5","Just like the peach cobbler my late mother used to make years ago on the farm. Loved every bite, could have eaten the whole thing by myself, but used restraint. Next time I will leave out the 1/4 cup of white sugar in the dough topping, a little to sweet for my taste."
"0","5","Loved this! I used good ol' NY peaches and nectarines and this came out so good! It was gone in less than a day. My 5 yr old said he doesn't like peaches but said he couldn't resist it after 'smelling a delicious smell'! Thank you and we will be making this again!"
"0","5","This was the best cobbler I have ever had...and super easy. Fresh peaches off my tree were small this year, so I washed them but didn't even bother to peel them. No one even noticed! (yes, I sliced and seeded them) I used thicker slices and it was delicious!"
"0","5","We liked this better the second day and served cold"
"0","5","Made EXACTLY as written for 2 servings size! DELICIOUS!!! Thank you for sharing such a GREAT easy to make recipe!!"
"0","5","This was the best peach cobbler I have ever had! The topping came out perfect. It had a nice (but not to hard) top crust, that was soft (but not doughy) underneath. I didn't make any changes to the recipe except used one less peach due to the peaches being large. I will definately make this again, exactly as written!!!"
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly and it came out great! LOVED it. Not sure why people say they need to make 50% more of the topping unless they are using wrong size baking dish. It calls for 2 quart and I only had 2.5 quart and it was fine. I also only had 6 peaches vs. the 8 the recipe called for and that was fine too. will make again and again!"
"0","5","Delicious, better with fresh peaches and the 60 seconds of the peaches in boiling water then cold water help with taking off the skins. I would double the topping to completely cover the cobbler but it was fantastic!"
"0","5","This was soo good my family n friends love it!!"
"0","5","Phenomenol! Used 1 extra T butter in the crust BECAUSE we used whole wheat flour and sucanat (raw sugar), with a touch of white sugar sprinkled on top, and everyone loved the WW crust the most. It was almost nutty in flavor, with a bit of crisp, a bit of tender, and something almost magical. The crust was amazingly simple. No other crust has been so simple without resorting to oats (I like oats, but my husband doesn't - so this is a great find). The filling is very, very easy as well, outside of peeling peaches, which is only time consuming if you have itty bitty peaches like we did. Since we were using Indian peaches from a friend's trees, I did some research to figure out about how many pounds of peaches this would be, and from what I found, 8 peaches is approximately 2 1/3 pounds. I don't know if that is accurate, but it worked for us (we were using up 43 small Indian peaches, which worked out to about 3 1/2 pounds, so we used 1 1/3 times the recipe, and it was just wonderful...., However, I might be tempted to have more crust next time....., then again, I might be tempted to have more fruit next time..... well, either way, it WILL be WONDERFUL! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!"
"0","5","Delish! Followed the recipe perfectly and it is now my go to peach cobbler recipe!"
"0","5","just made your Peach Cobbler and it is so amazing tasting...i can't believe i made this...excellent dish...everyone should be making this right now as the peaches are out and ripe for the picking.."
"0","5","It was awesome!! The whole family loved it!! WE did do the topping + 1/2 more. It was perfect!"
"0","5","this was the best cobbler i have had in a very long time, my whole family loved it, now my daughter wants it all the time."
"0","5","This recipe is just mouth-watering! Awesome and easy!"
"0","5","Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and ate it while it was still hot with cool whip. My husband, who is not a dessert eater, loved it. Now, the peaches I used were not ripe, they were pretty hard, it was difficult peel. My fault, I could've waited another day or two. I also sliced the peaches somewhat thick. I believe that the fact that the peaches were not very sweet kept this dish from being cloyingly sweet and because they were thickly cut, did not desintigrate. If my peaches were ripe, I would cut back on the sugar. As to the texture, this is a cobbler not a crisp. I absolutely LOVED the cake part and fresh off the oven, it was crispy. I also used an 8x8 pan, and it was perfect. Great recipe, watch the sugar."
"0","5","Incredible, even with the 6 peaches I used, as that's all i had left. The peaches don't necessarily need to be fully ripe, as long as there is no green on the skin. If you're looking for an excellent peach cobbler recipe, look no further!"
"0","5","VERY GOOD!"
"0","5","This was so good! And quick to make. Not only did my boyfriend give it rave reviews, but my son ate it and loved it! He would never try cobbler in the past."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Absolutely delish!"
"0","5","Love this cobbler! I do twice the crust and add a little vanilla! Delicious with nothing else than vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","I have been making this every other day - absotutely delicious."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly -- absolutely delicious! This was very simple to make and the results were outstanding. Fresh peaches from a roadside stand in Georgia may have been the key."
"0","5","Very simple to make, and very good!"
"0","5","I made the recipe exactly as written except I cooked it in a slow cooker. It cooked on high for 2 and half hours with a kitchen towel under the lid to soak up the moisture. My hubby and our guests raved. I will definitely be making this again."
"0","5","Delicious! I absolutely loved it!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe many times already and each time has turned out great. I even once made this during the winter with lower quality supermarket peaches and it still turned out fantastic!  Wonderful recipe."
"0","5","This cobbler is very good. I almost didn't make it because it looked like a lot of work but it really wasn't so bad. The only thing I would change, I think is to reduce the cinnamon/sugar sprinkled over the top to 2 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Other than that, definitely a winner. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
"0","5","Made this as directions stated and it was WONDERFUL! The only thing I did differently was .. to use MIssouri Peaches:) Yummy! Will definately make this again!"
"0","4","Delicious recipe in which I made a few modifications (which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Doubled the dough, doubled the cornstarch, omitted the cinnamon in the peach mixture, decreased the cinnamon in the topping mixture by half. My family loved this and is asking for more! Thanks for sharing aeposey!"
"0","4","This was my first try with a peach cobbler. Just moved to south and wanted to use fresh peaches. Yum! I followed recipe and it came out good but there is something off that is not cobbler. I will keep trying different recipes."
"0","5","Really yummy....also the topping turned out great :-)"
"0","5","Made this for my very 'Southern' husband. He said it is the best he has ever had. This recipe is a keeper for us!"
"0","4","Very basic. Very easy. I doubled the topping recipe for a little more density."
"0","5","Yummy !!! And tastes great the next day when I reheated in the microwave. I can't wait to make it again."
"0","5","I'm visiting the South and made this for our friends and they thought it was the best Southern style peach cobbler they'd ever had. I did use fresh Georgia peaches and I did't sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar on top. It was plenty sweet as is. Yummmmm!"
"0","4","My husband loved it (reason for the four star rating) however I did not share his enthusiasm (I would give it a three). The filling was very runny despite adding an additional 2tsp of corn starch. The topping called for entirely too much sugar and cinnamon; it also came out too crisp. It was good, but I plan to try another recipe next time."
"0","5","This dessert was awesome! I didn't have 8 ripe peaches, so I used 5 peaches and 1 pint of blueberries. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream, and it was a big hit for Sunday dinner. I didn't bother to peel the peaches, and they were fine."
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe! I've been searching for a good one and found a great one. Thank you!"
"0","5","So good, quick, and easy. I used frozen peaches. Delicious! Will be the only one I will use from now on."
"0","3","This cobbler is just very OK... which surprised me after having such a high rating.  This recipe is, as others have said, very cakey. Which is bad in my opinion. The flavor is nice but pretty basic. It's also easy to make, as others have said. (We added raspberries to half of the cobbler, which was a nice variation). But the cakey cobbler part is a bummer. It should be more like, well, cobbler.   My search for the perfect cobbler recipe continues..."
"0","5","Best peach cobbler we have ever eaten! We loved the cake like topping vs the typical crunchy kind. Definitely try this recipe at least once =)"
"0","5","I made this last summer and it instantly became my new favorite dessert. I can't wait to make it again when peaches are in season. This recipe is amazing!!!"
"0","5","I have been looking for a long time for a peach cobbler recipe. I tried this one and it was excellent. Move over sweet potato pie."
"0","5","This is the best cobbler that I have ever eaten!"
"0","5","This was by far the most amazing peach cobbler recipe I have ever eaten or made. Wow. Nice balance of sweet fruity goodness with the cakey like topping. yummm"
"0","5","Great cobbler!! My hubby isn't a sweets guy and he had TWO helpings! Success! :) I used canned peaches and it was STILL delish!!"
"0","2","This was just way too sweet, no one ate it."
"0","5","Oh. My. God. This is SO delicious!!! I have tried other cobbler recipes in the past, but this is the only one from now on! I used fresh Michigan peaches that I got from the country farmstand. Also, I made it gluten free by substituting Pamela's Products Gluten Free Bread Mix and Flour Blend for the flour."
"0","5","Delicious, won't change a thing the next time I make it - and there most definitely will be a next time."
"0","5","I cut down on the sugar like other reviewers said because I also used fresh peaches and they were very ripe. It turned out heavenly! One of the best cobblers I have ever had. I will be keeping this recipe for sure!"
"0","5","Very good!! I substituted 1/2 tsp vinegar for the lemon juice, since I didn't have any on hand. Worked out great!"
"0","5","I made this exactly as is minus the nutmeg and extra cinnamon on top and it was perfect, maybe the best fruit dessert ever."
"0","5","This was excellent! I did add a little cinnamon to the dough."
"0","5","Amazing!!! I wanted to eat the entire thing! very simple, I was worried because it seemed like a lot of steps, but it was easy and the best cobbler Ive ever had/made!"
"0","5","This turns out very well with drained canned peaches if you can't find good fresh ones in your area. Love the cake part!"
"0","3","Funny how we measure things so precisely but then there is '8 fresh peaches.' Huh? Well I used 8 fresh peaches -- unfortunately this filled a 3 quart dish so I had to increase all the measurements by 50%. While tasty (tasted just like you would expect it to) I did have to drain a river full of excess peach juice. I also recommend about 50% more topping mix as it was somewhat thin. Mine took 27 minutes to cook in step 4 -- watch out, the crust burns fast!"
"0","5","Lovely fresh peach cobbler! I didn't change a thing, and it turned out perfectly."
"0","4","Serving count is bad. I made it X 1.5 in a 3qt baking dish and would say 12 servings or more."
"0","5","Just fabulous! The only change I'll make next time is I'll make a double batch!"
"0","5","My daughter made this and was the best peach cobbler I have ever had! Loved it!"
"0","5","Scrumptious! 8 peaches was a lot....it overflowed my 2.25 qt. Dish. I increased the topping recipe by half and it was perfect. I also used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with the fruit. Everyone loved it but I think I will use only 6 peaches next time."
"0","5","Super EZ and Tasty."
"0","5","double the topping"
"0","4","First time making this. We doubled the topping recipe and added an extra tsp of water. We also used peaches in a glass jar instead of fresh. Great!"
"0","5","This was easy and delicious! It got rave reviews from all ages (1 to 75 years!). I did not add any salt, and I used less than half of the sugar in both the topping and the fruit mixture. It was fabulous!"
"0","5","Best peach cobbler I have made in years. I made it exactly as the recipe directed. The only change I will make next time is to make more crust. Probably 1 1/2 times or possibly double. Otherwise it's perfect."
"0","4","This is a pretty good recipe, i used a extra peach and it was still okay. I would reduce the cinnamon next time, it over powers the peach taste. Fairly easy to make, had everything on hand. My husband would give it 5 stars because he ate 3 servings!"
"0","5","Yum! Easy & delicious recipe. The family loved it! Will be making again...thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! I had been longing for goo peach cobbler. This is going to be the recipe. I didn't change a thing and it turned out beautifully and yummy. My husband who isn't that crazy about sweets, liked it. It's so easy that my 11-year old son helped and enoys making this recipe with me. This is the second time in 2 weeks I have made this, and used light brown sugar this time. Just as wonderful as the first. I always buy my fruit 3 days to a week ahead of time so they can have time to ripen/sweeten. If I plan ahead, a week in the fridge, or last minute, 3 days on the counter. When I peel the peaches, the aroma makes it hard for me not to eat them :)"
"0","5","Didn't change a thing! If I could give it another star I would. Scrumptious!"
"0","4","This was fantastic and very simple to make."
"0","5","Loved this recipe. Takes a long time to peel peaches. Used lots of peaches from our tree, way more than 8. I just filled my pyrex baking dish untll it was full and I was tired of peeling the peaches. It took @ an hour. I doubled the topping as some others suggested and it covered the top. Came out yummy & husband loved it."
"0","5","This was great. I followed a couple of reviewer's advice and added 50% to the cobbler portion of the recipe. (We like breadier cobbler) I also used 12 peaches instead of 8 and sliced them thicker. (See photo by me, Candice, I think #64.) I did not use the full cinnamon/sugar mixture on top, but that was my personal preference. I think peaches are sweet enough-and I have a HUGE sweet tooth. *I used ripe peaches from my backyard's peach tree*"
"0","5","Very, very good. I made exactly as written except I made 1.5 of the cobbler dough as advised in several of the reviews. It filled a 9x13 pan and cooked in approximately 20 minutes. Mine looked exactly as shown in this photo - a recipe I will use often."
"0","5","Didn't have all ingredients; used canned peaches so I reduced white sugar a bit, used flour instead of corn starch, used regular butter instead of unsalted butter (still used recommened 1/2 ts. salt), and I didn't have lemon juice so I skipped that. Great starter recipe if you're hankerin' peach cobbler... you can sub out any ingredient and it still turns out GREAT! Keeper!!"
"0","5","Excellent! The Only thing I would do is mulitply the topping by half, that way you get enough to cover the peaches and give you a good crust but not completly soak up the sugar sauce and juices from the peaches."
"0","4","Very good, though I think it could have used a lot more peaches. Just personal preference though."
"0","5","it's funny that this is the recipe of the day, because I just made it 2 days ago with fresh peaches from a relative's peach tree! It came out so well, everyone loved it! The peaches are perfectly sweet and carmelized and the crust is cakey enough without it being dry. It was delicious with French Vanilla ice cream. easy recipe with delicious results."
"0","5","I have tried a bunch of different recipes for cobbler and this is my absolute favorite! I cut the peaches thicker as one reviewer suggested and it always gets rave reviews!"
"0","5","very good recipe. Cobbler topping was a good texture contrast to the sweet filling. I topped it with unsweetened fresh cream to balance the sweetness of the peach filling. Overall, a huge high five from my family."
"0","5","Amazing!!!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT! Made this for dinner with my in-laws and was a huge hit."
"0","5","I thought this was an amazing recipe. I had to double the recipe since I was using a lot of peaches, but i had no major problems and it turned out delicious! I will definitely use this again."
"0","5","This was AMAZING...my boyfriend said I need to start baking EVERY day. It's a keeper!"
"0","5","This is an awesome recipe. My husband loved it so much I made it for him two days in a row."
"0","5","Very easy and absolutely delicious!!"
"0","4","I love to cook from scratch and usually that can be lots of trouble. This recipe is so easy and so tasty. I have made it twice and it was a big hit for each function. This was the best!!"
"0","5","Friends and family loved my Peach Cobbler.  I made my Peach Cobbler for 6 servings, in a 9x13, also bake time was WAY WAY WAY too too long! my tops got burnt, but another trial run when peaches aren't so expensive will be excitedly expected. Maybe tops burnt because HEAT in oven is TOO HOT?!  Thanks again, hope this helps ANYBODY &Everybody!"
"0","3","directions for baking were not very clear. especially for someone who has never made cobbler. but tasted good."
"0","5","This is THE best peach cobbler! I made a different recipe the first time I ever made peach cobbler, but there is no comparison! I've made this twice, both times with canned peaches(I used 2 cans of light syrup and 2 cans of regular for whole batch), and it came out amazing! The spices are perfect and the nutmeg really makes it to die for. I followed the recipe exact and there's no need to change it. Other reviews said they needed more crust, but I think its the right amount."
"0","5","Yum, yum, yum and YUM! I chose this cobbler because of it's rating. The reviews gave it 4 1/2...I'm giving it a 5! Thank you aeposey for sharing this delicious gift with us all. It's my first time making a peach cobbler and it is also my father's day dinner gift to my hubby and he is well pleased! Again...many thanks!"
"0","5","I added blueberries to mine and used orange juice instead of lemon because that's what I had on hand. It also cooked much faster than the recipe indicates - glad I checked it or my topping would've burned! Delish!"
"0","5","This was the best peach cobbler I've ever made or ate period! Such an easy recipe and the topping was perfect! Next I'm going to try the same recipe with apples!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! It was the hit at my niece's graduation party and the only thing left was the pan! Only modification was that I used Vietnamese cinnamon to add that pa-yow to it!"
"0","5","Yummm! This is a great cobbler. I've made hundreds of different recipes and this is by far the best. Served warm w/vanilla ice cream, oh my god it's to die for."
"0","5","Loved it!!! The first time I made this, after combining the dry ingredients it resembled coarse meal as mentioned in the recipe, but after I added water it turned into the consistency of oatmeal. I wasn't sure if this was normal because I didn't see anything like that mentioned in other reviews. I kept going and added it on top of the peaches. It came out wonderful! It tasted kind of like cinnamon bread/cake.   Also, its really lumpy when spooning on top of the peaches so I usually spread it a little with my fingers or spoon.  Not sure if other people have had this happened to them but it still came out great!  I don't usually have fresh peaches hand so I used 4 15 oz canned peaches. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","I agree with the extra topping double and increase of butter. YUM."
"0","5","A bit too sweet, but not necessarily a bad thing."
"0","4","I had never made or even had cobbler before but I found peaches on sale and was in the mood for some southern food. I found this recipes and give it a shot. It came out wonderfully! My boyfriend and I gobbled half of it up and to save our waistlines, I brought the rest to work and watched my co-workers do the same."
"0","5","i made it on saturday for 22 people and everyone loved it. this is defenetly a do again recipe thank you for posting it."
"0","5","Awesome! Also made it with apples. Yum."
"0","5","Best peach cobbler I've had."
"0","3","Too much nutmeg."
"0","5","Awesome, not too sweet, perfect! I like larger chunks of peaches and I like double cake topping."
"0","5","EXCELLENT! Added a bit more cinnamon. Topping was crunchy on top. Family loved it."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I picked fresh peaches at a nearby orchard with my kids for this recipe. I didn't change a thing and this was so easy and scrumptious! Thank you!"
"0","5","Simple recipe, but oh so yummy! I needed to use some peaches before they spoiled, I only had 6 and it was the perfect amount!"
"0","5","This is the BEST, BEST peach cobbler ever. I used splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown because I have type 2 diabetes. Everybody in the house was fighting over the last little bit!"
"0","4","Super easy and delicious recipe, but needs some adjustments for our tastes. After some experimenting, we doubled the sugar, spices, and cornstarch and made 1.5x the topping for 8 cups of fresh peaches from our peach trees. The cinnamon-sugar topping is to die for and makes the dough crispy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: I just made this cobbler again with apples from our garden, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1.5x the topping and recieved rave reviews and many requests for the recipe."
"0","5","OMG is this ever yummy! I made three changes: 4t cornstarch that was recomended, 8 T butter that was recomended, and I made an extra half batch of topping...Also, I put it in a little bigger dish... It does need to be baked the full 30 minutes or longer my dough was a little underdone, but so good!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! Peach cobbler has always been my fav but I've never made it until I came across this recipe. Reminds of my grannys' when I was little. I will make it again soon!"
"0","5","I didn't change a thing, turned out fantastic!"
"0","5","So good!"
"0","4","Very good. I only had 6 peaches but it worked ok. Followed recipe exactly but was runny; not sure how if it is going to still stay crusty on top as it is stored. I'm not sure how to keep it thicker vs runny for future baking?"
"0","5","This may be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life! I'm ashamed to say, I made it with canned peaches, so I cannot wait to make it with fresh peaches very soon!! Maybe tomorrow? ;)"
"0","5","I've had good peach cobbler before, but this stuff is amazing! I'm definitely making more as soon as I pick more peaches. The only thing I did differently was to melt the butter with the boiling water and increase both to 1/2 cup (I was feeling lazy)."
"0","5","THE BEST!!!! And SO easy."
"0","5","This was my first attempt at peach cobbler, and I'm happy to say it was a success!! The recipe was quick and easy, and the results were delicious!! I will be making this one again and again. Highly recommend!"
"0","5","VERY good and VERY easy. 5 stars+++++"
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic - the family is happy...:)"
"0","4","Pretty good recipe. I used a recipe and a half for the topping, and still could have used a bit more to get as much as I wanted. I also added about 3x as much cinnamon as called for. I think next time I will use a wider, more shallow pan as opposed to the 2 qt. dish as called for. All in all, though, it's a pretty tasty recipe!"
"0","3","To me, this recipe was just OK. I've only tried one other cobbler before (I usually do crisps) and I preferred that one to this and it seemed to be easier."
"0","3","taste good.i had a little trouble with 2nd sentance of directions.ended up useing less corn starch.came out soopy.it'salittle missleading. added alittle grand marnier too.might have added to the soopyness as well"
"0","5","Excellent! I doubled the recipe and added blueberries-delicious!"
"0","2","Made per another reviewers suggestion and used 1 1/2 c. each of flour, sugar and milk as a topping. Neither I nor my guests were impressed with this at all, even with vanilla icecream.....Would not make again. Sadly enough I don't even think it was the topping."
"0","5","followed exact recipe - awesome"
"0","5","Family loved it and so did i"
"0","3","This recipe was so-so for me. I used 6 ripe peaches, and about a cup of bing cherries that I wanted to use up before they went bad. I used splenda baking sure instead of the white and added some chopped pecans to the batter. I think I would have enjoyed this more if it was all cherry. Guess I'm not a peach fan after all. Hubby liked it and he eventhough he hates sweets. Will try again but with all cherry or possibly berries."
"0","5","Delicious and easy - the topping is sooooo good!"
"0","5","Very Very good recipe!!!Didn't change a thing."
"0","5","I am new to baking and I have made this peach cobbler perfectly. My family loves it and will make it for every holiday."
"0","5","I made this the other night and it was really good! This ones a keeper!"
"0","5","Excellent! Great taste and texture. I took a couple hints from others and added a little extra cornstarch. I used about 2.5 teaspoons instead of 2, but my peaches weren't quite ripe so there wasn't too much juice. If you had really juicy, ripe peaches, I would add closer to 3 teaspoons. I used a 9' x 9' glass pan and baked for 25 minutes. It came out great."
"0","5","I made this yesterday and it was delicious..best cobbler recipe EVER!!"
"0","5","I had some fresh peaches to use up and my Grandma loves peach cobbler! Factor in your amazing recipe and we had a perfect combination! Thank you so much for sharing this absloutely delicious recipe, I took it to Grandma's and shared with my Grandma, Mom & cousin and all 3 kept going on and on about how wonderful it was. Didn't/wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","5","Super Delicious - I used premade crust though so I'm not sure how that turns out. I will definitely be making this again and again!!"
"0","5","delicious! Cut thepeaches a little more chunky."
"0","5","This peach cobbler was phenomenal!!! My family loved it!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe, very easy and delicious. I added 2 tsp of minced fresh ginger and 1/4 tsp of ground ginger to the peach mixture, and it turned out great!"
"0","4","Good recipe.. but when they say 'baking dish' they do NOT mean glass/stoneware baking 'dish'.. use a metal pan. Glass takes about 1 1/2 hours to bake instead of the 30 minute time given here."
"0","5","Fantastic!!!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. I used 1 lb of frozen peaches and added 1/2 c of blueberries. It was fabulous. I highly recommend this recipe."
"0","5","Loved it! Rich but delicious!"
"0","5","Amazing!!! By far the best peach cobbler recipe I've ever tried. We love this!!"
"0","5","This is the best peach cobbler I have had well, besides my aunts. I have tried to find a good homemade peach cobbler recipe for years. So delicious!!!!"
"0","4","my boyfriend loved it. The only problem was that he wanted the original peach cobbler he thought the crust was more like cake then a doughy crust. that was the only issue but other then that it was cool"
"0","5","literally my first cobbler ever. directions were on point. ingredients on point. i would lessen the sugar on top but above all this was even better than the one i have ate for years n everybody loved it.......thank you for sharing."
"0","5","what a delicious recipe! but definitely DOUBLE the topping, at the least, as it's really the best part. i'm going to try tripling the topping next time. yes, it's just that good! ;)"
"0","5","Exactly what I was looking for. Really great!"
"0","5","Great recipe I made it twice and my family loved it."
"0","5","Very simple and fun. Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","Very good, as written - worth the work with fresh peaches!"
"0","5","I have a friend who owns a Restaurant and thats a recipes she has used for 35 years,Ever one always rave;s about her Peach Cobbler."
"0","5","It was very good. I didn't measure my spices, I just sprinkled them in the peaches and the cobbler. I added a tsp or two of extra cornstarch, but I probably didn't need to-I only had six peaches to use. I like mine a bit juicier. I gave this five stars, although it didn't come close to my mom's, but nothing can! I like the cake/soft cookie like texture of the cobbler. That's what I think cobbler should be, not crumb. The peach peeling trick in one of the comments was really great!"
"0","5","My boyfriend reminds me every summer to make this exact recipe. (Perhaps, with the help of this cobbler, next year I will be writing as his wife! lol) Recipe as-is is PERFECT. Never ever change a thing!"
"0","5","Delicious!!! Made it from the peaches we picked from our peach tree and it was amazing!! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Wow, Wow! This is award-winning fair cobbler times 2! Made it for a 'girls' night and everyone was in heaven. Already been asked to make it again. Made exactly as directed and wouldn't change anything."
"0","4","the flavor was really good however i left it in a little too long and topping got burnt. i think next time i will try the recipe where the topping starts on the bottom and rises to the top but i will keep the peach filling ingredients the same thanks"
"0","4","This was the first peach cobbler I ever made. It was lots of work b/c of all the peaches i had to peel. Everyone loved it though"
"0","5","This was THE best Peach Cobbler ever!! Ive never made it before and today i made it for all of my friends in our dorm. It was gone in 30 minutes. Im extremely pleased with this recipe. I did although have to make more bread topping to cover it all, it might have just been my container i used to cook it in."
"0","5","My cousin made this... it was so good!!! We decided that next time we needed to double the recipe! We ate it all in one sitting."
"0","5","I've made this twice this week, the second time I made it in a 8x11 pan and multiplied the servings so it served 6 in order to increase the topping amount. This turned out very well, much better than the first time and was devoured by the 14 people at my small group tonight."
"0","5","We love this recipe. Very easy to make and didn't change a thing. Normally we make a double batch!"
"0","5","great recipe not too sweet!!"
"0","5","I have never made peach cobbler before, and it came out amazing! My boyfriend ate almost all of it the first day! Thank you for sharing this!!"
"0","5","This was great. I added about 3 cups of huckleberries and doubled the cobbler (my kids love the cobbler:) It is amazing. I just took it out of the oven and had to test it out, so I put a little serving into a bowl and poured some half n' half over it and mmm-mmm-good:)"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe. Used peaches that I had frozen a couple of months ago and turned out great. Very good when warm and served ala mode. A+"
"0","5","I under cooked mine a tad, but it was still delicious. My daughter and I ate the whole thing. My sister also made it and her daughter loved it as well. We have a peach tree in our yard so this one will be a keeper for August when our peaches are ready."
"0","5","I personally dont like peaches but my husband loves them. I took the suggestion of 6 tsp of cornstarch and it came out perfectly! My husband loved it and ate nearly half. The kids loved it even better than the brownies! Sorry Sara Lee, your cobbler will never be in our house again!"
"0","5","Excellent, simple, delicious recipe! Can substitute just about any fruit in lieu of peaches..."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I made it for a large family get together and EVERYONE loved it! If you like lots of topping make more, but it is perfect as is!"
"0","5","This is a very easy recipe to make. Im alallways trying to find something new to use fresh fruit with in the summer. Cant ever get enough."
"0","5","Good as is!"
"0","5","This cobbler is AMAZING! I didn't have nutmeg so I omitted it, but the cobbler itself is so light and delicious. And even the next day, it isn't soggy or dense. This is the perfect summer dessert, and I can't wait to try it with other fruits."
"0","5","Super Yummy and easy to make!!! I didn't change anything other than cutting my peaches in bigger pieces to really taste the fruit. Only one suggestion for easy clean-up...place the baking dish on a foiled lined cookie sheet. The inside liquid bubbled over a little, so it made clean-up much easier. I will definately make this sweet tasting cobbler again and would reccommend it to anyone!"
"0","5","Great!! My whole family loved it!! I think it will be my new cobbler recipe. I am going to try it with apples, blueberries, whatever!! Awesome."
"0","5","So easy and probably the best cobbler I've ever had. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and it came out perfect. Even a family member who is from Georgia agreed this was the best."
"0","5","This was fantastic. It was easy, delicious, and a great way to get rid of those soft spot ripe peaches. everbody loved it."
"0","5","Everyone in my family who loves peach cobbler thought this was the best they had ever had! Very yummy!"
"0","5","Super good---I used nectarines instead."
"0","5","Yummy! I also added some blackberries. I did follow some reviews and added more cornstarch and less sugar."
"0","5","Our son always loved peach cobbler from childhood on. Made this for him on a recent visit home and he just loved it. Recipes tried previously never seemed to have the right amount of thickening, or they were all peach flavored biscuit. This was just perfect, and the nutmeg just the right touch. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I'd hug you if I could. It made him (and me) very happy. Hope to do this many more times in the future."
"0","5","Made as is...LOVED it! Great with Schwan's vanilla ice cream....mmmmm!"
"0","5","I love to make cobbler and this recipe has it all, I can't wait to change it up with blueberries or blackberries. My whole family really enjoyed it."
"0","5","The best cobbler i have made yet."
"0","5","This by far is a very delicious peach cobbler. I made this for my boyfriend and now he asks for this all the time. I used peaches that are a little underripe. I double the crust so that the cobbler may have a crust on the bottom. I add melted butter to the cinnamon sugar and let the top crust get golden brown then I brush the cinnamon sugar sauce on top and it gets a nice crust after an additional 10 mins. It's not healthy by any means and I love. But I do work it all off in the gym. But this is one delicious cobbler. Also I mix white peaches and yellow peaches for a nice contrast"
"0","5","I made a cherry-peach cobbler. I only had 3 peaches, but a lot of cherries to use. My husband loved it. The only other change I made to this recipe was to add cinnamon to the topping batter. (This was by accident, but it really tasted good). Will definitely make this again with or without the peaches. I would think apples and cranberries would taste just as yummy!!!"
"0","5","We loved this. I used Palasade peaches but thats whats local here in sunny Colorado. This is indeed a very yummy southern cobbler being from Arkansas I know my way around a cobbler or two ;)"
"0","5","This was easy to make. Very good. I loved it. The whole house smelled so good."
"0","5","my husband made this exactly by the recipe. oh my goodness. it was wonderful. so flavorful. probably the best peach cobbler i've ever had. it was gone in no time."
"0","4","It tasted great but it came out too runny. Maybe my peaches were too ripe and juicy!"
"0","5","one word...WOW!!!"
"0","5","I took this to a family get-together and it was the first dessert gone! Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe! I will definately be making this again."
"0","5","We really enjoyed this. I think I put the cinnamon in twice but it was still good. My husband has eaten half the pan himself."
"0","5","We went peach picking yesterday and I came home and found this recipe. I followed it exactly and the cobbler was absolutely delicious! My 3 year old daughter loved it and she normally hates peaches! She even asked for seconds! Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful cobbler recipe! It's a keeper!!!"
"0","5","Outstanding! I added wheat germ sprinkled in with the cinna/sugar for a little extra nutrition. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","This cobbler was terrific. I made it for my wife and daughter and they loved it. The ingredients created a perfect flavor and it was easy to make. Serve it up with some vanilla ice cream and you will be in for a treat."
"0","5","The best cobbler recipe hands down! My family loved it and now i am competition for my aunt who was a little jealous, lol! Thanks a bunch."
"0","5","I haven't personally ate this dish,I made it for my parnets but they say it's delish!I did everything exactly and I went a little bit over the time cooking in the oven so the top is more browned than usual but my dad says he likes it that way!"
"0","5","Awesome! The first time I made this I ended up making it three days in a row - my family LOVED it!"
"0","5","Wonderful wonderful wonderful! The only change i would make next time will be making a little more topping 1 and a half instead of the one amount suggested. I'm really glad that i didn't listen to the other reviewers about making more changes. I think the recipe is perfect beside needing a little more dough. Seriously it's a keeper my husban was happy through the whole day after eating this cobbler he have been asking me for a cobbler for some time. He said it's one of the best cobblers he have ever tried. The whole cobbler was eaten by me and my husband in 1 day. Try it!"
"0","5","Although an experienced cook, I'm not up to bluff on pies, cakes and dessert, however, the Southern Peach Cobbler recipe was a true hit, even if we used California peaches. The lemon juice gives ripe peaches the right tartness, and the cinnamon and brown sugar give it depth. The crust topping with the cinnamon-sugar glaze makes the dish. It had that special 'homey' feeling so I will make it again, and probably memorize the recipe forever - Mary"
"0","5","Wonderful! We love peaches here in Georgia! Made this yesterday and it is simply smashing!! Wish I had purchased some vanilla bean icecream to top it with. Going to make a double batch next time! YUM!"
"0","5","This was REALLY good!"
"0","5","It came out great, nut i would use twice the toppings."
"0","4","This was our first attempt at making peach cobbler. Since peaches are not yet in season, we used frozen peaches. Next time we will double up on the crust."
"0","4","My kids loved it. It was gone in two servings."
"0","3","I didn't care too much for the cobbler topping, was too thick, plus I had to cut down on the sugar a lot -way too much sugar in this recipe!"
"0","5","This was a great recipe -- lots of compliments from my family!"
"0","5","I also doubled the topping as I prefer more topping. Best cobbler I've ever had."
"0","5","This was my first attempt at peach cobbler but I won't be looking for another recipe! This was easy and soooo good."
"0","4","Very good recipe! The breading is very simple, yet the final product is satisfying and just sweet enough. The only thing that I did differently was doubling the breading recipe, because I found that it wasn't quite enough breading for my family. Otherwise, excellent!"
"0","5","This is very tasty. I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 c white flour. I also tossed in about a teaspoon or so of wheat germ and flax seed mill. These additions resulted in a more flavorful and healthy cobbler (in my mind)! I took the advise of others and increased the cornstarch to 4 tsp."
"0","5","This was so easy to make and really delicious. The topping is THE BEST. I did have to half the recipe for the topping and make 1 and 1/2 servings of it because there wasn't enough topping to cover the peaches."
"0","4","This is 5 stars if your in a hurry. I really missed a bottom and top crust that cobblers are known for even though this topping was great, we just prefer crust. I used 2 large cans of drained sliced peaches and that worked out great. The peach recipe itself was 5 stars, using splenda let me eat more."
"0","5","This was one of the best desserts I have ever made."
"0","5","This is the best cobbler I've ever had! The dumplings are buttery and melt in your mouth, and the recipe made the perfect amount to cover 6 large, ripe peaches."
"0","4","Yummy! My first time making a cobbler and it turned out pretty good! Will try again!"
"0","4","I lonely gave it a 4 star because the 'cobbler' part didn't turn out super. That being said, the taste was great. Very flavorful. I only had 6 peach so I added a cup of blueberries! I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream....yumm!"
"0","5","SO delicious!! The dough is perfect on top- everyone thought it was bisqick! Very easy to make and tasted amazing..Would definitely recommend eating warm with Vanilla Ice Cream on top!"
"0","4","topping mushy the next day"
"0","4","This was pretty good. My only suggestion would be to make sure you're going to eat it all the day you make it. It wasn't nearly as good the next day. In fact we threw most of it out. Was a good way to use up my fresh peaches though. Thanks."
"0","5","Very good, I didnt have butter so I used margarine, and it came out great. :)"
"0","5","This was the first recipe I ever made from this site. I'd never made anything like this before, but I've had peach cobbler before. It was great. I did not have a cakey topping like some others complained they did - and I think it was because I completely missed that the water was supposed to be boiling, I put it in at room temperature."
"0","4","A great mix for the peaches! The topping was a bit cakey for me."
"0","5","VERY Good! I doubled the recipe thinking 4 servings were not enough, but I shouldn't have. It says 4 servings, but feeds 8."
"0","4","This was pretty good! It was just a tad too sweet, so next time I think I will reduce the sugar in the peach mixture. I will be making this again!"
"0","5","This was the first time I made a cobbler and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!!! The kids are begging me to make 1 with apples SOON! This was definitely worth 5+ stars!!!!"
"0","5","Didn't last long!"
"0","5","I didn't change a thing and this dessert was wonderful! Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","The best! We absolutely loved it."
"0","5","Amazing! Only had six peaches on hand and the amount was just fine."
"0","5","I used this recipe today! I used Fresh michigan Peaches. I also baked the dish in a 9x9 dish. I doubled the cornstarch, and doubled the topping and halfed the sugar sprinkle. This is the best recipe ever."
"0","5","If you have extra peaches laying around make this. This is by far the best peach cobbler I have ever had. I followed the recipe except I used all brown sugar and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg. I also increased my butter to a whole stick and corn starch to 4 tablespoons. Mine still came out a little runny but I believe that was from the peaches being so juicy. This is a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","I made this recipe yesterday with some fresh peaches and it was exactly what I was looking for in a peach cobbler... just perfect! Love it!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Wow - what a great way to use the summer gold peaches, bursting with flavor! Pre-baking the peaches before adding the dough/sugar topping ensures a perfectly baked crust with no sogginess. Awesome recipe!"
"0","5","So worth it to use fresh peaches! I mixed the peaches and sugar mix the night before for schedule sake and they were great that way as well. Otherwise didn't change a thing and it was fantastic."
"0","5","I have been searching for a recipe that comes close to my Dad's. This is not only as good as his, it is better. This didn't last the night in my house. Served with vanilla ice cream - heaven!! Thanks so much for a great recipe."
"0","5","i am rating the filling as a used my own recipe for the topping and another recipe for the crust, i thought it was excellent i just needed a little more juice next time ill modify accordingly"
"0","5","Mmmm...mmm..mmmm. This recipe was great!"
"0","5","Very delicious!! I made it in an 8x8 square pan. I used whole wheat flour, a little extra corn starch, 8 tbsp butter, and some sorry excuses for peaches with a couple of sorry nectarines too. We had these big peaches but they were bruised and just not any good to eat plain. So I thought that they'd be okay in a cobbler. And this recipe turned out fabulous! The topping is ridiculous and the flavors were so wonderful. My boyfriend and I almost ate the whole thing as soon as it was cool enough! It was simple to make, with ingredients I always have, and it was seriously one of the best cobblers I've ever tasted. I will be making this one again!"
"0","5","Perfect recipe! If your peaches are good and sweet, I suggest using a little less sugar, both for the topping and with the peaches. Devoured by the family in no time."
"0","5","This was my kind of cobbler, DELICIOUS! Thank you for sharing a great recipe, I've never been to the South but this recipe makes me want to try more Southern recipes!"
"0","5","I used 50/50 flour. My whole family loved it."
"0","5","This was my first peach cobbler and it was so easy and everyone loved it! thanks!"
"0","5","I have made recipes from this site for some time but have never felt motivated to write a review until now!!! This was amazing. I made it a couple of hours ago after my neighbor delivered a bucket of homegrown peaches. I have eaten half the pan and am looking forward to making my next batch. Stayed true to the recipe with the exception of increasing the corn starch to 1-2 Tbsp. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","5","this was too great! I took some of the advice of the reviewers and addes two more tbs. of butter, and made .5 more of the topping. mighty excellent! and I didnt used too much sugar when i made the extra topping, i cut back about half of it. I also used nine reg. sized peaches. i have a peach tree and they dont get too big. This was the best cobbler i've ever had!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. I added some blueberries to it, and it turned out awesome!!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly using 4 heaping cups of chunked peaches and threw in 2 cups of fresh picked raspberries-so wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!! Am making it again today for our construction crew for lunch."
"0","5","I love peach cobbler. This was one of the best I've tasted. Easy to make and not terribly heavy at all. Top notch."
"0","4","Wasn't a big fan of the dough for this recipe. It was a little bland and if it weren't for the cinnamon sugar it would have been a big disappointment."
"0","5","Excellent cobbler recipe; I've never eaten better! We love the delicious combination of spices and white & brown sugar. This cobbler works well with half whole wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour also. Thanks for a great way to enjoy cooking with fresh peaches!"
"0","3","This dish wasn't very juicy (as cobblers should be); the topping only covered the fruit where it was initially placed; fairly labor intensive (pealing peaches atleast); not worth the error; a fair rating overall"
"0","4","I give this 4 starts because my hubby abolutely loved it. Personally, I didn;t like the sweetness or the tartness of the peaches, but I'll admit this isn't my style at all. I think it would be geat for entertaining, as long as I don't have to eat it!! btw, THE CRUST WAS AWESOME....BTW the crust is incredible....I could eat the crust all day long!"
"0","5","oh.. my.. gosh.. this was soo good my family couldnt get over how good it was and that I had cooked it. they all say i cook better than my mom now and that's a big reputation."
"0","4","I thought this was a good recipe, however I used some peaches I had pitted earlier and then frozen so it turned out kind of soupy and mushy."
"0","5","Made this tonight...OMG it is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL...a definite KEEPER...I am going to make another one tomorrow for my neighbor....didn't change a thing except used TWO TABLESPOONS of cornstarch and doubled the topping ingredients...also used a 9 x 9 pan...PERFECT. If you like peach cobbler you will LOVE this recipe. THANKS soooo much for sharing."
"0","4","Very good. Used 10 small peaches from our tree."
"0","5","I know this is an awesome recipe because i totally messed up the recipe and it still came out awesome. I accidentally started to make another peach cobbler recipe before i caught my mistake and had to improvise- i ended up cooking the peaches on the stove instead of in the oven and then pouring them into the pan and then following the rest of the directions. I also used an entire cup of sugar in the cooked peaches (the other recipe called for a cup of sugar-)- so mine came out sweet and of course i will next time follow the direction of THIS recipe!!! Otherwise, great recipe and i enjoyed it!!"
"0","5","SUPER, SPECTACULAR, AMAZING, WONDERFUL, SUPERB, INCREDIBLE, DELICIOUS, UNBELIEVABLE!!!"
"0","3","Not bad, but I found a better recipe on another website."
"0","5","Very good. I made this for the 4th of July and then family loved it. I'm from GA and I love peaches so I will add more peaches next time but lets just say, I made a big pan and there were no leftovers! I was sad."
"0","5","This is our new favourite way to use peaches!  For the brown sugar, I use light muscovado, and I also use 2 kinds of cinnamon -- mild Vietnamese 'true' cinnamon which is lovely with fruit, mixed with some super-spicy cinnamon for a bit of a kick. We love how fruity this cobbler is, and that it is not too sweet -- it is perfectly balanced."
"0","5","This was great! I had a couple of almost too ripe peaches I needed to get rid of, so I combined those with a can of peaches. I know, I know...fresh peaches are much better. The cobbler turned out great. My hubby especially loved the crust. Next time I will add a little more cinnamon to the peaches and double the crust recipe. Thanks for an excellent recipe!"
"0","5","MMMM, good! I used fresh (probably slightly over-ripe) peaches which I did NOT peel, just cut into chunks. Since my family likes the topping, I followed the suggestion of others and made 1.5 times the topping amount, put in a 2 qt casserole, only needed cooked 20 minutes and the topping was browned and turned out great! Will make again many times. (makes more than the 4 servings indicated, probably would serve 6-8 good size bowls)"
"0","5","Delicious! No changes needed. Fresh summer peaches are the best. Family loved it on July 4th and office loved it later in the month. Very easy although blanching/peeling the skins does take a few minutes but ohhh so worth it."
"0","5","Did everything as the recipe says... The results?! The bestest peach cobbler ever made!!!"
"0","5","This was so delicious! I used 3 very large peaches (seriously, they were huge) and kept the other amounts the same... baked in an 8 x 8 baking dish and had just enough topping. I love the cobbler part so if I were to use a larger dish it would definitely need to be doubled. SO yummy!!"
"0","5","Wow! This recipe is one of the best desserts I have ever made! I split it in half and used nectarines instead and it turned out perfect! Also, I didn't have any cornstarch so I just used flour instead and it worked just fine. The dough cooked up very light and fluffy with a crispy sugary top. YUM. My husband said that if I made it the next time we had guests over that they would worship me at my feet! I doubt that, but he LOVED it!"
"0","5","This recipe is so yummy and easy to make!!! The crust is very light and fluffy and the peach mixture is perfection. I didn't have a casserole dish so I used an 8x8 pan and it was the perfect size. My husband does not like fruit desserts or cinnamon and he tried this and thought it was very good! This is definitely a recipe I will make over and over again!!!"
"0","5","Certainly a winner. Have made it twice now and always rave reviews. The only thing I did differently was not to add the cinnamon to the sprinkle at the end, as I felt it made the topping less attractive. Used ripe peaches. One of the best cobbler recipies I've tried."
"0","5","Easy and delicious. I had trouble blanching and peeling the peaches but once that was done the baking was easy and my guests loved it! I served it with light Haagen-Daz vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Amazing recipe! I've made this recipe multiple times with raving rewiews! I've also cut the recipe down for 1 serving and cooked in the microwave. I've also tried replacing the sugar for Splenda. This is a VERY VERY good recipe!"
"0","5","I wanted to take this to a family dinner a couple of hours away, so I needed to prep the ingredients and bring everything ready to assemble, and this worked perfectly. I blanched and cut the peaches the night before and put them in a gallon freezer bag with the lemon juice in the fridge. In another bag, I put all the dry ingredients. In a small bag, I put the cinnamon-sugar. The day of, I packed it all in a pyrex travel dish and was ready to go. It was so easy to put together in an unfamiliar kitchen and was widely received. The peaches were a little mushier than if I had cut them the day of, but that didn't deter anyone from filling their bellies with this stuff.  I doubled the recipe but forgot to increase the cooking time. Try not to make that mistake, 'cause some of the dough didn't cook all the way through. And doubling the recipe might just barely fit in a 9x13 pan. I had a lot of bubbling over going on in the oven.  But, Yummy!"
"0","5","The BEST :-) I've ever had and I'm a dessert freak...you could use any fruit for this recipe...thank you!!"
"0","5","I am from Louisiana so I have had LOTS of peach cobbler. This is one of the best. I added a little more Nutmeg (accidentally) but still turned out great. I also used turbinado sugar on top instead of white. YUM"
"0","5","I made it according to the directions, except i used a 9 inch ceramic pie plate, and after cooking the peaches for 10 minutes, I reduced the heat to 375 for the last 30 minutes of cooking. It turned out great :) I would definitly make it again. Also, I was too lazy to peel the peaches, so I left the skin on and it was fine."
"0","5","I have made this several times and it is heavenly. I made this today as my husband's Father's Day gift because that's all he would request!"
"0","5","This was excellent!! My Hubby said it was better than Mom's and friends said better than Grandma:) Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I wonder if would work for pears?"
"0","5","Delicious and simple! We picked fresh peaches at a local farm today and I tried this recipe for the first time. YUM YUM! It was simple, straightforward and absolutely delectable. I used a few of the minor changes that other reviewers noted and it was a stunning success! I can't wait to make it again and serve it for friends and family!"
"0","5","My group of friends here in Alabama get together every Friday from April through August to cook real food (no box mixes, no packaged items allowed). I was in charge of dessert and made Peach Cobbler using this recipe. It turned out fantastic! It was voted 'awesome' by the group. I was requested to make it again this week!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. I've used it several times, and even tried it with 1/2 pears and 1/2 peaches and it turned out delicious! Fresh peaches are best."
"0","4","Nice crispy topping. It has a nice subtle texture difference from a traditional cobbler. I used Splenda for the sugar and it tasted great. I got a lot of compliments on it at the church retreat."
"0","5","This was an excellent dessert! Easy to put together. Maybe a little heavy on the cinnamon on top, so I'll probably cut back on the cinnamon next time."
"0","5","Just made this today !! Loved it !! Great recipe ! I used whole wheat flour, and you couldn't even tell, it tasted great !! I also took a previous writers advice and cut cooking time in 1/2 and used a stick of salted butter, omitting the salt; it came out awesome !! I will defiantly make it again !!"
"0","5","I made this tonight. My fiance and I are working in Co. And our home is in AZ. finding a recipe like this on line was so wonderful. We packed light for our job and don't have the kitchen luxuries like home. This was easy and Dan couldn't quit eatting the cobbler. Thanks so much for this wonderful dessert."
"0","5","This was really easy to put together and came out delicious..."
"0","5","Excellent. This is now the peach cobbler in our home. Great way to use excess fresh peaches"
"0","5","Easy to make and delicious!"
"0","5","yum! Sweet, tasty, lots of peaches (I used canned)."
"0","5","Fantastic!! Crunchy top, tummy bottom. It goes to the top of my recipe list."
"0","5","Wonderful!!! It's a new family favorite."
"0","5","This was a fantastic peach cobbler. My husband challenged me that I couldn't make a peach cobbler like his grandma used to make. I had to prove him wrong and I used this recipe to do it. He loved it! I used the trick that others suggested and boiled the peaches in order to remove the skin with ease. Worked like a charm!"
"0","4","Delicious! Quick and simple! A bit too much salt though. Next time I'll do half the amount of salt."
"0","5","Absolutly amazing"
"0","5","Fantastic! Super easy to prepare, tastes great. Made recipe as-is and it turned out superb."
"0","5","This was really good. Everyone was fighting over the leftovers. I made it exactly as the recipe said."
"0","4","very good, the peaches from my tree are small this year so I used more peaches."
"0","5","Delicious."
"0","5","wow, this was absolutely the best cobbler i have ever tasted!! thanks so much!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I added some blueberries along with the peaches and it was devoured by my family. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","The topping is amazing. Next time I will use a larger baking dish, same amount of peaches, and double the topping."
"0","5","Simply amazing. I made two batches of this, one for a church potluck, and one for my family. On one batch, I forgot to add the boiling water, but it was still delicious anyway- just a little crispy. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  All it needs is a scoop of Blue Bell's Homemade Vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Excellent!!!!!"
"0","5","Fabulous texture, gooey caramel like filling, delicious. A bit sweet for me, I'm going to half the sugar next time."
"0","5","The BEST cobbler!! I make this year round and always get rave reviews. SO yummy!!"
"0","5","This totally satisfied my craving for peach cobbler. Had to use canned peaches since it was fall, but I am looking forward to making it again when peaches are in season. For an extra zing I added crushed gingersnaps right before taking it out of the oven! Yum! Yum! Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","5","Didn't change a thing on the recipe, just made more of it and YUM YUM YUM! Thanks for experimenting and coming up with a great recipe."
"0","4","Very tasty, but I think it would be even better with apples."
"0","5","Excellent flavor...just what a cobbler should be!"
"0","5","this is the best peach cobbler I've ever had thank you!!!!"
"0","5","Outstanding! This is the best!"
"0","5","Loved it. I doubled the topping and found a first for me- not enough fruit! Next time I'll double everything. And quadruble the thickener, as the sauce was just a bit too runny. Rich and Delicious. Thanks!"
"0","5","I love this peach cobbler. My husband said it was the best he ever had. I also doubled the topping, but I layered the extra topping in between the peaches. So there is a crispy and soggy crust. We just love it. Thank you so much!"
"0","5","FANTASTIC!!!"
"0","5","really good. goes amazing with vanilla ice cream. i personally didn't find this too sweet at all but i guess it just depends on the peaches and the sizes of them. the topping was slightly harder than i would have liked but it was still great."
"0","5","This was awesome!! I made it twice within a couple of days because we couldn't get enough. I did change a couple of things. I used 4-5 peaches (depending on the size) and 4 plums. I also doubled the cinnamon topping. It was wonderful."
"0","5","I took the recommendation of others and doubled the topping. I need to bake it longer as a result. My family gobbled this up. It is so easy to make that my daughter is now the chef for this recipe :)"
"0","5","I really wish I could give this recipe more stars. It is very easy to make and turned out beautifully. It cooked perfectly for me in the time requested and had a lot of juice (the way I like it) and just the right amount of sugar and cinnamon. Really delicious and I know I will be making it again really soon."
"0","4","Very good! If using ripe peaches, I would reduce the amount of sugar so that it dosen't come out too sweet! Perfect with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","thanks for the great recipe! I added blueberries and strawberries becaues I didn't have enough peaches. I also added walnuts because I just thought they would really compliment the taste, and they did! everyone loved it."
"0","5","Very good and easy. I usually don't like cobblers because the cake topping is soggy. This topping was beautifully browned and sweet. It was good even cold."
"0","5","This was s-o-o-o good! I also thought to run right out and smack somebody, but then I would have had to share... NO WAY! Don't pass on trying this cobbler recipe out, folks... it's DELICIOUS!  Thanks for recommending it, Breeze... and thanks so much for sharing it, Amy!!!"
"0","5","I was looking for a good peach cobbler or crisp recipe when I came across this one and really glad I did. Made it for company for the first time and it was such a hit my company asked for the recipe so she could make it for a lot of hungry cowboys at a national shoot. They ALL loved it as well as thier wives. The cinnamon really makes it. Hats off to this one!!!"
"0","5","I could never find a peach cobbler recipe that I liked until I made this one. It is sooooo good!!!"
"0","4","Very good - but peaches were a little sour, so next time I will add more sugar to the recipe."
"0","5","YUMMMM!!!! I did not change a thing!"
"0","5","My husband, who only likes chocolate desserts, enjoyed this. So, it must be good."
"0","5","This recipe was awesome! my husband is from the south and loved it. Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","I baked mine in a deep dish stone and took out some of the juice like previous reviewers recommended. However, at 425* mine started to get too brown on top. Although it could have been my oven, I would be sure and start checking it after about 15-20 minutes next time. Taste? Delicious!!"
"0","5","This is the first cobbler I have ever made and it was such a 'huge' hit. I was nervous taking this to a party due to the fact that my whole family are southerners and cobbler is pretty much a 'staple' for dessert. My family and friends were blown away and even wanted the recipe. They all said it was the 'best'. Made it again and took it to my mil's and she was blown away too :o) Thanks so much for the delicious recipe and giving my family a new 'cobbler'."
"0","5","This was a hit! Everyone liked the crunchy topping! I also made it with fresh boysenberries from my friends backyard."
"0","4","Very good recipe! I made no changes except I used 10 peaches instead of 8. Next time around I will probably add at least 5 more peaches. The topping was delicious, just needed more peaches!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. The entire family loved it! I followed the directions exactly with no changes. This recipes is a definate keeper!"
"0","3","Very tasty. The children really enjoyed it. It was sweetened just enough for them."
"0","5","Delicious"
"0","4","Great flavor. Do NOT try to substitute the margarine with oil - it doesn't work."
"0","5","This is delicious and I will make it again, but I'm still trying to find a recipe for the kind of cobbler that has a top more like a very thick pie crust. I'll keep looking. I do recommend this one though -- very good."
"0","5","Incredible! I bake for our church seminary, 40 hungry, picky eaters. I used the topping recipe with frozen cherries and granny smith apples, and the combination was sensational. I multiplied the recipe to feed 40 people, and they all LOVED it! Thank you!!"
"0","5","This got rave reviews from my friends that I gave it, too, even the ones that didn't like peach cobbler before loved it. We have a winner!"
"0","5","Doubled the recipe and it fed 6. Everyone was looking for more! It's a good thing noone was diabetic with this dish."
"0","4","made it for my husband, and he loved it. i only used 6 peaches -- big ones though. we only wished there would have been more crust, so it would have been able to seep down into the filling. next time i'll do that. crust is good, though! any recipe my man likes is a big success!"
"0","5","This peach cobbler was delicious. It was so easy to make, but led people to believe a lot of work went into it. Thank you so much for the recipe. Anyone who didn't think this was a 5 star recipe must have done something wrong."
"0","5","Delicious. I usually like things a little sweeter, and added more sugar, but it was not necessary. Purchased a 2 lb pack of frozen peaches (rinsed thoroughly), and made recipe even simplier. Received kudos from in-laws. Great!"
"0","5","Amazing. Made it 3 times in 2 weeks."
"0","5","easy to make, taste good!!!"
"0","5","WOW! I made this cobbler and took it to work. Everyone went C R A Z Y! It is easy to make and absolutely delicious!"
"0","3","My daughter helped me make this recipe. Tasted good."
"0","5","This peach cobbler is amazing! The best I've ever had. My husband and I enjoy it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Delicious!"
"0","5","My family said this was excellent. I did double the cornstarch since I like a thicker sauce. I served warm with vanilla icecream - Perfect!!!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe it was very easy to put together. The only thing I did different was add more cinnamon to peaches and added more cinnamon sugar to the topping. Will make again!"
"0","4","Very good. My boyfriend really liked it. I like the fact that it was extremely simple to make."
"0","4","Very good! I added some frozen blueberries and some fresh blackberries since I was short on peaches. I had to bake it a little longer than requested as it browned up nicely, but didn't cook as well on the inside. Other than that, very nice! Thanks!"
"0","4","This was an easy and tasty recipe. The only changes I made was reducing the amount of sugar in both the filling and the topping. I omitted the sugar on top as well but sprinkled just a dash of cinnamon on top. I didn't have nutmeg, so I used a cinnamon blend (like a pumpkin pie spice). YUMMY!  If you're not a brown sugar fan, this can easily be made with just the white sugar, try 1/3 cup of white sugar for each part."
"0","5","This was wonderful, I bought some Georigia peaches and didn't want them to go bad, so I started looking for a peach cobbler receipe, I'm so glad I found this one."
"0","5","I doubled this recipe and used 8 fresh small-ish peaches and 1 bag of frozen sliced peaches. Everyone loved it! Definitely want to try this again when peaches are in season."
"0","5","Wow! While this recipe is greatly dependent on outstanding peaches, it is really a great improvement on us 'northerner's' boring biscuit dough cobblers. A young friend used canned peaches and was OK too. Best with fresh though."
