"2719","5","Oh my gosh, this is delicious! I have never had such a delicious apple crisp! I will never search for another recipe! I fixed this for my large, picky family for Thanksgiving. There were no leftovers!:-) Here's what I changed. I made 2 batches. In one, I added 1/4 cup of water rather than 1/2 cup. That was perfect. In the other batch I didn't add any water at all, and it was a little drier than I like. So cut the water in half. Also, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and I added some nutmeg to that mixture. I think that's what made the apples soooo perfect. Lastly, I doubled the crust recipe and put a layer on top and on bottom. Yum!!! I used 6 large Granny Smith's. I won't change a THING about this recipe next time I fix it, which if my family has anything to say about it, will be tomorrow!:-)  11-13-06 I made this again for like the 5th time. It's still good, but I think next time I will try to cut the butter into the crust rather than melt it. My crust is never 'crumbly' like I like on a crisp recipe. Still a 5-star no doubt!!!"
"1949","5","Excellent recipe and a hallmark of a superb chef, but as usual I had to futz with it. Leave out the water, add 1/4 teaspoon of Nutmeg to the apples, double the crust recipe, add 1 1/2 c. chopped pecans to the crust, and it comes out perfect. Remember to use baking apples (preferably granny smiths) for this, as red delicious will be more sweet and therefore need less sugar. Good vanilla ice cream provides all the moisture you would be missing from the water, and a food processor does wonders for taking the work out of slicing the apples. Now just to find a good butter rum sauce recipe :)"
"1345","5","There's a reason why this recipe has nearly 300 reviews - it's THAT GOOD. THIS is now my standard Apple Crisp recipe. I made mine in a 9 x 13 pan and doubled the topping as another reviewer suggested to cover. Perfect. I mixed my apples up with the flour/cinnamon mixture - this draws out the juices and eliminates the need for the extra water. I did not add the water to the apples. My only mistake was I sliced my apples too thin and because they were too ripe some of it came out more like applesauce, but that was my own error. Everyone loved it! I know you are considering other Apple Crisp recipes here but MAKE THIS ONE!"
"777","5","Excellent recipie. It is important to follow the steps and not deviate from them (i.e. don't mix up All the ingredients at once and throw it over the apples as you may be able to get away with in other crisp recipes) The recipie was great. the water factor wasn't a factor for me. it turned out to be a very nice thick juice that accented the dish nicely. A word of caution when using this or any apple crisp recipie. THE TYPE OF APPLES DO MATTER. I made this twice. Once with Red Delicious apples. these apples are not the greatest to use as they are often soft and bland. the recipe was great but the apples lacked. I then used Granny Smith green sour apples. This made All the difference! Do not be afraid to use sour apples. Keep in mind you are using two cups of sugar in this recipie and it will be quite sweet. It simply comes down to the need for a hard and sour or at the very least sharp tasting apple to counter the sugar and even the flavor out. It will taste much better. Do not use soft or bland tasting apples, and do not overcook as the apples will turn mushy if you overcook. If you fear overcooking then cut your apple thicker. If you like the very thin slices of apple then you need to you a very hard, fresh, tart apple. I do not suggest using Red Delicious apples. I also addeed a pinch of nutmeg."
"581","5","Tasted wonderful. I followed the directions exactly this time, but in the future I will make the following changes: cut the amount of water in half, double the topping and add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. You may need to increase the cooking time as mine was not done in 45 minutes. Great recipe though!"
"488","5","One important note: skip the water! I didn't use any at all and it was perfect. I made a smaller version using a square 8x8 pan. I halved the sugar mixture for the apples but used the full measurements for the topping. If you are using the original 9x13 size, make sure you double the topping otherwise it wouldn't be enough. This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted and so easy to make!!"
"283","5","Great Recipe! I did not add the water, since I never add water to fruit crisp recipes. I mixed Granny Smith apples with Jonathan apples and the result was a delicious dessert. For those bakers who said the recipe was too sweet, I am guessing that they used eating apples and not baking apples. Rather than sprinkle the sugar, cinnaman and flour on the apples, I mixed the ingredients together and then stirred in the apples."
"252","5","By far the best apple crisp I have had (or made for that matter...). I only used 5 granny smith apples as I also prefer a higher 'crust-to-apples' ratio and cut back the white sugar to 1/2 cup as others have suggested. This gave the crisp a perfect sweet/tart flavor, and for some reason there never seems to be any leftovers. This one is a definite keeper."
"250","4","Wow... this was really really sweet. The topping is absolutely delicious, but I would cut the sugar, probably only half of the white. Mine was also a touch watery... I made it exactly by the directions. What went wrong?"
"218","5","This recipe is nearly the exact recipe I've been using for years, so I had to add my review to the pile. It is my favorite way to get rid of an apple surplus (I ususally use about 7 good sized apples of mixed variety, minus what I snack on while I make it). The only things I do differently are:   1) I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white for the apple mixture.  2)I add fresh ground nutmeg, vanilla extract, and often raisins.  3)I omit the h20 and  4)I always add a heaping spoonful of gourmet butterscotch caramel ice cream topping to the apple mix-TRUST ME on this one!   In the begining, I had a hard time with my crumble mix being 'crumbly' until I figured out to lightly press it down into the bowl, chill it for at least 30m and then break it up with a fork. Letting the butter in the mix re-harden really makes a BIG difference in the final crumble factor. Also, you must use real butter, margarine won't have the same effect for this recipe. I'll often assemble this earlier in the day and leave it in the frige, then just before dinner, break up the crumble, top and bake while we eat. I always serve with vanilla bean ice cream and have ALWAYS gotten rave reviews with this one."
"212","5","Tried this tonight with Jonathan & Granny Smith apples. I hadn't read the reviews first, but thought that was a lot of water, so I used apple cider instead. I found the amount of sugar OK but think I will try brown sugar in the apple mixture the next time. I used apple pie spice instead of plain cinnamon. Can't wait to try the recipe with cranberries!"
"184","5","I submitted this recipe several years ago, before I was a registerd member. It was included in the first cookbook that All Recipes published, and I was so proud. I like to come back every now and then to read some reviews. I recommend Granny Smith apples; it won't be too sweet or watery. Thanks to all you cooks for your ratings and reviews!"
"150","4","Prepared this exactly as written using Granny Smith and Fuji apples and for our tastes it was just right. No changes necessary. Nicely sweet and cinnamony with a substantial and hearty oat topping. Very good!"
"126","3","First I made with(10)fresh peaches. Was WAY too sweet for our taste. Second time, I used semi- tart apples with only 1/4 of the white sugar. We still COULDN'T eat without a giant glass of milk, or the suggested ice cream. All I could taste was the 'sweet';not much of the fresh fruit flavor or the wonderful cinnamon.The topping was about a 1/4 inch thick in a 9/13 dish. Also, way too sweet for us. I will omit all, but a sprinkling, of the white sugar, add HALF of the brown sugar, next time. If you like it 'BIG TIME' SWEET, this recipe AS IS, is for you! If you like the fresh fruit taste more, omit most of the white sugar and half the brown. Also, you can get away with half the butter if you 'cut' it in evenly with a pastry cutter or a fork. It still comes out crispy and not too dry and is healthier."
"96","5","This is the best apple crisp ever. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and everyone about died because it was so good! Now whenever I have company it is demanded that this be made for dessert! After making the recipe a hundred times, I have altered it slightly and come-up with my perfect variation although the original submission is great as well! In the filling I skip the water but I do add 2 tsp. lemon juice, and 1 tsp. vanilla. The lemon juice adds that little extra oomph to it. Also, to the topping I added 1/4 c. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. The white sugar gives the topping a bit of a caramel flavor as sugar will do when warmed. It also makes the topping VERY crunchy which I think is my favorite part. It's hard to find such a crunch with a crisp. I searched for years for a good apple crisp recipe and I will never look again. This is a life long keeper! Thank you for this gem from me and all my family!"
"62","5","Holy MOLY!! This is what an apple crisp should be. Just enough crunch to contrast with the soft apples. I added freshly-ground nutmeg to the apples and upped the flour to 2 Tb, as many reviewers felt the dish to be too liquidy. I poured 6 Tb cranapple juice over the apples in place of the water, thinking the cranberry in it would provide some subtle counterpoint to the sweetness. I was right. (Updated to add: Tried it with orange juice to replace the water. Excellent!) Used a mix of early macs and Granny Smith. I spritzed the apple mix with some fresh lemon juice. Also added cinnamon and fresh nutmeg liberally to the crisp topping. Spectacular! I made it for my daughter to take to a friend's house tomorrow, and the aroma as it baked darned near drove me crazy! I filched a little from the edges while it was still warm just to taste it and smoothed it back over (shhh!) Thought I'd died and gone to heaven on a cloud!! On the advice of several reviewers, I cut back both white and brown sugars by 1/4 cup, and to my palate, the sweetness quotient was perfect, with just enough to point up the other ingredients. Topping lends a satisfying crunch. What a dynamite recipe this is!"
"56","5","This recipe is excellent the way it is written. I've read other reviews and have noticed that some people have reduced the amount of white sugar and the amount of water. However, I believe that if you use the proper variety of apple and the proper quantity of apples, the measurements given in the recipe for both sugar and water are appropriate. My experience with this recipe was that 3 pounds of apples was the appropriate quantity. I also found that using a tart cooking apple, such as Northern Spy or Granny Smith, worked out well. I did not have a problem with a filling that was too runny or too sweet. Of course, these things are subject to taste, but the variety of apple used does have a significant impact on the amount of sugar required. The variety of apple used also affects the amount of juice produced during baking, therefore impacting the amount of water required up front. For the amounts of sugar and water indicated in this recipe, I believe a tart cooking apple produces the desired results."
"48","5","Awesome! I used Granny Smith apples, half brown and half white sugar, 1/4 c. of water with a little lemon juice and 1 tbsp. of vanilla. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. I added some chopped walnuts and this went great with vanilla ice cream."
"36","4","This is a good basic formula for apple crisp-- except for the water. Apples provide enough natural juice. If you have dry apples, just pour a very small amount (1/8 cup) of water over the apples before adding the topping. Also, the topping needs salt and spice. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt along with some cinnamon and ginger. I put ginger in with the apples, too. My crisp was killer. The filling was not runny at all. The topping was crumbly and buttery. It was excellent."
"28","5","This was great! I ended up making a few modifications (I used extra-thick cut oats and added about half a cup of chopped pecans to the topping. I also added a little fresh lemon juice to the apples, doubled the cinnamon, threw in about 2 tsp vanilla, and omitted the water). . . the results were amazing. I served it with caramel ice cream.   My husband's friend summed it up best. As I was passing out napkins, he said 'This stuff is so good, I'm not going to waste it on a napkin. I'll lick my own face if I need to!'"
"25","5","WOWOWOWIE! This was the best dessert that i have had in years! It was PERFECT just the way it is! I used 4 very large breaburn apples! I'm going to make half a portion next time because we ate TOO much!!"
"25","5","OOHH MMYYY!!! This is sooo heavenly..warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream on top..Doesn't get much better than this. It's apple picking time so I used some fresh picked Empire apples. I used two 8x8 inch glass dishes instead of a 13x9(one for me and one for a friend). I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg(which I will leave out next time-ita a very overpowering spice if you use too much) to sprinkle over the apples and mixed together with a spoon to incorporate it all into the apples . I also gave the apples a few squirts of vanilla and topped with a few dollops of butter(it's already high fat and calorie-why not go for the gold!). Then for the topping I did one and a half batches for more crumbs. I love the topping..I didn't use all brown sugar-I did half brown half white. I also added in some more cinnamon to the crumbs. I softened the butter not melted it for extra big crumbs-just squeeze in your hand and let them fall over the apples in big fat crumbs--YUMMMY!!! No need for the water-the apples were squirting at me when I cored them-so I new they were juicy enough. PERFECTION and I feel a need to go apple picking again so I can make more of this fabulous dessert!"
"23","5","Yum! This is a great recipe with some alterations. I cut the sugar in half (used 1/2 cup white sugar for apple mixture, and 1/2 cup brown sugar for topping), omitted the water (apples already contain a lot of moisture), and added walnuts to the topping. I used Granny Smith apples which were tart, but a scoop of vanilla ice cream complemented this dessert perfectly. And in the morning pour some milk over it and zap it in the micro for a warm delicious breakfast!"
"19","4","Really easy. I'd cut back on the sugar next time, though."
"18","5","Made it TWICE in one week!! I peeled and slices the apples VERY thin and tossed the apples in the cin./sugar (use 1/2 amoutn of sugar required) mixture with a splash of water (NOT 1/2 cup) and added nutmeg like other people suggested. I doubled the crisp mixture and layered 1/2 on bottom of dish, then spead apples and put rest of the crisp mixture on top. It was EXCELLENT!"
"18","5","Wow, was this delicious. It rivals the 'award-winning recipe' served at a local fancy restaurant. I cut the apple mixture in half for a 9' square pan but made the full recipe of topping since I love a thick topping. I used maybe 3/4 of it and it came out wonderful. Will make this again and again."
"17","5","I ADORE this recipe. First off, to address other reviewers' issues with the the crisp being too sweet or too watery, I imagine that none of them made this with ten whole cups of apples. I used 10 apples and didn't come near 10 cups. I imagine 15-20 medium apples would come to that, and then the sugar/water would be fitting. Simply adjust with the amount of apples you use! My point is that the recipe itself is not flawed. And, as others have mentioned, definitely use Granny Smiths. DEFINITELY.  As I made it, I used ten smallish Granny Smiths, cut the sugar in half, omitted the water and instead tossed the sugar mixture with the apples, letting them release their juices. (I would have added water if I'd had more apples.) I doubled the crumble because that's my favorite part, but in hindsight I could have done with the original amount. It's very rich so not too much is needed.   What else... I ended up baking mine for about an hour because my apples weren't too ripe, but thankfully the top didn't burn. Oh, and I was delighted with the crumble using melted butter - I don't see any need to cut it in but I suppose it's up to one's personal preference. I made this with my mother, who has a famous apple pie recipe and doubted this crisp, but she conceded once she tasted it. Enjoy! :)"
"15","5","perfect"
"15","5","First let me thank Diane for a great recipe. A truly wonderful dessert. I paired this with the 'Rum sauce' from AR and got outstanding praises at the potluck I took it to on Sunday. I did read the reviews and did make some changes. I think the recipe as written would still be a 5 star Plus but the changes made just made it even better. Now the changes I made. First I doubled the topping. and put about half on the bottom of one of my lasagna pans and the rest on top. Another change I did was cut up all the apples with the Cuisinart and put them in a bowl with the sugar, flour, cinnamon mixture WITHOUT the water. The apples made more than enough liquid for this crisp. When I looked at the apples in the bowl and compared them to the pan I added more apples. I think I ended up using about 10 medium granny smiths that were peeled. The last change I made was to the ingredients to the topping. I added 1 1/2c of finely chopped pecans and mixed that in before adding the butter. My oven is pretty much dead on the mark as far as temperature goes and baked for the 45 minutes called for. I checked it and added about 5 more minutes to compensate for the extra apples (made it a bit thicker in the lasagna pan) and also wanted to be sure the topping was starting to brown to get the desired 'crunch'! Watch it close or it will burn quickly at that point. I was asked to make this again for Thanksgiving. Oh, the Rum Sauce.... caught a couple of ladies going after JUST the sauce!!"
"15","4","Excellent apple crisp, but just a little too sweet. I used less than the 1 c of white sugar. When I make it again, I will try 1/2 c. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Will definitely make this again. My husband thought it was one of the best apple crisps I've made. I bet peaches would be good, too. Thanks for sharing."
"14","5","Wow..this has to be one of the best recipes I've tried. Loved the crunchy crisp topping. I didn't add the 1/2 cup of water like it says but just added some butter to the apples and it turned out awesome. Don't think the water was neccesary."
"14","4","This was a wonderful recipe. I made it exactly the way the recipe specified. I turned out delicious. My family loved it. Next time I might cut out the white sugar completly or at least cut it in half like suggested from other responses. I would also peel the apples. That was the only hard part. Slicing all those apples. But it was worth it."
"13","5","the best apple crisp ever. My dad is an apple crisp specialist :)And he said it was the most perfect crisp he's eatin. I used 8 Granny smith apple and added 1tbsp lemon juice and one tsp vanilla to the apple's and NO WATER. The apples were perfect consistensy and in a nice sauce. Also I doubled the topping plus added an extra 1/2 butter because I had read some people said it was dry. It was perfect and really easy to make.I made it ahead of time and cooked when we got to our companies house. Amazingly delicious. A+++"
"12","5","I just baked this last night and it is AMAZING! I am 15 years old and have recently developed a passion for baking. I love doing it and everyone who has tried what I make is a fan. :) I love any type of apple dessert, especially apple crisp, so I thought I'd try making it myself. Well, I am so glad I found this recipe. I used 10 rather small Granny Smith apples and that was just enough (luckily I bought a prepackaged bag of about a dozen because I was not sure how much 10 cups would be). I'm reading other reviews after I already made it, and I'm surprised to see how many people made changes to the recipe. I followed it exactly as it says and it turned out perfectly. One thing I must say though: when I cut it, it was very watery on the bottom, but that did not affect the taste. Overall it had the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I would definitely recommend this apple crisp to anyone and I will definitely be making it again! :)"
"12","5","One tip- DO NOT ADD WATER  Amazing recipe- serve warm with ice cream"
"12","5","Definitely a fantastic recipe. I used Granny Smith apples. I did half the sugar for the apple mixture and also used half the water as other reviews suggested. I figured the crumb topping had enough sugar and I was right. It all came together great and we all enjoyed it. This will be my go to for an apple dessert. Thanks!"
"11","3","I made this as directed. It was just ok to me. I felt that it was way too sweet and a bit wet with the added water."
"11","5","I have made this several times and get rave reviews every single time I make it. The recipe is good with apple, but also works very well with blueberries and peaches."
"11","5","This is my 'go-to' apple crisp recipe...easy and delicious!!  It's great as-is, but after making it dozens of times, I've made three tweaks: 1) I prefer the apples chunky, so I cut them into wedges (not slices). To soften them a bit, I put them in a pot over low heat for about 10 minutes, with the water, until they barely start to cook. I toss the sugar, cinnamon and flour right into the pot with the apples.   2) The apple mixture can be pretty sweet, so I usually cut the white sugar in half.  3) I use a lot more cinnamon than the recipe calls for, and add it to both the apples and the topping."
"11","5","We all loved this so much! I didn't add water. Fabuluscious! I'll be making this one over and over until we explode."
"10","5","I also skipped the water. I cooked mine in a dutch oven and it turned out perfect."
"10","4","I wanted to pass along a helpful hint about apple choice when baking. Choose Courtland or Empire for baking because they will hold their shape (one is just larger than the other and will require less work if you're making a large batch). If you like tart apples, then try Granny Smith (I only use these for making coleslaw). Avoid Red Delicious for baking (these are best eaten straight off the tree). Do not use MacIntosh apples for this because they will not hold their shape when baked (they are best for apple sauce). Hope this helps!"
"10","5","EXCELLENT!!! I did reduce the sugar in the apple mixture and made extra topping as suggested by others. This is the perfect apple crisp recipe. I am making it again tonight for my dinner guests. Thanks for a wonderful recipes."
"9","5","I gave it 5 stars because it came out exactly as promised and made exactly as posted. Normally I read reviews first, but am glad I didn't. The type of apples will make a huge difference when making pies and crumbles because they give off different quantities of water when cooked (as many are finding out). The thickness of the apple will also make a difference. The thinner the slices, the musher the final product. If you want something a bit chunkier, cut the apples about 1/4' thick. Otherwise somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4'.  I used granny smith apples, cut between 1/8-1/4' thick and I tossed the apples with the flour/sugar/spice mixture (did add 1/8 tsp cardamom as well) rather than just pouring it over the apples in the pan. Then I poured the 1/2 cup water evenly over all of it before sprinkling the crumble evenly across the top. It baked for exactly 45 minutes. Then I let it sit for 10 minutes to let everything cool and gel just a bit. Perfect! Just the right amount of syrup in the apples and just the right amount of crumble on top...and it is a crumble. Sounds like some people are after more of a streusel topping which tends to be crunchier."
"9","5","Not much to add to an excellent dish with over 2000 reviews. I did add nutmeg and doubled the topping. Will be on the Thanksgiving table. Thank you Diane!"
"9","5","Very good! Here's what I did, as only for my husband and I, I halved the 1st part of the recipe (5 cups of granny smith apples), with 1/4 cup of sugar (I would use even last sugar next time), and 2Tbs water. I also added 1/2tsp nutmegc 1/2 tsp allspice, and a few drops of vanilla extract and a bit of lemon zest and 1/3cup of raisins. I tossed the apple slices and raisins with the mixture and let soak for 20min. I did not half the crust but used 2/3cups of brown sugar instead of 1 cup (I'll use even less sugar next time), and I added 1/2cup of finely chopped walnuts. I cuted in the butter then added additional 2tbs melted butter. Mixed well, then put a layer of crust on top and on bottom. When layering the apple/raisins on the crust, I left the juice behined. Baked perfectly in an 8*8 baking dish. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!"
"9","5","This is a winner! I first cut the white sugar for the apples down to 1/2 cup and added about 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Used 9 cups of granny smith apples, plus 1 cup of mixed berries. Then made 1 1/2 times the recipe for the crumb topping mixture, adding about 1/2 c. crushed walnuts. Buttered baking dish.  Put about 1/3 of crumb topping mixture on bottom of pan before adding apples mixture, then remaining mixture of crumb topping. Baked 45 minutes. Brushed melted butter to top of crumb mixture and baked 15 more minutes. Excellent! Great with vanilla ice cream! Eating some right now for breakfast!"
"9","5","This is a wonderful recipe! I'll be making it again and again! I made double the topping and only about 3/4 of the apples and it turned out wonderful~"
"8","5","I made this once, as is, but it needed a little tweaking for my family. Sp for Thanksgiving, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and I doubled the crust ingredients, reduced the water to ¼ cup, cut the butter in rather than melt it, tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, added a touch of nutmeg, 3+ teaspoons of cinnamon (even added some to the top crust). I lost count of how many apples I used - small/medium apples, in three varieties because it’s what I had on hand. The entire pan was gone in under 10 minutes! I’ve been told to make at least 3 for Thanksgiving!"
"8","5","I've been making this one for years and it is so easy and tasty. I change nothing and people love it EVERY.SINGLE.TIME! I use sweet apples, I use tart, it makes no difference. It really is just tasty. I find 5 to 6 apples is what is needed for 10 cups."
"8","5","I cut the recipe in half for a test drive and baked in an 8 x 8 pan. It was the perfect size for our small family. To the apple mixture, I added a little nutmeg and a pinch of salt. I also increased the flour to make a nice thick sauce and eliminated the water. The salt will pull the natural juices out of the apples. The end result was perfect, I will be making this many more times"
"8","5","Great recipe! I used 6 granny smith apples, which were just perfect for the amount of topping. I also made the following changes after reading other reviews... 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. water, then, half way through baking I melted 3 tbsp. of butter and drizzled it over the crumb to make sure it came out nice and crisp! Don't pass this one over, it's a goodie!"
"8","5","This was really good and so easy to make, I made it while I wasnt sure I even had the time to make it, didnt take long to prepare at all, this was my first time ever making an apple crisp, came out really good, thank you for this recipe, I will for sure make again..im thinking about making it for Thanksgiving here in a few weeks, my family will enjoy, im sure!"
"8","5","Great recipe. WARNING: To those that don't like too much sweet! DON'T double the topping part as some recommend. Ick. Too overpowering for the apples. I followed recipe exactly except I omitted the water and it was plenty juicy and the topping was perfect (not to little, not too much)"
"8","5","Awesome recipe. Used 6 medium granny smiths, tossed them with the sugar/flour mixture before laying them in the baking dish. Doubled the topping, but ended up only using about 1 1/2 x the original amount.  Used the full 1/2 cup water, would have been too dry without."
"8","5","This is a great base recipe for apple crisp. I made a bunch of alterations to the original recipe. I felt that there was way too much sugar; therefore I only used a 1/3 of a cup of white and 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar. I only added a few tablespoons of water (instead of a 1/2 cup) and mixed the apples well with the white sugar mixture. The dessert was fabulous. Definitely a keeper!"
"8","5","One thing that is missing in this recipe is VANIILA ICE CREAM!!!! What a great, yummy, easy dessert!!!I will make this again and again. PS I agree to double the topping since that is the best part:)ENJOY"
"8","5","This is absolutely WONDERFUL! I made it exactly according to the directions. This the only apple crisp recipie I will use from now on."
"8","5","This was a really excellent apple crisp recipe and I think I'm going to adopt this one as my regular crisp recipe. I would personally only use about 4 or 5 apples for a 9 x 13 because I like the 'crisp' part the best. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper."
"7","5","That's gooooooood ... I made few changes to boost the flavor. I used 5 apples, 1 plum peeled & cut to quarters. I used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 sugar cane molasses (I didn't have brown sugar) I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. substituted water for orange juice. added orange zest to the filling. for the crisp, i used 2/3s oat to 1/3 flour & I used cubes of butter (no melting). I served with lite vanilla ice cream & God ... that was goooood!"
"7","5","Yummy yummy! I, like others suggested, doubled the topping ~ 1/2 on bottom 1/2 on top, no water, more cinnamon, added nutmeg. I also topped with homemade caramel before baking. DIVINE!!!!!"
"7","5","This is very good, although I like the caramel apple crisp better, this is one I will also use. Thanks."
"7","1","I thought the texture in this was excellent! Family said it was 'scarry good'. Added a little nutmeg as one of the other viewers suggested just because I like spice but it doesn't really need it. 2nd time I made it, I used Splenda reg. sugar and brown sugar and fat free butter. Still was great. This is a keeper."
"7","4","I made this yesterday and it was soooo yummy. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought the water would have made it too runny. I only made a few changes. I didn't use the water, baking soda or baking powder (was out of baking soda). I also added a 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar mixture (love nutmeg) and a dash of cinnamon to the crumb mixture. I just had some leftovers a few minutes ago and the crumb topping is still nice and crunchy. My whole family really loved this and I will definitely be making this again and again."
"7","5","This recipe was excellent! I read the reviews before making it so I did make some changes...I did double the topping recipe and added half on the bottom. Then I took the sugar, cinnamon and flour mix and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and put that in a bag with the apples and coated them with it before I put them in the pan. I then halved the water to 1/4 cup and topped it with the rest of the topping! It turned out perfect will definitely make again!"
"7","1","I do not understand the positive ratings this recipe received! This was TERRIBLE! One previous reviewer called it 'Apple Mush'. I agree completely. Also, the topping was too sweet, and there was not enough oatmeal. I'll stick with my own recipe. I had high hopes for this -- sorry."
"7","5","Fantastic apple crisp recipe. So easy and everyone loves it!"
"7","5","I have been using this recipe for over a year now. I do, as someone adviced earlier, double the ingredients for the crumble mixture and I eliminate the water. My family asks for this to be made and I have a husband who generally doesn't like desserts.  The reason for doing this review is that yesterday I substituted PEACHES for the apples. I didn't put the full amount of cinnamon in (used less than 1/2 teaspoon). My husband said to try nutmeg instead of cinnamon next time, so I will give that a try. Once again the whole family loved it."
"7","5","This is a very delicious apple dish. I used a combination of Jona Gold and Delicious apples and included the water called for in the recipe. This added a little more juice to the apples to go with the crunchy topping. My family was quite impressed and this will be the only apple crisp made in my kitchen!"
"7","5","This was my first time making apple crisp. I omitted the water but follwed the rest and it was WONDERFUL!!!"
"7","5","Yummy. I had only about half the apples on hand, and it still tasted wonderful."
"7","4","This was easy to make, and easy to improvise with. I added pecans to the topping, and cranberries to the fruit, and it was awesome! Everyone loved it."
"7","5","My daughter made this recipe for the first time, she loved it, the ease of preparation,the taste afterward, the crisp texture of the crunch on top, very good, will try again. I do not agree that there is too much oatmeal."
"6","5","The best apple crisp ever. Used Splenda instead of white sugar."
"6","4","Delicious! But many thanks to the other reviewers, I read most of them in detail and based on the comments, reduced the sugar in the apple mixture to 1/2 cup, increased the flour to 1/3 cup, and reduced the water to 1/4 cup. I also allowed the apple mixture to sit in the fridge overnight to allow the fruit's natural juices to ooze and combine with the flour-cinnamon mix... Lovely! For the topping, I used 1 cup unpacked instead of packed brown sugar and I might try to reduce this to 3/4 cup the next time. Also, as other reviewers suggested, I cut in the butter to the topping instead of melting it and mixing it -- seemed to give me a better crumb topping. Oh and I also added a handful of chopped pecans to both the apple filling and the topping for that extra crunch. Will definitely make this one again, thanks!"
"6","3","I would attempt this recipe again. I think most of the issues I have are from my own mistakes. my mix of fuji and washington apples probably kept it from being as appley as it could have been. I personally think it needed way more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg, cloves, etc. you could get away with a lot less sugar in the apple mixture and add some more spices to the crumble part. It didn't make the house smell all wonderful either... im still gonna eat it. I cant stand to waste all those beautiful apples!!!"
"6","5","I used ten medium granny smith apples and following another reviewer's recommendations I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and cut cold butter into the topping rather than melt it. The result was delicious, but next time I will use 9 apples and follow the recipe with regard to the water and the butter. The topping turned out a little too dry for me. I will definitely make this recipe again, but will make it exactly as written."
"6","5","This recipe is exceptional! The only changes I made? I cut the amount of water in half that I put over the apples. Also, I mixed the apples in the mixture in a bowl (the sugar, Tbsp flour, cinnamon) to coat them better before sprinkling the water on AND I added maybe a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to that. The topping though, I didn't change one bit and it is P.E.R.F.E.C.T!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you to whomever contributed this wonderful recipe. I am quite sure I will be the one who is asked to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Not kidding people...it really IS that good:) Happy Holidays! -Amanda"
"6","4","This recipe has the potential to be outstanding. It is missing a few things- more spices! Ground cloves are a great addition to this recipe as well as a little bit of nutmeg to bring out the cinnamon. Also, water is not flavorful enough to toss the apples with, some apple cider would be the perfect touch."
"6","4","great recipe -- the type of apple should be Granny Smith or anouther Baking apple. -- all purpose of pretty vague. Softer apples will fall apart & don't need as much bake time or sugar. I made it with 4 granny smith & 2 fiji & it was awesome. whole oats work great too. :)"
"6","5","I made this for the first time and it turned out fantastic! I took the advice of other reviews and only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of water. I did not double on the toppings, but I am thinking I will next time. My family ate half of the batch in the first hour it was out of the oven. Definitely a fan favorite and I plan to use it again!"
"6","5","This is delicious! I doubled the crisp part and put under and over the apples and I soaked the apples in the sugar, flour and cinnamon as suggested. Delicious! I added a little nutmeg to the apple mixture. I didn't use baking apples so I didn't add the water but the mixture came out really juicy. This was reallly good!"
"6","5","This is awesome! I took the advice of others and only used 1/4 cup water and it turned out perfectly. Also doubled the topping, putting the apples between the two layers. It completely filled up my 9 x 13 Pampered Chef baking dish! I tossed the apples in the sugar and cinnamon mixture vs. pouring on top and the apples came out perfectly. Because I doubled the topping I baked it for close to an hour and it was perfectly done. Granny Smith apples worked well for me. And I didn't notice until just now that the recipe doesn't specify if the apples are to be peeled--I guess I just assumed they were to be peeled, so that's what I did. Served with vanilla ice cream for a birthday lunch today (my sister requested this vs. a birthday cake) and everyone loved it."
"6","5","This has to be the absolute best apple crisp I have ever eaten! We halved the recipe because 12 servings was going to be way too much for our family of four. A few tips from other readers to make this crisp superb: 1.Toss sliced apples with the sugar before putting in the dish. 2.Add 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the apple-sugar mixture. 3.Omit 1/2 cup of flour in the topping mixture. 4.Double the topping mixture so that there is enough to press in the bottom of the dish as well to sprinkle on top. Extra good with on top and bottom! 5.Use cold butter cut into pieces in the topping mixture. Not melted as   recipe states. 6.10 cups of apples= 7 medium apples. That should do it. Bake and enjoy!"
"6","5","Best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried! Just the right amount of topping for the amount of apples. I didn't change anything in the recipe and everyone who has tasted it loves it! Thanks!"
"6","4","This was a very good recipe and probably would taste wonderful with vanilla ice cream (unfortunatly I'm all out) The only reason why I did'nt give this recipe a 5 star is I found it a little too sweet (but the flavour was very good). It was even too sweet for my 8 year old. She would'nt eat it. Everyone else did although they all said the same thing. I will definitely try this again using less sugar and I would also use a more tart apple like granny smith."
"6","5","The first time I tried this, I cut the sugar in half as some reviewers suggested, and we were not impressed with the result. I decided to give it one more try as originally posted, and it is FABULOUS! Don't change a thing - it makes a wonderful apple crisp and the 'sauce' thickens as it cools. I'd give this one 10 stars if I could. SUPER RECIPE! Thanks so much! :o)"
"6","5","delicious! a great oatmeal topping--its kind of crunchy like granola, but not too crunchy. i lightened this recipe by subtituting splenda for the sugar, i used maybe a little less than half of the brown sugar called for in the recipe, and i used light butter in replacement which has 1/2 the calories and much less fat. i also used old fashioned rolled oats, instead of instant. it turned out perfect. a good breakfast as well because of it being healthier. adding fat free coolwhip to top it off makes it even better!"
"6","5","This apple crisp recipe is a great find. I agree that the water should be decreased to about 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup (depending on your personal pref.) Other than that it's perfect, and so easy to make."
"6","5","The crisp was great!What worked out best for my family was to forget the water, cut the white sugar to 2/3 cup, add a little nutmeg, and as far as apples use 2/3 Golden Del. and 1/3 tart apples (Mac's or Courtlands ). Also double the crust."
"6","5","Great recipe! As good as my grandfather's recipe, and his is an all-time favourite! The only modifications I made were to use 1/3 a cup of sugar in the apple mixture and I increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons. I thought the topping would be sweet enough, so that's why I cut back on the sugar with the apples. This is a keeper. Thanks!"
"6","5","This was just great, and so easy. I made it the first time as directed, and it was watery, so I made it a second time without the water, and it was perfect. I also doubled the topping. YUM!"
"6","5","everyone absolutely LOVED this apple crisp. i used a lot of different kinds of apples and it came out perfectly! thanks for sharing."
"6","5","Excellent! Followed other suggestions & used about 8 cups apples (Granny Smith) and doubled the topping. Perfect! Will make again & again. I used fat free frozen vanilla yogurt instead of ice cream so I wouldn't feel quite so guilty :)"
"6","5","If there was a 10 you would have gotten that insted!! This is the best apple crisp recipie i have ever used(Don't tell grandma though) What i did a bit different was a scaled the recipie to serve 18 then i divided the appels into three disosable metal pans and and froze two for later. Wonderfull texture, flavor and easy to make!!"
"6","4","Excellent Recipe!!! Whole family loved it! I was out of cinnamon, oops. One recommendation though I cheated and doubled the crisp topping because I thought that it was not enough to cover such a big dish. Still not diappointed.  Thanks again. Lu"
"6","5","Good recipe. I found it to be a nice texture; not so much flour that it was more like apple betty or so much oatmeal and butter that the apples were over powered. The recipe halved and served with ice cream was prefect for 4 adults and 2 small children."
"6","5","Very easy to prepare and delicious. My husband loved it."
"6","5","This is so good and easy to make. I made it for a gathering of women and they loved it & wanted the recipe. I served it with vanilla ice cream and warm caramel drizzled over the top. I know I'll be making this again, and again. Very tasty, and highly recommended."
"6","5","Very good hot with ice cream!"
"6","5","We loved this recipe and so easy to make too."
"6","5","this was a great dessert"
"5","5","Great! I usually use the joy of cooking's recipe for apple crisp, and for some reason it never occurred to me to search the web for a good recipe...  Well, I'm happy to report that this one is much better! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, maybe a little less sugar on the apples.  When it comes to the 'extra water' debate, I think that it really depends on the apples you are using. If they are juicy, they will bubble up and be delicious, but if they are dry, it is not going to work. I usually peek into the oven about halfway through the cooking time, and if the apples look like there's not enough juice, then adding a little water works magic. Some people I know use orange juice. It really doesn't matter, but you want a little sauce to make the dish really work.   So for me, I don't add any water, and then check on it halfway through and decide if it could use some. I am so glad I have a new apple crisp recipe!"
"5","5","In one word, addictive. I do think it could use less sugar, at least 1/2 cup, in with the apples. I made it with 6 Granny Smith apples because I like to have more crisp than apples, but that was too few. Next time I will try 8 or 9 apples. Oh, and I used 1/4 cup water and it was about perfect, just a tiny bit watery. Would be interested in sprinkling some nutmeg on top of the apples too as other reviewers suggested. But all in all, it is a great recipe as is without any changes like nutmeg. Thank you!"
"5","5","I have made this recipe twice. The first time I made it exactly as written. It was delicious, however, it was pretty sweet and a bit too runny for my taste. When I made the recipe the second time I added a 1/2 Tbsp of flour and I grated the rind of a small lemon and added the juice from the lemon. The sweetness of the crisp was cut and it was runny .... perfect I think, especially with a scoop of quality vanilla ice cream when serving."
"5","5","I followed the instructions of many-many reviews by doubling the crumble and putting half on the bottom, as well as halving the mount of liquid added. It was SO tasty, but a tad dry with all that crust. Next time(and there WILL be a next time) I'll again do the double crumble, but do the full amount of water called for. :-)"
"5","4","Made this with cortland apples and followed the recipe exactly and it came out fantastic. Will make this one again for sure."
"5","5","Turned out fantastic! Served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Thanks!"
"5","5","Delicious! I did cut the sugar down to about half the amount stated & it was perfect.....would've been too sweet if I had put in the full amount. Thank you!"
"5","4","Absolutely yummy! However, I didn't give it 5 stars because it was entirely too sweet. Next time I will add 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup. I also replaced the 1/4 cup of water with apple juice. Will definitely make this again!"
"5","3","flavor was pretty good but mine turned out really liquidy. Could be the type of apple I use. Ginger Golds - it said they were good for baking."
"5","5","This apple crisp is one of the best things I have ever cooked! Very tasty with caramel and whipped topping. I mixed up extra topping because it is my favorite part, and it was perfect. I will use this recipe forever!"
"5","4","This is excellent. I made a half of recipe with a few changes. First I didn't peel the apples, I added some fresh ginger to the apple mixture, I used whole wheat flour and I added a 1/2 cup of pecan pieces. Adding the pecans was the real winner. Next time I'll try less flour more oats and less brown sugar but it's a great recipe as it. I like to eat this with no fat plain yogurt added to the top. thanks"
"5","5","I made this with half the water and 2x the crumble (1/2 on top and bottom) I wish I hadn't cut down on the water by half because it was a little dry, but im sure that was because i doubled the crust. It was still very good! I used Fuji apples because that's all i had, next time I make it I will use granny smith and make sure to keep the water as stated! Yummo!"
"5","5","I made it exactly according to the recipe. If I were to make it again, I'd say that I would double the topping. However, this is purely from an indulgent perspective. There is absolutely enough topping to cover the apples and then some, just not enough topping to satisfy the cook who always doubles the amount of topping, cheese, butter, ect, in a recipe to make it absolutely stupendous. It was awesome just the way it was. I served it for Christmas dessert with some vanilla ice cream, and there was nothing left!"
"5","5","This was fabulous and made my husband's night. I just made two minor changes; there are only two of us so I cut the apple part of the recipe in half, but kept the topping amount the same and was glad I did. I also used cold butter cut into little chunks and cut it into the flour/oat mixture. Oh, and added a couple grates of fresh nutmeg to the apples. Next time I will melt the butter per the original recipe and see if there is a difference in the texture of the crust."
"5","5","This recipe was quick and easy and tasted wonderful! I did not use the water and cut the white sugar in half. I did not double the topping but someone mentioned doing so and putting one layer on bottom and one on top. If you like lots of the crisp that would work. I would also cut the slices in thirds next time. Definitely a 'make again' recipe!"
"5","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and had amazing results. It turned out so unbelievably yummy as i served it when it had just come out of the oven. Will definitely make this again!"
"5","5","I've made many an apple crisp in my day, and this is perfection! Didn't tweak a thing. Thank you for sharing, Diane."
"5","5","If I could give this 10 stars I would!! I have been meaning to review this for a long time now, I have made this several times, and is a must the first day of autumn in my household. We all love this so much, it's the best apple crisp I have ever had. I added some chopped walnuts to the crumb topping, and that adds nice flavor and crunch. I serve this with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream on top. Thank you so much for sharing this. *UPDATE 9/25/09* If you don't want much 'sauce', I highly recommend using 1/4 cup of water instead of a 1/2 cup, but I prefer using the 1/2 cup that's called for, you could always add another Tablespoon of flour. I use 1/2 Granny Smith apples and 1/2 Red Delicious for this crisp. Also, a drizzle of caramel sauce is excellent on this along with vanilla ice cream. Other than the water amount, this recipe doesn't need tweaking. Don't mess with perfection :)"
"5","5","Delicious! I sprinkled some vanilla in there too as well as doubling the crust mixture. I did add the water and it was perfect."
"5","1","This was a WATERY, embarassing disaster. I usually make Apple Oatmeal Crisp from this site (so awesome). I wanted to try a recipe that served more for company at Thanksgiving. Sorry - I'll keep the Apple Oatmeal Crisp recipe."
"5","5","Every guest that tried some loved it. Mine turned out a bit watery but I used apples that had been frozen, thawed, and not drained enough. The flavor was wonderful! I always add a dash of cinnamon to the crisp topping part; other than that the recipe was made as stated. Mmm! UPDATE: Made this again with fresh apples, and it still came out a bit watery. Next time I will cut the water in half; but honestly, it's a nice syrupy consistency that is great over ice cream! This time I added 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon allspice to the topping."
"5","4","Pretty good - there is absolutely no need for water in this recipe. Be sure to use cooking apples - a mix of 2 or 3 varieties is great."
"5","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe I've ever tried!! I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and it was perfect. So yummy!!"
"5","5","Made as is but with only 5 apples (thats all I had), they were on the big side though. It turned out awesome! My boys were nuts over it. Making it again tomorrow."
"5","5","I wish I could give it ten stars or more...this recipe was awesome!! I will never use a different recipe again. I used half Red Gala Apple and half Granny Smith and doubled the topping and I did not use any water. It was perfect, still very moist with the perfect amount of sweetness. I will never use another apple crisp recipe again!!"
"5","5","For a long time, I've been trying different recipes to find the best apple crisp, and hadn't found it until now I think. This may be the recipe that has given me the best compliments for an apple crisp in a looong time! I halved the recipe, and baked in an 8X8 pyrex pan, and used about 5 granny smith apples, followed everything else exactly (but divided by 2). It came out delicious, and perfectly caramelized, which is often hard to get, and that is what I've been looking for in all the recipes. Finally, my mom agrees that it's a really good crisp! I would strongly recommend granny smith apples, they are perfect for this recipe, and trust me, NOT any kind of apples would do! You really need an apple that is firm, that keeps its shape and that has a good flavor for baking. Thanks for sharing your recipe, it was great!"
"5","5","This was really yummy! Who doesn't love a warm apple crisp with vanilla ice cream? I doubled the crumble mixture, but didn't quite use all of it, but it was still worth it! The only change I will make is to use less sugar next time because it was a little too sweet than I would normally like it, but still a winner."
"5","5","used the pumpkin spice instead of cinnimon and nutmeg (it has both). tossed the apples in lemon juice. added peccans. cut up the butter instead of melting it....and only used 1/4 cup of water.....took the advice of others and doubled the crisp, putting a layer on the top and bottom. IT WAS PERFECT! can't wait to use it onThanksgiving."
"5","4","I have made this twice now. The first time I used Gala apples, they added great flavor, but were pretty mushy. I also added chopped walnuts to the crust-that was excellent! The second time I used Jonagold apples and they stayed nice and crisp, but didn't have near the flavor. That time I put chopped almonds in the crust (also very good!) All in all the actual recipe is good, but not much different than any other recipe I have tried, it really depends on the quality of apple you use."
"5","5","Amazing!! I omitted the water since apples are in season and don't need any additional moisture. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This might be the best homemade apple crisp I've ever tried!"
"5","5","This was a great recipe. I went apple picking with my family and wanted a recipe to help me use up some of them. This recipe was easy to follow and didn't take too long to prepare. My family and I loved it. It was even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top."
"5","5","This was a lovley and easy recipe. I have made it twice once adding the water and finding it soggy on the bottom and too 'wet'. The 2nd time I did not add the water and let the natural juices from the apples take over. It didn't last long and with it warmed up, a little ice cream and whip cream mmmm yummy"
"5","3","I'm giving this a 3 star rating, only because the type of apples used have a big impact on the outcome. I used gala apples, but still was not impressed with the results. As other reviewers noted, it definitely does NOT need water. I also felt that the amount of sugar called for, to be mixed in with the apples made it a little too sweet. However, my biggest concern was that it lacked that 'WOW' factor. If I were to make it again, I'd add a pinch of salt to the apples, decrease the quantity of white sugar, and try adding more spices (cinnamon and nutmeg; possibly allspice), and grated orange or lemon zest. Or perhaps some dried cranberries. I'd leave the topping exactly as called for. That part was good, and the quantity was perfect; no need to double it, as some reviewers suggested."
"5","5","This was very good. My family loved it! My husband said it was better than his Mom's apple pie. I would not add water next time. It was too soupy. I will also spice it up next time. I used home grown apples. It was delish!!"
"5","5","My friends fight each other to get to the apple crisp. I double the crumb mixture."
"5","5","YUM YUM YUM!!! I quadrupled this recipe and made 4 apple crisps for a Thanksgiving party at my office. I used Granny Smith apples. I didn't measure the apples, I just packed a whole bunch of them in the pans and tossed them with just the cinnamon and sugar, because I've found that the flour and water sometimes makes it gummy. I also just cut in the butter, I didn't melt it. The crisps turned out so good, I got rave reviews at work!"
"5","4","Great, simple recipe (but of course I had to make some adjustments). I had a lot of red delicious on hand, so I cut the sugar in half and used 1/4 c water like another reviewer suggested. Also, I made more topping -- I increased everything by 1.5 -- and the only thing I will change for next time was to add a teeny bit more salt. Maybe 1/2 tsp. I used real butter and it was well received!"
"5","5","the best! made a few slight changes. i used heavy cream instead of water,'will seem runny, but let the crisp soak up the heavy cream' couple squirts of lemon, and lime juice. to help apples from turnning brown, and a little more tartness. and only bake mine for 40 minutes.'like my crisp a little under done'"
"5","4","I followed the advice of others and left out the water and added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg. I also baked it an extra 15 minutes because of those who said 45 minutes wasn't long enough - but I wish I hadn't, the apples turned out sort of mushy. I had intended on adding some almonds to the topping but forgot, so I toasted them seperatly and sprinkled them over the topping after removing it from the oven, and this added a nice flavor. All in all, this recipe was pretty good, but I still think my mom's is better!"
"5","4","Nice crunchy crust - I doubled it, but it was too sweet and could not taste the apples. Also, I decreased sugar on apples and did add the water - big mistake - got applesauce. Next time, I will leave out the water (water + sugar = syrup; if you decrease the sugar, leave out the water or you will get applesauce like me!)"
"5","5","Unbelievably easy and soooooo delicious! I wouldn't change a thing, other than making extra topping. I used one and a half times the topping recipe and it was just perfect. I wasn't sure what kind of apples to use, so I bought a bag of red delicious and they were just perfect in both flavor and texture (it took about 9-10 apples). As I sliced the apples, I sprinkled them with a tiny bit of lemon juice to keep them from turning brown. My family thanks you for this WONDERFUL recipe! :-)"
"5","5","SOOO good...with a minor change. I used tart granny smith apples, and 1 C. sugar was still much too sweet. Cutting down to about 1/2 C. made the recipe perfect. I also doubled the topping (it is definitely the best part)! MUST serve with vanilla ice cream!"
"5","5","Like others, this was very good. I added some cinnamon to the crumb mixture and doubled it. I used 6 large granny smith apples and it filled up the entire pan. Thanks"
"5","5","This is a really good crisp recipe. Next time I will add a little less water. It was a little runny in the bottom of the pan. I threw in a handful of orange flavored 'cranraisins' for something different, would be great with a fall or Thanksgiving meal."
"5","5","Scrumptious!!!....My son is very picky and loved it...I tossed the apples in a tablespoon of lemmon juice and added a pinch of nutmeg to the white sugar mixture."
"5","5","One word - EXCELLENT!!"
"5","5","Outstanding apple crisp, though a bit too sweet for us. Next time I will cut sugar 3/4c in the apples and 3/4c in the topping. I also increased flour to 1 1/2T over the apples. Yummy! Thanks, Diane."
"5","5","I gave this recipe to my 14 year old daughter to make for our family and it was a hit! She used Granny Smith apples and it was perfectly tart and sweet. I will add walnuts or almonds to the topping next time, but otherwise, it's a great recipe."
"5","5","I used a smaller pan for the thicker results and this was just the Best crisp! Plenty of apples, and plenty of thick crunchy crust as well! My husband says this is a keeper."
"5","2","Not very good for someone who doesn't particularly care for oatmeal - I thought the taste would be much more subtle than it was. I felt like i was eating apple oatmeal crisp."
"4","5","I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out fantastic. I do use a Tablespoon of cinnamon instead of a teaspoon. And I recommend using granny smith apples. I have tried several different types of apples and the grannies always come out the best.  This will continue to be a staple in my kitchen."
"4","5","I used Honey Crisp apples, they have a great flavor (sweet with a slight tartness) and so I think I should have reduced the white sugar- mine turned out quite sweet. I followed the top review that said to reduce the water to 1/4 cup, but found there was quite a bit of liquid on the bottom. I am not sure I'll add water the next time I make it. It is delicious though, and makes the house smell like fall. Definitely worth making!"
"4","1","It's far too sweet!   The crumble part of the recipe is really good, and it makes a lot"
"4","3","I thought this was ok I've just had better topping store bought of course it was weird tasting I'm not sure if the quick oats need to be a certain brand or what but it was edible but nothing I'd run back to the kitchen and try to remake."
"4","5","I used 1 1/2 times the crust. My crust turned out perfect. I cut the cubes of butter in small pieces then used a pastry cutter (?) to cut the butter into the mixture. At first, it was too fine so I just stuck the crust bowl over the vent of the oven to let the butter melt a bit. I used half about the white sugar. 7 Granny Smith apples cut about 1/2 inch thick. I added an extra 2 tsps of cinnamon, and a touch of nutmeg. Mixed sugar mixture into the apples, instead of pouring on top. Only added 1/4 cup water."
"4","4","This recipe is good but if you read the reviews you'll see that some omit the water completely and others reduce it and other tell you it's too sweet. I cut the water in half and it was still a soupy mess and still very sweet. That means either leave out the water completely or just add a tiny bit, say 1/10th the amount. Of course this will make the recipe that much sweeter, so that's something to take into account as well. The taste is amazing, just needs to have the right texture and you won't get that with the recipe as is."
"4","5","Great recipe with my substitutions. 1. Sub Apple Cider Vinegar for water and only use 1/4 cup instead of water. 2. Add a pinch of nutmeg to sugar mix. 3.Coat the apple slices in the sugar mixture instead of just piling on top. 4. Toast the oats slightly before adding to the topping to bring out more flavor."
"4","5","I am not a baker. I suck at it. I am impatient and don't have a sweet tooth. However, I had apples to use up....hence this recipe. Loved it. More importantly, my guests loved it. It was all gone - one person had 3 servings. Thanks so much for making me trick my guests into thinking I was a baker! :) I did follow some other reviews and lessened the water and doubled the topping. Perfect."
"4","4","I LOVED this recipe, but I certainly added my own flair. Everyone came back for seconds and thirds and begged me for the recipe. It's an awesome crisp! Here is what I did differently.  I used a mix of Granny Smiths and Red Delicious. Added 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 full because of the apple mixture. Added in caramel sprinkles from Pampered Chef. Perfection! I added about 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. Added nutmeg and salt (a dash). Doubled the topping and used old fashion oats and just a little more than 2 sticks of butter. With doubling the topping it requires 2.  These changes ended up making it the perfect combination of tart, sweet, salty, buttery, and crunchy. It's amazing. I'm eager to make it again.  Flipping fantastic!"
"4","5","Oh wow! This is amazing! I did as others recommeded, tossed the apples with the sugar, etc and doubled the topping. I used a lot less sugar since I used fujis. I didn't have enough butter so ended up using some coconut oil, oh yum! Also added some cranberries and a little walnuts."
"4","5","Not only did I love it, but everyone around loved it. Heard over and over that it was the best apple crisp they ever had. They keep asking me to make more. People are bringing apples and begging. I read some of the reviews and followed some of the suggestions. I did not add water, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon sugar mix before putting them in the pan. I then doubled the topping and put it all on the top. People loved that because it gives them more crunch with the apples. Enjoy!!!"
"4","3","As written, this recipe is just okay. It does not need any water at all. The water actually ruins it. I also think that adding a pinch of nutmeg gives it that little something extra. With those 2 changes, this is a 5 star recipe."
"4","4","I agree with other reviewers. As written, this is too sweet, but some of that depends on the apples you choose. I had golden delicious from a trip to the local orchard so my apples were too sweet for the amount of sugar specified. I will use Granny's next time and a little less sugar. I think the water was unnecessary, but I imagine that also depends on your apples. I had to use a paper towel to soak up some of the water after the first piece came out of the dish. I followed the recipe except I made an 8x8 casserole. I halved the filling but made the whole topping recipe as someone else suggested. The topping was good but I agree with another reviewer that some finely chopped nuts would be a good addition. Really good recipe, I will make again with some tweaks."
"4","5","This is a wonderful apple crisp, DH said that it was even better than his favorite cheesecake. Looks like I have another keeper recipe."
"4","5","I've made this 3 times now, I agree with other reviewers it's the best apple crisp i've made with one exception, I do not add the water. I use macs and I usually use about 3 1/2 lbs (prior to peeling and coring). I too find this to be my go to crisp recipe."
"4","5","What's a great way to say goodbye to Summer and hello to Fall? This recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did followed a reader's suggestion and baked it in a 8x8 pan. I used 8 Granny Smith apples and cut them in thicker chunks. I think next time I'll use a bit less water but other than that, it was fantastic!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"4","4","Very nice treat - look forward to trying with other fruit. Love how easy it was. Only used 1/3 cups white sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar with golden delicious apples and sweetness was just right. Included ground flax seed in the 'crisp' mixture to add extra fiber."
"4","5","Fabulous. Better than mine. I added brown sugar instead of white, 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 and a little nutmeg as well as the cinnamon. 1/2 cup of water would have been fine. It would have mixed well with the brown sugar and given more syrup. Next time I will follow the appropriate amt of water. Served with vanilla ice cream but was great without. On a scale of 1 to 10, my family gave this a 15. Wonderful, thanks for sharing."
"4","5","I live in India so we don't get granny smith apples all the time. I baked it with 8 red delicious apples with 2tsp of lemon juice for tartness, skipped water(as suggested in other reviews), reduced sugar to half and wow!!! My kids and hubby finished the whole thing. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. A definite keeper."
"4","5","Amazing, just simply amazing! I made this as a dessert for my family and it was just the easiest thing to make. I made it while making dinner and by the time everyone was done with their meals, the crisp was out of the oven, cooled, and ready to be served. I myself didn't use granny smiths because I can't handle the tartness of the apple, so I used red delicious and you would have thought it'd be too sweet, but it actually wasn't. I added a bit of cinnamon to the oat mixture with just a dash of nutmeg just to give it a bit more of that warmth you get from great dishes like this one. Perfect cooking time, measurements, everything. Had the whole house smelling like it was late fall again! I recommend this recipe to anyone looking to whip something up for dessert, because this is phenomenal and just off the charts."
"4","5","I made this for a coworker's fall birthday and it was fantastic. I used Fiji apples, which bake well. The amount of topping to apples ratio was perfect too. I always have issues getting crisp topping to be the right consistency when I use cold butter. Finally, using melted butter, the consistency was exactly right. My husband was surprised. He's a professional baker and cutting in melted butter flies in the face of baking logic, but I've used it in other recipes and it works. Well done and thanks for sharing Diane!"
"4","5","JUST the kind of recipe I was looking for! Easy, yet produces the 'Yum' factor for guests and family we look for at the end of a meal!! As other reviewers suggested, I omitted the water, (I used 3 types of apples) added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and doubled the topping. Was perfect for a 9X13 pan. This will be my 'standard' from now on..."
"4","5","I make these all the time. I do cut back on the white sugar and use cherries instead of apples. Great recipe!"
"4","5","GREAT! only change I made was to add a a teaspoon of ground ginger with the cinnamon. So good with ice cream!"
"4","4","Very good! Don't change anything."
"4","5","I've been making this apple crisp for many years. I won't even try another recipe.....my family loves it."
"4","5","To die for!! Make sure to double the topping! Perfect with cinnamon ice cream...a great fall treat!"
"4","5","I made it with half peaches half apples, and it was delicious!"
"4","5","This is an awesome recipe and can be used with other fruit too! I added some pecans to the crust and it gave it some more crunch and great flavor! I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg over the apples. I will make this recipe again!"
"4","5","this was a fabulous recipe - I used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 of white sugar on the apple topping with about 1/2 a cup of water. Doubled the crumble topping as other reviewers recommended. PERFECTLY cooked in 45-50 minutes."
"4","5","This was great. I made a few changes to make it diabetic friendly and it was a big hit. I used Smart Balance for baking in place of the butter/margarine. I used 1/2 cup Slenda Brown Sugar in place of the brown sugar. I used 1 cup of White Slenda for the sugar. I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts."
"4","5","Terrific, but make sure you use a full 10 cups of sliced apples. I had fewer to work with and it came out a bit too sweet, I knew it was due to not enough apples to begin with. My Picky son loved it. He is picky about both his apple pie and his apple crisp."
"4","4","It was delicious, the only critique I'd make is for the crust to meld together and get crispier. I took a few reviewers suggestions and doubled the crust making a bottom and top layer. I didn't alter the water, however I did mix Granny Smith apples cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar and water together, let set together while mixing ingredients for the crust. In my opinion, it would have been too dry with less water."
"4","5","Excellent. I followed the advice to use 1/4 cup water rather than 1/2 cup water. It was the perfect amount of moisture. I used Granny Smith apples which I would recommend as they are tarter than Delicious or other sweeter eating apples. I did put in a pinch of nutmeg because I like that flavor and as others, I doubled the 'crisp' part. When I assembled it, I mixed the apples in the sugar mixture and when I put on the 'crumbly part' I ended up not using all of the double batch. Next time I will make 1 1/2 batch and that will be perfect. This will now be my one and only apple crisp recipe. Thank you for the recipe."
"4","5","By far, the best apple crisp I have ever eaten. I've made many, many recipes before but this is the 'apple of my eye'. And so easy ... who would have thought? Thank you for submitting this. It goes into my permanent recipe file."
"4","4","Fabulous recipe! I've tweaked it to my tastes and have yet to hear any complaints. I've cut both the white and brown sugar back to 1/3C each. I've also substituted the water with Disarono, Grand Marnier or Cognac - whichever happens to be on hand. The sugar from the liqueur makes up for cutting the white and brown sugar from the recipe. This is a fabulous go to dessert!"
"4","5","I love this apple crisp!! I keep making it because it's so good and really simple. I do think that the apple quantity does not match up with the topping; if I use only 4 apples the crumb topping covers it okay (but is still skimpier than I like), but if I use more than that (I like to use 6 apples) I need to double the topping.  Aside from doubling the topping, I don't change a thing in this recipe. I have tried variations of it (less sugar, less water, no water) and I think the water is necessary. Without the water the apples are too dry. The one time I made it without water I had to add extra milk (I always eat my crisp with milk) and it still wasn't as good. Those who don't like really sweet desserts may want to use less sugar, but I love the recipe as it is. Thanks for posting!"
"4","5","Splenda was used since I am diabetic and let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS! I was able to enjoy an entire desert and not worry about my blood sugar! Excellent recipe and I love the crisp on the top! Amazing!"
"4","5","Excellent apple crisp recipe! After reading other reviews I made the following changes: used Granny Smith apples (6), reduced water to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, cut in room temperature butter instead of melted, and doubled the crumb topping. It came out delicious! The texture was perfect and not too watery -- just right. Next time I will use only 5 apples to leave more room for extra crumb topping. I will also reduce the sugar to 1/2 - 3/4 cup -- it was a bit too sweet for me. I will also try to make larger crumb pieces for a crispier topping. For a first run, this was an excellent start! With a few tweaks of personal preference it will be perfect! Thanks for sharing Diane :)"
"4","4","I would use less sugar in the apple mixture next time, especially if serving with ice cream. Would also be good with some chopped walnuts added to the topping."
"4","5","omg!!! this is sooooo good. I have been making this for the past 3 years. I took a break for 6 months. My co-worker noticed and requested it again!!! Since then, it has been my secret weapon! I took sugar out (if you use fiji apples, they have that extra sweetness you need) and added a teaspoon of cinnamon for extra kick. I also added a tablespoon of lemon to help prevent browning of the apples ."
"4","5","I make this recipe atleast twice a year, Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is super delicious. I always double the topping (my favourite part) and I actually reduce the sugar by half because my family does not like eating sweet desserts. I tend to do this in general with most dessert recipes and they turn out just fine. I also use half a cup of orange juice instead of the water which helps keep the apples from oxidizing. Thank-You so much for sharing a simple and delicious recipe! I will definitely pass this on to friends and family."
"4","5","Made this with Granny Smith apples and half the sugar mixture mixed in with it but it was too tart. Made this the second time with golden delicious apples and the full amount of sugar mixed in and it was PERFECT! Served warm with ice cream."
"4","5","I've made this recipe twice, and I thought I lost it and panicked! I'll be making it again tomorrow. When I make it, I use brown instead of white sugar, and I only use 1/2 a cup as well. I found that only 1/4 C of water was necessary too, as others have said. I also doubled the topping. The first time I made it, I at first made a single batch of the topping and then mixed another before sliding it into the oven because it was clearly not enough for my personal preference. I topped this with a small amount of fresh whipped cream for a perfect dessert!"
"4","5","Soooo good!! I'd love to double the recipe though, so that there's more apple!!"
"4","5","I cut the recipe in half and it fit nicely in a square pan. It took 6 apples to make the 5 cups neccessary for a half a recipe, and I sliced them thin about 1/4'. Instead of quick oats I used old fashioned oats because I like the look and texture of the whole oats. This was delicious and the right blend of sweetness and crispness. Thank you Diane."
"4","5","This was really delicious! I also used only 1/4 cup of water, and that was PLENTY! I think it would be much too wet at the bottom if 1/2 cup of water is added. It was a quick, easy recipe that really impressed my guests. Thank you!"
"4","5","This recipe is perfect the way it is! I made it as directed except for making 1/2 a batch and using an 8x8 pan. I used a good baking apple from our local orchard, I think they were Cortland. Don't change a thing about this recipe because it's perfect as written!"
"4","5","Excellent! Made this for a family cookout and it disappeared quickly. Followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the crumb topping, and I also tossed the apples in the sugar mix, and also added a little nutmeg to the apples. Turned out great and will definitely be making this again."
"4","5","One of our fav recipes to make- I usually make it when we have company and everyone loves it. You really do not need to add the water though- I have always left it out and it works perfect!"
"4","2","This recipe was okay. It wasn't as tastey as I was hoping. Followed it exactly. I will keep looking."
"4","5","YUM! This was the best apple crisp I've ever had! I left out the water and so glad I did because there was juice at the bottom from the apples after baking. It was more like a 'carmely' sauce, so with added water...it would have been too runny. Also, I used Fuji apples, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and doubled the crumble topping. Another tip: DON'T MELT THE BUTTER! Just soften it, wash your hands and squeeze/crumble the butter into the topping mixture...the warmth of your hands will make the perfect crumbly texture. I served this with French Vanilla Bean ice cream and it was PERFECT! Definitely going to keep making this one...THANK YOU! =)"
"4","5","I've made this twice now and it's been GREAT both times! Plan to make again in the next day or two. Delicious, homey recipe. Be sure and use a mix of BAKING apple varieties. Not all apples are suited for baking. I read some of the negative reviews and can't figure out where they went wrong. For those complaining that the topping is too dry, be sure that you've melted the butter and mixed it thoroughly with the other topping ingredients. Kudos, Diane, on a recipe going in my permanent file!"
"4","4","This was very good! However after baking I had lot of liquid in my pan. It may be from the type of apples I used(Cortland). I drained a good bit of it out of the pan, thickened it with cornstarch and poured over the top of the crisp.This was an overall great recipe. Next time I will try different apples or omit the water all together."
"4","5","This is Fall dessert Heaven! I forgot to add the water, and it turned out just fine. The topping was 'crisp'-y, and almost like a crumbled oatmeal cookie. Fabulous & easy, will make again soon!"
"4","5","I was soooo happy to find this recipe! It's exactly the same recipe that I'd found in one of my grandmother's very old cookbooks (from, maybe the 1910's), but I lost it about 10 years ago. The topping tastes like cookie! (I admit to eating some of the topping mix raw, lol.) Like other commenters, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, I added some nutmeg to that mixture, and I also used less water. I doubled the topping, and I used softened butter rather than melted."
"4","5","WOW! This is my 'go-to' recipe for apple crisp! We had a bumper crop of apples this year and I'm now baking our 4th pan. As per earlier reviews, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon-sugar mixture before putting in the pan and omitted the water. I also doubled the topping recipe and it is SOOO YUMMY!!!! Each time we've served it to guests they ask for the recipe, that's a great sign. Thanks for the recipe, it's one for the family collection!"
"4","5","I made this recipe especially because it included oats, which give an extra great taste to the topping! It turned out pretty nice. I kept in the water and didn't have any problem with the crisp being watery. In fact, the extra moisture helps the topping, which remains rather dry all-around. For next time, I would add perhaps 1/4 cup more butter for the topping, as it was a little dry and not rich enough. Also, I might cut down the white sugar to 1/2 cup because the result is indeed quite sweet. I will definitely make this again and might even try it with some cherries. Yum. Very nice comfort food!"
"4","5","WOW! WOW! WOW! That is what I have to say...This is the best i have ever ate. My whole family loves it. I tell you how we eat it...put a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on it. Thank you for this recipe."
"4","5","Very good recipe. Though next time I will add a few more oats to the topping."
"4","5","I like my crisp to be crisp, so I make it with out the water. Turns out great every time!"
"4","5","This a great, classic apple crisp recipe. We loved it. I don't agree with other reviewers that it had too much water. To make it healthier I mixed 1/4 cup of honey with the apples instead of sugar and used whole wheat flour. It doesn't affect the flavor at all, and makes it good enough to be considered a healthy dessert. For a variation, I tried it one time with frozen cranberries and some nutmeg mixed in, and it transported me right to the holidays. I can't wait to make it again for Christmas time (of course I could make it any time of the year, but detracts from the special holiday feel:)."
"4","5","I have made apple crisp a million times. I just threw out my old recipe.. This is perfection and I am a perfectionist. Oh sure a trillion people want to change the recipe to there liking, but to those of you who haven't tried this yet, make it the way it is. You can add your allspice or nutmeg, but that even might take away from its originality. I love the crumbley crisp part, so I double it. also I dont like alot of the syrup so I nix the water and sprinkle some vanilla. 5 stars well deserved here, this is now my regular sunday night all time favorite."
"4","5","This is an updated review. Really liked this recipe :) Changed just a little to our taste. Used 3 lbs. granny smith apples, no water. Used 1/2 cup real maple syrup to replace 1/2 of the sugar, used brown sugar for the other half. Made 1 and 1/2 times the topping which was perfect for us. This was very traditional apple crisp, just what we were looking for. Thank you for the recipe!"
"4","4","I have made many apple pies, crisps, etc. and this is very good. I've made it 3 times and this is what I have done differently.. 1)cut back on the water and instead of using water, I used 1/2 cider, 1/2 lemon juice  2) I mixed a little bit of nutmeg in with the apple mixture.  3) I was trying to make it a bit more 'crispy' on top, so I put underneath the broiler set on low for a quick moment. Next time I might drizzle more butter on top, also"
"4","4","I followed other reviewers and doubled the oatmeal/sugar mixture, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to apples and used only 1/4 cup water. I will remember to grease well my pan next time, because my crisp stuck on the bottom. I had probably sweeter type of apples because it was too sweet for us, so I might decrease the sugar and/or add some lemon juice. Otherwise pretty good."
"4","5","Oh wow, I followed the recipe exactly despite what a few others had said, and I tell you, this was FANTASTIC!! It was great sered with vanilla ice cream and a touch of caramel ice cream topping!"
"4","4","A decent crisp recipe, but it didn't need all that water. I think it's a matter of knowing your apples and how much moisture/sugar they need. I prefer brown sugar in a crisp, so that's what I used. But if you want an after-dinner dessert that goes together quickly, this will do it."
"4","5","This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 8x8 pan because I needed a smaller batch. I baked for 35 minutes also. However, I kept the recipe the same and it was PERFECT!"
"4","5","I've been searching for a recipe like this for years! It reminds me of a one my mom used to make for desserts when I was a kid. My husband and I both loved it. Instead of water I splashed the top with pure vanilla, it made the house smell GREAT after it was finished baking."
"4","5","I made this for my mom to take to a dinner party.  Right off the bat I used 2 granny smith and 5 Macintosh apples. It was for a smaller dish (9 by 9) so I meant to cut the sugar down a bit because of the sweeter apples and size, but I forgot and used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown as well as added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon. I tossed the apples in the sugar/flour mixture before pouring them in the dish. I also only used 1/4 cup water as per other reviews. Then I did 1 and 1/2 times the topping so I could put some on the bottom, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to that.   By all accounts it was perfect. Not too sweet which is shocking! This recipe is a definite winner!"
"4","4","3.5 stars as written, 10+++ stars with simple modifications. Here's what I did a little bit differently: (1) instead of adding 1 cup of white sugar to the apples I added 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white. That was plenty, and next time I'll just add 1/2 of brown. (2) added 1tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of allspice to the crust. (3) used a cheese grater to grate 1/2 cup of almost frozen butter to the topping mixture instead of the melted butter. Melted butter will never get you a 'crisp' topping, it will give you a 'crumble' topping instead. I also added a few shreds of butter to the top of the final 'crisp' crust. My crust was 'crispy' and golden brown. The BEST CRISP I've ever had!!!!!!!"
"4","5","This really did turn out great, thanks to some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I cut the water to about 1/8 cup of water and added 1/8 cup of lemon juice to the apples. Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg as well. Also, as ALLY99 suggested, do not melt the butter for the crumble. Instead, let the butter come to room temperature and just work it in with the other dry ingredients using a fork until the mixture looks crumbly. You also need to DOUBLE the topping recipe...it may seem like too much, but it comes out just right."
"4","5","AWESOME! I used 8 Granny Smith apples, approx 4 1/2 pounds. I also followed the advice of other reviewers: I stirred the sugar mixture in the apples and let sit for approximately 1/2 an hour. I also doubled the crisp recipe and lay some (about a 1/3 of mixture) on the bottom and the rest on the top. Additions: 2 T. of lemon juice and 2T. of vanilla, 1/2 t nutmeg, and decreased water to 1/4c. I increased baking time to an hour, as I like the top to have a bit more crunch. Great recipe!"
"4","5","So incredibly good. The only thing you shouldn't do is line the apples neatly in the pan, because it blocks the steam from cooking them (I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I ended up with a not-as-cooked-as-I-would-have-liked dessert), so just toss them in the dish."
"4","5","My husband LOVED this! Said is was 'almost as good as grandma's, which is truly a compliment! The thinner the apple slices the better...I like it to be quite soft on the bottom. The 1/4C. of water suggestion was really helpful. I halfed the white sugar and it was great. Could have bee because I used Gala apples which are pretty sweet as is. Great recipe, going into the family favourites recipe book!"
"4","5","Absolutely AMAZING...I used Granny Smiths, doubled the crust...(top and bottom),1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 TBSP of cinnamon and 1/4 cup water ....upon reading the other reviews....and topped it off with caramel topping!!!Guests all loved it!!!"
"4","4","Taste was good. I omitted the water with the apples like others suggested, but thought it was a little too dry. It tasted perfect with ice cream, but I will add 1/4c water next time."
"4","5","Received rave reviews from several people for this dessert tonight ... three people asked for the recipe! It really was excellent.  I doubled the topping to make a bottom layer. I also decreased the white sugar amount by half, and only added about three tablespoons of water. It did not need any more water than that. I also did add about a half teaspoon of nutmeg, which I think was a nice added something to the recipe.  A definite keeper that I will make again and again."
"4","4","The additional water is completely unnecessary! The finished product was beautiful but when we served it, it was a bit watery! Next time, I will let the natural juice stand on its own. The 'crisp' is yummy though!"
"4","5","This was just what I was craving! :) I didn't really read many of the reviews before I started baking but I would agree that you could cut back on the sugar and add more cinnamon. I used granny smith apples and it turned out wonderfully! Overall, it's excellent!"
"4","5","This is amazing! I have made this twice and both times it was loved. I took the suggestions and cut the water to 1/4 cup and added nutmeg to the apples. I used 5 granny smith apples and increased the crust ingredients so that I could have some on the top and some on the bottom. Also, the second time I made this, I cut the butter into the flour instead of melting it, to provide a crumblier texture. Both times I received the crumble appearance and crunch but with the butter cut in, the texture was looser vs. crust-like with the melted version. Both ways are good, just a matter of preference! In addition, adding blueberries and/or nuts to the apples just adds an extra delicious touch."
"4","5","The crust was sooo good! I made minor changes like tossing the apples in the cinnamon/sugar/flour mix and using only 1/4 cup of water as others suggested."
"4","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten! It was simple to make too. I did do as others suggested and instead of sprinkling the sugar and cinnamon on the apples, I mixed it all together with the apples before putting them in the dish. I used a 9x9x2 pan since I halved the amount of apples. I used 5 medium granny smith apples and left all the topping amounts the same(we love crunchy topping). I only added 1 Tbs of water and that was plenty. You get the natural juices from the apples. I cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 and it came out fantastic. We served this warm out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream! All I can say is YUM!!! I will definitely e making this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
"4","5","I needed a good recipe to use up the bag of apples that my family wouldn't eat (got an off-brand when it as on sale and didn't go over well!). The apples themselves were a little too sweet for all the sugar that was called for, but the crust--WOW. SO good! I want to make this again! I served it with vanilla ice cream and caramel topping."
"4","4","I took this to a potluck. No one said it was good and no one asked for the recipe. Wished I would have just kept it home and ate it all by myself."
"4","5","Very, very good. Whole family loved it. Followed the advice of other reviewers. Used a 5lb. bag of granny smiths this filled up 9 x 13 pan to the top. Then I did not add water, let the apples and sugar sit for 10 or 15 minutes before cooking. Added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger to the topping, more butter, one and a half the topping. In the apple mixture, less sugar, 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup, used half brown sugar and half white. Added a little lemon juice to the apple mixture. 1 tbs cinnamon instead of 1 tsp. to the apple mixture. Turned out great."
"4","4","This is definitely VERY tasty. However..do NOT add water. I also do not agree with making the topping for both top and bottom. Way too much, and way too sweet. I used Granny Smith apples, and will again. I did mix the apples with the sugar, cinnamon, and I also used nutmeg. I believe however, that you really do not need a cup of sugar, so I will cut that down next time to maybe 2/3. You have enough brown sugar in this recipe to help sweeten things up. I did let the apples soak in the mixture for about 10 minutes, then layered with the rest."
"4","5","Amazing. I took other reviewer's advice by doubling the topping recipe. I then layered the sugar/oat/flour mixture on the bottom, placed the apples on top, and sprinkled the sugar mixture. THEN I drizzled a little bit of carmel apple dip on top before adding the top layer of crumble. Rave reviews. I will make this again very soon!"
"4","5","Everyone loved this apple crisp. My husband loves a lot of topping so I doubled the topping recipe. Thanks!"
"4","5","This is my all time favorite recipe for apple crisp. It is simply the best!! I can't tell you how many times I've had to print out the recipe for friends after they tried it!! Now, whenever I take it to a gathering, I've learned to make copies of the recipe ahead of time because I know people are going to ask me for it! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!"
"4","5","Please, make double the crust; you won't be dissapointed. And like many of the other reviews said, add either half of the water or none at all. I added just a bit of water and it turned out perfect. I added some nutmeg and more cinnamon than what's called for. I also wasn't too careful about the 10 cups of apples. I know I added alot more and it shouldn't make much difference if you don't measure the apples just so. Serve with ice cream ... Breyers light vanilla ice cream is great stuff!"
"4","5","wonderful wonderful wonderful! The only thing I had to change was to reduce the sugar to half the recommended amounts in the topping and hardly anything to the filling; plus with the cinnamon (doubled the amount!) it didnt seem to need any extra sweetening. I agree that adding pecans to the top (and filling) made it extra delightful. HAS TO be served with cream or icecream!"
"4","5","I made this recipe this weekend and it was fantastic! As suggested by other reviewers, I made 50% more topping. No other changes and it was perfection. Thanks for the recipe!"
"4","5","used 8/8 pan with 4 apples and left everything else the same, but bake for 1 hr (throw it in just before you serve dinner.) Must use water to create caramel sauce. This recipe is fail proof!"
"4","5","An excellent recipe! I wouldn't change any of the ingredients, because it turns out perfect every time! You must try this."
"4","2","It had great potential, but it was WAY too sweet for me. I should have read the reviews before trying it out - then I would have known to use MUCH less sugar. I'll try it again just because I can see that it would have been really delicious if I wasn't choking on how sugary it was."
"4","5","The first time I made according to the recipe. It was way way WAY too sweet.  I cut sugar in half as was suggested. It was still quite sweet. I also added 1/2 cup oc chopped walnuts and used smart balance butter spread in place of butter.  It was excellent with the modifications.  Original ** with less suger *****"
"4","4","This recipe has potential just needing a little tweaking. I would use 1/4 flour in the apples, two Tbls of cinnamon, no water, and a dash of nutmeg. Underneath the topping in my crisp there were apples floating in LOTS of liquid. 2) Continue to double the topping, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of salt. Make extra topping which is the best part! Other than really good."
"4","5","It hardly seems fair that a dessert so easy to make can be this good. I took the advice of many others and doubled the topping. I used Splenda in place of sugar and used Fat Free I Can't Believe It's Not Butter in place of the butter for the topping. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and added apple pie spice as well.   I think it is the best still slightly warm and served with vanilla custard ice cream. MmMmMmM!"
"4","5","Had a half bushel of Honey Crisp apples and this was a great way to use some of them. Like some of the others - No water, double the toppings, reduced the sugars. Tasted great with ice cream. Anyone know how to incorporate chocolate or caramel into it?"
"4","5","I made this for my boyfriend (I don't particularly like cooked apples) and we ate every bite of it in two days. I made an 8x8 version with 5 large Granny Smith apples. As others have suggested, I only used 1/3 cup of white sugar in the mixture that goes on top of the apples, and I eliminated the water. I made the amount of topping in the original recipe and had some left over. The texture was perfect, and the flavor was absoulutely delicious! I think the Granny Smith apples were just right for this dish- they created a fantastic tart/sweet combination. Wonderful!"
"4","5","I love the crisp topping-I use less sugar and double the recipe. This topping is great on all fruit crisps! Especially love it on strawberry/rhubarb! I,like other reviewers, do not add the water, I find the fruit has enough natural juice in it. Great recipe-thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","Absolutely perfect! I made this and my husband, my two children and myself ate this all within 24 hours. I have been looking for a good Apple Crisp recipe for a long time and this is the best one ever. So very easy to make; all I had to buy was the apples, I had everything else on hand. My family thanks you (I have already passed this out a number of times)"
"4","5","I was told by family and friends that this was the best Apple Crisp they ever had. I made a little bit more of the topping and that made it even better! I highly recommend this recipe."
"4","5","Ok, it takes quite a bit to get me to give something 5 stars. This is it! This will be my apple crisp recipe forever! Then I'll pass it on to my two daughters! I did make a couple of adjustments based on the reviews (which I LOVE). I cut the brown sugar in the topping to 3/4 C and I omitted the water and used a squeeze of lemon juice over the apples. It was terrific! Thanks!"
"4","5","Oh my gosh, I was so impressed at how easy this recipe is, not to mention how good. My husband loves it and I think I may have topped my 'Martha Stewart' like sister dessert this year. You have to try it!!!"
"4","4","It is good, but watery?? I was hoping it would thicken up as it cooled, but no such luck. I followed the recipe, although only used about 8 cups of apples. I guess next time I would not add as much water. The flavor is good though."
"4","5","Awesome! I have tried several of the apple crisp recipes on this site and this is by far my favorite. My family loves it as well."
"4","5","oh my goodness, this was so good! The combination of ingredients are excellent as was the texture. I made this for dessert on a fall afternoon and the house smelled wonderful and I served it with vanilla icecream......simple and yummy!"
"4","5","Easy and delicious. I also reduced the sugar. I was using a sweeter apple (not sure of the name) so I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. This is a great recipe! I made it twice in 3 days... have to get rid of all those apples growing in my backyard and this is a great way to do that! :)"
"4","5","Yum! I scaled the recipe to only use 8 cups of apples and it turned out great. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream is a must!"
"4","4","I was a little dissapointed after all the good reviews. it was ok. the icecream is very necessary for it to be good. i'd atleast half the apples for one family to eat. i have a ton of leftovers. i cut back on the sugar like everyone said. if your crazy about apples i'd try it but if not i wouldnt bother."
"4","5","this recipe was absolutely delicious! i loved it. it was very easy to make, and very tasty warmed up with some vanilla ice cream. unfortunately, after about a week, the topping gets soggy, but it will probably disappear long before that! it would be great for a dinner party. (i used 6 large granny smith apples, which turned out to be about 8 cups. the 8 cups filled my 9x13 pan completely. if you put ten cups in, be sure to put a cookie sheet underneathe the pan when you bake it, or it will probably drip in your oven."
"4","5","This is a delicious dessert. Everyone loved it. I served it with cool whip topping. mmm..."
"4","5","I've made this receipe several times. It's the best apple crisp I've ever tasted and it's easy to make. It doesn't last long at our house!!!"
"4","5","A really good recipe. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the topping. We had it warm with vanilla ice cream. I will definately make this again!"
"4","5","The recipe was delicous. I made it in school the one day to try it and everyone in my class loved it. So I made it as part of my project and served it to the two people I had come in. They loved it too. It was really big thing for everyone that tried it. I would make it over and over again."
"3","4","I just made this and it's pretty good, but the water made it kinda runny. I'd go with 1/4 cup or maybe just a little apple juice and no sugar. I used red apples and it is a little too sweet for me too. I think with granny smith and less water it would be perfect! I love the crunchy crust!"
"3","5","nom nom, words escape me for how tasty...nom nom..."
"3","5","fixed this for a big bunco group and they loved it very tasty used granny smith apples. Put a scoop of ice cream on this and man was it good!!! very easy to fix too"
"3","4","This turned out great! I'm only giving it 4 stars because it does need some tweaking. The water is definitely unnecessary because it's almost too runny just from the water baked from the apples. The half brown/white sugar is a great edit, too. I made the apples and crumble mixture ahead of time and refrigerated both until it was time for dessert. I then sprinkled the crumble on top and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. It is wonderful served with vanilla ice cream and caramel!"
"3","5","I've made this a few times, and it works GREAT!   I just made a couple changes to the Apple part. I skipped the water completely, and I altered the apple seasoning a bit. Instead of just Cinnamon, I opted for a mulling spice mix (Cinnamon, Allspice, Nutmeg, and Cloves) and I love the result. I also use about 1.5-2 Tablespoons instead of just a teaspoon. I used a hand coffee grinder to pull out the fresh-ground flavors a bit more, but, I'm sure that pre-ground would work fine as well.  Overall, love this one!!"
"3","5","This apple crisp is soooo delicious! I've made the recipe both as written and with a few modifications. As written, it's still really good but just a few minor changes really perfect the recipe. First, I add 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture. I also mix the apples (I use 6-7 large Granny Smiths) with the cinnamon sugar mixture rather than pouring on top. I only add 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2, which adds just the right amount of moisture. For the crumb topping, I add just a small pinch (1/8 teaspoon) salt, and I cut cold diced butter into the crumb topping rather than melted butter. This yields a more 'crumbly' topping. Baking for 45 minutes has worked perfectly for me. This apple crisp is so good that my fiancé ate through almost the whole batch himself within 2 days (and that was with a little self control haha), and begged me to make it again that same week! It's AMAZING!!! :)"
"3","5","Delicious!! Ok people ,, those of you who rate recipes with 5 stars and change the recipe in a number of ways. Does not make sense. So I am giving it the most delicious Apple crisp I have ever made and I didn't change a thing."
"3","4","The flavor was good but the apples were too mushy for our taste. Next time I won't add water. I also cut them very thin so I will slice thicker. I doubled the topping but it was a tad too much so I think 1.5 the amount of topping would be perfect. Also added a dash of nutmeg for our taste. Great start just need to modify the mushiness."
"3","5","Super easy and delicious! The second time I made it I cut the sugar by 25% and It was even more delicious."
"3","5","Amazing!!! My family raves over it! I always double the topping...because well more topping is always better, right? Love"
"3","5","This is so delicious, it's unreal. honestly. You need to make this. I decided to leave out the water because I prefer it on the thick/hearty side and used less apples (because I only had a small dish) - but other than that, followed the recipe exactly and my man and I were in a surreal apple crisp heaven!! I want to eat this every single day. Forever and ever. It's probably the best dessert I've ever had, and I'm the kind of girl who would pretty much always choose dessert over dinner, so that's saying something! ;)"
"3","5","I made this and my family went crazy. This is sooo delicious"
"3","5","I loved this recipe. It was my first time ever making any kind of crisp and it turned out to be so delicious. My only issue was that I didn't know how many apples equaled 10 cups, so I went out and bought 8 apples. Well after I had peeled and sliced all of them, I realized not all would fit in the 9x13 pan. I ended up wasting a few apples, but now I know. I followed other reviewers' advice about using Granny Smith apples, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly how it says. I will be making this for my family so I can show off what a great cook I am now, even though this recipe is extremely easy, but they don't need to know that."
"3","5","This recipe is great! I give this 10 stars if there were that many. This is so....easy and so.....good. I definitely recommend you make this and you will see and taste how good it is. Easier than making a pie. Believe me, it will not last very long at all. I used yellow delicious that was given to me."
"3","5","It's absolutely delicious. I am constantly getting compliments when I make it. The only thing I changed was based on personal taste. I changed the type of Apple and my dad accidentally cut the apples in cubes but we ended up liking it better that way."
"3","5","Delicious and easy to make!"
"3","5","LOVE THIS Recipe!!! I did not have any raw rolled oats and was forced to try instant oat meal. After the allotted baking time I discovered it was not even close to being done so I added milk cinnamon and sugar slowly over the next 2 additional hours at a low temp of 135 in the oven! I have now purchased raw oats and can't wait to make it again"
"3","5","GREAT RECIPE!! I havent't tried it yet (it is baking in my oven), but I can't wait to!! The whole house smells brilliantly, and my mouth is watering...."
"3","5","This was really easy to make and it tasted awesome. I didn't change the recipe, but I did add 1Tsp (teaspoon) of cardamom. It smelled wonderful while it cooked and the Cardamom added a lovely warm note to this dish. I also used three different types of apples to give it some variety. Really great recipe!"
"3","5","This recipe is amazing! Absolutely fantastic!"
"3","3","good recipe, great taste, but I would omit the water and only use half the sugar as it was to runny and to sweet for my taste."
"3","5","Let me add my 2 cents to these reviews. Awesome! I made this for a recent get together at my house and people just loved it. Thank you for the recipe! I did use a gallon bag and mixed the apples with the spices. I also doubled the topping and put some on the bottom of the pan. Added a small amount of nutmeg. All of these were suggestions made by others. Oh, I also cut the white sugar to a 1/2 cup. Perfect."
"3","5","Best Apple Crisp! But it makes a lot. Maybe cut the recipe in half if you're only making for a few people. Ice cream is a must!"
"3","5","Very sweet and very tasty! I did double the topping and added chopped pecans as someone suggested. It would have been good with or without the pecans."
"3","3","I found this to be WAY too sweet. The sugar overpowered everything, especially once it cooled off. If I try this recipe again, I'd cut down on both the white sugar and brown sugar. I also added a bit of vanilla, which was nice."
"3","5","Delicious! I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers. Also, instead of water, used 1/2 cup of BRANDY. Oh yes. Yes. YES!!!"
"3","5","Tried this last night with great success! Absolutely delicious! I need look no further for an apple crisp recipe. In the past, I could never get a topping that was truely crumbly but a tip from one of the reviewers really helped: After adding the melted butter (real butter please)lightly press the mixture down into the bowl and refrigerate for 30m and then break it up with a fork before crumbling evenly over the apple mixture."
"3","4","Very simple and tastes delicious. Needs a little more of the 'crisp' on the top."
"3","5","This is the best apple crisp ever! Very easy, and came out perfect! I will say though I did not add the water. I simply slices the apples (8 granny smiths, and 2 fuji's) and let them rest in a bowl for 10 mins. Letting the juice run off and that substituted for the water. It turned out so yummy and I don't see any point in using the water.  I look forward to making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"3","5","I made this recipe yesterday for a family get together. AWESOME! It was easy to make and my family gobbled it up! I did follow some of the suggestions and did not add any water. The apples had enough 'juice'. I did let the apples sit for about 30 mins or so with the filling ingredients mixed in rather than sprinkled on top. This let the juice come out of the apples a little to create the liquid. I also doubled the topping and added chopped pecans. I also was not stingy on the cinnamon! I'm going to make this for one of my Thanksgiving desserts as well!"
"3","4","I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving out the water and adding nutmeg to the sugar and cinnamon. This was very good! I made this early in the day and pulled it out to bake while I was cooking dinner. The top was crisp and the apples were sweet-tart and soft. I think I sliced some of the apples too thin, they came out like applesauce. Next time I will make bigger chunks of apple... but otherwise this recipe is a keeper."
"3","5","I followed the reviews and made 1 1/2 crisp topping. Also added salt to the crisp mix. And 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to apples. Delicious!!!"
"3","5","The apple crisp is super delicious and we all loved it. My daughter wants me to make it everyday. The one thing I did different is after I sprinkled the sugar mixture on the apples I mix the apples so they all get coated. Thanks for sharing!  -Angela"
"3","5","So delicious! I did take the advice from other reviews and doubled the topping! Definitely a must try!!"
"3","2","Crisp was runny, did not need water. Also less flour and more oats would improve texture and taste."
"3","5","Simply delicious. This is so easy and yummy. Only thing to change is don't even bother adding the water. Other than this, it is perfect. Will make this again and again."
"3","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe that I have ever used. I followed the advice of some of the cooks on this site by putting only half the amount of water recommended and the consistency was perfect. Everything else was done exactly as stated in the recipe. I am a fan of Pampered Chef stoneware and I baked my apple crisp in my 10x13 pan for even heating and browning. I also posted this recipe on Facebook and send a copy to my step daughter."
"3","1","Way too sweet! Hurt my teeth, couldn't stomach it. Couldn't taste the fruit due to sweetness."
"3","5","Yum! Made this this a.m. and it's gone already! Loved it, loved it, loved it! I did go half and half on the fruit, I used rhubarb my neighbor gave me and apples. Other than that I did some minimal changes per the reviews I'd read.  1. I doubled the topping and put it in the bottom of the pan and the rest on top of the fruit mixture. 2. I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsps. 3. I also added Cardamon spice, since I was out of fresh nutmeg - and boy was I glad I did - NUM! 4. I crumbled the butter into the topping instead of melting & pouring on top. - I liked the results BUT - that meant that some of the mixture on top remained/looked dry and unbaked. I sprayed oil olive oil on top when almost done - that helped... but I think I'll consider melting the butter the next time as per the recipe. I don't think I changed the recipe too much and when I did, it was just due to our family's preference. I know for sure that made exactly as the recipe was written that we would have enjoyed it just as much - Thanks, Chef!!"
"3","5","Oh my goodness! This was so good! I just made it and almost burned my face off eating it because I couldn't wait for it to cool! I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the topping mixture. The water in the recipe made a yummy caramel like sauce because i greased the pan liberally with butter. Make this. And watch those faces because you wont be able to wait for it to cool past the volcanic stage!!!!!!!"
"3","2","way too sweet and too much butter."
"3","4","Spectacular taste... not so healthy though."
"3","5","This was SO GOOD! I am usually not a big apple pie/crumble fan, but this was amazing! I had a bunch of apples that I had to use up - an assortment of red delish, pink ladies, galas. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and tossed that with the cinnamon and 1 T of flour and a squeeze of lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown. I let that sit for about 15 min, and when I was ready to use I did not need to add any water. I doubled the oat crumble mixture (used a little more cinnamon and a couple of dashes of nutmeg) and put 1/2 on the bottom and the other 1/2 on the top. I also added 1/2 cup of sliced raw almonds to the top and mixed that with the crumble. Served it with vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! Our tummies are happy tonight. :)"
"3","5","Perfect as is. I just halved the water as others have mentioned, and it is wonderful. Used Granny Smith apples."
"3","5","Easy and delicious. I did cut the sugar just a little bit and it was just right with a blend of sweet and slightly tart apples; all a matter of personal taste. Mixed the flour/sugar with the apples and didn't add any water as our apples were very juicy."
"3","5","I made this today for my daughter's Thanksgiving celebration in first grade and boy is it delicious! I only put in 1/4 cup of water because I let the apples (which were mcintosh, the only ones I had) macerate in the sugar cinnamon mixture for a little bit while I made the topping, which I doubled. I also added some nutmeg and probably used more cinnamon then the recipe said. But I put it in a 9X13 pan and it turned out PERFECT! I then spooned it into 23 individual little plastic cups and I'll top it with whipped cream tomorrow. Wonderful recipe!"
"3","5","Some of the best apple crisp myself and my guests had ever tasted!"
"3","5","This recipe is GREAT!! Everyone loved it! I used apples from our tree which are sweet so I added only 2 tbs of white sugar instead of 1 cup and it was perfect. Everything else I made as the recipe called for, even the 1 cup of brown sugar for the topping. Right out of the oven, it was runny on the bottom but after letting it sit until it cooled down, the water soaked in and was not runny at all. This is the apple crisp recipe I will use from now on."
"3","4","I unfortunately read the reviews that talked about doubling the topping. Heavens, no! It was topping overkill. Do it as written; do NOT double the topping unless you want to eat only topping. Isn't the point to taste the apples?"
"3","5","MMM-MMM! I used 5 Granny Smith's and 3 Pink Ladies (I think). I did 1.5 times the crust. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the crust ingredients and cut in my cold butter, rather then melting it. (My husband is eating his right now and all I'm hearing is 'MMMM'.) I tossed my cut up apples with the cinnamon sugar mixture, to which I had added a little bit of nutmeg. I layered about 1/3 of the crust mixture in the pan and then put in my apples with about 1/4 cup of water. Then I topped with the rest of the crust. Baked it according to the recipe. When I served it, I topped it with some warmed caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. Man, writing this makes me want to go get another bowl of it!!! Awesome recipe!"
"3","4","Used 1/4 c. of water and added some freshly ground nutmeg to the apples. Left out the baking soda and baking powder, increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups and used 1 cup of melted butter. I know...not exactly low calorie but it's dessert, might as well go all out!!!"
"3","4","If I make this again I WILL NOT double the topping. I listened to the reviews and doubled the topping and it was TOO MUCH. I did leave the water out and would do that again. I don't think water is needed. Also I would reduce the sugar to 1/2 C...it was too sweet for me. But overall was a good recipe."
"3","5","I have been making apple crisp for 7 years based on my mother-in-law's great recipe. In our last move, I lost the recipe (and suffer from a terrible memory). I searched for a version similar to hers, but when I saw this recipe I decided I would try this instead. My husband said this was the best apple crisp I had ever made.   Personally, I loved the melted butter idea instead of cutting cold butter in like I used to do. I also put it in an (roughly) 8x8 baking pan so the apples were thick. That also made the topping thick, almost like a crust, but I loved that. I don't usually eat apple crisp either.   I didn't add any water, just added juice from a lime since the apples were browning very quickly and that's all I had on hand. We used Jonathan apples (about 8 medium sized) because that's what we picked last week. I cut the apples thick so they wouldn't turn to mush. We used about 1 tsp Pumpkin pie spice in the oatmeal topping because my 3 year old wanted to add it (really, no other reason than that, haha). It was juicy and the apples were cooked to perfection (about 45 min baking time). The topping was crunchy and perfect. Thank you!!!"
"3","5","This was seriously THE most amazing crisp I have ever had. When I read the ingredient list I thought it would be your pretty standard crisp, but this makes a caramelized 'sauce' in the apple layer that is to DIE for."
"3","5","This was sooo delicious. I used 6 cups of apples and it still made quite a lot. I also used Royal Gala apples and they came out fantastic, they still had enough crunch to them when they came out..just the right amount! I used a bit less white sugar on them, and also tossed them with nutmeg added to the mixture. The crumble came out perfect too, also just crunchy enough. I only had normal oats, not quick-cooking ones, and those were fine. I also doubled the amount of crumble, which seemed to give just the right amount."
"3","5","This is so good. What a great recipe. I will be making this one again"
"3","5","I didnt actually have the oats on hand, so I used the same measurement of oatmeal cookie mix (Betty Crocker) and it is AMAZING!!!! Absolutely delicious!! I also cut the water to 1/4 cup and it made a nice thick sauce that was great over icecream!! Thanks for posting such a great recipe!!!"
"3","5","Great taste, Not too sweet. I did not have any oats but I did have Oat Bran flakes. The finer texture of the Oat Bran worked out great."
"3","5","SO GOOD!! I used granny smith apples and ate it with vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","I made this recipe for a Mother's Day picnic and it was a hit. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the topping recipe, eliminated the water, and cut the sugar in half. It was so good I have another pan in the oven to have for today. Try this recipe and you won't be disappointed!!"
"3","1","I dont like this recipt at all it is very bland. I would certainly prefer a homemade apple pie over this recipt any day!!"
"3","5","It was my first time making an apple crisp...and this recipe was delicious...especially served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! I took some of the suggestions that other reviewers made such as reducing the sugar in the apple mix to 1/2 cup, adding ground nutmeg, doubling the topping recipe and adding chopped walnuts to the topping. Highly recommended!!"
"3","5","Delicious.  I added blackberries and because they get really juicy when baked, I increased the flour to 2 tbsp.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was a big hit and I will be making this again without a doubt."
"3","5","WOW. Turned out amazing with NO alterations - this is now my 'go-to' apple dessert recipe. Thank you for sharing!"
"3","5","First time making apple crisp and this recipe was really good. Next time I would also cut the water in half as there was alot of fluid in bottom upon serving. Thank you."
"3","5","Wow,wow, and more wow! I made dessert for two so I used a pie pan instead of the recommended dish. I used the suggested amounts for the crust, which perfectly doubled the amount allowing for a top and BOTTOM crust. I had the nerve to add pecans and walnuts! Three apples worked perfectly and I halfed the ingredients for sprinkling over the apples. I omitted the water and used butter. Deeeeeeelish!"
"3","5","Delicious! I did make some changes to fit in with my diet such as I used almond flour in place of the flour and I used Stevia in place of the sugar (just used about 6 TBSP, but I also made the recipe for only 6 people). I also added some Craisins and nutmeg, doubled the 'crisp' portion, and cut the water in half like others recommended. Turned out great!"
"3","5","Excellent! And glad someone stressed Granny Smith apples, made all the difference. Great recipe!"
"3","5","Wonderful Apple Crisp! Followed recipe, made no changes. Used Granny Smith apples (3lb. bag, med. size). Amazing!"
"3","5","Too bad there isn't an option for six stars. Need I say more?"
"3","5","This was such a simple recipe that turned out AMAZING!! I used Splenda products in place of the sugar and brown sugar and neither me nor the family members who ate this at Christmas dinner could tell that it was sugar free! Next time, I will add more oats, as I like the texture. Otherwise - Perfect recipe!"
"3","3","This recipe was just ok. I always like to try and stick to the original the first time I make somthing (unless reviews are consistently pointing out one mistake). I should have listened to those who decreased the water. The apples were way too soggy for my liking. The topping was not oaty enough and it it was overly sweet. I will keep the recipe though as it it a good jumping off point to alter."
"3","5","This is a fabulous recipe. Everyone loved it."
"3","3","Not too bad, but I found even after cutting back the sugar to half cup, it was still too sweet for me. It definitely paired well with vanilla ice cream and that helped to mellow out the sweetness too!"
"3","5","Love this apple crisp recipe! Have made it twice now and it was a hit both times. I use 6 green golden delicious apples and the flavor is wonderful. I will probably experiment with different flavored apples in the future."
"3","4","The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is due to others' reviews I modified this recipe by doubling the topping and adding nutmeg as suggested. I also put a thin layer of the topping in the bottom of the pan before adding the apples. I also cut in the butter rather than using it melted. The topping was very firm, but not hard. Just right! This made the most wonderful dessert and it is going into the permanent file!"
"3","5","good recipe. My apples happened to be a little dry(been sitting around a while,) but since I had some apple cider in the fridge, I added some to the apples before baking to sort of reconstitute them."
"3","4","I halved the top 5 ingredients and added extra butter to the crumble."
"3","5","In the apples I used 1/2c brown sugar, and 1/4 cup sugar, heaping t. of cinnamon, and dash of nutmeg. Also, apple juice instead of water. The top I used 1 1/2 cups each flour and oatmeal, heaping cup of brown sugar and 1/4 plus 1/8 each soda and baking powder...EXCELLENT!!"
"3","5","My family LOVED this. I made it exactly as shown and it turned out wonderful. I recommend Granny Smith apples for this recipe. This is the dessert that was requested for Thanksgiving dinner."
"3","5","Yum, yum, YUM! I had a ton of apples left from our trip to the u-pick orchard, so instead of water, I put two apples into the juicer and poured that over the apples. I also cut the sugar in half and used sweeter apples, and it turned out just divine!"
"3","5","This dish was outstanding . My only change was using 3/4 cup of the white and the brown sugar."
"3","2","I reduced the sugar per other comments and this was still so overly sweet that it was inedible. We scraped off all of the topping and mixed the apples in with unsweetened apples to salvage this."
"3","5","Great recipe--it turned out perfect! I cut the recipe in half, using 3 very large Granny Smith apples. I also omitted the water (per other reviews), cut the white sugar in half, and used slightly less than 1/2 cup of flour in the topping, with 5 Tbsp cold butter cut into the mixture, instead of melting it. I used a 8 x 6 inch glass baking dish and added on about 7 minutes of cooking time, as it wasn't golden brown when the 45 minutes of baking was up. The apples were fork-tender, not mushy and the crust was cripsy, giving it the perfect contrast in texture."
"3","5","I omitted the H2O as other suggested. Also added 1/2 tsp alspice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Did not melt the butter but cut it in. Repeatable"
"3","5","Awesome!! Followed reviewer's advice and cut in cold butter instead of melting it for the crust, which was lovely -- definitely gives it the texture you're looking for in a crisp. I also doubled the crust, putting apple layer in between, which is yummy but also very very rich, so it's probably not for everyone. It's a little much for me, and I love rich stuff! The only change I think is important to the recipe is the cold butter, but I'm sure it's delicious no matter what. :)"
"3","5","YUM! That's all I have to say. I didn't make any adjustments at all - it was perfect just as described in the recipe. This is MUCH better the day you bake it, the crust starts to get soggy if it sits too long - best to eat it all right away."
"3","5","Awesome. Everyone at worked loved it!"
"3","5","Incredible! I will always use this recipe when making apple crisp! I doubled the topping as suggested by others & also added a little nutmeg."
"3","5","First time making Apple Crisp and it was delicious!! I used 5 Honey Crisp apples and put it in an 8 x 8. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tbsp of water. It was amazing!! The topping is the best part. Yum!"
"3","5","Really great! Used 5 Granny Smith apples, and the whole recipe didn't take long at all, for a very delicious outcome. The whole house smelled wonderful. Followed the recipe as shown, just added a little nutmeg into the apple topping. Also, it seems a tad bit watery to me, but my boyfriend says it's fine to him, so it's just a matter of preference. Delicious recipe though!"
"3","5","This is the best apple crisp I've ever made. It is easy and tastes great! I only had about 7 cups of apples and I did not add any water. It turned out great! I am very pleased and I will definitely be making this recipe again."
"3","5","OH MY!!! Apple crisp is my ALL TIME FAVORITE dessert ever and after years of searching for just the right recipe to make at home, THIS IS IT! I made it in a 9x9 pan with 1/2 the apple mixture, using 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar. I used the full crust mixture as suggested by other reviewers. Definitely need to use Granny smith or other tart firm apples as the mixture is plenty sweet. Also did not use the water. Unfortunately the only thing I was missing was some good quality vanilla ice cream to melt on top! I just might have to go out and buy some to go with my second (and maybe 3rd!) serving!"
"3","5","Even with my healthy changes, this dessert was a hit! I used Splenda in place of the white sugar and whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose. No one was the wiser. ;) Might benefit from extra apples."
"3","4","Very good apple crisp recipe! The topping is nice and crisp. I used 12 small/medium apples and used only 2/3 cup of the white sugar called for, and it tasted great! I've actually used the recipe for this topping to fix some of my other recipes that haven't turned out good. This is a go-to recipe for sure!"
"3","5","This is fabulous! I followed a couple of the other reviews and added nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup water. I also used about 12 cups of apples and doubled the crumble part (it's my favorite part). Also used softened butter and cut it in like you would with pastry instead of the melted butter. Turned out great!"
"3","4","I made this recipe using local apples (Cortland variety) and brought it to work. It was gone by the end of the day so I guess it was good. I just thought a cup of sugar was way too much for the apple mix so I added maybe 1/4 cup, and I added a tsp of nutmeg which was probably too much. The topping was good but didn't really crisp up even though I left it in the oven for 20 minutes longer at 375 degrees. But overall it was good."
"3","5","Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to double the crust recipe. It turned out great! I used Granny Smith apples and it had the perfect combination of tart and sweet. Love it and will definitely make again and again!"
"3","5","This was truly amazing. I found it to be a bit watery when all was said and done, but I just drained the water and no harm done! Highly recommend it."
"3","5","This apple crisp is delicious. My version didn't look as pretty as the above picture, but with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - who cares?!. I have never been successful at making apple pies, so I'm glad there are easy apple crisp recipes like this to make me look like a hero to my family. Thanks Diane!"
"3","5","Double the crust - but only 50% more on the butter instead of double."
"3","1","Our large family did not like this recipe. It was far too sweet. I liked the idea of a little syrup forming with it but we just couldn't eat it. I'm going back to Mom's old Betty Crocker recipe."
"3","2","I didn't care for this. WAY too sweet for my taste (I did use red apples, but I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup white and brown). It also left a lot of liquid behind. I don't think the water is necessary."
"3","5","This is great! Don't add the water, and if you use anything other than granny smith apples, forget the white sugar completely. I cut the recipe in half to make 6 servings in a smaller pan, so I only cut the topping down by 1/4. Everyone loved it!"
"3","5","Super easy, yummy and needs no tweaking. It was a hit!"
"3","3","This recipe is way too sweet and not enough topping."
"3","4","Definitely dont use all the water. Way to watery! I dont know if I would use 1/4 cup. Loved the crisp topping! I added 1/4 t of nutmeg."
"3","5","Used gala apples and they were sweet and not sour - not meant for apple crisp but if you don't have a big sweet tooth like me, they were PERFECT ! 6 of us ate it all in one go lol"
"3","5","I cut this recipe down to 4 servings and it came out great! I used 4 ramekins and instead of sprinkling the sugar, flour, and cinnamon over the apples in each ramekin, I mixed it together with the apples first. Then I put about 1/2 TBSP of water into each ramekin before putting the crisp on top. Baked for 35 minutes and they came out PERFECTLY. My new recipe for any type of crisp. Thanks!"
"3","5","Very good recipie....I made this today for a pot luck & it was gobbled up very quickly. I made just a few changes per recomendations of previous reviews & was very happy with the results. Instead of using a whole cup of sugar I used 2/3 c, and did not use water as the apples will release juices anyways & I DOUBLED the entire crisp topping (kept the apple bottom mixture same)- glad I did. I got so many complements on this and that is a rare thing for my cooking!! It came out crisp, buttery & yummy- it was so rick I served it with cool whip- ice cream would have been way too heavy, the cool whip was creamy but light- a nice complement."
"3","5","This was so good, my husband and I Loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't find it watery at all. The water mixed in with the sugar while it baked and turned caramel-y. Delicious and it smelled so good while it was baking!!! Will definitely make again:)"
"3","5","This recipe was amazing!! It is so simple and just delish!!! The only thing i changed was that instead of a half cup of water i used 1/3 Cup....it turned out perfect!!"
"3","5","Yummy! I used sour apples and it needed the full amount of sugar, in my opinion. I put half the amount of water in and it didn't really need it. Don't think I would change anything else--it was great!"
"3","5","WONDERFUL! I made additional topping (because I am excessive!) and it was AMAZING. I will never look for another recipe! I topped it with homemade vanilla whipped cream with was a great compliment. If your wondering: I filled up the large magic bullet container (which will whip cream in 15 sec GUARANTEED!!!) with heavy whipping cream, added a couple of Tbsp powdered sugar and a splash or vanilla and whipped it up. It was great! Husband loved it!"
"3","5","Very, very, very delicious. This was my first ever crisp/crumble and it was so good. I took the advice of another and added pecans to the topping and it is now an irresistible treat! I also doubled the topping for a 9x12 but personally found it to be way too much. It was twice as much topping to apple and I didn't even use it all. That aside it is lovely and will be made again and again and again....."
"3","5","AWESOME!!! Very adaptable for those going organic too. I used organic apples, organic sugar, whole wheat flour, and all natural oats. I've made this several times and it's a hit with everyone! Like other reviews, I doubled the cinnamon, added nutmet and doubled the topping."
"3","5","BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST APPLE CRISP EVER!!!!!!!!!!! I DIDNT PUT WATER, AND IT WAS MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER!!!!!! DELICIOUS! I LOVE IT, TASTE GOOD WARM! I LOVE IT! I AM 14 AND I MADE THIS! IT WAS EASY, AMAZING AND I WILL DEF DO IT AGAIN!!! WORTH THE TIME OF MAKING! DELICIOUS!"
"3","5","Scrumptious! I chopped the apples instead of slicing. We wanted them chunky, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely yummy. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","This is the recipe I'll always use from now on. I decreased the water to 1/4 cup and added 1 cup chopped pecans because I had them on hand - with or without them, it's a delicious Apple Crisp. I served it warm with with vanilla bean ice cream ala' mode - scrumptious!!!!"
"3","4","very tasty"
"3","4","This was delicious, but the water made it far runnier than I've ever eaten a 'crisp'. Next time I will definitely leave that out."
"3","5","You can't go wrong with this apple crisp. Absolutely delicious."
"3","5","This is an excellent recipe and will definitely use it again. The only changes I made were, 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a full cup, and used old fashioned oatmeal because that's what I had. Absolutely delicious!"
"3","5","ONLY REAL CHANGE I MADE WAS THAT I USED JARRED APPLE HALVES TO CUT DOWN PREP & COOK TIME BUT WORKED PERFECTLY! note: WATER IS NOT NEEDED W/READY TO COOK/EAT APPLES*"
"3","3","this one is just okay"
"3","3","I made this for Thanksgiving and whoa that's a lot of sugar! I like the juxtaposition of sweet and tart, so this time I cut the white sugar in half and increased the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp. Much better! And with 1 stick of vegan Earth Balance instead of butter and whole wheat flour, it's a wee bit healther. Not much, a little."
"3","5","This was really good. Everybody that tried it really liked it, awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","I needed a last minute recipe for Thanksgiving desert and I always order Apple Crisp when they have it at restaurants. This came out absolutely perfect, follow the recipe exactly EXCEPT A FEW THINGS : 1.Add a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmug to the cinnamon mixture. 2.Coat the apples in the cinnamon mixture and then put them in the baking dish, then you don't need to add any water and I promise its perfectly moist. 3. Double the topping mixture I promise if you follow this it is absolutely restaurant quality."
"3","3","Everybody is giving this 5 stars but nobody is making it according to the recipe, how can you give something a top rating when you've altered it? The first time I made this it was bland and watery with not enough 'crisp' topping so the recipe as written gets only 3 stars from me. The second time I made this it turned out REALLY good! I omitted the water, decreased the white sugar by 1/2 and added nutmeg, allspice and clove along with the cinnamon in the apple mixture. I made almost double the amount of topping. In the end it was fantastic when I served with vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","This makes the best apple crisp I've ever had! I doubled the crust recipe though, because I like more crust. Two suggestions: I cut the butter into the crust and sprinkled chopped pecans onto the top. The toasted pecan taste really adds to the overall taste of the crisp. Also, if you mix the apples with the sugar/cinnamon before you put it in the pan, no water is necessary."
"3","5","I made this and I loved it. it was the best Apple Crisp I have ever had!"
"3","5","This received 6 thumbs up in our house. Very easy and delicious. You MUST serve with vanilla ice cream."
"3","4","this was very tasty! i would keep everything the same except i added nutmeg and the water was NOT needed. great keeper recipe!"
"3","5","Perfect. The only thing I did differently was to soak my apples in a bowl with water and a little lemon juice, to prevent browning while I chopped the remaining apples. When done chopping, I just drained the water out, mixed it with the sugar and cinnamon/nutmeg, and dumped it into the baking dish. With this extra moisture, I didn't need to add any water, and the resulting sauce was heavenly! Served warm with a scoop of ice cream, YUM. So easy, and my husband said (twice!) it was better than any restaurant. :)"
"3","5","this is an excellent recipe! A couple things to mention though... I used probably about 1/4 cup of water and it still ended up pretty watery when it came out, so water is probably not needed. I added more cinnamon and mixed the apples in the mixture instead of just sprinkling it over. And for the crumble part, I used margarine instead of butter and it ended up being too much, so make sure to add a little bit at a time until it's crumbly. Otherwise, great recipe!"
"3","5","This is an excellent recipe. The only modification I made was to add a bit of nutmeg and ground cloves to the topping with a bit more cinnamon. We were only 5 people, but we finished this off. It was fantastic. I used fresh from the orchard Cortland apples and fresh ground cinnamon. I have never added water to a crisp before, but it was just right. The sauce was really nice. Thanks for a great recipe."
"3","4","I made this as written, to begin with. I used 6 Granny Smith apples to make up the 10 cups, sliced fairly thickly. I found the water to make too much juice. Next time I'd halve it or omit it altogether. After I'd made everything, I found there wasn't quite enough topping to make a respectable apple crisp, so I whipped up another batch of topping. Also, even though I used Granny Smiths, I found the recipe too sweet. Perhaps this was due to the doubled crisp topping. If you are going to double the topping, consider halving the white sugar in the apple mix. Finally, even though I sliced my apples fairly thickly, they still came out very soft after 45 minutes. I like a little bite to my crisp, so next time won't cook it so long. It's a tasty recipe - just play around with it. A little extra cinnamon, perhaps some cloves or nutmeg..."
"3","5","Excellent recipe - It's now in my family recipe file! I used a Pampered Chef apple peeler/corer to save on time and effort of peeling so many apples. Made it even easier!"
"3","5","didnt change a thing. made the recipe 8 times today and yummy everytime"
"3","5","OMG! This is amazing. I followed most other reviews and doubled the topping. I also added 1/2tsp of nutmeg to the apples. I didn't add any water because my apples slices had been sitting in water with lemon juice while dinner was cooking and the water left on the apples after draining was plenty. I will be making this on a regular basis."
"3","5","Fantastic recipe! I had never made apple crisp before, and this recipe was very easy to follow and replicate. I halved the recipe (except for the topping) and made it in an 8x8. I left out the water, and it was not at all dry. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing apple crisp recipe."
"3","5","easy and delicious!"
"3","5","I used to make apple crisp all the time and then one day my boyfriend decided to make it for me. He stumbled across this recipe and it was the best we had ever had. It's a keeper!!"
"3","5","I made this as directed but lessened the white sugar to half a cup. It was still delicious and very sweet! I think next time I'll also halve the brown sugar. Some reviews recommended doubling the topping. I did not find this neccessary at all, there was plenty of topping! It tastes like a combination of warm apple pie and sweet oatmeal cookies on top, delicious!"
"3","5","This was delicious and very easy to make. I did what other had suggested, used only 1/2 cup of the white sugar and omitted the water. Then I added a handful (literally) of extra oats for a bit more texture. Came out perfect. I used the Northern Spy apple."
"3","5","Yum! Great apple crisp recipe. Nothing out of the ordinary though. I like the baking soda/powder that makes the 'crisp' more than just a streusel like topping. I used just 1/4 cup of water, like suggested I think next time, I will probably use lemon juice instead of the water, just for a little lemon flavor that I like."
"3","5","Fantastic! Sometimes I even make a double recipe of the topping and put it on the bottom like a crust. Yummy!!!! Way easier than apple pie and tastier too."
"3","5","I made it for a local Fire Satation......all the men looooved it! It's a great crisp! Definitely cut the water down to 1/3 cup....was perfect. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added a dash of nutmeg.....made all the difference. Also....if the crisp part is your favorite, like mine, double the dry recipe and use about 1/3 to line the bottom of the pan.....the rest on top. I cut in the butter rather than using melted butter......seemed to give it a better texture. It was very crispy and just the right amount. I used Granny Smith apples and they were the perfect compliment for the sweet crisp. Was super delish and I will be making it again....soon!"
"3","5","I have made this a couple of times. It tastes wonderful. One time I tried cornstarch with the apples and the result was very soupy. So we stick exactly to the recipe now."
"3","5","VERY Good. Followed this recipe exactly... I used a variety of apples, not just 'baking apples', and it seemed to work just fine. Didn't add any water, but did coat the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and put in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the apples 'marinate' a bit. Would make this again!"
"3","5","This is some of the best apple crisp I've ever had! The only modifications I made was to coat the apples with the sugar mixture instead of sprinkling it on top and I used margarine instead of butter. I've also experimented a bit with the water. The first time I made it, I tried 1/4 cup based on the reviews on here. It was quite watery, but still delicious and it didn't ruin it or anything. This time I only added 1/8 cup, and it was still too runny. Next time, I'll just omit the water. Absolutely fabulous recipe- I used Granny Smith apples and they worked perfectly. Delicious!"
"3","5","awesom dish...my whole family loved it"
"3","5","Delicious...although I would cut the water down next time. It got a bit runny, which doesn't look so appetizing. The crumble topping was very sweet and tasty. Bible study ladies liked it & I love that this makes a 9 x 13 size. Enough to serve with plenty of leftovers! Definitely the best warm and a la mode! 9/23/11 Made this again. Eliminated the water completely & doubled the topping. SO amazing...they were all asking for the recipe!"
"3","5","I recently made this for a dinner party I attended. Everyone LOVED it and requested copies of the recipe. I took the reviews and advice from previous users by doubling the crisp recipe and placed about 30% on the bottom and threw the rest on the top. Added a 1/4 cup of water to the bottom and added nutmeg to the mixture. I used by Pampered Chef apple slicer/corer which left the apples a decent size and perfect size to bake the whole way through and not be mushy as an end product. The Best Ever!"
"3","5","Best apple crisp I've ever had! This was my first time to make it too. I made it almost like the recipe. I used orange juice instead of water and doubled the topping. Some people recommended less liquid for the sauce. I would only use less liquid if you plan on reducing the amount of sugar since the sugar makes the sauce thicken. Also would recommend mixing together the ingredients for the sauce before pouring over the apples. I doubled the topping only because it's my favorite part. The original amount is enough if you don't prefer more crunch. I used granny smith apples and they were a little too tart for me. Next time I will make it with mutsu apples from the orchard."
"3","5","So yummy! I doubled the crisp part because I really like that part and it was soooo good and crunchy. Thank you."
"3","5","This recipe, as is, no modifications is a 5 star! This is absolutely the best apple crisp out there. (Better than any restaurant and better than your grandma's)! However, I have my own taste preferences and would like to note I have made this recipe quite a few times. The last time I made it I added some rhubarb (unsweetened) from the freezer isle at the store. I am always going to make it that way because it adds more nutritional value and I love that tart taste. Hands down DELICIOUS as is though! BY THE WAY, I have cut the sugar like others have suggested and it really depends on the apples that you use for it. If you are using sweet apples cutting the sugar is fine. However if you are using plain ol baking apples I would recommend to follow this recipe precisely and you won't go wrong here. Also do not add pumpkin pie or all spice or nutmeg, it makes the flavor spicy and way too aromatic for apple crisp!!"
"3","4","I followed this recipe EXACTLY. I think it would be absolutely excellent without the water. There is no need for water as the apple crisp was soupy even the next day. Leave the water out and it will be great!"
"3","4","If your sweetness preference is like having coffee with 'regular' amount of sugar, this recipe will be too sweet for you. So many people said to leave out the water so I did. I used Granny Smith apples and let it cook 1 hr because it didnt look brown enough. The texture and flavor was wonderful! The oats really add a great crunch. Will def. make again!"
"3","5","Made this tonight and as others have said, it was fabulous. I followed the recipe except after peeling and slicing my apples, I squeezed the juice of a whole lemon over them and tossed to coat; I added a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients to bring out the flavors and I omitted the water from the recipe. The natural juices from the apples and lemon lend enough liquid to the recipe to turn out sweet, crisp, and delicious. My search for an excellent apple crisp recipe is over!!"
"3","5","LOVED IT! I halved the recipe the other night for my family of 4 and it was just enough and I even had a little late night snack. It did seem a little runny, but after it set up for a few minutes it thickened up. Thanks for a good recipe."
"3","4","Really good basic apple crisp recipe. I used a mixture of Macintosh and Granny Smith apples. I tossed the apples together in a bowl with sugar, flour, cinnamon, a few dashes of nutmeg, and ONLY two tablespoons of water instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe called for. I set the apples to the side while I mixed the crumble and they produced plenty of their own juice. I did double the crumble top based on suggestions from other reviewers. The apples were perfectly cooked and made just enough juice to have a nice thick syrup, but, not be too watery. I served warm with french vanilla icecream and received a TON of compliments! Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","4","I did the apple portion first, but instead of sprinkling the sugar mixture I dumped it in a bowl (minus the water) and tossed my cut-up apples in there as I went along. This helped my apples to not brown. After tossing it all together I let it sit to the side while I prepared the topping. By the time everything was ready to go in the pan, the apples had combined with the sugar and created an awesome syrup, meaning I never needed to add water. If you prefer a more liquid-like dish then add a few Tablespoons of water. I also added nutmeg & cloves to both apples and topping and it was perfect!"
"3","4","This reminded me of 'All you can eat buffet' apple crisp, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. My man loved it, but it was wayyyyy to sweet for me. I wouldn't make this again."
"3","5","Delicious. It was kind of heavy. But I'm not a great cook, so that could've been my error. I loved it though!"
"3","5","So very delicious and super simple. I did double the crumble as some had suggested and had a little leftover. I served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","This was really easy and really good. The next time, I might cut back on the sugar just a tad...maybe 3/4 of a cup instead of a whole cup as it was just a little sweet but still really tasty. I used a 3 pound bag of Granny Smith apples. Will do this again for sure!"
"3","5","Perfect! I cut the amount of apples in half to make a 9 inch square pan but kept the same amount of topping as for 9x13 pan. This is a great classic recipe!"
"3","1","Terrible! We followed the directions for the most part, taking into account other's recommendations of limiting water and doubling the crust but were thoroughly disappointed. When removed from the oven we had to shovel off an inch of uncooked dried crust. Then soaked the top layer in shots of spiced rum to moisten it up. It gave it the perfect kick to a college's students attempt at baking. Overall, the recipe was a failure."
"3","5","Delicious as is."
"3","5","After reading many reviews, I left out the water, doubled the topping, added 1/4 t of nutmeg and tossed the apples with the sugar mixture. I will stick to the original amount of topping next time. The apples seemed to disappear under everything else. I didn't find the dish too sweet because I used granny smith apples. It took almost 3 lbs to get 10 cups worth."
"3","5","Fantastic. I have been looking for a great apple crisp recipe and have found it here. Simple to make and was a great hit with the family. As suggested by others I did not add the water. I also added vanilla to the apples and crumble."
"3","5","This apple crisp is AWESOME!!!! I doubled the topping as recomended and it came out perfect. I used Mcintosh and cortland apples that my daughter and I picked."
"3","5","Wonderfully delicious, however, you have to know your apples. I used my home-grown green apples that are NOT tart, Nor are they sweet and my Apple Crisp turned out way too sweet, I have since made this many times over with less sugar and substituted fresh squeezed lemon juice for the water, which I poured over the sliced apples in the pan and stirred by hand. I only used 3/4 cup white sugar in the sugar cinnamon mixture and poured that on top of the apples after the step with the lemon juice. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!"
"3","5","Oh! What a treat. I scaled the recipe down because I didn't have all of the apples that the full recipe required. I did use the water (only 1/4c) and found it was perfectly moist. Top with vanilla icecream and its the perfect winter comofort food. PS-next time I will add fresh ginger."
"3","5","I made this for a cookout a few weeks ago, and my friends are still talking about it, and asking when I'm going to make it again! It's great if you make it exactly by the recipe, which I did the first time, but I've actually made it several times and this last time I think it was perfect with these changes: I use 5 large granny smith apples (the green ones), sliced as thiny as possible, the thinner the better. A 1/2 cup sugar is plenty, and only a quarter cup of water is needed too, but still use all the flour and cinnamon. I also added a dash of nutmeg. For the topping, I did double it once and I thought it was wayyyyy too much. Stick to the recipe on the topping and you'll be happy, but if you have a pastry blender, definitely use softened butter instead of melted and cut it into the other ingredients."
"3","5","This was absolutely delicious! At first, I was a little hesitant before adding all that sugar. I didn't have to be though, as the crisp turned out to be perfect! I wouldn't alter this recipe at all. I give it five stars. Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","WOW, what an excellent recipe!! I did however use some of the suggestions I read in the other reviews. I did reduce the water in half and made double the topping. I also used more cinnamon (1 tbsp instead of 1 tsp). I read that some people preferred softened butter versus melted. I went with the melted as stated in the recipe and I think its great!! I served it warm with some vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!!!! This is the best I have ever had!!"
"3","5","I made this to serve 50, and it recieved rave reviews from everyone! Even people who didn't traditionally like Apple Crisp liked this. I didn't make any changes, it was fabulous as it was! Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe I have come across. I use Granny Smiths or Macintosh apples. Have been making this for some time and always gets rave reviews. Thank you!"
"3","5","Fantastic! After peeling the apples I placed them in water with a few squirts of lemon juice to prevent browning. After draining and chopping them all up, I poured the sugar mix (with only about 3/4 cup sugar) over them in a bowl and shook it all up. I followed others' suggestions and added about a half tsp of nutmeg to the apple sugar mix. I left out the water since the apples were juicy. I let that mix sit while I made the topping (which I doubled and pressed about 1/3 of it onto the bottom of the pan). I cooked the whole thing for an hour. This recipe came our so amazing, my boyfriend and even my dad who's not too into sweets ate it up! This is definitely a keeper. We served it with vanilla ice cream, of course. :) Oh yes, and I cut in cold butter while blending the topping in the food processor instead of melting it."
"3","4","This recipe was so easy and so yummy. I added 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 as some reviewers suggested. I doubled the topping and put half in pan, then added apples - sugar mixture and the rest of the topping. I used 2 honeycrisp apples, 2 figi apples and 2 granny smith apples because that is what I had. I baked it longer. This turned out Wonderful !!! My Husband Loved it - He said it was the Best he has ever had - I liked it with Ice cream - YUMMY !!!!!"
"3","5","It turned out great! I did not reduce the water, but I did double the topping as others suggested. And I cooked it close to an hour so the topping could brown. My only creative change: cinnamon roll instant oatmeal in place of the quick oats! I used 4 packs and it worked out beautifully in this recipe."
"3","5","This was absolutely delicious!! I coated the apples in the cinnamon and sugar as suggested by another reviewer. This dessert was the bomb! My husband and I ate the whole thing in one night..lol! Thank you so much for this recipe...I will be making this quite often!"
"3","5","This was a very good recipe! The topping was absolutely amazing and I could have eaten a whole batch of just that over ice cream...it was delicious! Thanks, this is a keeper."
"3","5","This is my favorite apple crisp recipe. I usually use 3/4 cup the sugar amount or less, as I don't need it that sweet. (This is with McIntosh apples, if using Granny Smith or a mix, you may want more sugar.) Personally, I NEVER cook with any artificial sweetners. I prefer using the sweetner God gave us = honey. Or, the least refined sugar out there = evaporated cane juice. (I buy this in bulk at my local health food store.) You can use the latter without any recipe exchange. It's always in my sugar bowl."
"3","4","I made this recipe this past weekend to take to my parents for dinner. It was delicious- everyone loved it. The only thing I didnt do was add any nutmeg as some reviewers said to. I also read one of the reviews said to double the crisp and lay some on the bottom and some on the top- I think that would make it better. Also, it was delicious but not crispy, I'm not sure what to add to make it more crisp."
"3","4","Yummy recipe. Even better with whipped cream on top! I used Granny Smith apples which were a little sour and tasted good to the adults but not so kid friendly. Maybe a slight sweeter apple would work better for kids."
"3","5","Absolutely Perfect as is!!! I can't believe people doubled the topping mixture - that would be way too much for me. I followed this recipe exactly and it is the best apple crisp I have ever made! Great recipe!"
"3","5","This is my 3rd time making this dessert and to me, it's to die for!! The only thing I changed was I doubled the oats...Delicious!"
"3","5","The top is so yummy! We used plums from our tree and it turned out great!"
"3","5","This is by far the best apple crisp I've ever made! I ended up using 8 cups of apples because that's all I bought and it worked out great. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup because the apples are already sweet, and when you add ice cream to it b4 eating, that's enough sugar!! I also decreased water to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Absolutely delicious. It makes a huge pan so I can share with my coworkers!!"
"3","5","This is the BEST apple crisp I have ever made. I didn't change a thing and plan on making this recipe over and over. I used Granny Smith apples and boy was it good!"
"3","5","I've never made apple crisp. I followed the recommendations of adding nutmeg, using green apples, using half the white and brown sugar, adding half the water, and it turned out awesome. I will make this again very soon!"
"3","3","This recipe was alright. Major change I would do next time is use UNSALTED butter for the crumble instead of just regular butter. When it came out, it was a bit too salty for my taste."
"3","5","Soooooo.....ohhhh...soooo yummy!!!  I used half apples half blueberries, I had alot of berries that needed to be eaten, andI will never make apple crisp without blueberries, try it!! you won't be sorry, oh, and I also added some nutmeg."
"3","5","This is awesome. We had to many apples off of our tree and made these for our neighbors. They are still raving about it. note: Its just as good and less runny without the water."
"3","5","I have a fabulous apple crisp recipe that I've been using for years, but I was in the mood of a change. This one provides stiff competition, although it reminds me more of an upside down apple pie than a crunchy crisp. Following reviewers advice, I made the following changes: 1. In the flour mixture, I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added a dash of nutmeg. Then I mixed the mixture into the apples.  2. Cut the water in half. 3. Doubled the topping. With these changes, it's a delectable dish!"
"3","5","PERFECT!"
"3","5","Delicious but it's very sweet. I totally forgot to add the water and it still turned out fine. The recipe also made 2 pans. The topping is perfect!"
"3","5","Melt-in-your-mouth delicious topping! I doubled the topping amount and added half to the bottom like some reviewers suggested and I wouldn't have it any other way! The apples are runny so forget the extra water and I added an extra tablespoon of flour to my second crisp and it came out great. I also noticed that the cooking time isn't sufficient enough to soften my apples so I had to bake it 30 minutes or more longer. Other than that, this is the best apple crisp recipe ever!!! My family and I love it and will continue to use this recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","Great Recipe! One change though, instead of melting the butter I cut the cold butter in to the crumb mixture; it makes better 'crumb clusters.'"
"3","3","This was ok- it turned out a little dry for me and I like a little more crisp topping. I used apple juice in place of water and omitted the white sugar completely- there is no need for that much sugar. Just the brown was fine. It was plenty sweet. I had to bake it a lot longer than stated for the apples to get tender. I'm also wondering what the addition of baking soda and powder had to offer. I've made many crisps and never seen that before."
"3","4","It was a bit too sweet...next time I'll cut down on the sugar a bit and I think it will taste better...Also, you need to increase the topping on top...it wasn't enough..."
"3","5","I'm a caterer, and used this dessert twice in the last few weeks. Rave reviews!!! I cut the sugar in half, added nutmeg, left out the H2O,made 1 1/2 times the topping, and served it with Pumpkin Pie ice cream. Will make it again, and again, and again!!!"
"3","5","Loved this recipe! I left out the water as some other reviews suggested. Served warm, topped with vanilla ice cream....Heaven!"
"3","5","Yum! Turned out really well, awesome warm with vanilla ice cream. Baked it for a big crowd (doubled recipe) for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit."
"3","5","Excellent apple crisp! I used tart Michigan apples, Ida Red and Jonathan. Added cinnamon & nutmeg to the topping as well as apples. I did not use water and certainly didn't need any. Topping came out slightly crispy. This is a definite keeper!"
"3","1","I didn't like it at all, I used some of the things the other users suggested, I used less water and twice the topping. I will never make this again"
"3","5","This recipe was amazingly awesome. Based on previous reviews, I used Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples, doubled the topping, substituted Splenda for the sugar, and cut out the water entirely. I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg in with the cinnamon. Delicious!"
"3","5","GREAT! I omitted the water but did add a bit of blended pure maple syrup and apple juice."
"3","5","i only used 1/2 the sugar mixture & it was plenty sweet enough, any more would of been too sweet, crisp was excellent!!!"
"3","2","We were very dissapointed in this recipe. My husband said it should be called apple 'mushy', not apple crisp and I agree. I'll stick to my standard apple crisp recipe."
"3","5","I have been making apple crisp for about 40 years and this is the best recipe I have ever used. The only change that I made was to increase the cinnamon from a teaspoon to a tablespoon."
"3","5","This recipe is delicious, no wonder 700 people have rated it with a 5 star rating. Every time I make this dish for a party or get together, the company cannot believe how great it tastes. We normally serve it with vanilla ice cream YUM YUM!"
"3","5","Very good. Make sure the topping/crust ingredients are doubled, w/the exception of the oats, as I'm not the hugest fan of them. Instead of doubling the oats, I added an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar in it's place. I served french vanilla ice cream on top. Yum!"
"3","5","This recipe was easy and so delicious! I did add some extra spices (dash of cloves, nutmeg, and ground ginger) and some vanilla and brown sugar to the apples. It is not necessary to double the topping. I think it would be too much if you did that. I didn't have a problem with the apples getting mushy, but you will have that problem if you use an apple that is not meant for baking. Use Granny Smiths. They always work well for baking."
"3","5","This was really good and easy to make too, although I think I'll try just softening the butter instead of melting it. I like the topping more chunky. Great recipe though, my husband and I love it and I think I'll be making pretty often!"
"3","5","I've made this several times now and it is the best apple crisp I have ever made or tasted. I always get compliments on it and it is usually eaten too fast to keep left overs around. It is excellent warm with vanilla ice cream."
"3","4","This recipe turned out to be quite easy to make. I did omit the water, and it was a good idea because the juice from the apples and sugary syrup created a lot of liquid anyway. I would probably add more flour to the crumby topping, being as it was not as crumby/crispy on the top as I would have liked. It also turned out to be really rich and very sweet, so make sure you have a sweet tooth for this apple crisp. Over all, very good and it has made it into the 'make again' pile for me!"
"3","5","Due to my husband being diabetic I replaced the white sugar with Splenda. I also reduced the amount to 3/4 cup for the Splenda & also reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. We find there is no difference in taste."
"3","4","I rated this apple crisp 4 stars because I found that using 10 cups of apples was a bit too much apple. I also found it to be a tad too sweet for my taste. I will definitely make again, but using 6-7 cups of apples and I will cut down on the white sugar."
"3","4","Excellent, gets better as it sits for 45minutes or so."
"3","5","Great recipe. I made several of the changes suggested by other reviewers...some I agree with...some I don't. I agree with cutting back the water a bit. But, I'm not sure I would double the topping. I think I would do 1 1/2 times the topping next time. I like a bit more...but double was too much. I will definitely make this again!"
"3","5","I am rating it a 5-star based on comments from my husband and his co-workers (sweets aren't my thing). They said it was fabulous. Like others, I tweeked the recipe a bit. Added cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of ground cloves to the crumb mixture - which I doubled. Left the liquid for the apples (I used granny smith) as the recipe indicated. The water/sugar mixture made a light caramel sauce which my husband said was fantastic. Did not have ice cream, but the boys topped the crisp with half-n-half."
"3","5","Really really great... I only used half of the white sugar the recipe called for.. and just like when I make an apple pie, I always had a splash of vanilla and a little orange zest.. This recipe is definetly a keeper!!!"
"3","5","This was a big hit with my family. My 3 year old is the one who picked this to make...he loves to bake! Next time I make it (and I definately WILL!) I will cut the sugar down some. Maybe in half, actually. It was way too sweet after a few bites, but we don't eat much sugar so that could be why. Other than that, I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers and am so glad I did...that was the best part! Try this recipe, it's soooooo yummy! Good with ice cream, too."
"3","5","Yum! I cut the recipe in half (since it was just for me & my boyfriend)and shortened the baking time by about 15 mins. It turned out great!!"
"3","5","I never liked the apple part of any apple crisp and would only eat the crisp part. That was until I came across this recipe. My husband loved it! I did make some changes: 1) tossed Granny Smith apples in the white sugar-flour-cinnamon mixture, 2) eliminated the 1/2 cup water, 3) made 1.5x the crisp. UBBER GOOD!"
"3","4","This was great, but can't give it 5 stars since I altered the amount of sugar so much. I cut both sugars in half and it was very tasty. My husband even commented that he liked how he could taste the apples and it wasn't too sweet. Next time I will eliminate the water. That didn't seem to add anything and actually probably just made it too loose."
"3","5","This is the perfect recipe for apple crisp. I would recommend doubling the crumb topping if you like a big crunch. I also added even more oatmeal."
"3","5","Best apple crisp ever, as usual with a dessert recipe we cut the sugar by 1/4 and tripled the cinnamon and it was fine."
"3","5","This should be named apple crisp #1. For indeed it is. I make 1 1/2 times the crunchy topping. Creates many happy faces!"
"3","3","This was WAY too sweet - and even with putting fresh lemon juice over the apples, it was still too sweet. Next time I will use 1/2 the sugar (even with the lemon) and I would omit the water. The apples make enough of their own juice - water not required. Topping is very good!"
"3","5","Delicious recipe. I too doubled the topping recipe. I did not add any water (if I had it would have been way too runny) Be sure to peel the apples as the recipe recommends. I didn't & the peel gets tough in the cooking."
"3","5","Great reviews!!! I added pecans, raisins and a touch of dark jamaican rum to the apples."
"3","5","Was looking for a way to quickly use up apples that were on the verge of going bad and this recipe is a Godsend. It is excellent warm or cold and very easy to make. I even had all the ingredients on hand. I left out the water, substituted half the white sugar for brown in the filling, added a generous tsp. each of vanilla and lemon juice, and tossed the filling in a bowl to coat the apples beforehand and the texture was perfect."
"3","5","GREAT dessert!! Hold off on the water and add 1.5 cups of halved fresh cranberries for the holidays."
"3","5","This is an awesome recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white, 1/4 cup of water, and butter on the apples. The crisp is excellent and is my favorite part so I doubled it. EVERYONE loved it...will definitely make again."
"3","5","This was good. It was very much like the one I have been making for years. Don't add the water. Double the crust and you'll be good. Alittle more cinnamon too."
"3","5","I've tried so many other Apple Crisp recipes but this one takes the cake."
"3","5","Terrific recipe. Very kid-friendly, my little brother made it and it was delicious. We drizzled caramel on top before putting it in the oven which gave it a nice, crunchy texture in places."
"3","5","I gave my daughter a casserole dish for Christmas and made this apple crisp in the casserole the day before. It was a big hit! In spite of our huge Christmas dinner, the apple crisp was eaten up. We had whipped cream on top. Thanks for my big success."
"3","5","I made this recipe and it was fantasic. I used a different topping mix from another recipe and used the whole amount of water and doubled the cinnamon and flour, it was still had a little to much juice so I think I will reduce the water by 1/2 next time. The topping I always double. I used Johnatan Apples and the same amount of sugar. I didn't think it was too sweet. I have always loved apple crisp but the recipe I had always used was lacking something and thought the apples needed more flavor which this recipe definately does that. I will make this recipe from now on."
"3","5","This REALLY is a good recipe! I've made apple crisps so many times before, but had to try this to see what all the other reviewers were raving about. I used less sugar in the apples and it still came out delicious! Perfect crumbly crust, a no-fail recipe."
"3","4","This was very good. I would have given it 5 stars, but the water made it too juicy. Next time I would skip adding the water."
"3","5","This was delicious! I omitted the water, reduced the sugar overall and halved the apple part to put in an 8X8 pan. Kept the topping amount the same for that higher crisp to apple ratio. I might have to make it again this weekend!"
"3","5","I made this about a week ago because I have alot of extra apples. I used granny smith about 8 medium to large apples so more than 10 cups and I stirred all the ingredients except topping stuff into the apples. I used a little more cinnamon and a little nutmeg. I did not add the water!!! I put 1 1/2 times the topping on top. It turned out fantastic. This is the apple crisp recipe I will use from now on. I took some of it to my very picky male coworker and he also loved it."
"3","5","This was an excellent apple crisp, our family loved it. If you're using a 9x13 pan I would double the topping recipe otherwise the topping is very sparse across the top. I'm adding this to my recipe collection!"
"3","4","I thought this was a fantastic apple crisp recipe. Contrary to other reviews, I found that I had plenty of the topping and did not need to double it! In fact, I had more than I needed. Just shows how we all have varying opinions, so you just have to try it for yourself to find out what suits your needs! The ONLY thing I had to change was the 1 cup sugar which is sprinkled over the apples. I only used 1/3 cup and to us, that was plenty sweet. We used Rome apples which already have an average sweetness. I guess if you use Granny Smith or other tart apples than you may want the full 1 cup sugar. Otherwise......it was GREAT!!!!!!!"
"3","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe! I substituted two 21 ounce cans of apple pie filling for the first five ingredients. I also put 1/2 cup chopped pecans in the topping.It turned out great and my family loves it."
"3","5","Excellent, try using old-fashioned oats for a chewier topping."
"3","5","I made the recipe for 3 different holiday parties and it was a huge hit. I did do 1/2 on the water and 1/2 on both sugars like they suggested and that worked out well, one time I did 3/4 on the sugar and it was too much. In addition I added extra oats to the topping because I love them so much. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","So,so good. My husband raved. I doubled the topping and used the water. It was fabulous."
"3","5","Delicious. I read the other reviewers suggestions and double the topping (putting cinnamon in the topping also), decreased the white sugar by 1/2 and used 1/2 Jonathan & 1/2 Granny Smith apples. Took about 4 Grannys & 5 Jonathans. The pan was FULL. (Probably because of doubled topping.) Most people at Thanksgiving chose this topped with ice cream."
"3","5","Wow, is this delicious! Tastes like it should be a big deal to prepare, but the only thing that really takes any time at all is peeling & slicing the apples. I added 'craisins' (dried cranberries) to the apple mixture, and a little vanilla extract to the topping mixture. Thanks, Diane, for a great recipe!"
"3","5","THIS IS AWESOME! Most Delicious Apple Dessert we have tasted yet! Easy to make and sure to impress all of your Guests! A real Keeper! Thanks for sharing! Ginger"
"3","5","I've made NUMEROUS apple crisps.. waiting for the perfect one. THIS IS IT! Perfect blend of sweet and tart. YUMMY!"
"3","3","This was okay. I did enjoy the topping very much. However, I thought that there was not enough 'juice' from the apples. I did cut down on the amount of apples, too."
"3","5","This recipe was very delicious and easy to make. It actually tastes better the day after. I added a little bit more oatmeal-2Tbls, since we are big fans of it, and it made it even more heartier! Next time, I'm going to add some walnuts! ummmmm"
"3","5","This is a perfect Fall desert. Delicious. I did add the water, a little extra cinnamon and used one and one half tims for the topping. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Yummy!"
"3","5","this dessert is wonderfully good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or yogurt.when it was gone my boyfriend said he couldnt wait for me to make it again. he is very picky, so if he likes it you know its good!!!"
"3","5","This was extremely easy to make, and was delicious!"
"3","4","This was a great recipe. I read a few of the other reviews and I have to agree that the sweetness of the recipe was an issue. I would imagine that the sweetness seems to vary a lot, depending on what type of apples you end up using and your own personal preference. I used golden delicious apples, and the recipe was still not sweet enough for me. I served it with vanilla ice cream, and that worked out beautifully. So depending on the baker's particular preference, just be careful of the amount of sugar and the type of apple you use. I don't have a whole lot of experience baking with apples, so I'm still not good knowing a good balance between the natural sweetness of apples and the amount of sugar to add. All in all, I'd say this recipe is excellent, and very easy. And one must definetly eat it with ice cream!"
"3","5","Amazing!!! I was kind of iffy when I checked after 15 minutes, looked like it would be really dry, but after the full cooking time, it was wonderful. My family finished 3/4 of it the first night. I cut the amount of apples and cinnamon sugar topping by half, but left the oat topping at full (same result as doubling the topping). Tastes just like that at a restaurant I loved as a child."
"3","5","I could not wait to rate this recipe because this was the best apple crisp recipe ever. I made it twice I always make a recipe more then once so I can point out what I did wrong. The second time was awsome. The apple crisp melted in my mouth. For tips: Make sure that the apples you cut are not two thin if so when they are cooked they will lose some of their juices, and also make sure that you peel the apples real good and don't leave any part of the core tissue on your cut up apples if so when you reheat it later the core pieces on your apples become more tough. Also blend the mixture well with the melted butter that made a big difference when I made sure their were no lumps at all (use a hand blender on the lowest speed) Will become very moist."
"3","5","Absolutely wonderful recipe! I made it when friends came over, and it went over so well I was asked to make it again less than a week later!"
"3","5","Yummy! Goes great with fresh whipped cream, too."
"3","5","This apple crisp was delicious! It was very easy to make and my husband really enjoyed it. I used an Applemaster to peel, core and slice the apples, so it went together really quickly. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves apple crisp."
"3","5","I prepared this recipe with Granny Smith apples and it was wonderful. I took a pan to a 4th of July cookout and everyone enjoyed it. It took awhile to cut the apples but it's well worth the effort."
"3","5","Excellent dish for a large crowd. Even better with vanilla ice cream to accompany!"
"2","5","loved this! it was so good! i made a few changes... i didnt use baking soda because i didnt have it and i also used raw cane sugar instead of brown sugar because thats all i had. I cant wait to actually make this following the recipe correctly! Oh and i blended the oats to make it powdery (personal preference)"
"2","5","If you're looking for something different and relatively easy to make then this recipe is for you!!:) Below is my experience when trying this recipe: so i tried this recipe about two weeks ago, I'm new to the whole baking and cooking thing. I used granny smith apples in this recipe. I ended up burning the top (i set the dish to close to the heating elements), once i took off the charcoal everyone ate some after dinner AND everyone LOVED it and said this is how an apple crisp tastes. The syrup that develops during cooking is good and the apples keep a nice texture.   Next time I make this I may use more butter when making the topping just because it still felt really dry when mixing in the 1/2 cup of butter.  Overall definitely a great recipe and will be making again. :)"
"2","1","Way too much sugar in this recipe and not enough cinnamon. Next time, I will cut the sugar in half (at least) and double the cinnamon."
"2","5","Very good! I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the topping. As soon as it came out of the oven, I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on top, too. I used margarine because I didn't have any butter. For my family, I would cut down the apples to 8C instead of 10 because we aren't 'huge' fans of Apple. Delicious!"
"2","2","WAY TOO SWEET! Next time I will omit the white sugar (only do the crumble with cinnamon). Apples have enough sugar on their own!"
"2","5","This recipe is fantastic! My family LOVES it!!! I went with someone else's suggestion and reduced the water to 1/4 cup and I doubled the crumb topping. Serve warm with a scoop of ice cream... It's so delicious!"
"2","5","Absolutely amazingly wonderful!!!"
"2","5","This was super yummy. Like the other reviews I suggest cutting out the water. I did half of it and it was still pretty runny, just cut it out. I also doubled the topping!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! However, I cut the sugar in half as one of the people who would be eating this is a diabetic. However, the sugar was just right for us non-diabetics. I can't imagine this with full sugar."
"2","5","So good the topping and apples were delicious. No changes."
"2","5","This turned out delicious! I omitted the water and used a can of pineapple rings that I cut in smaller pieces with its juice. My family LOVED it. Thanks!!!"
"2","3","This was way too sweet! I think it was the full cup of sugar in the apples, because the topping was just fine. I'll try making it again and cutting the sugar in the apples down by half."
"2","5","instead of adding water. I added diet apple juice. Really made it taste SO good!"
"2","5","Followed almost everything and incorporate a couple suggestions. Cut the water in half, added a bit of nutmeg and used granny smith apples. So good! It must be paired with ice cream for the full yummy effect."
"2","2","These came out really crispy, hard actually. Needs way more apple slices because they shrivel up into tiny pieces after baking."
"2","5","I have made this at least 7 times and it's usually gone within 2 days at my house! The only thing I do different....Old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking ones and I increase the oatmeal by 1/2 cup because I love oatmeal."
"2","5","Excellent. Would have been better without the added water, I agree."
"2","4","This was easy to make and very tasty. However, it was a bit to sweet. My teeth actually hurt! Next time I would cut the sugar in half. Otherwise, this was very tasty and would make again with half the sugar!"
"2","5","Awesome recipe!! I used granola and oats for the crisp, double the amounts. I would recommend adding salt, and using butter instead of water."
"2","4","Not as good as my wife's, but it was good enough to impress her as a surprise. :D :D"
"2","5","The best. I have tried several different apple crisp recipes over the years and always come back to this one!! The difference is this one is moist not dry."
"2","4","I really liked this. It's hard to judge how many apples (and what size) will be 10 cups so I just used 6 large Granny Smiths, sliced into 16ths, which seemed like a good amount for my 9x13 pan. Some of my slices were probably 1/2' to 3/4' thick, shows how big my apples were... I added no water, baking soda or baking powder because I saw no reason for their inclusion. I did add at least a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples and more cinnamon because we like our spices. Other than these changes everything else remained the same. The amount of topping was just right, it was perfectly cooked in 45 mins and absolutely delicious."
"2","4","Very good recipe that I have made many times. - I don't put water on the apples and I found a better crumble but this one will work too - just doesn't get quite as crunchy as I like it and it's not quite enough for a 9X13.   Superior Crumble: Mix 1 1/2 cup flour, i cup packed brown sugar, 2 cups quick oats, and 1 teaspoon (or more) cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Mix in one cup melted butter until well combined.  Scrumptious and so easy! Excellent apple crisp!"
"2","5","Fabulous apple crisp recipe."
"2","5","fantastic! Best crisp I ever made!"
"2","3","It was delicious but not crisp! Any recommendations?"
"2","5","I made this recipe tonight, it's delish!! My Husband loved it he said that it was the best Apple Crisp he has ever eaten. Made it the way the recipe says, didn't alter a thing! It's a keeper, added it to my recipe box!"
"2","5","I used half the apples but kept the topping the same (I like more crisp) thinking this would be the perfect size for my husband and me. After tasting it I wish I would have made a bigger one - it is so good!"
"2","5","Made exactly as recipe reads, so delicious!!!"
"2","5","I mixed the sugar/cinnamon with the sliced Granny Smiths before putting into the baking dish, and I reduced the water to 2 tablespoons, and made extra 'crisp' for the topping. My mother-in-law said it was better than hers, so you know this is a keeper recipe. I've already been asked to bring it to Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter..... My husband loves apple pie, but claims he'll never eat another piece of pie as long as this apple crisp is available. Many thanks for this wonderful recipe."
"2","5","This is a great dish! I used Honey Crisp apples, I bought from the Amish Market, (they were the size of softballs) so I only used about 5 apples for this recipe!"
"2","5","This is an absolute fantastically delicious apple crisp. INSTEAD of water, I used the zest of one orange and squeezed the juice from the orange. For those that have made this recipe over and over, try this tweak with the orange and you will probably agree that it brings out an extra note of flavor brightness.   Cheers!"
"2","5","Double the topping, half on bottom, half on top...my family LOVED it!"
"2","5","I was searching for a new apple crisp recipe. Every fall, we pick bags of apples and make about 10 pans of apple crisp to freeze and eat throughout the year. I made two different recipes (this being one) and had a taste off. Everyone preferred this recipe. The apples keep their shape and don't cook to pieces. I only added 1/4 cup water and there is lots of liquid in the bottom of the pan. I suggest you adjust the water depending on the type of apple you're using. We use Mutsu apples and I will reduce the liquid to 1/8 cup (or less) in the future. The topping was crispy. We like a sweet apple crisp, so I left the other amounts as specified in the recipe. Yum!"
"2","5","This recipe is very yummy. I did not add the water and it was perfect!"
"2","5","Love this recipe! I left out the water accidentally when I made one for my mom and it turned out great. Made another pan for my own family and remembered the water that time but it makes the crisp too runny. Much better without the added water."
"2","5","So good! My husband and three boys ate more than half the pan in one sitting. I used 1/4 cup apple cider instead of 1/2 cup water. I cut white sugar by 1/4 cup. I used 2 tsp cinnamon and also added a dash of nutmeg and clove. I also increased the topping by 50% but left the brown sugar the same amount. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","This recipe was amazing!! I did make a couple of small changes. I cut the white sugar in half and doubled the cinnamon. had macintosh apples on hand so i used those, sprinkled with a little lemon juice and omitted the water. I doubled the topping and added a little cinnamon. Delicious!!! This is a keeper!"
"2","5","I doubled the oats and butter because we like extra crunchies in ours. This was fantastic!"
"2","5","Delicious! I changed mine up a little bit. I coated the apples in the sugar mixture instead of sprinkling them. I also used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon. Amazing. I was doing a bake sale to raise money for charity and baked then in little mason jars. Absolute perfection!"
"2","5","when i make apple crisp . i leave the skin on the apples . the skin adds a little flavor ."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly, including using the water and did not double the topping as some suggested and it was a big hit. ( I personally feel doubling the topping would have been way too much). I just always recommend tasting an apple first. If it is a sweeter apple cut down on the sugar, a tarter apple the sugar can be left alone."
"2","5","Wanted to chime in here with another stellar review and a couple of tips. Used six Granny Smith apples, and 1/4 cup of water as someone else suggested, and it was a tiny bit dry on top so I think the 1/2 cup would have been fine. Also mixed the sugar, cinnamon, flour, etc. and added some nutmeg as someone else suggested, and tossed the apples in the mix. Didn't double the recipe; it was by far enough topping as written. One of the BEST apple crisps I've ever made!"
"2","5","I kept everything the same except I used 5 Granny Smiths, 1/2 cup sugar divided among both white and brown and also threw in some salt and nutmeg. Kept topping the same except I cut in softened butter and made in 11x7 dish. Accompanied this with a homemade salted caramel sauce from Sally's Baking Addiction which is liquid gold and really set this over the edge. Oh and of course some vanilla ice cream. Yummy!"
"2","2","Holy cow, this was sweet!! I halved the sugar (used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the topping, and 1/2 in the apples). There was also too much flour in the topping, as it was kind of pasty in our mouths. Would not repeat. :("
"2","5","This was the best apple crisp I have ever made and tasted!!!!! Soooooo good:):). My boys were sooo happy with it too!"
"2","4","Very good, but I think I'd cut back on the sugar a little bit. Definitely will be making again."
"2","5","This was Fabulous! I only used 1/4 cup of water and the apples were very moist! I did double the entire crumble, but just because that is my favorite part of apple crisp as is my families. They loved it! Only bake as long as the recipe states or your apples will be mush! I plan on making this again in a few more months for the holidays...it is that good! Serve with french vanilla ice cream over the top."
"2","5","Feels like Fall! I only had 5 small apples that started to dry out. Still able to make enough for 3 individual porcelain pies. Decreased the topping amounts by half which left the apples mostly covered with the crumb topping. Perfect!"
"2","5","Yummy!! Everyone loves it! Changes I made, however, are: skipped the water; added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg; cut the sugars back by a third. As it was, it was way too sweet for everyone."
"2","5","Very good, thank you!"
"2","4","Good. I would have mixed some top mix into the apple layers."
"2","5","I didn't add water."
"2","5","This was excellent! I made it for the first time for my July 4th party, and everyone who ate it complemented how good it was. I used about 7 large granny smith's, and per another reviewer I mixed the apples in the cinammon sugar mixture and then put them in the dish. I also added half the water it calls for, and it came out perfect. I doubled the amount of topping- personally I thought that was too much topping, but everyone else loved it. May make 1.5x topping next time. Served this with the homemade Vanilla Ice Cream IV on this site, and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe"
"2","5","Mine was great. Perfect crunch. I used other reviews to tweak my recipe. I doubled the topping recipe and used most of it. Used 1 stick of butter diced cold and 1/2 stick melted.added vanilla to my topping and pecans.I tossed my apples in sugar mixture with added nutmeg. cut the water down to 1/4 cup over apples. Was crisp even after being in the fridge 2 days. Never got soggy leftovers. Awesome."
"2","4","I served this as dessert for Father's Day dinner and we all thought it was SO good! I followed others' directions and doubled the crust- putting one layer on the bottom and a second layer on top. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, lessened the water to 1/4 c and used granny smith apples. It was EXTREMELY sweet and I'm not sure we would have been able to eat it if we didn't add a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, which actually cut the sweetness. I'll definitely make this again but I'll use less sugar."
"2","5","I made it exactly as the recipe was written and you know what...I wouldn't change a thing!! It was delicious!!"
"2","5","I have baked for a long time and always make apple pies - our new Pastor liked apple crisps - so had to find a recipe. Tried this one and it was very good and well received. I also baked it in 9x9 and used only  1/4 C. H2O. Would recommend to anyone :) thanks!"
"2","5","This was one of the best desserts I've ever made. I used 6 apples I think, and just used the normal amount of everything. The only modification I made was that I added 1/8-1/4 tsp salt to the crumble mixture. I think it needed it and it tasted great. Also, I forgot the water and it wasnt a problem at all."
"2","4","I made this recipe for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. I made a few small changes but mostly stuck to the recipe. I cut 10 small granny smith apples and soaked them in a bag with a sugar mix (1cup sugar, 3 tbs cinnamon, 2 tbs all purpose flour). I let it sit for a couple hours to soak up flavor. I Didn't add water b/c there was more than enough juice from the apples in the bag. For the crumble I doubled the recipe (next time I will only make 1.5x b/c I had plenty leftover). I cut the butter instead of melting it. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","Absolutely amazing!! I tossed the apples in cinnamon sugar, used 1/4 cup out water, added nutmeg, and doubled the crust. Even my husband who normally hates apple crisp loved it."
"2","5","I made it exactly and it turned out great!"
"2","5","I've made this half a dozen times at least - a hit every time!"
"2","4","Yum! Family loves it. Here are the suggesting I followed: Double crust and put on top and bottom. Blend soft butter in crust instead of melting it. Lemon on apples instead of water. Added nutmeg. Yum.. Next time I will use just a tad less white sugar."
"2","4","This was good. would put less water in next time and use granny smith apples."
"2","5","Easy recipe to make, excellent and delicious!"
"2","3","I made this was very good just a little too sweet for me,I will still make it but cut back on sugar."
"2","2","Very bland? I don't get the great reviews?? Needs some salt and vanilla - I used unsalted butter ? I added apple pie spice and twice as much cinnamon tg!! idk what the baking soda and powder were for? didn't rise? Next time I would toss w/ lemon juice , add salt , vanilla and skip soda and powder - and add some pecans!"
"2","5","Great recipe. I doubled the topping and used 5 granny smith apples, I think I would use 7 or 8 next time."
"2","5","Added ground pecans and almonds to the crumble mixture . Used home grown apples which are a little tart so I added 1/4 cup of best brown Sugar to the apple base"
"2","5","I made this the other day. Instead of making it in a 9x13 pan I made it in a crust round pan, the ones you buy in the store for pie and it came out perfect!the crust on the bottom was a nice touch, instead of making more of the crumb topping. Make sure you use good apples or it wint come out as well. I think I lowered the sugar because I had very sweeet apples. All in all, this is the best apple crisp recipe. Its perfect, and im making it today!"
"2","5","Made with Granny Smith apples, my family loved this apple crisp."
"2","4","Good taste and texture. Used half spy and half crispin apples but next time probably just crispin. I will also half recipe as I had far more crisp than we could eat. Wondered if it froze well??"
"2","5","Perfect, best apple crisp ever. The water helps create a nice syrup. I added nuts to the topping, served hot and it was a winner!"
"2","5","This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this website. So easy to make and tastes wonderful! Didn't change a thing."
"2","5","having a hell of a time doing this on my mobile phone, so, I will just say that I loved it, I added 'pickled' tri-color raisins (in rum, leftover from a previous recipe). And walnuts, mixed in with the oat mixture, and it came out delicioso! Mmmmm B-) will definitely be making this again!"
"2","5","This recipe is just wonderful!"
"2","5","This is a great apple crisp recipe. I use 6-7 very large Granny Smith apples, which made for a nice tart apple taste to go up against the sweet topping. I find that mixing the apples in a large bowl helps to evenly distribute the cinnamon/sugar/flour mixture before spreading the apples in the pan. I skip the water (per other reviews) and don't miss it at all--the apples release plenty of liquid as they cook. I also roughly double the topping mixture, as my family likes that part the best. This recipe has become a highly requested dessert at family gatherings."
"2","5","Very good especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","I have been making this for years now and it is time to give it the stars it deserves."
"2","3","Meh...definitely not worth all the hype people have been giving it. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a little less water as others have suggested. It came out...ok...but nothing to rave about. I used granny smith apples, and the thing was pretty tart and not that sweet. For me, this was not a dish that was best served fresh. It actually tasted better the next day after the apples lost a lot of their tart flavor. Also, the crumb topping wasn't very good."
"2","5","Awesome! I made it in a 8 x 10 pan so it was thick. This will be my goto recipe from now on!!!"
"2","5","Thee best apple crisp recipe!!! I use half the suggested apples and omit adding any water when first placing the apples in the dish. I also sometimes add flaked coconut to the crisp."
"2","5","Double the crust! Used Granny Smiths, delicious!"
"2","5","I doubled the toppings as some suggested but didn't use double the sugar. Very good!"
"2","4","Great recipe.  Don't be afraid to make a few changes to your liking. I doubled the topping and used 7 Granny Smith apples. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in my apple mixture instead of white as well as 1 cup in my topping. I also added the juice of one lemon to the apples instead of water and added cinnamon and nutmeg liberally. I left my apples in the fridge for half the day before baking. For the crust I made sure my butter was cold (cold butter suspended in the batter is what makes your crumbles) I added a tad of cinnamon, and didn't bother with the baking soda or baking powder.  And used my hands to mash everything together. After I was done I pressed it all down in my bowl and let it chill in the freezer. When I was ready to bake I used a fork to make big chunks. Mmm. Baked at 325 for 50 min.   Best served... Anytime with ice cream. :)"
"2","5","This was a great crisp. I omitted the water on accident and when I pulled it out after 35 min it looked really dry. I covered it with foil, poured 2c cream over the top and put it back in for 15 min. It was wonderful. The cream made a rich, delicious sauce. I also cut the sugar on the apples in half. I used fuji apples."
"2","5","This was SO good! Only deviations I made were that I used a 8x8 glass dish, used 1/4 c water, and probably only 7+ c apple slices. Would be perfect with vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","Recipe was very good!! I did make some changes. Since I was using all red eating apples (red delicious, gala, and fuji) I went with what other reviewers said and cut the sugar way down. I used less than 1/2 c for the apples. I also added in the 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture and tossed the apples in the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg mixture. I added a very small amount of water (less than 1/4 cup) and it came out perfectly. For the crumble topping I doubled it and added in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chopped pecans but kept everything else the same. I baked it for the entire 45 minutes and it was delicious. I will make this again. It was a perfect addition to our brunch.   I did have some left over topping ( I used 3/4 the amount) so I mashed up two very ripe bananas and mixed them in, scooped into mini muffin pan then baked at 350F for about 12-15 minutes (until toothpick came out smooth), sprinkled a small amount of cinnamon on each and it was a delicious treat! Tasted just like banana bread. You could probably mix in some cinnamon into the batter instead of sprinkling on top but that was an after thought."
"2","5","Excellent apple crisp! Just right topping!"
"2","5","Made this for our Bible Study Group! and everyone have it 2 thumbs up!! Used regular sugar for the apples and Splenda brown sugar blend for the topping."
"2","5","This was wonderful! I only had 6 medium apples so I used those but made the amount of topping called for in the recipe. It was the perfect ratio of apples to topping. I made it in a Corningware dish that I could cover and store in the refrigerator."
"2","5","Very good recipe. I did find the topping slightly dryer then I like. unlike most viewers I liked the water and made the recipe exactly as written."
"2","5","Family favorite!  Everyone raves about this apple crisp, and my partner expects it as his yearly 'birthday cake.'  It's super easy to make, and sometimes I substitute pancake mix for the flour (I was out of flour once), and I think they like that even more!"
"2","5","I added 1/2 C. of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey in with the apples instead of the water. Fantastic! I too doubled the topping recipe only using 3/4 C. butter. Served warm over ice cream is a must and if you like, drizzle a little Fireball over it all for an added kick. You will never make apple crisp any other way again."
"2","4","This was very good. I left out the water and added a little nutmeg."
"2","5","Love this recipe!!! I changed the spices a bit as I like it a little more spicy. Added 1/4 tspn of ginger, nutmeg and all spice in with apples and then cinnamon as well as other spices to crust. It was amazing! I served it with whipped cream and the whole thing was eaten by 4 adults in one sitting. Piggies:) I baked it at 325 for an extra 12 minutes and it was absolute heaven. Best apple crisp recipe ever."
"2","4","this was very good why I gave it 4 star it was a little sweet for us next time I will cut back on brown sugar"
"2","5","SO YUMMY! I sprinkled nutmeg over the apples before adding the crumble mix on top. I also baked for a little longer so the topping was a little crispier. We couldn't get enough!"
"2","5","This is an excellent recipe. As Ally99 said, only use a 1/4 c of water. Using a 1/2 c will make it too runny. It's still reeeeeeaally good. I don't see this sticking around the house for very long."
"2","5","I MADE CHANGES!! I used Jonagold apples and worked purrfecty! I thought this was a wonderful recipe. It was my first time of ever making it and I followed it completely. My family enjoyed it but being a southern girl it needed a little bit more. These are the changes that I did the 2nd time of making it: Used dark brow sugar instead of sugar  Added vanilla extract and nutmeg but no measuring just by taste.  Cut back on water because of the vanilla. For the topping,  I used 3/4 cup of flour A little extra of butter Added some of some of the juices from the apples OMGOODNESS! It caramelized up so well and was not runny. The topping was awesome and it goes great with coffee! Thanks DK"
"2","4","This sounded like a great recipe to try out and maybe take to Thanksgiving dinner. I just pulled this out of the oven. The taste is great. I cut the recipe in half, but left the original topping measurements as others suggested. I also used much more cinnamon and nutmeg, and added a tsp of vanilla. Pros: Good flavor, looks pretty. Cons: Could use less water and oats next time. Maybe as it sets the water-glaze will thicken. This is almost too much topping for my taste, and for my 8x8 pan. I realize a lot of people do like the topping part better though, so I think this could go over well. Overall, good recipe and easily tweakable. I think I'll do things a bit differently next time if I want to serve this to company."
"2","5","Made this for desert tonight for the family, and it was awesome! As a dad who enjoys baking but often creates flops, this worked out perfectly.  Not sure if I actually had 10 cups of apple or not... I had a bunch... :) Enough to pile up the 9x13 pan pretty well. And I followed the recipe exactly, *except* I decided not to put all of the sugar/cinnamon mix on the apples. I mixed those ingredients as per the recipe, but then only used about half of it, and the taste was amazing.  Made the topping/crust as per the recipe, and it was also perfect... plenty for a nice thick crunchy crust.  We didn't have any ice cream at home, but it really didn't need it! It is that good!"
"2","5","Super delicious and VERY easy'. I used Granny Smith apples and the ONLY change I made was that I baked it covered! It was a big hit and the left overs were equally delicious!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe. Added a little maple syrup, vanilla and some caramel topping to the apple mixture. Will make again!"
"2","5","5 STARS! Be Warned...you may become extremely addicted to this apple crisp! Toss the apples in the sugar+cinnamon mix before adding to dish, plus sprinkle on a dash of nutmeg. Only add about 1/4 cup of water instead. BOOM. It's heaven."
"2","5","My issue with this recipes is that I CANNOT STOP EATING IT! I;ve made it about 100 times and every time I take a little spoonful of it and next thing I know I've eaten half the pan. Seriously, go make it, this is THE BEST. Also, don't worry if you don't have baking soda, I've never used it ( I never seem to have it around) and it always turns out amazing."
"2","5","WONDERFUL! Made is for a work pot luck. Got very good reviews. Personally next time I will cut the water down to 1/4cup. I like my apples to still have a little bite but still very good."
"2","5","Made this today with my boyfriend and we both loved it! I used mostly Granny Smith apples but threw in a Pink Lady and a Braeburn just for some variety. I also followed what some reviewers said and instead of adding water, I mixed the apples in the sugar/flour mixture to draw out moisture and I found them to be perfectly moist after baking. I don't recommend doubling the topping mixture like some reviewers suggested. I was going to double it but decided to see how much the original recipe made first and I thought it was the perfect amount of topping. Any more would have been too much, in my opinion. Also, I used 3/4 cup sugar in the apples instead of 1 cup to balance the sweetness of my Pink Lady and Braeburn apples, and I used wheat flour instead of white. I found this recipe to be delicious and I definitely plan on making it again. Not to mention it's easy and fairly cheap to make!"
"2","5","Great recipe! I had the apples all prepped and realized I was out of oatmeal. So I subbed 3 packets(which equals 1 cup) of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal. I decreased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup to compensate for the sweetness of the oatmeal. And I increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Normally I make a recipe the way it is written but this time I took the advice of some of the reviewers. Pros: adding Apple pie spice good. Mixing apples in with sugar, flour, cinnamon good. Cons: Not adding water, bad. My oats didn't cook. Using any type of apples, bad. Mixing two different types of apples made this too sweet. I like a little tart to my Apple crisp. I gave this five stars because the second batch that I made tonight as written, keeping with the pros and cons was delicious!Next one that I make, I will make without any changes! Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","Wonderful apple crisp! I did as others suggested and halved the water. I also doubled the cinnamon. It was a huge hit!"
"2","5","Spectacular!! Cut it in half and it was perfect for an 8x8 pyrex baking dish. Otherwise, I see no reason to adjust anything."
"2","4","This was very good and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it had way to much sugar. 1/2 cup is plenty and I used granny smith apples which are pretty tart. I did double the topping and it was very good. Also, could see no point to add baking powder and soda, so left it out. I'm not sure what that would have done for it."
"2","5","Easy recipe and turned out delicious! I used 3 different varieties of apples and followed the exact recipe. Definitely going to make this again. Served it with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it. :)"
"2","5","Delicious! I used a variety of apples (macs and cortlands)and followed the directions almost exactly. I forgot the water and only had regular oats. It came out great! Topped with vanilla ice cream, of course!"
"2","5","Skipped the water and added 1/2 c less brown sugar. Used 10 apples (not 10 cups) Amazing."
"2","5","Easy to make and really delicious. The only change that I made was adding freshly ground nutmeg."
"2","4","I had a pantry full of very bruised apples so decided to try this recipe rather than trying to force the kids to eat them! We loved this recipe and I certainly won't be waiting for the next batch of old apples before making this again. So simple and very, very tasty."
"2","5","Excellent fall dessert! Great with iceceam"
"2","5","Delicious! While I normally make apple crisp with Granny Smith, our orchard didn't have any so I went with 1/2 cortland and 1/2 macintosh. I doubled the topping and made the mistake of using one stick of butter by accident rather then two (d'oh!) and naturally it was pretty dry which took me a while to figure out why ( you, White Zinfandel!) but i did a bit of damage control and mixed the topping in with the apples to moisten it up. I halved the water also but i don't think it was necessary"
"2","5","Just made this using 15 Gala apples, it was delicious!! I cut the water in half,(per other reviews) and I also cut the white sugar by half since I was using all Gala apples, and added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. I followed the topping exact and I thought it was plenty for my 9x13. Thanks, Diane for the wonderful recipe!!"
"2","4","Don't follow reviewers advice about doubling the topping. It was way too much topping and I wish I had followed the recipe as written. If I had, I think I would have loved it."
"2","4","Family really liked this. I read reviews so stirred the flour sugar mixture into the apples, doubled the topping recipe using brown sugar instead of white. I used old-fashioned oats as I didn't have any quick oats. I added about 1/4 cup of apple juice instead of water in case the old fashioned oats would soak up more moisture. The crisp turned out great. The topping was a crisp, golden brown and the apples turned out well too. The topping could probably be made with a little less brown sugar if you prefer a less sweet topping. This is a recipe I'll make again."
"2","5","Turned out perfectly! Don't mess with this recipe! Perfect as is! I used Granny Smith apples and left the peel on. Delightful awesomeness!"
"2","5","Awesome recipe, very easy to adjust to whatever ingredients you have at hand. Like other users suggested I omitted the water, reduced the sugar and baked in 9x13 dish. Came out great. I used wild apples, which are small and red and grow right outside my parents yard. The coring and pealing took a while, but the crisp made it worth it. I sprayed the dish with Pam and tossed the apples with 1/4 cup white sugar (didn't have brown), a pinch of ground cinnamon nutmeg and 1 table spoon of flour. I poured the apples in the dish. For the topping I used 2 individual serving packets of instant quacker oatmeal in banana bread flavor ( all I had for oatmeal in the pantry) 1/2 cup self-rising flour (out of all purpose, so I omitted baking soda and powder from my recipe) 1/4 cup white sugar, pinch of cinnamon, 1/4 cup butterscotch chips. I tossed the dry ingredients then melted 1 stick (8 tablespoons) of butter and poured it into the dry ingredients. Roughly mixed until the mixture looked like wet sand and crumbled on top of the apples. Baked for 45 min at 350 degrees. Broiled the top for two minutes at the end. Delicious served with whipped cream. Yum yum!"
"2","2","Apple mush! I used Granny smith apples and they literally turned into applesauce. There is way too much sugar in this recipe, it makes my stomach hurt. Normally my apple crisp is bubbling, this one wasn't. It had an entire layer of dried oatmeal mixture just sitting on top. Complete fail."
"2","5","1. I read the recipe and top reviews and came up with the following stellar recipe. At a dinner party everyone (6 different couples) asked for the recipe and every crumb was gone.  2.	 Mix the white sugar, 1 tablespoon flour and ground cinnamon together, and lay apple slices in mixture and flip over apples so they are coated well. 3.	Combine the oats, 2 cups flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and melted butter together in a bowl. 4.	Place about ¼ of the oat mixture at the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan 5.	Place the sliced apples over the ¼ mixture 6.	Pour the rest of the sugar-cinnamon mix evenly over the apples  7.	Pour ¼ cup water evenly over apples 8.	Crumble the rest of the 3/4th oat mixture evenly over the apples. 9.	Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes."
"2","5","Excellent!! Best recipe yet!!"
"2","5","I halved the recipe and still needed a 9x13 pan! It came out delicious. I served it in wine goblets with vegan ice cream."
"2","5","Most requested from work and home. I double the crust. I use Honeycrisp Apples and no water (there's enough water retained in the apples). I have also used the crust as a base in cheesecake recipes."
"2","5","I use this recipe all the time. It disappears. 5 stars.  I use Granny Smith Apples, either 5 or 6 depending on the size. I don't add the water. I reduce the white sugar by about half.  The only thing I do that hasn't been mentioned is that after I spread the crust over the top, I take two hands and firmly compress the crust down on the apples, especially the edges. I find the end result stays together much better and reduces the 'spillage' in the oven.  enjoy."
"2","5","I have been searching for 20 years for an Apple Crisp recipe that mimicked the dish served in my Grade School back in the '70s. I have found it!!!!! After trying many, many, many recipes! I have an 'old' peach cobbler recipe that is VERY SIMILAR to this EXCEPT it is with a batter topping. I followed the recipe exactly; however, I did add lemon juice to the apples to keep the color as I prepared the topping and to add a little acidity. I also added cinnamon to the apples along with dotting the apples in the baking dish with real butter. I added 1/8th cup of water, but had to remove the water after baking. Do not add water; it is NOT necessary. I used left over Red Delicious Apples. I also cut the recipe in half to fit an 8x8 pan, but kept the topping as is. It is to DIE FOR!!!!!! This recipe will forever be on my table! Congratulations!!!!"
"2","5","So good this didn't last a day in my house!!"
"2","5","This was really great. So easy my eight year old helped me. It's a must have."
"2","5","GREAT RECIPE, BUT MODIFIED , ADDED 1 CUP SHREDDED COCONUT TO TOPPING,AND DOUBLED THE TOPPING AMOUNT"
"2","5","Love! Love! Love! My husband liked it but not as much as me. I reduced the amount of apples down to 5 cups as well as white sugar down to 3/4 cup. I only added a 1/4 cup water. I will definitely make it again. Thank you for sharing"
"2","5","So perfect!! I ended up putting it in two different tart pans and loved it. I think being so spread out made the crisp part crispier :) I also subbed crushed graham crackers for the flour. Very happy with this change. Enjoy!!"
"2","5","I just took this Apple Crisp out of the oven - Made no changes to the original recipe and it is delicious! Will not change a thing! Might try with peaches when they are in season."
"2","5","Fantastic! I have been making this for about 2 years for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everybody loves and asks for it. I also double the topping."
"2","3","It's pretty good - I added nutmeg as I've noticed some others did and some Vanilla extract. It's a little too sweet though - I cut back on the sugar a little bit, and next time I plan to cut back even more on it. Much healthier and you can taste the flavours past the sweetness! :)"
"2","5","I made this last night to use up the last dozen or so baking apples I picked the other day and this is my new go to apple crisp recipe! It turned out fantastic and smelled so good while baking, my husband kept asking if it was done yet so he could try it. I used slightly more then the 10 cups of apples called for because I didn't want just 2 apples left over as the apples I used are a bit tart for eating on their own. I also added some nutmeg to the sugar/flour (3tbsp)/cinnamon mix and rather than sprinkling over the apples I mixed it with the apples, poured the apples in my pan, sprinkled with 4tbsp of water and dotted with butter. For the topping I doubled the recipe (the topping is the best part!) and added chopped walnuts and a dash of cinnamon. I had to bake longer than recomended but I attribute that to using a few extra apples. I covered the crisp with foil for the first 20 or so minuets to avoid over browning. Next time I will cut back on the white sugar in the apples, 1/2-3/4 instead of 1 cup. Even with using very tart apples it was a bit on the sweet side for our taste. All in all a GREAT recipe that will be in regular rotation in our home."
"2","5","Use Granny Smith and Golden Delicious (on the green side). Got rave reviews. Thank you"
"2","3","Too sweet for my taste"
"2","5","I've made this a few times, but I used brown sugar instead of white for the crisp and it turned out chewier and more crisp, it was delicious!"
"2","5","This is the first time I've ever written a review, but was so pleased with this recipe I felt it was very deserving of a review. I took other advise and doubled the topping and omitted the water and I used golden delicious apples. The apple crisp turned out absolutely perfect and sooooooo easy to make!! I took it to a meeting I had tonight and received compliments from all and brought home an empty pan. Thank you Diane, for submitting this recipe!!! It will be made many times over at this house and I'm positive it will be a family favorite."
"2","5","This is a wonderful apple crisp. Bought a 4lb bag of Honey Crisp apples at Sam's Club, ate one and didn't like it...more tart than usual. So, I thought, dang, so much for eating healthy...I have to make a crisp now. Peeled, cored and sliced the rest of bag and it measured out 10 cups perfectly. Used a hand held apple slicer and then cut each of those slices in half lengthwise. Followed recipe, except made 1 1/2 times the topping and had plenty for top and bottom. As per other reviews, I cut butter into flour/oat/sugar mixture instead of melting it. Didn't use water, probably wouldn't have hurt it any, though. Baked for 1 hour to compensate for extra topping. Perfectly delicious served hot with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream! Family was all smiles. Will add chopped pecans next time to put it over the top."
"2","5","I've made this apple crisp twice now and love it. The crisp stays nice and crunchy and is my favorite part! I wanted to get this ready a little bit ahead of time so I made the crisp part first and just covered with plastic wrap. A little bit later I peeled the apples and covered them with the sugar, flour and cinnamon mixture. I did toss this all together in the baking dish because I felt it would help more evenly coat things. I covered and just let it sit until I was ready to top with the crisp mixture, fully intending to add the water, but in the confusion of our family get together, I forgot. I just topped with the crisp mixture and put it in the oven. It was plenty juicy though and very delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","When you peel and core your apples, if you soak them in lightly lemoned water and then strain them, this is plenty to cover the water asked for in this recipe. The sugars and natural water from apples make it caramely/ wet enough. Yummy."
"2","5","I used 8 apples (fuji & gala;) soaked in water with lemon juice while I cut them up. With the apple seasoning I added 1T apple cider vinegar, omitted the water. Overall I used 1/2 the sugar called for. Used my fingers to smoosh up the butter into the brown sugar and flour, then I added the oatmeal (regular.) Baked in 9 x 13 glass pan. It turned out great: moist, with plenty of topping. We added unwhipped cream.   I'll definitely be making this again!! Thanks for sharing!!"
"2","5","This is a really good one. My changes were; Sqeezed 1/2 of a lemon over sliced apples. 1/2 the white sugar, but did drizzle a little agave nectar over apples. Used i/2 coconut oil minus 1 Tblsp. Added lots of cinnamon and a little pumpkin pie spice. added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to topping mixture."
"2","5","I actually cut this recipe in half and made this in my cast iron skillet. I used half Jonathan apples, half Granny Smith apples. Before tossing the apples with the sugar, cinnamon and flour, I did toss them with a tablespoon of lemon juice to keep them from browning. I melted 1/4 cup of butter in my skillet as the oven was preheating, I just layered my apples on top of that. After 20 minutes of baking, I realized I had forgotten the flour.........but you know what, it still turned out AWESOME. Out of that whole skillet, there is NOTHING left over. We LOVED this crisp recipe. Even my husband said this is perfect and I'm to make this again. Tomorrow. SUCH a keeper."
"2","5","Have made twice and we're very happy with it, but we use only half a cup of white sugar. It works best for us to use ~ 8 medium-sized apples and no water! You don't need to use quick-cooking oats; we always use regular oats, and it comes out nice and crumbly! You can also use a little less than 1/2 cup butter. I like to add extra cinnamon."
"2","4","Delicious! I'm giving it 4 stars only because I found the water to be completely unnecessary. I tossed the apples in the sugar mixture and that brought out enough juices that the addition of the water just made it too watery. Great recipe, though! Will definitely be making it again."
"2","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted and all my friends just love it too. I have made it twice now once with macintosh apples and the other time with harleson apples."
"2","5","One of our favorites. Tangy and sweet and delicious!"
"2","4","yummy but too sweet. cut down on the sugar"
"2","5","This was an ABSOLUTE hit with the family!! The only thing I would change the next time I make it is to decrease the water! Other than that, this is one recipe I will not tweak beyond that tiny bit! This was definitely a hit and will be made many times I am sure!"
"2","5","ABSOLUTELY BAR NONE...THE BEST APPLE CRISP RECIPE EVER. I'VE MADE A VARIATION F THIS FR 45 YEARS BUT HAVE TOSSED THE OLD & WILL NOW USE THIS ONE. GRANNY SMITH OR ANY HARD TART APPLE IS BEST. I TOOK THIS TO CHURCH POTLCK AND THEY SCRAPED THE BOTTOM! THANKS FOR SHARING & TEACHING AN OLD DOG A NEW TRICK."
"2","5","This was absolutely delicious! My entire family raved about this and we are making it again even though we just had it a few days ago (we have a lot of apples to use from our tree:)) Anyway, we followed some other reviewers advice and made the following changes: -doubled the topping (next time will only time and a half it, as it was a little too much) -mixed apples up with the flour/cinnamon mixture -did not add the water to the apples -didn't really measure the apples...maybe only used 8cups? Just kept adding until all sugar mixture used up, then added 2 more apples to coated ones -used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg -cut the butter into the topping with mixer instead of melting it Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","This was a big hit at a bbq, several people asked me for the recipe! It was super easy to make. I used 1/4 cup of water and doubled the topping, as suggested by other reviewers. I was going to add nutmeg as well, but I forgot. It turned out great without it. I used Granny Smith apples and baked it in a 8 1/2 X 11 baking dish, as I didn't have the bigger size pan that the recipe called for. It turned out perfect. Definitely must be served with vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","Add Cereal!! I didn't think it was possible to make this Apple Crisp recipe any better, but...I didn't have oats at home, so I grabbed a box of cereal out of the pantry - Honey Bunches of Oats - and mixed that into the topping mixture. It was SO good. The flakes and clusters of oats from the cereal are much crunchier and crisp than the plain old oats. I'm going to make that a permanent addition to this recipe."
"2","5","Excellent recipe!! IS going to replace to one I already have!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! As others have done, I doubled the crisp and made it with the crisp on the bottom and on the top. Also used a little more than the suggested amount of water due to the doubling of the crisp. It was nice bc it wasn't dry but moist and just right. All I can so is oh so good!"
"2","5","This stuff is to die for! The first time I made it, I sliced the apples a little too thick, and they did not get soft enough in cooking. When I made it again, I used an apple corer/slicer to cut each apple into eight pieces, then cut each piece again lengthwise so I had sixteen slices per apple. MUCH better! Also, instead of adding the water, I rinsed the apple slices in a colander, then mixed them in with the cinnamon sugar combination. Thanks to hints from other reviewers, I also added a pinch of nutmeg. I doubled the topping recipe but had too much left over. But if you like lots of crispy topping, I'd increase it by at least half. Absolutely delicious, and none left over!"
"2","5","Made this today. Followed the instructions exactly except I used a mix of old leftover apples - granny smith, a fuji and some red delicious. Turned out fantastic and a 9 x 13 pan is a lot of crisp. Yum! Taking leftovers to the office tomorrow."
"2","5","I used 8 c. of apples with same ratios. Turned out WONDERFUL!! Easy to make too!!!"
"2","5","I always pick recipes with the fewest amount ingredients, the less ingredients for me usually ends up being the better recipes for my family. I did double the topping based on other reviews next time I will only add an additional 1/2 of the topping almost too much crisp for me. However with that being said my husband tried to convince me that I ruined a good batch of apples with this recipe so he could have it all to himself and supposedly save me..lol...definitely will make this again, easy and excellent taste always win out!!"
"2","3","This makes a HUGE batch of Crisp. I found that the recipe didn't make quite enough crumble so I made a second batch to sprinkle over the top and was glad I did. It helped balance out all the appley goodness!"
"2","5","This was AMAZING!!!!!:D just double the secound set of ingredients and that made it magnificent!!!! You will love love love!"
"2","5","This is AMAZING!!! I didn't add any water like other people suggested and it was perfect. I used a 9X9 pan and didn't double the topping and just cooked it for 5 or 10 minutes longer and it was great! It was a little bit soupy though even without the water. I think I will add a little more than the 1 tablespoon of flour that is in the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe!"
"2","5","Soooooooooo delicious!! I did as the other reviewers suggested though & doubled the topping. OH MY!!!!!"
"2","5","Such and Easy and tasty recipe! The oatmeal topping is delicious!"
"2","5","Family loved it! Doubled the topping & topped with ice cream- YUM"
"2","5","I, too, am always compelled to add my own spin. I added frozen mango, strawberry, peach mixture. Instead of brown sugar, I used molasses melted with the butter. I also added a tsp of cayenne to the apple/fruit mixture. Served with really good vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of home made chocolate syrup. Wonderful!"
"2","5","Brought this to a dinner party and got rave reviews."
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I have made this several times doubling or trippeling the recipe as needed. Always delicious. I always make more of the topping though. Love this fruit crisp."
"2","3","Just OK. I've had better and I've had worse."
"2","5","Wonderful! Everyone I have made this for loves it. I doubled the crust (because it's 'that' good) and used different apples each time (pink lady, ambrosia, etc) and it always tasted good."
"2","5","Made it with cranberries and orange juice instead of water. Yummy!"
"2","5","JUST what I was looking for! Only change I made was I halved the sugar in with the apples; next time will eliminate it all together. Apples are sweet as it is, so extra sugar is unnecessary....was VERY good though. Will definitely make again!"
"2","5","What a great and easy recipe! I followed it exactly, and my whole family loved it. It was a bit sweet for me personally, but I put a scoop of tart frozen yogurt on it and it was so good. I will definitely be making this again!"
"2","4","I am giving this recipe a 4 WITH my changes. I saw a lot of reviewers say that granny smith works best here, but I already had Gala so I used those. The texture turned out great - the sweetness did not. And on top of that I used HALF of the sugar called for in the apples themselves - I cannot imagine what this would have tasted like with a whole cup! I did also add some nutmeg, which was a nice touch. I also didn't use the 1/2 cup of water, but instead a few tablespoons of orange juice to add tartness, but with all that sugar it still wasn't tart enough for me. As far as the topping - I doubled that and put part on the bottom, If I wanna make this 5 star, next time I will use Granny Smith, cut the sugar down to just a few tablespoons, use orange juice (a few Tbsp) instead of water, NOT double the topping (which I know was my fault, not the original poster's) and cook for an hour. I may also use less butter since it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. Decent basic recipe, just needs a lot of tweaking and DEFINITELY the right apples."
"2","5","I made this receipe for my boyfriend & friends - and now it is always in demand! Receipe is perfect as is, and also really good if you add half apples/half peaches. My personal preference is to add an extra cup of oats to the topping (as the topping is the best part!) and serve with vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","This is great. If you want it even easier, just open a large can of peaches (and don't add the white sugar). This always goes fast!!"
"2","5","A perfect apple crisp :) Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Great taste and very simple to make, I added frozen raspberry's, about one cup and it was wonderful."
"2","5","wonderful recipe!!!!! i made it with a whole bag of granny smith apples and followed the recipe exact! definately plan on making this again"
"2","5","I cut the recipe in half and it was just the right amount for my husband and I and our 3 small children. Very tasty! I made it with Granny Smith apples."
"2","5","YUMMY!!! I used 10 medium sized apples, could have used more. It was a hit with everyone!"
"2","5","BEST YET! WOW! PERFECT Dont change a thing!"
"2","5","Excellent apple crisp recipe...turned out 100% perfect!!! Made easier with a apple corer/peeler/slicer....,yup, i cheated"
"2","5","Soooo good! This is my husband's favourite dessert, he eats it often, and he told me that this recipe was the best one he ever had! I didn't add any water and I added nutmeg. I also put the 'seasoning' into a ziploc bag and tossed it with the apples instead of sprinkling. I will make this a LOT!!"
"2","5","I doubled the topping as other reviewers suggested, and used only 1/4 c water. This is quite possibly the best dessert I have ever eaten in my life."
"2","5","This is delicious ! I made it the other day and it is so easy. Next time I will buy the prepared apple slices in my market. I only need enough for 2.... My Hubby thought it was as good as my Apple Pie I will definitely make again :) Instead of using real brown sugar, I used brown sugar substitute....Yummy !"
"2","5","Best apple crisp I've ever had! Side note: Use slightly tart apples like Braeburn or Honeycrisp instead of Granny smith and then you can halve the sugar. DEFINITELY double the topping! Who doesn't like more topping?"
"2","5","Excellent apple crisp! A huge hit! Used the following user suggestions: Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture I tossed the apples in. Added half of the water. Doubled the crust recipe and cut in the butter instead of melting it. Yum!"
"2","5","Great recipe! I omitted the water as well. I've made it twice so far. The second time I made it, I added a can of whole berry cranberry sauce to the apples. The result was tart and sweet. Loved it! Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","absolutely fabulous. made it without any changes and it was perfect."
"2","5","We doubled the 'crust' and used gala apples. Delicious! Great for big dinners as it makes quite a bit!"
"2","5","This was hands-down the best apple crisp I have ever tasted in my life."
"2","5","Everyone loved it. For the 12-serving recipe, I used 9 apples, cut the water & white sugar in half, and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg."
"2","5","Made this for a family reunion and there were no leftovers. Only suggestion is to use tart apples, like Granny Smith, or this dish might be too sweet."
"2","5","The first time I made it I used melted butter and I didn't have crisp. The second time I made it I used cold butter and cut it with a pastry blender. It was crispy on top but too small of pieces. The next time I make it, I'll cut it with the pastry blender and then grab it and make it chunk together as I spread it over the apples. Also, you can bake the apples while you make the crisp topping and it cuts down on the total time to prepare."
"2","5","This is a great recipe! I also didn't use as much water and only used about six cups of apples. Super yummy."
"2","4","Made this today. Cut the recipe in half but kept the topping the same amounts. Recipe is wonderful but I would recommend that you use double the amount of topping as that is what actually makes apple crisp so great. Thank you for sharing. Will be adding to the menu rotation."
"2","5","First and foremost, thank you for this lovely recipe. My husband pretty much ate half of the casserole dish that I baked it on and he dislikes cinnamon. I pretty much stayed faithful to the recipe but i had to tweak it as I only had 4 apples, (3 fujis and 1 granny smith.) I only put in slightly under half a cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Everything else was the same as instructed and it came out heavenly! Warm and soft on the insides, crumbly and buttery on top. Amazing..."
"2","5","This recipe is great, very simple to make and not really messy. I Know I like my toping thicker so I have to make twice as much. I know this is very sweet and my we are watching our sugar because of diabetes so I used both brown and white sugar replacers."
"2","5","Excellent recipe, and very easy to make."
"2","3","needs to be served warm"
"2","5","Fantastic! Delicious hot, but I served it cold at a party and everyone loved it! They all asked for the recipe."
"2","5","This was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!"
"2","3","This was not that good. I think it's strange that it calls for water. Usually the juice from the apples is enough. Plus, it was way too sweet. I did make two mistakes: I added a little too much water (although as I said, I don't think water is a good idea at all) and I used Red Delicious apples because that's what I had. Tart apples are so much better in apple crisp!"
"2","5","Great recipe. I doubled the topping though. Love it!!!!"
"2","3","great flavor but a bit watery, had a great crispy top the first day right out of the oven but got mushy the next day. will try again but with no water"
"2","5","Made 1.5 times the topping mix, keeping the amount of apples the same. Replaced most of the white sugar with brown sugar. Kept everything else the same. Must use sour apples, or this will be too sweet. Absolutely delicious!!"
"2","5","You cannot go wrong with this recipe- super simple, and absolutely delicious... served with vanilla bean ice cream and it's a winner for any occasion!"
"2","5","Made this incredible dessert for Thanksgiving this year! I double the crumb mixture on top and it came out perfect. Will definitely be using this recipe again!"
"2","5","This is a 5-star dessert that I have made every fall. We use Cortland apples and dark brown sugar, serve it with vanilla ice cream and get rave reviews every time we make it. One tip: don't cook it until you are ready to serve it. Squeeze a little lemon juice over the apples to minimize browning."
"2","5","This was rated by my husband... I made a couple of alterations taking into account a few of the suggestions in a few other reviews. I put the apples in a bowl then put 1/4 cup of water over them, let sit for 5 min. slowly mixed in the dry ingredients and tossed them letting them sit for 30 min. Doubled the mix for layer on bottom, used organic sugar and amish rolled buttered cut in pieces on bottom and top instead of melting it. Also for the crust I finely chopped walnuts and mixed it in well. It was a hit."
"2","5","Yum! I loved it and will make it again soon!"
"2","4","Simple to make. Everyone enjoyed it!"
"2","5","So simple and easy to make! I made this for work, and everyone loved it. It will definitely be a staple in my house!"
"2","5","Delicious!! My first try at apple crisp and it was wonderful. Making it again for Thanksgiving this week. I sprinkled chopped pecans on the apples before adding the crisp layer and it was really good!"
"2","4","The flavor was great, but there was too much crust, not enough apples to me when I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again, just add more apples! Serve with vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","YUM! Easy recipe to follow. Cut back a little on the white and brown sugars - maybe 3/4 cup each. Next time, will cut back to 1/2 cup each. Added a little extra cinnamon - because we love it. Also added a dash of nutmeg to the mix. Will add more oats next time too. Makes a lot - smells wonderful while cooking and tastes delicious. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","Took this recipe to a church gathering. Everyone loved it and it was easy to make. I used a softer apple and decreased the baking time so they wouldn't get to mushy. I prefer the sweetness of a Jonagold, so that's what I used. I also added flax and oat-bran to the topping. So yummy!"
"2","5","I doubled the topping (my favorite part!). It got pretty watery - but I siphoned the extra out. Fabulous!"
"2","5","This is wonderful! I have searched and searched for a good apple crisp recipe and now I have it! I prepared it tonight as written with no changes and my husband and I loved it...it turned out perfectly."
"2","5","This was awesome!! Did nothing different. I will be making this again and again."
"2","5","I made this recipe to take to a church luncheon. Everyone loved it! Thanks for posting this recipe, Diane!"
"2","2","This recipe was ok.... The entire dish came out too SWEET. It probably contains loads of calories and of course sugar!Because vanilla ice cream makes all apple crisps better I thought it was going to be perfect but it turned out to sweet. I could barely eat a slice with vanilla ice cream. Nice try though.:("
"2","5","I made this for dessert tonight and it is FABULOUS. I doubled the topping and placed half on the bottom and half on the top. I forgot the water, but I don't think it was needed. The juice was nice and thick. Made some unsweetened cream to top. Again FABULOUS! Will def make again =)"
"2","5","I read @Ally99's review, added her changes (less water, more crumble) and it was AMAZING. the best review i received from my family over any previous crumble. the only thing i would recommend is not recipe related, but mess related. when i cut butter into things such as pie crumble or crust, i have a surplus box of latex gloves (the thin kind) that i use and put on so that i can crumble and knead the butter into the other dry ingredients w/o getting my hands messy and it works better than any utensil. when done, just peel off and throw away. back to the crumble. it's so good, it's worth adding an extra two miles to the morning run! there's sooooo much butter and sugar!"
"2","4","Like others, I doubled the topping. I also added just a smidge of salt as there was none included on the recipe. Very yummy and I will make it over and over again."
"2","5","This recipe yielded a completely delicious apple crisp! I made a few modifications: 1 - I added a little extra cinnamon, plus some nutmeg, cloves and ginger. 2 - I put this in a deep dish pie dish and it fit perfectly 3 - Usually people recommend Granny Smith or a tart apple for crisp (or most apple recipes). We had Jonagold apples from a recent apple picking trip, which almost taste like pears and just made sure to keep the apples a decent thickness. We peeled the apples, put them through the corer/slicer and then sliced the sections in half. Perfect!"
"2","4","Sweet but good."
"2","4","Like other reviewers I left out the water, and since I cook for two, cut the recipe in half but kept the topping at the full recipe in order to have a higher crisp to apple ratio. Also, I always cook with macintosh apples since my grandma has a few trees in her yard and we have a lot on hand. Remember if you use these apples to use almost twice as many since they are small apples and tend to shrink quite a bit when cooking. I always think my pan is too full but it ends up being just right with 3-4 extra apples thrown in. Finally, the only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is the topping the first time I made it was way too dry, so I cut the flour by a 1/4 cup and I felt it came out perfect the next time."
"2","5","I would have to say this is the easiest and yummiest apple crisp I have ever made.... my new standby! Thank you!!!"
"2","5","I thank you for the recipe. I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake so I made a few changes. I omited the white sugar and water from the apples; I used the juice from 1 lemon, 1/4 cup molasses, and 1/4 cup pure maple syrup. I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar for the crumble. The apple crisp turned out delish!!! I will make it again."
"2","5","First time I ever baked and I agree with many of the tips! Absolutely do not need any water and instead of doubling the topping, I would do 1.5 times the amount, it took a little bit away from the apples. I also used 10 medium sized apples, and it worked out great!"
"2","5","Brought to Green's - Bobby loved."
"2","5","I used cheapo red gala apples and this turned out delicious! I doubled the topping. I would rate this only four and a half stars if I could though. The reason why, is because of the water. I really should have listened to other reviewers when they said if you're going to put the water in, only put a quarter cup!! Especially if you are serving with ice cream. The water makes it soupy!! But after scooping around the water.. It is a delicious, easy recipe!!"
"2","5","I used 10 granny smith apples, doubled the crust to make a top and bottom, added a splash of vanilla to the crust, and added some sprinkles of nutmeg to the apples. It was so delicious. My husband, who is not a fan of desserts, went back for fifths! Everyone loved it!"
"2","5","Perfect! Just what I was looking for. I actually followed this recipe nearly exactly (I estimated the amount of apples)."
"2","5","Excellent! I have never made a crisp with melted butter - but it turned out fabulous! I did cut back on the water by about half. This is my new go to for Apple crisp. thank you"
"2","5","This was so delicious!! I took others advice and halved the water and doubled the topping. I used Golden Delicious apples and they were so good. This was perfectly topped with vanilla ice cream!"
"2","4","My husband is an apple crisp fanatic and he liked this recipe but didn't love it. I found it easy to make and I sure like it especially left over:)"
"2","4","Very good recipe if slightly tweaked. I found it to be overly sweet when I made it by the recipe so when I made it last night I changed a few things and it was perfect! First off, make sure you use granny smith apples.. the more sour, the better. I found that the recipe didn't have enough apples so I added 3 extra cups of apples (roughly about two more large apples). I doubled the crust and didn't add the water as other reviewers said the water is not necessary and just makes this delicious dessert runny. I also cut the white sugar in half, so on top of adding a few more apples.. I found it to be the perfect combo of tart/sweet."
"2","5","IT'S FABULOUS AS IS!!!!!!!!  I agree that changes 'can' be made, but don't have to."
"2","5","Excellent. The classic recipe for Apple Crisp that everyone loves so much this time of year with the cold weather!! Only thing I changed was I doubled the flour, so 2tbsp instead of 1tbsp in the apple mix, and then I added a little vanilla flavoring in the topping mix. Excellent, very very very good, and so simple to make! I used a large pan, 9X13 as in the recipe directions. SO GOOD! Thx for sharing :)"
"2","5","This is a superb recipe! Simple to make and tastes delicious! I used Golden Delicious apples with a sprinkle of lemon juice over them. Doubled the amount of cinnamon. Otherwise no changes to recipe. Fed to my husband and Dad - both said it was by far the best crisp they've ever have. Great job!"
"2","5","I made this for a potluck and told everyone - I'm a great cook! I adjusted the recipe by using cornstarch as the thickener and gluten free bisquick in place of the flour, baking powder, baking soda. The participants at the potluck agreed that I'm a great cook - so thank-you!?"
"2","5","This is the best recipe. Its easy and my family loves it everytime!!"
"2","5","This is the best Apple Crisp recipe I've ever tried. You get a nice thick crumb on the top and a perfect balance of sweet and nutty!  Don't venture from the directions...yes, add the water even though it seemed odd to me...and you'll end up with a fabulous dessert."
"2","5","This was excellent - I used 6 apples and next time I would use 7 as I like a thicker apple base. I mixed the flour/sugar/cinnamon together, added nutmeg, and tossed with the apples. I couldn't decide between the reviews that said to use water or not, so I used 1/4 cup of rum instead and sprinkled it over the apples. I also added nutmeg to the topping and would recommend making 1-1/2 to 2 times the topping. Don't be afraid to cut the apples thicker, they will bake beautifully. Perfection!"
"2","4","This is a very simple and quick recipe. Nice texture to the crumble. I have never poured water in a crisp before, so I was curious. It prevented the apples from drying out, however it created a sauce like bottom (perhaps the type of apple used), which was not what I was hoping for -I prefer pieces of apples to bite into. Also for my personal taste I found this quite a bit too sweet. My husband thought it was a little too sweet as well. But it is a good basic recipe and I will adjust it for our preferences."
"2","5","This lives up to all the great reviews! I made this as part of the refreshments for a Mason's Lodge meeting and they all loved it. I doubled the topping and added dried cranberries. I made this a day ahead and popped it in the oven when I got home from work and it was still warm for after the meeting. Topped it with vanilla ice cream. Served it with cheese and pretzels, apple cider and coffee. This is a keeper!"
"2","5","Per others' suggestions, I cut the water in half, and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. FANTASTIC and easy!"
"2","5","I downsized the recipe by half with the apple mixture but kept the topping the same.. baked it in a smaller pan. Yum and probably the best recipe I have ever made of apple crisp. Will make again!"
"2","3","Not overly fabulous... A little on the dry side- I normally make my apple crisp with just oats, sugar and butter - I think the flour makes it dry-"
"2","5","Awesome recipe! I made this last night on a whim while at my boyfriend's house. I followed the recipe to a T, except for the fact that I didn't use baking powder or baking soda in the crumble simply due to the fact that he didn't have any. It definitely didn't make a difference in the taste or anything. He tasted the finished product and said, 'Wow... you nailed the crispy part.' He then said after he finished the serving that it was the best apple crisp he's ever had in his life. I will defintely be adding this to my recipe box. I also think that I'll refrain from using the baking powder and baking soda next time as well... it was good as is, and I don't want to 'fix' a recipe that already hit a home run. Excellent, excellent recipe."
"2","3","People suggested to double the crumble mixture... are you serious? It was WAY too much! I will half it next time! Also the butter to dry ingredients ratio is off, there should be less flour I think. And the butter should not be melted, as always."
"2","5","Delicious. I am particularly fond of the crisp part so I doubled that. And my apples had been previously frozen, so I think it would've been better if I had added more flour to the apples to soak up more of the juice."
"2","5","Wow! eating this as I type...it's YUMMY! Read reviews so I added nutmeg, pecans, cut sugar in half, no water, cut in the butter instead of melting it. Finally I topped it with vanilla ice cream and it tasted delicious! Thanks for the recipe and the reviewers with suggestions to make it even better!"
"2","4","For this one I use just the topping portion. I added several spices to it, the same ones I use in my apple pie; just less of them, so as to not be overpowering. See my Custom Version...: I added a very little smidge of each of the following: Cinnamon, Allspice, Cloves, Nutmeg and Cardamom. I know, they LOOK like Pumpkin Pie spices, and indeed they are, (minus the Ginger & Mace for mine), but Pumpkin does not have the Cardamom, which in my opinion, makes the apple pie what it truly should be."
"2","5","this was so awesome, but I had to substitute apple juice for water, per the Quaker Oats hotline......gave it even more apple flavor.....my all time fav....."
"2","4","This is a great recipe. I used seven granny smith apples. After seeing how much topping the recipe made I decided it needed a little bit more. I made the topping recipe again but I cut it in half and it was just enough. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out amazing. Next time I will use granny smith apples mixed with a red variety to balance out the tartness. Perfect recipe for a cool fall day!"
"2","5","Nice crunchy topping and good flavor!"
"2","5","I did this in a 8x8 Pan, It took about 4 apples. I stuck with the same measurements for the top layer because I like a thicker top for my apple crisp, It turned out to be the perfect amount."
"2","5","This was very good and I got a lot of compliments on it! I didn't add the water but did add 1 TBSP of lemon juice. I also added nutmeg to the apples. Use tart apples! I did double the crust and I am glad I did. I added cinnamon to the crust also. Plus....I added about 1/2 TBSP of cinnamon candies to the apple mixture. I always do this to apple pie and it makes it 'zing' a little more.......Oh, and I used regular oatmeal instead of quick-cooking oats. It gave it a little more texture."
"2","5","This was the first apple crisp I ever made and I'm glad this was the recipe I used. I made it exactly as followed. I will be making this recipe again and again!"
"2","5","Amazing! Even my husband who will only eat apple pie and says he doesn't like apple crisp, loves this recipe. I can't wait to make it again!"
"2","5","most excellent recipe. Based on other reviews, doubled the topping and for a different touch, used fresh cider instead of water. OMG!"
"2","4","This was very yummy with Jonathan apples, but next time I will cut back on the sugar and leave out the water. It was very sweet and too runny. The topping was fantastic!"
"2","5","it was awsome the whole family loved it the next day i had to make more because it was gone the same day thank you"
"2","4","This is a crowd pleaser!"
"2","5","I added more apples than the recipe called for and less of the sugar mixture. I used the exact amount of water in the recipe and it was perfect! The sugar caramelized and it was yummy :) Will definitely be making this again!!!"
"2","4","This was very good! I made it exactly as described and it turned out great--everyone loved it. Next time I think I will reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup each, like in a batch of chocolate chip cookies. I used nice, tart apples, but for my taste it was still a titch too sweet. However, I had no problem eating it, lol!"
"2","5","Very nice. Couple changes. Added nutmeg to sugar mixture. Added cinnamon to crumble mix and vanilla to the butter. I used Jonathan apples w/full sugar and it was just right. Not too sweet, not too tart. I doubled the crumble. I did add the recommended water (I used my lemon water I soaked the apples in) and I really wasnt anticipating any extra moisture, and maybe I didnt let it set up long enough before I cut it but I could see excess moisture, so I did probably the unthinkable - which was to sort of break up the crumble topping with a fork - just enough to mix slightly with the apples in order to absorb the moisture. I thought it worked great. It tasted great topped with whipped topping."
"2","5","Delicious. I made 1.5x the topping, and halved the water, and enjoyed it that way. Haven't tried the exact recipe, but I can't imagine it would be disastrous. This is just such a solid crisp... cinnamony, crunchy, smooth, absolutely lovely. Top it with some vanilla ice cream."
"2","4","This recipe was delicious! I didn't use the water at all but I think I should've used at least 1/4 cup of water to have a syrop-y consistence. I also added 1/8 teas of nutmeg. I did find that it was more sweet than I anticipated even though I used baking apples. I will use less sugar next time but overall it's a great recipe!"
"2","5","This really is a great recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time will add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and only 1/2 of the water. Everyone that had the apple crisp said it was the best they have ever had."
"2","5","Awesome. I left out the water as others suggested, and found the consistency to be perfect. I used Gala apples and thought it was perfect, though I might try Granny Smiths next time for comparison. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","1","I was so disappointed! This was my first shot at apple crisp and it was just mushy and overly sweet. I had a layer of uncooked topping when I took it out of the oven and mixing it in just made more of the goo."
"2","5","I just made this tonight, just had a peice while it was still warm, wow, very good! I wished I would have read more in depth on the reviews, I did add the 1/2 cup of water, next time I wont do that. A little to watery. Also I didnt have any oats so I did without, still turned out great! Will make again, but without the water, I might also try to add nutmeg, and double the topping mixture. I used fresh apples that I just picked a few days ago, not sure what kind, they were red, turned out great!"
"2","5","I made this recipe tonight and it was AMAZING!! So simple and so much deliciousness! My husband thought it was the best apple crisp he'd ever had and I couldn't agree more. I didn't change a single thing and it was perfect! Will definitely make this again and again."
"2","5","Hubby said this is the best apple crisp he has ever had. I followed the recipe exactly using apples I had on hand. Next time I will probably seek out some really tart baking apples because it was a bit sweet for me. Delicious recipe, thank you!! :o)"
"2","4","Loved this recipe. Just a suggestion that I like to do with any crumble...right when it comes out of the oven sprinkle with 1 to 2 T of Turbinado (natural brown sugar with big sparkly crystals) for a little added visual pizazz and crunch."
"2","5","This recipe is very good! But do not double the topping as I did. I read the reviews and most of them said to double the topping and as this was my first time making apple crisp and I love sweet things I did. Even when I was putting it on I thought wow that looks like alot! It made it way too sweet, and as I said I love sweet things but it was too much. I also didn't melt the butter, just mixed it in until crumbly and that worked great. I mixed the sugar, cinnamon and flour with the apples and as another person said, it draws out the juices of the apples so I only added a splash of water. Yum!!!"
"2","5","This is amazingly good! I listened to another cooks suggestion to cut the amount of water in half, doubled the topping and I mixed 3/4 of it in with the appples, the sprinkled the rest on top. I also cut in softened butter instead of using melted butter. I bakedit for 50 minutes. Turned out soooo good!!!!! Defenately going to be making this recipe a lot!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","5 Stars! Yes the topping was not enough but I will just double it next time. I used granny smith apples (the best for baking) and it was absolutely delicious and so easy to make. It you need a tasty dessert in a flash, THIS IS IT!"
"2","5","i made this recipe last night. I scaled it down to one serving (i had 1 apple i needed to use up) and baked it in a custard cup. Perfect size to split with my man. I did add more cinnamon, and i was kinda concerned after it was done baking it was watery, but letting it sit for a few minutes the 'water' was soaked up. It was very good, very comforting dessert. I can wait till fall. I'll definately make this again."
"2","2","I was not very happy with this recipe even with the adjustments I made. First I used an 8x11 in. pan I cut four large granny smiths and tossed with the sugar/spice mixture (I added 1/4 tsp. Nutmeg to this) then instead of the half cup of water I used one tablespoon vanilla extract and one of water for moisture. This was soooo sweet I can hardly eat it! Also the topping isn't really a crumble it's more like an oatmeal cookie on top which is what I liked least about the recipe. Others have complained of dryness but even using two tablespoons of liquid mine came out very moist I had liquid filling pouring out after the first piece was served. Also I cooked mine for 35 minutes and it seemed overdone to me although my oven is ancient so it doesn't have the most reliable heating mechanism... Overall it was just okay. I won't be making it again because of the sweetness and the cookie like top."
"2","4","I took the advice of others and cut the amount of water to 1/4c. I also cut the sugar to 1/2c and added nutmeg to the mixture. I used an 8X8 pan and my DH and I ate the entire pan late that night. I had to make it again the next day for the kids because I promised they could have some =)"
"2","5","This is a fantastic recipe! I made it last night and brought it over to my parents for a small dinner party they were having and everyone raved about it! It's ridiculously simple too. My sweet man peeled and cut up the apples which made it easier! ha! But he did make wedges versus slices which was good. Also, I doubled the cinnamon and then made another half batch of the topping. Awesome!"
"2","5","Made this exactly as the directions described but used apple wedges instead of slices. It as absolutely delicious!"
"2","5","Kids loved it! I thought it was a bit sweet but putting it with ice cream took away from the sweetness. Great !!"
"2","5","My whole family agreed that this was the best apple crisp recipe I have ever made. And I've made my fair share since we live in the Apple Capital of the World! It is very sweet so use a tart apple like Granny Smith. I follwed the recipe exactly except for using half wheat flour/half white."
"2","5","Don't skip to add water. That's what makes apple slices cooked and moist. Excellent recipe!"
"2","3","I doubled the topping like people said, but it didn't cook right and wasn't something I'd make again. :("
"2","5","This was a hit! I did follow another reviewers idea of doubling the topping, and making a layer on the bottom of the pan, topping with apples, and then another layer on top of the apples. I also like to sprinkle coconut on top, for a little extra flair. I will be making this one again!!"
"2","5","Made this last night for husband and he could not stop giving compliments. The best part is its so easy to make! Im glad I listened to others advice and doubled the topping because it turned out fantastic!.. and of course you must eat this with vanilla ice cream!"
"2","4","As with any apple dessert, the success of this crisp depends upon the variety of apple used. I chose Empire apples -- the recipe's water amount was spot on, but (hindsight) it could have done with less sugar. Still, a very satisfying and comforting dessert."
"2","5","Excellent recipe! Made this for Thanksgiving for family and has been requested non-stop! Followed the recipe exactly expect used 8 granny smith apples, and per other reviews, left out the water, added a little vanilla extract, and doubled the topping."
"2","5","Have been looking for a great apple crisp recipe for a long time and this was awesome! Even got the thumbs up from a group of very picky 4 and 5 year old's! Thank you."
"2","5","I loved this recipe. I substituted 1 tblsp. of ginger instead of using cinnamon. I also let the apples marinate in ginger, lemon+zest, honey, and a dash of salt for about 8 hours. Instead of using 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of the liquid that formed from letting the apples marinate. The flavor was amazing and the end result was a perfect consistency. This is also an easy recipe to convert for people like me who are gluten intolerant. I used a gluten free baking mix instead of flour and Bob's Red Mill gluten free oats."
"2","5","My favourite Apple Crisp recipe to date! Easy and delicious. Thank you. I made it just as the recipe stated."
"2","5","Made this for our family Xmas dinner. AMAZING. Got tons of compliments and my husbanad says it's a full 10 stars, and that's hard to come by in this house! Do add nutmeg. Didn't have a problem with it being too watery w the 1/2 cup water, as it will eventually suck all the liquid up anyways...and also double the topping...it's always better to have too much 'goodness' than not enough!"
"2","5","Easy & yummy!! :)"
"2","5","So easy...and the best I've ever made. Made for family Thanksgiving and even the kids wanted this instead of the cream pies I made."
"2","5","This was excellent & I'm not a real big fan of apple anything!! I had a new 'apple' baking dish that I wanted to use so I'm not sure that I used the entire 10 cups of apples. I did add more cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice to the apples & didn't add the water. Thanks for a wonderful recipe & changing my mind about apples!!"
"2","5","This was my first time making a crisp and I'm hooked on this recipe! A few minor things...I only added 1/4 cup of water and even that was too much for my taste, so next time I wont use any. It was just a bit too sweet(Even with using Granny Smith apples), so I will use 3/4 cup of white sugar next time instead of the full cup. I used self-rising flour and omitted the baking power and soda. Every thing else stayed the same. I will use this every time. So easy, so fast, so good!"
"2","5","mmm another great apple pie! My family gobbled this up. Made as written and I have to agree with it being a little watery but the crisp topping made up for it. So next time I will cut down the water."
"2","5","All I've got to say is Figgen YUM!!! Just cooked this one as a desert to my soon to be famous Shepards Pie and it was every bit worth the effort. Highly recommend it!"
"2","5","I just made this tonight, I had a bunch of apples I needed to use up and couldn't think of another way to use them. I knew I didn't want to make a pie because the crust would be too time consuming. Oh my gosh this was SO GOOD and SO EASY! I'm not really a fan of apple stuff, I prefer berries. But this was amazing! My husband and I were licking our bowls. I used granny smith and golden delicious apples and only changed a few things: I omitted the water, used probably 6 cups or so of apples (I halved the recipe) added a few sprinkles of lemon juice and nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also used raw sugar instead of white refined sugar in the apple mixture. I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping as well. Put in a 9x9 inch glass baking dish and baked for 45 min. It was perfect with a fat blob of fresh whipped cream on top (none of that non-dairy 'whipped topping' for us!) Heaven!"
"2","5","Used 8 large granny smith apples and followed recipe exactly except I added 1 cup chopped walnuts. This is the best thing ever with vanilla ice cream!!"
"2","5","This was really good and easy to make. We served it with vanilla ice cream. I halved the recipe and used 4 apples in a 8x8' pan. I think I might add a bit more melted butter next time, as my crumb topping was kind of dry. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","4","This was terrific, but I changed a few things. First, I cut the sugar in both the filling and the topping by half. I think next time I'll cut it down to 1/3 cup in each, depending on the type of apples I use. If I'm using sweeter apples again I'll also add 1 T. of lemon juice. I doubled the cinnamon (at least), since we all love cinnamon. Next time I think I'll add some nutmeg. I also cut out the baking soda, and didn't melt the butter. Instead I cut the butter into the oat/flour mixture. Oh, and I put 1 t. cinnamon into the topping. My family loved it!"
"2","5","The best apple crisp. To the sugar mixture added nutmeg, tossed with apples then added the water and tossed, put in buttered pan ( made for easy clean up ) doubled the topping spooned on top and baked as directed. Used a 4 pound bag if granny smith apples. It was YUMMY topped with vanilla ice cream. Warmed leftovers on the defrost setting of microwave next day. Keeper ! Thanks for a great recipie."
"2","4","This is so good! I changed it a bit by adding half of all of the topping, and putting some on the bottom too. Definitely recommended."
"2","1","got no comments from my critics..(my family) so its not to be repeated i guess.."
"2","5","Phenomenally tasty with a scoop of ice cream, and easy to make. I've made this several times and every time it has been a huge hit."
"2","5","love it. have made three times in a week, though the second two times were smaller portions, heh. 4 cups of apples and double the equiv. of topping fits perfectly into a 9 inch pie pan. sez boyfriend: 'YUUUMMMMMMM.'"
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I used 3 large Granny Smith apples which equalled just under 5 cups peeled, cored and sliced into fairly thin slices; prepared 1/4 cup wite sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, 1/2 tsp. cinammon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and combined carefully; NO WATER; Mixed the apples with the sugar/flour mixure coating them evenly and placed the apples in a 9x13 pan; Doubled the topping as others suggested combining it well however I used cold butter cut into small cubes and mixed it together and then spread evenly over the apple mixture in the pan; Baked at 350 degrees for 45 - 50 minutes. Absolutely delicious! Best apple crisp I ever made and will definitely make again for company. Thank you so much."
"2","5","This. Was. FANTASTIC. I only made a few alterations, based on what I had on hand. First, I love cinnamon with my apples, so I increased from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon. I probably didn't use 10 cups worth of apples, because I only have 5 apples on hand. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white, as I was out of white flour. SO FANTASTIC! Probably one of the best desserts I've made in a long time. YUM!"
"2","1","Way too sweet - too much sugar in topping and mixture for apples."
"2","4","I am giving it 4 stars because I made it exactly as the recipe called for. The topping is definitely a 5 though!! I will make this again, but will omit the water as others suggested. I will also cut the sugar to 3/4 C. since it was a bit sweet to me. I used a mix of fresh apples from the orchard, so not exactly sure what all I used."
"2","5","OMG! So good...I cut the water in half and it was gooey and delicious. Served with Haagen dazs vanilla ice cream. SO RICH, but yummy!"
"2","4","I thought this was a tasty classic version of an Apple Crisp, however, if you aren't using a tart baking apple like a Granny Smith, the sugar should be decreased a bit- maybe a 1/4 cup. I used Fugi's because it's what I had, and it was a tad too sweet. And I think next time I will put the 9x13 with the aaples only in the oven to bake for 10 min or so, and then remove and add the crumble part, so the apple get nice and soft while the crumble doesn't get too dark."
"2","5","awesome flavor! After you have the apples peeled & sliced, very quick & easy to make. Could maybe double the topping? No need to ad water."
"2","5","Delicious! I would agree with some of the others that it didn't need the water. I would cut down to 1/4 cup or none next time. Mine was a little runny, but I just spooned out excess liquid after I took the first piece out. Will definitely make again!"
"2","5","This was absolutely delicious! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream, which just put it over the top. I did have to guestimate the pounds of apples because I only made a third of it. It still turned out perfect and will definitely be made again this Fall. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","I followed the advice of many reviewers who doubled the crust and eliminated the water. I also tossed my apples in the sugar and cinnamon mixture. My apple crisp turned out perfect. It was so delicious fresh out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. A lovely fall dessert."
"2","5","This is one of my favorite recipes. My husband has me make this for his crew at work at least 4 times a year. I get plenty of 'will you make this again', always a crowd pleaser. I double the crumble, it makes it a little more chewy."
"2","5","Absolutely delicious. I doubled the topping."
"2","5","I'm new to cooking and baking. I made this recipe last week, and it was AWESOME!! The hardest part was literally the cutting of the apples, which left me with not one, but two cuts on my thumb. Totally worth it. I wanted to make more the second I ate the last bite."
"2","5","Made this for the second time today at the request of my husband for Father's Day. This is really a great recipe. I used 6 Grannysmith apples and 2 Braeburn. Added only 1/4 cup water, but followed the recipe and it turned out great again. This will be my go-to Apple Crisp recipe from now on."
"2","5","Great recipe! After reading other reviews, I also omitted the water and instead of dumping in the mixture for the apples, I mixed it together in a bowl beforehand. I bought a bag of Granny Smith apples and used all of them, I believe it was about 10 apples. Shared some with friends and they loved it also! Will def. make for the holidays!"
"2","3","Not the best apple crisp I've had but it is pretty good. A little too watery for my taste. I suggest omitting the water."
"2","5","This is the only recipe you will ever need for Apple Crisp! By far the BEST you'll EVER eat. I have made this several times and there is no need to change a thing - the ONLY thing I do different is to double the topping because I just can't get enough of that crispy topping."
"2","5","Delicious! Followed other reviews and decreased the water to about 1/4 cup. Added a bit more oats and flour and butter to the topping as it didn't seem like enough for the amount of apples I was using (6 apples). Also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the apple mixture. I mixed the apple mixture all together in a bowl then put it in the pan before topping it with the topping. Will make again."
"2","3","It was alright, but the topping was very dry and almost powdery. I will try adding more butter or use less flour next time."
"2","4","Great everyone love it . I just used half the sugar, and and smaller pan , and some nutmeg."
"2","5","This apple crisp is fantastic! One of the best I've had. I did not think the topping needs to be doubled - but I guess that's my personal preference. Pretty much made the recipe as stated, and turned out perfect. Served with whipped tpping - thanks for this awesome recipe!"
"2","5","I used granny smith apples. Turned out perfect. Very yummy!"
"2","5","By far the best apple crisp recipe! The topping is so yummy, crunchy with carmelization. I used triple the cinnamon from my cinnamon grinder for extra flavor. I also had to bake for an hour to get the apples to be soft. It was heavenly with vanilla ice cream. The hard part is not eating a gluttonous amount, as it's so yummy, it's hard to put the spoon down!"
"2","4","Delicious! 4 stars because my topping was not crunchy. I actually had to mix it towards the end because i could still see flour!!! i added little bit more water. Thank you!!!"
"2","3","This was good but not great. I'll keep looking for a good apple crisp recipe. Needed more cinnamon and possibly some nutmeg."
"2","5","Yummy. It's a little sweet, but with a little ice cream or whipped cream it great. I followed instructions exactly, but I threw in a bag of frozen cranberries. Used some embarrassingly old spy apples that were about to be dead."
"2","5","I'd never made apple crisp before, and decided to give this recipe a try. Not only was it easy, it was DELICIOUS! I've made seven batches (fourteen pie pans!) of this in the past two weeks because my friends and family keep asking for it. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!"
"2","5","this is my first review on here, but i just had to write something! I'm a big fan of apple crisp so I'm a tough one to please when it comes to recipes. I've tried a whole bunch of recipes on this website but this is the only one i've found so far that deserves a review! GREAT RECIPE! Very easy, inexpensive... i did cut the sugar down by half...it was definitely a smart choice because the sweetness of the delicious is more than enough. Also cut down a bit on water but kept everything else in the recipe the same. If you are making it in a pyrex, its a lot of surface to cover so i would consider making double the amount of topping to ensure each section of the apple base is deliciously covered!"
"2","5","This review is for the topping only. I had put up apples in my freezer so I used them. Delicious topping. Followed recipe exactly."
"2","5","I pride myself on baking and I do alot. This IS the best apple crisp i have ever had. My husband gave it a 12 out of 10. I too doubled the topping and i added some nutmeg with the sugar and cinnamon. Other than that i changed nothing and it is AWESOME. Green apples are definitely the way to go."
"2","5","I made this apple crisp for a coworker's birthday, and it was excellent. I used Granny Smith apples--I bought six huge ones and ended up using five-and-a-half of them. My only addition to the regular recipe was to include 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg as some other reviewers suggested. The nutmeg addition added a noticeable spiciness to the crisp, but I think it would be terrific without the nutmeg and plan to try it that way next time. I also filled the bowl with my apple slices with water and a bit of lemon juice while I sliced the apples. I'm not sure if the lemon transferred at all to the finished dish, most likely not, but it did help keep my earliest slices from getting overly brown as I sliced the rest. All in all, I would definitely make this recipe again, and I highly recommend it. It continued my reputation for baking good things, and I didn't have to cart any leftovers home. Who doesn't appreciate that?"
"2","4","not bad at all! Followed other readers advice and cut the water down to 1/4 cup, and only 1/2 a cup of sugar. Also I didn't use 10 cups of apples, just 6 cups and it worked out well. I will make this again forsure."
"2","4","I made a few minor adjustments - I mixed the apples with the sugar mixture before placing them in the pan, then sprinkled with extra cinnamon. I did not add the water because I thought it would be too runny. It turned out great, will make it again."
"2","5","This was the hit of all the Christmas Day desserts. I tweaked the topping just a bit by using 1 1/2 c. of oatmeal, chopped walnuts and some nutmeg. The topping was a bit dry. I think the extra oatmeal was unnecessary. Very good though. Oh, I did leave out the water in the apples."
"2","5","Awesome! I followed the advise of others and omitted the water and added nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar. I tossed about 1 tblsp. of lemon juice in the apples before putting them in the mixture, and doubled the topping. It is perfect!"
"2","5","Delicious! Only needs a little bit of cinnamon and double the crust."
"2","5","Wow is this good! Per many reviews, I added 1/4c water, doubled the topping and cut in the butter cold rather than melting. Also added 1 c chopped pecans to the topping which is a must if you like nuts! I used both quick cooking and regular rolled oats and it worked fine!!"
"2","5","It was great!! for Diabetics I substituted applesauce for the white sugar, splenda for the brown sugar and applesauce for the butter. And it tasted restaurant style."
"2","5","I really enjoyed my first attempt at this. As with some of the other reviews, I doubled the crust and put some at the bottom and some at the top. I also tossed the apples with the cinnamon sugar mix (and added nutmeg). I omitted the water - but really on accident (had it ready but forgot), and it turned out well. I mixed everything in for the crust (and added 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the crust). I also used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar (so, doubled the crust, but didn't double the brown sugar). Them I poured in most of the melted butter (reserved around 1/4th of the 1 cup). With doubling the crust, I put more of it on the bottom (60% or so) than on the top. Then before I added the crumbled crust to the top, I mixed in the additional butter. This came out great. I look forward to trying it again (I'll add Chinese 5 spice next time!!)."
"2","5","this is WAY better than my old apple crisp recipe. i used 5 granny smith apples and 5 cortland apples. i tossed the apples in the sugar mixture. i also added some nutmeg, and reduced water to 1/4 cup. it was not watery at all, but i think it would have been with the full amount. increased topping to double the amount. the topping was REALLY good. very pleased, thank you!"
"2","5","THis is the one to make. Not too sweet or labor intensive. Quick, easy and great with vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","It was even better with homade caramel sauce"
"2","5","I can stop looking - this is the best apple crisp I have ever made. I used a little less water and added a pinch of nutmeg to the apples, but other than that didn't change a thing. This is now my go-to recipe whenever I need to make apple crisp. Thanks!!!"
"2","5","I have made this 2 times on 1 week! I LOVE it! The only change I made was not using any water. The juices from the apples were enough to keep it moist. I think the water would have made it too runny."
"2","5","This was a delicious and easy recipe!!! I used the tip from another review and used 1/4 cup water and double the topping. I used granny smith apples and tossed them in the flour/sugar/cinnamon mix before spreading them in the pan. Once in the pan i then sprinkled the water over the apples. I also used nutmeg and instead of the melted butter i used cold butter and cut it into the topping mix to ensure a crumbly topping and it worked great!!!! Hope my tips helped!!!!! I will make this recipe again~it was flawless!!!!"
"2","5","I have been looking for a good apple crisp recipe for a while. In my search I have tried a few good ones, but this one is the clear winner. It is so simple, and all the ingredients are something most people are likely to have on hand. I didn't have as many apples as the recipe called for (about half), but based on the many reviewers who doubled the toppings, I decided to keep the toppings the same. It was so delicious. The toppings melt and brown into caramelly crispy goodness, that is just heavenly with the apples. I have found my crisp recipe. I will be making it with pears tomorrow. Thanks!"
"2","5","I had apple juice, so I used it instead of the water. WOW! I have made this twice in the last three days and am making it again today--I think I will make more topping this time."
"2","5","The Hubs loved it!"
"2","4","Loooove this!I used 6 granny smith apples and piled them in a pie plate rather than a 9x13 dish. Instead of butter I used Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks. Worked great! The topping turns out nice and crunchy and I threw in some salt, cinnamon and nutmeg for a little added spice. I also reduced the sugar in the apples to 3/4 cup since the topping is very sweet. Probably could even do with only 1/2 cup sugar. My apples were very tart and the crisp still came out nicely sweet, almost a bit too much. Definitely do not add any water..the juice from the apples combined with the sugar is more than enough to make a beautiful filling. I love this recipe..it's so easy and came out great..fool-proof baking instructions as well. Thanks!"
"2","5","Made this to the recipe. Everyone raves about this one. The topping is fantastic! I am always looking to use up the apples off the tree this time of year. The added water was way too much for me. It may be the type of apple used. The filling part of the crisp is not bad. Needs more cinnamon and sugar for my apples. All in all, good recipe, I'll adjust and make again, thanks."
"2","5","I only used about a 1/4C. of water and did 1 1/2 times the crust. I partially melted my butter but then worked it in with a pastry blender... REALLY REALLY GREAT!!! Great crunch with a carmel taste to the mixture, a fantastic recipe!"
"2","5","Great recipe! I took some suggestions and doubled the topping the first time I made it but my husband said 'It would be perfect if you would just cut the topping in half' lol so next time I made it, I followed the recipe to a T and it was great. Thank you!!"
"2","5","This is the BEST apple crisp ever! I did double the topping, added 1 tsp of nutmeg, & no water. This is amazing! I wish I wouldn't have offered any to my neighbors, as now it is almost gone! This will be the only apple crisp I will make in the future."
"2","5","EXCELLENT. Followed recipe exactly, it was a hit and several have asked me for the recipe. Served with vanilla ice cream...mmmm..."
"2","5","Absolutely wonderful...I used Jonagold apples I got from Walmart...they are a kind of Johnathan Apple..because Jonagold is a juicy apple I didn't add any water to the recipe and like some of the reviews are saying DON'T double the topping part...in my opinion it would definitely overwhelm the apples and dish would be way way too sweet. Except for ommiting the water and adding four tablespoons of flour to the apples {because Jonagold apples are so juicy) I followed the recipe as written. It turned out perfectly... Will definitely make again...I served the Apple Crisp with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...Yummmy.... Thank you so much for such an easy AND great recipe."
"2","5","This is by far the best crisp recipe I have tried yet; the right amount of everything, but I did add a teaspoon of nutmeg; so yummy! Goes perfect with vanilla ice cream. Thanks Diane - this one is going in the 'Family Faves' box for sure!"
"2","4","One of the best tasting ansd easiest to make Apple Crisp recipe. Rare does this last more than a day or two in the house."
"2","5","This is a delicious apple crisp! My husband even told me it was better than his mothers! I think it was even better the day after I made it."
"2","5","super easy. i halved the water and mixed the apples with sugar before laying them in the pan. my mom devoured the entire pan within two days! didnt even need ice-cream but i could see how if it was available, it would be heaven in a bowl. besides the melted butter, the recipe isnt all that bad for you either!"
"2","5","This is the best apple crisp I have had. I mixed the apple slices with the cinnamon and sugar instead of sprinkling it over the top. I also added a pinch of salt to the cinnamon sugar mixture. Doubling the topping is a must!"
"2","5","THE BEST APPLE CRISP!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","This was great! I made this yesterday to take to a party last night, I am so glad I picked this recipe (I've never made an apple crisp before). It was one of the first desserts gone! My little changes were : Only used 1/4 c water, cut white sugar down to maybe 3/4 c, added a little vanilla and couple shakes of cinnamon to the topping. Added a little nutmeg to the apple mix, which I shook all that up with the apples instead of sprinkling on top. Still have apples left and thinking about making again :)"
"2","5","Great recipe!! Can use this if you are short on apples. I used only 5 cups of apples, but used the same amount of topping. The extra 'crisp' MADE this dessert."
"2","5","Loved this recipe, I halved it because we are only with the 3 of us at home. So easy to make, it was gone in no time!"
"2","5","Followed recipe exactly!!! It is just absolutely perfect as it is, no messing with it, OH, except I did add some nutmeg to the apples mixture and again in the topping. THEN I discovered we have a 'rat' in the house when I went to check on it to see if it had cooled off (after movie had ended, I had taken it out of the oven during the movie 'Hero') - a big HUGE corner (like... 1/8 of the entire pan) had been sneaked into and eaten while I was using the restroom after the movie!!! A 2-armed, 2-legged 'rat' who has claimed he doesn't like desserts!!! *lol* So, I had to try it too, I ended up eating the other 1/8 of the same end of the pan. Wonderful recipe, I'll have to make another dessert tomorrow (this was supposed to be for a Women's Conference tomorrow - will make another one!)"
"2","4","Very good recipe. I used cortland apples. When I make the recipe again I will reduce the sugar in the apples. It was a little too sweet."
"2","5","Perfect as is! Will absolutely make again! Delicious!"
"2","5","Very good. When I took it out of the oven I thought it was going to be too runny but after it cooled all of the juice thickened into a nice moist crisp. I added cinnamon into the topping but otheriwse made the recipe as stated."
"2","5","This is the most delicious apple crisp my husband and I have ever had! I'm 29 and this was my first attempt at making apple crisp ever and obviously it turned out great. The only thing I did different to the recipe was add the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in with the cinnamon and double the crust, like some of the other reviewers had suggested. My husband and I really love a lot of crust on apple crisp-this is the only reason I decided to double it."
"2","5","This is a great recipe! Here's the approach I took: I used a combination of whatever apples I had on hand, as well as a handful of Craisins. I opted not to peel the apples. I really liked the added color and texture! I forgot to add the 1/2 c of water before cooking, and the crisp looked a bit dry around the 40 minute mark, so I went ahead and poured it in around the sides of the crisp. I also poured an extra 1/2 c of melted butter over the top at that same point to help the top crisp. Total cooking time came to around 55 minutes. Served hot with vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it!"
"2","5","Definitely the BEST apple crisp I've ever had! I followed some suggestions, I only used 5 Granny Smith apples, in an 8x8 inch pan. (So I halved the recipe, except for the crust.) We loved having a nice thick crust. Oh, and we didn't add any water, added some nutmeg, and it came out perfect! Thank you Diane!"
"2","5","I volunteered to make apple crisp to bring to a friend's cookout. I found this recipe and made it just as it was written and it was a hit with everyone. Next time I think I will leave out the water because I'm not sure what it adds if you have juicy apples. I used a combination of Granny Smith and fuji apples. We served it at room temperature and it was delicious."
"2","5","VERY good. I make this often"
"2","5","What a yummy recipe! I did not change a thing, but will only add a couple tablespoons of water next time, as oppossed to the 1/2 cup that is called for. I used early season Macintosh apples, as we have a ton of them right now here in Michigan. They have the perfect tart flavor to compliment the sweetness of this recipe. I will definitely be making this again and again!"
"2","5","Absolutely the best apple crisp! I've only tried one other apple crisp from this site....this one blows it away! I made some caramel sauce (from Sweetened Condensed Milk) and drizzled it over the top when the crisp had about 15 minutes left to bake. This is a keeper! Thanks, Cyndi Gephart for telling me I had to try this one."
"2","5","This was AWESOME! I doubled the oatmeal part and it worked great. YUM!"
"2","5","Mmmmm, love this from the top to the bottom. My suggestion is to use two different apples. One sweet and one a bit tart. We enjoyed."
"2","5","OMG it was amazing, i doubled this and made a huge pan of it. and with a house full of company ppl ate it the next day for breakfast heated with a little milk on it."
"2","5","Great! I added a dash of vanilla extract & nutmeg. Also added additional cinnamon to both apples and topping!"
"2","5","This will be my apple crisp recipe from now on. It is soooo good. Read a lot of reviews and ended up with these simple alterations. I skipped the water (although how could a little more goop be bad!). I added 1/4 cup lemon juice to the apples. I added a pinch of salt to the crumb topping mix and just cut in softened butter. I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Great recipe! We really enjoyed this dessert. I halved the amount of sugar and I think it would have been too sweet for us if I have added all the amount of sugar."
"2","5","Add bourbon."
"2","5","I used a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice for the spices, and just used a sprinkle of water on the apples. Other than that as written, awesome recipe -- best apple crisp I ever made, thanks!"
"2","5","Fabulous! I made 1/2 the recipe and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and followed the recipe. Granny Smith apples were tart with the crisp sweet and a little crunchy. Next time I may add a little extra sugar over the apples and a little more water to get more 'sauce' and the crisp was so good I'll have to increase that! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","4","I really liked this recipe but only gave it 4 stars. My reason why is the amount of sugar. Being an award winning cook myself, I realized that this is way too much sugar. When using granny smith apples, I cut both the white and brown sugar in half. It was plenty sweet and more carb friendly. I also used Apple Pie Spice instead the cinnamon. With some adjust to this recipe for your own personal taste, this can be a tasty crisp."
"2","5","Amazing..If you like very sweet apple crumbles that are easy to make this is it"
"2","5","I halved the apple filling, but made the full crumb recipe. Also, I decreased the water by a little bit as a result of the reviews I read. The result was great."
"2","5","My children ages 4 and 7 made this with supervision. It was fabulous!"
"2","5","I made it exactly as the recipe stated and thought it was awesome. I served it warm over french vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","Very good. All my colleagues were clamouring for more... might want to reduce the white sugar in the apples though, I reduced to 1/3 cup and it was still nice."
"2","5","excellent. rave reviews from friends. they practically licked the dish.definately a keeper."
"2","5","Very good, but also very sweet the way it is written. The 2nd time I made it, I added 3-5 cups extra apples and it was outstanding. Also sliced apples VERY thin with mandoline."
"2","4","This was very tasty overall & it went over well with my small group - they cleared the dish! Next time, I'll double the topping portion, especially if using a 9x 13 pan - this barely covers the top. I used mostly Granny Smiths (great for this since they don't get too mushy & keep some of their firmness) & a few Rome's. This recipe is a keeper!"
"2","5","This recipe got great reviews from my friends and family. I made it twice in one week! I doubles the crust and put a layer on the top and bottom. I tossed the apples with the apple mixture in a large bowl before putting it into the pan. I added half the water the recipe calls for because the apple mixture seemed to create enough moisture. I also used granny smith apples as recommended by others.I will definitely be making this again!"
"2","5","I added LESS sugar, a bit of nutmeg, and more cinnamon to the apples, then added some 'craisens' (cranberry raisens) because I like the tartness - - yummy - even my super picky Mother asked for the recipe. A keeper for sure - even better the next day warmed up."
"2","5","I thought this recipe was the greatest. I was looking for a simple yet delicious recipe. And i found it right here!i made it in the early afternoon and until the night was over the whole pan was gone and the family loved it,they wanted to know when i was gonna make more. Thank You for the delicious recipe"
"2","4","Standard apple crisp. Nothing special, but still very good!"
"2","5","I have made this several times and it is absolutley delicious! I doubled the crust on top and put very little water in the apples. The apples create enough of their own juices."
"2","4","I will be using this apple crisp recipe from now on..but with these modifications: 1/2 C sugar w/ the apples - this is plenty unless you have a serious sweet tooth. Mixed the cinnamon/sugar/flour w/ apples before putting in the pan - it draws out the juices. Omitted the 1/2 C water, just sprinkled a little over the apples since the only time I've used water with apples was to make applesauce and even then, not very much. Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the topping. Results were delicious...YUM"
"2","5","Have mercy...this is the BEST crisp EVER!! I pretty much followed the recipe to the T...I just added 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar to apples. Along with cinnamon and nutmet and a dash of vanilla! I then doubled the topping. I put a little on the bottom then layered the apples, then finished off with the rest of the topping!! GOOD EATING...then topped it with fresh vanilla ice cream!! You can't beat this!! Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe."
"2","5","I love this recipe! Since discovering it last week, I have made it 4 times and it never lasts more than a few hours. I did make a few minor changes though...I mix the sugar, flour and 1.5 tsp of apple pie spice (in place of the 1 tsp of cinnamon)and mix the apples in it instead of sprinkling it over. I also omitted the water. No need for it.  I love the crumb topping so the first time I doubled the recipe, per some other reviewers advice and I thought it was incredible, but my family thought it to be too much crumb topping to apple filling ratio. So now I make it according to the recipe instead of doubling it. There is still plenty of topping and my family eats it up just as fast, if not faster!!"
"2","5","We are invited to one of my first extended family 'inlaw' parties. Everyone must bring a 'fall' dish to share and I'm a little nervous. My husband and dear neighbors have been sampling apple desserts all week. This was the unanimous winner. In fact my neighbor just printed off the recipe to make for her family. It is excellent. Especially the topping. I only made a few changes. I substituted apple cider for the water and cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup because of that. If you like cider it really gives the recipe a little extra zip. Thank you."
"2","5","This was awesome- empty pan already!  I followed other suggestions: doubled topping, adding some cinnamon, and nutmeg. I mixed green and red apples, and the red were mushy. I've already been asked to make it again. It is very easy to make, I used the little gadget that slices/cores apples in one action, then peeled the 8 little slices separately, it went very fast that way."
"2","4","This is wonderful! I halved the sugar and upped the spices (added ginger, nutmeg, cloves). I used whole wheat flour, added a bit of lemon juice and some blackstrap molasses. It is SO good, we've already almost eaten all of it."
"2","4","This apple crisp was ok. I wasnt crazy over it or nothing. I wanted to try one that takes oatmeal. I think I will go back to my mom recipe for Apple Crisp."
"2","5","I made this for the first time tonight, exactly as the recipe states, and we thought it was DELICIOUS!"
"2","5","by far, the best apple crisp recipe i have ever encountered. words can't even describe."
"2","5","Apples have been my 'thing' lately, due to a trip to a local orchard. My boyfriend and I have them for every meal! He is a huge fan of desserts, and this was PERFECT to satisfy his sweet tooth. The only thing I changed was adding about a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Will DEFINITELY use this again! Thanks!"
"2","5","My preschooler went on an apple-picking field trip and came home with a huge bag of orchard fresh apples. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could--it was so good!! I'm not sure what kind of apples they were but they were very firm and a little tart so I added the full amount of sugar. I read several reveiws that debated the amount of water to add or to even add any at all. I finally settled on an idea from another baked apple dessert I've made, orange juice. Since there are only two adults in my house eating this I mixed up the apples with the sugar mixture in one big bowl, squeezed in the juice from half of a very juicy orange and even threw in about a tsp of orange zest. Then I dumped a third of the apples in a pie plate and the other two thirds into an 8x8 pan. I made about 1 1/2 times the crumb topping, topped both pans, then I froze one pan and baked the other. This dessert was WONDERFUL. I let it rest for 10-15 minutes, topped it with a big scoop of ice cream and drizzled caramel over it all. Almost worth skipping dinner for!!!"
"2","5","I was so hungry for apple crisp and this was perfect. I had sweet juicy apples (lots!) so I decreased the amount of plain white sugar and water and it came out just right. Filled the pan perfectly, just the right amount of topping. Easy enough for the kids to help with and delicious right out of the oven with ice cream. Will definitely use this recipe again."
"2","4","Absolutely yummy. In reality I would have to give the Crisp at 4.5. I used a melange of apples - Fugi, Gala, and Granny Smith. Each has a different texture and taste. I doubled the topping as others have mentioned and decreased the water to 2 tablespoons. I believe I might increase the cinnamon to 1 1/4 teaspoons the next time I make it."
"2","5","very good, tasty, simple. I liked the soft apples under the crunchy topping. Adding the water did that, but it really depends on the wetness of your apples if it gets mushy."
"2","5","As i read previous review, i made slight changes for this recipe. I cut half amount of sugar for the crisp and only use 1/4 cup sugar for the apple filing (I convert all white sugar into brown sugar). Add generous cinnamon & nutmeg plus i mix raisins which i'd soak in them in rum overnight. IT really brings out the rich flavor! Also i didn't melted the butter, just mix them with dry ingredients until crumbled. One more thing, i use corn flour for the filling mixture, not all purpose flour..I learn this while making apple pie filling, since i like the texture i use it for this recipe too..Don't forget to double the crisp recipe, it won't cover all the surface if you use the original recipe..I also spread a thin layer of the crisp batter before topping them with the filling..Enjoy em with ice cream, Hemmmmmm...Marvelous!!! Note: Use Grainy Smith apples and to save time, just put them in the food processor."
"2","5","With the cool fall air moving in, I had been craving apple cobbler or crisp. I wanted to try a new recipe and WOW, was this amazing. I made it as written with one modification. I only used 1/4 cup of water. I didn't have ice cream so I topped it with fresh whipped cream and it was delicious. Thank you!!"
"2","5","This is sooo good!!!! I couldn't wait till it was done. The aroma was to dye for. I did make a few changes. Because I used frozen apples, I omitted the water and I added nutmeg. I will be making this again."
"2","5","Really really good! Everyone seems to have differing opinions on whether water should be used or not but I think it depends on the juiciness of your apples. If you cut up your apples and they seem a bit dry, use a little water. If they seem very wet and juicy, don't use it. I used gala apples and I also had some leftover homemade cranberry sauce that I added between my apple mixture and crumble mixture. Gala are sweet apples and the cranberry sauce offset that very nicely! I added the bit of nutmeg to the apples as another reviewer suggested, but stuck to the recipe otherwise and it was FABULOUS! Me and my husband ate two bowls each, warm and topped with vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","wow, this crisp is amazing, left out the water,wished I put it in now, I cut the apples a little to think so it took a bit longer to cook, over all it was wonderful, will make over and over. Thank you for the great recipe"
"2","4","It was good but seemed to be missing something. I might try adding lemon juice next time to give it a little zing."
"2","5","Very good recipe!"
"2","5","Wonderful as is! Even with the water added it still turns out great. When first served after baking it may seem a bit runny but the following day after it sets it is amazing!!! I tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and added more cinnamon to that. I also added some cinnamon to the topping. My husband says it's the best crisp I've ever made. Thank you!"
"2","4","This was excellent. Not exactly sure that I would add the water again - don't know that it served any purpose except to make it mushy. I did want it to be alittle firmer if that makes sense... but the flavor was incredible."
"2","5","I've just began cooking for a household of 8 and this is one of the more popular recipes. There's a taste for everyone. My fiancee (who thinks apple pie is too terribly sweet) loves this. He had 3 plate fulls before he stopped! His brothers and sisters loved this, too. As everyone else, I did some tweaking: I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, and apple pie spice. I also added some maple syrup to give it a 'warm flavor.' As always, I microwave before serving and toss some cool whip on top. I eyeballed the amounts, added to taste (if you do this, make extra apple so you won't be subtracting from the dish). *Note: Add some fresh ginger if you want a little spice to the dish. Ginger blends amazingly well with the flavors and whatever cream used to compliment this (milk, ice cream, cool whip) will be enhanced with the ginger."
"2","4","I tried this the way most did - 1/2 the water, added nutmeg and doubled the topping. I also added pecans to the top. Next time I will add the pecans to the dry mix and butter first because the pecans were just really dry on top. I may also try to cut the butter instead of melting. I also, like most, mixed the apples with the sugar mix before putting it in the pan. I think the flavor was really good until I added the ice cream. That I don't recommend!"
"2","5","Review #1206, huh? Well, as if another 5 stars really matters, this is a GREAT recipe! I followed the recipe *exactly* as written and it was just lovely. The apples were delicious and perfectly baked. The topping was crisp and delectable. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Thanks so much!"
"2","5","This recipe is truly wonderful! But I did take some advice from other reviewers and also did some changes of my own, here is what I did: First of all I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings because 12 would have been too much. I doubled the recipe for the crumb topping (do not melt the butter all of the way, only have the butter partially melted, you will have a crispier topping this way) and I put about a 1/3 cup of the crumb topping on the bottom of the baking pan (before putting the apples in) or put in just enough to coat the bottom. For the apples I mixed together the cinnamon mixture with the apples in a bowl so that the apples were evenly coated. Once I had everything assembled I cut up 1 tablespoon of butter into pieces and placed it on top of the crumb topping. I baked it for almost an hour and it came out perfect! Enjoy! 03/31/08: You can make this in advance. I made two batches and baked them the next day at work and they turned out great!"
"2","5","I tried to incorporate some of the suggestions of other reviewers; used Granny Smith apples, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, added some nutmeg, and doubled the crust for one on the bottom and one on the top. Wish the topping was crispier. I think next time I'll use a little more apples too. It was gone in no time! The next time I cut the white sugar to 1/2 c., because I only had a couple Granny Smith and the rest Fuji. I cut the cinnamon to just over 1/2 tsp., because a whole tsp. just seemed to overwhelm the other flavors, and left out the nutmeg. I softened the butter and cut it into the rest of the crumble ingredients then stirred in about 3/4 c. chopped pecans, because we love pecans in everything! Also after placing half the apple mixture in the baking dish I sprinkled a layer (about 14-15 oz.) of fresh cranberries, then the remaining apples and crumble topping. It looked really pretty through the sides of the clear glass baking dish. Sooooooo delicious too; especially warm with some really good vanilla icecream on top. I highly recommend this recipe with or without the cranberry layer."
"2","5","I must agree with the majority of the people on this dessert. It was perfect! I used 8 granny smith apples and sliced them thinly in the food processor. I tossed the apples in the sugar mixture just to coat them, and omitted the water. I also doubled the crust recipe and put half on the bottom, then the layer of apples, then the other half on the top. It was wonderful! Served with cold vanilla bean ice cream and a cup of smooth coffee. Mmm good!"
"2","5","This was easy to make and it was so deliciouse. I ate it with vanilla icecream."
"2","5","Loved this recipe, but changed the following. Substituted 1 cup of splenda for the white sugar and used the splenda brown sugar mix (1/2 cup) instead of regular brown sugar. Also cut the water in half. Turned out great and didn't taste sugar free at all."
"2","5","I used 1/4 a cup of water and coated the flour mixture. For the topping, I added 1/4 a teaspoon of nutmeg, and used regular oats, as I did not have quick cooking oats. It still turned out great!"
"2","5","DELICIOUS APPLE CRISP! I used a bag of Empire red apples (Granny Smith's are too bitter for me) and it came out great! My only changes after reading reviews from others: I used 1/4 cup of water instead of the recommended 1/2 cup. I also added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and instead of sprinkling the sugar, flour, cinnamon mixture over the apples, I coated the apples in the mixture to make sure that they were well blended. This Apple Crisp recipe is delicious and I will definitely use it again!"
"2","5","There are two 'Apple Crisp II' recipes on allrecipes.com. I've tried both, and prefer this one much more. Simple, crowd-pleasing, delicious!"
"2","5","This was really good! I couldn't imagine leaving the water out, because it really makes a nice sauce for the apples. If you want more of a crumb topping, cut the amount of butter in half, and don't melt the butter, just soften it a bit. Cut the butter into the flour/oat mixture with a pastry cutter until you have incorporated it throughout and it resembles coarse crumbs. I used three Gala apples, thinly sliced and left the skin on. Didn't see the need to go through the effort of peeling. Then I cut the amount of the ingredients to go with the apples in half. Used the same amount of ingredients for the topping though, because I love double topping. :-) My husband and I absolutely loved it and I will definitely make this again."
"2","5","Using melted butter in the topping produced the best results I have ever experienced, and I've tried at least 10 different crumbles. Fabulous recipe."
"2","5","No other way to describe it but DELICIOUS! I used only 3/4 cup of white sugar and omitted the water and used 1/4 apple juice with a generous teaspoon of vanilla. I will definitely make this again very soon."
"2","5","This was a great basic recipe that everyone liked a lot. No changes. Vanilla ice cream complemented our crisp."
"2","5","Awesome recipe!!! I doubled the topping part and only did 1/4 cup of water and this was PERFECT!!!!"
"2","5","I made this for a few hard working sailors at the end of their work day. I made extra so that they could each take home leftovers if they so desired. Within 10 minutes the entire pan was empty and I was begged to make more that evening from my fiance, and even more for the sailors the next day! This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted!"
"2","5","This was so easy and so good. I used golden delicious apples that were going soft on me. I was worried that they would be too soft and too sweet but they were fantastic. I only used a 1/2 cup of brown (not white) sugar in the apples and 1/2 cup of apple cider instead of water. I added 2 T. of lemon juice and 2T. of vanilla. I could have used more liquid. I guess it depends on how juicy your apples are. I didn't melt the butter, just softened it and added it to the other ingredients in a bag and kneaded them together. There was plenty of crumble, although I only had enough apples to cover the 9' x 11'. I served this with ice cream and caramel sauce because that is how we serve apple pie around here. Everyone ate it up."
"2","4","Thanks, Diane, for a delicious apple crisp! I did end up having to increase the butter when I spread the crumbly topping over the apples. Without the extra butter, it would have been too dry. Otherwise, it was very good. I cut the recipe down for just my husband and myself. My husband was very disappointed when he realized I had eaten the leftovers the next day. I guess I'd better make more the next time so we can both have seconds!"
"2","5","Excellent. Didn't need to change anything."
"2","5","I made this just as stated, only I did not measure the cinamon. I thought this turned out WONDERFUL. It was not runny at all like others said. Next time, and there WILL BE a next time... I will change only that I will peel the apples as I didnt this time, and I will too double the topping recipe, and place some under and on top. The crunch was my favorite part, I may just make THAT next time!"
"2","5","cut water in half"
"2","5","So good. I made it this afternoon and there is only half the pan left. I can't stop eating it."
"2","5","I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and it is the very best. Why everyone changes recipes and then reviews them I just don't know... There's no need for any changes, the recipe is perfect the way it is!"
"2","5","My whole family loved this recipe. I substituted wheat germ for flour and 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce for butter. I cut the sugar to 3/4c brown and 3/4c white. Even more delicious with the healthy substitutions."
"2","5","This is so good, I made a few minor changes but this is a great recipe overall! I used very tart apples and I still only used about 1/3 cup sugar to mix in with the apples, I think a full cup would be too sweet. The crisp topping was awesome! I also baked this recipe in my crockpot on low for about 4 hours! It was enjoyed by everyone at the cookout that I brought it to!"
"2","5","Wow! This apple crisp was so yummy. The only change I made was only adding 1/2 cup of water, instead of 1 cup. My family enjoyed it alot and I will be making this again."
"2","4","Next time I make this I will add more butter to the crust - it was very loose and sandy like when it came out of the oven."
"2","5","This is a great recipe for apple crisp if you like the oatmeal type topping - the easiest and best I've found."
"2","4","I have made this numerous times but not exactly following the recipe. I like to cut the topping in 1/2 and put it over a can of cherry pie filling or apple pie filling in a 8x8 or 9x9 pan. Make sure you break up the topping or you get hard chunks. This is a great topping but I never had the patience to make the filling from scratch."
"2","4","Great recipe........... Upon reading others reviews I tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and added a tsp. of ground nutmeg, then layered the apples in he bottom of the baking dish. I halved the amount of granny smith apples and substituted the remaining apples for rhubarb. I used a little bit more brown sugar than the recipe called for as the rhubarb was not sweetened. 45 minutes was the perfect baking time."
"2","5","My son requested apple crisp for dessert on Easter so I tried this recipe. I wasn't sure about adding the water since none of my other crisp recipes called for it. I did add only 1/4 cup. It didn't need it at all. It came out a little watery but I just drained it off after baking. Very delicious. I thought the topping was the perfect amount but my husband liked it so much he thought it could use more. I will make this again."
"2","5","we all loved this in my house!"
"2","5","This was DELICIOUS. I will definitely make it again. I used granny smith - the tartness worked well in the recipe. The changes i will make the next time - double the topping, reduce the sugar that goes on the apple, cook for 35 minutes rather than 45. Personally I like big pieces of apples than thin slices. Another modification i will make is cut the water in half as others have suggested."
"2","4","This was my first attempt at making apple crisp. I bought 7 granny smith apples, which I thought would be enough but it only ended up being 8.5 cups. I used 1/4 cup of water and doubled the topping as others suggested (and then didn't quite use all of it because I had fewer apples). I also added too much cinnamon by mistake. Even after all of this it turned out great! The apples were the perfect texture--not too soft, not too hard. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was a real hit at the party I brought it to. Yum!"
"2","5","I served this on Thanksgiving. I put the warm apple crisp in margarita glasses and topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. It was amazing!! Definately a keeper!"
"2","5","This is a great recipe. I omitted the water and instead I let the apples sit in the sugar mixture (with a drop of lemon) for about 15 minutes before adding the topping. I halved the sugar and added pecans to the topping. Also, I brushed melted butter over the top after it was almost finished to crisp even more. I will definitely make this again!"
"2","5","This is great! It really is the best, and easiest apple crisp ever.The topping really does stay crunchy, it's good hot, or cold! MMMMMMM"
"2","5","I made this a few weeks ago and just realized I forgot to review it. We thought this was fantastic! The flavor was wonderful! Thanks for the recommendation suemck (a Quality Cook!) I did add some chopped pecans to the topping . Yummy so good I can't wait to make it again! Thanks!"
"2","4","I thought this recipe called for way too much sugar. I will stick to my old Apple Crisp recipe, it's much better"
"2","5","I bought too many apples, but I'm glad I did. The first batch I made smelled sooooo good when I set it on the stovetop to cool I couldn't resist and ate a piece....Made up the rest (1/2 recipe) and am not going to share! This was WONDERFUL! Don't need to tweak a thing it was just great!"
"2","5","I've made this dish serveral times. It always turns out properly and people just scarf it down. I usually double the topping ingredients because they are my favorite part of the crisp. Highly recommend."
"2","4","Very tasty. I think better as it sits a little. Make sure to PEEL and slice the apples very thin. I used an apple corer and slicer and cut those slices in half, but they were still not thin enough. About 1/8 inch would be good. Also, I would recommend adding a tsp or two of pure vanilla extract to the water for a little more flavor. I made a half recipe, but still used the full amt of topping, and it was slightly too much, but better too much than not enough. Also, I used 1/8 cup of water, but I think 1/4 would have been better, as it was a little dry for our tastes. Probably had dry Granny Smith apples though."
"2","4","This was really good! I halved the recipe but kept the topping the same...glad I did! Used Harrelson apples and threw in a small handful of cinnamon chips before the topping went on and it made a delicious dessert. Thanks much!"
"2","5","This is so good I have made it about 10 times just this fall and it is always delicious. Thanks for sharing"
"2","5","VERY TASTY! but make sure you peel the apples as well as slicing them. It did not cross my mind until it was done and it looked liked sauteed green pepper crisp. It really did not change the flavor, just the eye appeal. Also after slicing i put lemon juice on the apples so they wouldn't turn. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly (just cut as many apples as needed to fill the dish) and it was wonderful and really easy!"
"2","5","I FORGOT TO ADD IN MY LAST REVIEW THAT INSTEAD OF POURING THE MIXTURE OF SUGAR, CINNAMON, AND FLOUR ON TOP OF THE APPLES IN THE DISH, TO TOSS THE APPLES IN THE MIXTURE IN A BOWL, THEN PUT IN DISH AND PUT TOPPING ON."
"2","5","Very Good. Thanks for the recipe. I substituted 1/2 Cup of Splenda and used only 1/2 Cup of Sugar. I also used Splenda Brown Sugar. It came out great and no one even noticed that it was lower in calorie."
"2","5","This recipe was perfect! The compliments didn't stop all evening. Besides peeling and slicing all the apples, it was a snap to make as well. Thank you, this is going to be THE recipe for me :-)"
"2","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe I've made. The topping tastes like oatmeal cookies. I didn't have quick-cooking oats, so I used old-fashioned oats and it still turned out great. The only problem I had was that the apples were too mushy; I won't bake it as long next time."
"2","5","VERY good apple crisp recipe! Couldn't get any simpler or taste any better!"
"2","5","Wonderful apple crisp. I did use a few of the other reviewer's tips. I reduced the water by half, doubled the topping, and added pecans to the topping. It was wonderful. I could not get enough!"
"2","5","Completely amazing! This will be the only apple crisp recipe I will use from now on. Doesn't need any changes."
"2","5","I made this for a group of women and everyone of them asked for the recipe. I doubled the apples and it was perfect. I also didn't add the water and it was perfect. I doubled the crust recipe but didn't use it all. I also added 1 T. cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon juice to the sugar mix and apples. I will definately make this one again!"
"2","5","Everyone loved this! We served it warm with a scoop of cinnamon ice-cream (we had blue bunny brand) on top!"
"2","5","Very easy, but so good! My family always asks me to make it."
"2","5","This was excellent. Brought it to work & everyone enjoyed it. Had to send the recipe to a few people."
"2","5","This crips smells like heaven! Tastes super yummy with vanilla ice cream. I also doubled the crisp part, but didn't quite use it all. Came out perfectly delicious. I used mostly granny smith apples and added a couple of honeycrisp apples for their flavor. I'll be making this again."
"2","4","Turned out a little too moist. Maybe I did something wrong but the flavour was very nice. With a large scoop of vanilla icecream melting on top everyone gobbled it up. I'll try the recipe again."
"2","5","I just pulled this crisp out of the oven and held my breath because Woops! I forgot to add the water! It looked pretty juicy so I scooped some onto a dish, added vanilla ice cream and it is just heavenly! The crunchy topping is the best part of it (which honestly I was picking at before I added it to the apples, which may be the reason I forgot the water). I will make this again and again - but I think next time I may add just a bit more cinnamon. A perfect dessert for a cool autumn day. Thank you Diane!"
"2","5","Followed the advice of other reviews and did not add the water. I double the topping because I love the crunch. Best apple crisp I ever made!!"
"2","4","I had read the reviews and had doubled the amount of the crumbled mixture.Unfortunately it did not work right for me,so next time I will make according to the recipe and review it then!"
"2","5","This was a very good recipe. I cut the water to 1/4cup and doubled the topping, like others had mentioned. Cutting the water worked fine, the apples were perfectly crisp and the gooey insides were just right. There was definitely lots of topping. I used Honeycrisp apples and they were fabulous. Everyone liked it. Will do this one again."
"2","5","simply the best apple crips i have tried. I have been using this recipie for about three years now and every christmas and thanksgiving the whole family wants to know 'your making apple crisp right?' I like to double the crisp part but thats just personal taste. Everyone should try this recipie."
"2","5","This was one oooey gooey treat. After one serving i had a tummy ache. It was definately one of the better crisps i have ever had. I was about 1 1/2 cups shy of the necessary apples and i only aded 1/4 cup water. It was a bit on the dry side but i think that extra cup of apples would have fixed that. I wish the toping was bit crunchier but it was still good. Will definatly make again"
"2","5","OUTSTANDING. Thanks for this very easy and very delicious recipe. I used half white sugar and half Splenda. I added 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla. I did add the water and it was perfect; not at all thin as other reviewers mentioned. I used Granny Smith, Fuji and Rome apples. Great both warm or cold. This is a keeper!"
"2","4","A fabulous tasting recipe! But 'please' dont add the water! Mine was thin and I didnt even add water based on the most helpful reviews. I made this for a potluck last night and I'm going to try and make this again for a Send-Off party tonight."
"2","5","OH MY..This is so good and so easy. I don't know why I expected it to be hard..but this was an easy recipe. I used McIntosh and used my mandoline for quick slicing. I doubled the topping and left the white sugar and water as stated..it wasn't too sweet..It was awesome! Thank you."
"2","5","This was a perfect apple crisp recipe and really easy too! I used 5 granny smith apples and put them into a pie dish and didn't double the topping recipe and it came out with just the right amount of crisp to apple. I also reduced the amount of water and it didn't come out soupy. Thanks for a great, easy and quick dessert!"
"2","2","I found it strange to be adding water and sure enough it came out like soup. It was better the next day after being in the fridge but still runny... and a little too sweet (using golden delicious apples). Next time I would leave out most of the water and lighten up on the sugar."
"2","5","I have made this for many occasions! Loved by all! Its my go - to recipe when I need a quick dessert!"
"2","5","I was looking for a way to use the yummiest peaches that I bought from Costco. I used them instead of apples in this recipe. Keep the sugar the same, no cutting back like on the apple version. I did cut back on the cinnamon. I also did 1 1/2 on the topping as suggested. Glad I did, could have even possibly doubled it. Turned out great out, will make again."
"2","5","It was delicious,my husband said it was the best he ever tasted. It was gone within 2 days. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!"
"2","5","First of all I have to say there are no words to describe this VERY delicious recipe. It's the best Apple Crisp I've ever had. I am known for altering all of my recipes to make them lower in fat, calories, etc. so I used 3/4 C Splenda and 1/4 C Sugar for the sugar, I used light margarine instead of regular butter whole wheat flour for half of the flour amount. It turned out terrific, we can't get enough of it at our house. And warmed with vanilla frozen yogurt on top- you've gone to heaven. Thank you Diane!!"
"2","5","This was a great recipe. My family and I fully enjoyed eating this Apple Crisp, the only thing I would change is the amount of sugar. I think a little less white sugar would be better, but thats just for my personal taste. Otherwise this is a winner!"
"2","5","awesome, made this for a memorial day picnic and got so many compliments! I doubled the topping as others had suggested."
"2","5","Fabulous! Took this to a pot luck and everyone loved it. People went for the chocolate cake first, but when they tasted this apple crisp it disappeared! I did make 1 1/2 batch of the topping, as suggested by many others."
"2","5","Absolutely perfect! I used six medium sized Granny Smith apples with the full amount of sugar. I omitted the water, added dashes of nutmeg to both the apples and topping, and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp for the apples (also adding a couple of dashes to the topping). It was OUTSTANDING! The apples were tart but sweet and was perfect with a scoop of ice cream! Thank you so much!"
"2","5","This is wonderful. I have always made it using the water, and it has never turned out runny for me. I add some vanilla to the water, and a little cinnamon in the topping."
"2","5","This apple crisp is WONDERFUL! The recipe makes a lot, and since I was making it for my family of four, we had several leftovers servings. We found that even when reheating it in the microwave, the topping remained crispy. Great with vanilla ice cream. My husband and kids were in heaven with every bite!"
"2","5","I made this apple crisp for an out of town family gathering. I had to prepare it two days in advance and it still tasted great when I served it. My family raved and it was a breeze to make."
"2","2","I changed the recipe according to other reviewers' suggestions. I tried it because of the rave reviews. I'm going to have to go against the majority...I've made better apple crisps than this. The topping is not very crispy...it's more of a crumb cake topping. I also like the crisp part to be on the top and bottom as opposed to one layer just sitting on the top. I won't be making this again."
"2","5","This turned out yummy! I used 1/4 cup water and 1 1/2 times the topping mixture.  I brought it to a potluck and it was the 1st dessert to go out of many."
"2","5","Sweet - but soooo gooooood!!!"
"2","4","Well this was good but really sweet! Could be the apples I had! I know they can make a huge difference. I think if I made this again I would go for a more tart apple like the granny smith. I even cut the white sugar back to 1/4 of a cup like others suggested. I also used half the water. Good suggestion! Thank you! The topping was really good. I doubled it. I think next time I would only make one a half times topping. Double was a bit much. I do suggest you give it a try! The Vanilla Ice Cream is a perfect match for this one."
"2","5","What a wonderful fall recipe! My husband is an apple crisp devotee and rushed home from work for more desert!!! This recipe will last for a couple of days as long as I hide it from him. teeheehee. I did as many others suggested - omitted the water and doubled the topping. Yum. This is a really crisp crisp! Enjoy!"
"2","5","I printed this recipe back in November of 2002 to prepare for Thanksgiving that year. It has been a staple in our house ever since. I make it every year for my husband's birthday 'cake' and it beats every apple pie and crisp recipe hands down! I always omit the water and double the topping (advice I read in reviews back in '02). If you're an apple crisp fan, don't miss this recipe!!"
"2","5","This was very easy to make and just as delicious. My husband said that it reminded him of the apple crisp his mom used to make when he was a youngster. I made this for a party and had to make several copies for friends and family!!"
"2","5","So delicious! Even my 6 year-old (who won't eat apple pie!) loved this. I prefer a more tart and not-saucy apple filling, so I used a combination of firm Macintosh (flavor) and Smokehouse (juicy), and added only a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice with the flour and cinnamon -- no water, and only about 1/8 cup of sugar. I doubled the topping but it was too much - 1 1/2 times would be perfect. Dreamy Fall treat!"
"2","5","Perfect recipe and filled the 9x13' pan well. The topping was crumbly and sweet and it was ready after 45 minutes of baking. Making the apple crisp is a good task to share with your child. One can peel while another slices the apples. One variation I used was straining the juice of one lemon onto the apples in the baking pan. Stirring the apples into the lemon juice kept the apples looking fresh and added a nice flavor. Invite your parents or neighbors over and enjoy the apple crisp on vanilla ice-cream!"
"2","5","This is so delectable! I took the advice of others to make more of the topping because it is so good. I reduced the sugar slightly and it was great!"
"2","5","I also reduced the amount of white sugar and water added. One tip- if you like a butter-rich topping, don't overmix the crumble topping after adding butter. The clumps taste rich and yummy!"
"2","4","This is pretty much a standard apple crisp. Definately use granny smith apples. I used about 6 apples, 1/2 the white sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of the water. Also added some nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. Tasty and easy."
"2","5","This recipe is so easy and it was the best apple crisp I have ever had. I was skeptical about the water addition but it proved beneficial for a nice sauce throughout the apples."
"2","4","This Apple Crisp was great but I did not like how much water was added. The water made the apples verry soggy and not crispy. I am going to try and add half the water because I like my apples crispy. The topping was amazing and I can't wait to take it to a friends house to have them try it:-)"
"2","4","The apple and the crisp blend nicely. I found that the taste was a little bland... next time I will use more cinnamon and put it on the underside of the apples as well. The oats add a great crunch."
"2","5","This is a great recipe. It's just like the one my Mom used to make for our family years ago. The only changes I make were I used 1/2 Apple Juice and 1/2 water,to give more flavor. I added 2T nutmeg and I also doubled the topping. Also, it takes about 1 1/2 hours to bake. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","4","I made it yesterday and it's great! I doubled the crisp, added sliced almonds on top and sprinkled with a mix of sugar and cinnamon. My husband took the rest to work and his co-workers loved it. Best served warm."
"2","5","This is the most amazing Apple Crisp ever! The recipe is extremely easy to follow and it only takes about 10 minutes to prepare it. Thanks a lot for this recipe."
"2","3","I took the advice of others, cut out the water in the apples and doubled the crust. Thank goodness I did, but the recipe still needs some work if I use it again.  1) I would use 1/4 flour in the apples, two Tbls of cinnamon, no water, and a dash of nutmeg. Underneath the topping in my crisp there were apples floating in LOTS of liquid.  2) Continue to double the topping, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of salt--mine tasted a little bland and I realized that could have been fixed easily with some salt to perk up the flavors.   This recipe has potential, but I'm a little disappointed I used up a bunch of freshly-picked apples on a mediocre recipe. I'm from Ohio--we know apples. I should have followed my instinct."
"2","5","This recipe was awesome! I also doubled the crisp part as was recommended, and it was delicious!"
"2","4","Good recipie, but a bit too much sugar for me. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup."
"2","5","yum. so good. hubby even asked me to make this again for a group of his co-workers. i halved the recipe, and it came out great."
"2","5","Yummy! I used less white sugar, only about tablespoon water, tablespoon lemon juice, 5 large granny smith apples, dash nutmeg in with cinnamon, and I didn't melt the butter...I just cut it in mixture until crumbly. A big hit here. Thanks for posting. made it last night, making it again for tonight. Husband loved it, so did I."
"2","5","This is the best apple crisp ever!!! Served warm with vanilla icecream, it is the most comforting dessert. My children loved it. I took some to work and my co-worker almost flipped out over how delicious it was. She immediately copied the recipe and made it that weekend. The only thing i did differently was omit the water. This did the trick for my family."
"2","5","THE BEST!!! I only used 1/4 cup of water. If you end up with too much towards end of baking, just scoop out and finish cooking."
"2","4","this recipe was quick and easy and my family loved it!"
"2","5","This was delicious! I used a mixture of apples: machintosh, granny smith and braburn. I always love to mix up my apples in pies or crisps to give different textures. I'm sure I used more cinnamon thank what the recipe called for since my husband loves cinnamon and I also added about 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp allspice to the appple mixture. It turned out so good and I was very pleased that everyone loved it. I have a small dish left in the refridgerator waiting for a midnight snack attack to hit me :) Thanks Diane!"
"2","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever made! Everyone loves it, including my very picky husband.:) I have made this three times now, using 10 granny smith apples and I omitted the water each time. Thanks for a great recipe Diane!"
"2","4","I made this with 2 16oz bags of frozen blueberries instead of apples and it came out great. I only added 1/8 cup of water to the berries, 4 Tbl of suger, and instead of cinnamon I used apple pie spice. Great dessert will make again on Thanksgiving!"
"2","5","Wow, rave reviews. Served this at Halloween party, gave out the recipe to many. Omitted the water. I used 3 kinds of apples as that is what I had on hand. I doubled the topping & added pecans to it, but did NOT double brown sugar--used about 1&1/4 cup. Also added a dash of lemon juice to apples, I poured cinnamon-nutmeg sugar over sliced apples while in a bowl to coat them thoroughly & than put into pan. Once apples were in pan I tossed some Craisins on top than sprinkled on the oatmeal mixture. Yummy! Will make again and again."
"2","5","My family really enjoyed this apple crisp. I have searched for an apple crisp recipe. This is delicious. I left out the water like others recommended and added less sugar. I decided to half the recipe and this was a huge mistake. We finished the apple crisp within a day! I need to make it again soon!"
"2","4","I messed up the topping (I know, real hard!), but even so it was delicious. I can see how much better it would even taste made properly!!! I usually make my crumb topping with solid butter, but using melted made it easier (no need to have room-temp butter hanging around). I did not add the flour or sugar to the apples just a tsp. of cinnamon -- we like the apple part slightly tart. I will definitely make this again (the right way!!)."
"2","5","This is the best and easiest apple crisp recipe that I have ever tried! Everyone just loved it. Definitely will make it again."
"2","5","This is the best recipe for apple crisp!!! I made it for a family gathering and everyone said it was FABULOUS! A wonderful dessert for a cold fall/winter evening! It was a bit sweet for me so next time I will reduce the amount of sugar. Scrumptious!"
"2","5","Loved this apple crisp recipe. I mix the apples and spices in a bowl first, so they get evenly coated. I skip the water, and it turns out great every time. I also like to add cinnamon to the topping. I recently made this with fresh peaches.Mmm. Thanks for the great recipe."
"2","5","Kicks butt, plain and simple!"
"2","4","This recipe is very, very good! I didn't give it 5 stars because of the water. Against the advise of my fellow reviewers, I added the water and ended up w/watery crisp. I loved the flavor so much i decided to try it again, this time minus the water and it was GREAT! The second time around, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the full cup of white sugar with the apples and it was not too sweet, not too tart - perfect for my taste! The apples that you use are the vital ingredient in this and any other apple recipe so make sure u use BAKING apples. if you are wondering which apples are baking apples, ask the produce staff at your supermarket or your fellow shoppers, it really makes a HUGE difference."
"2","5","Yummy! I had just two apples to use up so I scaled the recipe way down (which is plenty for my beau and I). The only thing I did different was to use lemon juice in place of the water which satisfies my desire to have the apple filling a little on the tangy side. We ate this with vanilla icecream. I would make this again."
"2","5","This recipe was awesome. I halfed the apples for an 8x8 pan and left the dough/crisp portion as is. I also deleted the water. The recipe came out perfect. i will definitely be making this recipe again."
"2","5","I made this last night for my husband and sons and it went over extremely well. I followed some prior advice and used 5 granny smith apples and I cut out the 1/2 cup water and replaced it with 1/4 cup apple juice. We ate it warm with whipped cream... DELICIOUS!"
"2","5","This recipe was excellent! It was a huge hit and my husband who isn't a big dessert person had three helpings of this! I did change a couple things. I added extra cinnamon to the topping and added cinnamon and allspice to the apples. Also, I one and a halfed the topping as I love extra topping. But without any of these changes it still would have been great! This is absolutely a keeper!"
"2","5","It's my first try at Apple Crisp & it was a success. But a little too sweet.. will try it again with less sugar. thx."
"2","5","This was perfect! I used two pounds of frozen peaches, left out the water and added nutmeg!"
"2","4","I thought this recipe was pretty good although several people commented that there was 'too much cinnamon' in the apple mixture. Serving it with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping helped cut the cloying taste of the cinnamon. I also added more oatmeal than listed because the topping seemed really cake-like."
"2","5","This recipe is the best I've ever tried. My whole family loved it especially my mother-in-law who also makes an excellent apple crisp. Thank you so much!!!!"
"2","5","WOW! This recipe created the most delicious dessert I've ever made. It was a hit with my wife (suprise) and my friends at a recent holiday party. Will definately make again and again."
"2","5","This was very good, especially the topping. I used Splenda & a brown sugar substitute so my diabetic dad could eat it too. I served it hot out of the oven &, for the rest of my guests, I had vanilla ice cream to put on top. I'd used granny smith apples, & one guest said it was good as it was both sweet & tart. My husband thought it was too sweet so I'll try 1/2 a cup of the white sugar/Splenda & maybe 3/4 cup of the brown sugar/sugarfree substitute next time. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to peel the apples or not but I peeled them. I'd say the size of your baking pan should depend on how thick you'd like the apple part to be. I used 10 apples &, even though my guests enjoyed it, I think the 9 X 13 pan was too big."
"2","5","I made this for a Christmas brunch last week and got rave reviews. I used orange juice instead of water and cooked it the day before. The next day I reheated it, and it was not mushy at all."
"2","5","Very easy to make, very tasty. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg to the apple mix, along with an extra few pats of butter on top of the oat topping. I've also thrown in some golden raisins, maybe next time I'll toss in some chopped pecans into the topping...lots of room here for variation. I've even modified the recipe to use it with other fruits, like canned pears (or fresh when available), or canned peaches. Yum!"
"2","5","Great recipe, Diane!!  I was a bit skeptical because I have tried so many other recipes and the taste was just not what I was hoping it to be. I made it for a pre-Thanksgiving pot luck. It was gone in no time.  I added a bit of allspice to the crumb mixture and used Cortland apples.  Thanks so much for sharing! Sharon"
"2","5","Just made this on the weekend - disappeared within minutes. I love how incredibly easy but tasty this receipe is."
"2","5","Made this for a Church Supper and doubled it and it was a hit. thanks"
"2","5","Delicious!!! Wouldn't change a thing!"
"2","5","Great recipe... since I like cinnamon a lot, I added more to the apples, and included some in the crisp topping - excellent!"
"2","4","Soaked water with cinnamon sugar mix the night before! :) Great the next day! My boyfriend loved it - but it seemed to be kind of watery when it's first baked - surprisingly after a day in the fridge the water evaporates and the apple mixture is thicker. Next time I'd try adding less water! :) Also added some walnuts :)"
"2","5","Excellent. My husband and kids loved it. This is the only apple crisp recipe I'll be keeping from now on."
"2","5","Absolutely fabulous! Will half or omit the water next time."
"2","5","This was great! We had people over for the World Series Angel game (Yeah Angels!) last night and it was as big a hit as the game! We forgot the water but it was great anyway."
"2","3","Really to sweet for my family. You really could cut way down on the sugars in this, other than that the taste was great!!!"
"2","5","great way to use up those autumn apple picking apples. very easy and very, very tasty!!! thanks!"
"2","5","This recipe is AWESOME!! I made it just as instructed - water and all and it came out perfect. My family raved and it was so easy I felt guilty. I used a mixture of Mutsu, Gala, Macoun & Courtland, and the flavor was fantastic."
"2","5","Terrific! I also made it with less sugar, more oats and added some nuts. It was great for a warm breakfast treat. Delicious and easy!"
"2","5","Made this and it was a hit! I didn't change anything. I used Granny Smith apples (6 of them). I will definitely make this again!"
"2","5","This was very easy to make and absolutely delicious.... better than any apple pie I have ever had. I served it at a fall brunch and it was a huge hit! I will definetly make this again"
"2","5","Great recipe. I added 1 cup of chopped pecans. Delicious."
"2","5","This was a very good recipe! I followed the majority of the previous suggestions and cut the amount of white sugar in 1/2 and it was just right. Also, since my husband and I like a lot more of the crisp than the apples, I reduced the amount of the apples by about 2 cups so it was perfect for us. I will definately be making this again. I'm only wondering if it will work just as well for peaches as it did for apples?"
"2","5","This was wonderful! I used 1/4 cup of water, 8 cups of apples. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Will be making again and again. Thanks!!"
"2","4","I only used 1/2C of sugar with the apples and it was still too sweet for our liking...... perhaps next time I'll add a few drops of lemon juice to cut the sweetness. But overall I think it is a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again. It is especially good served warm with a scoop of ice cream. The topping is fabulous... I added sliced almonds and it was d'lish! Thanks for posting the recipe!"
"2","5","My husband and son really liked this recipe. It was easy and tasted great! One thing that really made a difference was using Pampered Chef's Peeler/Corer/Slicer, it does all the work with the apples and slices them to 1/8' thick. I don't like the big wedges of apples that never seem to get done, this was juicy and the apples were very tender. I also cut back just a bit on the sugar based on some of the other reviews. SUPERB!"
"2","5","The BEST apple crisp recipe ever. This is so easy and SOOO good. I made it for a dinner party and it was devoured in minutes. It is wonderful with ice cream. If you slice the apples thin enough, the cooking time is perfect. We will definitely keep this recipe in our dessert file!"
"2","5","My mother and I have been looking for an apple crisp recipe that could rival the apple crisp served during intermission at the Shakespeare Tavern in Atlanta--we look forward to this treat at every show. Well, this is the recipe! We made this last week, and are already wondering when we can make it again! One note--the apples we used were very juicy, so 1/2 cup of water seemed to be just a little too much. Also, we added chopped pecans to the topping--wonderful! *Added note--I've now made this recipe many times. Have discovered that good apples make good apple crisp. Always use very crisp, flavorful apples, or you will be very disappointed."
"2","5","Have made this twice already. The family loves it and it doesn't last long! I make many pies for Thanksgiving, but this has been requested this year. I had lost my original apple crisp I used when moving, and have been trying many different ones since. But I have to say, I am glad I found this one because it's better than the original one I had!!"
"2","5","Apple Crisp is one my very favorite desserts and this recipe is wonderful! My whole family enjoyed it and it was very easy to make. Thanks!!"
"2","5","I have made this recipe several times. Its easy and incredibley delicious. Thankyou for a fantastic recipe!!! Laura"
"1","5","This apple crisp is to die for! I made for my coworkers twice and they always ask me to make it when we have a pot luck, it's gone instantly!"
"1","5","This is delicious!!! I can't tell you how many times I've made this! My parents really enjoy it too! I have added fresh local maple syrup to it as well (just drizzle it on top after you take out of the oven) It also smells wonderful while baking!"
"1","5","Awesome! As other reviewers recommended, I doubled the topping and used 6 granny smith apples that I mixed with 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Use 1/4 cup of water or none."
"1","4","I think you need to add more apples to the recipe. Also I think it would be better if the sugar mix was stirred into the apples before putting them In the baking pan."
"1","4","Very very good. I just added a little lemon zest. Next time I will try it with just a bit less sugar."
"1","5","I've made this recipe three times and was absolutely delicious every time........now the good news......it is just as good SUGAR FREE!!!! I followed the directions exactly, only substituted the sugar and brown sugar for Splenda granulated and Splenda brown sugar. You couldn't tell the difference!!"
"1","5","This is yummy!!! I followed the recipe but I did not have baking powder. I don't miss it. It is delicious!!"
"1","5","Made this crisp for a local pool league award ceremony, there were roughly 80 to 100 people there. Quadrupled the recipe and made it in 2 big hotel pans. Both pans were DEMOLISHED. Literally. I cannot tell you how many compliments I received! I've already been asked to make it again at next years' ceremony. Hubby is already asking for it to be made again so he can have one to himself. Followed the recipe as is, no changes at all and it was perfect. And so simple to make too! Will definitely be making more of these in the future. Thank you for this awesome recipe!"
"1","4","I made this the other day with some variations suggested by reviewers such as less sugar, less butter, less water, more crust, and use an 8x8 pan. The taste was good but next time I will put half the crust mixture on the bottom because I kept having to increase the baking time when the crust still looked raw after 45 minutes. When I make it again, I will try different apples, decrease the sugar even more, keep the amount of butter the same as in the recipe, and add apple juice or apple cider instead of water. I think the liquid is important for steam-cooking the crust."
"1","3","I would cut the brown sugar in the crumble topping considerably...much too sweet for my taste. The apples can withstand less sugar as well. Also, I would change flour to cornstarch since it does a better job thickening liquid so it isn't runny. My mom also used to squeeze a bit of lemon juice onto her sliced apples used in pies/etc. to brighten the flavor a bit. If you slice apples thinly, you shouldn't need the full 45 min to bake. Mine were about 1/2' thick and the baking time was perfect for the apples without making them mushy but it was a bit too long for the crumble topping and dried it out. Since the flour didn't thicken the 1/4c water (I halved what recipe required based on reviews), I ended up stirring the entire end product into itself so the dried-out/overbaked topping could be alleviated with the excess liquid that accumulated at the bottom."
"1","5","My whole family LOVES this apple crisp recipe!!! I make the recipe as is, as far as ingredients go. When I am slicing up the apples I have the cinnamon, sugar and flour already in the bowl that I am putting the apples into. Helps them from turning brown on you!!! Thank you SO much for this awesome treat!"
"1","5","Loved this dessert it was easy to make, I added pears as well as apples (not enough apples) and it turned out great! We will absolutely remake this recipe."
"1","5","This is very good. I changed a few things as I am gluten free. I changed the flour for all purpose gluten free flour n it was very good. I also added chopped pecans in the topping as they come out crunchy and roasted. I also doubled the topping as we like lots. Very good flaver. I added some nutmeg like a few others in the apples and a little pinch of ground cloves. Used brown sugar but only half of what it called for. I cut just a little of the water. I also added raisins in the apples as we like that. Raisins make it sweeter so another reason to cut back on the sugar. The flour in the apples I also used all purpose gluten free four.  This crisp is very good buy itself or top with vanilla ice cream or cool whip while warm n it melts on top. Yummy."
"1","5","A great dessert to have especially with a scope of ice cream which makes it both marm and cold at the perfect temperature"
"1","5","This was really great! Made it for Sunday lunch dessert and everyone cleaned their plates. Made a few changes, added some orange zest to the apples, and used half a cup of white sugar in the crumble since I didn't have brown."
"1","5","I have to say this recipe is spot on IF you use 10 cups of apples. I use spartan apples for apple crisp every time. My husband is an apple dessert anything. I did add 1/4 cup caramel sauce and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. The key to a crunchy topping is to cut the butter in the dry ingredients AND just before you put it on top of the apples, drop 1/2 teaspoon of butter onto the apples, about 6 dopples. To keep the apples creamy, don't put a bottom layer of crumble in the pan. It tastes wonderful with a creamy apple, buttery with cinnamon bite!"
"1","4","The flavor is awesome!!! I would take other recommendations and double the toppings and ether make the choice to cut out the water or add more flour."
"1","5","Delicious. Made this for holidays and was enjoyed by everyone. I threw in some raisins and crushed walnuts which gave it some extra flavor"
"1","5","One of the things I love about this site is the suggestions by the reviewers. Due to the suggestions, I made this recipe with half the apple part with no water. I did put in 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice before tossing the flour and sugar with my Granny Smith apples. I made the full amount of topping. The whole thing fits in a 7 1/2' souffle pan or an 8'x8' pan. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it was absolutely outstanding."
"1","5","So wonderful. I added rosemary to give it a bit more flavour and lessened the sugar and it was like eating apples and caramel. So delicious with a scoop of plain vanilla ice cream.I love how the oats gives it that depth rather than just flour , sugar and butter. Also, adding bran to the top mixture was so yummy.Will make this again."
"1","4","I made this recipe today with a few modifications. It turned out excellent but I think it would have been too sweet had I added the sugar to the apples so I gave it a 4/5 stars. I used whole wheat flour, added 1 cup of pecans chopped and left out the white sugar. It turned out wonderful and I would make it again the exact same way. My daughter asked for seconds!"
"1","5","this recipe is the bomb this is the first apple crisp I made and I'm glad I chose to make this one it's delicious my hubby like it very much. I followed some reviewers comment cut the water in half and double the crumble and it was perfect I used granny smith apples. this recipe definitely for keeps. thank you"
"1","5","Basic and yummy!"
"1","5","At first bite the topping tastes like a delicious oatmeal cookie! This is a keeper :-)"
"1","5","Loved it!!! Did it in a 8x8 instead but didn't change a thing ! The best apple crisp ever!!!"
"1","5","I love it!!! It was delicious and I definitely doing it again."
"1","5","This was excellent! Definite keeper! I will cut back on the suger next time, but only due to personal preference."
"1","4","delicious"
"1","5","Perfect! I made a half batch as I only had 4 medium apples on hand. I made it in a 9x9 square cake pan. Next time the only changes I'll make is make in a slightly smaller dish (if making another half batch) and reduce the water just a touch."
"1","5","Yes I love it"
"1","3","I made this but I used Washington State apples and added the water. Was not impressed. Totally my fault. I did not. Read the comments before I bought the apples. Next time I will make sure it's Granny Smith and not to add the water. For too much liquid at the bottom of the pan."
"1","5","This is perfect and never lasts very long!"
"1","5","Simple and yummy! I made this with red delicious apples I had on hand that were a little on the tart side. I cut back on the sugar, added a little (1/4 tsp) nutmeg and didn't add any water. Turned out great! I can't wait to try it with Granny Smith apples."
"1","5","Mix the sugar mixture with the apples (and do not just sprinkle on top). Leave out the water. Double the topping. Half on the bottom and half on top. Add nutmeg."
"1","5","Best apple crisp I've ever had!  The only thing I added was half a tsp of vanilla to the brown sugar mixture.   To those who think the water is unnecessary. It's not, it really helps the cinnamon/sugar mixture stick to the apples. I coated the apples in the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the water by stirring them in the pan so it would be evenly applied. It turned out PERFECTLY. Will definitely be making this again.. and again... and again. :)"
"1","5","Delicious! Made this for AFC Playofff and there was not enough. I could have made two easily. Best Apple Crisp I've had, ever! I will increase the topping by 50% and cut back on the water by half next time though. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","4","I was honestly surprised how yummy this Apple crisp is! I was tempted to alter the recipe with less sugar but I'm glad that I didnt! Next time I'll double the topping although it was still good with one :)"
"1","3","Overall, very yummy and it the spot for my dessert craving, using a bunch of apples I needed to use. It was a little runny at the bottom. But it was simply made (with help from young children) and delicious."
"1","5","I have been making this for a few years now and the family loves it! The only change I make is the apples. We have a tree in the back yard and I use those, no idea how many apples, enough to fill my pan."
"1","5","AWESOME recipe. Like so many other reviewers, I didn't add water, used a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in with the cinnamon/sugar mix, and I doubled the topping mixture. I used Granny Smith apples, and they were very firm, so I ended up having to bake the dish for two hours. I kept it covered most of the time to not overcook the top, and it was so worth the wait. It may have been ready sooner, but the extra baking time brought out plenty of moisture in the apples, and it caramelized so nicely."
"1","5","I made it for the first time for New Year's Eve. I dressed it up a bit by altering the 1/2 cup water. I made it 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup Apple brandy. With a dash of clove to the cinnamon, it made a great adult taste for Apple crisp."
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for quite a while now this is by far the best one ever and I have tried others and nothing compares to this one"
"1","5","Delish!!!!!! Super easy!!"
"1","4","Very good the day I made it. Not so good on day two. It was soggy on day two."
"1","3","okay"
"1","5","I made it with half granny Smith, half Macs. I followed recipe and it is delicious."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. I also only did 1/4 cup water like a lot of the reviews recommended and it was the perfect amount. Pair this dessert with some vanilla ice cream and its perfection!"
"1","5","Delicious! I don't add the water but everything else I follow step by step!"
"1","5","This is so good. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","Amazing!!! So easy, yet so delicious! Followed recipe except used old fashioned (5 min) oats rather than quick oats, and added walnuts to the topping. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream about a month ago. Making again now for Christmas dessert. If you don't have an apple peeler and a thin slicer/corer (16 slice/apple), get them... so worth it and save so much time on recipes like this!"
"1","5","It was my first time making Apple Crisp and I decided to make it for Thanksgiving. It came out great!"
"1","3","The first time I made this I followed it exactly and it was so sickly sweet that I wouldn't even serve it to anyone! I made this again last night with some modifications and it turned out way better. Use the Granny Smith apples since they are more tart than other brands. Also, replace 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar with half portions only. Next time I make this I plan to reduce the sugar even further!"
"1","4","Loved this recipe. It was easy to make and turned out great. I will be making this again and again."
"1","5","Delicious and so much quicker and easier to make than apple pie. Plan on making this one again and again!"
"1","5","Amazing definitely my favorite apple crisp. The only thing I would suggest is adding a bit of cinnamon."
"1","3","Double the topping. Cut all sugar by 25%. Add 2 T lemon juice if apples are sweet. Cut water in half. Yummy"
"1","3","Hoping this turns out as I just realized it called for half a cup of water but no where in this instructions does it say what to add the water too. So that being said fifteen minutes into cooking I had to pour water into pan.....#fingers crossed."
"1","4","Very good apple crisp. Next time I will add less water....either that or more flour....was a bit watery. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added nutmeg because I love it."
"1","4","This came out amazing. My apples were so juicy I had a good amount of liquid on the bottom of the cooking dish. Not sure how to prevent this in the future. Amazing recipe!"
"1","5","Great recipe. I used green pippin apples. NO water. 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar cause ice cream sweetens it up. I used pumpkin pie spice which is ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon. 1.5x the topping for more crunch. Family loved it."
"1","5","wow!!! this recipe is not only easy, it is DELICIOUS!!!! I love this site as well! Family approves of this 1 BIG TIME"
"1","5","Great recipe-doubled the topping like other reviewers suggested.   Didn't have enough brown sugar for that so used white for half of the double topping and it still tasted great. I used Granny Smith apples."
"1","5","I followed this recipe as written except that I added a little nutmeg and didn't add the extra water and everyone loved it. Great and easy recipe. Thanks!"
"1","5","I haven't made apple anything for a while and wow this blew us out of the park. My husband couldn't shut up about how good it was and my dad finally admitted I was a good baker. Thank you for this recipe it was so great!"
"1","5","This recipe is perfect! I've made it many times and everyone loves it!"
"1","5","I make this recipe all the time to rave reviews. Always use green pippin apples."
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!! Double the topping for sure. Yum!"
"1","5","I used gal bag of fresh apples that had been frozen and thawed on the counter. They were pretty juicy and so didn't add the water. Will try thawing just over night on the counter,,maybe 6-7 hrs and if that is still too juicy will try in the frig over night. Seemed like it took a long time to thaw even on the counter. Anyway I might add another TB or 2 of flour to thicken it up. I also used a tad more cinnamon. This was really good and took it to a meeting and several wanted the recipe. I am making it for Thanksgiving with ice cream. Yummy."
"1","5","Love this! So easy! I always forget to add the water and it still comes out perfect! I took the advice of others, added nutmeg to my apples. I like to let my apples sit while I make the topping which I also double, and which is why I forget the water. But they make their own juice like that and it's awesome. Only thing I add...CARAMEL! Right on top the topping, make it right in! Top with ice cream, amazing in my mouth!"
"1","4","As other people have said, this is a very sweet recipe, and while using tart apples may help, it is still too sweet for my taste (that's with sugar already reduced by 25%). Next time I'll try reducing the sugar by half. There was quite a bit of liquid after baking, but that didn't bother me."
"1","1","VERY sugary. Not enough apples."
"1","5","This was my first ever attempt at making an apple crisp. This recipe was easy to follow and tasted very good. I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","Best apple crisp recipe I've ever tried. I agree with other reviewers, the water is not necessary. Otherwise I made it exact to recipe, using cortland apples (tart and great for baking) and it was fantastic. The crumb topping is decadent and would go great with any fruit."
"1","5","I double the ingredients for the crumb topping because my family and I like the additional crunch."
"1","5","First time making any kind of crisp, and I loved it. I had all the ingredients on hand, and it was really easy and fast to make. Followed the recipe exactly except that I only had about 5 cups of apples. So, I halved the cinnamon, flour, sugar mixture. I kept the same measurements for the oats, brown sugar, butter mixture and put half on the bottom of the pan, layered the apples on top, and put the rest of the oat mixture on top. Very good recipe."
"1","5","Yum! My first baking of an apple crisp. My friends and I LOVED it. I did double the recipe for the crumble as I wanted a packed bottom and top layer in a 9x13 pan ~ the way my mom used to make it. And at the suggestions of other reviewers I didn't add the water. Great with or without vanilla ice cream! I also don't know how much 10 cups of apples is, but I used 5 granny smiths."
"1","5","Great recipe! Little too sweet depending on the kind of apples you use. Next time I will cut the sugar in half, but we loved it!"
"1","5","DON'T ADD THE WATER! I had it all ready to pop in the oven, and was waiting for another baking item to finish, and checked the reviews, (Should have done this first, as I usually do). I tried to pour off the water, & out came a lot of the cinnamon, sugar & flour coating. Cooking time was perfect, but was still soupy from the residue water. Gave it 5 stars in spite of this, as I will try again."
"1","5","Delicious! I always use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Water is not needed on the apple mixture unless you prefer your crisp less dense. The topping is delicious. I make 1.5 of the topping. Sometimes I add a cup of mini caramels that you can usually find in the fall at your market."
"1","4","i loved the recipe but i would skip the water if i were you."
"1","5","Great dessert. I use half the sugar with the apples and double the oatmeal topping."
"1","4","It was good but a little sweeter than I like but it had good flavor. I will be making this again just 1/4 cup less sugar. Thanks, Happy Cooking!"
"1","4","Great recipe, the only thing I would change was 1/2 cup of white sugar. A bit sweet."
"1","5","Delicious!! Best part about it is the crumb topping! Next time I'm going to make double the amount of the crumb topping because that's the best part! Also I cooked my apples on the stove too for Abt 10 min and I ended up only baking it for exactly 20 min. It's much more fun seeing the apples cook!"
"1","5","Made this for my husband because he loves cobblers so I thought I would give it a try. We loved it! Definitely really sweet! Went great with a glass of milk!"
"1","5","Are you kidding? This is heaven on earth. Agree with recommendations to reduce water and increase topping amounts."
"1","2","Too Sweet. Twelve servings contains 2 cups of sugar. That's 96 teaspoons sugar/12 servings = 8 teaspoons of sugar in a serving. Yech! Sweet isn't supposed to be a flavor. I will cut the sugar in half next time so I can taste the tartness of the apples."
"1","3","Very good , omit water add a couple tbls apple cidar to bottom of pan instead, not very crumbly on top so I added more oats. I used granny smith apples"
"1","5","Perfect, wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","5","I made this, as written, tonight for a quick apple dessert and it is perfect! It was easy to put together from ingredients on hand and was a hit with my family. I like that the cinnamon wasn't overpowering and that the crisp topping was made without any spice. It's nice to actually taste the sweetened apples. Keeper!"
"1","5","Best apple crisp recipe...period!"
"1","5","Outstanding- the best apple crisp I've had. I didn't measure the apples. I just filled a glass 13x9 dish (size in the recipe) almost to the top. I had a combination of apples, including many McIntosh, which tend to be more watery. Also used Crispin and Spartan varieties because that's what I had. I cut the water in half, but using the full amount in the recipe probably would not do harm- especially if using apples other than McIntosh. I don't know why people are complaining of so much liquid after baking. The recipe calls for 1 cup + flour which should absorb liquid.- maybe they didn't follow the recipe. The recipe is not too sweet if you use enough fruit, as a 13X9 pan implies. Some people are using 5 apples or peaches . That is not going to make 10 cups or even fill the pan."
"1","5","Wow! This stuff should be illegal. It's too bad it's fattening. O well, it's so worth every calorie. I used whatever apples I had and turned out perfect. Better than mom's and mother in law. How'd you like that!"
"1","2","Very very good. I enjoyed the crumble on top of the crisp. I used pre-frozen apples I had picked last year so I didn't need the water. Turned out wonderful. Ice cream is a must as it steps it up even more."
"1","5","Didn't change anything and it was great!!! Definitely a little sweet (which I love) and the Macoun apples I'd had picked a few weeks earlier were perfect in this recipe. It was a little watery but it didn't ruin anything. The flavor was great and the topping would be good all buy itself! I had no issues with it crumbling and the oats really made it. This recipe really is great and was very simple to make. Will definitely be sharing during the holidays!"
"1","5","Love this recipe! Have one on the oven now but made it with blueberries to celebrate Royals in the World Series. #beroyal #takethecrown #crownmebaby #kcroyals"
"1","5","Other than adding a small container of blackberries, I made this as written. Loved by all. Next time I will double the crisp. Thanks Diane!"
"1","5","Man, this is the way apple crisp ought to taste. So hearty, rustic, and substantial. A co-worker gave my wife a box of apples and this was a great way to use some of them. I forgot to add the water, but it wasn't a problem. I may use half the water called for next time, but even without it, the apple crisp was plenty moist. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!"
"1","4","So yummy! Like others, I halved the apples and mix (for 2 people) but made the full topping mix. I thought it came out a little watery but hadn't read the comments. Next time I will cut the water in half too."
"1","5","Love it. I've made this often. Changes I do now are Made this. 1/2 the apple and left topping same. Used water. Put half topping on bottom. 1/4 nutmeg to apple mixture."
"1","5","This recipe is easy to make, but HUGE on flavor! My husband usually just simply comments that something is good or not. He stated that this crisp has the perfect balance- I almost fell over! As many reviewers stated, you don't need the water. I used half each of brown and white sugars (Splenda), about 10 Granny Smith, and 6 Gala apples for the fruit base. I grated a little fresh nutmeg in with the sugar that goes over the apples. Next time I will add half again as much topping- it was the best part. The tart, soft apples play nicely against the sweet crunchy topping perfectly. My kitchen smelled heavenly, and my husband asked for seconds. Thanks, Diane, for this fantastic recipe."
"1","5","Yum, yum and yum."
"1","5","It was delicious!"
"1","5","This was easy to make and phenomenal! Excellent as a left over too."
"1","5","Totally delicious!  I made mine GF by exchanging reg flour for my own GF blend."
"1","5","Absolutely LOVE this!!! It's fast, simple, and so so GOOD!! My kids and family love it!"
"1","5","Followed recipe exactly, and it was absolutely fantastic!"
"1","5","I'll give this 5 stars too. I made it just as written with half the amount of water. However I'm telling you .... You don't need NEAR that much sugar!!! It's a keeper but I'd diminish the sugar by at least 1/3!"
"1","4","Delicious recipe! My family loves this and I have made it several times. I think I will make it for Thanksgiving! I found using only 1/2 cup of the white sugar was sweet enough!"
"1","4","Awesome recipe! I made my crisp in to individual sized tarts, they were a great success. I added 1 tsp of nutmeg, used half the water and double the topping. Chopped my apples to bite sized pieces, filled my tart shells, pressed on the topping and baked for 35min. I will definitely use this recipe again, it was yummy!"
"1","5","Delicious!! My only error was slicing the apples too thin. I used a mandolin, but next time Im going to use the thickest setting. Sooo perfect with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! Wow, is it delicious! Great recipe."
"1","5","This recipe is delicious! I follow the recipe exactly - and its always the first dish to disappear at pot lucks.   Any tart apples will work!"
"1","5","Awesome! . I doubled the topping recipe cut the water in half and added 1 cup of pecans. Mine came out super crunchy and perfect. Baked mine for about 45-60 minutes. I used a mix of red and green apples and dipped my apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture before pouring it on them. . I cut my apples thick and also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to them. Do these things and yours will come out perfect. Love this recipe."
"1","5","So good! My family loved it! I decreased the water to 1/4 cup and it turned out great. Definitely will make this again!"
"1","4","Apple filling: Our apples were on the sweet side..they were a bit to sweet with the extra sugar from this recipe. Next time I will take the apples sweetness into consideration.   Topping: I doubled the topping and it worked well.   Served with vanilla ice cream"
"1","5","Delicious!! I did not measure apples, but used 10 granny smiths. Stirred apples/sugar before adding water. Baked longer than instructions bc slices were pretty think, but should have followed instructions - apples were a little mushy. Will definitely make again!"
"1","5","Listened to a lot of the tips in other reviews... doubled the crumble (for a layer on the bottom), halved the water (used galas so only used half the sugar) which I added to the sugar mixture and tossed it all together (instead of pouring the water over it into the dish).  AMAZING reviews from the full fam."
"1","5","very easy and my first time making it thanks it's out of this world and my house smells so good!"
"1","5","simply the best apple crisp recipe I'be ever had!"
"1","5","Perfect consistency. I made 1.5 times the topping and it was divine!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! Every time I make this it is gone within a day. One of our favorite fall recipes."
"1","5","Very easy recipe that tasted wonderful."
"1","4","So good! I was out of shortening so I substituted with butter and reduced the salt. I also like mixing the apple variety making a nice combo of sweet and tart thru out the dish."
"1","5","This is my absolute favorite apple crisp recipe EVER!!! I have made this with the double crust as suggested, with only a single crust,with and without crushed pecans, in a 9x13 pan and in an 8x8. And it has never turned out bad. It's just THAT GOOD!!"
"1","2","Holy moly, this was wayyyy too sweet!! If I were to make this again, I would use only half the sugar."
"1","4","Love it.??"
"1","5","Incredibly good and so very easy. I know some people said don't use the water. I did and it came out just fine. Also added some pecans. Had a group of people over and everyone loved it!"
"1","5","Great recipe! I used Granny Smith apples and decreased the water to 1/4 cup based on people's suggestions. I also added a bit of nutmeg and tossed the apples in the cinnamon mixture before placing them in the pan. I tried doubling the crumble part and layering the crumble and apples to make bars, but this ended up having an unfavorable crisp to apple ratio. I tried it with a one to one like it's written and it's definitely better with just one layer each."
"1","5","I have tried a few recipes on here looking for a good apple crisp and this recipient is a keeper I loved it and I didn't have granny apples I used gala apples and I read other reviewers about the water I still used water just 1/4c of water and it turned out very yummy thank you for sharing"
"1","5","Yeah this is one of the best crisps recipes. I have tried hard to get the 'crisp' crust right and this recipe is the perfect combination of crispy chewy crunchy yummy. Wow. I really just said that..."
"1","3","Way too sugar sweet with that 1 cup of white sugar over the apples. I used baking apples too. This crumb topping was (yawn) very basic. Would had pecans or walnuts, as an option."
"1","5","This is so delicious! I had never made apple crisp. I followed other reviews and did not melt the butter (I cut in the butter) and added just a little water. The crumble is divine. I could eat this everyday. Thanks!"
"1","2","Total mush of apples."
"1","3","I made this as directed. The apples turned to mush so next time I would cut the bake time down. The flavor was great."
"1","5","Excellent! The top gets nice and crispy. I used a little less sugar, and half the water called for. I made half the amount of apples in a 9x9 but left the topping amount the same and it was perfect."
"1","5","I made this for my husband and daughter for dessert tonight and it was just delicious. I followed the recipe to a t. Was very easy to put together and took very little time before I had it baking in the oven. I served with vanilla ice cream."
"1","3","Sweet. Made with Granny Smiths. I followed the recipe except I forgot to add the water! I'm glad I did, it was somewhat watery anyways. I also added the nutmeg as previous reviewers suggested. A side of ice cream was a perfect (almost necessary) complement to this dessert.   In the future, I'll continue to omit the water, add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, cut the sugar a bit and double the topping."
"1","5","Made it tonight, forgot to add the water and the topping was already on, so I poured about 1/4 cup of water down the edge and let it seep around the bottom. This was a very happy accident. After letting the apple crisp rest for 45 minutes...it was not soupy and the best I've made so far. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","I cut the liquid to about a quarter cup, used cider and skipped the white sugar. Added nutmeg, cloves and powdered ginger. Used a 9x9 pan with fewer apples and same amount of topping. Best. Thing. Ever."
"1","5","I make this every fall and it is a huge hit among my family and friends!! As someone else posted I cut the amount of water I pour over the apples, in half. Then I also double the crust recipe, but I put it all on top. Turns out amazing and perfect every time!!! This recipe is a serious hit!!"
"1","4","This recipe is absolutely amazing! We made this per the recipe and it was just superb. Our 17 year old son helped make it with me and he is loving it!! This is our new recipe for Apple crisp. As long as the men in our house is happy, we have a happy family. :)"
"1","3","I would NOT add the water, ended up with a runny mess in the pan. It was an OK flavor, but could have been better."
"1","5","Delicious. Did not peel the apples. Easy to make gluten free. (Use sorghum flour or a GF flour mix.) It may have been slightly too sweet but I used tart apples so it was perfect. Also added a touch of nutmeg but it probably made no difference. But next time in going to make it with tapioca granules on the apples instead of flour. Just personal legends but I didn't think about it until it was too late."
"1","5","Oh my! My husband who always has something to say about new recipes I try, RAVED over this one with his first bite! I did add about 1/2 tsp nutmeg, but it is perfect just the way it is! Thank you for posting Diane!!!"
"1","4","Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly except I halfed it and baked it in an 8' square pan. I gave it 4 stars because it was a bit too sweet. Next time I will add less white sugar. Topping was fine!"
"1","4","VERY sweet! Delicious, but I will cut back on the white sugar next time :)"
"1","5","This recipes is awesome and easy to make! I would definitely recommend this recipe!"
"1","5","Winner every time, as is. No changes needed! :D"
"1","5","Our favorite recipe, just add half the sugar to the apples, and we added caramel sauce to the top for extra awesomeness ;)"
"1","5","Great recipe. Followed as written."
"1","4","This is a good apple crisp recipe. I gave it 4 stars based on making it as written. I like that this recipe is a bit different than some because you add additional liquid to the apples so that they bake up a bit saucier. The second time making the recipe I made a few changes which makes it more like a 5 star recipe. I used less sugar with the apples - about 2/3 cup. I also used apple juice instead of water because I had it on hand for another recipe. I 1 and 1/2'd the topping so I would have more - but doubling the topping seemed like too much for me. Also when doing that I used 1/2 c. margarine and 1/4 cup canola oil. (I always use a bit of oil in my fruit crisp topping, as I think it makes it crunchier.) The apples I used weren't the most flavorful - someone gave them to me from off of their tree. But, even so the crisp was very yummy. Someone suggested to me, to add some lemon juice, about 2 TBL, to the apples to give them a tarter, more flavorful taste. Next time, if I don't use Granny Smiths, I'll try that!"
"1","5","My new all time favorite recipe for apple crisp. Super easy. Wonderful crunchy sugar coated top."
"1","5","Made it as directed... So good. Will try a few suggested alternatives from other reviews in the future while making (nutmeg, less water...) but was good as is. Only thing I recommend to people making this is to make sure you don't cut the apples to thin ( I did on some and they came out really mushy)."
"1","5","I used honey crisp apples and followed the directions. Oh so yummy@!!"
"1","5","Tasted wonderful. I didn't add the water and it was perfect! Love this recipe! I recommend it!"
"1","4","I love the taste of this recipe but it didn't have the 'crisp' I wanted. I substituted Japanese style, plain Panko bread crumbs in place of the oatmeal. Wow. Gives new meaning to the word crisp."
"1","5","Turned out WONDERFUL! Just minus the 1/2 cup of water next time and maybe make more of the crumbly topping YUM!"
"1","5","First several times I made this recipe as stated, and it is delicious. I have since then increased the crisp since that's my favorite part of apple crisp, so I add another half cup of oats, flour, brown sugar and stick of butter. Otherwise this recipe is perfect as is. I'd recommend honey crisp apples or Red Ida; and if you find they are particularly juicy, you can forgo the water."
"1","4","Good recipe but too sweet for my liking. I doubled the crumble and cut the butter in rather than melting it. I mixed the flour and sugar into the apples rather than sprinkling. In addition I added the zest of 1 lemon and the juice from 1/2 a lemon so I cut back the water to 1/4 cup. Also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg , 1/8 TSP cloves and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  For next time, I'd use half the amount of sugar both in the apple mix and the crumble. Especially if you intend to serve with ice cream!"
"1","4","Overall this recipe was pretty good. My daughter loved it. However, I will be using a little less white sugar the next time I make it."
"1","5","I read some of the other reviews (glad I did too....) & learned that tart apples were best. All I had were red apples so I soaked them first in lemon water (then drained it of course)!!! WORKED LIKE A CHARM (very good!!!) I also only had whole oats. I fixed that by putting them in the food processor & pulsing a few times. I also doubled the cinnamon & added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Since I had soaked the apples & knew there would be some moisture on them I didn't add any water. This is a KEEPER!!! Next time I will take the other advise & add oat mixture on the bottom as well. Will be double-good then. Thanks for sharing this!!!!"
"1","5","Delectable! I doubled the crust, half on bottom, apples, sugar mix, other half of crust, sprinkle, literally a sprinkle of water. Very delicious. Will make again. Maybe tomorrow."
"1","4","Everything was great for us except it was too sweet. We used tart Granny Smith apples and still found it too sugary. Next time, I'll use 1/2 to 3/4 sugar, depending on the apples, and reduce the sugar in the topping."
"1","5","The only recipe I will use for apple crisp is this one.! Definitely a top favorite in my house. The only thing I add is 12 cups of apples rather than 10 and I add 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar mixture. All in all amazing very easy recipe.! :)"
"1","5","Excellent. The only change I made was to exclude the added water. It was perfectly moist without it."
"1","5","This was DELICIOUS! Don't change a thing with this one. Loved it."
"1","5","excellent!"
"1","4","This was very good, but way too sweet for me."
"1","5","Best by far, apple crisp we have ever had!!"
"1","5","We ended up with a bit of water /juice on the bottom of the pan. But taste was amazing!"
"1","5","So good!!!!"
"1","5","Perfect and easy"
"1","5","Made this twice and it is easy and delicious!I also doubled the crumb mixture so half on bottom and then the other half over the apples. Was delicious."
"1","4","Family loved it!"
"1","5","one word; mmmmmmmnm :)"
"1","5","This was a delicious recipe and my family loved it. I didn't change the water or topping amount as many of the reviews suggested and it turned out perfect! It was not watery at all. I did add 1 tsp of nutmeg and it added just the right flavor to it. Love this recipe and will make again for sure!"
"1","5","This was awesome! Thanks for posting the recipe!"
"1","5","This is absolutely delicious"
"1","5","I've made this recipe a few times. I never add the water tho. I also use xylitol instead of white sugar and I also use whole wheat flour."
"1","2","It was way too watery and almost too sweet. Won't be using again."
"1","5","this was by far the best apple crisp i have ever made! i took the dish to work and every time someone had it they made the mmmmm sound with every bite. we only had 5 people there and we finished the 9x13 pan!"
"1","5","My family said it was 'restaurant quality'! They loved it! Not sure it needed the 1/2 cup of water, but I followed recipe exact and 10 Granny Smith apples for me equaled 10 cups. Only time consuming part was prepping apples, otherwise easy, delicious recipe! It's a keeper!"
"1","5","Found this recipe to be easy and delicious. Just added a touch more cinnamon (as I like cinnamon). Bought ice cream specifically for this recipe. No regrets!"
"1","4","Very good! Halved the recipe, but kept topping amounts the same and it was perfect. Used honey crisp apples, 2 tbsp. white sugar and 2 tbsp. water. Will make again!"
"1","5","This was awesome!! I did change a couple things,(I always do ??). Instead of the half cup water, I used quarter cup of apple cider, and I also coated the apples with a tablespoon of melted butter before adding the sugar mixture. In the topping I added some chopped pecans. Served warm with whipped cream!! Best I've ever made!!!!!"
"1","5","This recipe is great! I followed others tips and doubled the topping so that I could put some on the bottom and on the top. I also mixed the apples up with the cinnamon and sugar mixture instead of pouring it on top. But it turned out great!"
"1","5","I added 3 packages of crushed Nature Valley Oats & Honey granola bars to the topping. Otherwise followed recipe. This apple crisp bursting with flavor and was to die for!!!"
"1","5","This was so good! We went apple picking today and all I could think about was coming home to make this! Thank you!!"
"1","5","Delicious and healthy. My three picky teens love this dish especially the topping. I myself like it very much even though I never care for cooked apple. Use green apples for a friend's tree. The recipe is perfect without being neither too sweet nor too greasy. Can't wait to repeat this recipe exactly as is written. Thank you."
"1","5","We used a really tart gravenstien apple so I still used all the sugar called for in the recipe. I did use only 1/4 c. water and it was perfect!"
"1","5","I loved it, my husband and me just loved it!! The only thing I changed was I did not add 1/2 cup of water, I used a 1/2 cup of milk. It makes it more creamier :)  I use milk in my apple pie, and pear pies to."
"1","5","Just made this last night. Made exact only thing I doubled the topping... So good! A keeper"
"1","5","This recipe was AWESOME! I did as some other reviews suggested and halved the water amount and doubled the crust.. it was delicious :) Our family of 6 had eaten the whole pan in less than 24 hours"
"1","5","Perfection!"
"1","5","Took the advise of others and reduced water to half, used Splenda instead of sugar and margarine not melted due to husbands diet restrictions, it was still very good."
"1","5","Followed other recommendations and reduced water by 1/2, tossed apples in the brown sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture instead of sprinkling on top, added a 1/4 t. of nutmeg to that mixture as well. Lastly cut in butter instead of melting at recommendation of others. It was AMAZING. Seriously I could eat like 3 bowls full."
"1","3","As written, I'd have to give this recipe 3 stars, due to how watery it was. I'll make it again, and just leave out the water. The flavor was very very good, and it was a really easy recipe."
"1","5","I had 4 apples to use up, so chopped them and split them among 4 ramekins. I split the recipe in half and it was perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. Easy and simple. I only had Trader Joe's ROLLED OATS on hand, and they worked great."
"1","5","Love this recipe. Its wonderful, and I have made it several times."
"1","4","This recipe was delicious. I followed the recipe and I would recommend skipping the 1/2 cup of water. It made it really watery on the bottom and I didn't like that. Other than that it was great. The crush added a nice crunch to it and it was a big hit with my family they loved it and it's great with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","Our family eats this up. Great addition to Sunday evening dinner"
"1","5","Great Recipe! I changed it up a bit though. I put the topping on the bottom (to make a crust). I halved the water and added extra cinnamon to the apples. I put a box of white cake mix (dry) on the top with a stick of butter. So basically I combined 2 recipes, apple crisp and dump cake. It was delicious...served with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","After read other reviewer's suggestions, my advice is to go with the recipe as-is. It's very good. Adding nutmeg will give a little extra kick, but it isn't necessary. Doubling the topping will make the dish very dry! Don't do it!"
"1","5","My family loved it! I will always keep this recipe on hand!"
"1","5","This crisp is awesome. I've made it a few times, and through experience, I've made just one change--I omit the water. The first time I made it, I was later tilting the pan and removing liquid. The apples give off more than enough of their own moisture, but that may just be the type I use (granny smith)."
"1","4","easy to make and delicious. Everyone raved about it. Topped it off with some vanilla ice cream and was a hit."
"1","5","Made a smaller version...it was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly :)"
"1","4","I really enjoyed this recipe! Many of the people who ate swore they loved it! I did change a few things based on my desire to NOT go to the grocery store. I didn't have any oatmeal left but conveniently had the Quaker Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal packs (the ones kids usually eat for breakfast) anyways, I subsidized the 1 cup of oats for 3 packages of the oatmeal (equaled almost a cup). Then I baked it in a deep square pan and for 40 minutes and the last 5 minutes i took it out and added a 1/2 cup of pecans and lightly sprayed with cooking oil and turned the oven to broil (maybe 4 minutes) and then pulled it out :) We enjoyed it warm with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream on the side!"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe!!"
"1","5","Absolutely fantastic! The best apple crisp I have ever had, hands down!"
"1","5","I just made this and it's so good that it made me weak in the knees. Of course, like other reviewers, I made several changes to the recipe: For the apples (I used granny smith), I coated the apples with the sugar mixture and left out the water. The apples create their own liquid. I also threw in some extra all spice to the apples. For the topping, I doubled the recipe and put some of it on the bottom of the pan before putting on the apples. I also threw in some additional all spice and cinnamon, as well as some chopped walnuts. As it was baking I thought the topping looked a little dry so I cut up a bit of butter and dotted the top of the topping with small cubes of butter. I served with vanilla bean ice cream, and I will say this is better than any apple crisp I have ever had in a restaurant."
"1","5","I can't get enough! I've made this recipe so many times and just realized I've never rated it. The only thing I do differently is instead of sprinkling the cinnamon flour mix over the apples, I place the apples in a bowl and just stir them until evenly coated and bake it at 375° for about 30 minutes or until the crisp is toasty brown. Thanks a million for a great recipe!! Oh, and if your crisp isn't crumbly enough before you crumble it over the apples, just add a 1/4cup more oats. PERFECT!!!"
"1","2","I didn't like this recipe at all. The topping was heavy (too much flour), and tasted like baking soda and baking powder (what was the purpose of adding those ingredients to the topping?) It was crumbly and dry, instead of rich and tender.  Following the advice of other reviewers to omit the liquid was a MISTAKE! I prefer a juicy, bubbling filling. This recipe also needs salt, lemon juice, and vanilla, which are necessary to create a pleasing contrast of flavors. So it was far too sweet, only because it lacked other flavors to complement the sugar. This was not the gourmet apple crisp I was looking for."
"1","5","Easy and we loved it. Used Granny Smith apples."
"1","5","Super easy and inexpensive to make. A favorite in our house."
"1","3","thought this was just an average apple crisp."
"1","5","This is the one I bake every year, multiple times!!!"
"1","5","Yes I've tried this recipe i even add some almonds/walnuts. Bake almonds/walnuts half cook. Then u add into the other half crumble batter on top"
"1","5","This is amazing!! I will never look for another apple crisp recipe again! Adding the water makes a lovely caramel its soooo goood! I used maple and brown sugar quick oats and it brought out the flavour even more!"
"1","5","AMAZING AWESOME!"
"1","5","Omg I loved it so much.."
"1","4","As other reviews recommended, I used granny smith apples, doubled the topping, added pecans to the topping too, and omitted the water. It made a huge pan and was still a bit watery, so I had to spoon some out. Next time use Mac apples as the granny smiths apples cook up very firm, and it was soooo sweet so next time halve the sugar. I think my teeth are going to hurt from all the sweetness, but my hubs and mom seemed to like it. I'll try this again, but only with some changes."
"1","4","Don't add water!!!"
"1","5","Amazing! I took advice from some other reviews. I doubled the crust recipe and put half on the bottom of the pan and the other half on top. I didn't add extra water but yet it was very moist because the apples had some excess water on them from rinsing them. I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust, I also added nutmeg to the apples. Using only 6 medium Granny Smith apples was plenty. This was my first time making this and it was a true success. I will be adding this recipe to my favs to make for family gatherings."
"1","3","I made several adjustments to this recipe. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger. Then I cut the sugar in half, in both the apple mixture and in the topping. I also used whole wheat flour to give the topping a heartier and crunchier texture, and I added a pinch of salt and about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts to the topping mixture. The end result was wonderful and flavorful, and the texture was perfect. The only problem was that the crust and filling were still much too sweet. Maybe next time I'll reduce the sugar by 2/3 instead of 1/2."
"1","5","I like how the sugar/cinnamon sticks to the apples when it's baking because of that 1T. flour! Water is a must, otherwise apples are dry. Yes, double the crisp part; yum yum! (I think I'll try adding pecans as someone suggested.) (I'm not overly fond of nutmeg myself.)"
"1","2","Way too much brown sugar. It really ruined the apple crisp. Very easy to make. Used a bit more cinnamon and added a pinch of nutmeg too."
"1","5","So delicious! Takes a while to prepare with all the apple slicing, but totally worth the effort!"
"1","5","There is a reason that so many people have made and reviewed this. So good so good. I used 12 small Fuji and gala apples, peeled and cut. I mixed them with salt, the sugar, cinnamon, flour and lemon juice and vanilla instead of the water. In doubled the topping and put some on the bottom. Cooked it in a 9 x13 glass pan for a little over and apple. Bubble goodness not at all runny. Crunchy crunchy topping. Nice."
"1","5","Made this for a big family gathering. It went so fast I didn't even get to taste it. Smelled amazing while it was baking, served with home made vanilla ice cream.  I only used 3/4 cup of white sugar on the apples and about 2/3 cup flour for the topping."
"1","5","Delicious!!"
"1","5","Fabulous -- simple & delicious. Make it gluten-free with Bob's Red Mill GF oats and Bob's Red Mill GF all purpose baking flour -- out of this world -- no one will know will guess it's GF! Only adjustment would be with spices -- add more cinnamon or add nutmeg. The water gives it a beautiful sauce! Cook at same temp but on convection for 30 minutes -- delicious, apple-y, crispy, goodness in a pan!!"
"1","5","This was my first time making Apple Crisp and oh my goodness it is delicious!!! You can really play with this recipe but I followed it step by step ( minus the nutmeg ) But it was still amazing!!! I would highly highly recommend this recipe for anyone! This is definitely a crowd pleaser!! 10 stars!!"
"1","5","We loved this apple crisp. I made it for a group dinner ad everyone loved it also. I used granny smith apples, which may have mitigated the sweetness. The only changes I made were to add about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and reduced the water to 1/4 cup (I forgot to add it until after the dish was in the oven, lol) It also wasn't served until it had been out of the oven for a few hours, perhaps allowing the water and juices to gel a bit. As a result, it was not soupy at all. It is my favorite apple crisp of all time. It will be made again and again!"
"1","5","I used 9 Green Granny Smith apples. Put the sliced apples in a ziploc bag with the sugar, flour, cinnamon and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Skipped the water (because I forgot) and doubled the oat mixture. Added french vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it."
"1","5","Make this for my family at Christmas and everyone raved about it! It is my go to dessert! I used Macoun  apples and they were wonderful!"
"1","5","I followed the directions exactly and these came out perfect. The family love them. Its perfect with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","Great recipe...even a picky husband has asked me to save it and use it. This has great flavor. I used 10, golden delicious apples (I hate it when a recipe says how many cups of a fruit/veggie and not how many of the fruit it's. Not everyone is going to cut the same apples the same, so 10 cups for someone, could be more or less for someone else). I also doubled the crust, but used Demerara sugar in the crust (on hand thanks to hubby thinking it was the same thing as brown sugar...needed to use it for something and it works great in this recipe)."
"1","5","This was fantastic! Like KATTELYN, I left out the water. I used Granny Smith apples, and I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was absolutely amazing. I took it to my Bible study group, and it was completely demolished. My husband was so mad we didn't have any to bring home. I will definitely be making this again... and again... and again. :)"
"1","4","Little too sweet...but good."
"1","2","Way too sweet. I would put a couple of tablespoons of sugar with the apples and the rest in the topping."
"1","5","It's a great basic apple crisp recipe. I think I will try another fruit like cherries or peaches, sometime. Yum!"
"1","5","Love it! I double the crumb topping and omit the oats altogether, and it comes out perfect! Serve wam with ice cream... It will always be a hit!"
"1","5","I put crumb topping on the bottom as suggested-very good"
"1","5","I love this recipe I did however make some changes I put a portion of the crumble on the bottom of the pie plate than added apple mixture on top , then sprinkled the rest of the crumble mixture on top sprinkled with cinnamon and in the oven it went absolutely perfect.... Thak-You for an amazing recipe,Cheers !!!!"
"1","4","This apple crisp requires some modifications to be perfect - as is it's a 3.5/5. Add more sugar, cinnamon and some nutmeg to the cinnamon-sugar mix and toss the apples in it otherwise it's much too tart and you won't taste any spices. Also, use a mix of Granny Smith and semi-sweet apples like Honey Crisps. I also found the crumble wasn't crumbly enough - it needs more butter than the recipe calls for to turn it into a nice crunch. Tip: change to a low broil during the last 5 minutes of baking."
"1","5","This is delicious! I cut back on the amount of water used. I used about 1/3 cup. Very sweet but we loved it. I will not use another recipe again."
"1","5","I make this recipe all the time and it always goes over well..its perfect!"
"1","5","asted wonderful and especially the topping yummo"
"1","5","I'd give it 6 stars! I made it as directed, but doubled the topping as some have suggested. It was the best apple crisp ever!"
"1","5","I love this recipe, it's delicious, I put walnuts in it and granola to make it more crunchy. I also put less white sugar."
"1","5","Perfect!! Doubled the topping. Also sprinkled a little nutmeg and mace in addition to what the recipe calls for on the apples and tossed to coat before adding the topping. I used cortland apples - apps 4.5 pounds. This was gone in minutes!"
"1","5","Loved the oats as the topping!"
"1","3","Halved the recipe in an 8x8 pan. It was more of just crumble - the apples really reduced (almost to nothing) which made the crumble part overpowering. I did use gala apples so I'm not sure if this was the issue. The crumble was delicious though so I wouldn't change that, would just increase the amount of apples. It was also extremely sweet for our taste! We had some homemade apple sauce so we mixed that up with the crumble and it was yummy!!! Will try this again with Granny Smith, less sugar & more apples."
"1","3","Turned out very watery. If I were to try again, I would significantly reduce the water added to the apples. Otherwise the flavor is great."
"1","5","I've made this several times and its a great recipe. I use at least 10 apples, don't add any liquid and double the topping"
"1","4","I did skip the water but also tossed the apples in a bit (half a lemon's worth) of lemon juice before the sugar/flour mix (and of course added nutmeg as others did but also put some cinnamon and nutmeg in crumble). I was making apple crisp to use up a bag of apples and think the reviewers who talk about buying 'tart, crisp' apples for perfect apple crisp need to lighten up! My apples were a little soft and sweet so I added a tiny bit less sugar and the lemon juice also helped brighten them up.I scaled it down to just over six cups of apples for my 4 person dinner party and it was PLENTY and filled a large dish and used up nearly my entire 4lb bag of overripe gingergolds. Because they were a little soft to begin with I cooked for about 5-10 minutes less than recipe recommended and it was very good. Just use common sense. I have made dozens of good crisps but liked the idea of the melted butter so gave this a try and am glad I did. Tasty and easy with the melted butter, which made a very crispy delicious crumble (which there was a perfect ratio of to the apples without screwing with the portions). 4 picky eaters agree- just leave out the water, add a bit of lemon juice, and give it a jab with a fork near the end of cooking and take out when they are at your preferred softness level."
"1","5","I made this recipe a couple of time and each time I wish I had a bigger pan!! I used a pinch of nutmeg and only a 1/4 cup of water but everything else I kept the same. Dish this with a few scoops of French Vanilla ice cream and you'll be in heaven. It's also good after a few days hanging out in the fridge and then reheated."
"1","5","Had to modify the recipe (as I practice in small portions), but it came out great! Not too sweet at all. Thanks!"
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp I've ever tasted. I've made it quite a few times and always receive fantastic compliments. I'll turn to this recipe each and every time! I didn't change a thing!"
"1","5","This was quick,easy, and tasted great. It reminded me of the apple crisp my mom used to make. The only think I would change is to cut down the amount of water in recipe to half of what is listed. Mine was a little watery..."
"1","5","Delicious! I would definitely make this again. I will try it with less white sugar though just to save some calories."
"1","5","So I can't give my own opinion for this recipe but speaking for my boyfriend (whom I made it for and he is an excellent cook) said it was absolutely delicious and was begging me to make it again! While making it, it seemed as though the porportions were right. I followed the recipe exactly and made no alterations."
"1","5","very good, I've made it several times. Don't add water and use macintosh or gala apples. I tried it with other kinds and it doesn't taste good. Crumble topping with your hands and sprad evenly over top."
"1","4","Perfect! Except I'll cut the sugar from 1 cup to 1/2, the apples are sweet enough naturally :D"
"1","4","Instead of water used lemon juice. The crumble is good but there's something off or missing, haven't figured it out yet. Would use a crisper apple next time."
"1","5","I made double topping and baked half of it in the pan for 15 min. for a bottom crust. Made the rest according to the recipe except I forgot the water. It may have made the crust soggy anyway. Used Granny Smith apples and served with whipped cream. It is amazing :)"
"1","5","all I can say is my family loved it!!!! I mixed granny smith with mcintosh,and red delicious was amazing.."
"1","4","I followed the other reviews: mixing apples with cinnamon and sugar and didn't add water and there was still juice in the bottom. I added 1/4 t. nutmeg and doubled the crust. It was very good but a little on the sweet side for me. I would cut down on the sugar next time. Great recipe though. I will make it again decreasing the sugar and maybe the butter to make it healthier."
"1","5","Made this tonight for my children's first crisp ever. Followed exactly as it was written & loved it. SO GOOD!!"
"1","5","I've used this recipe a few times now. I use BOURBON in place of the water; but only 1/8 cup, 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice with the apples( I like Macintosh) . I double the topping using mostly old fashioned oats& add 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice to that also."
"1","5","used a large sweet potato and the few apples i had left. added extra cinnamon. replaced half the water with real maple syrup. and this was amazing. will be making again"
"1","5","So. Darn. Delicious!!! I used haralson apples and made this with my favorite little 5 year old and two hours later and a scoop of vanilla ice cream we were all in heaven!!! great recipe and very easy!!! I did use a lot of apples, I just didn't think the amount made a big difference."
"1","5","This was delicious! made as written, and it was GREAT!. Second time, I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the crumble on the top. a very nice addition."
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I did make some changes that I feel made this recipe more to my liking. First, I used about 12 Granny Smith apples in a 9 by 13 pan. I mixed the 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, 1 tea. of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of ground up walnuts in a bowl with the apples tossing to coat. Place apple mixture in pan WITHOUT adding any water. Juice forms when the apples are mixed together with the sugar mixture; therefore, I only poured the juice from the apples over top. Adding the water would have made it to watery. I also doubled the crumb topping place a layer in the middle of the apples and the rest on top. I have made many apple desserts in my lifetime and one important step in avoiding a watery apple dish is to allow it to stand a couple of hours before cutting in to it. This gives it time to firm up. Wonderful crisp"
"1","4","Way too much sugar. I would cut the sugar in half. Other than that, it was good."
"1","5","Made this for my family today, and it was delightful. So easy to make! I will definately be making this again."
"1","5","I made this exactly as the recipe reads. It's amazing!!!! The best apple crisp ever!!!"
"1","5","LOVED this.... I have made it just as the recipe requires, and it was delicious (although I did have a little extra of the sugar mixture that I did not completely add in). The last time I made it, I added some raspberries (about a 1.5 cups) and it was AMAZING. This is a standard in our home!"
"1","4","This was way too sweet for my family (including 4 kids), and I prefer less flour more oats. Only change I made was grating a stick of frozen butter, instead of melting and mixing, to make the topping more crumbly. I do like that it filled a 9x13, I've always had to double or triple recipes in the past. I will modify to our likings, great starting point though."
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I used a crisp, tart apple and increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tbs and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. So yummy!"
"1","5","This is absolutely delicious!!! I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and omitted the water. I also doubled the topping! YUMMY!!!"
"1","5","Good crunchy topping. I omitted the water as others suggested, and it turned out perfectly."
"1","5","I love this recipe! I've followed directions every time and always end up with an amazing crisp! Recently I've played around with ingredients and added: dash of ground clove, substituted apple cider for water & sprinkled caramel bits over the apples before adding the crumble topping. I get raving fans every time I make this awesome fall dessert! Easy to follow recipe and delicious outcome! Thank you!"
"1","5","We always double the topping, but be prepared to have a glass of milk to go with it. The apples didn't seem to sweet, not sure if my son measured correctly or if water had something to do with it."
"1","5","I followed other reviewers suggestions: added nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mix, doubled the topping and only used about 1/4 cup water. So I know this is a little bit modified, but the basic recipe is a terrific start. I'm sure it would be terrific if made exactly as the recipe states; little tweaks are just personal preferences."
"1","4","I gave this recipe four stars... only because the outside of my crisp just never hardened and instead of using a 1/2 cup of butter, I had to use 1 cup... the measurements for this recipe Is off a little... I also suggest using pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon for more of a fuller flavor... and using 2 teaspoons of that"
"1","1","way to sweet"
"1","5","This was my first apple crisp attempt and it was great!!!!! I made it exactly as written for my first one and my husband absolutely LOVED IT!!!! I'm not going to bother looking for a different one. Thank you for sharing."
"1","5","Found this recipe last year. Based on the reviews decided to try it. I will never look for another. Sister added caramel to it and it made it even better!"
"1","5","Apple Crisp is my best and I love adding other fruits to it such as Blueberry, Strawberry,...,etc. Thnx"
"1","5","Fantastic! My family LOVED it.. Whipped up fresh cream and it was perfect!!! Thank you..."
"1","5","I made the recipe exactly as printed. I liked the balance of sweetness, and the presentation of the oats in the crumble. I will make this again."
"1","5","Hubby approved! I have made my fair share of apple crisps and this has by far turned out the best. I didn't use 10 cups of apples, I used 3 med mcintosch apples and 2 large. But kept all the other measurements the same. Asked the hubby what he would give it out of 5stars.. Without hesitation. 5!!! Awesome recipe!"
"1","5","I've made it 3 times and I get great reviews and it has become a request now @ family gatherings. Thanks"
"1","5","This was absolutely amazing! I bet the water wouldn't have been necessary but I followed this recipe exactly and it is just delicious!"
"1","5","wonderful recipe!! easy and delicious."
"1","5","Darn good. Followed the recipe exactly, using Jonagold apples."
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp I have made. I followed the recipe exactly and used Jonathan apples. The secret may be the baking power and baking soda in the topping as it stays solid. I halved the recipe as there are only 2 of us and it still was a nice size dish. This is a keeper."
"1","4","After reading other reviews, I decrease the water to 1/4c., added 1/4tsp of nutmeg, and increased the amount of topping (made 1.5 rather than doubled); it turned out PERFECTLY! Everyone hard a large helping with vanilla ice cream and raved about the apple crisp. I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","Made this recipe with dairy free butter and gluten free flour and it was amazing!"
"1","4","First time making an apple crisp, it was easier than I expected and it turned out quite good (I'm a novice baker). As recommended I used half the amount of suggested water and I added a dash of nutmeg to the apple mixture. I cut the butter into small squares in order to mix it into the dry ingredients as opposed to melting it. I used Gala Apples (since they were the only ones I had on hand) vs. Granny Smith but I reduced the amount of sugar. Though the final result was quite good I still felt something was missing - some vanilla extract maybe? Will definitely make again."
"1","5","Great flavor! Great topping! I only made two changes: I used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon and I left out the water. The next time I make it, I will mix in some cornstarch with the sugar, flour, apples and spice to help the liquid to thicken a little. Try pouring a little heavy cream over this instead of ice cream. Deelish!! My kitchen smelled amazing while this was cooking."
"1","5","Its awesome"
"1","3","The flavor was AMAZING! The water was WAY too much though. I actually had to drain some off once I took it out of the oven. Next time, I will only add a few tablespoons of water."
"1","5","Tasty!"
"1","2","well this recipe is terrible putting flour on the apples themselves made them absorb all the liquid so there for made it dry."
"1","1","apples were dry and topping was blend do not try it"
"1","5","Absolutely terrific. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe. I did double the topping like other reviews suggested, but that was way too much. Maybe 1 1/2 the topping next time. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Would definitely make this again."
"1","5","My new favorite apple crisp recipe. Lots of crisp topping."
"1","5","My grown daughter & I made this today & followed the recipe as written. My daughter & grandkids enjoyed it, hope they leave some for their dad when he gets home from work. I took two pieces home for me & my hubby. I ate it warm with Edy's Caramel Delight ice cream on top & it was delicious!"
"1","5","Absolutely what I was looking for - cinnamon-y, sweet, with perfect crispy, crumbly topping. Cut serving size to 4 and used an 8x8 glass Pyrex casserole . Still took 40+ minutes to brown the crisp. Excellent with ice cream. On a healthy note, this used a lot less butter than my previous allrecipes apple crisp choice. Recipe box keeper!"
"1","5","This really is a definitive apple crisp recipe. I used McIntosh and Gravenstein apples from a local orchard and the tanginess was top notch. I mixed lemon juice in with the water to keep the apple browning to a minimum, so that might have tanged it up a bit. Everything else according to the recipe, mixed it in a kitchenaid mixed which broke the apples down a bit to a very good result. Needs no ice cream, awesome for breakfast or dessert."
"1","5","Easy and very good!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly using apples from the tree in our yard. It was just! I'll make this again and again."
"1","5","This apple crisp was absolutely amazing! My friend had some and didnt even believe I made it. The crumble part with the oatmeal, butter and sugar all mixed together was to die for, try a little bit of it before putting it in the oven its great! So delicious!"
"1","5","Made with Granny Smith apples (used 10 of them). Added two tablespoons of flour instead of one and added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Had no issues with it being too sweet or too watery. It was perfect! I cooked it for 45 minutes probably around 400F. Apples were not mushy."
"1","5","Finally found and made apple crisp like my nanna use to make....made as directed with a small change of no flour in the apples, replaced with raw tapioca, that is what nanna used....I noticed on review commented on how there were nearly 300 reviews...I giggled as I looked at the 'now' reviews...over 3000!!!!! And I know the reason why."
"1","5","Absolutely PERFECT if you skip adding water. I used red delicious apples & it turned out beautifully."
"1","5","I loved it, very simple. I added cranraisins and dried cherries."
"1","5","excellent! pick apples off the tree and go for it!"
"1","4","Great recipe. The only change I made was using granola in the topping since I was out of oats. It made for a very nice topping. Next time I will cut the sugar (the granola adds sweetness as well) and cut my apples a little thicker. The water didn't need to be reduced because as soon as the crisp begins cooling the 'sauce' thickens. Others suggested doubling the topping but I don't think it's needed. It's pretty darn good just as it is!"
"1","5","The only things I did differently was to toss the apples around in (2) tbspns. of lemon juice and added a tspn. of vanilla to the water before pouring it on the apples. Deeeelish!!"
"1","4","I used Granny-Smith apples and rolled oats. Yummy."
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe I've ever tasted!"
"1","4","A tad sweet, but everyone loved it and it was so easy!"
"1","5","Baked smaller version using only two Granny Smith apples sliced in a round pie plate. Sprinkled some lemon juice over the apples. Actually I like using the water called for because I like my pie juicy. I used only half the topping and instead of adding melted butter to flour mixture, I drizzled the butter separately over the whole pie. Just works for me. Next time I will try suggested dried cranberry and walnuts. yummy!"
"1","5","Time and time again I use this recipe. Different variations, low sugar, different fruits, sometimes with instant (even flavored oatmeal), substituting coconut oil for butter....the list goes on but the basics of this wonderful recipe remain the same. Perfectly done every time. Thank you!"
"1","4","I never made an apple crisp before and was really impressed with how easy this dish is to make. I gave it 4 stars because if I went solely on the recipe alone I do not think it would warrant 5 stars. I made some changes.. Now as far as the apples go.. I used aprox. 7 medium Granny Smith apples and 5 small Fugi apples.( I have an applecorer/peeler/slicer) I however prefer a slighty thicker slice than the slicer produces..so what I did was just use the peeler, then a hand corer/slicer and cut those slices in half. I did use the amount of sugar/four that it called for; however I mixed it with the apples in the 9x13 baking dish... I added more than 1 Tsp. of ground cinnamon to the apple mixture to where the apples were generously coated, in addition I also added 4 rasps of fresh nutmeg to the mixture. I also reduced the amount of water to only use 1/4 cup. I doubled the crisp part added cinnamon and cut in cold butter and set the mixture in the fridge for approx. 30mins to chill. The bake time was perfect and after baking left it in the oven on the warm setting to have later after our main meal, the crisp held nicely. I highly suggest that you use Granny Smith apples as the main apple and Fugi for the remaining. I promise that you will have a nicely cooked apple and not applesauce =) This dish was perfect and not too sweet, I served with Dryers french vanilla slow churned ice cream.. omg was to die for!! I will make this again!!!"
"1","4","This was yummy and I'll definitely make it again. Because I needed to make it ahead and bake later, I tossed the apples in fresh lemon juice. I did not use nearly 1 cup of white sugar, I just kind of sprinkled it over the apples and MAYBE used 1/4 cup at most and it was PLENTY! I added some nutmeg as well. I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the topping which was really good. I did not use 1/2 cup water, thought it would be too soupy, so used about 1/4 cup. Also - I cut cold butter into the topping, rather than melted. In the end, I felt it was still a bit too sweet and might consider cutting back the brown sugar and leaving the white sugar out all together. As the apples bake, they do sweeten up a bit (compared to a raw apple), so I don't think quite that much sugar is needed. Also I used Braeburn and pink lady - a mix, hoping for sweet/ tart and that worked out pretty good, except all of the apples seemed a bit too soft, will research a more 'sturdy' apple to use next time. Also, will leave out the water all-together as that might have contributed to making them too soft."
"1","2","I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add any water. It's a good thing I didn't because there was a lot of juice in the bottom of the pan after baking. This desert was entirely too sweet for our liking. In fact neither my husband or I finished our serving and we threw the rest of the desert out. There may be nothing wrong with the recipe. It's just our personal taste. We prefer my old recipe for apple crisp and I will stick to that in the future. Sometimes new is not always better."
"1","4","I thought this was good but not fantastic. I added 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon for more flavor and I thought it was still a bit bland. I was lazy and didn't peel the apples, if anyone else is thinking of skipping that step don't! The skins didn't cook down which I thought they would, so that is my mistake and didn't judge my review on this mistake. The crumb topping though was very good."
"1","4","I ruined this recipe by using granny smith apples.... Don't make my mistake... Use Macintosh or a baking apple. Granny smith tart flavor killed this dessert. Husband still ate it cause he is so sweet."
"1","4","I made a half batch of this recipe, but made the original size amount of crust. The flavor on this was just so so for me. Kind of bland. Next time I'll up the brown sugar and cinnamon and add vanilla. I only used 1/8 cup of water and that seemed to work fine. It was ok, but I'll definitely increase the seasonings for next time."
"1","5","I love love this recipe and so does my family!"
"1","5","Very easy to make gluten free. :-)"
"1","5","Wow so easy and sooo good!"
"1","4","The original recipe is very good. With my tweaking, I would rate it 5stars. The oatmeal should be substituted with Old fashioned oats for a coarser more rustic crumble, I replace the cinnamon with apple pie spice, and adjust the amount of white sugar based on the sweetness of the apples I'm using. I also only use melted 'butter spread' like Country Crock, to cut back on the calories & cholesterol that would be added with real butter. Oh, and forget the water.. what the heck is that for?"
"1","5","This was delicious! We all loved it! :) I did not peel the apples and used a combo of red delicious and granny apple. We topped it with homemade whipped cream. The only thing I would change is maybe cut down the sugar a bit. I think it would still taste great and be a bit healthier!"
"1","5","Perfect apple crisp. Tossed Jazz apples with the cinnamon, sugar, and flour, then added topping."
"1","4","i hav addjusted this recipe some. using a lil less brown sugar and adding a lil more cinnimon. the brown sugar made it extremely sweet and i love cinn."
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever made! It was also very easy to make. I eliminated the water that the recipe calls for and there was an adequate amount of moisture at the end of baking. I also added an additional 2 cups of apples. It is a hit with family and friends and others have requested this recipe from me!"
"1","5","i followed this recipe exactly except i doubled the topping and it came out great. the water is what makes the gooey saucyness in the apples. next time i will half the white sugar though, it doesnt need it."
"1","4","The basic recipe is very good. After reading several other reviews I elected to double the topping...it was a bit too much. I would probably go with 1 1/2 times the recipe. As well, I would up the butter just a bit. Very tasty and definitely better with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","Perfect."
"1","5","This recipe is WONDERFUL! I've made a few changes to fit my family. Substitute nutmeg for the cinnamon (my daughter's allergic) and use cornstarch instead of flour to thicken. I also add a little nutmeg to the crumble and toss in some chopped slivered almonds for additional flavor and crunch - even crunchy when reheated in microwave! Unlike some, I use the water because we like a lot of juice. It's a cross between a crisp and a cobbler. This is definitely a keeper that I make often!"
"1","5","Delish! But next time I would bake it longer and slice the apples thinner."
"1","5","Made with Mutsu apples, will probably use Granny Smith next time. Didnt add water and would probably add a pinch of salt next time. Great recipe, really crispy topping!"
"1","5","best ever!"
"1","5","This is by far the best apple crisp recipe I have ever had. My dad used to make it just like this when I was little, so it definitely has a homey feel to it. I've found it can be made easily with gluten free ingredients, and it doesn't taste any different. I just use my gluten free flour mix which consists of corn flour, rice flour, tapioca starch and zanthum gum. I only use about 2/3 of the sugar recommended in this recipe otherwise it's much too sweet. Also, this recipe should definitely specify using granny smith apples. Any other apple is too sweet or not acidic enough, it just tastes like eating sugar. If you don't have granny smith apples on hand, just pour some lemon juice or vinegar on the apples and it tastes just about the same. As for the water, a 1/2 cup is too much for me. I use a 1/3 cup and it's just right. That way it becomes more caramelized and less soupy. I add just a touch more butter to the topping, it makes it just a little crispier and tastier. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a people pleasing dessert. This one is staying in my recipe box for a long time."
"1","5","This crisp was easy to make and turned out great. I wasn't able to find good tart apples, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 C. and gave a good squirt of lemon juice on top of the apples before sprinkling on the oatmeal topping. I got the tart flavor I was hoping for and the sweetness is perfect."
"1","4","Way too sweet, even I already reduced the sugar. Otherwise nice recipe."
"1","4","This recipe is easy and affordable to make. It is very sweet and I found it slightly bland or one-note--cinnamon sugar, but still tasty. I think that this could be a real crowd pleaser for a potluck or something like that because it doesn't have any dairy, eggs, nuts or other ingredients that people tend to be allergic to or dislike."
"1","4","Very good! I doubled the streusel as recommended, it was great!"
"1","5","loved it!"
"1","5","Yum! This recipe is delicious!! I used Cortland apples. For the topping, here's what I did differently: I doubled the amount of oatmeal. I used half the amount of flour and replaced the other half with graham cracker crumbles. I also added some crushed pecans. I used a little less sugar than called for on both the apples and in the topping because the grahams have sugar to compensate. I used another 1/2 cup of butter for moisture. I doubled the topping because we like a lot of crumble. I coated the bottom of the pan with crumble as then put a generous layer over the top. YUM YUM YUM!!"
"1","5","This was fabulous! I had a deep dish crust I needed to use so put 3 cubed red apples directly in it and added the spices (1/2 of the recipe) minus the water. Used the same crumble topping (again 1/2 of the recipe). Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it! Will definitely make again...."
"1","5","i have made this many times and it turns out perfect every time. sometimes i forgetto add the water and the apples carmelize even more. i also have used the topping to make cookies if i dont have apples to use. love love love this recipe!!!"
"1","5","I used home grown gala apples for this recipe and although the apples are softer than green apples. The crisp turned out wonderful!! My husband and I loved it. If you don't want something so sweet lower the sugar amount."
"1","4","Delicious! I used 4 large apples and 1 small (3 pink lady, 2 fuji) and that seemed like a good amount. I baked them in an 8x8 glass pyrex and like others did half white half brown sugar and also just put a splash of water in with it. I also added nutmeg and a hint of cloves as I love those flavors in my apple baking. Four stars because it wasn't as pretty as I'd hope for, I felt like need modifications, and the texture wasn't quite what I wanted. But its taste is superb!"
"1","5","This is delicious!!! Next time, though, I will use less sugar on apples and I left out the water. I baked on 8x8 stoneware. I did use only 7 apples and 1/2 of sugar for the apples. I did however use the full amount of topping ingredients. I highly recommend this recipe. It's only the two of us. It's almost gone!! This recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","This recipe is so delicious!! I did make changes following other reviews. Cut the Sugar in half and made double the topping. Could almost even cut 3/4 of the sugar in the filling as well. I have made this 3 times now and it is truly a wonderful recipe."
"1","4","Great! I left out the water as well and doubled the topping!"
"1","4","I followed the suggestion of others and added a bottom crust but I thought it was a bit soggy. I will make this again but will make it as directed."
"1","5","Sooo good!!! I served this with pumpkin ice cream and it was awesome."
"1","5","Excellent! I did double the topping."
"1","5","AMAZING! I added banana to the mix as well. Tastes great with Cool Whip!"
"1","5","Crisp and tasty."
"1","4","This is a great recipe. The apples turned out tender bec of the water.Everyone loved it! I think next time I'll try putting a splash of lemon juice but otherwise it was awesome! I will def make it again."
"1","5","USED GRANNY SMITH AWESOME RECIPE!"
"1","5","I received many compliments on the 2 crisps I made using this recipe. I did make a little extra of the topping and pressed it into the bottom of the pan as a crust. And for 1 of the crisps, I omitted the cinnamon and added a scoop of caramal topping into the apples mixture for a more caramel-y apple crisp."
"1","5","This was a huge hit at my house. I have made it 3 times in the last month and it never lasts more than 24 hours. This is a keeper!"
"1","5","I loved it. My family loved it. I substituted splenda for both the white sugar and the brown sugar and it came out great! Will definitely use this quick and easy recipe again and again."
"1","5","My husband, in-laws and 17-month-old son loved it! I will definitely make it again! As others suggested I doubled the topping, added a little bit of nutmeg and cut the water in half. It was perfect!"
"1","5","I cut the apples in chunks, mixed them with the sugar, flour, and cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, omitted the water, and doubled the topping. DELISH!"
"1","5","I will never search for another Apple Crisp recipe again. This, by far, is the best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried, cooked, or eaten. I'd like to give it 11 out of 5 stars, but I can't, so 5/5 it is..."
"1","5","Usually I would just wing a crisp recipe... they are all pretty standard when it comes to composition...  That being said, this is one of the best recipes for crisp I have found. I did spiff it up a bit making it my own 'Caramel Apple crisp' for the Holiday season, but it was an amazing hit at the potluck I brought it to. I made it according to recipe, save adding a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the apple mixture and over the very top of the crumble mixture. It did take a little longer than an hour for cooking time, but well worth the wait. Just as one other review stated this was not completely done cooking in a 45 minute period at 350. I let the dessert cool for about an hour or so and just before serving warm, I lightly drizzled the top of the crumbled crisp evenly with that caramel apple dip (note that I only used a small amount, probably 2-3 ounces, NOT the whole container) that they sell in the produce department of your local grocery store and served it with Tillamook Vanilla Bean Ice cream.  There wasn't any leftover :)"
"1","5","I have made this apple crisp a few times now and my family liked it most when I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and I also drizzled homemade caramel on top."
"1","3","Do NOT double the topping in this recipe...I found it way too much. I thought there was too much sugar in it overall, I think I would reduce the sugar by half."
"1","5","Made this using fresh Honey Crisp Apples (LARGE) 4 Large apples FILLED my 9x13. I followed the recipe just the way it says and it was PERFECT better than my last one I made. Next time I make it I will add less water if I add any at all though (I think the water depends on the apples you use though!). Definitely making again!"
"1","5","I've made this once before and it was such a huge hit in my house that I have a batch in the oven again tonight. So amazingly yummy and a bargain when those apples go on sale. First time I made it with Granny smith apples and now I got some Galas in the oven and this time I used a sugar/splenda blend for the cup of white sugar. I'll edit this review and say how it turned out."
"1","5","This was sooooo good! I made this yesterday to bring to a bonfire/hayride. It was a HUGE hit with everyone. I heard things like, 'you really outdid yourself on this one' and 'you know where I live'. My search is over. I'll never need another apple crisp recipe. Thanks so much for a wonderful Fall recipe Diane."
"1","5","I doubled topping as many other reviewers did. This was FANTASTIC! Yum with high quality vanilla icecream!"
"1","5","I found this recipe because I had run out of yellow cake mix, which is what I usually use to make apple crisp. I thought this was MUCH better! I used sugar in the raw (turbinado sugar) instead of both the white and brown sugars. Made it for a Christmas potluck. It was GONE!"
"1","5","Excellent and will make every time we go apple picking and have a ton of extra apples. I skipped adding the water and there was still some liquid on the bottom of the dish."
"1","5","Excellent! I followed some previous posts about doubling the topping and halving the water, and I wasn't disappointed."
"1","5","Great recipe! My girls loved it!!! Topping was crispy and crumbly. Definitely making this one again."
"1","5","This was very good and easy to make. I use Splenda in place of the white sugar, guess it might help a little. Ive made it a few times now, when I use MacIntosh I cut the sugar in half but not the brown sugar. I wait till the apples around home arent getting eaten fast enough and use whats left for the crisp. This doesn't last long at all."
"1","5","Amazing! Absolutely nothing to add, except more please!"
"1","5","This is the recipe we go to when making apple crisp - I always love it, but last time the Mister didn't like the super tartness of the Granny Smith apples. Personal taste!"
"1","5","This was my first apple crisp that I ever made. My son and I ate the entire 9x13 pan in two nights. Best recipe ever. We are not generally over eaters, but we ate it for breakfast, lunch and at bedtime. I am making my second batch two days later. The only thing I did different was double the topping and a pinch of nutmeg to the apples. YUMMMMMMMMYYYY!"
"1","5","My dad said this was the best apple crisp he has ever had (and he is 64, so I think he has had a lot if apple crisp). I have to agree! It is a little different than what I am used to, as the topping was crunchy (unfortunately, I am used to apple crisp with a somewhat crispy/soggy oatmeal topping), and it was a really nice surprise! This will be my 'go to' recipe from now on. Oh, my family doesn't like nutmeg, so I left it out and you would never guess anything was missing. Truly terrific!"
"1","5","EXCELLENT!! Doubled crust, put on bottom and top and added nutmeg. Perfect with ice cream!"
"1","5","OMG! I made this Sunday after trying another Apple Crisp recipe a couple of weeks ago which I was disappointed with. I was hesitant because the recipe called for water but the finish product was delicious and that was without ice cream! I used Gala apples because they were on sale. This is now my go to recipe for Apple Crisp."
"1","5","This crisp is AMAZING!!! I added about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and only a 1/4 cup of water like some reviewers said, and I also mixed the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the apples. I went ahead and doubled the crumb topping because reviewers recommended it, but it was WAY too much topping!!! Next time I will times the topping recipe by 1 1/2-- I think that will be perfect. Also, I cut in the butter instead of melting it. I was so incredibly delicious! :-)"
"1","5","I think this is the best apple crisp I've ever had! Made the recipe as written. It was made it as a second dessert for a dinner party, and it won rave reviews...was deemed the best dessert there. Will definately make this again!!"
"1","5","Oh my word...This recipe was FANTASTIC. I followed the advice of the others and and doubled the amount for the crust and still found that was not enough for me so I ended up tripling the crust recipe. I also ended up baking it for an extra 15 minutes just bc of my adjustments. It was just sweet enough and the crust was golden and crumbly and made my entire apartment smell like fall heaven! I will definitely be making this again this season"
"1","5","The best apple crisp I ever made! Great and easy recipe!"
"1","5","Loved this! Rather than just throwing it all in the pan, my husband requested an 'apple crisp pie'. So I halved the apple portion, made a pie crust for the bottom, and still put the crisp on top. It was the best of both worlds!"
"1","5","I used Honey Gold apples and cut the sugar down quite a bit (1/2 cup on apples, 1/2 cup in topping). I always cut sugar down in recipes, and I would cut it down even more next time because I prefer my apple crisp slightly tart. I did not use the water as recommended by others, and the apples cooked up perfectly. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and cooked for about 55 minutes. My crumble was just slightly browned on the top, and the apples were bubbling around the edges (that's how my mom taught me to tell if it's done)."
"1","5","We didn't know how many apples equaled 10 cups and used 10 apples. We had to use a larger pan and doubled all the ingredients (except the water). By doubling, we made a ridiculous amount of topping and didn't use all of it. I think next time we may cut back on the white sugar a bit since there is so much brown sugar in the topping, but it is delicious exactly the way it is.  One thing I will note that I think made this stand out - we used Vietnamese cinnamon."
"1","5","fantastic recipe....."
"1","5","very good"
"1","5","Husband loved it!!!!"
"1","4","excellent! I used gala apples...next time tho will use less sugar....will be making this a lot !"
"1","5","Sweet baby Ray!!! This was so good that I just had seconds!I did add a dash of clove and instead of water,added Motts natural pressed cider.I also cut way back on the sugar.I did the crumble exactly to the recipe but did double it because everyone loves a good crumble!!I used a mix of granny Smith and jazz apples too...the sweet tart flavour almost did me in it was so good!!!!"
"1","3","Pretty good!"
"1","4","We liked this. I had some gala apples that were a week or two old. They stayed solid but were soft enough for my little one.The top turned out kind of like an oatmeal cookie. Soft and yet crumbly. Made it gluten free by using GF oats & GF oat flour plus xanthan gum for cohesion. I also added nutmeg.Will probably make this again, upping the oats to 1.5C and lowering flour to .5C. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious! My family loved it and I didn't change anything except adding less water as others suggested. I also only had whole wheat flour, I don't suggest using that. Mine had a slightly wheaty flavor that I didn't like but no one else seemed to notice."
"1","5","I think this is the BEST apple crisp I have ever made. Didn't do anything different!"
"1","3","For this recipe I used 7 cups of Gravenstein and 3 cups of Pink Lady apples. My family found this crisp way, way too sweet. I like that this is a simple recipe and I'll probably try it again, but with much less sugar. (Perhaps I can eliminate the white sugar altogether?)"
"1","4","Yummy! I don't like my crisp too sweet so I used Granny Smith apples and cut out the white sugar altogether. I also cut the water amount down to just 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg."
"1","5","Love this recipe! Like others, I omitted the water, made the slices larger. I didn't melt the butte but cut cold butter in small cubes and mixed into the oatmeal and flour mixture. Tasty!"
"1","5","These were amazing! We topped them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and they were the bomb"
"1","5","This was excellent! It had the perfect amount of seasoning and sweetness and the apples came out tender and perfectly cooked. My husband was convinced it was canned filling. (I think it tastes way better than canned!)"
"1","5","This is a good apple crisp. I made it with home grown jonnagold apples. The only thing I changed was to use Old Fashioned Rolled Oats, because that is all I had in the house. I think I might try brown sugar vs. white sugar next time I make it to give it a more caramel flavor. Pecans would be good in the topping also."
"1","5","I also omitted the water, and since I had no oats, I used cereal! (golden puffs) Turned out great! Especially good with vanilla ice cream."
"1","4","Pretty good. Because I added some blueberries it turned out a little soggy and the topping that I doubled didn't turn very 'crispy'. Regardless my family still liked it, and next time I will use only apples."
"1","3","Don't get me wrong, I love sugar. One of my favourite indulgences is fudge, but this apple crisp is far too sweet. I'd cut the white sugar entirely and let the taste of the apples speak for themselves. The crumble turned out well."
"1","5","yummy! big hit in my household! :)"
"1","5","The best apple crisp recipe I've ever had!  I used Granny Smith apples and didn't add any water and it came out perfectly. Next time I'll peel the apples."
"1","4","Good but not what I expected."
"1","5","Delicious!"
"1","5","I made with some stewed nectarines and it was incredible. Thanks for posting such an awesome recipe!"
"1","5","Delish! Thanks for sharing. This was really easy, and I had everything on hand. I had some apples I really need to use up and this was perfect. I halved the recipe because there are just 3 of us, but it disappeared right away. So it looks like I'll be making it again!"
"1","5","so yummy. i made mine not as sweet cause of my household taste. But still very good and makes alot. i still havent learned my lesson about making too much of a good thing lol"
"1","5","Didn't cange a thing and it came out perfect! I loved it!!"
"1","5","Great recipe. I got rave reviews from the potluckers. I did leave out the water and cut the butter into the oats mixture. Used early harvest (sour) apples and it was perfect."
"1","5","this apple crisp is delishious!!!! I have made this several times since I first rated this and it's still by far my favorite apple crisp! Btw I make it exactly as posted with no changes. It's perfect the way it is why would I want to change it"
"1","4","Deelish! Thank you! :)"
"1","5","great recipe made it for my family and before i sat down to eat it their bowls were completely clean."
"1","5","Yummmmmmy! Made it for Father's Day. I added the suggested 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2, and doubled the topping. Next time I will add a few more apples and put a tad less topping (although it was devine!) Will definately make again!"
"1","5","This is delicious! It is so good it drove me to comment on AllRecipes for the first time - it's that good. For anyone that doesn't like really sweet deserts this is probably not for you, because it is very sweet!"
"1","5","Fantastic! I doubled the topping, added a little nutmeg to the apple mixture and used apple juice instead of water. I did not cut down on the amount of liquid - I used 1/2 cup and it made the perfect amount of appley, caramely syrup. Fuji apples are my favorite and they did not disappoint in this recipe. Served with vanilla bean ice cream... Hard to beat!!"
"1","5","YUMMY!!!! Served with a little bit of Cool Whip!"
"1","5","LOVED IT! I made it exactly as the original recipe and it came out perfect! served it under hagen daz vanilla ice cream, yum! Definitely making it again!"
"1","5","Outstanding crisp!"
"1","5","My husband loved, loved loved this recipe!! I made this for our Memorial Day party with a 1/2 pint of blueberries, quart of strawberries and 4 or 5 apples. I took the other reviewers advice and doubled the topping. Will definitely make this again."
"1","4","My husband loves this when I make this. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to a T and found it to be too watery. The last two times I've made it, I only put a few tablespoons of water and it was perfect. I also mixed the sugar and cinnamon with the sliced apples and I added a touch of vanilla to it. Perfecto! Thanks for this recipe :)"
"1","5","I am pregnant with twins and had a craving for apple crisp....but had never made it and didnt have a recipe. I picked this one for how easy it looked and the great reviews. It did not disappoint! Small changes I made were to not peel the apples, add nutmeg, use only 1/4 c. water and I made a little extra topping. It was fabulous! And between my husband and I, gone in 2 days..."
"1","5","In my home this dessert lasts about 4 hours. Max."
"1","5","I have now made this three times and my husband and family love it! He is a huge Apple Crisp lover and this is now his official favorite."
"1","5","This tasted like the filling of an apple pie. I even got my husband to eat some which is a big deal in this house. I put half the amount of flour and white sugar and used only about 6 apples. I added a tsp of water in the apple/sugar mixture and then halfway during baking I poured water over the top, just enough to wet the crumbles on top. I baked it in a small convection oven so it worked well. I will definitely be making this again in a larger oven."
"1","5","Just made this for an Easter desert. It was so easy to make and SO DELICIOUS!!!! The right combination of apples to sugar to oats. Will definitely make again!"
"1","5","Loved it!!!! It's a perfect recipe, and not so sweet (what is great)."
"1","5","Best crisp I've ever made. I cut the water in half (still had plenty of moisture) and added chopped pecans to the topping."
"1","5","Excellent Apple Crisp, it is my go to recipe :)"
"1","5","Good recipe! The topping was to sweet i will put 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar instead of a cup and i did not use any water."
"1","5","This was the perfect apple crisp recipe! It was my first time attempting the dessert & it was very easy and so delicious! Highly recommended."
"1","5","VERY,VERY good recipe! We always make it and always will!"
"1","5","I added raisens to the apple mixture, and some crushed walnuts to the top for extra crunch...YUM!"
"1","5","This is now my 'go to' apple crisp recipe. I have been trying to find a great recipe that is big enough for a crowd and this one fits the bill. I have made it over and over and it never lasts long. Thank you for sharing it!! I also skipped the water with good results. I put it in the first time I made it and thought it was too soupy."
"1","5","This is an awesome recipe, so good. I cut down on the white sugar with the apples, forgot the flour and it still turned out great. The water seemed to help make a carmel syrup that was so nice. Used spy apples that held their shape. The topping is very nice."
"1","5","Didn't need to add any water and the crisp came out perfect!"
"1","3","Like the other reviewers, I would not add the 1/2 cup water. I would still add water, but not that much it was quite watery. If you let it sit after cooking some of the water soaks up.   I also found that it didnt have a lot of taste. It was sweet, but bland. I don't think I would follow this recipe again."
"1","5","This is a great recipe. I did cut the white sugar and water in half and add pecans to the crumble which I increased by half."
"1","5","I made this recipe with half the amount of apples, 1/4 cup sugar & doubled the cinnamon & a pinch of nutmeg. Also I cut the other ingredients to half but still put 1/4 of the sugar and still it´s sweet. I loved it."
"1","5","I added 1/2 cup of ground walnuts and sprinkled it over the topping. It gave it a nutty flavor that was non-intrusive. Yum!! This recipe is a wonderful middle ground in a family that 1/2 prefer oatmeal topping and 1/2 prefer a more cake like topping. This is the new favorite for both sides."
"1","5","This was so tasty. The whole family loved it. I followed the instructions as written. Next time I will try only half the water and half the white sugar. I wouldn't double the topping as I had plenty to cover a 9x13 dish. We served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I like cranberries (dried, fresh or frozen) in my Crisp just for an added tartness."
"1","5","I used to make an apple crisp that was similar to this, but I never used an actual recipe. I went hunting for something similar on this website and ran across this recipe. I just made a half size portion of this and my family loved it; my daughter is whining for seconds while I type. I made it according to the recipe, but I did reduce the amount of white and brown sugar. I think next time I will add a little more of both sugars and have some vanilla icecream to go on top. This is a simple and tasty dessert which I highly recommend."
"1","5","Absolutely Delicious! Although I did make 2 minor alterations, as suggested by previous reviewers, so it's more like a 4.9 star recipe instead of a true 5 :). I doubled the topping (couldn't imagine NOT doing that!), and I used only 1/4 cup of water (instead of the suggested 1/2) and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon to brighten it up a bit. I used Granny Smith apples, and they were just perfect. I noticed that when we cut into it the first night, there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan, but as it continued to cool--even into the next day, the liquid thickened into a delicious syrupy caramel-y sauce. Best apple crisp we've ever had--by far!"
"1","4","This was great! I halved the amount of sugar, and will try eliminating it all together next time and exchanging the water for apple sauce. I also doubled the crumble, and layered it top and bottom. Fun to make with my 2yr old son :)"
"1","5","Easiest, tastiest I've made yet. Used 1/4 cup water as others recommended."
"1","5","I used 2 15 ounce canned apple pie filling instead of the 1st half, but used the crisp recipe for my topping. Filled a 9 in deep pie dish and only needed about 3/4 of the topping. Instead of melted butter I used cold cut butter and used my hands to mix it. It seemed dry but after baking it came out perfect. I will use fresh aples next time and this dish would be perfect!"
"1","5","i made this for a dinner party. everyone loved it. perfect recipe. so delicious."
"1","5","This was great! The oats add a nice crumbly texture to the crust. I prefer to sprinkle the crust on top, and not pack it down. I used red delicious, so I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and tossed the apples with the mixture. I also added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the crust."
"1","5","very good recipe, made a few changes, omitted the water that is poured over apples all togather, doubled the topping part of recipe, and placed half of it on bottom of 9x13 then layered the apples and then the rest of the topping. Took to family dinner, everyone loved it and said it was the best apple crips they have had. Did not turn out dry at all by omitting the water."
"1","5","Added pitted tart cherries for some extra zing. Doubled the topping as suggested by others, but found it too much. Next time will make it 1.5 times as much."
"1","4","Good as it stands. Better with the reviewers' suggestion to double the 'crisp' part.   I botched one of my tries by using a different kind of oats. Very important to use quick cooking whole oats. Otherwise, they can be toothy."
"1","5","This crisp recipe is SO good! I forgot the tablespoons of flour that go on the apples. It turned out just fine. Not runny at all. I added nutmeg because I like the taste. :-) I used fresh rolled oats. I doubled the topping because I love it so much! After it was done baking the topping had a very light crispiness to it that was probably a result of the baking powder and soda. VERY pleasing!"
"1","5","Yummy! My 8 year old proclaimed this 'the best dessert ever!' and said I should make it every day (uh, no). He really like the oatmeal in the topping which was a surprise to me."
"1","5","Love this crisp! It tastes much richer than other recipes. I doubled the topping, but think it isn't necessary. It seemed out of balance with the apples. Stick to the recipe and it's good. Add more cinnamon and it's great!"
"1","5","Delicious and easy"
"1","5","I used Granny smith apples and It came out great"
"1","3","I thought it was just ok...nothing special. One of my friends on the other hand said it was the BEST she's tasted."
"1","5","Easy and yummy! I can prepare this in less than ten minutes with the help of my food processor."
"1","5","This is my 18-year old son's favorite dessert. He ate the entire dish in less than 24 hours and continues to request it all the time. Made it EXACTLY as the recipe indicates."
"1","5","This is awesome! The best apple crisp I've ever had. I omitted the water every time, and added a light sprinkling of brown sugar over the top before baking. I receive compliments every single time I make this."
"1","5","YUMMMMM!"
"1","5","Made this for Christmas!! TURNED OUT FABULOUS!!! Like many others said...I didn't add the water and it was perfect without it!! Gave a copy of the recipe to all my family members!! Definitely making again!!"
"1","4","the crumb topping needs flavor. you can taste too much flour. The next time i will add salt and cinnamon. I used Rome apples and they were a little mushy although I cut the water to 2 tblsp. i also cut the white sugar in half, to 1/2 cup and that was plenty sweet."
"1","5","Made this dish w/o the water and w/ a little less sugar and my whole family loved it! :)"
"1","5","Made this for our dessert for Christmas - and EVERYONE loved it! Made it early in the morning and just slightly warmed it up for after dinner. Added some hand-whipped topping and it was perfect! Thank you for sharing this!"
"1","5","Made this several times and it's always a hit! Turns out better if you don't over melt butter and really mix well with the oats."
"1","5","WOW!!! Made this last night, left the peel on Granny Smiths (6 of them) thin slices. Made to 'T'. last night was good, TONIGHT = AWESOME, all the flavors came together and the apples softened up nicely. Wonderful blend of flavors. Husband loves it as do I:) Will try some pecans or walnuts and maybe a handfull of raisins next time just for kicks. This Recipe 'ROCKS' HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Thanks for sharing, Diane:)"
"1","5","This is a great recipe. I typically double the amount of crumble and make one 9x13 and one 9x9 pan. I also only add about half the amount of water."
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! Also, I rubbed butter along the bottom of the baking dish, and then sprinkled brown sugar on top before adding all of the ingredients in the dish! Was sooo yummy!! Finished with french vanilla ice-cream on top!!"
"1","5","I had raving reviews when I made this for the last thanksgiving. The only thing I did different was replace the 1/2 water with lemon juice, it added more tang too it."
"1","5","Best Apple Crisp yet! I substitute the water with juice."
"1","5","Great receipe, I double the crumbs mix because we like it extra crispy."
"1","5","This was an excellent apple crisp. Fulfilled my hopes and expectations exactly!"
"1","5","Exactly the Apple Crisp recipe I was looking for!! Great way to use those apples that are no longer so good for eating out of hand. Works well to halve and bake in a smaller pyrex or deep dish pie plate."
"1","5","The best ever!"
"1","3","Way too sweet. Next time I would cut both the sugars in half. I was fine with the liquid and the cinnamon mixed completely through the apples."
"1","5","Wow! Only thing I did different was left out the water as others suggested. Next time I will also half the white sugar. Delicious, this is a keeper."
"1","5","this was pretty amazing. the first time it was a little watery, but when I cut the water down by half the second time it was perfect. I sliced the apples as thin as I could and they were nice and soft after they cooked. it's a sweet dessert, but that's not because of any flaws in the recipe."
"1","5","Simple and delicious."
"1","5","Awesome! My family loves this recipe!"
"1","5","loved it! i actually doubled the crisp... i think that is too much. next time i will make 1 1/2."
"1","5","I used half Granny Smith and half Red Delicious. I think the mixture of the two balanced the sourness of the green apples with the 'applesauce' tendency other people noted with the red delicious. It was perfect!!"
"1","5","This was the first apple crisp I ever made. I was very pleased with the success and everyone loved it."
"1","5","I made this for Thanksgiving as a back-up dessert. This is definitely a keeper for me and my family. I didn't change a thing other than halved the recipe and it came out absolutely perfect. I used Empire apples and they worked well. Can't wait to make this again!"
"1","4","yum, a big hit. i added orange juice, rasins and used old fasion oats as substitutes. very good"
"1","5","This is simply incredible!!!!"
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!! I've tried several of the apple crisp recipes and this one is a WINNER!!!! I will eliminate the water the next time I make it (it wasn't necessary at all).. I also used granny smith apples. Easy, fast recipe to make. Delicious and got lots of 'OMG, so good' from fussy family members."
"1","5","Loved this! We added chopped pecans with the topping. Served with warm caramel sauce and ice cream--delicious!"
"1","5","I loved this!!! The oats gave it a lovely crungy taste. I added a little sweet white wine instead of water. Will definitely be making it again."
"1","5","amazing!!"
"1","5","I made this one weekend for my dad and he has asked me to make it almost every weekend after. We are both very picky about our apple crisp and this recipe was wonderful. I used more than 10 apples because we like more apples. Since we used fresh Orchard apples I left out the water and still had to syphon off some juice after it baked."
"1","5","OMG sooooo good. Only change I made was to decrease the water to 1/4 cup and it came out perfect!! I was asked to bring this for Christmas dinner this year."
"1","5","This apple crisp is awesome! Everyone that had it loved it."
"1","5","Very good crisp I did double the topping which made it to much used splenda instead of sugar used splenda brown sugar also I cut the apples to thin my mistake anyway it's very good also I used stick butter which I did not melt just cut it in with the flour mixture and did not add water instead mixed the apples in with the sugar and cinn mixture"
"1","4","Great, easy recipe! Really tasty, a perfect fall food."
"1","5","I have made this recipe a few times this year and every time I have made it, I am asked for the recipe. Everyone loves it!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly...so simple. My husband LOVED it!!!"
"1","5","Best apple crisp and so easy to make! I served it with homemade pumpkin ice cream. YUM!!"
"1","5","I have never made an apple crisp before, but I seen this and thought, Why not give it a try. Very easy and my husband and 11 year old son loved it. I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing, Diane. I'm giving it 5 stars!!!"
"1","5","Great recipe! I doubled the topping and added 1/4 t of nutmeg as other reviewers suggested. I've made it with different kinds of apples and my favorite was with Wealthy apples. If you can find this variety I recommend you use them."
"1","5","Very good! Makes alot! Made as written and I wouldnt change a thing! Very easy to make!"
"1","4","my husband and I and his father had this tonight for dessert. It was amazing! my husband loved it so much he had two bowls! I cut down the white sugar to 1/2 a cup and doubled the topping and used granny smith apples. It was wonderful. Although 30 minutes in the oven, because 45 is too long as the apples will turn to mush."
"1","4","I took the advice of other reviewers and I only used a splash of water which worked out great. Also I did not melt the butter I cut it in...big mistake the topping came out floury and dry, MELT the butter! I also added a pinch of nutmeg to the apples(YUM) Depending on the type of apples you are using the cook time may vary I used granny smith and honey crisp sliced thin and had to increase the cooking time by 20 min. So melt the butter and use less water and it's delicious."
"1","3","I followed other reviews advice and doubled the topping and cut the water in half. I regret doing this. There was way to much topping and the apples were dry! When I make again I will follow the recipe exactly how its written. The flavors are nice."
"1","5","This was fabulous! Best crisp I've had. Maybe it is the baking powder & soda that makes such a nice topping. I used much less sugar, I tend to like things less sweet than most other people. I used half the amount of apple filling but the full amount of topping. That was a lot of topping, probably too much for most people. I was going to add walnuts but forgot, that's okay since it was great without. I used brown sugar instead of white in the filling and I didn't measure but just sprinkled a small amount over the apples. I also added some nutmeg. Next time I need to be sure to cut the apples into larger pieces, the apples got too soft. Don't think I need to try any other crisp recipes!"
"1","5","Sooooo Good!!!!"
"1","5","This is definitely legit! I halved the water and doubled the topping and it was great but i did add a little touch with my caramel topping..... 36 individual caramel pieces in a pot with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of butter simmer on low and stir stir stir set aside and let cool for 20 min then poor on top of apple crisp. you can thank me later!"
"1","5","Great recipe. It was very good, but like some others said you could cut sugar and butter and still get a really nice dessert"
"1","5","Delish! Very easy. I used some Red Delicious apples I had on hand, and I think i used 10 or 12 of them (they weren't very big). I did put the sliced apples in a gallon zipper bag, added a little lemon juice to stop them from browning. Then I added the flour, sugar and cinnamon to the bag and shook it. And, I only used 1/4 cup of water. Smelled SO good while it was cooking. Served with whipped topping and ice cream :)"
"1","5","Delicious!! I used granny smith apples so I added a bit of brown sugar to the apple mixture. I used just a tad less water than recommended and also doubled the oatmeal crunch mixture on top because that part is so yummy! It turned out perfectly! I will absolutely make this recipe again, thank you!!!!"
"1","5","I made this last weekend and it was a hit, so I am making it again this week and I hope to share more of it. My daughter ate half of it by Monday, so I told her to slow down. I shared the remainder with 2 co workers who loved it also! This one is a keeper and I did it just as written! Once the apples are cored and cut it is a breeze to make."
"1","5","BEST APPLE CRISP RECIPE EVER! There I said it! Stop looking at tons of apple crisp recipes, this one has over 3,000 reviews, how can it not be fabulous? I doubled the crumble topping because really, how can you ever have too much crumble on your crisp? I went wild and left the water at 1/2 a cup and it is juicy, but with double the crumble who cares? So go crumble crazy with this crisp and be ready to moan! Enjoying the good life includes apple crisp!"
"1","5","Apple Crisp was excellent, everyone loved it. I made some substitution/addition just on personal preference. I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice instead of water and added some raisins. Excellent!!!"
"1","5","This was THE BEST APPLE CRISP I'VE EVER TRIED. Amazing. I also halved the water, added some nutmeg and a pinch of allspice. Soooo good. Will definitely make again."
"1","5","So amazing! We had pink lady apples, which I think are sweet enough, so I cut the sugar in the apples in half. it was excellent!"
"1","5","Excellent crisp. Used my apple core/peeler and made the job super easy!!! Such a good & simple recipe. I used extra cinnamon. Made a double batch making two 9x13s & shared with my parents and our neighbors."
"1","5","Used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Tossed apples and did not add water. Used 1-1/2 times crust ingredients. Awesome--my family loved this. I'm throwing away any other apple crisp recipes that I have."
"1","4","I really like this recipe. I had to cut the sugar in half for the apples and the crumble, because it was too sweet. I also ran the oatmeal through a food processor. This is one of my favorites!"
"1","5","This is the best Apple Crisp I have ever made. I used fuji apples, only added a splash of water, and doubled the crust as other reviewers suggested. My family loved it so this will now be the only apple crisp recipe I use."
"1","5","Perfection! Aside from halving the recipe, I followed it exactly. It wasn't too sweet, or too soupy, nor did it need more topping. thank you Diane for this outstanding recipe."
"1","5","I use this as a guide b/c I tend to measure like Rachel Ray (pinch here, palm full there, fill up to about here). I made a roasting pan of this: filled it 1/2 way up with apples, (i did then sprinkle some nutmeg like others mentioned) and the other half with topping....oh so yummy!"
"1","3","Easy recipe and very good, but way, way too sweet. It over powers the tartness of the apples. You need to have some zing. I'd cut back on the White sugar."
"1","5","I'm eating this right now and it's wonderful! It's sweet and has some crunchiness from the oats. I followed this recipe exactly too. I'm definitely making this again. Some might find it hard to measure out 10 cups of apples. I peeled and cored 11 apples. I figured each apple would be just under a cup. Then I sliced each slice in half longwise again."
"1","5","Loved it!!! Cut down on the sugars by half and it's perfect, serve with ice cream is a must. I made mine in a pie dish using 5 gala apples, halved the flour and sugar, and topping as is, next time, half the sugar for the topping too, but still delicious. Yum!"
"1","5","I use this site all the time and have never written a review until now. This is a fantastic recipe, my family just raved about it! I used Jonagold apples and added 1/2 tsp apple pie spice to the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I think its better to to toss the apples in with the ingredients as it coats the apples better. I read the reviews before making this and only used 1/4 cup water however, next time I will skip the water altogether. I also doubled the topping as others suggeted. This is definately a keeper, one I'll be adding to our family favorites! Thanks for a great recipe!!!"
"1","4","I made this tonight, trying to use up some of the apples we picked yesterday. It turned out great! I changed a few things, based on what I had in the house. I used honeycrisp apples, and added allspice and nutmeg to them along with the cinnamon. I tweaked the topping a bit, using a packet of flax oatmeal mixed with old fashioned oats and sliced almonds. It gave the topping a little more bite and crunch. We loved it! I threw the apple mix into my cast iron skillet, topped them with some caramel sauce, then the oat mix and baked at 350 for 20 or so minutes. Will definitely be making again soon!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! I did everything but add the water to the apples. This will be my go to recipe for apple crisp!"
"1","5","Perfect! I reduced the water to 1/4 cup. I also mixed the sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture with the apples before putting in the pan. Didn't melt the butter, but instead cut it into the flour/sugar mixture and then added the oats. It was a hit for all!"
"1","5","This was very tasty and hit the spot for that after-dinner sweet we all wanted. My only complaint is that I would have wanted the crisp part to be crispy/crunchy, other than that, this was delicious and I would certainly make this over again. I used apples I had on hand - no granny smiths nor red delicious and it was wonderful. 5 stars on taste and ease. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","First time I have ever made apple crisp and it came out amazing! I have to eat gluten free so I substituted gluten free flour and I also used only 1/4 cup water. It was a touch watery so next time I will use a bit less water. Awesome recipe!!!"
"1","4","I will rate this 4starsonly because I found it to be too sweet. Could be just me as I tend to cut down on the sugar in all recipes. I used turbo ado sugar in the topping and it was absolutely delicious.I used Gravensteins the first time I made it and macs the next time. Both are excellent choices. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe."
"1","5","I made this apple crisp tonight for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly as written except for cutting the water to 1/4 cup. It turned out delicious. I would have to say it was the best apple crisp I've ever had. This recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","We LOVE this!! I kept all of the measurements as listed. The only changes I made were the following: tossed the apples to coat with the sugar, flour, and cinnamon, omitted the water, cut cold butter in to the oat mixture, and baked for one hour. Served warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream - delicious!"
"1","3","Too much oats, kids, hubby and I wasn't too impressed, will not be make this again.."
"1","5","This was absolutely amazing! It is the perfect fall recipe. I can't wait to try this topping over cherries and pears. I cut back to 3/4 cup white sugar because I wanted to taste more apple, but I didn't think about cutting back on the water...note to self for next time. Anyways, I loved it!"
"1","5","Simple & delicious! Cutting the apples took almost as long as cooking but this is a great version."
"1","5","This was amazing, I added frozen berry blend (blueberries, raspberries, cranberries) atop the apples before adding the crumble and served it with vanilla ice cream on top. AMAZING, and super easy, thanks for posting!"
"1","4","I used 6 granny smith apples. Added only 3 TB of water, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and added a handful of craisins. It was very tasty, not actually very crisp but that may be because we didn't let it sit long enough."
"1","5","Very Yummy!!!"
"1","5","Great, easy recipe!"
"1","4","I would add more crumble topping..."
"1","3","followed the recipe to a t - except i subbed half of the butter for applesauce and used splenda. unfortunately the apples came out extremely mushy, and the top wasn't crunchy enough to my liking. I think it could have used more time in the oven."
"1","5","This recipe is excellent and YUMMY! Just as good or better than an apple pie, and super easy. I suggest you only use 1/4 c water, not 1/2 cup water. Best crisp ever!"
"1","3","I thought this was good but not exceptional. It was a little too sweet, for one thing. I followed the recipe as written except for using cider in place of water. It did not seem to have enough bulk in the mouth. If I were to make it again, I would use a little less sugar and double the topping mix."
"1","5","I made this recipe without reading the reviews first. I followed the recipe as written. Like many of the others, mine was runny too. I was hoping it would thicken upon standing, but it has not. Next time, very little or no water. As a matter of personal taste, I used Macintosh apples. Very good recipe. Will make again."
"1","5","This was an excellent recipe! I did make alterations though, to fit in my dietary requirements. Here's what I changed: Instead of 1 Tbls flour on the apples, I used 1/2 Tbls corn starch, I then took out 1/2 cup of regular all-purpose flour and replaced it with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. Instead of butter I used a diet margarine and instead of pure sugar on the apples I used 1 cup of Splenda baking mix. I did use 6 Granny Smith apples, but followed the steps exactly, including temp and baking time. It came out great! Top is crispy, apples are sweet and delicious! Will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","I followed the reviewers comments, adding double the topping and omitting the water. I had placed the cut apples in a bowl of water with lemon juice to keep them fresh before I baked them,and after draining, there was just a tiny bit of water left, and it was plenty. That said, with those changes, it was PERFECT! Probably the best apple crisp I've ever had! Five stars isn't enough!"
"1","4","My family loved it. My only tweaks were since I was using fresh tree apples, I too used no water and prepared the flour, cinn, and sugar then threw in apples and stirred over. I also doubled the topping which was prepared by cutting in soft butter (not melted) and added nutmeg and cinnamon to that mixture. Awesome!"
"1","5","This is the first recipe from allrecipes.com that I have completely been amazed by! I followed the directions to a 'T' like always when trying someone else recipe and it's perfect. Absolutely amazing and great for fall!"
"1","4","This recipe is good but I added some nutmeg. I used a mix of Jonagold apples and Granny Smith, which has always been my fav combination for apple pie. Now, I always add a bit of lemon juice, about a tablespoon or two to the apples. It wakes the flavor of the fruit. My family and I like some chopped pecans or walnuts in the topping for extra crunch."
"1","3","ABSOLUTELY NO WATER - it makes its own juice. Also try with brown sugar and double the cinnamon."
"1","4","Loved this recipe! So simple to prepare and then just into the oven it goes. The only thing I would do and did is add more cinnamon! Nothing like a little more spice to truly make this a success!"
"1","5","Sooo yummy...wished I made a double batch!!"
"1","5","This was an excellent Apple Crisp recipe. I did change it a little. I didn't add as much water, I Only about 1/4 of a cup. I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. I also like carmel on my apple crisp. It was delicious warm with vanilla ice cream on top!"
"1","4","This recipe is really tasty. However, I normally read the reviews prior to making a recipe and i wish I hadnt forgotten this time. It seems everyone left out the water, which was a good idea because my apple crisp had some serious liquid at the bottom. I'm not sure if this is due to the types of apples I used (cortland and macintosh) or the water (or both) but I could do without the liquid gathered at the bottom. Otherwise a good recipe and I would repeat it with different apples and no water."
"1","5","This is delicious! I decided to only make 1/2 batch to start with but after reading the other reviews I went with a 1/2 batch of the apple mixture (only using 1/8c. of water) but stayed with the whole recipe for the topping of oats, flour and brown sugar. I topped it off with caramel swirl vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect addition!"
"1","5","Love this recipe and have been making it for years. I tend to leave the water out, i find that the apples are usually juicy enough. I always include a mixture of different types of apples and i double the recipe for the topping. It seeps into the dish and you get some in every bite!! Thanks for such a wonderful fall recipe, oh and you must pick the apples fresh if you live near some orchards, it is a perfect way to end a beautiful autumn afternoon!!"
"1","5","This recipe was so easy to make and so delicious. The only change I made was to use only 1/4 cup of water and it was perfect."
"1","4","We absolutely LOVED the taste of this Crisp! I did add some frozen berries (I did not have quite enough apples) and it turned out great! Next time I would not add the 1/2 cup water. My only complaint is that it was a bit soupy."
"1","5","this is very good - just like Mom used to make ! I thought it would be too sweet when I put in the sugar, but it wasn't for our taste and those of the guests I served it to - got LOTS of raves on it ! I used small apples from my tree - wish I knew what kind they are as they are good for baking. This is a keeper - thanks for the good receipe !"
"1","4","I think the recipe calls for too much butter - would cut by a 1/3 next time (crust was a a little 'pasty'). Other than that, excellent!! Serve warm, ala mode with a drizzle of caramel sundae sauce!"
"1","5","This was an easy recipe and wonderful outcome! Do double up on the topping. I did add some crushed pecans for an additional flavor and crunch! Added some banana flavor ice cream ala mode!!!!! Definitely a keeper recipe!"
"1","5","The best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried! I did reduce the water to 1/4 cup. I also only used 1/2 cup quick cooking oats and added one cup up pre-made pie crust to the topping mixture!! So delicious!!"
"1","5","I have made this twice this weekend...all I can say is....yum!! Made exactly as recipes states and everyone thought it was great!!"
"1","5","***** add a little more cinnamon"
"1","5","Made exactly as directed. and absolutely awesome. ive tried a few other recipes and no more searching for me..this is it!!!!"
"1","4","I made this exactly as written and thought it was a good recipe. It is very sweet, but i love it that way. Easy and quick"
"1","5","Fabulous!!!"
"1","5","This crisp was AWESOME! I see why the recipe has 1/2 cup water, as the crisp bakes, the apples get really tender. The only thing I would do different next time is cut back on the white sugar to 1/2 cup."
"1","4","Very good, easy and delicious! I would definitely decrease the amount of water by at least half. I didn't change the topping amount and it was fine."
"1","5","Delicious! Based on the reviews, I did edit a little bit: I used 8 small gala apples, 1/2 c white sugar and added a little nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also only used 1/4 c of water and it came out perfect! YUM!"
"1","4","Great flavor, but I think I'd skip the water next time. Mine was a little too runny."
"1","5","Amazing and simple! I used way less sugar (~1/3c) and brown sugar (~1/2 cup) and it still tasted great. I did not double the amount of topping as suggested by other reviewers but I cooked in a 9 inch pie pan."
"1","5","I am not a huge cook and am a beginner. I made this for my husband because I wanted to see if I could do it! I did, and it turned out wonderful!! I doubled the topping and did not add water, and put the first ingredients needed right into the apples and let the sit to get the juices from the apples out. I am now using this recipe for peaches (they were on sale)!! I don't know if it will turn out, but I am trying it anyways because all the peach recipes don't have the crisp topping I like! I also let the peaches sit in the mixture to let the juices out, so I did not add water. Ran out of Brown Sugar so could not double to topping, but I am sure it will still be good!!"
"1","5","I have used this recipe many times and it never fails to please. Every time I make it I am asked for the recipe."
"1","5","I actually used some of my canned apple pie filling (found on this site), so just made the topping. It was VERY good :0)"
"1","4","Everyone liked it. However I only used 2/3 cup of sugar with the apples and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I'd make it again! Oh, and I baked it about an hour so that the apples were softer and blended together."
"1","5","This is a famous, loved dessert in my home - very frequently requested. I do, however, double the crust. Overall, a favorite all around."
"1","5","Delicious! I did add more cinnamon and it was perfect."
"1","4","I doubled the topping and put some of it on the bottom per other reviews. I didn't add the water either and next time i'll use much less sugar. It was too sweet for me overall. Otherwise, very good."
"1","5","Simply the best recipe for Apple Crisp I have tried so far!"
"1","5","The subject line of the first email I got about the apple crisp was this 'KILLER APPLE CRISP!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG Heavenly' I tried the suggestion of others and made double the amount of the topping and put half on the bottom. I didn't use any of the water but next time might use just a tablespoon or two at most and back off just a touch on the cup of sugar that I mixed with the apples. If you like it extra sweet keep the full cup."
"1","5","I definitely agree with previous reviewers about cutting the water in half and doubling the crumb topping and adding a dash of nutmeg. Amazing recipe! My guests loved it!"
"1","5","So delicious!!! Definite do over!"
"1","5","I made this recipe for someone who was going through a hard time... and she LOVED IT!! She is constantly asking me for this recipe, as well as another plateful! I have made this twice, each time the fans were raving, and I have not even tried it yet. The next time I make this it will be for me!! I also doubled the crisp topping."
"1","5","YUPP!! This is definately the best! Everyone said it was the best they ever tried! I used all granny smith apples and I did double the topping! YUMM ! This is going to be a favorite from now on."
"1","5","Amazing! I've made this several times and have shared with family, friends, and coworkers - all whom have gluttoned themselves. I normally double the topping though - making one batch as the recipe calls for, and the other half leaving out the oats so it's just a butter crumb. My husband isn't a fan of oats."
"1","5","I've made this twice now and it is truly fabulous! Everyone will eat it and I love it as it is not dry like some apple crisp can be. I followed some of the other suggestions and mix your apple slices with the sugar/cinnamon mixture (no water) and let them sit while you make the crisp. Double the crisp recipe so you can put half on the bottom and half on the top. Super yummy!"
"1","4","So so so good! I did, however, double the topping and halve the water, so I gave this only 4 stars. Next time I would just 1 1/2 the topping, but still double the butter. It was fantastic!"
"1","3","Too much sugar!"
"1","5","Delicious!! I myself used red apples, about 4 or 5. It was enough to make two round cake pans. I didn't put any water in at all. I tossed the apples in the mixture instead of sprinkling over them. Also added nutmeg to the mix. So good, it's being paired with french vanilla frozen yogurt and it's just out of the oven so it's still nice and warm. So so good. Will definetly be making again."
"1","4","I used half blackberries (wanted to use some I had frozen) and half apples. I followed the recipe exactly, otherwise. I really like the topping. It's sweet and crunchy and chewy at the same time. Next time, I will decrease the sugar in the fruit and not add as much water."
"1","5","The flavor of this is fantastic! I cut down on the amount of water, not quite 1/4 cup, and still found it really runny. I also added a bit of nutmeg.  I will most definitely make this again!"
"1","4","this is a pretty good recipe. I did use tart apples & added all the sugar & water it suggested. I did not use all the topping as i felt it was a bit more topping than we are use to. Very simple & easy to make too"
"1","5","AMAZING!!!!!!!!! super easy to make and incredibly delicious!!! i doubled the topping and put some underneath the apples as well as ontop and it made it scrumptious!!! add vanilla ice cream and its divine =)"
"1","4","Good, but the apples needed more flavor and/or sugar. It's very good with ice cream. Also, I would add more topping next time (maybe 1 1/2 times more)."
"1","3","I thought this recipe was okay, but not great. My main complaint was that the crust was not as flavorful and sweet as I had hoped and it didn't crisp, even after an hour in the oven. It was really just chewy and bland. The apple mixture was quite tasty, though and altogether it was acceptable served with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Simple yet delicious! I purchased a bag of granny smiths that were a bit too tart and so I used them to make this apple crisp. I actually only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet for my family. I also used 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 1/2 cup and just sprayed the top with butter flavor Pam to save fat/calories. Yum, Yum, Yum!"
"1","4","I thought it was really good, but my family did not enjoy it. I would make it again. I loved that it was kinda creamy."
"1","5","I love this recipe! I use it for any kind of fruit and it always turns out great. I do not add the water. I always make extra topping and put it into a jar and keep in the pantry for extra quick desserts."
"1","4","This was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe. The only things I changed were as follows: First, I tossed the apples in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I used only 3/4 cup of white sugar because I like a bit of the apple's natural tartness. I add 1/3 cup of coconut to the topping. I didn't melt the butter, I cut it into the crumble mixture so it would be more crunchy. And, I used 1/4 cup water as opposed to 1/2.  Altogether, absolutely amazing!"
"1","5","I made this withfor my family and they loved it. My oldest wants me to make the crisp part all by itself."
"1","5","One word: Amazing. I too doubled the topping, that's a good choice if you like a better topping to apple ratio. I cut the water in half, but it didn't need any at all. I didn't believe the other reviewers.. but as usual.. they're right! I brought this to a church event and someone found me to shake my hand for making the amazing apple crisp."
"1","3","Sadly, I was not too impressed with this recipe. I made this for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. I took others' advice and made double the topping, which was a mistake. Since there was so much crumb mixture, the topping on the outsides cooked too much while the inside didn't cook enough. My oven is fairly new and I doubt the problem was due to uneven cooking.  After reading all the great reviews, I was really exciting about making it, but neither my bf nor I thought it was that great. Definitely better served warm with ice cream, but a recipe should be great on its own too. I can only hope my disappointment in this dish was due to doubling the topping. If I gave this dish a second chance, I would definitely stick to the original recipe."
"1","5","My other half loved it, that makes me happy :)"
"1","5","VERY good!! It didn't need nearly as much water as what the recipe called for, and I only had to bake it for 25 minutes and it was perfectly done."
"1","4","Quick and easy!"
"1","5","Delicious, simple recipe that was easy to make because most of the ingredients I had laying around the house."
"1","4","Very good recipe, I did reduce the amount of water, and made a little more crumb mixture than the recipe called for."
"1","5","Best apple crisp, hands down! I did make a few changes. I used honey crisp apples and they were pretty sweet so I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp of salt, I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the apple mixture. To the crumb topping, I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and two extra tablespoons of melted butter (i used salted butter). It was delicious! Served it hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce. Perfect comfort food!"
"1","5","Split the recipe into 3 loaf pans and made as directed. I used about 8 apples, but would try more next time just to increase theamount of fruit I can get into my family."
"1","4","YUM-O! No changes just goodness :)/"
"1","5","This was great. The only change I made was 1/4 cup water because I like a thicker sauce. Excellent!"
"1","5","I will be making this again! I used Cortland apples and it was delicious."
"1","5","This recipe was super easy & super delicious!! Thank you I will be making this again and again!"
"1","3","It was okay. For me, it didn't have much of a 'crisp' texture to it."
"1","5","Delicioso!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe..."
"1","5","I loved this recipe as did my company. I had some blueberries on hand, so I added them to half the pan. I did decrease the sugar however, by 1/2 cup. The topping is perfect."
"1","5","came out great, but i wouldn't follow another reviewer's advice to use a food processor to slice the apples again, or at least not if you have a cheap food processor like mine! the apples got sliced too thin, and i ended up with textured apple sauce with fantastic crumble topping...still, it is delicious and i will definitely make it again!"
"1","1","Im not a baker WHATSOEVER. but i gave this a try anyway. it turned out awesome I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee. Only thing i would've changed was the oats. Recipe calls for a cup when i make this again i will use a half of a cup. Will definitely make this gain."
"1","5","This is really superb. I am diabetic and I used Splenda instead of white sugar and Heart Smart instead of butter. Worked great and my husband asked when I was going to make it again. This is truly delicious, and with sugar free, low fat vanilla ice cream, nirvana."
"1","5","Great recipe. It's very easy. I do agree that you could cut the amount of sugar on the apples and leave out the water. It was really, really good though!"
"1","5","Great recipe! Only had Golden Delicious apples on hand, so I halved the sugar, added some nutmeg and omitted the water. I also cut in cold butter rather than melted and it turned out perfect!"
"1","5","I made using 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also doubled the topping. This could probably be made with less sugar. A little too sweet for me."
"1","5","Great recipe. Only used half the amount of sugar and water, as it seemed like a lot, and it was great...not too sweet or watery. Used granny smith apples, and they worked out well."
"1","5","Delicious! I mixed the sugar/cinnamon mixture with the apples instead of sprinkling on top. That way all the apples got covered. I also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mixture, and I omitted the water - not necessary. Per other reviews, I doubled the topping. This came out great!"
"1","5","I had some mixed types of apples that were too bruised to eat, yet too good to compost. I liked the ingredients in this recipes and thought it would be something my family would enjoy. I halved the recipe and it came out perfect! I sprinkled about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and used only 3/4 amount of the water it calls for. An excellent dessert that I will definitely be making again."
"1","5","yummy! didn't add water.served with ice cream-very sweet."
"1","5","I took this to a Halloween/Tailgate party and it was a huge hit! I used granny smith apples from a local Ohio farmer and they were delicious in this!"
"1","5","For the first time in my life I get a wonderful Apple Crisp, just like it should be! Thanks Diane!"
"1","5","This was excellent. Both my husband and I loved it. I did reduce the water to 1/8 cup based on other reviews of it being 'runny'. I have to say, using the 1/8 cup water made the perfect consitancy for my liking. I also used Spartan Apples."
"1","5","Yummy. I cut the white sugar in half as most people recommended but I think I would eliminate more sugar next time. The apples are sweet enough."
"1","4","Although still an excellent dessert I had problems with the recipie. I halfed the recipie to an 8 x 8 dish. I ended up with soup- does the type of apples make a difference? I used 75% crisp apples and 2 soft ones. I DID NOT half the topping recipe and still barely had enough to cover the 8 x 8 inch pan. Not sure, but I think I missed something. Will definitly still make this recipie again and try less or no water and different apples. I thought it was too sweet as well, but didn't rate the recipe on this since I think that is a matter of personal taste."
"1","5","Excellent!! Simple, delicious - all around fantastic!"
"1","5","Simply delishish! My family devoured it. I made it in an 8x8 pan so I halved the recipe except for the topping. It was a bit watery but my husband said it didn't hurt it at all. Next time I may skip the water all the way. I did toss the sugar and spices with the apples plus added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Also, I never melt the butter but cut it into the topping cold so it crumbles."
"1","5","amazing recipe! Will definitely make it again. A little too much butter, but otherwise it was fantastic! Also added a little nutmeg."
"1","5","Made this at work and it was gone in a flash. Too much sugar would reduce next time but sooo good."
"1","5","delish"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! Don't let your friends get a taste of this one. Mine are constantly requesting it now and I've lost track of the number of batches I've made. I usually throw a little cinnamon and nutmeg over the apples along with the sugar and put around 1/3 cup water in instead. I also triple the topping amount, but that's mostly because I eat a large portion of the topping before it ever makes it into the oven! :)"
"1","5","Very tasty - had it warm with vanilla ice cream on top and the kids ate it right out of the pan the next day"
"1","4","Overall nice texture, aroma & perfect crumb topping (though I used half the butter). This was, however, way too sweet/rich for us but it could have been my error. I even splashed lemon juice over my apples before adding the crumbs. Rhe only additions I made were (suggested by another reviewer): lemon juice, nutmeg & vanilla were added to the apples before sprinking on the first sugar mixture. Next time I make this I will definitely use a tart apple & cut the amount of sugar (& butter) by half. I'd like to add chopped pecans as one reviewer suggested, too. If you prefer really sweet desserts keep the recipe as-is, however if you want to taste the apples enhanced by some sweetened oatmeal-crumb topping, consider decreasing the amounts to your taste."
"1","5","Just like my dad used to make it! Used half the water and doubled the 'crisp'."
"1","5","Fantastic! This was my first time making apple crisp, and it came out fantastic. I read through the reviews before baking and decided to reduce the amount of water to 1/4 c as recommended, and also took someone's recommendation of cutting the butter into the oat/flour mixture instead of melting it. I served it hot with ice cream and everyone loved it! It is important to use granny smith apples, which I found out by asking the produce guy at my local supermarket. One additional thing: baking for 45 min at 350 degrees did not cut it--I had to turn the oven up to 375, cover with foil, and bake for an additional 30 minutes."
"1","5","It was delicious. Everyone loved it - Was gone within the first hour! ;)"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. I won't ever look for another. I'm sure it's delicious as is; however, I increased the topping. I multiplied it by 1.5 which still gave me plenty of sweet crunchy goodness.**Update** I have now made this three times and can't find a thing wrong to say about it. I've used different apples every time and found that when using non 'baking' apples, I don't need to cook it as long. My favorite amount of crust is still 1.5 times the original recipe. When I do this, I cut back on the butter some."
"1","5","this is AWESOME! i used Braeburn apples and only changed the amount of water i used. i think it ended up being about 1/4 of a cup instead of 1/2. also only baked it for 40 minutes. goes perfect with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream. DELICIOUS!"
"1","4","Very good recipe, but I had to make changes. I did a mixture of Granny Smith & Pink Lady apples (which I tossed with 1/8-1/4 cup of OJ) and instead of the full cup of white sugar I did a mix of white & brown sugar. Also added some nutmeg to the cinnamon. Also, instead of 1/2 cup of water I did water & apple juice. Doubled the topping recipe and enjoy with some vanilla ice cream- perfect fall dessert!"
"1","5","This was absolutely delicious!!!! I eliminated the water, because I like a thicker consistency in my apple crisp. I also did as another reviewer suggested, and tossed the apples in the flour/sugar mixture, and then layered them in the pan. It was perfect! It would make a great deep dish apple pie as well!!"
"1","5","Best Apple Crisp I Have ever had. The whole family enjoyed it!"
"1","3","Maybe after some tweaking this might be ok. I used half the water suggested by other reviews...wish I wouldn't have used any at all. It was very runny and the apples still weren't done after cooking it an extra 20 min."
"1","5","I'm not AT ALL good at baking or preparing anything.. and of course i decided to do this for my boyfriend's birthday! SUCCESS : all his family loved it ! very easy : as other people said> double the quantities for the topping and leave it in the oven for a good hour."
"1","4","Would give it 5 stars except it was too sweet for our liking. Even my 19yr old daughter thought so. I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 in both the filling and topping. Maybe even 1/2 a cup in the filling depending on the type of apple used. I did use the water and it worked out just fine."
"1","5","This is now my new favorite apple crisp recipe."
"1","4","Good recipe. I followed other reviewer's advice, and tossed the apples with the cinnamon sugar, and didn't add any water. While it was baking the moisture came out of the apples and made its own liquid. I doubled the crust because I LOVE the crisp part, and it worked great. I also didn't melt the butter, but cut it in to the mixture so it'd be more like a crisp and not just a crust. DEFINITELY use Granny Smith apples, the tartness is perfect! With the couple changes I made, this was a wonderful dessert!"
"1","5","Very good, will make it again. Perfect for after going apple picking."
"1","4","Very good recipe! I was looking for a recipe with a crunchy topping. When I pulled it out of the oven, I thought the topping wouldn't be very crunchy, but it was perfect. A little on the sweet side, but with ice cream it was great! I made it just as the recipe was written except I folded the butter in."
"1","5","I thought this was the best apple crisp ever. I used 12 cups of apples and doubled the topping. Added just a bit more sugar, flour and cinnamon on the apples. Didn't have any problem with the water. If you let the crisp set up a bit the sauce will thicken. Yummy!!"
"1","4","Overall, a good recipe. I will definitely cut the water in half next time. It was too runny. And I will toss the apples with the sugar mixture before baking. Some apples were a little sweet and others were too tart because they weren't covered evenly by sprinkling. I saw other people doubled the crust. That would be good, but I'm not sure it's necessary."
"1","5","I love this recipe. I have been looking for an apple crisp recipe for a long time. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used less sugar and water. It turned out great. The topping was nice and crunchy. I also used half whole wheat and white flour."
"1","5","This is sooooo good. I did as some other reviewers recommended and doubled the oat mixture, and I would not recommend doing that. It just made it dryer than I was expecting (even then it was really good though). I served it over homemade cinnamon ice cream, which remedied the dryness. Would also be really good with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! I did double the topping and left out the water as was suggested by others. I have gotten rave reviews!"
"1","4","The topping was spot on! We thought the apples were a bit sweet, and will use less suger next time we make it. Other than that, it would have easily been a five star classic. Great Dish!"
"1","5","Oh wow is this good!!! I used the red and delicious apples off the tree in our yard and it turned out great! My boyfriend is used to home town cooking and I don't usually cook things from scratch. i followed the directions, it was super easy, and I was told it was better than any apple crisp he's ever had. now THAT is achievement!"
"1","5","This was the best recipe I've ever tasted! I used 1/4 cup of apple juice in place of the water, and I put the water in the pan first. Also, next time I think I will use less sugar because even with the granny smith apples, it was super sweet! I also doubled the topping recipe and added a pinch of nutmeg to both the apples and the topping. I also added some cooking time because 45 min. wasn't long enough for my oven. I served it with Vanilla ice cream and Caramel topping. It was a hit!"
"1","5","This is a very good recipe. i will deffinitly use the one alot more. I srongly recommend for people to try this one"
"1","5","If you are looking for a classic apple crisp, you've found it! The apples will be tender with a lovely rich sauce. While the surface is crispy and full of flavor. Together they make a marvelous mixture. A Delight to the senses!"
"1","5","This is a very good recipe. I did chop the apples smaller the 2nd time. The sliced apples seemed to be a little more crunchy than what we like."
"1","5","I followed other suggestions. Decreased water by half and I thought it was perfect. I doubled the crust/streusel and actually thought it was too much. I'd rather have more apples in my apple crisp."
"1","5","I tossed the apples in the sugar and cinnamon mix, along with a bit of fresh nutmeg. Then I added them to the 9x13 pan that I'd already added the 1/2 cup water to. After all, why bother rinsing the seasoning off by pouring the water over top? Turned out fantastic, and I know I'll be making it again soon."
"1","4","I thought this tasted pretty good. I halved the white sugar because I'm trying to cut back. The topping was a little drier than I'm used to but all in all it tasted good. Next time I'll omit the baking powder and baking soda because I didn't like the fact that the topping rose during cooking."
"1","5","OMG!! I think this is the best Apple Crisp I've ever had. I did squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over the apples and tossed before putting into pan and I added just a few shakes of cinnamon into the crisp part! Yum. I would suggest slicing the apples a little more on the thicker side, I sliced them thin and they were a little mushy, so go thick!"
"1","5","I made this for a church function and everyone loved it. I did cut back on the sugar and water over the apples because I had relatively sweet apples. Very good basic apple crisp will continue to make. Also a good recipe to use if you have an abundance of apples."
"1","5","This is probably the one recipe that I make the most on this site. I just love it. As others, I did double the topping and cut the water in half and it was perfecto. Now it's peach season and I'm making this same recipe using, yes peaches. Very yummy!"
"1","5","i've been searching for the apple crisp that i remember my mom making, and finally i found it! i did make a few modifications, i halved the amount of apples, sugar, flour & cinnamon and added allspice. i tossed the apples in this mixture and then put them in an 8x8 pan. i sprinkled with lime juice (out of lemon) and omitted the water. i made the crust per the directions and it came out amazing. i brought this to a party and it was gone in 2 minutes! i am definitely keeping this one, and getting rid of the other apple crisp recipes i saved. sooooo good!"
"1","5","Incredible!"
"1","4","Very good...but was skeptical about the water...I always add lemon juice to my fruit pies...so i did that and only added some drizzles of apple juice. Did not have enough apples, so i used 2 containers of red raspberries. Would double the amount of crust....we love it!"
"1","5","Wonderful - easy - yummy!!!"
"1","4","This was good, but not the best apple crumble/crisp I've had. I think I'll stick to the other recipes. Next time I will replace some of the white sugar with brown, add a bit more cinnamon and sprinkle some nuts."
"1","5","Winner, winner...this is what my family wants after dinner!!! I followed the directions and this was superb! The only 'extra' I added was some raisins, because that's what my mister wanted! It was SOOOOO good! This may very well turn into my 'go to' dessert."
"1","5","My family thought this was absolutely wonderful. I halved the filling part of the since there are just 3 at my house but kept the full amount of topping as others suggested and baked in an 8x8 pan. I used gala apples. Galas, fuji and granny smith are my favorites to cook with."
"1","5","Delicious! I made this and served warm with caramel sauce and home made vanilla ice cream this past week and served last fall as well. Definately recommend you try it!"
"1","5","I've tried a bunch of Crisp recipes and this is one of the best! Not too sweet and the oats give it a great crunch. Highly recommend."
"1","5","AMAZING! Best I have ever had and super easy to make!"
"1","4","I used four different varieties of apples. In the end, there was a little more 'juice' at the bottom than I would have liked. So next time, I will add less water. Even with the juice, it was delicious."
"1","5","Delicious and easy. Like others, I cut down on the white sugar (I prefer things less sweet)."
"1","4","this was really good and simple to make. the great thing about it is that all the ingredients are things you would usually always have at home so you can throw it together for a quick dessert. next time i will be sure to serve it with either vanilla ice cream or whip cream on top. its still good without it, but im sure it will taste fantastic with that addition. i will also try adding some nutmeg next time. i didnt use a full 10 cups of apples, as i only had 7 apples at home"
"1","5","Great recipes"
"1","5","Very yummy. I did not put the 1/2 cup water in the filling though. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmet and 2 tbsp flour to the filling."
"1","4","Delicious!!! Everyone loved it. Though for my family & friends, we found that 1 c. sugar total (so 1/2 c. white & 1/2 c. brown sugar) was just the right amount. When I made the recipe the first time, I followed the recipe exactly & it was way too sweet."
"1","5","This is the first time I've made a crisp and I was very happy with the result. After reading several reviews suggesting doubling the topping, I adjusted accordingly. I used Braeburn apples and regular oats (not quick-cooking) and it turned out great. There was a little runny liquid at the bottom, but I think it will just depend on the type of apples... some are just more juicy. Delicious recipe, thanks!"
"1","5","AWESOME AS IS! Used cortland apples and added a bit of nutmeg."
"1","5","I loved this one, although I did make a few changes. With the filling I used only 1/2 the sugar and I doubled the cinamon (I love cin). I omitted the water and instead put this into two pie shells. I then used the topping as my top crust. Came out delicious and I will definately make again."
"1","5","Delicious!!! Next time I will use different apples (I used gala I think) b/c they just didn't get as soft as I wanted. The topping is yum!!"
"1","5","I have to say that this is better than my moms apple crisp. I hade a 9X9 pan and it was gone within 2 days. My bf and I couldnt stop nibbling on it!!"
"1","5","This was a HUGE hit with my family. Made it as is with no changes. Served with Bryer's vanilla ice cream! Thanks for the deliciousness!"
"1","3","halved the apple mixture, kept the water in, will continue to look for another recipe. The crisp topping seemed too sweet. I couldn't even eat one helping. I have liked crisps in the past; this one wasn't what I was looking for."
"1","5","Very good. Made six servings as to 12. Very, very crunchy topping! Yummy!"
"1","5","So I monkeyed with the ingredient amounts a bit to suit the preferences of my family, but the basic 'bones' of this recips are perfect the way they are. I double the topping and put everything in a big 9x13 casserole dish. Try this... play with the amounts. You will love it too!"
"1","5","Great recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious! I only did a half recipe and used less sugar then what was called for since I used Braeburn apples. It turned out great! Will definitely make it again. Tastes so good warm out of the oven!"
"1","5","this is the best apple crisp ever! i make it all the time and everyone loves it. I have made some small changes. instead of 1/2 cup water i put 1/2 cup lemon juice (real lemons when i can) it doesnt make the apple crisp sour, it makes the apple a little less sweet. The other thing is that this recipe has alot of sugar. So if u have kids and u want to minimize the sugar buzz, this recipes still tastes great if u half both the white sugar and brown sugar! Enjoy!"
"1","4","Excellent recipe. I used apples I picked from our Goodland Apple tree in fall and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg as some previous commebnts had mentioned. I also reduced the water to 1/3 c due to the apples being quite juicy. Tasted great. My wife said it was the best apple crisp she has tasted. Definitely will be making it again next fall."
"1","5","This turned out fantastic with a few adjustments. I used 1/2 the sugar suggested, used maple and brown sugar instant oat packages (2) single serve packages, added a little all spice, doubled the cinnamon and used 1/2 the water. By the way, the 2nd time I made this I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda and you could not tell the difference. Great recipe."
"1","5","This was very good. I added a dash of nutmeg. I also cut in the butter with a pastry blender, instead of pouring melted on top. I then pressed it evenly across the top to make a pretty presentation. Great filling to crisp ratio."
"1","5","I made this last night. I changed the serving size to 4 and I substituted the sugar with splenda and the brown sugar with brown splenda, it was very delicious. Thank you."
"1","2","This is not a good recipe! The measurements are wrong, I wasted 8 apples making this overly sweet syrupy mess. There should be no water, the apples have thier own moisture. Have you ever put water in an apple pie? And the topping is only not nearly enough."
"1","5","Delicious!!! Loved it just as is."
"1","4","I doubled the oat mixture and put half above and below the apples. Next time I will halve the water and also cut down the white/brown sugar by 1/4"
"1","5","So EASY to make and delicious! Way to utilize extra apples!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe as is and it is fantastic. Next time I will have to cut my apples a bit chunkier because they turned out a little too soft. If you like your apples with some texture make sure not to slice them too small. Use granny smith apples because the sour apple goes great with all the sugar and spice."
"1","5","Really good; but great with vanilla ice cream & caramel syrup!"
"1","5","SO good! DOUBLE THE CRUMBS--otherwise there are not enough. I prefer to use Granny Smith because I like it more tart and I also add a bit less sugar to the apples."
"1","5","This turned out perfectly the first time. We'll be making this over and over. Just make sure to use the right kind of apples, so they don't turn mushy! (Although it would still taste good.)"
"1","4","I can only give this recipe 4 stars as written, but with my slight changes it's easily a 5 star recipe. I added a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples, instead of water, I used 1-2 TBSP. of vanilla. I doubled the topping adding more cinnamon, nutmeg, and chopped pecans. Baked as directed. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!"
"1","5","Used granny smiths and did the double batch of crust... too much. 1.5 is probably good."
"1","5","One of my favorite recipes! Best apple crisp ever, makes TONS of the crisp which is my favorite part. Now if I could just find someone to peel and slice all those apples for me..."
"1","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and it was sooo good. Took the advice of others and double the topping and am so glad I did. I only used half of the amount of water poured over the apples and it was perfect. I think I used fiji apples, not the granny smith ones, but I just sliced them a bit thicker and it was fine. Also added some nutmeg along with the cin."
"1","5","Yum, so good! I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan. I cut back on the sugar a little bit because my apples were sweet already. I thought the amount of water might be too much, it seemed very liquidy, but the water absorped while the crisp cooled. Thanks so much, I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","This apple crisp is awesome. Only change I made is that I added some caramel topping prior to adding the crumble topping. It was a little watery, so I will probably use 1/2 the water next time. Still...its amazing!"
"1","4","This apple crisp recipe is great! My husband loves it and ate half the pan within the first two days! He was fine with it until he realized how much butter was in it. Apples do matter, as others have said. Use a crispy apple, such as a Granny Smith or Jonathan. I used Macintosh because we had a whole bag to get rid of and the apples turned to mush in some places, but it still tasted good! I also doubled the topping recipe, which did not really need to be done. Making a 1.5 serving size would have been just fine. We think the topping is the best part, so the more the better! Overall, a great recipe. Very flavorful, not too sweet, and definitely a guilty pleasure! I will definitely make this again! Delicious!"
"1","4","I found this to be much too sweet. I will use tarter apples and cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup (or use a mix of apples as I did this time and just omit the white sugar.) The topping is sweet enough without adding more sugar to the apples. I also added just a sprinkle of nutmeg to the apples."
"1","5","The apple crisp topping is perfect and I didn't change a thing there. I did alter the apple filling by using half the sugar listed and instead of the water, I used 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. Also, instead of one big 9x13 pan, I used individual 3oz ramekins. About 1 1/2 sliced apples fit per ramekin and the topping amount made can be used for about 4-6 ramekins depending on how thickn you prefer your crisp topping."
"1","4","This is a very tasty recipe."
"1","5","Delicious!! Followed some others recommendations and doubled the topping!! Will definately make again. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Another Great hit. My family love it."
"1","5","This is a delicious recipe as is, but I tweaked it a bit and was very pleased with the results--as are all the people who've tried it. I used 6 Granny Smith apples, doubled the amount of cinnamon and added a scant teaspoon of ground cloves, then tossed the apples with the sugar-spice mixture. I divided the apples between 2 smaller baking dishes, used 1/4 cup water in each--which I found was a perfect amount once the dishes had cooled to room temp. I doubled the recipe for the crumble and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix. I'd planned to cut in the butter, but in my rush to soften the butter, I had half melted and half softened, so I cut in the softened chunks. Very nice results!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe. I was looking for the old-fashioned crisp like mom makes and this is it! I've made it twice now; the first time exactly as the recipe's writtten, and the second time I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats, (btw, both times I used regular oats-quick cooking wasn't necessary). Anyway, I got absolutely rave reviews from my co-workers both times. I plan on making this for Thanksgiving.   I've since made this several times. I've used quick cooking as well as regular oats. I like the texture of the crumble with the regular oats much better. Also, I've found that adding the melted butter a little at a time, and stirring intermittedly helps the butter to more evenly dispense. I can't tell you the raves I get over this."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! Easy to do and tastes fabulous! I had quite a few apples so I doubled the recipe and added 15 mins to the cooking time. Just as easy to do! I highly recommend this one!"
"1","5","I used McIntosh, absolutely delicious!!"
"1","5","The best apple crisp EVER. I mixed the cinnamon mixture up with the apples, rather than sprinkle on. And I didn't add the water. I let it sit for awhile before baking, so there was plenty of water in there already. Again, best crisp EVER."
"1","5","Very Good. I used Cortland apples, which are very white and have a perfect texture when baked. I also made extra topping, as I like alot of crunch. It was very well received!"
"1","4","Good. used 1/2 the sugar called for and it was plenty sweet."
"1","4","Delicious and easy to make, however you definitely need to omit the water, or at least cut it in half. I followed the directions exactly and the apples were swimming in water when I took it out of the oven. I would cut the white sugar in half as well."
"1","5","Very,very good. I made this for a group of mom's in a prenatal class and they raved about it. Thanks for an excellent recipe."
"1","4","My family loved this recipe, however, following nother reviewers advice, I cut down on the water and it turned out just a little dry."
"1","5","This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and I could not stop eating it."
"1","5","Yummy! I have made this about 6 times in the last month in a variety of sizes. I always use much more oatmeal than flour, usually double. I have used whole wheat flour which was probably the best. I love the crumble so the more the better! Thank you for this quick, simple, yummy, no fuss recipe! I usually end up using 5 fugi, 5 granny smith apples. If you decide to make more crumble, you need the brown sugar and butter to help. I made it once (on accident) with out the water and I definitely noticed. It needs that little bit of water."
"1","5","YUMMY! I just made this for the second time in two weeks. It's really great. And YES - use Granny Smith's and not a sweet apple. (Although I threw in a couple of Honey Crisp because I had them on hand.) I eased up on the sugar just a bit because it can be very sweet - but oh wow - it is so, so good. Not alot of work for an excellent ending. YUM!"
"1","5","Very good recipe and easy to put together. I halved it for just my husband and I and put it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out great. And I'm already making the full size recipe this weekend for a party. Next time I'm going to double the crisp topping and add a pinch of nutmeg and salt into the mix. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","I made lots of changes but it was great! I used Macintosh apples. In the apple mixture I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup, I used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch instead of flour. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. For the topping, I doubled it and added 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans. I ground the oatmeal in a food processor (because my husband doesn't like the texture), added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I baked it for 55 minutes and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to additionally crisp the top. It's wonderful!! Thanks for a terrific recipe."
"1","5","Oh my word!!! This Apple Crisp was amazing! I couldn't stop eating it! Sooo tasty. I used about 2 cups more apples then called for only because I had them on hand and needed to use them up. But it worked out great. And I also would reduce the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup or even a little bit less. I'm not a fan of overly sweet things, so I cut the sugar down on most recipes. But this is definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","this one is GREAT! I have made it a couple of times and I always go home with a empty tray. It's simple, easy, and very tasty."
"1","5","This was THE BEST apple crisp I've ever had. It was actually cripsy. I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers. It was good, but I guess it depends on how much you want to taste the fruit. I may add another apple or two next time to achieve the fruit/topping balance that's right for me. Next time I'd like to try adding pecans to the topping (left them out because the group I was feeding has nut allergies). I also used regular oats not quick cooking because that's what I always have in my pantry. Maybe that's why it was extra crunchy, but that's how I wanted it to be. And I cut in the butter rather than melting it just because that's how I always make a crumb topping. As far as the apples go... I think adding water depends on the type of apples you use. I used Winesap which are very sturdy apples, good for cooking, but in my past experience with them they don't cook down quickly or get very juicy upon cooking. So I added the full 1/2 cup of water & it was perfect. Another apple may cook down more, make lots of it's own juice, and not need the additional water. This recipe going in my recipe book!"
"1","5","Very good! I make apple crisp a lot and always loved my own recipe - but this one is even better!!"
"1","5","Delicious! I had my boyfriend's mom ask me for the recipe, prefacing that her son told her it was better than her apple pie! :)"
"1","5","I followed this recipe as instructed and it was absolutely delicious.. The topping was crispy even after refrigerating and re-heating. Highest of recommendations."
"1","5","You probably don't need one more review, but I wanted to add that I made this for some vegan friends, using vegan margarine, and it was still WONDERFUL. My preference is to use butter, but it does make a good vegan dessert."
"1","5","So good. I didn't think it needed quite DOUBLE the topping...but if you're not afraid of lots of extra sugar & butter...go for it. I also added chopped walnuts and nutmeg to the recipe - VERY GOOD!! Next time I think I'll try to make it a little healthier, a little leess sugar & butter and see how it turns out."
"1","4","The BEST!!!! My very picky fiance raves about this recipe! I was SO UPSET when I lost my print-out of this recipe - I cannot find another one that tops this! Like some of the other reviewers I double the topping, use about 3/4 of the amount of sugar the recipe calles for, and I do not add any water - I usually use macintosh and cortland apples and they produce plenty of juice!"
"1","5","I used this recipe with peaches, and it was absolutely delicious! Easy too!"
"1","5","Very easy to make. We doubled the topping and my family went crazy for it. Yummmmmmy!!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely teh best Apple Crisp I have ever made!!! Teh recipe was quick and easy. Like others, I omitted the water complete. I also used macs and courtlands instead of Granny Smiths so I used only half the sugar. I made half again on the crisp, but the regular amount probably would have been plenty as I do not put it on the bottom. Great recipe! Will definately make it again!!!"
"1","4","I used five apples, skipped the water, added 1/4t. nutmeg, and made the topping for 12 servings (full recipe). This turned out great! My husband usually doesn't like apple desserts, but he loved this one!"
"1","5","Excellent receipt. Loved by all. Will definitely make again. Receipt easy to follow, made a couple adjustments as follows: 1/4 cup of water, soaked the cut and peeled apples in lemon water. Also, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and I added some 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to that mixture."
"1","4","Thanks so much for this recipe! I should have a picture of it soon..."
"1","4","Great Recipe! Wayyyy tooo much sugar, I will make again just half of the sugar."
"1","5","I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I love it so much that I will be making it again for Thanksgiving. This is a great recipe for a non-cook- it's easy and fast. The hardest part is peeling and coring the apples. I did not have an issue with the water at all, if anything I think I might have added MORE water, not less. My local paper published an apple crisp recipe from a famous restaurant (so famous that I can't think of the name of it!) that was much, much more complicated than this one, and I got mediocre results from it. If you make one Apple Crisp recipe MAKE THIS ONE!"
"1","5","Shame on me for only making a half recipe! I could have eaten an entire 13x9 of this! I always pay attention to the reviews so, like many others, I cut back on the water, added a dash of nutmeg to the apples, and (what the heck) doubled the topping. I've always thought of crisps and cobblers as humble weeknight desserts...but I'd be proud to serve this one to company. I'm sure it would do just as beautifully with other fruits, too. This is THE recipe for apple crisp!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! This was the first time I've made apple crisp and I love it. I don't know if I'll be able to eat anyone else's. I did add just 1/2 cup more of the cooking oats to the mixture for the top (the crunchy top is my favorite)."
"1","5","This was a hit at a party. I did not add the water to the apples, but my apples had been sliced and frozen for 2 pies and were already plenty wet. I also did not melt the butter, but cut it into the topping mixture. I like a more crumbly topping. Once finished, I felt the topping needed a pinch of salt as well so I will add that the next time."
"1","5","Delicious. Only cut the water out and made as is otherwise. Everyone loved it."
"1","5","This recipe is amazing-although I tweaked it a bit. I used 5 large granny smith apples and coated them with the sugar mix instead of layering. (10 cups seemed like a LOT) I used apple cider instead of water for extra flavor. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! Serve it with vanilla ice cream and caramel topping for an extra kick. (and calories :) But well worth it!"
"1","5","Very good & super easy to make! Next time I may reduce the amount of water, it was a little runny. I used Granny Smith Apples and they added just the right tartness to balance out the sweet of the topping."
"1","5","Amazing! This was the best apple crisp I have ever had! I made half of the recipe and I am glad I did b/c I can't stop going back for more. I could probably eat the entire pan! Used Jonathan apples from the orchard and made as directed. It was a little watery right out of the oven, but thickened up. This is a keeper!"
"1","5","This was very good! I accidently used white sugar in the crumble and it still turned out delicious! Also, I cut the ingredients in half and used an 8x8...came out perfect!"
"1","5","Absolutely the BEST apple crisp I've ever made or eaten! I made the recipe exactly as written, but added a little cinnamon to the topping portion. I used gala apples and it turned out GREAT! I will be making this simple and delicious dessert often! Thanks for posting. :)"
"1","5","OHHHHH GOODNESS!!!! I ate this for dinner. I picked apples fromy my tree, then baked this.. as I baked this I made dinner-- I didn't eat anything BUT THIS for dinner! YUM!!! It's definitely the best! not too overpowering with the cinnamon, either! =-) I also doubled the topping, and added nutmeg! I DID use the water.. but it was PERFECT! I think it would have been too dry if I hadn't added the water. I didn't have vanilla icecream on hand, so we will have it with that tomorrow =-) My son is on his 2nd bowl, and I- well, just ate it out of the pan =-)"
"1","5","Way yummy."
"1","5","This was WONDERFUL! Made a few small changes. I only used 1/4c water and added 1/4 tsp of Pumpkin pie spice & 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Will make again and again!"
"1","5","Very easy to make and DELICIOUS to eat. I made this for my hubby and kids.. they all Loved it ! I did however add a pinch of nutmeg...and it came out perfect!"
"1","5","Made this last night for some company who LOVE apple crisp..Did not add water and added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. It came out sooo good! My friend even said what did you do different (used differend recipe before) this is to die for! Will be using this one from now on!"
"1","5","Really good! I used a mix of Red Delicious, Granny Smith, and Gala apples (3, 3, and 1, for a total of 7 apples to make around 10 cups). I used half white and half whole wheat flour; and I cut the sugar in the recipe in half (altogether, halved it for each layer). The butter I used was a 50/50 blend of real butter/olive oil Heart Smart spread...unusual for me as I generally only use real butter in cooking, but this worked out fine (melts much faster in the microwave than real butter!). The end result is for sure the best of about 4 'crisp' recipes I've tried on here thus far! Juicy, tender, sweet, delicious, the crust is probably my favorite part--it holds together well, probably from having a higher ratio of flour:oats than other recipes have called for. I don't know if I will quit trying other recipes now, but this will certainly be my go-to recipe :) Thanks so much, it's worth every star!"
"1","5","This was SOOOO yummy! This is now my staple apple crisp recipe!"
"1","5","Yum, Yum, Yum!! I made this with some Braeburn apples I had that didn't taste really great fresh, but they made an awesome crisp! I also added a bag of frozen blueberries and made a recipe and a half of the crisp. I seriously could not keep my husband and son away from it!"
"1","5","I never liked apple crisp much, but my husband wanted some--tried this recipe and I love it! Don't use the water, but add a little more sugar to the apples."
"1","4","I put it in an 8x8 pan instead.I used half for top and half for bottom crust. I cut up my apples and put them in a bowl with the sugar and some lemon juice. I let it sit for 10-15 minutes and the apples make their own juice. I did that instead of adding the water. I used Honey Crisp apples so I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and a 1/4 cup brown. Definitely a repeat."
"1","5","The BEST! Its sweet,yummy and crunchy! Very good. Its the best I have ever had. STOP Here if your looking for a great apple crisp recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome! Loved the crumbly top, and it stayed that way. I did double the topping though per other reviews and forgot to add the water to the apples, but I don't think I would change that in the future. I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","This is really good. Just as good as the boxed kind I use when I'm being lazy. It has a good crunch. The topping needed a dash of spice though, so I added a dash of clove, a dash of salt and a healthy sprinkling of cinnamon. I thought a cup of sugar on the apples was too much, but I was wrong. I also didn't add all the water, I just added a little. I can see where it would be needed as mine was kinda dry since I added the flour. Thanks for the recipe Diane, now I don't have to spend my money on the boxed mix."
"1","5","Great recipe for an apple crisp with a little hearty feel. The topping is so delicious! I made this for a friends wedding rehearsal dinner and both pans were gone in a snap. Served hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream is the perfect combo. No changes made to the recipe."
"1","5","This is awesome! I made it for a big Sunday dinner with my family and my picky father loved it. None left and I only pulled it out of the oven 2 hours ago. Changed nothing, served with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Excellent!!!!! Make this all the time!"
"1","5","Do NOT double the topping - the recipe makes plenty. I did not add water, as my apples had plenty of juice after slicing. Very yummy!"
"1","4","This was a good apple crisp. I listened to a few of the reviews that said to double the topping and I shouldn't have. It was way to sweet with double topping. Next time I would leave it alone and make it as stated in the original recipe...I did not add any water though and it came out fine, not dry at all."
"1","5","Great recipe. I like to make a half batch for our family of 4."
"1","5","I had 3-4 cups of huckleberries that I wanted to add to an apple cobbler. (Had heard that this was a good combination). This recipe looked like it might work for that. It turned out to be very good! Used about 8 cups of apples, cooked them separately with the flour and sugar in the oven about 30 minutes at 350 first, (Used no water) then sprinkled the huckleberries on top, then the topping and baked about 35 minutes longer. It turned out great. Next time huckleberry cobbler is the goal, probably would use more huckleberries and fewer apples, though, as the apple flavor dominated. I made 1 1/2 x the topping recipe, as some had suggested increasing it, but ended up not using the extra 1/2, as it was too much. A very good recipe."
"1","5","Easy and so good! This was my first apple crisp recipe and it will probably be my last (and only)...I don't think I'll find one to top it!"
"1","4","Tasty crisp, but I was hoping for more of a 'crisp' texture for the topping. Overall, nice taste, everyone seemed to like it."
"1","4","Very Tasty! I took the advice of others, doubled the topping and made a crust below with it. Love that idea (and the added texture). I forgot to put in the water (oops) and it came out a bit dry (due to the added crust I'm sure -- my bad). Also added the nutmeg as others had recommended. Very tasty and loved by all at our house. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Very good..I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","5","I doubled the topping and it was perfect!"
"1","3","I didn't read enough reviews - and when I went back, they were right. Leave out the water. Mine came out very runny. I also find it very, It was also way to sweet for me. I don't think I have ever said that before! Seriously though - I would cut the sugar in the first part by at least half. My husband and kids gobbled it up though...."
"1","5","I never liked Apple Crisp until I tried this recipe. Fantastic! Very quick and easy. Extra yummy over vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Absolutely incredible! Served it as the crown of a southern Sunday dinner and caught them with spoons scraping out the pan in the kitchen!!"
"1","5","all i can say is superb!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","This turned out really good. I tried to double the crisp part of it, which I doubled the water that went into it, too, and I shouldn't have done that. It had a wonderful flavor, though and we loved it!"
"1","5","i just made this last night and it's already gone! i didn't alter the recipe at all and i think it was perfect. you have to remember that this is basically like an apple pie, it will come out a bit 'soupy' right out of the oven but after sitting it will be perfect! also, i used granny smith apples."
"1","5","I brought this to a meeting and everyone really enjoyed it. I reduced the water by half and doubled the topping. I used granny smith apples (about eight of them) since many past reviewers recommended that variety and I was happy with the results...plus, the granny smith apples were the cheapest!"
"1","5","the only change i made to the recipe is i added 1T. of cooking tapioca other than that i was wonderful recipe very very good will keep in my favorite pile thank you for sharing recipe"
"1","5","Even I was able to make a successful crisp, and my family and I love it. I also doubled the topping (used another 1/4cup applesauce instead of butter) and cut the white sugar in half (still a little sweet for me). I think I'll try more cinammon next time. Delicious either way."
"1","5","Yummy! I have use both sweet and tangy apples in this recipe and I love it both ways. I found the topping was plenty unlike some other reviews, but I guess everyone is different in their tastes. Excellent recipe!"
"1","4","Made this recipe twice and was pleased with the results. The first time came out too watery and not as flavorful as I like. The second time I used half the water and added a pinch of salt and some crushed pecans to the topping and it came out better."
"1","5","KILLER!!! I bring this to every event and people BEG for this recipe....absolutely love it!!"
"1","5","Great tasting crisp! After reading the reviews, I modified it just a little bit. I tossed my apples with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon, but I also added a dash of nutmeg. I did not use any water, and it was perfect. I also used a stick of smart balance 50/50 blend and cut it into the topping mixture."
"1","5","YUMMY!!! Thats all I can say! I've never made homemade apple crisp, normally I buy premade crumb topping & just cut up the apples & add the topping. I had some leftover apples & decided to try this. I took another reviewiers advice & only added 1/4 cup of water, rather than the 1/2 cup. It seemed like too much water & I don't like a soggy apple crisp, but didn't completley omit the water as some reviewers did because I do like a little bit of a thick sauce. It was delicious...very yummy!! Thanks for the great recipe!! This was soo good & soo easy I will never buy boxed topping again!!!"
"1","5","My boyfriend doesn't usually like my apple crisp loved this one. We had it for breakfast the next day also. I might add a little lemon to the apples next time."
"1","5","This is really great and I have to say that by mistake I probably made it even better! LOL I didn't have any quick cook oats so I used two individual serving size maple and brown sugar packets which exactly equalled one cup! The topping with this addition was out of this world! I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup to compensate for this addition since I was afraid of it being way too sweet, but it was delicious! Thanks for this perfect recipe :) FYI: I also mixed the white sugar, flour and cinnamon together then tossed the apples in this mixture to ensure even coating instead of sprinkling it over the top."
"1","5","The perfect apple crisp. This recipe is easy to make, no fuss, and turns out delicious every time. I have made it for guests many times, and always get compliments. As others have suggested, I omit, completely, the water, and add 1/4 t fresh ground nutmeg."
"1","5","Fabulous! My husband and I loved this recipe and will be making it again soon. We doubled the topping (per suggestions from other reviewers) and it was perfect."
"1","4","This recipe was VERY good! My family loved it and my step son said it was good eat'n! I followed the recipe exactly the way it called, however I did add carmel to the apples before I put the oats mixture on it."
"1","3","Not to bad, but I did not follow the other reviewers advice. Definitely cut water, mine has a lot of water in the bottom of the pan. I used jonathon and granny smith, they rendered a lot of juices and the water was just overkill. I would also cut sugar if you like the apple taste of apple crisp. It is VERY sweet. Third, I added a lot more cinnamon and it turned out to be a good idea but if i cut the sugar i prbably would not need more. Will definitely try again with the tweeks."
"1","5","This recipe has the perfect seasoning. I do double the topping because that is my family's favorite part."
"1","5","I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because i'm sure if it is made as written it would be worth 5 stars. That being said, let me tell you what i did different from the recipe, so you'll know what NOT to do. Do not cut the butter into the dry ingredients. It will be very dry if not melted. Do not double the crisp and put some on the bottom. It is just not apple crisp that way, and do not leave out the water completely. It's in the recipe for a reason. It needs some extra moisture. I will make again and will make as written and i'm sure it will be great."
"1","5","I made this recipe tonight for my fiance and her son and wow it is the best desert I have ever tasted. I would recomend this to anyone who wants to wow some guests."
"1","5","Made this for dessert for Christmas everyone loved it. Never had apple crisp till i made this and now i love it cant wait to make it again. So simple and easy"
"1","4","I thought this was a little too sweet. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar but it was still too sweet. I would do 1/2 a cup of sugar and double the cinnamon. That being said, everyone else loved it. I am always particularly hard on my own cooking I guess!"
"1","4","Very good, but I made a few changes the 2nd time I baked it. Mix all ingredients as directed FIRST and cover them. Then, core, peel and slice the apples to prevent them from turning brown. Definately double the oat mixture as many other reviewers recommend. Finally, bake in a metal pan and cover...this ensures a more even bake. The first time I ended up with apple sauce on the edges and raw apples in the center. This recipe is a 5 star with these adjustments!"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful! I omitted the water and drizzled 2 T. of caramel ice cream topping over the apples before adding the crumb topping. Baked as directed and served with vanilla ice cream. Yum!"
"1","4","The topping was very good... next time I won't add any water as it was too 'soupy'. I served it warm with cinnamon ice cream after a dinner of spicy chili.... a great ending to a gret meal!"
"1","5","Very good! I listened to the reviews and used 1/4 a cup of water instead of 1/2 a cup and I used about 1/2 a cup of sugar instad of 1 cup....I also doubled the crisp on top so it would be extra crispy...it worked!The top was very crispy and the bottom was very moist...I loved it!!! I will definently use this recipe again."
"1","5","Great, simple recipe....the way an apple crisp should be! I actually made this for my freezer. I prepared the filling (with a little bit of added lemon juice) and put it into ziploc bags...froze them flat. Then when I need a quick, easy dessert I just thaw, pour into my casserole dish, prepare and add the topping! Voila! (hint...I also do this with my apple pie fillings too...freezing this way saves space instead of having to freeze whole pies)"
"1","5","This recipe is really really good even if you've never baked before. Just follow the instructions. I reduced teh water to 1/4 cup. Since my kids cant stand the smell of cinnamon, instead of sprinkling cinnamon powder , i actually just chuck in one whole cinnamon stick with the apples just to very lightly scent the apples. I used red delicious apples.Yumm, as of today this is my husband's favourite dessert! DELICIOUS."
"1","5","This apple crisp is awesome. The first time I made it, it was a hit. I have had constant requests for it ever since. My housemates have actually banned me from making sweets because they eat everything up in one sitting. Hey its not my fault, I blame all recipes lol :) Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","Without alterating the recipe, I give this recipe 4 stars. It is a great base recipe but there were two problems: 1) too sweet and 2) too watery.  I bet this will be a five star recipe if you take into consideration the recommendations of the other reviewers. Cut the sugar to your liking and add no water.   I will make this again with a few small changes."
"1","5","left out the water, doubled the topping. amazing!"
"1","5","I'm a Apple Crisp lover- This was really great...next time i will drop the water."
"1","5","Great crisp. I did double the topping and it made more than enough."
"1","4","My family LOVED this. I left out the water and doubled the topping. Fantastic!!!"
"1","5","Simply the best apple crisp recipe Ive used will make this my #1!!! I doubled up the crisp and put 1/2 on the bottom,,,it is my favorite added some cinn. and used caramal topping to dribble on the top OH YEAH it is that good!"
"1","5","This apple crisp is delicious and so easy to make. I wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","5","This recipe was really good! I used a touch a lemon juice to prevent browning of the apples. I added about 1/4 cup of the water after reading the reviews of some who had problems. My filling was the perfect consistency after baking. I doubled the cinnamon in the filling and added nutmeg as well. I used a double recipe for the topping (we like alot of 'crisp') and added cinnamon to topping mixture as we are big cinnamon lovers. The recipe was a huge hit at my party. Thank you for sharing it!"
"1","5","This is excellent!! I followed the recipe, except I used wheat flour, more brown sugar instead of white, tossed in some pinhead (whole) oatmeal, and a packet of instant spiced apple cider to add flavor.   This made my whole house smell delicious! The first piece was soooo good! I wanted a second serving, but it didn't happen.. I got full right away what with all the oatmeal! Very hearty 'healthy' dessert!   Next time I'll cut the apples thicker (as they were a little to soft for my liking), toss some chopped pecans in the crust, and try the nutmeg like alot of people recommend. I'll be making this often! A+++++"
"1","5","This crisp is awesome. We did use the water suggested and it was ok - but, we had added more apples. We doubled the topping as suggested and it was yummy - it takes like caramel. My younger daughter says 'it's awesome'. We will definitely make this again."
"1","5","My first Apple Crisp recipe ever! Made this for Thanksgiving for 16 people- everyone loved it- not a drop left! I followed the recipe exactly too! I would not change anything except maybe 1/2 the water. I used some Swedish apples like Gala and maybe will try granny smith next time for a tart contrast ot the sweetness! Overall fabulous and will do the exact same recipe again!"
"1","4","This was delicious! I doubled the topping the first time, but that was too much. The second time I used the topping plus doubled it just by half. Perfect. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and used brown sugar for 1/2c and white for 1/4...I prob will just use 1/2 next time. The only other change I made was to add 1/4tsp nutmet. Perfecto!"
"1","4","Really good and easy recipe and yes, it's a bit sweet for my tasting and I didn't even use the full amount of sugar and only used brown sugar (though I guess that's probably just as sweet or sweeter!). Still good though. Added more spices too. and upped the amount of apples."
"1","5","This was a fantastic recipe! Normally I make new recipes as written the first time, but I didn't allow myself time for a test run before Thanksgiving, so I had to use my judgement and I have to say it came out great! I tripled the crust part because we like a nice cookie-like double crust. I also used only 2 tlbs of water and I mixed the apples in flour/brown sugar and stirred i the water before dumping it all on the bottom crust. I cut the sugar back quite a bit because I didn't have enough left after the other desserts I made and it didn't make difference, it was plenty sweet. I omitted the cinnamon because I'm allergic and this time around I didn't replace it with any spices. The wonderful taste of the granny smith apples came through, it was great! The water debate has a simple answer, imo, it all comes down to what you want out of your apple crisp. If you like it on the drier side, the juice of the apples will provide enough moisture to keep it from being gross. If you lke a nice sauce, add the full amount of water. I'm going to make this again next week and try it with more water just to see how it goes. The bottom line with this recipe is that it's flexible; you can adapt it to your own tastes and it will yield a wonderful harvest treat. Happy Thanksgiving!"
"1","5","FINALLY!! This is the one! The best apple crisp I have ever had... and I can make it! I used Granny Smith apples & followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp ground cloves to the apples. Makes me miss my grandma!!!"
"1","4","This turned out exactly the way I was hoping it would. Yummy! I made it with granny smith apples and it turned out great."
"1","5","Fabulous recipe. I reduced the water so it wasn't so liquidy. Otherwise, perfect!"
"1","5","Wow!! This was wonderful!! I followed another reviewer's advice and only used 1/4 c. water, and it turned out perfectly. Other that that, the only change I made was to add chopped pecans to the crumb mixture. Fantastic!!"
"1","5","I just made a half portion of this recipe as a test for Thanksgiving and it passed! So easy and delicious! I wouldn't change a thing."
"1","4","This is the type of apple crisp you dream of!!! The topping is thick and crunchy it gives substance to the dessert.I'm sure both whip cream and vanilla ice cream are great on this .. i served it with Fat free Vanilla froz.yogurt And it was terrific! only had 7Cps worth of apples but it was still GREAT! and by the way the flavor is even better the next day, try it!"
"1","5","Tasted great. My apples were a little on the soft/watery side before cooking - I should have omitted the water in the recipe or added more flour. Despite that, it turned out really good."
"1","5","This recipe was fantastic! I made it for my boyfriend who MMmm'd all the way through eating it and commented that it was just like his mom's.  My changes:  I mixed the flour, water, cinnamon,etc. together first, then into the bowl of cut apples which I then transferred to the pan.   I added a little nutmeg to this as well.  I do agree with another post about the quantity of sugar. This was very sweet and next time I will reduce the sugar. I also added a little more butter to the topping mixture as I like it mine with a bit more crunch.  however, without my personal modifications, this recipe still would have been great! it's now a keeper!"
"1","5","Very yummy! I used a combination of Granny Smith and Macintosh apples. I used Splenda and Splenda brown sugar and can't tell the difference!"
"1","5","Hands down, best apple crisp recipe ever! I have had so many compliments with this recipe."
"1","5","This was a very yummy apple crisp. It was a big hit with my husband and two boys. We had it tonight with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Based on other reviews I decided to use less water - probably around 1/4 cup, and I could have used even less. It thickened more the longer I let it sit, but it was still pretty thin for my tastes. Also, it was extremely sweet (and I even used all Granny Smith apples, which are very tart), so next time I will probably cut back some on the sugar. That's really a matter of preference, though - some people like it sweeter than others! Plus, I thought the apple to topping ratio was good as is. Any more topping would have definitely been overkill in my opinion.   All in all, this was excellent, and I'll definitely be making this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","this is the most delicouse crisp I have ever had I love it!!!!!!"
"1","5","Very good! I cut this by two thirds to make a good amount for my husband and I. I was out of baking powder, so I obviously didn't add it. If it made a difference, I didn't notice! I will definitely make this again-next time when we have company so I can show off!"
"1","5","Applicious!! This is a wonderful recipe..the only change I made is only adding 1/3 cup sugar to the apples!! So YUMMY!!!"
"1","5","This was excellent - I followed the original recipe, except I forgot to add the water. It came out wonderful and received rave reviews. I am making again tonight."
"1","5","This is the apple crisp I remember from my childhood. Crisp, crunchy top that stays crunchy the second day."
"1","5","This was a hit, and I have received request to make it again. The only thing I would change is adding water if your apples tend to be juicier you don't need to add as much or any water at all."
"1","5","fantastic! I used an apple peeler and slicer and whipped this up in 10 minutes. There was nothing left 30 minutes after it came out of the oven. Family devoured it. Thanks!"
"1","3","Overall, this recipe was decent. I made it with whole wheat flour and added walnuts. The walnuts added SO much flavor. Overall, I thought the apples were pretty bland, and cooking the dish for 45 minutes made them a little mushy for my taste."
"1","5","This was a delicious, basic apple crisp. Just what I was looking for. Thanks!"
"1","5","great"
"1","4","Very good! I made as written, next time would use less water & more oats."
"1","5","Amazing recipe. My family loved it with vanilla ice cream. I used a mixture of Jonathan and Granny Smith apples, and the combo was perfect. I ignored the advice of other reviewers to leave out the liquid (I used apple juice), and I regret that, as it turned out a tad more watery than I like. It really needs no water or other liquid. Other than that, perfect recipe."
"1","5","This is truely the best apple crisp I have ever had! I added nutmeg (a personal favorite)I also added both spices to the topping."
"1","5","I also left out the water in this recipe. It was SOOOOO good. Good enough for a 2nd bowl."
"1","5","Phenomenal! I tried someone's idea and made a crust and topping with the topping recipe. I also tried something and didn't use fresh apples, I used cut and seasoned canned apples. The crisp is DELICIOUS, never gonna lose this recipe!"
"1","5","Amazing. Easy. I added a little less apples. I made this for my boyfriend and he said it was better than his mother's...I have been competing with her recipes for seven years!"
"1","5","This has been the best apple crisp recipe I have tried yet. I actually use orange juice instead of water, I seen it in an old apple crisp recipe I used before, it's really good. I also add raisins. I use Cortland apples those seem to work very well. Other than the OJ I would change a thing. The water when I used it just kinda sat there on the bottom of the pan."
"1","5","Oh Mama, this is some excellent, extremely addictive stuff. I've made it twice in the past week. I used Granny Smith apples which are very tart and dry, so I used the whole 1/2 cp of liquid, but I used spiced rum instead. WOW! I also added more cinnammon and some pumpkin pie seasoning to the apples. I made my sugar mixture, then tossed the apples so they were coated perfectly, then topped with the rum. I doubled the top crumbly stuff and just lightly crumbled on top. It was absoutely pefect. Also served with butter pecan ice cream which was awesome. Don't make this unless you want to be addicted to it. :)"
"1","5","WOWEE!!! This is DELICIOUS!!! Used 6 MacIntosh apples tossed in 1 T lemon juice; decreased water to 1/4 c; stirred together apples and sugar mixture, doubled crust ingredients using 1/2 butter, 1/2 margarine (unmelted, cut into flour mixture). My son and I have already eaten 1/2 the pan and it's only been out of the oven a few minutes! Yummy!!!!`"
"1","5","Am total culinary hero after making this dish! I cut the water in half as well and it turned out really well. My grandmother - best baker I know - told me it was the best Apple Crisp she had ever had. Oh - definitely add the nutmeg."
"1","5","This is a very nice apple crisp. A classic. Have made it 2X in the past couple of weeks. The first time I followed it to a T, the second time a added a bit of lemon juice. Next time, I will add the lemon juice but less than what I originally added. The lemon juice is a 'sometimey' addition, as it depends on the type of apples used. If using sour type of apples, such as granny-smith, lemon juice won't be necessary, otherwise I like 'just a hint' of zip. Loved it and so did everyone else in my house."
"1","4","This was SO good. Great flavor and the apple to topping ratio was perfect, I don't think the topping should overwhelm the apples. However I did make the following adjustments: I used only 1/3 cup of the white sugar and replaced the water with 1/2 cup of apple cider (cider added more flavor but also adds sugar so 1 cup sugar would have been WAY too sweet), upped the flour to 2 tbsp for a thicker syrup, and upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. With those changes, the best apple crisp I've ever had."
"1","5","This recipe is delicious!! I followed the directions with the following exceptions: (1) I tossed the apples in the sugar, cinnamon and flour as one reviewer had suggested and (2) I did not add any water. The granny smith apples I used were juicy enough - the extra water would have been way too much."
"1","5","Delicious! It's really good reheated as well. Will definitely make this one again and again."
"1","4","The crust was very good. Nice flavor. I may cut back sugar to a half a cup the next time I make it because it was a tad bit too sweet."
"1","5","OMG so good. im 14 and i love to cook/bake so when my mom brought home tons of apples from the local orchard i knew id have to make an apple crisp. i added lemon juice another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples. the water isnt too much at all. the topping is plentyy, since it should be all about the apples. oh and i baked for 35 minutes and the apples were plenty done. i wouldnt bake anymore or it would get mushy. sooooo good! thanks for my new apple crisp recipe!"
"1","5","This recipe was simply delish."
"1","4","The topping was way too sweet for me. I enjoyed it, but if I were to make it again, I'd decrease the brown sugar by half."
"1","5","This is one of the easiest and most delicious recipes I've ever made!I think I'll try peaches or strawberries too. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and doubled the crust...just perfect!"
"1","3","I have to say I was a bit dissapointed with this recipe. There were soooo many EXCELLENT reviews about it I was expecting more than what I got. I followed this recipe to the T, except I added only 1/2 the water like many other people suggested. It still seemed too watery and mushy. The title is deceiving! lol... I guess I was really expecting something crispy- far from that. But it was good, I just would not make it again."
"1","1","This was the worst apple crisp i have ever had. The crumble top resembled more of a oatmeal cookie and not the sweet crunchy crumble i love on a crisp. I would never make this again... waste of time."
"1","5","I loved this recipe as it is written but wanted it a bit more healthy for some guests' needs. I substituted whole wheat flour and instead of using 1 cup of flour for the topping, I used 1/2 cup flour; 1/4 cup ground pecans; 1/4 cup slivered almonds. It increases the fat, but decreases the white flour content. I also used a Splenda Blend instead of the sugar."
"1","5","Is it possible to ward off loneliness with apple crisp? The answer apparently is “yes” – but only if you believe in the recipe. With its shortened list of ingredients and easy, fail-proof instructions, this recipe inspires confidence. Be sure to use only the crispest apples you can find, and go easy on the sugar. Served warm, with a single scoop of vanilla ice cream, this classic recipe is like being visited by a dear, long-parted friend."
"1","5","Delish! I didn't change a thing, just cut the whole recipe in half because my husband and I didn't need to eat the whole thing by ourselves!! (but we definitely could have!) Served warm with vanilla ice cream...yummy!"
"1","4","The topping reminded me of an oatmeal cookie. Good flavor, but the topping was not as crumbly as I prefer. It was a bit hard. Next time I will not melt the butter, I will just cut it in. Thanks."
"1","5","This apple crisp is delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and skipped the water completely, turned out great without it. I also doubled the crust and I am so glad that I did. I made the mistake of slicing my apples a bit too thin and they got mushy, my fault. I won't do that again. This is easy, fairly quick and yummy, cannot go wrong with this one. I will be making this over and over again!"
"1","5","This recipe is easy and excellent. It's hard to judge how much sugar you need to sprinkle on the apples because some apples are naturally sweeter than others. I used what the recipe called for but I think mine would have been better with a bit less sugar ( and I love sweet, sweet desserts). I questioned the addition of water because I didn't want a soupy crisp but I did add the liquid and it was in the form of apple juice. Excellent addition. It was not soupy at all (after it had cooled a bit, it set nicely) and the apple juice really added a nice flavor. I actually made 2 pans and in the other I used orange juice instead - also wonderful. Almost better actually. The only other change I made was to add a big splash of vanilla to the crumble part on top. It kind of made it taste more like a cookie on top. This is a really good traditional apple crisp. Good way to use up apples that are less than perfect to eat by themselves."
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!!!! Very yummy!!!!!!"
"1","5","Oh My GOODNESS...this is an amazing recipe. I loved it. You can make the crisp part, or if you just want the apples...it makes a great baked apple slices recipe, too."
"1","4","This was wonderful! The family loved it! I also doubled the crumb topping. Thanks"
"1","5","This was EXCELLENT! Based on the other reviews, which were very helpful, I used 1/2 the sugar, did not use water and mixed the apples w/ the ingredients before placing in the pan."
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out awesome! Used 9 or 10 Granny Smith apples."
"1","5","Amazing! This is a lazy weekend favourite of ours. I makes a great breakfast treat or a nice after dinner dessert. I really love the topping and so I tend to double up to make sure there is plenty to go around."
"1","5","This was delicious! Next time I will cut down on the water a little but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Yum!"
"1","5","Absolutely the hit of the party! I followed others suggestions by doubling the topping and using only 1/4 cup water. The search is over; this is the most sinful, perfect crisp recipe!"
"1","4","I've made this several times. Always delicious if made with the right apples."
"1","5","This is THE best apple crisp i have ever made. I used Cortland apples, and omitted the water, increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2tsp and added 1/2tsp nutmeg to the apples. We also love nuts, so as i doubled the topping, i also added 3/4cup chopped walnuts. yummmmmmmmy!"
"1","5","Awesome. I couldn't find my usual recipe, so I made this instead. It is now my only apple crisp recipe! I made this for a family get together and it was gone in seconds! Everyone wanted the recipe and I had to make another one the next day.  I used all Granny Smith from my own tree. I halved the sugar(For personnel preference) and I did not add the water. This recipe was GREAT! Thank you for posting the recipe."
"1","5","I only used the topping portion of this recipe but I thought it was the best apple crisp I have ever had. Thanks!!"
"1","5","This was my first homemade apple crisp, and I was very pleased. I used 1/4 cup apple cider instead of 1/2 cup water. Next time I may try adding the full 1/2 cup apple cider just to see what it does to the consistancy. I also added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the filling. I sprinkled the sugar mixture over the apples and it turned out fine. Next time I will try tossing the apples with the mixture to see if it makes a difference. Smelled wonderful baking!"
"1","5","I made this exactly I only doubled the topping. It was great. Even my picky husband ate it. Thanks."
"1","5","The best! I googled for 'The best Apple Crisp' this was excellent. I had fresh apples I had frozen...the only variation to recipe was I used Splenda brown sugar, instead of water I used apple juice and not quite as much as recipe called for, and I was out of baking powder. I am saving this and will definitely use it again. I have several batches of apples I have frozen and some peaches I will try this with."
"1","5","Wonderfully good. I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. My kids give it five stars, too."
"1","5","Excellent recipe!!! I used 1/2 cup rather than 1 cup white sugar and it was still plenty sweet. Reduced water to 1/4 cup. Mixed water, sugar, flour and cinnamon into apples rather than just pouring over. I look forward to making many variations of this recipe, mixing fruits, etc... Thanks!!!"
"1","4","Perfect! Easy! Great in a stone baking dish!"
"1","5","Excellent! Easy to make!! What a wonder Fall evening dessert to enjoy with family and friends! I will make this again and again."
"1","5","I just made this exactly as written--not one change and I think it came out perfect. I used 9 medium/small Granny Smith apples, mixed them in a bowl with the flour, white sugar, cinn. and water then put them in a 9x13 pan. Some people mentioned they would put it in a smaller pan than that, but I really don't know how it'd all fit in a smaller pan if you're making the full recipe. Put the crumble on top and voila--perfection! If you think it is too watery, you probably haven't let it set/cool down. I've made it twice and the first time I cooled it and it was not watery at all, the second time I tried to eat while hot out of the oven and while still delicious, was a bit watery. Just like a pie, if you let it cool, it will gel up for you."
"1","5","IT WAS SO WONDERFUL...I ADDED CRUST ON BOTTOM AS WELL SO IT WOULDN'T BE TO MUSHY!!!"
"1","5","Have not made however it is a must"
"1","5","This was absolutely fabulous!! My only suggestion is to substitute the water for a mixture of 1/3 water, 2/3 vanilla. I think ice cream & whip cream would be too much...have a coffee with Baileys instead! Thank you for a lovely recipe that even a beginner such as myself could not ruin!"
"1","5","Best apple crisp by far I've ever made. I used a 3 lb. bag of golden delicious apples, half the sugar and doubled the topping using whole old fashioned oats. It was perfect!"
"1","5","I've made this a couple of times now, for family gatherings, and it's been a big hit both times. Thing only thing I ever change is the size of pan. Definitely use a smaller pan. I use 8x8."
"1","5","I have to say this apple crisp recipe is absolutely AWESOME! Tweak it however you like, but the base recipe itself is fantastic! Many thanks to the submitter!"
"1","5","I have made many recipes from this website that were good but this is the first one I felt it necessary to leave a rating on. It was soooo good!! My whole family loved it and it was gone in less than 36 hours. Thank you!!"
"1","4","This was our 4th of July desert, along with Vanilla Ice Cream IV. It was a big hit, except the kids didn't eat the cooked apples. I used 6 large green apples (tossed in the sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mixture) and double the topping; cutting in the butter instead of melting it. Next time I will one-and-a-half the topping because it made too much in my opinion-- I had to get a bigger pan to hold it all! I forgot to add the water, but it still cooked nicely since apples hold a lot of moisture. But I like my apple crisp more saucy so I will make sure to add the water next time. Pecans would be really yummy in this as well."
"1","5","This is a great recipe, but next time I will use a bit less sugar in the apple mixture. I followed previous reviews and made my own changes. Instead of water I used 1/4 cup orange juice. I doubled the topping, but might try a bit less next time and added 2T shredded coconut and 2T chopped pecans. This was great, can't wait to make it again! FYI you must get one of those apple peeler/slicers gadgets, my son loves to help out and they make for fast work! Ours was only $30 and it gets lots of use!"
"1","4","I am not a big fan of apple deserts, but my husband wanted apple crisp for his birthday. I found this recipe and I am so glad because I thought I could never like apple crisp. It tasted really good especially w/ vanilla ice cream. My husband loved it, so thanks on his behalf too."
"1","5","Absolutely perfect! My husband who usually dislikes fruit desserts loved this. I followed several suggestions and reduced the water to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the apples. I also doubled the topping ingredients and added 1/2 tsp salt to the topping. Came out amazing. Gonna be a classic in our household!"
"1","5","comfort food at its best. just serve with a scoop or two of vanilla icecream. yummmm"
"1","4","I made the recipe pretty much as is (except I used softened butter instead of melted butter) and everyone loved it. It worked especially well with vanilla ice cream. The next time I make this, I'd probably tweak the following: substitute 1/3 cup orange juice for the water, substitute half of the white sugar for light brown sugar (and probably use less sugar overall), and add the nutmeg to the apple mixture. If I wasn't going to serve this with vanilla ice cream, I'd probably want to add a little vanilla extract too."
"1","5","fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","Awesome! Just as it is!"
"1","4","This was good but not great that is why the I gave this recipe four stars."
"1","5","This was a big hit, and very easy (except for the apple peeling, of course). It was delicious with ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Came out great! Thanks for the recipe, only change I made was to double the crust!"
"1","4","I wish I could give 4.5 stars. This was a delicious apple crisp. I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly into an 8x8 pan. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar on the apples. I had cut the water two tablespoons, but after baking it was definitely too runny. Next time I'll leave out the water or add more flour to the apples. But the flavor is definitely right on. It was my husband's first time having apple crisp and he is a big fan of it now!"
"1","5","definitely use less water (the bottom was runny). and use very sweet apples, because we didn't, and even though everything else was perfect, we couldn't get over how tart our apples were. the topping is excellent, but you will have lots of it on your plate, so eat this with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","I doubled the crusty part, and put half on top, and half on bottom. My husbands whole family said it was the BEST they have ever tasted!"
"1","5","The reviewers are correct this is amazing. I used Granny Smith apples, added a pinch of nutmeg, decreased the water, and doubled the topping (which I layered on the top and bottom). Although I love crumb topping, I actually thought that doubling the crumb topping was a little much."
"1","4","I mixed the white sugar, flour, cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg with the apples and cut out the water content - not needed since it is naturally very juicy. Use only Granny Smith apples or it will come out too mushy or too sweet. Cut down on the amount of brown sugar in the topping or mixed in with the apples - too sweet and drowned out the great taste of the apples. Also, double the topping and instead of melting the butter, cut it into the topping to resemble course bread crumbs for that crispy/crumbly top. For that special touch, add coarsely chopped pecans or any other nut you prefer - I added pecans and it was just delicious."
"1","5","Very yummy and simple. I cut the recipe in half, because I made it in a pie pan. Drizzled with a little carmel and topped with homemade whipcream! Yum!"
"1","5","WOW!!! What a great apple crisp. I'm a baker at a retirement community which houses some of the pickiest folks I've ever met. I decided to switch up my old apple crisp and try something new, and after making the switch I now have no intention of going back to my old crisp. I made this using a canned apple pie filling, I made the topping according to the recipe but I added the cinnamon from the apple layer to it. I also added a small amount of nutmeg. This is a fool proof topping. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!!!!!"
"1","4","This recipe was great! My boyfriend and I really enjoted it. I also followed the advice of other reviewers, and used only a 1/4 cup of water and doubled the crust recipe and used it on top and bottom."
"1","5","This was perfect... exactly what I was looking for! I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 pan; it was perfectly cooked in 45 minutes. Just added a dash of nutmeg to the apples... served hot with vanilla bean icecream and caramel topping. Thank you!"
"1","5","This was very good! I made it for Christmas Day and everyone loved it. I followed a couple of the suggested changes. I used granny smith apples. I shook the apple slices in the 1 cup sugar, cinnamon (which I increased to 1/2 Tablespoon), 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (which I added to the recipe) and flour mixture. I softened the butter and then mixed it with the topping in my Kitchen Aid mixer. I doubled the topping as many suggested BUT I found it was too much. I only used half. I planned to use apple juice in place of the water but I forgot to add it. I am glad I forgot. It was perfect. We ate it warm with quality vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","This apple crisp was DELICIOUS! The apples were good with the water sauce. The apples were not so sour that way."
"1","4","a little too sweet - use less sugar"
"1","5","This recipe that I tried was absolutely wonderful!! Great tasting!!! The only thing I did a little different was I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to it. I give this a 5 star rating!! Woooooooooo!!!!!"
"1","5","I made a smaller serving of this dessert and it was awesome. I did not change anything about the recipe. I loved everything about this recipe."
"1","5","This was my first apple crisp, and I wasn't disappointed at all! I omitted the water, as it is not needed. I followed what other posters said and added nutmeg to the topping. Also, instead of layering the topping, I mixed everything together and put on top of the apples. I kept it covered for the first 20 mins of baking and then left uncovered for the last half of baking. It was bubbly and delicious!"
"1","5","Delish and so easy. Followed recipe exactly, except mixed the sugar/flour mixture with the apples rather than just sprinkling on top. Great for breakfast and dessert!"
"1","5","Fantastic! I used eight medium to medium large Braeburn apples. I cut and peeled the apples into eights and laid then opposing directions in the pan. I diced the last apple to fill in the gaps. I doubled the cinnamon but used good stuff from a local spice store, china cassia I think? I also added the same amount of freshly ground nutmeg. I served it with Bryer's Double Churn ice cream, the kind without Splenda. Very tasty and not too heavy. My mom has made apple crisp my whole life and it's one of my favorite desserts. She said this was better then hers. That's saying something considering how well she cooks. Thanks for sharing it."
"1","5","This recipe is perfect. I followed the recipe exact and it was the favorite dessert for thanksgiving this year."
"1","5","This apple crisp recipe is sssooo good!!! I made a 13x9 pan for my husband and I and we ate half the pan in one night!! The taste was just perfect. The only thing I changed, was that I doubled the topping recipe which was just a little more than I needed but one batch wasn't enough for us. Other than that, the recipe is absolutely perfect just the way it is! :) You gotta try this! YUM!"
"1","3","Classic, but plain. Nothing special here."
"1","4","How could over 1,000 people be wrong?? Really good but I think it can be better than written with the following changes. I had A LOT of golden delicious apples, about 15 cups. Because they weren't sour, I left the sugar one cup and doubled the cinnamon and flour, didn't put the water and also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, juice of 1 lemon and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla to apples. Piled them in a deep corningware dish, doubled the crust adding to it 2 tsp. cinnamon, another 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. salt. But I think for me, doubling the crust was a little much, next time I think I will leave it as written, (only to make it less fat, but the crust was outstanding) Baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes, however next time 1 hour will be enuff. My house smelled HEAVENLY while it was cooking and everyone raved about the crisp served with vanilla ice cream. I will be making for many years to come!"
"1","5","This was really easy, quick and good! I used Splenda instead of white sugar and I did cut the recipe in half (6 servings and used an 8x8 glass bakeware). I also used a mix of Red Delicious and Golden Delicious. Can't wait to have it with vanilla ice cream! Yum!!"
"1","5","This is very good!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe many times - LOVE it! Top it off with French Vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Great! I made it in an 8inch pan and decreased the apples to approx. 7 cups but kept the topping the same. I will make it again."
"1","5","Loved it! I made this recipe for a work party and people kept coming back for more! I used Granny Smith apples, omitted the water, and added a little nutmeg. I also let the sliced apples rest in the sugar mixture for about a half hour before putting the oat mixture on. Serve warm over vanilla ice cream and you have Heaven in a bowl!"
"1","5","Oh my. Talk about the perfect fall dessert. I doubled the crust as other suggested, putting it on bottom and on top. All I can say is that this was a knockout recipe. Next time, though, I will use Granny Smith apples instead of Gala. Don't get me wrong, it was still awesome, but the Granny Smiths would kick it up a notch...."
"1","5","use less water, as others have suggested, add extra cinnamon and add a pinch of nutmeg."
"1","5","This was sooooo awesome! I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe. Amazing as is."
"1","5","So Yummy! I like lots of crust on my apple crisp, so I also like to make this in an 8 X 8 pan if I am just making it for our family. I just fill the pan with apples, and make the full amount of crust and spread over the top. Best Apple Crisp of ALL RECIPES!"
"1","5","This Is ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! I was looking for something sweet that I could make real quick and this hit the spot. No alterations were needed. I am sure I will make this again and again."
"1","5","Family loved this one!! Thanks for sharing!! Doubled the topping as other reviewers had suggested... Sooo YUMMY!!"
"1","5","This was a great Apple Crisp! I loved the crunchy topping. Just what I was looking for for a quick apple recipe. I did cut the water in half as the other reviews suggested."
"1","5","This was such a good way to use apples in dessert. The only things I changed were that I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and did not melt the butter which turned out great. I think it helped to reduce the water because it was just the right consistency. My baking time also wasn't quite as long. I might try it with syurp instead of water next time and reduce the sugar. This is one of those things that tastes even better the second day. Thanks a bunch!"
"1","5","The crust really is the best! I doubled the crust and pressed half of it down as a bottom layer. I also cut in chilled butter instead of melted butter. I mixed the apples (I used red/green somewhat sweet small apples from my tree) with the sugar (only 1/2 cup because of the sweet apples). I had let the apples soak in lemon water while I cut them, so I only used about 1/3 cup of water. It was plenty moist. Oh ya, I also used about 3 Tablespoons cinnamon (I love it) and about 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Next time I'll halve this recipe though, it's so much for just two people!"
"1","5","Awesome!! I made it for the 2nd time tonight! The first time I made this it was for a dinner party and everyone loved it! My husband is not a fan of anything with fruit and he asked me to make it again so I did tonight. I will be making this many more times I'm sure. I took the advice of some of the other ladies who posted reviews; I doubled the topping so I had a layer at the bottom and on the top of the apples, I cut the sugar in half and omitted 1/2 cup of the flour in the topping. The first time it was just a little too dry, but now it's absolutely perfect!!"
"1","5","SLAM DUNK, deeeeelicious!"
"1","5","This was perfect. I followed the recipe except for a couple minor changes first i added a LOT more cinnamon to the apple mixture (3-4 tbsp) and i tossed the apples in the sugar mixture rather than just sprinkling it on top. It turned out perfectly. I will definitely make this again"
"1","5","Truly delicious. I baked my dish at 375 for 40 minutes rather than 350 for 45 and it was perfectly crunchy! I also followed suggestions to use a touch of nutmeg, doubled the crust and 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup. This has already earned a spot as a 'fall staple' in or home!"
"1","4","Awesome recipe! I tried it today and I used the advice of the previous review. For example I did mix the white sugar and cinnamon recipe with the apples instead of spreading it on top and I only used 1/4 cup of water instead of half. I also doubled the dose as you recommended (layer of crisp on top and bottom) and it was delicious! Here's a hint of how I mixed the crisp recipe...I blended all of the ingredients for the crisp part along with chopped walnuts and I used cold butter cut into pieces instead of melted butter. The apple crisp was so good, even better than what you get at restaurants! Enjoy!"
"1","4","Yummy. I doubled the crust like many other reviewers suggested, however I don't think it needed it. Next time I will stick to the recipe! Update- I like it much better with only one serving of the crust. Gala apples are best because they stay crisp after cooking."
"1","5","easy to make and very good. I used Gala Apples and only used 1/4 cup water and it is wonderful warm ice cream"
"1","5","Great Recipe..and really easy! I have made this apple crisp 3 times and found the perfect amount of water to be just under 1/4 cup."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious!! And soo easy. I left out the oats because I don't like them, but it was absolutely delicious!"
"1","4","This was very good, but my Gramie makes better so this gets a 4."
"1","5","Absolutely awesome. Since I am a big fan of the crisp topping I am tempted to make more of it to put on top of the apples. An awesome recipe."
"1","5","yummy, add as many apples as you like"
"1","5","So easy to make and my husband's very favorite. I like to add some nutmeg, allspice and x-tra cinnamon to this....."
"1","4","Good -- I'll cut down on the sugar next time for our tastes."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Apples are sooo good for you. i reduced the white sugar to about 1/4 (used jonamac apples). The topping is great and crunchy. The sweetness in the apples and the brown sugar in the topping is just right so that you don't need that much white sugar."
"1","5","I've made this many times and my husband loves it. I think that the amount of topping is perfect. It's even better if you add some crushed nuts (pecans or walnuts). I think it's a bit too sweet, but no one else agrees with me so I have not tried to cut back on the sugar."
"1","5","I thought that this was a very good recipe. The only thing that I did different was I added more cinnamon and bit of nutmeg with the apples because my family likes things more spicy, and I added some toasted almonds in with the flour because I had them on hand."
"1","4","This was a hit with my family. I halved the water like everyone else was recommending, next time I will just omit it all together because the crisp was still a little runny."
"1","5","i absolutely love this recipe. i made 2 13x9 pans in one day and they were both gone in no time! I did cut down on the sugar by 1/2. A very good recipe, Thank you!"
"1","5","Whenever I make this, I get rave reviews! The topping is so good I multiply it by 1 & 1/2. Plus I halve all the sugars. I bump the cinnamon up to 1 Tbl., and add a bit of nutmeg as well. I often sneak wheat germ or bran into the topping, and nary a person has noticed yet. This is a winner, Diane!"
"1","5","OH SO GOOD! The apples i used were already really sweet, so i slightly decreased the amount of sugar. Turned out awesome - i definitely recommend :)"
"1","5","Wow! Nice recipe. It's so delicious - we love it. I just doubled the cinnamon, but that is cause I love the extra spice! This one is worth making... Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","This was a delicious apple crisp. I substitued 1/4 pure maple syrup for 1/4 cup of the water and it worked out great. I will make this next time I have to bring desert somewhere."
"1","5","I only used the crumb topping from this recipe, but it was fantastic! I used it to top fresh apricots and plums tossed with flour and sugar. A great recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe!! The first time I made this for a family bbq, I didn't add the water & it came out wonderfully--everyone couldn't stop raving about it! The second time I made it (just for my family), I still didn't use any water, I substituted Splenda for the granulated sugar & the Spenda Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar in the topping & it still came out excellent! This is a wonderful recipe whether using regular sugar or a sugar substitute. Thank you for sharing your receipe!"
"1","5","so delicious and so easy. I didn't make any changes at all and it is perfect."
"1","5","Delicious! I doubled the 'crust' recipe and added a layer to both the top and bottom, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and went to town on this. So good!"
"1","5","My husband really enjoyed this recipe and said it was the best apple crisp he's had. I added chopped pecans to the topping. Yum!"
"1","2","The flavor was just okay and it was really watered down."
"1","5","We used granny smith & gala apples (7 med. apples = 10 cups). As others reviewed, ½ c sugar & water was enough. We also mixed ¼ c maple syrup w/ the water. (very good addition!) This recipe is delicious warm or at room temp. High recommendations on this recipe."
"1","4","This recipe was pretty simple to make and very tasty! I cut the recipe in half and used peaches as well as apples and it turned out pretty good, although the peach nectar turn the bottom into a very thick syrup. But it still was yummy :)"
"1","5","We loved it and so easy to make."
"1","4","This is a good recipe, but it's really sweet (and I have a big sweet tooth). Next time I'd use 10 cups of apples or less sugar."
"1","5","Delish!"
"1","5","Quick and easy - very easy to prepare. My brother asked to 'wash the dishes' so he could have the pan!"
"1","3","Ok but not the best, is missing something... not sure what"
"1","5","Very good recipe, and very very easy. I used pears instead of apples because thats all I had in my house, but it came out great nonetheless. I cant wait to try the recipe again with apples."
"1","3","I'm sorry. It wasn't our favorite."
"1","5","OMG!!!This is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten! Thank you Diane Kester and many thanks to the reviews to help take it over the top! I headed the suggestions of no water none is needed; I used Granny Smith apples they make their own moisture. It was not dry at all. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp. cloves as one reviewer suggested it made me think of thanksgiving and great times with great friends. I also mixed the apples with the sugar/flour spice mix before adding to pan. I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts after the butter was cut into the crumble topping. I will no longer look for an apple crisp recipe again. My family went ape over this. I would make this everyday if it wasn't so fattening!!!! I'm going to try this with peaches next."
"1","3","Uh...perhaps I did something wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't know, but I found the topping kind of mushy, not 'crisp' like it should be. I have definetly had better apple crisps. I don't think I will be making this again. Sorry."
"1","5","This apple crisp did not last long, it was wonderful."
"1","5","Great recipe, definate family pleaser. With a few changes the recipe was made even more delicous. I used 7-8 granny smith apples and coated them with the sugar mixture before laying them in the pan. I also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and nutmeg to sugar mixture and only 1/4 cup water. I doubled the crust and had one layer on the bottom and one on the top and added almonds to one of the batches. Terrific recipe, my very picky brother couldn't quit eating it!"
"1","5","This was an excellent recipe, especially when the comments by reviewers are taken into consideration. I only used half of the white sugar sprinkled on the apples, plus only half of the brown sugar for the topping. It was wonderful, with vanilla ice cream. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan, which was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","4","I actually loved this recipe but my family did not?? They thought that it was okay and that the topping couldv'e been more crispy."
"1","5","I served this as a desert last Thanksgiving. I laid it out on the table for everyone and by the time I brought out the whipped cream it was all gone! It was really that good!"
"1","5","This was gone way fast after I made it! I doubled the crumbly mixture, which just added to the goodness! If i were to make it again, I would just take out the water alltogether I think, cause it was a little runny with just reducing it! Thanx a bunch:)"
"1","5","FABULOUS. Just like apple crisp should be. I followed the advice of using half the water, and it turned out perfect. Next time I will also halve the sugar on the apples. My fiance loved this, and he is a chocoholic!"
"1","5","I made this the other night for my dinner guests who absolutely loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe said and it came out perfect. I served it with ice cream and caramel sauce on top. Delicious!"
"1","5","Excellent apple crisp. I've made this many times--I've had problems with it being watery so I always omit the water; I also only use 1/2 cup white sugar on the bottom instead of one cup. The topping is perfect as is."
"1","5","Wow! Really, this is a perfect crisp and you should make it! My only change was doubling the topping as many others suggested...now, I can't believe I am saying this, but I think it was a tad much, and I used 12 cups of Granny Smith apples! I think 1 1/2 would be perfect as the topping...one batch doesn't seem like it would have been enough. I didn't lessen any sugar, but used half brown sugar with the apples...you will not be disappointed with this one!"
"1","5","This was such a yummy recipe! The only change I made was to double the topping. I think next time I will add less sugar to the apples also--a bit too sweet for my taste. The only apple crisp recipe I will use from now on. Really, really good! Thankyou"
"1","5","this is a great recipe. perfect for any fall occassion! my entire family loved it."
"1","4","I gave it 4 stars because I did make some changes. As some others have posted, I omitted the water and it turned out great. Also, I used just a 1/2 cup sugar and it was still way too sweet. It's probably partially due to the fact that I used Gala apples, which are sweet. I would prefer a tart apple in this, but I was snowed in and I had no choice! So maybe the sugar would be ok with a more tart apple. I would also double the crisp....I didn't think there was quite enough. Besides all that, I really did like it and I'll make it again!"
"1","4","Good, but I would do like others suggested and put the crisp on the top and bottom."
"1","4","Considering I had never had apple crisp before I didn't know what to expect. This was just an okay dessert for me, but simple and inexpensive. YAY!"
"1","5","My son loves apple crisp but couldn't find a good recipie. Tried this one. Everyone loves it. Turns out perfect every time. Will be making this one a lot."
"1","5","Hi there!!! I tried this recipe for the first time last night...it was GREAT!! But...I did alter it quite a bit, as there were some people who sent in reviews saying the topping was not 'crisp' enough. I used 6 granny smith apples, and I followed another reviewers suggestion to put the sugar, and cinnamon in a bag and coat the apples inside of it. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the mixture. Once I had done this, I was going to start to prepare the topping, but realized that I had run out of brown sugar. I left the apples to coat in the bag while i ran to the store. After I returned about 20 minutes later, the coating was almost syrupy from the apple juices, which actually helped in the cooking process, as I only needed to add 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup. I altered the topping as follows: I only used these ingredients: 3/4 cup flour, 1 cup quick oats, 1 cup brown sugar, and 3/4 cup melted butter...but I only added 1/4 cup at a time, and cut it into the mixture. I cooked at the same temperature as the original recipe, and for a few minutes less, and it turned out great...the topping was crunchy and crisp...and my husband says it's the best apple crisp I've made!!!"
"1","5","Gosh this was good! Much healthier without the crust, and used Splenda in the apples instead of regular sugar. Also soaked the apples in spiced cider for more moisture and flavor. Delicious."
"1","5","My husband wants this for his birthday ibstead of a cake!! I used half sugar/half real maple syrup and I chopped up a handful of walnuts in the topping. Yum!!"
"1","5","i had to leave feedback on this one, because all of the other feedback was so helpful!  fantastic recipe. i just hosted big christmas eve family dinner for the first time and made this for dessert. i modified the recipe in the following way (per previous suggestions) -doubled the crust recipe -ommitted water -added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the apple mixture  i also prepared this the night before, and kept the crust and apple pieces seperate before baking. since i had no room in the refrigerator, i had to freeze the apple mixture and thaw the next day. i wanted to mention this part in case there are any other less-experienced cooks out there like me wondering if such a process would ruin the finished product.  oh, and i served it with a scoop of caramel ice cream!"
"1","4","This was very tasty except I thought it was way too sweet. Next time I will cut the topping ingredients in half."
"1","5","havnt made apple crisp before, but I tried it and it tasted really good! it was easy too!"
"1","5","i've made this in two different ways. first in the pan for at home. it was delicious. i used fresh from the orchard Macintosh apples. beautiful!! the second time i made individual cupcake holders for a bake sale we were having. they completely sold out and everyone raved!! i'm making this again for a big family dinner and it is sure to be a hit. great recipe - wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving & it was a big hit! The prep is a little time consuming (peeling, coring & slicing) but the end product is worth it. I brought it around to my in-laws & my family's home and everyone loved it. It's easy to assemble & it's a real crowd pleaser."
"1","2","Way too sweet."
"1","4","First off, the taste was wonderful. However, I didn't feel that the apples were cooked to my satisfaction so I doubled the cook time to 1.5 hours. Unfortunately, it came out REALLY watery for some reason even though I omitted the water. Must have been the type of apple I used. The topping was really crisp and tasty. I really love that stuff and I felt that there was more than enough without doubling the recipe like some of the reviewers recommend. I'll need to experiment with types of apples next time around. Very good with some cool whip!"
"1","5","I made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and it ended up being ate up by the family that can by over the next week. Everyone loved it and it tasted better the next day. I was taking the suggestion of mixing the apples in a cinnamon and sugar mixture before putting on the topping, but I forgot and layered the entire bottom so I just sprinkled the apples with cinnamon, sugar and a little allspice and it turned out good! I might make some in the next few weeks with apples being all over the place now."
"1","4","This was really good stuff. I used fuji apples, and dotted extra butter on them before adding the topping. We'll make this again!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! My daughter said it was the best she's ever had, and I followed the recipe exactly. No need to change a thing. Thanks so much for posting this recipe."
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful!!!"
"1","5","This was great! I omitted the water, as others had suggested, cut down on a bit of the sugar, and I also made a caramel sauce with butterscotch caramel chips, corn syrup and a bit of water- over med. heat on stove, and drizzled that on top with - oh so yummy!! Will for sure make again."
"1","5","Great way to use up all those fall apples! Fills the whole house with a wonderful smell!"
"1","5","BEST Apple Crisp ever."
"1","3","Very good, but too much sugar. I only halved the recipe and had to throw the rest away because it was too sweet. Too much for us..."
"1","5","Excellent. Doubling the topping seemed too much but 1 and 1/2 times was just perfect. Didn't use any water as most recommended and have to say it was the right choice, the apples were moist and juicy on their own. The only changes I would make are to reduce the amount of white sugar by half and add an equal amount of allspice to the cinnamon. I'm going to try this recipe with pears next!"
"1","4","not bad... i made it for my apple club and everyone enjoyed it, the only issue is that it needs to have the side of ice cream, until i find an apple crisp that can be eaten alone the best any of them can get is 4"
"1","4","This recipe is very good- however, i am only giving it 4 stars because it is a little sweet. This may be my fault because i dont think i used enough apples. I would suggest to others that you make sure to use plenty of apples- i used 5 and could probably have used double that amount. The taste of the topping is very good. I will try this again with more apples because i really do believe this has 5 star potential."
"1","5","Apple crisp that's actually crisp! This was so yummy -- the only change I made was to use less apple than called for (just because that's the way I prefer it). Thanks!"
"1","5","I normally make my late grandfather's family recipe, sorry mom, I have a new favorite!!! The topping is wonderful. I don't even like warm apples, but I love love love this recipe!!! Quick easy, and delicious! Left out the ice cream and the cool whip...wonderful all on its own!"
"1","5","Here are a few changes I made:  4 cups of Gala apples & 4 cups Honeycrisp apples and omit water.  Instead of doubling the topping ingredients, I used an 8.5x11 glass baking dish, instead of a 9x13. Once the apples were medium diced (not sliced) I added only 2/3 white sugar, 1T of flour and cinnamon (more could be added to taste) to them and let set for about 10 minutes or so. In regards to the topping, I used dark brown sugar and made sure the unsalted butter was softened, not melted.  This recipe is GREAT!!!"
"1","5","AWESOME!!! This was definitly a big hit! I did use less water and I think next time I will use none, but still tasted great, I served warm with vanilla ice cream. I will definitly make it again!!!"
"1","5","Awesome!! I made this for my husband to take to work for a party and, of course, I had to try it. I ate almost half of it to myself! Unbelievably good! My husband had to hide it from me so there was some left for him to take. He told a friend it was 'killer' apple crisp! I used 10 Northern Spy apples, didn't add water and I doubled the topping. Excellent! I am making it again this weekend!"
"1","4","The most work intensive part of the recipe was peeling the apples! I made this recipe for the people in my office, but I had to sneak it out of the house because my boyfriend didn't want to part with it. It suggest serving it warm with fresh cream or with vanilla or pumpkin ice cream. The only drawback was that the crust stuck to the bottom of the dish and was hard to serve. Next time I'll make a thicker crust and grease the pan better. Also, watch that you don't let the butter soften too much for the crumble mixture or you'll end up with brown sugar droppings instead of crumbles. I used dark brown sugar and it turned out great!"
"1","2","I don't get all the raves. I won't make this recipe again, no offense. Too much water in the bottom of the pan after baking.It was fine after fishing all the water out. I also baked it for 15 more mins.,as I like tender apples in an apple crisp, not crunchy apples. Wish I would have read the reviews before making this one. In it's defense, the topping was delicious after adding more cinnamon."
"1","4","This was very good and very easy. I can't say much more that hasn't already been said except... warning... the apples coated with sugar and spices are awesome! Stop right there and you have an awesome treat! I did double the topping and it was too much. Based on the reviews, I felt it would be dangerous to have a full pan of this sitting around so I split into two square pans (froze one) and had so much topping that I tried to put on the bottom as well as top. A good apple peeler is a must, like the pampered chef one. Oh, and I was doing this recipe to use up leftover apples from apple picking so these were not the freshest, crispest available and it was still delicious!!"
"1","5","This was absolutely delicious! I used Gala apples so it was a little juicy, but it was very good! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I thought it was a little on the sweet side, and would have preferred a dash more cinnamon, but overall delicious and hubby said it was the best he's ever tasted! Thanks."
"1","3","i think it was a great recipe. i definately changed it a little bit. i made it a bit sweeter by adding a lot more cinnamon and sugar. i doubled the recipe for the crisp topping. overall it was a hit, everyone loved it."
"1","5","This was fantastic!! I made two and sent one to work with my husband, everyone loved it."
"1","4","Very good recipe, nice and simple. I'd never made apple crisp before and this was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I'll definetly make this again for the holidays."
"1","5","This is a really nice and easy version. In fact this has a special place for me because its the first thing I made for my hubby to be! It was a thank you gift that hit him in all the right ways! ~_^"
"1","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. I've made it 3 times in the past 6 weeks with a few alterations each time. First time, did it other suggested doubling the topping (but not the oats) - it was perfect although i found the cinnamon flavor a bit strong. The second time, I was out of oats but still doubled the other topping mixture while decreasing the cinnamon a bit and it was fabulous. I like ours cold so the water issue is probably not as big for us as it is pretty firm when chilled. As I type this my daughter is cutting up apples to do it all over again. This is definately a keeper!"
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp ever!!!"
"1","5","My husband loved this recipe. I used 5 granny smith apples and 4 gala apples. The gala were so juicy that I did not add any water and it turned out perfect!"
"1","5","My family loved it! I didn't add any water, I don't know why you would need water, the juice of the apples gives plenty of moisture. I doubled the topping, but I won't next time - we would have preferred more apple less topping"
"1","5","This was my first apple crisp--yummy!!! I used 1/4 C of water, which i would delete next time. Little watery. I also used old fashioned quaker oats, and chopped them a little finer in a chopper. The topping of the apple crisp tasted just like oatmeal cookies."
"1","5","This recipe is amazing! I had dished my husbands bowl and was in the kitchen dishing mine when he came in and gave me a kiss and told me that it was the best crisp he had ever eaten."
"1","5","OUTSTANDING. I omitted the water, doubled the topping, and added some graham cracker crumbs I had leftover in the pantry. The BEST. Oh, and I used half granny smith and half braeburn. (total of 6 apples)"
"1","5","I made this apple crisp for friends we had for dinner last night and it was the perfect fall dessert. I left out the water as suggested and am so glad I did.. The apples produce enough juice. I recommend making 1 1/2 times the recommended topping. So yummy and will definitely go in my permanant recipe box."
"1","5","My husband begs for this each fall. We like to think of it as a movie... 'Apple Crisp II: The Reckoning -- This time it's delicious!'"
"1","5","This is a terrific recipe for fall. I typically halve the apple filling part of the recipe so that there's more topping. I like to use Jonathan apples for this one. I typically cut the water in half or omit it altogether. Try serving with vanilla ice cream for a real treat!"
"1","5","EXCELLENT!!! Doubled the topping (best part) and cinnamon. Eliminated the water. Served with Edy's cinnamon ice cream as dessert for get together. Everyone loved it. Thank you!!!"
"1","5","Really, really good. I used rather juicy apples and added in a few pears so I had to extract some juice at the end, but WOW! Like some others I too made extra topping. Also, I used all organic ingredients which really punches up the flavors. yummmmmm..... :-))))"
"1","3","This was just ok. I doubled the topping as others suggested and didn't really care for the topping at all. It was an 'average' apple crisp...served it to friends who said it was 'good' but didn't get the oooo's and ahhh's I was looking for.."
"1","5","I, too, doubled the 'crisp' ingredients and decreased the water to 1/4 cup. Was amazing! Thank you for this recipe."
"1","5","Excellent! Only change was using 1/4c. of water instead of 1/2c as suggested by others."
"1","5","Tastes great all by itself! Didn't change a thing, thank you Diane."
"1","5","Makes me remember Fall. This recipe was perfect just the way the recipe is laid out. Thank you for sharing this delight!"
"1","5","YUM! Just like what mom used to make. Thanks so much for sharing.  ps - I did not add as much water, but you need to make that judgement on the type of apples you use."
"1","5","This one is a keeper. My boyfriend has been begging for it over and over again. I did double the topping and it was perfect!!!"
"1","5","I made this recipe for the daycare center where I work as a cook, and it's a hit! I made it with half as much topping and only 1/4 cup of sugar with the apples, and it's still delicious. I also skipped adding water. I will be making this again!"
"1","5","Great, great, great! The smell of it baking was unbelievable. I, too, didn't measure exactly 10 cups of apples - in fact, I had the 9 x 13 pan heaping full. Made 1-1/2 times the topping for added crunch and texture - will it last long? NOPE! Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Doubled the topping for extra crunch. Only used 8 cups of apples instead of 10 cups. Makes the house smell great and tastes even better. Recipe takes some time, due to peeling apples but it was worth it."
"1","5","I'm only reviewing the crumb topping (made a pear crisp instead) and I must say the topping is just perfect. So tasty and not too terribly unhealthy either!"
"1","5","all i have to say is 'wow' for such an easy dessert, it has so much flavor. I had a lot of canned peaches in my pantry and used them instead of apples, and upped the flour by a tablespoon. Next time i will add cinnamon to the topping mixture. great for a last minute dessert."
"1","5","This was an awesome and easy recipe. I actually made peach crisp. Followed the same steps, just used peaches. I also added a dash of lemon juice on top of the peaches before spreading the oat mixture on top. Also, added some all spice, ground cloves, and a tad of ginger."
"1","4","This was very yummy, but, for those who use Paula Red apples, I would recommend decreasing the cooking time by about 30 minutes. I eliminated the water and my apples were still mushy...more like applesauce. I'll try again."
"1","5","I changed the recipe just a tad, used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar, added nutmeg as well as cinnamon, and put a couple of cloves on the top of the crisp. I also dribbled a little bit of maple syrup over the top just before baking. Beautiful!"
"1","5","Amazing! I make this for family gatherings. People now requst it."
"1","5","This was such an easy recipe and is incredibly yummy! My husband is a big apple pie fan and I wanted a recipe that was easier to make for him but had a similar flavor. I'm not a big apple fan, but even I must admit that this was fabulous served slightly warm with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yumm!"
"1","5","I used Granny Smith apples and followed the recipe. I did double the topping based off of recommendations and this was the best apple crisp I've ever had. My guests raved about it and my father also said it was the best apple crisp ever. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","I am not a fan of apple pie or crisps but everyone devoured it and said it was delicious, I served it with vanilla ice cream. I personally thought it is REALLY rich."
"1","5","I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 c., may use even less next time since this was a bit sweet for my taste. I'd also reduce the water a bit, and add a teaspoon or two of lemon juice. But the flavor and texture was great and the rest of my family raved about it, so I'm still giving it five stars."
"1","5","My dad used to make apple crisp for Thanksgiving using the apples from the trees in our back yard. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, and the water to 1/4 cup. I also mix the sugar and cinnamon with the apples at least an hour before making to mix the flavors. Serve warm with vanilla bean ice cream! So good!"
"1","5","Oh....GOOD stuff!! I omit the water but otherwise prepare as written. DELICIOUS!! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","This is a wonderful and easy dessert that always meets with rave reviews!"
"1","5","Wow! Made this twice already. Definitely double the topping. Give this one 10 stars!"
"1","5","ohh mmyy gosh...I eyeballed my way through the recipe..cut it in half b/c I only had four apples...used less butter...and it came out DELICIOUS! It came out a little soupy even without the water, its sweet apple sauce is even better to put over ice cream!"
"1","4","This recipe was pretty good. Me and my fiancee added nutmeg and instead of water we substituted half and half.I think it would be awsome with vanilla or french vanilla ice cream on top."
"1","5","Very good dessert on a cold Winter day !!! I made 1 1/2 times the topping - which was crunchy (awesome !!) I also added extra cinnamon and nutmeg into the topping before baking ... simply delish !!!"
"1","5","Great taste. I made 1 1/2 the amount of the crisp like others recommended and it turned out so good! It was still crisp & crunchy after it had been in the fridge."
"1","5","This was a big hit! I doubled the topping as many have stated. Got a lot of requests for the recipe!"
"1","5","soooo good. I served it with vanilla ice cream. the entire family loved it, even the 3 year olds. will make again."
"1","5","Easy & hit the spot -- I scaled this down to 2, then made 2 single servings in tiny pyrex cups (like small glass ramekins, maybe?), and it was perfect! The only thing I would change is scaling down (maybe cutting out) the sugars, since I used the maple & brown sugar flavored oatmeal packet (single serving), since that's all I had around for quick cooking oats. But a fab, quick snack!"
"1","5","Too good !!! May be I would reduce the sugar/brown sugar a lil bit next time ."
"1","5","Delicious!!! Thank you"
"1","5","This was a big hit at a football party. I served it with vanilla ice-cream and a little carmel sauce. I did double the topping as someone else suggested and it was a perfect amount. I will definately make again!"
"1","5","Very good, but watch out - it makes a lot. And the topping is not crispy the next day. I'll make half a batch next time, which should be enough for 8 to 10 people."
"1","5","Look no further...this is the one! I used it to replace my lost family recipe and have made it dozens of times in the last few months. Only change, I do not use the baking powder or soda in the topping. Wonderful! Thank you!"
"1","5","Wonderful! Will definately make it again for Thanksgiving!"
"1","5","My mom has always made apple crisp for me as a child and this kicked it hardcore. I loved it and I will keep this recipe. I added 3 cups nectarines in the place of some apples and it was amazing. I would also suggest that you go 1.5 times the topping. I also used about 2/3 cup sugar for the fruit and there were absolutely no complaints."
"1","4","Very good, but too sweet. I reduced the amount of both sugars quite a bit and it was still delicious! Recipe is definitely a keeper with the fixes."
"1","5","Absolutely the best without a doubt! I do not use the water through because it is too runny. Update: I have made this as gifts for several people. They tell me it is the best they have ever had! My favorite apple to use is Honeycrisp. They are a sweet-tart and very juicy apple, that is why i do not add the water to the recipe. They perfect Fall dessert!"
"1","5","I made this last night for my family, and they L-O-V-E-D it!! My husband kept saying it tasted better than Friday's version! I tweaked the recipe just a little bit by adding nutmeg to the topping before putting it in the oven. Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"1","5","Fantastic. My husband rated it better then the apple crisp the bakery in his restaurant makes!"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe!! The sweetness of the topping was just right - not too sweet."
"1","4","Easy and yummy, but needed something more to balance the sweet..."
"1","5","Everyone loved this. Added pecans to the topping. Would add more nuts next time."
"1","3","Even after cutting the sugar down and using granny smith apples, it was still too sweet, I will not use this recipe again."
"1","5","Easy recipe to follow and good result."
"1","5","made twice, 2nd time substituted applesauce for water, 15 apples in stead of 10 and doubled the topping as other reviewers had suggested and it was awesome, it was good the first time but perfect the second"
"1","5","This is very good but, I can't believe I am saying this because I am such a sweets person, it is too sweet. I will make again but decrease some of the sugar. It has a very nice texture and I even substituted 1/2 of the flour with wheat flour. Everybody enjoyed it!"
"1","5","Absolutely yummy! I followed the suggestions of others and omited the water, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and doubled the topping mixture. I made this for a crowd of people who all thought it was delicious!"
"1","5","Delicious! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and the water to 1/4 cup. However, I think it can do without the water. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!! My search for the perfect apple crisp is over. We loved this recipe...even the kids loved it & they have never been big on desserts with fruit in it. It was very easy...I doubled the crisp topping & added more butter as suggested. We're going apple picking this weekend & can't wait to make this recipe again!!! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This was THE best apple crisp recipe l've found. I omitted the water because the apples seemed juicy enough, and I mistakenly put the white sugar in the topping instead of the apples, but it still was wonderful! Thank you for a great recipe, Diane :)"
"1","5","This recipe is SO GOOD!! I added an extra 1/4 cup butter, and also did away with the water. I also added 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and lots of cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the apples. It's extremely easy to make, and very much worth trying."
"1","5","This was great! My family loves the crunchy topping, so I doubled it and it was incredible.  Try this one...I can't believe your family wouldn't love it!"
"1","5","On the advice of others, I increased the butter in the topping to 1 cup. Came out too sticky. Keep it at 1/2c. I couldn't resist taking a bite of the topping before cooking... I almost didn't cook it. I could have sat there all day and just ate the topping, it was sooo good!!! Thanks for the awesome recipe!"
"1","5","This is yummy and simple. I cut the recipe in half (cook time about 30 minutes) and it fed 4 adults and two toddlers ample portions."
"1","5","I've tried many crisp recipes and never liked them. But I tried this one and it is good! Only difference is 1C butter & added cinnamon to the crust (plus to the apples) because we're cinnamon freaks! Very good!"
"1","4","My apples came out mushy and soggy- almost like a chunky applesauce... I should have read the recomendations of ommitting the water and Im sure it would have been great. The topping was fabulous. I'll make this again but without the water!"
"1","5","This might seem like a weird thing to review in the middle of summer, but I actually made it with peaches because none of the peach crisp recipes looked that good. I used 5 cups of fresh peaches cut into thin slices. I then put on half the amount of sugar, the full amount of flour and cinnamon, and one quarter cup of water. I love lots of topping, so I made twice the amount of it, using traditional rolled oats, not quick cooking, so some of the extra juices were absorbed, but there was still a nice crunchy layer on top. I hope that some other people who have had troubles with too much sweetness or water are helped by these hints and I cannot wait to try this recipe in the fall with apples. Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe that can be used with such a variety of fruits!"
"1","5","The others said it all... no water, extra topping. Perfect!"
"1","5","mmmmmmm.... I used a little less than a cup of splenda and it came out GREAT!"
"1","5","my daughter made this for dessert and it was awesome. Look no further for a good apple crisp resipe. Serve with ice cream.....yeeeeeeummm!"
"1","5","Simple. Great. Loved the oatmeal. LOVED this recipe!!! I didn't even change a thing"
"1","5","Great. I made this with a frozen bag of mixed berries and no apples. I then cut the white sugar in half and omitted the cinnamon. Delicous and no apples to peel!"
"1","5","So good!"
"1","4","A great apple crisp, although I admit I did change it quite a bit to try to make it healthier. Like others, I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I've also made this with Splenda replacing the white sugar & it works really well too. I also increase the cinnamon to suit my own taste. For liquid, I use about 1/4 cup of orange juice - gives it a nice flavour and doesn't make it too watery. For the topping, I use 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 1 & 1/4 c. oats. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and use light butter. Even with all these modifications it is still delicious. I'm sure it would be even better with no modifications and with extra topping (the best part!), but when you're trying to eat more healthily, these changes work well."
"1","5","My entire family loved this recipe! I have made apple crisp in the past which were kind of dry. This was very flavorful and juicy. I will keep this recipe around for a long time!"
"1","5","With a little modification VERY GOOD!! Use less white sugar 1/2 cup, no water and double the topping and it comes out perfect!"
"1","5","Everything an apple crisp should be! It does not need the water - I left that out completely. I did a 1.5 recipe of the crisp portion and it turned out fantastic. Next time I will add some more oatmeal. Also, I will use less sugar on the inside - maybe 2/3 or 1/2 cup instead of the full cup - it doesn't need that."
"1","5","I had a package of frozen peaches, strawberries and cherries that I didn't know what to do with so I began searching for a recipe and stumbled upon this one. I'm so glad I did because this was excellent. I just substituted the fresh fruit in the recipe for the frozen fruit and it was such a good home-cooked dessert."
"1","5","Very easy and tastes wonderful. My family loves this recipe. I had to double the crust ingredients to cover the apples."
"1","5","I put unsalted mixed nuts in the food processor and added it to the topping mixture and also 1T more butter. So, so, so yummy! Everyone loved it!"
"1","5","SO AMAZING! Humiliating to admit, my husband and I finished this whole thing in one sitting, with a pint of dulce de leche ice cream. I substituted splenda for the white sugar, and used light butter, with no problems."
"1","3","good, but should say to bake uncovered and to peel the apples first. thanks!"
"1","5","I made this for the first time for Christmas for my family and it was gone in less than 2 days. Very good recipe, Diane....I look forward to making it again!"
"1","4","This was good. I used four pears and four apples, and it was the perfect amount. I used one and a half times the topping and it was perfect."
"1","5","This recipe was a hit with my family, I didn't add the water (like others suggested) and I suggest that maybe cut the cup of flour, oats & brown sugar down to maybe 3/4 of a cup each. There was just to much 'dry' topping left on top and not very much 'crisp'. I also used spartan apples and they turned a tad 'mushy' but noone except me noticed! Over-all, a very pleasing dessert that everyone loved."
"1","5","Easy and quite yummy -- we loved it and so did our guests."
"1","5","Great recipe, the family loved it!! Only change is that I too did not add the water."
"1","5","I can not say enough about this dessert. With some vanilla ice cream...you want more while youre still eatting it."
"1","5","Just like I remember my Grandma's Apple Crisp...outstanding and very easy to make."
"1","5","I've made this for friends and family and they all love it. This is a must have for your recipe box."
"1","5","MMmmmm! I have made this twice already! I made the first one with water and second without. I agree with everyone else...you do not need to add any water. I used 2 packets of Quaker Oatmeal Raisin and Spice....delicious!"
"1","5","Wonderful! You will get many clumps from combining the 'crumble' mixture -- be sure not to break these little clumps up, as they are the best part of the topping."
"1","5","This will now be my permanent apple crisp recipe! Just made this recipe for the first time for a family gathering and we all loved it!! I used Granny Smith apples. Tastes just like my grandmothers recipe, but a much healthier version! Highly recommend!!"
"1","5","Very good recipe. I used 2/3 of the white sugar recommened for coating the apples and mixed it with the apple slices. Did the topping as written-it was the perfect amount. Served with vanilla ice cream. Yummy! Thank you Diane."
"1","5","Yum! I cut the sugar in half, added 50% more of all topping ingredients not including the sugar, cut the water in half, added a tsp of vanilla, and one of cinnamon to the topping. It was not watery at all."
"1","5","It was great, with a few changes. I only have 4 people in my family so I cut down the recipe. (You can do that at the bottom of the screen. Type in the amount you want.) I made the first mixture and instead of sprinkling it over them I mixed them in it. I put the sliced, peeled, and coated apples in little individual cups. I left out the water. Then I put not melted butter in the next mixture and cut it in. I sprinkled it over the apples evenly. From here if you are not serving it immediately you can put it in the refrigerator, if not instead of putting it in the over put it in the microwave for 2 min. Good Luck MMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
"1","5","I made this last night for the first time and didn't change a thing. It was perfect. The water wasn't an issue for me, but maybe that's because I made it earlier in the day and then warmed it up that night. It was totally crispy on top and delicious. This recipe for Apple Crisp was super easy. I'd make it again in a minute."
"1","3","This recipe is not the kind of apple crisp I like, it was very wet and too sugary. I like mine more firm and the topping to be a little crunchy hence the 'crisp'. Won't try this recipe again."
"1","5","I found this recipe to be pretty good. I made it exactly how it was written but if I were to make it again i'd probably change a few things. First I used my food processor to slice the apples and I feel like the apples were then sliced too thin. When they baked they cooked down pretty far and were really, really soft. If I use this recipe again i'd either slice by hand or cut the apples into chuncks and there would be more of them, I'd completely fill up the baking dish. Also I felt like there was a lot of the crisp topping so maybe i'd layer SOME of it in with the apples. Other than that it's easy to fix and DOES TASTE GOOD."
"1","5","Egads! This recipe is awesome! Prep time is estimated at 30 minutes-- with an apple parer/slicer/corer the entire prep time took me closer to 15. Very easy to make. And the results! YUM! I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and I never will. I'm not a big cinnamon fan, and this is delicious, not too sweet, not too cinnamony, and it really showcases the apples I recently bought from a local farm. The topping is crunchy and sweet. This is an excellent classic apple crisp. My 4 year old and 1 year old ate this dessert in record time. Wonderful!!"
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't overly pleased with the results. The taste was good, but the water was not nessicary, the apples were just floating in liquid under the crisp topping. The topping ammount/flavor was just right, and my only other complaint was that there was too much sugar in the apples. The whole cup of sugar was way overpowering, even though I used tart apples, I'd try 1/3 cup next time. I've had and made much better apple crisp. This recipe is about average. I would not use this recipe again."
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful! So simple and very tasty, it was a hudge hit in my family. I too, doubled the crisp portion of this recipe, with the advise from other users."
"1","4","This was a great apple crisp. I did use more topping than called for and decreased the amount of sugar in the apples just a little. I used Granny Smith's and this was good."
"1","4","I made this for my family tonight....it was pretty good, I took the advise of others and reduced the sugar on the apples, but I wished I had left it according to the recipe, as it was a little tart. I doubled the topping. Overall it was very tasty. I should have used the water, I used about 1/8 cup, and should have stuck to the recipe? I doubled the crust, glad I did that. Will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!!"
"1","5","This is a keeper! My 12-year-old and I made this together for a potluck. It was great fun peeling and cutting the apples together. We omitted the 1/2 cup of water and doubled the crisp. I overheard several people at the potluck commenting on how good it was and wondering who made it. My daughter enjoyed the praise too."
"1","5","This one is a keeper! My boyfriend has an apple tree in his yard and suggested I make us a cobbler. He thinks I'm a great cook and I didn't want to admit that baking is NOT my strong point. I found this recipe, it looked simple so I made the apple crisp instead. He LOVES it! Used 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the water and doubled the topping as others had suggested. Turned out great... THANKS!"
"1","5","Awesome. We have apples from a tree in our backyard, and this recipe made them taste super yummy."
"1","5","This is soooo good with ice cream. I also have used this recipe for peaches. Excellent!!!"
"1","5","My husband and I love Granny Smith apples, and this recipe is wonderful with them. I cut back on the water as other reviewers suggested but kept the amount of apples and topping the same. It was absolutely delicious - we ate leftovers for two days and were sad to see the dish finally empty! Goes great with pork chops and garlic new potatoes."
"1","5","YUMMMMY!! I made this two nights in a row - for two sets of friends. The only thing I changed was that I made individual servings in ramekin dishes instead of one big baking dish. Everyone raved about it...my friend and her husband both wanted the recipe :) It tastes soooo good you would never think it was this easy to make! Thanks, this one is a keeper!"
"1","4","YUM! I halved the amount of apples, white sugar, and water and baked everything in an 8x8 pan."
"1","5","Mmm, just like mom used to make....this one gets rave reviews from me AND everyone I've ever fed it to (my boyfriend said it was 'dangerously good'). I halfed the apples and doubled the 'crisp' for a better balance...I can't imagine how that much crisp can be enough to cover ten cups of apples."
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe everyone who has tried it loves it. I follow the recipe to a tee and it always turns out great."
"1","5","I tried this recipe as a means to use up some eating apples from my refrigerator; therefore, I made a few changes. Instead of water I used orange juice (yum), I only used a 1/2 cup of sweetening with the apples since they were not tart (Splenda instead of sugar to save on calories), and instead of cinnamon I substituted apple pie spice (very nice). The topping was prepared as instructed.   If the recipe was this great with not-so-fantastic apples... I can hardly wait to try it with some crisp granny smiths! What a hit with the family! Quick, easy and deee-lish-uuuus!"
"1","4","Very good, though a little on the sweet side. I think it's because I didn't use granny smith apples. Next time, I will try using a more sour apple and also cut the sugar by just a little. Instead of using a 9x13 pan, I used 3 nine inch pie pans - fit perfectly. Definately a keeper. Thank you for the great recipe."
"1","5","Diane is my aunt! This really is the best apple crisp recipe around. Served warm with vanilla ice cream is great."
"1","5","An easy and wonderful recipe. I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","5","this was really good a nice change from apple pie, doubled the recipe and added some shredded conconut to the top crust as well as some walnuts"
"1","5","I have tried many apple crisp recipes over the years and never found one that made my husband happy until I tried this one. He loved it and so did I!"
"1","5","so excellent- followed all suggestions and substituted oatmeal with instant apple cinnamon flavor oatmeal- quite a treat. My husband is a crisp expert and he loves it! I'm making 2 more for Thanksgiving"
"1","5","WICKED GOOD. I've been looking for a keeper of an apple crisp recipe and this is IT. I, too, left out the water and doubled the topping. Came out perfect. This is pretty much THE definative Apple Crisp recipe. NICE."
"1","4","My family really enjoyed this recipe! But I made a few revisions: 1) I used 52oz of canned apples or 1/2 of a large can (a much better buy right now :D ) 2) I added 3T lemon juice 3) only 1/2c of white sugar 4)2/3c brown sugar 5) chopped walnuts and added them to the topping and 6)added approx. 1/2 t of nutmeg to the topping as well. I also did not use any water in this recipe. Because I used canned apples it only needed 25 minutes at 350 degrees. This was awesome in that it was a quick dessert! Also I topped each square with a dallop of whipped cream! Even if you don't use canned apples many of these changes will make it a better crisp."
"1","5","The only bad thing about this recipe is it disappears as fast as it goes together! I didn't add anything to the apples other than a slight sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon (the Ida Red apples I had were already pretty sweet). I cut down on the butter and sugar in the topping. Also used a 50/50 mix of white sugar and brown sugar. I bet this recipe would be terrifc with peaches...Thanks for the awesome recipe! Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","This is my favorite apple crisp recipe - it deserves all of the rave reviews. I use Granny Smiths and depending on the apples will sometimes adjust the amount of sugar and water. It makes a generous amount and is even better the next day!"
"1","5","The best apple crisp I've ever had! I also added some nutmeg to apples and crust and doubled the crisp recipe to pack 1/2 in bottom of pan for crust then topped it off with natural vanilla Breyers icecream when it was done and ready to serve. Yum!!"
"1","5","Removed water and doubled topping, it was wonderful!"
"1","4","This is a REALLY good recipe, but I used two cans of Comstock apples and added a dash of nutmeg to the apples. I agree with the other person, there is no need for the additional water as this 'juices' up nicely. Overall though....really really yummy! Also, about 5 minutes before it comes out of the oven, I take some apple juice(only about 1/4 cup) and drizzle it over the topping, makes it a little more moist on top."
"1","5","This was the best apple crisp I have ever had! I used 5 granny smiths, but next time I think I will use 10. ( I like a lot of apples.) The topping was GREAT! My husband, who is very picky, absolutely loved this dessert. I will definately be making this again! Thank you!!!"
"1","5","Deee-lish! I halved the recipe and used splenda instead of granulated sugar."
"1","5","Made it with 3 extra-large Melrose apples, sliced with my handy-dandy 50's style Vegomatic. Instead of doubling the topping, I went 1.5 times, which ended up being a perfect amount for the 9/13 inch pyrex pan. Simple, fairly fast, and minimal cleanup! Just my kind of recipe."
"1","5","I have had to make this for two weekends in a row, because the family LOVE it. It is a fabulous recipe...thanks Diane. I too left out the water and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup. Tomorrow is Sat, so guess what I'll be doing...yes, making it again."
"1","5","yummmmy! so easy and so great! I did what some others sugg and doubled the toppings and didn't add the water. You get plenty of liquid from the apples no need for the water."
"1","5","This is an amazing recipe and I have baked it 4 times in about a month. Everyone who has tasted it has asked me to print it from this web site for them. Awesome, I must say it is because of the oatmeal, it just makes it taste so close to apple pie but better! Plus this is easy to make, you just can't go wrong."
"1","4","I tend not to follow recipes to the tee - since I use recipes just to create new ideas for myself. I used this recipe to create something different...more like an apple brownie crisp. I halved the apple mixture (the first 4 ingredients) and omitted the water, which was reecommended in previous reviews. I then combined the remaining ingredients as the originally calls for and instead of crumbling it over the apple mixture, I mixed the coated apples into the topping mixture. I placed this all in the pan. For extra streusel topping, I halved the topping mixture and topped the whole pan with it. After baking it in the oven for 40 minutes and cooling for 30 minutes - the results were SPECTACULAR! It seems to freeze well too. So whenever I'm in the mood for something apple-y sweet, I pop a piece in the micro, and top with sweet buttery caramel. Vanilla ice cream doesn't hurt either! Thank you Diane for giving me the inspiration! :)"
"1","4","I used 5 large ginger gold apples in a 7x11 baking dish. I skipped the water and cut the white sugar back to about 1/2 cup and it was plenty. I used all the topping ingredients, and it was probably a bit too much. The topping, although delicious, overpowered the apples. Good basic recipe."
"1","5","This is very good...I may have to use this instead of making pies. It's easier, tastes better and has no trans fats."
"1","4","I have never made an apple crisp before. I tried this recipe and loved it. My husband also enjoyed it, he loves apple crisp. The only thing I did different, was to mix the apples with the cinnamon and sugar mixture in a bowl first and then put it in the pan so the apples were well coated. And it definately needed to double up on the topping. I will be making this one again!"
"1","5","This recipe was DELICIOUS! I admit it was a bit sweet which took from the apple flavor, so next time I will make the white sugar 1/4 cup or less. Also - I halfed the first part of the recipe so it would fit in my 9x9 square pan.   I would make the topping for so many other things - I was thinking it would be GREAT with a sweet potatoe casserole for Thanksgiving.   Thanks for sharing your recipe with us (my old apple crisp recipe was just apples covered in a brown sugar/butter/oats mixture)."
"1","5","Easy and wonderful!"
"1","3","This was pretty good but I was a little disappointed. I thought it was a bit dry and not as moist and tasty as I had hoped."
"1","5","This recipe is fantastic! I will definitely try doubling the topping and skip the water."
"1","5","so many people cant be wrong. Just be sure to dbl the topping."
"1","5","I'm not an apple dessert fan, but this was incredible! I have to say that every time I went into the kitchen, I had to steal a bite or two. It's been requested of me to make it again and again."
"1","5","Plain Ol' Delicious, I served it up warm with some vanilla bean ice cream to my guests. They loved it, this recipe is definetly a keeper. Next time though, I will double this because it was gone within 15 minutes. Thanks"
"1","5","The easiest dessert I've ever made!! I took this to a potluck and had no leftovers!! It was a hit!!"
"1","5","Yummy Yummy...I made this using 5 granny smith apples. I did not use the water and I doubled the topping and only used 1/c cup sugar. It came out perfect not to sweet the apples where nice and juicy and the crisp was perfect. I served it coffee mugs with vanilla ice cream on top. My 2 year old loved it and he dont like much. Will make again over and over :)"
"1","5","This was a wonderful recipe. I halfed the recipeand it was great!! I made it this mornig and half is gone already!! I added some vanila extract, all spice, and nutmeg. I did cut back on the water and it was just as bubbly and good. I did double the topping I will definitely make again. My two year old loved it. She doesn't even like apples. Thanks for the great recipe!!!"
"1","5","This was excellent. The best recipe I have used!"
"1","5","This was a HIT. It was gone the moment I put it out on the table!!!"
"1","5","Fantastic! The cinnamon was wonderful in the recipe. It even tasted great cold, the next day."
"1","5","Yet another awesome recipe from this website! This is a huge hit at my house. Serve it warm with some vanilla ice cream on top and you've got it made! Once I made it with green apples. I didn't care for it that way. It was too tart, but my man loved it. Great recipe!"
"1","4","Very yummy! I used 3/4 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup. Turned out great!"
"1","4","This had a great flavor. I used frozen apples and did not need to add the extra water. I will definitely be making this again."
"1","5","Great, Easy recipe, I like to add Walnuts.."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! It tasted like I spent a lot of time but it was sooo easy. I will make this again and again. Tastes great with vanilla ice cream on top! Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","OH MY GOD! This is the best recipe I have ever tried, I search high and low on the internet and it never appeared that maybe a good recipe was in my face all along. I made mine with peaches and I made extra topping for the peaches and it was very good. Use extra topping, trust me it want be enough. The topping is good by it self"
"1","5","My kids and husband LOVE this recipe!!! I add an extra 2-4 apples though so that the crunchy topping isn't so overwhelming. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Very good! Served to guests and they loved it. My friend asked for the recipe. I made twice the amount of topping and nearly used all of it. Because of the extra topping, seemed a little dry while baking so I sprinkled some additional water on top then finished baking. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","I have used this several times now-thanks for a good recipe that helps to use up all the apples we have out here in the country. Really warms up a winter night!"
"1","5","I always thought Apple Crisp would be so hard but this was so easy! Very delicious too, my whole family loved it. Next time I may add more cinnamon but all in all in was excellent!!"
"1","5","After a Christmas Eve apple pie crust disaster this morning, I was left with 6 sliced apples sitting in cinnamon/nutmeg sugar & wondering what to do with them. I certainly didn't feel like making another pie crust, so I decided to give this simple recipe a try. It came out delicious! I snuck a little taste while it was still warm & I know it will be a big hit tomorrow after dinner. The oats really add a nice touch to the topping. Thanks!!"
"1","5","Came out great!!!"
"1","5","My husband told me this is the best apple crisp he has ever tasted."
"1","5","this was the best apple crisp i have ever tasted, everybody loved it. This recipe is a definite keeper. kim"
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe. It is delicious and so easy and quick to make. I have made this one several times and it is always a hit with everyone who has tasted it. The last time I made it, I added a 1/2c. dried cranberries to give it some color and tartness. This is definitely one you can add to your holiday recipes!!!"
"1","5","This is a wonderful, great idea for the holidays. I think it would be so much better than making an Apple pie. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
"1","5","Very good. I followed everyone's advice and doubled the topping and omitted the water. The result left it just a tad dry so I might just make it the original way next time. Everyone did love it though."
"1","5","Delicious! Simple ingredients make this a wonderful homey dessert. In the topping mixture, I added a few 'shakes' of cinnamon. I serve it warm with butterscotch ripple ice cream."
"1","4","Excellent & so easy. I agree with other reviewers - a tad too sweet but that is easy to alter. Thanks Diane for an easy desert that we have had three times in two months!"
"1","5","I loved this and my family did too. This will become my new family recipe.. Easy to make and you can use some variations for your own taste"
"1","5","Great recipe! Quick and easy. I added a little nutmeg. You really have to double the topping recipe. I didn't, but will from now on!!"
"1","5","Turned out great! Very yummy! I love crisps especially since I don't have to deal with a crust!"
"1","5","This was fabulous!! Next time I will leave out the water & double the topping. I used granny apples & it was wonderful. Serve with vanilla ice cream & it's sure to be a hit!!"
"1","5","Yummy! This recipe has replaced my old standard...served warm with butterscoth ice cream..can't get enough...."
"1","5","I'm a terrible cook and this came out WONDERFUL! I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the topping mixture and cut the sugar a bit. I'm eating my second helping right now! Too bad my boyfriend is out watching the baseball playoffs!"
"1","5","BEST apple crisp recipe I 've ever used!! My husband asks for this once a week."
"1","5","Yummy!!!"
"1","5","Super! This is a must bake recipe! I reduced the white sugar by half and put a little less water. I have had so many requests to make this again."
"1","5","This is wonderful! I'll be making this recipe A LOT!"
"1","5","This was so easy to make and tasted great. Thank you for sharing!"
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever had! We love it!"
"1","5","oh my godness!!!! i am eating this as i type....this is WONDERFUL!!!!! especially ontop of butter pecan ice cream DEEELICIOUS...thanks"
"1","5","everytime i make this i get incredible compliments. easy and delicious! thank you."
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever tasted. It's also easy to make. My 12 year old sister was able to do most of it herself, aside from cutting the apples."
"1","5","Great recipe! I loved the oatmeal topping. I didn't have any quick oats, so I substituted them with a couple packs of the flavored breakfast oatmeal. It actually worked and tasted delicious!"
"1","5","This recipe is GREAT! I think there is a lot of sugar but I have cut back on that... Thanks for posting this my family and friends all love it!"
"1","3","Smelled great as it was baking! It was too sweet though. I will try it using granny smith apples next time and also with less sugar."
"1","5","This was absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","With all of the raves and reviews about this recipe, I couldn't help but to try it. I cut the recipe in half to make it for my husband and myself. Or should I say, for myself! I ate about 90% of it within 24 hours. This recipe is AWESOME!!! I made it again a day later for work. They LOVED it too!!! Thank you for a GREAT recipe. Next time, I will share more of it with my husband. He LOVED it too."
"1","5","PERFECT!! I also used 5 cups of apples and kept everything else the same....couldn't have been better!!"
"1","5","Loved it! Was fast and simple and the crumb topping was great. Apple crisp has long been one of my favorite desserts and this recipe is one of the best I have had. Easy too, with the melted butter you don't have to 'cut in the butter' which takes forever."
"1","5","This apple crisp was very tasty and everyone loved it. I was very impressed!"
"1","4","This made a very attractive desert that my husband and or dinner guest loved. (I chose to skip desert). I will make this again, it's simple and coupled with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, you can't go wrong. I only gave it three stars for 'kid friendly' because my son chose to have just ice cream (typical kid?)"
"1","5","This is the best apple crisp! I have been looking for an apple cobbler/crisp recipe ever since i went to the New Orleans Las Vegas buffet and had the apple cobbler there. I have tried several apple crisp/cobbler recipes to find the right one and this is it! It's sweet but not too sweet and it has that soft, warm, smooth texture. Everyone in my family loved it! I will make it again and again."
"1","5","Fabulous!!! I doubled the topping. Everyone loved it. This one is going straight to my recipe box!"
"1","5","Well, this is the first thing I have ever tried to bake...and it turned out wonderful. I took it to a ladies Xmas party and everyone loved it. The topping was the best!! It wasn't too sweet just perfect."
"1","5","This was a HIT! I added in some canned peaches to give it a little tangy flair. That was a great change, try it!"
"1","4","For some reason, the top of this recipe turned out a bit dry for me. But overall, it was delicious. I'll just have to make some modifications to avoid that in the future. But we added extra cinnamon for even more flavor."
"1","5","Fabulous and easy! My father spent a long time searching for a crisp like he had as a kid. I seem to have continued his quest and think this is it!! Only wish I could he could try it! Thank you!!"
"1","5","This was my first apple crisp attempt...I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, next time I am going to try making it in a smaller dish so the portions are more substantial. Very very very delicious.  Will definately be making it again. Goes great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","My family loved this dessert! It has a great oatmeal cookie like crust. My kids are begging for me to make it again."
"1","5","The best apple crisp recipe I've tried. Crunchy topping!"
"1","5","Delicious"
"1","5","I have been looking for a great recipe for Apple Crisp, and now I found it. This recipe was very simple, but probably the best tasting crisp I have ever made :)"
"1","5","I love this recipe! I made it for dessert tonight and the 8 of us finished off the pan. There was plenty of topping, which I like the best. Yummy!"
"1","5","I loved how easy this recipe is to make.I made it for a party and it was all eaten.Everyone loved it.More of the apple crisp was eaten than the cake.Great recipe."
"1","5","Mmmmm! This was yummy. I made it last night with apples I bought at a farmer's market yesterday morning. Just the right amount of apples & cinnamon, and LOTS of crunching topping! (That's the best part!) The recipe says it makes 12 servings, but I think they would be fairly small. The way we cut it, we got about 8 larger servings. I will definitely be doing this one again while the apples are still in season."
"1","5","I made some for us and the neighbors and it was reported to be completely eatten that evening! Not just great tasting, but easy!"
"1","5","Yummmy! Made three batches and the whole family loves it! Thanks. This site is great!!!"
"1","5","First time I made apple crisp and love the taste! Very easy to make and popular with my family of four! I made the first batch two days ago. It's all gone by last night! I am making another batch today! Thanks for contributing!"
"1","5","I'm making this for everyone, I have a apple tree. I'ts very good. I love the topping. Every body wants the recipe. I love this site. I'ts so easy to email recipes.   Donna"
"1","5","Very simple to assemble, especially with Applemaster peeler/corer! Absolutely delicious! This is a definite keeper!! Thanks for posting it!"
"1","5","I always thought my crisp was good until I found this one!!! Great recipe!!!!"
"1","5","This was really yummy!!!! I will definitly make this again!"
"1","5","My whole family loves this apple crisp! Very simple with the use of my apple corer/slicer."
"1","5","My seven year old doesn't like anything, but he loved this. I know it will a favorite at our house all year long."
"0","5","Used 2 tsp apple pie spice instead of cinnamon, used 1/4 cup water."
"0","5","Excellent!! Best apple crisp I ever made using apples freshly picked from my dads apple tree :) I did make just a couple changes though:  I doubled the topping, used just 1/4 c water and those were the only changes I made. I found it needed a full hour in the oven to really be done.   Once you make this you'll never need another apple crisp recipe again, this ones the holy grail!"
"0","5","This is delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would do differently next time is not add the water."
"0","5","I had a whole bunch of granny smith apples and a few assorted other softer apples that I didn't really want to eat fresh, but they made a mighty fine crisp. I appreciated the reviewers who mentioned that more sugar might be necessary for cooking apples and less for eating apples. I ended up using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in with the apples, and I think I could have reduced it a bit and done just fine. Also I've never put water in my crumble, but I have put lemon juice, so I tried 1/4 cup of water and it worked very nicely. The topping: I followed advice to not melt the butter. Instead I let it soften a bit, cut it into bits and threw the whole works into the food processor to blend it, as I have no patience to cut in the butter by hand. I used 1.2 kg or about 9 cups of apples in a 9x13 pan, and I found that to be a good filling to topping ratio. I will use this recipe again, with or without variations such as nuts in the topping. Thanks."
"0","4","Very yummy, but probably could have used half the water. I made with freshly picked Cortland and Jonathan apples and sweetness was just right. The only oatmeal I had in the house was steelcut and it gave the crumble a little extra texture. I liked it."
"0","5","Delicious! I followed the recipe, added a bit of nutmeg, doubled the topping, but it was a bit too much. Next time I would use 1.5 times the topping. Baked at 350 for 60 min."
"0","5","Doubled the crunch topping. So yummy!"
"0","5","Added walnuts fantastic simple recipe."
"0","3","It was good but too watery. To much liquid."
"0","1","Way too sweet/way too watery! This is one of those recipes that I honestly have no idea why everyone likes it so much. I had a bunch of very tart apples and thought this recipe would work well because it has so much sugar in it, boy was I wrong! I am definitely a sugar eater. We drink sodas and eat an assortment of desserts at our house on a regular, and often daily, basis. But this recipe is WAY TOO SWEET. Be sure to have a gallon of water ready just to keep from getting too nauseated. I do not recommend for a diabetic, even in a tiny portion. Another issue is that it's way too watery. My normal apple crisp doesn't call for any water at all. I should've known better than pour 1/2 cup of water on this. I thought that since it got so many good reviews it would be good.... wrong! Save yourself some calories, glucose, apples, and water. Pass this recipe up."
"0","5","Amazing. Followed the others comments...did not add the water and only put half the sugar. I also didn't have enough apples on hand, I used a mix of apples, strawberries and blueberries."
"0","5","OMG this is so good! I took the advice of other reviewers and added a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, used granny smith apples and did double the topping but I think it would be just as good using 1 1/2 times the topping recipe listed. It took a full bag of small size granny smith apples to make. The first time I made it I added 1/4 cup of water and the second time no extra water. Both ways are great right out of the oven but the sauce thickens after cooling and really does need the extra 1/4 cup of water especially when you re-heat it later, but I think 1/2 cup of water is a bit to much since the apples make liquid as they bake. The water helps keep it from being to dry when you re-heat it a day or two later in the microwave. I think adding 1/2 cup of extra water might make it to soupy. I also think the next time I make it I'll try using half granulated white sugar and half light brown sugar for a more caramel flavor. This makes a full 13x9-inch pan so if you want less you might want to half the recipe. It also warms up beautifully in the microwave and tastes as good 2 days later as when you first took it out of the oven. A scoop of vanilla ice cream would really put it over the top. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Yes it's that good! I've been cooking and baking for 58 years and this is the absolute best apple crisp I have ever tasted or made and I've made several of them over the years. It's the only one I'll be making from now on. Thanks so much for sharing this wond"
"0","5","This tastes like apple cider crisp. It is so, SO, good. I made changes (because don't we all), I only added 1/4 cup of sugar on top of the apples--I like a little tart. I didn't add water, either. It turned out so amazing--especially topped with a little whipped cream. (Out of Ice Cream from a late night binge last week. Oops.)"
"0","5","Perfect! Best Apple Crisp I have made yet! I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change anything."
"0","4","I am not a baker and this recipe was simple and came out perfect! Next time i would use less sugar just for health sake but besides that it was GREAT!"
"0","4","I halved the recipe and used a 9 inch pie plate for it. The amount of sugar, both in the apples and in the topping sounded like too much, so I cut it by half and the dessert was sweet enough for us. We served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream"
"0","5","I used this recipe for the crust only. I used my homemade canned apple pie filling and the dessert was delicious!"
"0","5","I made this recipe several times this summer with some home grown apples from my friend's farm. They were slightly tart and so it made it perfect with the sugar and sweetness from the recipe. Definitely will use this recipe more."
"0","5","I made this recipe two days ahead and kept in the fridge, covered in foil. It turned out as if I made it an hour before. Also, I did not add any water and had a lovely sauce with its own juices."
"0","4","Liked this but did not like how watery it turned out. I will be omitting water next time. And a little too sweet for my taste too."
"0","4","We love this recipe with ice cream. But we use half white sugar and half brown. This way is very good"
"0","5","Easy, delicious, will make again!"
"0","5","I loved it. I would never try another recipe. I found my apple crisp!"
"0","5","everyone ate it all up the same evening I made it! I did make some modifications however. I added 4 tablespoons of flour and reduced the water to 1/4 cup and it turned out perfect. I also added cinnamon to the topping."
"0","5","I read all the reviews beforehand. Since it was a desert for 4 people, I reduced the apples to 8 cups. I omitted the water as suggested and halved the white sugar. Otherwise all measurements were according to the recipe and it turned out awesome. I am making it again today and will try to get a picture before the vultures descend."
"0","5","Definitely the best Apple Crisp I have ever made! Followed the directions exactly and it was a hit!"
"0","5","My Family loved this. I doubled the crumble topping as others suggested and found it was WAY too much. The top of my pan was completely covered and I ended up throwing it away. I also mixed the sugar, flour and cinnamon together and poured over the apples. I did not add any water. The Apple Crisp was so delicious and so easy. A great way to use up some excess apples."
"0","5","This apple crisp is amazing. I made it just as the recipe calls. It is awesome! Vanilla ice cream is a must!!"
"0","5","This apple crisp was sooo good! My first time making it, so I was a little nervous when serving it to my guests. Big hit with everyone. House smelling amazingly was a perk. Will make again for sure. Thank you so much for this recipe."
"0","5","This was really easy to make and smells delicious. Can't wait to see how it turned out."
"0","5","This was amazing, I thought I'd try something a little different and I liked it. I just cut up the apples, no pealing, and mixed that sugar/flour/cinnamon/water base together and stirred in the apples to make sure all were coated. I have a 9x13 slow cooker and used that. With the soaked apples in, covered with the mixed topping and cooked on high for 3 hours and it was magic. The apples were soft and the topping moist but cooked, it was GOOD!"
"0","5","I did not change a thing , nor would I. This is the best apple crisp recipe I've made."
"0","5","This was delicious! I used 6 Granny Smith apples and it was perfect."
"0","5","Excellent recipe, I particularly liked the melting of the butter rather than cutting it into the flour. I made a few changes; I doubled the amount of flour to the sugar, cutting the sugar down to 3/4 cup. This thickened the sauce more. I doubled the amount of cinnamon in with the white sugar. I doubled the topping but it could have been just 1.5 instead of doubling. I only used 8 cups of pippin apples, leaving room for the extra topping. I added two cups of walnuts, coarsely chopped, to the topping mixture. When baking with walnuts, I always toast them in the oven on a baking sheet at 200 degrees for about an hour to give them added flavor. I also added one teaspoon of vanilla extract to the topping."
"0","5","Turned out great!"
"0","2","I made it, didn't care for it to floury, my husband lked it."
"0","5","Delicious!!!"
"0","5","The only change I made was added 1/2 the water. The apples I used were moist. Turned out delicious!! Definetly will pass it on."
"0","5","I messed up....Laugh Out Loud I forgot to put my flour in the crumble topping so here I was sprinkling flour on the top just before I threw it in the oven. Like everyone else I doubled the topping recipe and I ran out of butter so all I put was a 1/2 c. butter but I added a little water to the crumble topping.....this is still quite delicious and I cant wait to make it the right way :)   exquisite with a dollop or two of ice cream on top...."
"0","5","Made 1 and 1/2 times the topping recipe and substituted orange juice in place of the water. A family favorite!"
"0","5","Was deeelish...tho I did cut sugar in half,the proportions were still... right on the money. Will be looking for more recipes that have the best flavors, lower in sugar...Thx.."
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","5","This is my go to apple crisp recipe that is now our families favorite dessert! Don't change a thing, (tho you can always up cinnamon...try a dash of nutmeg! Mmmmm. The crumble topping is so good, this time I'm increasing it! (1 1/2 cups each of oats/brown sugar/flour... 1 1/2 sticks of butter). I use 11 'lunchbox sized' Granny Smiths. Top with whipcream vanilla icecream while it's still warm! (Reheats great too if you have leftovers)"
"0","4","Very good, but needs salt!"
"0","5","I used this with fresh picked wild apples and since my hubby doesn't do refined sugar I substituted the white sugar for 3/4 C dark pure maple syrup and left the water out and the brown sugar for Palm sugar. it turned out great!"
"0","5","Delicious!!! I made one with Splenda & one with sugar!!! Fantastic!!!"
"0","5","Worked great. Was delicious."
"0","3","This was a great quick dessert that went well with vanilla ice cream. I would suggest using the granny smith apples to offset the sweetness of the dish and to hold the shape of the apple slices."
"0","5","Amazing recipe, it was very easy to make and amazingly delicious."
"0","5","It was wonderful!!! I used baking apples (green pippins) and a couple of fuji's I had laying around. I made it as instructed. It was perfect. We used the juice to pour over the ice cream apple combo, it was perfect! Next time I will add some raisins and walnuts, just because I think it would be delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","This was delicious. I've made it 3 times. The first time as is but I thought there was too much sugar and water. Still delicious as is which is why I gave it 5 stars. The second time I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, did not use any water and added walnuts to topping. Third time I reduced sugar to half cup, no water and added walnuts to topping. This was the best so far. I may still reduce sugar further. The applies from my tree are really sweet and juicy so I think it really depends on what kind you use. I don't know what kind they are but they look similar to Fuji."
"0","5","Super fast to make! Great with vanilla ice cream. The only adjustment (personal choice) I doubled the crumble on top. Awesome!"
"0","5","This is delicious! I added the 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the flour/sugar mix to coat apples. I also doubled the crumb recipe, it definitely didn't crumble for me, but it was still deliciousssssss!! ?????????? I followed every other step"
"0","5","I omitted the water, used more cinnamon, doubled the crumb mixture. It was a big hit with the whole family. Delicious!"
"0","5","Best apple crisp EVER! So delicious....and the crisp part was actually crispy. I could even hear the crunching sound when I was cutting myself a huge slice to test it out about an hour after it came out of the oven.  The changes I made, was that I doubled the crisp portion of the recipe, and used a bit more than 10 cups of apples (probably closer to 12). I used 2 types of mystery apples that came off nearby trees. (Half were mostly green, very large, and quite tart. The other half were smaller, a bit sweeter, and very red and delicious to eat as is). I also tossed the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl first. (I did not add water to the apples either.) With the crisp part being doubled, I put half of it into the dish first and pressed it down, then spread the apple mixture on top of that, then spread the remaining crisp mixture on top. I was hard pressed to get it to fit in a 9x13, pan (so I pressed the crumble mixture hard into the dish lol.) Anyways in the end it fit, but it was kinda heaping in the middle. But I just put a cookie sheet on the rack below it to catch anything that that dripped out. The end result? Fantastic!"
"0","5","Fantastic!"
"0","5","Great tasting. I doubled the topping and added half the water. The Fam loved it!"
"0","5","Love it!"
"0","4","I used Gravenstein apples from the farmers market. I must have cut some too thin because some pieces came out a bit too mushy for my taste. Next time I'll all the slices thicker for more of a bite. I added extra cinnamon and some freshly grated nutmeg. I cut down the sugar as we like a tart crisp. Served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Delicious!"
"0","5","Just delicious !!"
"0","4","I like to cut some of the apple up into very small pieces to fill in the spaces between the large slices so they cook down into a nice gooey apple filling."
"0","5","Tastes wonderful! Only suggestion and reminder for next time is to use less water. Prob half of what it calls for."
"0","5","A+ The expert pie bakers in my family loved this. I used Granny Smith apples so not overly sweet. Added nutmeg to cinnamon sugar mix, left out water, and added pecans to crisp topping as suggested in other reviews - perfect. Also made this in glass pie dish with apple's piled high like a regular pie - came out perfectly with no bubble over at all. Also used same recipe to make a rhubarb version - perfectly tart. Small peach version is in oven now."
"0","5","i loved this apple crisp i did leave out the water because ran out of sticks of butter so i measured i cup o butter and i added a little too much so i'm glad i did"
"0","5","This is the best!! I made the recipe by doubling the crumble topping and adding about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg over the top of the apples. Delicious!! Also, since my family and I prefer a more crispy crumble topping, I put my oven on broil for about a minute before I took the crisp out. It turned out perfect, I will for sure use this recipe many times again in the future(:"
"0","5","Great recipe! I read the other reviews and opted to not add water, this was a good call. When I was peeling and slicing the apples I just put them in water so they didn't get brown. I drained the water and what was left on the apples was plenty. I also added the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg recommend by another review. ??"
"0","5","I love apple pie and this was a close second. I used the onion chopper to make the apples into large cubes then baked as usual. the whole family loved it. I saved this one for sure!"
"0","4","This apple crisp is great! The only thing I would change would be the amount of sugar. I found it a bit too sugary for MY taste. Other then that, give it a go!"
"0","5","I have made several apple crisp recipes but this is the best! I made it as written and its perfect. Thank you, my family loved it."
"0","5","very good, i usually make it like a pie. lay apple slices, nd crumble crumble over it:D"
"0","4","This is very comforting, We topped ours with vanilla bean ice-cream"
"0","5","delicious and worth the prep time!"
"0","5","I cooked the apple mixture on the stove before adding the crumble mixture and placing it in the oven. Pie has a lot of liquid and next time I'm going to omit the water. It is very good and yes we did have it warm with ice cream. Yummy."
"0","5","I have made this recipe over and over again and people love it. I follow it almost to the T. The only thing I substitute is oil instead of butter and guess what? Its awesome! I can definetely reccommend this."
"0","5","This was very very easy and delicious!!"
"0","4","Great taste. I reduced the white sugar a bit to increase the apple flavor."
"0","5","Delicious! Even better if served with vanilla ice cream. :)"
"0","5","My favorite!"
"0","5","my favorite, especially when your apples get a little to ripe!"
"0","5","Don't do what I did...forgot the ice cream :( and bake and eat it early in the day, not @10:00 PM at night. Easy peasy recipe and so delish. I reduced my white sugar to 1/4 cup but everything else much as per the recipe. Still delicious in the end."
"0","5","It was great! Thanks!"
"0","5","I read some reviewers suggestions and used 1/4 cup of water and doubled the crumble topping and got rave reviews from co-workers at our office pot luck. This is very sweet but is amazingly good. I will definitely be making this again. Loved it!"
"0","5","Excellent Apple Crisp did recipe as written you wont regret it ."
"0","5","I have been cooking too long to measure anything, but used this recipe as a guideline. It's a great foundation recipe once it's tweaked to your taste, and I concur, WAY too much sugar in the original, but still a winner!"
"0","5","I have been making apple crisp for 40 years and this is the best recipe. I too left out the water and doubled the crust and used real butter. I did not melt butter just cut it up coarsely. It stayed crisp or many days until the last mouthful."
"0","5","This is like eating an apple pie..but soooooooo much easier! This is a favorite! Thanks!"
"0","5","Made this once and we all liked it! Better than other crisp recipes I've tried. When I asked my husband after this if he wanted apple crisp or pie he chose the crisp!"
"0","5","This is the recipe I needed! Delicious!"
"0","4","A decent apple crisp. I used a little less sugar. The rest of the recipe is similar to my original (which I don't measure out). I think this is a good recipe for beginners."
"0","5","I made this last night for my family and it was a big hit with everyone. I made a smaller amount, using a pie pan... so for the filling, I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and the water to 1/3 cup (I also used older 'gala' apples 'on their last leg'). For the crumble topping, I reduced the amount of oatmeal, flour, & brown sugar to 3/4 cup each. I had a lot of crumble topping which was good (at least 1/2' thick crumble crisp fully covered the top of pie). The apple crisp was still a bit too sweet, which my son thought was wonderful. I should have reduced the sugars a bit more, especially since I used 'gala' apples - they are already sweet. Next time, if I'm using 'gala' apples and cooking the same amount, I'll further reduce both the white sugar used in filling and the brown sugar used in crumble topping, to 1/2 cup each. It will still taste sweetly yummy and I doubt my son will notice the difference. We ate it as it was...no ice cream and it was delicious. I have no doubt it will be a fabulous taste treat when eaten with vanilla ice cream. I plan to make it again and eat it with ice cream soon. This recipe is a 'keeper'. I don't need look for another apple crisp recipe version."
"0","5","WONDERFUL!! My family asks me to make this every yr for the holidays. Its so great! The only thing I change was that I put in extra vanilla... about twice as much. We just like vanilla around here. Will be holding on to this recipe for the holidays!"
"0","4","This recipe was delicious, just a little too sweet. I would cut down the sugar the next time."
"0","5","I have made this recipe every time i want apple crisp and it is amazing everytime! Love it!"
"0","5","Turned out amazing!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe, it was very tasty & the perfect amount of sweetness. I used Granny Smith Apples & added a lil nutmeg to my mixture & that was the only change I made. 2 Thumbs Way Up!"
"0","5","This is now our standard apple/fruit crisp recipe. It is the right level of sweetness and you can play with the sweetness for your own palate. The main reason though that I like it, is that the crisp is dead easy to put together. Not that blending with a pastry blender is difficult but its one more tool. Plus, the crisp always brown beautifully, and stays on top of the crisp. From start to oven its about 15 minutes. I add a little bit of cinnamon in the crisp part from time to time. Some people say skip the water, but for my kids they like the sauce it makes way better than without the water. Great recipe."
"0","5","Best apple crisp I've ever made and I've made hundreds"
"0","5","Thank you, Diane, for such a great recipe! I had a bowl of a Granny Smiths that were becoming a bit too ripe - had all the ingredients for this on hand, and vanilla ice cream in the freezer, to boot! YUM! Do not change a thing! Perfect, as is! Hardest part was peeling all of the apples. Well worth it! I will be making this one often!"
"0","5","Always gone within 24 hours!"
"0","4","This is a great recipe, but way too sweet. I used granny smith apples and the 1 cup of sugar that you mix with the apples is too much. Next time I'll cut it in half or maybe down to a 1/4 cup. I added 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 and it was perfect. Also, I followed other reviews and doubled the topping, but it made so much that I didn't add it all. I think I added about 1.5 times the topping and even that was a little thick. I will definitely make this again. Delish!"
"0","5","This was delicious! My husband said it was the best crisp he's ever eaten. I served it with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Omg!!! I made this this morning for the kids and it is absolutely amazing!!! Best I've ever had. I 'tweaked' the recipe a little. I added nutmeg and mixed it into the sugar mixture then tossed the apples in it. I also doubled the topping and added crushed almonds. Instead of the water I used unsweetened Apple juice. It came out so good. I well deff make this again."
"0","5","Went apple picking with my family a couple of weeks ago and brought home over 20lb of apples... :) Needed a recipe that uses up a lot of apples. Naturally, apple crisp came to mind. Found this one and made it pretty much to a T except for cutting the amount of white sugar in half- my apples were Golden Delicious and quite sweet on their own. It came out fabulous! Made some vanilla ice cream to go with the crisp and my family was raving! Definitely a keeper! Thanks so much for sharing!"
"0","5","Perfect hot out of the oven served with vanilla ice cream! It's one of our favorites - love the crunchiness!"
"0","5","One word: yummmmm"
"0","5","we followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. my whole family loved it."
"0","4","Followed recipe exactly for Halloween dessert. It's really sweet. I'll make it again but definitely reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup over apples."
"0","5","Made this for my family. Everyone asked for seconds. The only thing I did differently was use brown sugar instead of white. And had some fresh oranges that I didn't want to go bad so I used them instead of water."
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice now and it has been a great hit at both parties. The water is something I normally don't put in a crisp, but it made the crisp nice juicy, DELICIOUS !!!!"
"0","1","Way too much sugar! I did exactly every step this recipe listed, and it came out entirely too sweet! 1 full cup of sugar including 1 cup of brown sugar is way too much."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","4","I think i msy have put too much water because it was a bit chewier than expected but overall taste is delicious. I used McIntosh apples."
"0","5","I haven't had apple crisp in years. So I saw this recipe and made it for dessert. It was simple to prepare and baked it while everyone was having dinner. It came out great and everyone enjoyed it. Definitely making it again. Thanks for posting the recipe, keeper."
"0","4","AMAZING! But waaaaay to sweet, I even reduced the sugar but it was still a little sickening :) will definitely make again, but will reduce the sugar even more."
"0","5","This was a last minute recipe and it was fabulous!!! I will be keeping this one on hand..."
"0","1","I shouldn't have added the water. It didn't need it. Made it too mushy."
"0","5","Delish, even my husband loved it , every year we Apple pick and he picks in me saying. Oh it's Apple mush time :-) not this year it was fabulous.  The only thing I changed was I doubled the crisp, not the apple part and I also didn't add water because I added my apple mixture and then let the apple just sit for 3 hours."
"0","5","Great recipe! It was easy, super yummy AND my entire family loved it!"
"0","5","I made it with half Bartlett pear and half Granny Smith apple which was a nice mix of tart and sweet. I left out the water and sugar from the fruit part and halved the sugar from the topping. (I used brown sugar as well). Even with that I found it a tad too sweet but that's just my personal taste. My boyfriend found the sweetness level to be just fine and suggested some corn starch or arrowroot in the fruit mixture to make it less watery. I also added a little bit of shredded coconut and cinnamon to the topping. It might have been less watery if I used just apples. It's a good recipe though. I will make it again!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe and I think this is the best apple crisp I've ever made. Perfect as it is."
"0","5","Very good! Good ratios and it seems to work every time. Follow the recipe and you will have a great apple crisp. Use the same topping for other fruit crisps; it works out great."
"0","5","Fantastic! This is my new go to recipe for apple crisp. I, too, omitted the water and used brown sugar instead of white since I never use white sugar. Next time, I will cut down on the amount of sugar with the apples as it was a bit sweeter than I like, but it is super yummy! Guilty secret: the leftovers are incredible the next day heated up with cream for breakfast!"
"0","5","good recipe, everybody loves it! will make it again!"
"0","2","TOO SWEET!!!"
"0","5","I made the recipe just like it said to. I thought it was really good! I do think the next time I make it I will make sure to use granny smith apples. I used sun crisp apples and it was still good,but with all the sugar a crisp tart apple would be better. I would also double the topping,only use 1/4cup water. Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Game day dessert (GO HAWKS )2nd time making it! Family loves it. Taste like our old family recipe!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious"
"0","5","Devine! I love apple crisp. This by far is the best! I changed nothing and loved it. Thank you Diane Kester!"
"0","5","Pretty good :) I did put some vanilla in the recipe :) perfecto"
"0","5","This was amazingly simple to make and it was a HUGE hit with my family!! I'll definitely be using this recipe a lot this fall! Ala mode is the perfect way to enjoy this.. love it!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is definitely a keeper. I have never made apple crisp before and was not disappointed. The topping was so crunchy and delicious. I would definitely reduce the amount of white sugar by half next time around. It was super sweet and I am not a big fan of very sweet but that is a personal preference of mine. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy delicious apple crisp."
"0","5","Made it yesterday for a dinner with friends and it turned out great! I even forgot to put the water in it, but served with cream on top and vanilla ice cream it was delicious. Great and simple recipe!"
"0","4","Very good but way too sweet."
"0","5","I made this to bring to my parents anniversary party and it was a big hit! Everyone raved about how delicious it was. I used Granny Smith Apples and followed the recipe as stated but chose to add chopped walnuts to it as well for extra crunch. Very delicious! :)"
"0","5","Amazing!!!"
"0","5","This is fantastic! I use this recipe every time I make apple crisp! The only changes I made is I double the topping and use apple cider instead of water on the apples"
"0","4","Delicious recipe. Great to have apple crisp in the fall."
"0","5","Loved it ! Perfect just as is  The crust was right amount and super delicious and the filling was perfect  Definitely will be making this again !"
"0","5","It is so simple to make, my little kid helped me (and snuck pieces of the apple and the crumble). And it is quite delicious!"
"0","5","Amazing! The pan only lasted a day and a half! Only thing I will do different next time would be to melt more butter for the topping."
"0","5","This is fantastic I am a young chef only 13 and I love sweets. This was the best for my sweet tooth"
"0","5","This recipe is the bomb! Quick and Easy to follow!"
"0","5","I could hardly wait for it to cool down to try it! I'm not even sure I want to share this big pan!"
"0","5","We made this with honey crisp apples and it was tart and perfect. However, I used 1/4 cup water and will omit all the water next time."
"0","3","I've made apple crisp for years and never had one call for water of any kind til this one. I gave it a go even though I had my doubts about adding water considering apples tend to bring their own juices once it starts cooking. Well, I made it and as I figured too much water! To be honest, there really isn't any need to add water when your using juicy apples. Oh well, it still was good just a lil soggy."
"0","5","This is the best recipe!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe to the T and it is incredible. The only thing I did different was add a scoop of butter pecan ice cream on top while it was still warm.....heavenly!! Thank you so much-this is a definite keeper!"
"0","5","This is sooo delicious!!"
"0","5","Holy apple!!! This was the best apple crisp I've had in a long time!"
"0","5","This was awesome will defiantly make again"
"0","5","This was sooo delicious. I took the advice from the other reviews and I didn't eliminate the water...but i only used a sprinkle...just to kinda wet the apples a tad...i cut the sugar and used granny smith apples...the crust was really hard to 'crumble over the apples' I kinda had to smear it as it was really moist...idk if that was my fault or the recipe...LOL. but it was good. will make again"
"0","5","I've made this 5-6 times since saving. It's perfect and comes out the same every time. Great recipe!!"
"0","5","Substituted stevia for the white sugar and brown sugar with stevia blend for the brown sugar just because we are trying to cut down our refined sugar intake. Still came out perfect!"
"0","4","I liked the recipe but it was too sweet. I used the granny smiths green baking apples and it still was too sweet. Next time instead of using 1 cup of sugar I will try 1/2 cup of sugar. I used 1/2 cup of water as the directions specified and it was great...not too watery. This dessert was good with vanilla icecream which helped cut out some of the sweetness...I doubled the topping and it was delicious!"
"0","5","I made this tonight and it is fabulous! Only thing I changed was cutting the serving size by half and made it in a glass pie plate. I cut down cooking time by a few minutes (cause I forgot to set the timer so I had to wing it a bit). Nom Nom"
"0","4","Apples must be sliced thin...."
"0","5","awesome! Some people say omit water, some - just cut in half; it dependence on apples, my was quiet dry so water was require; other than that excellent recipe!"
"0","5","Tried this last night in order to use up a bunch of eating apples of different varieties (gala, lady pink, etc). This was fantastic! It tasted super sweet, likely due to the type of apple we used, but it was great regardless.  We cut the water in half and doubled the topping, both excellent suggestions. If using sweet apples, you may want to cut back the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2.  Thanks!"
"0","5","Making with a variety of baking apples gives this crisp a great flavor. Family and friends always enjoy eating it."
"0","4","Be sure to add nutmeg!! Also, I have someone that doesn't like rolled oats, so substituted for Rice Krispies (glutten free) and works VERY nicely. Lightens up thetopping as well, not so heavy! Had family matriarchs asking for the recipe!"
"0","5","This was my Grandmother's recipe! Yum!!! Love to eat alone or over ice cream."
"0","4","Tried it last night - it was excellent. However I halved the amount of white and brown sugar - nobody needs 2 cups of sugar! :) I did not use water and I added 1/3 teaspoon dried cloves. Delicious."
"0","5","Delicious! I made a few sight changes. 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2. I tossed to the apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture first. I also added nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture as well as cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. also instead of melting the butter for the topping I cut the butter in, which made talking mmore crumbly."
"0","5","Made this last night for dessert and everyone loved it. I followed directions EXACTLY and I wouldn't change a thing."
"0","5","This turned out great! I used granny smith apples, cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and water to 1/4 cup. I followed someone's advise to toss the apple slices in cinnamon & sugar mixture. I doubled the topping so that I could have a double crust and it was fantastic!"
"0","2","I used 9 small granny smith apples. I followed most of the recipe directions, except: I coated the apples in the sugar mixture; and, since so many people recommended it and I had one less apple, I lowered the water amount to 1/4 cup. I was so excited to try this, but it ended up being overpowered with sugar. I felt like I was eating sugar with a side of apple. It may have been because I had one less apple, and they were small....but, IF I were to ever make this again, I would cut the sugar on the apples AND the topping down to 1/2 cup each...maybe add some more flour to the topping to replace the sugar. I don't understand why some people are recommending to double the topping...gag!"
"0","5","AMAZING!!! I made this a few hours before i baked it so i used 1/4cup lemon juice instead of water (cut back to 1/4 cup like other reviewers said) and added nutmeg, and used granny Smith Apples. It turned out great, and was a huge hit our our family get together. Next time I will cut back on the sugar, it was super sweet but still amazing! This is a keeper for sure!"
"0","5","Delicious! I made it as followed on the recipe except I lowered the water to 1/4 cup and it actually came out a tad dry, so next time I think I'm going to make sure I add the 1/2 cup as stated on the recipe. I used Granny Smith apples and I cut in cold butter for the topping because I like my topping kind of crunchy. Taste so yummy thanks Diane Kester for the recipe :)"
"0","4","This tasted great...i do have a couple of suggestions though. Double the topping and either eliminate the water or add cornstarch to thicken or it will be a little watery."
"0","5","Oh.my.YUM! I have made others,this is the best! I made exactly as recipe is written, using granny Smith apples, and the water. Not runny at all. Thank you!"
"0","5","I used and peeled about 10 cups of red delicious apples ( I think it was about 6 apples total?). I did what some other people recommended and cut down the amount of sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and also added a pinch of nutmeg to the first mix. I also only poured 1/4 cup of water over the apple mixture, and when I pulled it out, I still feel like it was slightly to watery for my taste, but the leftovers may 'gunk up' and it tastes great either way! I would have loved to try adding pecans or some other nut to the topping mixture but I didn't have any, but will try next time :)"
"0","5","I had some apples in the fridge that needed to be used and I had been looking for an apple crumble recipe forever. This was the one! I read through all the comments before making it. I make apple pies all the time so I also varied a little with that. I halved the water and added a little nutmeg and it was perfect. My 10 year old daughter who I thought may not like it said 'It was to die for'"
"0","4","I've tried for Thansgiven dinner on 2013. It was easy to com and got very good. Although i'd like it more crisp!"
"0","5","Excellent and easy! Be sure to add just a little water at the end, and slice up a pat of butter onto the top before putting into oven. The topping on the top and bottom is amazing!"
"0","5","Sooo very delicious!! Will be making this again :)!"
"0","3","This crisp was okay. I don't understand why you are supposed to add water. My crisp turned out soupy. I also added more cinnamon on top of the apples and I also added cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture that went on top"
"0","3","Good recipe- love the topping, but overall it was too sweet for my taste. I would cut the white sugar at least by a 1/4 cup, if not half."
"0","4","Delicious but a bit sweet for my taste. I may have not used enough apples. Either way I'll be making it again with less sugar! Also, eating the leftovers on top of oatmeal for breakfast = yummy!!"
"0","5","Pretty standard recipe for Apple crisp. Was very tasty."
"0","5","Awesome! My 15-year-old son has made this twice, and the whole family LOVES it. No changes to the recipe at all - perfect as is (and delicious with vanilla ice cream)!"
"0","4","Excellent although I add 1 tsp on cinnamon to the topping and a 1/2 cup of water is way to much it makes it way to runny you need to cut it back to a 1/4 cup or less due to the apples cooking down."
"0","5","I made this for my work Christmas lunch and it got devoured. I doubled the crust recipe like everyone suggested and left out the water. I'm saving this recipe forever."
"0","4","This apple crisp was good, but i went in with the intention that it would taste similiar to apple pie. This is a much DRIER version, hence the word 'Crisp'. If you're looking for something more cruncy and chewy, than this recipe is fine. It's also much easier to make than apple pie. I actually used all the water advised, and almost wish I used more since I wanted more moisture. I'd rather stick to apple pie, but this wasn't bad."
"0","5","I made this for my family a while ago and it turned out amazingly!!"
"0","5","Absolutely the best apple crisp my family has ever ate! It was gone in 30 minutes."
"0","2","Apple Crisps are a favorite in our home but it was almost unanimous that this particular recipe was entirely too sweet. Even my 12 year old boy said he couldn't eat it because it was so sweet. Reduce the sugars and I am sure it will be good. This had a great flavor and that was our only qualm about it."
"0","5","This was very good! I used Granny Smith apples. I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","So yummy! Had a lot of apples to use up, and this was delicious! We used peeled Junami apples, and I just used the coring/slicing tool that I keep to cut apples for my toddler, so the slices were thick, but wonderful. The only change that I'd make next time would be to either cut or eliminate the water. The apples cook down on their own, so we had quite a lot of sauce at the bottom when baked. If I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go ahead and add nutmeg like reviewers are talking about, but the recipe is really delicious on its own."
"0","5","Scrumptious. I did double the topping and next time might add some chopped pecans to take it to a new level, but it is divine as stated."
"0","5","Made this recipe several times now. Great for Rosh Hashanah. Everyone always loves it. There's never any leftovers. I double the topping."
"0","4","I love the sweetness of this dish. Someone else said it was too sweet. Um, it's a dessert! Instead of the water someone said to cut, I added pink moscato wine and it was a lovely addition. I also thought that the crumble wasn't enough, so I added more to cover the dish towards the end and it added some crunch from the dry oats that was really good."
"0","5","Yummy!"
"0","2","The flavor is fine. I suggest you DO NOT ADD WATER. I only added 1/3 cup; it made this watery and the apples too soft.   To make a flavorful mix, I always use Winesap or stayman and Granny Smiths in combination. I also mix the cinn/sugar/flour with the apples, and add nutmeg. Add cold butter, cubing it into small cube and cut it into the topping.   If I didn't have to tailor this recipe so much, I would have rated it higher. It is a good start, but truly, fruit crisps are relatively hard to mess up."
"0","5","Really yummy. Doubled the crumble pastry part. Served w/vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Well, I altered it by leaving out the cup of sugar poured over the apples... and it was still amazing. SO good! Brought it camping and actually took home leftover because it was too good to just throw away with the other camping yuckies! Cut the sugar, though! Making it again for Thanksgiving... right now!"
"0","5","Made this last night for an early Thanksgiving celebration...it was amazing! My guests ate this over the 2 home made pumpkin pies! I put it in the often as everyone sat down to eat, and it was hot and crispy when it was dessert time. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Awesome! I always double topping, add more apples and squeeze a whole small lemon over apples for tartness. Best recipe!"
"0","5","The best ever!! I use 11 Granny Smith's apples (no subs) without the water and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also mix the flour mixture in with the sliced apples prior to placing in the 9x13 pan. Then double the crust recipe. It is easier to dump the crust mixture onto the middle of the pan of apples and gently spread out to the edges and pat down. The pan will be heaping, but the apples will cook down so the finished product is level. I get begged to make this and everyone says it's the best they've ever had. For a special treat serve with Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel ice cream topping and vanilla ice cream. Thanks Diane!!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is sooooooo good! I added walnuts as well!!!!! yum!"
"0","5","I'm not a baker so this was so easy even I could I Make it delicious! Enjoy!"
"0","5","Apple crisp is a favorite in our house and this is by far the best recipe I have made out of many. I don't need to try any more!"
"0","5","Wonderful!"
"0","5","Super easy - Super awesome. You can use any fruit too - Last night I made it with apple, pear and mango! It was awesome (and finished quickly!)"
"0","5","I followed the recipes exactly, including the water addition and it turned out amazing! I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it. It was coined the 'winner'. The pan was clean in about 10 minutes setting on a table of about 7 other desserts. I brought salted caramel ice cream, whipped cream, and homemade toffee sauce to top it. Most people didn't fully indulge because it didn't need it. ...but I did:) So GOOD!"
"0","5","LOVE this recipe!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe a dozen times and everyone loves it. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","Other than the fact I forgot to peel the apples, it was good!"
"0","5","This was super easy and tasty!"
"0","5","I've made this twice now, and it has been well received both times. My brother in law is an avid apple crisp addict, so this was very popular with him. I didn't change the recipe at all, though I think adding raisins would be an optional variety."
"0","3","Overall really tasty, but don't trust any recipe that doesn't require you to grease the pan first! I assumed the butter and water would compensate, but I was wrong and the edges were really black after just 30 minutes in the oven."
"0","5","Excellent recipe."
"0","4","Must eat warm and with wipped cream. Topping is a bit hard."
"0","4","I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9X9 glass dish. I used 2tbs of water instead of 1/4 cup and I think that was still too much water. I also used about 3/4 cup sugar and a dash of nutmeg to the apples. I'm not sure I would make this again. I think it was edible but I may just be a pie person. Update (half recipe): I've made this several times and settled on a few minor changes which make this recipe 5 stars. I used a little more than 2/3 cups of sugar (half brown and white). I used 1tsp of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of flour, dash of nutmeg, dash of salt and no water. One of the big keys of this receipe is to let the crisp cool before eating. If you won't wait, all of the juices will run out with the first 'slice.' Update 3: I melted the 1/2 cup butter and added 3 heaping tablespoons of flour. I cooked the mixture for 5 or so minutes, stirring constantly (don't let it brown). I then added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar. Mixture will form a paste. I then added 2 tablespoons of water. I brought the mixture to a boil, lowered the heat and continued until the mixture became syrup/thick. I also added the apples and cooked until the mixture was thick again (5 or so minutes). I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 dashes of nutmeg. I baked the pie at 400 for 30-45 minutes. Allowed the crisp to cool for 15 minutes."
"0","5","What's not to love about this?? It was simply amazing. Not one bite leftover. I only used half the amount of water and it came out perfect, not too dry or too watery. Next time I will double the crust and add it to the top and bottom because the crust is my favorite part. Make sure to use crisp, sour apples. Otherwise it will be too sweet and mushy. We served it with vanilla ice cream and it was perfect."
"0","5","all i can say wow i loved and i will make it again"
"0","5","Great recipe. I made a few modifications: I cut all the sugars by half and used half whole wheat flour with half white flour. I also used half the amount of water as others have suggested. And for a 9x13' pan you want to one and a half or double the topping ingredients. I definitely will make it again."
"0","4","Great flavor, easy to whip up. Felt the topping was a little heavy, would have preferred something lighter. Otherwise delicious!"
"0","5","Delicious recipe; we tripled it for a get - together and it was a big hit"
"0","5","No wonder this has 3,500 reviews. Excellent. I made it as listed. My husband loved it (had 3 servings), the family loved it, the neighbors loved it. What a nice fall treat!. I baked it at 325 for an hour and then turned the oven off and left it in there. It was perfect. Served it with vanilla ice-cream. PERFECT!"
"0","4","It was a little too sweet with the full sugar. i might try to reduce that next time.   only sprinkled water over apples. i think it would have been too soggy with a full cup.  i will make it again."
"0","5","fantastic, easy, and very tasty!"
"0","5","Made this recipe exactly as printed. It's wonderful!! My husband is a picky one and he loved it. Quick and simple to make. Great with fresh whipped cream while still warm. Yummy!!"
"0","5","Instead of doubling the topping as suggested in other reviews, I made 1 1/2 batch of the topping. Very good!"
"0","5","Perfect dish warmed up served with some ice cream on top. This is the best apple crisp I have ever had. Making it again tonight!"
"0","5","YUMMERS! I made this for my family (made the house smell AMAZING btw) and when they got home they gobbled half the pan for their afternoon snack and were begging for more after supper. Needless to say, they polished the rest off! Followed the recipe exactly as is and I have no adjustments to make to this one. I scribbled it onto an index and it has a permanant home in my recipe collection. I will definately be maaking this crisp over and over again!!"
"0","5","This is a really great recipe... Loved it and so did friends n fam. Deff recommend it to all"
"0","5","Best apple crisp recipe I have found not dry like some others I have tried."
"0","5","This was great! I wanted to make a smaller portion in an 8x8 pan, so I halved the first ingredients (apples/cinnamon/sugar/flour), but used the full quantities for the crumble ingredients. Baked for 40 minutes at 350. My little apple pie fan now says this is better than apple pie!"
"0","5","do not add the water. mix the apples into the cinnamon mixture. add a dash of nutmeg. topping: 1 1/2 this part. I have made this by putting all dry cinnamon ing together in a big ziploc. put oats & dry ingr in a different ziploc. peel & slice apples ahead and place inwater & lemon juice. they will not brown!! you can throw together, melt butter and bake fresh easily. family loves this dessert!!! wonderful"
"0","1","This recipe is not good I will not make this again. It may be because I followed others advice to double the topping and lower the amount of water and mixed in the sugar cinnamon mix. The topping was way too dry and loose, definetly not a 'crisp'"
"0","5","I also skipped the water, but substituted 1/4 c of pure apple cider. Kicked it up a notch!"
"0","5","For those who find it too watery mix a little cornstarch with water and add the apples. When baking it will be perfect as the cornstarch will thicken the liquid"
"0","4","I had to scale this down as I only had 3 apples. Like others, I did not bake this with water in it. Instead I put the apples in water to avoid browning until I was done preparing them. I also doubled the topping (from the scaled version it ended up as the recipe states). I eyeballed the cinnamon, and I'm sure it was more, but not by much. I think I'd add a bit more next time and reduce the sugar, otherwise this was very good. The kids and the husband loved it."
"0","5","Everyone loved it! I tried skipping the water as another reviewer suggested but it was tooooooo dry. Not the recipes fault at all because it was still yummy!"
"0","5","So good and easy! We added a small amount of nutmeg and omitted the water."
"0","5","Excellent! I used 5 granny smith and 5 jonathan apples. I decreased the water to 1/4 cup per other reviews - that is the only change I made. It turned out fantastic!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!!! Will be making this again! Kids LOVED it, I loved it and I didn't change a thing about this recipe!!!"
"0","5","This is by far one of the best recipes I have found on here- and one of the only ones I have not had to 'tweak'. I used assorted types of apples that we had from apple picking, and used the recommended amount of water as well. I did not double the topping ingredients as many people have recommended, and am glad I did not because it would have been too much for our taste. I would recommend a more tart apple, or to decrease the white sugar if you are using a sweeter apple. Serve with some real vanilla ice cream and enjoy!"
"0","5","This is an absolutely delicious recipe! I've made it in a 9X9 and a casserole dish, and it was great either way. It could be renamed, 'Vanishing Apple Crisp,' because that is EXACTLY what it does here. THIS is now my apple crisp recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is perfect as written, but after reading other reviews, I decided I should double the crumble and add a layer to the bottom. Definitely don't regret it, but it came out really sweet! So to remedy this, I'm putting a dollop of vanilla yogourt when serving it because it adds a tangy creaminess that balances the sugar very, very well."
"0","5","Awesome. Not too sweet. Just right."
"0","5","Wholly guacamole!!! This was wonderful!! I only changed one thing! I used vegan butter to make this vegan friendly for a friend. I will be making again very soon!!!!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!!"
"0","5","So good! The topping is like an oatmeal cookie! Yum"
"0","5","TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!! It was so good. though I would cut down on the oats...I would do half a cup"
"0","3","This crisp was, at first bite, pretty good. My apples remained firm and the crisp was initially tasty. But after a couple of bites, my company and I all thought that it lacked flavor. The dish was overwhelmingly sweet and didn't seem to have a lot of spice. If I were to make this again, I'd add more cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe a hint of clove and allspice. I'd also use light or dark brown sugar in place of the white sugar called for tossing the apples. I did double the crisp as most reviewers suggested, and I definitely would not do that again. We all felt that it turned into a crisp with apples, rather than the other way around. The proportions as written would have been good for us. It otherwise felt like we were eating butter and sugar and flour and butter. This wasn't terrible; my guests ate it and were pleased to have a dessert made with freshly picked apples. But I'd have to make a lot of adjustments if I were to make it again."
"0","5","I loved it...taste really good."
"0","5","Excellent recipe, Thank you!"
"0","5","My family's favorite recipe!!"
"0","5","Really good. I used granny smith apples like I usually do for pie but I think I would prefer a sweeter baking apple such as a Mcintosh but our grocery store didn't have any. Almost too much tart vs sweet. I did double the topping just because it's so good. My daughter thought 1 1/2 times the topping would have been suffiicient."
"0","5","Fantastic!!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe as is! My only problem is that between the hubby and the kids I don't get much. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","I just made this recipe last night--it was really good, but I think there are better recipes."
"0","5","Very good. I baked mine for over an hour & it still wasn't quite done in the center so next time I may saute the apple mixture for 5 minutes or so. Also it's very sweet, so I'll reduce both sugars by at least 25%. But it's still delicious this time, thanks to Ms. Kester for posting."
"0","5","This was gobbled up in minutes! Excellent dessert! I reduced the recipe from 12 to 6 servings using a 9x9 glass dish. Mainly because my 9x13 was in the dishwasher :). I had to substitute the flour with almond flour and left out the baking powder because I had neither on hand for the topping, which I also doubled and added to the bottom of the dish. I also used coconut flour mixed with the sugar and cinnamon to coat the apples. Absolutely delicious!!"
"0","5","Perfect apple crisp! With or without ice cream."
"0","5","Yum yum! This is so good straight out of the oven with caramel ice cream! I swapped out the water for apple cider and did cut the liquid down a bit as others suggested. Added a pinch of dried lemon peel and a pinch of sea salt; instead of cinnamon, I used apple pie spice. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Amazing! I made individual Apple Crisps by putting the apple filling into store bought tart shells, then topping each with the oat mixture and baking for 55 minutes! Soooo awesome!"
"0","5","This was simply delicious. I made this apple crisp for thanksgiving as a surprise dessert, and everyone loved it! I did, too. I have noticed a lot of people saying that you should not put as much water in as the recipe says, but I did, and i thought it was still super good. I really recommend this as a seasonal celebration dessert, but it would taste just as well at a casual dinner party! Really great recipe!"
"0","3","I gave it 3 stars because good apples should not be peeled because that is important to eat the skin for good fiber and health; also, way, way too much sugar. If you use a good mix of sweet and sour baking apples very little sugar is needed especially if it is topped with ice cream. Taste test the apple mixture before adding any sugar and lemon juice and cut the sugar in half for the crust. Top with toasted nuts and vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! I would have added a little less water but other than that 5 stars will make again."
"0","4","I thought this was a great recipe, but I give it a 4 because I adjusted it according to other review comments. I omitted the water and made 1 1/2 times the topping. It's not soupy, but not dry at all, and the tart firm apples come through perfectly."
"0","5","Sooooooo good. Even better after it cools and sets up more."
"0","5","Best ever! I like to use apple cinnamon oatmeal rather than just plain oatmeal. Cutting back on the water is a good idea too. But delicious!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe on Friday. Used Granny Smith, turbinado sugar, added nutmeg and cardomon. Fabulous and easy. I also cooked it longer so it was really bubbly and had a crispy top."
"0","5","yummy. yummy. yummy"
"0","4","Made recipe exactly as written, tasted great! We all kept going back for just one more bite! Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","Very good but use much less white sugar."
"0","4","I left out the water, mixed the sugar and cinnamon with the apples and cooked it an extra 5 minutes. It was crispy and good but I probably will cut the sugar by half the next time I make this."
"0","4","I just made this. The texture of the topping was perfect. Plus using melted butter made it very simple. Next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar though. It's way too sweet for me, even with the Granny Smith apples."
"0","5","Takes time to cut those apples up! I used only 6, not 10 apples (would have been way too much for me). But it turns out great and had it with vanilla ice cream even better"
"0","5","My girls loved it!!! Thanks for the recipe!! ;)"
"0","3","as it did taste delish, i halved the sugar content and it was still too syrupy... I would recommend pressing the cinnamon and flour into the butter, brown sugar and oats, but add some more flour or mill some oats to flour to help it all stick together better and come to a crisp, crusty texture."
"0","4","While the recipe was delicious, it is a bit sweet. I guess it depends on the type of apples you use, but I would definitely cut the sugar in the apples back by half. I also like my apples a little more cooked than this so I would add another 5 minutes. And the key to thicker consistency is letting it sit for 10 minutes after removing from the oven. I know, CRAZY! Who can watch a hot apple crisp for 10 minutes without eating it. Trust me, it's worth the wait."
"0","5","Delicious! I maybe shouldn't rate this five stars b/c I did alter it ever so slightly. I almost halved the white sugar and gently packed the brown sugar. It was plenty since I used Fuji apples. Also, I added much less water, merely a heavy sprinkling and it was quite watery. I would skip the water next time. So easy and delicious. *must be eaten warm out of the oven served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. yum!"
"0","3","Having never made apple crisp before, I thought this was pretty good. I think I could have left the water out, as apples are naturally full of water. The topping was a bit bland, and its' texture was too chewy. Next time I would season the crumble part with additional cinnamon, and a dash of salt. I might even leave out the oats in favor of walnuts."
"0","5","This was great. I skipped the water and the apples were still juicy...I think it would have been too soupy with the water. Crumb topping is really good on this and everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","very good , I added nutmeg.....yum um"
"0","5","I make this dish every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, it almost never makes it to the next day. It's one of those dishes you want to make the day before you serve it so its nice and thick and wonderful, then heat it up 20 minutes before you serve it. I do go a little above what the recipe calls for with the cinnamon though, you can never over do cinnamon."
"0","4","A very easy recipe with very good results, but it's a bit sweeter than I would like. The apples and sugar caramelized beautifully, the topping is crumbly and nice... but yeah, this makes a really, really sweet dessert. I might try tweaking it with less sugar, or by tossing the apples in some lemon juice."
"0","5","delicious!!"
"0","5","Made this recipe tonight. After reading some reviews, I also altered the ingredients. I used 13 fugi apples. I changed 1 cup of white sugar to 3/4 cup, and changed 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to one tablespoon. I followed and used the rest of the ingredients as noted. Before I placed the cut up apples in the 9 by 13 inch pan; I put the apples in a zip lock bag. I mixed the white sugar, cinnamon, and flour together and added 3/4 of the mixture to the ziplock bag. I closed the bag and shook it to make sure the apples were coated with the mixture. I then put the apples in the baking pan and sprinkled the rest of the mixture over the apples. I then made the crumb topping as directed and baked it. ( I was a little concerned with the amount of water, but stuck to the original ingredients). Yes, it was watery.....but, we are a small family and do have left overs. The water will keep this apple crisp moist when re-heating it another day. This is a magnificent tasting apple crisp! I will definitely make this again!  Donna Lynn"
"0","5","Delicious! I used a combination of Granny Smith and pink lady apples and skipped the water."
"0","5","This is the perfect apple crisp recipe, I won't use anything else now. The only thing that needs changing is the topping. Once doubled it is the perfect amount. I also added some allspice to the apples as a personal preference. My family loves this apple crisp, never any leftover."
"0","5","I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and I got amazing reviews! My husband says it is the best apple crisp I have ever made. I love how easy it was to make. I followed all of the instructions except that my oven had it ready in only 30 minutes. I also added sliced almonds to the topping and maybe sometime I will try walnuts. This will now be my go-to apple crisp recipe."
"0","5","Delicious. Made it just like recipe except I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg."
"0","5","The easiest recipe I've ever tried! I agree with not putting much water in, but I believe that's the best way to cook the apples...that was a lot of Apple's to peel but well worth it! Save the crumb recipe for all your future crumb desserts! It's a time and mess saver. Trust me! No more cutting butter in with knives or squishing it through your fingers, etc. Add dried fruit & nuts of your choice and let the  kids help. You can't mess this up!"
"0","4","I got rave reviews when I made this apple crisp today. I followed other reviewers advice and omitted the water. I used honeycrisp apples and had to cut down the sugar and brown sugar both. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","This was goodness plus. Made it just as directed. The family loved the crunchy top."
"0","5","Absolutely loved this one. My husband is a chef and be quite the critic and he loved it as well."
"0","5","can use less sugar and add a few chopped walnuts"
"0","2","Way too much sugar! And this comes from a sweet lover from way back."
"0","5","This was very good. I made it for an adult pot-luck and had not much left for my own kids to try. When it came out of the oven, it seemed soupy to me and I was very concerned. However, upon it setting up a bit, it was not too runny - just in a couple of corners and the texture was great."
"0","5","Perfection!"
"0","5","Very good! I left out the water, too. Definitely serve with vanilla ice cream. Best apple crisp I've made!"
"0","5","I don't usually like apple crisp as most are too sweet....to 1/2 cup white sugar and it was absolutely  delicious... would not hesitate to make again ...."
"0","5","Be careful with the amount of sugar to apple ratio. I didn't have quite 10 cups of apples so it was too sweet but still very good apple crisp"
"0","5","Made this yesterday exactly as written,we all loved it. This will be the only apple crisp I will make from now on. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"0","3","I should have left out the water because it turned it into a swamp. It was ok, but not one my favs."
"0","5","I only had half the apples so I halved the recipe but it was awesome!! The apple cinnamon buttery mix was excellent! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Fantastic Recipe! My husband was blown away. I reduced the liquid by half and had plenty. YUM!"
"0","5","This was one of my top five apple crisp recipe. The kids loved it. I would cut down on the sugar as suggested by others. Half the amount on the apples but keep for the topping. Will sure be making this again in the near future."
"0","5","This was very easy to make and delicious! I didn't find it too sweet. Maybe it is the apples that are used that make the difference. When I was cutting the apples, I was tossing them in fresh lemon juice to keep them from turning brown. I added some fresh grated nutmeg and vanilla. I tossed the apples, sugar (3/4 c), flour, and spices in a bowl and let it sit while I made the topping. I did not use any water. I added 1/3 c of sliced almonds to the topping. I greased the pan with the butter wrapper and added 1/2 the topping to the bottom. Some of the crumble on top was dry when I took it out of the oven. But it moistened during cooling and when I covered the pan with foil."
"0","5","Delicious! After reading through some of the reviews, I made the following adjustments: Omitted the water, doubled the topping, doubled the cinnamon and mixed the flour/sugar/cinnamon with the apples instead of sprinkling over the apples. I used Macoun apples and it came out just right...not too sweet and the apples were soft...just the way we like them! Also, in my oven it took roughly 55 min at 350."
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe! The best one I've come across with very minimal changes. I added a dash nutmeg to the apples and halved the water to 1/4 cup. Absolutely the best apple crisp. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Followed the directions exactly and it was delicious!!!!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe a few times now, and it comes out DELICIOUS EVERY TIME!! The only thing that I did different, was omit the water. Mine kept coming out to runny, so I just omitted the water, and now it comes out perfect!!!! Thanks for the delicious recipe Diane!!!!"
"0","5","Loved it I may put a little less sugar on the apples next time. My husband said its the best crisp he has had."
"0","5","Very tasty... I make this in a slow cooker which makes the house smell great while it cooks. Instead of melting the butter, I cut slices placing them in top. Cook for a few hourss on high. Yumm!"
"0","4","I found this recipe good, but too sweet. I doubled the crumb topping as per reviews in order to cover a 9 x 13 pan. I don't know if that's what made it too sweet or whether there is just too much sugar in the topping recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of water, but next time, I'd use 1/8 or none at all. This does make a great oatmeal topping. I made regular oatmeal, spooned some of this apple crisp on top, microwaved it, and de-lish. Better than store bought apple cinnamon oatmel."
"0","5","This is the 2nd time in a week that I am making this recipe. My husband loved it that much. The first time, I put the 'crisp' mixture on the bottom as well as on the top. I also use fresh apples, make them into a recipe on here for apple pie filling (for the freezer), but used them instead of freezing them. SO good!! I also use less water and a little less sugar in the apples then that recipe calls for and don't measure the nutmeg or cinnamon"
"0","5","I am not a great cook....I need to follow recipes and hope for the best. I think this is a great recipe, very easy and delicious! It will definetly become a 'go-to' recipe for me from now on:)"
"0","1","Way too sweet . Way too watery. Not what I had hoped for."
"0","5","This was amazing. I followed the advice of a lot of other reviews and skipped the water and it really doesn't need it. So good! My husband thought I was pretty wonderful!!"
"0","4","Added raisins send walnuts to apples"
"0","5","Best Apple Crisp recipe EVER!!!!!!"
"0","5","Came out so delicious. I recommend Cortland apples, every bit was mouth watering."
"0","5","I'm not a baker, but this was so easy! Thanks for sharing a next time I think I will use a pie crust on the bottom!"
"0","3","WAY too sweet. Even with using predominantly tangy Granny Smith apples, it was still overbearingly sweet. Add ice cream and you've got a sugar coma. I didn't add water based on other reviews and was glad I didn't. The apple juices were sufficient. Topping was great, just the right amount for the 9 x 13 pan. I like the generous size of this recipe and I will probably make it again but I'll reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup."
"0","4","Came out great, and I even used gluten free baking flour!"
"0","5","DELISH! decided to make my 1st ever apple crisp and chose this recipe. I used 8 granny smith apples(wasnt too sure on how many cups), next time will use 10. I read all the reviews, but still decided on using the water as the recipe states. To the water i added a big splash of vanilla. also added a pinch of nutmeg with the cinnamon. Finished product was amazing!"
"0","5","Really good."
"0","3","I like this recipe, but my wife and I think it's too sweet. There's no need to put as much sugar on top of the apples as the recipe call for. I'm guessing the sugar would offset VERY tart apples, but this recipe's sweetness took away from the apple-y-ness of the apples."
"0","5","This recipe was amazing. The only thing I did different was cut down on white sugar because I used Honey crisp apples & I figured they would sweeten it & it did perfectly :)"
"0","5","I prepared this desert for my in laws... They licked the plate clean! I did not add the water, instead I used the juice of one lime (I didn't have lemons on hand so that's what I used) and used Stark apples because thats all I could find... I did the refrigerating thing for the crust and used half white sugar and half brown sugar for the apples. An absolute keeper! Served warm with fior di latte icecream... DE-LI-CI-OUS!!!"
"0","5","I get stellar reviews every time I bake this! Love to bring to potlucks because it can be eaten hot or cold. Follow the recipe and the results will be delicious. I use Gala or Fuji apples and they are just right. The topping is delicious and can be doubled, but I think it's a perfect balance as is. Definitely a keeper!!!"
"0","5","I made this with loads of apples, no water, 2/3rds the sugar and 1 1/2 times the topping. I'll make it like that a couple times more this fall I believe!"
"0","5","This is the first of a very long list of apple crisp recipes I have tried! I love it! When I made this recipe, it didn't look like enough topping for my mother, so I doubled it...turned out great!"
"0","1","Way too sweet for our home. Can't imagine doubling the topping (2 cups of brown sugar). Try another recipe if you want a crisp with a less sweet taste. Won't make again."
"0","5","This is honestly the best Apple Crisp that I have ever had. The only modifications I made were to omit the water and added chopped walnuts. Soooo good. Thank you so much for sharing."
"0","5","Very easy recipe once you get past peeling the apples. As others stated, I did NOT add the water. No need. It bakes up with a sweet, cinnamony syrup from the baked apples.  And the topping is phenomenal! I have for years always had recipes that tell you to mix in softened butter and use a fork to mix until crumbling. What a PIA. This recipes states to melt the butter. So much easier to mix and the crisp topping was perfect. This is a keeper!"
"0","3","The topping doesn't have that golden top with the 1/2 - 3/4 inch gooey awesomeness that it should. Ends up with too much juice on bottom of pan. Maybe a 'lil more sugar mixed in with apples and no water. Overall very mediocre. Would not make again but can still enjoy the apples I picked with my children. Not a total loss."
"0","4","I like the two different kinds of sugar in the filling and the topping. I put the cinnamon (just a 1/2 tsp) in the topping rather than the apple mixture for a fresher apple taste. I also ALWAYS use CORTLAND apples. These are especially good if you like to eat the crisp once it has cooled. I think the flavor is far better than granny smith for crisps. Next time I might add another two TBSP of melted butter, I think it will make the crisp crispier and less dry."
"0","5","Made this with the suggestions from ALLY99 and doubled the crumble recipe to have a bottom & top crumble, used solid butter instead of melted and used a pastry tool to combine. Also tossed the apples with cinnamon / flour mixture, added the nutmeg and reduced the water to 1/4 as suggested. I also added more cinnamon & flour to coat the apples than the recipe called for (kind of just winged it with amounts until I felt it had the aromatics I liked). I also cooked it for an extra 10 min. but that could vary by oven. It all turned out great but I'd say it came out more like a crumble pie because it all held together like a pie. It makes quite a bit and is very sweet and rich so small servings seem to do the trick (but still delicious especially with vanilla ice cream!)"
"0","5","My boys loved it. Next time will add just a little less sugar."
"0","3","Flavour wise this recipe was delicious but like other reviews--too much water came out of the apples. I'm going to do a trick from America's Test Recipes and cook off the apples first--then bake it with the topping. I'm sure this will do the trick. I used honey crisp and Granny Smith apples."
"0","3","If you like sweet things,go for it, but it was WAY too sweet for us. Cut sugar greatly in half and omitted the BR. Sugar entirely!, then is was great. We like tasting the apples and not all sugar."
"0","5","This recipe is delicious. I won't be needing to search for another one. I agree with previous reviews that the water isn't needed. You can also add nuts and cranberries if you prefer. Enjoy!"
"0","5","SO delicious!  Modifications: -Halved the water but could've done without any water at all -Added vanilla to the sugar/cinnamon mixture -added nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon mixture -used 3/4 cup of pure cane sugar instead of 1 cup of white"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing! I did not add the water (I feel as though it makes it too soggy) and doubled the crust! It is a new family favorite! Thank You!"
"0","5","No alterations made as is and was delicious!! Oh I did double the topping I think my family likes the topping more that the apples LOL"
"0","5","Awesome! My family LOVED this recipe! I followed it exactly and was pleased!"
"0","5","Perfect! I used Granny Smith apples and after reading the reviews I was skeptical of the water but decided to still use the 1/2 c. and it worked great and tasted wonderful! Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","I made this recipe this past weekend for my husband, and he LOVED IT! I followed the recipe almost exactly! I cut the cinnamon in half and added a dash of nutmeg. Other than that, I followed the recipe (water and all) using Granny Smith apples and it came out wonderful! **We topped it with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream and it was heavenly!"
"0","5","Perfect.i had to make no changes.amazing just the way it is.yum!"
"0","5","OH MY GOODNESS! This was so freaking delicious! I kept pretty true to the original recipe except cutting the water down to 1/4 cup and added a little nutmeg. I used tart granny smith which gave it a nice balance. What a fantastic fall recipe to get you in the mood!!!! Thank you so much for a stellar dessert :) Will be making MANY more times"
"0","5","This is melt in your mouth delicious!!!! I drizzled hot caramel over and it was heaven. Mmmmmm. I highly recommend this recipe! :)"
"0","5","Turned out great! Followed all the directions, just cut it down to 4 serving sizes to get rid of some extra apples I had, and it came out looking and tasting fantastic."
"0","5","I loved this Reminded me of when I was a kid . I changed it a little bit by using gluten free flour & oats . Turned out Great!"
"0","5","Absolutely amazing. A little decadent on the sweet side, so if you're the type that can be overwhelmed by sweet, maybe cut down on the sugar. Might be I used apples that were too sweet to begin with though."
"0","5","I love this recipe. *This is so delicious as written* I wouldn't change a thing. Just a helpful tip - put the topping in the fridge for a couple hours & let the butter harden, that way the topping crumbles. I had issues with the topping not crumbling first time I made this, either way whether you let the butter harden or spoon bits on - its still soo good. I used Golden Delicious apples both times for this & it's wonderful. I like eating this for breakfast with a tall glass of Silk soy milk :-) yum, this is my second time making it & I will be making this over & over again forever. It is Fantastic!!"
"0","5","So delicious!!! I doubled the topping like others suggested but I also think it would have still been fine had I not."
"0","5","Great recipe. We used fresh gala apples we had picked today and it is fabulous. I did add a little extra butter in the oat mixture. I also sprinkled some extra dry oats over the top before baking. Sooo good."
"0","4","The recipe is totally amazing, it just needs to reduce sugar"
"0","4","Double the topping. Omit water. Use baking apples only. 50% brown sugar. Raisins. Coat apples with cinnamon and flour. Nutmeg."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly using a combo of granny smith and baking apples and it turned out perfect! Water mixed with the sugars into a delicious caramel-like sauce. Love the oat topping too! A+ recipe...now only if I can stop tasting so there is some left for the family! (Warning: it is irresistible!)"
"0","5","This was very easy & very good. Also liked that it was not super sweet."
"0","5","I made it today, followed other reviewers advice amd used 1/4 cup of water instead of half a cup and doubled the topping. Turned out yummy!"
"0","4","Was looking for a good way to use up a mixed batch of apples picked from a local farm and this was a simple delicious dish! The changes i made were ; Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and allspice, cut the white sugar to about 1/4 cup and skipped adding any water. The dish came out delicious and still plenty sweet without taking away from the flavor of the apples, thank you"
"0","5","Amazing! I used a little less butter than called for and it came out really good. It was perfect actually and turned out not overwhelmingly sweet. :)!"
"0","5","There's a reason this recipe has over 3,000 reviews! It's 5 STAR Delicious. I did use granny smith apples and followed the recipe to a 'T' Served up and topped off with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream!  Why deviate when it's perfect as written. USE APPLES..NOT PEACHES, PLUMS OR SOME OTHER FRUIT YOU MIGHT HAVE LAYING AROUND! IT'S APPLE crisp!"
"0","5","I loved this Apple Crisp recipe! So did my hubby! He ended up eating it all so I'm making it again (just went out and picked some apples) and now I can try it! I just had 1 taste! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"0","4","I really loved this recipe, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my apples got mushy. Maybe will cut down the baking time next time. Otherwise this was very delicious!!"
"0","5","This was an awesome recipe ... Made gluten free with bob's red mill flour ... Italian plums instead of the apples, no water and half the granulated sugar. Yum!"
"0","5","Excellent. Since its just me I cut the recipe way down. I used one Apple and topped it off with blueberries and doubled the topping and also added walnuts. OMG!"
"0","5","I'm not a fan of apples as they are from off the tree, but do like to make things out of them. This apple crisp recipe is sooo good and really easy to make. I do suggest that you prepare the dry ingrediences first before peeling and slicing the apples. It's best when served warm."
"0","5","Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous!! Thank you Diane :)"
"0","5","It was absolutely wonderful!!! I used a fruit that is common where I live in Brazil, but I'm sure that it would taste great with apples too!!! I cut down about half on the sugar and water (like other members recommended). The whole family loved it, and I was asked for the recipe by several people. It is worth trying."
"0","5","The best! Followed the advice of others and omitted the water. Made in an 8x8 pan and the single recipe for topping was perfect-came out nice and crunchy! For those who use Epicure products the Poudre Douce spice blend was delicious in this."
"0","5","LOL..... I accidentally missed the one cup of white sugar and when my family and I had some we all loved it, saying that it was great. We all loved the fact that it wasn't too sweat, then my daughter and I looked at the ingredients and I noticed that I totally missed the 1 cup of white sugar. For our family it was still the best apple crisp ever, and I will just leave out the white sugar as the brown sugar is sweat enough for us. Thanks"
"0","3","DO NOT ADD THE WATER!!! I wish I would have read the other reviews and omitted the water. I lost my apple crisp recipe and although I thought it was a little strange adding water, I did it anyways. The flavor is good, but the topping was overcome with the liquid of the dessert and turned soggy."
"0","4","This was super good, but a bit on the sweet side. I actually didn't have enough brown sugar and that worked out fine because I'm afraid if I added the full cup of brown sugar it would have been way to sweet. I'll make it again but I will cut back on the sugar. I served it with slow churn caramel ice cream and it was yummy."
"0","5","This is one of my favorite recipes for apple dessert. I think it would go very well with some vanilla ice cream. I never have oats in my house, so I use Honey Bunch of Oats cereal instead. It tastes really great."
"0","4","Good, but not as good as my mother in-laws recipe. I would make it again, because I have a good recipe to follow, where as my mother in-law doesn't measure anything. enjoy"
"0","5","This was a hit at my house. I used Granny Smith apples and left the slices a little thick. I halved the recipe for the apples but left the recipe for the topping the same and baked in an 8x8 dish. I also had to substitute some steel cut oats for the quick oats because of what I had on hand. Didn't cause a noticeable difference. I will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again. Loved it!"
"0","3","This was very 'soupy', even after cutting the water in half like other reviews suggested. The topping was very rich. This recipe made a lot and you could not eat much at one sitting. I will not make again."
"0","5","Though I like to follow all the directions to a high accuracy this time I made some slight alternations. I added only 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water, it was more than enough and a dash of nutmeg (mmm...). This recipe calls for 1 cup of brown sugar. As long as I have only dark brown muscovado, I used 1/2 a cup of it and didn't add any white sugar in the crisp. It came out sweet enough for me, because the filling is very sweet."
"0","5","Just made this for the first time. After reading the other comments, I used granny smith's, did half white, half brown sugar and mixed the dry mix with the apples before putting them in the baking dish. I used 1/4c water with the juice of half a lemon and a tsp vanilla and doubled the topping. It got great reviews!"
"0","5","This is the most amazing apple crisp I've ever tried! Serve while slightly warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","I have never made anything like this before and I was happily surprised with how easy it was! I made it with 10 red apples and doubled the topping, my husband and I loved it! I will certainly be making this again! I did follow other reviewers instructions and added nutmeg."
"0","4","Great recipe. I cut it in half since its just for me and my husband and I also added nutmeg and cut the water amount in half. My husband prefers the apples to be a bit 'saucy' and this recipe does that. Can't give it five stars since I altered it a bit but otherwise a great base recipe. Thanks."
"0","5","Best tasting bread I've coome across, thx"
"0","4","Very tasty"
"0","5","So yummy and crunchy. I refrigerated mine after assemble as others stated. Make sure the apples are peeled!"
"0","5","Very tasty! Husband said was a little too sweet and could use some raisins and/or nuts. Easy to make. Made as directed in the recipe."
"0","5","I used 6 granny smith apples and a fuji apple. I added a dash of nutmeg. It was very good. I give it a 4, but my husband gave it a 5. He loved it. My young kids did not care for it. **note: I've made this many times and it's turned out perfect, but tonight it was way too watery. Perhaps next time I will cut the water in half."
"0","5","I think this was amazing but im too afraid to try this with strawberries..."
"0","5","I follow the recipe as is and I have had nothing but compliments on this one"
"0","5","Superb! I zested a little lemon over the apples; it makes for a nice balance with the sugar sweetness."
"0","4","This is my go to apple crisp receipe come fall. It is quick, easy and tastes home made. I make a little bit more topping than the receipe calls for and also add a few more apples. Other than that it is a simple, delicious, uncomplicated apple crisp ."
"0","5","Made this for Father's Day and had it a la mode with vanilla ice cream. So awesome, and not too sweet. I didn't add the water since I had my apples previously frozen with all the filling ingredients, so when it thawed, there was plenty of liquid."
"0","5","I doubled the crust recipie which was a good choice! I also used Granny Smith apples as some of the other reviews said. Turned out great! Took this to a BBQ and it disappeared in minutes! People were asking me for the recipe. Suuuuper easy to make as well."
"0","5","Made this today and it was sooo good. I made half the recipe because I only had 6 apples (wished I had more). Did everything else like the recipe stated except I diced my apples and it came out perfect. Thanks pattycakes for a lovely recipe"
"0","5","Best every! add raisins and grapes for something real special!"
"0","5","This was so good, sent it to school with my daughter and the teachers couldn't get enough!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe!! Everyone loved it! It was pretty sweet, so I think I'd cut the sugar in half next time."
"0","5","The very best Apple Crisp that I have made to date!"
"0","5","I absolutely loved this recipe! Served over some vanilla ice cream, it was perfect!"
"0","5","I didn't change anything about the recipe I just added some banana's with apples and it turned out fantastic!!! Next time I'm going to try strawberries."
"0","5","Love this recipe it is perfect, my dad don't care for rich treats like brownies and cakes he enjoys apple pie and stuff like that, i made this bc didn't want to make a apple pie and he loved it :)"
"0","5","This was very good. I took suggestions of some of the other reviewers. I reduced the water to 1/4 cup, and I also doubled the topping. My kids loved it!"
"0","5","This turned out amazing! It was so easy that I was able to impress my in-laws and Im not a very good cook. I would leave out the water like other reviews said, but overall it's easy and quick. I was even surprised how delicious this came out. I will definitely be making this again!"
"0","5","Turned out great! I cut the apple portion of the recipe in half to fit an 8X8 pan, but kept the topping recipe the same for the larger pan. Lots of yummy topping...I did bake it a bit longer than 45 minutes to get the apples to cook through and the topping to brown. And, I added nutmeg. I might cut back on the water next time...it was a bit runny."
"0","5","my whole family loved this!!!!"
"0","5","Yum, yum, yum, and yum. I double the topping because it's something like eating a fabulous oatmeal cookie on top of apples."
"0","5","Followed other suggestions and doubled the topping. Also used less sugar and 1/2 the water (I used Braeburn apples). Was great warm with Vanilla ice cream after Easter Dinner. Next time, I'll use slightly less water and a little less sugar."
"0","4","I guess I'm more of a cobbler fan than a crisp fan and I'm really just rating the topping here. This tastes really good and is easy enough that a monkey could make it. When first out of the oven, it was crumbly and loose -- almost like granola -- which I didn't like and I gave it a three star rating at first. Then I came back 20 minutes later and it had all combined nicely and set up and I was pretty impressed with myself. :) LOL! I used an 8x8 pan and had two small clamshells of blueberries which I used in place of apples. I sprinkled about 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar, some cinnamon and about three tablespoons of OJ over the blueberries. I used the exact topping measurements for a 9x13 pan because nearly every reviewer said to double the topping recipe for a 9x13 so I assumed the regular recipe would work fine for an 8x8 pan. Yum."
"0","5","OMG OMG OMG! Made this (topped with vanilla glaze once it cooler for about 10-15 minutes) and my family gobbled it up and the 9 x 13 pan was practically licked clean! This was fantastic and will definitely be making this one again and again. (I also did NOT add the water and the apples produced plenty of liquid to not make it too soupy - was perfect!! (I used 7 apples - combination of Gala and Granny Smith apples)"
"0","5","Super yummy. I omit the water, and only use half the regular sugar... It's still plenty sweet. The batch in the oven right now has sweet cherries at one end (no cinnamon on them) I'm hoping that part is delish too."
"0","4","Really good! I reduced the sugar and water in the apples by half and it turned out great, but I would probably add more spices to the crumbly top next time."
"0","5","This recipe is amazing! We had apples in the fridge, and my mom told me to make an apple crisp with them. I found this recipe made it, and it was delicious! Easy for a 13 year old to make!  Changes I made:  ~Didn't use a full cup of water ~Didn't do 10 cups of apples"
"0","4","I halved the whole recipe because I was just using up Granny Smith apples I've had for far too long. It was really good, although I had it with yogurt and cool whip since I was out of ice cream, lol. I'm sure it would have been much butter with ice cream, but until I run to the store! Also, I think next time I will follow another person's suggestion to halve the water proportion, so there isn't so much of the thick sauce. It was good, and would be great if you like quite a bit of drizzle! Also, I cut the apples kind of thin so I will try and see how they turn out next time when I leave them thicker!"
"0","5","Very good and very easy to make! As per other reviewers, I did not add the water and cut the butter in rather than melting it. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, don't mix in the crumble with the apples...it will become soggy."
"0","5","fabulous - made the water adjustment to 1/4 cup and added the nutmeg as suggested."
"0","5","Very sweet! Did not add any water and it was perfect!"
"0","5","Loved it--wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","3","Hmm, I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Too liquidy and too sugary, and I even reduced the amounts the recipe called for.. the 'crumb' topping baked more in to a cake-like topping, but it was still pretty tasty overall, just not the apple crisp I was hoping for :( 3 stars for it being an nice basic and easy recipe.. with some variations I'm sure it could be really delicious :) I noticed a lot of other reviews said that skipped the water completely so I'll probably do that next time too and reduce the sugar more as well. Not sure what happened to the 'crumb' topping though."
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I left out the water,though. My family loves it."
"0","5","Yummy recipe. I used the amounts suggested (the full 10 cups of Granny Smith apples - 3 lbs.) and it was delicious. Instead of 1/2 cup water I used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice. I might try 1/4 cup less sugar in the topping next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"0","5","Slightly changed the recipe a little. Eased up on the flour and sugar it wanted. Only used 1/3 cup white, 3/4 cup brown, and 3/4 cup flour. Added a little extra quick oats. Same amount of butter. I used mostly Empire and threw in 3 Macintosh Apples. Wow. Became like an oatmeal cookie on top! Yummy and a smidgen less calories than original recipe. Apples are so sweet on their own don't be afraid to cut back on the sugar! Still comes out great. Everyone in my house loved it."
"0","5","WOW! This recipe is terrific! I made it with fuji apples (that was all I had on hand) and I ought to have cut back on the sugar. Mine was a tad too sweet. Next I will make it with granny smiths. Thanks allrecipes and whoever created this recipe"
"0","5","Doubled the crust and omitted the water. LOVED IT!!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I used the water & followed the recipe exactly. I would not use water again. I would also cut back the sugar. I'd use 1/4 white sugar next time. Nice flavour, everyone loved it."
"0","5","This dessert is absolutely delicious and I agree DOUBLE the crumb mix and mix the apples part in a ziplock bag they coat better."
"0","5","I loved this recipe but made some changes to clean it up. I used sucanat (evaporated cane juice) instead of brown sugar and used 1/2 of what it calls for. I also reduced the white sugar by about half. It was plenty sweet. I used organic apples and butter and added some walnuts and shredded coconut to the topping mixture. Fantastic!"
"0","5","I give it 6 stars!! We followed most of the reviews and did 1/2 water, doubled the toppings and added nutmeg. It was delicious. Not sure what type of apples we used but they were very soft when we used them and they were still good and not too mushy. DELICIOUS!!!"
"0","4","I enjoyed making this my husband loved it. It was a easy recipe and it didnt take long to do. The longest part was the apples but all in all it was easy and fun."
"0","5","I used 1/2 the water and it was delicious! Served with vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","great recipe I did not put any water in also and baked for and hour instead of 3/4 it is a keeper and looking forward to combining other fruits, like cranberries etc... thanks"
"0","2","I was not impressed with this recipe. Made it for our supper club and was apologizing for how it turned out. Like other reviews, it was way too juicy. I even cut back on the water. A little too sweet also. Will never make again. Lady Di"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing! It was simple, easy to make and delish. I substituted the flour for whole wheat flour, only because that's all I had. Worked great! Served with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","I love this recipe. I had gotten a fruit basket when I started a new job and had pears and apples that I didn't know what to do with and I didn't want them to go bad. I used both fruits with this recipe along with a few granny smith apples. It came out perfect! I didn't use quite as much water, just a sprinkle or so. I paired it with some Hagen-daaz vanilla bean ice cream and mmmmmmm yummy!"
"0","5","So good!!! I followed this recipe and my boyfriend and I devoured it. I'm still learning how to cook/bake, and this was easy to follow. Even *I* didn't screw it up and it came out great!"
"0","4","I've made this recipe twice - once as written, and once with modifications. I think the original recipe is 4 stars because it's good, but lacking in flavor complexity. It's sweet; maybe too sweet. The second time around, I used lemon juice in place of water over the apples, and added some nutmeg, and thought it was amazing. The lemon juice really does something wonderful."
"0","5","Made this the other day and we loved it. I've never put water in apple crisp, so I left it out. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. My teenaged grandson asked for seconds. I didn't measure the apples....I just used 5 large Granny Smiths, and that was plenty for a 9X13 pan. Thanks for an easy recipe that tastes yummy!"
"0","5","I omitted the water as others suggested. I did add a little bit of fresh grated orange and about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of juice from the orange to the apples."
"0","5","I love this recipe!"
"0","4","Excellent Recipe , modified to suit my family just a little"
"0","2","This is by far the worst apple anything I have ever made. Under the 'OKAY' tasting topper, the apples were just sitting there with no flavor, plainly and oh so boring. Made it for guests and I was so embarrassed once I cut it open to serve. Terrible."
"0","5","this was absolutely delicious! the only thing i'll do differently next time is make 1.5 batches of the crumb topping. we like a bit more crisp in our house :)"
"0","4","About twice as much sugar as I would like making it too sweet but otherwise really nice. Wonderful flavor, made even better by adding some chopped pecans to the topping."
"0","5","My grandson made this for New Years and it was delish."
"0","5","Easy to make and tasty. I only added the oatmeal mix to the top the second time as the first time it was mushy on the bottom. You can add this to just about any fruit for a delicious Crisp dessert."
"0","5","this is a great recipe! my family loved it."
"0","4","Overall, a pretty decent recipe! A little too sweet for me, so next time I'll cut the sugar back a bit! But definitely a recipe I'll use/make again! :)"
"0","5","Delicious. Since I used cortland apples, I cut the white sugar in half and added the juice of one lemon to the apples. Also added nutmeg - just a little. Topping actually had a little crunch, which was very nice."
"0","5","Favorite apple crisp recipe"
"0","5","Loved it. Doubled the topping to make a crust and topping. Added a dash of some extra spices (allspice, nutmeg, and cloves), tapioca beads instead of flour, and baked at 365. This temperature increase gave the crust a crunchy texture and allowed my apples to get slightly softer. I've made this recipe multiple times and my husband describes it as 'the best apple crisp ever.'"
"0","4","My only tip is to use salted butter in this recipe."
"0","5","Delicious and super easy to make. I used cortland apples which were perfect and still firm after cooking. 6-7 apples sliced up to > 10 cups."
"0","5","BEST APPLE CRISP EVER!!! I used 10 Granny Smith apples and added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the mix. Serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Perfection!"
"0","5","5 stars since it was gone in one night."
"0","5","I loved this recipe.  My changes were:  coconut oil instead of butter. Due to dietary restrictions.  Pineapple juice instead of water. I made it up ahead of time and did not want the apple to go brown. DELICIOUS. A big hit. Had it straight out of the oven and served with vanilla ice cream. YUMMY"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Wonderful just as written (but I always decrease the sugar to our taste)."
"0","4","It was awesome. I thought it was very good!"
"0","5","This is EXCELLENT!! I have made it now for the last couple of dinner invites we have gone to and it gets RAVE reviews each time. Some reviews commented about skipping the 1/2 cup of water because it makes it too watery. I did add the water, but added 2 Tbsp of 'minute tapioca' to the sugar mixture that you pour over the apples. This is what I add to fruit pies to give it some thickness, and works well with this recipe too. I serve it hot with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream and it is divine!"
"0","4","I enjoyed it, I found that the amount of apples it asked for caused it to be a little too watery but still very enjoyable!"
"0","5","Excellent. I have tried several recipes and this is by far the best."
"0","5","this was a simple recipe that has great results. I used granny smith apples from a local orchard and loved it! I didn't use ten apples and added 1 1/2 cups more of oats since I like a lot of oats on mine. Great recipe."
"0","5","This is the best recipe for apple crisp I've ever tasted. I will make this again for sure. I will always use this recipe when I make apple crisp."
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried. My whole family loved it. My only difference was the cooking time took 60 min. in my oven, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Love it!!!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! If you double the crisp topping you definitely only need a 1/2 cup white sugar (if that) with the apples. Double the topping and use half pressed into the bottom of the pan and the rest crumbled over the apples. I used granny smith apples and only 1/4 cup water. It turned out wonderfully! I will definitely be making this many more times!"
"0","5","This apple crisp was DELICIOUS! I had so many apples, I made four recipes of apple stuff. This was the best out of all of them! Best apple crisp I've ever tasted. It looked pretty weird since I've never actually made apple crisp. I made it with my friends and ate some at parties. They all tasted way too sweet. I used Granny Smith Apples and didn't use as much sugar. Next time, I'm just going to skip the water part, because the bottom of the pan was too moist. I only used 1/4 of a cup of water, but it was still too watery. It still tasted good though!"
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious, paired with some Haagen Daz French Vanilla was an absolute hit and now family favorite request. (I may add a pinch of salt to the crisp but that's my personal pallet.. either way it's great!)"
"0","5","This apple crisp is absolutely DELICIOUS!! I knew that I didn't have the full amount of apples that the recipe called for so I only used 1/4 cup of water, but made the full amount of topping. OH. MY. GOODNESS. I ate so much Im going to be sick. This is SO good."
"0","5","This is soooooo yummy! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Best ever!! I took this to a get together and got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe! The entire pan was gone when I left. I did omit the water in the recipe like others suggested and doubled the crust. I also baked it for a little longer than suggested. I used granny smith apples sliced very thin. I served it with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","The best!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe! So simple and SO good!!"
"0","5","The boys ate it in one third the time it took to make it. It was a hit and so easy"
"0","5","This was fantastic - especially straight out of the oven, with ice cream. Yum!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the crumble part of the recipe. It's a good move, because you wind up with just a *bit* too much crumble, and get to munch on the extra stuff while everything's baking."
"0","5","The best apple crisp I have ever tasted. I used a bit less water and added .5 tsp of nutmeg."
"0","4","I made this the other night and I must say it was delish! We did not have any icecream to go with it but there were no complaints! Very tasty!"
"0","5","Yum! I didn't have any baking apples on hand so I used the red delicious (4) and cut down on the sugar. I also made this in an 8x8 pan without the water and it came out perfectly. Next time i will add more cinnamon and more ice cream....Thanks for sharing. This will be my go to recipe for Apple Crisp."
"0","5","This is my new go to recipe for apple crisp. We all LOVED it. I used whatever apples I happened to have around my house. Because it was not granny smith, I cut down on the white sugar. I followed reviewer advice and tossed the apples with the spice-sugar mixture. Also reduced water to 1/4 cup. Personally, I love oats, so I reduced the flour and added extra oats to the crumble. I can see why this recipe is so well loved. Best apple crisp to ever come out of my kitchen!"
"0","5","The best ever!! And I have made a lot of different recipes. And easy, my 8 yr old did most of it."
"0","5","Tastes Ike an oatmeal cookie on top! I added nutmeg, ginger, and ground cloves with the cinnamon. No water! The apples give off enough. I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup. For topping, I over measured all of the dry ingredients to make up for the egg I added with the butter. Amazing! I can't help but tweak recipes, but this would be great without modification! Wonderful, yummy, fast, easy, and convenient!"
"0","5","Phenomenal! Absolutely terrific. This is the best crisp I've ever made. The kids and husband loved it. I used the recipe exactly as written and it worked well. I used equal parts of granny smith and red apples (picked them myself from an apple farm nearby) and it was a delectable blend of sour and sweet. I forgot to add the half cup of water and ended up adding it almost near the end of the bake cycle. But no harm done. It still came out awesome. Thank you for this recipe!"
"0","5","This was DELICIOUS! I did take the advice and cut the water down to 1/4 c and I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp cloves becuase I think these all go with each other and make it extra special! Have made several times and loved by all who try it!"
"0","5","Definitely double the crumb topping and I did add a dash of nutmeg to the apple coating. I halved the water suggested and it came out too watery for my liking. I think next time I may leave out the extra water completely. All in all a GREAT recipe!! This is going to be one I make over and over again!!"
"0","5","Wow. Excellent!"
"0","5","This is the best recipe as is, but can be modified with anyone's creativity. I have made this so many times this fall, and never have leftovers!!! Make sure to have vanilla ice cream on hand for an extra 'umph!'"
"0","5","I made this for the first time today and I thought it was great. I will make it again. I reduced the recipe down to serve four, used granny smith apples, and doubled the topping as many reviewers suggested. I do not like things that are very sweet and I think the granny smith tart apples counter balanced the sweetness of the sugar. This would probably be a good dish to take to a party. The topping is staying crisp so it would not be mushy if served hours later. Next time I will add walnuts to the topping. I would imagine that this is a good basic recipe to use with different kinds of fruit or ingredients - nuts, raisins, coconut, etc."
"0","5","Excellent!!"
"0","5","Great recipe. The only thing I did that differed from the recipe was to dice the apples then put the apples in the sugar, flour and ground cinnamon mix. Then spoon the mix into individual oven safe ramikens.I baked 6 of them @ 350 degress for 35 minutes. This is one of my favorites!!"
"0","5","So, easy! Prepped it and had it ready to go in the oven when dinner came out. By the time the kitchen was cleaned, we were ready for dessert. LOVE the oats added as well. The brown sugar carmelized around the edges which made for yummy 'pickings' during clean up time. Will definitely make again. I'm gonna have to try some other fruits...cherries, peaches, pears, a mixture of fruits! Might even add some cranberries to this for a Thanksgiving dessert."
"0","5","delisiouse"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe., did not use water, used splenda instead of regular sugar mixed the sliced apples in to the cinnamon & sugar mixture.."
"0","5","Perfect just as written! This is now my 'go-to' recipe for company dessert - served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","4","This is really good! The prep time took longer than stated (mostly for the apples), but it was worth it. I halved the recipe and used Smart Balance instead of butter; I also used Granny Smith apples- the best for baking! My only complaint is that there is too much sugar in the topping- it's still grainy on the final product. I'd either cut back on the sugar a little or add more oats or something to balance out the topping. Otherwise this is delicious! I think I'll add raisins next time for a little extra something."
"0","5","This recipe was amazing!!! Only 2 suggestions, melt an extra portion of butter and drizzle on top before putting the crisp in the oven, that way it comes out crunchier and holds together better with big chunks of brown sugar and oatmeal. Also, when making half a batch, do not use the 9 x 13 pan- the crust will be too thin even if you double the crust. Use at least an 8x8 pan. I made this recipe at about 2pm and by 6pm my 6 roommates had pretty much licked the pan clean. Oh and it would taste even better with some vanilla bean ice cream."
"0","4","By far the best apple crisp recipe I've used. This topping was nice and had a bit of a crunch to it, whereas others I've tried in the past just sort of sat there on the top, did not brown or crisp up. I really think the secret here is how the entire recipe is put together. Here the apples go in, then water then sprinkle with the topping.. This recipe is far superior and tasted like the crisps I always remembered my Nana making and I could never replicate until now. Thank you, Diane for a great recipe!"
"0","4","The house smelled amazing while this was baking! This recipe is great and everyone seemed to enjoy it. For me, it was a little too sweet, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. The crisp was delicious though, and was perfect with some vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Just made this tonight with Northern Spy apples (half batch). DELICIOUS!! I also used Splenda in place of sugar (both granulated and brown) and it came out perfectly. Excellent recipe. I will be making this again for sure!!"
"0","4","This Apple Crisp was very good! I forgot to add the water to mine and it still tasted very delicious. I made this for the company we had over, and they liked it a lot, too! :) Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great apple crisp recipe."
"0","5","Loved it. I split it into 2 smaller pans, It turned out wonderful. I used apples from my tree, not sure what kind they are. I think I could have cut the water in half but it's nice and juicy. Very good flavor. Printed it out on one of my pretty cards for my recipe box. I definitely will make this again. Thanks for sharing it."
"0","5","Everyone loved this. Easy and perfect with hot apple cider"
"0","5","This was one of the best apple crisps I've ever made/had! I didn't change a thing, and it was perfect. I used Mcintosh apples. I will make this again and again!"
"0","5","i never made apple crisp before.i followed the directions exactly except i used granny smith apples and i only used 1/4 cup of water as i read in some reviews.sooooo many ppl said it was fantastic!!will be making this again!:)"
"0","5","I have used this recipe for 2 years now and it is fabulous. Whenever I have a bag of apples my family won't eat, I use this recipe. The only thing I have ever changed is I have doubled the topping since my family loves this part. I have made this recipe as it is written also and it is wonderful. This is one recipe I know I will hand down to my daughters. Thanks for posting."
"0","5","Left out the water and doubled the butter, which I cut into small pieces and mixed with my hands rather than melting. Also halved the apple part and and put the crust in the freezer while I prepared the apples. Substituted old fashioned oats. Very good!"
"0","5","A great recipe, i have made many times."
"0","5","This was a huge hit at a rehersal dinner for a country theme wedding,delicious!!!!"
"0","5","Yummy! The best crisp i've ever made. Went over with everyone."
"0","5","this is the first apple crisp i made and i won't be looking for any other recipes! this was amazing, everyone at dinner LOVED it! i took the advice of others and tweaked it a bit. i only used 1/4 cup of water, doubled the crust and added nutmeg! PERFECTION!"
"0","5","Absoutely wonderful. One of those things that you could eat and eat until it's gone. Wow!"
"0","5","Amazing! Double the topping!!!"
"0","5","OK, so I will preface my rating with some history: My brother-in-law is the considered the apple crisp critic of the family and my mother bakes prize-winning apple pie. I have experimented over the years with apple crisp and decided to give this one a try this weekend. It was hands down, the best apple crisp we (he) has ever had. My mother always told me to mix your apples when baking pie/crisp, so I used Northern Spy and Macintosh mixture and cut the water in half as some recommended. I also added a dash of nutmeg and doubled the topping amount. I baked it in a deep dish square pan and had a little left over for a smaller single portion (for the neighbours). The mixture game some apples a mushier texture (Macs) and a few firmer pieces that melted in your mouth with the vanilla ice cream. It was served warm, but I am looking forward to some cold left-overs to see if the reviews hold out. In my opinion, this recipe kicked apple pie butt! :)"
"0","4","This was delicious, but I felt like it had just a tad too much sugar even though I used Granny Smiths. Next time, I think I will cut the sugar on the apples back to 1/2c and will add nutmeg like others suggested."
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I have made! Not too sweet and just the right amount of crunch!! :)"
"0","4","I was very tasty! I will add a little more cinnamon next time."
"0","5","This recipe became a family favourite! Thank you Diane for sharing it!"
"0","3","I'll use this as a base for apple crisp in the future but it was WAY TOO SWEET!!!! I always make recipes exactly as described the first time because, although I am experienced at baking, you never know when you are going to be surprised. Well, as I made this recipe I kept thinking to myself 'wow, that's a LOT of sugar' and it turns out I was right. WAY too sweet. I would cut the sugar in half next time and save myself the toothache. The only thing I changed was that I used apple cider instead of water in the recipe."
"0","5","Delicious! Loved this recipe! Made it as written with the exception of throwing in a pinch of nutmeg. I used about 8 macintosh apples and a couple of five point delicious (What I had on hand) and it turned out wonderfully! Poured half the sugar mixture over the apples and gave them a stir in the pan to coat all of them then dumped the other half on top. I used a 13 X 9 pan and the single batch of topping was just right! Served hot with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream was great! I do think next time I will cut the water down to half but will definalely use it as it made a nice sauce to coat the apples. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. :)"
"0","5","Absolutely Amazing! 5 stars for sure. I did not add the water and doubled topping. Sure was a hit at my dinner party. No need to search for any more apple crisp recipes!"
"0","5","Best apple crisp ever! No leftovers."
"0","5","I followed some of the other reviewers advice and doubled the oats (to make a bottom) and halved the water. Divine. Raves from everyone myself included, because tooting your own horn is fun. Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I have made. I did leave out the water though. I can't imagine putting water in it. I think it would turn to apple sauce which is not how I want my apple crisp to be. Without the water, the topping came out nice and crispy."
"0","3","the recipe is a good base but i added nutmeg to the suger cinn mixter and tossed the apples in it also instead of water i added leamon juice and vinnila extract and i doubled the oats and butter"
"0","5","I tried this recipe last weekend- very, very delicious! I drizzled some caramel sauce on top after it was finished baking and we ate it with french vanilla ice cream - HEAVENLY!"
"0","5","Delicious! Made just a few minor tweaks. 1 - Cut apples into bite size (cubed) pieces for more efficient cooking all the way thru and for ease of eating smaller pieces.  2 - Substitued the cinnamon that is called for in the apple filling mixture for APPLE PIE SPICE (much tastier).  3- Added ground cinnamon in the crumble topping mixture for flavor."
"0","5","YUmmy. nice and crunchy yet also has the softness of the apple."
"0","5","Well.Done!!!Loved.It"
"0","5","This is an easy desert to make that tastes wonderful! I read that others doubled the topping, but I didn't to save on fat content and it turned out perfect! However, I didn't add the water and it still was moist and delicious! I will make this again!"
"0","5","Best Apple Crisp ever!"
"0","5","the best apple crumble recipe ever!"
"0","5","This was so easy and so good. No water needed in mine, as the apples I used were plenty juicy on their own."
"0","5","This apple crisp is delicious and so easy! Thank you for this great recipe! I used 4 Golden Delicious apples which is probably half of what the recipe called for. Therefore I had a lot more of the crumble part, but it came out great anyway, as that's the part I like most! Some reviews say to double the crust/crumble, and I would agree. The crust came out a bit crispy and chewy, and perfectly sweet! The only thing I added, was 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon/flour mix. I also used Maple and Brown Sugar instant oatmeal instead of quick oats as that's all I had, but the flavor matched very well with the apples. Next time, I will add more apples to this and add more crumble/crust accordingly. It will be interesting also to try other types of apples, like Honeycrisp. We served it with ice cream and it was BOMBDILICIOUS!!!"
"0","5","very good. the only change i made was adding about 1 tsp of vanilla"
"0","5","Super! Had old apples and didnt want to throw. I never follow exact measurements for any recipe; use as per my taste and intiution. Didnt use water at all. Didnt peel apples. Didnt use baking powder and soda. Didnt use melted butter - used semi-frozen butter pieces. Chop apples (cubes), spread them in the tray. poured dry mix of flour+cinnamon powder+sugar+flour. Topped with butter bits.  Next time, will make a layer of the dry ingredients at the bottom (below the apples) as well, to make it even crispier. Like a sandwich. Overall, extremely easy, no fuss, and super quick. Served with Vanilla ice-cream...Tops!!!"
"0","5","Best Apple Crisp I have ever had! Not exactly healthy - but oh so good and worth every calorie. Thanks!"
"0","5","I halved the recipe to make 6 servings, it really is still a lot! I also used half pears/half apples. bartlett were not baked to softness but it added a nice crunch. i also served it with 1/4 cup of frozen yogurt. it's perfect for a rainy night"
"0","5","Super delicious! I didn't read the reviews first and I wish I had because I would have omitted most of the water and cut the sugar in half."
"0","5","Great recipe! I substituted coconut oil for the butter, and added 1/2 cup more oats & 1/4 cup molasses to the mix. I also left the apple peels on the fruit. Yummy!"
"0","5","Fantastic Simple Recipe! So, I switched it up entirely! Sorry, could not resist the temptation to try a variation - I had some frozen fruit puree that I thawed and mixed in with the apples (used 1/2 fruit puree consisting of: 2 ripe plums, peeled and cored; 3 ripe pears, peeled and cored; 3 granny smith apples, peeled and cored). Because of the sweet fruit puree, I halved the white sugar. Naturally, I was out of butter, so I used extra virgin olive oil - albeit a bit fearful of this, and took the advice of using less water. No problems! In fact, all changes turned this desert into a gourmet crumble. Yum - thanks for the inspiration!"
"0","5","Fantastic! Now my go to recipe for crisp!!"
"0","4","Only changes I madewere to add 1 Tb of lemon juice...brighter flavor and keeps the apples from Browning while peeling and slicing. I used 6 instead of 8 Tb of butter. The first time I made it I used 8 Tb and it was a little too wet."
"0","5","soooo yummy! this was the perfect dessert on a cold fall day!"
"0","5","the BEST APPLE Crisp EVER!! This apple crisp is wonderfully sweet, and is especially fantastic when contrasted with sour Granny Smith apples. Try it, save it in your recipe box, and use whenever possible!"
"0","4","I doubled the crisp part as many other reviews did. I thought it was way too much and way too sweet. I used red delicious as that's the apple I like and halved the sugar and that part was delicious. Next time I'll stick to one batch of th crisp and reduce the brown sugar. Overall still good, but I would modify next time."
"0","5","Wonderful! Easy to make, and extremely delicious. Double the toppings makes it even better."
"0","5","AMAZING!!!!! I have a large family so I made a very large batch of this. I overlooked adding the cinnamon to the sugar/flour mix that you place on the apples, so I just sprinkled very little on it and mixed the remaining cinnamon in the crumb mixture - YUMMY. I have teenage kids who tweeted how good this was. thank you for sharing this recipes, I will use it for years to come."
"0","3","I tried a suggestion on here to half the water and double the topping. Seemed like too much topping, kind of seemed dry. Wouldn't double again."
"0","5","This was so easy to make and tasted fantastic. We used fresh picked New York Empire apples. Eat hot with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","halved everything and put in an 8x8 dish. a little watery so use less water next time. 10/13: full recipe, used a variety of apples, very good. i used half the water in the recipe and it was still watery. some users suggesting mixing the white sugar mixture in with the apples instead of sprinkling on top, next time try that and use only 1/8th a cup of water.10/14: 1/8 th cup of water and double the flour in the sugar mix worked well. used 5 granny smith and could have used 2 more to fill large white dish."
"0","5","Great recipe!!! I did not change anything and it was perfect!!!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. I used 3/4 cup of white sugar with the apples and I did not add the water with the apples and it was just fine. It is wonderful served warm with ice cream or whipping cream and a big glass of milk!"
"0","5","Delicious!! It was a hit with the family. I used a little less sugar and it was amazing!"
"0","4","Just made this Apple Crisp II, my first crisp ever and it turned out very delicious. I will serve mine with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream :)"
"0","5","Yummy!"
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe, it tastes amazing"
"0","5","Very good"
"0","5","Amazing! (with a few changes) I used twice the amount of the topping like a lot of others. I put juice of half a lemon over the apples, then mixed the cinnamon mixture over the apples before putting them in the pan. I also put 1/4 tsp salt into the crumb mixture. Didn't melt the butter either like the others- just softened so it was crummy. Oh yeah-I cut the water in half- might even cut in half again (1/4 cup) AMAZING!!!!"
"0","4","Overall easy and good flavor. A little sweet for my liking. I did use Macintosh which are not the best for baking; which may have contributed to sweetness. Will try Granny Smith next time and maybe cut back a bit on sugar. Also omitted the water as the apples were already soft."
"0","5","This is the PERFECT recipe! I added a little vanilla extract with the water, and also added a bit of nutmeg with the cinnamon. Everyone that has tried this instantly wants the recipe!!"
"0","5","Crispy, tasty, will make again, I used wholewheat flour and baked in 2 8' round foil pies dishes so I could freeze one pie, slight overfill problem but made for very deep juicy pies. I forgot to add the water so probably depends how juicy your apples are to start with."
"0","4","I made this for my reading group and they loved it! I thought the sweetness was a bit over the top, though. I left off the icing and served it with a dollop of whipped cream. The cinnamon chips were difficult to find, so next time I'll go with white chips and add cinnamon to the apples."
"0","4","It was good, next time i'll leave out the water. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg on the topping."
"0","5","This was EXCELLENT and amazingly easy to prepare. LOVED the taste and texture. To make it simpler I cut the recipes in 1/2, chopped up the celery, SHREADED the carrots and 1 large onion, added 4 cloves of garlic. Boil for 10 min, than simmer on low heat for 10min. This made the soup thick and hearty in taste (without the need to puree or strain). We added chicken and fresh parsley to the leftovers ....result...SUPER YUMMY...not a drop left!!!!"
"0","4","I followed the recipe to the letter and would probably cut the water. Mine turned out very runny, however, the taste was excellent!"
"0","4","I thought this was very good, but I modified it a bit. I don't like my apple crisp too sweet, so instead of mixing the apples with 1 cup of sugar, I used 2T of sugar and 3/4 t of cinnamon. I also left out the liquid, and thus the flour. I made the topping as written, and threw in a handful of chopped pecans. I will make it again, as I modified it, because it turned out just the way I like it!"
"0","5","Amazing! Used 5 granny smith apples, left out the water, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars and used a 8x11' pan."
"0","5","So easy after you peel the apples!"
"0","5","LOVED IT WAS SO GOOD AND SIMPLE I USED SPLENDA WHITE SUGAR AND BROWN AND WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR FIVE STAR ."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly, using only 8 cups of apples though. This turned out EXCELLENT! Very good!!!! Definitely will NOT disappoint!"
"0","5","Excellent! The best apple crisp I have ever made!"
"0","5","Will definitely make it again. Made it a little healthier by using Splenda. Next time will try applesauce instead of the butter. Wonderful flavor."
"0","5","I signed up for the site in order to leave a review!  We'd eaten dinner last night and wanted something sweet. Usually I'll whip up a quick batch of cookies, but had no softened butter.  I made this so fast and it was SOOOOOO delicious! Even with the nondescript apples we had on hand. I can only imagine how good it'll be when I purposefully choose good apples to bake it with. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Love this Recipe!! I didn't change a thing! My father in law is begging me to make this again! PS..I am drooling looking at the picture!"
"0","5","simple and delicious. My husband's favorite and my first time making it."
"0","4","Didn't add any water but followed the rest of the recipe. Pretty good."
"0","5","delish! Read some of the reviews so added a cup of chopped pecans to the topping which gave it an extra crunch. I also used 1/4 cup apple juice instead of 1/2 cup water and the sauce was very flavorful and not runny at all. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
"0","4","Delicious! I tried this recipe using apples from our garden (no idea what type) and followed the recipe as written except cut it in half as there is just the two of us. Wonderful recipe. Tried it on its own last night but tonight will have it with ice cream. Thanks for the recipe Diane K."
"0","4","My family and I loved this recipe! Granted, we did tweak it, but it was one of the best Apple Crisps I have ever made. I used home-grown apples, used 3/4 cups of sugar instead and it was still too sweet. Next I plan to cut the water in half, cut the brown sugar in half, and cut the white sugar in half. I will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","Generally not a fan of cooked apples, but this was delicious. The only thing I did differently was add half the amount of water and white sugar called for."
"0","4","It was pretty tasty with some vanilla ice cream. It does have a lot of butter and sugar so you might want to cut back a little on that. I had about 6 kids fighting over who got to have seconds though!"
"0","5","I made this exactly like the recipe states. I used three granny smith apples and three braeburn apples. I cut them into bite size chunks instead of slices. It turned out perfectly!!! I wouldn't change a thing."
"0","5","This was awesome! I did not use water and doubled the topping. Definitely a hit."
"0","5","Tastes great! Definitely making again!"
"0","5","I asked my hubby to grab me some apples from the store for our son's lunch box. Not knowing one apple from another he bought the granny smith apples because 'they looked good.' I decided to make this recipe with them and I was surprised at how easy and quick it was. Both of my boys are happy now enjoying this awesome dessert."
"0","4","Double the topping, reduce the white sugar by 1/2 on the apples, and either reduce water or add more flour."
"0","5","Great even with cutting the amount of both sugars in half."
"0","5","Amazing....really really amazing. I have made several versions of apple crisp and this is by far the best!"
"0","4","I tried this last night. I love that there is so much more oatmeal crisp than most recipes. Love that it is both under and on top of the apples. The only critique I have is that it is quite heavy on the cinnamon. I will cut it back at least half next, if I use it at all. Also, be sure to grease pan really well. I just rubbed the stick of butter over the pan before I started and it stuck pretty bad. But this is by far my new favorite crisp recipe. Cant wait to try it with peaches or berries!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT!! My whole family loves it!"
"0","5","Couldn't have been better."
"0","5","I tried thsi recipe last night as I'm currently on Weight Watchers as I'm craving something sweet. The BEST APPLE CRISP I have ever made/ate! I made 4 servings and it's only 7 Points per serving which was great."
"0","5","Absolutely the best Apple Crisp Recipe ever! I used half the apples because that's all I had and the extra topping was my favorite part!"
"0","4","quick and easy. The kids helped make and eat! :)"
"0","5","This apple crisp is awesome!!! One of our family's favorites."
"0","4","Thank you for this recipe, it was wonderful! It was my daughter's 18th birthday yesterday and she wanted apple crisp for desert instead of cake. I made this for our family dinner and it smelled wonderful as it cooked and was delicious - rave reviews by all. I used Granny Smith apples, added a bit of nutmeg to the topping, doubled the topping as suggested by others since we all really like that part of the dish too, and used cold butter to cut into the topping. Excellent taste and consistency. I prepared it the night before, refridgerated it overnight, and popped it in the oven for about an hour before we started our main course - perfect!  This will be my 'go-to' apple crisp recipe!"
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe, and my go-to for apple crisp. My husband absolutely adores apple crisp, and this got a huge double-thumbs-up from him the first time I made it!  Following advice from previous reviewers, I halved the water to 1/4 cup and doubled the topping. I also substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for half of the white sugar called for in the recipe. Use granny smiths or another tart apple variety or it will be too sweet.  I'm making this again tonight as a special treat for my husband - he's very excited! :)"
"0","5","I double the topping. This is so good, that I am now responsible for bringing it every Thanksgiving. Don't forget the French vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","Excellent taste. However, there is standing water in the pan so add a bit more flour to the apples."
"0","5","Super easy and includes ingredients that I always have in the house. To it to a family dinner and didn't have to worry about carting home leftovers."
"0","5","This apple crisp was amazing! I doubled the topping, which made it perfect, and I added nutmg to the apples and the topping also with cinnamon to the topping"
"0","5","Wonderful!! I used some extra Braeburns we had on hand. They were sweet enough that I cut the sugar called for in half, but made the mistake of using the full amount of water which ended up making a sloshy cinnamon soup at the bottom of the pan. The apples released enough moisture during baking that I don't think the extra water was needed. Great recipe though, thank you!"
"0","5","Did 1 1/2 times the topping, added nutmeg to sugar/cinnamon mixture and tossed apples in the mixture before putting in the dish. Delicious!"
"0","5","Soooo good. I doubled the topping = AWESOME CHOICE"
"0","4","Oh my gosh, this was awesome. I made a couple changes from reading the review, I only added 1/4 cup of apple, added nutmeg and as for the plain rolled oats I didn't have any so I used Quaker flavored instant oatmeal, the flavors I used were maple and brown sugar and apples and cinnamon....It was delicious then topped off with some chocolate icecream....This was a hit and will make it again...Thank you"
"0","5","I made this per the recipe and do not change a thing. It was wonderful and very easy. I used Granny Smith apples. A three pound bag of apples is perfect for this recipe."
"0","4","decreasing water is not a good idea, tasted good but not very juicy, very sticky without the extra water. we did double the topping and used on bottom and on top that was a tasty bonus"
"0","5","LOVED THIS RECIPE IT WAS PERFECT!!! WOULD NOT CHANGE A THING!! THANKS FOR SHARING"
"0","5","Like others have said...I would cut out the water next time. But this is the best tasting Apple Crisp I have ever had."
"0","5","amazing. i don't add any water, the apples juice enough on their own. this is a quick and easy go to, especially during apple season."
"0","5","Took the advice of other reviewers, added no water & doubled the topping, SO good!!"
"0","5","My family thought this was delicious and one of the best crisp recipes they had eaten!!! Only thing I added was some fresh grated nutmeg to the apple mixture. Good additions."
"0","5","This is the all-time best apple crisp recipe! I made one change, omitting the sugar. If you use a sweet variety opp the white sugar, added at the beginning, isn't necessary!"
"0","5","Easy and great tasting!! The hardest part was cleaning the peeler/slicer/corer. It made the house smell WONDERFUL while baking, too. I made two of these - one for a family gathering and the other for the girls at work. Both loved them. I took the advice of others and tossed the apple slices with the sugar mixture and did not add the water, perfect!! Will be in my favorites!!"
"0","5","Was delicious...will make again. I doubled the topping and only put 1/4 cup of water in. Was the best apple crisp recipe I have made yet."
"0","5","excellant dessert will be making it again soon."
"0","4","Excellent every one loved it..."
"0","5","Red Delicious work ok too! With the most common tweaks this gets kudos from me, I had a bunch of Red and Golden off my trees to use, I did NOT peel the apples (saves time) cut the sugars in half , no extra liquid, Zested a lemon, then juiced it and poured it over apples to keep them from browning while mixing the rest, I did the Crisp part at 1.5 times more, just doubled the baking power and soda to 1/2 tsp, was plenty sweet with half brown sugar and mostly Red apples! The lemon juice and zest add nice touch, along with Vanilla Ice cream. 50 min cook time or could go with 375 at 45 min im guessing."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. Very crisp topping."
"0","5","So simple, and SO yummy! Best apple crisp recipe I've had and the only complaint I received was that there wasn't more. A friend of mine told me it was way better than her recipe because it was nice and crunchy and not soggy."
"0","5","Awesome dessert! Very easy to make and so good!"
"0","4","this was the best apple crisp that I've ever had. Two things I will change next time i make it- Cut the white sugar all together. This time I used 1/4 c. It was very sweet. I tripled the topping to make it really thick. Instead of adding 1/2 c. of water I used 1/4 c. of apple cider. Also, I will cut the amount of butter in half. This is a great recipe for a holiday or family party."
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I've ever made! I used six large Granny Smith apples and that seemed to be just the right amount. After reading some other reviews, I doubled the amount of topping Next time I will just do 1 1/2 times the amount. Keep an eye on the apples while baking. If you like them to retain some of their firmness, 45 minutes is way too long. Next time, I'll starting checking mine after 35 minutes. This has definitely become my go-to recipe for apple crisp. What a great fall treat!"
"0","5","This recipe is just what I was looking for, thank you, it is perfect."
"0","5","Smells awesome cooking! Made this to take to a friends for after dinner. Will let you know what they think."
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe! I made a few changes based on the suggestions of others. I used no water, and I used softened butter instead of melted, so I could have a crunchy topping. I cut the butter right into the oat mixture. I also used McIntosh apples, and it was very tasty!"
"0","4","This recipe would have been a bit better with way less sugar. I used granny smith apples and they are already so sweet that the 2 cups of sugar was overkill. That's my only complaint, because it still came out fantastic."
"0","5","We used honey crisp apples and it was AMAZING! Also, we used a little less than the 1/2 cup water."
"0","5","This recipe is superb! I have found my apple crisp keeper. Followed the recipe exactly as written except right before I placed the crisp in the oven, I sprinkled it with cinnamon and nutmeg. It turned out beautifully and tasted amazing! I used a local seasonal apple- Limbertwig. I was told that this apple was great for baking, the flavor is tart and juicy. Thanks to Gopher Glenn for their flavorful, yummy apples and thanks to Diane for this wonderful recipe."
"0","4","Very good recipe but a bit too watery for me. Next time I'll only use 1/2 the water. Thanks!"
"0","5","Super easy recipe and so good! My husband asks to make this all the time. It is especially good when topped with Hudsonville's apple pie ice cream (when it is in season). Vanilla is good too, but we liked the apple pie ice cream best with it."
"0","3","Whoa - that is super sweet. Way too sweet."
"0","5","Made this a few weeks ago and Wow, this was so good! I mean GOOOOOD!!! We like more of the crumb topping so I used a little less apple and then just used an extra 1/2 of the crumb topping ingredients. Was perfect for us!  Followed everything else as written except I did NOT use the water, glad that I didn't because it came out perfect!  Wish I had found this sooner in the apple season, can't wait to make again!!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!!!!! It makes like an oatmeal cookie crust on top that's just AWESOME. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"0","5","I have never made apple crisp before, but was in the mood for something warm and yummy, so I tried this one. It was wonderful!!! Even my husband loved it and he is not a big sweets fan. I followed the recipe exactly and used jonathan apples."
"0","5","Very easy to make and the whole family loved it!!"
"0","5","I made this as is and loved it. The topping was so good that I will likely double it when I make it again."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! Easy and delicious!"
"0","5","Incredible! Made this for a dinner party...served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...my friend said she didn't really care for apple dishes but she gobbled this one up...and another friend had thirds:) A true crowd pleaser! Sure to become a regular at our dinner table:) I made this recipe almost exactly...didn't really measure the apples in 'cups' but simply used a 3 lb bag of granny smiths. I may have also cooked it for a few extra minutes because the top didn't seem crisp...which I think helped create the amazing caramel-like filling! I also added a pinch of nutmeg as another reviewer suggested. But overall it is spot on and truly amazing! Oh and did I mention incredibly easy!"
"0","5","Best apple crisp ever!!! Served it with ice cream and my family loved it!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"
"0","5","This was a great crisp! I wasn't sure if it would turn out while I was baking it, because there was so much juice. When I took it out the juice soaked into the crisp and it had great flavor. My mother'n'law loved it and hubby isn't a crisp lover and he had two helpings. I used 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup and I used granny smith apples. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"0","5","superb apple crisp added cranberries and pecans for fun - 5 stars"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious. My husband loved it. I will make it again."
"0","3","I was way desapointed about this recipe... Way to sweet : ((( Way too much water, my apples were swimming on the bottom of my pan... I wont cook anymore..."
"0","5","Love this recipe...as did everyone I made it for."
"0","5","We made this recipe and we absolutely LOVED IT!!!!! We took the advice of other reviews and only used 1/4 cup water and we also tossed the apples with cinnamon sugar mixture. It came out FANTASTIC!!!!! Next time we are going to put the crumb mixture on the bottom too like other people have! This really is the best apple crisp recipe we have ever had!!"
"0","5","Delicious as is!"
"0","5","This was a wonderful dessert! We had it with Vanilla Bean ice cream. Total treat!"
"0","5","I think this recipes is almost foolproof. It's very good and very easy. I made it just as written although I think I might have had less than 10 cups of apples, so I thought I had plenty of topping as I see some reviewers have doubled the topping. Excellent!"
"0","4","This was fantastic and I will for sure make it again!!! Thank you!"
"0","5","i made double batch of crisp topping..was a big hit.."
"0","5","everyone loved it-i cut back the water.did not hurt at all."
"0","5","I have made this twice in the past week!! I followed some of the other reviews, I made a smaller batch in an 8X8 pan, used about 6 apples. After I cut the apples I put them in a long container and mixed the sugar and the cinnamon along with it. I also only used about a tablespoon of water. I also doubled the topping. The first time I used contry crock and the topping was like an oatmeal cookie, the second time I used real butter and it wasn't the same, so my advice is to use country crock!"
"0","5","This HAS to be one of the best crisp recipes EVER! I doubled the topping - left out the water - and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a tsp of vanilla - and used cortland apples :)"
"0","3","The crusty was not crispy and light for a high rating. Also the recipe should call for more water( I ADDED apple-cherry juice as a substitute and raisons to compliment the apples. Nawlinsgal"
"0","5","Simple and delicious!!!!!!! Soooooo good!"
"0","5","No changes made and it tastes great. Easy to make. Used honeycrisp apples and turns out great. Have used red delicious in the past and it came out more mushy and less sweet."
"0","4","This is a great recipe! Some friends gave us a huge bag of apples from their tree and here was the solution for using them up. Very tasty and very simple. Will try this topping with cherry pie filling sometime. I'm sure that would be wonderful too!"
"0","5","Very good! Made just as directed, no changes!"
"0","5","Delicious! Followed advice of some other reviews and omitted the water. This is a keeper! Thank you."
"0","5","This is wonderful, the kids went over the moon for this served with some vanilla ice cream. The only thing I would change is reduce the water to 1/4 cup. It was a little watery."
"0","4","Good recipe, but it had a bit too much sugar for my or my families tastes. Will be cutting the sugar in half next time."
"0","5","Really good! I made it just as the recipe states, except I halved the water, although it would probably have been fine with the entire 1/2 cup, just more saucy. Everyone in my family loved it. I liked it a lot too, just felt it was a bit too sweet. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar, for my personal taste. And it was so easy; definitely deserves the 5 star rating. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious...smelled so good while baking ! Thank you!"
"0","5","Loved it!!"
"0","5","GREAT recipe! I was going to rate it 4 stars out of 5, but then I realized that it was because I followed the advice of others by halving the water and doubling the crust. I found it came out dry and WAY too much crust to apple ratio. Next time I would add the whole 1/2 cup of water and keep the original crust, as I found it was more than enough for a 9x13 dish. Also, I might not put as many oats in. I did add 1 tsp of nutmeg and tossed the apples in the mixture before putting them in the dish. Also, I didn't cover with aluminum foil while baking, which I might do next time. I'll be making this one again soon!! Thanks!"
"0","5","We have searched and searched for an apple crisp recipe that tastes like my grandmother's. Totally nailed it. My only change is substituting brown sugar for part of the sugar. Thank you - I've had tons of compliments on this recipe. It's divine."
"0","5","Fabulous Recipe! So much so, that I had to share it on FaceBook. I suppose you could dress it up a bit, maybe add a bit of nutmeg. But really, you don't need to!"
"0","5","I just made this recipe and it was delicious. I used some suggestions from other posters and increased the flour 1T, decreased the white sugar to 1/2, tossed the apples with the dry mix before putting in pan, cut down the water to 1/4, used 4 varieties of apples as well as increased the apples to about 11 cups, and, finally, added 1/4t of nutmeg. What a disappearing act, gone quickly! This turned about better than our old family recipe! Yum"
"0","5","Very Yummy! Instead of sprinkling sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture over the apples, I coated the apples. I also left out the water. Turned out perfect!!!! My family loved it!"
"0","5","WOW...WOW....WOW!!! The words exclaimed by my husband between mouthfuls. He then requested it for Thankgiving and Christmas desert! Lol, it's only October. I couldn't agree more. By far the best desert I have ever tasted! I substituted 1/4 cup of apple cider and doubled the crumb topping."
"0","5","so easy to follow and not a tone of extra ingredients"
"0","5","Best apple crisp recipe ever. Easy to make and super yummy!"
"0","5","I looked for a recipe 4 years ago and found this one. It was such a hit I had made it with dehydrated apples I mad it again and everyone who was there wanted to know who made it I wish I could say it was my recipe but i fessed up Thank you for a great treat"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Super easy and the topping has the perfect amount of crunch to it. Not too sweet and the topping even stayed a little crunchy the next day. Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe."
"0","4","Awesome flavor! This recipe is perfect when you omit the water. I made this twice now and ommited the water the second time and it was perfect. I also added 5 cups more of the apples since I love mostly apples and the topping couldn't be more perfect .. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This is an excellent Apple Crisp. I tried it for my family and they loved it. Then I made it for dessert for a lunch for 20 people and got great reviews. This is great using Granny Smith apples."
"0","5","Perfect. I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the white sugar down to 3/4 cup. It was exactly as I hoped it would be, crumbly but not dry. It is what I remember my Mom making.  A definite keeper."
"0","4","This recipe has the best consistence, it really ends up being crispy but also juicy. Do what others suggest: add 1/4 tbspn nutmeg, half water, toss the apples in the dry mix instead of just sprinkling it, double the crust recipe. 3 cups of sugar in the whole recipe is too much though, so next time I'll double the crust recipe but keep only 1 cup of sugar on it. I used 7 granny smith apples, next time I'll go for 10, because they come out just perfect."
"0","4","just finished having this after dinner. only change I made was in the sugar /cinnamon mix. I changed the 1 cup sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I did add the 1/2 cup of water which made for a nice thick sauce. This was very yummy and definitely making it again. As for the apples used: gala,honeycrisp,macintosh and cortland."
"0","5","Oh sweet heavens this is SOO good!!!! It took a while to make because I'm uber slow at pealing apples -_- but it was worth it! Ate an entire 9'x11' pan by myself in about 3days. Only thing I added was a tiny bit of all spice over the top of the apples in the pan and a little bit of caramel syrup over the apples prior to covering them with the crumb topping"
"0","5","I've never made anything like this before, and it was delicious! I followed the recipe, except to cut the water in half, use all brown sugar, and to mix up the first bit of flour & sugar with the apples. I also cut the butter into the crumble, and it came up nice an crisp on top!"
"0","5","it's very good! just the right amount of sweet. but if you are only feeding like 4 people, you might might cut the recipe in half. the original makes a whole lot... the real problem is it's sooo good..."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious apple crsip! I used mostly Spy apples and a few Cortland. I also cut the brown sugar in the topping ingredients by half. Was perfect! Looked watery as it baked, but once it cooled it was a perfect consistency. A family favourite for sure!"
"0","5","My family loves this. It is so easy and delish. I make it just like it says to do it."
"0","5","This was the yummiest apple crisp ever!! I didn't melt the butter , just used room temp and incorporated it in the flour/ oatmeal mixture. It made a ton and my family gladly ate it for days! Good hot or cold. I plan on making it again tonight :)"
"0","5","delicious!!! I doubled the topping and thought it was a bit too much. Will defiantly make again and again!!!!"
"0","5","I followed it except used whole wheat flour and splenda brown and white sugars. Delicous! Thank you for sharing this!"
"0","5","This is the first time I've made apple crisp and it came out awesome....."
"0","5","Make this-you won't regret it!! I made it for a group of friends coming over, and one commented that this was better than apple crisp at one very famous southern/country cooking restaurant chain. I did add some allspice and cloves (I didn't have nutmeg on hand, or else I would have added that), doubled the topping (so glad I did!), and reduced the water to 1/4 cup. It was perfection! I used Gala apples, but will use Granny Smith next time. Add a scoop of ice cream on top and you have the perfect desert! It was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's delicious."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it was the best apple crisp ever! Thank you Diane!"
"0","5","THE BEST EVER....I made it for desert and i never even had left overs. I would not change a thing in the recipe."
"0","5","Is there a six star option? YUMMY and fantastic.. make sure you can share with others otherwise it will be gone in a flash! Made it the 2nd time for my sister and her family and they were all 'ooo's' and 'yumms' about it. The butter is a bit heavy in my opinion, but that's probably what makes it taste so good to. It has a great texture and is really just perfect. Eat with vanilla ice cream and wow, one of the best deserts on the planet."
"0","5","Simply the best apple crisp recipe I have ever made!!! I used McIntosh apples, omitted the water, doubled the crust, and added nutmeg to the apple mixture. I did not place the apples in the pan first. I mixed it all together and then spread it evenly in the pan. Like I said this is the best ever!!!!"
"0","5","Super easy and delicious. I was doubtful about the melted butter (vs chilled pats of butter) making a nice crumbly crust but it came out great. I added a handful of chopped walnuts to the top and like many of the other reviewers here, I left out the water and it was perfect. I used slightly less apples, since my husband and I prefer a lot of crumbly crispy crust. I also used a variety of apples. This is a definite keeper in my book."
"0","5","Soooo delicious! It was demolished in no time... I forgot to add water before I added the topping and it turned out amazing much to my delight!"
"0","4","This was good! As I like to follow directions exactly I was hesitant about not adding water like many of the reviewers suggested. I did stir my sugar mix and apples in bowl firt then added to baking dish. I added 1/2 of water that was called for on recipe and wished I didn't add any. The reason I gave 4 out of 5 is because the topping didn't come out as crumbly as I had hoped. Still taste delicious though."
"0","5","So far, this is the best apple crisp I have eaten! I only added a 1/4 cup of water since many reviews suggested it, and it came out just fine. I made the crumb topping ahead of time, so it would hold its shape, but it still turned into syrup. Next time, I'll freeze it. Anyway, thank you for this recipe! I will be making this again!"
"0","4","Was a big hit. Used Granny Smiths and Gala apples. Added some dried cranraisins and instead of the water I used about 1/4 c orange juice and a couple of heavy squirts of lemon juice. In the apple mixture, I used only half of the sugar. As far as the topping - I would increase by 1/4 recipe - half was a bit much. Top with a glob of vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","This dish did not last 5 minutes on a football Sunday buffet! So easy & quick, used pre-cut apples."
"0","3","Waaaaay too much sugar. I followed the recipe and found that it was just ok. The topping was too sweet though. Husband and daughter thought it was just ok too. I will try again with 3/4 cup of brown and white sugar."
"0","5","Simply Amazing! I did however add more Cinnamon because I like Cinnamon. Totally 5 stars!! :)"
"0","5","VERY good apple crisp. There is a good apple to crisp ratio. Excellent flavor!"
"0","5","Wonderful!!! Will def. make again! You don't need to double the topping part, I did and it was way to much. Just following the recipe as written. The only thing I changed was used softened butter instead of melted. Very flavorful!"
"0","4","Amazing! However, I can't give it a full 5 stars becuase I altered it, however the recipe as is was a great base! I am not much of a baker and this was my first real attempt at anything like this and it turned out amazing.  I used Cortland apples (a bag) and 2 Granny Smiths. I didn't add any water as I didn't need it. I used brown sugar instead of white and only used 1/2 cup in the filling (and it was still a bit too sweet for me). I doubled the crust recipe (except the sugar) and put half on the bottom of the pan and half on top. I also doubled the cinnamon and added 2 teaspoons to the crust! I baked in a glass dish for an hour, but next time I will cut the apples into thicker wedges or reduce cooking time. Overall, everybody loved this and I was impressed!"
"0","5","Excellent and simple apple crisp! It was a hit with my whole family. I'll definitely make it again. I followed other reviewers by not adding water and used less apples so that there was more crumble topping."
"0","5","I love apple crisp and I love trying out new recipes! This one has made it to te top of my must try again list!! I'd say it's my new favorite apple crisp!"
"0","5","This apple crisp was SO effing good! I made it last night with the recommendation to double the crust, and I am so glad I did! I also softened the butter rather than melting it to make the crust more crumbly. I did not add nutmeg like many people suggested because I don't care for it. It turned out so delicious, and I'm SO excited to be eating this decadent treat all weekend!!"
"0","5","This is the BEST Apple Crisp ever!! Super easy & fast. My family loved it. This is my new recipe."
"0","5","This recepie was so simple yet super delicious to make. mixed the apples together with the sugar, nutmeg,and cinnamon, added only 1/4c water, and 1/2c sugar and doubled the portions for the crust. It was AMAZING =) thank you so much for this recepie"
"0","5","So this was the first time I've tried any kind of cooked apple recipe and this one was AMAZING! I had no idea how many apples to use so ended up getting 10 pretty decent sized Granny Smiths, used all but maybe half of one, and they were pretty piled up in the 9x13 dish lol. I actually did not use the baking soda, found out too late I didn't have it, so winged it and left it out. I did use the half cup of water, I know some people were kind of 50/50 on that part of it, but it worked well for me. As far as the oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon etc...goes, I went by the measurements for the most part but fudged it a little since their were so many apples, and cooked it for about an hour. It turned out great though, will def be making it again."
"0","4","awe this was ok, i didnt think it was the best I have ever had. I will keep looking"
"0","5","so good just made this my hole family loves it its a keeper"
"0","5","My mom is allergic to gluten, so we used this as a starting recipe, and simply switched out the regular flour for gluten free and we all loved it! Even my picky father who normally refuses to eat anything that has been adapted for my mom's diet couldn't find anything to complain about."
"0","5","Very Yummy!!"
"0","5","This recipe was easy and delicious, plus it was a huge hit at the party I brought it to. I used about 10 small granny smiths and altered the recipe a tiny bit. I doubled the 'crisp' part and added a layer to the bottom underneath the fruit, then one on top. I also cubed the butter rather than melting it. Perfect for fall!"
"0","5","absolutely loved this recipe"
"0","4","I made this tonight and followed the suggestions of others to cut the water in half and add nutmeg. I'm giving the recipe 4 starsbecause with the full 1/2 cup of water, it would have been too runny. Also, it wouldn't have been as good without adding the extra nutmeg (and cardamom). The surprising thing is that I did double the crumb topping, and it was WAY too much. And I used a ton of Honeycrisp apples. Fewer apples, and I would have had to trash it. I cut the sugar in the apple mixture in half, which was perfect. I will make this again, but will go with either the original amount of topping, or 1 and 1/2 times at the most. Very good, but think twice about that topping. Doubling it almost completely overtakes the apples. Oh, and Honeycrisps are perfect for this! :)"
"0","5","Best apple crisp I have ever made! With a few changes to make it my own (and following other reviews suggestions), definitely a hit! I used a bit less white sugar and a touch of nutmeg, tossed the apples in the sugar mix and only used 1/4 cup water. I did a recipe and half of the crumble, and sprinkled more cinnamon on top. Perfect!"
"0","5","Very good Apple Crisp!! Doesn't last in my house very long!"
"0","5","Wonderful!"
"0","5","Love this! I used honey crisp apples, and skipped adding water. It comes out perfect everytime. My family loves it."
"0","5","It was delicious. My whole family loved it. my husband ate it and thought it was great and he is not an apple fan! well done."
"0","5","My family liked this. Next time will reduce the sugar."
"0","5","I read all the current reviews and decided to try this recipe. It is excellent. I made the 'crisp' by half again. Used 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal, flour and b sugar, increased the soda and b powder, added another 1/2 stick of butter. I also used Penzey's baking spice, as I do for all of my baking. Instead of water I used orange juice to keep the apples lighter in color -not that it matters. Very good crisp. Thanks for sumitting this recipe for our use."
"0","5","Awsome apple crisp. I will defintley be making this again in the future."
"0","5","I baked this today for the first time. I used apples from my apple tree in the backyard. I didn't change one thing in the recipe & it turned out great! With a family of 5, I bet this will be gone in no time flat! Thanks allrecipes for such a great, easy & tasty recipe!"
"0","5","This has to be, by far, the BEST apple crisp i have ever eaten. YUMMY!!!!!!!"
"0","5","was awesome, and so easy."
"0","5","Great recipe!! I didn't change a thing!"
"0","4","So excited with all the reviews!! Making it in 5 4 3 2 1!"
"0","5","Excellent... period!"
"0","2","Not sure if I'm just not an apple crisp kind of person but I wasn't a fan. It was way too sweet. The crust was pretty good though."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, this was so good! I used half the amount of apples (that was the amount I had) but made the full amount of the topping. My husband chopped the apples so they were more chunks than slices, but turned out excellent. I followed the other reviews and put half the topping on the bottom, and used only half the water. AMAZING. I'll definitely make it again, and I'll try it with berries, too!"
"0","4","This is so good. I tried and I don't think nothing has to be different about it. I was going to take it to work and share with my co-workers but I think I'm just taking a couple pieces for family. My son loved it a lot."
"0","5","This was so yummy!"
"0","5","This recipe is excellent. Part of what makes it so good is you can make adjustments to it to suit your own tastes. I did make it nearly as written, I just used a little less water and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples. The crumble was much simpler when using the melted butter instead of cutting it in as done in some recipes. Don't be afraid to use your hands with the topping. Everyone at work was very pleased with the results."
"0","5","Easy to make. Yummy to eat. A keeper for sure!!"
"0","5","This recipe is wonderful! I tool suggestions of other users and doubled the crust and used 1/2 cup water. Everyone in the family loved it and it is a very easy recipe. This will be my apple crisp recipe from now on!"
"0","5","Delish! It was a little watery. Next time I would cut the water in half."
"0","5","Great recipe! Thanks :)"
"0","4","Great. I did make some minor changes. The only one I would say was a must is to decrease water by half. Other changes were to my taste: add nutmeg to apples, add cinnamon to topping, decrease white sugar by half (i used granny smiths and it was too sweet for my taste)"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe!! Awesome taste! After reading reviews, I added a little less than half the water. I also added sweetened granola instead of oats (made the crust a little sweeter), substituted Crisco instead of butter, and added only about 3/4 cup sugar whenever it called for full cup. Turned out perfectly--not too sweet, but sweet eneough; just the right consistency, not to watery; and the apples were divine!"
"0","5","Holy Moley this is AMAZING! So so incredibly easy! THe only change I made was cutting the water in half. I've made this twice, and one time I didn't have brown sugar so I used a cup of white sugar and added about three tablespoons of molasses. Still tasted yum, so that's a good substitute. Absolutely fabulous."
"0","5","Have never been able to successfully make a good apple crisp, this one ended that. SOOO good. even the picky kids loved it! will definately make again."
"0","4","Loved this recipe.. I doubled the crust like I read others suggest, the only thing that I would change is to add a little less sugar as it was very sweet... but that probably was a good thing so I didn't overeat :)"
"0","5","this is one of the best crisp I have ever made.I used about 8 large granny smiths,used brown sugar in the topping and cut the butter in it as other's did.I did not change the amount of water but tossed in a few table spoons of cornstarch and pumpkin pie spice. this made it nice and thick and yummy. thank you Diane I think I found my new crisp recipe"
"0","5","Everyone loved it and said it was the best they have ever had. I would serve in small portions as it is sweet sweet."
"0","5","I made this for Valentine's Day - it's my husband's favorite dessert...SO GOOD. Great recipe - and so easy...and you are right, great served with ice cream!! Thank you for sharing!!"
"0","4","add 1/4 tsp nutmeg, mix flour sugar with apples, double crisp, chill crisp and break with fork"
"0","5","got excellent comments. i used no water and bumped up the topping by another half. awesome!!!"
"0","5","One of my favorite fall recipes using apples"
"0","5","WOW! Definitely THE best apple crisp ever!! I made it by going with what other people said by doubling the topping and cutting the water in half. Even though I decreased the water, I still had a puddle in the bottom of the pan. Next time I will just skip the water all together. Still tasted amazing though! Crowd pleaser for sure!"
"0","5","Everyone LOVES this recipe.. It's highly recommended when I go places! :) I like to mix the apples I use...Granny smith, cortland, golden delicious, and a few other great baking apples...It really gives it a distinct flavor AND texture...not all the apples cook the same!"
"0","5","This was AMAZING! I made it for my family, and everyone LOVED it! You know it's a good recipe when it can keep 10 people quiet for a good 10 minutes! : )"
"0","5","So good! Cook time needed to be longer for our oven."
"0","5","We have been looking for a great apple crisp recipe and this one is the bomb!! My hubby cooked it and it was great! He also added extra cinnamon!"
"0","5","Love this one! I only added more cinnamon."
"0","5","Delicious! I cut the recipe in half because I only had a few apples to use up. Was still very delicious!"
"0","5","Made this to use up some apples this fall, and everyone loved it. Hands down the best apple crisp I have made! The hubby and kids liked it with some vanilla ice cream, but I prefer mine with a bit of Carnation canned milk..:) May sound strange to some, but gotta try it....even if you put a little spoonful of warm crisp in a bowl and add a tiny amount of canned milk. Let it sit for a minute, then try it.....gets so creamy and yummy.....mmmm....hehehehe. Def recommend this recipe to everyone. Only thing that I 'changed' was to double the topping, as I love the crisp..:) Thanks!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! I made this for Father's Day. He and everyone else greatly enjoyed it!"
"0","4","Made this today for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful!"
"0","5","signed up just to review 5 stars. Believe these reviews, it's just great! I halved the recipe and left out the water. Used regular red apples. It came out perfect! Also, I didn't have brown sugar so I made a light brown sugar from white sugar and a little bit of molassses. So simple and delicious~~"
"0","5","I have made this twice now. And gotten rave reviews every time. It gets eatten up so quickly I wondered where it went. I just mention making it and my friend perks up and asks if I really am going to make it. I'm so going to make it again and again."
"0","5","Wonderful crispy and easy to make!...It replaced the other recipe I used to make from this site. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and did not add any water. However I added a splash of orange juice. I also doubled the quantity for the crumble mixture and added a handful of crushed pecans because my family likes it that way. I also used 2 tbsp of cold butter that I crumbled and put on top of the mix before baking. We loved the result and I am sure to make this easy recipe more often....Thank you for sharing it!"
"0","5","Very very good. Very sweet. I read the reviews and only used half of the water and doubled the topping. My husband even ate it and he normally doesn't like apple crisp. Also, stirred the apples together with cinnamon mixture to coat apples. That's it!!!"
"0","5","Halved the recipe (for the 2 of us) and followed it exactly except for using 4 large apples--instead of measuring. Topping was nice and crunchy; filling wasn't too syrupy but nice and moist. It was perfect-best crisp I've ever tasted! It was gone within 24 hours."
"0","5","I used 1/4 water and 1 tsp nutmeg I came home and my husband ate it before I got a piece, he told me it was very good!"
"0","5","Absolutely Awesome!! Every time I've made this everyone goes on and on about how awesome it is. The only thing I do is DOUBLE the topping, mmm mmm goooooood!!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe as is. I sometimes add some nuts, if I have them lying around, pecans and walnuts are both great mixed into the topping. This is a sure to please recipe that I go back to over and over again!"
"0","4","Very simple and tasty when you want something sweet. I used apples that were soft; not too fresh. Whipped cream or ice cream on top is a great addition."
"0","5","so delicious- perfection"
"0","5","Excellent dessert. I used Granny Smiths which gave it that perfect balance of sweet and tangy."
"0","4","This is so simple to make, but it was a bit watery at the bottom. I will definitely make this again, using less water, then I'm sure it will be a 5-star recipe!"
"0","5","Great recipe, the crisp topping is wonderful and it browned beautiful. Easy and great!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at baking ANYTHING from scratch and it truly turned out wonderful! I couldn't wait, as soon as it came out of the oven I had to 'test' this masterpiece...I could not put my fork down! I also halved the recipe, using 4 granny smith apples in a 8'x8' pan. However, to make it a little healthier and perhaps easier on my hypoglycemia, I substituted organic palm sugar for the white sugar on top of the apples (lower on the GI and is similar to brown sugar in taste/texture) but used brown sugar for the topping and used white whole wheat flour. I also did not add water, sprinkled a little nutmeg on top of the apples and a little cinnamon on top of the crumb crust. Tester for Thanksgiving which I plan on actually contributing to this year! A true winner!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe and easy to make. Will make again!"
"0","5","This apple crisp was amazing!! I used Granny Smith apples and omitted the water...plus, I added some nutmeg as suggested. I halved the apples as I only had 5 on hand but left the topping amount the same. It came out PERFECT!"
"0","5","I made about 1 1/2 times the crust, not quite double, and I did reduce the water to 1/4cup. I also added 1/8 tsp of ground cloves, and 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg. It was perfect!"
"0","3","Well, I guess I'm in the minority here since so many people love this recipe. I have to say I prefer my original apple crisp recipe which doesn't use Quaker oats, although I know this recipe is healthier because of it. I followed the suggestion of making twice the amount of crumble, putting it on both the top and bottom, and decreasing the amount of water. It turned out dry and there was too much crumble which hid the flavour of the apples. I'll try this again, but without twice the crumble."
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious! I made a couple very minor changes. I cut the butter in using a pastry blender. After putting the topping on, I drizzled about 1 Tbsp butter. Also to the crumb mixture I added a couple 'shakes' of each of the following: cloves, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. It was just delicious!!!"
"0","5","My favorite crisp topping recipe! this can be used with any type of fruit crisp (cherry, huckleberry, peach, etc.) I like to cut the sugar in the filling to cut back on some calories. so yum."
"0","5","To quote my fiance,'Wow, I think that's the best apple crisp I've ever had!' I also cooked these in small individual ramekins, came out great without changing the recipe one bit."
"0","5","Excellent recipe!! I made mine with the water and wished that I would have left it out like some suggested because it was kind of runny. Other than that it was easy to make and talke about great flavor! Definately a keeper."
"0","5","Made this last night. It was very good. Wasn't too sweet for us! Other reviews said about it being runny, so I just added an extra Tbsp. of flour. As soon as I took it out of the oven, it was runny, but after it cooled, it set up and was perfect! Not runny at all! I also added an extra tsp. of cinnamon in the crisp too. The crisp was delicious. Thanks for this recipe, its a keeper!"
"0","5","This was delicious, the whole family loved it. We doubled the recipe, deleted the white sugar, water and flour in the apples. The topping was sweet enough to compliment the apples."
"0","5","Awesome recipe... I agree with some of the other reviews; the amount of water can be reduced to keep it from getting a little too soupy. Or you can keep the water the same and use a straw to suck up the liquid; it is like the nectar of gods! I didn't have oats, so I crunched up some granola with almonds instead; it came out fantastic."
"0","4","We loved this recipe. Thank you for sharing it! This is how we altered it and made it delish for my family. I DO NOT add water, I also use LESS apples because my family likes the 'Crisp' aspect and not a lot of apples. - Just their preference. So I use enough apples to BARLEY cover the bottom of pan. For the crisp topping I DOUBLE the ingredients, giving it plenty of crisp to cover the apples and pan completely. When I make this dish my family finishes it off in one day and wants another made soon! Even my 3 year old LOVES it!!!"
"0","4","very good, but too sweet. I used Granny Smith apples and the topping is what I would say is way too sweet. Next time I will use only half of the sugar for the crumbs. otherwise it was great!"
"0","4","Made them for the first time last night. We loved it. I was able to prepare it while boneless breast was baking in the oven. By the time we were finished with dinner it was ready to come out of the oven. I was able to clean my kitchen while it was cooling down a bit. We served it with vanilla ice cream. The sweet crunchy deliciousness of it was almost more then I could bare. ALMOST L.O.L."
"0","4","Love this apple crisp! It came out amazing... I gave it 4 stars because the topping needed more butter than called for, otherwise it came out powdery and grainy. But once that change was made it was great!"
"0","5","I just made this earlier today. It was delicious, especially served with Vanilla Ice cream. A lot of people suggested adding Nutmeg but I think its great just the way it is. :) It is important to make sure that the apple slices (Granny Smith) are good sized. I cut the apples into quarters for the little apples and 1/8 for the larger ones. I will definitely be making this again."
"0","5","Always a winner! I made a little bit of extra topping and did add a little bit of nutmeg. I did mix the apples (Granny Smiths) with the cinnamon/sugar mixture and then put the topping on. Also, didn't melt the butter, just cut chunks working it into the topping mixture. Everyone always loves it so this is my standard crisp recipe. Great served warm with vanilla ice cream. Highly recommended!"
"0","5","Made this at work and everyone went nuts over it! It was just so yummy."
"0","5","Perfect! I cut the water in half, used Granny Smith's, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and doubled the topping to add some on top. All my family and friends love it and ask for it at any gathering we have."
"0","5","This apple crisp is seriously the best I've had. Imagine yourself wearing a thick warm sweater kicking through the leaves on a beautiful autumn New England day...now you're almost there, add this apple crisp and everything is good in the world :)"
"0","5","Delicious!!"
"0","5","AMAZING!! I made this for my sister's birthday with some vanilla ice cream, and my entire family loved it. The only change I made was adding some nutmeg and ground cloves for a little extra flavor."
"0","5","My mom said this was the best apple crisp she has ever had, even better than my grandma's! My nieces helped me make it, and they had a blast. Thanks for a very fun recipe!"
"0","5","The best apple crisp recipe! I use this one every time!"
"0","5","My mom makes this exact recipe and has shared the link with me to make. This is the quintessential autumn treat that is sure to please everyone. Yum yum!"
"0","4","Use a little less water or more flour. Was a little watery but had great flavor."
"0","4","I have made this recipe twice. Once omitting the water, soaking the apples, doubling the topping and cutting in the butter and once as the recipe is written with the exception of a splash of lemon juice in the apples and tripling the amount of cinnamon. Make the recipe as written first, it's great. Not too sweet (granny smith apples), not too runny and not lacking topping. Just right and gone in an hour."
"0","4","yummy! it was a little sweet, and the topping was a little hard to spread around since it called for melted butter, but it was delish!"
"0","5","BAKE THIS! This recipe is SO delicious. I used tart Granny Smith apples which really kick up the flavor. I also put in a lot more cinnamon than is prescribed. Finally, I doubled the amount of crumble topping- mmmmmm. Awesome Autumn recipe; I highly recommend."
"0","5","Comes out amazing every single time! was a big hit many times over =] thanks!"
"0","5","Grandiose! Don't change a thing! It's almost too simple. I used 3 very large Jonagold apples which filled the pan up about an inch and a half. Used everything else as written. Splendid flavor! Serve warm."
"0","3","This apple crisp was tasty, but too sweet for my taste (even when made with tart apples). After reading the other reviews, I doubled the topping and it was WAY too much. I like topping, but I couldn't even fit it all in the pan! I will cut back on the sugar and make the amount of topping per the recipe next time, that should make it great!"
"0","5","I made this and it was fantastic!! I took the other suggestions and doubled the topping. Delicious! I will definitely make this again and again."
"0","5","Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very tasty. We used Cortland apples fresh picked from a local apple orchard."
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic...The only this I added was a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Also I omittd the 1/2 c of water and let the apples soak in water while I mixed the rest, which was just enough moisture to make this great!"
"0","5","This is a delicious apple crisp! I did cut down the white sugar to only 1/2 cup. I didn't have baking soda so doubled the powder. Excellent!"
"0","5","Amazing as is!!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!!! Follow the recipe and you can't go wrong!"
"0","4","This was good! I used honeycrisp apples. I added 2 tablespoons cinnamon, nutmeg and a little vanilla to the apple mixture, and I only used 1/2 c brown sugar instead of 1 c white sugar. For the topping I used 1/4 c butter- came out fine!"
"0","4","This recipe was nice but I wasn't blown away by it (maybe I set my expectation too high). I made it exactly as per the recipe and it turned out well but it's not the best I've had."
"0","5","Sensational! I made this recipe as an afterthought because I felt like betty crocker as I was making dinner. I added some fresh pears too from our tree out back which gave it even more fresh flavor. Yummy!"
"0","5","Spectacular! Followed the recipe exactly, and turned out perfectly! Used Granny Smith, but I believe you can use any type of apple. Very good, and whole family liked it, so seven thumbs up!"
"0","5","This is awesome! The family loved it. We made it gluten free with gluten free all purpose flour instead. And I cut the sugar in half because our apples were really ripe. I just wished I had doubled the topping like others said they did. We will be making this again real soon."
"0","4","I just made this tonight! I doubled the topping and added 1 tb of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the apple mixture. I also used Jonathan apples and didn't add any water since the natural juices from the apples was plenty of liquid. Baked for about 45 minutes and it looks and smells delicious!"
"0","5","SO dang good! We used 10 green apples, diced. Mixed them around with the flour/cinnamon sugar mixture and added 1/4 cup water. We accidentally used only about 6 tbs butter in the topping, but it still turned out deeeelicious. Thank you!"
"0","5","This was by far the BEST apple crisp I have ever had I used macoun apples."
"0","5","Great recipe and very easy! I am not sure what all purpose apples are but I substituted them for freshly peeled Gala apples and turned out great. I would also like to try next time with walnuts."
"0","5","Yummy! I used just-picked Spartan apples, which were very sweet and juicy, so I omitted the water. I also doubled the topping (mostly because I really love the crisp topping!!). Turned out great! I didn't find it too sweet as others have suggested. Next time I will use a harder apple as suggested in the above reviews, as mine turned out quite mushy."
"0","5","This was great! I used 1/4 cup less white sugar and make 1.5x the amount of topping (based on other reviews) and topped it with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream.... Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","Delicious! I misplaced the apple crisp recipe that I've used for years so I gave this one a try. The result was the best apple crisp I've ever made. I used golden delicious apples and the only change I made was to eliminate the 1/2 cup water, as recommended by other reviewers. It turned out perfectly!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exact with the exception of the water. I omitted it like everyone said to and it came out awesome! I used Granny Smith apples so the sweetness was just right."
"0","5","Classic apple crisp - perfect recipe"
"0","5","Fabulous! And the smell of Fall indoors, cinnamon/apples is great!! This recipe is exactly like my Grammy used to make!! yum!"
"0","4","This is awesome! I cut the recipe in half, and the apples were a bit watery. I also didn't have quick oats so I used 2 packets of breakfast oatmeal and 1/2 cup flour. The secret kicker was a bit of almond extract to the topping, that is a MUST!!! Delicious!"
"0","5","This is absolutely wonderful!!! Very easy to make. This ones a keeper!!"
"0","5","All I can say, is: AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! I took some reviewers suggestions and reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. sugar. It was perfect. No need to look any futher for an apple crisp recipe!"
"0","4","Wonderful apple crisp, just a little too sweet, and this is from a 'sweet tooth'. Next time I will use a 1/4 c less of both sugars otherwise it was a huge hit!"
"0","5","Perfect apple crisp! Wouldn't change a thing."
"0","5","I used Granny Smith apples and added 1/2 the amount of water as suggested and it was VERY runny, but still delicious. I also had to double the topping since the recipe amount didn't even come close to covering the apples. Next time I will omit the water completely and once again double the topping and it will be perfect. Everyone that came for dinner loved it."
"0","5","This recipe was very good! I used half of the water and next time will not use any water. The topping did not look like enough so I doubled it. Next time I will use 1.5 of what the original recipe calls for. I added chopped pecans to the topping. The family loved it! It was gone in a flash!"
"0","2","It was ok tooo much sugar and I have a sweet tooth."
"0","5","Oh my!!! This sounds so wonderful! My family is nuts about apple crisps and cobblers of all kinds!! I am curious about the baking soda & powder. What does it 'do' for this crisp? I have never seen it before in any crisps I've made. I cant wait to try it!!!!"
"0","4","It doesn't need the water or at least only use half(and maybe use apple juice instead) I added a little cinnamon to the topping. Other wise it was simple to make and good."
"0","5","This was absolutely amazing!!! The first time I made it for a family gathering I was asked for the recipe! Delish!!!"
"0","2","I was disappointed in the results I got. I followed the recipe and it came out way too sweet and very watery. I used Honeycrisp apples which are not overly sweet in themselves and rather dry so I didn't anticipate any problems. :("
"0","5","Excellent recipe....one of the best!!"
"0","5","Seriously delicious! I absolutely loved it! I only added 1/2 cup of water and I added a few dashes of nutmeg and it was delectable! This quickly became a family favorite! Thank you!"
"0","2","I was so disappointed with this recipe. I should have omitted the water like so many other reviewers. When I took it out of the oven, there was still water in the pan - very unappetizing. The apples were not seasoned enough. However, the topping was delicious. I made an apple crisp recipe a few weeks ago that was divine! I couldn't remember which recipe I'd used. This wasn't it! Ugg! What a waste of apples!"
"0","4","Tasted very good. However I thought it was a bit too sweet. Next time I will leave out the sugar in the apple mixture."
"0","5","Very Good!"
"0","5","Such a yummy recipe! Moist and delicious, yet had some crunch which i loved!"
"0","5","Yummy. No other words are needed."
"0","4","soo good! I found that adding 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the mix over the apples (like many other users suggested) was great, as well as eliminating the water. I also doubled the crust recipe... although twice the recipe was a little too much. Otherwise, really great recipe!"
"0","5","This is absolutely delicious. I followed the advice of others and added a little nutmeg to the apples. I also added a touch of clove which was good. I added very little water - actually used the water to wash the sugar and spice out of the bown and put it in with the apples. For the crisp part, I doubled the recipe which others suggested. Although it was delicious, it was a bit heavy on the crisp, so I'd suggest doing the recipe with 1.5 times the crisp. So delicious though!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp ever!!!!! DON'T put less h2o in it.. it's perfect. I'd say the baking powder and soda is pretty much worthless. It didn't rise the leased bit!"
"0","5","My husband loved this! I used granny smith apples and added nutmeg to the apples. Also I intended to use 1/4 cup of water but I forgot it all together and my husband was glad I did. He says apple crisp can be very runny and that's why he liked this one so much is because it wasn't runny at all. Also added some cinnamon to the crust. I used a bag of granny smith apples (10 smaller ones) and the topping was the perfect amount! Also cut the butter into the topping, added some vanilla, white sugar and just a tad of nutmeg."
"0","5","Yummy! I halved the recipe as I only had a dozen small apples. We three LOVED this!! I can see where the 2000 - 5 star ratings came from. Excellent as written!"
"0","5","WOW! This recipe tastes wonderful and the fact that it's QUICK AND EASY made me love it even more."
"0","3","I really wanted to like this recipe but it just didn't do anything for me. I followed the recipe exactly but left out the water."
"0","5","Always comes out great."
"0","3","I am a sweet lover but this was just way to sweet and I reduced the sugar by half cup already can't imargine if I didn't. It was also missing something maybe some fresh squeezed lemons on the apples or just something I also think the best apple for the raito of sugar will be granny smiths because of it's tartness it will ne perfect for this recipe...I used golden delicious"
"0","5","WOW the kids love this. I use homemade canned apple pie filling and take out the water from the recipe. Tastes great, wonderful treat!"
"0","3","I'm only giving this a three star. Most of the reason is my own mistake--I used canned apple pie filling. I was so hungry for apple crisp and didn't have any fresh apples in the house. So I substituted canned--NEVER AGAIN. The crumb topping was a little too sweet for me. Will try again--maybe this weekend--have granny smith apples. Gonna add more oatmeal and less sugar."
"0","5","Yummy. I had a craving for this, and it fit the bill. Just a basic, classic apple crisp."
"0","5","I make this all the time and it is SOOO good. I modify this recipe by adding a splash of nutmeg and no water."
"0","5","This was really easy and tasted great. Hubby mentioned it could have been a little better if I didn't use Red Delicious."
"0","4","I liked the taste, but I felt I was eating sugar with apples! (and I have a very sweet tooth) I made half the recipe and used 5 1/2 medium granny smiths apple. Next time I'm cutting both the white sugar and the brown sugar by half!"
"0","4","It was delicious but I made changes and it needs a couple more. I used four pears, 1/2 cp sugar, and 1/4 cp water, next time no water if I'm using pears. I used all the same amounts for the topping but used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar and 5 tbsp butter. Next time I will only use 4 tbsp butter and a pastry cutter made all the difference with the topping."
"0","5","YUMMY!!! I only had 6 apples (3 granny smith & 3 jazz) for about 7 cups of apples. I used slightly less of the water and white sugar, everything else I did as the recipe called for. Plenty of 'crisp', not too sweet, not to tart. Very good!! Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!"
"0","5","This is wonderful! I did as one of the reviewers suggested and mixed the sugar / cinnamon / flour with the apples. Also added a dash of nutmeg. I only used 1/4 cup of water. And I cut the butter in with the topping rather than melting. This is delicious! Warm with vanilla ice cream = heaven!"
"0","5","nummy!"
"0","5","Made this for Valentines day dinner, didn't change a thing and was absoultley delicious. Marj/Alberta"
"0","5","The best apple crisp I have ever made!"
"0","5","I used a smaller pan with 2 quarts of canned apples, the same amount of topping. It was great, everyone loves it. thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This was great! Sweet and delicious! :D"
"0","5","This turned out great, just what I was hoping for! Delicious. I had never made apple crisp before. I cut the recipe in half, used a square glass pan, and forgot to add the water. I agree, the water is not necessary. I also coated the apples in the flour mixture, as someone suggested."
"0","4","No extra water needed. I would add another teaspoon of cinnamon and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup. I used home canned apples and it only needed to bake for 30 minutes."
"0","5","Leave out the water and double the topping. Have made this 5+times already and it always comes out great."
"0","5","I can't get enough. family loved it!"
"0","5","My family really liked this recipe. I made according to the directions and it came out perfectly. Other reviewers stated their recipe came out too watery. I didn't experience that. There was some juice in the bottom of the pan, but not enough for me to take much notice. However, when I added the water, I poured it very slowly and evenly over the cinnamon and sugar that was on the apples. I also let the water sit on the mixture for a few minutes while I mixed up the topping. This one is definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Excellent!! I actually used 1 can of Lucky Leaf's Apple pie filling and used the topping below and it was delicious! I didn't bake as long since apples were already soft so I would say I baked for 15-20 minutes..just enough time to brown the topping. We added a scoop of vanilla yogurt. yum!!!"
"0","5","Love this recipe. Didn't change a thing and love the results!"
"0","5","My boyfriend went back for seconds; he rarely does that. I doubled the amount of sauce, because I like it saucy. I had success using the same amount of farm-raised honey instead of brown sugar, and the same amount of canola oil in substitute for the butter. Also, I highly recommend Saigon cassia cinnamon... wow!"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! Some claimed it was too sweet...come on people, live a little:-) Probably used too sweet an apple. Anyway, good job Diane!"
"0","4","This turned out really well. The only change I made was to scale the recipe down to 4 servings since there are only 2 of us! I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was delish! It was a little sweet, maybe I would use a little less sugar next time, but on the whole this recipe was great!!"
"0","3","The recipe is more like 3 1/2 stars. I doubled the crust based on user reviews but found that with 2x the crust the 1 cup of sugar in the apples was WAY too sweet. Next time I will cut it down to 1/2 cup and keep the crust doubled. An addition I added was 1/4 cup of dried cranberries, they got all nice and juicy and it was really yummy. I also cut down the water to 1/4 cup. With changes, will be a 5 next time,"
"0","5","This crisp was absolutely amazing! I read the comments after I made it and was a little nervous about the amount of water added, I put in a half cup just like the recipe said, contrary to the reviews which said not to add the entire amount, anyways it still turned out incredible and I will definetly be using this recipe for all my future apple crisp ventures"
"0","4","Very good for company in the winter. Used 1/2 Jonathan and 1/2 Macintosh apples. A little sweet for my taste but everyone loved it!"
"0","5","I used macintosh apples because that is what I had. Also, baked in a glass pie plate since I think the round pie plate looks better. Didn't add water (macintosh are juicy), added the 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 TBL. lemon juice. All that was mixed in a plastic bag with the apples so there is no bowl cleanup. The second mix I did put some on the bottom. The rest on the top was alot since I put in the round pan (should have put more on the bottom layer). Great yummy results!"
"0","5","I made this for my mommy buddy for a playgroup and she loved it. I mixed the apples with the sugar/flour/water/cinnamon as it seemed the right thing to do and turned out great. I used golden delicious apples but I'll probably use granny smiths next time since the goldens seemed a bit bland. Also, I'd reduce the water to a 1/3 cup as the apples are swimming in liquid w/this recipe. I like sauce a little thicker. Definitely a keeper though."
"0","5","I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and reduced the water to 1/3 cup--YUM!"
"0","5","Made this today and it turned out great! I didn't change anything just doubled the topping and mixed the cinammon and sugar mixture with the apples; didn't sprinkle it on as the recipe states...My fiance gave it 2 thumbs up!"
"0","5","Easy, fresh, and so good!"
"0","5","This is a delicious recipe. The only change I make is to decrease the brown sugar to 3/4c as the topping was a little too sweet for me. I made it several times this fall per my 5 yr old daughter's request."
"0","5","Delicious! Used granny smith apples, the topping turned out so well, it was a hit! Will probably use less water next time, it bubbled over a bit, and then when it cooled, it sloshed over the edge during transport in the car."
"0","5","I made this with a combination of apples I got at a local orchard...it was outstanding! Everyone who tried it agreed it was the best apple crisp they'd ever had. My mom asked me if there was caramel in it - she said it had such a deliciously caramel flavor...the only thing I changed was I probably only used about 6 or 7 apples...I just kept putting them in till it looked like the right amount. I thought 10 would've been a bit excessive. I also only added 1/4 cup water to keep it from being too runny. Some of the reviews said to double the topping...so unneccessary in my opinion! It had a delicious and plentiful topping as directed. Thank-you for the yummy recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe was so easy to make and with such a simple list of ingredients. My family loved it!!!"
"0","5","Sooo! Yummy! I had some old apples that needed to be used so chose this recipe since the 10 apples would help fill my need. I made it out of necessity, but what a wonderful surprise... The only thing I would change is to add pecans to the topping mixture, but it is wonderful without."
"0","3","As far as apple crisp recipes go, this one is just fair. Perhaps the ingredient list is ok, but the preparation method leaves too much sugar on top. Next time I'm going to mix the sugar in with the apples."
"0","5","My first time making apple crisp and it turned out extremly good! Will make again and again!"
"0","4","Wonderful recipe! Friends loved it, but it was a bit too watery. I'll try this in the future with no water--the apples ended up producing even more water--and I'd like to try doubling the crust (which was extremely good, I only wished it was crispier and less crumbly)."
"0","5","Wow! This is sooooo good. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and splenda brown-sugar blend instead of brown-sugar. 1/2 cup of water for a double batch is necessary due to use of splenda. Yum, yum, yum! Hubby is already asking when I will make it again."
"0","4","I made this for Thanksgiving and while it was tasty Im going to continue to look for another recipe like this."
"0","5","This was great! I did it exactly like written except I added a cup of chopped pecans to the topping mixture. It was divine!"
"0","5","Delicious - a huge hit! I doubled the crumble recipe as suggested by others, but found that I maybe used 3/4ths of the amount. I could have added the rest but it seemed just too much. You could always layer the crumble as well if you double it. WIll definitely make again and again!"
"0","5","Best recipe EVER!!!!"
"0","5","I was craving apple crisp, but had never made it before, and this recipe certainly didn't disappoint! No need to try any more recipes, this one is great. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and doubled the topping and also halved the water in the apple mixture. I've made this twice now, once with Galas and once with Granny Smiths, and I think I actually prefer the Galas. I cut down on the sugar a bit when I used the Galas, and it was really great. Though if you prefer a less sweet apple crisp, go with Granny Smiths. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!"
"0","4","This was my first time making apple crisp and I found this recipe SUPER easy and my boyfriend loved it! I made mine in an 8x8 dish. The only thing I would change for the size of the pan is reduce the amount of white sugar used. Also, I didn't use any water and it still turned out amazing. :)"
"0","5","This is THE BEST crisp topping ever. I just use whatever fruit I have and this topping makes it fantastic. I'd give it 10 stars if I could"
"0","5","I bought a bunch of apples that were no longer 'perfect'. I made this recipe with different apples and it turned out delicious! Because it was Thanksgiving, I threw in a handful of cranberries.I made a recipe and a half of the 'crisp' part. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"
"0","4","This was good. The topping could use a lil work. it was really hard and almost crunchy. It was still good. I used 4 granny smiths and baked it in an 8x8 dish. It fit perfectly. Serving this with ice cream is a must!"
"0","5","This was delicious! I have been looking for a basic, crispy apple crisp for a long time. This is the one! You can spice it up all you want, or just leave it as is. Everyone loved it!"
"0","5","Absolutely amazing! I used granny-smith apples and double the amount of crust. Everyone loved it! It was even tasty warmed-up the next day. Will definitely make this again."
"0","4","I followed ALL the suggestions by other reviewers. Used granny smith apples, 1/4 cup water, nutmeg.... this recipe gets 4 stars because the crust was DRY. It looked like quaker instant oatmeal before you added the water. After adding the butter to it, it was still dry, so i doubled the butter, it was still too dry. Next time I will add water until it's at least crumbly and crust-y."
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe! I thought the proportions for the topping were sufficient w/o doubling (unless you have a big sweet tooth). I did reduce the water to 1/4 cup, which was perfect."
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious! I used 11 apples but other than that followed to a T. Raves!!"
"0","3","good! cut recipe in half and made in 8x8 pan (used about 1 1/2 times the amount of topping, didn't melt butter, just cut in). The flavor was good and tasted yummy served warm with vanilla ice cream. Used golden delicious and i think next time i would use a more sour apple like granny smith. I rated it a 3 only because i think it was missing something that gave it that extra punch... more spices maybe? or maybe just the more sour apples will do?"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. I added fresh blackberries with the apples and it turned out wonderfully delicious!"
"0","5","I made this for my husband's annual thanksgiving lunch potluck. It was delicious! I did cut the water in half, cut the sugar in the apples in half and doubled the crust. Next time I would use 1 1/2 times the crust instead of 2 times, as I felt the crust was a bit too thick. Overall, I felt it was better than apple pie!"
"0","5","So delicious! Even my mom who has made her own recipe for years asked me for this recipe! I followed other reviews - mix apples with sugar mixture instead of sprinkling and double the topping. I've also made an 8 x 8 pan by halving recipe and even made mini servings for me and my hubby. Can you tell I like this??"
"0","5","I live with an apple crisp fanatic. I made this for him and he was very impressed and it got rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly but left out the baking soda because I didn't have any. Perfect easy recipe just the way it was written!"
"0","4","I think this should have been baked a bit longer as the apples I used were still crunchy. I added some crushed cinnamon graham crackers for extra flavor. I would probably also double the topping next time. Otherwise, this is a great recipe!"
"0","5","Great recipe!! I did follow others reviews. I did not add any water and I did add nutmeg. I will bake it a little longer next time. A keeper !!"
"0","5","Very good. Followed suggestions: no water, double the crumble mixture (1/2 on bottom). Very tasty!"
"0","5","Very, very good recipe. Definitely a keeper. I kept everything the same but I reduced the water to 1/8, not bad, not too runny but next time I think I'll leave it out. I used Granny Smith apples and added some nutmeg to the apples and doubled the toppping, perfect!! Thanks a bunch my family loves it!!!"
"0","4","Very good, very easy, very sweet."
"0","5","Delicious! Followed exactly as written."
"0","5","I really enjoyed this recipe. I did however leave out the flour and water that you put in with the apples. If I had put the water in it would have been way too waterey for my liking."
"0","4","I would give it five stars but I think the water made it too runny for my tatse. The other reviews were correct in that no water is really needed to make it really good. Next time I will double the crust like someone else suggested and put a layer on the bottom and one on top and omit the water"
"0","5","Awsome crisp recipe, I used to use a different one, but this is by far the best. I have made it at least 7 times this year. I just add a little lemon zest to the apples and cinnimon to the topping."
"0","5","I recently made this using Northern Spy apples which I consider the absolute best for cooking and baking. I do not like my cooked apples to be hard but prefer an apple that cooks through but is not mushy. I doubled the topping recipe and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again."
"0","4","Very good, but too sweet. Wish I listened to other reviews and decreased sugar. Served with vanilla ice cream and it saved it...without it it would have been way too sweet to eat. I also made another half batch of the topping...that's the best part! : )"
"0","5","LOVE IT!!! I double the crust part of this and make a top and bottom crust with the apples in between. :) YUM"
"0","5","this was easy and tasted wonderful. i would skip the water tho or add only 1/4 cup. my neighbor loved it to. thanks for the great recipie."
"0","5","Made 2x this year. Good!"
"0","5","Fantastic! Even my picky parents loved this! I added less sugar than suggested. I used a variety of apples, some of which were tart. It worked out fine. I added all of the water which I was glad about since it helped during reheating. Thanks so much for a great recipe! I will make again and again."
"0","3","i liked this recipe and was excited to make it for its crunchy topping. my family thought it was pretty good but could b much better. Some of their complaints included that the topping was too sweet (which i disagreed with)and that the apples could have been better. I sliced th apples too thin however and they would have been better a bit chunkier. The next day though I thought it tasted better cold."
"0","5","This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I took others advice & doubled the crisp topping. It turned out perfectly! Thank you!"
"0","5","This was awesome! I never made apple crisp before, but I will be making it often now! I used granny smith apples and the only thing I changed was using half the amount of water (1/4 C) and adding a pinch of nutmeg to the cinnamon mixture. I love sweets, but it was a little too sweet, even for me, so next time I will use 1/2-3/4 cup of white sugar. Thanks for the post, I will be making this often!"
"0","5","Oh, This is soooooo good! My 4 year old neice and I enjoyed making this. So easy to make. I did what some of the other reviews said and only put 1/4 cup of water. Let it sit before serving and then it's not too runny. My 5 yearold already wants me to make it again."
"0","5","This is such a wonderful recipe and so easy. My husband and I ate it all week. Highly recommend trying this yourself!"
"0","5","I cut this recipe in half, used 4 Granny Smith apples in an 8x8 glass pan. I also used the normal amount of topping that you would use if you were making the whole recipe. This was AMAZING!!! I highly recommend it as a delicious fall treat."
"0","4","I really liked this apple crisp. It was nice and hearty and tasted great with vanilla icecream. Perfect size for larger families. I made a few changes and would suggest a few. I read the other reviews and I add nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon/flour mixture. I tossed the apples in the spice mixture before putting them in the dish. I decided that the topping wasn't enough so I made one and a half of the amount. That was plenty. Next time I will cut the white sugar in half and I will decrease the brown sugar by 1/4 cup. This crisp was very very sweet, a little too much. I will also listen to the other reviews next time and cut the water down to 1/4. I can't wait to try this recipe again!"
"0","5","This IS THE GO-TO recipe on this site for apple crisp! Yummy!! I even forgot the water and it is still so delicious... it would be even more 'saucy' if I had added the water, but it is still a 5 star plus plus plus on my list!"
"0","5","AMAZING!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out really good. I would, however, cut down on the water depending on the type of apple used. I used GALA apples which seem to be more of a juicer apple. Would definitely make this again!"
"0","5","This is a great apple crisp recipe and very easy to make. I reduced it to 4 servings so the recipe would make enough for two people. It is so yummy served with caramel ice cream!"
"0","3","This was delicious. The kids however would have preferred more crisp on the top."
"0","5","very good, I cut the water in half as others suggested."
"0","4","Just made this last night and boy was it good! I did however cut down on white, brown sugar by half and butter by 1/3 to make it healthier and I thought it was perfect! And yes, I did double the topping as well."
"0","4","Very good. I made 1.5 times the topping though. That's the part everyone likes anyway, right?"
"0","4","I cut the water in half and also cut the sugar in half, but it was still too sweet for my liking. otherwise delicious."
"0","5","WOW was this apple crisp delicious!! I cut the water in half like other reviewers recommended and it was perfect. Some of the apple slices were thicker and came out a bit crunchy. Next time I'll make sure to slice them thin. Definite keeper in my book!"
"0","5","This is truly the best apple crisp I've ever had. I followed reviewers' recommendations to cut the water in half; I also squirted a bit of fresh lemon juice onto the apples. I used tart granny apples and 3/4 c. sugar. The topping is fantastic. This is truly one of the recipes on this site I've found."
"0","5","I am notorious for being a horrible baker, but this recipe came out perfect. Delicious!"
"0","4","I made this over the weekend, and it was good, but I would definitely take other reviewers suggestions and reduce the water (or not add any at all) I also thought it was a little too sweet for my taste. But it was easy to make and other then being a little watery and sweet we loved it."
"0","5","This is not greasy as many other recipes out there. Apples come thru beautifully, not overpowered by spices. Thanks so much!!!"
"0","5","Excellent! I've been making apple crisp all my life but thought I would try something different--best I've had. THANK YOU!"
"0","5","My boyfriend made this and it was delicious!! He followed the recipe to a 'T' and served it warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was a tasty treat!"
"0","2","I was so excited about this recipe -- feeling it had to be fool proof with all the positive reviews. I prepared as stated with a few suggestions taken from other reviewers(added vanilla, used OJ instead of water, used all brown sugar instead of white sugar), and it was still waaaaaaay too dry for my liking, even with the dollop of decadent gourmet caramel ice cream. Boyfriend liked it, and guest liked it, but since I know that better exists, I will either search out other recipes or tweak this one with more brown sugar and liquid to get it to the consistency that is more visually and tastefully appealing."
"0","5","Absolutly delicious!! My fiance said it was the best he'd ever had. The only things I did different is that I used a few less apples and I doubled the topping and added cinnamon. The apples came out really tart for macintosh but everyone else thought that they were perfect!!! Definatly my go to recipe!!"
"0","4","Easy and very tasty but not perfect. Apples turned very mushy. Will have again...might cook less."
"0","5","I love apple crisp so much, and i have always just free handed it before, but this time I decided to follow a recipe. I picked this one because of all the great reviews, and I'm so glad I did, it turned out perfect! I did make more topping."
"0","5","This crisp was SO good I am actually craving it! It was easy to make, and really delicious. I took it to a party, and several people asked to take some home just to have some more. Would make again for sure. Maybe today!"
"0","3","it wasn't bad, but i took the advice of many reviews and cut the water down, which then made my crisp really dry? i'll probably make a few changes next time. but it's a good basic recipe."
"0","5","Omit the water! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in both the mix & topping. I also added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts to the topping. Must have it with vanilla ice cream! Great comfort food on a chilly night!"
"0","5","Excellent! Easy and delicious. Made it for a crowd of 50, and they all loved it."
"0","4","Very good! I followed other reviews and cut back on the white sugar and did not add water. It turned out great!"
"0","4","very good just be sure to remove all seeds!"
"0","2","My family and I found this recipe to be way too sweet unfortunately. Other than that, it was a good recipe overall."
"0","5","Great recipe! I've made it a couple times now. Tonight I realized at the last second that I didn't have brown sugar so used white with a bit of molassas. Since I was already deviating from the recipe, I also thew in a 1/2 t cinn., dash of nutmeg, and 1/4 c wheat germ. Worked like a charm! I also used just a few T water and I liked the consistency a lot better."
"0","5","It turned out great all three times I've made it. I put a little less sugar in it because my family said it was a bit too sweet. But overall we loved it."
"0","5","Yum, Yum, Yum! Nothing else to say really. I didn't make any changes and this recipe is FABULOUS! The only thing that would have made it better was ice cream. I think if you had double the topping like some people said it would have been too much. This recipe has a nice ratio of topping to apples."
"0","5","The topping is perfect! My family raved over this apple crisp. It's definitely a keeper. As many of the other reviewers said, do not add water. It is not necessary. I use 4-5 large apples and the 1 cup sugar and lots of cinnamon and it turns out perfect every time with no water. Thanks!"
"0","5","This recipe was delicious! I made it for my husband following the ingredients and instructions to a 'T' and he loved it! He even took some to his mother and her husband because he wanted to share the goodness! Wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","Delish. Cut the recipe in half, used 6 apples: 3 honeycrisp and 3 granny smith. Added fresh nutmeg to the apples and a dash of cinnamon to the crumble topping. Excellent served with dulce de leche ice cream."
"0","5","So very good! Made first time as directed and was very watery. Second time I didnt add any water (used macs) and came out so good and caramel like!"
"0","5","This is excellent! I do agree that the water should either be cut down (or even cut out completely). I had a little pool of water at the bottom of my pan. Still fantastic and I'll be making this again!"
"0","5","Delicious! I made half the recipe in a 9x13 baking dish, and my husband loved it as much as I did!"
"0","5","yummmy...yummy...yummmy...Luved this recipe. I had soo many apples in my fridge I didnt know what to do with them... if I made pie I wud eat the whole pie myself since my husband is not that into pie. so I cam across this recipe and well the ratings and reviews were all positive.I didnt change a thing. I used whatever apples I had, a few galas and red delicious.I used probably 7-8 apples and will use more next time. I like more apples since they do shrink when baked.I did add a cup of raisins, walnuts and a fresh grating of nutmeg. um ummmm ummm delicious. I can't stop sneaking spoonfuls. It's definetly great in the fall season.. warm and delicious.thanks. will make again and again."
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I've ever had! I didn't change a thing when I made the recipe, however next time I would add more cinnamon and brown sugar for the bottom part (the apples I used didn't have the best taste in the world)"
"0","5","I made this and it turned out perfect thanks for the awsom recipe."
"0","5","This is an exceptional simple recipe. I have tried many apple crisps and my company and I loved it. I would add 1\4 cup water-just a bit to keep it moist while baking. 3\4cup sugar is optimal here making the tart-sweet ratio perfect. I used 5 granny smiths but will use 6 next time. I made double batch of topping but used about 1 and 1\4 of it on top. I froze the additional topping for a smaller portion next time. I used 1\2 cup melted butter in the topping that I didn't freeze. I would have ice cream next time but not on top. The topping is too good to ruin it w ice cream on top of it. GREAT RECIPE!"
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious and exactly what i was looking for. With apple crisp, i think the more simple the recipe is ... the better! This straight forward recipe is PERFECT if your looking to prepare a classic fall dish with little fuss. I did not change anything about the recipe except cut it in half because there are just two of us. Looking back, i should have made the whole batch ... it lasted mere minutes! SIDE NOTE - I made with Jonathon apples which i don't believe are 'typical' cooking apples. It added a little kick and turned out real nice!"
"0","4","This recipe was good. I did have to make a few adjustments though, doubled the oat topping, used cold butter instead of melted butter, reduced the water to 1/4 cup(will eliminate it completely next time), mixed the cinnamon sugar mix with the apples. With these changed its a 5 star but as is its only 4. Good though made it for thanksgiving dessert and everyone loved it. Thanks :)"
"0","4","Very yummy! The apples I used must have been very juicy as there was a lot of liquid in the crisp at the bottom."
"0","5","Great recipe! I make this all the time, but I keep the peels on the apples. Gives it extra texture and keeps more of the nutrients in there. It's also great with pears!"
"0","5","Very good, especially with Granny Smiths. I omitted the water but I won't next time, it was a bit dry without it. This will be my new standard recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I just tasted a bit of the finished product! It is awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except cut down on the water to 1/4 c as others have suggested. Very good recipe.. I will be making this again I am sure! Thanks for posting!"
"0","5","Yum! I halved the recipe for a smaller group of people, left the skin on the apples and served it topped with vanilla ice cream. Easy and impressive dessert. Thanks!"
"0","5","I have made this many times. I always look forward to Fall to make this perfect dessert."
"0","4","Very good, however, I did not add the water at all....decreased the white sugar to 3/4c. and added some cinnamon to the topping. I used Cortland, Macintosh, and Gala apples from the orchard. Thanks!"
"0","5","i love it,my family approves it,simply delicious & easy to make:)i made it way easier by not peeling the apples i just cut them in slices and follow the directions,i would save this recipe,it's sooo yummy.thanks"
"0","5","I cut the apples to 7 C and added 2 C blueberries. Yum!"
"0","5","Excellent easy recipe to build from.Im gluten intolerant so I use my Gluten Free bake mix and I used a mix of 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda. I used 8 Cortland apples and doubled the topping. Instead of the half cup of water I used 2 tbs of Agave nectar and also tossed the apples in 2 tbs of lemon juice mixed with 1 oz of water. Delicious and lower carb!"
"0","5","WOW! This really is a 'TO-DIE-FOR' recipe! I made it last night using 8 apples (Fiji and Red Delicious), reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of Allspice and tossed apples in the dry mixture along with some raisins prior to pouring only 1/4 cup of water to it. Also double crumb mixture like others (except butter) and baked for 55 minutes. I got a crumbly top, little crunchy apples and highly aromatic Apple Crisp as supper! These are also good for breakfast next morning… Definitely a keeper!!"
"0","4","This recipe is delicious as is, and I've made it a few times as is. This weekend, I made it for a cookout with a few additions (2 more good shakes of cinnamon, 3 good shakes each of cloves and ginger; tossed the apples in the dry mixture to coat; only 2 T water) and people were LITERALLY eating it right out of the bowl...what a compliment! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I made this exactly as written but used a 3 lb bags of Macintosh apples(about 9 cups total). Oops, & I doubled the topping because I like it on the bottom too. It was UNBELIEVABLY good! It was perfection!"
"0","4","This was really great. After reading all of the reviews, I used a bit less liquid, and I regret it. I will follow the recipe next time and the only sub I will make is apple juice for the water."
"0","5","great! except i used canned peaches instead! one 29 oz container, and made the crisp as described but added a little soymilk to moisten it a bit, i think my oven runs hot because it was quite dry topping but still good! will use again! :)"
"0","5","I made this recipe the other day for my family. They LOVED it! I made all the changes that Ally99 suggested and it was PERFECT! Thank you so much! :)"
"0","5","Diane, you've got a winner with this one! Made it exactly by the recipe and will make again~"
"0","5","Awesome! Maybe next time I'll add some nuts or raisins but it's perfect as is too."
"0","5","This recipe is incredible. I only made a few alterations. I doubled the crumb mixture, as so many suggested. I also only added 1/4 cup of water because I sliced my apples on the thin side. Lastly I added just a touch of nutmeg. This was by far the best apple crisp recipe I've ever had. Thanks for sharing."
"0","4","I thought this was great.....even though I forgot the water...oops. I also thought htere was way too much sugar...I 1/2 the recipe and that would be a whole cup of sugar in the entire recipe...gross. So I just scanted the sugar portions and thought it was wonderful, especially with vanilla ice cream."
"0","2","Doubled the topping; way too sweet even though I used tart Granny Smiths. Might be ok if you used an entire package of whole cranberries."
"0","5","Delicious! I follwed recipe and it was so sweet and yummy. I forgot to buy ice cream so I topped with a bit of flavored coffee creamer (pumpkin spice flavor). We had it for dessert last night and when I got up this morning the entire pan was gone!! My kids loved it."
"0","5","Just Delicious!"
"0","5","Easy! My first attempt at making a crisp and it was so easy! Came out super delicious. I don't really like apple pie but this stuff was amazing!"
"0","5","Very, very good. If you like a little syrup on the bottom use 1/4 cup of water. If you want it to be more like a cobbler add 1/2 cup water. I used 1/4 cup-not to dry or to runny. Wonderful, it was gone the next morning."
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly as written the first time and it was great. The next time, I increased the cinnamon a bit and added a sprinkling of ground ginger and ground cloves. It is out of this world delicious. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","One word...AMAZING. I added no water and sprinkled with cinnamon. I could eat this for every meal every day of the week. People had second and third helpings of it when I took it to a party. So easy to make!"
"0","4","This recipe was very good. I followed the advice of others and doubled the topping and placed some on the bottom of the pan. This turned out really well but I think I needed to add the full amount of water. I only added 1/4 cup of water and it didn't turn out as juicy as I wanted. Will make again with some changes. Thanks"
"0","5","YUM!!!!!! I love this recipe!"
"0","5","I have never been able to make a decent apple crisp!...until now...and everyone requests it...thanks to this wonderful recipe. I do make a few changes. First of all, to save time I make applesauce first. I am the queen of applesauce...so this suits me, and it's easier! Secondly I make 1.5 batches of the topping....use 1/4 on the bottom and 3/4 on the top (with applesauce in between). I don't use much sugar in my sauce, but more cinnamon, and maybe a pinch of nutmeg. I've only made this with Macintosh apples, since we have our own trees. Excellent recipe...thank you!"
"0","4","Really great flavor with a few modifications. I would use a little less of the white sugar next time. And whats with the water? I thought that was a little weird but I put it in anyways and there was a pool of it at the bottom of the pan."
"0","5","I used an apple machine to peel and slice my apples. The apple slices were too thin so it ended up being like applesauce. Next time I would slice them myself, thicker. That said, the flavor of this recipe is UNBELIEVABLE! I doubled the top and I would omit the water. GREAT FLAVOR!!"
"0","5","Used the recipe as is. Very good with the cinnamon ice cream recipe you can find on this site as well. Will make again."
"0","5","absolutely,the BEST ever. I just made it this week. We had company and I needed a quick dessert. I had a bunch of apples and needed something with ingredients I usually have. This is so simple. I have now made it 2x this week. Everyone loved it,I served it warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe, especially if you are looking for a taste of Fall. Since there is only 3 of us, I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8X8 pan. However, I DID NOT cut the topping recipe in half. I used the full recipe and it was absolutely delicious. I served warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup. This will be my Apple Crisp recipe from now on. I don't know if it matters but I used Granny Smith apples as I do for all of my apple baking recipes."
"0","5","I served this for desert and everyone loved it!!! We are going to make this recipe a lot!!!!"
"0","5","Used 5 granny smith apples, reduced water to 1/4 c. as suggested by others, few dashes of nutmeg, 8x8 pan, baked for 40 minutes. I let sit overnight, then reheated the next day, served with vanilla ice cream. Turned out perfect, no leftovers!"
"0","5","This apple crisp is SOOO good! I used mostly granny smith's with a few ida reds. Here are my changes: added about 1/2c dried cranberries to the apples (LOVE cranberries!), changed 1c white sugar in apples to 1/2c brown (too lazy to dig out the white), added 1/2c pecans to the crumb. I found it was a little runny, too, so next time I think I'll half the water. My dad's apple crisp better watch its back!"
"0","5","This recipes is fabulous. the only thing I changes was I up a 1/2 cup of water instead of a whole cup. I severed it with vanilla ice cream. My guest adored it."
"0","5","We made this last night with a can of home-made apple pie filling and this was the best topping for a crumb topping I've ever found. Lots of topping and sweet and good. We put it in a 8X8 pan instead of a 9X13 and it worked out just right. Love it, Thanks for recipe, can't wait to try it on other fruit!"
"0","5","Amazing! I've made this many times now and I have yet to meet someone who didn't absolutely love it and wanted seconds and thirds!"
"0","5","This is so good, I doubled the oat mixture..did not last one day in the house!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe. When I saw the 1/2 cup water (and knowing that the apples would make even more juice)I increased the flour from 1 tbs. to 3 tbs. Cooked it for 15 minutes longer at a reduced temperature 325. Better use a tart apple like Granny Smith or it will be too sweet."
"0","5","BEST APPLE CRISP EVER. So delicious, I have impressed myself! And re: a recent reviewer, I did not make any modifications, the recipe is great as it is. I did use 5 very large Granny Smith apples, I don't know how that equates to pounds. Perfect fall recipe, your family will be impressed!"
"0","5","Honestly, best non-chocolate dessert I've ever made or had! I double the topping for some extra deliciousness. December 2010 UPDATE: If you're using sweet eating apples, you're missing out on the great sweet/tart combo. I usually use Granny Smiths, or a combination of those and sweeter ones. If using sweet apples, you might want to cut the sugar a bit."
"0","5","Great recipe. I was not as sweet as some Apple crisp recipes. Just Right!"
"0","5","I loved this. I made it for my parents and they loved it too. I will use this recipe again."
"0","5","Moist, crispy and richly sweet with lots of baked apple flavour - delicious!"
"0","5","Insanely delicious!! Great with vanilla ice cream."
"0","4","The smells that filled the house while this was cooking, was the best smell ever!!! My family loved this. The topping was to die for."
"0","5","Excellent apple crisp, and really easy to make!! I cut the white sugar in half, and I think next time I'll do the same with the brown sugar as well. It definitely doesn't need all the sugar asked for! I also cut the water to 1/4 c as others had suggested. And I added a dash of nutmeg. It came out really well!!! Next time I will try whole wheat flour rather than plain for the crumble. Very good!!"
"0","5","I LOOOOVE APPLE CRISP BUT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME DOING THIS RECIPE...WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE WAS THE OATS WHCIH MADE IT TASTE SO MUCH BETTER... I JUST LOVE THE AROMA WHILE IT'S IN THE OVEN. N STRAIGHT OUT THE OVEN WITH SOME MAC NUT ICE CREAM RIGHT ON THE SIDE IS THE BOOM DIGGIDY! THANKS GREAT RECIPE!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp ever, plain and simple. I've made it numerous times and it always gets rave reviews. People have said this apple crisp is the best they've ever had! I use 8 medium granny smith apples. I juice a lemon into a large mixing bowl, fill the bowl with water and toss the apples in to prevent browning. Instead of adding 1/2 cup tap water I use the lemon water. I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb topping. It comes out perfectly, just the right amount of sweet and tart. Excellent!"
"0","5","Very good! Did not alter the recipe at all and wouldn't alter it the next time."
"0","4","This is a very good recipe! I had a few adjustments: I only added 1/2 a cup of water and it was still too watery. The apples produce a lot of water so you'd be fine without it and then it wont get soupy. 6 apples is MORE than enough to fill a whole pan. I shaked them in a large bag with some white sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Then I reduced the amount of sugar it tells you to sprinkle over it. I added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust portion. Enjoy!"
"0","5","Great and easy recipes! My children loved it."
"0","4","I agree with previous users about the sugar but the water worked for me and forgot to mix in the butter to crumble so i put it on top and mixed it in the flour came out great"
"0","5","This recipe was AWESOME! Diane you should go in business with this one. Years ago, I use to pay about 6.50 at TGIFriday's for apple crisp. They no longer sell it. However, this recipe is by far better than what I am use to. Awesome! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Great Recipe! I followed the reviews and doubled the topping, though I think next time I'll only 1.5x it. (I think it's really about personal preference...my grandmother's used to have a very thin topping, also delicious.) I also only used 1/4 c. water, which I found perfect. I used a mix of spartan, mac, pink lady and granny smith apples. This recipe's definitely a keeper."
"0","4","Great recipe.."
"0","3","I should've listened to Amber Dawn and not doubled the crisp part of it! LOL I added 1/2 the amount of water it called for and it was still very soupy at the bottom. This was an okay recipe, but I'll probably stick with my Moms. :)"
"0","5","I make this recipe especially if it's I have tons of apples on hand. The only change I made with this recipe is instead of adding 1/2 cup water I only added 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup maple syrup, and another 1/2 cup of oats. I love oats and it's good for you. I think the maple syrup helps to thickened the sauce."
"0","5","This was very good! I'm pregnant with my third child and all I've been thinking about is apples - this really hit the spot! I scaled it down to 4 servings and didn't have any trouble with it being too sweet or too moist or not enough crust."
"0","4","Used half the sugar on the apples, as I used a sweetish eating apple (Spartan's). Still found it just a little sweet, however. Will try this again with Granny Smiths as others have suggested."
"0","4","Just a few changes... I only added 3 Tbs of brown sugar to the apple mixture, as well I added lots of cinnamon & about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I added more butter too, about 3/4 cup in total. One final addition was a couple of handfuls of raspberries & blueberries! It was really yummy, none left!"
"0","5","Great Recipe. I substituted more oats for all the flour."
"0","5","This recipe is great. I've used it a couple of times. This winter I made 3 of these to put in my freezer. I took one out the other day and it was delicious. I love it with a chunk of sharp cheddar or with whipped cream. I'll definitely make this again when apples are in season in Minnesota."
"0","5","Definately a crowd pleaser. I used granny smith apples and used no water. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I doubled the topping mixture and placed half in the bottom of the pan. I tosssed the apples in the cinnamon/flour/nutmeg mixture then placed into pan. I topped with remaining mixture. It was yummy and everyone wanted the recipe."
"0","5","I have made this recipe a few times now. It is very easy to assemble and tastes so good! I did follow some suggestions and use only 1/4 cup of water, which has worked well every time. I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for half of the white sugar. I have used Granny Smith apples every time and wouldn't use another variety. The tartness is perfect with the sweet sugar and crumble. I can't stop eating this once it's out of the oven!"
"0","5","I used this recipe as a base for strawberry crisp and it was delicious. I followed a lot of reviews. This is what I changed; I halved the amount of white sugar in the berry mixture and added a touch of nutmeg. I omitted the water all together. I also doubled the topping, used whole oats and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. The mixture had a lot of liquid, so the water isn't needed. It was delicious!"
"0","5","The first time I made this it was a little too sweet. So I cut out half of the white sugar and it was perfect for me."
"0","5","Awesome recipe , I doubled the topping recipe as others suggested and it turned out wonderful , I served with A scoop of icecream . I sometimes dont care for apple crisp recipes that use oatmeal in the topping , but this one is by far the best i have tried ..5 STARS !!!!"
"0","5","I only have one apple crisp recipe I use but thought I would try another one just to see. The only change I made was I only used a half a cup of the white sugar. THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD. This is my new favorite crisp recipe. The topping never got gloopy, really kept it's shape and when reheated tasted like cobbler. mmmm yummy."
"0","5","This was very good and satisfied my craving for something sweet and oaty. I didn't melt the butter. I cut it in so the mixture would be crumbly. I also added some extra oats. I may have cooked mine a little too long because my apples were almost too soft like applesauce, but it was still delicious. I like the topping best anyway!"
"0","4","Has the potential to be great. I followed the recipe exactly and it had way too much liquid. Next time I will cut the water in half or ommit completely. Also, the topping would be good if increased by 50%, however, I don't think I would increase the sugar, it is plenty sweet! Overall, a great recipe."
"0","5","Cut the white sugar to 2/3 cup and seemed sweet enough. Great recipe."
"0","5","ABSOLUTELY amazingly tasty! This one gets picked at by all members of my family looong after dessert is served. You just can't walk by without taking a taste. I too, did reduce the water to 1/4 C, and that seems to be just right. I also tossed the apples in the cinnamon/sugar mixture before laying them in the cakepan. Most importantly, however, is that I make double the oatmeal topping. It's naughty, I know, but I haven't gotten any complaints YET! MMMM...I just made a batch...."
"0","5","Perfect with a little extra cinnamon and a scoop of french vanilla ice cream! As suggested by other reviewers I halved the water and the consistency was perfect. I also added 2 extra tsp of cinnamon... one to the apples and one to the crumble. This will certainly be my new crumble recipe!"
"0","3","This was way too sweet! I think next time I will cut the sugar in half."
"0","5","YUM!!! This was great...and as always I try to keep to the recipe as exact as possible if I am going to be writing a review. I can't stand when someone rates a recipe with a ton of changes and then rates it low. With that said, I did use the web site to scale the recipe down to only one serving since my hubby has been working out of the country for the past two months...it was just me. I used a Gala apple and the one thing I did not follow in the recipe was to peel the apple. I love the apple peel and the extra fiber is an added plus. I used the measurements exact as stated in the recipe and I thought it was wonderful. Could maybe cut down just a little bit on the sugar, but I don't think it needs double the crumb topping like many reviewers stated. I also thought after scaling the recipe down to one serving it was still a very large serving. It very well could have been two. So the 12 servings the original recipe states could easily serve 20 in my opinion. I obviously didn't use a 9x13 pan, but I used a small round oven safe dish and I baked it in the toaster oven...why heat up the entire oven for one serving? I did not bake it for the full 45 minutes. It was more like 35, but that could have been because the toaster oven baked it faster. At any rate...it was absolutely delish!! Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this for my hubby when he gets home in another month."
"0","3","Very good, but could be a little sweeter for my taste. I would cut the baking time down next time- the apples got a bit too done. A bit dry, maybe more butter?"
"0","3","I know that everyones rating is high on this but my family didn't really care for it. My husband was the only one who went back for seconds. Tried it on the day I made it and the next day. I did make the extra topping and it to me tasted like a granola bar or something you would grab for a fast breakfast. Will not be making it again."
"0","5","Sooooo good! Delicious!"
"0","5","This was just delicious! As other reviewers suggested, we only used 1/4 cup of water, and also tossed the apples in the sugar/flour/cinnamon (with a little nutmeg added) instead of sprinkling it over the top of the apples. We used granny smith apples, which worked very well. With these small changes, this recipe is definitely a keeper!"
"0","4","This was a great recipe. The only reason it has four stars was because of the amount of sugar, I decreased it amount of sugar as others noted and it was still a little sweet. I had a ton (a massive tin of applesauce that my evicted roommate left here and I was able to get rid of about 3/4 of it in this recipe, hence I did not use sliced apples and had to increase the flour to 2 Tbs and extra cinnamon because I love it. Next time, if I am able to afford it, I may use a bit of nutmeg just to experiment but I will definitely use sliced apples. It did turn out like a nice apple-ish pudding with a nice and crispy top and tasted good, thanks and my other two roommates thank you as well, as they devoured it in one night!"
"0","5","quick and easy. tastes great."
"0","5","Wow! There are recipes you look for hoping to find that forgotten awesome dish you remember as a kid. This actually tasted better than what I was wishing for. It tastes better a day or two after you make it as the apples are marinated. Fantastic!"
"0","5","Delicious! I didn't have apples, so I used 6 green Anjou pears that were sitting on my counter for 6 days. Used 1/2 recipe for the pears and kept the full recipe for the toppings. Got rave reviews, everyone's favorite was the topping."
"0","5","my kids loved it"
"0","5","I added 1/2 tsp of cardamom to the recipe and used only 3/4 c of sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar for the topping..I added no water and it came out really yummy but next time I would even decrease the sugar and brown sugar to 1/2 c as it is still too sweet..very yummy on a cold day!!"
"0","4","Easy to make and good crisp. I found the filling too sweet, though, even though I used Granny Smith apples. Next time I will cut down on the sugar. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This was an excellent recipe. Instead of water I added about 1/4 cup of orange juice and with the sugar and flour sprinkled on top of the apples (granny smiths, of course) I added a couple of tablespoons of graham cracker crumbs. They help thicken up the juice and add a little more flavor. Served it warm with warm English Custard and it was fab."
"0","5","The best apple crisp I have ever had. Look no further. I did, however, upon other reviewer's suggestiong omit the water and doubled the topping. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","4","This is amazing apple crisp! The only thing I did different was add nutmeg and only used half a cup of sugar with the apples! Yum!!! So good!"
"0","5","This is excellent. I just made this because I had some apples that I really had to use. I only had 3 so I chopped those up and added 3 pears. I also added nuts-I had some pecans and walnuts and threw those into the mix. The result was delicious! I will make this again and again."
"0","5","This was great tasting!! I used granny smith apples which were perfect. I doubled the topping (perfect amount) and left out the water. When you use granny smith apples they produce enough of their own liquid when you bake them in the oven. Adding water would have made this soupy. I cooked it in the morning and rewarmed it in the oven at 250 degrees for 10 minutes before serving. Delicious!!"
"0","5","AMAZINGLY GOOD. Just the right amount of topping. I added a little more cinnamon and some nutmeg and decreased the water to a couple to Tbsp per other reviews. Will be making this again and again. Everyone loved it."
"0","5","Pretty much perfect. I think the best part about this recipe is the nice consistency it makes from the apples/water/sugar/flour. Only a couple mild changes: I added more cinnamon and nutmeg to both the apples (1 1/2-2 tsp cinn, 1/2-1 tsp nutmeg) and the topping (1 tsp cinn, 1/2 tsp nutmeg), and cut down on the butter by a quarter to a third. I think the extra spices really kicks up the homey flavor and the extra butter isn't really necessary and just increases the fat content. Also, I would use a variety of apples if possible, some sweet, some tart. Skip the most typical grocery store apples, they are boring. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect."
"0","5","First Crisp I've ever made and everyone liked it alot!"
"0","5","This is one of the most delicious dessert recipes I have ever made. I used pink lady apples because they are the sweetest apples. I love the crumb cake topping, this can defintely be used in other recipes including crumb cake. I ended up only using 3 apples with the same portion of crumb topping. I thought I had more apples to use. This dessert only lasted 2 days in my house."
"0","4","This was a very good base recipe, however the first time I made it (exactly as the recipe read) I found it to be too runny and it didn't have enough crispy topping for my family's liking. So the second time I made it, I only used 1/4 c. water and I also doubled the topping recipe (except for the flour- I accidentally just used 1 c. flour, and it turned out great!) Anyways, my suggestion for adding the water is if you plan to serve it warm, DO NOT use any water because it makes it soupy. But if you plan to serve it after it has cooled, go ahead and use about 1/4 cup water. With these changes, this is definitely my 'go to' recipe for apple crisp!"
"0","5","No ice cream for me on this crisp!! Would take away from the flavor. Just serve it warm and it wont last long! The best ever!! I used Granny Smith apples."
"0","5","I made this apple crisp for Christmas, I added a 1 lb. bag of frozen whole strawberries, which I quartered. I also doubled the topping as stated in other reviews. There was none left, so I had to make another pan for myself. Tastes just like Grandma used to make!"
"0","5","I made this for Christmas for my apple crisp-loving brother. He loved it! I didn't change a thing! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","What a delicious apple crisp!! This will definitely be my go-to dessert from now on. When I make it the next time, I only have a few wee changes I'll make: use orange juice instead of water (I used 1/4 cup as per suggestions), and reduce the white sugar (it wasn't too sweet for me but 1 cup seems like a lot and I'm sure I won't notice if there's only 3/4 cup)."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!! I used Mcintosh apples, this was the best apple crisp I have ever had!"
"0","5","Delicious and easy! I plan on making a cherry crisp with this recipe for Christmas instead of cherry pie."
"0","4","Not only did this taste great, it made the entire house smell incredibly warm and wonderful on this snowy day~  I cut the brown sugar to 2/3 cup and the melted butter to 1/3 cup, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and a splash of vanilla~"
"0","4","I needed to use up a lot of apples before they went bad, so I tried this recipe. It was much easier than making an apple pie. It was VERY sweet. I think I'll try spenda or something next time. I'm soooo glad that I took the ohers advice and did not add any water. There was PLENTY of juice as is. It was delicious!!!!!"
"0","4","Great recipe. I have made this twice now. The first time I made no changes and used a mix of Pink Lady apples and Granny (half and Half). With the tartness of the granny the amount of sugar was not too bad, but still too sweet for me. I did (as my mom always did when I was growing up) make extra topping. The second time I only had enough apples on hand to make it half batch. It still turned out great (using the same mix of apples), but I did make sure to cut the sugar back more than half. I didn't have any problems with the amount of water in the recipe as some other reviewers mentioned. However, I have an OLD oven that uses a fan and usually dries food out. So I think the water helped to keep it moist. I will definitely use this recipe as a base from now on. It's flexible and hard to go wrong!"
"0","5","wow, sooo good!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT AND EASY..MY FAMILY LOVES IT. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!"
"0","4","Very tasty, but the 'crisp' part of the dessert - the topping, could have been a little crispier. Otherwise, very yummy - especially warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","This was awesome. I made a few pans of this to give away and froze one too. With vanilla ice cream on top, can't beat it!"
"0","5","So easy and sooo good! I literally ate the whole thing (not in one sitting). It was wonderful. I used the slicing disc on my food processor to make things easier and it worked great."
"0","5","Oh my gosh, this is awesome! This is the first Apple Crisp I've ever made. My boyfriend says it's the best he's ever had. The kids loved it! Mmmmmmmmmm!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp recipe that I have tried and my husband just devoured it. I would definitly only use Granny smith apples."
"0","4","a little to sugary for my taste."
"0","5","Delicious and so classic! I did double the crust (for a bottom and a top layer) and cut down on the sugar. Granny Smith apples are perfect for it! We loved it!"
"0","5","This is awesome, I doubled the topping for extra cruch and flavor, it was great!! I use this recipe all the time now!"
"0","5","Made the recipe as is - no substitutions and it turned out so good. This was a big Thanksgiving day hit for dessert - it's also really good cold the next day! :)"
"0","5","I made this with 8 apples, and it was still way too much for my 8x12 pyrex. I ended up putting leftover apples in a smaller one and baking two pans of it. Otherwise, great taste especially with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","4","Recipe is awsome. I found it to be a bit watery though. I don't think I will use water next time because the juices from the apples will come out as it bakes."
"0","5","GREAT! I followed the suggestions. I used Granny Smith apples, put in 1/2 the water and 1/2 the sugar. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Very very good!"
"0","5","I did not add any water. And it taste just as good as recipes that cut in the butter. Melted butter makes it way quicker."
"0","3","Did not have the type of topping I normally like. Wanted it to taste like mom's..guess I need to call her for her recipe"
"0","5","Really good. I left out the water, but will add some the next time I make it because it was a little dry. The topping is really good!"
"0","5","***Excellent*** The topping stays nice and crisp for leftovers, does not get mushy. I used Braeburn apples fresh from an apple orchard, omitted the water, and was very satisfied. My family gobbled it up over a few days, and that was after giving half away to a neighbor. I did double the topping as was suggested. If you have a super sweet tooth, this is for you."
"0","5","I usually don't like any baked apple goods, but this apple crisp is just delicious. I almost ate the whole thing myself!! I used 4 granny smiths and 2 rome apples, and followed other reviewers' advice and used 3/4 cups of brown/white sugar. The finished product was a little on the sour side, but was still splendid."
"0","4","Definatley a keeper but needed some more flavor. My alterations were adding 3T cinnamon, 1t nutmeg and coating the apples w/the mixture. Also doubled the topping mix and added 3T cinnamon, 1t nutmeg, extra butter."
"0","4","pretty good, but needs to be served warm w/ some vanilla icecream."
"0","5","easy, family just love's it great for after dinner.Thx's Robbie"
"0","3","This was okay. It was way too sweet for our taste. The sugars overwhelmed the flavor of the apples. I loved the oatmeal in the topping. I would make it again but use half the sugar."
"0","5","I have made this probably 3 times in the last 2 1/2 wks. It is delicious! I did cut the sugar back in the apple mixture, and it ended up being perfect. thanks!"
"0","4","Very good. I did make a few changes based on reviews, one being halving the amount of water to the apple mixture (I used Granny Smiths). Unfortunately lessening the water ended up making the apple crisp a little dry. I would not do so next time. Great recipe, although I prefer one of the other ones on this site because I love the oatmeal cookie flavor the topping has on that one."
"0","5","As good of apple crisp as I've ever had."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. It makes a lot! I usually double the topping based on feedback from the family. Have plenty of vanilla icecream on hand also."
"0","5","This apple crisp is AMAZING. I used 8 granny smith apples and doubled the topping ingredients. Kept the water the same(which makes a great sauce)and it came out perfect."
"0","5","This was great. I made it for Bible study and it was gobbled up. I added extra apples, using mainly granny smith, but throwing in a couple of too-soft-for-raw-eating galas. I also made some caramel sauce with brown sugar, heavy cream and a touch of vanilla and some homemade whip cream with chopped pecans. YUMMMMY. I love recipes that showcase fall foods and this is definitely going to be repeated at my house!"
"0","4","I'd suggest reducing the amount of water added, this crisp came out soupy. I drained quite a bit of water out of the bottom of the pan after the first serving was taken...I might not add any water next time. Other than the excess water, this crisp was wonderful and I'd definitely make this recipe again."
"0","4","This recipe was pretty good but I think next time I will use less sugar. I didn't melt the butter, instead I cut it into the flour/sugar mixture which turned out ok. I don't think I used the right kind of apples as they lost their texture, but my family really liked it. I will probably try this again."
"0","5","The best I have ever had will only use this one from now on.I did cut the cup of white sugar out like other said to do it was awesome.Thank you for such a good recipe."
"0","5","OMG!! Add me to the list of converts!! This recipe is amazing. I cut it in 1/2 because I was only making it for my family of 4. After I tasted it I could hardly wait the 5 hours until after dinner to dig into it. The absolutely best part about it, in addition to the taste, is that it is so incredibly easy to make and relatively low fat, compared to some of the other apple crisp/cobbler recipes online. Thanks so much for posting this recipe, it was just awesome!"
"0","5","Yes - it's really that good!! I cut recipe in half but followed proportions, it was not too watery for us. Served with vanilla ice cream. Tasted even better the next day - who knew it was possible to improve on perfection?! What more can I add that hasn't already been said? Make this apple crisp, you won't be disappointed."
"0","5","AWESOME...nothing else to say!!"
"0","4","I followed the directions to the tee and I found this a bit watery. The flavor was good, but I would omit the water in the future."
"0","5","This was near perfect!"
"0","3","This was good when first cooked, but after refrigerating it the crust was soggy and not very tasty. Next time I will half the recipe so it can be eaten in one evening."
"0","5","This was the best apple crisp I have ever tasted!!! My family loved it and my husband said it was the best, which he is VERY hard to please"
"0","4","Very good, however if I make it again I would use less sugar and omit the water. It came out fairly runny, but yummy still the same! thanks for the recipe."
"0","4","Very good! I didn't add the water. I wish I had though, it wasn't dry, but I think it could have had more liquid. And I did double the topping. Everyone enjoyed it, and it went pretty fast. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","Very good and very easy to make!"
"0","5","I forgot the water on the apples, and it still came out wonderful. I will definetly make this recipe again."
"0","5","This is the BEST recipe ever. I didn't add water and I used Apple Pie Spice instead of cinnamon, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I made it once for the family and they loved it, so I made it again and brought it in to work. It was a hit. I plan to make this recipe often."
"0","5","Should I refrigerate until ready to eat? Or leave on the counter at room temp. all day?"
"0","5","Yummm! We loved this. I did not use as much cinnamon and sugar on the apples as called for, just mixed it up till it looked right and it came out fine. Next time I will eliminate some of the water that gets poured on as I did not like the soupiness in the bottom of the pan, but it still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Do not add the water! I also added a little more cinnamon!"
"0","5","This was my first apple crisp I made - it turned out great however for the apples I used I will not add any water next time."
"0","3","THis was ok.. I like to cut back on fat and sugar so I used 1/2 Cup white sugar and I cut the butter down by just a couple of Tablespoons.. which in turn made the topping little dry.. yikes .. I will next time use the full amount of butter. other than that it was easy and my kids loved it."
"0","4","This was very good, but too watery for me. Next time I won't add the water, like a lot of people have done."
"0","4","Family enjoyed it but said it was really sweet. Next time I'll use less sugar."
"0","5","So delicious! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","I tried this recipe for the first time and I haven't done much with apples before. I find its the best when you mix your portion up in a bowl before you eat it. This spreads the great topping to all the apples. I have 50 pounds of apples to go through so I think I'll be making this one a lot in the next few days."
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe. It is like french apple pie without the crust. If you have an apple peeler and a food processor, it only takes 15 minutes to prepare the apples. I used golden delicious apples, but any apples would be good. I highly recommend this recipe."
"0","4","I followed both the recipe and some suggestions of the reviews. I mixed the apples with the sugar and spices while cutting them up to get out all the juices, didn't add water, doubled the topping, and cut the butter in instead of melting it. When I make this again, I will NOT double the topping, but keep the other changes. I will also cut back on the sugar. It's too sweet for us and we enjoy the apples much more than the topping."
"0","5","Very good. I omitted the water and doubled the crust, per other reviews."
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice now with raving reviews, a couple changes, 3 cups of apple instead of ten, grated the apples, and doubled the crust (half on the top and half on the bottom) recipe and served warm with ice cream."
"0","5","one of the best apple crisps i've ever had!"
"0","3","Meh, it's apple crisp. Better than my school's and worse than my grandma's."
"0","5","this is great! I used 1/4 cup water and it turned out well"
"0","5","This was just wonderful. I loved the cruchy topping."
"0","5","Easy and delicious! I served it with cool whip."
"0","5","Great Apple Crisp recipe!! I had to share this recipe with the girls at work. I also used less water and a bit more cinnamin. Excellent!!!!"
"0","5","Excellent Recipe. I used my my apple peeler/slicer which took alot less time then peeling and slicing by hand. I use more apples then recipe called for and a little more sugar to make up the difference. Use all different type apples. Basically, whatever ones were in the house.  Very Easy to make. Great for a gathering"
"0","5","This was fantastic! I added 3/4 cup pecans to the topping, used 1/4 cup water, & tossed the apples in the cinnamon & sugar mix. I used granny smith apples & it was still a little too sweet for my taste. I'll cut down the sugar next time."
"0","4","I used Red Top apples. Will make it again with Green apples. Added some raisins in with the apples. Water was enough - like a bit of sauce. I reduced the sugar because of the sweet apples."
"0","4","Water made it too runny. Flavor was very good."
"0","4","Good! Made it with Granny Smith apples, which gave it a nice tartness and kept the apple slices in an apple shape."
"0","5","The best I can find. Every time I make this dish, I never have left overs. An all time favourite when I have company over."
"0","5","Don't add the water as the recipe calls for"
"0","5","Wow! This is the best apple crisp recipe I've ever come across. Don't half the recipe. I did and it was gone in the blink of an eye."
"0","5","I am a farmwife so I decided to try this recipe after reading the reviews. I took the suggestion of other reviews and doubled the crust recipe and I had read were some people either used no water or 1/4 cup of water. I replaced the water with 1/4 cup of rum sprinkled over the apples then put the crust on top. The rum in it was good. Then I took out some Whipped Cream to put on top of the apple crisp and than drizzled some caramel topping over all of it. The guys said the only thing they would have liked better was ice cream instead of whipped cream but ice cream is hard to take out to the field."
"0","5","Fabulous recipe! As others recommended, I cut the sugar for the apples in half. I used Granny Smiths and the sweetness/tartness was just right. I was unsure about doubling the topping so I made the recipe as is and then decided another 1/2 recipe of the topping would be enough. For personal taste reasons, I also increased the cinnamon in the apple mixture to 1 tablespoon. I never got around to buying the vanilla ice cream but no one missed. This recipe is a definite keeper!"
"0","5","Wow! Homemade apple crisp never tasted so good! The 13 x 9 pan size provided yum yums for my family of 5 for about 3 days. Of course, I doubled the crisp and made top and bottom crust. I added 1/8 teaspoon of cloves to the apples in addition to the cinnamon. This is a keeper FOREVER!!! Thanks and hugs to all this Fall!"
"0","5","5 granny smiths-measure to 10 cups. 1/4 cup water, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg-sprinkle over and mix up double crisp incl melted butter. crumble over top."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I used what apples I had on hand...a granny smith, some galas, and not sure what the rest were but they were slightly tart. Very good apple crisp."
"0","5","This recipe was AMAZING! My kids loved helping do the apples (we have one of those peeler, corer, slicer gadgets).  Although I folled the recipe almost exactly, I made a procedural change by mixing the dry ingredients for the apples together then putting them in a big Ziplock bag. I then added the diced apples and shook the bag until they were all evenly coated with the mixture.  Also, I reduced the sugar just slightly in the crumble and added some Turbinado Sugar (Sugar in the Raw type stuff) to the top. The extra rich flavor and crunch was awesome."
"0","5","I used to work on an apple farm that made the best apple crisp every fall and I could never find a recipie that even came close until now! This is the perfect fall dessert! Make it with tart grany smith apples and it is the perfect combo of tart and sweet!"
"0","5","This was incredible! I, like other reviewers, decreased the sugar by half and doubled the oats mixture."
"0","4","Very good! I also halved the apple portion as I wanted to make smaller amount. I baked it in an 8x8 pan, but still used almost the full amount of topping - I probably had about 1/2 c. extra that was just too much. The only other change I made was to use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","I think this is the best apple crisp I have ever made. I did use just 1/4 cup of water and also 1/2 cup of sugar in the apples. I also doubled the topping and mixed half of it in the apple mixture also. Made for an amazing apple crisp that I will definitely keep and use often. One word Amazing!!!"
"0","5","Smells and taste so yummy!!!"
"0","4","Tried recipe it was too a bit too sweet. Will try again but will cut the white sugar down in half."
"0","4","It was really good but REALLY sweet. I used McIntosh apples, which I suppose are a bit on the sweeter side, but I think I could have probably halved the sugar and been fine."
"0","5","This was fantastic! I actually burnt the top a little but it was so good that no one even noticed! I will make this again and again."
"0","4","My family really enjoyed this recipe. Next time, I will cut down on the sugar and use a little less water. Otherwise, it was perfect! Definately a keeper!"
"0","5","Because we love the topping so much (who doesn't), I used 1 1/2 the amount. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust. It was a huge recipe, now that we are empty nesters but my husband didn't complain about having lots of leftovers."
"0","4","Good: Great flavor, good amount to serve for a dinner of 6-8. Bad: I baked this for 30 minutes instead of 45 to keep the apples a little firm and from turning to applesauce. It was perfect! But, when serving, it was way too watery, even after setting over night. Next time I will try baking it without any water. Second, I cut the butter into the topping mixture, it was yummy, but not very pretty and not very crispy. I think I was mess around with either substituting white sugar for brown or a combo of both."
"0","3","Too much topping, not enough apples. The topping was slightly dry."
"0","5","A friend of mine gave me a bunch of fresh picked apples and I needed a quick dessert. I made it just like the recipe stated and it was delicious! I'll make this one again!"
"0","5","This is an AMAZING apple crisp recipe! My whole family loved it, it will be the new go-to recipe for apple crisp from now on."
"0","5","Very good traditional apple crisp."
"0","5","I have been looking for an apple crisp that is as good as my mom's and this might even be better! Really fast and easy and really good. I used Granny Smith apples. Next time I might add a little nutmeg like somebody suggested but it was really perfect as is. Thanks for the great recipie!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp. I like to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream, so yummy! I double the topping and used a mixture of granny smith and red delicious."
"0","5","The recipe ie great! I used Fuji apples so my crisp came out too sweet which was my fault, but the topping and consistency was good."
"0","5","A-MAZING! I took the advice of a few different reviewers: added NO water and doubled the 'crisp' topping. Eek! That was way too much topping for me. Next time I'm not changing a thing. I know it'll be just perfect as-is. GREAT recipe. Oh, I did use Granny Smith apples and those work beautifully."
"0","5","Yummy, exactly what I was craving. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","Great recipe, I followed some of the suggestions and I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the apples and it came out great."
"0","4","This was super good. I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup of the water. I didn't add enough apples though...probably only 2/3 of what the recipe calls for so it was really sweet...but all the same it was a huge hit at the Youth Group my husband and I run. Just made it again 9/30/09 and it was really good. The only adjustments I made was to cut the wate to 1/4 cup again and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. It was still a little watery though so nect time I'll add another 1/2 tablespoon of flour in the apple mix. Really good though."
"0","3","This was my first apple crisp with oats, and I guess I'm not a fan of it baked this way. I'll stick with my mom's recipe that I grew up with from now on."
"0","5","So Good!! I doubled the topping and ommited the water. Made for dinner party. Lots of compliments. A favorite fo sure!"
"0","5","This is my favorite apple crisp recipe. I will forever use this! I used some of the suggested changes: only 1/4 water, put the apples in the sugar mix, doubled the crust and I cut in half of the butter and melted the other half. It was so perfect! I can't wait to have my husband try it! He will be so impressed. Tomorrow I am going to make it again, only with peaches."
"0","5","Extremely good. My family loves it."
"0","5","This was my first time making apple crisp,and it definitely won't be my last,this was great!I used peeled Granny Smith apples,and a little less than 1/2 a cup of water.I also used one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon,and added a couple of shakes of nutmeg.I served it with vanilla ice cream on top(but of course!)The recipe says this serves 12,but we had 6 people polish this off,NO PROBLEM.This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","This is awesome! I have made this for family holidays, and people have asked for the recipe. The only modification I have made is to adjust the white sugar depending on the sweetness of the apples I use. Otherwise, I use as is. Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","We made this last night with peaches (since they are in season) and doubled the topping of course! Excellent!"
"0","5","This apple crisp was delicious! I made it for the birthday party I threw for my husband yesterday because it's one of his favorites. I was nervous because I had never made it before & I had to do it in a hurry, but it turned out perfectly! Everyone raved about it & couldn't get enough. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"0","5","I used peeled (personal pref.) Granny Smith apples and did mix the apples and sugar mixture before putting it in the pain. I also added nutmeg and a little bit of apple juice instead of water as others have suggested. I cut the butter into the topping to get a cripsy crust. It was a hit and was gone by the end of the party."
"0","5","Always a hit in my house. You should definitely double the topping. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. Yum yum."
"0","5","Best Apple Crisp ever!"
"0","5","Yummy, though I changed the recipe slightly (as usual). I doubled the topping, using 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. Also, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup Country Crock in place of the butter. I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and only used 1/4 cup water, but next time I'll try 1/2 cup water because this seemed a bit dry. Great otherwise though!"
"0","4","I was not as 'wowed' as others on this recipe. I was not sure how many apples would make 10 cups, so I followed the suggestion of someone else and used 6 (what I would consider) medium Granny Smith's. This was WAY too much for my 9x13... especially when I doubled the topping, which was another suggestion from someone else. I did not bother peeling the apples... just cored and sliced. You wouldn't know it was there if you didn't see it. I did toss the apples with the sugar/cinnamon mixture as opposed to pouring it over top of them because I thought it would distribute it a bit more evenly. I used about 3/4 of the double batch of crumb topping and I think it was too much. The fact that it was piled on so high made it seem dry to me. If I had it to do over again, I would either used the amount of topping called for, or put half of what I used under the apples so it could have absorbed some of the juice. There was something that seemed a little off about the flavor to me. I used the nutmeg as suggested, which may have been it. I took it to an Easter dinner and the other guests seemed to like it which is why I'm giving 4 stars. If not for them, I probably would have gone with 3. Another note: your pan will look like it's overflowing before you put it in... but it will lower into the pan as the apples cook down."
"0","4","Delicious! As suggested, I added some nutmeg to the apples and upped the amount of the crumble a bit. Served this to company and everyone enjoyed it."
"0","5","This turned out good but a little more liquid than I liked, even when using the other reviewers suggestions to us 1/4c. water. It was probably due to the fact that I used yellow delicious and gala apples. Other than that it is was very tasty. Thanks for post."
"0","5","I made a huge tray of this for a party and brought it and baked it there, everyone loved it! Served with vanilla bean ice cream. I used whole wheat flour and doubled the topping like everyone said to put half on the bottom, although I found that to be a bit mushy. Upped the spices, and used 10 apples, and only 1/4 cup water. Yum! It was sooooo good!"
"0","5","I made this recipe with Melanie's suggested changes to terrific fanfare. There is more sugar in this recipe than I would normally allow myself to use, and found that it adds good texture. Vanilla ice cream cut the sweetness perfectly. I doubled the crumble topping and split the apples between two pie plates so that I could share with my neighbor."
"0","4","I made this over the weekend and it was very good. I did change it up a bit though. I doubled the crust topping-the best part! Yum. I also reduced the amount of water since the apples seem to let out juices as well. I used about 1/4 cup of water and I mixed in about a tablespoon of vanilla with the water. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar when initially coating the apples. I also used a little dash of nutmeg in the crust topping mixture as others did suggest. One thing that I did not do because of time, but will definitely do next time is peel the apples. Otherwise, it turned out great. It went perfect with some vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again. Thanks!"
"0","4","I love this recipe i make it atleast twice a month for the rainy days. The only thing i changed was the water i omit it and it still comes out fine. The cooking time i find alittle to long i only do 35 mins in my oven. its yummy"
"0","4","Very nice basic, a comfort food classic. I think next time I'll add some cinnamon to the topping mix as well and maybe some corn starch to the water to thicken it a little. All in all very good starting point, try it as written first then tweek a little to your taste."
"0","5","Holy cow! The best apple desert EVER! And I was never a fan of apple anything. I followed the other reviewers' advice and put crisp on top and bottom. I rolled the apples in the sugar mixture+nutmeg before laying it in the pan. Also, I soaked the apples in water before I baked it because I didn't have enough time to throw it in the oven before it turned brown; so, I didn't add any water. It came out perfect. Note: Remember the vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","Great recipe, the whole family loved it! I only had Golden Delicious on hand, so I used those and cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup. I did not decrease the water as some did. I like the gooey stuff and it worked great. Next time I think I will try decreasing the brown sugar to 2/3 cup. Great recipe and very simple to prepare."
"0","4","Good apple crisp recipe. Make sure your apples are peeled. Also, I took the advice of other readers and doubled the crust recipe. I thought it made way too much and will only use the regular recipe next time."
"0","5","This is a lovely recipe, that reminds me of a crisp my mother makes. It gets high marks for flavor, but you can also use the crumble recipe on a variety of other things. It's an all around great recipe that lets the home cook expand their repertoire."
"0","5","This is by far my favoritie apple crisp recipe that I have ever foun! Sometimes I substitute apple juice for the water and I always add chopped pecans to the crumb topping!"
"0","5","Sooooooooooooooooooooo good! We made this for Christmas Eve dessert last year and it was so yummy! We all loved it!"
"0","5","This recipe was super easy and my boyfriend loved it! I modified slightly based on other reviews... I used 5 gala apples and tossed w/ the sugar mixture (1/2 brown and 1/2 regular) before hand. The apples were so juicy NO water was needed. I baked in an 8 x 8 square dish w/ the regular amt of topping for 40 minutes and it was perfect. Delicious w/ Vanilla bean ice cream!"
"0","5","I halved the recipe and made it in a pie plate. It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","4","This is a good, basic recipe. I usually have most of the ingredients on hand, and it's easily modifiable to suit your tastes (for example, drizzle some caramel over the top and serve with a scoop of ice cream - yum!)."
"0","5","This is my 'go to' recipe here in the fall in New Hampshire when the apples are plenty! Everyone asks me for seconds and then the recipe. I sub out half white sugar and half brown sugar in the apple mix. Otherwise, I follow exactly. Thank you for such a delicious recipe that will someday be 'an old favorite' of ours!"
"0","5","Delicious! Made this for a Tgiving meal. Don't forget to grease the bottom of the pan!"
"0","5","AWESOME RECIPE! The apples turned out so soft that they melted in your mouth and I loved how the oatmeal made the topping taste. I made this twice in a week and everyone loved it."
"0","5","Delicious! I would use less water. I used 1/4 cup and it was very watery at the bottom. It wasn't a 'sauce' like others mentioned. I wouldn't use Granny Smith- I used 1/2 Granny and 1/2 Cortland, I never use Granny and I can see why, too tart for me. Otherwise, I made 1/2 extra topping and it was perfect with 1 and 1/2 the topping. Yummy overall!"
"0","5","Ridiculously easy and simply delicious. Fantastic with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","mmmm great recipe! I also cut down on the water I used. However, if I was to make it again, I would use brown sugar in the apple mix instead of white. The white is grainy. When I make apple pie I use brown sugar, I almost did when I made this, but I wanted to try the recipe the way it was. All in all..you won't go wrong with this recipe!"
"0","5","This is the only dessert recipe I've come across that I actually had to do nothing to make it taste better. My husband and guests and I LOVED it. The only thing I changed (because I didn't have regular oats on hand) was I substituted in two of those individual serving caramel apple flavored oatmeal packets. I don't know if it made much of a difference, but this turned out superb. (and it was my first time making an apple crisp recipe ever.)"
"0","5","I had a friend call me last night and said she has been dying for 'my apple crisp' and could I pleeeease make her one. I had to come back and reprint the recipe and wanted to reinterate what everyone else said. This is the best apple crisp. I always make it when the inlaws are in town or to take to a friends house. Great comfort food ladies!! I also cut the water in half and double the topping with a little cool whip on top. I strongly suggest purchasing an apple peeler, mine has a built in de-corer so it makes it so easy to make! (Can also use it to peel the dreaded potatoes!) One last thing, I have made using the Splenda white and brown sugar..trying to make myself feel better about eating a huge bowl of it and it turned out really well."
"0","5","after popping this BEAUTIFUL dish into the oven, i realized i completely forgot to put the sugary dry mix over the apples, so the dish was totally ruined and i had to mash everything together. it still came out 'okay' but it looked hideous and the flavor of course was no mixed correctly. will try again asap! Two tips: 1. dont forget any ingredients. 2. add some nutmeg, but not too much. it totally overwhelmed all over flavors last time."
"0","5","I baked this yesterday and it was sweeped at once :) i got compliments from every single one on the table :) i just love apple crisps, thanks to a friend who told me about it. Next time am gonna double the crisp topping and maybe add some to the bottom and use sweeter apples... since i think the apples i used were a bit sour so they gave this tangy taste to it... and i think it needs more than 45 mins in the oven in order for the topping to turn goldish-brown ;) but in general YUMMMMMY :)))"
"0","5","The recipe was great!! My whole family loved the apple crisp!! The only thing I changed was I doubled the topping. Great dessert. thank you!"
"0","5","Simply divine! I did follow others' suggestion to double the crumb part and put half on bottom. I used 7 large Granny Smith apples and tossed them with the sugar and cinnamon (with 1/4 t. nutmeg added) mixture to coat well. I also used about 1/4 cup apple juice instead of water. I got lots of compliments and will definitely make again! Thanks!"
"0","5","I followed the suggestions of ALLY99 and KATTELYN except I didn't add any nuts to the crust. It came out perfect and everyone loved it. I will definitely be adding this to the collection."
"0","5","Easy and Yummy! I used less butter and mixed in some water to the crumble mixture to make it slightly healthier. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe."
"0","5","Very good apple crisp... just what I was looking for! I will probably cut down on the water next time, though."
"0","5","This was awesome! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out delicious. I will absolutely make it again."
"0","5","This was excellent. Both my husband and I enjoyed it with our nighty cup of coffee. Will use again."
"0","3","I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. I did what others suggested and reduced the water, but it still came out very watery. Also, next time I will peel the apples. The recipe didn't indicate to peel them, but I definitely will next time. The flavor was good, but the next time I will double the topping. It also needed to be cooked longer because the apples were still too crispy."
"0","5","Loved this one! My 9x13 pan was being 'occupied' by brownies, so I halfed the recipe and baked it in my round, stoneware Pampered Chef dish. If you need to do the same, only bake for 35 minutes (which was perfect). I used Red Delicious apples. What I like best about this crisp is that it isn't too sweet, the apples' flavor are not overshadowed either. We had this as our New Year's Eve dessert - served with Blue Bell's 'Anniversary Cake' ice cream- which has an almond-type flavor and tasted amazing with the apples, so maybe even adding a tsp. of almond extract to the crisp would be good. :)"
"0","5","I just pulled this out of the oven 20 minutes ago and finished a big bowl full of this FABULOUS dessert!!! This is WONDERFUL! I followed the directions to the letter and everything turned out perfect! Wonderfully tasty recipe!!!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe."
"0","5","Perfect! I've already had requests to bring this to several dinner parties coming up!"
"0","5","Absolutely sinful! My husband made this for Christmas dinner and my husband isn't a chef by any means, so this is a perfect recipe for the beginner! :-) He followed the reviews and cut the water in half, added nutmeg and doubled the crumb topping. We will definitely be throwing out our other apple crisp recipe and using this in the future! Thank you very much!"
"0","4","This makes wonderful apple crisp. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the amount of water. This reduction left the apples (I used granny smith) rather dry, though. I will not reduce the water next time I make it. My only other change was to mix the cut apples into the sugar mixture as I cut them so they wouldn't brown. Wonderful taste and excellent recipe."
"0","5","my friends usually ask me to double to 'crisp' topping because it's so good!"
"0","5","Delicious! Reminds me of what my mum use to make! I doubled the topping like another user suggested and it was perfect. Will definetly be making this again!"
"0","5","Wonderful! When I hadn't made apple crisp in years, I searched for a recipe. I found it right here and I will never change it!"
"0","5","Oh my! This was probably the best apple crisp I've ever had. I halved it, used Gala apples and sprinkled some nutmeg over the apples. I kept eating small spoonfuls of it, and didn't want any supperl. Thanks for the post."
"0","5","What w wonderful recipe. I also cut the water in half and doubled the topping (my favorite part). I have made this several times and it is always a hit with whoever is lucky enough to be around when I make it. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","This was so good! Probably the richest apple crisp I have ever had. I halved the recipe (although I didn't notice that inside the recipe instructions, it calls for a whole cup of flour rather than the re-sized 1/2 cup in the ingredients so it got a little extra of that) and baked in an 8x8 pan. We cut up as many apples as would fit in the pan; it was about 6, mixed granny smith and golden delicious. We didn't peel them and it was great, though my husband would've preferred no peels. Based on some of the other reviews and my experience making crumb toppings, I used cold butter, and mixed all of the topping ingredients in my food processor with the mixing blade to cut in the butter. Works great. Only other change I made was to use a little apple juice instead of water. I just eyeballed enough to coat but not drown the apples (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup). Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Good to put the topping on the bottom of the dish as well. Make more topping for the bottom!"
"0","5","All I can say is WOW! I LOVE this recipe! I am a big apple crisp fan and this has ruined all other competitors. I reduced the sugar content in half for both white and brown, and used Roma apples because of thier sweetness. Also if you use a cheese grater to make thin long slices instead of thick, it carmelizes the apples and sugar...YUM!"
"0","5","I brought this dessert to a dinner party and I'm still getting compliments 5 weeks later! It was so easy and so yummy! Warm it up and add a scoop of ice cream or drizzle on some caramel...yum! Beware b/c this will go quickly!"
"0","5","This is amazing. I'm not much of an apple crisp person, but I loved this. I've made it a few times now and it doesn't last very long."
"0","5","This recipe was delicious! All my children ate it (5, 4, 2) and they loved it! It was just what we were looking for in a crisp."
"0","5","very good recipe.....will make again. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","That was Great!! I did change a few things I added only half the water 1/2 cup. I did double the topping and VERY glad that I did. I also added ground nutmeg 1/4 tsp. It was so good would make this again!!!"
"0","5","Yum! Yum! Yum! This is absolutely the best apple crisp I've ever made. My family loved it. I used an eight by ten baking dish, 6 large granny apples and apple juice instead of water as suggested in a previous review. I will definitely make this over and over again."
"0","5","Just wonderful! I used Granny Smith apples and had just the right amount of sweetness."
"0","4","I thought it was a 4 star; my husband thought it was a 3 star. Like version in Better Homes and Garden better"
"0","5","Love this! I did tinker with it a bit. I used half red and half golden delicious apples. I used twice the amount of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and it was awesome. I used the amount of water called for, but it was a tad dry so next time I'll increase it to 3/4 cup. For the topping, I doubled it and didn't melt the butter, but cut it in once softened. I sprayed non-stick cooking spray and then put half the crust down. Put the apples down, sprinkled the apple mixture down, water, then the crust. It was great!"
"0","5","I made this apple crisp for my husband to take to work. We each had to try a bite to make sure it was good. It is so delicious. I made another pan this morning for home. Thank you for the wonderful, easy, recipe."
"0","5","I will never look for another Apple Crisp recipe again. This was FANTASTIC! I did follow other reviews and cut back on the sugar, I only used 3/4 cup. I didn't use any water, added 1 tsp of vanilla to the apples as well as the juice of 1/2 of a lemon. I doubled the crisp topping, and had to cook it for about and hour and five minutes. Totally worth it. Super easy to fix, I left the peel on the apples out of laziness....next time I will definitly peel the apples. A wonderful recipe...my hubby was in heaven!"
"0","5","My favorite desert."
"0","5","Delicious! I used Granny Smith apples and forgot the water, but it turned out perfect without it. A little on the sweet side, so some may want to use slightly less sugar."
"0","4","Awesome recipe I made it for a group I had at my house for dinner. Everyone loved it. Much better when you double the topping.My husband and I agree that it's a keeper."
"0","4","This was good, but very sweet. Next time maybe try less sugar on the apples and perhaps more topping, but that's probably just a personal preference."
"0","4","I liked the crumble but thought the apples had too much sugar (used Granny Smith)."
"0","4","very good - make it this way all the time - but no need to add water..."
"0","5","The best apple crisp I have eva made!!! I sprinkled a few walnuts on top, otherwise, followed it exactly!"
"0","5","This is a great simple recipe! It's so easy to make, and yet it tastes so great. :) Thank you!"
"0","4","This was really good, but a little too watery. If I make it again, I am definitely going to only put in half the water called for. It will probably be 5 stars then. I also doubled the 'crisp' part because I love it!"
"0","5","Scaled the recipe down for 4 people then doubled the topping plus added a hand full of walnuts Amazing! It was just as good the next day."
"0","2","I added less than half of the water called for and it still came out watered down and soupy. It could have been 3 stars but as the recipe is, I can only give 2 stars as I can't imagine why it calls for so much water. Still, even without the water I've had better apple crisp. Edible, but will not make again."
"0","5","Delicious - best ever. I used less water and doubled the topping."
"0","5","So yummy. I made the first batch basically according to the recipe. I added a little bit extra cinnamon over the apples and an extra tablespoon of butter to the topping. Perfect amount of topping as is. Served with cinnamon ice cream. The second batch was for an office potluck brunch. Added the extra cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and about 1/4 teaspoon cloves. Everyone raved."
"0","4","i put 1/2 the crust on bottom of 8' pan and then added apples,topped with remaining crust.~so after i got this into the oven i noticed that i had forgotten to add the sugar to the apples! but it still tasted great! i had used macitosh apples and they're sweet to begin with-i had also added about a 1/2 cup of chopped fresh cranberries-very good. i served the apple crisp with whip cream and poured a bit of carmel sauce on top. 1/3 cup butter, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, (boiled together) very yummy i will forsure make this again and NOT add the extra sugar!"
"0","5","This was amazing. I followed the recipe but used a smaller pan and fewer apples. Perfect amount of topping with the smaller pan."
"0","5","Amazing! I cut the recipe in half (only 5 cups of apples - fresh apples, right off the tree!), but left the crust recipe the same. I was only making it for 2! (and we ate it all). Also, I added nutmeg to the sugar mixture. This is my husband's new favorite."
"0","5","Delicious! Only problem is that this is VERY sweet. I doubled the crisp portion of the recipe, and will do so the next time except for the sugar, (both brown and white) reducing by half should do it."
"0","5","I double the crust because I like a lot of crust. I also toss the apples in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and add a little nutmeg."
"0","5","divine. I added raisins before the topping."
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I've ever had! We used Cortland apples and changed the water to 1/3 cup and it came out perfect."
"0","5","GREAT! Here's a serving tip: make your own warm custard to pour over the top before serving. Trust me- it's more delicious than ice cream and friends will be impressed by having their apple crisp with something creative!"
"0","5","Excellent! I took the advice of one reviewer and doubled the crumb mixture and used half for a bottom crust and half for top. YUM! It's been a few weeks since I've made this apple crisp and my boyfriend is already asking me when am I going to make it again."
"0","4","Very tasty and easy."
"0","5","Fanstastic as is, although I added more cinnamon and put it on ice cream. :)"
"0","4","I would give it 5 stars for taste, but I think that I needed to peel the apples first. Next time for sure!"
"0","5","This is the ultimate crisp recipe!! I have made it for years and everyone loves it. Melting the butter is not necessary. I use a pastry blender to mix it all to large crumbs and that creates a crunchier topping. Its hard to stop eating it!!"
"0","5","This recipe is outstanding... I really loved it! I used Braeburn apples, they are my favorite to bake with because they stay somewhat firm when cooked and give more of a bite instead of a squish that you get with some other apples. THe crumb topping was REALLY, REALLY good, however I agree with some other people who reviewed this recipe. It could use more of it. I think next time I will double the crumb recipe and use some on the bottom and on the top. But, GREAT recipe, and SO easy!!! This will be my top dessert for when I have company!"
"0","5","This was really delicious and a big hit at work. I can't imagine making double the topping, as some people mentioned. The amount listed makes almost too much in my opinion. I did use slightly less water than called for and it turned out great."
"0","5","Best Apple Crisp recipe. Made extra half batch of topping. Used 1/4 c water. Perfect."
"0","5","This was a huge hit at today's potluck! I may try it again tomorrow since there were NO leftovers from today's batch. I also want to try it with wheat germ in addition to the oats - a little more fiber and a little less guilt, right? Allrecipes.com comes through big for me once again!"
"0","4","Good. Not my absolute favorite, but defintely good. I would recommend like the many others before to only put in 1/4 cup water. Otherwise it is a bit runny."
"0","5","It was yummy, BUT FAR TOO SWEET. I will cut back on the sugar the next time."
"0","5","Eliminated the baking soda (BOX WAS EMPTY) and there happened to be an open can of coconut milk on the cupboard so I decided to substitute for the water. In a word...WOW!"
"0","5","Awesome. I did omit the water and will try a little less sugar next time.I did a a little nutmeg. I am not a big nutmeg fan and I think it would be good with or without it.I was out of brown suger so I used white in the oatmeal mixture and it was still great. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","3","this really wasn't very good. I should have followed directions and halved the amount of water. Regardless of that, however, the cooking time is also VERY off, and even though I sliced the apples very thinly, they were tough and rubbery and hard to eat instead of tender like apple crisp should be."
"0","4","A good recipe, but too sweet. Next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar to toss with the apples."
"0","5","Excellent, I followed some of the other additions. this is a new family favorite."
"0","5","I've made this several times for dinner parties and have never received any complaints, only requests for second helpings! Really can't go wrong with this dessert and so easy to prepare!"
"0","5","Yummy... I made this with other fillings too... Cherry was the best!"
"0","5","Delicious! I add extra cinnamon because I love cinnamon!"
"0","5","I was the star of the BBQ party with this dessert. My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made!!! Only alteration: leave out the 1/2 cup of water. I ended up tipping the pan to the side and spooning out 1/2 cup of extra juice after it had cooked. It was still awesome though!"
"0","4","I used about half the amount of sugars and water, and instead of melting the butter, I cut it into the topping mixture. I also made a little more topping because it's my favourite part. Used Spartan apples and Granny Smith apples, which worked out well."
"0","5","Wow! Either I had some magical apples or this is the magical recipe. This is fantastic. Make NO changes. Will make again and again."
"0","5","Just amazing! I keep getting requests for more!"
"0","5","Very Yummy! I halved the apples since there's only 2 of us but kept the topping amount the same. Like other reviewers I only put a fraction of the water in. I will be making this again and again and again."
"0","4","Very easy recipe. Will make again but may add a bit more spice to mine just to give it a tad bit more pizazz."
"0","5","Wow! Luved the crisy, crunchy topping! I didn't have quite enough apples, so I subbed in some pears, and peaches. Excellent!"
"0","5","great. it has a beautiful caremel flavour. Probably the best crisp I have ever made. The only change; I used barley flour in place of all purpose flour."
"0","5","Yum oh! For the apple portion of the recipe I followed the other suggestions and omitted the water. I substituted tapioca pudding for the flour and added the juice of one lemon to give the apples a little zip. It turned out great!"
"0","5","This is such a great recipe. My family loved it."
"0","5","My husband made a double batch of this for my family during a huge get together and people are still talking about it 6 months later. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! I double the crust and it is wonderful! I hardly lasts a day at my house."
"0","5","I love making this Apple Crisp.... and love eating it with vanilla ice cream... it's so delicious..."
"0","5","Used half the amount of sugar and water called for. Came out great. Rave reviews at potluck."
"0","5","This is fantastic. Though I did turn it into a pie, instead of a crisp. I cannot have the oats so I eliminated them and the water aswell. I used 4 good size granny smith apples. I mixed the first ingredients in a bowl with average sized apple slices and then poured them into a store bought pie crust. I then mixed the other ingredients in the bowl and it came out very thick, so I just placed it all over the apples and put the pie shell on and baked for 10 mins on 450 and another 40 mins on 350. Topped it with some regular cool whip. Awesome results. Im getting fatter by the minute. :( lol"
"0","5","SO good! I made it for a big gathering and every person LOVED it! The only thing I changed was the cinnamon - I upped it to 1 tablespoon. A for sure keeper!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it was Super good! I loved it and could not stop taking more!"
"0","5","Best apple crisp I have ever made, or eaten, and I am an apple crisp fiend!"
"0","5","This was really good and very easy!!! My husband and kids really enjoyed it as well. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this one again!"
"0","5","EASY and unbelievably tasty. I don't make apple pie anymore."
"0","4","A very yummy treat! Took the advice of others and cooked a bit longer than 45 mins! YUM! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This recipe is best when using Granny Smith apples. It was great!! I added a little extra cinnamon, though. Super served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"0","4","I thought it was very tasty...Only suggestions, I used unsalted butter and added about a tsp of salt to compensate. I also think you might want to bake longer than 45 minutes if you want the liquid from the apples to caramelize more. Otherwise delicious!"
"0","5","I have been ordered by my family to have this ready for every holiday season"
"0","4","It's too sweet, but it's very delicious otherwise. I put in 2/3 C white sugar, I think you could put in 1/2 C or less. And maybe add some nutmeg. And some chopped nuts to the topping if you like nuts"
"0","5","Excellent!!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I have ever made. I always get compliments when I take it to a gathering and I never bring home leftovers."
"0","5","I had never made apple crisp before so didnt have much to compare to. My husband said it was excellent! I doubled the topping like other reviews suggested to use half as the crust, I also cut the water in half and it came out a little dry. Otherwise I do not think it was too sweet. I used granny smith apples because some reviews said it was too sweet. I could have over cooked it which is why it came out dry, but a little more water would have been fine! I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the apples. Yummy dessert! We also topped with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious. This is a wonderful recipe, it even makes its own luscious sauce to drizzle over the crisp or over ice cream. Will be making this every time I'm craving something apple-y."
"0","5","Out of this world. I may never make plain old apple pie again. I followed recipe exactly. We took it to a double date and served it with vanilla ice cream, it was a hit."
"0","5","My husband could not stop eating this, and he doesn't even like apples! Very good recipe, however I did double the topping as others suggested. This is the only apple crisp I will make from now on."
"0","5","Best apple crisp ever! The whole HUGE pan was gone the second nice, only three people in the house  I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking and it make the crust have a nice granola-like feel to it. Very yummy! Added extra cinnimon over the top and served hot with cinnimon ice cream!"
"0","5","This is as good as it gets for a basic apple crisp. I halfed the recipe and then halfed the water and doubled the topping. Everyone enjoyed."
"0","5","I made this in my classroom with apples the kids brought. It was so delicious that I had the faculty asking for the recipe."
"0","5","This is VERY good apple crisp! Even way slimmed down it still tasted great. I'm getting ready to make another batch (first one was gone in less than 24 hours!! ) and I'm going to use even less of both sugars. Fantastic!"
"0","5","This was so delicious! I will 1/2 the water next time as suggested because I did feel it had a little too much juice. I used McIntosh apples which made it a little sweeter but oh so good! I also cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us and used a 8x8 square pan. The best apple crisp I have ever had! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Delicious! I used half the water called for, as some people suggested, and doubled the topping mixture. I'd make this again and again."
"0","5","I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and it was great. I am a 'food-fataphobic', so anytime I can made a recipe close to fat free, I do. In this case, I substituted a bit of butter spray (I can't believe it's not butter pump bottle) by pouring just enough to make the streusel crumbly...although it wasn't as crispy and buttery as the true recipe would have yielded, it was AWESOME...more like a chewy oatmeal broken up cookie sprinkled over the top."
"0","5","Wonderful!!!! The best apple crisp I've ever had, and very easy to make. I had several people ask for the recipe. I will make this again and again."
"0","5","This recipe was easy, moist, and absolutely yummy. Peeling the apples took the longest; and waiting for it to bake, of course. I used Granny Smith apples because they are on the tart side, and with all the sugar, it doesn't come out too sweet. I took it to the office for Thanksgiving and it disappeared. This is definately a keeper in my book."
"0","5","I like this recipe because you can prepare ahead. I kept the crumble topping seperate until time to bake and it turned out great."
"0","5","the Best!"
"0","5","I made this apple crisp for Thanksgiving and got RAVE reviews! I did make one substution and a two additions. 1...substituted 1 Tbspn flour for 2 Tbspn uncooked Tapioca. 2...added nutmeg & caramel to the apples. 3...I doubled the topping as suggested by many. Thank you for our new family favoritive recipe."
"0","4","I did not add water. I thought it was just ok, but everybody else loved it."
"0","5","Nice warm dessert -- yummy with vanilla ice cream on top! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I just loved this recipe. The big pan I made got eaten up in no time. This recipe is stupendous and so simple. The hardest part of the whole process was peeling the apples. Just great. Thanks so much!"
"0","4","I followed the other reviewers' advice: instead of doubling the crumb topping I cut the apples in half to only 5 cups. I then put 1/2 the topping on top and 1/2 on bottom. The apple crisp was accidentally was served cold (outside at a church picnic) and the topping on bottom was extremely difficult to scrape off. Make sure to either spray the pan first or serve it warm. Otherwise, the flavor was very good."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Delicious !! I made double recipe for the topping and added some nuts....it turned out extraordinary !!!!!"
"0","5","My family loves this and I like that it is big enough to share with a large group of people. I make sure I use a tart apple and I've never had a complaint that it was too sweet.  It is also awesome warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a drizzle of carmel sauce."
"0","5","Wowza...sooooooooooo good. I added nutmeg and tossed the sliced apples in with the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg before layering in the baking dish. I'll be making this one again."
"0","5","Got rave reviews from the family when I made this! A tad sweet, so I cut the brown sugar down a bit in the topping. Made it another time with chopped walnuts - a nice addition."
"0","5","don't let the picture fool you. this is a wonderful easy recipe that gets better the next day. thanks for sharing!"
"0","3","This was okay but I thought it was way too sweet. Everyone else liked it well enough though."
"0","4","Very good over vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","Wonderful! My husband loves the topping!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe!"
"0","5","This is truly a keeper. Everyone here loved it. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","Came out very well!"
"0","3","our family has made this twice. I'm going to follow some of the helpful suggestions of other reviewers and see if it makes a difference on our third try. Came out dry the first two times."
"0","5","This was excellent!"
"0","5","Scrumplicious recipe!! I baked it at 300°F for 1 hour, so that the apples could gently melt, and as others had suggested, I left out the water and cut down on the sugar. The result : Rave reviews from son and husband (who is always kinda picky about American cuisine). Will definitely be making it again and again from now on. Thanks a lot!!"
"0","4","I suggest doubling the topping but otherwise very good just a little sweet for us."
"0","5","My first crisp from scratch and it was a hit. I used Cortland apples as I like cooked apples that retain their shape."
"0","5","Such an easy and thorougly satisfying recipe, I've made it 4 times in the last month (by popular demand) and every time I love it more. Everyone complains about the sugar but use your discretion based on the apples you have. Its a must make...Enjoy everyone."
"0","5","This was so good! I didnt have any baking powder or baking soda, but it still turned out wonderful! I will definitley be making this one again! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This turned out excellent! After reading the reviews I wasn't sure if I should add the water, if I should double the topping recipe, etc. I ended up going with Honeycrisp apples and they were juicy so I didn't add water. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect."
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp I've ever had! It's quick and easy to prepare as well."
"0","5","I love this recipe! It's so easy and I make it in a pinch or when I have lots of left over apples. This recipe doesn't sound like much, but trust me it's full of flavor and everyone will like it. I top it with whip cream or use the apple crisp as an ice cream topping."
"0","5","I hosted a small birthday brunch yesterday and needed to bring in something for 'brunch monday' at work. So I used two 8 x 8 pans instead of the 9 x 13 (used more apples but the split the topping amongst the two pans). It was a hit at both functions! I did notice that my 'crisp' wasn't crisping as well as I would have liked, so I melted and additional 1 cup butter and poured half over each pan during the last 10 min of baking.... wonderful!!"
"0","3","This was just ok to us. Made exactly as directed. Wasn't crazy about the topping. I think because of the oats."
"0","5","YUMMY!!! I served this for desert during a dinner party, and we had the french vanilla cool whip over it, very , very good!"
"0","5","I forgot to add the water. I think it might be a little runny for my taste with it, so I will continue to make it this way. The topping is expecially tastey."
"0","5","good."
"0","5","This recipe was great! I made it with pears, but I should have peeled them. Also, I'm not sure if you need the water unless your fruit is particularly dry - but DO add a pinch of salt to the topping. Otherwise, I will definitely make this again! Thank you!"
"0","5","Loved the crunchy texture on the top on this apple crisp! I followed this recipe exactly other than adding a lot more apples and a larger size pan than the recipe suggested. I used Jonagold apples for this recipe. Everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe~"
"0","5","This is about as good as Apple Crisp gets! I followed others' advice and used 2/3C white sugar, no water, and chopped the apples. With fall apples (Mutsu - yum!), it was great."
"0","5","Thank you for sharing! I have always wanted to make this, but thought it would be to hard. It is sitting on my oven right now, fresh out and it tastes SO good! I am adding the my recipes and am already thinking of the people I can make this for! It is the BEST!"
"0","4","I made this with no water and half the white sugar as others suggested. I found the topping a little on the sweet side, and I prefer a more oat-y, crumbly topping. This satisfied my apple crisp craving for now, but I will try other recipes."
"0","4","I didn't have 10 apples so I wanted to half the recipe but forgot when I was adding the sugar. So... I added too much sugar but it all still turned out great! I used extra crisp topping too. It was gooey and sugary and so tastey. I am not giving it a five because it was really sweet (my fault). Oh and I used red apples."
"0","5","This apple crisp was the bomb. I used several different type of apples and a few pears. This is what was in my house. The golden delicious and macintosh turned to mush but the pears and granny smith did well. I used 1/4C. of water.And for the topping which was the best part I used 1 1/2 the amount called for. Thanks, I know this will become a favorite in my house."
"0","5","My first time making apple crisp. Very good and easy. I didnt add water. I let the apples and sugar sit while I finished cooking dinner and by the time I put it in the oven there was already juice in the bottom from the apples. I used a potato peeler to peel and then a apple corer to do the rest."
"0","4","Well, after all the rave reviews i decided to try this. I followed the advice of others and doubled the topping which I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and used only about 4tbls of water with the apple mixture. I found that doubling the topping was excessive and did not use all the mixture. The final result was just okay. It would not stand out as something to definately try again. Very simple to make though."
"0","4","i definately think this recipe does not need the water. i used red delicious, gala, and granny smith apples and the mix came out with water remaining in the bottom. it still came out and tasted really good after you dipped it out it just left alot of water in the pan. i know just not to use any water in it next time."
"0","4","The flavor was very good but the Granny Smith apples came out too soft, almost mushy. I will try leaving out the water next time."
"0","5","I thought it was great! I made the first time as instructed, but decided to use about half the water the next time because my apples were very juicy. Took it to work and got rave reviews! Thank you!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe to a T and it was delicious. My picky six year old LOVED it. It would have been perfect with some vanilla icecream and a cup of coffee."
"0","4","Delicious!! I left the water out because the apples were juicy enough - added water would have made it too liquidy. The rest of the recipe was perfect though! Thanks!"
"0","4","I used the advice of previous posters and eliminated the water and doubled the topping. I was glad I did. The only complaint I had was that the topping didn't get as crunchy as I would have liked. It tasted great, though. I wish I would have had some vanilla ice cream to serve with it."
"0","5","My husband was a little leary when I told him that I was making apple crisp. I decided to fry the apples a little before I cooked them as the recipe called for. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on them while they were cooking a little. I also doubled the topping to make it a little thicker. Then proceeded with the rest of the directions. It turned out GREAT!! My husband absolutely loved it and is now a fan of this apple crisp recipe! I will definitely make this one again!"
"0","4","When eaten warm, it was a bit mushy, but when it cooled more it was divine, like candy, yummy. Would definitely make again, but not serve right away."
"0","4","This was great! I would make more of the crisp on top. Peeling the apples takes a long time and is a lot of hard work."
"0","5","This was really good. I baked it until the top was crisp. Some people said it was mush so I baked it longer. It was very crispy on top. I think it could use less sugar or next time I would use more of a tart apple. I used Michigan apples which are sweet and tart. I would make this again."
"0","4","This recipe was perfect, except for one thing--I will use less water next time, maybe even 1/4 cup. Instead of melting into a syrup it left a lot of water in the bottom of the dish when I was done baking it. But it's still very very delicious!"
"0","3","Tasted ok. Wish I would have read previous review and left out the water. It turned out VERY leaky. Don't know if I would make again."
"0","5","Thanks so much for the recipe! It's a keeper. Made it today to take to a potluck tomorrow, which meant I had to make a second one for at home. It was wonderful still warm with vanilla ice cream.  Based on some of the other reviews, I omitted the water on top of the apples with good results."
"0","5","MMMM Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Will definately make this my standard crisp recipe."
"0","4","Agree with previous review. This was just okay. It tasted fine, however, it didn't live up to the rave reviews. The texture of the topping wasn't quite right. It was more like soft granola poured over apples. Maybe adding more butter to the mixture would solve that. There are better apple crisp recipes out there."
"0","5","This was a BIG hit at school. I take goodies to the football coaches every Friday and this recipe received the best comments so far. The Guys loved it. Thanks for the suggestions!"
"0","5","This recipe was excellent!! I also cut the water in half and it turned out just right. Next time I will make more topping, but only because I love it so much. I shared this with my in-laws tonight and they loved it too!!"
"0","5","Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and the whole family loved it."
"0","5","We loved this. The only problem is we ate it too quickly! The recommendation to cut down on the water was helpful. Even with only half of the water, it was more than juicy enough."
"0","5","FABULOUS!!!!! The best apple crisp I have ever made. I did add more of the crispy topping though.  Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","Positively the best apple crisp I have ever eaten."
"0","4","This smelled fabulous while in the oven. I used splenda white and brown sugar and it was wonderful. I used the honeycrisp apples for there great flavor, I think I would have put more apples in there but only had 4. I also used a square 8 x 8 pan because that was all that was available at the time. This was wonderful but I felt there could have been more of the delicious apples. The smaller pan made the topping thicker and I don't think I would double it when making in a smaller pan.  This was also the first apple crisp I have ever made and I was just happy that it turned out so well."
"0","5","Simply wonderful just the way it is! It's famous in my hous."
"0","5","Thanks for a great recipe! This is my first time making apple crisp and will definitly make this again! It was very easy! I doubled the topping but found it to be a bit powdery, so I added a little more butter to keep the consistency. It was fabulous!"
"0","5","wonderful!!! this was my first time making homemade apple crisp and i'm so glad i used this recipe..we devoured it!! and it was sooo easy!! thanks"
"0","5","best apple crisp i have ever made."
"0","3","Although I am not an apple crisp pro, i found this recipe to sweet and very liquidy on the bottom of the pan."
"0","3","I am somewhat suprised at all the high ratings this one got. The topping was very good, but it's a pretty standard recipe. The apples weren't very good though. Adding the water to the apples made it soupy and rinsed away all the apple seasonings. Will try a different recipe or omit water next time."
"0","5","This was really yummy! I didn't eat it with the ice cream, though. I used green apples, reduced the quantity of sugar and butter. Still, it was wonderful! I also added some cinammon. Thanks for such a s'wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","I was out of oatmeal, so I used 1 Cup of crushed Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon cereal. WOW...the topping was amazing!"
"0","5","This was great as I expected it to be. I scaled it to two servings and baked for 25 minutes in two ramekins. This was so good I ate both servings for myself :-)"
"0","5","This is one of the best apple crisps ever! I used 1/2 c dark brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar in the topping because that was all I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It came out great, can't wait to try it with different kinds of fruit."
"0","5","I made this with apples that I had just picked from my dad's apple tree. I brought it to work with some cool whip and one of my co-workers said it was the best apple crisp she has ever had! It looked, smelled and tasted delicious! Great recipe that I will make again and again this fall!"
"0","5","All I can say is FABULOUS! I made a half batch since it was only me and my daughter. I served it with Pecan Praline ice cream. I also added vanilla extract and omitted the water like someone else mentioned. I am too embarassed to say that we ate the entire dish.   Andreaetta"
"0","5","I made this for my father he loves apple crisp and he said it was one of the best he's ever had. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","The best"
"0","5","This is awesome!!!"
"0","5","This was a great recipe. I made a few changes to it, including the following, sugar-1/4 cup, 3/4 cup Splenda. Also, added rasins and walnuts to taste in the topping as well as doubling up on the recipe for the topping. Once I had the dish ready to go into the oven I poured sugar-free maple sugar onto the top of dish to make it a little more wet. I added the full amount of water, and I think the recipe needed it or else it would have been too dry.  The recipe turned out great and we ate it with vanilla bean ice cream. The recipe makes a pretty big portion, so my boyfriend and I will be eating it for about a week!"
"0","5","This is the best apple crisp ever! Thanks so much - it will become a family favorite!"
"0","3","WAY too much sugar. Next time I'll cut the white sugar in half. Also eliminated the water as others had suggested. Other than that, good recipe."
"0","4","this recipe is great. just as other people did, i doubled the topping. I also found it a little sweet so next time I will cut down on the brown sugar and add sprinkle a little bit of lemon juice instead of the water."
"0","5","Perfect !"
"0","3","Just ok"
"0","5","every june myself and 7 gal cousins meet for a weekend reunion and each one of us is assigned a meal item,of which mine was dessert this year.Everyone raved about the apple crisp!!They all said it was absolutly out of this world and the best they had EVER Had!!I agree with all of it,absolutly delicious!! I had requests for it next year even though I am to do a main dish!! Thanks for a great dessert!!"
"0","5","I used a half recipe with a quart of home-canned apples. I cut down the sugar a bit. It was very good and I've added this recipe to my collection."
"0","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and it got requested again for Christmas. My boyfriend absolutly loved it and so did the whole family. I will be making this I'm sure every year!"
"0","5","Wonderful! Even better cold for breaffast. :) I will increase the butter half a stick next time, the crumbly section was a little powdery."
"0","5","yummy!"
"0","5","AMAZING! And very addictive too!"
"0","4","This was really good, but way too sweet for us. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. Here we go again...used about 15 apples and doubled the topping(oats with flax and bran), 1/2 the brown sugar and no sugar in the apples. Pecans, chopped into the topping. Delish!"
"0","5","The combination of the tart McIntosh apples and the crunchy sweetness of the topping is wonderful. It is equally good warm or cold. This is definitely a keeper!!"
"0","5","Great way to eat those oats and fruit."
"0","5","Wow, this is awesome! I used half the amount of apples and made it in an 8x8 pan. I took the advice of other reviewers and tossed the sliced apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture. I also used the full amount of topping mixture. It's incredible and easy! Try it with caramel ice cream."
"0","5","So Yummy! Wonderful! We loved it!"
"0","4","lynn goodwein this recipe is real good!"
"0","5","This apple crisp is sooooooo love in my family."
"0","5","Really great recipe! I, too, followed the advice of others and made 1 1/2 the amount of crisp. Very excellent warm with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","Wow! This is amazing. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. It was loved by all!"
"0","5","This is such a good recipe. It's easy to make and the taste is superb. I liked how the topping was crunchy. It is better than my mother-in-law's recipe! Sorry mom. This recipe is definately a keeper. I scaled this down to a three person serving because this is a big batch."
"0","5","Yummy. We had a dinner party here last week, and this dessert was a big hit. I liked it since it was so easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This was great! Next time I'll make extra crust for the topping."
"0","4","Very good. Everyone enjoyed. Some put whip cream others vanilla ice cream. Best when still a little warm"
"0","5","Loved the topping! The apples turned out a little too sweet for my taste so will use a little less sugar next time, but otherwise this was a hit with the family."
"0","5","It is the best!!!!! When my family of 11 agrees totally on something, it has to be good."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. I followed the advice of others and reduced the amount of sugar. I also sprinkled some lemon juice (1T) on the apples. I loved the way the melted butter held the crisp topping together in big, crunchy chunks. Will make again and again!"
"0","5","A little on the sweet side"
"0","5","Delicious. I cut the recipe down a lot so fiddled with proportions a little and I added a little nutmeg. I used Splenda for the sugar mix and cut back the brown sugar by half. It was sweet but not overpowering. This is a keeper!"
"0","5","I usually try a receipe the first time exactly as written - then change if needed. I felt the apples were a little over done and will shorten the bake time in the future. I spooned the warm crisp into a glass bowl inverting each scoop so that the apples were on top as I layered it. It made a nice presentation with the slightly runny water/sugar combination turning into a wonderful sauce."
"0","4","I used half of the white sugar granny smith apples and i sprinkled the top with nutmeg and it was good. I will probably use less water becase I cooked it 10 less and the apples were still too soft for my taste. But other then that it was great but not as good as my other apple crisp recipe."
"0","5","Yummy recipe my family loved it. I used granny smith apples and 1/4 sugar and very little water."
"0","5","I totally screwed up this recipe and it still tasted amazing. I forgot to buy the oats and baking soda and put in too much butter, but it was good. I'll be making this again. Thank you."
"0","5","Excellent and VERY easy! I used macintosh apples and more cinnamon and it was just out of this world. I made it for two hungry men and they just devoured it, of course it was served with homemade whipped cream and vanilla ice cream!!!"
"0","5","Love this recipe, but needed to modify so it wasn't too sweet. Used only 1/4 cup of sugar in the filling and didn't add any water. With the sugar in the topping, it was sweet enough."
"0","4","Yep, yummy, yummy! Too rich when you daouble the topping. Go one and a half times I think. Use a little less water, and tart apples! Great recipe!"
"0","5","Definitely a phenominal dessert. Always great with some vanilla ice cream. Everyone I made it for LOVED it."
"0","5","Wow! YUMMY. We used Macintosh apples and they were a great balance with the sweetness of the topping! My husband practically ate the entire pan in a couple of days!"
"0","5","Great recipe. Highly recommended. Definately double the topping. I didnt double the butter to save on calories. But turned out great. Also, I only used about 1/4c water. Turned out great!!!! Will make again."
"0","5","Oh my goodness...this is so good. I also doubled the topping and next time will cut down on the sugar a little. I used Empire apples, which may account for the sweetness. I also added a handfull of chopped pecans. I'll be making this again for a luncheon on Thursday. Thanks!!"
"0","5","I couldn't stop eating thia once it came out of the oven!! Better with french vanilla ice cream on it."
"0","5","I have made this several times now. Each time it disappears quickly. Like someone else suggested, I doubled the topping, since that is the best part. It's definately a recipe that went into my keeper file."
"0","5","This was amazing. Top it off with the best vanilla ice cream you can find and you've got yourself a bowl of heaven....all my friends LOVE this."
"0","5","This was wonderful apple crisp. Easy and it came out perfect. Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again."
"0","5","Wow! EASY and YUMMY!! I would omit the water next time and use 3/4 cup white sugar like the others...but overall this is an outstanding apple crisp."
"0","5","Excellent, easy to make recipe. I prepared it with my class of 10 elementary students for 30 people -- it was easy and delicious!"
"0","5","very good!!!!!!! I always double the topping though b/c i love it so much!!! Wonderful recipe! THank you thank you!!"
"0","5","Very good! Can't wait to get more apples:)"
"0","5","Very tasty. Made it as written except that I also doubled the topping. Too good not to. Thanks Diane"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe for a party and it turned out amazing. Many people had seconds and others asked to take some home. I will definately be making this again soon!"
"0","5","I made this for a potluck tonight. It was a big hit. The only changes I made were using 3/4 cup sugar with apples, doubling the topping and using cinnamon-plus from Pampered Chef. It was a huge hit! Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I have never rated a recipe before, but this one deserves it! All I have to say is this tastes like soft yummy oatmeal cookies over apple pie! Definately double the crumble topping, I put it in my new 9X13 stoneware and what a way to break it in! Awesome!"
"0","5","This was a wonderful treat! I also didn't use granny smith apples so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 a cup and used only a 1/4 cup of water. I also doubled the topping and added cinnamon."
"0","5","This was my first time making apple crisp, and it was excellent! I followed others' advice and increased the butter, and also increased the amount of topping. I used apples off my sister-in-law's tree, which I guess weren't at tart as Granny Smith, because it was a tad too sweet, so next time I'd reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.   I now think my Apple Crisp rivals my mothers!"
"0","5","this recipe is awsome!!!! One of the best I have tried or rather my 7 year old daughter and her friend tried. It turned out great!!! Thanks"
"0","5","So easy and delicious that my guests actually asked for a doggie bag! I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the crisp and decreased the sugar on the apple filling. I also never add water to my fruit fillings. Fantastic."
"0","4","Pretty good! I will keep trying new recipes for the sake of finding the absolutely perfect apple crisp. But this one does taste great. Next time I'd try slicing the apples thicker since they seem to turn to mush when they're so thin. I only added 1/4 cup of water to the apples and also added some cinnamon to the topping mixture. Mine needed to bake for an hour."
"0","5","SO GOOD! Can't wait to make it again!"
"0","5","I did the recipe as written but used a 9x13 inch pan and used Macintosh and Cortland apples. The apples lost their shape, but it was still DELICIOUS."
"0","5","This apple crisp is the BEST I've ever made. I threw all my other recipes for Apple Crisp out and replaced them with this one. This is a keeper that is for sure. I also doubled the topping."
"0","5","yummy recipe!! i used pears from my tree and instant maple and brown sugar oats and was so good. thanks for sharing this great recipe"
"0","5","WE HAVE A FEW APPLE TREES IN OUR BACK YARD AND THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO USE SOME OF THE APPLES. I DID INCREASE THE BUTTER TO 1 CUP AS SUGGESTED AND I USED CINNAMON INSTANT OATMEAL."
"0","5","Wow! This recipe was unexpectedly good! Like others previously said, I omitted the water, doubled the topping, increased the butter by a 1/2 cup, and it came out perfectly! Our guests loved it and I even gave a copy to my cousin who said she would make it for her friend! The best apple crisp I've had in a long time!"
"0","5","Excellent! Used as many apples as would fit in 9x13' baking dish. Doubled crumble mixture, adding 1 tsp cinnamon and increasing butter to 1 1/2 c so it would turn out crisp, not crunchy. Added 1/2 c chopped walnuts to white sugar/flour/cinnamon mixture and increased cinnamon to 2 tsp. Used 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp lemon juice, reducing water to 1/4 c. So good it was bad...we ate it for breakfast :~)"
"0","4","love this recipe i make it alot and everybody i made it for loved it.  thanks Jarvis"
"0","4","This was good, and so easy! The only thing was that it was WAY too sweet. The apple flavors didn't come through at all. Next time I will decrease the white sugar and omit the water as suggested. It's still a keeper!"
"0","5","This was great! Will make it again and again."
"0","4","We love this recipe! This is the only apple crisp recipe that I use. Like the others, I omit the water & peel the apples. I also double the topping, as it 'makes' the recipe! I don't really measure the cinnamon, however, as we love cinnamon & also add a touch of nutmeg to it. Gives great flavor!"
"0","5","This apple crisp is absolutely delicious! I ended up having to use more butter than the recipe called for (about double), and next time I will probably skin the apples. I also completely omitted the water like others suggested. But this recipe tasted wonderful! I used all-natural, all organic ingredients, and this recipe was wonderful to boot! Highly recommended! Thanks so much for this simple, tasty recipe. It's great!"
"0","5","delicious!!! easy.. I also added a lil bit of vanilla extract to it and served it with vanilla icecream!!!"
"0","5","Hooray! What a yummy dessert. It was a little watery, but it was a good kind of watery for us."
"0","5","This recipe rocks! I think it's the best apple crisp I've ever had. I did make 1 1/2 times the amount of crisp to have an extra thick topping and it was delicious! The crisp is perfectly sweet and crumbly and so easy! Thanks, I've been looking for a recipe like this!"
"0","5","This was great! I decreased the water as everyone seemed to recommend and I also used half Quick oats and half Whole oats for more texture. I didn't double the topping, but was very pleased with the turnout!"
"0","5","This was great! I replaced 2 cups of apples with sliced frozen strawberries, used about 3/4 cup of sugar (it was still plenty sweet, I would go to 1/2 cup next time as recommended by others) and 1/3 cup of water. I made 1.5 times the topping, this was perfect. With vanilla ice cream on top, it was a hit!"
"0","5","My husband and I loved this one! I used Pink Lady apples and they keep their firmness and tartness after cooking. Yum!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious. I followed the recommendations of others and was very pleased. I used just 4 Granny Smith Apples (med-large in size) in a 9 inch square pan and kept all the other ingredient quantities the same. I also omitted the water as recommended, and that worked out great as well. I will definitely be making this again."
"0","4","My best friend asks for this over and over. I'm pretty fond of it, too!"
"0","4","It's good, no complaints. It wasn't really anything special, but it was good. DO NOT add the water. There is plennnnnty of liquid without water."
"0","4","Yum. It takes awhile to peel and slice all the apples but it's worth it. I made extra of the oatmeal mix like others suggested and it is a good idea to not add the water because to the apple portion because it gets runny. This is very sweet so it tastes best with ice cream."
"0","5","Very good dessert and so easy to make! My whole family enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again."
"0","5","Excellent...so easy and delicious. I made it the morning of our dinner and used regular oats and it still came out perfect."
"0","5","This was delicious! I made it for work and everyone loved it! Next time I will add more topping."
"0","5","I used half white sugar, half brown sugar. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8' square pan, but did not cut the topping in half. I sprinkled the topping with untoasted almonds before baking. It was delicious!!"
"0","5","I used 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar. I also reduced the water by half. Everyone really enjoyed the apple crisp. I will make it again."
"0","5","This was awesome!!! My mom thought is was from a box! I did one thing different. I used 1/2 cup more oats then what it called for. We also put a dollop of cool whip on each of our slices for a wonderful tasty treat. I will keep this recipe for my recipe box!! Thank you Diane!"
"0","5","After comparing this to some other recipes, I it so much I probably shouldn't review it at all, but anyway, it was delicious! For the apples, I used 8 C of fairly sweet apples, 1/2 C of sugar, a tsp of cinnamon as stated, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 2 T each of cornstarch and water. This created a very yummy, gooey sauce - not watery at all. I added 1 C of pecans to the topping and also cut in 1/4 C of shortening with the butter because it seemed too dry at first. All I know is that it tasted great and lasted less than a day!"
"0","4","Used less water and white sugar... came out great! Thanks"
"0","5","better than everybody else's...kekekeke its in the oven now and i cant wait to eat it!!!! i like to use half demerra and half regular brown sugar...it has a deeper flava :)"
"0","5","I brought this to work and everyone raved about it. The pan was completely empty in 15 minutes. Everyone said it was better than apple pie. I did use granny smith apples."
"0","5","Very good. I used 6 apples and cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and left the water out. I also used a slightly smaller baking dish. Probably about 7X11. I will be making this again and again!"
"0","5","Easy & scrumpcious. A family favorite!"
"0","5","Wonderful! I thought slicing the apples would be rough, but it isn't and it's so worth it."
"0","5","2nd time I made this, I halved the white sugar. Still very good."
"0","5","Best crisp ever! The toppping was crispy. I used 3 different kinds of apples and added 1/2 cup of cranberries."
"0","5","This was fed to a large number of guys and they all loved it. It is a good sized recipe as well!"
"0","5","This is excellent! I use less sugar,and no leavening in the topping, so it is more crumbly, also I 1 1/2 the topping. MMMM so good!"
"0","5","HUGE hit at my house any time I make it and always requested for holidays and special occassions. I use a little less water and add cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious - the best apple crisp I have ever had! I (like previous reviewers) also used about 1/2 the water and it was perfect."
"0","5","With a couple of minor modifications definately the best Apple Crisp recipes I've used! My suggestions - skip the water, but mix the apples with the dry ingredients and let sit for @ 15 minutes before covering with 1&1/2 times the crumble. Almost better than Grandma's!"
"0","4","Very good, but the topping was lite. I made this again with 1 and 1/2 the topping and it was MUCH better."
"0","5","Excellent & easy! Nix the water (not at all necessary). Doubled the topping. Allowed to sit in the oven (off) at the end. Thinking about putting even more of the topping in the processor & forming a bottom crust, too. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","This was soooooooo good. I substituted pecans for the almonds and added a can of lite cherry pie filling. Served it for dessert tonight and there is none left!!"
"0","4","Good recipe, thank you. I made as described only reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup as I anticipated it would be sweet enough without the full cup and was correct. The only reason I give this one four stars, was after it finished cooking the full 45 minutes and cooled, there was quite a bit of water/liquid still in the bottom. The flavor was quite nice, but the watery effect underwhelmed me. I will make this again but perhaps omit the water entirely in light of how much moisture is in the apples."
"0","5","Excellent - - - exactly what I was looking for. Easy enough for a child to help with. It tasted wonderful and smelled fantastic."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving and am making it again for Christmas. It was a BIG hit! The only request was that I double the topping. I should have read the reviews first! :)"
"0","5","I made this dish for an alternative Thanksgiving dessert when I found out a friend didn't care for pumpkin pie. It was easy, delicious and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
"0","5","I didn't have plain quick oats. Instead, I used 3 Quaker Oats apple cinnamon flavored packets. I think this made the recipe even more delicious!"
"0","5","I made this for my grandpa's birthday, and he loved it! The only thing I did was use about 7=8 green granny smith apples...i also doubled the juice, and then added an additional half recipe to the topping. I'm for sure going to make this again!"
"0","5","This was very good. I doubled the 'crisp' and I recommend you serve this warm! It still tasted great the next day but didn't last long after that. Thanks!"
"0","4","A bit too sweet for my liking but I got many complements. Like others..I thought it had a bit too much liquid in it when all was said and done. The apples for me took a bit longer to cook than the 45 minutes."
"0","5","Fabulous!!! i have got so many great reviews on this recipe. Everyone should use it!!! You will never go back to your old one. Thanks!"
"0","5","This is my boyfriend's ABSOLUTE favorite dessert ever. He always gets me to make this for him on Sunday afternoons, and it is gone by Monday afternoon. It's just perfect and I have never like cooked fruit, but I love this!"
"0","4","This was good, but I substituted cranberry juice (100% juice) instead of the water. I think I'd add a sweeter apple too...I used granny smith. The crisp was very crispy, but needed to cook longer than suggested time."
"0","5","Made this for a large group. It was a favorite. Very easy and it turned out excellent. Will make again!"
"0","5","Made this twice. First time, doubled the amount of crisp as many suggested but found I like more apples to crisp. Second time, used delicious apples and splashed them with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, used only 2 tablespoons sugar, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, substituted apple cider for the water and topped it with the crisp from the recipe. Also, prepared it in a deep ceramic cassarol and baked for 1 1/3hrs. Amazing desert and was a big hit with the family! Thanks and enjoy!"
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious. I just added a bit of nutmeg to the apples and the next time I make it I think I will add some chopped nuts to the topping. I was also thinking of soaking some raisins in rum and adding them to the apples.......YUM"
"0","4","Good crisp, but I think water can be omitted. The hardest part of the work is slicing the apples, but it guarantees you freshness."
"0","3","needs to cook longer...okay recipe"
"0","5","Loved it!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. I omitted the water and cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup as others had mentioned. It is still juicy and sweet enough. I used cortland apples. yum yum"
"0","5","Very good, better than Apple pie!!!"
"0","4","I made this last night - cut half the sugars, omitted the water, per the other posters' advice. It turned out really good - not as sweet as I would have liked so next time I'm going to keep the sugar measurement for the crisp. You might want to toss the sugar/cinnamon topping with the apples so all of the slices get coated too. I'm definitely making this again."
"0","5","It starts with the aroma of the baking apples, I used Macintosh, Gala, Golden Delicious and Granny Smith sliced thin on a simple Mandoline. I added the juice of one one small lemon to the apples to prevent browning. Otherwise this recipe was absolutely perfect. Mad it in split quanataties in two 9 inch disposable cake pans sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. VERY YUMMY!"
"0","5","Loved it!"
"0","5","This is the perfect Crisp when made with Jonagold apples. I made it for my work group and they all wanted the recipe."
"0","4","Very tasty but definitely minor changes needed: do not add water,Cut white sugar by half, add lemmon juice over just cut applea. Family really liked it. Great for next day breakfast but not as crisp."
"0","4","I doubled the cinnamon and the crumble. I also halved the water. Next time I will probably add some nutmeg and leave the water out completely. We loved this apple crisp!"
"0","5","All I can say is WOW. This was a really great apple crisp and so easy to make. I made double the topping as many people suggested and added some nutmeg. I think I'm going to eat some more for breakfast!"
"0","4","This tasted great. I put less water and less sugar and found that it was perfect. Will make again."
"0","3","it was very good, but a little too sweet for my family. i cut the recipe in half & used 1/2 cup sugar on the raw apples. next time i'll use less & add some cinnamon to the topping - which was yummy!"
"0","5","Just made this last night. I received raving reviews on how good it was. I added nutmeg as well to the dry ingredients and more cinnamon because I love the taste of cinnamon. It was fabulous! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","My boyfriend's response was WOW BABY!! I love apple crisp like ANYtime...but this really is a great recipe. I used margarine instead of butter--still yummy. Thanks a bunch Dianne."
"0","5","Excellent! Used the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping and omitted the water. I also added 1/3 c. dried cranberries, 1 tsp. each of vanilla, lemon juice and apple pie spice (instead of cinnamon) to the apple filling to enhance the flavor. The children loved it, despite the oats!Very easy and a fabulous Fall recipe. Serves a big crowd. THANK YOU for the recipe."
"0","3","its pretty standard. I would also make more topping as its the best part , it doesnt need the water which pools are the bottom and stays water after its cooked. I used a mixture of fall northen apples since I just went apple picking and cant tell them apart. I added more spice, I used a high quality apple pie spice mixture and I also added ground Ginger to the topping. I thought this was excellent with extra sharp chedder cheese served on the side~! I would add a bit more butter also overall."
"0","4","i only had 5 small apples on hand which ended out to be 5 cups of apples. so i halved the apple recipe but kept the topping recipe. this recipe is a keeper."
"0","4","Came out a bit watery."
"0","4","Halved the apples (used 3 granny smith) and sugar, used a bit more flour to coat well, only used a drop or two of water, kept the topping recipe as written (if I was making this for a 9 x 13 I would definitely double the topping recipe), placed all in a 9 x 9 and it was done in about 35 minutes. House smelled great and it tasted even better!"
"0","5","AWESOME!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Excellent, followed the recipe exactly, using macintosh apples."
"0","5","This recipe is awesome! My family and friends love it. Very easy to prepare!"
"0","5","One of my very, very favorite recipes!"
"0","4","Good, but too sweet. I would reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 c. and 1/3 c. white sugar instead of 1/2 c. Double the crumb mixture."
"0","5","my fiance and i could not stop eating this!!! (good thing we scaled the recipe to 3 servings) a definite crowd pleaser"
"0","2","Made this for a family gathering and no one liked it. I followed the directions and doubled the topping as others suggested, I don't know what went wrong - maybe the family does not like apple crisp. PS it taste horrible cold (room temp.)"
"0","5","I've made numerous apple crisps and this one was the best! I too doubled the topping. Really makes a difference. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
"0","5","First apple crisp recipe I've used, but this one is great!! The water is not necessary though..."
"0","5","This is the most delicious apple crisp I have ever had! The only change I made was ommiting the water. The water is not needed. This apple crisp forms a delicious syrup on the bottom of the pan, which is great to drizzle on the top. Definetly a keeper! Thanks!"
"0","2","I didn't love this topping. I think a traditional crisp topping would be better. I'll definitely make it again, and do my own topping."
"0","4","Great recipe, I doubled the topping as advised. I reduced the water by half, but will omit next time."
"0","5","I have made this twice and it was a HUGE success. Probably the best dessert I have ever made. My boyfriend who only likes chocolate desserts has requested this for his birthday. The only change I made was to double the topping like some people suggested. I will make this often!!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I had many compliments on this apple crisp. I thought it was a bit sweet but everyone else loved it. I used mostly Jonathan apples but had a few others I also threw in. I also added cinnamon and vanilla to the crisp part.I may try 3/4 c. sugar on the apples the next time if I use the same kind. Was delicious warmed then with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","MOUTH WATERING..SIMPLY DELICIUS..AWESOME THANKS FOR SHARING! :O)"
"0","5","This was awesome! I took the advice of the readers and omitted the water and doubled the crumbs. Took it to work for a treat and it was gone in 10 minutes. Everyone wanted to know who made the apple crisp! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","I've been searching for a really good apple crisp recipe for quite a while. I tried the Apple Crisp II recipe today and my search has ended."
"0","5","WOW! Helped my brother make this and it turned out amazing. We added a smash of maple extract to the water. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe!"
"0","4","I thought it was good. I served it to some guests and they wanted the recipe. I am still looking for the perfect crisp! But this will do until then.... Next time I would reduce the amount of sugar on the apples..."
"0","5","FABULOUS!!"
"0","5","Made this with apples off of our tree, and it was wonderful! Tastes just like apple crisp is supposed to. Perfect with vanilla ice cream, and would also be good with whipped cream. A must try!"
"0","5","Really delicious! Will use others advice and not use water and thankyou for suggesting Granny Smith and Jonathan apples. Never would have known."
"0","5","I used this recipe with blueberries. Great old fashioned topping, nothing fancy, will use this again with other seasonal fruit. Delicious!"
"0","3","The topping turned out dense and thick. I reduced the water and white sugarr and it still seemed to be too much. Sorry, I'll keep looking for a new crisp recipe."
"0","5","This is AWESOME!!! No substitutions...except for a dollop of vanilla ice cream. THIS is what autumn is all about! Enjoy."
"0","5","this recipe always comes out great. I use granny smith apples and serve it with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","i thought it was great. perfect amounts of everything"
"0","4","I also doubled the topping and added nutmeg to the recipe. I thought it was very good over ice cream, however I would have preferred a more crunchy topping."
"0","5","This is a very good crisp,but I doubled the topping(thats the best part)made it very good"
"0","5","i was looking for a crumble topping and this was perfect! I used 1 tin of pineapple instead of the apples and only used the topping to cover the pineapple instead of mixing the pineapple with the other ingredients. next time i will used 2 cans of pineapple instead or i will half the amount of topping.  Thanx for this great recipe i will definately use it again!"
"0","5","I used to make a recipe similar to this when I was young, before I was married. For more years than I will admit I used my husband's family recipe and missed the oatmeal...not any more. This is perfect, just like I remember Apple Crisp to be."
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe. I did cut down on the white sugar to 2/3 cup but felt that the topping ingredients were more than enough for a 13' x 9' pan. I also omitted the water because I thought it would come out too mushy. My family could not get enough of this recipe and it also received raves at a dinner party that I gave."
"0","5","very good, used 10 apples."
"0","5","Yummy! I've made this three times now and it's always a hit. The only change I make is to use a little more cinnamon in the topping mix and sprinkle 2/3 cup of white sugar over the apples and not 1 cup."
"0","5","Excellent! I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8 pan, added a few crushed ginger cookies to crumb topping and cut back on brown sugar a bit. Have made a couple of times...so good!!"
"0","5","YUM!!! Great with vanilla soy ice cream."
"0","5","Definitely the best apple crisp I've ever made. This recipe even inspired my dad to bake. Although some people commented about too much sugar, I've actually been inclined to add more brown sugar - chalk it up to a super sweet tooth."
"0","4","Overall, very good. Got lots of compliments. I doubled the crisp topping and used apple pie spice as someone else mentioned. Next time I would halve the amount of sugar that goes ontop of the apples. Too sweet for my liking. I used Macintosh apples which tasted great, except too much sugar cut out thier sweet/sour taste."
"0","5","this was excellent!!! I used red delicious because that is what I had, cubed the apples instead of sliced and instead of sugar I drizzled maple syrup over the apples. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping....this will be 'my' new recipe :) thanks Diane!!!!"
"0","4","This was very delicious, but no more delicious than most apple crisps that i've had.... Apple crisp is pretty hard to mess up as long as you've got the basics in your recipe."
"0","5","I made this recipe for my husband who hates apples but he just loved this. We couldn't get enough. Best i've ever had."
"0","5","I absolutely adore this recipe! I picked several bushels of apples this year and we NEVER got sick of eating this crisp! I only used 1/4 of water and 1/4 cup of white sugar. I think the topping amount is perfect, however my hasband has told me he would like it even better if it were doubled. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars, it is wonderful!"
"0","5","easy to make & everyone loves it"
"0","5","I would give this 10 stars if I could. This was absolutely deeeeelish!!! Probably my new favorite recipe off of allrecipes. I used 6 Granny Smith apples and used only a teensy bit of water. Served straight out of the oven over french vanilla ice cream is the way to go."
"0","5","i only used the apple part and i put it on pancakes, it was really good. thank you"
"0","5","I cut the apple recipe in half, but used the full recipe for the crumble on top. I also cubed the apples instead of slicing them. I think this makes it easier to scoop and eat. Then I baked the whole thing in an 8x8 pan."
"0","5","We loved this recipe. Will make again. We put carmel sauce over it warm. Really made it good."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I used 3 kinds of apples for a bit of variety and it worked well. Would add more crumble to the top, but that's an easy adjustment. MMMMmmmm..."
"0","5","My family loves this apple crisp. They say that there is nothing like homemade apple crisp."
"0","5","YUMMY!!! I halved the apples and sugar mixture to put in a smaller dish. I used English cooking apples (Bramley Apples) because of their super tartness and boy am I glad! I also added nutmeg to the white sugar and cinnamon. This is the BEST apple crisp/crumble recipe ever. Thank you so much!"
"0","5","I have made quite a few diffrent apple crisp in the past few years and this one is by far the best. I followed the lead of other reviewers and left out the water and doubled the topping. This recipe rises above the rest in taste and in presentation. It is perfect for any occasion and makes the house smell really good!!!"
"0","5","Perfect!! Just like mom used to make. I loved the large size."
"0","5","I had good luck with this recipe. I did eliminate the water (the apples were wet anyway) and I used some lemon juice. We really enjoyed it warm with Ice cream, and I took it to work cold and enjoyed it that way as well. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","3","Too Sweet! I cut back on both sugars and it was still so sweet we could hardly eat it even with icecream, and I'm a certified sweet-aholic. The topping is especially sweet. Probably won't make again."

"0","5","Really great recipe. I only had a few macouns left over, so I used braeburn, not ideal but it was great. I didn't have enough apples to halve the recipe and didn't read it thoroughly, so I threw everything in a bowel, measuring by eye, put it over the apples and it came out wonderful."

"0","5","This recipe was awesome. I followed the topping recipe to the letter, but the filling was quite a bit different. I sliced 3 very large ripe white peaches, and mixed them with a jar of Smucker's 100% Fruit Black Raspberry jam instead of sugar, then I added around 1/4 cup lemon juice (until it was tart enough!) Then I added 1 T of flour and stirred it in.... The finished product was so good, I know I'll be using this topping recipe on all kinds of fresh fruit. Thanks Diane!"
