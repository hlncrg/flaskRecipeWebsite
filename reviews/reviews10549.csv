"5378","5","These brownies are magnificent!!! I mean 'melt in your mouth' and I didn't even make the frosting. I doubled the recipe and it still won't be enough. There are a few tips that will ensure your brownies are not cakey. I do not use a mixer because you can overmix your batter and whip too much air into the eggs. This makes your brownies have a cakey texture. Mix everything by hand in a bowl and lightly beat your eggs before adding them to the mixture. Gently stirring everything together makes them turn out better as opposed to franticly beating the mixture. Hope this helps, because I will NEVER buy brownie mix again."
"3569","5","I doubled the recipe and made a 9x13 pan of these brownies for a party, and everybody loved them! I also entered them in my local county fair and won first place. The problem with the frosting is that you need to halve the amount of powdered sugar and melt the butter. This makes a glaze that you can spread on top. It hardens into a beautiful, shiny frosting. I thought some of the info in the reviews was conflicting, so here's the scoop: 1. These are neither 'cake' brownies nor 'fudge' brownies; they fall somewhere in between. If you must have one or the other, then this recipe is not for you. 2. Yes, the frosting is sweet. If you like frosting, then add it, if not, leave it off. 3. Yes, these are homemade brownies and do not taste like boxed brownie mix. I can't understand why anyone would prefer a mix to homemade, but if that's your thing, then stick with the mix."
"2477","5","These are great! I changed the recipe to make them better for you. I used 1/2 c. applesauce instead of butter and 1/2 cup Equal spoonfuls and 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 cup sugar and used egg substitute and omitted the glaze. They ended up with only 45 calories apiece and 0 grams of fat! they were SOOOO GOOOD!!! :-)"
"1263","1","Brownies...  What comes to mind? Hard...chewy...  These brownies...  What comes to mind? Soft...cakelike...  These were baaaaad.......why must all these brownie recipes result in cake squares? I wish I could say different for this supposedly 'best brownie' recipe, but I can't. If you are looking for the traditional delicious brownie Grandma used to make, run, run away and never come back! These were just like a cake. Be aware: These are not the BEST brownies...these are the BEST cake squares."
"1047","5","These were the BEST BROWNIES even without the frosting. Just don't OVERBAKE/OVERMIX. When doubling, leave out one egg, keep the amount of salt at 1/4 tsp, and bake for 30-35 mins. You'll get a cakey on the outside, fudgey in the middle brownie. Delish!"
"772","5","Wonderful little brownie! Not too thick, not too thin, just right! Comes together and into the oven in less than 5 minutes. I added about 1 additional T. of cocoa. Just mix all ingredients with a wooden spoon in the same pan as you melted the butter, about 50 strokes, just until good and combined. The frosting is glossy and smooth if you melt the butter first and add about 1 T. each of corn syrup and half and half. Cutting these with a plastic knife, even the disposable tableware variety, works great! Cuts cleanly, and not a crumb sticks to the knife. Had to try 3 of the brownies as soon as they were cooled, just to be triply sure they were good."
"387","5","Worth a try, very easy recipe yielding above average brownies. When the recipe says not to overcook, don't...depending on your oven 25 minutes is probably long  enough. They may not look done, but they continue to cook/settle when removed. Also, I had to add an egg to the frosting recipe because I ended up with chocolate  sawdust without it (even using electric blender). Some folks also mentioned adding milk (1 Tblsp ?) because of this which would also work I'm sure."
"327","5","These are the BEST!!! I never made homemade brownies before and these came out PERFECT! They're fudgy and delicious, the icing is sooooo good too! I took the advice of one reviewer and heated the icing..it was perfect! I made them for a 4th of July picnic and they were a HUGE hit! They were gone in 15 minutes. Everyone loved them and asked me for the recipe! I doubled the recipe to fit a 9X13' pan. They were GREAT! Even if you're not a very good cook, these brownies will come out delicious! I recommend them to everyone! I'll never make brownies from a box again!"
"280","1","These were the worst brownies I have ever had! The frosting was way too sweet and did'nt go well with the brownies at all. My husband hated them, and wouldn't even finish them. He told me to throw them away. Sorry, hopefully you will like them better."
"254","4","Many moons ago I worked in a Duncan Hines test kitchen and have made up to 20 batches of brownies a day and let me say this is a good, easy recipe for homemade brownies; great chocolatey flavor.  I would suggest: 1) Slightly whip (with fork) the eggs to make them homogenous first before adding them to the pan's other ingredients. 2) Whisk your dry ingredients, flour, cocoa, salt and baking powder, together first before adding them to the pan. No need to beat with mixer. A wooden spoon to mix the batter until everything is wet works just fine. I used the frosting recipe which was very fudge-like and thick. I added just a smidgen of water to thin it out to make it at least somewhat spreadable."
"245","5","MMmmmm is all I can say. I just took my first bite. They taste more like fudge than brownies. The frosting is the key. At first the frosting was crumbly, but using a fork for 3 minutes made it come up to a nice creamy consistency. Also, frosting the brownies when they are warm made for a nice finish!"
"170","5","This recipe needs another review like I need another brownie - but I just couldn't stop eating them. Mama Cass hit the nail on the head saying this was neither a 'fudgy' brownie nor a 'cake-like' brownie, but both - that's what made it so awesome. I didn't have the honey for the frosting so frosted it with the best chocolate frosting IMO - boil 3TB butter, 1/3 c sugar, 2TB milk for a minute, remove from heat and add 1/3 c chocolate chips. Yummmm! Doubt anyone will read this after 1,000 some reviews, but just realized this recipe is similar to one a use for waffle cookies - only I melt the butter and cocoa powder in the microwave together and it mixes together much easier. Just a thought."
"164","5","I made these exactly as instructed, except I didn't bother with the frosting. I have no idea what some other reviewers are smoking, because, made as directed, these are the ideal brownie. Slightly fudgy and chewy, with that crackly top that seems to be the very definition of 'brownie.' The best part is they satisfy that craving for something rich and chocolatey while simultaneously being utterly convenient - you dirty a saucepan, an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 pan, a few measuring cups/spoons, and possibly a small mixing bowl if, like me, you decide to stir up the eggs/sugar/vanilla before adding to the butter. It's also the perfect recipe size as I wasn't looking for a giant pan of brownies, and it uses ingredients you probably have on hand. I don't keep baking chocolate around, but I always have cocoa! My suggestion is to just try the recipe as written, and no need to frost them."
"156","3","For those of you who complained that this brownie was too cakelike or too fudge like. If the brownies are too fluffy add more sugar(sugar can make it harder/chewier). For brownies that are less fudgey add another egg and use 1/4 less fat(butter etc). For those who want a fudgier brownie remove about 3 tablespoons of flour. Just know what kind of brownies you want before you make them as brownies are either fudge,chewy and crisp, or cakelike.This recipe is good for those who are really in the mood for a decadent chocolate fix but its not a basic brownie mix from a box so dont expect it."
"147","4","I really enjoyed these brownies. I was a little leary because of the frosting. I think my husband likes them but every time he eats one he complains that they are 'too fudgey.' As if there could be such a thing! A tip--wait until these are completely cooled before slicing. I didn't and I have some funky looking bronwies."
"70","5","OOOHHHH YUMMMY!!!!! I followed the recipe and changed the following : used 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/3, added 1/2 cup walnuts. I also skipped the frosting in an effort to cut back on the sugar. I added half cup of semi sweet chocolate to the mix. It was heavenly and totally satisfied my chocolate craving. Me and my husband had it polished off within 24 hours. Other variations? Add any of the following: 1/4 dried cherries, shot of raspberry flavoring, 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans or choc chips, 1/4 cranraisins, or 1/4 cup yogurt or white chocolate covered raisins."
"61","5","These are super. We don't bother with the frosting though, they don't need it. Many other reviewers say these are too cakey, that's not the fault of the recipe. Cakey-ness comes from how you make it. The trick with brownies is to mix the ingredients as little as possible, over mixing will result in a more fluffy, cake like brownie. My favorite thing about this recipe is there's only a pot and a wooden spoon to wash up when you're finished."
"54","5","***I was reading through reviews and noticed that some people had problems with the texture. I wanted to point out that if you use Dutch Process Cocoa or any baking cocoa that contains DP you'll have to check your baking powder. DP reacts different than regular coca and can create a really wierd texture and taste. I can't remember which way you go with the baking powder, but look it up. All cocoas are not interchangeable. Aside from that, I can't imagine why anyone would have any problems with this recipe! **Update-I regret finding this recipe! We make it a few times a week now, and they always come out perfect. The prep time is so minimal and an 8x8 pan disappears in minutes around here. Having brownies this good so often has to be unhealthy!** These came out great! We followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the icing. They really didn't need the frosting, just a great fudgy brownie. This recipe can be altered to suit anyone's tastes. I will try adding nuts later since my husband hates them. My three and four year olds helped me make these, we had a great time making these. This recipe was extremely easy to put together. Thanks!"
"53","4","For a truly fudgy brownie, don't use the cocoa powder, instead melt 3 ounces of unsweetened baking chocolate with the butter. And skip the baking powder altogether."
"43","5","These brownies were certainly rich and fudgy. My first three attempts did not come out all of that good in my oppinion but my children ABSOLUTELY LOVED them. I doubled the recipe and they came out like a runny fudge. This last time I didn't double the recipe but made it as the ingredients call for and baked them in a 9x9 inch pan. As for the frosting this final time I mixed in 3/4 cup of peanut butter in the frosting and heated it up on the stove. I think that I'll not buy any more boxed brownie mixes ever again after trying this recipe. The trick is not to expect a thick brownie. If you don't love chocolate don't try this recipe. My sons are requesting I only bake them for half of the time but I don't recommend it even though they'll come out like delectable fudge. You can't go wrong with this recipe and believe me I've made my mistakes with this recipe but my kiddoes ate all of those mistakes all up and loved every minute of it. JMO"
"40","5","I made this recipe twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly, and they were very good. The next night, I tried my own variations and they were even better! Here is what I did: 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/3, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, I added two squares of semi-sweet melted chocolate to the butter mixture, and omitted the baking soda. For the frosting, I melted the butter, and again I added a square of semi-sweet chocolate (melted), the honey, cocoa, and a splash of vanilla. I added the sugar and whipped with a hand mixer, to smooth it out a bit, I added a splash of milk in addition to more confectioners sugar. These were great!!!!"
"35","5","Delicious brownies! If you don't like chocolate or fudge then don't bother making it, otherwise you are in chocolate heaven!"
"33","5","they are great! but i twinked the recipe a lil to get some more fudgy brownies rather than cakey. to tell you the truth, i always used splenda and margarine for healthly...well healthier cooking/baking. i was convinced that there was something wrong, or this recipe just wasn't for me. but i tried one last time with butter and real sugar and they were to die for. then i started the tweaking. i did 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, makes it more chewy. then i increased cocoa powder from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup. took out the baking powder to make it less cakey. if you really like fudgy brownies then do not mix fast, mix slowly and make sure you dont overmix. i didn't grease the pan and it seems stupid but it reduces the chance it gets burnt. my cooking time for these brownies were 20 give or take a few. and when you poke it, it'll seem incredibly soft, but after cooling they'll be just right! and i forgot to add salt. i'm not a very experienced baker so i don't know what it does, and so i don't know if that was good or bad. but these definetely are satisfying for cravings, and i prefer these over ben n jerry's when i'm down. i dont think i need to say any more!"
"33","5","These are the best brownies!! I made some modifications after reading prevous reviews: I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and cut out 2 tbsp of the butter. I also added 1 cup of nuts and 1 cup of chocolate chips. This is now the only brownie recipe I will use. They are delicious!"
"30","5","I just made the brownie part, not the frosting. This made just enough to fit into my Perfect Brownie Pan. 350* for thirty minutes was just right. Perfectly fudgy and absolutely what a brownie should taste like. I didn't have the ingredients to make the frosting this time, but next time, I'll try these with the frosting and re-review."
"29","4","Very good brownies! To make them dense, I partially dissolved the sugar in the melted butter before I added the eggs and extract. I also ensured I used no more than the 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, since it is a leavening agent...I wonder what would happen if the powder was omitted? Anyway, I'm gonna make these again!"
"25","4","The brownies get a 5 star rating, but the frosting gets a 3. Way too sugary for my taste but the brownies were awesome! They deserve the 'best' brownie title."
"24","5","You can't beat these brownies - especially when you don't have chocolate on hand to melt. It is great to have a yummy recipe that uses cocoa and is so quick and easy to make. I don't ice mine, just sift some icing sugar over the top (if there's any left by the time I get back from the cupboard! Clare"
"23","5","These were sooo delicious! My family literally ate the whole pan in 5 minutes. Next time I will have to double the recipe so we can have some leftovers. (ha ha, they'll probably eat all those too!)"
"23","5","Super delicious and very easy recipe! I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for approximately 30 minutes. In place of the icing, I sprinkled 1/2 cup of chopped nuts and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the top of the brownies 10 minutes before they were done baking. (The salt in the nuts paired perfectly with the sweetness of the brownies.) Brownies turned out more fudge than cake-like. I received rave reviews from family and coworkers. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!"
"23","5","I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, and also doubled the frosting. I placed the frosting ingredients in a clean saucepan and turned the heat on VERY gently and presto - I immediately had a nice smooth icing which I was able to pour directly over the brownies and easily spread. I was then able to sprinkle decors over the top for a childrens's bday party. I did note that as the icing started to cool it became easy to make nice 'ridges and valleys' with the frosting (as opposed to the smooth glossy look it initally makes when it is warm and melted) - ergo you can use it to ice the brownies with a smooth look for decorating, or pour it on over the brownies and as it cools it becomes thicker so you can decorate with frosting swirleys!"
"22","5","Before I make a recipe, I always read the reviews. Sometimes I'll focus on the negative ones so I know what people don't like. I was very unsure after reading the negative reviews. Most said the same thing.. too cakey and I like my brownies kind of fudgy. After much debate I decided that I'd just have to make them for myself and see what happens. So I did. I made sure I stirred the batter just until it was all incorporated and watched the baking time. (I actually ended up under baking so I had to put them back in. Oopsie!) So the verdict ?.... FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed them. I love brownies and these were some of the best I've ever had! So my advice to you reading this wondering if this recipe is for you: don't over mix, watch your baking time (for me right around 20 min) and try it out for yourself. Only you are going to know if you like them or not, so what's the harm of making a batch and seeing what happens? Enjoy!"
"20","5","Best brownies ever! Why did it take me so long to find this."
"18","5","Delicious brownies. I did not use the icing at all and the brownies turned out GREAT! Since I love peanut butter and chocolate together I added a cup of creamy peanut butter. This made the brownies thicker and even more moist! Try it if you like peanut butter!"
"17","4","This recipe was great if you like frosted, cake-like brownies. I prefer unfrosted fudge brownies. To that end, I increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, only used ONE EGG, and added chocolate chips to the mix. If you like really chocolatey, chewy brownies, you might want to try these changes. Of course, as I said, I did not make the frosting. I am sure the frosting would go well on the original recipe, but it would make my brownies too sweet.  Okay, one day after writing the intial review, I accidentally used the white sugar in the recipe, and it indeed yielded a MUCH BETTER brownie, slightly crispy on top and a bit chewier."
"16","5","Made for my husband, he said they were really good, very chocolately and texture was just right. Need to have a glass of milk to make them perfect."
"16","5","These brownies were very good, Definately an inbetween, not cakey, not gooey, but very good."
"16","5","mmm, the best! this is the recipe (from the hershey's cocoa package) that i grew up with and it's ALWAYS a winner. (no frosting though.) i even sub applesauce for 100% of the butter to make them lower in calories and they're still fabulous. you can do lots of great stuff to them also -- add chocolate chips, frost them, add coffee or mint extract (or both!) they're great with variations OR plain! i often will 'underbake' them (20 minutes when using applesauce), so they're ULTRA GOOEY and fudgy and delish! (if you do that, you may have to cut them with a knife dipped in hot water to get clean cuts. store in the fridge and they stay great for over a week)"
"15","1","I tried this recipe, though skeptical of it. These came out as a couple of the others have said..., like CAKE. Crumbly, dry, bland. . They weren't gooey, not very chocolatey, just sweet cake-like squares. There are SO many more brownie recipes out there I have tried that will leave you much happier than these awful little brown squares of sadness!"
"15","5","I must admit, when I read the reviews that said replacing the 1/2 cup of butter with applesauce will still make an awesome brownie, I was really skeptical. Really skeptical. But I tried it and hey it tastes great!!! I don't miss the butter at all, these brownies are still moist and yummy and you can't taste the applesauce. (Also replace the white flour with whole wheat and I dare you to taste the difference!)  Just make sure to check them out in the oven after 20 minutes, less time if you want fudgier undone brownies, a little longer if you want more cake like brownies. This recipe is a keeper!"
"15","5","As a chocoholic (who is also married to a chocoholic), this brownie recipe is the greatest find! ALL the ingredients are ones that you can keep on hand all the time, and so they can be whipped up right after dinner! I have also prepared the batter as dinner is cooking, and then put them in the oven just as dinner is ready. Warm brownies for dessert! They are so fudgy with satiny tops...just the way a good brownie should be! I even made them once without vanilla because I had run out, and they were still delicious. I always keep on hand the baking spray that has flour in it so that I can prepare these in a flash! I mix the batter up in the saucepan that I melt the butter in, and then it's the only thing to clean! The name says it....the best!"
"15","5","These are the best brownies that I have ever tasted! I ran into one problem when making the frosting. It was very dry, and I couldn't figure out how to make it creamy. I added a tablespoon of milk, and the frosting turned out fine."
"15","5","My family will do anything if I make these brownies. I like to sprinkle powdered coffee flavors on top of the batter before I bake them. Raspberry and mint have been the favorites so far."
"15","5","I can make very complicated desserts -- except brownies. My failure rate for brownies have made me doubt my baking abilities. However, this recipe turned out EXTREMELY well and everyone loved them. This is now my standard!"
"15","5","I couldn't wait to make these, but the wait paid off! They were so easy to make that anybody could do it! Delicious, too."
"15","5","These brownies are great when you need a quick dessert idea!! Very easy to make and taste scrumptious!!"
"13","4","Very Good! They really tasted better the next day."
"12","5","DELICIOUS!! I use only real butter and Hershey brand cocoa when baking as it's the best combo! Mixed batter by hand; careful to not over mix. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x12 pan coated with butter. One reviewer used only 3 eggs, but I used all four. For the icing, I doubled as written and added 2-3 tablespoons of warmed milk to get to the desired consistency. The icing was very fudgey and perfect on top of brownies right out of the oven."
"12","5","The people who gave this bad reviews must have messed up somehow in the making. These are excellent. I did double the recipe for a 9x13 pan, and it wasn't enough batter; next time I will triple it, using 4 eggs and bake for 30 min. I did not use the frosting for these - I can't judge a frosted brownie, and if the recipe has to have it, I won't make it cause it's not a good brownie. Using one egg less in the original recipe will make it more like a fudge brownie, and less like cake. You can also experiment with replacing some of the butter with oil, that should help also. You can also try adding some Hershey's Syrup and/or mini chocolate chips to make it more like a boxed mix. As for this not being a box recipe-no it's not. You know exactly what's in it and can pronounce it all. It IS an incredibly soft, perfectly sweet, 1/2 fudge-1/2 cake brownie that is the only brownie I will make again."
"12","5","These brownies live up to their title. My mom said they wre the best homemade brownies she ever had!! They are fudgy and yummy. I put them (still in the pan) in the fridge over night to harden up a bit so I could serve them without them falling apart. I also used less salt then the recipe called for, I used 1/8 teaspoon instead. Otherwise they have an after taste. I didn't frost them because they tasted so great plain. I also melted the butter in the microwave instead of the stove because it was faster. I set the microwave on high and put it on 15 seconds and then stirred until all the butter was melted."
"12","1","I have used several brownie recipes from this site – all with good to excellent success, and when I saw 1000+ ratings and so many good reviews, I had to give them a try. Unfortunately, these were a bust – result reminded me of the cakes you’d get out of the Easy Bake oven as a kid. Followed the recipe to a T, except for substituting Splenda for the sugar (I have done this with every other baking recipe I’ve used for the past year and never had a problem). The problems as I see them: 1) The batter is too thick – more like a stiff muffin batter, and barely covered the bottom of my 8x8 pan. Brownie batter should not be thin, but in my experience, should pour smoothly with few to no lumps. 2) As a result of #1, brownies way too dry. 3) Perhaps a heresy, but too much butter – when baking, the butter bubbled to the top and just sat there, making a greasy texture on the outside, but not lending moisture inside. 4) As others have suggested, not enough baking powder; as such, these were flat, did not rise, and the texture was much too dense and heavy for my taste. Am glad so many others have found success with this recipe, but I will not be trying it again with so many other good ones out there."
"11","5","Whoever says these are cakey is a n00b. :> That's not the fault of the recipe, that's the fault of overmixing! Use a spoon and hand mix until blended, don't beat the whole mixture (though do do that lightly to the eggs). This rule also applies to cookies if you want to keep them chewy. Only overmix for cakes! These brownies turned out so yummy, chewy, and delicious. I didn't make them with frosting though, I don't like frosted brownies! I had to bake them in a 10x14 with a doubled recipe; they were thin but still sooo good (also took 5 minutes less, 20 min) They brought on my very favorite part of cooking-- when all is done and your recipient takes that first bite, pauses, and widens his eyes in YUMYUM JOY. Or at least that's what my good friend (birthday boy) did, haha :) it made me very happy to see that he enjoyed what I made! I love this recipe. EDIT: I'm not kidding when I say this is possibly one of the best recipes I have ever tried :D I got rave reviews~"
"11","5","So Awesome!!!! I did not frost them, they did'nt need it at all. My hubby loved them! I only added some chopped walnuts and a few semi sweet chocolate chips. SOOOOOOO YUMMY!!!!"
"11","5","let me start out by saying, i have never been a fan of brownies but... i needed a sweet fix and had the ingredients so i tried it. i loved them! i made them after dinner, ate until i felt sick. made another batch the next morning by 8am! the recipe was so simple i didn't even need to sign back on to remember the measurements. i didn't use the topping though, for me this was sweet enough, just gave it a dusting of confectioners sugar. the perfect brownie to go with ice cream."
"11","5","These really are the best brownies. I added half a cup of chocolate chips and my friends couldn't stop eating them."
"10","4","I used this recipe as a basis for my own recipe and it helped result in amazing brownies. I made quite a few alterations though, based on my preferences. I wanted to use my 9x13 brownie pan, so I had to increase the batter. INGREDIENT CHANGES: I used 1 cup of melted butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup of brown sugar, 3 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla, 1 cup cocoa powder, 1 cup flour, and 1/2 tsp salt. IMPORTANT: If you want a more dense and fudgy brownie, OMIT THE BAKING POWDER. Also, as others have said, do not over mix. Just blend to incorporate the ingredients. DIRECTION CHANGES: Melted the butter in the microwave and let cool slightly. I beat the eggs into the butter and added the vanilla. In a separate, large bowl - I added all the dry ingredients and whisked them to break up any lumps, especially in the brown sugar. Then, I mixed the dry with the wet with a wooden spoon. I spread it in my pan (lined with parchment) and baked for exactly 25 minutes. Yum! I did not make the frosting, so I can't comment on that."
"10","5","My men were the ones rating this recipe, and they wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars. I decided to err on the side of how easy this was to make. Thank you, Angie, for this recipe."
"10","5","I used Hersey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder and these brownies were exceptional!"
"10","5","Wow! A wonderful fudgy moist brownie! I just made this for my husband's coworkers, which is all men. I made a double batch with a 9x12 casserole dish. I followed directions as stated in the recipe but I just doubled it and did the following: I lined my pan with wax paper and lightly sprayed it with Pam. I did use the 1/4 tsp baking powder for the double batch but would use it without on a single. I added  1 1/2 cups pecans (would use 1 cups for single batch) and I added 1/2 cup milk choc. chips to my double batch. I checked my brownies at 25 mins of cooking but was still 'jiggly' in the center. My total time for cooking was 33 mins, I used the tooth pick method which almost came out clean but I didn't want to over cook them. I could tell the batter was cooked, just moist. I then let my brownies rest for 5 mins and I then lifted them out of the pan and placed on the side to cool. I try the icing on half the brownies to try but I would not use the icing. There's no need for it because the brownies are fine like they are and made it to rich tasting. Using a long sharp knife I cut mine into 1' squares which made a good 48 plus brownies. So this is a keeper and I've added to my recipe binder. YUM!"
"10","5","These are great brownies, but I found that adding a couple tablespoons of milk really helps the frosting. Thanks for the recipe!"
"10","1","Sorry, these brownies were too cakelike for me. My fiance loves brownies and I thought I'd surprise him with these,  but they just didn't turn out the way I expected with all of the other reviews on them."
"10","5","I have been using this same recipe for almost 10 years and it NEVER fails. They are such a treat, and they are even better the next day!"
"9","5","These were really good! Not quite the brownie texture I was looking for but very good. I think if I had cooked them any longer they would have been more of a cake type texture. I thought the icing was de~lish!!!!!!!!!"
"9","5","WONDERFUL! I got multiple 'these are the BEST brownies Ive ever had.' I made three changes, reduce 1 cup sugar to 2/3 cup sugar, I think american desserts are usually too sweet. I cut the sugar in half for the frosting as others tipped. And I replaced 2 tbs. of the butter with 3 tbs. of apple sauce. Apple sauce is the secret to moist baked goods (good for pancakes and cupcakes too!)."
"9","5","Ok, I really suck! I'm not even going to rate this recipe because I mucked it up so bad. I just want to tell all those half-people like me to not do what I did and use regular cocoa powder instead of unsweetened and used regular sugar instead of confectiner's sugar. It came out all bad!!!"
"9","4","Very moist. Not enough chocolate for me."
"9","5","Very yummy! The brownies themselves are rich so it's OK to omit the icing."
"9","5","These are really the best brownies by far, rich and moist. Must have a class of milk when you eat these goodies!"
"8","5","I made these exactly as written (except I used a mini muffin pan and baked for 15 min) and I got some awesome brownies! Mine came out crunchy on the outside and slightly chewy in the middle. Topped them with a cream cheese frosting, a strawberry, and a lil blob of frosting on top to make Christmas-y Santa hats. :)"
"8","5","Holy wow are these good. I only got to taste the edges (I made the batch to give to someone else, made straight edges so that I could taste a little!) and they were completely perfect. Nice and chocolatey, the right amount of sweetness, very chewy. I tasted the frosting as well when mixing it up and it's pretty good too, I didn't find it overly sweet like others said. Personally I prefer my brownies unfrosted though so the frosting wasn't the wow factor for me. I've been a diehard lover of Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies recipe for a couple of years now, but I don't know, this recipe here may have converted me! Either way I will definitely be making another batch of this one to keep for myself this time! A couple of things that might be helpful: 1) I melted the butter in the microwave (totally melted, not softened) - no need to dirty a saucepan. 2) I did it all by hand - I have no scientific knowledge to back this up, but brownies seem to turn out less cakey when done by hand. 3) If doubling the recipe, DON'T leave the fourth egg out (as suggested by someone else). The eggs help make it nice and chewy."
"8","5","I have made these twice in less than a week. The first time, dh took them to a work function and I didn't get to taste them. His coworkers gave rave reviews, so I made them for the fam tonight. I am surprised at how rich and chocolatey they are--other brownie recipes I've tried that use cocoa powder rather than baking chocolate aren't this fudgey. I had to add 1-2 TBS of half and half to the frosting both times to get it to a spreadable consistency. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Things I especially love about this recipe: SO simple and easy, I always have the ingredients on hand, it only makes an 8X8 pan (so we don't go overboard) but is easily doubled, and the easy frosting makes them extra special. Not being a honey lover, I was a little hesitant about adding it, but I can't taste it. If you haven't given these a try, go do it now! :-) Thank you, Angie!"
"8","5","Insanly fantastic!!!  I have never had any luck with homemade brownies but no more box mixes for me! Whatever you do, DO NOT USE A MIXER! mix the batter with a spoon and as little as possible. This will make sure you get fudgy, not cakey, brownies. I did ad a half a box of instant pudding to be sure they we super moist. I normally don't do that frosting thing, but I decided to on this one and it was the right decision!"
"8","1","I didn't care for this recipe at all. The brownies baked just fine and the texture was fine, it just did not taste good. I followed the receipe exactly, using fresh ingredients. They just had a funny taste and after taste, not a good balance of chocolate."
"8","5","This is truly an AWESOME brownie recipe-plus it is so easy and quick. You will definitely want to double the recipe-the first time I made it in the 8x8 pan and they were gone before evening. Also, to make things easier, I line my 9x13 with one sheet of wax paper. Take a standard (11.9 inches wide) roll of wax paper and tear it so that when you place it in the pan there is about 3 inches of extra wax paper hanging over on each long side of the 9x 13. When the brownies cool, just loosen the brownie from the short sides of the pan and using the extra wax paper on each side as 'handles' lift out the entire brownie. It sounds complicated but it makes cutting the brownies a cinch!"
"8","5","These brownies are awsome! They are so simple to make too. My whole family loves them. What I do though when I make them is that I double the recipe and put all of it in a 9 inch square pan. They take a little longer to bake but they are nice and high and fudgy. They turn out much better than the reg. recipe. And I use no icing, it makes them way too sweet and it ruins them lol. Also I use no nuts. Thanks!"
"8","5","Very tasty! For Halloween, I added mini marshmallows (as ghosts) & graham cracker sticks (as tombstones) on top of the frosting for a nice little Halloween smores treat, all the children loved it! Thanks Angie!"
"8","5","This is the most delicious and fail-proof brownie recipe I have tried. The first time I tried it, I had to make two batches within hours as they disappeared so fast. The brownies are really moist and chocolatey, and the recipe is quick, easy and no-fuss – all ingredients are mixed in a single bowl. A definite family favourite."
"7","5","DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe because I don't like to have too many sweets at home and I baked them in a mini muffin pan for 14 minutes -- PERFECT!!"
"7","5","TO SKEPTICS: Those that gave this a one star and said they were cake-like are wrong, they over-cooked their brownies and that is why they were cake-like. I followed the recipe and after about 15-20mins I check my brownies and they were done. Tip: Only cook brownies until they are just done, if you cook them too long they will turn out cake-like and this goes for store bought brownies as well; plus each person's oven is different (my old oven would have taken 30+ mins; so know your oven and adjust the time accordingly). Also, make sure to heat the butter in a pan (the hot pan and hot butter will make the batter smoother and help to make the brownies more fudge like). If you follow these tips your brownies won't be cake-like.   As for the frosting: it is very hard to spread so melt the butter and heat the frosting so it starts melting a little and is easier to spread. I didn't do this and I couldn't get it to spread so I had to improvise. I flattened my frosting by hand and then laid it, in pieces, on the still warm brownies. It started to melt and I took a butter knife and gently started to spread the frosting and it worked nicely.  For those that say they are not chocolaty enough, they must not have made them right. Plus cocoa is a little bitter, and if you aren't use to it you may not like it (I know I use to hate the taste of homemade brownies, but now I love them).  Overall, if done right and not over cooked these brownies turn out just as the recipe says."
"7","3","WAY too sweet.. my 15 year old daughter made these and all you get when you bite into is sugar rush! We love sweet things but these were too much.. they were better the next day but just not a great brownie. We are still on the hunt for the BEST brownie!"
"7","4","Great tasting recipe. I certainly would not go back to boxed brownies. To avoid getting dry brownies try under-baking a bit. FOR MOIST, CHEWY BROWNIES IN A 9X13: double everything except for the eggs (only use 2 or 3). Omit the baking soda all together. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes. I used 3/4 c. cocoa (when doubling the recipe), for a richer chocolate taste, but not necessary. The key to making fudgey brownie that is not dry or cake-like is to not over bake the brownie and definitely omit the baking powder. Great recipe! Thanks. UPDATE: don't use a mixer! Beat everything by hand or you will overbeat the mixture and get a more cakey result. These brownies are not suppose to taste like a box mix - but are wonderful and better than the box!"
"7","5","AWESOME! Not over dense like some brownies are. My friend came over and gobbled up half of them. I think it would be good to double the frosting."
"7","4","I made this recipe 'as is' and although quite good (we ate the whole pan in about an hour), it was missing the rich chocolate flavour that I like in a brownie. The second time I made them I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white instead of 1 cup white and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. These were so rich & chocolately I just sprinkled with icing sugar instead of frosting."
"6","5","Loved this recipe! I do a lot of baking, but the perfect brownie recipe has always eluded me. Well, not anymore. I followed a few handy tips from other reviewers (1) avoiding using the cake mixer and made these by stirring them by hand (2) lightly beating the eggs separately before incorporating it into the batter (3) reducing the sugar to about 3/4 cup (4) not sifting the dry ingredients (5) not overcooking, and always keeping a watchful eye on them. Next time, I'd like to substitute the butter with 1/2 cup applesauce (to cut down the calories). I made these in a 9x9 square tin, but they weren't thin or cake ... the only difference was that I reduced the baking time to 15 mins (max). Thanks for sharing this recipe Angie! :)"
"6","4","These are great for a quick and satisfying chocolate fix."
"6","5","These truly are the Best Brownies! I have made them more times than I can count! So Easy and So Delicious!! Do not over bake and stir until just blended...Perfect everytime...I put the frosting on while they are still hot...Sometimes add a little milk to frosting if it's really thick...My grandson loves to help make them and add the sprinkles! You must keep this one on file!!"
"6","5","I love to cook but haven't done a lot of baking. I decided to tackle these brownies one night, and they really are great. Unfortunately I didn't have much vanilla extract so did without the topping - unfortunately this creates a thin brownie that is very hard to handle! I think next time I will double the recipe for a thicker brownie and then add the topping."
"6","4","I made these brownies yesterday, they were really good, moist and fudgy. What i had an issue with was the frosting, I have an excellent for chocolate mocha frosting but I thought i would try the one that was with the recipe It was laughable because there had to be a mistake in the ingredients because you could shake it on it was dry as the desert and i went right by the recipe to a tee, it was missing some moisture so i had to modify it so it could be spread on instead of shaking it on, other than the frosting it was a great recipe."
"6","5","I am so pleased with this recipe. And the gross pic with the sprinkles on the brownie does not do them justice. I've made the recipe three times, just as it's written (except the frosting. I don't like frosted brownies), and they are wonderful. Buttery, with a pleasant saltiness, and absolutely perfect. One friend said they taste like brownie mix brownies. I think they're better because there's no chemical aftertaste. My mom and I had a tried and true one-bowl brownie recipe, and this is better. I make it all in the saucepan I melt the butter in, and yup. Good.   UPDATE: Made the frosting because my dad likes frosted brownies, and yuck. People have complained that it's 'too sweet' and it because of the honey, which I would just omit all together. Just no good in a frosting. Also, with the ingredients as stated, this never came together and was powdery and crumbly. Is that right? I added a little milk so that it was usable and we'll see. Hopefully it doesn't ruin the brownies."
"6","3","I can't say that these aren't good, they just weren't what I consider the 'best brownie'. They have much more of a cake-like consistency, so if that's what you look for in a brownie, then these are great. If you're like me, and like a fudgey gooey brownie, then Brooke's bombshell brownies are the way to go."
"6","5","These were perfect. An earlier reviewer mentioned they were a cross between a cake and brownies and that description is very accurate, which is what I liked. I didn't overmix or overcook (exactly 25 minutes) and spread the frosting on top while still warm. Fabulous. However, I did have to add a 2-3 tsps of milk to the frosting to improve the consistency."
"6","5","I have stopped buying mix and have made these several times. I double everything in the recipe except the eggs(I only use 3)and bake in a 9x13 pan for 25 min. These are perfect."
"6","3","i never thought i'd say this but if these are the best brownies then i much prefer boxed Ghiradelli brownies and i'm someone that hates pre-made food including the frozen so called 'fresh' dishes are popular in chain restaurants. also PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT follow the review to use apple sauce, egg substitute and equal in this brownie to make it more 'healthy'. i tried that suggestion 2x and both times the brownies did NOT rise and came out as a flat piece of rubber. apple sauce, egg substitute and equal are what anorexic girls use in their recipes to alleviate their guilt during their binges."
"6","5","Definitely some of the best brownies I've had. I'm curious to know how others are coming up with dry, cakey brownies, as mine were quite fudgy and moist. (I can only assume those with cakey results overbaked and/or used an electric mixer. Always mix brownies by hand.) With the exception of omitting the icing (I felt they'd be too rich with it), and substituting butter for margarine, I followed the recipe exactly and had great results."
"6","5","As suggested before, I use a bit more cocoa powder (1/4 cup) for this recipe. You also don't need the frosting. Instead I sprinkle walnuts and chocolate chips on top and bake for 20 minutes. Great recipe!"
"6","5","wonderful. I got so many compliments on this recipe. Made them twice so far. If you taste a weird flavor, it's most likely the honey in the icing. substitute milk and it will work out better."
"6","2","Completely mediocre 'brownies'. Brownies should be chewy, fudgey, and moist. Dare I say even boxed mixes are better than this? These are more of a cake. I give them a two since they do have a good chocolately taste. Yes i did follow the instructions exactly. No, I did not make the frosting. Also this recipe is an exact ripoff of the Best Brownies on hersheykitchens.com, and also used to be on the can of Hershey's cocoa powder."
"6","5","These brownies turned out horrible. They were bitter and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
"6","5","These are excellent, moist brownies that aren't overly sweet. Don't bother with a single recipe...double the batch and put it in a 9 X 13' pan. We found them even better the next day!"
"6","1","Can't figure out what I did wrong. I followed the instructions exactly and double checked the ingredient amounts but ended up with a collapsed mess. My batter was thin enough to pour into the pan - there was no need to spread it around at all. After 25 minutes an inserted toothpick came out clean, but the brownie itself looked wet and glistening on the inside. How in the world did half the reviewers get a cake-like consistency? This is the first time I tried a cocoa brownie versus the melted baking chocolate type - what a disappointment. I guess I'll have to go back to the tried-and-true."
"6","1","These were no good. Not how my family likes brownies at all. They were dry and blah. The frosting was good. I followed the directions to the letter and they were not good at all."
"6","1","My chocoholic teen daughter said to stick to the packaged mixes...sorry."
"6","4","We are a busy family and try to enjoy as much together time as possible. These brownies allowed for that, quick and easy. The kids loved to help. The flavor was really good but not over powering with chocolate. The texture was light. I messed up on the frosting, but it recovered nicely once the brownies had cooled and set-up.We tried them warm and cooled and all preferred them cooled! Will make again! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"6","5","this is the second time I'm making the brownies and they are still so excellent. It is idiot proof and I will recommend it to anybody for the ease and convenience of this recipe. I always double the recipe.. otherwise its just not enough. I've tried it two ways, once with butter (came out fudgey) and the other with 1/2 prune puree (8 ounces pitted prumes + 6 tbsp hot water in food processor) + 1/2 butter and it had a dense cake like consistency. either way it was THE BEST!!!"
"6","5","These are the best brownies I have ever made. I have made them at least 15 times in the past couple of months and everyone loves them. They are consistently chewy and moist except the time I used margarine and overbaked them, they were a bit cake-like, but the next day, they were perfect. For best results, use butter, like the recipe calls for. I have tried sunflower and vegetable oil and they are just as good as when I used butter. Also, I have never used the frosting recipe. I have tried them plain, with chocolate chunks and/or pecans, with a mixture of white and dark chocolate chunks, with milk chocolate chunks, and with swirling peanut butter on top before baking, all with perfect results each time. I have given the recipe to several friends and they all have the same result--moist, chewy brownies. One of my friends even added peanut butter chips...YUM! Thanks for the great recipe! I am never using a box mix again!"
"5","5","These brownies are edible heaven. Ever since I found this recipe I use it ALL the time! Rainy days, snowy days, Christmas, Thanksgiving... The whole family LOVES it!! My grandma asked for the recipe. When a grandma asks for a recipe you KNOW it's good! We all love it SO much. It's super easy! You literally mix everything together, bake it, and then you're done. How much easier can it get? And I insist you make the frosting. It's just melt-in-your-mouth good. I pinky swear. 500,000,000 stars."
"5","5","Very good and easy. Made without the frosting. Will make again because I always have these ingredients on hand. Next time I will double the recipe."
"5","4","I've been making these brownies for 12 years and have never had them come out cake-like. If you want a denser texture then don't use an electric mixer at any stage (and only stir in the dry ingredients until they're just wet). Make sure the melted butter is cooled before adding the eggs, too. I whisk the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl and add that mixture to the mixed wet ingredients. If you *want* a lighter-textured brownie, use the electric mixer and don't melt the butter--just have it softened.   Unless you need so much sugar in a brownie that your teeth hurt, you can skip the frosting and just add 1/2 cup nuts or chocolate chips. I've never used the frosting (I add chopped pecans or walnuts) and still find them to be a bit too sweet. I think 3/4 cup is plenty (maybe b/c I use organic unrefined sugar).   I grease my 8x8 glass pan and line it with unbleached parchment paper to make it easier to get the brownies out. For denseness, I slightly underbake them (toothpick still a bit wet). After 15 minutes out of the oven, I lift the brownies out of the pan using the liner as handles and leave them to cool completely on a rack. Then I flip the whole thing over onto a large cutting board and peel the paper off. I cut from the bottom, just as it lays, which prevents the top from cracking and caving in when I cut. Using a chef's knife, I start with a center cut to make 2 equal sections and then cut the two halves in half lengthwise and repeat on the adjacent side."
"5","5","Wheatless version alert: These turned out very good. I substituted 1/4 cup of soy flour and 1/4 cup of Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free flour. The one who resists dessert and anything gluten free went for seconds. ;-)"
"5","4","Kind of bummed with this recipe. The picture was so beautiful, but my brownies didn't turn out anything like it. The actual brownie was fantastic, but the frosting isn't good at all. And, I couldn't get it to spread at.all - even though I put it on while they were still warm. Makes me wonder if people used a different frosting recipe."
"5","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing. They are not too sweet and definitely not too cakey, just perfect. I did not use an electric mixer, just mixed by hand until all the flower lumps were gone. Big hit at work."
"5","4","Pretty good...was out of brownie mix...very fudgy, and moist! Definately will make again."
"5","5","This recipe is extremely easy and fast to make. The brownies melt in your mouth and are very soft. I've been baking this recipe for 4 years now and have never had a flop. I have never made the frosting recipe attached because the brownies are so good that I never though anything else was needed other than the occasional scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"5","5","Yummy! I absolutely LOVE these brownies. They were so moist and cake-like. I used Callebaut cocoa powder and added milk chocolate chips. I didn't even need the frosting! Thanks for a great recipe."
"5","5","searched high and low for the perfect brownie recipe. and im pretty sure i found it. for me the icing was so stiff and hard to cover the brownies with. might play around with it to see what i come up with. i might also bake them a little bit longer to see if i can get them to firm up a little bit more. taste was spot on. the icing wasnt too sweet and didnt over power the brownie. this is a home run and ill be making these again and again! P.S. the first time i made them i doubled and baked them in a 9x13 baked for 25 minutes and they were done. tooth pick came out clean."
"5","5","The icing is phenomenal. Apparently, the oven in our new house bakes at nearly 500 degrees when set to 350, so my brownies did not turn out. :( BUT, the frosting was delicious and satisfied my sweet tooth anyway. :) I refrigerated the frosting since the brownie bricks wouldn't be needing it, and when cold, it was almost like eating a really great fudge."
"5","4","These were pretty good. I was glad that the recipe didn't use any oil. I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan. I topped them with the Irish cream frosting from the 'Irish Cream Brownies' recipe on this site (it was for a St. Patrick's Day potluck), which complemented the brownies really well.  The only changes I made to the recipe are as follows: 1) I used half the sugar called for and 2) I omitted the salt.  If you don't frost the brownies, they probably need about 2/3-3/4 of the sugar called for. But if you do frost the brownies, the frosting lends enough sweetness to halve the sugar.  My brownies turned out somewhere between cakey and fudgey, but a bit closer to cakey. I'm going to try taking them out of the oven a bit earlier next time. I was also taking them to a potluck, so I had to leave them in the glass dish in which I baked them, which I'm sure didn't help.  I do, however, really like the flavor. It tastes like chocolate, but it's not too sweet. I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder and that seemed to work fine.  I got tons of compliments on the brownies, so obviously something worked well, although I do think that the frosting was clutch. Not having tried the frosting listed in this recipe, I can't provide much feedback there."
"5","1","If there were 0 stars would give it. Need 1 T. milk in frosting. Brownie not sweet. Frosting too sweet and just plain STRANGE- destroy this recipe!"
"5","5","Thank you! Tastes like the boxed brownies! They turned out a little bit cakey for me but still delish!!"
"5","5","I followed the recipe (for the brownie) exactly and they turned out perfect. I pulled them out of the oven at 25 minutes. I did change the frosting by putting coffee in the mix (a condensed version of instant) in place of the vanilla and it too was delicious."
"5","1","I made this recipe to a T and went bad and reread the recipe and I am sure that it was done correctly. Made these for a super bowl party and only the toddlers ate more than a bite. The butter was the main flavor, the grease from the buter was overwhelming, and the consistancy of them was unlike any brownie I have ever had-cakelike or chewy. Not the 'best brownies' in my book. This would be to date the only recipe I have rated this low."
"5","3","Brownie was ok but the frosting on top was way to sweet. The brownie can stand on its own."
"5","5","Never made brownies from scratch before, will never buy box mix again! These were GREAT and easy. Added some chocolate chips to batter and no frosting. Husband was CRAZY about them. Yumo"
"5","4","These are pretty darn good. I did have to add a bit of milk to the frosting, but otherwise I made it per the recipe. They will come out chewy if you fold the dry ingredients (by hand) into the butter/sugar mixture. If you beat it with a mixer, it will turn out cakey."
"5","5","The key to getting chewy and not 'cakey' brownies is to NOT use a mixer. I used a silicone spatula to mash and mix. Over mixing the batter will result in the chewy. These were great and I didn't make the frosting. I also topped the batter with a sprinkle of chocolate chips before placing it in the oven."
"5","5","Great recipe as written for fairly chewy brownies. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. Served w ice cream and choc sauce..yum"
"5","1","I wanted to make these for a party and since they got such great reviews I thought these would be really good. I was dissapointed. They were not soft and chewy at all and not choclatey tasting at all. You know they aren't good when an 8 year old tells her mommy she doesn't like the brownies! The plate was still full at the end of the party. I won't make these again."
"5","5","These are the world best brownies eve However i did double it,I add about a handful of chocolate chip morsels I also add a candy bar to this recipe, and 1 tsp of vanilla butter nt extract.I love these they where so chocolate chocolate.Thanks Angie"
"5","5","I made these brownies about 2 times and two weeks the 1st time they where not chocolate enough for me so the second time i made them i did add another tsp of cocoa powder.And i put about 1 tsppo cocoa powder in the mix and that made it just right for me .and i did add another tsp of vanilla extract.And about 1/2 cup off pecan.Thanks these where easy brownies to make and i didn't make the glazes you really don't need it"
"5","5","This is the best brownies that I've tried ever. Everybody still raving about it. Last week I tried brownies from another recipe but they still prefer this one."
"5","4","Very good recipe. I tripled the recipe and used 1t. of BP cuase I like them a little more cake like. Baked them in muffin tins for 2 bite brownies and reduced baking time by about 3 min. A little too sweet but that could be adjusted. I would also use a little more cocoa for a deeper chocolate flavor."
"5","1","I personally found these to be the 'worst brownies' I have made. The texture of the brownie was 'gloppy' and the texture of the icing was very thick and not very spreadable. I would not make again."
"5","4","These weren't exactly THEE best brownies. I expected a little better. I guess its the frosting that makes them good. They were easy to make though."
"5","5","Totally awesome! We loved these! They are the very best brownie I have ever made. My search is over for the best brownie:)"
"5","5","This is just like Hershey's best brownie recipe. I know I like them ;)"
"5","1","I thought these were horrible. They were more like cake and not a very good one at that."
"5","1","Wow, you'd think after over 900 people have tried it that this recipe has got to work. Wrong! How disappointing :( I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the ingredients and it came out dry and awful. I will never try this recipe again unless I feel like modifying it. Horrible."
"5","5","This is a very good brownie. I followed other recommendations and made with 1/2 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I made it two ways, once with the baking powder for more cake-like brownies, and without the baking powder for more fudge-like brownies. I did not use the frosting recipe. This recipe will be well used."
"5","1","This was not a brownie..Too light and fluffy for which I would consider a brownie to be..The frosting was horrible.The honey had a lot to do with the taste..(more on the lines of cheap chocolate)Sorry if this seems a little rough,but I didn't like these at all nor did anyone else. Also the recipe was followed as directed..Thank you"
"5","5","Yummy! I love fudgy brownies, so I only used one egg and added chocolate chips. I used a little more cocoa than was called for, and a little less sugar. I put them into an 8 x 8' pan, and they turned out beautifully! I frosted them with peanut butter frosting.. My husband can't stop eating them! I will definitely make them again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"5","2","These brownies were just ok. They turned out pretty flat. I modified it by using 1/2 cup cocoa and did not frost. I made them at 2 p.m. and ate them at midnight. They were already starting to taste old. I am a pretty experienced baker, and was disappointed in these. I will try some other recipes."
"5","5","Absolutely one of the best recipes I've tried for brownies!! Moist, gooey, chocolaty (spelling?), etc., etc; plus very, very easy to prepare! This will be a mainstay in my recipe book. (For those of you that have a problem cutting brownies, use a plastic knife; they come out perfect!) Thanks for sharing with us!"
"5","5","One of these days I'll learn to first try the original recipe before I take advice of readers' modifications. I took the advice of some readers and added chocolate chips, but I did not like the result as well as I did when I made the recipe as submitted. This was my niece's birthday 'cake' and she loved it. The brownie is very rich and dense, not 'cakey' at all. I keep forgetting to add nuts, but looking forward to trying it with nuts. This is the type of brownie I love."
"5","3","my husband said these were ok. perhaps it was the honey taste in teh icing that made us not care for them as much as traditional brownies it gives a very distinct flavor"
"5","2","I certainly don't know what the hoopla is all about. These weren't exactly 'brownies.' They weren't terrible, but I was looking for a brownie recipe, which this is not. My husband thought the whole brownie was too sweet and he couldn't finish a small piece. The icing was grainy. I was disappointed with how thin it was too. I'm continuing my search for a brownie recipe as I won't be making this again."
"5","5","My first thought was that these brownies were too simple to be good. My mistake. They are great! The frosting is very good and the browines are tender and delicious. They are all gone and I baked them this morning. Maybe you should rename them disappearing brownies."
"5","5","Excellent. This is the first brownie recipe I tried. I added 1/2cup crushed walnuts & 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the original recipe and reduced amount of sugar. We served them warm with Vanilla ice cream at a dinner gathering and our friends just loved it."
"5","5","VERY CHOCOLATIE! Turned out great!"
"5","5","These brownies were to die for. Do NOT use too much butter (or use un-salted) when you grease the pan; My last batch was a bit salty because of it. That did not stop my hubbie from eating them!"
"5","5","These brownies are awesome! I'm studying abroad in New Zealand at the moment and I fixed them for my five kiwi flat-mates. They don't have brownies over here and all of them absolutely loved them. The recipe is very basic but the brownies are not. I highly recommend them."
"5","1","These were horrible and the frosting was way too think. I will not make these again."
"5","5","These brownies are so yummy! And it's great that it's a one pot batter clean up. My husband was hesitant to give up his Betty Crocker box brownies, but has taken quite a liking to these - he asks for them every day!"
"5","5","really are the best ever. i added 4 squares of leftover chopped chocolate chunks. used maple syrup instead of honey for frosting. great!!"
"4","2","After reading the reviews, I couldn't help but make this. I followed the recipe word for word, did not use a mixer and hand mixed these to avoid over mixing as some of the reviewers stated, to avoid these from turning into cake squares. I used an 8x8in pan and after following the recipe down to a T and following the recomendation, these ended up being cake squares, and lowsy ones at that. The batter tasted great but these are in no way brownies. I was aware that these weren't supposed to be fudgey, nor Cakey, but there is no in between. This turned out to be a cake. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a normal brownie despite all of the wondeful reviews, just try the recipe and see for yourself! Maybe use a bigger pan so that they turn out flatter and brownie-like. That's the only advice I can give on these to hope they'd even resemble a brownie."
"4","4","Good brownies. In a perfect world, the recipe should give options for those who like more cakey and those who like more fudgy, like a lot of brownie recipes do. I did follow a tip left by another reviewer that said to not mix this too much and to add the eggs at the very end of the mixing. This helped A LOT to make these more fudgy in consistency and even more choclatey in flavor, somehow. If you like a lighter and fluffier brownie, I would just follow the recipe as is. :) I also used 1 tablespoon vanilla instead and used Mexican Vanilla, which is so flavorful, mellow and smooth. I also do not frost brownies while still warm, especially if I have them in miniloafs or cupcake papers. With an instruction like 'do not overcook,' it may be a good idea to add more content of instruction or what to watch for, such as, 'Stick a toothpick in 2 iunches from the side of the pan (or in the center if mini loafs or muffin size). If the toothpick is ALMOST clean or clean, the brownies are done.' Just because not everyone trying this recipe has made brownies before and knows the difference between checking a cake and a pan full of brownies. :)"
"4","5","I didn't have honey so I used corn syrup. They were great."
"4","4","I followed recipe exactly. They taste great and frosting is delicious but after 40 min they still didn't seem like they were done but I took them out anyways. The texture was a little off but I think ill try them again."
"4","5","Arguably THE BEST and easiest brownie recipe EVER to exist. My mouth waters just thinking about these brownies. Minor changes I made: Double the recipe, cause one is not enough, second I add some extra cocoa cause I like more chocolatey tasting brownies, last but not least I also add less sugar because I like them better when they're not too sweet. People have always made great comments about these brownies and I think I'll stick to this recipe for a while :)"
"4","5","We love these brownies, I always have the ingredients on hand and they are easy to make. I often double the batch to make 16 cupcakes and frost with ganache which are always a hit."
"4","5","This was crazy easy. I threw in a handful of dark chocolate chips and may have added a little more cocoa than the recipie called for, and it still came out amazing. Seriously delicious brownies that didn't even need the frosting. Moist, rich, and so crazy easy. Rave reviews from my fam.   These are the best and easiest brownies ever."
"4","5","These literally are the best brownies. After mixing up the ingredients, I did not think I would have enough to fill my pan. But, do not be fooled- these brownies fluff up beautifully! I love the chewy fudge like consistency. Beats the box everytime."
"4","5","Great recipe; very quick and easy. I mixed with a fork until I got to the flour and then folded with a spatula. They came out nice and chewy. I didn't make the frosting because I had Andes baking chips that I wanted to melt on top. I'll definitely use this recipe again, and not worry about having brownie mix around."
"4","5","The first bite I took immediately gave me diabetes BUT it was soooo worth it! These brownies were so amazingly good but way, way, way too sweet for my family. Next time I won't do the icing and maybe I'll add a few chocolate chips instead. I even left the honey out of the icing because I didn't have any in my pantry and it was still ridiculously rich. The brownie itself came out chewy and fudgy and just perfect. This will be my new go to brownie recipe. It was just as easy as the boxed stuff but so much better. Thank you for sharing!"
"4","4","If you want more of a fudgy bownie out of these, add about 1/8 t of baking SODA and leave out the baking powder completely! I also used coconut oil instead of butter but greased the pan with butter. These turn out far more superior when made this way!"
"4","5","These brownies were AMAZING! I doubled the recipe (except the egg—only increased it by 1), used ½ white sugar and ½ brown sugar, added about 2/3 cup toasted walnuts, and 1 cup chocolate chips, and prepared in a 13x9” pan. (Note: I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder which is my favorite and Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips.) I skipped the frosting, because I didn’t think they even needed it. The result was like if a brownie and a piece of fudge had a delicious love child. Everyone who has had them LOVES them. Delicious, buttery, fudgy awesomeness. This is now my go-to brownie recipe. Whew…the search is finally over!!"
"4","3","Everyone's idea of the perfect brownie is different. It's like the best movie or the best restaurant. Ten different people would have 10 different answers. If you're a fan of cake-like brownies, these are gonna ring your bells. For me, however, I look for a moist, fudgy texture, similar to the texture of a boxed brownie mix (but obviously not the artificial taste!) These are pretty much just a dense cake. And I only baked for 21 minutes, not the 25-30 specified. This saved them from total dryness, but could not prevent the cake-like texture, which, if I had to guess, came from using leavening. Also mixed by hand, gently folding in the dry ingredients last, so the texture can't be blamed on that. No complaints about the taste, which is good. The frosting, made with corn syrup instead of honey (since so many reviewers said the honey taste could be detected) helped quite a bit. However, in this house, a brownie had better be able to stand completely on its own, i.e. have that elusive fudgy texture without any frosting, and these just weren't it. I've been waging a search for the perfectly chewy, fudgy textured and intensely chocolate flavored brownie, and so far, the Cook's Illustrated brownie recipe (March/April 2010) is the clear winner. This one isn't even close."
"4","5","Cooked for 23 minutes exact, was not 'cakey' was real 'fudgy' and good, topped it with some chooped almonds after frosting it, delish"
"4","4","I was desperate for something chocolate and had very little flour, so I tried these. They taste good, but the icing was incredibly thick...so much so it tore up the brownie. Do make sure that you read the other reviews about the icing before you try it."
"4","5","i would put more stars if there was any! i disagree sooo much with people who give this recipe 3 stars or lower  this recipe deserves 10 stars! i make them every other friday for dessert there a HUGE hit in my house! thanks so much for sharing this recipe!"
"4","5","I made these today at a hospice where I volunteer. They are delicious! I added walnuts and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips. I didn't frost them. I don't really care for frosting on brownies and the man I was making them for didn't want it either. The brownies were still a little gooey when I cut one after baking for 28 minutes but they were still quite warm and they had the chips. I am sure when they are cooled they will be perfect!"
"4","4","Very good brownie recipe! After reading other reviews I modified the recipe in the following way: Replaced butter with 1/2 cup apple sauce (non sugar added), reduced sugar to 3/4 cups, and only used 1 egg. I found they still had a 'cake' texture to them but they were very chewy and moist which I liked. They were still sweet but not too crazy and everyone loved them at the party I brought them too and were amazed they had no butter or oil in them. In order to reduce sugar intake and calories I did not add the icing but made just the brownies. I cooked in a larger pan 9x7in so they were thinner and only needed 10 minutes to cook at the indicated temperature. Based on the size of the pan I was able to get 15 brownies and if anyone is following Weight Watchers they are only 2 pro-points each! (With my modifications and based on WW France as that is the program I am on)."
"4","5","Super simple recipe. I followed exactly except I added walnuts to the batter. Should have doubled the recipe, these were gone in one day!"
"4","5","Perfect. No changes needed. If they don't come out, you either over-mixed or over-baked them."
"4","5","These brownies are melt in your mouth yummy. I made exactly as stated and they came out perfect. I always slightly undercook them. Made frosting and I stirred it with a fork,I had no problem with it blending together to make it spreadable.Easy recipe. I mixed it all by hand.I slightly beat the eggs before adding it to sug mixture.And stirred it all just until it was well moistened. easy easy.1 bowl one spoon. And of course frosting was just as easy. I like the honey in it too. I was leary at first. But def an excellent choice of brownie to make. I now have 2 fav brownies from this site. If you like choc,moist,fudgy then this is for you"
"4","5","Everyone loved them! both brownies and icing was great! Followed the recipe thanks!  update: My sons and hubby can't stop asking for them! Even my mom who don't like brownies loved these!!! That's a keeper!!"
"4","5","GREAT brownies! Super simple and really nice tasting. I was careful not to overcook them and they came out perfect. Definitely a fave! I made the icing but preferred them just as they were."
"4","5","Best brownies would be accurate! Not too thick or cakey and the perfect denseness that you expect from a brownie without the fudgy-ness...and to top it off, it gets the slightly crunchy edges that I love in a brownie!!!"
"4","5","These are so yummy!! I listened to some of the reviewers, which helped these turn out so great. I beat the eggs slightly with a fork before mixing them into the batter. I also hand mixed everything instead of using a mixer. Lastly, I baked for exactly 25 minutes and let cool for about an hour. I did as other reviewers smartly suggested as cut my brownies with a plastic knife, which helped them cut more smoothly. Just these little specific things made this recipe fabulous!! I should mention that I didn't frost these though. Many reviewers did not like the frosting and I didn't want to waste my brownies :) These turn out soft and fudgy and delicious. I think they'll be even better tomorrow once they've firmed up a bit. Thank you so much for the recipe as well as all the reviews!!"
"4","5","these are definitely the brownies i've been looking for. made mini cupcakes...Truly a keeper :)"
"4","3","I'm only rating the brownie, not the frosting, since I made these for the sole purpose of making brownie pops. The brownie alone wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. Id def agree with other reviewer that said these are somewhere between fudgy and cakey... you'd have to be someone who enjoys or doesn't mind cake like brownies to really love these. These made good brownie pops in the end but they aren't something id made again. Thanks anyways."
"4","1","It's chocolate cake, and not even good chocolate cake."
"4","5","These were the perfect brownies, taste and texture!  I doubled the recipe, and made them in a 9x13 inch pan. I thought they were going to be thicker, but the richness of the flavor made up for that.  For the frosting, I microwaved it after combining all the ingredients to make it more spreadable.  I don't think there can be another recipe to top this one."
"4","1","Actually this should be a 0 star review. My oh my..... This one I didn't see coming. Reading all the raving reviews I was prepared for at least a 'nice' brownie. Maybe too cakey (see reviews), but I didn't have chocolate chips and desperately needed a choc-fix.  This was greasy!! (And yes, I double checked to see if I had used the right amout of butter - even weighed what I had left in the fridge ;-) ) It took way longer to bake. After almost 50 min (I was still hoping for the best and chucking my good sense in the bin on the way...) I took it out of the oven and the problem was solved - it was sooooo greasy that it could never be 'set'. While it did rise very beautifully whilst baking, it fell immidiately - once again: due to the excess of butter. Still no choc-fix."
"4","5","Nothing beats an easy recipe and you probably have everything on hand to make it with, too. Perfect! I loved the honey in the frosting. These are like the expensive gormet brownies my kids love from the coffee places. No cake like disappointment here, just rich fudgey satisfying brownies. Did not change one thing! Thanks for sharing."
"4","5","I will never use a boxed brownie mix again. You can knock the prep for these out in less than 5 minutes, and everyone that has tried them absolutely loves them. I made them by the recipe a few times, but have made two changes to suit my familys tastes. Omitting the Vanilla extract makes these taste much more chocolatey. Using Oil instead of melted butter will give you the gooey, chewy texture that you want in a brownie but be warned that it makes the batter much thicker. You will have to spread them into the pan. Also, do NOT over-mix these!! Use a spoon, not a mixer! Only stir until it is all just combined. Over-mixing introduces air into the batter, which makes it more cake-like. We want brownies, not cake!! Finally, I don't think these need the frosting at all. I don't even make it anymore. They are rich and delicious enough without it. I keep bags of the dry portion of this recipe in my pantry so that I can pull it out and add the wet whenever I want brownies quickly."
"4","5","OMG good. I definitely just got my chocolate fix, and was able to whip these brownies up despite having not been to the grocery store in two weeks. Boyfriend LOVED them."
"4","5","Very yummy. I made them in 5 minutes and were out of the oven in 23 minutes. Didn't make the icing, but very tasty still. My daughter went for a run this morning and would have had them for breakfast if I hadn't had eggs ready for her! Thank you very much for the recipe."
"4","5","Here is what I do to get dense, thick, brownies. I'm not a big fan of cake like brownies. The secret I do is: 1. Beat the eggs well in a separate bowl before adding to sugar. 2. I use 1/2c sugar, 1/2c brown sugar 3. Fold in the flour and coca w/ spatula instead of beating in. The less the better, fold enough until just blended, this creates LESS air. 4. For my oven, cook exactly 24 min, most people overcook brownies. Then place brownies in ice bath or freezer to cool completely. This will create a more dense, less cake type of brownie! I don't even use the frosting, perfect w/ out!"
"4","5","Thouht these were really good. I didn't make the icing for this recipe, I used another recipe from this site, 'easy chocolate bundt cake glaze' because I had to use up some extra condensed milk I had. It was a great combination, very rich and chocolately. Thanks for sharing your recipe : )"
"4","5","Doubled this recipe and made for a church potluck and a family dinner. Both places raved about these brownies! Will definitely save this recipe and pull it out when I need to impress. ;)"
"4","5","I have to agree with the name. These are the best brownies. I've made them several times either with or without frosting, and I've enjoyed them both ways. My oven tends to run a bit hotter, so I took them out a few minutes before the recipe called for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing Angie!"
"4","5","Amazing, fudgy, easy to make"
"4","5","These are delicious, some of the best brownies I've ever made! And I didn't even include the frosting. One reviewer suggested adding peanut butter, so I put in about 2/3 cup. Yum! Fresh out of the oven, I did think they were slightly cakey, but very moist. The next day, they were perfect - chewy, dense, and fudge-like."
"4","5","SUICIDE BY CHOCOLATE!!! doubled recipe (only 3 eggs & 1/4tsp salt) in 9x13in pan, cooked only 28mins. Only need 1/2 of topping...SO MUCH CHOCOLATE!! Don't know if i'd call em brownies though, more like the little debbie cosmic brownies"
"4","5","Sooooo yummy, a little cakey but not too bad, next time im gonna bake for 22-23 min, 25 was more for a cake like brownie, also I used half applesauce for half the butter, used margarine instead of butter and still turned out awesome. defenitely will make again, frosting to de for and sooo easy!! i added 2 tbsp of milk as it was not mixing well, turned out perfect!"
"4","4","When I made these I replaces 1/4 cup butter with 1/2 cup applesauce (caution I'm at 5000ft so I need more moisture). I skipped the frosting. They were a little cakey but they were quite perfect when re-heated a little bit when they were a few days old. Will be making again and will throw caution to the wind and try the frosting."
"4","5","I love this recipe. I use rice flour in all of my baking to make it gluten free and it worked great for these brownies. I didn't use honey in the icing and added a tablespoon of water for smoother consistency. Everyone loved them, next time I'll double the quantity!"
"4","4","Made this recipe, halved, without icing. Delicious brownies -- not cakey (people who said that must have overmixed). Stuck a little to lightly greased pan, so next time I will grease and flour. Fell apart a little on day 2, but that might have been because the halved recipe came out pretty thin, even in a bread pan. Overall very happy with recipe and will doubtless make again."
"4","5","Delicious!"
"4","5","Very easy and quick, perfect for a chocolate craving. I took them out of the oven a few minutes early, because I was scared I was going to overcook them, but they turned out just fine. But yes I agree, definitely do not use a mixer, I used a wooden spoon and everything came out nice and fudgy.  EDIT: I just made these again and this time used 1/2 cup of sweetened applesauce (instead of the butter!) and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups. They are even better than the first time I made them. (the only reason I used sweetened applesauce was because we didn't have unsweetened, that's why I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup)  another edit: I have to make these every week now. boyfriend is rather obsessed. I always double the recipe, they last a day, maybe."
"4","5","Hubby said these are better than boxed. I grew up on boxed brownies and have to admit these are good,really good. They are rich, fudgy and more dense than cake. All in all a good brownie. I doubled the whole recipe and prob put a lil more cocoa than called for,also we like our brownie w/o frosting so I did not frost them."
"4","5","These were really quick to make. It took me literally 13 minutes to prepare the brownies, (exactly as the recipe was written), rinse my dishes and load them into the dishwasher. SUPER QUICK AND EASY! I don't like frosting though, so instead I put some mint chips on top after baking, and spread them after the chips melted. Really delicious. I'm glad to have an easy recipe to make that is not full of preservatives and fake ingredients!!"
"4","5","I only used the frosting on a slightly different brownie recipe. The frosting was great - the only thing I suggest is that it is easier to mix and then spread on the brownies if you microwave it for a few seconds. It spread pretty thin, though, so I'm not sure how some of these pictures got the frosting to look so thick!"
"4","4","These were easy to make and taste great. This was the first time I have ever made brownies from scratch and they turned out great. The frosting was good but I didn't think it was very easy to spread. My kids loved them!!"
"4","3","As another reviewer said, these are more cakey than I think of a brownie being. They were tasty and the icing helped but they were not what i was looking for"
"4","5","It may be helpful to note to also add 1 -2 tablespoons of milk to the frosting. They are very good. If done right and not overmixed/overbaked, they are fudgey and gooey. And of course the frosting is sweet. Isn't that the point?......This is the exact recipe from Hershey's website and they have the milk listed. I wrote that in my original review, but somehow my reviews are often edited or deleted without my permission. Interesting."
"4","5","This recipe is so delicious and is on Hershey Kitchens website. The name on their website is also Best Brownies. This is a no fail brownie recipe which I have use many times and is great every time. They also have a bigger version of this recipe for a 9x13 pan which is also very good."
"4","5","I am going to keep searching, but so far this is the best brownie recipe I have found. I don't like brownies other than out of a package, but these were yummy."
"4","5","Followed this recipe exactly and these turned out AMAZING. They were somewhat cakelike to begin with but if you wait overnight they loose that cakelike feel and become fudgey and delicious. Although mine barely lasted overnight ;) My husband made these for me and he didn't have any trouble at all. AWESOME RECIPE. Also my husband just made another batch so needed to edit. This time he added a cup of semisweet choc chips and it made it even more awesome! (like i thought that was possible) he mixed them into the batter when putting them in the pan."
"4","5","These are wayy better then the boxed kind and are very moist and delicious the frosting doesn't turn out though."
"4","5","These were really good, very nice texture, halfway between fudge and cake. I think they would have been better without the frosting to tell the truth. Perhaps could have used a little less sugar but that's my personal tastes. Changed: I put some mini marshmallows in the brownie batter. I had to add some milk to the frosting because even with melted butter and melted honey, the frosting was too dry and crumbly."
"4","5","For those who want the brownies less 'cakey', simply cut the baking powder in half. I doubled the recipe and left the baking powder at 1/4 tsp. and they turned out fudgy and delicious!"
"4","5","These brownies are superb, but truly more like fudge. I made the recipe exactly as stated. I mixed by hand all of the ingredients into the same pot that I melted the butter, so it was extremely simple and not messy! Do beat the eggs separately first. The frosting is wonderful, but I did have to add about 1 tablespoon of milk because of the large amount of dry ingredients. If you like cake-like brownies, this is not at all for you...but if you want a deliciously rich, fudgy, moist brownie, this will be your new go-to. I will definately line the pan with aluminum foil next time, though, so that I can remove the aluminum foil to cut and remove the brownies - they were nearly impossible to remove from the pan because of how moist they are. I recommend cutting them while they are still warm, but leaving them in place until they are cooled."
"4","4","I thought these were yummy if you like a chewy brownie...probably won't make again since they were not very thick..."
"4","5","amazing brownies! i didnt even make the frosting and they are delicious. oh yeah, I added a special ingredient. about 3.5g of cannabis ground up and cooked into the butter before making the mix. definitely a good recipe for medical marijuana patients, or anyone else who wants to experiment :)"
"4","5","Fabulous, fudgy, rich brownies. The frosting was perfect with them. These will most definitely satisfy your chocolate craving!"
"4","5","excellent! Instead of doing the icing, I swirled a cream cheese mixture (1 8 ounce package cream cheese, 1 egg, and a half cup of sugar) into the brownie batter after I'd spread it into the pan. thanks for an awesome recipe! It's a keeper for sure!"
"4","5","These truly are the 'Best brownies.' Following another reader's comment, I beat the eggs before adding it to the butter and sugar mixture, and the brownies came out just the way I like it - nice and fudgey. My roommates and I loved it. The second time I made it I forgot to beat the eggs first, and the brownies came out with more of a cake-like texture (still quite good though!) I'm a fan of nuts, so I've added sliced almonds to the batter. Have not tried the icing, as the brownie by itself is sweet enough."
"4","5","This recipe really is the best! Soft and gooey and delicious. I didn't make the frosting because they really didn't need it. Because this recipe is so easy (melt the butter in a microwave safe mixing bowl in the microwave and no electric beaters or whisks required) I will make it often."
"4","5","I make this recipe often. My kids love it. I sometimes omit the frosting and top with mint squares. Let them melt, and then swirl with a spoon. The mint cools to a nice crunch. It's pretty, and changes it to a delicious mint brownie."
"4","5","I have made this recipe many times and they always turn out grrrrreat!! Would recommend it to all. The flavour improves the next day. Try it, you;ll love it!"
"4","5","Awesome basic recipe. Some people requested brownies with more of a dark chocolate taste so I just used this recipe, halved the sugar and doubled the amount of good quality cocoa. Divine! Admittedly, this was a little cakey, but that's the way we like it anyway. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"4","5","Just an update: after the designated cooking time was up, I turned off the oven and left them in there for about 5 mins to set before taking them out... this solved the gooey middle and 'is it ready or not yet' dilemma."
"4","4","These were good, but were missing something specific. I have another brownie recipe that hits closer to what I'm looking for in a cakey, chewy, fudgy brownie. This is still a good recipe though."
"4","4","These brownies turned out very chewy. Everyone liked them. I may try use a little less sugar the next time, or leave out the frosting."
"4","1","I was verrrry displeased with this recipe. The brownies were dry and have a bad flavor; even with the chocolate chips i added, they were very unsatisfactory; my sister wouldnt even finish hers."
"4","5","Awsome brownies! I will admit that being 7 months pregnant I would probably enjoy a choclate covered burlap sack but it would only get one star."
"4","3","I made these and they are far to 'cake like' for my personal taste. I like my brownies to be fudgy and gooey. I did not make the frosting as I feel a good brownie needs no frosting. I managed to fix this recipe so that you get fudgy brownies everytime. Baking is a science and messing around with the ingredients I do not recommend for non-chefs but if you have a little bit of know how you can pull it off. This is how I did it. 1 Cup Sugar 1 stick (1/4 lb) melted butter 1 Egg 1 Egg yolk 2 tbs cold coffee (you can subsitute milk if you like) 1/3 cup dutch processed cocoa powder 1/2 cup flour pinch of salt Combine all ingrediens in a mixing bowl. Mix until almost smooth, bake at 350 for 12-15 minutes. Do not overbake. When a toothpick comes out clean they are done! When you mix all these ingredients the batter will be more liquid, then it was before with the original receipe. The original was more like a quick bread batter, and not like a brownie. The problem? The amount of protein and lack of liquid to make for a chewey fudgy center. Taking away one egg white greatly reduces the amount of protein in the finished product making it more tender and less like a cake. Also adding the 2 tbs of coffee/milk helps to add moisture to the batter. I use coffee because it brings out more of the chocolate flavor. I hope this helps others out there that desire a fudgier brownie. Heather Pastry Chef"
"4","5","These definatley are the best brownies! I didn't make the frosting and they were still moist and delicious. These are way better than any brownie mix. This is the only brownie recipe I am ever going to use."
"4","1","I have to admit that I am pretty disappointed with this recipe. This brownie recipe was easy to make, and I already had all of the ingredients for it (including the honey, which I thought was a strange and unnecessary addition) so I decided to make it for some neighbors.  My favorite brownies are the ones that are rich, dense, and taste more like fudge than cake. These brownies taste much more like cake than like fudge, which is probably why I didn't particularly like them. I will not make these brownies ever again."
"4","5","Excellent! I used a glass dish, so I lowered the temp to 325 degrees and cooked for ~32min. The frosting was a bit thick...I think I would just put in 3/4 cup of confectioner sugar next time. The brownie was chewy and fudgy!!! For those people who said that their brownie was 'too cakey', you may want to try lowering the temp (especially if you are using a glass or dark non-stick pan) and don't overmix the batter; overmixing the batter will cause the flour to become too glutinous and cakey. hope this helps:)"
"4","3","After so many great reviews, I thought nothing could go wrong with this recipe. As I sit here trying my first home-baked brownie, it makes me yearn for the box-brownies. There is nothing 'special' or out of the ordinary with these brownies."
"4","5","They were so good! It was my first time making brownies. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 by 13 in pan. also, i omitted the frosting and just sprinkled some powdered sugar over the top. It was a hit in my dorm!"
"4","5","Without the icing, these are 5 star brownies...Perfect! (The icing just doesn't work. I've tried the different suggestions but finally gave up. They are delicious w/o the icing, anyway, so why bother?) I double the ingredients (using 3 eggs) and bake in a 13x9 inch pan for 30 minutes. Delicious! Better than a mix and less expensive...plus they are made with ingredients always on hand."
"4","4","A quick round in the kitchen and you'll have some of the best brownies ever. This recipe is classic, beat the eggs before and don't over beat the mix. I have a feeling a couple of handfuls of walnuts will make these precisely the way I like my brownies. Update* I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup of the butter. Only used about 2/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup white. More healthy and great for the chocolate cravings. Next time I'll try all applesauce and leave out the butter."
"4","5","I am a huge devotee of a certain popular name brand mix out there on the market for brownies. I mean, this box mix is GOOD. But...you know, I'm a home cook, and I'm a pretty darned good home cook. I'm also Southern. Self-respecting Southern women don't use bake mixes unless it's absolutely necessary and unless we can be 100% certain that no one will ever find out. So. I read through about 10 different brownie recipes and settled on this one. I started my batter thinking, 'No WAY are these gonna be as good as my box.' I got some on my finger as I was spreading it in the pan and tasted the raw batter. NOT yummy. When the timer on the oven dinged, the aroma in the kitchen did not impress me. I wanted to hate these brownies, Y'all. HOLY CHOCOLATE MIRACLE OF MERCY...these are ridiculously good. I was astounded. These will be a regular around here from now on."
"4","3","These brownies are very easy to make. However, they only turn out average, and I actually prefer good box mixes to these. If you like chocolate cake, you will love this recipe. If you like a fudgier consistency, try Deep Dish Brownies from this site. I made this recipe and the Deep Dish recipe side by side and the Deep Dish ones were excellent. They have almost identical ingredients, just different ratios."
"4","4","oh my gosh. these are the best brownies ever. i was afraid because there were some mixed reviews and i guess it does come down to how you like your brownies, but i recommend you at least give this a try. i didn't know what people meant when they said it was 'cake like' but when i saw it come out of the oven, the brownie literally looked like a flatter chocolate cake. i am more fond of fudgey dense brownies so when i saw it and tasted it, it was good but not what i wanted. but i tasted it again the NEXT DAY and it is phenomenal. it is so much more dense, more fudgy and like others said, the perfect combo of fudgey and cakey. if you do prefer it really fudgey, i'd recommend mixing in some chocolate chips. the chocolate flavor as is is quite intense, though. i only made brownies from the box but i don't think i can do that again. especially when it's so much easier and tastier to do it at home. the batter amount is a little on the smaller side .. i'm used to making a brownie that's about twice this size so next time i might just double the recipe but keeping the recipe scale as is also makes me feel a little less guilty about eating the whole pan by myself. i didn't make any modifications except i used margarine instead of butter and microwaved it instead of heating it in a saucepan. i also tried to let the margarine cool for a few minutes because i didn't want it to cook the eggs. the slight downside is that it doesn't make that flaky top crust you see on the box"
"4","4","The brownies turned out fudgy the way I like them! These were great!! I made them exactly as in the recipe, except for omitting the frosting. The brownies were rich and sweet without the frosting and I don't need the extra calories!! I would like to learn how to make a better 'crust' on my brownies, though!!"
"4","5","Wow! I had never made home-made brownies in Colorado before. Living in high-altitude made me nervous to try. I eliminated one egg and reduced the baking time by 5 mins. I also agree with the person who said to reduce the confectionary sugar and add more melted butter for a glazed consistency for the frosting. Mine came out fudgy but I think its b/c of the high altitude. I plan on making these a lot. Thanks for the recipe!"
"4","5","I made these this afternoon because I had all of the ingredients on hand which was wonderful. They are delicious! It's hard to only eat one, but I had to control myself so there would be enough for everyone else. Very rich, but very tasty! I had to add a little bit of water to the glaze when I was mixing it together because it was just too thick and tough. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. They were amazing. Just some tips: Make sure when you're cutting your brownies into squares you use a plastic knife. The brownies won't stick to the plastic as much so there's less crumbs and the individual brownies have smoother sides. Also before greasing/flowering your pan you could put down a piece of foil or parchment paper and make sure about 2 inches of it sticks out over each side of the pan. That way, once the brownies are cool you can easily lift them out of the pan. Just make sure you still grease and flower the pan after you put down the paper."
"4","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had, and I've had a lot of brownies. Just the right balance of cake to fudge texture. I say this even though I cheated on the recipe. I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan, but I substituted 1/2 the sugar with granulated Splenda, 1/2 the butter with apple sauce, and half the eggs with egg substitute and it still came out fantastic! I did not find that adding milk helped the icing problem, however 20 seconds in the microwave made it possible for me to make a decadent, smooth icing."
"4","5","Simply fabulous! I always add a little bit extra cocoa, because I like them to have a real dark chocolate flavour. For an extra kick, I sometimes add 1/2 tsp each of chili powder and cinnamon."
"4","4","These were really good, reminded me of the ones you make with the box mix. However, the edges got kind of hard and crunchy. The middle ones were perfect, though. Thanks for the post!"
"4","5","I doubled the recipe and they came out perfect in a 9x13 pan. I think it is critical for the butter to cool completely before adding the eggs or else the brownies can turn out dense and/or dry. I added the cocoa to the melted butter and then stirred till smooth. After it cooled I added first the eggs, then the sugar/vanilla, and lastly the dry ingredients. This is how I do brownies when made with baking chocolate instead of cocoa. I didn't use the baking powder because I've never used it for brownies before. I followed a previous reviewer and only did half the powdered sugar for the frosting, but for some reason what was supposed to be glazed endup up thick as fudge. So I thinned it with evaporated milk and it made a lovely ganache-like frosting. I topped the frosting with sliced almonds because that's what I had on-hand. The general consensus is that they were fabulous!"
"4","5","This is a great brownie recipe...just fudgie enough. I was a little unsure of the honey in the topping but it was fantastic! Thanks for a great brownie recipe Angie."
"4","5","Yummy!!! I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 pan. Made the recipe as directed except I only added 3 eggs, little over 1/4 teaspoon baking powder and 1 cup of walnuts. I made the frosting as directed (didnt't double). I did melt the butter (not softened) for the frosting recipe and applied it to the hot brownies and had no problems with it spreading. I topped the frosting with walnut pieces. Very dark, fudgy brownies! Will make again! Not the boxed taste (this is more fudgy), but still definatly a very yummy brownie that was very easy to make!  P.S. I can imagine these brownies with mini marshmellows, walnuts or pecans baked inside and topped with carmel sauce, mini marshmellows and nut pieces."
"4","5","A great brownie recipe. All the rewiews are right. Will make again many times. thanks for the recipe. :-)"
"4","1","I thought these were really bad. I am a great baker and always get many compliments for that. Nobody really liked them. The taste was not horrible BUT I expected so much more considering they are called the best and all the great reviews it received. Huge dissapointment."
"4","1","I thought these were horrible. Maybe it's because I have only eaten boxed brownies. I dont know, but i did not like them. They were really dry and the icing was so thick it would not spread."
"4","5","Yum Yum Yum. I really really liked these. Bye Bye Boxed Brownie mix. I cut out the honey in the icing, cause I can't stand the taste of honey, and added 2 tablespoons of milk. My brownies were not cake like at all. Maybe others tasted cake like, cause they over beat their batter. Thanks for a great recipe :)"
"4","5","No changes except for adding 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, these are perfect every time. The icing always needs a bit of milk to be spreadable, however. Fabulous!"
"4","5","This was a GREAT recipe!! It's easy and it tastes great. I wouldn't advise it without the icing though. It is rich too. I added a bit more butter to the icing and heated it(just enough to melt the butter) in a metal bowl to make it all come together. I also added a little milk to tweek the icing into a nice mix. Probably won't buy another box again. And my peoples loved it!!"
"4","5","Very good and very easy. Next time I will be using just basic frosting I did not like the honey in the frosting."
"4","5","mmmm... not the best homemeade brownies, but certainly tasty! i'm glad i tried this recipe. use dutch cocoa and, if you have it, grind a bit of nutmeg into the batter."
"4","5","Heaven!!!!! These. Are. Delicious! The best things I've ever made. Not too sweet either. Nice and easy. Chewy.  Moist. I have to admit I melted the butter in the microwave--but they are still DELICIOUS!!!!"
"4","5","I've never made brownies from scratch before, but these are awesome! My friend, who previously didn't like brownies, was gobbling these up and hiding them from me! I did add 3/4 cup of walnuts to the batter after mixing the ingredients together, and they were yummy, much better than store bought. They taste even better the next day. I agree with the advice of other reviewers, if you want rich, fudge-like brownies, don't overmix the batter. Use an electric mixer, and you'll get chocolate cake."
"4","5","These are a great traditional-cake like brownie. These are not the really fudgy/wet type. They are easy to make and all in 1 (2 Qt.) saucepan. I read others reviews and would like to advise: If using a dark and/or nonstick coated pan reduce oven temp. by 25 degrees, if your oven runs hot do the same and bake the same amt. of time. As far as a doneness indicator, watch for the edges to slightly pull away from pan and the top (center) springs back when lightly touched. Top should look dry not wet. If you follow this advice you will have no problems what so ever. Good luck and remember, brownies can be tricky to make because it's easy to overbake them! ;)"
"4","5","Excellent brownie recipe! I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan. I also subbed shortening for the butter. They cooked in the minimum amt. of time and the edges WEREN'T hard!I did not try the frosting recipe and they are fabulous without it. I had all the ingredients on hand too and that's a plus."
"4","1","Yikes! This did not come out well. Maybe I didn't add enough sugar or butter but it barely had any taste to it and crumbled easily. I also didn't make the frosting because chocolate frosting on chocolate brownies seemed like overkill so I added peanut butter to the batter for taste and to make them even moister. Didn't help! Probably will be sticking to Betty Crocker in a box from now on."
"4","5","This recipe turned out just fine. Even though I feel I overcooked it a bit. The max should be 25 minutes - not 25-30 minutes. I took others advise and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips. The only other thing I did differently is when I greased the pan I didn't use flour over the grease but cocoa. I always hate to see the white or tan from the flour in the pan. This works great. I will certainly make this again."
"4","4","These brownies are great! A very classic recipe. I would give it 5 stars if only it weren't quite as sweet, I adjusted it with adding less sugar the 2nd time I made it. I also add chopped walnuts to the recipe, about 1 cup, and it definitely makes this recipe so much better. I have made these brownies about 5 or 6 times and I still love them! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Update: I just made them now without the icing and I think I like them better this way. Not as sweet and still very tasty. They are definitely more on the chewy side, not fluffy. But I like them this way! Yum. Sooo easy to make, and great for a chocolate fix."
"4","4","These were good, though I do have to agree that the icing was not my favorite part (hence the 4 stars). For someone else that was asking why the icing was so thick: The recipe calls for the brownies to be iced while still warm, which means that the icing will melt and spread, seeping into the nooks and crannies of the brownie. A good concept, but in reality, when it cools, the icing turns really crusty - not smooth and creamy. If you're looking for smooth and creamy, go with your favorite icing (homemade or storebought). The brownies themselves were still quite good, soft and chewy. Scrumptious, really.  I added chopped walnuts and chocolate chips for a little something extra, but that's just personal preference."
"4","2","These were not brownies, in my opinion. It was more like a cake and not very sweet. My family didn't care for them so we gave them to my chocoholic friend (who can eat anything that's chocolate) and even she wasn't too enthused by them!"
"4","5","These brownies were great. I tried them at high altitude (7000 ft) and they were delicious. Definitely don't overcook, 25 minutes was absolutely perfect for a glass pan, and for the dark non-stick pn, even less time would have been better."
"4","5","The title is correct; these are the best. Fudgy, dark, moist. My husband and I have almost finished the pan. I added 3/4 cup chopped pecans and 1/4 cup chocolate chips just for an extra kick. So easy to make--why would you want to buy a boxed brownie? I also tried making these using half the butter, substituting 1/4 apple sauce for the deleted butter, and they still turned out yummy. They were a little more cakey and harder to cut, but still delicious."
"4","5","nice and gooey brownies everyone loved them and they disapeared really quickly. Make sure to wait untill it cools off before icing otherwise it will be a glaze hahaha! This is what I had originally wrote in 2003. Updated to 2006 - When you make the frosting add 1 tbsp milk or water since the frosting tends to be powdery. Do not overbake. 25 minutes is enough otherwise you will have to trim the edges of the brownie since they will be scorched. I do recommend a dark cocoa such as droste's cocoa if you can get it. Darker cocoa improves the flavor."
"4","1","I was so disappointed. They were very tasteless and not worth the effort."
"4","5","Its the best brownies I've ever eaten! They are so good and creamy, and oh so rich!"
"4","3","I must have made these wrong or something, because everyone else seemed to love them. I wasn't all that crazy about them. The taste was only a little better than the brownies you get from brownie mix. And the brownies were flat in the center, they only rised around the edges. That may have been something I did, but I followed the directions exactly."
"4","5","These are a new favorite in our house. They always come out of the oven just as they should, smelling wonderful and tasting even better."
"4","5","I used this recipe to get my chocolate fix when I was 6 months pregnant. They were so quick and easy. I've made them so much I have the recipe memorized!! I confess I have never made the icing-they are so good without it! I add 2 tsp of vanilla and that makes them even better!"
"4","5","AWESOME brownies, very rich and fudgey!!"
"4","5","YES!!!!!!!! I took these brownies to a family party today, and EVERYONE who tried them LOVED them, even my picky cousins who never eat anything. They were absolutely delicious and very moist. My cousin ate about six or seven of them, and almost refused to put them on the table to share. I am now required to bring these to every family party. A few notes: I substituted margarine for the butter, because we didn't have enough butter, and they were still wonderfully moist. I doubled the recipe and used a 9' by 13' pan, and only had to bake them for 25 minutes. And, finally, I was really disappointed to read the reviews complaining about the frosting. I thought it was wonderful: not too sweet, and the honey added a nice flavor. Everyone who tried them agreed with me. They were AWESOME!!! I will look no further for a brownie recipe. Thanks Angie, you made everyone think that a 14 year old can be a really good cook! One more thing: I found the icing to be too stiff, as I had anticipated, due to the lack of liquid in it. Those of you who have ever made frosting before know to add some milk to make it to a spreadable consistency. True, it might not of been stated in the recipe, but one can infer that. It's not that difficult to figure out! :) What I did was add about two tablespoons of CHOCOLATE MILK!!! Yummy!!!!!!"
"4","4","The edges got a bit hard while the center was mushy."
"4","5","These were very good--great flavor, really light, and really easy. I'll be cooking them again!!"
"3","5","I think you should skip the frosting."
"3","5","wasn't sure what to expect as the reviews seem quite mixed, but they were lovely, im really pleased with them. I didn't over mix and omitted an egg when doubling the recipe and they were great. recommend this recipe"
"3","5","Simple, easy recipe with a wonderful glaze. Never have to worry bout leftovers."
"3","5","I doubled everything except the eggs and it was ridiculously delicious"
"3","5","I live in Thailand, married to a beautiful Thai lady and she cooks the most delicious food. About once every couple of weeks she asks.... 'tirak (darling) you make blaunlie for me', and we make this recipe, except we add raisins and chopped nuts. Like most other reviews we leave off the frosting. They are sheer heaven, but I guess we've both got a sweet tooth.  Thanks for the helpful tips in the # 1 review (CRBOWLES) we follow your advice to the letter!!!"
"3","5","This brownie recipe is BY FAR the BEST brownie recipe EVER! They are chocolatey and gooey in the middle. They are not to rich or too thick/ thin. No need for the frosting. They are perfect without it. We did add a few chocolate chips to the batter because everything is better with chocolate chips! Enjoy!"
"3","5","Easy & delicious! Used the 9x9 'Bake-Lift-Serve' 12 pc brownie pan for 18 minutes, came out perfect and my kids loved it"
"3","5","Perfect brownie! My family loved them! Followed recipe. I did add 1 tsp. 1/2 & 1/2 to icing. The butter should be melted instead of just softened, IMHO. Great recipe!"
"3","5","Fast & easy recipe! I doubled the recipe and they are PERFECT."
"3","5","these are awesome...I loved the texture and the taste...the only thing I did differently was I sifted the flour with the cocoa powder and then added it to the butter sugar mixture with the vanilla. Oh, and I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and then dusted with cocoa powder. I can't wait to try these again and make them into turtle brownies...thanks Angie!"
"3","4","WOW! I was amazed at how good these were! My 11 yr old daughter made these. I think they needed a little more cocoa which we'll add next time. Great recipe!!"
"3","5","Very tasty! Just a little too sweet frosting :)"
"3","5","This recipe is simple and very delicious! I've made several batches and have had requests for more."
"3","5","I've made these a few times a month for my kids , for the last few years & they turn out perfect every time .   I don't make the frosting , to sweet for us"
"3","5","These are the best homemade brownies I have ever made! However, next time I make them I will put a little less vanilla in them. The vanilla was a very strong taste on the first bite."
"3","4","Great brownie for the most part. I have a difficult time finding recipes for brownies that don't come out raw or dry. This was fairly neutral. I did, however, use Hersheys dark cocoa. We make everything 'dark' chocolate. It's a nice touch on this recipe. It does not serve 16! More like 6!!"
"3","5","This truly a great recipe. Perfect brownies one bowl(pan) and simple. Prep time of 25 min is overstated more like 10 min. I have a convection oven, 25 minutes on convection bake is perfect. Frosting recipe should say melted butter instead of softened. As for the negative reviews which almost kept me from trying this recipe...it is not the recipe that is the problem, I have made these several times now and I can not figure out how anyone could screw them up."
"3","5","OMG!!! This was the best brownies that I have ever had. I made them (w/o the frosting) for New Year's Eve and the kiddos loved it. The very next day...we doubled the recipe and made the brownies with the frosting. Shut the front door they were amazing. Don't over mix the eggs or the batter. Enjoy!"
"3","5","I mixed the ingredients together easily with just a wooden spoon and after 25 minutes in the oven, they were a-w-e-s-o-m-e. I was looking for a replacement to my previous 'Best Ever' brownie recipe that I got off the back of a Nestle Choco-Bake box. It was my 'go to' for years, but Choco-Bake is no longer available in stores and substitutions for it were not the same. This recipe was a welcome relief and completely comparable to my old favorite. THANKS!"
"3","2","I don't know how these brownies got such great reviews. The brownies themselves lacked depth of flavor and the frosting was entirely too sweet. The Brook's Best Bombshell Brownies recipe on this site or the brownie recipe on the back of the Ghirardelli ground chocolate container are far better than this recipe. So disappointing!"
"3","5","LOVE! Easy quick and ALWAYS a fave!"
"3","5","Easy Recipe to follow and great tips from those who have reviewed it. I love this and it will now be my brownie recipe.-claudia"
"3","5","I just made these and OMG!! They are sooooo good. I added chocolate chips for extra chocolate. These are awesome!!"
"3","5","These are scrumptious!!Super easy, and brings a whole new meaning to comfort food. I made these for a class trip and substituted the frosting for melted milk chocolate with coconut sprinkled on top, and they were a hit! I also left mine to cool in the pan overnight before cutting and taking out of the tray. Super delicious, and an all-around crowd pleaser. I would make 'em again in a heartbeat!"
"3","5","I just made these and already ate 2!! These are so good!! I did not even make the frosting. I am never buying box brownie mix again."
"3","5","I will never make brownies from a box again. The brownies tasted amazing and were so easy to make - I made them with my 5yo and 2yo! Seriously, just follow the directions and measurements to the letter, and you won't be disappointed. The only thing that wasn't clear to me was the butter. I used salted butter in the mix and nonsalted butter in the frosting. Tasted great that way."
"3","5","These brownies are AMAZING!!!"
"3","5","made it exactly to recipe, did NOT add the frosting. those babies are MONEY brownies. Best brownies I've ever tasted."
"3","5","These are really the best I never have to go and buy box brownies ever again. I have 6kids and they love it I really can't make enough. I just put them in my oven for 25minutes to the tee.Dont take my word for it.Try it :-) :-) :-)"
"3","5","Learn from my mistake: Do NOT over mix! My first batch came out cake-y and not soft and mushy like a brownie should be. I knew I over mixed it because the batter was too smooth and glossy. The second batch was just a tad lumpy and the brownies were SO good! Soft, chewy, a slice of chocolatey goodness."
"3","2","They were too cake-like for brownies."
"3","5","These are very good and simple to put together. The icing is very good too :) I did add walnuts and I beat the icing with a mixer and added about a T of milk ... VERY GOOD."
"3","5","The best part about this recipe is that it calls for the most basic ingredients which I had in my pantry. I did have to pop the brownies back in the oven for 30 seconds so that the icing was easier to spread. No big deal though. These brownies paired well with our espresso. Yum!"
"3","5","Yummmmmm!!!!! Wow these are so good. This was my first attempt and they turned out perfect! I skipped the frosting and just sprinkled powdered sugar!"
"3","5","The best brownies. They are so much better than a box. I don't think I'll ever go back to using a mix. To make them extra yummy we add some chocolate chips!"
"3","5","This is my go-to recipe for brownies. But for the first time I also made the frosting and it came to perfect consistency which is delicious with honey. My husband loves it!"
"3","4","Very good box-like brownies."
"3","5","This was my second recipe I tried today, its AWESOME! Batter is able to be poured, bakes very well and the brownies aren't flat! All my kids love it and said it tastes great! We didn't try the frosting this time but def. will next time!"
"3","5","Seriously, this is the PERFECT brownie recipe! It's exactly the type of brownie I love -- rich, chewy, fudgy, but not too sweet. Better yet, this recipe is delightfully easy to make with ingredient you tend to have on hand. With this, you'll never have to buy a box mix again."
"3","5","Made without the frosting- followed all the advice: mixed eggs by themselves before hand, blended minimally with a wooden spoon, and only cooked for 25 minutes. Delicious!"
"3","3","I don't understand how everyone is getting a cake-like brownie from this recipe. They must be over-baking them or their oven might be too hot. I baked mine 20 minutes and it wasn't long enough; they were a little too 'gooey'. Will try a couple more minutes next time. Not enough chocolate flavor for me. I might try unsweetened baking chocolate next time, in place of the cocoa."
"3","5","Easy peasy recipe. I just did the brownies with powdered sugar, without the glaze. turned out perfect!"
"3","5","Holy moly! These are GOOOD! Everyone at work raved about these! I did as some of the reviews suggested: ~ Definitely double the recipe & use a 13x9 pan. These WILL disappear quickly! ~ I melted the butter in a pan over the stove, allowed it to cool a few minutes, & then mixed everything in by hand with a wooden spoon. Mix as little as possible in order to get nice, gooey brownies! ~ I melted the butter for the frosting, too, & also used only 1/2 c. powdered sugar. I didn't have any honey, so I substituted light corn syrup instead. It was easy to drizzle on, & never fully hardened, again giving us the yummy delicious melt-in-your-mouth brownies. It's so easy, & SOOO delicious, that I don't think I'll do boxed brownies ever again. DEFINITELY keeping this recipe! THANK YOU! :)"
"3","5","AMAZING just the way the recipe is written -- and that's very rare for me to say. I don't give 5 stars easily & I have reviewed A LOT of recipes on this site. You know how on the boxed brownies they have an option to make the brownie a little more cake-like but they still turn out fudgey & chewy? That's exactly how these are. In fact, I saw no difference in texture from those box ones with the cakeir option. They're perfect. They're not as cake-like as a bakery brownie typically is but yet not as chewy as the one egg box version. Icing is very sweet. I added about 1/8 cup to 1/4 cup Hershey's chocolate syrup like the best boxed brand does. THAT took these over the top & there is no need for icing when you add the chocolate syrup. I won't buy boxed brownies ever again. These are easy as can be. I'm thrilled with this recipe."
"3","5","What an awesome recipe, thanks."
"3","5","Wow, they were amazing. Loved the frosting with a hint of honey."
"3","5","Ive made this a couple times now. It's always a hit. I follow the directions to the letter with one exception, DARK cocoa powder. Turns out amazing! I rationalize and say that I am getting the benefit of the antioxidants...."
"3","4","So good!!"
"3","5","Easiest brownies I have ever made. I love that it is all in one pot, so there is less to clean up! I think they are great with and with out the frosting. Also, I have made the frosting with and without honey and it does not make a notable difference."
"3","5","I doubled this recipe exactly and made the frosting as written. It is rich and cake like. I used a 9x13 pan. I had to use soften butter spread cause ran out of stick butter and my frosting was nice and creamy. Will definitely make again."
"3","5","I love this recipe, just don't overbake and you will too. It doubles nicely into a 9x13, and sometimes I add chocolate chips and or nuts."
"3","5","I have made these delicious brownies 3 times to include in my husband's lunches. They are awesome and too easy. Do NOT overcook them. I did once. They were still good but, not as good as they are after baking 25 minutes. I also bake them for my 2 sons (22 and 20 yrs old) and deliver to them. They are always thrilled! Thanks, Angie, for such a wonderful recipe!"
"3","5","I love this recipe, they turned out amazing! I did every thing exactly as directed except I did add about a TBSP of milk to the frosting, and it was perfect. I made them for the 2nd time tonight, and they're now my only brownie recipe. Never again from a box!"
"3","5","made them for the first time for a tail gate. They were gone in the first 30 hour. making them again tonight!"
"3","5","These are dangerously addictive. I must have them all the time, lol.  But seriously, a couple of things.  1) the frosting will look and feel too dry and cracked at first. Add it to the brownies immediately after they come out of the oven, and keep smushing around the frosting every once in a while for about 30 minutes. Eventually it will settle into a thick fudge like top.  2) 35 min. will not hurt them, but I found 30 min to give the brownies a far superior texture.  3) The second time I doubled the frosting-it makes the brownies SOOOO amazing.  4) when I doubled the frosting recipe, instead of doing 6 tablespoons of cocoa, since I was short on it, I used 3 tablespoons cocoa, and melted 3 tablespoons of chocolate chips with the butter. I think this made the frosting even fudgier.  Anyway, this is a must try recipe. If you think, like me, that you have tried and tasted all brownie recipes, you must try this one, and be amazed. My new favorite go-to brownie.  Thanks Angie!!!"
"3","5","This recipe has the perfect balance of cakey and fudgey textures, sure to be a crowd-pleaser. I followed others' advice and halved the amount of confectioners' sugar in the icing, which made it stay a bit sticky, but it was so rich and creamy, not overpoweringly sweet. I'll definitely be making these again in the near future."
"3","4","We made this for memorial day. The kids loved the frosting!"
"3","3","I wont say these were the best brownies as the name implies, they were tasty but I will keep looking for the chewy ones like the box brownies."
"3","5","awesome without frosting! and the fastest i've perhaps ever made...i put ice cream on top"
"3","5","These were absolutely delicious. I didn't make the frosting, but used a mint layer topped with a chocolate coat. I used an 8x8 dark pan with greased parchment paper lining the bottom. For some reason, my brownies were done after 20 minutes- maybe because of the dark pan. These were very moist with a rich dark color! I do have to say, they were a bit rich for my family's taste."
"3","5","Do not thin the frosting. It is like a second layer on the brownies and makes them so yummylicious! Work the frosting with a fork until it's the consistency of biscuit or pizza dough. It takes 10 minutes. Pat it out with your hands and then lay on top of the warm brownies, just out of the oven a few minutes. Wait a couple of minutes and then spread. Use a frosting spreader and dip it in water every now and then to make the spreading a bit easier. It is not a traditional 'frosting'. To thin it, so it's runny and goopy just ruins it in my opinion. The frosting if done properly looks like the frosting in the main picture (with the autumn sprinkles).  I'm almost 50 and at one time was a professional baker, and in my opinion these probably are the best brownies I've ever tasted.  I have a cold and should be eating chicken soup right now, but all I want is more of these brownies and unfortunately they're all gone :("
"3","5","Love the medium soft/medium chewy texture! Added walnuts, about 2/3 cup for personal preference. My pickier eater child loved them and he usually avoids brownies. Great WITHOUT FROSTING!"
"3","5","These brownies are excellent!!!! I will use this recipe from now on. They are very rich in flavor. If you dont like too much chocolate dont bother making them. The frosting was perfect. They were gone the same day I made them. Great recipe!!!!!"
"3","4","they were great but why did the frosting not have milk it was very hard tomix so we added milk and it came out great!"
"3","5","This was my first time making homemade brownies and I had to as was out of mixes. I was making cheesecake topped brownies from this site. This was very easy and I ended up making a double batch as 1 batch did not fill the bottom of my extra large pan. I wanted a thin brownie with the cheesecake. It did come out thicker, but very moist and delicious. It really complimented the cheesecake over which I poured a chocolate ganache. Everyone raved about it, saying the brownies would be great on their own, they were just that good. I will be making them by themselves in the future. They were pretty sweet and chocolaty so I may just sift some powdered sugar over them w/o any other topping."
"3","4","These were really good even without the frosting. It's as simply as this... If you make them and you think they are to cake like all you have to do is some simple subtraction... If you like them cakey then use both eggs... If not then simply use one egg and there you have it non cakey brownies..."
"3","4","These are really delicious brownies that are the perfect consistency and flavor. Not too fudgey, not too sugary. (I didn't make the frosting since I don't care for frosting on brownies). The recipe doesn't make much batter at all though. I only got about 5 brownies out of it. I would recommend doubling it, unless you're on a diet and trying to limit your sweets! Also a side note, let the saucepan cool for a bit before adding the eggs so you don't end up accidentally frying the eggs."
"3","5","They are in my oven right now and they smell MAGNIFICENT. BROWNIES!"
"3","5","Simply Wonderful..."
"3","5","I had to make this recipe several times before I could make an accurate assessment of the recipe. I found that by reducing the flour to 1/3 cup from 1/2 cup, it definitely gives the brownie a more fudge-like texture. As has already been mentioned, those experiencing cake-like texture, it really helps to mix all the ingredients by hand and almost fold the flour in as the last ingredient. Over mixing, or using an electric mixer will definitely give you a cake rather than a brownie. I've also folded in miniature marshmallows and chopped walnuts for a 'rocky road' brownie. Personally, I find no need for the frosting, but that is just me."
"3","2","Idk whats wrong with it but I make a lot of stuff that turns out great, pies, cakes, bread, cookies, etc. but I have made this twice and idk why but it just doesnt taste good to me its like theres not enough chocolate or something. I added some more sugar and that helped it but not too much. I am looking for bakery quality brownies so I guess I have to go some where else."
"3","3","Are very thin, are more 'cakey' than fudge-brownie like, baked in 20 minutes. I like but don't love them. I definitely suggest adding chocolate chips, peanut butter, and/or nuts. I didn't make the icing part of the recipe."
"3","5","I give this 5 stars as the most delicious FUDGE I'd ever had. These didn't come out as brownies; they were impossible to cut and get out of the pan. We ended up cutting off pieces with a fork. I am going to try this again with a little more flour because it really tasted great. I used Guittard chocolate, which is always a good idea!"
"3","5","OMG. These brownies have ruined me for all other brownies. They are so delicious, I'd give them 10 stars if I could. The best I've ever had. I didn't bother with the frosting, they were sweet enough without it. I made no changes to the original recipe. Thank you for sharing, Angie!"
"3","4","Really good recipe. I use hersey's special dark cocoa. I sift all dry ingredients together except sugar so there are no lumps. Melt butter and mix in sugar and let cool a little. Beat eggs, add cooled butter/sugar and then slowly add in dry ingredients. I cut into 1 inch squares and dipped tops in Bittersweet ganache made with 9 oz. chips and 1 c. of hot cream (whipped till chips melt). Much better topping than the frosting listed."
"3","4","These were not as chewy as I had hoped they would be. Instead of using the suggested frosting, I used my chocolate cream cheese frosting. Tasted really good! Next time I will bake it for less than 25 minutes to see if they will be awesomely chewy."
"3","5","If I could give this recipe more stars, I would. Have been making these brownies for years. They are so easy and taste wonderful!!!"
"3","5","Ok Ok its the best brownie. Ahhh you twisted my arm. For the best results line the pan with parchment. Let it come up and out of the pan on two sides. When its done and cooled you can just lift it right out. Also mix the dry ingredients together, mix the sugar and vanilla with the melted butter, beat eggs in a cup, beat into sugar mixture, add flour mixture and mix with spatula about 50 strokes. cook for 25-30 and take it out. I wait till cooled then cut with a wet knife."
"3","5","These were fantastic! Everyone loved them."
"3","3","I've found that a lot of these reviews, while well-intentioned, aren't exactly as specific as I would have liked, so let me get down to the nitty gritty here. First, these are neither strictly cakey, nor strictly fudgy, though they lean much more to the fudgy side because of their small crumb, and have an intense richness that also contributes to the mouth and brain interpreting them as fudgy. Chewiness seems to generally fall somewhere in between the other two categories, but in this instance, that is not the case. These aren't the slightest bit chewy. If that's what you're looking for (which I was...), look elsewhere.  To give you a better idea of how I went about constructing them to get the fudgier texture, I melted the butter in the microwave, then in the same bowl, stirred all the ingredients together by hand using a spatula. I was careful not to overmix, and stopped when everything just began coming together. To ensure they weren't overbaked, I took them out at 25 minutes and tested them with a skewer. If you don't beat the heck out of these, what you'll end up with is something that's quite light (this is where I assume people are coming up with the 'cakey' designation), with a small crumb, and a fudgy, rich taste. Overall, the taste is quite good, but they weren't what I was looking for, so the search continues!"
"3","5","This is my go-to brownie recipe. It's definitely much better than boxed brownies any day."
"3","5","These brownies are easy and very good. I'm fussy about brownies, and they made the cut. I doubled the recipe, good thing, half gone hours later..."
"3","4","Like one reviewer said - the texture of this brownie lays somewhere between chewy and cakey. Very yummy and easy. I may skip the icing next time - it was good but not needed as the brownies are plenty sweet on their own."
"3","4","Not sure that I like the inbetween fudgy and cake-like brownies. Other than that, really enjoyed these."
"3","5","These brownies turned out Fabulous! I doubled the recipe and still used my 8x8, they took a little longer to bake, but they were super thick, moist and fudgey! I will be making them again and again!! Thanks Angie!"
"3","5","My friend wanted brownies for her birthday, so I looked up this recipe... I'm in the middle of making them, and so far so good! The frosting is fantastic, but still a little rich... I poured one batch into my 9' pan, and it didn't look like enough so I made another batch for the same pan and now they're going to be gigantic brownies! Fabulous recipe! Thanks for sharing it!"
"3","5","I followed this recipe to a tee. My frosting didn't turn out, wouldn't spread. The brownies though...amazing!!! Definitely my go to recipe!!"
"3","5","Have been making these brownies forever... believe they are a Bob Appetit recipe. I never change a thing and they always turn out perfectly. FYI I mix the entire recipe in a large Pyrex measuring cup, melting the butter in the microwave, then adding the remaining ingredients after."
"3","5","Very easy and very good! If you have trouble with the frosting being too crumbly, just keep stirring with a fork!"
"3","3","I was looking for a rich, dense, fudgy brownie that made me crave a glass of milk. These are more cake-like and moderately chocolately(I didn't make the frosting). You can tell cocoa powder was used instead of baking chocolate bars. I give the flavor 2 stars because it was OK but 4 stars because they're very easy to make."
"3","4","I used less sugar (maybe about 1/8 less) to minimize the sweetness and it was still very delicious. I'm not quite sure this is THE brownie recipe for me personally, but it was a hit with my co-workers."
"3","4","A little TOO sweet for our tastes (the frosting s overkill), but still very good with great brownie texture. A cream cheese frosting would be divine."
"3","3","The frosting for these brownies is delicious. But as many others have said, these are a bit too cakey for me, not chewy at all like brownies should be."
"3","4","It smelled soooooooooo gooood!"
"3","5","Amazing!! Thank you for the recipe! Yeahs, s I think that the people who said that the brownis were cakey may haveleft them in their oven alittle too long. When I took mine out they looked completely underdone, but I resisted my temptation to leave them in. They set perfectly! Frosting was amazing but I cut the confectioners suger in half."
"3","4","If they were a little less fudgy they would be perfect! Awesome flavour though."
"3","5","Excellent. The only change I made was the honey in the frosting...the frosting needs moisture, so I used milk instead. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!"
"3","5","beautiful!"
"3","5","These are delicious! They kind of taste like a mixture of chocolate cake & brownies to me. I doubled the recipe and brought them into an office of 10-15 people, and they were gone in no time!"
"3","5","These are now my go-to brownie recipe and have permanently replaced MMM...brownies in my file! These are PERFECT fudgey yet cakey brownies that just melt in your mouth! I top with 'chocolage ganache' by INGRIDEVOGEL and these are hands down the best brownies ever."
"3","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever tried. There will be no need to try another one as this is a KEEPER!!!! Excelent Angie, thanks so much :-))"
"3","4","Just made...Did not make frosting...Great flavor!!! They did sink in the middle, never had that happen before!!! Still great eating!!!"
"3","5","These are the best brownies my family and I have ever had! Much better than store bought and barely lasted the day!"
"3","3","I am giving these three stars because my daughter and her friend ate them. I am sorry but cocoa without chocolate just does not make a tasty brownie. Texture was good...flavor was not."
"3","5","These brownies are the best-- everywhere I take them, they're always one of the first plates emptied! The frosting problem is solved by melting 3.5 T of butter and then adding everything else. I also have found that my family prefers them when made with margarine, for some reason they're fudgier!"
"3","4","Now, I did not make the frosting, so this is on the brownies alone. I followed directions (minus frosting) & got a nice, chocolately, cake-type brownie. I prefer my brownies fudgier with a richer chocolatey taste to them, thus the 4 stars. Since the other reviews I've read that claim this as a fudgy type brownie all mention the frosting, I will try one more time with the frosting & let you know how it goes."
"3","4","I didnt give this 5 stars because I had to add milk to frosting...otherwise these were SOOO good!!!!!"
"3","4","Four stars because I didn't make the frosting, but this is my new stand-by Brownie recipe. Very rich."
"3","5","This is my EXACT brownie recipe and I've been using it for years....so quick and easy to make (never use the frosting). We don't use the butter though, instead we use 1/2 cup of coconut oil....makes delicious brownies!!!"
"3","5","I always read many reviews before I set out to try a new recipe on allrecipes. I was surprised to see a few 1 star ratings, where most were 5 star! obviously, the reviewers who gave this recipe 1 star did something wrong. brownies are easy to mix together, but you have to be careful baking them. just 1 minute of overbaking will kill that chewy brownie texture we all crave! you should pull out your brownies even though they may look underdone. remember, they will still bake for a few minutes once you take them out of the oven. as for the icing, for those who found it unspreadable, all you need to do is add a very small amount of liquid to icing sugar to turn it into icing. I added about 1 tsp of milk and it was perfectly spreadable. this is a great recipe if you do it right!"
"3","4","Fantastic brownie! So fudgy and moist but crispy on the outside. I made these for a bribe(tee hee) but the only reason for 4 stars is the frosting. I didn't like it as much as i thought i would. I will definately use the brownie recipe but probably not the frosting. Thankyou!"
"3","5","Husband's fave. Very good. Used Sunday Fudge Cake frosting recipe from Cake Mix Doctor Chocolate book."
"3","5","Amazing brownies! I added about 2 tablespoons of rum to the frosting and added about 1/4 more confectioners sugar, then I crushed white and milk chocolate chips up and sprinkled them over the top of the frosting. Delicious!!!"
"3","5","No need to buy boxed brownies anymore. One reviewer said not to overmix it b/c it made brownies too cake-like. She was right, but be sure to mix it enough to get all the lumps out."
"3","5","These were great brownies and very easy to whip up! I had a craving for brownies and had everything right in my pantry..35 minutes later I was eating a delicious brownie! I will def be making these again and maybe with a peanut butter fudge frosting! They were even better the next day. When I first tried them, about 5 minutes out of the oven, I did think they were cakey, but later that night and the next morning they were perfectly chewy and fudgey..just the way I like them!"
"3","5","These are great brownies. I baked them in a muffin pan for 18 minutes and they came out perfectly. Frosted with peanut Butter frosting. Yum!"
"3","2","I feel like I must have done something wrong here, even though I followed the directions to the letter. The brownies themselves tasted good, although they were extremely cake-like and crumbly--they fell apart when I tried to serve them.  The frosting was something of a disaster. I made it in my Kitchenaid. For a minute or so it was just powder/crumbles, then it slowly started to combine into an extremely thick paste that was, out of the bowl, completely unspreadable even on warm brownies. My butter was definitely soft, but I wonder if it would have been better if I had started with it melted? I finally dumped it all straight on the brownies and let it sit there until it was soft enough to spread, but even then it wasn't really 'right.'  I could possibly tweak this and make these better next time, but I will probably just try another recipe instead. The brownies tasted all right, but they didn't blow my mind enough to want to make me want to try to perfect the recipe."
"3","5","My boyfriend and I ate the whole pan in one day! We loved their texture and taste. They beat any brownie mix! I chose to bake them for 27 min. I think I will try to bake them for a few minutes less next time to see if they are fudgier, but this is a keeper! My boyfriend says, 'They are a five-star!'"
"3","4","Perfect flavor. Halved recipe - cooked for only 15 minutes. After reading the other reviews, did not make topping."
"3","4","Very good brownies. Not great, nowhere near the best, but they'll do in a pinch. =) They're good enough that they don't need the frosting. They're definitely not 'cake squares'--they're definitely brownies, moist and fudgy. Don't overmix, don't overbake, don't substitute or change the recipe and they'll come out as they should."
"3","5","These are people-pleasing brownies! Slightly fudgy, slightly cakey, soft with a hard top, just the right amount of chocolatey. Yum! Will def make again. No need for frosting! And I lowered butter to 6 Tbl and it was just fine."
"3","5","These are fab.. I didnt have honey so I used maple syrup and I also added some sliced up almonds..they are sinfully good..defo be making these chewy little slices of heaven again."
"3","3","I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 and baked for 30 minutes. The brownies were nice and fudgy but left WAY too much butter residue on the bottom of the pan. I had to blot the bottoms before frosting and plattering them. Delicious, anyway."
"3","5","Loved it! Favorite brownies so far and I've tried many. It was so rich and chocolatey! There's really no need for the frosting."
"3","5","Made brownies only, not frosting. YUM!! This is a keeper. Moist and delicious."
"3","5","I followed the advice of others in the following ways:  brownies 1) mix by hand (don't overmix) 2) beat eggs lightly before adding to mix  frosting 1) halve the powdered sugar 2) melt the butter 3) spread on while the brownies are still warm  Everyone's response to my brownies was, 'These are the BEST brownies.' Appropriately named, and, yes, the consistency is a hybrid of brownie, fudge, and cake, and I think it's an excellent consistency for brownies."
"3","5","Delicious and chewy, just the way I like them. I cut the frosting down as it was more than I needed, but overall, absolutely wonderful."
"3","5","my family loved them and they were super quick and easy"
"3","5","Wonderful brownies! Instead of sugar, I used 1/2 cup of Splenda and 1/2 cup of honey. The icing is absolutely delicious! I will definitely these make again! Thanks!"
"3","5","This is our family's regular brownie recipe - only I increase the flour to 3/4 cup to suit our tastes. Have been making these for years - I think the recipe orginally came from Hershey's. They are not a dark, fudgy brownie, but this is the way we like them and I will only eat them frosted!"
"3","5","Thank you Angie for this super EASY, YUMMY. one pan (except for icing bowl) brownie recipe. As advised I HAND mixed ingredients - gently mixing the eggs before adding. Lowered the oven temp 25 degrees F using a metal pan and watched like a hawk cause oven temps vary! Cooked for 23 mins - probably will do 20 mins next time to make a little more fudgey. Used a bit more cocoa being a chooholic. As Angie recommended frost brownies while warm . . . .& DON'T be concerned if the frosting seems dry while mixing - keep on mixing, warm a little before icing & it turns out perfectly - FABULOUS!"
"3","5","Delicious recipe! Wasn't difficult to make and came out light and chewy. Only slight changes I made was to add a tad more cocoa powder, and substitute half the amount of butter with margarine. The trick to not make it too cake-like is to not overmix the batter. Give all the ingredients a good whisk but don't over do it.  Great recipe!"
"3","3","Okay, I didn't make the frosting, so this review is only for the cakey part. I mixed it with the beater as a person suggested to make it fudgier, but they weren't chocolatey enough for me. Next time, I might add more cocoa powder."
"3","4","I gave this a 4 because of the frosting. I tried the recipe as is but the frosting was so thick and crumbly and wasn't mixing together. I then added about 2 tablespoons of milk and it turned out much better. The honey was a bit strong too so I would cut that in half next time. The brownies were good, not too cake like and not too fudge like. Overall a good recipe and will make it again with the couple of changes to the frosting."
"3","4","These came out less fudgy & more cakey for me. They were dubbed 'brownie cake' by my boys. They were delicious! Easy to make & I especially like the smaller size."
"3","1","The batter was good, but when baked...not so much. They look fudgie and dense in the picture and turn out cakey. Not what I was expecting. I'm going to throw them out and find something else."
"3","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had! They were easy to make and a big hit at our house! I will definitely make these again. I would not make any changes to the recipe."
"3","5","WOW, Delicious! The name of this recipe fits very well. I will NEVER buy another boxed brownie mix again."
"3","5","it is sooo rich and absolutely not sickeninglt sweet. Add more cocoa powder for a richer chocolatey experience:D"
"3","5","Very tasty!! I especially liked the frosting. I don't usually use frosting but it was really good."
"3","5","I dont know why anyone thought these were cakey. Mine turned out dense and gooey with the edges chewy. Just how like them. I made them as stated in recipe with one exception. I added mint flavoring to my frosting. The frosting was thick and didnt spread well, so next time I will warm the frosting so i can pour it on top. My advice is to mix by hand. I would think that mixing it with a mixer would pump air in to the batter and make it cakey. Just a thought."
"3","5","Exellent! I added chocolate chips in the batter before I baked them and they are splendid!"
"3","5","Loved these!! I didn't change anything other then doubling the recipe to fit a 9x16, which I am glad I did cause they are so good =) I ended up cooking mine for 35min..perfect, never buy a box again."
"3","5","These are the best brownies I have made. They are awesomely fudgey and decadent!! I add semi-sweet chocolate chips and milk chocolate chunks too."
"3","2","too chocolately"
"3","3","I followed this recipe exactly and was somewhat disappointed. It tasted like a standard brownie that was a little cakey. Unfortunately, the frosting was way too sweet."
"3","5","These are the best brownies I've ever made in my life. I was a huge fan of boxed brownie mix, I will never buy another! If you don't want cakey brownies, don't overmix them. These are superb! Thank you so much for sharing this!"
"3","5","DELICIOUS!!! I usually don't like homemade brownies, but I was out of the boxed kind so I decided to try these and sooo glad I did. Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not do the frosting. They do not need the frosting, but maybe I will try it in the future. I have made these twice in 3 days. Thank you, Angie. P.S. I did melt my butter in the microwave, and then just added everything else. NOT cakelike in the least. For the people who said that, maybe you overbaked or over mixed them."
"3","5","Amazing. Tried with and without frosting. Much better without"
"3","4","I had a mission to make these non-dairy. I used Earth Balance (the sticks) instead of butter, and added a splash of soy silk creamer when I thought things looked too thick re: batter and icing. I was afraid of over cooking this, since at 30 minutes in a 7 7/8 Alum. pan- my middle was still gooey. I took it out after 35/40 minutes, glazed it, waited a bit and finished off the icing making sure to get the edges more thickly. It turned out fine, the middle more gooey, but baked."
"3","5","Update: Made these again, true to the recipe and they were fantastic! No frosting, but I did add mini chocolate chips to the top when I took them out of the oven. Only baked for about 20 minutes in a glass dish and they are super moist - not gooey, but an excellent texture and flavor. Original: These brownies are OK, but not the best. They're a little too cakey for my liking. I had to sub dairy-free, soy-free spread for the butter, but I haven't found that to cause problems in my other recipes, so I don't think it had any effect on the outcome. I skipped the topping, since hubby is a purist when it comes to brownies. I probably won't make these again, but will continue to look for a good recipe that I can modify to be dairy and soy free."
"3","4","Very good! My son and husband loved them! I added 1 cup of chocolate chips, yum yum!"
"3","5","These deserve a 10 star rating. These were the best brownies I have ever made. They turned out moist and chewy. I followed the directions as written using Gheridelli Cocoa powder except that I didn't make the icing since I don't care for it on Brownies. I will make these again in the future. The best part is that they were so easy my 4 year old was able to help me make them. No more store bought brownies for me."
"3","5","Fantastic!! I doubled the batch and it was gone within hours!!"
"3","5","Wonderful Recipe! I doubled the ingredients (except the egg and salt, as suggested by another reviewer), and baked for 5 minutes in a 9by13 pan. Excellent, dense, sweet, and chewy brownies!"
"3","5","These turned out perfectly first go. I didn't frost them though, I just stuck Smarties on top. They're crisp on the outside and fudgey on the inside. I doubled the recipe for a 9' x 13' tin, but took the advice of a reviewer and used one less egg (ie, 3), and the same amount of salt as the original recipe."
"3","5","I've made anniversary cakes, cakes for themed parties, can bake many things, but brownies have always been a thorn in my flesh, until I found this recipe. (I couldn't even get boxed brownies to come out). I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly, just as the submitter said they would. Finally, I can make brownies! I'm a prisoner no longer!!!! Thanks for submitting this recipe."
"3","5","These brownies were wonderful. I'm only reviewing the brownie recipe since I didn't use the frosting. I followed the recipe exactly and stirred this in the same pan with a wooden spoon without beating it and my brownies came out very fudgy. Thanks for an easy, go-to brownie recipe."
"3","5","This was the first time I made brownies without a box. I would never have thought it was as easy as it was to make them. The recipe makes a very thin brownie so you may want to double it. I mixed the frosting toward the end of the baking cycle and then put put it in the microwave for a few minutes to soften it up. I was able to spead a thing layer of icing on the brownie and it looked very professional."
"3","4","This is chocolate cake, not brownies. It tastes pretty good though! Fluffy, chocolatey goodness. And the best part is the cocoa. Easy!"
"3","3","3.5 stars. Not bad, but not 'the best'. A little on the dry side and not nearly as creamy-rich and fudgy as I would have liked. These are helped along greatly, though, by the fudge-like icing which was the best part of this brownie recipe."
"3","5","4.5 Stars These are really good! I really liked the icing and I think its what makes the brownies soo good. I thought they were a little thin but still amazing. Next time I will double the recipe."
"3","3","This was NOT the best i have ever had it was actually pretty bad the batter tasted like butter and they wee too bland and cakey DO NOT MAKE."
"3","5","Awesome....I don't use the frosting, perfect without!!!"
"3","5","Awesome recipe, I will definitely make these again. I altered the recipe slightly because I was looking for a way to use up a couple ripe bananas I had. So, instead of using 1/2 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup mashed ripe bananas. The brownies still came out like regular brownies but with a chocolate banana flavor."
"3","5","I have been looking for a yummy brownie recipe for awhile and alas I found it! I have made these a few times now - once exactly as the recipe states, once making a single batch omitting the icing, once doubling the recipe, omitting the icing, and once doubling the recipe with the icing...whew! (Hubby loves the icing, I prefer without!) I have found that no matter which way you make them, they beat a box brownie ANYDAY! Also, note that if you double the recipe, it will yield a 'cakier' texture. Single batches are more 'fudgier'. These are a keeper!"
"3","5","I made the recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out wonderful! I only cooked them 15 minutes and they came out a tiny bit underdone, but that's how I prefer them -- more fudgy rather than cake-like. Delicious! I did use an electric beater on low to mix everything together for about 30 seconds or a minute. I didn't make the frosting. YUM!!"
"3","4","Really great brownie recipe made from scratch!"
"3","5","WOW!!! ok, they are a bit chewy but whether they are fudgy or not, the taste will still be the same..and thats all that matters in the end!! THE TASTE, PEOPLE!! I made mine in a 9in square pan so they came out to a bit over 1/2 an inch thick..I added 3/4 of a cup semi sweet chocolate chips which add a great real chocolatey flavor instead of just a cocoa flavor..and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top...thay came out amazing..I rate the recipe 5 stars but rate mine 6=) and I am extremely picky when it comes to brownies..if you like your brownies more fudgy, just put less flour...but try the original recipe first and then tweak it..I am about to make another batch..except this time I'm going to make more batter...not doubling..just making 24 servings in the same 9 in square pan so they come out thicker..so I will add 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to this batch..also, I did not make the frosting. I don't like frosting and don't need the extra calories..oh..I only bakes mine for 22 min and it came out perfect..I inserted a toothpick in the middle and when it came out almost clean, I took the brownies out of the oven because they will continue to bake once you take them out(until they cool)..so much for all my kickboxing classes this entire week=) so worth it!!! UPDATE..just made the the next batch..24 servings in a 9in pan for 27 min and not a sec. longer..these are just a tad under an inch thick(perfect) and very fudgy! First batch got a bit hard once they cooled..not these!=)"
"3","5","I love so much about this recipe. I love that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand. I love that you only have to use one bowl. I love that it doesn't make a massive amount of brownies. I love that the brownies are thin and fudgy. Most of all, I love that the brownies taste FABULOUS. I didn't flour the pan, just sprayed it well with butter cooking spray, and not one crumb of brownie stuck to the pan. Took mine out at 20 minutes and they were perfect. Added a small amount of milk to the frosting. The frosting really puts these over the top, but they don't need it. Next time, if I frost them, I'll only use maybe half of the frosting for a thin layer. This recipe is a total keeper."
"3","5","these brownies were really good!! and although i didnt get to make the frosting to go along with the brownies, they were still good!! thank you alot chow chow"
"3","5","You bet they're the BEST! This recipe was featured on Christian Radio Air One as the best Super Bowl dessert to make! I swirled into the batter a batch of cheese cake filling just before baking it all. UMMMMYUMMMMM!!!!!!!"
"3","5","Like most people, I've made many brownies throughout my life so far; boxed and from scratch. These were tasty and easy to make. Like another reviewer, I did as little stirring as possible (counted 20 strokes) so they wouldn't end up like cake. That meant I beat my eggs before adding them to the saucepan to make sure they were well mixed in. They weren't too dense or crumbly like some end up either. I did add coarsely chopped walnuts because we love them with nuts. I didn't make the frosting, it doesn't need it. It's rich enough without it. This is going to be my regular brownie recipe now. Thanks!"
"3","5","I am speechless. These were wonderful. I added 1 T extra cocoa and am glad I did. My family inhaled these as soon as they came out of the oven. I am glad I didn't make more. It would have not been pretty in my house :)"
"3","5","I was looking for a brownie recipe and this was perfect! One thing though, I didnt have any cocoa powder so I used chocolate chips instead and then cut the sugar to 3/4 C. I probably could have even cut it to only a half cup. Either way, they were sweet, chocolatey and VERY rich!!!! This one's a keeper. Thanks :-)"
"3","5","I used half white sugar and half brown only because I ran out of white and the brownies were delicious! I also used less than half the amount of confectioner's sugar for the frosting and I heated it before spreading over the still warm brownies. As per another reviewers advice, I let cool and then cut with a plastic knife. perfect cuts!"
"3","4","Really easy to make. Followed the recipe to the T rather than halving the confectioners sugar in the frosting. Thank you!!"
"3","3","Nice tasting, the family liked it but I didn't think it was a 'great' brownie IMO (and I know lots of people disagree with me judging by all the 5star reviews). I have a very similar old recipe which omits salt and baking powder and uses 3/4 cups of flour, I like mine better. Unlike others I won't rate a recipe 5 stars if I modify it. It is however not a bad recipe and very quick to make. Mine didn't turn out cakey at all (I did not beat the eggs), but a little bit too fudgy. If you like your brownies very fudgy, this could be for you. We also didn't frost the recipe."
"3","5","These brownies were great! Gone in 5 minutes flat, people starting eating them before they could even cool! Tips- Add a tbsp water to the frosting"
"3","5","I could eat the batter by its self. It mixed up and tasted just like an amazing chocolate buttercream. I couldn't help lick the bowl! Once baked they were heaven in a pan! I topped them with peanut butter frosting and it made for an amazing desert! I will say if your brownies are coming out cake like you are over mixing. You want to whip all the ingredients together, except the flour, then carefully fold it in, just enough to mix. Also try doubling the vanilla and make sure you are using a dutch process cocoa and not cheap Hershey's stuff. You'll taste the difference for sure."
"3","4","I made these with dark cocoa powder and frosted with peanut butter buttercream. Much better than a peanut butter cup"
"3","5","I just made these and they are sooooo good! I hand stirred the ingredients as other reviewers suggested, and these were not cake-like all. I put them in a 9x13 pan instead for thinner brownies and drizzled them with the 'Chocolate Syrup' by Zen K. on this website. 5 stars all the way!"
"3","5","You have to be pretty sure of yourself to call a recipe the BEST-- but these brownies earn it! They are super moist, and the frosting is perfect on them. (If you mix the powdered sugar in a 1/4 cup at a time and make sure the butter is super softened before you start, you should have no problems getting it to the right consistency.) I actually left out one egg, since I like my brownies chewy rather than cakey-- and they were still out of this world, although probably thinner than they would be otherwise. My husband barely looked up from eating it, and said just the word 'Perfect' with a mumble. As for me, I wonder if the leftovers will last until he gets home from work today? Thanks for the recipe, and my gym membership thanks you, too! :P"
"3","5","We just made these, and they are SCRUMPTIOUS! I doubled the recipe (only used 3 eggs, and kept salt at 1/4 tsp) as suggested by another reviewer. Baked them in a 13 x 9 pan for 35 minutes. They came out just right - not too fudgy as some box mixes are, but not too cakey. They were absolutely perfect. I mixed them by hand as well - being sure not to overmix. We did not frost them, as my kids prefer brownies without frosting. This will be my brownie recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"3","4","Excellent brownies. I followed some suggestions- hand mix (don't overmix) and for the frosting I melted the butter & used half the sugar and more cocoa powder. Also added some cinnamon to the frosting. Delicious and very chocolatey!"
"3","5","These have a rich chocolately flavor without being overly sweet. Just add a bit of vanilla ice cream while these are still warm and enjoy!"
"3","5","Melt-in-your-mouth AMAZING! Thank you, Angie! These were incredible, and, so easy to make! We beat by hand (rather than with a beater) the chocolate mixture, which we felt would keep the texture chewy and crumbly (rather than tough). And, we didn't make the frosting. These brownies were the perfect mixture of sweet, rich, (but not too rich), and crumbly (while holding together). We made them in minutes, with minimal ingredients (but, used very good unsweetened chocolate: Ghirardelli's), and couldn't stop eating them! 10 Stars!"
"3","5","This was the perfect brownie, not too cakey, not too fudgey! Better then the box mix and just as easy."
"3","5","OH MY...these are delightful brownies! We didn't find them too sweet at all..but I chose not to frost them. They are moist without being gooey, and stay together nicely without being too cakey. Really a perfect brownie. I would definitely recommend them and will be using this as my 'go-to' recipe for quick and easy basic brownies from now on!"
"3","5","These brownies are by far the best brownies I have ever tasted. They are moist and rich and perfect! The honey in the frosting is an excellent touch!"
"3","5","I have been cooking for 10 years and this is my brownie recipe. It is THE most robust, simplest, no-fuss, no-muss recipe, EVER. And the brownies are amazing. Every bit as fast as using a box, but you get to control what goes into it. I'd give it ten stars if I could! Angie, whoever you are and wherever you are, thank you!"
"3","5","These Brownies are delicious and easy to make. They are not Cake like at all but nice and fudgy. Overmixing the batter will cause the brownies to be cake like. For fudgey brownies just use a wooden spoon to stir the flower into the batter. DO NOT OVERMIX ! ! !"
"3","5","This is a super easy recipe for beginners just stepping away from boxed mix.It's also a handy quick dessert when you want something sweet NOW. I skipped the honey in the frosting because Mr Bear was empty. I just used some milk.I've noticed that some people had a bad result with this recipe.With small batch recipes,egg size matters,melted versus boiling butter matters and PLEASE mix your brownies by hand(as others have said) or you will be unhappy."
"3","5","Amazing! Followed the recipe exactly. Made sure I only gently mixed the batter. My almost 3-year-old son did a happy dance after eating them because they tasted so good!"
"3","4","I dont know how you can fail with this recipe which is by far the easiest I have ever seen when it comes to dessert! This is a great base for your brownies. I made it as is, but will try to improve with some nuts, chocolate chips or caramel. I didnt add the frosting and I dont think I will because it is sweet enough, maybe I will even try with a little less sugar next time... Thank you!"
"3","5","The first time I tried it as per recipe and though they were rated highly by my husband with his extreme sweet tooth. I on my part thought it could do with a bit more of the chocolate flavour. So the next time I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup and loved the results (though hubby obviously was partial to the original)So now this recipe is baked in our house in both its variations. I also like to eliminate the honey at times, though admittedly the icing looses some of its sheen as a result thereof. As far as the texture, the gooeyness and fudgyness are concerned, this one totally rules as long as you remember not to overbake."
"3","5","Without a doubt! The absolute best. I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan. (glass) Don't skip the frosting, but it's easier to put on after the brownies cool for about 10 to 15 minutes, but when they're still warm. Added walnuts and didn't mix to long. (by hand)"
"3","2","NOVACAT2003... You couldn't be more accurate. What the heck did I do wrong, when other reviewers are getting fudgey goodness? I didn't get even close to that - it was all cake. I HAND MIXED everything, so I know that wasn't the problem. As a cake, it's alright but I didn't want cake. I wanted ooey gooey fudgey brownies."
"3","4","These brownies were definitely very good, even without the frosting, which would have made them too sweet. However, they aren't fudgey. They were somewhere between fudgey and cake-like. I did all the things everyone recommended (beat the eggs separately and fold in, stir by hand rather than using the mixer, stir the ingredients as little as possible, skip the baking powder, etc). And they were definitely good, but if you want a truly fudgey recipe, you should keep looking. If you are okay with a non-fudgey recipe, these may be just what you are looking for!"
"3","4","I think they were great. Instead of trying to tweak it the first time around according to other people's recommendations, I tried the recipe (almost) as is. The only thing that I did differently, which I don't think makes that much of a difference is that I used 1/4 of butter (i strive for low fat) and no baking powder (i feared it would make them cakier than I prefer.) I melted the butter in the microwave, for convenience sake. I think people are so displeased with this recipe because they are melting the butter and then using cold eggs. Cold eggs surely changes the consistency!!! Not fudgy and delicious, but cakey and dry. I filled a bowl up with warm water and put the eggs in it for about 1 minute. Makes a huge difference. Also, I made sure not to overbake them, like it says int eh recipe (baked them for about 21 minutes). I didn't make the frosting becasue I was impatient, but I thought the brownies didn't need it. They were delicious!"
"3","5","HI i'm a 8 year old boy. This brownie is sooooo good, every one in the whole world should eat this wonderful thing. I baked it myself."
"3","5","I made them without the frosting. They're quick, easy and exactly what I was looking for. (only one saucepan to clean!) I think they're perfect for when one needs an instant brownie fix."
"3","2","If you've ever wished for a recipe for frosted fudge, this recipe is for you. I've tried this recipe twice because I couldn't believe how un-brownie like my first batch turned out. I definitely preferred my second batch because I halved the powdered sugar for the frosting. Still, this recipe is not what I would recommend if you are looking to make traditional brownies. I look for a brownie to have at least somewhat of a cake-like texture vice pure chocolate fudge. Very easy to make, so definitely worth a try."
"3","5","Oh my goodness these are GOOD! I am a major chocoholic and was dying for some brownies. Im eating them now hot out of the oven and am in heaven!!! Thank you thank you for posting a true brownie recipe. NOT CAKEY because I mixed everything by hand and not too much. Don't let the air get in if you cant stand light fluffy brownies. These are so moist and chocolatey. Im drooling trying to type this. I doubled the recipe but forgot to double the baking powder (most reviewers say not to add it at all in most brownie recipes I saw)I didnt double the salt either (you wouldnt want to do that) What else can I say? These are the perfect brownies. Great name for this recipe.  PS I DIDNT MAKE THE FROSTING>> DONT HAVE TO! They are so sweet and delicious as is. Maybe one day when I have confectioners sugar I'll try it to compare but I am one happy lady right now and needed this comfort chocolate tonight :)"
"3","5","This brownie recipe is a hit! Everyone who eats them loves them! I only cook them for 20 minutes and they turn out perfect. I add an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder, two tablespoons of milk, and melted butter to the frosting. The extra cocoa powder makes it a little less sugary sweet. So good!"
"3","5","Reading the reviews...yes they are very 'cakelike' however, the taste is great and the texture and moisture are great. It is strange how much review hostility for the 'not real brownies' is a bit extreme. Chill the fudge out-no pun intended."
"3","5","I changed the recipe in this way: substitute 3/4 cup agave nectar for 1c sugar, increase flour to 3/4 cup, lower temp to 325, bake 32 minutes. Agave will keep your blood sugar normal if you're diabetic. It's a great recipe!"
"3","5","Really good fudge brownies - not cakey at all, followed the recipe, didn't use the frosting."
"3","5","BEST BROWNIE I HAVE EVER MADE OR ATE!"
"3","4","These were good but a little too cakey for me...I like my brownies fudgy and chewey."
"3","5","omg- so good. whenever friends comeover i make them. im gonna go make some now. u know what's really good on top of them? when u mix 8 oz cream cheese, then beat in 1/2 c powdered sugar, then add 1/2 c raspberry/strawberry preserves. omg- u have no idea."
"3","5","These are word for word from Hershey's but if they hadn't posted here I wouldn't have found it. They are great! Don't overbake! The frosting, a lot of people said they had trouble with, check out hershey's website... corn syrup and a little milk were added for spredding consistency and the frosting really made it delish! Highly recommend!"
"3","5","These really are the best brownie if you like fudgy brownies, which we do. And so convenient - I always have these ingredients on hand -I think the topping is what makes these so special. Only recommendation: double the recipe - a single batch is just not enough! Also, if the topping seems to be too dry to spread, just pour in a tiny bit of milk to make it spread-friendly."
"3","5","I am new to cooking and found this recipe definitely very easy to make and even more delicious!the best part is the use of cocoa powder rather than chocolate squares! i follwed the recipe exactly as directed,though made it in a 7inch pan,and the cme out perfect,even looked exactly like the picture given.however,could somebody tell me if this is as much as they are supposed to rise?i mean arnt they a little thin?or is that how they are supposed to be?pleae let me know! :)"
"3","5","Wonderful taste and easy to make! If you like your brownies cake-like, use 2 eggs as recommended. I used 1 since I prefer my brownies fudgier. If you want them to look more like the store bought mix brownies, use the butter to vegetable oil substitution recommended on this site."
"3","5","A fantastic brownie. Yummy! It's great to find a good brownie recipe that isn't loaded with oil. Definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","These brownies are delicious. Instead of using the chocolate glaze, I took 1/2 cup PB with a little butter melted it together and swirled it into the brownie mix, right before cooking. Really Good! Def... double the recipe, it only makes a 16 really small squares."
"3","5","OMG!!!! I searched all my cookbooks and magazines looking for an easy 'from scratch brownie recipe' that called for unsweetened cocoa powder rather than baking chocolate (baking squares). I tried this recipe last night, and these were by far THE BEST BROWNIES EVER!!!  The recipe is so easy and comes together very nicely.  I didn't feel like melting the butter on the stove, so I used my big Pyrex mixing bowl and melted the butter in the microwave. I then added just the sugar until it was combined, and added the 2 eggs and vanilla extract. I mixed that up real good, and then added just the cocoa powder. I used a wooden spoon to mix this all together and then slowly added the flour, salt and baking powder. (I mixed the 'dry ingredients' minus the cocoa powder in a separate bowl first before adding it to the batter). I made sure that I scraped down the sides of the bowl a couple of times to get all the loose flour and cocoa mixed in before I poured it into a 9x7 greased pan. (I couldn't find my 8x8) These took about 30 minutes on 350 to bake. Once they cooled a bit, I cut them into squares and made up Brownie Sundaes with Cookies & Cream Ice Cream. They were so yummy!!! Even my picky boyfriend loved these brownies. They are not too fudgey & not at all cake like. They are the perfect brownie!!!!"
"3","5","beyond belief!!! I cover them with foil as I let them cool to keep the moister in the result was fantastic. Thank you"
"3","5","These are soo good! I make these when I am really pressed for time, and they are ALWAYS perfect. These are good with chocolate cream cheese icing also. Otherwise I just have them plain... Soo delicious!!!!"
"3","4","These have great flavor, turned out fudgy (the way I like brownies best). My only issue was the frosting. I think the 1 cup called for in the recipe is probably not correct. I'm thinking probably 1/2 a cup would be perfect. I put the confectioner's sugar in 1/4 cup at a time and by the time I put in 3/4 cup it was way stiff. I had to patiently put the frosting on the hot brownies letting the heat melt it some so it was easier to spread. Next time I make these, it will be with only 1/2 cup confectioners sugar."
"3","5","Truly the best crossroads brownie ever!  I don't bother with the frosting and take peanut butter, cream cheese, butter and sugar, beat them together and swirl them into the brownies for baking. I've made it this way 5 times in the last couple of months. I made my mother-in-law swoon!"
"3","5","These brownies were delectable! I put an extra half-cup of butter [who cares if it's fat, and all that!] and they were SO moist. Splendid recipe and I recommend anyone to try it because they're really easy. Having everything mixed in one pot really lessens the cleaning! Word of warning: let the butter cool before you add eggs, or they'll cook."
"3","5","Fantastic Fudgy Brownies! These are so the best brownies! They are so much better than a 'box mix'. I doubled the entire recipe, adding 1 cup chopped pecans, and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, put it in a 9 x 13' pan and baked at 350 for 25 min. Once they cooled, they were perfect. I cannot say enough good things about these brownies! The proof is in the ratings! Thanks!"
"3","5","These are by far the Best Brownies!!! The only things I changed were, I reduced the temperature to 325F to avoid the edges burning, and my pan was larger so they were done in 25 mins instead of 35 mins. I omitted the honey in the frosting, and instead used 2% milk to bring it to spreading consistancy. AWESOME!!!!! I will never make another brownie recipe again! Thanks"
"3","5","These were fantastic, even without the frosting. I like my brownies on the fudgier side so I baked them for about 22 min (instead of 25-30). I also added 1 tbsp MORE cocoa powder."
"3","4","These were ok, but not the best. Watch the cook time on these. Mine were done in 20 minutes...any longer and they would have been too done."
"3","5","I used canola oil instead of butter to help cut down on the cholesterol and whole wheat flour since it is disguised by chocolate no ones the difference. This receipe is delicious! I added in walnuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips just because I love choclate. I also never cook my brownies in a pan because I think there is way to much clean up involved - instead I just cook them in a cup cake pan w/ liners. Absolutely no clean up and all of the pieces are already portioned out."
"3","5","Mmmm... excellent! Very quick and easy. They are your definitive 'brownies' - dense and rich - not too cakey but not gooey either - just perfect!"
"3","5","I will never use box mix again. These brownies are richer and just darn better- thanks!!"
"3","5","Super simple, and WOW! AWSOME!!!! I think next time I make them (and there will be many next times) I will double the batch, it is a small batch recipe, none went to waste thats for sure. They stayed amazingly soft, even the edges! Thanks so much for sharing this one!"
"3","5","I love this recipe. I've been serving it at my restaurant and the public loves it! I added toasted walnuts to make it even more Ultimate and serve it w/ vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Delicious."
"3","4","a bit too much better in my taste, but with a bit more cocoa and a bit less butter, this recipe is GREAT!"
"3","1","I give this recipe no stars.. the worst brownie recipe on earth... I dont know how you can call that extremely buttery terribly chocolatey stone hard piece of junk a brownie!! it was such a mess I had guests over and they were expecting brownies but they got butterd jawbreakers."
"3","5","These were amazing! I made them for my boyfriend since he loves brownies, and since he loves caramel I poured 2/3 of the recipe in the pan, let it bake five minutes, and poured a caramel sauce (1/3 cup condensed milk and a package of caramels) on top, then poured the other 1/3 of the mixture on top and swirled it and baked it the remaining time. Absoulutely delicious!"
"3","3","I hate em. My husband loves them. Someone said this recipe is the one on the Fry cocoa container. It is close but not quite. I prefer Fry's version a little thicker. 1 1/3 cup flour, 1 tsp b.powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 1 cup Fry's cocoa, 4 eggs, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 cup nuts (optional) Bake 30-35 minutes at 350."
"3","5","These brownies are AMAZING!! Definately the best homemade brownies I have ever had! Hubby and kids love them :o) I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 applesauce instead of a 1/2 cup butter(I always try to make recipes a little healthier,lol). I also cut the sugar down from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. Other than that, everything the same. For the frosting, there may not be enough liquid to make it get as creamy as it should(happened to me the second time I made it). If it happens, just add a few tablespoons of milk. It will perk right up, yummy as ever! Thanks so much for this recipe. It is very easy and is now the new brownie recipe in my home!!  Update: I made these without the honey and extract in the frosting and they STILL taste wonderful! Happy eatings :op"
"3","4","My family loved these brownies; they ate half the pan in about 20 minutes! I am always skeptical when dealing with homemade brownies because you never really know if they are going to turn out. These did, and they tasted great, but I would make a few suggestions to anyone looking to use this recipe. First off, don't bother flouring the pan. Even though it seems minimal, the flour really detracts from the taste. Second: I took the brownies out after about 25 minutes to keep them from drying out. And finally, I added an extra TBS butter to the frosting (which is necessary if you make these!) to make the texture less chalky and to make the frosting more spreadable. Hope this helps!"
"3","5","Truly delicious. I followed the batter recipe exactly, but took the advice of a previous reviewer and halved the amount of sugar in the icing. I also melted the butter prior to mixing. At first, it appeared a little thick, but using a warmed spatula the finished icing ended up glossy and smooth."
"3","5","UNBELIEVABLE! I thought I made my mom's brownies when these first came out, and she always made hers out of a box! I have made these brownies tons of times and they truly do always turn out! I've made the suggested topping, however, you can also sprinkle powdered sugar on top or buy prepared vanilla frosting (both of which I have done). I bet a cream cheese frosting would be great too (I'll have to try that next!) I also like to add semi-sweet chocolate chips...peanut butter chips or mixed peanut butter and chocolate chips make the brownies even more irresistible! At Christmastime, there was a special edition raspberry-chocolate swirl chip that was sold...needless to say those were probably my favorite brownies I've made with this recipe! If you follow the recipe ingredients, about 1/4-1/2 a bag of chips is enough. When I add the chips, I don't put a topping on though."
"3","5","These are delicious! I will say I only used 1/2 cup of sugar for the frosting and that was PLENTY sweet for us. Unless you like things gaggingly sweet a full cup may be too much for you. I would add the sugar in increments until you reach the desired sweetness. The brownies were just right, very flavorful! Also, I used Blue Bonnet for butter and Nestle's cocoa. They worked great for this recipe. I will definitely be making these again!"
"3","5","I have made a lot of homemade brownies and this is by far the best. It doesn't sink in the middle and it doesn't get hard on the edges. It is chewy and cakey the best of both brownie worlds. Definately a keeper. I made it with out the frosting (I usually don't make frosting because it is too sweet) so I can't speak to that part of the recipe."
"3","5","These are AMAZING! They're so moist and chocolatey and dangerous. Because guess what I just had for dinner instead of healthy food. I made a couple of changes. I doubled the recipe. I added 1/4 cup of wheat germ, a handful of chocolate chips, and I increased the cocoa to 1 1/4c because I wanted to add booze. I added about 3/4 to 1 cup of booze. If you add alcohol, depending on what kind, you might need to decrease the sugar. I added coffee liqueur and amaretto so I cut back on the sugar. These turned out so well. I was a little worried because I hated the taste of the batter. But I'd done all the work so I baked them anyway. They ended up a tiny bit of dry crust on top and utterly moist on the middle. I'll making this often. I just wish I'd had nuts or raspberries for the batter."
"3","5","Chewy and Perfect"
"3","5","I have made these a few times and even my husband who does not like sweets will eat these. I did take some others advice and omitt the baking powder and added a bit more of the cocoa, and I also leave off the icing. Watch the baking time, that is the key to a moist, gooey brownie."
"3","5","Decadent and sinful! For chocolate lovers only! I doubled the recipe, added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts + 1 cup of milk chocolate chips, and baked in 9x13 in pan. I also cooked down some frozen red raspberries + 1/2 cup sugar, strained, then added enough to the frosting to yield a slightly tart raspberry flavor. This brownie is perfect with a BIG GLASS OF MILK!"
"3","3","I found this recipe again last night and decided to whip some up. Once I got started I realized I had made them before but couldn't remember what the previous problem was. As soon as I got to the frosting, I remembered. There is NO WAY this frosting will mix up without adding at least 3 teaspoons of milk (should have read the other reviews). Brownies were ok but not the best I've ever tasted. Really like a bigger batch."
"3","5","Turned out great making a half batch in a loaf pan- great for when you just want a little bit and want to go back on your diet the next day! :) Turned out great at 300 degrees for 30 minutes."
"3","5","Melt-in-your-mouth, moist, fudgy--these really are some of the best brownies; and the icing put them over the top. I didn't change a thing about the brownies; for the icing I added another 1/2 cup powdered sugar and a tablespoon or 2 of milk--it really does need a little milk. I iced them as soon as they came out of the oven. If you blob the icing on the hot brownies & let it sit for a few seconds, the icing will warm up enough to spread easily. Love the honey in the icing! Very good recipe...thanks Angie."
"3","4","ICING IS EXCELLENT!!! Do not use a sugar replacement."
"3","5","I had left over Christmas liquor, so I substituted the vanilla in the recipe for Galliano and added a couple of tablespoons of banana liquor in the frosting (it made it more spreadable as well). I also added about 1/4 cup each of butterscotch and chocolate chips and about 3/4 cup of walnuts to the brownie. YUM!"
"3","5","This was the best brownies recipe I have ever used! I have never had a brownie turn out like you would buy at a restuarant, these did! I was very impressed. I have made them several times over, and will continue to make them again and again!!  A quick idea for the people who didn't like them; maybe follow the recipe next time, and they won't turn out so bad, just an idea"
"3","5","FANTASTIC!!! Simply the best brownies I have ever made! For starters, why melt the butter on the stove and add to your dishes? I melted the butter in the microwave in the bowl I was mixing the batter in--that made this a one dish brownie. I doubled the recipe with the exception of leaving out one egg and used a 9 X 13 pan, which was just perfect. I did not frost them, but instead I added some mini peanut butter cup baking pieces in the batter and these baked up beautifully!! I will make these again and again!"
"3","5","These were Delicious! I did double the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 inch pan. You must add chopped walnuts it taste even better! I didn't use all of the icing because then it would have been way too much. Do make and do enjoy."
"3","4","Not bad. Chewy but a bit too dense for my liking. It was very sweet too."
"3","5","These consistently get me rave reviews! I've made them several times and they get eaten very quickly. I made one batch with whole wheat flour and they still turned out great, but with a bit of a nutty flavor. They also work well if you use Smart Balance in place of the butter."
"3","3","This brownie recipe is sooooo good, it's delish! I added some walnuts and added cinnamon like someone had suggested (not a good idea though). This had perfect consistency, nothing like cake. :::UPDATE::: WTF seriously the first time I made this, it was absolutely DIVINE!!! I've made it atleast 4-5 times after and it's come out too moist and way too soft believe it or not. I'm quite saddend. I followed the recipe to a tee and still no first time success! :("
"3","3","I made this twice - once with applesauce and once as written. The applesauce gave it a slightly spongey texture and the recipe version was almost like a block of fudge. Both were pretty good but a little too sweet (especially the one with applesauce) and, in my opinion, not the best brownies I've had. Even though I used unsweetened applesauce, the natural sweetness of the apples made the brownies too sweet."
"3","5","The best brownies I've ever tasted. I add a splash of milk to the glaze and that makes a grand difference. Dine on!"
"3","1","I followed specifications exactly. These brownies were dry and tasteless. I will NOT make these again. If you decide to try this recipe I would add some vegetable oil to give them more moisture. Also, the cook time needs to be more like 15-20 minutes, NOT 20-25 minutes. If you are looking for a fudgy recipe, this is NOT the recipe you want! The frosting, however, was great. I would use it again... just not with these brownies."
"3","5","i left out the baking powder and added chocolate chips plus a couple extra tablespoons of chocolate. A delicious, chewy, gooey brownie. It was great with ice cream. Mine needed to be baked for an extra few minutes, and it was still kind of gooey."
"3","5","These are THE most fabulous brownies I've ever tasted, but they certainly aren't the prettiest. I thought, I have to find a way to serve these in a way that they are as luscious looking as they taste. They are also very rich and some guests are turned off by that (not me!). The solution to both is serving a still warm 2' by 2' square with a small dab of sour cream in the corner and several thinly sliced strawberries fanned out across the piece. The strawberries cut down on the richness while mantaining the fantastic flavor, and the sour cream cuts down on the sweetness. I also love them with a scoop of vanilla on the side and a few strawberries in between. Awesome recipie!"
"3","5","Yummy!!Though it did taste a bit more like a chocolate cake rather than brownies. I was looking for something more like a moist-in-the-inside-but-crispy -on-the-outside kinda recipe.And this recipe isn't quite like that. The icing was great..and I skipped the honey cause I don't think it would taste good and I was right! Still, I think I'll make these again.Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","Moist and fudgy brownies! YUM! This recipe tastes amazing without any frosting. Be careful not to overcook these or they are not nearly as good. I also add a couple melted hersheys bars swirled through the mix :)"
"3","4","Good flavor, but we were not wowed by them. They were good."
"3","1","I'm not quite sure what I'm missing here. I followed the recipe exactly-and ended up tossing the entire batch. They were kind of dry and not brownie-like at all and just didn't taste THAT great. My 2.5 y/o even turned his nose up at them! The frosting...not sure what the deal was with that either- I think I'll stick with my Baker's Chocolate One-Bowl Brownies instead!"
"3","5","very sweet and chewy! I doubled the recipe and did it in a 9 x 13 pan. There seemed to be a lot of extra frosting."
"3","4","I made them today. I used soft brown sugar instead, and I  added a cup of bitter chocolate chips and a cup of chopped almond.  I like more sweetless but anyway I loved them so much!  I didn't make the frosty either though, I Served them with whipped fresh cream(non-sugar) and it came really good too."
"3","4","Excellent brownies! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan - got rave reviews! Will definitely make these again!"
"3","5","Took these to work and everyone raved about them. Did leave out the frosting though. Thanks for sharing!"
"3","3","I didn't follow exactly what the instructions said and probably over-mixed the batter. I made them as if I was making cookies and beat the butter and sugar together, then added one egg at a time, and then slowly added the sifted dry ingredients. I guess I should have read other reviews first that said to stir it with a plain old spoon. Maybe I will try this recipe again but prepare them properly."
"3","5","Yummy! Intense fudgy, chewy, brownie indulgence! I've been making the box mix forever, but no more! These have a much better flavor, and they're easy too. Plus there's no trans-fats or other yucky stuff. I'm sure the frosting for these is great, but I had a hankering for some maple, so I used the Maple Icing recipe from this site. The combination is soooo good!"
"3","5","These were absolutely wonderful. I've only made the twice, and both times they have turned out awesome! I was so used to boxed brownies, that the first piece I tried I thought it was a bit different...but after allowing them to cool, they become nice and dense. I made them last night and sprinkled the top with chopped walnuts...you can definitely put marshmallows, chocolate chips, nuts, m&m's...anything you want on top! I just sent this email to a friend, definitely a favorite in my book! Thanks KATYSAWDEN!"
"3","5","Not quite sure how other people's brownies came out cakey or dry. This was my first attempt at making brownies period. I doubled the recipe, followed a previous tip of blending the ingredients on high for a while until it became a nice thick mixture, baked it the full 30 minutes, and it came out so rich and moist and chocolatey! I added some chocolate chips to the icing too and it's just so delectable. This is a perfect recipe to satisfy a chocolate craving."
"3","5","Moist, chewy, with a fantastic icing! I made these for a baby shower, and ended up giving out the recipe to 7 people. I wouldn't change a thing, they're fab!"
"3","5","I grew up with Fudge-like, Thick and Chewy, Stick to your Ribs Brownies. To achieve that, following this recipe, simply omit one egg and bake at 300* for 45 min. Also great without the frosting. Mmmmm now that's a BROWNIE!"
"3","4","This was one of the better 'from scratch' brownie recipes I've ever tried...it was by far the most simple. Although the flavor was good there are a few changes that I will make in the future. I altered the recipe a little to begin with by adding 1/2 C brown sugar & 1/2 C white sugar as some other's suggested. I also added 1/2 C mini morsel chocolate chips (coated in cocoa), and 1 tsp Kahlua. These brownies were definitely fudgy which would be perfect if served warm with ice cream. However if you plan on eatting these on their own I would suggest a few things...maybe cutting down on the butter by about 1/3 (my brownies came out a tad greasy) and adding a 1/2 tsp more baking powder. I didn't make the icing with this batch."
"3","5","I was originally looking for a really 'fudgy' brownie. These are not fudgy, but are just as good. I will definately make again and this time try the brown sugar option."
"3","5","I have made this so many times I have lost count! Thank you for such a great recipe! It is great just out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream on it. Thanks again.  For those at high altitude...made as is it falls flat (but I love it that way, chewy chocolate). If you don't want it to fall, just add an additional egg. This keeps it a little more stable."
"3","5","OH MY GOD! Can you say diabetic shock? These are the best brownies this family has ever had. They are so rich and moist, and perfect. I did what other people did, I added a little milk to the frosting to make it spread easier. I think next time I am going to add an 8oz package of cream cheese to the frosting, so it will have less chocolate flavor, and I will add 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Thank you for this wonderful recipe."
"3","3","These brownies were good but the frosting was terrible. It didn't spread at all. I even had trouble after adding milk like others suggested. The frosting made them taste like processed store bought brownies. If I make them again, I'll probably just leave them plain or use a chocolate glaze. Sorry."
"3","3","My daughter and I made these together. If you like cake-textured brownies, then these are for you. I used a 9x13 bar pan, a smaller size would be better, as mine turned out pretty flat. I prefer more fudgy brownies."
"3","3","They're alright, but I wouldn't have put the 'Best' title on them. The 1st set were a bit dry. The 2nd were a bit moister after adding an additional egg yolk, but the flavor still didn't stop that chocolate craving. The 3rd batch had 2/3 cup cocoa in it along with some coconut extract and a 1/2 pinch ground cloves and nutmeg to accent the chocolate and was beaten with a whip on our kitchenaid. Now it's a bit better, but still not what I would call 'Best'. imho."
"3","1","No one in my family cared for these. Not the rich chocolate flavor I'm looking for."
"3","5","My husband made this recipe and I was a little worried at first when I saw them. They had more of a cake-like appearance (about 1 1/2 inches tall) instead of the usual flat brownie that you get when you make a boxed mix. I made the frosting as directed and got very worried, it was so thick it reminded me of play-dough. But after thinning with a little milk, the end result was a fantastic brownie - not too rich, not too greasy, not too sweet. Just Perfect. This will become our staple brownie recipe!"
"3","5","I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13X9 for about 20 minutes. I did not use the frosting but topped with mini m&ms and milk choc chips. I baked the night before I needed them. Super easy 1 pot clean up. Fudgy and delicious! Thanks Angie!"
"3","5","I made these with Hershey's coccoa. They turned out better than all the brownie recipes I've made with expensive baking chocolate. Very, very easy...I just use the saucepan in which I melt the butter and only dirty one dish! Simple and cheap!"
"3","4","i doubled the recipe using an 8-inch pan..gave a nice height..the sides turned out a bit cake-ish but the insides were more fudgy..tasted nicer when refrigerated...using cocoa only din really give enuff chocalatey flavoir...thank god i put in half a cupful of chocolate chips and some chopped walnuts too...overall..okay and nice enuff..though i've tried a different recipe which produced similar results..;)"
"3","5","These brownies were EXTRA moist! i added a few handfuls of chocolate chips, and it gave it an additional chocolately taste. I also reduced the sugar by a bit, so it wouldn't be as sweet. The thing I love about this recipe is that it only uses 1/2 cup of flour, and lots of cocoa powder!"
"3","5","I have made these brownies many times. I never have any left over. I have even made them for neighbor get togethers and everyone wants the recipe for them. My kids really love them. If i could give this more stars i would. They are FANTASTIC."
"3","1","These ended up tasting like nothing but cocoa flavored sugar--very grainy."
"3","5","I always use this recipe to make brownies. I've never even tried the frosting; these brownies are delicious all by themselves! Thanks for the great recipe, Angie!"
"3","5","Very good brownie recipe! I doubled it and added a few milk chocolate chips - even though it probably didn't need them. This is a very rich recipe, and I didn't even frost them! Chewy & fudgy, too - so if you're looking for a cake-like brownie, this isn't the one."
"3","5","The butter (instead of oil) in this recipe makes a huge difference! These brownies were very easy to make and absolutely yummy--the frosting was great too, although I did add a smidge of milk to smooth it out. The only other thing I would change is to use a little less sugar in the brownies. I'm not a baking whiz, but I whipped these up very quickly."
"3","5","These are definately the best brownies for a late night snack, since they involve little effort, few ingredients, with muchos results! Like other reviewers, I doubled the recipie, omittited the nuts and the icing, and subsituted 1/2 the butter for 1/2 c. oil ( i like grapeseed, but you could use canoyla, sunflower, or vegitable). Not the fudgiest brownies you will ever eat ( if you have chocolate chips, throw a cup of those in there if you want fudgy brownies) but very good, very easy, and not too 'cakey' as some reviewers claim."
"3","5","Wonderful just as they are. Thick and rich! I did add caramel dip, mini chips, and pecans to the second batch I made. Then I topped with a few melted Milk Choc Chip, drizzled caramel, and roasted pecans."
"3","5","This brownie recipe was soooo good!! I would highly recommend it to everyone. I followed the recipe exactly but slightly warmed the frosting and immediately frosted when the brownies came out of the oven. They are fudgy and yummy, not a cake type of brownie."
"3","5","Yum Yum!! nice and fudgy and easy! I'm going to be using this one over and over."
"3","4","Theses Brownies are great if you cut the cocoa in half. They were just a little too fudgy with all the cocoa."
"3","5","I suddenly had a craving for brownies while it was raining outside. I had no premade mixes handy. So I resorted to this recipe. It turns out to be very easy to make but delicious. I made mine without the frosting."
"3","5","These are absolutely fabulous. They are the moist, chewy type of brownie, as opposed to the cake-like brownie. I followed the recipe exactly, then topped them with chopped toasted pecans, immediately after spreading on the frosting. So quick and easy; less than 45 minutes time from when I printed the recipes, to taking my first appreciative bite! Thanks for sharing. We'll be making these again and again!"
"3","5","These are fantastic! I made them to send to my brother who is in the Air Force. He got them 3 days after I made them and they generated a marriage proposal for me from one of his roommates. :) These really are the Best Brownies! Very light and airy, not heavy. *****"
"3","5","This brownies are great tasting. I find that they turn out too thin though. I like to make one and a half recipe for this size pan. I had to add 2 Tbsp of milk to the frosting to make it usable, but then it turned out great! This is my favorite recipe for brownies!"
"3","5","Delicious, and like many reviewers already stated, very much like a box mix. Mine turned out perfectly, and that's even after I discovered I had run out of butter and had to do half butter half oil for the batter. I havn't made the icing yet, and probably won't, as these have that 'crunchy' crust on top. Once again another successful recipe."
"3","5","These were very easy to make and are very good. They are not the traditional compact chewy brownie that yoy may be used to and if you are looking for that then keep looking! But theses are yummy and my kids gobbled them up!Thx"
"3","5","These were so delicious, and I never even got to the frosting."
"3","4","tasty good, super easy to make if you already have all the ingredients at home. if i had a box of brownies though i think i'd still make that instead."
"3","5","Very easy and quick to make. They have a fugey texture to them. Take them out a bit sooner then it says and they turn out nice and soft."
"3","5","finally i was looking online for a quick and easy brownie recipe that i could make with things i already had in the kitchen and voila here we are i didnt make the frosting but i did double the recipe and i must say it was far too simple and completely delicious enjoy"
"3","3","Although they were tasty, they didn't turn out like any brownie I've every had. They were rich and moist but with more of a light texture...almost cakelike. Overall, I was a bit disappointed as I really wanted brownies and ended up getting something else."
"3","3","These brownies are good. I would double the recipe though. The ones I made turned out flatter than I like. I've never made brownies with unsweetened cocoa powder and they turned out pretty good. The recipe seems to be pretty similar to the one on the box of the unsweetened baking squares and if you use the squares the brownies seem to turnout more fudgy. Instead of the frosting I sifted powdered sugar over them."
"3","5","THIS WAS THE BEST BROWNIES I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!"
"3","5","Although the brownie recipe was good, the frosting was too thick (needs some more butter, or cream (as another reviewer suggested). Bottom line: Brownies, excellent; frosting, mediocre."
"3","5","Yummmyyy...these brownies are so good. I too didn't do the frosting, but it sure wasn't missed. I used these as the base for my York Peppermint Patty (R) brownies and I cut off the edges because I was giving them to someone as a gift and my husband ate all of the edges!! Took the whole plate!! I think my favorite part about this recipe is that I can make them the whole recipes in the saucepan that I melted the butter in! So easy and soo yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","Absolutely the best brownie recipe ever! I don't know if this will help others, but here is how I get fudgy, very dense brownies: I use margarine instead of butter. I don't use a mixer - use a spoon. I mix the wet ingredients really well, but only mix the dry ingredients in until just mixed. The less you mix, the denser the brownies. I also cook until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the brownies comes out clean. My brownies are never cake-like, always fudgy and thick. If you want a really, really good chocolate frosting recipe to top these with, try Texas Chocolate Frosting from this site. 1/2 recipe of frosting will cover a 9x13 pan (double brownie recipe). I always double the brownie recipe, cook until toothpick comes out clean, frost with Texas frosting while still warm and then let cool before cutting."
"3","4","The brownies weren't pretty right from the oven, but nothing a little powdered sugar or frosting couldn't take of. They were tasty and my family loved them. I never thought I'd say that frosting could be too sweet, but I might say that in this case. I didn't have any problems, though, with mixing up the frosting. The longer I stirred the fluffier and better textured it became. I didn't have to heat it or add milk. I'll definitely make the brownies again, but might delete the honey in the frosting and use a little milk instead."
"3","1","Didn't come out as what i've expected. Not chocolatey enough even though i added a bit more cocoa powder than what was on the recipe."
"3","4","These are terrific brownies. When i made them the first time I thought they looked too moist coming out of the oven after allotted time. I was wrong, they firmed up and were delicious. I added walnuts. I usually frost my brownies. With this recipe I did not need to frost them. Don't know how long they stay moist because I can't keep them long enough to find out."
"3","5","These are definately the BEST brownies! The only thing wrong with them is that they don't make enough! They are very fudgy and the frosting is great. The frosting was a bit dry so I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil and it turned out great! These brownies have become our new favorite dessert! I won't make the boxed stuff again!"
"3","4","Very good! Just be careful you DON'T EAT THE WHOLE PAN!! hee hee but they were not as chewy as I like a brownie to be..but still very moist and excellent!!"
"3","5","I'm normally a lover of the brownies that come from a mix! Nothing can compare to the yummy taste of fattening brownies from a mix in a box. I like the way they always turn out fudgey and moist. BUT, I was home one day and was craving chocolate. So I hopped onto this website and found this brownie recipe. I had all the ingredients in my kitchen, it seemed so easy that I knew I couldn't mess it up! They turned out GREAT! I've made them once more since then and they are the only homemade brownies that taste close to the boxed ones....and since I'm using fresh-er ingredients they're probably more healthy (hee-hee) too! Thanks for sharing this recipe. BTW: I never made the frosting, but it sounds good."
"3","5","I loved these brownies. They came out really well, chewy and chocolatey and not too rich at all. My husband has a low tolerance for very sweet things, but he loved these! It's great, I've tried a few brownie recipes lately and this one is my favourite!"
"3","5","Excellent brownie recipe! The only thing I changed is I added 1 jar of baby food applesauce (or baby food prunes or pears) and decreased the butter to 1/4 c. I made these, let them cool and they were gone in less than 10 mins, eaten by my family of 4 before I even got a chance to frost them! If you make these double or triple the recipe! Chef Marian Thompson, Certified Pastry Chef"
"3","1","Funny these didn't turn out for me! Remember to cool the butter after you've melted it before adding the eggs....also, the frosting turned out 'grainy'...oh well, another day!"
"3","5","These brownies are so tender and perfect with the icing. They taste similar, but so much better than 'Little Debbie Brownies' to me."
"3","4","Great taste/texture, Kids ate the lot."
"3","5","SIMPLY BROWNIE HEAVEN !!!!!"
"2","5","I have been making this recipe for a while now, and it is a family favorite!! Since a few of my kids and husband are sensitive to dairy, I sub out the butter for coconut oil. That makes it taste sort of like German Chocolate :). I have never made the frosting, I think the brownies more than satisfy the sweet tooth and chocolate craving! They are perfectly moist and chewy....my personal favorite way to enjoy brownies :)."
"2","5","Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, baked 24 min, skipped the frosting. Super love it!"
"2","4","These brownies were fudgy and rich. When I made the batter, it was a tan color more than brown. I think I would add more cocoa powder next time. Also, the frosting was too much. It didn't add anything to the brownie - it actually distracted from the brownie."
"2","5","Typical homemade brownie, delicious. Somewhat on the soft and fluffy end rather than being fudge-like. Added a bit of chocolate chips, extra delicious. Must make again."
"2","2","I was looking for something more chewy."
"2","5","Yes!!!!! These brownies are the best homemade recipe I have ever had and made. I didn't make the frosting but I added chocolate chips in my batter. SO GOOD!"
"2","5","My children really enjoyed these brownies!!! They loved the frosting, softness and chewiness.. overall delicious!!!"
"2","5","Very easy...very good! I just made a batch and I've already ate 5."
"2","4","Tastes good and chocolaty. The frosting was a bit dry and difficult to spread. I will adjust frosting next time."
"2","3","This recipe is difficult to rate because it REALLY depends on what you like in a brownie.   You will like this brownie if you like a brownie that is: -crunchy on the outside, fudgy in the middle -very buttery and sweet -mild chocolate flavor  You will NOT like this brownie as much if you like a brownie that is: -very chocolatey -lightly sweet...more chocolate than sweet -either very dense or very light (this recipe is a mix)  Unfortunately I prefer very chocolatey brownies, so I will probably not make this recipe again. I do like the texture though."
"2","5","Mine are cooking in the oven now!!! :) so easy to make and I'm an amateur!!! They smell so good"
"2","5","I've experimented with this recipe and several others, and I keep coming back to this one. My initial resistance was that I don't like frosted brownies, and without the frosting it wasn't chocolatey enough. My solution was to add 1/3 c. semisweet chocolate chips. Perfection! Be sure to bake in a metal pan, not glass, or they'll dry out without ever getting done."
"2","5","Followed the brownie part of the recipe and these turned out great. We won't be buying box mixes again :) Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"2","5","Always a success. I also add walnuts at times"
"2","3","What did I do wrong? Doubled the recipe and followed the instructions. They looked good, but they were too sweet and too buttery. My oven is very hot I guess because they were already burned on the bottom after only 18 minutes. Not sure what changes to make."
"2","5","I love brownies, and these are amazing! I'll be making these for my family and co-workers for years to come!"
"2","5","I make them without the frosting and they turn out delicious but i cant make them to often because i cant stop myself from eating all of them in one day!"
"2","3","They were not fudgey, tasted bland, and just not what I call brownie"
"2","5","Perfect brownies every time with this recipe! I got a little adventurous with ingredients I needed to use up in my pantry so these turned into S'Mores Brownies yesterday. Made a simple graham crust with graham cracker crumbs & melted butter. To the brownie batter I added a pinch of the graham crumbs & marshmallows. Poured batter over the crust, added some more marshmallows and crumbs on top and baked for about 30 min. They were gooey, chocolatey, sweet and crispy with the graham. Absolutely divine. I brought them to work for a coworkers birthday and they were DEVOURED."
"2","5","This is the perfect blending of crispy and chewy. My new go to dessert recipe. Easy and delicious. I will never use box brownie mixes again!"
"2","5","Wow! These were super easy and turned out fantastic. The texture is just right-not gooey, not cakey, just melt in your mouth yum! Will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!"
"2","5","Superb! These really are the Best Brownies! I only had one egg so I substituted 1/4 cup of soft tofu blended smooth but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I ended up pressing and spreading the frosting with my fingers. This is now our family brownie recipe, bye-bye Betty Crocker!"
"2","5","I tried this recipe as listed once (no frosting) and it was great, but it was missing something. Last time I made these brownies I doubled the recipe, added another cup of sugar, a jar of nutella, a jar of peanut butter, a cup of Hershey's syrup, a cup of chocolate chips, a package of Ferrero Roscher balls, almond roca candy bars, a large bag of M&Ms and a peanut butter chocolate heart shaped cookie and it definitely gave the recipe the little bit it was missing at first. Will use again! Thank you allrecipes:)"
"2","5","These are sooo delicious and easy to make. The taste is more chocolatey than any box brownies I've tried. It's safe to say I won't be buying boxed brownies anymore. I made it with the frosting, but they are tasty enough to not require the frosting."
"2","5","Best brownies recipe! Fudgy & chewy."
"2","5","Just made these. I beat the eggs first than added them to avoid mixing the batter too much.. I added milk to the frosting to make it easier to spread. This is the first time making brownies from scratch. They are absolutely delicious and easy to make. I will never use a box mix again."
"2","5","I made this today and the brownies came out great! They were 65% fudgey and 35% cakey so they tasted very good. I didn't make the frosting though. I cooked mine for about 20 mins but my oven is quite strong. I will definitely be making these again soon!"
"2","5","99.9% of everything I bake is homemade(no box/no mix). Brownies are that .1%, always a box mix. I could never find a homemade recipe that I really liked and since I'm not a huge fan of brownies(but the family is) it didn't really matter to me. So box and I was done. I have a son who has a nut allergy and I have to be extra picky with whatever I buy. He was wanting brownies, we have snow and I couldn't get out and so I turned to looking for yet another scratch recipe to try. My search led me here and I am not disappointed. Excellent recipe! Chewy & fudgy, not cake-like at all. I did not make the frosting. I read some reviews before making and tried some suggestions. First, when I doubled the recipe(baked in 13x9) I used one less egg. Second, I lightly beat the eggs before adding to the butter. My son took one bite and said, 'Yes!' with a huge smile. Even I think this recipe could turn my brownie indifference around."
"2","5","For an even richer, chocolatier version, sprinkle a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips over the batter before baking!"
"2","4","These were very good--definitely better than a box mix. I may have left them in the oven for slightly too long, but I'm going to try a couple more recipes to see if I can tweak these to perfect before I settle on these as the 'best'."
"2","5","5/12 Update - Made these brownies again, but substituted 1/2 cup mashed avocado for the butter. WOW!!! A little fluffier than the original, but still just as delicious. A great healthy alternative.   Made this recipe last night, as written. The brownies were good hot from the pan, but they were amazing when they cooled. They were chocolaty and chewy like a brownie should be. I tried not to over mix it, but it was a little difficult getting the wet and dry ingredients to mix. I will definitely be making these again, since I always have the simple ingredients on hand."
"2","5","Very easy and simple recipe. Made double batch yesterday and it eas gone, before any pics were taken. Made a single batch today, excellent."
"2","5","These turned out GREAT. In my opinion, the frosting was a little stuff for frosting, so I added just a bit of water to make it smoother."
"2","5","I love this recipe, because you usually have these ingredients on hand. When I want something yummy and chocolaty, I can whip these up! I never buy boxed brownies anymore!!"
"2","5","Wonderful! Followed exactly as written and they were better than the box mix. Just one tip, it might help to melt the butter completely when making the frosting and make it in a warm area of the kitchen to help it come together better."
"2","5","I've been using this recipe for years; it's the Hershey's Cocoa brownie recipe off the cocoa tin, cut in half. Shame on people who claim a recipe is theirs when it is so obviously not. I'll even bet most of these folks who do this also claim to be good Christians. Shame on all of you. That being said, this is a great recipe for delicious brownies."
"2","3","Followed the recipe but had very dry, cake like brownies."
"2","5","I made these brownies for Valentines day, and the kids all loved them. Definitely making these again."
"2","5","So moist and chocolatey! I know my oven runs a little hot, so I baked at 330 instead of 350. I also noticed the batter was quite thin in an 8x8 pan, so I only baked it for 20 minutes. Finally, I barely mixed the batter together after I added the flour. I made the frosting as directed, and it was thick and fudge-like. I dropped it in heaps on the HOT brownies, and within a minute it had melted into a spreadable glaze. Definitely will be making this again."
"2","5","I doubled the recipe to fit in a 9*13 pan and added chopped walnuts. Did not over mix or over bake to keep them moist and chewy! Did not ice them. Served them up on a cake stand as a Valentine surprise for my Husband when he came home from work!"
"2","5","These are just about the best brownies ever! They are quite easy to make. Right now I'm going to go make some more. Eat them with some ice cream on top, mmmmm!"
"2","5","Excellent! This is my go-to recipe for brownies! Love that the icing is also included. Delicious and easy!"
"2","4","Honestly these took under the estimated hour to make. Prep did not take 25 minutes and cleanup was a breeze! With only the saucepan used to make these it was the easiest brownie recipe I have ever made. I took them out of the oven and the top is crispy just like it should be. They came out more cakey in the middle than I would have liked but they were spread pretty thin in the pan that I had, so I probably should have cooked them a a few minutes less than I did. I will be trying these again!"
"2","4","I made these tonight, I tried adjusting the serving sizes with the new update (app on my phone) then returned back to the original and for some reason the butter amount came up as 3 tbs instead of 1/2 cup like it's supposed to. So I only put 3 tbsp, and my brownies did not rise. at all! They tasted delicious, but flat. Next time I won't mess with the servings and I'm sure they'll be great."
"2","5","great"
"2","5","Made these brownies exactly as written and they were delicious!!! We didn't even need the frosting. This will be my go to brownie recipe for sure! No more boxed stuff for this family! Thanks for a perfect homemade recipe!"
"2","5","I made the first batch on whim one night....delish. My husband and I loved them so much we made them for the Super Bowl party...everyone loved them! I DID NOT make the frosting...brownies are good enough without it! I followed the recipe, only adjustment was that I like mine a little under, so 350 for 20-25 was perfect for a soft, fudgy brownie! This is now my go to recipe, super easy and delish! Great to play around with too, add in some chocolate chips or top with caramel, yum."
"2","5","The bater is gobbled up by the time I put it in the baking pan"
"2","5","These are so perfect and totally easy to make! I am new at baking and this one was so easy and yummy, I didn't even do the frosting. I read some of the reviews and left it in the oven for 20 minutes instead of 25 as one guy said. It turned out chewy and not cakey at all! The next day it got a bit harder and better - more brownie like and unlike a cake. I am definitely keeping this recipe and doing this again! xxxx"
"2","5","This recipe will be the reason my boyfriend marries me. We made it for a holiday and it turned out PERFECT. We double the recipe ingredients because we use a little bit deeper of a pan because he likes thicker brownies. But other than that it's delicious! Also when making the topping at one point and time it will be become really clumpy and thick before it gets smooth. Keep mixing, eventually it will come out! :)"
"2","5","Best from scratch brownie recipe! And you can't skip the icing...I used four tablespoons of margarine instead of butter for the icing and it was amazing! Thanks for an easy dessert recipe!"
"2","5","Easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe and baked this in a 9x13 pan. I stirred everything in instead of using the mixer to make sure the brownies would come out fudge and not cake-like. I baked the brownies for 25 minutes and they were perfect - moist and slightly chewy. For the frosting, I followed the suggestion of others and only used half of the recommended amount of powdered sugar. I spread the frosting on top of the brownies shortly after they came out of the oven and it made a nice glaze."
"2","3","Not really chocolatety, not really fudgy. I wouldn't make it again."
"2","5","These brownies are great and very easy to make! I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter. I also took them out of the oven at 20 minutes and they were cooked perfectly!"
"2","5","I made these as the directed without the frosting. Very delicious. Thanks so much for sharing. I will not by boxed brownie mix again. :)"
"2","5","I really like this recipe. It is very simple. I wanted to add my own personal touch to it though. I made these brownies, but instead of a typical square brownie a made brownie bites in a mini cupcake pan dusted with powdered sugar and then drizzled a semi-sweet chocolate sauce over the top. They were a hit at a dinner we were invited to."
"2","3","The taste was decent, but it turned out like cake NOT BROWNIES. I did use my blender, and as one reviewer commented, it should be stirred by hand to avoid adding extra air and avoiding the 'cake' result. I believe this recipe should state to mix by hand."
"2","5","These are delicious! Best brownies I've ever made! I have doubled the batch and baked for 30 minutes. I've never used the frosting, the brownies are sweet and rich on their own. Definitely recommend."
"2","5","All the reviews-RIGHT ON!! This is the best brownie recipe I have ever tried. I made them as directed. No substitutions. Perfect as is. Bye bye store bought!!"
"2","5","OMG where has this recipe been all of my life? I have been using another brownie recipe from this site for the past year. After reading a few of the reviews, I decided to try this recipe. I didn't use the frosting because they were so good without it and to be honest, I couldn't resist long enough to even think about frosting. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup walnuts. I ate 1/2 the pan by myself....not a good idea but I couldn't help myself. Oh how I LOVE BROWNIES!!!"
"2","5","Amazing made these many times. I only put one egg (more chewy) and mix cocoa in at the last second to get a shiny hard top... I also never tried the icing so I can't rate it. Thanks Angie"
"2","5","Simple and delicious! Used it for brownie sundaes."
"2","5","We will never buy boxed brownies again! This came together so fast. It was so delicious and fudgy, it wasn't cakey at all. 25 minutes was perfect! Remember to flour the pan, it will help prevent sticking."
"2","5","We have seriously made these brownies two nights in a row now! Love them"
"2","5","I dust the pan with Cocoa powder rather than flour. This leaves the bottoms nice and chocolaty, rather than looking chalky from the flour. I also learned a great trick from a master baker, who told me to rather roughly drop the pan of brownies onto the counter a couple times immediately after they come out of the oven. This collapses air bubbles inside the brownies, and makes them more gooey and chewy. All in all, a great, and very easy recipe to prepare."
"2","5","Great basic brownie that always turns out, as promised. I've been using this one for a couple of years, I bake a lot and I always seem to be out of something, so I occasionally sub coconut oil for butter, or brown sugar for white, add nuts or don't, or use only one egg, or use less sugar, or omit the baking powder for more density, it's a very forgiving recipe, haven't ruined it yet. I realize as I write this that I copied it down wrong onto my cheater index cards I keep in the kitchen, and have been using 1/4 cup of cocoa all this time, still really chocolate-y. Really great staple, takes about six minutes to make, love it, thanks very much for posting it."
"2","5","Finally the perfect brownie! I can't stand cakey brownies and I'm so glad I found this recipe. Just make sure you lightly beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add last not mixing too much because then they'll be cakey. Also I top them with Hershey's morsels before baking. A double batch took 18 minutes."
"2","2","I have made these twice, thinking I messed them up the first time. Incredibly dry and cakey, not at all fudgy or chewy. In the 8x8 pan they were only about 1/2 inch thick. Cooking for 25 minutes is about twice too long! I made mine for 15 and they were so so dry. Not the best."
"2","5","Made these in no time at all!! I served them with vanilla ice cream! This is a keeper for sure!!"
"2","5","Oh my goodness yum!!!!! So simple and delicious! I skipped the frosting altogether because they were perfect as they are :) my only complaint, which I'm sure it is something I did wrong, but they didn't have the traditional crackly brownie top but other then that they were fudgey and delicious!"
"2","5","My colleague made this recipe and brought it into the office. It was as if choclate fudge and brownies had a lovechild. Totally amazing and killed my chocolate craving, dead."
"2","5","Best recipe find ever. Never buying another boxed mix. D.U.N."
"2","5","Nine year old granddaughter made these. Some of the best I've ever had!"
"2","5","Easy, delicious! No more boxed brownie mixes for our family. Topped it with easy peanut butter icing, delicious."
"2","5","Love this recipe. It is between a cakey and fudgy brownie. Still chewy and the edges get crisp. Delish! Will definitely make again. My Mom tasted them and asked for the recipe. :)"
"2","5","Tried for the first time and it was easy to prepare and yummy to eat :)"
"2","5","Easy to make, just follow the steps. Instead of the indicated frosting i have made a white chocolate glaze."
"2","5","Love love love this recipe!"
"2","5","The best!!! I have tried making it over 5 times and it always turns out good (and yes, one time I forgot to put baking powder but it was still great!). I have to double the recipe to make a good size brownie otherwise mines is very thin. I will definitely continue for using this recipe!!"
"2","5","This recipe was great, and totally the best brownies! I made these and my family ate them ALL, and by the next day, they were gone : ) The frosting, though, needs WATER. Add water in, 1/4 a cup at a time after mixing all but the honey in first. Add the honey last. Once the constancy is right, you are good!"
"2","5","The best brownies I ever had! Had a little trouble with the frosting.had to add a little half and half and a little extra honey to make it moist."
"2","5","I made this and found the description to be accurate. It's a little cakey but mostly fudgey. I didn't make he frosting as I like brownies without. The other suggestions to not over beat or over bake are spot on, I think. Easy to whip up even on short notice. I used an odd sized pan (about 8 1/2x8') and only baked 15 min and the brownies came out perfectly."
"2","5","These were great! I substituted vegetable oil for the butter and loosely packed brown sugar for the white sugar. They came out moist and rich. Definitely a keeper."
"2","5","The brownie recipe is 5 stars as is, but I enhanced the yummy as follows (stir everything by hand): melt butter completely in microwave (use a glass 'batter bowl,' then add the sugar and vanilla (I also added about 1tsp strongly brewed coffee. Let it sit.   Beat the eggs (just use a fork) in a separate bowl until they're consistent and a bit frothy. Let them sit.  Combine all dry ingredients and mix together with a fork. I made my own baking powder (it's just baking soda and cream of tartar), but you don't have to if yours is fresh. Let that sit.  Go back to the eggs, beat them.again, and add them to the butter/sugar mixture. Beat that until well incorporated (about 30 seconds).  Get your dry ingredients and dump them into a sifter (I use a strainer) and sift that dry mixture right into the wet. You can toss in the unsifted crumbs left in your sifter, too.  With a wooden spoon, stir the wet and dry ingredients together JUST until they're combined. The amount of stirring will affect the texture, and we're shooting for melt-in-your-mouth yumminess.  Dump the mixture in a baking pan, then drop the pan (carefully) several times on a hard surface - you'll see the bubbles move to the top, thereby reducing air pockets (holey brownies, Batman!).  Bake exactly 30 mins depending on your oven. I used my awesome toaster oven (less heat and energy use).  I ignored the frosting recipe and just melted some butter, added some powdered sugar and vanilla, and drizzled it on top. It solidifie"
"2","5","I have literally been asked to make these brownies so many times. They are so much better than box brownie mix. I highly recommend!"
"2","5","I actually like the cake like quality of these....seems 'lighter' than box-mix brownies. I don't care for frosting so I didn't make that part. I have made two batches since yesterday....yummmm"
"2","5","I skipped the icing, and the brownies were delicious. I melted my butter in the microwave, and was a little short so I added canola oil to make up the difference. Otherwise followed the directions directly. I recommend mixing the cocoa into the butter-egg-sugar mixture first, then stirring in the flour to ensure consistent chocolate flavour. I mixed by hand and didn't overstir.   To those who found the brownies bland, I wonder how old their cocoa was? I happened to have brand new Hershey's cocoa, which may have contributed to the fantastic flavour. Comparable to melted chocolate brownies. I know powders in the pantry (baking powder, cocoa powder) do stale over the years if you don't use them up frequently."
"2","3","My brownies turned out very crispy! I put them in for 30 minutes! Also I used a 13x9 in. Pan and I had to use 1 recipe and half of one! It turned out crispy in some spots but okay in others. I hope others have better luck!"
"2","5","Definitely the perfect recipe for our family. I double the recipe and use 3 eggs instead of 4, keeping all else as directed. Turns out beautifully every time, easy ~ tasty ~ and disappear very quickly. No need for icing. I make these regularly now upon request. This is now my go to recipe for brownies."
"2","5","I'm 10 years old and my mom let me bake this recipe... BEST BROWNIES EVER! highly recommend these. i coudnt stop eating them. never had better brownies in my life. thank you for this recipe i will be making these again"
"2","1","I didn't think these tasted like brownies at all - more like barely sweetened cake."
"2","4","Followed brownie recipe exactly and they were delicious! Baked for 25 minutes they were perfect. The frosting needed a little milk to help it come together. Was too much for that size pan. Very rich and very sweet! My only change would be to use about half the frosting or I might just leave it off altogether!"
"2","3","I was excited to try this recipe since it got good reviews and is easy. They smelled good cooking in the oven. I tried to make the icing and it turned out very powdery!!! It was not an icing at all. I even reread the directions and ingredients to make sure I didn't miss something. I ended up trashing it. The brownies themselves were not chocolatey enough for me and were a bit on the dry side. I made my own icing and that made them taste a little better. Will be looking for a new recipe....."
"2","5","This was my first time making brownies without using chocolate chips. I've always hated cocoa powder since I was a kid because I tried eating it once thinking it was hot chocolate powder. Nope! I was wary of this recipe because of that, but desperately wanted a sugar fix so tried these anyways. They turned out perfectly! Actually I screwed up the recipe and put some regular sugar in the icing but it still worked out. Don't double the frosting if you are doubling the brownies. They are pretty sweet but taste amazing. I'd be interested in trying it with less sugar next time but I don't know how to bake/change things without screwing it up so I'll just keep this recipe as is for now :D"
"2","5","These are pure sin, they are so good! No frosting needed. Absolutely perfect texture and taste. Buh-bye box mixes!"
"2","5","I made them exactly as the recipe except skipped the frosting. Delicious!"
"2","4","These brownies did end up a little too cakey for my taste. I only used about 3/4 the total amount of sugar to get a darker more bitter sweet flavor. If I make these again I would use baking soda instead of baking powder so they aren't so cakey."
"2","5","My husband asks for these brownies at least once a week. We don't make the frosting but he loves it when I add some white chocolate chips to the batter. We will NEVER eat the boxed brownies again. I giggle when my friends say how much trouble it is to make non-boxed brownies. This is just as easy, as the box, and I know exactly what is going in them."
"2","4","I tried this recipe; it was really cake-like. I switched from butter to vegetable oil, but the result was still the same. A bit disappointed, but it tasted ok and really easy to make."
"2","2","I was not a fan of these, they were dry and odd tasting. They were easy to make but not worth it."
"2","5","Doubled the recipe and it came out just perfect. I took the advice of not overmixing and overcooking, 1/2 the powdered sugar in the frosting and Voila! Mouthwatering brownies that only lasted for a couple hours. I like my brownies thick so when I doubled the recipe, I lightly oiled and floured one 9x13 pan and at 325 slowly baked it for about 30 minutes. I put the frosting on top right out of the oven, placed foil over it, and put it outside in the -0 weather MN still has. Lovely, I know. Enjoy. I'll be making these again and again. ;)  This brownie is a mix between fudge, truffles, and chocolate cake. Yummy!"
"2","4","I doubled the recipe and made a few changes. First, I used very finely ground rice flour from the Asian market. Second, I still used only 2 eggs and added about a half cup applesauce. Third, I used slightly less sugar. It turned out amazingly light and fluffy. I hope it actually dries a little when it cools."
"2","2","very cake like, soft good cake, but bad brownies, I was very disappointed!"
"2","5","Very delicious and I agree, cake like brownies which didn't matter to me 'cause I ate a whole row after I made them!!"
"2","4","5 stars if you just make the brownies, but 3 stars for the frosting recipe. My daughter made these on her own and was baffled when trying to stir 'softened' butter with the other ingredients to make a creamy frosting. Helloo! The butter needs to be melted. We made it work by adding milk to get a spreadable consistency. The brownies were thin, chewy and densely delectable. Yum."
"2","5","Wow! Loved this recipe! My kids are brownie critics and they loved these! Only change was I added some chocolate syrup (about 1/2-1T) to the frosting for consistency. They were gone in hours! Thank you! I'll not be buying mix from the store again!!"
"2","5","Simply amazing!! I like to double the batch, but use the same size pan and follow the directions exactly, they come out thick and very fudgy and super moist. Very awesome!"
"2","2","I did not like these brownies. They tasted like a light and fluffy, chocolate cake."
"2","2","I was craving the kind of brownies you can make from a box, like Pillsbury. Dark, moist, chewy, chocolatey with that papery thin layer on top. These were a lighter color, crusty around the edges and crumbly/cakey in the center, stuck to the pan, and had a thick hard layer on top that cracked and crumbled when trying to cut them. This was not at all what I was craving."
"2","5","Just tried this recipe today because others always call for chocolate, which I have around much less often. Mine came out slightly cakier than I expected, but after reading the reviews I know it is because I overmixed. And I think next time I will try the adjustmens some made of half brown sugar and omitting the baking powder. That said, even somewhat cakey these were just amazing! Very, very easy to put together and very little cleanup. Instead of greasing and flouring the 8x8 pan, I lined it with parchment paper and rubbed a tiny bit of the melted butter onto it. They popped out easily and left me one less thing to wash.  I'll most definitely be making these again. Probably making them far too often."
"2","4","These brownies were so good! I made it two times in one week! The second time I got it right on the spot. I added some leftover semi-sweet chocolate chips I had laying around. It turned these brownies to the next level. The only mistake with the recipe is the frosting. Almost all brownies are better without them, some might like the crunch but me and my family doesn't. I didn't add any baking powder, it made it a little more fudgy and more chewy. If you add it it has a little cake-like consitancy. I also only added 3/4 cup of sugar. 2 tablespoons of honey, it made it a it a little more fudgy."
"2","5","My husband said these were the best brownies ever!"
"2","5","This was amazing omg thank u for this recipe the sause was good it was just good the whole thing. I did add some instant chocolate pudding though n some powered sugar on top but it was good without it as well."
"2","5","This has become my favorite brownie recipe. Every time I make these, I get a ton of compliments. These are delicious!"
"2","5","Very good. Have made this many times for a quick sunday night dessert and for school bake sales. One of our favourites!!"
"2","5","I just made this recipe today. OMG amazing! I ended up doubling the recipe to make a 9x13 pan. Then I made a cheesecake layer that topped this brownie mixture and baked for 45 mins. Then I made a peanut butter chocolate ganache topping over that.,,placed in the fridge for a few hours. In the end I got an amazing brownie,cheesecake and hard shelled topping. Served it up with some vanilla bean ice cream YUM can't even describe this."
"2","5","Easy and delicious. I'm not sure what the few complainers are on about but my family asks for them all the time."
"2","5","If you make them correctly (i.e don't over bake) you will love these fudgy brownies. In a pyrex 8x8' mine were done at 20mins. If your toothpick/knife/fork whatever you use to check them comes out with a few crumbs on it they are done. If the utensil comes out totally clean you have over baked your brownies. When done right its hard not to eat the whole pan by yourself. These brownies don't need frosting at all they are sweet enough on their own."
"2","2","The brownie part is easy and great, but the frosting recipes just yields an 'un-spreadable' ball. This was a disaster for me. I thought the frosting might warm up and become spreadable when I put it on the warm brownies, but it wasn't. I had to take it off twice to add more butter so it would spread. They look terrible. I still gave this 2 stars because they taste amazing and I appreciate that all the ingredients are things I usually have on hand, but there is something wrong with this frosting recipe. Perhaps all the high reviews are from people who didn't bother with the icing part?!"
"2","5","I switched the amount of flour and cocoa powder because I like my brownies rich. I also decreased the cooking time by three minutes, otherwise they would have been over done. I substituted half and half for the honey in the frosting recipe. Absolutely delicious with Andes mint chips in the mix as well!"
"2","5","This recipe is so doggone good! My fourteen year old daughter and I just made this recipe. It is tasty and she actually put all the ingredients together herself. I just watched her and when they came out of the oven I waited five minutes and tasted them. One thing though, I didn't use a whole cup of confectioner's sugar. I used just a smidgen more than a half."
"2","5","I was looking for a brownie recipe, and I decided to give this recipe a try........Was SO easy to mix up, and I used only 1 bowl, no need to get out my HUGE Kitchen Aid Stand mixer. I used used the hand held mixer :-) I would make these again, that's for sure....."
"2","5","Made this and my roommates LOVED it!!  I threw in some sprinkles just for fun (:"
"2","5","Delicious! I used toll house cocoa and followed another users advice and only mixed the ingredients with a spoon, to avoid them being cake like."
"2","5","Amazing recipe! Brownies turned out very soft in the middle. Only thing to note is that I would put in less powdered sugar for the icing...mine turned out too thick to spread, even when I put it on the brownies straight out of the oven. I would add the sugar in 1/2 c. increments until you get the desired consistency."
"2","5","Lovely! I used unsweetened chocolate because that's what I have on hand, and reduced the amount of butter accordingly (conversion from Joy of Baking site). Made 1.5x the recipe and got a thick brownie. I'll skip the baking powder next time for a denser treat. Instead of the frosting, I topped mine with Andes Mints wafer mint chocolates before baking. My mother had first bite; she beat my brother to it. Haha! Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","I've made these quite a few times. They are super easy and very tasty! I don't normally like frosting on brownies at all but this frosting is actually pretty good and compliments the brownies perfectly."
"2","5","Perfect as is, quick and easy. Excellent even without the frosting. Thank you for a great recipe"
"2","5","Scrumdidillyumptious!!! WOW! These brownies are delightful! I've just made these for the third time and slightly modified the recipe, which made them beyond decadent!!! I added 1/2 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, and an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. BOOM! I don't know what exactly happened while baking....but, they came out of the oven and I had to practically tackle my husband to the floor so he didn't consume them all at once! *Also, prep time takes me max 10 minutes, and baking for approx. 20-25 min for my oven. p.s. NO NEED to add the frosting!! Easiest and most wonderful brownies EVER! After making these, why would anyone want to make brownies from a box ever again?!"
"2","5","These brownies by far are the best brownies I have ever made!!!! They were quick and easy to make. They just melt in your mouth. I have to make two batches when I make them, one with nuts and one without for my kids."
"2","5","awesome!!"
"2","5","Extremely fudgy, dark chocolate brownies. The only problem was the icing. It was crumbles and wouldn't spread on the warm brownies. So off it came. I added just enough milk to make it spreading consistency, put it back on top, and spread. Turned out just fine."
"2","5","I fear making brownies, as they are either too gooey or too dry, but these were perfect. I doubled it and it took 10 minutes longer to bake in my glass 9x13 pan. I also took others' advice about not beating the ingredients too much, especially the eggs. I ran out of granulated sugar, so 1/2 of mine was raw cane sugar, but it didn't interfere. Excellent recipe!"
"2","5","These will knock your socks off!!!! YUM!"
"2","5","These are wonderful. Too wonderful. I was hoping I could leave them on the counter and walk past them without craving one. Nope. They keep calling my name. In fact, these babies won't shut up. Seriously, I made these essentially by the recipe and they are indeed chocolate perfection. I even made the icing and it was perfect. I've never been able to make that glossy, tasty and soft yet firm and dry to the touch icing that I've envied for years. Well, this is IT !! I did make two smallish additions to suit my own palate. Nothing changed in the making of them--just addition of two flavorings. 1) I always (and I mean always) add cinnamon to anything I make that is chocolate. I just do. and 2) I added 1 DROP each of almond and orange extracts to the frosting (I read it in some other recipe that that is the 'secret' to bakery icing--does give it a subtle kind of 'what the heck is that in there' quality). Thanks so much for this recipe--I will not ever EVER make boxed brownies again and I now have a new ganache-ish icing recipe."
"2","1","Dude. I can't believe that this has such a high star rating! These aren't brownies...It's a cake. SUPER cake-like. Followed the recipe exactly as stated and ended up with a batter that was a bit runnier than the average boxed brownie mix. I thought oh well, we'll see. Came out and they were very fluffy and rounded on top just like a cake. If you're looking for fudge-like, dense, and rich brownies, these aren't it. These are cake-like and kind of bland to tell you the truth.   I'm going to add a cream cheese frosting now that I've got a cake to serve to my coworkers. I'm a tad SAD!!  The only thing I can think that might help this recipe is to take out an egg. Maybe that would make it more fudge-like."
"2","5","I've made home made brownies a few times, this was by far the best recipe! I would rather make these than ever buy a brownie again cause they were that good, even without the frosting! Just make sure to take them out in time."
"2","5","Really good recipe! I used coconut oil in place of butter and whole wheat flour in place of regular. No problems!"
"2","2","Brownie part - good; Frosting - way too sweet! Corrective action - omit the honey, add milk instead!"
"2","5","Perfect every single time I make them! The perfect brownie, being a little bit of a crust on the outside and moist and chewy in the middle. I like to make them sweet and salty by adding kosher or sea salt to the top before baking. I could eat the whole pan."
"2","5","These are perfect! I have made these numerous times and my husband loves them every time I make them. No changes, just perfect. We still can't decide if they are more 'cake like' or 'fudge like'. But who cares, they are good!"
"2","5","well, it's 5 stars the way i made it, and i changed a lot to make it vegan and healthier. i replaced the eggs with banana, the butter with apple sauce, and the flour, with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 almond meal. i lowered the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar, and doubled all the ingredients. i figured it wouldn't be enough. the brownies came out amazing! they are pretty and healthy and they taste great!"
"2","2","Disappointing. These are not brownies but rather cake squares. The icing was crumbly and hard to spread. Overall, a lackluster dessert which didn't satisfy my chocolate brownie cravings."
"2","5","Omg best brownies ever!! Stir by hand, do not over mix to keep it from being cake texture."
"2","5","awesome!"
"2","5","There are two other recipes on AR for these exact same brownies! How funny is that? Proof they're truly the best brownies no matter what they are called -- everyone everywhere is submitting the recipe and getting 5 stars all over the place. You won't be disappointed in this recipe! Thanks for submitting. The other two recipes are called Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies and Absolutely Best Brownies (both from this site). For the Absolutely Best Brownies, it is the same recipe if you use regular flour rather than self-rising (as submitter suggests if you want less cake-like brownies). No matter which recipe you follow, it is so easy to make them and they are simply scrumptious. I did not use a mixer, I simply stirred the ingredients. I did not add nuts. I baked them in an 8x8 pan and cut them into small squares. I wouldn't change anything. I did not use frosting -- I will another time, but honestly the recipe does not need it in order to be divine."
"2","5","We make this with coconut oil - turns out great! This is our go-to brownie recipe."
"2","1","Not good. I followed the recipe but doubled it. It didn't cook. I tried the frosting but that didn't work either it was just bunch of powder."
"2","3","This recipe was okay. It did seem like something was missing in the brownie mix though. It just had this off taste. I did not use the frosting, and maybe that would have made it taste better, but I still feel like the brownies were off. They didn't seem rich or fudge-y enough to be brownies."
"2","5","Baked this for our son and grandson last weekend. it was fabulous! So much so, they requested the recipe.   perfect warm treat with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"2","2","These turned out really flat and stuck terribly to the pan even though I greased it thoroughly. The taste is pretty good, but I wouldn't make these again."
"2","1","This was not a brownie, it was a chocolate cake, very dissapointed. The fudge was very good, I ended up eating only that."
"2","2","Sorry, I won't be making this again... Too cakey (I even used a whisk to mix by hand as other users suggested would help) and the taste was just off too, a bit strong.. I think it calls for too much vanilla. Although, I did not make any other reviewer's many suggestions."
"2","5","Great easy fast recipe it's a great dessert too. I just started to cook so It's really good for me."
"2","5","it's so good and so moist. when i made this i didn't make the frosting and it was still amazing"
"2","5","These are extremely good brownies! I've made brownies before from this site and they were very good but took my chance and made these...wow! I didn't change a thing except for the frosting. I added about 1 tbsp. evaporated milk because I had a little leftovers in the refrigerator and decided to use it. The frosting came out nice and glossy...perfect! Definitely, I'll be making this again and again."
"2","5","These brownies are excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really well. We are eating it so fast that I dont think it will last long enough to cool down."
"2","4","Flavor was great - need to temper the eggs before adding to the hot pan so you don't end up with scrambled eggs and the butter for the frosting should be melted - otherwise you end up with a clump of unspreadable frosting. Once I heated it some, it spread fine. My mom, who doesn't eat dessert (& is an amazing baker), tried some and said they were delicious!"
"2","5","These are so good! I cut the frosting recipe in half so it doesn't overpower the brownie. I've even made them without frosting. Either way... This is my new go to recipe for brownies. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"2","5","I was seriously craving brownies and came across this when I didn't have any mix. I didn't change a thing (except I didn't make the frosting) and these were the best brownies I have ever had! It makes a small batch, but I'm kinda glad. I'm editing my review to say that I made these again tonight and decided to make the frosting. After my first run was a failure, I decided to cut the sugar to a scant 2/3 cup and melt the butter. This worked perfectly, though I had to use about a batch and a half of frosting to cover one batch of brownies."
"2","5","These are crazy good! And easy! So much better than a box mix. Always a blessing to make stuff from scratch. Hard elbow grease burnin calories and more nutritious and far better taste is a win-win-win!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly. However, I didn't make the frosting as this will be used to to make brownie a la mode."
"2","5","These are the best brownies you'll ever make! They truly deserve their name. I changed the baking powder to a half teaspoon. (I like a thick brownie). If you don't want cake-like brownies, don't over-mix the batter - especially the butter and the sugar."
"2","5","Simple and delicious! I did add a splash of milk to the frosting, however. I started out stirring it with a wooden spoon, but I was just pushing around chocolate powder. Once I used the electric mixer it worked much better!"
"2","5","This is Hershey's Best Brownie recipe. I have the same exact one in my Hershey book and in my personal recipe book. The only thing I do differently is add a little espresso powder. It brings out the chocolate flavor. When I make them I always double the recipe. I don't even own an 8x8 pan. If you don't like cakey brownies, cut out one egg (when you double the recipe) so there are only 3. Or don't use large or extra large eggs. This is a basic good brownie recipe."
"2","5","love this recipe. everything done from the stove right into the pan and into the oven. thats what I call EASY!"
"2","5","Amazing recipe thank you. Personally I doubled the recipe when cooking for four as it's so popular, plenty of seconds that way!"
"2","4","Theses brownies turned out to be the best I have made. It was so moist and light. The only thing that I did not do is add the frosting, I think it was perfect without it."
"2","5","These brownies are absolutely the BEST! We always double the batch and bake in a 9x13 pan. A few tips: do not stir too much-this a common mistake people do when making brownies and it will result in cake-like brownies instead of the gooey chewie ones you were looking for; do not overbake, they will finish cooking in the pan while they cool. These are great with or without the frosting. We usually don't frost them (mostly because I'm too lazy to make it lol) and they are plenty rich and yummy by themselves. Enjoy!"
"2","5","I doubled the recipe and made a 9x13 batch. I also skipped the frosting and just sprinkled chocolate chips over the top of it instead. They were fantastic! I will definitely make them again."
"2","5","Excellent brownie. Don't listen to the nay sayers. This is a great recipe exactly as written.  The key is not over beat the batter, only beat until all incorporated about 40 turns of the old fashioned wooden spoon. And, don't over bake. Only bake until the brownies quit jiggling when shaken, and the edges are the only part that 'look done'.   For the frosting, the ingredients are perfect...just need to adjust the technique as follows: melt (microwave is ok) the butter, add cocoa, honey, vanilla (and a touch of espresso powder). Mix that up with a spoon. Then pour it into a bowl and use the mixer to beat in powdered sugar until crumbly. Now add cream or half and half or milk a little at a time while beating until you get the consistency you like for frosting. YUMMMY!"
"2","5","I have had this recipe in my recipe box for YEARS! I made it tonight and was 'WOW'ed' This is the best brownie I have ever put in my mouth. I doubled the recipe and made in a 9x13 pan. Best idea I had all day! I think the people who didn't like them don't know how to bake. You know you spoon in flour into the measuring cup, let the butter and eggs get to room temperature, don't overmix the batter, etc. The texture is soft, gooey, out of this world! Loved them!!"
"2","5","LOVE THIS RECIPE! Tried it for the first time a few days ago, and they came out great. when we took the brownies out of the oven, though, the top wasnt very pleasant looking. We did not make the icing, because it was to much sugar for my family to handle, but they were still sweet. When we took the first bite, it LOOKED cakey, but was extremely chewy and good. Perfect for my family. Half of my family likes cakey brownies, and half like fudgy. This was the perfect compromise. They were sadly gone after one day, and I would reccomend doubling the recipe. We did not, and the batter didnt even fill up the whole pan. but when we took out the oven, the whole pan was completely filled up, and it wasnt a problem. This will be a friday night regular at out house, and it WILL stick! Thank you for this wonderful recipe, definitly try it!"
"2","5","These great brownies will be my go-to from now on. I was too lazy for the frosting, so I just sprinkled some chocolate chips on the hot brownies, allowed them to melt, and spread the chocolate around. Looking forward to trying different add-ins (maybe caramels?) and frostings for variety!"
"2","2","I followed this recipe exactly (the only thing I omitted was the vanilla since I didn't have it, so I added an equal amount of water to keep the consistency right), but these turned out very oily and butter-flavored. The consistency was okay, it was a bit cake-like, which isn't a deal breaker for me, but they smelled and tasted exclusively of butter, which was incredibly unappetizing and distracting. Not sure what happened here, or what I did differently, but they were also a light-medium brown color, not the rich dark brown in most of the pictures. Sorry, but I won't be making this again."
"2","5","I originally gave this recipe 4 stars because although I thought the brownies tasted good, I also thought they were a bit cakey.  I had to come back to change it to 5 stars because they were perfect they day after I baked them. I guess if you let them sit for awhile they eventually get that perfect brownie chew to them. I put them in the fridge overnight and omg they are so good!!"
"2","4","Good brownies!A bit too cakey for my taste (i like chewy and fudgey) but pretty good. Everyone liked them. instead of using this topping, i used a broil cream topping that i got from the 'Date Cake' recipe on this website. Yummy! thanks Angie! :)"
"2","5","I didn't even bother with the frosting and it was terrific!! Chewy, Rich,and totally chocolatey without even needing to add those baking chocolate bars! I will make this again and again; once is not enough! :) But beware, the brownie doesn't really look done when it actually does; so don't increase the baking time, or they'll be hard and tough. Also, mix them by hand; you don't want the mixer to make the egg fluffy: that's what makes brownies different from cakes!"
"2","5","Made exactly as shown. So fudgy!"
"2","4","VERY easy to make. Mine came out a touch eggy, and a touch too sweet, so not a perfect brownie for me. Still, the pan was gobbled up very quickly - a not-perfect brownie is still good!  UPDATED: Changed things slightly and the result is 4 stars. 1/2 cup cocoa and not quite a full cup of sugar, and I baked a little longer which removed the egginess of my first gooey slightly underdone batch.  As others said, if you want cakiness then stir, if you want denseness then fold until just barely is a batter. Simple, easy, and a great base - add extracts for flavor (I added 1/4 t raspberry) or nuts, marshmallows, etc."
"2","5","Awesome!! I cud make brownies tooo!! First time making brownies n can't believe they turned out great..so moist n fudgy n yumm yumm... The only thing was a bit too sweet, nxt time will cut down on the sugar. Thanx allrecipes."
"2","4","Soooooo yummy! I followed recipe exactly and hand stirred it as some suggested. It was not cakey at all, but soft and chewy and gooey, just like a brownie should be. I only gave it four stars because I did not like the frosting. Instead of complimenting the brownie, it overpowered it. But otherwise, really good."
"2","4","I made these for a party and got rave reviews. They were very easy to make and very tasty. The only issue I had is that when I followed the recipe for the frosting, I got more of a crumb topping than a smooth frosting. So I just added about a teaspoon of milk and it smoothed right out. The frosting also gets better if you apply it to the brownies while warm as the recipe suggests. Overall, a good recipe."
"2","5","Amazing brownies. I used the exact same recipe just doubled the quantity and I threw some semi sweet chocolate chips and the brownies turned out great. I am simply in love with these brownies and I definitely will be making them again."
"2","5","These brownies bake up perfectly and the recipe is very easy to follow for your first try at from scratch. They are very cake like (and good that way). To make them gooey, reduce the flour from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup and it comes out perfect."
"2","4","These turned out well. However, I do recommend following Mama Cass' suggestions on the icing - melting the butter and halve the amount of powdered sugar. I followed the recipe and the icing was terrible - very dry. I saved it by adding more melted butter."
"2","5","These were very tasty. I whipped these up in no time when my step-son was asking for brownies after dinner one day. This is my 3rd time making brownies from scratch (I've decided to go scratch from now on! no more boxed mixes) and the first two attempts tasted good but didn't look great. These came out looking and tasting amazing! I like how they taste great straight from the oven and the next day! boxed mixes really only taste good the next day.   Having said that I did do things a bit different. I mixed 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar in a medium mixing bowl, in separate container I used an electric hand blender to beat the eggs and added the vanilla on top of the eggs (not mixed in) and in another small container I mixed the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Then I melted the butter in the microwave, poured it over the sugar mixture and added the eggs and vanilla and stirred it all together, then added all the flour mixture at once and stirred just until combined. I guess 3rd times a charm! This recipe is a keeper!"
"2","5","Delicious! Easy! I mixed the sugar into the melted butter and lightly whisked the eggs with a fork before adding. I mixed the other dry ingredients together before adding into the butter mixture then mixed just enough that everying was wet - as suggested by reviewers here. Turned out perfect - not too cakey, not tooo gooey, crunchy in the right places. I didn't make the frosting. Instead I topped it with a dusting of powdered sugar and mint chocolate chip ice cream for a pretty and decadent dessert. Will definitely make again! Next time I might try other reviewer's healthy substitutes."
"2","5","These are really the best brownies. The frosting is too sweet for me, but that's just personal taste. If you don't typically like frosting on your brownies, don't put it on. Next time I will maybe put a sprinkle of powdered sugar on them. I also use Special Dark cocoa. It makes all the difference in baking chocolate desserts."
"2","5","REALLY the BEST! My families recipe for brownies since 2009. I wish they would remove the recipe, so everyone in the world doesn't have it! =)"
"2","1","Very Cake-like. Not Chewy at all. If you want to make chocolate cake squares, this recipe is great, but these do not have a texture like brownies. The batter is much thinner than the video shows as well."
"2","5","Love these! Used oil instead of butter as a personal preference and will double the recipe next time as I like a thicker brownie and these were thin in an 8x8 pan. Just stir ingredients together for a wonderful result."
"2","5","OMG! These brownies were perfect! Fudgey, thick, moist and not cake-like at all. I mixed all my dry ingredients first and then added in the wet. I added a touch more cocoa, a touch less sugar and a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips! To die for! The best brownies ever!!!! Simple to make! No more box mixes for me! These are totally the best brownies ever!!!"
"2","5","I have made these brownies many times since finding this recipe. They are always a hit! The frosting always seemed to be a bit of a challenge as it did get very stiff and was difficult to spread. Today I melted the butter and then added the honey and vanilla. I sifted together the icing sugar and cocoa and then gradually added it to the liquid. It was a bit thick near the end but a dribble of milk made it smooth. I spread the frosting on very quickly while the brownies were still hot. Worked out perfectly!"
"2","5","I made these for a small dinner party and got rave reviews! So easy to make! The frosting is the easiest frosting I've ever made and it came together very quickly. I usually use cooking spray on my pans but followed the recipe and buttered/floured the pan and it still stuck a bit. But the brownie was fudgy and delicious!! I didn't change a thing!"
"2","5","I would like to suggest that if you get a result with which you are less than happy, try again. Tip #1: KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT! If your oven tends to run hot, lower the temp. If you are using a dark non-stick pan, lower the temp. If you've been using beaters, try mixing by hand. This can really apply to any recipe...too often people rate a recipe given the results that they achieved, but they should really be giving it a second chance before just moving on. Tip #2: The end result of a recipe is merely a matter of opinion! If it's not your cup o' tea, just say so and move on.  All that said, great recipe!!! These were somewhere in between fudgy and cakey (more fudgy, in my mind). I have always been someone who loves box mix brownies; I don't know why--my mom always made everything from scratch, but for some reason I just prefer box-mix brownies. In spite of that, however, I found that I LOVED these sooooo much. I've made them 3 ways: as is, without the frosting, and with chocolate chips sprinkled in them; all were delicious, though I prefer them without the frosting and with chocolate chips.  Also, I think you really must let them cool completely. Their flavor is stronger after cooling than eating them straight from the oven. Plus, if you use chocolate chips, then they re-harden and you get a little crunch.  That's my two cents! In my opinion brownies don't get much better than this!"
"2","5","Best. Brownies. Ever. Skipped the frosting and dumped in about a half cup of peanut butter/chocolate chips. Soooooo good."
"2","5","I finished these off in 2 days. 2 DAYS. These were such great brownies and the frosting made it even better! Reminded me of a cosmic brownie.. but better! They are soft, chewy rich chocolate brownies that you will not stop eating when you take a bite! Only advice: make sure it's a small pan!"
"2","3","I felt like these weren't very chocolate-y, and they weren't as fudgy as I'd like. The came out somewhat dry. I would recommend not melting the butter, just using soft butter, to anyone who wants to try this recipe."
"2","2","This recipe was entirely too buttery. The butter took over all the flavor and created a greasy feeling while eating them. In addition, they weren't a very chocolatey brownie. I followed a previous review that recommended beating the eggs before adding them to make sure you don't have a cake brownie, despite this they were very cake-like. I don't know why we had such bad luck with this recipe but we probably won't make it again."
"2","5","Life changing! Who knew scratch brownies are sooo much better than the box? While the frosting isn't my favorite on it's own, it works with the rest of the recipe. I followed the double batch -1 egg for a 9x13 pan w/greased parchment paper, added chocolate chips and baked 35 mins exactly. Doubled frosting but only 1C total powdered sugar to make made something between frosting and glaze. It set nicely; final addition was chocolate sprinkles. Hardest part was not to overdose by eating too many at once. Amazing and super easy!"
"2","5","I've made these brownies a few times now, and they are a tremendous hit with my coworkers and family members. I double the recipe, because I know they'll disappear pretty quickly. I also add a little milk to the frosting - just enough to get the consistency I want for the frosting. Fantastic recipe! Will be a go-to for years to come, no doubt."
"2","5","Everyone said that these were the best brownies they had ever eaten! I also loved how easy the recipe was."
"2","5","So easy and quick to make! I will be making this quite often for those times when there just 'needs' to be dessert after dinner. We like it best warm from the oven with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","best brownies i have ever made!!!! love them!!!"
"2","5","These brownies are amazing. They are easily the best ones I've ever made. After 25 minutes they were perfectly baked and tasted absolutely delicious. Not too overwhelmingly sweet too, unlike many other brownies."
"2","5","really good!!!! I used a 10 inch pan so they were a flatter. when I put the topping on them !! they became so gooey and delicious!!! i love brownies that have the same amout of topping as their is brownie it has a much richer taste!!"
"2","5","I didn't even frost these, and they were AMAZING! I doubled the recipe to fit a 9'x13' pan, and the group of boys here for a playdate (ages 3-9) and the 3 moms ate all but 4 brownies! They deserve the name 'best brownies'! Enjoy!"
"2","5","Ok, picky picky, these are great brownies, but not the BEST brownies I have ever eaten. Things I liked about them were the ease and the use of cocoa powder. I don't always have semi-sweet chocolate on hand, but nearly always have cocoa. It gets good marks for that. Also, I was a bit hesitant about the honey in the frosting as I chortled it seemed like some sort of nostalgia chocolate candy recipe from the 50s. In the end, the honey really gave the brownies something extra and the taste was very pleasant. Lovely brownies, although I probably still would rate Linda's Awesome Brownies higher on the brownie scale. I agree with others that they are really not like brownies in their consistency, but definitely satisfy the sweet tooth and chocolate cravings! Added walnuts. Doubled recipe. Put frosting on right out of the oven which clumped, then smoothed out very well. Will make again."
"2","2","First I'd like to say I made these EXACTLY as directed, absolutely no changes were made. Any suggestions I make are strictly based on what I suspect would work based on other reviews. These brownies weren't tragic, but they weren't good, either. 'Best' is certainly in the eye of the beholder, and this beholder calls foul. They were easy to make, which is awesome. Definitely mix them by hand, an electric or stand mixer will give you cakey brownies. A few lumps is ok with brownie batter. Definitely melt the butter for the frosting, otherwise you end up with a sort of chocolately dough that's impossible to work with. My boyfriend and I thought they had kind of an off taste. My boyfriend bit into one and announced 'It's not bad, but it doesn't taste like a brownie. Don't use this recipe again.' Indeed, not using it again."
"2","1","While these may be 'easy to whip up', they are bland. These remind me of the greasy type of moistness that is similar to a carrot or zucchini cake that has too much oil in it and leaves a film on your fingers. The texture is such that it balls up if you squeeze it, if you want to call that 'fudgy'. They look fine, but they don't have the deep chocolate flavor that I want in a brownie. I have yet to find my idea of a best brownie made with cocoa rather than baking chocolate. I will stick to my current 2 favorite recipes that I have made for years. I will continue to limit my cocoa use to cake recipes. The Frosting: I made 1/3 of the frosting recipe, and although it needed a teaspoon or so of water to thin, it made a nice, albeit sweet, drizzle type frosting that firmed up and provided a needed accent in that small amount."
"2","5","These brownies really are the best in my opinion. they are just as easy as a box and taste even better. My husband didnt like them as much because they have a dense texture i guess but it is exactly my type of brownie! I have made it 3 times and about to make them again right now!"
"2","5","These brownies are phenomenal. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added a tablespoon of milk to the frosting. I also cut down on the powdered sugar to 2/3 cup. It poured over nice and smooth and when it set, it was the perfect consistency and not too sweet. These are the only brownies I will be making from now on."
"2","3","The flavour of these brownies is really good, but I ended up with dry sort of cakey brownies even though I doubled the recipe & used a 10x8' pan. Odd - this was just based on the brownie though, as I did not make the icing."
"2","3","These are very, very sweet, and not at all cake-like. They do remind me of fudge, especially because of the icing, but do not have an intense chocolately flavor. These I made exactly as directed, removed from oven at 25 minutes, put the frosting - which is very thick, on top in little pieces a few minutes after taking the brownies out, then spread it as it melts. However, for a more chocolatey, chewy classic brownie - my favorite is 'Brooke's bombshell brownies' on this site."
"2","5","Amazing! Chewy, not overly sweet but definitely sweet enough. I doubled the recipe and baked in a Perfect Brownie pan. They definitely turned out perfect! The only change I made was to the frosting. Just added a tiny splash of milk to help smooth it out and make it easier to spread."
"2","5","Not too 'cakey' and not too 'fudgey,' right in between. The perfect brownie recipe!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly but my square pan was dirty so I used a 9 inch round. These were amazing & fudgey!! We will never buy boxed brownies again. Oh, I didn't make the frosting. They didn't need it."
"2","5","I skipped the frosting and still these were the best homemade brownies ever!"
"2","5","Not overly sweet at all. I normally use a mixer but did not want cake like brownies, so did it by hand. I am thinking if people got cake like brownies, this may be why. Do not overbeat or over cook. I didn't even use the toothpick because I would have left them in longer. I didn't get a dense over sweet brownie, but a lighter brownie, fudgelike and a lighter density. I did add 1/4 cup of pecans to it and used oil instead of butter in the batter. I also did not try this icing yet. I had some leftover icing I wanted to use. Only problem I had was that when I went to get one out it kinda fell apart so it cannot be eaten with your hand. I will try again to see if there was something I did wrong, but they are delicious and simple."
"2","5","I enjoyed the very short ingredient list. I used this recipe to make a chocolate chip mint brownie. The only changes I did was half the vanilla and had the 1/4 tsp of mint extract and a handful of mint chocolate chips. It worked out awesome."
"2","5","This recipe is a definite keeper! I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out just right. Yum!"
"2","5","These are definitely delicious, very chocolaty and rich. Not cakey at all, but not too fudgy. They are great! Just make sure you use powdered sugar for the frosting, I made that mistake the first time and it actually tasted better, but was SO gritty you couldn't really eat it."
"2","5","These were really good."
"2","5","Too easy! I can't believe I've been buying boxes of brownie mix when these are so easy and leagues above a box full of ingredients I can't pronounce. Thank you for posting this, my family thinks I'm super cool b/c I bake my brownies from 'scratch'. It will be our little secret~"
"2","5","so good! omg seriously its MELT IN YOUR MOUTH! remeber dont over bake just bake 24 min and definitely make the frosting too! i gave one to a guy i like and he's coming back for more!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","This really is the best brownie recipe I have found and I am quite the baker at home and when I came across this and discovered I had all the ingredients in my pantry that was awesome.  It got rave reviews by all the teenagers that ate them."
"2","5","Added chocolate chips. Next time try pecans too. Frosting is good, subbed corn syrup for honey."
"2","5","Wow. These are amazing. I didn't use the frosting called for here because I have my own chocolate glaze recipe I use time and time again without fail for lots of things, but I did use the brownie recipe exactly as written here. I doubled it in a 9X13 and baked for exactly 25 minutes. Outside was slightly crisp and inside was soft and chewy. I did also add walnuts. I'm keeping the recipe for anytime I want to make brownies, in my opinion no other I've tried comes as close to perfect as this one."
"2","4","This is a great recipe for fudge-y brownies, as long as you don't overcook them. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, used 3 eggs instead of 4, skipped the frosting, & added 3/4cup choc. chips for my chocoholic mom, & took them out 2 min early. They were still a little mushy, but I kept them in the fridge & they turned out great. They def. taste different from your typical box brownies, but much better in my opinion."
"2","4","Very good and easy to make. Not unbelievable."
"2","1","I made these brownies to the exact recipe!!!! Mine were hard and Cakey. Still in search of great brownie recipe"
"2","4","Great brownies and easy to make."
"2","5","I turned these into Reese's Brownies for my mothers birthday because that's her favourite treat. Just melt some peanut butter and pour it over your brownie batter when it is in the pan. I did that then it all seeped in perfectly for the bottom layer of the cake. For the icing of the cake I just striped it across all decoratively when it was done cooking, with some melted chocolate too."
"2","5","Absolutely perfect as written. Thank you for the great recipe!"
"2","4","These were a little too sweet for my liking (almost a little sickly sweet), and I think I'll try cutting the sugar down to 3/4 cup next time. I did not make the frosting, as I'm not a huge frosting fan. I substituted the butter with applesauce and they turned out well.. more cakelike than fudgey, but I'm not super picky on brownie consistency.  Overall a good, quick recipe that prevents you from eating the boxed processed stuff!"
"2","5","AWESOME!"
"2","4","My family adores these brownies...way better than boxed mix. I've never had the recipe fail me yet. I don't add the frosting, but if you want a delicious homemade brownie recipe, this one is fantastic."
"2","5","These were soooo yummy!! I brought them to a Super Bowl party and everyone loved them. I was really impressed with how they came out and will NEVER buy a boxed brownie mix again. They are so easy to make and I typically have all the ingredients needed to make them, so I can whip them up anytime. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and slightly beat the eggs before adding to the melted butter and stirred in the dry ingredients just until everything was blended and my brownies came out moist, fudgy and perfect! These are definitely the best homemade brownies ever!"
"2","4","I used half barley flour and half white flour. Rich, moist and decadent!"
"2","5","These were great. I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan. I then omitted 1 egg to make fudgier brownies. I did not use te recipe frosting . . I used my own brownie frosting: 8 tablespoons butter 2 cups confectioners sugar 2 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa  THE BEST brownies!!"
"2","5","wow these are amazing! but the thing is that my oven is exact temp. and i ended up cooking them for 45 min it happens alot overall very good and tasty!"
"2","5","I will never use another brownie recipe ever again. these are truly amazing, HEAVEN ON EARTH!!!! I knew they were going to be delicious when I licked off the spatula before baking for 25 min. OOOHHH MY. These are a must!!!!!!!"
"2","3","Over all they were ok. I prefer brownies that are super moist and dense."
"2","3","I followed the recipe exactly, and while the flavor of these brownies is good, they're more like a moist chocolate cake. I didn't care for the frosting and didn't use if on the brownies. I will keep searching for a chewy, fudgy brownie recipe."
"2","1","Followed the recipe exactly. Did not care for the flavor or texture. I am one who tries to make everything I can from scratch to avoid preservatives and 'fake' food ingredients, but brownies may be the one exception where the box variety just tastes better. Either way - boxed or from scratch - you are still ingesting a large amount of white refined sugar and flour and butter, none of which are good for you no matter how you look at it, so I say if you're going to eat brownies just go for the boxed kind and repent later. :)"
"2","5","Very Good."
"2","5","These really are the best brownies. Everybody I've made them for says so. The only problem I have is that the frosting is always too sticky, and I end up having to add a dash or so of milk to get it to the right consistency."
"2","4","I opted to do a marble-cheesecake type topping instead of the frosting in this recipe. I may have over-mixed the batter as mine came out more cake-y than fudge-y though I only baked slightly over 20mins. No biggie, my boys will be thrilled for this treat when they get back."
"2","5","These are so good. I will no longer buy box mix!"
"2","3","Wowzers! Super sweet and rich. Made as directed. The brownie itself is good, just very sweet. The icing didn't work out for me. I couldn't get a good consistency. My brownies looked like crapola after I tried to ice them.. lol. Next time I'll use less sugar and won't bother with the icing. These were also much better a few hours later when they were cooled. A good easy go to brownie recipe minus the icing!"
"2","5","Incredible! I didn't do the frosting and made it in a muffin tin and added crushed candy canes to the top for the last 5 or so minutes of baking. So good!"
"2","5","Extremely Chocolatey!!! Is just like the brownies that is used in Braums brownie sundaes..."
"2","5","Love this recipe. Super easy and they turn out great every time!"
"2","5","Incredibly easy one-bowl recipe; plus it's done really quickly. I reduced the sugar by about 20g because I don't like my desserts too sweet, and added a splash of whiskey in place of the vanilla and I got boozey brownies. These brownies are more cakey than fudgey too."
"2","4","These are much better if they are allowed to cool/settle for a day. They were too grainy after a 4-hour cool time."
"2","5","Moist, chocolatey and rich. These are really good. They are not quite the traditional brownie flavor I am used to, tastes more like fudge interestingly enough, but they are still absolutely delicious. This recipe is a keeper."
"2","5","Delish! Sooo hard to resist! And the frosting, it's to die for!"
"2","3","They were nice and gooey, but to make the frosting my dad and I had to melt it over a pot of boiling water in a metal bowl, because it was just powder with the butter solid."
"2","5","Great recipe... with a few modifications. First, DO NOT use an electric mixer. Mix everything with a wooden spoon. Second, bake at a little lower than 350. I doubled the recipe and baked a 9x13 pan of them at 340 for 25 minutes and they came out moist and delicious. As for the frosting, I tripled the recipe, melted the butter, and halved the powdered sugar (so I used 9 tablespoons of butter and 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar). It came out as kind of a fluffy semi-sweet frosting. If you like dark chocolate, you will like it this way. Frost them while they are warm.  I hope this helps! :)  I will definitely be making these again."
"2","1","I thought they tasted cheap and not good. Just depends what kind of brownies you like."
"2","5","The best brownies doesn't do justice to these awesome recipe. This is the first brownie recipe i have found here that didn't turn to cake when i made them. Also follow the reviewer before me's advice on how not to turn them to cake and get dense brownies, for those of you who have problems with them becoming cake. I did this and they worked out amazing for me"
"2","3","I just made these and it is NOT the best brownie. I've eaten a far better brownie than this. If not for the icing, it was would have been a little dry. It did make it tasty. I however followed a lot of tips from several reviewers: doubled the recipe to better fit a 9 by 13 pan; tried not to overmix; used a fork to make the icing; added a few tbsp of milk to the icing. In short, it almost tasted like chocolate cake with icing instead of a brownie."
"2","5","Easy and yummy. And that's without the icing. Probably even better with icing."
"2","5","I only made the brownies (not the frosting) and they were DELICIOUS. The chocolate flavor was amazing. Will definitely make again."
"2","4","I made these yesterday with a few altercations. I really liked the Cappuccino Brownies but one of the reviewers said these were better and to just add instant expresso. So that is what I did! Unfortunately I did overcook them a bit but they are really, really good. I also used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder so they were even more chocolatety! I am a dark-chocolateholic! I will not overcook them next time and there will be a next time!"
"2","5","Amazing! I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan. I also didn't put coco powder in the frosting, instead I put in some mint extract. Delicious!"
"2","5","Very good brownie recipe! I added a little milk to the frosting and it turned out perfectly."
"2","5","The only brownies I make! Delish!"
"2","3","They were just okay, not the chewy density I was hoping for."
"2","5","These are GREAT!! A little on the sweet side but a real hit at our party!! I cut them into tiny bite sized pieces so the sweetness was fine! I agree with a previous post, stir gently and don't get too much air into them or they will turn out cakey! I LOVE these and have given the recipe to many people!"
"2","5","Holy crow! Halved the recipe and didn't frost. Made them in a muffin pan and they're phenomenal. Moist, sweet, and fudgy. Outsides crisped nicely, just enough to make them really chewy!"
"2","5","I think these brownies are delicious. I didn't make the frosting, and the brownies themselves are moist and the perfect amount of sweet."
"2","5","I made these for company. I doubled all ingredients and put them into a 9x13' pan and they were excellent and got rave reviews. The only things that I did differently were: Instead of foil I put a tiny bit of oil on my pan bottom and sides, then used parchment paper which I also lightly oiled. No problem what so ever with sticking.  The other thing instead of making icing/frosting all I did was sift some powder sugar over them. Oh and yes, I did add walnuts! Super recipe and all made in one bowl - microwaved the butter to soften - added the sugar - beat in the eggs followed by the other ingredients. I used a plain old wooden spoon. I hope this helps!  Debbie"
"2","5","I love this brownie recipe. It is super easy to make and tastes absolutely amazing. As many other users have stated, do not over mix the batter. I do not use a mixer. All by hand is the way to go with this recipe. (try throwing some toffee pieces into the batter) yum!"
"2","3","A little on sweet side, too thin. I had gotten one of those brownie pans as a gift and was excited to make a batch with my new pan so I went with this recipe based on review. The pan was smaller than it looked from the box so I figured with the amount of batter I had they would be nice and big.... I was wrong. I didn't do the frosting. They were ok but I have a MUCH better brownie recipe I'll stick to."
"2","5","I am rating the brownies only because I did not make the frosting. These were delicious, melt-in-your-mouth, hurry-up-and-eat-the-whole-pan-before-the-family-gets-home-because-I-cannot-share-these amazing brownies. I made a couple more batches for my daughter's bday treat at school and the entire 3rd grade class raved about them! Plus it was so simple and easy to make even with my family's dietary restrictions it is nice as a mom to say 'Yes!' to something as delicious as these."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly and since it calls to bake them for 25-30 minutes, i checked them at 25 minutes and they were not done in the middle so I let them bake for 2 more minutes and took them out. I didnt want to over bake and have the edges turn out overdone and hard like so many of my brownies do. I should have let them bake another minute or so because the middle was still not completely done. Tasted great though!!"
"2","5","Great brownies! ALMOST as good as boxed brownies! :) I took the advice of previous reviewers, and tried not to stir these much. I more or less 'folded' the ingredients together, until just combined. The end result: Thick/Dense, chewey brownies! Not really cakey...not really fudgey, either. Just dense, very moist brownies. I think next time, I'm going to try substituting vegetavle oil for butter, though..."
"2","5","These are really good! I followed the directions exactly except for adding a drop of orange extract with the vanilla in the frosting. I followed one reviewer's suggestion to NOT use a mixer and the batter went together just fine--I used a small wisk. Also, if the brownies are still warm (or closer to hot) as directed, the frosting will spread just fine without having to be thinned and without melting the butter. I will definitely be adding these to my recipe box--permanently! May even print a copy--just to be safe. :)"
"2","4","Brownie is awesome, ended up scraping frosting off. I cant stop eating the browie though! Will definitly make again and again, just without the frosting."
"2","5","Perfect! This, from now on, will be my go-to brownie recipe. I love that it is a one pan dessert! Not to mention they were so fudgey but not too sweet!"
"2","5","these brownies were great best recipe that i ever had for brownies thanks!!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I make this using Hershey's Cocoa. I did not use the icing recipe as listed but used Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Frosting recipe that is on the side of the cocoa container. I halved the frosting recipe and it was perfect. I frosted the brownies while they were still warm and topped with some walnuts. Will be making this again and again!!! Better than the box kind."
"2","4","These brownies are pretty awesome. The brownie part is definitely five stars - rich, moist, fudgy and great chocolate flavor. I didn't care for the frosting as much. I had to add some milk to make it spreading consistency and the next day it was quite crumbly and grainy. I did add some mini chocolate chips I had leftover from another recipe, which was a great addition. I probably will make this recipe again, but use a different frosting recipe with it."
"2","5","YES...these are the BEST BROWNIES that I have had in a long time, and soooo simple to make too! I usually get lazy and just use a box mix, but I had none on hand and I really wanted to make some for my hubby. I went w/ this recipe because I've heard a lot of good things about them on 'the buzz', and they lived up to everything I've heard! These are perfectly chocolatey, chewy and delicious! I did not use the frosting recipe because hubby likes them w/o and I was making these for him, so..., but I did throw a handful of mini chcoclate chips into the batter just before baking. I baked mine in an 11x7 pan, and that seems to be the perfect thickness for us. I don't know that I would buy another box mix again...this was just as easy to put together, tasted waaaay better and it was homemade! I will be using this recipe very often! Thanks for sharing. :)"
"2","3","The brownies were good but I didn't care for the texture of the frosting. It was stiff and grainy."
"2","5","Very good and very chocolaty! The family loved them. I did add a tablespoon or 2 of milk to the frosting mix because when I tried to mix it together it stayed powder."
"2","5","I've made these tons of times and love them! The honey in the icing really gives it a good flavor and it's also something i've found works nicely in other types of icings also."
"2","5","Super easy and very yummy... if only I had more eggs I would make another batch! lol"
"2","5","Best recipe for brownies!! So easy and cheap to make! I even bought the candy coated chocolate chips to top them. Nothing beats a fresh brownie! I hope I never have to buy the store bought again!"
"2","4","These were pretty good brownies but more cakey than I expected. I added powdered sugar to the top instead of frosting so it wasn't as rich tasting."
"2","5","Best way to describle this one is 'blows your socks off'. Even better when cooled and heated in microwave a la mode."
"2","5","doubled for a 9x13 pan, don't even need the frosting. sprinkled on a few chocolate chips and they're great!"
"2","4","Good Brownie recipe. Made it for my sisters birthday and everyone loved it! I made a few tweaks. Instead of a 1/2 cup butter I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 extra virgin olive oil. For the frosting I only used 1/2 Powdered sugar and added 1/2 cup cream cheese. Yum!"
"2","5","A very easy and quick recipe to satisfy you and your family's chocolate cravings!"
"2","3","These were okay. They were cake-like (which I don't mind since I enjoy them this way or more fudgy). What I wasn't impressed by was the actual taste. I feel they were very one dimensional."
"2","4","These are great! I've made them a couple times now. My experience is that there is a definite difference in texture when you melt the butter in the saucepan instead of just softening in the microwave. Melting it in the saucepan and following the directions exactly makes for a dense fudgy brownie. Just softening in the microwave and adding the ingredients made for a more cakelike brownie. Both very good, though!"
"2","2","Easy, few ingredients, no melting of chocolate required...accurate statements for this recipe. Best?? Ummmm, no. Not fudgey, not gooey, not special...also accurate statements for this recipe."
"2","5","Very good. I would make again."
"2","5","Just like bakery brownies! I thought I had done something wrong with the frosting, but it turned out great - I just used some plastic wrap to push the frosting out across the brownies!"
"2","1","i followed your recipe exact the brownies were not the best ive had or made im sorry to say, they were odd.. but good try!"
"2","2","These are pretty cakey and not really sweet at all. I made exactly as directed and I wasn't impressed."
"2","5","Very good brownies! Followed the recipe and they turned out perfect. I see what people are saying when they describe these as cake-like. I think the frosting is the best part, but the brownie part is good too! If you are looking for strictly fudgey brownies, these aren't it, but if you're looking for a brownie that people will remember, this is it!"
"2","3","Not a bad recipe brownies tasted good..."
"2","5","The perfect brownie. For those who didn't like the frosting, try sprinkling some chocolate chips on top just after they come out of the oven. After they melt spread like a frosting. It is a good finishing touch without being too sweet. Very easy and little clean-up."
"2","3","The frosting is really good, I did have to add a small splash of water to it though to make it smooth and spreadable. As for the brownies, I wasn't a huge fan, but I think I just prefer my brownies a bit cake-ier. I will for sure be using the frosting again and again!"
"2","3","I'd give these 2.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I'll be nice. I wish I thought these were the best brownies. They're OK, but God, it would have been easier and tastier for me to run to the store and pick up some Entenmann's brownies. Also, 16 servings?? What?! This makes 16 servings if you consider one serving to be a brownie the size of a quarter."
"2","2","Attempted to make brownies, got a thin chocolate cake instead."
"2","5","the first time i made these, i didn't wait for them to cool in the pan, and they were more like cake pieces. the second time, i let them cool in the pan and they were SPECTACULAR! gooey and perfect - yum."
"2","4","A little gooey/messy, but really delicious. Very rich."
"2","5","Love the honey in the frosting!"
"2","4","Very good, simple recipe (and only required ingredients I usually have on hand and not terribly labor intensive). They were a little 'cakey', but I tend to like my brownies this way, so no worries. The frosting was thick so I added just a splash of milk - will make again and again. Serve warm with milk :)"
"2","5","This was great. I would have to agree with those who said this is more of a 'cake' texture rather than the brownie texture. My husband wasn't quite sure what they were when he found them on the counter(I was out grocery shopping) but his response when I got home was 'I don't care what they heck they are, you can make them ANYTIME!'"
"2","5","The name says it all. The frosting is really good as well but I found that the brownies were just fine without the frosting."
"2","5","I had to be a bit skeptical about a recipe called 'best,' but these babies actually live up to their name. I have made them twice now, the first time with canned chocolate frosting and the second time as the base for a homemade ice cream cake. This is my new go-to brownie recipe."
"2","5","Use 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter. Definitely make the frosting; use only 1/2 cup powdered sugar."
"2","5","My husband and I don't like brownies. We always had an easy time passing them up when we were offered them while we were on a diet. I decided to make brownies for a girlfriend that had gotten sick so I employed my husband to make the icing while I baked the brownies. I always try at least one bite of my food to make sure I'm not going to poison anyone... And, Oh. My. God. These are the best tasting things I've ever had in my life. My husband felt the same way. These brownies made us brownie lovers."
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I made these tonight and the family went wild. They are super chocolatey and rich; just the way I like them. Also, they're so good you don't really need the icing/frosting on them. Just top with ice cream and you're good to go."
"2","3","I thought these brownies were very good and the recipe easy. I took someone's suggestion and did not use my mixer but instead whipped it by hand, being especially careful not to over mix after adding the dry ingredients. By doing so, I did not get 'cakey' brownies as some have complained of. Next time I will omit the icing as these brownies are really sweet enough without it."
"2","5","I love this brownie. I made a double batch but only frosted one. I preferred the ones without frosting and am baking another batch for a picnic tonight. Yum."
"2","5","These were the best brownies I have ever had! I made a double batch and baked them for 35 mintues. I did not use the frosting, but they were fantastic without. The entire pan was gone within 2 hour eaten by my husband and two sons. Like others have said...secret is to not overmix the batter. Will add dried cherries and nuts next time which will be tonight for footall party tomorrow."
"2","4","This is a great recipe! The brownies melt-in-your mouth! :) My family loves when I make them!"
"2","5","I loved these... 1st time I made them I screwed up and used baking soda instead of powder, completely my fault, so it didn't rise correctly but still tasted delicious. Made it again and came out perfectly. These are a very dense brownie which I prefer and the frosting is perfect."
"2","5","No more box brownie mix for me! These are so good and easy! I mix it all by hand and as mentioned, don't over-mix or you'll get a more cake-like brownie. Did not try the frosting since I use a peanut butter variation: 1 c. creamy p. butter, 1 c. powdered sugar, 5 Tblsps. softened butter, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and enough half & half or heavy cream to get a creamy consistency...beat all together and frost the brownies when cooled...honestly, you'll be tempted to eat and eat!!! I always double the recipe and bake in a 9 x 13 pan...using my gas oven's air bake cycle they are perfectly baked in 18 minutes...enjoy!!"
"2","3","The recipe is just ok for me. Brownies came too dry if you ask me."
"2","5","Very easy and oh so yummy! I received nothing but compliments on these."
"2","4","I liked that I had the ingredients on hand to make these brownies. They were moist and chocolaty, but a little too fudge-like for my tastes.  But if you like fudge brownies, you'll enjoy these."
"2","5","These brownies are so EASY and so delicious, I can't imagine why anyone would make them from a box. I made these for my cousin and she absolutely loved them. They are flaky and beautiful on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. I greased my pan with butter and flour and baked for just under 25 minutes. I can't rate the frosting because we didn't make it or use it. These are great on their own! Delicious!"
"2","4","Although the recipe was delicious, the brownies didn't rise well at all. I basically ended up with relatively flat brownies, which was kind of disappointing."
"2","5","Wow fantastic! ty"
"2","1","I used an egg replacement instead of eggs, and I didn't both using the icing. The brownies didn't rise at all! And when they came out, they were dripping butter! I followed the recipe exactly and was thoroughly disappointed."
"2","5","Wow, I am super impressed - I had a piece still warm and then about 20 minutes later had another piece....so gooey, it was perfect! These were amazing! I added some chopped walnuts on top of icing! I saved this recipe for the future! This will replace my other recipe! Yummy!"
"2","5","My fiance was looking for something a little more chewy but I thought these were great (and yes I took them out early). I added raspberry extract and raspberries to mix and it was super delicious. Icing was delicious also! Thanks for posting! :)"
"2","5","This is a delicious brownie recipe! I doubled it and baked it for thirty minutes in a 9x13 inch pan. I melted the topping, and used half the amount of sugar like suggested, and mixed it with a wooden spoon. It didn't come out too cakey or too hard. It's not horrible sweet, and the topping isn't too heavy. I found my new brownie recipe! Amazing and very easy to make! Thank you!"
"2","5","Quick. Easy. Delicious! Followed exactly but I might reduce the vanilla in the frosting next time."
"2","5","The frosting was the best part. I'm not sure what the problem was with so many people. These were good if you like the flavor of cocoa. I will make again for sure."
"2","4","These aren't fudgey brownies like I was looking for, but one pan was not enough! I live in a house of choco-holics and they loved these brownies. I'm still looking for a more fudgey brownie recipe but this still was a great find!"
"2","5","These were amazing"
"2","4","These brownies turned out awesome. I used a perfect brownie pan to bake them in. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the frosting. I was very confused. I ended up with a dry mess. It slowly got more wet as the butter melted but I ended up adding about two more tbsp in order to get it to a reasonable consistency. Then I added the frosting to a pampered chef decorater and put it in the fridge until the brownies were done. I frosted the brownies while they were warm (picture included) with the decorator and put a few sprinkles on. As the frosting warmed it started to glisten. Very pretty and very good. I may never buy box brownies again. Next time I may add chocolate chunks to the batter just to make them more chocolatey!! Love these!"
"2","5","AweSOME!"
"2","5","I used this recipe to make brownie-filled cupcakes! They turned out AMAZING, and set perfect even with cupcake batter on the top."
"2","5","Even without the frosting this is the best brownie ever! I softened the butter and mixed everything in the mixer turning it off and on so it wouldn't beat the eggs too much making it too cakey. I also added about 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips which helps to satisfy my chocolate brownie craving!!! I will never buy brownie mix again!!! Thanks for this recipe!!!"
"2","5","These really are the BEST brownies. Just made some today and my 9 yo said we should only make these from now on. They are not cakey or fudgey, they are kind of in between, and just perfect. We didn't make the frosting, just the brownies."
"2","5","It's true, they do turn out great every time! And they're very easy to make."
"2","4","These were good brownies, next time I will skip the icing as it made them too sweet."
"2","3","Meh. Wouldn't qualify this as a brownie as it was more fudgelike. There was absolutely no lift to the 'brownie' layer, so it was quite flat. Wouldn't bother with this one again."
"2","5","Very tasty! The trick to the frosting is a)MELT the butter all the way, not just softened; and b) make right before you frost--don't let them sit out. I used a little extra honey as well."
"2","5","awesome i have looked all over trying to come close to the box kind and this has met the approval by all in my house :)...i cant comment on the frosting as i didnt make that i just sprinkled with powder sugar but they were AWESOME :)"
"2","5","These brownies are WONDERFUL! The best from scratch brownies I have ever made. Super moist, soft, chewy, and the chocolate flavor's on spot!! My family ate a double batch in on evening!  I normally take my cookies/brownies out a minute or two before the recommended time because the timing normally makes the edges hard, but these are fine for the whole 25mins. Will makes these brownies again, again, and again :)"
"2","5","These brownies are AMAZING!! I tried to make the frosting -- twice -- and they turned out clumpy. So what I did was I made the 'Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting' on this site, and they turned out SUPER!!!!!"
"2","5","SOOOO GOOD!!"
"2","5","Great! Frosted with a powdered sugar/peanut butter frosting. Nice 'light' contrast to the brownie."
"2","1","I did not care for this."
"2","5","PERFECT! I've made them twice already, and plan to make a LOT more! They're so fudgy! Definately recommened"
"2","5","These were amazing! I had everything on hand already. Very easy to make and taste great. I made them with the frosting recipe listedand it was good but I think next time going to use my chocolate moose frosting on them. Will be my go to for brownies!"
"2","5","This brownie recipe adapted to being Gluten free better than any other. Since it only calls for 1/2 cup of flour, I just substituted 1/2 of gluten free flour (which for me was 1/4 cup of banana flour and 1/4 quinoa flour) The recipe adapted perfectly. After several experiments I decided that the frosting is best left off and I used melted chocolate only on top. I also found that the brownies are more dense and more brownie like without adding Xanthm gum."
"2","4","Pretty good! I replaced the 1/2 c butter with 1/2 c nonfat greek yogurt, did one whole egg and one egg whte and kept the frosting the same. That dropped the fat per brownie to 3.5g and the calories down to 135. For that nutrition info, these are a real calorie bargain for the yummy taste!"
"2","5","Excellent. I didn't use the icing, just because I prefer brownies with no icing. So easy that I can quit buying the box mix with all those chemicals."
"2","5","best brownies ever. Even without frosting..."
"2","5","Mmmmm. These are good. I didn't even make the icing for them. Glad I took one reviewer's advice and didn't use a mixer for these. Just stirred with a wooden spoon until they were mixed. They were a little fluffier than I'm used to, but not cakey. I added a bit more salt, and more cocoa, just personal preference."
"2","5","These brownies were exceptional!! My nephew and I had so much fun making them. Everyone loved them and I had to make another batch the next day. Thank you for a wonderful recipe."
"2","4","These were great! But it just tasted too much like fudge to me, and I am not saying that fudge is a bad thing it's just that I was expecting it too be more brownie like not really fudgy."
"2","4","These were wonderful. My husband said we will never need to by a mix again. The only thing I did was I added half a bag of ghirardelli semi-sweet choco chips to the batter. Other than that I followed the directions and I did not double. I did make the frosting, which was good too, but I think it was overkill (I had the icing separate) and the reason for 4 stars. Do not over mix and if yours were flat it might be old baking powder."
"2","4","PROBLEMS? READ BELOW: These brownies are great! I initially doubled the recipe (including the eggs - batter seemed too thick with just 3 eggs), substituted 1/2 the white sugar with brown sugar and added a scant 2 cups of chocolate chips. Hand stir about 50 times (just like with a box mix) so you don't over process. I greased (but not floured) a 9x13 pan & baked in the convection oven at 325 for 29 mins. They were perfect. I dusted with powdered sugar instead of preparing the frosting. My picky 15 year old declared they were the best ever (aptly named) - even better than his beloved Ghiradelli mix brownies. HOWEVER, the next week I decided to follow the recipe & just bake a single batch in an 8x8 pan in a smaller oven at 350, & they turned out flat & not nearly as good (why the 4 stars instead of 5), so I can see why they didn't work for some folks. When they're bad, they're pretty bad. I'll just double them from now on."
"2","5","This a very good!"
"2","5","I have no good excuse to use boxed brownie mix any more. The recipe couldn't be any simpler to pull off and delicious to boot.   These brownies are the perfect combination - crusty on the outside and moist chewy on the inside. I made them without the frosting since my hubby isn't a frosting-guy. They were fine without. I added a half a bag of chocolate chips for a little extra gooey-ness."
"2","5","Definitely delicious! I couldn't believe how simple they were - everything's in the cupboard. Great recipe! BTW, didn't make the frosting, don't care for it. I'm only rating the brownies. ;)"
"2","5","very rich, decadent brownies which are easy to make. don't use a mixer - just do it all by hand. i whisked eggs before i put them in (tempered them too) and also whisked flour mixture to avoid overmixing. frost immediately and you won't be disappointed. fudgy, yummy."
"2","5","This is a no fail recipe. I am constantly asked to bring these to get togethers. Now I go armed with the link to the recipe to share! It's easy with basic ingredients. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","THESE ARE THE BEST BROWNIES IN THE WORLD LITERALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","3","I liked these brownies, but they weren't the best. Definitely not fudge-like. Somewhere in between cakey and fudgy. I'm going to keep looking for a brownie recipe that I like."
"2","5","These brownies are phenomenal. At first, I pulled them out of the oven with a look of disappointment because they just looked so...cakey. But then I cut this little piece, and they were great, just like a great homemade brownie should be.  They have a cakey exterior, but the inside is a mixture of a chewy brownie and a fudge one. I made these without the frosting and doubled to fit a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes, although it might be best to make it 28 or 27, while hand mixing, and I didn't change a single thing other than that. I used a fork to blend the eggs together but not too much to liquify it.   Very easy to make, and I will, without a doubt, make these again."
"2","5","I'm always sketchy at making homemade brownies because I have had some pretty tasteless ones....these are DELICIOUS!"
"2","4","I thought they were good, doubled the recipe and made them in a 9x13 inch pan. They were tasty and light and I did not over bake. I did not think they were the best brownie but pretty close. The guys at work thought they were but I like mine more chewy and these were kinda on the cakey side. I luved the icing, really sweet but nummmy:)"
"2","5","Fabulous, the only thing I do differently is to mix by hand, this stops the mix getting to much air and becoming cake like. I always make a double mix and don't bother with the icing, they don't need it."
"2","5","These brownies are the best even without the frosting!"
"2","1","Will not be making these again.how on earth did anyone have these stick to the pan????? mine were swimming in butter---they literally slid out of the pan if i tilted it; they have no flavor, no texture --not cakey, not fudgey, just like sand.."
"2","5","I've made these Brownies several times now, and I don't want to make any others again. They've bean a hit with everyone that's tried them."
"2","4","These were good moist and fluffy but I wouldn't call them brownies either. They were more 'Cake' like and I even mixed by hand. I forgot to cover them and the next day they did have more of a brownie texture."
"2","5","DELISH! I will never make 'box' brownies again! Super easy! I made the frosting along with the brownies and it was a ballet o' chocolate in my mouth!"
"2","5","I made these tonight for dessert they were delicious. the recipe was very easy to follow, better than any box brownie mix."
"2","5","We made them without the topping. Nice and soft, even with egg replacer."
"2","4","I doubled the recipe (used only 3 eggs as a reviewer suggested) and made it in a 9x13 pan for 35 mins. Tasted good. But corners were a bit chewy...I may have overcooked it :("
"2","5","Can substitute butter with oil. Recipe is still good. :)"
"2","5","Very good and moist!! My daughter made them and did very well! In my recipe box so I don't lose this recipe."
"2","3","I'm only giving this three stars because of the brownie portion of this recipe. It's exactly like my 'go to' recipe which is delicious so I knew there'd be no issues.  My issue is with the icing. I used softened butter as suggested but I believe it would've been better to have melted it, though I'm not entirely sure that would've totally helped the consistency. It turned into a crumbly, gloppy mess that would not mix. I had to thin it out with some warm water which helped. However, upon tasting the icing, it was WAY TOO sweet (and I am never one to shy away from things that are 'too sweet'). I suggest finding another chocolate icing recipe but as I stated above, the brownie recipe is perfect."
"2","5","I have to say this is the best brownie recipe I have ever made. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"2","5","These were very good. They were soft and chewy. I topped them with the frosting and it really did put them over the top, and I am not the frosted brownie kind of person. This is my new go to recipe."
"2","4","these brownies are good. I made them with the white sugar like it called for, then I made a batch with brown sugar and they tasted better. I didn't have enough butter left over for the frosting so I used cream cheese instead and that was really good."
"2","5","These are so delish! I was too lazy to make the frosting so I added 1/4 cup chocolate chips instead. The first batch I made were gone in 15 minutes, and they were still hot. HAHA. I am cooking my second batch in the oven as I type. =) They tasted like the ghirardelli triple chocolate chip brownie mix. Glad I found this recipe! Thanks Angie! =)"
"2","4","These are so good, but some people who have tried them have told me they're too sweet :/ I like them though..."
"2","5","OMG! I made exact as directed but I didn't do the frosting and I used a wire whisk to incorporate everything and I melted butter in a glass dish in microwave. Baked them for 25min in preheated oven at 350, removed from oven and let them cool. They are so delicious! They are moist and chewy and not cake like! Thanks to all the other reviewers for saying DONT OVERMIX and DONT OVERBAKE! That makes all the difference in the world! These are disappearing so fast into my belly, my poor hubby wont get a chance to eat them! They are indeed the best Brownies ever! Thank you for posting this easy and quick recipe that makes the best dessert! Made these again today and only mixed a few times with a fork when everything was in the bowl. and OMG so fudgy and delicious! We are hooked! this is the go to brownie for us! Thank you so much! I only pray I can control myself and not make them again tomorrow and the next day and the next day!"
"2","5","This recipe is almost identical to last month's feature in Bon Appetite magazine. Try using unsalted butter instead, and look up how to 'brown butter'. It really ia better than salted and focuses more on the chocolatey fudgy flavour."
"2","2","My kids like these but they're not too particular when it comes to sweets. I didn't like these very much but I prefer box-type brownies that I can make from scratch. If that's what you want, these aren't your brownies... The recipe was easy to make and came out as described."
"2","5","These are fabulous! I made them into gluten-free since they were for a friend who can't have gluten (used a mix of tapioca starch & rice flour instead of all-purpose flour) and they were perfect! I also didn't have an 8' square pan, and I didn't want to double the recipe to fit into my 9x13, so I baked them in muffin tins and they made 12 perfect little round brownies :) the muffin tin turned out great because every piece has that delightful crusty edge - YUM! (I may do brownies that every time from now on!) note: the baking time was less in the muffin tins (they were done at about 18-20 minutes) I also didn't make the frosting so can't rate it, I just dusted with a tiny bit of powdered sugar to 'pretty' them up, and they were just great as-is!"
"2","5","I modified this recipe to make gluten free brownies and they were DELICIOUS! I subbed 1/4 c. white rice flour, 1/4 c. sourgum flour, and 1/4 tsp. xantham gum to replace the flour, then blending with a hand mixer to mix the flours evenly. It turned out just as good as the original (a gooey, moist brownie); texture was a litte bit grainier than the original. I've made the original recipe 5-6 times before going gluten free, and I will never go back to a different brownie recipe ever again."
"2","5","This is a quick and delicious recipe. I personally thought, as written, the icing is to dry. I added a little milk. Start with 1 Tbl. of milk, mix good then add a little more to the desired consistency is reached. It should take about 2 Tbls. I will use this brownie recipe everytime I bake brownies everybody loved them."
"2","4","I made these last night, I doubled the batch but still only used 2 eggs because I wanted to make sure they were fudgy and not too cake-like. I also added 8oz of chocolate chips to the batter and didn't frost them. They turned out exactly like I was wanting. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","1","Not good, do not make again"
"2","4","My husband and I really enjoyed the brownies. I didn't find them too cakey like some others, but did find the frosting a little clumpy. I'm not sure if it needs more liquid or if I made it too early, but definitely frost them while still warm."
"2","4","Very good. I just sprinkled the hot brownies with 1 cup of chocolate chips as soon as I removed them from the oven, covered them with a cookie sheet for 1 minute, then spread the melted chips over the top instead of using the frosting. It worked great, tasted delicious, and was super easy. Good recipe!"
"2","5","These are great! They didn't even last a day between two people. I substituted Jules gluten free flour to make it celiac safe and they came out tasting like the real thing. I didn't use a mixer because I didn't want them ending up cakey."
"2","5","These really are the best brownies ever!"
"2","5","These brownies were yummy! But I didnt have any honey so i substituted syrup instead , dont do that because you can def taste the maple. And it says put the icing on when the brownies are warm, well you may want to wait until they are almost completely cooled because my icing didnt set up as pretty as it is in the pic. These brownies are def cake like."
"2","5","So fast, so easy, so DELICIOUS! Added chocolate chips and didn't even make the icing and it was still heavenly. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!"
"2","5","I am literally addicted to these. It's always my go-to dessert recipe."
"2","4","Would have liked it more if it was a little gooier. I'll probably throw in some chocolate chips next time."
"2","5","Quick and easy! I added a tablespoon of instant coffee to the batter, and 1/4 c. of chunky peanut butter to the icing. I also had to add more milk to make icing less thick. So delicious!"
"2","5","Being a health nut, I made these with raw coco, sucanate and whole-wheat flour. They came out amazing! I ate half of the pan, and my brother ate the rest. =D"
"2","5","These were so good! I did however add a half cup of peanut butter chips, and i did not make the frosting, i used a french vanilla whipped topping. It was terrific! Will be making these again!"
"2","5","Favorite non-mix brownie recipe. I've never made the frosting for them--don't think they need it"
"2","5","So yummy I could not walk into the kitchen with out getting a bite!!"
"2","5","I agree with Angie ! These brownies are outstanding. This is the best recipe I've ever used and they are always perfect, assuming you don't overcook them. Thanks !"
"2","4","EDIT: Bumped up to 4 stars - I put these in the fridge as another reviewer suggested and the next day they are definitely denser and fudgier. :)  I did not make the frosting for this brownies - so the review is for the brownie only. This is the second time I have made these brownies. The first time I made them for a small group and everyone liked them. Personally, though, I prefer a more chocolatey and fudgey brownie. I stirred the mix by hand, so maybe that is why they turned out the way they did. This recipe is a good base and can easily be spiced up with add-ins. It just didn't blow me away."
"2","5","I've made quite a few brownies from various recipes. This one is definitely staying in my recipe folder. They go so fast and taste amazing! They come out so moist and their texture is light, which makes me reach for another piece! Highly recommend and worth a try. And I love that the recipe used cocoa powder. Try it!"
"2","5","This recipe was AWESOME!!!! A good tip is to not use a mixer while mixing all the ingredients. By doing this your brownies will come out more like fudge brownies than cake. Definitely one of the best brownie recipes:)"
"2","5","I loved This Recipe ! I will never buy a boxed Brownie mix again. Thank you for sharing.."
"2","5","Good heavens! These are GOOD! Wouldn't change a thing."
"2","5","These are awesome. I add a package of peanut butter chips for a little twist, and they are always the highlight. I get asked to make them for every party we go to!"
"2","3","I thought that the batter itself was a little thick. It even stuck to the bottom of the pan with lots of butter and flour. The icing was super thick and was really hard to put on the brownies. I even had to get out my icing pump just to get it to be on the brownies with out braking them. They did eventually.....taste pretty good."
"2","5","These brownies were delicious. Very fast and easy. Needing an immediate chocolate fix, I skipped the frosting and added semi-sweet chips to the batter before baking.  20 minutes at about 330 degrees made these just right ... I was using a dark pan.  I've really never had a brownie that was rich and chewy, yet melted in your mouth like it was light and fluffy. The texture of these is perfect!"
"2","1","This was inedible. I watched the cooking time carefully."
"2","3","I made these brownines yesterday and must say I am disappointed. They weren't bad, they were just okay. The frosting came out really well even with my subsitution. Since I didn't have honey I just added milk and it turned out nice."
"2","4","Maybe not the best brownies, but they were definitely tasty. The edges were slightly crispy and the middle was nice and chewy. They're a bit of a mix between fudgy and caky brownies. They did not turn out bitter at all, they were very chocolatey and sweet. These brownies are very easy to whip up and take no time whatsoever. I would make this if I were in a hurry but this will not be my standard brownie recipe"
"2","5","I don't think I will ever make a box mix again! I doubled the recipe except for the eggs. I only used 3 instead of 4. I mixed the batter with a wooden spoon just until combined then spread in a 9' x 13' glass pan. I have an electric stove and baked these for approximately 30 min. We like 'naked' brownies so I didn't use the icing recipe. I might try it one day though just to change things up! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"2","5","The frosting turned out a little goofy, so I added a little bit of milk and then more powdered sugar and cocoa. My entire family loved these. It's hard to enjoy boxed brownies now!"
"2","3","I've never made brownies from scratch before but I can't imagine them being all that hard. These had a very cake like consistency which is not what I was looking for. These are good brownies but if you're looking for rich, dense, moist brownies, these aren't it. I should also note that I did not make any kind of topping for these brownies, maybe that would've made a difference? However, if you're looking for a lovely, light, almost cake-y brownie, these are for you!"
"2","2","I read reviews before I made these. Some of them say that these brownies are so good even without the frosting. Well, do NOT believe them! Without the frosting, these brownies are NOT sweet enough. If you don't want to bother with the frosting, you need to add another 1 cup of sugar. Also, I would use 1/4 less of flour--they came out too cakey for me. Very disappointing."
"2","1","it was bubbling when it came out. not the best brownie recipe ever..."
"2","4","Four star as recipe is (without topping). It became a five star when I stirred by hand instead of with mixer...that kept the brownies fudge like!!"
"2","5","These brownies really are the best brownies! They're even better than box brownies. I didn't make the frosting because I didn't feel like these brownies needed it. Mine turned out fudgy and chocolatey, just the way I like them. I added 2 teaspoons of Kahlua for more chocolate flavor."
"2","5","this is a nice recipe :) the brownies are very chocolatey, like fudge brownies. they are quite good"
"2","5","OMG They were great."
"2","5","Wow! These are perfect brownies. I like that all the ingredients are combined in one pot--perfect if you're a lazy baker like me. The taste was perfect; like one reviewer said, they have a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. And that was without frosting. Can't wait to make these again."
"2","3","When these first came out of the oven I would have given them 1 star. They were very cake like and disappointing. However, after they cooled they had that fudgy consistency I was looking for. I used dark cocoa. For the icing I didn't have honey so I used corn sryup instead. I had to add several drops of warm water to get the icing to mix together. I only baked them for about 22 minutes."
"2","4","These brownies were good and chocolately. I didn't change a thing. I prefer a cakey gooey brownie. Everyone at the baby shower I served these at were a hit. No doubt, with a room full of women, who'd complain?! Thanks for sharing your recipe. I will no doubt make them again and perhaps try doubling the recipe."
"2","4","Very sweet, rich and delicious! I made as the recipe it was written. Very fudgy. My fav."
"2","4","These were very tasty. I would cook a little longer tan 30 minutes and added peanut butter chips to the batter and dropped on top after spreading icing. YUM!!"
"2","5","Yum!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! My husband wanted to eat the whole pan!"
"2","1","I shouldn't even give this one star. I've made a lot of Brownies before, but never any that tasted like this!"
"2","5","These are the BEST brownies! Didn't change a thing....so yummy!! Thanks for the recipe, Angie!"
"2","5","Definitely the BEST!!! I took others' advice and carefully mixed everything by hand, making sure I beat the eggs in a separate bowl first. I threw in some chocolate chips, but I don't think the brownies even needed them! I also can't comment on the frosting, I didn't make it. To me, frosting just ruins brownies--a good brownie doesn't need frosting! Thanks for the recipe, Angie!!"
"2","5","Husband says he'll kick my butt if I ever make boxed brownies again. They were a big hit!"
"2","4","i thought that this recipe was great, except that the frosting was a little gloopy and very very rich so i added a tsp of fresh orange juice to brighten it up. Also, i baked it in a cupcake pan and reduced the cooking time to roughly 12-14 minutes. They came out already in single servings and had a chewy center and crunchy edges which i like for contrasting texture. Overall i would definitely recommend this recipe minus the frosting or with some kind of citrus to contrast the richness of the frosting."
"2","5","the brownies were good and so was the frosting. the frosting it worked out very well for me. i added half the sugar first and then the rest so it would be easier to mix and i mixed it with a fork it was done in about 3 minutes. it tasted good as well although very sweet and sugary"
"2","3","I think that there is a mistake in the frosting recipe. No way 3T of butter is going to be incorporated into 1+cups of dry ingredients. I ended up having to add an additional 4T of butter, as well as 1/2 cup of half-and-half."
"2","5","Super easy and delicious! I never make homemade brownies and these were soooooo simple and came out perfect."
"2","5","I have try other brownie recipes before and they turn out more then BAD.I made this recipe today and my 2 girls love them,they are chewy,soft very goooooood. Just waiting to see what my Hubby things of them ,this one is a keeper. Thank you Angie."
"2","5","These had a really good flavor. I didn't have the baking powder so i think that had an affect on them. They seemed a little dry so, i bought baking powder and will try it again. It's so easy to make."
"2","5","I've made these many times and they are always perfect. Never had an issue with cake like consistency. I frost them with a mint frosting and they are soooo good."
"2","4","loved the icing on these i expected the brownies themselves to be exceptional because their the best rated brownies on here but they were good not amazing"
"2","4","I made the brownies without the frosting. I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup peanut butter. I baked for 23 minutes only. Next time I may omit the butter altogether and add more peanut butter. The texture was moist and beautifully chocolatey."
"2","3","The brownies themselves were fairly good -- much more 'fudgey' than I was expecting, but very tasty! I wasn't a fan of the frosting and had a difficult time getting it to a manageable consistency. It was, however, also very fudgey and tasted good -- was just almost impossible to spread in my case."
"2","4","I actually think these are close to 5 star brownies, but there does truly seem to be a typo in the recipe. I think if you did actually beat the batter, they would be quite cake-like. I just gently mixed them and they were very fudgy. I usually make a brownie recipe that calls for baker's chocolate squares. As I was out of those, I searched for a recipe calling for cocoa powder. This was a very close runner-up to our usual favorite brownies."
"2","5","Wonderful! Made it with the frosting. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in glass pan at 325 for about 40 minutes."
"2","4","I made a double batch of these, and I'm not sure that I love the brownies.....but the icing is AMAZING. I think the brownies are a little cakey for me, but I will definitely be using the icing recipe again. The honey is an excellent touch -- adds a different dimension of flavor."
"2","5","I can see why one reviewer said that she won a blue ribbon at her local fair with this recipe! I've never tasted better. Mine weren't too cakey like some have said. I just didn't overcook them. That may be the problem."
"2","4","These brownies were pretty tasty. I added a few chocolate chips and about 3 tablespoons of coffee. I didn't make the frosting and added powdered sugar on top. Just to be fair I had previously made these to the exactly as written and they were very tasty this time however I wanted to try something different."
"2","5","Very good. Just make sure that you note the recipe is for an 8x8 pan - you will need to make more batter for a 9x13 pan. Also, make sure you don't over mix the batter, or it will turn out with a cake-like texture."
"2","3","I'm not sure on exactly how to rate this recipe. It was absolutely DELICIOUS, but it was more like cake than brownie. It is a recipe for a very delicious cake. I'll definitely be making this again, but as cake, not brownie."
"2","2","not my favorite but I used half butter/applesauce, half egg/flax, and half white/wheat flour. Also, maybe I erred on the side of undercooking...."
"2","5","you absolutely have to double the recipe for a 9x13 pan, otherwise you'll be disappointed that you don't have enough. These brownies are awesome!! I baked mine for 30 minutes, but should've baked 35 since it was doubled. I also melted the butter to make the frosting for easier spreading. My family can usually polish off a whole pan of box brownies in one night, but these are very rich."
"2","5","I used peppermint instead of vanilla extract, YUM! I also needed to add an extra tbsp of butter to the frosting to get it spreadable."
"2","5","This recipe is so good! I just cooked a wee bit longer."
"2","5","I doubled the recipe and stuck to 3 eggs and the same amt of salt as the original. I did sub peppermint extract for the vanilla because I wanted mint chocolate really bad. They turned out phenomenal, the pan is almost gone...my kids and husband just devoured them"
"2","1","Not good. too cake like. we had to throw them away. These are nothing like traditional brownies."
"2","5","These are a weekend tradition now. Thanks for a great recipe. I made these into brownie bites by using a small cookie scoop and a mini muffin pan."
"2","5","Made these last night, and loved them. Thanks for the tips to not over beat. I melted the butter in a pot and did all the mixing from there with a fork, using a 8x8 glass dish. From start to finish, I think it only took me 5-7 min before they were in the oven. I rinsed out the pot and used it on the burner venting the oven, burner turned off, to melt the butter for the icing. I followed the advice of others to use 1/2 cup icing sugar for the topping, which was good advice, and iced the brownies as soon as they were out of the oven. Easy to cut, and easy to left. I'm going to double the recipe next time and see if I can freeze some. If I try that a few times and they don't ever make it to the freezer, I'll have to just make the small portion for my health's sake."
"2","5","I made these according to the original recipe except that I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I was very happy with it. I didn't make the frosting because I prefer unfrosted brownies. These were gooey in the center and crisp around the edges. They are exactly what I like. I took them to a Halloween party and they were devoured. I received lots of compliments. I'm making them again tomorrow for a smaller potluck with friends."
"2","5","These turn out fabulous and taste great too. I have made them twice already this week. The kids love them. They are simple to mix up and bake."
"2","4","I chose this recipe because the one I usually make uses oil and all I had on hand was butter. They are somewhat cake-like in texture but I did bake them for the full 30-mins without checking-- next time I'd probably take them out slightly earlier. They are a nice, thin brownie, with a good dark chocolately flavour. I didn't make the icing."
"2","5","Great recipe! Beware of the last minutes in the oven, do not want to over cook!"
"2","5","Best brownies ever...My family refers to them as mud because they are very dark and rich. The only thing is they aren't very thick,but still good"
"2","5","One of the better brownie recipes I've had in a long while. I'm not a huge fan of the frosting, although my husband LOVES it (it's a great frosting, no doubt about that -- I'm just more of a plain-brownie kind of gal) Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","Oh My God."
"2","5","I've made these several times now and it is definitely my family's favorite (I don't even make the frosting). Once, when the computer was down, I made brownies from the recipe on the cocoa can and my kids could tell that they weren't the same brownies and kept telling me that they liked these better."
"2","5","Perfect!! I am not a fan of a gooey texture in a brownie and tend to like a cake like texture....but....these were NEITHER!! The texture was perfect!! The taste was perfect! They were incredibly easy to make. I followed the recipe except I did not flour my pan and I should have. I did not use the frosting and did not miss it. I think these would be good with some walnuts thrown in. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
"2","5","Moist, chocolatey, and really easy to make need I say more?"
"2","5","Very quick and easy using basic pantry ingredients that result in a delicious brownie. What more could I ask for?! I made these brownies without the frosting, personal preference. They are really very good without it. I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed them by hand, just until moistened and they are not too cakey as others complained about. If you like really thick brownies, consider doubling the recipe still using an 8X8' pan. This is a great recipe for basic brownies that you can do so much with. Add caramels, nuts, marshmallows etc to suit your tastes."
"2","2","These brownies are very cakey and not chocolatey enough. They weren't gross, but they were not to mine or my husband's taste at all."
"2","1","Cakey and dry. Did not overmix and I only cooked for 23 min. No wonder they need icing."
"2","4","The ease of this recipe is a 5. I had all the ingredients already at the house. I did not make the frosting, because I don't like it on brownies. The batter is delicious and the brownies are very, very good. I would definately make again. The reason for the 4 stars is that I didn't make the frosting for the brownies. Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","I'm never buying another box mix again."
"2","2","I suppose I should have believed the reviews that said that these were not gooey, chewy brownies, which is what I've been looking for. They tasted alright, but more like cake. I suppose they would make a great base for a chocolate cake and I might just use the recipe for that. But I will not be making these 'brownies' again."
"2","5","These turned out so moist and delicious! I doubled the recipe so they would fit in a 9x13 pan and I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix. I also used a different icing from another recipe. It called for 6 Tbs unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 cups powered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and I used about 4 Tbs milk. I poured the icing mixture over the brownies as soon as they came out of the oven. They turned out AMAZING! My husband said they were the best brownies he has ever had."
"2","5","These were very good brownies. The frosting was a little bit too stiff to manage -- I added a teaspoon of milk to soften it up."
"2","2","Very cakey. I like my brownies chewy and a little crisp on the top. This brownie was neither of those things. I am eating a cake square, not a brownie. Very disappointing."
"2","4","Great taste and texture. Exceptionally easy recipe too! When I first took it out of the oven, I thought, 'oh , another cakey brownie'. But after I let it settle, it was quite chewy and fudgy. I'm so surprised it only used 1/2 cup flour!"
"2","5","I used a 7X11 glass dish and they turned out perfect. I marbled some peanutbutter into the batter once I poured it in the pan, which is somthing I've done with box mixes and OH Wow how great they turned out."
"2","1","This didn't work for me. I used the exact amounts and was careful not to over-mix it, but it turned out too cakey. Nice flavour as a chocolate cake but it really wasn't a brownie at all."
"2","5","Great recipe! They have a moist cakey consistency, but still very brownie like, with just the right amount of chewiness!! Delicious!"
"2","5","this is a super simple yet a perfect recipe for brownies that have a very thin crispy layer on top and a fudgy inside. DO NOT OVERMIX the batter. avoid using a mixer and just use a wooden spoon. I didnt even make the topping because they were great just as is."
"2","5","So simple and easy but the name is correct. They are SO GOOD. I like that they are made in one pot with common ingredients. I did not make the frosting ( because I did not have any more butter in the house) I just covered the top with a thin layer of mini chocolate chips when they came out of the oven. THe chips melted and I spread them over the top. SO GOOD!!!!"
"2","5","Made these twice. Much better the 2nd time. The difference was baking them for only 25 minutes versus 30 minutes which made them dry and cake like. If you like fudgy and moist brownies don't over bake!! Yummy!"
"2","5","We made these yesterday for our local agricultural exhibition. They won first prize! This recipe is perfect as is."
"2","4","I am only giving them four stars because they did were so crumbly, but crumbs and all they sure were good. I made 2 batches and added walnuts to one."
"2","4","Excellent brownie recipe. Very easy to make and they baked up in 22 minutes, which resulted in slightly fudge-y centers with cake-y edges. These brownies are very thin, but rich. I brought a batch to work and one co-worker came over, saying, 'I heard the brownies are killer. Can I try a piece?' :-) Speaks for itself! Note: I left the brownies un-frosted."
"2","5","Having only made brownies from the mix before, I was pretty reluctant going into this. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I melted the butter in a small saucepan then poured it into a large bowl. I kept the bowl in the freezer for a bit to cool the butter (so it wouldn't melt the sugar or cook the eggs). I took it out and mixed in the other ingredients as listed in the recipe. I made sure not to really beat in the ingredients or over mix. I could still see specks of powder not completely mixed in yet, but it was fine. I poured everything in the pan and hoped that it wasn't too little and wouldn't come out thin. I then sprinkled some chocolate chips over the batter. I baked it for about 22 minutes. As others have said, I too didn't make the frosting. However, I sprinkled some powdered sugar over the brownies, more for decoration purposes. I let the brownies cool for about 10 minutes and then sliced them. They were delicious! The brownies weren't too sweet, too fudgy, too cake like, or anything. I thought they were a good medium. I am definitely a beginner baker as well. My brownies were also a bit over an inch tall, which was good. The brownies are very rich, and they are especially delicious with a glass of milk. I will definitely make this again, as I don't remember the mix even being this good!  Note: make sure you DO NOT scorch the butter. If when you finish melting it and it gives off a bad scent, throw it away! It's basic knowledge, but just in case."
"2","5","I must say I am impressed. When I saw these brownies in my recipe search boasting the title 'Best Brownies' I expected them to be average brownies that were maybe a fraction better than the standard box recipe. I am more than happy to say I was wrong. The title is not being over confident or over optimistic. These are truly the best brownies I have ever tasted. I recommend skipping the frosting. I did not have powdered sugar available so I skipped it and I can't imagine having anything on top of these already rich and delicious brownies. When I offered one of these to my sister she accepted but only wanted half of what I gave her. Needless to say, she demanded the whole brownie plus a second one after she got a taste. Thanks for a delicious experience."
"2","3","These were ok. Very cake like. I followed the recipe exact."
"2","4","These were okay. I have had better brownies. These came out very cake-like. Perhaps I did something wrong..."
"2","5","These were excellent, better without the icing in my opinion. Honestly, I was blown away by how good these were. I've been trying out homemade brownie recipes for a long time and these are better than the box kind!"
"2","2","Way too dry."
"2","3","I thought these brownies came out average, and cakey. Our family preferred the 'Brooke's Bombshell Brownies' also from this site."
"2","5","These are great and have a nice buttery flavor. I used whole wheat pastry flour and my husband couldn't even tell. We are trying to lose weight but refuse (don't have the will power) to sacrifice yummy treats so the recipe size was good for us but typically I would double it, you would probably need to increase the bake time to 30 min or so."
"2","4","This is a good brownie recipe. The only advice I would give the author is to take the instructions to beat the batter out. A brownie mix should be gently stirred unless you want a cakey souffle. Add a teaspoon of instant coffee to 'torgue up' the chocolate flavor."
"2","1","The first time I made this recipe I didn't plan on icing as I like fudgy brownies without icing. They came out tasting like stale cake, but figured it was my error since it has such raving reviews. I read through the reviews and made a second attempt, this time making sure I didn't over mix them. They turned out exactly the same. I thought if I added the icing it might save this batch, but the icing recipe is too thick and brittle to even spread. Literally, I could tap the top of it with a knife and it would make a 'clacking' sound. I tried, I really did. I gave it a second chance...but I won't make these again."
"2","3","These are pretty decent brownies if you like a more 'cakie' brownie. I like my brownies really rich and chocolately and these are more like a cholocate cake-like. They are good just not to sweet or fudgie."
"2","5","These are AMAZING!! I will never make a box brownie again. There is nothing cake like about these if you make them correctly, don't use a mixer & beat by hand, which is easy if you let your ingredients come to room temp. I doubled the recipe & made them in a 9 by 13 pan but I didn't double the icing. I just thinned it out w/ a little almond milk & made it into a thick glaze which I poured over them as soon as they came out of the oven. Once it set up it's perfect, not so much icing that you can't eat them with your fingers & not so little that you have a dry brownie top. PERFECT!"
"2","2","didnt come out like a brownie for me. It was more cake like"
"2","4","This recipe made the perfect old fashioned brownie. It was NOT cake-like, it was a chewy chocolaty and yummy brownie. The trick to making sure it is not cake-like is to stir it with your hands (no electric mixers) and not to over bake. If you mix it too perfectly smooth, then you just made cake batter! Brownie batter should have very small lumps. But, all in the family liked it and for an old fashioned brownie crave, this will do the trick!"
"2","5","One word...YUMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!"
"2","1","made these for my sons high school graduation party...what a disappointment. Bland, where is the chocolate flavor? Very odd texture, cake like."
"2","1","These definitely were not the best brownies. I'd say box brownies taste better. If you're looking for a professional brownie recipe pass by this one. Look only for one that actually melts butter and chocolate together instead of using any kind of powder."
"2","5","Oh My Gosh these are the best brownies ever!. My family loves them and I make them for my work when we have pot lucks. I would recommend this recipe for anyone"
"2","4","These were okay. I took into account that others found the frosting too sweet, so I omitted it. Instead, I lightly dusted them with powdered sugar to make them look a little nicer. Overall, the brownies were okay. They could had a little richer chocolate taste: they were a little bland. But maybe that's because I didn't use the frosting..."
"2","5","Easy, delicious recipe. I substituded 1/2 cup butter with 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup applesauce. I also added 2 tbsp of rasberry jam to the frosting. The brownies were so moist and chocolatey!"
"2","4","I followed the frosting recipe and it was like a hard piece of clay that would not spread when added to the warm brownie. The weight of the frosting created a crater on top of my brownie from the weight. I put the frosting back in the bowel and added water to thin it out and then it was spreadable. I baked the brownie 22 mins. It was like a molten lava cake. Brownie will taste great warmed in the microwave with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Don't overbake."
"2","5","These are quite delicious and so easy to make. I used a 9 inch pan by accident so they came out a little thin, but nontheless still delicious. I think next time I would double the recipe for a thicker brownie. Thanks for the fast, easy and yummy recipe that will be a definite keeper in my house!"
"2","5","There is a BIG problem with these brownies... I can't stop eating them! I made two batches, one with nuts (for hubby) and another without for the rest of us. Both batches turned out perfectly. Most brownies are either too dense and heavy or just the opposite, too dry. These are just what a brownie should be. I like the fact that even after slicing them into squares, they remained very moist and tender and never dryed out. Be sure to mix by hand, just until the dry ingredients are combined. Thanks Angie for sharing this wonderful recipe."
"2","5","Delicious and versatile - and nuts, chocolate chips etc and it comes out great! However, be prepared to double the mixture if you want a dense, high brownie as the mixture doesn't have much rise to it."
"2","5","Very good basic brownie recipe. They come out nice and fudgy. The trick to getting fudgier as opposed to more cake-like brownies is to mix the batter by hand - not with a stand or hand mixer. If you use a mixer then it beats the eggs too much and adds in too much air. It's best to mix it up the old fashioned way in a bowl with a wooden spoon."
"2","5","Amazing! So easy and quick! Perfect, I would give a million stars if I could. Only thing I didn't do was make the frosting, I have never had frosted brownies, so I just didnt make it."
"2","5","Melty, gooey goodness and not cake-like at all. The key is DON'T USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. Blend ingredients by hand and you will not be disappointed!"
"2","1","I wanted thick gooey brownies. Turns out like a cake. Doesn't look like the picture at all."
"2","5","These were the best brownies I have ever tasted. I substituted 1 cup of white sugar with 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar to get a caramelish taste."
"2","3","I found these to be somewhat dry. I like fudgey brownies and these weren't fudgy... these are definitely not the best brownies."
"2","5","Wow! I couldn't believe I had homemade brownies with homemade frosting in 45 minutes from start to me eating them...and all with ingredients I had on hand! The texture of the brownies is like a dense, rich chocolate cake. I baked them in muffin cups instead and put the frosting on right out of the oven. The result was a rich chocolate cupcake with a fudgy molten top, yum! I really loved the frosting too. The brownies themselves are not too sweet so it was a perfect pairing. I definitely recommend using it!"
"2","5","I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 a cup of Kahlua to the batter. Instead of the chocolate frosting I made a Kahlua buttercream frosting with 1/4 cup butter, 2 tbsp half and half, 1 tbsp Kahlua, and 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. They're easily the best brownies I've had in my life."
"2","5","These were AMAZING!!!! I just made these for my friends and WOW they'll be gone by the end of the day, I'm sure! I will never make box brownies again...and they are SO simple to make! I only baked them for exactly 22 minutes, like another reviewer....AWESOME! Thank you so much for sharing!"
"2","5","This is one of the easiest and most reliable bownie recipes on this site. Always very moist so if someone finds them cake like they are not following the instructions. Thanks for a great addition to my brownie file. Simplicity itself."
"2","5","Wow! These brownies are great!! The key is to add a few tablespoons of water to the frosting so it spreads easier. Make sure you frost the brownies when they are hot...it soaks into the brownies and makes them really fudgy...these are definitely the best brownies I've ever had!!!"
"2","5","I confess, I had to add butterscotch and chocolate chips due to craving. BUT these were amazing! Not cake like at all, very moist and chewy. Perfect brownie texture."
"2","5","really delicious! i didnt have enough all purpose flour so i used half of that and half self rising...omitted the salt and baking soda...and i didnt have enough butter, so i used oil...and they still were SO good! really quick and easy, too!"
"2","5","Absolutly AMAZING is all I can say! I have tried over 4 brownie recipes that were okay but not fabulous. I tried these once and they turned out PERFECT!!! I just made a second batch and instead of vanilla I added some vanilla baileys. AMAZING!!! Try topping it off with blended rasberries and a tiny bit of nutmeg in the blend. Will turn out perfect! :)"
"2","5","YUM! I followed the recipe exactly (except adding chocolate chips, which is really a matter of preference, like nuts) and it was phenomenal! The frosting was a little thick, but that is easily fixed if preferred (by microwaving or adding milk) and this did not detract, at all, from the overall taste quality. Not cake-like, definitely melt-in-your-mouth fudgy. If that's what you like, you will love these. Awesome recipe!!!"
"2","5","These are very moist and delicious! I doubled the recipe and put in a little more than 1/3 cup chocolate powder and a 1/3 cup melted chocolate chips. :D I'm going to make these again for sure!"
"2","5","Read lots of reviews.. I cooked for 26 mins. I added a splish of milk to the icing because it was so thick. Frosted them warm and they are delicious"
"2","5","Awesome brownies. I used an 8x11 pan and they are plenty thick. Added 1T milk to the frosting because it was just powdery without. Excellent recipe and very easy. Added sprinkles to the top because they will be served at a playdate tomorrow!"
"2","3","They're ok. Not sure what all the fuss is about. I prefer Brooke's Bombshell brownie recipe far and above this one."
"2","5","These are so easy to make, and oh so delicious!"
"2","5","Yummy! I doubled for a 9x13 pan and baked for 26 mins, and they were definitely done. Icing really makes these brownies. Next time I will take out at 25 mins. I took these to a church event and brought home just a few brownies- they were gone by next day. These do not last long!"
"2","5","Perfect!"
"2","5","These turned out absolutely amazing, but I do have a few tips: 1. Double the recipe and use a 9x13 glass pan. An 8x8 pan of these won't last 5 minutes once people get a taste! 2. As others have said, don't overmix and don't overcook! I cooked it as instructed and used a large spoon just to break the yolks of the eggs, then added the rest of the ingredients and whisked it by hand with a small beater until the large lumps were gone. That's all that needs to be done! Spread it evenly into the pan and level it out evenly. 3. The frosting is a bit difficult to pull off properly, but I have a few tips. Combine all the ingredients but the butter. Put the butter in the microwave for 15-20 seconds on a saucer, til it JUST starts to melt. Mix it as best you can in to the bowl with the ingredients, then put the whole bowl in the microwave for 30-45 seconds to melt the butter a bit more. THEN you should be able to combine everything into something resembling frosting. Lastly, stick it in the microwave one more time to melt the frosting, about another 30-45 seconds, so that it spreads on to the brownies easily and evenly. Do it almost right out of the oven! Then let it ALL cool for 20-30 minutes so it cuts properly. Cooked for about 26 minutes, these come out nice and fudgy and chewy, but I'd suppose you can cook them longer for different results."
"2","5","Those brownies are fab but they're a bit too fluffy for my liking. Tastes quite like cake. Will use this recipe when I crave for extra-moist chocolate cake, but my search for a picture-perfect brownie recipe continues."
"2","4","This is a good recipe to have around if you have cocoa powder instead of chocolate around. But...the texture is more cake-like than brownie-like, as if a lot of air were trapped inside. The taste is good and I added some nuts because my hubby loves those. I baked in a rectangular pan only for 20 minutes and they came out perfect, maybe because the batter turned out thin when I poured it in this pan."
"2","4","Ok, so maybe 'best' is really a matter of taste, but these are pretty darn great. I reduced the sugar a bit and added some chopped almonds to give the recipe a personal twist, but there is really not much to change. Will make again."
"2","5","The best brownies ever! I will throw away all my other recipes! The frosting didn't work but other reviews say melt butter first and use less sugar so maybe that would work."
"2","5","These were great. I took another reviewers advice when doubling the recipe, I left out one egg and left the salt at 1/4 tsp, and it turned out great. My family loved them. I have always been a big believer of not over baking sweets. So I applied that to this also (baked a double recipe for 30 min), and they came out moist and chewy. I didn't even make the frosting, they are great without. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks"
"2","5","When my boyfriend tried one of these brownies, he said, and I quote, 'I just jizzed in my pants'. I couldn't make this up!"
"2","5","I can only imagine that this recipe came from a spiritual experience. I will NEVER buy a box mix again. It would now be a insult to my palate. 1)Instead of a whole cup of sugar, I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (did not need the extra 1/4 cup). 2) I added about 1 more tbs of cocoa for richer taste. 3)I added mini chocolate chips. I only made changes to personalize the recipe. It's excellent just the way it is."
"2","5","These brownies were great -- easily as good as if not better than any box mix I've ever made! If you follow the recipe exactly they turn out dense and fudgy -- not at all 'cake like.' Whenever I have a peanut butter/chocolate craving I make these and replace 1/2 a cup of butter with creamy peanut butter; it melts together wonderfully over medium heat. Or if I want to spruce it up a little I add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the regular recipe. I've never made the icing since I find that the brownies are great on their own. To those who can't get them to turn out review your ingredients and follow the recipe exactly -- no 'fudging' the quantities. Remember that there is a big difference between artificial and natural vanilla extract when cooking since this is what covers the 'eggy' taste. Try mixing with a wisk since this recipe does not really require the use of an electric mixer. A rule of thumb my grandma taught me was never to stir a box brownie mix for more than 50 strokes; once the flour and cocoa powder were added to this recipe I find that about 30 strokes will do it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!"
"2","4","Very good brownies. I followed the recipe to the T. I was a little concerned about the frosting since it was thicker than the batter, but it is ok as long as you let it soften on the warm brownies a little before spreading out."
"2","5","I made these yesterday and they are GONE! Didn't make the frosting and didn't miss it at all. Baked mini muffin size for 15 minutes. So yummy."
"2","4","Doubled the recipe and it turned out great. Definitely not cake-like, which I prefer. Didn't make the frosting and the pan still disappeared. A good base recipe for adding in fudge, nuts, etc."
"2","4","I made these last night and they are fantastic. I called my sister and told her to give them a try ASAP. HOWEVER... I did change up the frosting. I only used two Tablespoons of cocoa and increased the butter to four Tablespoons. I also added a little milk for a creamier texture. Do not over stir or overbake. We loved them! Good Luck! Saundra"
"2","5","I was charged with bringing brownies to a dinner party, with only an hour's notice. No box mix on hand, but plenty o' baking supplies. I am a 'tweaker' so, here's what I did... I let the butter brown a little, cause that's how I like it... I added in the cup of sugar (turbinado), then 1/3 cup of a chopped up quality dark chocolate bar, THEN the 2 eggs... the rest of the required ingredients went in. Because of the added chocolate, the batter seemed a little thick to make a chewy brownie, and I added a little egg from a carton (maybe 1-2 tablespoons), and a dash more sugar. This is one of those recipes it is CRITICAL not to overmix - I literally got the dry ingredients wet and not in big chunks (if you whisk sift, it's not a problem). I schmered the batter into a parchement lined glass pan (I hate this pan) - and hauled it to the dinner party to cook. They turned out wonderfully rich and fudgey - great chewy edges and dense in the middle. They baked for right at 33 minutes - and the parchment allows for immediate removal from the pan, so they don't overcook along the edges from the residual. For the review below, where the brownies came out dry, removing so much of the fat, and adding addition dry (cocoa powder) will absolutely alter the texture. The fat + sugar with lack of flour is what gives them their chewy texture, and the sugar is what gives a glossy, cracked crust."
"2","5","Amazing, can't keep them in the house!"
"2","3","These brownies were too sweet for us and we like our sweets! I think if I added some bittersweet chocolate chunks to the mix, the overall taste would be better. It felt like something was missing and if I make these again, that's what I wouldchange."
"2","5","Love em!"
"2","5","These brownies are good. I wouldn't say 'best', but a good recipe. I've said it before and I will say it again--I'm not baker. And every time I try to make brownies it's an adventure for me. These, however, turned out well for me. Gooey and fudgy on the inside, crisp on the top and chewy on the edges, which is what a brownie is supposed to be, right?! I did make one mistake, but it was my fault...I used coarse salt thinking it would dissipate while baking, of course it didn't and now I have salt crystals in my brownies...but they're still edible and yummy. Thanks for a good brownie recipe that made me a little more optimistic about my baking skills!"
"2","5","This recipe is wonderful as is, even without the frosting! As others have mentioned it's perfect when mixed by hand. It turns out a bit too cakey if you use an electric mixer. Just like the box except with a richer flavor. It's so simple too, I was able to make it with the group of middle school students that I work with."
"2","3","Pretty good brownies. The only modification I made was to substituted unsweetened apple sauce for half of the shortening. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and didn't use an electric mixer (I usually mix everything by hand anyway). The brownies came out very fudgey, but a little hard to handle. Next time I may up the quantity of flour. I also did not include the icing as the brownies are pretty rich just on their own. But tasty."
"2","5","I thought these brownies were very moist and brownie like! I did sub half the butter for applesauce and they still came out very moist! I also halfed the recipe and put them in a little pyrex bowl to make them extra thick:) I am a brownie freak and have tried MANY brownie recipes...THIS IS THE ONE!! So if you are looking for a great moist chocolate brownie look no further! And I even made them with applesauce! The frosting is good but def. not needed just some ice cream."
"2","5","Doubled these in an 11x17, and let them sit before we cut them. They were perfect without the icing. If you wanted a hard, chewy brownie, overcook them or use an edge pan. If you're like us and wanted a good chewy fudgy brownie, follow the directions and they'll be perfect."
"2","5","My husband and I were craving brownies and I looked for something easy with ingredients I had on hand and this qualified. Really, really good. Don't neglect the frosting...the honey sounded kind of wierd, but turned out to be delish. A tip: MELT the butter first and then mix teh frosting ingredients together."
"2","1","I won't be making these again"
"2","5","I have made this too many times to count. They come out perfect every time! I havent tried the frosting though...brownies never last long enough to get frosted. I melted the butter in the microwave to save stovetop time and came out with the same results. I've also tried it with mini-chocolate chips, PB chips, chopped nuts, and mini marshmellows. You can mix in anything!"
"2","5","Terrific and easy recipe, for sure will make again. I melted the butter in a microwave bowl and then mixed it together. NLM"
"2","4","These brownies came out very nicely -- spongy and light, if that's what you're into. Even though I MUCH prefer a dense, chewy fudge brownie, I think I'll make these again. Thanks for the recipe! (By the way, I did not make the frosting.)"
"2","4","And a half! The best ones I have ever made, not the best I have ever had thought. I made them in mini muffin tins and skipped the icing, just a dusting of powdered sugar. They were fantastic. And gone."
"2","3","DISCLAIMER: I did not make the frosting. That said, the texture and fudginess of this recipe is wonderful, but it lacked chocolatey flavor. 'Tastes like a blondie,' said my husband. Next time, I'll up the cocoa quantity to 1 cup (for a double batch)."
"2","5","These are delicious. They are still cooling and a third of the pan is gone. I did go with the icing (no honey on hand, so i used a bit of milk until it got to the right consistency), and I was pleasantly surprised at the sheen and richness that the small amount of frosting lent to this superb brownie. My baking powder had expired, so i subbed a pinch of banking soda with no ill outcome. I did these as 'one bowl' by using a pyrex glass bowl and microwaving the butter; made it so much easier!"
"2","3","I wanted to try something different. I will stick to my recipe from the betty crocker cookbook from now on. This one is more cake like and doesn't have the same chewy texture I've come to love. The frosting, however, I had no problems with, but I did not put honey in it. I decided against putting the honey in because I usually don't prefer the taste of honey (almost sickening sweet) in dressings and frosting and such (I do, however love honey in herbal tea and wholewheat baked goods, just so you know). I ended up doubling the recipe and added 2T. of milk (one for each recipe). Good icing; not too sweet that way. I think I'll put it one my favorite stand-by brownie recipe next time."
"2","4","These brownies are very good, but I can see where they are very easy to screw up: I followed the recipe exactly for an 8x8' pan, and the brownies were only about 3/4' thick, with the topping. In my gas oven, it took 17 minutes to cook. Stir in the ingredients very, very slowly-almost fold in the ingredients. Don't beat it at all, or you'll end up with cakey nonsense. When they came out of the oven they looked grey, a sign that there may not have been enough cocoa in the recipe, but with the topping, you couldn't tell. I did not use the topping included with this recipe, but a simple ganache (1/2 cup boiled cream mixed with 3/4 cup chocolate chips), drizzled with runny chocolate frosting (1/2 cup ganache mixed with 1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar). The key to put the whole thing together is to put the topping on while the brownies are still hot-The reason is because part of the topping should melt/absorb into the baked batter to create that 'melt in your mouth' treat aimed for. Next time I will double the recipe for an 8x8' pan, for 1 1/2' thick brownies. With the ganache topping, these babies are rich enough to feign a torte if cooked in a round cake pan:)"
"2","4","These were terrific! Gooey. I doubled the recipe and used a 9X12 pan. I was doubtful I'd like the frosting b/c I hate honey, but you can't hardly taste that honey aftertaste when its in the frosting on the brownies. We undercooked ours a tad, made for a wonderfully gooey mess! After trying quick and easy brownie recipe on here, I took this down a star, b/c those are even better!"
"2","5","Good recipe for a brownie made from scratch. I doubled the recipe and put in 9x13. Very moist in inside. Did NOT make icing...was very good by itself. Baked for around 50 minutes. Can add peanut butter chips for a different taste."
"2","5","Deeeeeelish! I did use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, and didn't make any frosting - but these brownies were still so good! Such a simple, yet fantastic recipe!"
"2","5","I have made these brownies 4 times now and thought it was time to add my 5* rating to the group. I make this recipe all in one measuring cup. Awesome, easy, fast and not a big cleanup. What more can needs to be said. Don't overbake!!!"
"2","5","Dear sweet Angie, This recipe is truly the most delicious and scrumptuous recipe known to man kind and i would like to take this oppurtunity to thank you for making my life complete with these brownies. They have helped me through rough times and have been a big hit at parties..so, thanks again for all you do.. Love, Neon Chicki Mamas (but i am actually being serious so dont laugh)"
"2","3","Despite reading tons of reviews and being careful not to overmix, these just did not come out right. A little too cakey for me and really not enough chocolate flavor, but easy to make and unique tasting, so these might be just right for others - good luck!"
"2","5","I made these as-is. They are amazing."
"2","5","These brownies are fantastic! My family fell in love with the frosting. One of my tasters thought it was a tad bit too sweet so I suggest the following changes: For those who have only instant cocoa on hand, use that but lessen the white sugar to 1/4 cup. For the frosting use only 2/3 cup of confectioner's sugar. Awesome brownies!"
"2","5","Great recipe. Only real changes i made were that I used 3/4 of a cup of flour because I was afraid of it being too cake-y and a little milk in the frosting. Oh and I used marijuana butter instead of regular butter. I'm a very inexperienced baker and i made these with ease. thanks."
"2","5","Pretty darn good, but how can you mess up a brownie? Did require longer cooking time."
"2","5","These were fudgy delicious goodness. I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan and after mixing the dry ingredients separately, I folded them in with a spatula until everything was just wet. With my oven these only needed to cook for about 20 minutes or until I could smell them and a knife inserted in the middle came out clean. No need for the frosting, they sell themselves. A sure recipe for the next potluck social. Thanks!"
"2","5","Very good brownie recipe! Very rich, but good with milk. In the frosting I melted the butter and substituted the honey with milk for a more creamy frosting."
"2","5","I usually use Duncan Hines mix because homemade brownies have never turned out as gooey for me. I made these because a friend was over and we wanted brownies but didn't want to go to the store. I will never make a mix again! These were SOOOO good. Mine didn't turn out cakey at all. They were dense and gooey and delicious. I added about a half cup of chopped up Dove chocolates and it made them extra chocolatey. This is my new regular brownie recipe!"
"2","5","These were soo good and simple. I didn't make the frosting, didn't need it..."
"2","5","I made these for our Valentine's Day dinner. They were very good. I have to say, I am a fan of boxed brownie mix. I don't know why but I am!! These were still very good and had a special homemade goodness and texture of their own. I wouldn't compare the two but both are equally delicious in their own categories. A great recipe!"
"2","5","I followed the brownie recipe completely and even added the frosting. They were really good and my dad loved them! Definitely keep an eye on the pan once it hits around 20 minutes, keep testing it with a toothpick every minute after til it's ready. For the frosting, I'd add the sugar gradually until it tastes to your liking, that way you'll avoid it being too sweet. I only substituted the honey for corn syrup because it was all I had on hand, still good though :)"
"2","5","Soooooo yummy!! I substituted the honey in the frosting for another tablespoon of butter. DELICIOUS. I've made these three times and we all love them."
"2","5","I was hesitant to make these because of some of the mixed reviews, but I am truly glad I did. These are the absolute best brownies I have ever had, like one reviewer said these are somewhere in between cake like and fudgy. But perfectly in between. I doubled the recipe (doubled exactly) and baked it for 30 minutes. I took the other reviewers advice and mixed it by hand (slightly mixed the eggs before mixing them in). The middle did look undone when I took it out but it was perfect when it cooled. I would recommend this recipe but it seems there is a lot of room for error so good luck! Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"2","5","This is a GREAT recipe. It's from the Hershey's cookbook...called 'Best Brownies.' My family has been making this recipe since I was a child."
"2","5","So easy and so yummy. I like them without the icing. Will double the recipe next time!"
"2","3","The best brownie recipe!! Only bake for no more than 25 minutes. I only gave it 3 stars because the icing is not mixable. I think this Angie screwed up on the icing recipe, mine always was sawdust and I have tried it over and over. Fix your icing Angie!"
"2","5","EASY CHOCOLATE FIX! I have been known to make these at 11:00 p.m. to satisfy a craving or two! I have used this recipe a lot and every time I try some thing different. Raspberry extract, white chips, Almond extract, cinnamon... ALWAYS turns out! I don't know what the cooks were doing that didn't give this RAVE reviews, but ALL my boys love them and the church too! Thanks for posting such an easy and versatile recipe!"
"2","5","OH MY GOODNESS! I will never use box mix again. I add 3/4 cups of semi-sweet choc chips to the batter for the most decadent dessert on Earth. Unfortunately they disappear before I can even make the frosting, so this rating is for the brownie itself."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exact (except doubled it to fit a 13 x 9 pan) and it came out wonderful. Everything was great about this recipe, from the taste to the texture. I will never make box brownies again!!!"
"2","5","OMG!!!!!!!!!!! This was FANTASTIC!!! I loved it! I made it for my husband to take to work and everyone that tried it had 2nds and 3rds! It was soooooo yummy. I did not change a thing in this recipe except I baked it for a little longer since the middle was really raw after 30 minutes(I think it's my oven). Nonetheless it came out great! Thank you so much for sharing this perfect recipe!"
"2","4","It was very good (loved the way it came out) but for an 8' pan its not enough, it came out wayy too thin. I would suggest doubling the recipe."
"2","5","I read the reviews and used this recipe for the BASE for my Spicy Mexican Brownies. Took the advice to mix by hand so the brownies would not be cakey and added 1 TBS of Mexican Chili Powder. My Family Loves the Spice suprise under the sweet icing . . ."
"2","5","My fiance loved them and said they were better than our favorite mix! I prepared the brownies as per the recipe but I frosted them with hot fudge topping that I had and they were great! I would definitely make these again and double the recipe!"
"2","5","Amazing Brownies. I was anxious to make brownies for the first time but this is an amazingly easy recipe to follow, cant really go wrong. I did take the advice and whisked the eggs before adding them. Made a patched yesterday and they were gone within the hour. My husband is a chocoholic and he loved them. After making such amazing brownies I dont think I will ever buy store made brownies again."
"2","4","These brownies are so simple to make and turn out very well. When my boyfriend said he had never had homemade brownies before, I went straight to this recipe. No more box brownies for him! If you want a fudge-like texture, take the brownies out at 25 minutes. I do that every time and they never turn out cake-like."
"2","5","this is the 2nd time making this recipe and its fantastic! you get that nice brownie crust and they are fudgy inside. the trick w/ brownies (just like muffins & quick breads) is to NEVER over stir. just use a regular old spoon and gently stir until just combined...they will turn out perfect everytime!"
"2","5","O.M.G. These are fantastic. Here's what I did. No frosting. Doubled the recipe minus one egg and kept salt to 1/4 tsp. like someone else suggested to make them fudgier. I don't recommend beating them with the mixer. Hand mix with fork. You don't want batter too smooth. After spreading them in 9x13 pan I scattered 1/2 cup of milk chocolate morsels on top of the batter and baked for 26 mins. Perfection. I'll never buy a mix again. This was too easy."
"2","4","The brownies were absolutely rich and delicious. The frosting however was good, but not pretty. I literally had to take napkins and sop up extra butter pooling on top of the frosting."
"2","3","Standard brownie recipe. Was easy to make but the texture was more cake like rather than fudge like. The icing was very hard to spread, I ended up microwaving it for a few seconds. Tasted good but nothing exceptional."
"2","4","These brownies tasted fabulous. They are definitly fudgey. If you like more cakey or rise a little higher than add an extra egg. Also I had to add a little milk to the frosting because it was very thick and powdery without it. The honey in the frosting is wonderful."
"2","1","I really didn't enjoy these brownies. They're bitter and, as some other people said, very cake-like (and no, I didn't over-cook them, I only cooked them for 20 minutes). I made them for my baby sisters who are over visiting today and they're just picking at them- it really says something when and 8 year old and a 4 year old won't devour brownies. I'm surprised so many people loved them! Not to our taste at all."
"2","5","I made this recipe today!! awesome!!! I used pumpkin puree (1/4 cup per egg) instead of the eggs..oh.my.word! They are so delicious and they were sweet but not too sweet! Would make again in a heart beat!"
"2","5","I'm not sure where all the comments about these being cakey come from, I've made these about 6 times and always they turn out great, fudgey yummy brownies. sometimes I frost them with store bought frosting but they don't really need it. I have not made the frosting that is posted with these. but everyone loves these brownies."
"2","5","These were excellent cake-like brownies. I prefer more fudgy brownies but this is a great recipe to change it up a bit. I will alternate between these and the other but no more boxed brownies, for sure!"
"2","5","These are really delicious brownies. I used Smart Balance Light spread to make these vegan and they were absolutely delicious. I didn't make the frosting, but I added some dairy-free chocolate chips and chopped almonds to the mix."
"2","5","My husband makes these as a late night snack (they're so quick and easy) and then he practically scarfs down the whole pan."
"2","4","Excellent brownies, if yiu want them a little richer cut the flour down from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup and it wont dry out as much, but otherwise great recipe."
"2","5","My kids and husband LOVED these!!! I didn't use the icing because- really, who needs all that sugar? But to the poster who said the icing was 'crunchy'- you want to use confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar), not granulated (plain old white sugar you stir into coffee)."
"2","4","I really enjoy the flavor of these brownies, and especially LOVE the frosting bit. The only thing I am disappointed with in this recipe is the height of the brownie (picky, I know!). I like a real full looking brownie, and these just don't get tall enough for me. It totally may be an error on my part; but either way I've found better luck with another recipe on this site."
"2","3","These were just kind of strange. To me they seem like less of a brownie texture and more of a torte. The flavor was lovely though, they just weren't what I wanted."
"2","5","Iv tried many brownie recipes and this is one of the best, not extreamly moist but I prefure it with a more cakey texture, these seem to taste better after they have cooled and work very well with chocolate chips, I did not use the icing recipe though, Id defently try this again."
"2","5","Definitely a good brownie! My oven runs a bit hot, so after 20 minutes they were nice and chewy. I didn't find them cakelike at all, with a good dense texture. Very easy one-bowl method too--I'll certainly make these again. I can't say anything about the icing, though, as I ran out of cocoa and had to use a different recipe with chocolate squares."
"2","4","good...a little too cake like for me. Still looking for that gooey fugdey brownie. I used Pergonotti cocoa and it was so rich and decadent. Delicious :)"
"2","5","These brownies turn out just the way my family and I like them. I follow the recipe except for one small item....I add a splash of Kahlua or Creme de Cacao They are excellent."
"2","5","Look no further, the perfect brownie recipe is right here! Wonderful!!!"
"2","5","WOW. These were absolutely amazing... I had thought Brooke's Bombshell Brownies were good, but these were just as good and healthier! I used 1/2 c applesauce for the butter in the brownie part (which made them a little more 'cakey'), and decreased the sugar to 1/2 C, but changed nothing else, and made the frosting exactly as written - which turned out to be the best frosting I've ever made! Definitely a 10 star recipe in my mind. :-)"
"2","5","This is my new favorite brownie recipe. Super easy! I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan. I had to bake it for a few extra minutes, but it was well worth it!"
"2","5","Easy. Love these. Just the right texture."
"2","5","I Love Brownies and I got this Idea from the Brownie Bites you can buy at Albertson. When I am ready to pour the Brownies into something I pour the batter into cupcake papers so you get your own personal Brownie shaped like a cupcake and they are oh so moist."
"2","5","I doubled this recipe in an 8 x 8 pan but the original recipe would have been plenty. Took a little longer for the center to cook but still turned out very good."
"2","4","Frosting was hard to spread and very sweet. Overall, good tasting brownie."
"2","5","the brownies? delicious!!! the icing? ehhhh...not so much.   The brownies are so good, don't mask the flavor w/ the icing. They don't need it!"
"2","5","These are SOOO GOOD!! I don't know what the reviewers, who say these are too cake-like, are doing. Mine came out ridiculously fudgy, just how I like them!! I took the advice of one reviewer and didn't use my hand mixer. I mixed everything with a spatula. I added a little extra cocoa powder because I like my brownies chocolaty and baked them for 24 minutes. I also threw some walnuts in the mix. For the frosting I only used 1/2 of the powder sugar. Will definitely be making my own brownies from now on, no more boxed mix for this gal! =)"
"2","5","VERY good brownies! This was my first time making them from scratch as i've always bought them from the box. These have a great taste. I would cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup next time though - they were a tad too sweet for me. I also added 1/2 cup ghirardelli semi-sweet and they totally made the recipe! Great consistency. I beat by hand and did not use a mixer. Would definitely make again!"
"2","3","At first, these tasted weird- But after letting them sit for a while and trying a 2nd one- these are pretty good. I wouldn't say they are the 'best' but if you want a cake-ish type chocolate dessert, try this!"
"2","5","Very good! Like someone said on here, don't expect a fudgy brownie or a cakey brownie, it's something in between. I made it, dead easy, followed some advices from other reviewers and lightly beat the egg before I added it to the mixture. I didn't overbeat it either, just carefully folded everything in. I baked it for exactly 25 mins, and let it cool down before I cut it, it was so yummy, that I ate about 3 while cutting them into squares once they were chilled. I also added choc chips into the mixture and some on top. Realy delicious! Next time I'll put white choc chips in it. Oh and I didn't make the frosting and I'm glad I didn't cuz they were perfectly sweet as they were, I think the frosting would have been too much."
"2","4","This was good, just not the best. I like the thin and crispy crunch on top of my brownies, and this was more of a cake top. Tasted great though, and was real simple!"
"2","4","Super easy to follow recipe, even the frosting, which I had to alter a bit because I had no honey and needed more moisture, so I used non-fat milk, and it became a silky smooth frosting, I didn't use the whole cup of conf. sugar, just eyeballed when it seemed to be the right consistency. Overall good turnout, who doesn't love a chewy brownie?"
"2","5","**WARNING** DO NOT MAKE THESE BROWNIES That is unless you are willing to eat the WHOLE pan in one sitting. I was bored with the kids one rainy afternoon and figured I would look up a recipe to make with them for a little snack before dinner. What a mistake. We couldn't stop eating these. They were PERFECT exactly as the recipe is written. I must delete this one from my files for the sake of my hips. Even my 11 year old DD told me she'd rather have these brownies than any other kind of dessert for her birthday. What more can I add that hasn't already been said."
"2","5","I love this recipe. It's easy and yummy. I made the brownies but not the icing. I have only made brownies from scratch twice before using different recipes, and I had kind of given up and was just using mixes. I will replace using boxed mixes with this recipe. I much prefer to make food from scratch rather than from a box, so I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","The brownies were wonderful. My husband said they were even better than his mother's....and she makes some pretty good brownies! The honey adds quite a distinct flavor. I couldn't eat just one."
"2","4","These brownies were good. Nothing spectacular, but still very good."
"2","5","I followed the recipe as directed, but omitted the frosting. And my whole family loved them. They are so moist and yummy. Best home-made brownies I have made. The 2nd time I made this, I added creamy peanut butter to the top and swirled it around. EVERYONE loved them!"
"2","5","I had a craving for something chocolately about an hour ago, and decided to whip up these brownies... my craving was well satisfied! As I try to make desserts on the healthier side, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used apple sauce in place of the butter, which saved a lot of fat and calories. Also, I just dumped all of the ingredients into a bowl and mixed with a wooden spoon (didn't use a mixer). I left it in the oven for 30 minutes and it came out light, fluffy, and delicious. I will definitely be making this again."
"2","5","Yeah, this recipe is Brownie Splendor! Like those perfect little brownie chunks in Ben and Jerry ice cream. Loved the taste, moist factor, texture everything. I didn't make the frosting, only because, I thought they were great alone or with a dollop of extra creamy canned whip cream. When I first put the batter into an 8X8 pan, I thought I'd have to make another batch, it didn't look like enough batter. But, don't worry, they come out perfectly! I did have a bit of trouble getting them out of the glass pan, even buttered and floured. I might try that non-stick spray for baking. I'm making a few pans of these tomorrow for a family Christmas Eve dinner. My Hubby and I give them 5+ stars."
"2","5","Really quick and easy. My husband has never had homemade brownies and he was really impressed. Next time I would add some walnuts, but that's just my preference."
"2","5","I was looking for an 'old-fashioned' brownie recipe with a glaze-type frosting, not the typical cake-like frosting. This recipe definitely fit the bill!! These brownies are great! I shortened the bake time to 23 minutes (making really gooey brownies--the perfect kind!) and when I made the frosting exactly like the recipe stated, I didn't like the consistency, it was a little too thick. So I added just a little bit of water (maybe a 1/4 cup) and stirred it in real good and then frosted the brownies. The frosting ended up being the perfect glaze I was looking for! Great recipe and easy and quick to make."
"2","5","These brownies are the best ever and easy clean up too they are very moist i made mine with wheat and oat flour and organic turbanao sugar worked out awsome!!"
"2","3","I made this only half an hour ago and contrary to the blurb on the recipe page this did not turn out! I has a very cake consistency, looks nothing like the picture and it fell apart when i turned it out. I followed the instructions exactly. Tasted ok thought, might make a trifle with it. I also made the same recipe but i added 3/4 cup of chunky peanut butter and we will see how that goes but im pretty sure its worked out better."
"2","5","These brownies were excellent! I didn't use the frosting, from the recipe."
"2","5","This was my first time ever making brownies from scratch and they were the best ever! I wanted them chewy instead of cakey so I took some reviewers' advice and used half the eggs. Also, one reviewer suggested adding about a teaspoon of instant coffee. I tried that and it really does bring out the chocolate flavor. I didn't make the glaze, but they were fine without it. These brownies are a keeper!"
"2","2","Followed the recipe exactly and these were not the best brownies I have ever had. Good texture, but nothing to rave about. I do prefer brownies made with a chocolate bar as opposed to powder."
"2","5","The title says it all!!!! these are the best brownies ever! we like never buy boxed brownies anymore, this is the recipe we used to make them. They are soooooo good, i make them for my family all the time! If you like mint, try adding a little bit of mint extract to the batter, and you have mint brownies! i do this almost every time i make them, and they are amazing!"
"2","5","A bit more cake-like than I am used to but good non-the-less."
"2","5","Ijust made these for the second time and they came out perfect. I doubled what the recipe calls for and baked in 9x13' pan. I also added about 3/4 cup of peanut butter to the batter and it mixed right in since the batter was still warm. I baked them for 28 minutes at 350 and they came out PERFECTLY baked and SO delicious!"
"2","5","Great recipe! I will definatly make this again!"
"2","3","Good brownies, more cake-like than I was expecting."
"2","5","i love this recipe, it is delicious and i didnt even make the frosting with it. also when i doubled the recipe they turn out chewier, fudgier, and yummier"
"2","4","This is a very sweet recipe! The brownies dont get the crust on top like they should but Since the icing was very runny when i first made it (I dont know why people were saying it was thick)I just poured the icing on top while it was still hot, and I let it soak into the brownies.The brownies were rather dense, not the fudgy stuff I was looking forward to. This is a great recipe for someone with a sweet tooth. Overall, I will probably make again!!"
"2","4","These brownies were okay. For those finding these brownies to be too dry, use applesauce instead of butter and use brown sugar instead of white. This will insure more moisture in your baking. I also added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips for more flavour. I don't like icing on my brownies so I left them as is."
"2","5","Delicious brownies! I am definetly not a fan of cakey brownies, and I was a bit worried that these would turn out just that, as some reviewers lamented, but I was really craving brownies and thought I would just go ahead and give this recipe a try. I'm sure glad I did because these brownies are perfect! They baked up very chocolatey and extra chewy; not cake-like at all. Really, these were just like the texture that packaged mixes yield (and that is a good thing for someone who is totally nuts over chewy brownies), but the taste is much more rich and complex than any box. The best thing about this recipe was that it gave me the opportunity to share the magic of brownies with my Finnish husband, who has never tasted them. Here in Finland, where we live, you also can't find packaged brownie mixes, so stumbling across this recipe was an extra boon for me... and, being that I'm 7 months pregnant, it's even nicer to find an easy, yet excellent tasting recipe to sate these frequent sweet-food cravings I've been having. Mmmmm, yum!!! One thing to note, I didn't make the frosting, as I'm just not a frosting-brownie-type of person, but I thought I would note for any would-be attempters of this recipe: Don't mind the bad reviews that mention the frosting as the problem. The brownies are perfect, and you can always try a different frosting if you aren't sure about the one that this recipe suggests. It's all about the brownies, and the frosting is only an after thought."
"2","1","I can't believe this recipe is rated four and a half stars. All those people must like a tasteless cake brownie! I would never make these again. I've had many box brownies that are 100 percent better than this. Save yourself the trouble and don't make these."
"2","2","Didn't like these at all. The sugar taste is overwhleming. The frosting was okay, but had a funny aftertaste. I may try them again to see if they turn out better, since these are so highly rated. But, as of now, I wouldn't recommend this recipe."
"2","2","I am an excellent baker and these brownies were dull and dry. I'll stick to my other recipe."
"2","5","Wow! I've been using the deep dish brownie recipe from this site for about a year now on the regular, but THIS recipe really is the best. Doesn't even need any kind of frosting. If you're looking for a cake-like brownie, stay away from this. It's not cakey,or really chewy, but it's pretty good. If you're trying to impress someone, try this is the recipe."
"2","5","I am rating this 5 stars even though it's not my favorite because I am certain that I followed this recipe to the 'T' and the brownies taste exactly as they should. They are VERY good but I prefer a brownie that has more of a dark chocolate taste. Perhaps next time I make them I will use less vanilla or something. I don't know since this was the very first time I have ever made brownies from scratch. My brownie of choice has been Duncan Hines' Dark Chocolate fudge brand. Maybe I expected too much from this recipe? The only thing I didn't do with this recipe is make the frosting only because I am a brownie purist so to speak and therefore don't believe in frosting them. They should be able to stand on their own. this brownie does that. However this review is coming from a woman that eats 70% dark chocalate bars and thinks it is almost not dark enough. Happy cooking everyone!"
"2","4","these were great. however, I think I should've left mine in just a little longer than I did, I baked them for about 25 min and they seemed a little too moist. I used the chocolate frosting, I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of that, and then I went over them with a little vanilla glaze, zig-zagging back and forth (just for presentation). I think it all depends on how long you leave them in for though.. its all according to how you like your brownies done."
"2","5","This is a fantastic recipe! I will never buy boxed brownie mix again. Delicious and moist and yummy. I took someone's advice and did not beat the ingredients in, but rather stirred them. That made for a less cake-like and more chewy texture. I also added chocolate chips as the last ingredient and that made them extra special. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","These brownies are awesome! The frosting comes out pretty thick and hard to spread, so I add a generous amount of chocolate wine sauce (we live close to Napa) to the frosting; that really softens it up and makes it easier to spread on the brownies without destroying them. Thanks for an easy and yummy recipe!"
"2","5","First time making homemade brownies, and I loved them! The second time I tried to make them, I thought I'd cheat. I doubled the recipe and used a bigger pan! BIG MISTAKE! They were hard and overcooked on the edge and mush in the middle. Definitely doesn't have the interchangable pan option like box mixes do - so use an 8x8 pan, and they'll turn out beautifully!"
"2","5","Considering how easy these brownies are to make I think they are wonderful. After 15 minutes in the oven they are perfect even though they don't look like they will taste as fabulous as they do. The frosting might look at first like it will not mix and be very dry but be persistent. Keep mixing and it turns out just like the Betty Crocker frosting consistency. Try adding milk, dark and white choc bits to the mix to make a triple choc brownie for a special occasion."
"2","5","I sprinkled shredded coconut and pecans on top of batter before baking. These were delicious."
"2","5","Best brownies ever. Doubled recipe in a 9X13 pan and took advice of cutting back one egg and added a little milk to frosting. Hand whisked egg and mixed rest with spoon."
"2","5","I am trying to figure out what went wrong, for the people who gave this recipe a bad rating; these are the most delicious brownies I think I have ever made in my life, and I have made a lot of brownies. They are gooey without tasting underdone, they are sinfully rich as far as chocolate flavor; I frosted them, as per another user's suggestion, ten minutes out of the oven--I did use a few drops of milk, to make the frosting spreadable--and the frosting is to die for. I do understand the one -star rater who said she did not like the honey taste in the frosting--though it is very mild--but that could be easily remedied by leaving it out entirely. I have to wonder what the one-star raters LIKE in brownies. This recipe is perfect. It is a keeper, and will be THE recipe in our house from now on."
"2","3","The only bad thing about this recipe is the icing. I had to microwave it for 20 seconds, because it looked more like a cookie dough than icing (thats how thick it was), After though it settled okay, I'm no crazy about it, but the brownies themselves were VERY good. I won't make the icing again, but i will make the brownies!"
"2","5","quickest cake-like brownie recipe to date. I omitted the chocolate sauce since it didn't seem too appealing."
"2","5","I have a full house of people. Everyone LOVES these brownies instead of birthday cake they ask for these. I have made these brownies about 12 times and always comes out perfect!!!! Spread the frosting about 10 mins out of oven."
"2","1","this is the first time i have given a recipe 1 star. may be i did something wrong when i made these. but i still think there are far better brwonie recipes on this site."
"2","5","I raise my voice in testimony to the deliciousness of these brownies. They are definitely competitive with mixes. I did not make the frosting, but I did sprinkle the top with chocolate chips. While this was delicious, it was not necessary, as the brownies themselves are very rich and chocolatey."
"2","5","Best brownies I've ever tasted."
"2","5","Very good, easy and quick. I don't know if there is something missing in the recipe but I had to add a little milk to the icing mixture, about a tablespoon I'd say. No biggie, these are gooey, rich and delicious."
"2","5","I have tried alot of brownies recipes and this is exactly what I have been looking for. Chewy, not cakey at all. This will be my forever brownie recipe. Thankyou"
"2","5","These were the best brownies I have ever made. They taste like the brownies you buy in the bakeries. I added some crushed white chocolate to mine and they were fab!!! A keeper."
"2","4","The brownies were very tasty but the icing was hard to spread and took a while to make."
"2","1","These were bad! I think that everyone who liked them must have just liked the frosting because these brownies were BLAND. I made them exactly according to the recipe and I got cake that had no flavor. I could barely taste the chocolate. Brownies are supposed to be at least a little bit chewy and these were not chewy. That's what makes brownies brownies and not just chocolate cake. I can't fathom how so many people rated this recipe so highly."
"2","5","I've made two batches already this week! Easy as the box mix, but tastes so much better."
"2","5","this really is the BEST! i use carob powder which is sweeter than cocoa so i reduced the sugar... and this turned out great!"
"2","5","one word: amazing. I've made these brownies twice now and they come out fantastic. The edges are a little hard, but I just cut those off. The first time I didn't make the icing, but I didn't make that mistake the second time. Be warned, it is a thick icing, but it tastes so good, there are no words to describe how good it is. Be patient when you're making it as I was very skeptical, but it does turn out. It did take me a few minutes to spread the icing out, but in the end, my time was well worth it."
"2","4","This is a truly fudgy brownie. However, the frosting did not turn out as written. It needed some milk to thin out and make it spreadable. I did not care for the frosting but the brownie was delicious."
"2","5","This tasted great!!! These were more like a cake to me than a brownie, but who cares as long as it tastes great!! I did not make the frosting and I loved them anyway! Thanks for sharing your recipe:)"
"2","2","Okay, I definitely do not know what the fuss is about. I tried making them twice. The first time I stuck to the original recipe. They were a cake like consistency, but very dense. The second time I omitted the baking powder, trying to get a fudgier consistency. I don't like how the icing gets hard and it doesn't even look appetizing. Definitely not what I expected and would not make ever again."
"2","5","This recipe was absolutely delicious. Beats any store bought brownie mix anytime. I skipped the topping and added walnuts instead. Will definitely make it again and again. Thanks Angie!"
"2","5","Hands down, best brownie recipe I've come across in a long time! I always double the recipe because they disappear so quickly! =)  I'm making these for Christmas treats this year."
"2","5","OH MAN! These really are the best brownies! I'll never buy a boxed mix again. I followed the recipe to a T...and they turned out great. I even fooled my mother-in-law...she thought I went to the bakery :o)Ssshhhh, that will be our little secret. To make the icing more spreadable I just zapped it in the microwave for a few seconds."
"2","5","Yummy and moist! Sometimes we add a tablespoon of peanut butter to the batter. I 'flour' the pan w/ a cocoa & sugar mix."
"2","5","These were very yummy! I had a craving for some chocolate and didn't have anything at hand except ingredients to make brownies and I chose this recipe. I am so glad I did, these were so good! Definitely recommend them! And they were easy and fast to make also!"
"2","5","Holy cow these were super good and chocolaty! These were also very easy to make. My six year old helped make them and we had lots of fun. The only modification we made was that we added a handful to semi sweet chocolate chips. I have to say that I liked them better without the frosting though. My husband and son gobbled these up in a flash."
"2","5","I have made these five times and every time they turn out wonderful!!!!!!! Better than any othere recipes I have tried on here.....One time I added toasted coconut to the glaze and added it on top of the brownies..my boyfriend's mom loved it.....and then one time I added butterscotch chips to the batter for a party and I DIDN'T HAVE ANY LEFT.........THANKS for the recipe"
"2","5","WONDERFUL BROWNIES! i subsituted the butter with apple sauce, and used splenda instead of normal sugar. it turned out GREAT! but one thing is that they were very thin even though i used 8 inch cake pan. this recipe would be even better if the ingredients r doubled. it didnt turn out as some reviewers said to be cakey. it was chewy and just right. i will definitly make these again. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!"
"2","5","I tried this as brownies first and then while I was making cookies, I decided to tweek the recipe a bit. I added a bit more flour, bringing the total up to 3/4 cup, and used them as cookie dough. I only baked them about 10 minutes, when completely cooled I frosted them with a chocolate buttercream frosting and added a walnut half on top. They were the first of all the cookies I made to go, everyone was begging for the recipe. YUMMY! Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","This is just the perfect brownie recipe. Everyone liked them better than the boxed kind (which is hard to beat!) I had some extra mini-chocolate chips on hand so I tossed some of those in the batter and it was delightful and not too gooey and not cakey and not too fudgy. YUM!"
"2","2","I wanted fudgy brownies to send with my friend to college. These taste like the packaged mixes to me (though I didn't use the frosting). I was to lazy to go out and buy unsweetend chocolate for a truly fudgy and chocolatly, and i thought this one would be fine with all the great reviews."
"2","2","These were okay,but tasted more like fudge than brownies and the frosting was way to thick. I will be finding a new brownie recipe."
"2","5","Delicious! I was craving brownies and found this recipe - what luck! A friend was over for coffee and we ate half the pan. Instead of the frosting, I sprinkled a mixture of semi-sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips over the top while they were still warm and then spread them a bit once melted. Next time, I think I may try drizzling the chips or may even try drizzling with caramel. Thanks for a great recipe."
"2","5","These brownies were easy to make and turned out perfect. I used a Dutch cocoa powder (Droste) and the flavor of the brownie and frosting were great. (I did leave out the honey.)"
"2","5","These def are the ultimate brownies. Very rich and yummy. I double the recipe and bake in a 13x9 inch aluminum tin for 35 minutes at 350-and they come out perfect. If you really want to impress- make a brownie trifle with these-leave out the icing and do a layer of chocolate mouse(Hersheys chocolate mousse recipe on this site) and a layer of homeade whipped cream(2cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip in chilled bowl with chilled wisk or paddles)! ABSOLUTELY to die for! If you don't have honey on hand for the icing you can use 1tsp light corn syrup and I always add 1-2 tbs milk to make it a nice consistency."
"2","5","these are the best brownies ever. everyone wants the recipe. don't change  a thing."
"2","5","i wanted to make a chocolate chip cookie on the bottom, brownie on top bar. i used this recipe for the brownie part though i did make some changes. i left out the baking powder and substitued a chocolate pudding mix for the cocoa. i baked it in a circle pizza pan. they came out excellent! very chewy and very moist, and mixes well with the cookie bottom."
"2","5","These are the best homemade brownies, and by far better than any box brownie!"
"2","5","So delicious! Everyone loved these. The only thing I changed was to add a little milk to the frosting to get it to blend well, just as others have suggested. Thanks Angie for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Fantastic! I added some chocolate chips and lowered the temp to adjust for my oven, and they were cooked perfectly in 25 minutes. Very rich and dense and absolutely wonderful."
"2","5","Like other reviewers, I left out the baking powder. I really love dense, chewy brownies, and this recipe ended up more of a cross between chewy and cake-like. I did use Nutella as a quick and delicious chocoalte-hazelnut frosting, and with chocolate chips in the batter, the brownies ended up being the perfect amount of chocolate for my coworkers!"
"2","5","These were great, and the frosting made them even better! but I was looking for a more dense brownie, these were more like a cake."
"2","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had."
"2","3","These brownies were just okay. Very dense and sweet. I prefer something chewier."
"2","5","Great recipe. I never made brownies from scratch until now. I got so many compliments and everyone wanted the recipe. This one is definately a keeper. It is so easy to make too."
"2","5","I omitted the frosting, and instead topped the warm brownies with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce. just as good (if not better) than restaurant brownie sundaes!!"
"2","4","Really chocolatey, gooey, rich, and delicious! Best of all, easy to make!!!"
"2","5","Great recipe! I followed advice and omitted honey from frosting and added a little milk. They were a big hit--thanks!"
"2","4","pretty good without the sauce. And added less salt like others suggested. Also added pecans and was delicious."
"2","5","These brownies are awesome. I made them one night when my husband had to pull an all-nighter and I felt like he needed a little treat to keep him awake. My only complaint about the recipe is that the brownies are kind of short and thin. I've made them again several times and I used 1 and a half times the recipes to make them thicker. I haven't quite figured out the cooking time with the increased batter but we prefer them a little thicker. For the first part of the recipe, I just melted the butter in the microwave. I didn't see any reason to get a pan dirty. Several people mentioned that the frosting was too thick and dry, I just added less powdered sugar. Someone suggested milk, which I tried the first time but didn't really work for me. These brownies are yummy and the great thing about the recipe is that you can make them with ingredients you normally keep in your pantry."
"2","5","I'm only rating the brownie as 5 stars, like some other reviewers, I don't use this frosting. I melt some chocolate chips with heavy cream to make a ganache-type icing, and let it set up before cutting. Use a very small spatula to remove them individually from the pan when cool. Quick and easy recipe. Thanks."
"2","1","Don't know how this recipe got so many stars, I was expecting some great brownies. These were very plain, dry & cake like. I followed the recipe exactly, other than I mixed by hand rather than using a mixer. Won't make again."
"2","5","Great recipe, but I want to share some wisdom that I hope you will add as a note in your recipe. Some one mentioned having trouble getting the brownies out of their pan. I always put foil in my pans when making brownies, for one important reason. I don't have to clean the pan, score! Plus, I can just store them as is, move them easily, even cutting them is easier because I don't have to deal with the sides of the pan. The big thing is the less mess, though. Mmm, they taste so good..."
"2","5","Absolutely delicious. I swore I would never bake another homemade brownie because Duncan Heinz are so good but these were fantastic. everyone ate them up in minutes!"
"2","5","This is a GREAT recipe. Its easy to double the batch or add nuts and/or chocolate chips. Great if you like a little chewy! I haven't tried the frosting I don't think they need them."
"2","5","These brownies are great. I made them a few nights ago for dessert for the family, and everyone loved them, as usual. I must admit that it's not my favorite brownie recipe - but these were rich and delicious, and definitely take 2nd place in my book. That's high praise, too; I've made lots of brownies in my time. The frosting is great, as well, but it needs 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar instead of 1 cup and a tablespoon of milk mixed in. This creates more of a glaze and it's MUCH better that way!"
"2","5","Holy sh**, that is the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. Frosting is unbelievable; it's the honey that does it."
"2","4","These brownies are great if you are looking for a fudge-like consistency. If you prefer a cake-like brownie, I don't think you would like this recipe as much. I took these to a church dinner and had mixed reviews based on the consistency."
"2","5","The family loved them, they were gone in 2 days. I was lazy and used icing in a can but it was just as well!"
"2","5","These truly are the BEST brownies. I doubled the recipe, put in a 9 x 13 pan, and baked for 27 mins; otherwise, I didn't change a thing. HINT: the better the cocoa, the better the brownies. I used Scharffen Berger and Giardelli - awesome!"
"2","1","These suck."
"2","5","Very good Brownies. To all that asked themselves 'Why am I buying $2.00+ for a brownie box in the store?', I asked myself the same question! This recipe is better than the box you get from the store! A LOT BETTER!   this is my first time doing this recipe, and it is perfect but revised a bit. I used all recipe indicated but made 2/3c of cocoa instead. When mixing the batter/brownie I left the mixer going for a while for more chewy brownie. Also, added 1/2 c of macadamia nuts (chopped) and 1/4c white mini morsels and 1/2c semi sweet mini morsels. THIS BROWNIE IS THE BOMB!!!!   For the frosting, I omitted the honey but added the whole milk instead ONE TABLESPOON AT A TIME. REALLY DEPENDS ON THE CONSISTENCY you want!!! I think that is the biggest mistake everybody made from the past reviews that i've read.... Also, I want more milk chocolate-y rather than the cocoa flavor so I added about a 2-3 tablespoon of NESQUICK. This one really depends on the taste of the person cooking and eating the brownies. we love nesquick so that's what I added. YOu can use hershey syrup or powder or CARNATION oR GIRARDELLI CHOCOLATE...  I gotta go! I gotta eat more brownies... Sorry to those ones who didn't follow the recipe correctly 'cause they are missing out!!!!!"
"2","5","This is a great recipe - definitely a keeper. Brownies are quite decadent and taste/look almost 'gourmet' with a grown-up taste. Thanks for a great recipe."
"2","3","very 'cakey' if that is an adjective :) definately tasted more like choc cake than brownie not bad but I will prolly keep looking."
"2","5","These are to die for!! I did make a few changes, such as adding 3 tsp of milk and omitting the honey, melting the butter before adding to the frosting, and for the brownies themselves, I used a smaller round cake pan and baked for about 18-20 minutes, they turned out sooo fudgy! Not cake-like at all!! I may have added more milk to the icing...I just added drop by drop until it was smooth enough and more like an 'icing' type spread, it turned out very shiny and not at all grainy and impossible to spread(as my first attempt)I also found the texture of the brownie changes if beaten for too long (turns cake-like) and now use a wooden spoon (200 strokes)to mix."
"2","5","This is a great recipe in terms of, ease of use, taste and time. I don't use any other after trying this."
"2","4","This was good, but not as good as my usual brownie recipe.I'll stick to the one on the Hershey's cocoa box.Thank you for sharing."
"2","5","whoever she is, angie has nailed a sensational brownie recipe. for the uber-chocolate experience, add a couple more tbs. cocoa to both the brownie batter and the frosting. you can also take these over the top as mint brownies by using the mint creme portion of a brownie recipe by s.hynek on this site. spread the creme while the brownies are warm (not hot), then hit them with angie's frosting after the mint layer has set. diets were left in dissarray when i brought these to my wife's family's christmas dinner."
"2","5","Decadent and delicious. And I'm not even a chocolate fan such as my husband.  I had to cook mine about 15 minutes longer than the recipe states. My brownies came out fudgy, but not too fudgy. The frosting is missing an ingredient: you'll want to add 1-2 tsp. of water. There isn't enough wet ingredients, otherwise.  This was my first attempt at making brownies from scratch, and all I can say is those boxed companies are making a fortune! Try this recipe; you won't be disappointed!"
"2","1","I don't know what happened, but these brownies were the 'worst' brownies I have ever had. Will not use recipe again."
"2","5","10 stars easily!! These are so good that if 'Death by Chocolate' were possible, I would go for it! I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter. I also, melted the frosting on the stove to a liquid consistancy before spreading them on the brownies. I could faint! These are so delicious!!"
"2","5","I have made these many times and get lots of complimants each time. I have found that if you heat the icing a little and then pour it over the brownies it spreads very easily. It then hardens to a nice consistency. I have also used the creamy chocolate frosting on this site and found that it's mild chocolate flavor goes well with these rich brownies. I usually double the recipe and frost half while leaving the other half unfrosted. Also swirl a little chocolate syrup onto the top of the brownie batter before baking. These gives them a really gooey consistency- which is how I like my brownies. My husband even loves these and he is not a brownie fan. Thank you so much for this recipe."
"2","1","Sorry, I thought these were beyond ordinary and would not make again. The kids didn't even like them. Kind of bitter tasting and just something not quite right with them."
"2","5","I took the advise of another and dbl'd the recipe without the baking powder. I used a 9x13 (greased well) and baked it for 32 min., it is better to underbake than overbake. I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe by Tracy on this site YUM! Perfect match. Excellent Brownie! OMIT THE BAKING POWDER(for fudgy brownies)My son says these should be illegal."
"2","4","When I want chocolate, I want chocolate! These brownies could have used more. It could be because I didn't ice them (not a big icing fan). But I did add walnuts. I tripled the recipe because I needed a lot. I baked them for 25 minutes and they came out perfect! - nice and soft, the way I like them."
"2","5","these are great, need to double it if more than two people are going to consume it. was gone in minutes."
"2","5","These ARE the best brownies in the world. You are crazy if you omit the icing... the brownies cOUld stand on their own, they're that good, but the icing is a whole other kind of awesome. If you have trouble spreading the icing, here's what I do: wait until the brownies have cooled to just barely warm. Drop the icing in spoonfuls onto the brownies in the pan, let it warm up for a few seconds, then put either plastic wrap or a little plastic baggie over your hand and spread the icing with your fingers. Does the trick every time."
"2","4","I used less sugar and half the amount of egg, more cocoa powder and doubled the recipe. I mixed in half a bag of Andes Mint Baking Pieces and sprinkled the other half on top. The brownies are great except for the fact that next time I will mix all the mint chips into the batter! I think next time I will also use the amount of cocoa recommended in the recipe. Overall a very good dessert."
"2","3","This brownie was ok. Nothing special. Guess I was expectitng something really Great, but I could of used a regular boxed brownie mix..and it would of tasted the same."
"2","5","These brownies are very yummy! If your frosting comes out too dry like mine always does, just add a little milk to make it creamy before using."
"2","5","This recipe turned out so delicious. The first time I tried this recipe, I added 1 cup of miniature chocolate chips and 1 cup of walnuts. I omitted the icing. Now it's the only way I make them and this will always be my brownie recipe."
"2","2","I would not have had a problem with these brownies if they had simply turned out to be fudgey brownies. I don't see how you can even consider these to be brownies. They were like mushy fudge-the nastiest consistency for a brownie. If I want fudge, I'll make fudge not brownies. I couldn't even pick up a square of brownie and have it stay intact. The only way to eat them was with a fork or you would get covered in crumbling goo. I will never make these brownies again. I had to add milk to the frosting like a number of people noted. If I make the frosting again I will lessen the vanilla if not omit it completely. I thought it was overpowering."
"2","5","I wasn't sure about these when they first came out of the oven; I used double dutched cocoa and they didn't look too appetizing. But after they were frosted and cooled, I put them in the refrigerator. They are so good! Kind of like fudge - best if refrigerated -(easy to cut with a wet knife-and they don't crumble when cut) they don't dry out like other brownies. My husband(who is not a 'chocoholic') said they are 'gourmet brownies' and kept eating them. I doubled recipe and made in a 9x13 pan. Don't bake more than 25 minutes. I also changed the honey in the frosting to corn syrup, and had to add liquid- I used cream (1/2 & 1/2). They get better after the first day!"
"2","5","The name is truly accurate--these ARE the BEST brownies! I love to bake and had settled on a good basic recipe using cocoa. This recipe--melting the butter first and using the same pan to mix the remaining ingredients--is simple and the result is bakery-quality. The icing did need about a tablespoon of milk as others stated. That was the one thing I changed as far as the main recipe is concerned. I also had come Maraschino cherries and added some to the top of the icing to give a little color and extra 'black forest' type taste. Fresh raspberries are also good on top. These are the BEST and I will be baking brownies with this recipe from here on out!"
"2","3","They were good, but these brownies weren't 'cakey' enough for my taste. I like sweets, but too much sugar which I felt deterred from the chocolate flavor!"
"2","4","The first batch I made was very good, make sure you UNDERCOOK them if you like them gooey! My husband took them to work and they were gone in seconds. The second batch (that he demanded I make when he got home from work that day), well, they are still hanging around in the freezer. I cooked them a smidge too long and they are sort of cakey. Also I ran out of vanilla extract so I used peppermint with decent results, just don't put peppermint in the frosting.. too much mint. Feels like I just ate a breath mint when I eat one! But overall good brownie, but I am sill searching for 'the one'."
"2","5","If I could give this recipe more stars, I would. It is a great recipe. The brownies are so good. I put them in the refrigerator over night, and they're even better. I took them to work clients, they ate the whole plate in 2 hours! They loved them! Excellent recipe.. if it tastes bad, there must be something wrong with the cook! haha.. (don't mean it in a mean way)... Love the recipe! Love the cook!"
"2","5","I have to admit that at first I was a little hesitant about making these brownies, especially the frosting. But they are incredible. My whole family and I loved them. They are fantastic."
"2","1","Nasty!!!! They tasted like cake with no flavor. Noone ate them at the 4th of July party."
"2","4","Very good brownie. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I'm not sure about the frosting/icing. I can never get it to blend nicely unless I melt the margarine, and then it seems kind of oily on the top (after I've frosted the brownie). I let a paper towel set on it for a while to fix this, but would rather not do it that way. Otherwise, very good -- my husband's favorite!"
"2","4","These taste alot like a boxed mix. I'm not sure they are worth the extra work. My frosting wasn't spreadable until I added about a TB of milk. These are really good, but I probably will only use the recipe if I run out of a boxed mix, not in lieu of one."
"2","5","Great moist brownies. I did not make the icing and they were still wonderful."
"2","5","They really are the best brownies!! I made them tonight and it was quick and easy. I did use 1/2 cups of cocoa as suggested by another reviewer. It was not to fudgey at all it was just right. I topped it off with fresh whipped cream. Boy oh boy they were the greatest. Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","I have never been successful in my past attempts to make homemade brownies, but these really easy to make and they tasted better than the box kind. I think next time I will leave off the frosting, the brownies are rich enough on their own."
"2","5","This made a delicious brownie. The fudgy flavor of the icing was also wonderful. I couldn't actually taste the honey as some had mentioned but it was yummy. The icing is so thick that if you didn't put it on while brownies were HOT, it would likely not melt enough to spread well."
"2","5","This is a must try! These are scrumptous warm and very fudgy. This is the way a brownie should be. I didn't get around to trying the frosting - they went too fast and didn't have a chance. Also really easy to do and so fast to bake and have cleaned up. Thanks for this recipe it is a keeper!"
"2","5","truly great brownies. Moist, great texture...delicious!!"
"2","3","Not my favorite brownies but still good enough to make again."
"2","3","This is the second time I've tried this recipe, and it came out the same way - a little dry and cake like. I don't understand what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. The taste was good but it was not fudgy at all. Maybe I'll try a little less flour next time."
"2","5","The frosting on these was fudgy and decadent. Be sure to warm the frosting before spreading-- it's much easier that way. DON'T water it down with milk-- it ruins the fudge-like results. After spreading the frosting, I returned the brownies to the oven for one minute and then used a rubber spreader to spread the icing around one more time, to ensure an even application. These were not cakey at all for me-- they were very dense and fudgy, and my husband said they tasted just like the ones from his favorite childhood bakery. I'm sorry some people had bad luck with these, because I thought they were perfect!"
"2","5","These brownies were very good... moist and chewy. I did not make the icing for the top but left them plain. I think next time I will place mini peanut butter cups in the pan before baking."
"2","1","I used this recipe only because I was looking for a brownie frosting recipe to use with another brownie recipe. I will never use this again. The frosting was way too thin and pasty and difficulty to spread, even though I put it on immediately after taking the pan out of the oven. It also tasted a bit strange with the honey. Next time I will take the other reviewers' suggestions to add a little milk to the frosting."
"2","5","The name of this recipe says it all. They were fantastic and got gobbled up instantly. I made them without the frosting and just sprinkled icing sugar on top. Thanks!"
"2","5","My father, who's a chocolate-lover, adored these. I actually put the mix into a cake pan so I ended up with brownie-cake. I added milk to the frosting because it was too pasty, and the frosting became a bit runny when I frosted the warm cake but it still turned out great. I also added round sprinkles to make the cake pretty once it had cooled. I liked them so much I gave all my friends a piece the next day and they all loved it!"
"2","5","great recipe! Mine took a little longer to bake, but they were delicious and moist when done!"
"2","4","They werent my favorite brownies and i dont think they should be on the hall of fame, the frosting was too thick and honey tasting."
"2","4","These are very dense, fudgey, rich, and chocolatey. If you are look for a cakey or chewy brownie, these are not for you. A lot of reviewers had a problem with the thick frosting, make as the recipe states then put in on the brownie as soon as it comes out of the oven. The frosting will melt, making it easier to spread then set up as it cools into an almost candy-like consistency, making the brownies even more fudgelike."
"2","3","These were pretty good, but a little cake-like. I also added some milk to make the frosting more manageable."
"2","5","These are definitely the best brownies! My family are big chocolate fans, and they thought these were great! They are very rich. I'd recommend these to any chocolate lover. Thanks Angie!"
"2","5","really moist and a hit- added a little milk to the frosting to make more of a frosting- otherwise terrific!"
"2","5","These brownies were fantastic! They didn't last a day. I had everything on hand except the vanilla and they still tasted great. Mine came out fudgey and had the crinkled top that we love. I didn't have a square pan so I used a glass pie pan instead. They took about 20 minutes. I will definately make these again only doubling the recipie."
"2","2","These are fine if you're merely looking for a quick recipe and a sweet fix. They turned out very cake-like and a bit dry (and I even baked for a few minutes LESS than required). My personal preference is a moist, dense, crusty-topped brownie, so I was disappointed. My guy loves brownies and wouldn't touch them after the first piece. Thanks for sharing, but we'll continue to use the 'Chewiest Brownie' recipe on this site which better suits our tastes."
"2","4","These are delicious. Mine were fairly gooey, but they should be perfect after sitting for awhile. The frosting was thick and difficult to spread, but it looked smooth when the brownies were cool. Yum!"
"2","5","I rarely follow a recipe exactly. Because this one was so simple and quick, I did (OK, I added a handful of walnutes. It's turned out wonderful. I didn't even bother with the frosting."
"2","5","These brownies were delicious. Absolutely the best brownies I've ever tasted!"
"2","5","These are fabulous brownies!! I did not change a thing and will make these often for my children!! Thank you so much for the recipe!"
"2","5","Without a doubt these are the best brownies I've ever made from scratch. They are so moist and delicious that the frosting isn't even necessary...but it does make them even better!! Another keeper!"
"2","5","I substituted peppermint extract for the vanilla in the frosting and put crushed candy canes on top...perfect for christmas!"
"2","4","my friend like it very much"
"2","5","I have been looking for the perfect brownie recipe. This is it! Easy to make and they taste great! I didn't even make the frosting. They are so good!"
"2","5","The absolute easiest recipe for brownies I've ever tried, and they were *amazing*! My sister doesn't even like chocolate and she nearly polished off half the brownies. They're so wonderful for chocolate cravings. I didn't put frosting on them, they're amazing without it."
"2","5","Excellent recipe, easy to make, I even made some adjustments and it turned out even better(if that was even possible). I added walnuts, and doubled the recipe, because I found that the brownies weren't thick enough. I didn't double the icing recipe portion, instead I spread it on in thin clumps making it the best brownies anyone in my family has ever tasted!"
"2","4","The icing was really good in this recipe. I added a little cream though. Should be cooked longer than 30 minutes though."
"2","5","The icing wasn't necessary. These were good enough to eat without it!"
"2","5","very good! I didn't make the frosting and we still love them."
"2","1","Not for me...All I could taste was the honey..."
"2","4","I didn't see what size pan to use, so I used a 13x9 inch pan. This was definitely not enough mixture for this pan. I made another batch and added it to the pan and it filled the pan up, but the final brownies were not thick like brownies. They were more like cookie height. Maybe I will use a smaller pan or quadruple the recipe to fit my pan. I tried them with the icing and they were too sweet for me, but my husband loved them. I will definitely make these again. The pan thing didn't get me down but just challenged me a little to use my head. This is the first time I have ever made brownies from scratch. This was just too easy to make. Next time I will try them with some nuts. Thanks"
"2","4","Yummy! At first look, I thought the brownies were cakey (and i definitely don't like cakey brownies) but these turned out great! I still love the store bought boxes but if you don't have any on hand here's a superb substitute! I also liked that it stayed moist for more than a few days. Thanks Angie!"
"2","5","What everybody else said. This is an easy, delicious recipe. Mine came out more cakey than fudgey, but it's definitely tasty. After reading the reviews, I put a little milk (less than 2 tablespoons) into the frosting, and it came out smooth. I might skip the milk next time, just to see how the original recipe is supposed to taste!"
"2","5","This was the first time a homemade brownie recipe turned out so well. They are usually dry. I did add 2 tablespoons of whipping cream to the frosting. Next time I will do as some of the others and try heating it. I thank you but my hips sure don't! LOL"
"2","5","I made this recipes a few times already because it was so delicous. Everyone loves them and I never have leftovers. It is just as easy as making brownies from the box. I highly recommend this recipe. Not only do the kids love them, so do the adults."
"2","3","The frosting is way too sweet--brownies are tasty!"
"2","5","Almost as easy as a box and absolutely delicious! I like crispy topped brownies, so I didn't use the frosting. Remember to mix some of the warm butter with the eggs so they do not scramble."
"2","5","This recipe was great and very easy to make. I added some chocolate chips in the second time I made it, which made it even better."
"2","5","Absolutely Delicious! I'm a kid I should know! They're real easy to make. And smell ssooooo good"
"2","5","YUMM-EE!"
"2","5","These brownies turned out GREAT! Very fast to make also - to make the brownies without the frosting only takes 10 minutes! But the frosting adds a nice decadence! I made them both ways. Frosting did seem difficult at first, seemed too solid, BUT I just kind of patted it onto to the warm brownies with a moist butter knife and they turned out AWESOME. Also, I doubled the recipe and baked in in a 9x9 ceramic type (Chantal) dish, adding 10-15 minutes and they came out nice and thick, evenly baked - no overcooked edges at all. I'll probably never buy the mix brownies again!"
"2","5","Easy and delicious -will make a brownie lover out of anyone!"
"2","5","2/15/03 Added note...I have a theory: you have to WAIT FOR THE BUTTER TO COOL quite a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients to it. OTHERWISE the brownies turn out DRY AND CAKE-LIKE. (This may be the reason for the dryness that others have experienced). Brownies normally turn out moist and fudge-y for me, and the only time they didn't turn out was when I mixed all the ingredients while the butter was still warm from melting. Again, it's just a theory, but I don't want to try mixing again with warm butter for fear of wasting another bad batch! Maybe the 'gurus' at allrecipes can put my theory to the test? This would alleviate the problems that some reviewers have experienced. When made 'correctly', this recipe truly yields the BEST BROWNIES.  True to it's description, these brownies really do 'ALWAYS turn out!' I've made them for get-togethers at least 7 times, (nothing but compliments every time), so I figured I ought to give it the 5 stars it deserves, plus put in my own 2 cents... I usually double the recipe, pour the batter into a 9x13 glass baking dish, leaving 1/2 plain, while dropping in a mix of peanut butter chips/chocolate chips into the other half (I dunk the chips so they're not exposed). It's like making two separate batches in one easy step! Thank you SO much, Angie, for this great recipe!"
"2","5","I have been using this recipe for several years now and love them! I get lots of requests for the recipe. Mine always turn out fudgy and moist.I do not put the frosting on them but once in awhile I put vanilla ice cream topped with choclate syrup, whipped cream and nuts for a very rich desert.A WINNER in my recipe box!"
"2","5","These are the BEST brownies in the world! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I cooked mine for 25 minutes and they turned out perfect. I love my brownies a little chewy. And the icing makes a wonderful final touch.I did add 2 tbls. of milk to make it easier to spread. If I had to describe this recipe in one word, it would be.....MMMMMM."
"2","5","The name says it all. I plan on looking no further and making this from now on. Thanks"
"2","5","Add a little more cocoa powder for extra chocolaty flavor!"
"2","5","This is the 1st time I make brownies, it is so quick and turn out great. The only difficulty I have is the frosting does not spread easily and when it is completely cool, it cracks a little when I cut. Any tips?"
"2","5","Loved them! Quick and easy and tasted great!"
"2","5","This is a great brownie recipe! I've always made brownies from a box mix and now I will use this easy recipe instead."
"2","5","Very good and delicious!!!!"
"2","5","Oh my gosh these are soooo good. They really are better the next day but they hardly ever stay around that long."
"2","5","So easy and delicious! A hit at a Memorial Day cook out."
"2","5","The absolute best brownies-everybody loves these. The best part is that if you bake you usually have all the ingredients on hand."
"1","5","I tried these brownies because my 16 year old requested homemade brownies for his birthday instead of a cake. I've never tried making homemade brownies. The only change I made to the brownies was I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I cooked all the ingredients for the icing on the stove and I added a tablespoon of milk to get the right consistency and I added a couple tablespoons of chocolate chips to the icing and about 1 tsp of corn syrup. They were delicious! The brownies had a fudgy consistency and were very moist. Everyone loved them. Great brownie recipe"
"1","5","This is the first time I've ever made brownies and it was incredibly easy! Why have I been buying mixes all these years? I cut the sugar in half for the brownie and it still tastes good. Next time I'll substitute yogurt for half the butter as well - but these changes are only because I want to make it a bit healthier for the kids."
"1","5","Wow! These were fabulous! Deep, dark chocolate and ultra fudgy. We loved the brownie part, so, I am rating this recipe on the brownie. I did have some problem with the icing. It was very dry and never became creamy. I added some heavy cream to it so I could spread it. I thought something was wrong with it as I tried to spread it on the warm brownies because it was melting and not spreading well. After they cooled though the frosting set up perfectly. I liked the frosting, but, my husband said he would prefer them without. Either way, they are a winner in my book!"
"1","4","Good recipe! If you add some heavy whipping cream into the frosting mixture, it is a much better consistency and helps with the frothy taste!"
"1","4","Hit my fudgy sweet tooth! I had to opt out of eggs and use an egg paste sub. and made a peanut butter frosting instead, but they turned out great! Not the best I've ever made, but great quick recipe. Not too sweet, but super chocolate. For those who have issues getting fudge like brownies, sift your flour and take them out a minute or two early. Its probably an issue of using too much four (so sift or use a little less) or overcooking. I cooked it for about 32-33 minutes."
"1","4","Maybe just my personal preference, but I didn't really like these as much as others. The test of a good brownie for me is if I prefer it without the icing. Not so in this case. But the husband liked them well enough."
"1","5","I made these brownies just as the recipe stated minus the frosting and they are amazing! The edges are still soft and these brownies are the perfect blend between cakey and fudgy. Just the right amount of chocolate and sugar. These are a must try! You will want to write this recipe down in your family recipe box!"
"1","5","These were SOOOOOO good even without the frosting! I added some chocolate chips in the batter"
"1","4","This is the first time I made it, it's so yummy I loved it!!! I made it today at around 3:30 and it gone (it's 5:30) lol it's the best I'm going to totally make this again!!????"
"1","5","I added about 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut, used brown sugar instead of white, and added about 1/4 chocolate chips instead of making frosting on top. My husband used expletives to describe how much he loved them!"
"1","4","Very delicious brownies. Not totally fudgy but certainly not cake-like. However, if you want your frosting to be frosting and not powder add a tablespoon of milk."
"1","4","This is an easy and delicious recipe, however I struggled with the frosting being too thick. I agree with some of the comments-melt the butter and use a little less powdered sugar. These are almost as easy as using a mix."
"1","5","Excellent even without the frosting. The texture is in-betwen cakey and fudgey. If you want it all fudgey, look elsewhere. To me, this is the ideal consistency, and I'd never bother with store-bought or boxed again. This is so easy because I always have the ingredients on hand. It's made of such basic things. Don't need to go buy chocolate chips, just use regular cocoa powder that I always have at home anyway. Since I don't keep confectioner's sugar around, I've never made the frosting, but I will do it if I make this for guests some time. I've made this three times in the past two weeks. My husband, a finicky eater, loves them too.   I throw the ingredients in the order the recipe states in my standing mixer, let it whirl on a fairly low setting a few minutes, and it turns out perfect."
"1","5","I've been looking for a homemade brownie recipe that was good for a while now. Being allergic to corn and soy makes it impossible for me to have box mix. I've tried several recipes over the years and this is, hands down, the best one I've made.I doubled the recipe so that I could make a 9 x 13 pan of them. I followed the recipe exactly. I did not, however, use the frosting. I wanted to see how the base recipe was for the first time. My husband asked that I add some chuck chocolate chips next time. These turned out kinda in the middle as far as texture goes. It wasn't really like cake and it wasn't really fudge like. If yours turned out like cake, you over mixed the eggs way too much. I suggest mixing this by hand if you want it to turn out correctly. An electric mixer will make this like cake because it will add way too much air to the eggs."
"1","5","These were the BEST brownies I have had in my life. They were a little darker that I expected, so the next time I made them, I did not put in as much cocoa; but other than that small tweak, they were perfect."
"1","5","Loved the recipe - moist, chewy and chocolaty - just the way brownies should be. I doubled the recipe, made no changes in the ingredients and it worked well."
"1","5","I tried the recipe as is no changes, with the exception that I doubled the recipe on a 9x13 pan they were beautiful. For me, this recipe is a keeper definitely will be making it again."
"1","4","This recipe was great! However, I would not recommend baking them in a 'perfect brownie pan.' I just made them and they taste delicious, but fell apart in my pan."
"1","4","The brownies are soft and delicious. When I followed the recipe for the frosting it came out way to thick, so I added a little milk and it turned out fine. Fun trick - if you measure the honey in the same tablespoon you used to already measure the cocoa the honey will pop right out of the tablespoon with no trouble at all!"
"1","5","Used coconut oil and skipped the topping, turned out perfect! Tried making a 2nd batch with stevia...they we're hard and bitter"
"1","2","Kids liked them fine but I found them bland and disappointing."
"1","5","This recipe is probably the GREATEST brownie recipe I have ever found. It is also very forgiving if you (like me) sometimes don't have the patience for being precise. I however do not use the frosting recipe. I made my own twist on it by poking holes in the brownies while they are still warm and pouring caramel sauce all over the top and then covering them with chopped pecans. I have made these brownies probably 5 times in the last month for different things ....work, home, friends, get togethers. They are certainly worth trying for sure!"
"1","5","Amazing recipe. Best one I have found so far!"
"1","5","These were so easy and quick and my family loved them!"
"1","5","GREAT brownie! i really loved it. it wasn't too sweet nor bland :D although i thought a cup full of sugar would be a lot, it initially wasn't. great recipe! the whole family enjoyed it."
"1","5","O.M.G.... these are the best brownies I've ever made! I very rarely ice brownies, but the batter was so tasty (I know, don't taste because of the raw eggs...oh well) I figured to whip up the icing while it baked. Another win! This is a keeper !"
"1","3","they were ok. Tasted a lot like box brownies."
"1","5","I used dark chocolate instead of cocoa powder, melted it with the butter.  Theses are the best brownies I ever made."
"1","4","Great basic brownie recipe. I'm not a frosted brownie gal, so I made just the brownie. My tweaks: I added a handful of chocolate chips to the recipe which made them nice and fudgy. I also baked them at 325, 25 minutes. Perfection!"
"1","5","Awesome brownies! I make a triple batch and it fills two mini muffin trays!!! The recipe also works great with gluten free flour."
"1","4","I doubled the recipe and cooked for 40 minutes. I didn't want to overcook them, instead I undercooked them. I ran out of vanilla by the time I made the icing, so I used coconut extract instead. That made a coconut chocolate topping. It was good."
"1","5","Absolutely amazing!. fast, easy and delicious!!"
"1","1","It has a cake-like texture."
"1","5","These are by far the best brownies I have ever made. I would not change one thing about this recipe!"
"1","5","Very good! Make sure you MELT the butter for the frosting... We didn't and had to add some milk, still turned out really yummy though."
"1","5","Excellent!!! We double the recipe for a 9X13 pan and it was perfect! Added some mini-chocolate chips that melted in perfectly!"
"1","5","Best recipe I've ever tried. Don't need icing. Warm them, serve with I ice cream and chocolate syrup! Yum"
"1","3","greasy"
"1","5","Loved these brownies!"
"1","5","I ended up using coconut oil instead of butter, ( when it got cold it was alot like a very yummy frosting ) Might be working with that one as well."
"1","5","Loved it! Changed the frosting to be more chocolatey by melting 2 tbsp unsweetened baker's chocolate into the butter, and also added (about 2 tbsp) enough milk to make the frosting spreadable. Delish!"
"1","5","Hands down, best and easiest brownie recipe! I used a wooden spoon to mix everything together and did not frost them. They got a really nice crispy edge and the inside was nice and chewy. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","Wonderful yummy brownies! I took some suggestions others posted.  1. Beat the eggs slightly before adding to the butter 2. I used 3/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup brown 3. I used 1/8 tsp baking powder Instead of 1/4 tsp 4. I hand whisked the butter, eggs,sugar, vanilla. Then with a wooden spoon mixed in the flour, salt and baking powder. Did not over mix.  Baked it for exactly 26 minutes. PERFECT! They were gone in ten minutes!"
"1","4","Pretty tasty! The little one wouldn't let me put the frosting on it :-(  Tastes a bit like the brownies at Starbucks."
"1","5","I fixed this recipe today, and then threw the recipe in the trash, as I had a time with it. I didn't think it would be very good. Then, to my amazement, the brownies were delicious! I doubled the recipe as one batch is barely enough for one square pan. I do not know how you get 16 brownies from a single recipe. Then, the icing recipe is not correct. I read a comment just now that said to halve the confectioners sugar, so that might have helped. I just kept adding butter and honey, then put it on the warm brownies. It then looked buttery and sort of runny, so put it in the fridge. Turned out delicious, surprisingly. I'm shocked."
"1","5","Yummy yummy in your tummy. Super easy and delicious!!!"
"1","5","Excellent!!!"
"1","5","Wow! Just wow!"
"1","5","I was jonesing in the worst way for something chocolate-laden. I'm tossing out every other brownie recipe I've collected. These are so amazingly fabulous. I had some chocolate chips leftover from who knows what, so I dumped them in, as well as a more or less equal amount of chopped walnuts. I thinned out the frosting, spread it on the hot brownies and topped with more chopped walnuts. I figured, what the heck, why not."
"1","5","Really delicious and super easy and quick to make.  Have made it three times now. The second time I was out of butter so used vegetable oil instead. The brownies with the oil tasted just like box brownies! If that is what you are going for. The brownies with butter do not. I like all brownies, so I will continue to make both depending on what I'm in the mood for! (ps didn't try the frosting)"
"1","5","Excellent and simple recipe. I was short on white sugar, so substituted the 3/4 white sugar for light brown muscado (taste and texture of light brown sugar). I sifted the little bit of white I had with the brown. I also doubled the recipe and also had to nearly double the cooking time, but was sure not to over bake. While the brown sugar made the brownies slightly darker, and sweeter (next time I'll reduce the brown sugar 1/8c when substituting white for brown), this turned out to be one of the BEST brownies I've made. Much better, less sweet and less expensive than the WS brand brownies I've been buying. This is now my brownie recipe."
"1","2","Lacked texture and chocolate flavor."
"1","5","My first time making brownies. I made this brownie tonight and my boys loved Them. These are moist and delicious. I only hope some will be there in the morning. Thank you or sharing."
"1","5","Called the best brownies for a reason! Slightly crisp on the outside, super moist on the inside. Exactly how a brownie should be."
"1","5","These really are the best brownies! The frosting is equally amazing. I follow the recipe exactly, and it couldn't be simpler. It looks like a lot of ingredients, but it all comes together in a couple of minutes. I make it in one pot on the stove, then transfer to a glass baking dish. Recipe doubles well, trust me... I've done it many times :) Thank you!"
"1","4","Easy to make. Delicious. Added a touch of milk to the frosting for consistency."
"1","4","I do NOT like cakey brownies, and THESE are fudgy, chewy heaven. Now for those of you who are like me and want chewy, slightly fudgy perfect brownies make these slight changes. Be sure to mix ALL of the dry ingredients together in one bowl. In a separate small bowl the eggs and vanilla just keep the fork in the egg and mix side to side until they are slightly mixed together do not overmix the eggs. I heated my butter on the stove and once that was done I put the butter in the dry ingredients first, gave a qick turn or 2 then added the egg. I only had to turn like 20 times until nothing was dry. And I pushed it toghter a little because my mix is very thick. 1 1/2 cups of regular sugar and a little more then a half a cup of packed dark brown sugar .. this makes the brownies chewier without making them too sweet. 3 eggs not 4. This keeps them fudgy without turning to cake! And remove about 6 tablespoons of the flour. The rest doubled."
"1","5","Great brownies! Didn't even need to make the frosting they were great by themselves!"
"1","5","These are amazing! I always double the recipe because they disappear so quick."
"1","5","Rating for the brownie only: This is a fantastic brownie because the consistency is perfect (chewy, moist, and not too thin or too thick) and it is SO quick and easy to put together. Add two T. cocoa for extra chocolately goodness. Be sure to watch them to avoid overbaking. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
"1","4","As previous people said, it's probably best to use only 3 eggs when doubling the batch. I used 4 and they were more cake like. You don't have to make the icing, but why miss out! I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","Chewy and chocolaty. Pretty much perfect brownies!"
"1","3","DOUBLE the recipe even for a square brownie pan. They turned out much flatter than I was hoping for. Flavor and texture were pretty good. Didn't make the frosting, if I had I may have added another star but I was making cinnamon rolls and had extra cream cheese frosting and used that instead =)I'd say this recipe is worth trying again, but I have another recipe that calls for melted chocolate chips that I prefer."
"1","5","My friend made these brownies and shared with me. They are THE BEST BROWNIES I EVER ATE!!!!"
"1","5","Best brownies you will ever make! I have made these 3 times in the past 4 days, my boyfriend and family devour them! They really do always turn out! LOVE them! You absolutely have to try these!"
"1","5","This recipe turned out great! Although instead of putting butter I put vegetable oil and it turned it yummy! You can make these with or without frosting either way they are great"
"1","5","Delicious brownies! I baked about 29 minutes and they were soft and fudgy, just the way we like them. I don't know how other reviewers got a cake-like brownie from this recipe; it worked out perfectly for me!"
"1","5","They were perfect! I sprinkles red sugar on the frosting and made whipped cream with razzyb's and strawberries. AND I used a round pan ;)"
"1","5","So easy and so delicious! Made the recipe exactly as written and they turned out perfect. Will be making again and again."
"1","5","Wow, made this for my Hubby for Valentine's Day! I would give this a ten out of ten!  All gone! Yummmmmmm!"
"1","5","Best brownies ever !!! Delicious my kids love them. Follow recipe no changes."
"1","5","Excellent - split butter into butter/applesauce 50/50; add milk to icing to thin/combine"
"1","5","Sooooo good!!!! I didn't change a thing about the recipe and it comes out sooooo good after they cool down!!!!!!! They totally melt in your mouth....."
"1","5","I followed the suggestion from another cook and melted the butter in the oven then mixed in all the ingredients with a spoon in the pan - super easy, super good. I have never made the frosting, for me they are plenty good. From the box taste or better!"
"1","5","I love this recipe!!!!!!!! So easy! Although I thought the frosting was a little to sweet, and I tried it without and it was AMAZING! I totally recommend this for beginners:)"
"1","5","Why would anyone use a boxed brownie mix when the BEST brownies are this easy to make? These are ingredients that I usually have on hand as well! I recommend using the 'Brownie Frosting' recipe on this website instead of the one listed here. What an incredible combo! I've made these before and I will be making them again!"
"1","3","Recipe is cloyingly sweet as written. Not grown-up appropriate. Cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup, toss an extra tbsp or two of cocoa powder in, and shave a minute off the cooking time (24 mins) & you have a decent enough brownie. Assuming you are not frosting the brownies, these only have 2tsp of sugar per brownie too, knocking the calorie count way down from the one posted."
"1","2","too cakey."
"1","5","These were amazing! First time I ever made non box brownies and I will never use a box again. When they were done, I pressed a peanut butter cup in each piece while they were still warm instead of frosting them. So good!"
"1","5","Love these brownies! Added walnuts but left off the frosting. They are so fudgy just like I like'em. These will be my go to brownie recipe. So goooooood!"
"1","5","They were just AMAZING woaw"
"1","3","The texture was perfect, just a little too sweet for my taste."
"1","5","I've tried this recipe once before and was surprised how quick, easy and tasty it was. This time I added chopped up reeses peanut butter cups and a snicker bar. It was amazing! Next time I'll try adding some dark chocolate and walnuts too!"
"1","5","OMG is all I can say! When I made this, it melts in my mouth! It is so mouth watering! LOVE IT!"
"1","2","This recipe doesn't pour, it was stiff and I had to spoon it out. I wasn't comfortable with baking it as is, done that before it it comes out hard;as I've seen a reviewer/s state. I added some milk reluctantly 1/4c. and a a few TBS. of oil..It's tasty because it's basic. I like using the 'Special Dark Cocoa', so it was cake like not chewy as I changed the recipe to avoid a brick!"
"1","5","This is such a good brownie recipe"
"1","5","these are the only brownies I make. I leave out the frosting and often add nuts if they are on hand. Thanks for this simply amazing recipe, it never disappoints!"
"1","5","These brownies came out moist and delicious. To the point my husband told me I was being stingy with the piece I gave him."
"1","5","Easiest and best brownies I have tasted!"
"1","1","I'm on the quest to find the perfect brownie recipe and with all the wonderful reviews for this one I really thought that this would be it. However I'm extremely disappointed to find out that this brownie recipe is nothing like I thought it would be. I followed the instructions exactly, the only thing I did differently was reduce the amount of sugar and added chocolate chips, however this shouldn't change the overall texture of the brownie. The end result was more cakey and dry than I anticipated. Although the flavors are good, the texture is not at all what I would describe as a brownie."
"1","5","We wanted to make brownies and this happened to be the recipes I already had everything for. They were delicious! The only thing we didn't include was the honey. I will definitely be making this again. Very easy and simple ingredients! Thank you!!"
"1","5","Amazing brownies! Yummy. I did not put the frosting on and still super yummy! Thanks for the advice on 'not over mixing' this made them come out not like a cake."
"1","5","I just made these today. I have made them for years! This recipe actually comes from the 1994 Hershey's 100th Anniversary dessert cookbook which I have had since 1994. It is also called Best Brownies and my family love them. I doubled the recipe to put into a 9 x 13 pan and bake exactly 20 minutes. I decided to change the topping and used Milk Chocolate Heath Toffee bits and a chocolate drizzle made with melted chocolate chips and a tsp of shortening."
"1","4","Excellent without the frosting. I used Ghirardeli chocolate. I did not beat."
"1","5","Definitely the best brownies I've ever had. Made it to the letter and sprinkled powdered sugar on top, it was delectable. Next time I will make a brownie ala mode and add french vanilla ice cream with sliced strawberries on top. Yummy, thanks so much for sharing."
"1","4","the brownie was great... i didn't have a small baking pan so i had to rush and make another batch to add to the pan last minute. this left me with no butter for the icing - which i tried to use margarine instead for the frosting and is possibly the only downfall to my brownies. Very rich in flavour."
"1","5","great brownies, I used the alteration from the most helpful review and didn't make the frosting, the brownies do not need the frosting they are THAT good"
"1","4","My daughters and I made these today for their third birthday. They were easy to make and the kids had fun. We made this recipe as written. The brownie itself was pretty good, had a nice texture and flavor. The frosting had good flavor, but was dry and crumbly after settling down on the brownie. We found these to be very chocolaty and rich, a little piece was perfect! I think I would prefer these without the frosting or maybe with a different frosting recipe."
"1","5","I do not understand the negative reviews. I have made this several times now and it has come out fantastic! My mother made them and they came out as hockey pucks. You cannot follow the time suggested. Every oven is different. I have to bake my double batch for 40 minutes. It may not seem done when u take them out. I would say check them every 5 minutes once you reach 25 minutes. I love this recipe!"
"1","5","Loved!"
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. Followed the recipe, did not over bake, only doubled it and still not enough for a 9x13 pan. They looked great, but thats it. Sorry, really wanted this recipe to be a good one!"
"1","5","Never making store bought again"
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. The icing was no where near icing at all and the brownies were much too salty."
"1","5","Took less than 10 min too mix. Delicious"
"1","5","Oh my goodness, this was the best recipe never use another."
"1","5","This recipe works great doubled. My family will eat an 8x8 too fast. I also substituted gluten free rice flour mix for flour just fine in this recipe. Be sure to add 1/4 tsp of xantham gum for each 1/2c flour. Enjoy!"
"1","5","Great !! don't overlook !"
"1","5","My family loves these. I have made others but my husband said throw out the others and make only these."
"1","5","Yum! Love this recipe. The brownies come out perfect...not too moist, not too dry! My family had a little Christmas decorating fun with this recipe!"
"1","5","Made exactly as recipe said...perfect brownie moist and delicious. The icing was perfect as well I licked the bowl!!. First time making from scratch always used the box and this recipe is remarkably better than any box mix."
"1","5","Doubled it to make 9x13 pan, took 35 minutes."
"1","4","While the end product was moist and tasty, it is a pet peeve of mine when working with recipes that are poorly written.   RECIPE CORRECTIONS: First, novice bakers need to know whether to use salted or unsalted butter. I used salted butter and then later found the standard is unsalted for baking. Fortunately, it still tasted great and would probably be bland using unsalted. Second, it says 25 to 30 minutes. This is my first time baking brownies so I was unsure if the toothpick test was appropriate for them. My oven is calibrated right at 350. At 25 minutes the toothpick came out goopy, at 27 it came out clean. Third, cocoa powder and powdered sugar should always be sifted to get the lumps out.   I am a former chef, not a baker and still have a lot to learn. I feel that if you are going to post a recipe you write it for the newest baker.  SUGGESTIONS FOR EASIER PRODUCTION:  Now about the recipe. I would suggest mixing the sugar and all the wet except the butter and mix the dry in a separate bowl. Cut the butter in chunks and melt on a very low temp, then just before they are all melted pull it off the heat and stir. This melts the remaining chunks and lowers the temp so it cannot cook the eggs. Add it to the wet, mix well, then gently mix the dry in just until moistened. The ingredients get thoroughly mixed without over-mixing the final batter.   I hope this helps."
"1","5","Alrighty... The brownies are currently in the oven, but since I don't have children (which is a good thing- I am 16!) I licked the spoon. Guilty as charged. The batter itself is simply amazing! Can't wait for the brownies to be done. One of my friends has a birthday, and that is a great reason for doing some baking. ?? THANK YOU!!!"
"1","5","This is my go-to brownie recipe. Easy, quick, and no need to make the icing. Sometimes I add chocolate chips and/or marshmallows. So yummy! Always guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser."
"1","5","I LOVED this recipe! DELICIOUS.. to me. My brother told me that they were WAY too chocolatey and now he forever hates cocoa powder. I actually didn't use ENOUGH cocoa powder.. but to me, these brownies were heaven. 10 stars to me, 1 star to my brother. But everyone else loved it, so I don't think I care what he says because.. well, sometimes, brothers like to do that sorta thing."
"1","5","Wonderful and simple recipe. I did use whole spelt organic flour instead of the white wheat and it was simply delicious. Light and fluffy. I did not use baking powder because it contains aluminum and is bad for your heath. I substitued it with baking soda. No problem or change in taste. I am going to make this agian tonight for my wonderful husband. MashaAllah InshaAllah......"
"1","5","Delicious, reliable recipe for fudgy brownies. Don't overstir - just barely mix the dry ingredients into the wet, and you are guaranteed success. ;)"
"1","5","These are amazing brownies. My whole family loves them! I just made another batch and realized I have been using half the butter than is listed. I have also been using salted butter. I just don't add the additional salt the recipe calls for. Either way these come out great every time. I did start adding chocolate and white chocolate chips. I'm sure they will be even better. I have never made the frosting part, I just dust with powdered sugar. Very simple! Definitely recommend."
"1","5","So quick n so easy. Excellent recipe for beginners such as myself! Loved it."
"1","5","This recipe is perfect!  However, a word of warning about the frosting: It takes quite a lot of work to turn these ingredients into frosting. I could have sworn I did something wrong after a few minutes of mixing and compressing ('It's just... powder...'), but I kept on with it and eventually, finally, it turned into something that resembled frosting. It was a powdery mess for the longest time, but finally changed into delicious frosting. So don't be discouraged! The brownies are much easier than the frosting, so expect to work for that chocolatey coating. I did, however, add about a teaspoon and a half of half-and-half to the frosting AFTER it was fully mixed and it gave it just the creamy consistency I wanted. That being said, I think the recipe deserves 5 stars even without this change. The heat from the brownies when they come out of the oven melted the frosting perfectly, making it easy to spread."
"1","5","very nice recipe!!!"
"1","2","My brownies came out tasting too buttery, not chocolatey enough, and pretty cake like.  I would up the cocoa, reduce butter to half and sub unsweetened applesauce or plain yogurt and maybe add milk or reduce the egg to one.Next time I will try revisions and possibly add some Nutella."
"1","3","they're decent, nothing too special :/"
"1","5","Wonderful brownie! Not too cakey and not too fudgey. I doubled the recipe and used a 9X13 pan. Will use this recipe all the time!"
"1","5","These were too delicious! Don't make them if you have little to no willpower, as they are hard to stay away from. I did feel they could just a little less sugar, so the next time I make them I will cut out 1/4 cup of sugar. I didn't make the frosting but instead added 1 cup of dark chocolate chips on top before baking. Amazing, and this is now my go-to brownie recipe!"
"1","5","This was the best brownie I ever tasted in my life. My nine year old son Jon for the family. It sweet but not to sweet. We recammined this highly. We put 3 fourths of a teaspoon insted a half."
"1","5","Delicious and simple to make. I'm gluten free so I used GF flour and it still came out moist and flavorful. We topped with ice cream. I will never go back to boxed brownie mix."
"1","5","Added some walnuts. By far the best brownie I've ever eaten"
"1","5","My husband just made these for our 4 year old who asked for brownies nonstop until he made them. We were out of quick brownie mix, so we tried this recipe...  Oh my goodness! These are the best brownies I've ever tasted! We all ate way too much and savored every single bite! Delicious. Absolutely delicious. No more store bought mix for us! Thanks"
"1","5","These are Amazing! Followed directions exactly."
"1","5","The best recipe I've tried yet!"
"1","5","I thought these brownies were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. For the frosting I halved the confectioners sugar and added 2 tbsp. of water to spread easier."
"1","5","This recipe couldn't be easier! I left off the frosting and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Simply wonderful. Many thanks to you, Angie!"
"1","5","Dude...seriously...easy to make and perfection to taste! People always think I went to great lengths in making these and I always let 'em think it!"
"1","5","They are the best! I like others used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Do not over mix. I put a little extra cocoa too. I baked for just over 20 mins and they came out perfect. I melted the butter for the frosting and it came together perfect. Spread on to brownies when they were still warm. Wait til cool to cut."
"1","5","I'm serious, these are the best brownies I've ever had. That frosting makes it 11x better!!!"
"1","5","Best brownie recipe I've tried. They were moist and delicious! The frosting was also great!"
"1","5","Best brownie recipe I've made."
"1","5","So fudgy. Not cake like at all. I used my standing mixer to beat eggs, added melted the butter(microwaved), sugar, vanilla and sifted cocoa. I mixed well after every ingredient then a little more in the end. I mixed the dry ingredients together then gently hand mixed them together. I used parchment paper in my 8x8 and sprayed it with cooking spray. Convection baked at 325 for 20 min. The bars cooled, then I lifted them out of the pan with the parchment paper and cut them with a chef knife on the cutting board. Thanks for the amazing recipe. I didn't change a thing other than the convection heat, parchment paper, and I love my mixer."
"1","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever tried, the brownies melt in your mouth! I added walnuts in one batch since I love brownies with nuts and they were delicious. I plan on making these for Christmas presents! Recipe says it makes 16 brownies but I don't get that many unless you make them real small."
"1","5","I made these in mini cupcake pans and regular cupcake pans ( I failed at cutting straight in elementary! Lol) and they came out awesome! I have double batches of the dry ingredients in mason jars so I can pull and mix the wet when ready to make them. They are a huge hit at work!"
"1","5","This is one of the best 'scratch' brownie recipes I've tried -and I've tried a lot. After making these, I'm going to 'scratch' the boxed ones and make these. They are fudgey and dense and really don't need frosting. I baked them for 25 minutes which was just right. I'm always changing recipes but I wouldn't change a thing about these. Using cocoa makes them even easier to make because there's no need to melt chocolate."
"1","5","We loved it! Everybody loved these brownies!"
"1","5","My go-to brownie recipe! I was asked by someone if they were boxed because they had never had a from scratch brownie taste so good! My little addition to make it just THAT much better... Mix in a splash of rum. Sooo yummy!"
"1","5","I had a craving for chocolate and this certainly fit the bill!"
"1","5","This recipe is great, the brownies cooked perfectly, I made a double batch and a single, the cook time was on target and they were easy to slice and yummy, I didn't do the icing but they were perfect as is, confectioners sugar on top would be good too. I baked for a last minute event and they worked great!"
"1","5","I make these brownies all the time. From experience I just bake them on 150 degrees C for 42 minutes. They are perfectly chewy, chocolate-y heaven. Haven't tried to double the recipe but really should because they do not last long. I do not frost my brownies."
"1","3","These brownies were average in flavour, to much sugar and too little chocolate. The textue was not brownie-like in any way! They were dry and cake-y instead of moist and chewy. They are alright as a quick craving fix, but do not suffice if you want that thick, chewy, and fudgy brownie."
"1","5","Excellent brownies!! Only adjustment I made was in the icing, only used 1/4c confectioners sugar, gave the icing a beautiful bittersweet flavour. Will definitely be making again!"
"1","3","Was amazing! FOR THOSE WHO ARE CALORIE COUNTERS I BROKE DOWN THE ENTIRE RECIPE FOR CALORIC VALUE---- TOTAL CALORIES FOR THIS DISH ARE 2,947Cal. I cut my dish into 8 pieces which brought the caloric intake of 1 equal sized brownie equals roughly 368Cal. give or take 1 Cal (Calorie)."
"1","5","No first time make this brownie. They come out very good. My kids love them"
"1","5","worth a try for a first time baker... nice recipe."
"1","4","This recipe is pretty good. It's not overly chocolatey. The brownies are kind of firm but not crispy, as long as you don't over cook"
"1","4","Ok, these are pretty good, it turns out, just not what I was hunting for. I agree with another reviewer that they are somewhere in between cake like and fudgy. They also have to have cooled down in order to be any good. They are no good hot. Once they cool down and set up, the frosting melds in with the brownie and it's almost like a brownie bar. You have to remove from the oven while the middle is slightly underdone. Once it loses the glossiness and the sides are all cooked, take it out. The middle will not come out clean from a toothpick. However, about 3 minutes later, sitting on the counter top, then it will come out all clean. For my oven I have to take them out at 17 min! The honey is interesting. In the frosting plain I could taste it kind of strongly. But the next day it was not noticeable. It's nice they are so easy but I honestly prefer dense and chewy. Good luck. Give them a try. Might be what you were looking for in your life. :)"
"1","5","Actually I really like this recipe but for a truely wonderful devils food cake & not for brownies. This recipe comes out very moist, super chocolatey & very cake like especially if you use a good quality,dark cocoa powder & don't over bake it. It comes together very easily & doesn't require boiled water or any other crazy steps or ingredients like many other chocolate cake recipes. I quadruple this recipe to make a three(9inch) layer cake. Turns out great every time."
"1","5","These were a hit. So easy to make and everyone loved them."
"1","5","Awesome recipe and really quick. My family loved it. I used dark chocolate compound instead of dark cocoa powder with butter and honey."
"1","4","I tried this recipe today and it turned out fine. I usually always use applesauce when making my brownies but didn't with this. I will use applesauce next time. It really helps to make them so much more moist. otherwise they tasted wonderful."
"1","4","This is the best homemade brownies I've ever made. And I will no longer make brownies from a box!"
"1","5","Brownies were great but frosting needed a tbsp milk and karo syrup to thin if out and make glossy"
"1","5","Perfection! I made the top two brownie recipes from this site last night because we were having some company over and we had everybody vote on which was their favorite. This recipe won hands down! It's just what a brownie should be! It was dense and fudgy but not overly sweet. It had a chewy texture and it was not cake-like at all. This is my new go to recipe and it was very easy to throw together. I made it as directed but skipped the frosting. They were awesome without it."
"1","3","I am wondering if those who had cake-like results used self-rising flour. I like cake type brownies and that is not what I got. Mine were fudgy, and 'gooey' was the word my husband used. I won't be making these again.. They taste ok, not exceptional, but I did like the icing."
"1","5","Delicious. I doubled the batter and still had too much frosting, but the frosting is delicious, too, so it's perfect for those who like to lick the spoons!"
"1","4","This is a very good recipe; cake like on outside and fudge inside. I lowered calorie count a bit by exchanging 1/4 cup butter with equal amount of applesauce. They're still very good!"
"1","5","Perfect!! No more mix anymore. I followed the recipe exactly as is."
"1","5","Took another reviewer's advice and mixed by hand with a spatula; baked for 30 mins. Perfect brownies."
"1","5","I've been doubling this recipe and making them as cupcakes...O. M. G. To die for!! Crispy, chewy crackles tops and decadently fudgy middles. No frosting needed!!!"
"1","5","Delicious! Best brownies I ever made, and so easy. Happy to have finally found the perfect 'best brownie' recipe. No need to make any changes to this one. I did add chopped pecans on top of the icing. We southerners do love our pecans!"
"1","5","These are AMAZING and so EASY. I don't do frosting, but the brownies themselves are fantastic. I'll never make boxed again. Didn't change anything at all."
"1","5","excellent and easy to make! i find it a bit too sweet so i reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and 1/4 for frosting"
"1","5","This recipe is the best brownie recipe I have ever used. Never could I ever use a box mix again. As far the person who said they were the best 'cake squares' ever...I dont know what you did wrong cooking them but these are true brownies and they taste like brownies. DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","Worked perfectly. I mixed sugar and butter, beat the eggs gently separate and then added them. Mixed it a few times to combine ingredients, baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  They came out wonderful. I didn't bother with frosting."
"1","5","Wow, these brownies are far better than any other brownies I have made in the past. I originally was going to make your finest chocolate chip cookies my aunt and I used to make but I didn't have brown sugar. So I added the chopped walnuts and semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter. It turned out amazingly! These chocolate wonders make you crave chocolate even more!"
"1","5","Yummy. Perfect brownies, I used the best chocolate frosting instead and piled it on...made it very rich."
"1","2","I saw this was the most popular brownie recipe, so I tried it thinking it would be good. It wasnt..I even made it twice thinking I must have done something wrong the first time. It tastes more like a chocolate cake then a brownie. Sadly the box mix brownies taste way better."
"1","5","Love these! So salty and sweet! Perfect. Although my icing didnt even mix and I was left with confectioners sugar and some cocao powder. But just fine w/out the icing :)"
"1","2","i followed the recipe exactly and this turned out to be more like cake NOT brownies. disappointed."
"1","5","I added some walnuts, chocolate chunks, and carmel to the brownies. Great recipe!"
"1","4","I beat sugar, vanilla and eggs with a mixer. Add melted butter, I just melt mine in micro. Combine dry ingredients, add to batter and mix well. Bake, test with a toothpick."
"1","5","I have to admit I was thrown off when I first pulled the brownies out of the oven because it was raised in the center and fluffy like a cake, but I frosted it and let it cool before I tried them and man, I had nothing to be worried about! These brownies are delicious and the frosting really elevated the brownies to a new level! I did add chocolate chips to the batter when I made it, which all sunk to the bottom and created a sort of chocolate chip crust, if you will, but I can tell these brownies would be just as fudgey and delicious without them! I'm so pleased with this recipe that I've added it to my recipe book and won't be looking for a new one anymore! :)"
"1","5","Awesome. I made the brownies to the letter of the recipe. Middle rack, 350 for 25 mins. They were perfect.   I added about a tbsp of heavy cream to the frosting just for a tiny bit of lift. 5 stars all day."
"1","5","These brownies are amazing and really easy to make. I'm sixteen, and when I have movie night with my friends we always bake these. They're simple, delicious and quick! My only tip (that isn't in the recipe) is to add chocolate chips. Any kind (peanut butter, white chocolate, milk chocolate, etc) and REMEMBER TO HAVE SOME SORT OF NON-STICK (pam, etc)! I always forget and its a pain to have to unstick brownies :)"
"1","5","Amazing brownies, wonderful chocolatey taste. I will definetly be making them again"
"1","5","First time making brownies from scratch! Way better then any box and just as easy!"
"1","1","These brownies are extremely dry and I even added chocolate morsels. They say not to over cook. Just eat the batter and don't even bother cooking. I had to give it one star or I could not post."
"1","1","I followed the recipe to the T and did not over bake them, yet my brownies came out with the consistency of a brick!ve this recipe 0 stars I WOULD."
"1","5","I love this recipe but I ran out of butter to grease the pan so I used my coconut oil spray and it gave the brownies an even better taste"
"1","4","These are good, thin, and crunchy along the edges. I skipped the frosting and just sprinkled powdered sugar over them. Yum!"
"1","5","These brownies are fantastic!!"
"1","4","so easy. always have the ingredients at home."
"1","5","Great little brownie! I never have tried the frosting. The brownie stands on its own. Sometimes I add nuts or top with powdered sugar just to change it up a little."
"1","5","This recipe was absolutely amazing! While it was simple to cook it does require close attention. One of the key ingredients to making brownies in general is being consistent and always knowing what comes next. This recipe turned out great; the brownies were soft and tasty. As for the frosting, if it is too thick or 'cakey' consider adding milk or melted butter and that should do the trick. Enjoy!!"
"1","5","Very simple and tasty. I got distracted and forgot to add the vanilla and baking powder but they still came out yummy. A keeper for sure!"
"1","4","Made this into minibites (mini muffin tins) baked for 15 min. They were pretty good!"
"1","4","Pretty good recipe. I left off the frosting and added 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips to the batter. 30 minutes in the oven was perfect."
"1","5","These brownies are fantastic! I'm not really a brownie person but these are rich and fudgy and delicious. Every time I make these, I get rave reviews. This is my go-to brownie recipe now!"
"1","4","This is my go to brownie recipe. Don't overbake or over stir them. I've never bothered making the frosting, they are yummy without! Never last more than a day in our house."
"1","5","I love making these brownies. They taste so much better than from a box. I used to love my grandmas brownies when I was younger and I finally asked her for her recipe to find out that she just made them from a box! I was shocked. Then I found this recipe and they taste like hers but better! I did not make the frosting, I just sifted powdered sugar over the top because that's the way I grew up on brownies!"
"1","5","Kids at a 4th of July reunion devoured these. Very good brownies. Added chocolate chips and were irresistible."
"1","5","Mmmmmmmmmmm These brownies are sooooooo good!!!!!! My whole family loved them!"
"1","3","I am not of a fan of this recipe. I like my brownies to be more thick. They weren't bad either. Just ok"
"1","5","This is a great recipe for brownies! My whole family LOVED them. These were a bit crispy on the outer sides, and chewy in the middle. JUST the way we like them. The frosting was very sweet, but add a glass of milk, and it is perfect. I will never buy a brownie mix again."
"1","5","I make these ALL the time. Everyone loves them!! Instead of doing the 1 cup of the confectioner's sugar, I just use 1/2. Best brownies I have ever had!!"
"1","4","Very good brownies I use dark chocolate powder and a little less than what is called for."
"1","5","Finally, a decent brownie recipe. These are near perfect - fudgey but not too fudgey. One tip is to beat the melted butter with sugar before you add the eggs so you get that crispy top that I love. I didn't bother with the frosting but added some walnuts which added lovely, nutty texture. However, if you prefer a richer, deeply chocolate flavoured brownie then I suggest you add some kind of frosting or perhaps some chocolate chips because they aren't as chocolate-y as some of the brownies I am used to."
"1","4","These brownies are more like a chocolate cake, but nevertheless, delicious. I doubled the batter, kept the icing to essentially half and it was perfect for me (someone who doesn't like too much sweet icing). I also added shredded coconut as a delicious and beautiful garnish! mmmm...  Would have given it five stars if it was called 'Best chocolate cake'."
"1","5","The frosting was a little too sweet, but the brownies themselves were delicious! 5 stars from me and me Czech friend!"
"1","5","Really, really good. I changed nothing other than to double the recipe to make a 9x13 pan. Baked for 25 minutes...perfect. Took them to a cookout and everyone loved them. I've tried to make homemade brownies many times and never find one that tastes good -- until now. This will be the recipe. It's fabulous! Great texture, great flavor...loved them!! (I skipped the frosting...just prefer unfrosted brownies)"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I tried these out for our Fourth of July dessert and served them warm with ice cream on top. I am planning on using this recipe in a few days to make brownies for a trifle recipe in place of store bought. Keep in mind these are on the thin side - perfectly fudgy without being gooey."
"1","5","These are the BEST brownies! Hence the name. Also, I'm an eleven year old, and if I make these brownies and they turned out magnificent (which they did, just ask my family and friends) then you people that are forty-two (more or less) can make even MORE magnificent brownies! XD"
"1","5","I am so amazed that I made brownies that tasted this good! I doubled the recipe, with the exception that I only used 3 eggs, and I omitted salt altogether. I baked for 30 minutes, and they came out perfect. My husband said the brownies tasted like a box brownies, and I took this as a compliment since that is normally how I make brownies. I didn't make the frosting, because the brownies were perfect without it."
"1","5","I made these last night and they are the best brownies ever! I usually buy the boxed kind because I am not much of a baker, but these where super easy and fast. My husband absolutely loves them and so do my little kiddo's. I would only suggest that you make a double batch because these are gone so fast lol."
"1","5","This recipe is A-MA-ZING! Love love love these brownies.  And they really do always turn out! Best brownies EVER!"
"1","5","it is so sweet creamy soft and fantastic"
"1","5","I just made these. Wow!! I made a double batch, and made it into a pizza. Really the best brownies I ever made."
"1","5","I made this for a work party that I found out about the night before. The recipe is super easy and delicious. I made the recipe as is, but did not make the frosting. I baked them in muffin tins. Works great, but you will need to grease them very well or you might have difficulties getting them out."
"1","5","These where PREFECT they were gone in less than an hour I must say I will me making these again I'm in love and so is the rest of family this recipe is the way to go I didn't make the frosting but I put simply powdered sugar on them I think this time I will try the frosting and by the way these ARE cake like so if you like chewy brownies this is NOT the recipe for you   Update: the frosting isn't very good"
"1","4","Very quick and easy without sacrificing flavor. Four stars because five indicates the recipe can't get any better. Although these were very good, I've tasted better brownies before."
"1","5","Amazing brownie!! I bake a lot and this is by far the best brownie recipe I have ever come across. My family loves them!"
"1","5","These brownies were so delicious. Loved the idea of basically mixing all in one bowl. Served it for my afternoon bridge party and most of the gals came back for 2nds. Guess that says it all! Lynn"
"1","5","This recipe is really great even though i did not make the frosting !!!!"
"1","5","the best brownie recipe by far!!!!!!!!! just don't over mix or over cook :)! Will use this forever!"
"1","5","perfect alone, didn't need the frosting"
"1","5","I absolutely love these brownies!I followed the recipe for the brownies exactly but used my own chocolate buttercream icing recipe and OMG - the best brownies I've ever had!"
"1","5","They were awesome"
"1","5","Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect balance between a cake and fudge brownie. I didn't add the frosting and they were still terrific. This will be my go to brownie from now on."
"1","5","Delicious. I add some dry cranberry. Came out great."
"1","5","Best Brownies from scratch. Tried them when i didn't have a mix on hand but i was being begged to make brownies. Made these and they were the best we've ever had."
"1","5","I've been using recipes on this sight for 5 years, and I don't know why I haven't bothered reviewing yet.  I've made this brownie recipe for a total of 20 times (I made another batch today). They're amazing and chewy. I never bother making the frosting, because the brownies are sweet enough for me. I have actually found that the longer you leave the brownies out, the chewier and harder they get. So for those complaining about a cakey texture, leave them out for a few hours, or overnight, and I guarantee you it'll be amazing. But it's so hard for my family to wait so long to eat them, so they're usually gone right away!"
"1","1","I am very confused about all the high reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. The texture is more like a cake than a brownie and they barely have a chocolate flavor."
"1","5","I've tried the recipe and it's spectacular !!!:)"
"1","5","These were just perfect! I didn't change a thing. I doubled it and am happy I did! I will never buy brownie mixes again! :)"
"1","2","Mine came out DRY. I even pulled them out early by my watching eye to not overcook them. It wasn't because they were overbaked; the edges were just done. Flavor was decent enough."
"1","4","Yummy. Moist with chewy edges. Would be really great with icing but they were almost gone before I had a chance to ice them."
"1","5","These are amazing! They're so delicious and simple to make! The ingredients are basic and mostly everyone will have everything they need to make them already in their home. The batter was thicker than I expected so it didn't spread to fill the whole pan, but with how great these taste, the look didn't matter one bit! I will make these any time I am craving brownies!"
"1","5","Recipe is Awesome! FUGDY MOIST DELISH BROWNIES!"
"1","4","Easy to make - Despite desperately needing to go grocery shopping, I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen. And the brownies were good!"
"1","5","deliciuos I'm only 12 and i made them on christmas eve and everyone loved them! but it needs to be more dry and more vanilla!"
"1","5","my husband really liked this brownies. but i added white chocolate and almonds"
"1","5","These have such a good rating because they are absolutely fabulous! Soft and fudgy! Yum!"
"1","5","These brownies are delicious and the best! It's an easy recipe and the best ever!  The brownies taste great even without the frosting! Soft, flavorful an just perfect. They are sumptuous!  I make a batch and just cannot get enough... The recipe is so easy n quick! The batter, It can be made before the oven gets preheated... It's just awesome!"
"1","5","Delicious!!"
"1","5","Simply delicious!!"
"1","5","These are AMAZING! This is basically the recipe my grandma always made and I made it the other night but gluten free with an all purpose gluten free mix I make and they were fabulous! For anyone interested, just sub 70 grams of all purpose gluten free flour for the 1/2 cup the recipe calls for."
"1","5","Amazing to the max!! The taste was good, but i would recommend doubling the recipe."
"1","5","Mmmm delish! I didn't change a thing and didnt fuss with the frosting. They were lovely and cakey, not gooey."
"1","5","Made these for a small dinner party of close friends. These brownies were absolutely delicious. I used self rising flour, so didnt need the salt or baking powder. I also added semi sweet chocolate chips (sparingly) and nuts. Did not use icing but sprinkled with powdered sugar. I garnished with fresh strawberries(leaves intact). My only complaint about this recipe is that the batch is very small. It was just enough for about 6-7 people. This is definitely a keeper"
"1","3","This recipe is super easy and quick. My brownies were dry, because I was short butter and used only 1/3 cup. I recommend using the exact amount of butter or adding some cooking oil to compensate for less butter. I will try again and follow exactly."
"1","5","This recipe turned out perfect. With 4 kids it didn't last the day. I used sprouted spelt flour instead of all-purpose and added some sprouted ground flax. They were delicious."
"1","5","So easy, if you can crack an egg and handle basic measuring then you should have no problem with this recipe. You can also add additional ingredients like walnuts, peanut m&m's, shredded coconut or whatever you like."
"1","5","Tried these tonight for my grandson, a great brownie lover since he was little. He always digs in while they are still warm and he thinks these are the best I've ever made. And so, they have been marked as favorites and we don't be trying any brownie recipes. By the way, I adjusted the recipe for a 9X13 pan. I love that you have that option to do that."
"1","5","We have to do dairy free stuff but they still turn out amazing, I get compliment after compliment. We double if for our family size and still wind up eating it all within the day. MMMMMM!"
"1","4","Basic cocoa brownies- eat them right (let 'em cool some) away or they'll be dry! Under-cook a bit for more moist brownies- much more. These are pretty 'fudgy' when under-cooked.   It's a fine base recipe, when you need chocolate in a few snaps. I make these without icing, for use with ice cream and other desserts.  This recipes stands out by making a fine biscotti. (Instead of a square pan, bake in a loaf pan for easily-sliced 'fingers' to lay on a sheet and bake-to-biscotti crisp at low temp. Double-up and use two, for variety flavors.)  *If baking for biscotti, it's preferable to NOT under-cook them very much . . .they may not lift so cleanly from the first bake. For the second bake, lay pieces on their sides- on a sheet- after cutting into fingers."
"1","3","Great taste, but a bit crumbly and dry."
"1","5","This is my go-to brownie recipe. It is much requested by my hubby, but I try to only make it once every 6 months or so because it is just too delicious and I want to eat the whole pan! :) I often don't add the icing at all, only if I am giving away the brownies do I add the icing. Have to make sure you don't over-mix them - come out perfect for me every time!"
"1","5","I love this brownie mix and I have always wanted to make little variations to this recipe. So this last go around I added a cup of flour and three 5 hour energy drinks. Now I have brownies that make me hyper whoooooooo"
"1","4","WORKED IN CUPCAKE CUPS 350 DEGREES FOR 20 MIN Made these in cupcake form w buttercream due to a request! Have to say they were very good even with me messing up butter (used 1/2 c for double recipe), baking powder (1 tsp) and salt (1 tsp) quantities and the recipe still turned out great. WITH HALF THE BUTTER THESE HAD TRADITIONAL BROWNIE CONSISTENCY. Now after making batch w correct measurements see they are more cakelike. You will have to at least triple recipe to get 24 cupcakes( I had to quadruple due to mistakes 1st round )."
"1","5","These were so delicious! I've never been a big brownie fan, but I am now! They were so moist, more like a cake really. I was making them for my kids too, so I added 1 cup of carrot puree (you couldn't taste it) and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. My son is allergic to eggs so I also used an egg replacement (OrGran). For the icing, as suggested I halved the icing sugar & melted the butter. I had no honey, so used maple syrup instead. The icing turned out not very hard, still soft to the touch, but I didn't care cause they were so yum!"
"1","5","Recipe was SUPER easy. I melted the butter in a small sauce pan then added it to a large mixing bowl with all of the other ingredients and used an electric beater and beat just until mixed. Sprayed a glass baking dish with canola oil and spread the batter and baked for about 20 mins. Seriously delicious and I did not use the frosting and honestly it didn't need it. I will never buy a brownie box mix ever again. I am not a baker so to me this was the best brownie ever!!"
"1","5","This recipe is great!"
"1","5","Phenomenal brownies. Screwed up the frosting but so delicious. Why ever make from a box? Cakey and rich with chocolate flavor. Used Hershey cocoa and was terrific. Put powdered sugar to hide my ugly frosting.....to rave reviews. ...yummy!"
"1","5","It's true, they always turn out!"
"1","4","quick and easy! taste great, have had better thou"
"1","5","Pretty dope brownies. I tasted em n i was like God man, these brownies b so lovely and ever comforting. I b making these brownies when i cook em in the oven. I make em just like the directions and ummm they b real good. I very highly reumend these ever so delicious capcakes to all my homies out der. They w"
"1","5","These are so delicious!! I had everything in my cupboards an was shocked at how simple these were, for homemade! My little one did the majority of the work and a fine job she did cause these thinks are super yummy!! We're not typically 'frosted brownie' people but we just followed the recipe and we're happy we did. If you're even considering making these, DO IT! One thing, our frosting came out a little dry so I added half a tsp or so of water just until the frosting wasn't crumbly. It was about the consistency of natural peanut butter after I added the water. It didn't 'spread' very well so I dropped spoonfuls of it all over the top of the brownies and just let it melt, then I spread it with the back of a spoon. Now, what are you waiting for? Go, go!! :)"
"1","5","These were AMAZING!!! I doubled the recipe and to give it that perfect brownie texture, I stirred everything by hand and I also added about a cup of melted chocolate chips and I cooked them for 20 min, they were perfect!! Best brownies I've ever made!! I didn't even make the icing, simply because they don't need it."
"1","5","VERY good! Easy to make, house smelled amazing, and they were excellent. Not cakey (at all), fudgey without being too fudgey. I skipped the icing because I prefer my brownies without. The critical review I read was WAY off. Who wants hard brownies? Not me or any brownie eaters I know. These were also absolutely NOT cakey. I'm thinking the reviewer must have used a hand mixer and overly beat the batter. Their mistake. Use a wisk to blend the ingredients, not a mixer. Also, I cooked my butter for a while, not quite browning it, but I think it added to the richness of flavor."
"1","5","I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan. I did what someone else suggested and kept the baking powder at just over 1/4 tsp. They came out nice and gooey not at all cakey. I was very pleased (as was everyone else) I only made enough frosting for half so we could compare. I omitted the honey from the frosting recipe and it turned out great. Both the frosted and unfrosted ones were good. Obviously the ones with the frosting were a little sweeter (almost too sweet) than the unfrosted but no one complained :)"
"1","5","These are good!"
"1","2","I've made these about five times. The first time I made them, they turned out perfectly. The next four times (including just now) they turn out like cake, and not even good cake. I can only assume I deviated from the recipe the first time I made them which is what made them good but I've no idea what. The problem is that I think I can replicate it every time I want to make brownies and I turn out with this puffy, cake-y mess that no-one wants to eat. Unfortunate."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. I made a double batch yesterday and they are gone tonight. I will never buy a mix again."
"1","5","I too have made many a brownie and OMG!!! It was WAY to easy to make and WAY to good to eat! Had to bring them to work or I would have eaten all of them!!! Such a hit!! I did it all in one bowl. Melted the butter in the microwave, added everything else. While it baked, made the icing. Only comment was had to add some milk to the icing as it was too stiff. No big deal. Came out of the oven, put on the icing, icing melted beautifully. Cooled, ate, awesome!!!"
"1","5","Yummy"
"1","5","They are soooooo good! I doubled the recipe and put them in a glass 9x13 for 32 minutes and left off the frosting. They are better than any box brand I've ever made. I will be making these again, for sure!!"
"1","4","This was a great recipe, I usually just lessen the sugar. Thanks!"
"1","4","I just tried these brownies but I used coconut oil instead of butter. They turned out and taste good! And also used agave in the frosting instead of honey."
"1","2","The frosting did not work for me. Just turned out like dry crumble so I added quite a bit of cream to make it spreadable. Wish I had first read the review that says you have to melt the butter and 1/2 the confectioners sugar."
"1","5","I love theses brownies! They are a favorite in my family. I found the frosting to be a bit dry so I add about 1Tbsp of water to smooth it out."
"1","3","I ll have to agree with the comments that these were like cake. They barely covered a 9 by 13 pan so next time I might double recipe. They were good but, I was looking for brownies not cake."
"1","4","Great brownie recipe, but would not make the frosting again. Made these twice now - once with original frosting and once with another frosty from All Recipes - will NOT use this frosting recipe again."
"1","4","Delicious! But probably too sweet. I'd try reducing the sugar. 1 cup of sugar is a lot!!"
"1","5","After such mixed reviews…I had to give this a try. In the oven now, smells amazing in here! Even the batter was good :) (I know, I'm probably going to die from eating raw eggs, but I'll take my chances :) ) I'll finish this review when I get my glass of milk poured and the brownies out of the oven. Probably won't frost them, but I can't see how 1 T of honey is going to skew the frosting recipe THAT much (like so many reviewers pointed out). We'll see…..stand by……  Later….I don't know what to tell the folks that could not manage to get this recipe to work out….they are great. Not cake like, not flat and dense. If it looks like a brownie, and smells like a brownie, and acts like a brownie, it is indeed most likely a brownie. Goodbye Betty Crocker…hello homemade! Thanks Angie for a great recipe."
"1","5","Made as is and they were amazing!!! The second time I added an extra Tbs of butter to the frosting. Much easier to work with. I also make these with gluten free flour. These are fantastic!"
"1","5","Wonderfully easy to make. Wonderfully dense and chocolaty. Didn't use the full one cup of confectioner's sugar to keep the frosting a bit more chocolaty. Will def be adding this to the recipe box. Great recipe!"
"1","5","These are definitely the best brownies! I cut the icing recipe in half because it is too much otherwise and overpowers the brownies."
"1","1","Came out cakey and not fudgy at all... terrible recipe!"
"1","5","Followed recipe exactly and came out delicious and chewy."
"1","5","Just tried it today. I was craving for chocolate and there it was. The taste was not overly sweet, just right. I just added some pecan nuts and rice flour. 'Yummy!'   And yes I had to double the recipe."
"1","4","This is an amazing brownies recipe, i added Twix bars to it, it was perfect!!! Wet, light and easy!"
"1","5","5out5 with my twist,wont be buying box again, no icing sweet enough without would be way over loaded with sweet , doubled batch 1cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar melted only half the butter and had the other half softened and i put one extra tsp of vanilla and i added 2Tbsp oil and baked for 45-50 minutes ends being 1/4 inch little crunchy but the middle and rest is all good soft and moist."
"1","5","These are great brownies. Very simple and quick to make. I didn't make the icing but they didn't need them. I will make these again."
"1","5","these are really excellent and every time I have made them they've gotten better!"
"1","5","This recipe was amazing! The first time I did it exactly as recipe stated and it was great. I just finished serving it a second time (daughter requested it for her birthday dessert!) and it was still slightly warm from the oven and divine! The only thing I did different this time was to change to all organic ingredients AND I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter....MMMMMMMMMMM!!! This recipe is a keeper!"
"1","5","Great brownies! I make these when I don't have any chocolate chips on hand, and it's true, they always turn out."
"1","5","Love this brownie recipe! And super easy to make and to include the kids in making them!"
"1","5","These are fantastic! Moist, melt in you mouth. The only thing I did a little different was added a little milk to the frosting so it was a little thinner. Yum,Yum"
"1","5","Had a craving for brownies and didn't have any mix.So I decided on this recipe.I will never buy store mix again.These are nice and chewy and pefect texture.I added a bit of warm milk to the icing to thin it out a little.These are great!"
"1","5","This recipe is awesome! I made it twice now, with and without frosting. My husband & I loved it a lot and enjoy having milk after eating this truly best brownies. It's chewy in the inside and is so delicious. And the frosting by the way is a killer. Thanks for sharing this."
"1","5","These brownies were amazing! I followed what CRBOWLES suggested and hand mixed. I also added melted peanut butter- swirling it into the batter right before pouring it into the pan. Beautiful and SO delicious!"
"1","5","This has become my go-to brownie recipe. It is a fudgy chocolate paradise! I'm not a frosting person so I make them without. If you're feeding more than 4 people desert I would double the batch. They go quick! To avoid a cake like brownie mix gently by hand. This is really a fool proof recipe. Always comes out perfect:)Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","Truly THE best brownies! On our 3rd (frosting-less) batch now...so yummy! Only thing I did differently was melt the butter in the microwave and let it cool. Then I mixed dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls before combining. These turn out perfectly every time, a little gooey and a little cake-y. Delicious!"
"1","5","i love this recipe!!!!! the brownies taste wonderful but i found out that if you use salt instead of sugar it taste awful. you should not try to alter this recipe as it taste fine the way this website makes it. also dont use vanilla instead of chocolate."
"1","5","OMG, so good! Will never make a boxed mix again. I love that they are made with baking cocoa, which I always have on hand. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. The batter is thick enough I made a foil divider for 1/3 of my pan and mixed chopped up Andes Mints in 1/3 for a mint chocolate brownie. They were fantastic that way, and my mom and husband loved the plain ones. I didn't make the frosting/glaze, they were plenty sweet on their own. Thanks again!!!!!"
"1","5","These are the only brownies I have ever liked!"
"1","4","These brownies came out pretty good. I gave them four stars because they were so easy to make and just about everyone would have the ingredients in the pantry. I am surprised people came out with cake like brownies with only 1/2 cup of flour. They must be over mixing the batter. Just mix enough to get the dry ingredients wet and don't over bake them. I think I will leave the frosting off next time as it was a bit sweet and I don't think the brownies need it. If you do make the frosting add a tiny amount of milk or water. By the way this is a Hersey recipe except that has walnuts and the frosting adds milk."
"1","5","Super easy and super delicious! Everyone wanted the recipe! They are very moist and chewy and fudged, just the way I like my brownies."
"1","5","Seriously, best brownies ever!"
"1","5","Very easy and SOOOOO yummy! I never made brownies from scratch and these were done in a flash. Throw away the box for good!"
"1","3","They were good, but not what I was hoping for. To me- they were to 'wet'. They were also too sweet, if that was even possible!? I would've never thought that would have come out of my mouth. I wanted a nice dense brownie, not too crumbly- but also a little thicker, and maybe more cake like. I won't make these again."
"1","3","They were okay but not the best brownie recipe I've found. I didn't make the frosting and thought that they needed more sugar. Also, after 25 minutes I found that my brownies were slightly over done. All ovens seem to be different but definitely keep an eye on them. Although the method was easy, I don't think I'll be trying these again."
"1","5","FOOL. PROOF. Make sure the butter is not hot or it will curdle the eggs. Warm is fine."
"1","5","My my my sugar overload indeed but it's soooo good ^_^ added some pecans and chocolate chip on mine as fillings ^_^"
"1","5","These turned out amazing! I used Dark cocoa and added mini chocolate chips to make the batter even more rich. When doubling the recipe, I followed Bakedbyjen's advice, only using 3 eggs and keeping the salt the same, which worked really well. The brownies were the perfect texture in my opinion. For the icing, however, I doubled the recipe and it turned into a firm dough essentially. I slowly added warm milk to the icing mixture until it was the ideal smoothness, and that worked very well! I would say I used about 1/8 of a cup of warm milk, maybe a bit more."
"1","5","Best homemade brownies ever! So fudgy! I followed the recipe exactly, but I omitted the frosting and mixed 4oz cream cheese with 1/4 cup sugar & 1/2tsp vanilla and swirled it on the top before baking 25 minutes!"
"1","5","Loved this recipe, brownies came out perfectly and were moist! I did do half brown sugar and half white. I also added a little bit of Kahlua to give it a subtle taste of a coffee. I can definitely see myself making this again and again in the future!"
"1","5","Very good brownies. Super easy to make. I did not do the frosting because I had a cream cheese frosting left over to use."
"1","5","Followed the original recipe as directed and everything turned out great. Quick and easy recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","I consider myself a good baker, yet good brownie recipes have proven to be elusive. Today I tried this recipe and I am a believer! The only thing I did differently was use half a cup of cocoa since, in my opinion, most recipes fall slightly short in the chocolate area. I also added half a cup of Ghirardelli chocolate chips. Yum!!!!!"
"1","3","easy to make. mine came out more cakey. which i don't mind, but was looking for something more dense like in the pic."
"1","5","Holy ! These are soooooo good, moist, fudgy, & simply delicious!"
"1","1","I thought this would be SO YUMMY and it was awful! My 7 year old was playing w it like play-dough instead of eating it. I use a lot of AR recipes and this is the 1st time I'm posting since being a member of 6 years, but had to, YUCK! I followed the direction step by step. Making sure to place the ingredients as they were called in order. I made the frosting too. I only cooked (Phoenix, AZ) for 23 mins at 350 and they were done. But they were nasty. Frosting made it all stretchy (play-dough, the flour in the pan left a white dust crust and my children of 5 and 7 ate just one bite. Just saying it's not as good as I thought! They smell GREAT, but taste awful!"
"1","5","Forgot to replenish vanilla extract after the holidays so used Kahlua instead! Doubled it! Yum!"
"1","5","Fantastic brownie recipe. It's the only one I really use."
"1","4","These came out a little dry for me but I topped them with moist icing so they were pretty decent after that."
"1","3","I thought these were just OK."
"1","5","These brownies are great! They are very moist and the perfect texture. The batch is smaller than I'm used to, but you can always double the recipe. I made the frosting as well, but found it to be a little thick. The taste was good, but definetly not creamy."
"1","5","These are outstanding!! Only brownies I will make!!! Also of anyone is curious these turn out wonderfully subbed with whole wheat flour (instead of all-purpose) and sucanat (instead of white sugar) if wanting to make them healthier!! :-)"
"1","5","After moving to high-altitude Colorado from Texas, I thought for sure that this recipe would be a disaster! I was wrong! I just made them for my husband, stepdaughter, and mother-in-law, and they all loved them!!! My mother-in-law actually had hers gone before my husband and I sat down to eat ours! Lol.  Next time, I will definitely only use a 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar for the frosting, as it was super sweet... even for me!"
"1","4","Cook the icing on a burner on very low to keep the icing thin and spreadable. Add a tea spoon of cinnamon to the brownie batter"
"1","5","Best brownie recipe ever! I made these without the frosting and they were still incredible! Kids asked for more the next day but they were all gone. Making more again tonight. Super easy and better than any recipe I've tried. Not a cakey brownie but it's not a heavy brownie either."
"1","3","I tried this recipe last night and it wasn't anything special. Maybe if I would of made the frosting with it, but as far as the actual brownie...I wasn't impressed."
"1","5","These are seriously delicious. I decided to mix it all in the sauce pan I heated the butter in… well I accidentally over heated the butter (it was boiling right on the verge burning) I removed it off the heat and waited a few minutes to let it cool…. when I added the sugar the pan was still really hot and it started to stick to the bottom of the pan so I had to stir it to keep it from burning… it actually almost caramelized. This quite possibly made them even more delicious."
"1","2","These are slightly bitter, not chocolatey or sweet enough, and they are a strange texture. I mixed by hand and they still turned out cake-like; they weren't chewy at all. I guess I'll had to keep looking for my perfect brownie recipe."
"1","5","Just made them. They disappeared right away."
"1","5","Ok so I just made these brownies and they are by far the best brownies ever! Just as other reviewers have said. They turned out perfect as is with no adjustments needed. I will definately need to make a double batch the next time I make them. I never take the time to review, mostly because I forget to, but as soon as I took the first bite I thought 'I need to write a review for these' and did so right away. I just can't say enough. So what are you waiting for? Make these!"
"1","5","These are so rich and delicious!"
"1","5","I made this recipe, and it was absolutely amazing! My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it! i ended up having to make a double batch because my dad is a truck driver and he wanted a bunch to take with him on the road. So i made the original recipe, and then made another pan with sweet n low because he is a diabetic, and he said they turned out wonderful! They were just as good with the sweet n low as they were with the sugar. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This was great as-is! I made this last night and used maybe a 1/4C less sugar and some stevia for baking just to make sure I didn't lose any sweetness. I also added about two teaspooons of corn syrup for extra gooey/chewy middle pieces (this worked great!). For a healthier twist I added a decent amount of psyllium and a tablespoon of chia seeds. Love that I can bump up this recipe nutritionally and still feel like I'm eating a ridiculously tasty treat! Faster than cookies and uses less butter -- love that I can whip these up after dinner and have them ready in half an hour. Baking time was perfect around 26 minutes for me. :) Also, to those who find their brownies turn out cakey, be careful of TWO THINGS: amount of moisture added, and amount of baking powder. I added a splash of coffee to mine once to round out the chocolatey flavour but they puffed up like cake! If you follow the recipe carefully it should turn out beautifully. Thanks for posting!"
"1","5","This was AWESOME I love love love brownies and this is a good recipe I actually made this recipe into brownie bites by putting them in a mini muffin tin and cooked them for 15 mins it made about 20 so just enough for one serving ;) yum!"
"1","4","they are the best brownies!! The only thing I will do next time is add more chocolate. Whether it be in the cocoa powder or some chips, they need more of a chocolate taste."
"1","5","Wow. Absolutely perfect. I had to sub shortening for butter because I was making these at the in-laws and they only had margarine or shortening, no butter. Delicious, melt-in-your-mouth brownies--better than any boxed mix."
"1","5","These are the 'bomb'. I tried this recipe for a Christmas gift, tried one and almost kept them. Without a doubt, the best brownies I have ever had."
"1","3","These brownies are fine. I would definitely recommend letting them sit for a day. I wouldn't call them the best brownies, but they're okay. The best part about them is the fact that they're so incredibly easy. Those of you who thought they were too cakey should consider leaving out the baking powder. If you prefer them to be chewy, you could try substituting an egg for two egg whites."
"1","5","The first time I made this it came out tasting too buttery. But other than that they were delicious, and I loved the texture. So I made them again, determined to get it just so. I double the recipe because of the size of the dish I use to bake, it seems to be a bit too large. So here is what I do, I double the rest of the recipe as normal, but for the butter part I melt 1/2 cup butter and used canola oil for the other 1/2 cup. This made it have less of an overpowering butter taste, but kept it delicious. I also leave out the additional salt because I use salted butter. I also don't make the frosting to put on because brownies just don't need it. These are perfect without it. I bake until I stick a knife in and it comes out mostly clean. I find that this allows that cakey texture to mix better with the inner fudgy texture. This is a MUST try recipe, and if you don't get it right the first time, don't give up. When you get it just right, trust me, it will be worth it. And DON'T be afraid to change something. I added crushed cocoa covered almonds on top just for a little something extra and it brings a different flavor without overpowering the awesomeness that is the brownie.  If you grew up on box recipes like me and decide that homemade is better, this is a great recipe to start off with. It's far more nummy than anything you will get in a box. Try it!"
"1","2","The texture is good, chewy & moist. For that I give 2-3 stars. I followed the top tips of hand stirring and not over beating. However, the flavor is lacking. It just doesn't taste brownie-ish. I'm looking for more chocolate and fudgyness (flavor) that comes w/brownie. The sweet/salt factor is off also (not sweet/salty enough). I guess the frosting is needed-- I didn't make it."
"1","5","The first time I made these brownies, I didn't make the frosting and these brownies came out awesome'"
"1","2","Brownies were alright but the frosting was so thick and dry ! had to try adding more butter but still not spreadable."
"1","5","i like it"
"1","3","For us, these were just ok. They are pretty, but there are better recipes out there."
"1","5","best brownie ever"
"1","5","Perfect cake. We enjoyed!"
"1","5","I'm a 17 year old girl, and I make these brownies for my friends at school once a month, and they can't get enough of them. I have to triple the recipe just to make enough for everyone who wants ONE brownie! I love this recipe. If brownies are your religion, this recipe has got to be your bible."
"1","5","My boyfriend loved these! For sure double the recipe..one user said use 3 eggs instead of 4..I cant' comment on that but i'm sure either way they would turn out great. I didn't have honey so I didn't use it in the frosting recipe..but the frosting is very sweet I can't imagine how sweet the honey would make it. I would just use a little milk to make it more creamy. Dont cook over 25 minutes. IF you have an all mighty new or high powered oven just cook 23.  Hope that helps!"
"1","5","Ok, First off. I have never rated a recipe here before since I have joined. I love to cook but usually tend to rely on boxed brownies due to eating other peoples homemade versions over the years. lol Every time I have tried someones homemade brownies they are cake like, dry, and in need of something to drink to get them down. I was in need of something to pack in my children's lunches due to running out of snack cakes. I was skeptical and read all of the negative reviews first. I followed the directions exactly and remembered to not over mix the batter and left them in the oven exactly 25 mins. Let them cool completely. THEY ARE AMAZING! The only negative i could even come up with is if you have a super sweet tooth you may want to add more sugar. My husband loved them and the kids woke up asking for what was left after their lunches were packed for after breakfast! I added this one to my recipe box."
"1","5","I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I will never pick up a boxed mix again! These were very easy to make, and have such great taste and moisture. Please, if you are thinking about making a batch, do it! Thanks for this recipe! It is currently the best brownies I have had! They are SO perfect! I only changed one thing. For the icing, I did not use honey, I just put in a VERY little amount of water. You have to give these a go! Family favorite! :)"
"1","4","Pretty good!"
"1","5","I made these two days in a row. The first batch was for a party, so I doubled the recipe, & baked them in a 9X13 pan. They turned out a little bit thinner than normal, but that didn't stop anyone, they were GONE in about 20 minutes! I made the second batch tonight just to eat at home, so I didn't double the recipe, & I baked them in an 8X8 pan. They came out thicker, & I baked them so that they were still a little bit gooey. Absolutely delicious!!! I will NEVER buy boxed brownie mix again! :)"
"1","5","Turned out perfectly. I have made twice so far. I never made the frosting, they simply don't need it. Are very moist and fudgy, and come out of the pan perfectly without sticking. I added chocolate chips on top of batter before baking for a little extra interest."
"1","5","perfect, waited 5 years to find such a good recipe"
"1","5","These were brownies are perfect. The frosting is fudgy and delicious. I will be making again and again. No more box brownies for me"
"1","5","awesome! I had to leave out the eggs, but I think it ended up for the better! they were gooey and chewy. I'll definitely make these again."
"1","3","I thought the flavor was decent, but they fell apart when I cut them. Not my favorite recipe."
"1","3","these brownies are more cake like than fudge like"
"1","5","I followed the advice of previous cooks and used a wisk rather than a mixer. Added some butterscotch chips to both the brownies and frosting, which turned out almost like a fudgey glaze. Mmmmm craving satisfied."
"1","3","My brownies came out kind of crumbly, and dry. If they were more soft and fudgy, they would've tasted better."
"1","5","This recipe is great...I also skipped the frosting."
"1","5","I made this recipe EXACTLY as written except I did not make the frosting and it tasted perfect. I also beat the eggs well before adding to the pan and I also mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl before adding to the pan. Do not overmix! I baked at 325 for 22 minutes because my oven runs a little hotter than it should. Very easy recipe. The brownies came out gooey in the middle and the famous brownie 'edge' around the edges. This one is my only brownie recipe now!"
"1","5","Great brownies, swirl in a 1/4 cup caramel to enhance the after snack regrets."
"1","5","Got lots of rave reviews. Thank you"
"1","5","these brownies are absolutely amazing. i doubled the recipe to send in a treat for my husband's work and let me just say these came out perfect even with a ten month old crawling up my legs! i took them out of the oven and let them sit for 5-7 minutes and then frosted and covered. the frosting became soft and moved down the edges of the brownies to create a nice coating. the brownies themselves are more cake like, yes, but pairs perfectly with the creamy frosting. if you are looking for more of a box like brownie then betty crocker has mix for you.  grab a glass of milk, extra napkins and enjoy!"
"1","5","I have tried several brownie recipes and by far this one is tops with several coworkers requesting more. I made the mistake of taking some to work to share, did not last long at all. I do recommend doubling the recipe and using a 9x13 pan. Trust me, 8x8 just does not make enough of these scrumptious goodies."
"1","5","I have made a lot of brownies over the decades, but this recipe was the best. I doubled it, but would agree with the poster who said that you shouldn't double the salt. They froze and thawed well (my four-year old and I both ate them frozen as well!), and I didn't bother with the frosting."
"1","4","The brownie was pretty good, but I had a problem with the icing. I followed the recipe to a T, but upon mixing, it was WAY too dry and didn't come anywhere close to the right consistency for an icing. I had to add a little milk to it, until it looked like icing and was spreadable."
"1","5","I have made these brownies several times now. Each time I have followed the recipe for the brownies to a T and each time they have turned out great. The only thing that I have changed is that I've added a little liquid (usually milk) to the frosting. The very first time that I made these brownies I did not add liquid to the frosting and it was too hard and stiff to spread. Now I usually put the frosting into a piping bag with a large round tip and pipe lines side-by-side when the brownies are still warm. This way the lines melt into each other and make a really nice pattern. This is definitely my favorite homemade brownie recipe that I've found yet. The texture is perfect and they are so rich and yummy. I also think they taste best after being chilled in the refrigerator."
"1","4","The recipe was delicious but a little too sweet. Next time I'll be using less sugar and more flour."
"1","1","Taste good, but what a mess! These puffed up while cooking then flopped down to flat when cooled! We ate a few spoonfuls out of the pan (delicious!) but couldn't take a single one to the event were going to."
"1","3","Anything with this much cocoa, sugar, and butter can't be BAD. However, the brownies were not fudgey or gooey like I prefer mine to be. I only baked them for 20 minutes and there were still a lot of crumbs when I cut them up. Additionally, the frosting was much too thick and not spreadable."
"1","5","Made these to surprise my mom when she came to visit. Added some peanut butter chips, and perfection was the result."
"1","5","These are amazing! I followed a few of the others tips and did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white. I also added @ 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter. (The first time I made them I also had some left over chocolate cookies that turned out flatter than desired that I broke up in the batter...a great brownie mix covers a multitude of cookie failures!) I did not try the glaze/frosting as they are plenty sweet without it. Why would anyone ever buy a box again when there is a recipe like this one???"
"1","5","My family loved these without the frosting I should of doubled it though BC there wasn't enough"
"1","3","These were ok, I made them exactly as written but then didn't turn out fudgy more cake like and a little dry. Wouldn't make them again."
"1","5","These were good brownies. I made sure to read the bad reviews first so I would know what not to do. Apparently the frosting is a dud, and it's pretty redundant to add frosting to brownies anyways, so I left it out. Also I did not beat anything in, I more of stirred with a whisk and everything turned out great. I've had better brownies, but really I was not expecting them to be the absolute best anyways. They were just how I anticipated!"
"1","5","Super yummy recipe! Instead of 1 cup of sugar, I did 1/2 cup of white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Then, I added 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips! The brownies turned out amazing! Oh, I didn't put the frosting on it, because we're not huge frosting fans.good luck"
"1","5","Loved this recipe! Very easy, came out in between cake-like and fudgey for me. Next time I may mix in some chocolate chips. As one user suggested for the frosting, I melted the butter and added only half of the powdered sugar and it went on nicely. I also mixed it by hand and did not use a mixer."
"1","5","So yummy! I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 like suggested and mixed by hand. Baked for the full 30 minutes and they were perfect! Even my daughter, who doesnt normally like chocolate, ate 2! :)"
"1","5","Really good brownies, the best homemade I have made. If they are cake-like then you are over mixing!!!"
"1","5","My boyfriend and I devoured these! I'm already making a second batch but using raspberry extract and fresh raspberries to mix with the rich chocolate flavor."
"1","5","Yummy! Easy! No frosting needed!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness! Be prepared! I am always on the lookout for good brownie recipes, and this one is over the top! I followed the recipe exactly except added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. Yum! When you put the frosting on the warm brownies, it melts and then hardens into a wonderful fudge glaze. My 24 yr. old daughter tasted them( she is not ordinarily a brownie person) closed her eyes, gave a big sigh, and said 'oh, mom!'. Enough said! This is my go to brownie recipe from here on out. None better."
"1","1","This recipe makes cake squares, not brownies. Should have listened to NOVACAT2003."
"1","5","I made these with my friend and they are so AMAZING !!!!!!!! It was so easy to make. They are the best brownies I have ever tried:)"
"1","4","This was one of the best homemade brownie recipes I have made so far. Nice and fudgy. The only bad thing was the frosting was too powdery to be considered a frosting, I had to add a few tbsp. of milk to make it the right consistency. Turned out wonderful with a tall glass of milk."
"1","4","These were good, nice and fudgey. Don't overbake them."
"1","4","They are easy to make above average brownies, although the frosting requires a tablespoon of cream to make it all come together they went in a hurry as soon as they were frosted they went fast"
"1","3","It was just ok. I made them according to the recipe but they were too cake like for me. I prefer a fudge like consistency. The taste was ok, the icing is very sweet. My boyfriend thought they were too sweet. I'll keep looking for a great brownie recipe, this one didn't do it for us."
"1","5","These turned out amazing! I tripled the recipe for a potluck and used five eggs instead of six based on a recommendation from another review. I also forgot to add the baking powder and they still turned out wonderfully. I will be making these over and over again!"
"1","1","These did not come out for me and I'm not sure why. I followed the recipe except for omitting vanilla extract (I was out). They're chewy, hard, just bad. It must have been me because there's so many good reviews here but I don't know what I could have done."
"1","5","This is my go-to for brownies any time I want some for myself or to take to a party. I use gluten free flour instead and it works out just fine...although I double the baking powder to make them even more fluffy. This recipe makes THE BEST BROWNIES :P It's in the title!"
"1","5","I am beside myself with excitement for finally trying this recipe. This is the most fabulous brownie I have ever eaten. They have only been out of the oven for 2 hours. While cutting them, a few pieces broke off, and well, you know......I had planned to wait until tomorrow :-).  The only variable I can imagine that could result in the discrepancies of other reviews is either the quality of the ingredients or incorrect mixing and timing. I used Valhrona chocolate powder. I had a wee bit more than 1/3 c. left, so I threw in the extra. I also used fresh eggs from a friend's chickens and a high quality Madagascar organic vanilla. One other trick I think I heard on Food Network is to always add a touch of espresso powder to any baked chocolate dessert. So I timidly added 1/4 tsp. I was also vigilant regarding my baking time, as I like a gooey, chewy, fudgy brownie. I checked them at 18 minutes, then added 3 more minutes for a total of 21 minutes baking time. A toothpick came out nearly clean and I feared that I left them a minute too long. Alas, once cooled, they were the perfect consistency, so tender that I had to be careful lifting them from the plate. Another thing I did was to line my pan with parchment paper. I left 2 sides longer in order to have handles for removing them. I am glad I did that, as it would have been difficult to remove them otherwise. Thank you so much, Angie. These will become a foundation for my company chocolate desserts. I anticipate experimenting!!"
"1","5","these brownies are absolutely delish!they are very simple to make (i am under 15) and i make them for the kids i babysit and they all just love them!they are so great!"
"1","5","I LOVE this recipe!! Although I have to admit I added 1/2 cup of melted chocolate to the butter&sugar mixture and it really changed these brownies into being more fudgy (which is what I like) but still an in between cake and fudge brownie. These are my go to treats and everyone loves them!"
"1","3","The brownies themselves do not have much chocolate flavor. The frosting adds more chocolate flavor but not great. I will not make these again."
"1","5","Amazing!!! Very easy to make! Be sure use a spoon instead of a mixer and don't over mix if you like your brownies fudgey like we do!!! We added some chocolate chips to top them off."
"1","5","Great recipe! Will definitely use this as my 'go to' brownie recipe. Along with other reviews, I did not make the frosting, I simply topped with a white chocolate drizzle."
"1","5","I just took these out of the oven. Of course I just couldn't wait and I'm typing this as the roof of my mouth is burning, but , these are some good brownies. I followed the recipe exactly but I don't own an 8x8 pan. I used an 8x12 pan and only left them in the oven for 15 minutes. I also did not make the frosting because I have no honey on hand. They are GREAT just the way they are!!"
"1","5","I tried this yesterday and the brownies turned out to be the BEST!!! :) Both my husband and I loved them. In all ways the brownies exceeded my expectations. Very good, easy recipe and it did not take much time. I did not frost my brownies.. they were superb without that. And only change I made was to lower the sugar amount to 3/4 cup and the sweetness was perfect for both of us. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! :)"
"1","5","I agree with other reviewers that noted that this is a brownie that falls between cake and fudge style. It deserves the high rating. One pot to make these and they truly are done within an hour from start to finish. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts and did not choose to make this frosting, but instead, made a creamier style chocolate frosting and topped each brownie with a walnut half. Additionally, the better the cocoa you use, the better the result. I use Callebaut cocoa (you can order it online) and it's worth EVERY cent. It's not cheap, but two pounds will last you a long time and EVERYONE will ask you how you make your chocolate desserts. It makes a tremendous difference. This recipe is delightfully easy and you'll find yourself saying, 'I'll never buy a box brownie mix again.'"
"1","5","I think this recipe made delicious brownies. My husband and my guests agree. Mine turned out like brownies, not cake. I followed the recipe and the directions exactly. Picture to follow when I make them again. We ate them all."
"1","5","These brownies are even better the next day, so I recommend making the night before, cooling completely then covering for the next day and don't overbake."
"1","5","These are delicious. Not as tall as a traditional brownie, but the frosting makes up for that. They're also very rich, so I cut them small. Definitely will be making these again."
"1","4","These were pretty good, hubby loved them with a scoop, (well several scoops) of Ice Cream."
"1","5","This is a great recipe I made these without the icing and I added 1/2 cup of walnuts and they turned out wonderful. Definitely do not over cook, mine were done in 20 minutes."
"1","4","Awesome recipe! I have already made a few brownies from other recipes on this site.... but this one beats them all by far. I added 1/2 cup of walnuts and semisweet chocolate to the batch and baked for 25minutes as per other suggestions by reviewers. I also doubled the ingredients since you could never have too much brownie. Didnt even bother making the frosting, brownies were great without it. My husband and son gave me rave reviews and I do too."
"1","5","I made these for our family reunion and they turned out wonderful!! They taste as if I worked hard to make them, but they were sooooo easy to whip up!! Did let my family know that though :-)"
"1","3","Too cakey and not enough chocolate taste. Maybe instead of using 1 cup of sugar to flavor the brownie you can use actual chocolate."
"1","5","They hit the spot! I substituted half the butter with virgin coconut oil (AMAZING), it takes the flavor to a whole new realm of YUM! As well as keeping them from becoming cake-like. I also left of the icing, because that's for cake. 5 women ate the whole pan in one sitting, so they passed the test!"
"1","5","Mine turned out fantastic!! I only used one egg because I like them fudgy. I added about 2 Tbsp on milk to make up the moisture of the missing egg. I added about 1/2 cp of chocolate chips. Oh my, oh my. They were, I would have to say, the best brownies I have ever made. I will use this recipe from now on."
"1","5","I've been using this site for years but this is the first time I've taken the time to review a recipe. This is the best brownie recipe I've ever tried, and I've been making homemade brownies for almost 40 years. If you want a thin crust on top and chewy in the center (not cake-like at all) use this recipe. The secret is NOT to over-mix the batter. Just mix enough to blend everything. The more you whip anything with eggs and flour, the more cakey it will be because you are incorporating more air into it. I am officially throwing away all my old brownie recipes....this is the one."
"1","5","Really good, but they are thin. To make them chewier, I used only 1 egg."
"1","5","awsome"
"1","5","The most common mistake that people do when making brownies is that they beat the mixture. Don't ever beat the brownie batter with a mixer, always mix by hand with a wooden spoon. Once you've combined your wet ingredients and are ready to add the dry, use a wooden spoon to do so. You don't want to incorporate too much air into the batter, that's what turns it into a cake-like consistency like the reviewer-NOVACAT2003. Had she have known the basic brownie rules she wouldn't have had cake instead. This recipe is perfectly fine!"
"1","5","it is a great recipe! I received many compliments and many brownie-goers were going up for seconds. I changed the recipe servings to 40 for a large gathering, and took out an egg thinking it may make it less cake-like, but they came out flat! SO I will follow directions completely next time. The frosting was AMAZING and so easy, people couldn't believe how simple the ingredients were. Great recipe,"
"1","5","my family is not a fan of brownies... but when i made these they didnt last one day, my family loved them, they're soft, chewy and amazing. THESE BROWNIES ARE THE BEST :)"
"1","5","Love these! I've been searching for a brownie recipe that was both easy and awesome. These foot that bill. I'm really picky when it comes to brownies and this is the first homemade brownie that turned out like a brownie."
"1","5","This recipe was so simple and quick. I added 1/4 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/8 of a cup of chopped walnuts. Mix some in and sprinkle the rest on the top. So delicious! (No icing needed because the brownies are sweet but not over sweet!)"
"1","5","Wow. Delicious! Made them in an 11x7 pyrex pan and added about 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. Cooked for 25 min. Came out perfect. Yum!!"
"1","5","These brownies were delicious! I was in a pinch and needed to make something for a party with ingredients that I had on hand. I've tried a handful of other homeade brownie recipes and none of them ever compared to the box, so I had my doubts. I was pleasantly surprised however with this recipe. They were wonderful, even without the icing. I doubled the recipe and put in 13x9 in pan and they turned out great."
"1","4","Awesome homemade brownies. Tried to find one that could be dairy free. Used Earth Balance buttery spread instead of butter because my daughter has a dairy allergy and took the advice of one other reviewer and didn't use a beater. Just mixed with a spoon and they were perfect!"
"1","4","Not sure about 'best' brownies, but defininitely nice easy recipe with simple ingredients most bakers have on hand. More of an everyday recipe rather than something for a special occassion, but what's not to love about chocolate frosted brownies!"
"1","5","Very simple recipe that makes very delicious and fudgy brownies! My husband isn't big on sweets and he loved these! I left off the frosting because I think brownies are better without. I'm never going back to a brownie mix again."
"1","5","I doubled the brownie recipe and then added white chocolate to the frosting to make it a little more smoother and they came out amazing!!!"
"1","5","I have been searching for the perfect brownie and I think I found it in these! They were DELICIOUS! Made them for my birthday tonight. My only complaint was the thick frosting. I ended up putting it on the warm brownies and putting it back in the oven to melt the frosting. Next time I will either melt the butter like someone suggested or add a touch of milk to the frosting. This is a keeper!"
"1","5","very good, had no brownie mix and saw this one, made it with egg white as there were no eggs in the house and they came out perfect! as good as a box if not better"
"1","5","Doubling the recipe – I forgot to increase the baking time. (Duh!) They were too soft – I figured – often brownies firm up as they cool – so I frosted them . . . they did not firm up. Sticking them in the oven for a little longer – I think maybe had I not frosted them they might have firmed up. The edges were fine – the way too soft middles – I used ‘mushy middle’ making a parfait layering whip cream banana pudding and gooey brownies. When dessert time – topped with ice-cream – and the firm brownies – it was OH SO GOOD- redirecting to a parfait was – well – very fancy – big hit. The brownie and frosting are quite the five star – I’ll be making again very soon."
"1","5","I just made a double batch of these brownies and they were moist and chocolatey, even with a couple small adjustments. I used half butter and half pumpkin, I hate to eat all that grease. I also used half whole-wheat flour to give the brownie a little substance. Still Yummy! Will be saving this recipe!"
"1","4","Tried this recipe and enjoyed preparing it. Although it did not take 25 mins to prepare, 25 mins included cooking time for us. It came out rather dry and the bottom broke off, but still yummy to us. The bottom may have broken because our case/pan may have become un-sticky due to overuse of calamari. Overall a great taste just not the most appealing brownie."
"1","5","My Achilles heel has always been brownies - I am forever under or over baking them! These I have to say are fool proof - even I can make them!  I quadrupled the batch for 2 9x13 pans for a bake sale I was having, and they came out amazing - definitely a hit with my coworkers! This will now be my go-to recipe for brownies... and its so simple too!  To note though, I don't add the frosting as I think they are perfect w/o it."
"1","4","I actually love the brownie part of this recipe it's very simple, easy and turns out everything we look for in a brownie, fudgy, chewy and tasty! Now the topping I will not make again in my opinion it did nothing but bring this recipe down. I remade the brownie part of the recipe and topped with homemade caramel and chunky chopped pecans absolutely killer the whole family gave it 2 thumbs up."
"1","4","I found this to be a solid 4 star recipe. Batch # 1 had me thinking it didn't need the frosting- the brownies were perfectly, mouth-wateringly fudgy and delicious, (I baked them for about 23 minutes & they seemed the perfect chewy consistency) It didn't SEEM like there was a need for frosting, and the frosting was too clumpy to adequately spread, so I just kind of lopped it on there the best I could. HOWEVER, there were nowhere near 16 servings. I could barely cut them into 8 fair slices for guests, so I made Batch #2, and omitted the frosting. I baked batch #2 for the full 25 minutes, and they came out much more cake-like and less tasty (to me) and I didn't have time to do the frosting, which these definitely needed. So, my recommendation is- under-cook them just slightly, and use the frosting, even if it is a bit unsightly. I found myself going back to Batch #1 and having to slap my own hands not to eat all of them!"
"1","5","Tastes like yummy store bought brownies, without the added CRUD. We really liked this recipe. Just fudgy enough:) I added a simple buttercream/cocoa frosting. We LOVED them. In fact... we made them TWICE this week, lol!"
"1","5","Soooo good! These brownies have the yummy texture of boxed brownies but delicious homemade flavor. I added more cocoa powder than suggested to kick up the chocolate and left off the icing. I have officially found my go-to brownie recipe."
"1","1","I must admit..I did not make the topping..but I did not like this recipe at all. It was not sweet at all..and this is the first and last time I'll try a brownie recipe without real chocolate"
"1","1","These were really dense and lacked the sweetness I expect from brownies. Definitely more of a cake bar that tastes bitter instead of the chewy, chocolatey brownies that I love. I'll go back to my old brownie recipe."
"1","5","I have made this brownie several times already but I always skip the frosting. Even my picky husband LOVES it!!! Very rich and so tasty!!! I have to say that I will never use one of those brownie mixes ever again..."
"1","5","Very easy recipe. perfect brownies, comes out everytime!"
"1","4","I believe this was the first time I've ever had non-box mix brownies. They were different, and a little bit flour-y tastiing, but still really good. The consistency was right in between that of a 'cakey brownie' and a 'fudge brownie.' I didn't make the frosting because I wanted to taste the brownies by themselves since it was my first time. I would make these again, and probably try the frosting."
"1","2","Never wrote a review before, but in my opinion, these are not the Best Brownies. Taste is not what I have ever thought a brownie should be! Easy to make but I will not make again. Followed recipe exactly."
"1","5","These are so good. My family loves these brownies and they are so easy to make. No point in buying boxed brownies when you have these!!!"
"1","5","These totally hit the spot for a chocolate craving. Did increase the cocoa to 1/2 cup. Also substituted fat free greek yogurt for 1/2 the butter. Needed to cook probably 5 extra minutes for the extra moisture."
"1","5","I've been making these brownies for years and they are awesome. The only changes I make are increasing cocoa powder to half a cup and adding a couple handfuls of chocolate chips for max chocolaty-ness. Highly recommended!"
"1","5","I have this recipe in my Hershey's chocolate cookbook and it is a very good recipe. There is an ingredient that was omitted for the frosting though. You will need to add 2 TBSP milk."
"1","5","I think I could be on Jerry Springer in the episode 'I am in love with my brownies.' I made these and they were DELICIOUS. Best brownies I've ever made. For the icing, add 1 tsp of milk (or even water if you didn't have milk) to thin it out a little... don't skip the icing it's amazing!!!"
"1","5","These are delicious. I didn't use vanilla (because I ran out) and put in a little extra cocoa powder and some chocolate chips, but they would have been awesome even if I stuck exactly to the recipe. I mixed everything in my KitchenAid after I melted the butter and they came out excellent. Cooked for about 27 minutes. My fiance, who asked me to make 'really fudgey' brownies, loved them.  I did not make the frosting and added a little caramel topping instead. It was too much -- they're great all alone."
"1","5","This was SO easy to make! I didn't use all of the frosting though because it seemed like a lot, and took away from the actual flavor of the brownie. The brownie itself had a perfect moist and chewy consistency and the flavor was dynamite."
"1","1","Didn't like them at all! :( Too flat, too compact, not enough chocolate flavor."
"1","5","My hubby said 'You gotta review this recipe'. He absolutly LOVED these brownies, and I must say they were not too shabby. A really nice treat."
"1","5","Delicious! They melt in your mouth! I ate two right out of the oven. I made a couple of changes to the frosting as others suggested, halved the powdered sugar, and melted the butter. I ended up melting a tbsp more butter, and a 1/2 tbsp or so more honey to get the consistency I wanted. I also melted the mixture for about 20 seconds in the microwave before putting it on the brownies. This makes a delicious glaze which I prefer over the frosting. Yummy! Will be my go to brownie recipe from now on!"
"1","3","Made these last night and just ate one. Made them according to the directions, including the frosting (except only used 1 cup of confectioners sugar and a little milk to thin). Very unimpressed. Don't get me wrong... they are good, but not impressive. They tasted like store-bought packaged brownies (not even store-bough bakery brownies!), and in my opinion nothing homemade should ever taste like packaged food. I'll keep the recipe for those chocolate cravings when I don't have any special ingredients in the house, but won't make again when I'm trying to impress myself or others. A little bummed since this had such high ratings. Oh well... it is nice to have a recipe that's so simple and I almost always have all these ingredients. Maybe I can work on it by adding melted chocolate to the batter and working on the frosting or something. We'll see."
"1","5","I prefer them without the frosting because I like things less sweet."
"1","4","I enjoyed this brownie recipe! Many recipes for brownies cost a fortune in ingredients. This one was not bad! I did not have much success with the frosting. It was crumbly and refused to come together. so, I just added some heavy cream until it pulled together. I too doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and it worked just fine! As far the cakey vs. fudgy debate... it is fudgy to me :) hope this helps!"
"1","5","All I have to say is YUM!"
"1","5","I've made this recipe twice & they have turned out delicious both times. I used a different frosting recipe found on this site for the second batch. The first batch I didn't use a frosting and they were still really good."
"1","5","I make these without the topping. Instead of the topping I add some pecans. They're very good! Mix til it just comes together. Don't beat them into submission or you will end up with (still tasty) cake."
"1","5","Perfect brownies. Gone in a minute!"
"1","4","Liked this recipe It melt in your mouth and very easy. I just tried to reduced the sugar for half a cup because its too sweet for me and my kidz and friend love it."
"1","5","Absolutely the best fudgy, moist and delicious brownies I've ever made or tasted. No need for the frosting however, they are sweet enough to stand alone. I did add my own touch of honey glazed sliced almonds in the batter as well as a generous sprinkling on top, and it was AMAZING. My husband said it's the best tasting brownie he's ever had in his life."
"1","2","I wish I'd read the reviews first, thank-you Mama Cass, yes, you need to use half the amount of powdered sugar for the icing... I also used a couple of dashes of almond milk to get it to whip up... it looks exactly like a glaze, but thickens nicely as it cools. Very sweet, very rich... unfortunately, I think there's too much icing the way I made it, maybe I didn't let them cool long enough before frosting them, but my brownies were more like a chocolate lava cake. Very gooey, wouldn't stay together. Tasty, though."
"1","4","I have a much more complicated brownie recipe that I use to impress people, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good these came out. I was craving something and this hit the spot."
"1","4","I should start by saying the only reason I made these brownies was for chef john's holiday rum balls recipe from this site and it was the easiest recipe I laid eyes on, but as brownies go these were pretty good as well as easy. Mine weren't really cake like as some people have had, but sort of in between cake and fudge brownies like another reviewer said. I didn't use the frosting as I don't need it. I made two batches before realising that one batch makes a little over a pound of brownies (now I can double the rum ball recipe, yay). With the extras that didn't get eaten I just warmed in the microwave and topped with hot fudge and ice cream, these brownies are perfect for that."
"1","4","These brownies were great --chocolaty, chewy, perfect and a breeze to make. I made them without the frosting for the first go but will try with the frosting next time. Absolutely critical not to over bake."
"1","5","AMAZING!!! So good. Thank you for the recipe. I made the brownies and icing as stated; the icing was a little hard to spread even though I put it on the warm brownies. Update 10/24/14 - Made this gluten free by using white rice flour instead of all purpose; recipe turned out beautifully!"
"1","5","Perfect. Used butter vanilla flavoring, will never go back to box mixes! I love that this recipe uses ingredients that I already have on hand!"
"1","5","YUM! These were a BIG hit with the whole family. I,too, doubled the recipe and it was barely enough! So good. It's a keeper."
"1","5","These are so rich and amazing. Instead of beating the batter, I mixed it instead so they wouldn't turn out so fluffy. The only thing I didn't like was how difficult it was to put the frosting on (I made it early and it settled a bit). The taste is phenomenal though!"
"1","5","Honestly, I have never made homemade brownies before but holy moly. These brownies are the best brownies ever. If you can look past the two cups of sugar required (batter/frosting) and the stick and a half of butter, you will enjoy them as much as I did. They are very easy to make. The frosting is more of a fudge and if you are brave, double the frosting recipe. It will add a whole different delicious fudgy layer to the already amazing brownie. It does make for much all in all (the batter) but it's so decadent that you only need a few bites. :)"
"1","4","Exactly what I needed to satisfy my chocolate craving! I doubled the recipe, and it worked out. The only thing I might change is the frosting -- i had to add milk to make it more spreadable."
"1","5","These brownies are awesome!! I had a dark chocolate candy bar that was 85% dark chocolate and i melted it and used 1/3 cup of that instead of the cocoa powder. It was delicious and easy!!"
"1","5","The first time I made these brownies for my husband, they reminde me of Little Debbie fudge brownies. Very rich and tasty. Especially if you are craving chocolate. Whoever came up with this recipe, my husband says, 'thank you!!' PS, no need to change this recipe."
"1","3","Eh, they were ok. I mean it's a brownie and it's chocolate so it can't be bad, but I've had better. Still on the search for the perfect brownie recipe."
"1","4","This is basically the same recipe as 'mmm mmm better brownies' on this site. It just uses butter instead of oil."
"1","5","sister made at my house...really yummy. didn't need the icing but sister and sister in law liked the icing."
"1","1","Really disappointed... not chocolatey enough and had a weird taste... not chewy..."
"1","3","I did not enjoy these at all. The kids said they were good, but... Definitely need oil instead of butter. I like my brownies fudgy, these were very cakey."
"1","5","The best brownies is right!. i always read other reviewers before baking and with this one it is so important not to over mix. They turn out perfect every time. I do like to melt 1/3 cup of chocolate as well as the cocoa powder. I want to make some right now lol."
"1","5","These are really good and very easy!! We like nuts in our brownies so I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I had to make changes to the frosting. It was so dry it looked like hot cocoa mix so I added 2 tablespoons of milk to make it smooth enough to spread. Also, I didn't have honey so I substituted corn syrup which turned out well. I will definitely make these again."
"1","5","I loved this recipe! It was the best recipe I've ever made for brownies! This is so delicious!"
"1","5","These are great and easy! My husband had a hankering for brownies at 11pm. I had no desire to run to the market so subbed whole wheat flour for all-purpose and agave instead of honey. They still turned out great! I also substituted almond extract instead of vanilla and used dark cocoa just because these are what I prefer. We ate the brownies warm, the hubster loved them too."
"1","5","My 12 year old made these and the batter was very sweet but then the frosting wasn't as sweet so it evened out! Now she makes them every month! :)"
"1","5","I made these last week. It was my first time making brownies from scratch (I'm moving away from box mixes) and besides being really easy to make, there were amazing! I made them for some friends and they were gone within seconds! I got great reviews so I pass them off to you!! great recipe!!"
"1","5","Delisth!!! I will use this recipe from now on. I doubled the batch and used 1 egg more (3 total)and it was perfect!"
"1","5","these brownies came out yummy. They were moist and easy to make. I will use and recommend this recipe."
"1","5","I love this brownie! It always turns out, crunchy on the outside, moist on the interior. It's almost like a brownie 'cake' but it isn't. It isn't a brownie 'fudge' either. When doubling the recipe use 3 eggs not 4, or it becomes too sticky."
"1","5","I made these in a 9x9 pan (greased, floured and bottom lined with parchment) and baked them in my convection oven for 15 minutes. The came out very thin due to the 9x9 pan size. I frosted them after they cooled. The frosting recipe needs liquid added otherwise it won't spread; I added 1-2T heavy cream. (Next time i may sub corn syrup for honey in the frosting). These brownies made a perfect substrate for brownies a la mode. The kids loved them. Will make them again. I may make 1.5 recipes for my 9x9 pan to get a thicker brownie."
"1","5","These are great! We even made the mistake of putting this in a 9X 13 without increasing the recipe, and even though they turned out terribly thin, they are still amazing!! 2 things to consider... we used real butter (salted) for the brownie mix, and room temperature tub margarine for the frosting. The frosting whipped up smooth and had the consistency of frosting the entire time. We put it on straight out of the oven, and it 'melted' evenly over the brownies."
"1","5","These turned out great! I doubled the recipe except for the eggs and salt. I kept the salt at 1/4 tsp and only added 1 additional egg (3 eggs total). I don't like frosted brownies so I left out the frosting. I've made these using butter and margarine. Using butter resulted in a more fudgelike brownie and with margarine it was more cakey. Both were delicious! It's just a matter of your brownie preference. I also used the microwave to melt the butter instead of stovetop. I mixed the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla. Combined dry ingredients then added them to butter mixture. Lastly, I added the lightly beaten eggs to the mixture. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes in a glass 8x11 pan sprayed with butter cooking spray. Super easy and so good!"
"1","5","This is it! This is the recipe! I've tried Brooke's Bombshell Brownies and the Quick and Easy Brownies on this site, and none of them have produced a fudgy gooey brownie like Best Brownies. I followed the recipe exactly, although I replaced the vanilla extract with maple syrup because I just ran out of vanilla this morning. I also cut back the salt to about 1/8 t. because I was using salted butter, and I didn't want it to be too much. Other than that, everything was the same. I used an 8x11 glass pan, and they cooked for about 27 minutes. The end result was delicious! I did not make the frosting because I've never really been a 'frosted brownie' type of person. I thought these were great and didn't need it, but I did do a nice sprinkling of powdered sugar over top. Great recipe!"
"1","5","Excellent! I doubled the recipe but only used three eggs and the brownies came out chewy. No more boxed brownies for this family."
"1","5","Excellent chewy, crunchy-edged brownies. Even without the frosting they are great."
"1","5","Great brownies! Haven't tried the frosting yet because I use a another brownie frosting recipe also on allrecipes.com."
"1","5","Easy and tastes great. Only change I made was to use butter and cocoa powder to prepare the pan."
"1","4","First of all I thank the submitter~ This recipe is perfect doubled, with 1 egg less than it says to use in the recipe. I made these the night before my event, and in the morning they were still perfect. Everyone who tried one said they were good! Make sure you don't overmix it. These do not turn out like cake squares if made properly."
"1","5","these brownies are moist and crunchy on the outside!!!!!!!!!! yummy!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","Very nice. I did not add the frosting and they were great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Excellent basic brownies. Did not change anything; however, I did add pecans. Just good ole, good eating, basic brownies. Frosting is not needed. Basic!"
"1","5","I baked only the brownie part without the frosting and they were delicious. Unlike a lot of other brownie recipes that turn out a cakey product, this recipe produces brownies that is gooey and fudgy like the box mixes. Next time I will try with the frosting."
"1","4","This was a mix of a cake-fudge brownie, and it was superb. I doubled the recipe and used around 1 1/4 cup of sugar for the double. I also added more butter than needed at the end because it seemed too dry- this wasn't a big deal, I just baked it a bit longer. Adding more butter did make me feel a bit nauseous though, and made it more oiler. I also added two tablespoons of milk at the end because of the dryness, turned out well!"
"1","5","These turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly along with some of the tips mentioned by at least one other reviewer: slightly beat the eggs before adding and only stirred everything until just barely combined."
"1","5","I have used this recipe apx. 100 times over the last several years. I don't even try other brownie recipes. I nuke the butter in a rubber bowl and add the other ingredients. The brownies are so good I don't bother with frosting them. I printed this out and the card is warped, stained and floppy from using it so many times."
"1","5","I love this recipe! Since I do not like making cake pops with cake, I use this instead as suggested by one of my class mates at school. She was absolutely right, brownie pops are way better! I do not need to add any frosting since they are moist enough. :)"
"1","4","The brownies turned out very well but the frosting wasn't creamy enough to spread on top of the brownies."
"1","5","I can't vouch for the brownies...I just made the frosting and put it on some brownies I made from a box (*gasp*). Still, the result was just what I was hoping for. Fudge-like frosted brownies. I'm a happy girl!"
"1","3","Perfect brownies but bad frosting !  The brownies themselves are delicious ! They turn out perfect. Nice and crusty on top and nice and gooey on the inside. I followed the recipe exactly and beat it by hand not in an electric beater. Also the baking time is important. Mine was perfect on 30 mins.  However the icing was a huge disappointment. Overly sweet and also the honey added a strange flavor. I chose not to use it."
"1","5","These really are the best brownies."
"1","5","I am in love.... these brownies came out perfect! My 2 kids have 3 friends over, and so I had to whip something up quick. The pan lasted about 5 minutes. I will definitely make these again. Maybe tomorrow."
"1","1","READ!!! These brownies, no matter how you mix them are only cake bars. I mean that sincerely. It does NOT matter how you mix the egg (which I barely mixed it, and used only a fork), because they are EXACTLY like squared cupcakes. This is NOT a brownie. Anyone who reviews this recipe and says it's wonderful IS NOT A SEASONED COOK!!!! Don't waste your time with this one! I mean it! You will only return to write a scathing review!  Again, THESE ARE CAKE BROWNIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","I have prepared this for two times and without frosting, once the same recipe and second time double of it. My advice is to use only a pinch of salt even with double since 1/4 teaspoon gets too much .Both times these turned out great. m..m..mm..yummy. Thanks Angie for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","Great brownies. Quick to throw together. Didn't use the frosting. It is not necessary. If you are a dark chocolate lover, these are also fantastic using dark chocolate cocoa, and adding 1/3 cup of dark chocolate chips in with the flour."
"1","5","These absolutely are the best brownies. I can't cook, I'm not domesticated and they still turn out perfectly. Everyone loves them. I'm not sure what the folks giving the negative ratings did but I've made these several times and they are always great, fast and easy. Just a few ingredients. Tonight I'm going to try them adding maple, walnuts and bacon crumbles with course sea-salt. I already know they are going to turn out fantastic for a nice treat with coffee after a long exhausting day."
"1","5","An easy, tasty, basic brownie recipe. I haven't made the frosting, but I've made the basic brownie multiple times and it's always great."
"1","3","Not 'best' I have had."
"1","4","These were good, I still prefer the box for some reason. These were not that sweet, and needed the frosting. Very moist and good texture. Easy."
"1","3","Not impressed - the brownies tasted rich and chocolatey - I used dark cocoa powder. However, these were cake-like, despite my blending by hand (as some users recommend). I was looking for a fudgy, dense bar."
"1","4","good but I over baked will have to try again. use min bake times x"
"1","1","I read a lot of bad reviews saying this recipe is 'cakelike', but because of the many good reviews, I tried it. I took the risk, and did what most of the good reviews advised: do not overbeat. So I was very careful, hardly mixed it. I used a wooden spoon, not electric mixer. But it still turned out to be cakelike. I told myself maybe I overbeat it, so I tried making it again, I was very careful, mixed all the wet first, and then the dry, and then mixed the two with a wooden spoon. Less mixing this time, but still turned out to be cakelike."
"1","4","This is not my favorite brownie recipe. Brooke's Best Brownies gets that honor. However, when there is no chocolate chips in the house, this recipe will do."
"1","5","I've made these brownies over and over and over. Everyone asks for the recipe. I've found out I can tweak it several different ways and they still turn out great. I've even made them in a TOASTER OVEN! I use an 8 ounce jar of marshmallow cream and an 8 ounce package of cream cheese mixed for frosting them, just sofenten cream cheese and mix in the marshmallow cream. Thank you for a great base brownie recipe!"
"1","5","AH-mazing!!! No need for frosting!"
"1","5","I really liked these. I think that the frosting is a must here! I am allergic to dairy so I used butter flavored margarine and under cooked them slightly to give them a more fudgey consistency. I made the frosting over a low flame with 2/3 cup of powdered sugar and 3 heaping TBSP of cocoa powder and it wasn't too sweet. I poured it over the warm brownies and it set pretty solid though still a bit soft. Having a dairy allergy its hard to get good chocolate but I would totally make these again."
"1","5","These were so good and easy. Minimal ingredients that I always have around the house too."
"1","5","I serve without the icing and I still get compliments"
"1","5","Yum! I didn't even need the frosting. This is the first 'from scratch' brownie I've actually enjoyed. As another reviewer mentioned, if you want them fudgy, don't over-beat the flour or eggs."
"1","4","These are very fudgy and delicious. The cocoa flavor is very strong and it is a lot less sweet and traditional chocolately tasting than boxed brownie mixes. Different, but in a good way. I added chocolate chips on top of the frosting while the brownies were still hot and then sprinkled powdered sugar on top of that. Super yummy!!"
"1","5","The best brownies I ever ate!! Thanks for sharing!!"
"1","5","I doubled the brownie recipe because we had a party, and EVERYONE came to thank me and compliment them. Thank you!"
"1","5","This is my new go-to brownie recipe! I've never made the fudge topping, but they are delicious without. (Try topping them with fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream.) I never knew it was so easy to make brownies from scratch. I will never use a mix again. These are seriously just as easy as a mix, taste way better, and don't have the pesky trans fats that most mixes have. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","This is the only brownie recipe I will use. I've been following this recipe for about 5 years now and they always turn out great. I don't use the frosting but I add chocolate chips and they are fantastic. I can't have dairy so we use a vegan butter and no one can tell the difference. These are the best brownies!"
"1","5","Just made these and they came out great!!! I added a bit of milk to loosen frosting and added pecans. Will make this again."
"1","5","I didn't have a box of brownie mix in the cupboard but had a craving that needed to be fixed. These were AWESOME and so easy to make! Will def. come back to this one. Thanks!!"
"1","4","Definitely more like dense chocolate cake than a brownie. It was still delicious!"
"1","5","i found that this recipe is REALLY easy to follow even for beginners like me :) the amount of sugar is just perfect so i decided not to make the frosting. The key not to get the cake-like brownie is just DON'T overbeat. just stir the flour until mixed then immediately transfer to your baking pan. Oh, and i didn't have any 8x8 inch baking pan so i use 9x9 instead, i baked them for about 15 minutes and it comes out great! a bit too thin tho :p"
"1","5","Fantastic! Incredibly easy to make and they come out beautifully. This is the only brownie recipe I will use from now on."
"1","5","I multiplied the recipe by 4 to make half a sheet pan batch of brownies. I only tripled the frosting and it was plenty. Next time I will only double the frosting recipe. I heated the froating on the stove and added a little milk to thin it out so I could just pour it on. Oh.. and I baked the brownies for exactly 25 mintues...turned out great. Will never use a box mix again."
"1","3","Definitely easy and quick to make, but I like a more moist and chewy brownie. This recipe comes out cake-like. And I made it twice to make sure I didn't make a mistake the first time. Still tasty, but not planning to make it again."
"1","5","The best chocolate fix...ever."
"1","3","Great right out of the oven, but if you refrigerate them, they remind me of a piece of fudge, and not brownie-like. I see these have a lot of great reviews, so maybe it was just me!"
"1","4","I baked it for 20 minutes and I think it was still too dry and cookie-like. I would suggest to bake it for only 15 minutes and leave it in the pan to cool for a while. I always underbake treats because I like them very moist, and it always works very well. I also always cut down sugar in half in all baking recipes, this time it worked well too, my boyfriend who has a sweet tooth didn't complain!!   This is very chocolatie and the frosting was AWESOME. I read some reviews to melt the frosting, that should really be included in the recipe. For frosting I put all the ingredients into a bowl and microwaved them to melt the butter and make it warm enough to melt most of the sugar, the frosting will become very creamy and easy to pour on the brownie."
"1","3","I doubled the batter recipe, as I used a 9X13 glass pan. I didn't double the frosting recipe, however, because I'm not a huge fan of it in the first place.   Anyway, the frosting--I omitted the honey, btw--was impossible to spread. I understand that others who made the it exactly as the recipe states (with honey) also had issues with spreading the frosting, so I think there's a fundamental flaw in the original recipe. Maybe a little more butter + a little more honey will make it spread better?   As far as the actual brownie goes, I just had one warm from the pan. It was meh, honestly. Maybe they'll be better once they've cooled overnight."
"1","5","Amazing best brownies i ever had and I am serious.Sorry grandma My 12 YO daughter made them at first I thought she made a mistake with the frosting but after we spread it on the hot brownies it turned into a creamy picture perfect frosting."
"1","5","Definately a keeper. I'll never buy a box brand again. 5 star all the way!!"
"1","1","best brownies...NOT! not moist enought & frosting impossible to spread. I would have been better off using a mix!"
"1","5","Made the best brownie bites ever! Will never buy boxed brownie mix again. Didn't change a thing except didn't add the frosting."
"1","5","Wow! Super easy, super thick, super chocolaty, super awesome!"
"1","3","Icing was delicious, but the brownies were greasy on the bottom and disappointing. Will keep the icing recipe though!"
"1","5","Great brownies! I didn't like the frosting recipe, but the brownies themselves were very good."
"1","5","if i could, i would give these a 7 star rating! The icing was really thick and fondanty. We added some chocolate chips though and it tasted FABULOUSLY EPIC SUPER CHOCO FANTASTIC BUNDLE O JOY. Great recipie. I would leave it at that but just like an infomercial, THERES MORE! we ate the whole #$%^&*! pan! Bestestest recipie eva!!! love it!!!!! couldnt get better!!!Thank you to whoever posted this!!!!! I love u!!!!  Jeannie and leah :D"
"1","5","This is my permanent brownie recipe after trying it. Absolutely the best brownies I've ever had. I'm thinking about making up the dry ingredients into a mix to have on hand when my daughter likes to make brownies."
"1","5","5 stars for the brownies and 3 stars for the frosting. I took these brownies to a family potluck today and they received rave reviews! To make the frosting work, I only used 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar and added a Tablespoon or two of milk to thin it. It spreads to a thin glaze when you frost brownies right out of the oven. And they cut perfectly as mentioned in other reviews after they cool!"
"1","5","Delicious!"
"1","4","the brownie it self was very good every one liked it a lot but the icing was to much it was like eating sugar so if u try this i would say try using another icing or use half the sugar it was just way to much"
"1","5","This turned out amazing! I used 3/4 cup sugar, and about half of the cocoa was Hershey's special dark and half was regular cocoa. I just used the microwave to soften the butter, which was easy. Also, I used a mini muffin pan and cooked them for 13 minutes at 350. They made the perfect brownie bites! I served them plain with a ganache on the side. Thank you Angie!"
"1","1","didnt like them as they cool they got hard on to the next one til i find the rite one i guess"
"1","5","If I could i would give this recipe more stars! It was amazing. It was so moist and cut perfectly! There was not a single crumb that stuck to the knife. The frosting was great, but the brownies probablly would have tasted good without it. I wouldn't make any subsitutes except halfing the powdered sugar in the frosting. I took the advice from some other people and even with half the amount, it's still really sweet."
"1","3","The flavor is good, but the brownies came out very cakey."
"1","5","It`s good with Dutch cocoa. Faith (9) Becky (36)"
"1","5","I didn't follow this recipe exactly because of other reviews I read saying they were too cake like. I like my brownies super fudgy...instead of butter, use vegetable oil, and instead of baking powder use about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of baking soda. this won't cause the batter to rise as much and won't become as fluffy. doing both of these will make them more dense and rich. another thing i found was that the sugar granules didn't really dissolve so well even after the brownies finished baking. to fix this, add just enough boiling water to the sugar to help dissolve it before hand."
"1","5","These were incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious! I have to admit that they were even tastier the next day."
"1","5","Who knew homemade brownies were so easy!! I opted not to make the frosting, but to simple sprinkle with powdered sugar. Perfect!"
"1","5","These were excellent and very much in between cake and fudge. We left the icing off because it would be too sweet for our family. I also listened to the other reviews and did not use a mix-master, instead we used a wisk being very careful to not over beat. I think this is the key!"
"1","5","These really were very good brownies. i've tried a number of brownie recipes and have always been disappointed. These are plenty chewy, not very cakey and um um good."
"1","5","I generally do not review the recipes I use, but this was quick easy and delicious!! Perfect for kids to help. fudgey and soft."
"1","4","Yummy but I think I'll use less sugar next time. I like more of the cocoa flavour. :)"
"1","5","Super simple and super fudgy, this will be my go-to brownie recipe...no more box mixes for me!"
"1","3","They weren't horrible, but they aren't great. Too sweet and the texture was off. I made them twice thinking it was me...it's not."
"1","4","Simply delicious and full of cocoa flavor! Just yummy!"
"1","5","Too bad we can't rate something more than 5 stars. These are truly the best brownies. I made them exactly as they were written. I mixed the ingredients by hand and not with the mixer. As another reviewer suggested that made the difference with consistency. They were more like a brownie not a cake like brownies are sometimes. I took these to work and they actually applauded me for bringing the brownies. I will make these and take them to work whenever I need a morale booster. Thanks Angie. This is a keeper."
"1","5","I made these without the topping. They were so thick, almost like fudge. Very rich, just the way I like them! Yummmmmmmm......."
"1","5","Not only are these brownies very easy to make but also taste DELICIOUS!!! My husband and kids love them and ask for them often. I usually let the brownies sit for about 30 minutes before placing the icing on them. I let the icing sit on brownies before I try to spread. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe...I not only have it saved in my recipe box but also printed multiple times."
"1","5","I love these brownies. I have made several times and they turn out different every time. Sometimes they crumble and sometimes they hold together very well. Maybe it's the weather here in Florida. Regardless the flavor is beyond comparison. This is the only homemade brownie recipe that has worked for me. Thanks for sharing."
"1","4","Really good, but they're pretty much like cake. The second time I made them, I added some vegetable oil and that seemed to help. Still really delicious!"
"1","5","I thought this recipe was really good! I didn't follow it exactly, though, as I was out of butter so I used Crisco instead. But the brownies turned out nice and soft and my husband loved them :)"
"1","5","Instead of the frosting, try drizzling caramel syrup over it right out of the oven. It melts into them and is SO delicious!!!"
"1","5","Okay.. Im giving these 5 stars not because I loved them, but because every one else did. Im not a chocolate lover, but i've always loved brownies. these were very chocolaty. They are not chewy, but they are very dense not cake like although some people seem to think so-they are far to dense to be anything like cake, but they are not chewy.. but every one loved them, they are chocolate lovers. I would suggest reducing the cocoa if your like me because they are super rich.. almpst like fudge."
"1","5","This is a great, delicious, fast, and easy recipe. I have made this many times and it always turned out great. I did not make any alterations, although I didn't use the icing, and it turned out delicious. The first few times I made this, I doubled the recipe and it worked well. Recently, I made a single batch and made waffles with it. Grease a waffle iron and add the brownie batter as you would with waffle batter and leave it in until it is cooked to your liking. I personally like mine a little gooey-er. This is the an awesome recipe."
"1","5","Very tasty and moist! Tip with the frosting: you must melt the butter, and I also added milk to thin it out. Really good flavor."
"1","5","OMG So good. Everyone I make them for loves them too! Thank you for sharing!"
"1","5","Seriously, so easy, so fast w/o that funny twang flavor from box brownies. I like how the recipe called for coco powder because I never have unsweetened chocolate squares on hand and always end up converting the recipe to make coco work. I'm glad I didn't have to do that."
"1","5","Doubled and baked in a 'no middles' brownie pan. Didn't do icing, but it was delicious!"
"1","2","I really did not care for these brownies. Am surprised and disappointed they did not turn out better, given all the great reviews."
"1","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever done and they always turn out fantastic! Big hit with all the kids in the neighbourhood (including my own!) So much so, that everytime the neighbourhood kids see me @ the school or parks , they ask for 'Bbbbrooowwwnies??!!'lol"
"1","5","I've been making these for a couple of years now. They really are the best brownies I've ever eaten. I've never prepared them with the icing. Instead I've added approx. 1/3 cup of mini-marshmallows and 1/3 sup of chocolate chips. My kids love them."
"1","5","You should add the word EVER to 'Best Brownies'. I have been trying all kinds of recipes and been very disappointed with other brownie recipes. These are now the only brownies that will ever be made in our home. I did use my own frosting recipe though, but still one outstanding brownie. Will be doubling the recipe next time for sure!"
"1","1","This is a bland chocolate cake recipe. I love brownies. Unfortunately, the box store bought brownies really do taste better."
"1","5","These brownies are rich and chewy. Best brownies I have ever made, and very easy to make too!"
"1","5","I made these brownies one day, they were DELICIOUS. There were two left I was saving for my other siblings and my brother kept asking for them cause they were so good :P I give it 5 stars no doubt :)"
"1","5","Yum!"
"1","5","these brownies were the best I have ever had. they are like little debbies but better. I used dark cocoa and added coconut and chocolate chips but would have still been great without them."
"1","5","FABULOUS! Rich, fudgey, and chocolatey ~ what more can I say? We're a family of health nuts, yet, between the four of us, there are only 9 more brownies left in the pan, and they just came out of the oven fifteen minutes ago!  I followed the brownie recipe to a T, but after reading some of the reviews, I felt there were too many problems with the icing, so I went online and found another recipe for the chocolate glaze: Melt 2 tbsp of butter, and combine with 2 tbsp of cocoa powder, half a cup of icing sugar, and 1 tbsp of milk. It was PERFECT on the brownies. My only complaint? These brownies completely destroyed my diet; still, they were worth it. I was going to try other brownie recipes after this, but now I'm not so sure......Let's see if these brownies pass the time test (if there's any left by tomorrow)...."
"1","5","I made these at 1am, didnt use a blender, and frosted them with nutella. By noon, they were gone."
"1","4","These brownies were awesome & super simple! I did have to add 2 Tbsp of milk to the frosting to get a smooth consistency. Thank you!"
"1","3","The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and everyone loved them. I however hated them, they weren't chewy and reminded me very much of a cake. Not the recipe for you of you like a fudgy"
"1","4","These were fantastic! I will say I was a bit disappointed that they were crumbly on the bottom but that won't keep me from making them again. I will likely use less sugar, some applesauce & a bit more flour next go round. Also, I only used 2/3 c confectioners sugar for the icing and that was plenty, though I did need to add water. I also made my batch with white chocolate chips for an extra touch."
"1","5","These were amazing! By far that best brownies I have ever had. I do not think the frosting is necessary. They are perfect!"
"1","5","These are fudgy and delicious! I used 1/4 cup less white sugar in the batter as well as in the frosting (just to make myself feel better :) and I substituted  2TBP of applesauce for the same amount of butter just to cut the fat a little. Really yummy!"
"1","5","Out-Awesome-Standing. I whipped these up in less than 15 minutes. Baked them at about 325º F (because I'm in California). I loved the outcome. I added a 1/2 cup of walnuts. Thanks for a new family regular and favorite."
"1","5","WOW this was really good! I made this with the Philidelphia cream cheese brownie recipe and it was delicious! flaky on the outside, chewy on the inside!! :D"
"1","5","Are whole family loved the brownies. We did make the frosting but decided not to use it. The was to sweet for out taste, and the browned was excellent on its own. I beat the eggs before adding to the dry ingredients, then gently folded batter until uniformly moist (*instead of beating). There were were still small lumps in the batter when I poured it in the pan. This produced a typically chewy(delicious) brownie. If you do like cake like brownies, then follow the directions to beat."
"1","5","Oh my goodness!!! Wonderful!!! Perfect and easy! I used organic ingredients and may try to replace the sugar with maple syrup next time. Thanks!!!"
"1","3","For coco powder I used OVALTINE, and it baked nice and even. When I took it out to spread on the icing, everything looked really OILY. It says to spread it on while the brownies are still hot, but when I did this, it melted the ingrediants apart. My dad took one when it was still fresh from the oven and got greese all over his hands! I was so embarassed, but I followed the recipe EXACTLY. HOWEVER!!! After a couple days of it being in the refrigerator, my mother discovered them and had a few. She said they were delicious and caramel flavored. It didn't seem to have the greesy/oily look or feel anymore because of the cool, and apparently was very chewy. This definitely COULD be a mistake on my part, because I must have skimmed over a place that said to keep it cool. But if not, I'm glad I did. Overall, it was an okay recipe. Nice and basic for people who haven't made brownies before."
"1","5","Best brownies I've had in a long time. Thanks!"
"1","5","I would give more stars if I could....I also will not go back to box brownies. Simple easy to make...My family loves them!!!"
"1","3","I find these a little bit too 'greasy' tasting ... not my favorite brownie recipe. It's a little reminiscent of Texas sheet cake, but not as good."
"1","5","love these brownies they are the BEST!!!! and always come out really good and to the haters who are negative about these brownies.....well guess they cant bake"
"1","2","disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly for the first try. These did not come out fudgey but more like cake. They were 'ok'."
"1","1","These dry cakey brownies that require frosting to be edible are not appealing to me."
"1","4","I have to revise my review. Initially I said they were too cake like. I must have eaten them too quickly because my husband ate them the next day and said they were really good and chewy."
"1","5","I have no idea why people are saying these brownies are awful. I have made them twice and and they are WONDERFUL! They are soft, but chewy. Chocolaty and sweet.  The only thing I did different was for the frosting. I melted the butter which in turn melted the honey and added about 2 tablespoons of half and half for pourablitiy/spreadablitiy. Yes, frost these when they come out of the oven. The frosting will level out and have a wonderful glaze when they are cooled."
"1","5","I have never made home made brownies before and I brought these to a party. They were a hit! These brownies are down the middle between super chewy and cake brownies. The icing was sweet but delicious but I did not use it all on the brownies as it would have been too much. They're excellent!"
"1","2","not the best brownies to me! Their redeeming quality was the delicious fudgey topping which I altered according to other reviewers suggestions. Everyone who tried them agreed that they didn't taste bad, but they definitely were not great. I will continue my search for a delicious brownie recipe from scratch."
"1","5","No changes....FAST, EZ, EXCELLENT! Works in a muffin tin too. I only had 1 egg + 1 Tbsp mayo. Worked perfectly. YIELD 9 small brownies in a muffin tin. No need for frosting."
"1","5","Whoever says these are 'cake like' brownies is very mistaken. However, I went with other reviewers and didn't beat the batter, only stirred by hand. They were the most moist, fudge like brownies I've ever had! No frosting needed!"
"1","5","This is an easy and delicous tasting recipe! My 6 year old daughter insisted we do a review. We did make some changes as we only put half the sugar as we put in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. We put them in tiny muffin tins however we overcooked them slightly. They still taste great but next time we will cook them less. 'We loved it' -Tea (6years old)."
"1","5","Didn't make the frosting this time around but thought these brownies had a great texture and were very easy to make. mine cooked in about 20-23 minutes so check early"
"1","5","pretty darn good. was looking for a recipe that included butter and cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate. didn't make icing but used a mini muffin pan to make bite brownies :)"
"1","3","The brownies would have been delicious without the frosting, but unfortunately I frosted all of them and them and then wished I could take it back. All I could taste in the frosting was the honey and I just didn't think the honey and chocolate mixed well. I would definitely make the brownie recipe again, but never the frosting."
"1","5","This rating is for the actual brownies only. Putting frosting on brownies is ridiculous.  This is my favorite brownie recipe ever! They taste 300X better the next day. Right out of the oven they are about a 3 star brownie. I like how they are chewy and not like fudge or cake. I don't think this recipe would make 16 servings, more like 8. It is hard to spread in the pan since there is not much batter to fill the pan, but they always turn out well."
"1","5","I love the fact that this recipe calls for cocoa powder instead of bar chocolate. I was very careful not to stir too much, but I would say that, while fudgy, they are not quite as dense as the ideal brownie. Fortunately, no one had to listen to me complain because I was too busy stuffing my face. I like to use a little extra cocoa powder and serve this with ice cream, no frosting. Thank you for a great recipe!"
"1","5","These really are the best brownies."
"1","5","These brownies have been amazing every time I've made them!"
"1","5","Followed the instructions exactly, and they turned out very tasty. Great recipe!"
"1","5","These Brownies were perfect! I followed the recipe exactly I added a small amount of instant coffee. I left the frosting off they didnt need it. They came out dense,& moist exactly how a brownie should be. They were not 'cakey' at all.....The most important thing to remeber is do not over mix your batter...to much air incorperated into the eggs will cause your brownies to be 'cakey'."
"1","5","I made exactly as-is with the exception of adding some chocolate and white chocolate chips before baking, and wow. Really good brownies, almost more like fudge than brownies...melted in your mouth. Very sweet of course but that's fine!!"
"1","5","My new go-to brownie recipe! I just added some semi-sweet chocolate chunks and they were perfect! Very rich, so you only need a little! I love fudgy brownies so I made sure to follow the advice to not overmix. Also decorated the tops with my own mocha icing:   3/4 Cup of confectioners sugar  1/4 Cup cocoa powder  2 tsp instant coffee granules  1 tsp vanilla extract  1 TBSP butter, softened to room temperature  1 TBSP milk Mix very well and pipe on using a small tip. Makes more than enough to decorate an 8x8, would be enough for a double batch!"
"1","5","I've been reserved about using recipes for brownies because I haven't had the same results you get from mixes but this one is great. Just the right chewy."
"1","5","These were a really good rich brownie. I did not use the honey and just added milk to thin out. Will make again!"
"1","5","This is great recipe for a regular brownie that is moist and not dry.Also,the icing is great!"
"1","5","These brownies were the best. I didn't put icing on them because of calories. They didn't need icing. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Angie."
"1","5","This is the only recipe I use anymore. It's great and uses ingredients that I usually have on hand."
"1","5","Delicious! Doubled it and put into a 9x13-inch baking pan. Skipped the icing. My favorite brownie recipe!"
"1","4","yummm"
"1","1","Favor(less) and kinda dry something was missing. Really donno why it has such good reviews."
"1","4","They are a good brownie; although a cakey brownie rather than a fudgey one, I prefer a fudgey, chewy brownie, but if a cakey brownie is your preference these are for you. p.s. especially appreciate the hint of honey you get in the frosting, and that what is going on my brownie's in the future even if the brownie itself is changing."
"1","5","Fantastic! And super quick! Great chocolate flavor, perfect for that chocolate craving that you need to fix 'right now'! Thanks for the great recipe, Im pretty sure I'll never need another one for brownies again!"
"1","5","My father isn't a big chocolate eater, but he loved these!"
"1","5","I don't typically write reviews, but these were fantastic!!! Didn't change a thing (except that I used raw sugar and whole wheat flour) in the recipe and they were marvelous. The whole family gobbled them up and I never even got a chance to frost them!"
"1","4","I don't like chocolate, so I don't have much to offer- but it was easy to make, looks nice, and the kids said they're great! One said it's like a chocolate explosion."
"1","5","YUMMY ! I doubled the recipe exactly as written, put it in my large heart-shaped pan for Valentine's Day (baked an extra 6-7 mins), used my own favourite icing recipe and it was PERFECT ! They are chewy, chocolatey and my new favourite brownie recipe. Thanks for posting."
"1","5","These are very good! They don't taste like a box mix, but they are quite tasty."
"1","4","I love frosting but found it unnecessary as these are delicious and sweet enough on their own!"
"1","5","This was absolutely delish, the only thing i changed was to use 1/2 cup slenda brown sugar mix instead of sugar. I hand mixed all of it and the texture was perfect. Next time I will double it."
"1","5","These are the best brownies ever. Period. Not sure how anyone got cakey squares with this recipe. I am the laziest cook ever - I throw everything into my cuisinart and whirl it together - no, I do not melt the butter. I usually make the icing first, so I don't have to wash it before I make the brownies - doesn't work the other way round. I use parchment paper to line the pan - did I mention I was lazy?"
"1","1","These were so bad. Followed the recipe to the letter and they were completely bland. Definitely not the best. I'm probably going to just throw them out they're so awful."
"1","5","Really good Brownie. Made it with the kids. Kind of a cake fudge hybrid."
"1","5","DELICIOUS! These brownies were super rich, gooey, and and very chocolately! Perfect for when you need that chocolate fix. I should note that I used about 1 tablespoon of milk in replacement for the honey because I didn't have any honey on hand and it turned out great just make sure you give it time to cool so the frosting isn't soup it needs to thicken up. Overall very good brownie in texture and flavor I was very pleased and wasn't expecting such an easy and delicious recipe. (: Thanks!"
"1","2","My brownies started out looking phenomenal. The batter was amazing and I was excited to try them! When they came out of the oven, they were hard and gross looking. I cooked at the right temperature, and even less time than the recipe suggested. I was so disappointed. I'll have to try again some other time."
"1","5","I have made these many times and we LOVE them. However, I made the frosting for the first time last night and I'll never do that again. The frosting was just too sweet, making this perfect pan of brownies cloying. So what did I do? I threw the pan out and made another batch without frosting and now we're all happy again."
"1","2","Not cakey not fudgy, but something in-between, and not to my family's liking. I'm going to try something else next time. These lacked the intense chocolate flavor I was seeking, and wasn't soft and gooey, which is the texture I prefer. We ate it with ice cream, to give it more moisture. (no, I did NOT overbake!)"
"1","5","I made these to take to my parents house for the Super Bowl after I tried to make box brownies and exploded the bag of mix all over the kitchen, they were very easy to make and are so good! I was so nervous that they wouldn't turn out because I've never made brownies from scratch, but my dad tried them and told me not to tell my mom, but these brownies are much better than the ones she makes from scratch! The frosting was a different consistency and hard to spread at first, but I put it in the microwave to warm it up and it spread much better. I'll never buy box brownie mix again after making these!"
"1","4","Very tasty but very cake-like. I'd like them to be more chewy and fudgey."
"1","5","These are the best brownies and I didn't even ice them!"
"1","5","easy and delicious! I didn't add the frosting-it definitely didn't need it! I halved the recipes and put it in a loaf pan...I just didn't need 16 :P I cooked for 20 minutes and the texture was a bit crispy on top and rich and brownie-like underneath :) loved it! will definitely make again!"
"1","1","Im shocked....this is the first time that a high rated recipe was bad. They were cakelike and dry. We are all use to fudgy moist yummy brownies and these were just the opposite. My kids hated them and wont even use them at the bottom of there ice cream bowl. sorry!"
"1","5","these are really good! I didn't make the frosting, instead i chopped some 86% chocolate and folded it in. Yummy! Quick and easy, i will make these again and try the frosting next time."
"1","5","went together really fast. its a heavy brownie, fudgeish."
"1","5","I have been making these brownies for years and they're my go-to recipe every time. They're super quick and everyone seems to love them. The only thing I have changed is that I don't make the frosting, and instead I put some chopped chocolate in the dough before baking. I like milk chocolate such as Cadbury, but have used different types in the past."
"1","4","These brownies are a new favorite in my house. I make cakes all the time, but had never made 'from scratch' brownies. I don't like icing on my brownies, so I can't vouch for the icing, but just the plain brownies were awesome. I have made them twice, once with regular cocoa and once with dutch process. I liked the dutch process version better, but both were excellent. I also added walnuts to half of the batch. It's great with or without the nuts, but I personally prefer the nuts. My family prefers without nuts. I cooked mine for 27 minutes in a 9x13 pan (doubled recipe) and 26 minutes in an 8x8 pan (single recipe). Both batches were fudgey texture, not cakey."
"1","5","These were fudgey and super chocolatey! I doubled it and used the exact recipe. I had to at a touch of milk (or cream) to the icing to make is spread better and you HAVE to do it while the brownies are still warm. It will melt and when it cools down will be a nice rich dense frosting. You can't use a hand mixer to make these or the end up cakey, you MUST do it by hand and fold the ingredients. I also took them out of the oven before the cook time said so that they didn't over cook and they will continue to cook in the pan when you take them out. If the toothpick comes out clean, take them out, let them sit 5 minutes, frost while warm. The icing was the only thing that needed tweeking, as I didn't use all the icing sugar and used a touch of milk. Perfect! They don't last long either!"
"1","5","These truly are the best brownies. They came out so rich and fudgey. I will never make any other brownie recipe again!"
"1","5","These were great As I used a dark 8x8 pan I only baked them for 20 minutes and they came out just as good as our favorite mix! I had considered doubling the batch and baking in a 9x13 but decided after reading reviews of others that tried doubling it to stick with a single."
"1","1","So disappointed with this. Flavor was good, but consistency was dry and too cakey. I doubled the recipe. Could that be the problem or is my image of a good brownie too influenced by a chewy, moist Duncan Hines dessert??"
"1","4","I thought they were good. I really liked the frosting. I didn't have honey so I used Lyle's Golden Syrup in its place. Also it seemed dry so I added a tiny bit of whipping cream just to moisten it up."
"1","5","Absolutely Delicious. I added some semi sweet chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. Baked to perfection in 25 min. Awesome recipe."
"1","5","These brownies are absolutley perfect! at first I was hesitant because of all the sugar, but they really are good. The only thing I will add is that I added 1 tablespoon of milk and another pinch of coco powder because the frosting was VERY thick. Other than that, they were wonderful!"
"1","4","I really liked the simplicity of this recipe and the flavor is excellent but the texture of these brownies left a little to be desired - not really dense and chewy, but light and moist. If you like a cake-like brownie these are the way to go. Didn't frost them which might have helped but enjoyed the quick, easy recipe and delicious flavor. The batter seemed kind of skimpy, but the end result was very generous. Give them a try - much better than anything from the box!"
"1","4","These brownies were delicious! I was looking for a brownie recipe to make rum balls so that I didn't have to use boxed brownie mix and they were delicious! I ate about 1/3 of the brownie before I could make them into rum balls! I even made a mistake and left out the vanilla and they still were delicious!"
"1","5","I have been meaning to try this recipe for several years, but hadn't gotten around to it. I don't make brownies often but needed some for a bake sale. I have read through probably 1,000 reviews paying close attention to those that were lower than 3 stars.  These came out perfectly for me; satiny top and chewy around the edges, a bit fudgier in the middle, just the way I like them. I did not frost them because a really good brownie never needs frosting, but that is my opinion.  I think a lot of the bad reviews must be because of how we each like our brownies. What is chewy to me could be cakeish to someone else perhaps, not sure. I do know a few things though, how you mix brownies makes all the difference in the world. I melt my butter and then remove it from the heat while I mix the dry ingredients thoroughly and beat the eggs. Then I stir in the sugar, eggs and vanilla and blend well. Next I add the dry ingredients at once and stir to mix. There probably will be a few small lumps, like uncooked popcorn kernel size and that's okay. Just make sure all the batter is moistened. If you 'beat' it too much it will rise more and there is where your 'cake' type brownie comes from. Just use a good old fashioned rubber spatula or wooden spoon, either works fine. It is a bit more complicate than a mix, but so much better."
"1","2","I think I overcooked these a little bit because I am pretty dissapointed. Added a little more sugar and cocoa to the mix and even after that, they came out a bit bland. Either I overcooked them or the best part of the brownies has to be the frosting(which I didn't make.) Probably won't try this again. It may have been a mistake on my part because I can see all the high ratings on this recipe. Anywho, I won't be making this again. Too bland and reminds me of the cheapy cheap cheap mix I've used before: poor quality, too cakey and flavorless. I don't mean to be so negative but if this was really that good of a recipe, overcooking them wouldn't ruin the batch. Trust a fat man over anyone else to tell you what tastes good and what doesn't. This doesn't."
"1","5","Entire family LOVED these! Best brownie recipe I have tried. I had no butter, so I substituted margarine and it worked wonderfully. Thanks :)"
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for years and it has NEVER failed me yet! If you sniff the air I have some in the oven right now. I made a batch last night...but my sons and their friends came by and need I say anymore? They are  the perfect brownie and many times I have bake them without the nuts and have never frosted them! Either way they are a show stopper. I love these and they are very easy to make. Did I mentioned I have to double the recipe? Try these and before you can say 'More brownies please>' - they are gone. I can't say how well they keep, because I never have any left. :)"
"1","5","I am just starting to bake and found this simple receipe in a pinch. I have read some of the reviews after I made these and agree these are more like a cake brownie than a fudge gooey brownie. I thought they were delicious. Made them as receipe called for and realized for a chocohalic they might not like, therefore I would. All in taste."
"1","5","These have a taste to rave about! My 12 year old made these herself. Easy, tasty, and we had all the ingredients on hand. Perfect!"
"1","5","These brownies came out awesome. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan and took about five minutes off the cooking time and the brownies came out perfect. They were fudgey in the center with a nice almost crisp exterior. It was a good contrast and an awesome texture and I served them over vanilla ice cream. My family loved them. I will be using this recipe now instead of any box recipe. Thank you!!!!"
"1","5","Everyone was impressed with these brownies, simply because they were DELICIOUS! My only problem with it was the frosting was really hard to make all frostingy. I had to add 2 tablespoons of milk! It was really really dry without it. Also, next time I make this I will put half a teaspoon vanilla extract because the flavor was too strong - ALSO I highly recommend sifting the powdered sugar before using it in the frosting mix! It came out too clumpy! And put it on the brownies while they are warm and not hot! Other than my alterations, a PERFECT brownie =)"
"1","5","Very easy...agree that this recipe can easily replace mixes, and delicious too. Made without the frosting to save on calories...try dusting with some icing sugar for pretty presentation."
"1","3","If made exactly as directed, these brownies will not turn out very well. The brownies are a little bitter without the icing, and the icing is hard as a rock and impossible to spread.   With a few modifications, however, these brownies are really good. If you add 2 T. of milk to the icing ingredients and mix the icing over low heat, then it will stay soft and spreadable. You can also add 1 T. of butter and 1/4 c. confectioner's sugar to the brownie ingredients to sweeten them up a bit.  Also, it only took 25 minutes in my over to cook the brownies. Any more would have burnt them.  Good luck!"
"1","5","These brownies are decadent. They are easy to make and come out of the pan easily, which is something I usually fight with brownies. The only thing I changed was to add a little milk to the frosting to thin it down to spread. I'm thinking if I had melted that butter also it would have made it thinner. All in all, a wonderful keeper of a recipe."
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. The brownies were *maybe* 1/2 an inch thick."
"1","5","Very good. I admit I usually make the boxed mix type, but I didn't have one and needed some chocolate so I decided to try out these. Wow, I was amazed at how simple and tasty these are. Will keep this recipe and make again soon! Next time might try with chocolate chips."
"1","5","Definitely the best brownies recipe!!!"
"1","4","I made just one modification since we're cutting down on sugar; substituted the sugar with 3/4 cup Agave Nectar (just remember to bake at a lower temp:330 degrees). They came out gooey, dense and delicicious! Will definitely make again!"
"1","4","I must have did something wrong. I made these twice and they didnt turn out. Im still rating this 4 stars because I really think it was me and not the recipe. I used coco that I have had for a while so it could be that it was old. I also used spelnda as Im a diabetic and cant have too much sugar so that could be too. I also read not to stir it too much well I sometimes get stir happy so that also could have been the problem. I really think it was me though and not the recipe. Oh, had problems with it riseing too, but again could have been my coco!"
"1","5","I'm not one for baking but decided to try these when I needed to make a desert with only what I had on hand. They are GREAT. I doubled the recipe and was glad I did as they were all eaten. I also cut the powdered sugar in half on the frosting and although I doubled the brownie mix, I made just one batch of the frosting and spread it on them while still pretty warm. At any rate, if you're a brownie fan you need to make these. As with the other reviews, I will not make brownies from a box again."
"1","5","AWESOME"
"1","2","These brownies were totally liquid after 25 minutes. I left them in for 5 minutes longer and that helped to solidify them. The middle was a lot lower than the edge. The frosting was so dry and clumpy so I added some butter. Maybe my high alititude played a part in this. I'm at 4,400 ft. The flavor was good, texture was way too wet."
"1","5","These are the best brownies"
"1","3","These brownings didn't turn out that good. They were a bit too powdry for me. The second time I substituted the Cocoa Powder with real milk chocolate and they turned out great!"
"1","5","These brownies turned out deliciously! We like chewy, soft brownies, and this recipe didn't disappoint! The frosting is nice and creamy, and it worked well to frost the brownies while they were still hot. This is a great -- and SIMPLE! -- recipe that we'd definitely recommend!"
"1","2","I'm ammending my review: I made them as is, and they're awful and cakey and have almost no flavor. I'll be looking elsewhere for brownies."
"1","5","im only 13 and this is just about the most easiest and delicious recipe ive made from allrecipes . Everyone in my family loved it. we even ran out cocoa powder. The only change i mad e was in the time i did 325 because my dad said everyone h different stoves."
"1","3","I wish I could've left a comment without rating the recipe, because I didn't make THIS recipe. I made the 'healthier' variation to this that some suggested. I respect personal tastes, but the version of this where sugar substitute is used, as well as apple sauce was... how can I put it... terrible! My kid wouldn't eat it, I took a bite and it tasted so bad that not even with a peanut butter and chocolate icing they were edible. I hid it from my husband in shame! Try this recipe with all its calories, I'm sure it's worth it. I, however, will stay away from the reduced calorie version from now on. I'd much rather reduce my portion size."
"1","5","These were delicious and dead easyto make. I didn't use any icing and people couldn't keep their hands off!"
"1","5","This recipe was AMAZING! I'm so glad I found it. I made 2 batches for school and everyone loved them! I changed up a few things when I made them after reading some of the reviews. For example I lightly beat the eggs before putting them in the mix and letting the butter cool down to not end up with scrambled eggs. :D I also melted the butter, put in 1/2 cup of powdered sugar (confectioners' sugar) instead of a whole cup and added an extra teaspoon of Cocoa Powder for the frosting.  Best brownies I've ever tasted and I will NEVER again make brownies from a box. Nothing like home-made :)"
"1","5","Love these brownies! I can finally make good homemade brownies that my kids and husband like. Just gooey enough to mimic the boxed kind but without all of the additional scary ingredients of boxed mixes. I followed the recipe exactly. I would recommend mixing the icing with a pastry cutter, worked great!"
"1","4","Very, very good!!! I modified and added a dash of cayenne pepper, and teaspoon of Grand Marnier!!!! Very moist, no need for icing!!!!"
"1","5","AWSOME!!!! I just made these a few hours ago for dessert after dinner and all i can say is YUMMY!! They were perfect, simple and easy and chocolatly! Mine came out a lil thick and chewy. I also added a all caramel milky way bar chopped up into the batter and also swirled caramel on top and it turned out GREAT!! Oh i also used regular cocoa powder, not unsweetened. Deff going to be making these all the time. Thanks!!"
"1","5","Sin...I have died and gone to heaven. These are like restaurant style brownie. Not cakeish. And the frosting was way too sweet so we added pinch of salt and warmed it in the oven after brownies we're out to spread it on brownie."
"1","5","Unbelievable, no really I can't believe it!!! I read review after review saying that they are the 'best brownie ever' so I figured I'd give 'em a try expecting to be slightly let down. Boy was I wrong! People aren't over exaggerating here... They actually are that good. I was WORRIED when I sampled the batter which tasted odd, not much like brownie batter at all. My worrying continued when I slid them out of the oven the top of the brownies had little air pockets everywhere... I thought great these are going to be a waste of time, then I took a bite... then I took another bite... and another and another!!! I didn't bother with the icing because, well simply put, I hate icing. But, while I was eating I was thinking as hard as I could 'have I ever had a better brownie' I think not! I have had equally as good, but not better :)"
"1","5","perfection"
"1","5","WOW!!! it turned out really, really good. I halved da amount of c.sugar used in da frosting (that was all what i had) and added about a 1/2 tbsp of water coz da frosting seemed too thick for me. It does seem a bit cakey. For those who think twice about this recipe >> 'Have NO fear to try this, cooooz ANEE has got it RIGHT' :D"
"1","5","Excellent - truly moist, delicious brownies. I didn't use the frosting. My family loves these!"
"1","1","I will not use this recipe again."
"1","2","Perhaps my cocoa was 'old' but I didn't find that these brownies had a lot of chocolate-y flavor. Also, they were probably, at the most, half an inch high."
"1","4","The brownies are ok, a bit cakey as others have commented. The frosting is awesome, however. I didn't have any honey so I substituted light corn syrup instead - it was superb!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe and super quick to make, this will definitely be my new go to brownie recipe!"
"1","5","I made this as directed... reducing the frosting or powdered sugar in it is missing the point! It's supposed to be a thick fudgy layer (as it's picture indicates) BUT make as you like, bottom line this is a delicious recipe :D"
"1","5","Rich!"
"1","4","Awesome brownies! I only gave it four stars because of the icing. It just didn't work out well - lumpy and weird. I should have read the reviews that said to add milk to it...I will try that next time!"
"1","5","Phenomenal. Simply phenomenal. Not only are these easy and quick to make, they taste 10x better than those from the box! DON'T overbake. Enjoy!"
"1","5","My daughter made this for Thanksgiving. They where yummy! She forgot to melt the butter etc. I was a little worried, the batter looked light and fluffy. Turned out great. I also forgot that I doubled the recipe and only made half the icing. No matter how we messed up they were the best brownies. After tasting one, we said these would be awesome with some choc chips added."
"1","3","Frosting doesn't work without milk"
"1","5","Thanx for the recipe Angie! The brownies were absolutely fantabulous! My dad (who's not always a fan of chocolatey stuff) loved them :D I'll be using this recipe always :)"
"1","5","By far the BEST brownies ever! Do I need to say more?"
"1","4","Just made these browines and they are great! I did have some problems with the frosting not mixing up so I just added a little milk and that made the forsting perfect...."
"1","5","woowwwwwww, it is the best..."
"1","5","AMAZING brownies!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I did 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white, and cooked for 23 minutes. They turned out perfectly. So simple and good! Thanks."
"1","5","Oh so yummy!"
"1","1","Wow...I can't believe so many people loved these. These brownies were fudgy, but nothing else about them was brownie-like at all. They were incredibly bland, and the texture was spongy and uniform from top to bottom and from the outside in--not at all what I'm used to in a brownie. No thin cracked shell on top, which I guess doesn't matter if you like the icing. I prefer a brownie that can stand on its own, and this one is definitely not it."
"1","5","These brownies were delicious! Fudgey and yummy..  HUGE TIP: One thing you HAVE to remember is to use half the confectioner's sugar for the frosting. Other wise, it turns out to this weird dough.   I was really pleased with this recipe. I sprinkled on some sprinkles like the picture shows, and it really adds a nice touch. :)"
"1","5","My husband has only given 5 stars to 4 things I have EVER made... these brownies were one of them. Advice followed: melt butter for frosting- use half of the powdered sugar. Wonderful. Thanks :)"
"1","5","I loved these brownies and so did my whole family. They are amazing. I followed a previous reviewers tip to not over beat and not over bake and it came out perfectly."
"1","5","I had no idea homemade brownies were so easy or so good!"
"1","5","perfect! Chewy edges, soft center, & Super easy to make! Family voted them the best!"
"1","5","This is my go-to recipe for brownies, and they always get rave reviews. Like many others, I do not make the icing, but I do sometimes add walnuts or chocolate chips."
"1","5","This were amazing I made them with gluten-free flour because my mom does not eat gluten and normally the flour gives it an odd taste but not these brownies. I also made them with almond extract instead one because I had run out of vanilla and did not have time to go to the store and they were still amazing."
"1","5","Love this recipe so tastey and easy to make I didn't make the icing because I didn't have powdered sugar but these were great just by themselves. Yum making these for my daughters school class. A recipe I'll make again and again."
"1","5","Yummy! They are easy to make and don't have the yucky aftertaste of a traditional box brownie. Also, I would recommend using unsalted butter for a better taste."
"1","5","This recipe is fantastic. Followed instructions exactly, except that as a previous person stated, I mixed by hand with a whisk instead of beating with a mixer and they turned out chewy and delicous!! YUM, will definitely add this one to my recipe box."
"1","5","I'm pretty sure that anybody complaining of cake-like brownies as opposed to the fudge consistency only mixed too much or cooked too long. I made these as directed and they were awesome. I am not a baker per se but my husband is a brownie connoissuer and these made the cut!!! This is now my go to for when he gets a 'hankerin' for brownies right at bedtime!!"
"1","4","Very Good!!!"
"1","5","These brownies are so yummy and choclatty. i used 2/3 of powdered sugar for the icing, since i read some ppl said icing was too sweet. and it was perfect. i also used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder, which worked out perfect, not too sweet, just right. its as easy to make as boxed brownies, just tastes 10 times better."
"1","5","Delicious! For even more chocolate I sprinkled a third of a cup chocolate chips over the batter before putting it in the oven."
"1","5","These brownies turn out awesome every time I make them! The recipe does not state to mix dry together before adding to the wet ingredients, which I recommend doing so as to not over-mix the batter. Also you want to combine the dry with the wet ingredients the same way you do with muffins--gently. Over-mixing will yield a denser, drier finished product. The recipe is flexible, and I sometimes toss in chocolate chips, M&Ms, or walnuts for variety!"
"1","3","These made a pretty good chocolate cake but definitely not the best brownies."
"1","5","This is so funny, but I have been using the Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies for 2 years with the icing from this recipe. Then, I just realized they are the same recipe! The other recipe even says butter can be subtituted. The icing is the best on these brownies. I make them all the time for pot lucks. Doubling the recipe fits well in a 13x9 pan. They can be decorated anyway with sprinkles to."
"1","5","great recipe! i removed the brownies about 10 minutes before they were done, added about 10 chopped up Reese's cups, and returned the brownies for the rest of the baking time. the key to perfect brownies is to not over mix! just use a spoon and combine until no more dry areas remain. a few lumps are fine."
"1","5","Yummy yummy yummy! I did nothave honey so i double the vanilla and these are the best brownies we have ever had!"
"1","5","Best brownies is right! Followed exactly as written except I doubled it. And, I added a little bit of brewed coffee to the frosting. I love how coffee and chocolate taste together. Freaking heaven!!"
"1","4","I'm not sure these are the best brownies ever, but they were pretty darned good. I made them exactly as written. They turned out somewhat thin and chewy (not a complaint, just that they were not thick and cakey). They tasted quite nice too. I think this may have been the first time I ever made frosting for brownies, too. Worth making again; maybe I'll raise my rating."
"1","5","Amazing recipe. I did as another user suggested when I doubled the recipe, adding only one additional egg and not doubling the salt. I also used Hershey's Special Dark baking cocoa, and I tell you... I may never bake another brownie recipe again. No icing needed. This is a chocoholic's dream come true."
"1","5","OMG!! I never am successful with brownies. These are seriously easy. So delish. I did add half a bag of chocolate chips to the batter for the extra gooy factor. The frosting I cut the powdered sugar to 3/4 of a cup, and when it didn't blend well I added a tsp of skim milk... and voila! instant beautiful frosting. For me 25 min was the perfect cooking time. I also just lined a pan with reynolds heavy duty non stick aluminum foil. No nasty clean up, and when they cooled I just lifted them out of the pan to cut. Truly the best brownies I've ever ever eaten."
"1","5","Oh, boy...I really wish I hadn't found this one. Too good. Too simple. Too sinful. Just made my first--won't be the last by a long shot--batch. Ate three of the little treats and now I'm afraid if I don't get up and go jogging right this moment I might finish another row out. By the way, I used margarine instead of butter in the frosting because it's usually a little easier for mixing; and I left out the honey altogether. I just didn't think it needed it. I was right. :)"
"1","5","This recipe is absolutely AMAZING! I didn't do the frosting as the brownies are tasty enough. This is now my TOP brownie recipe. Next time I want to try adding some chocolate chips and see how that will taste. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. :)"
"1","5","These were great :) They melt in your mouth and make you want more. The only thing I would suggest is mixing and/or sifting your dry ingredients before adding them or you might end up with chunks of cocoa powder"
"1","5","These came out wonderful- and I didn't even add the frosting! Dense, chewy, very chocolate-y. Yum!"
"1","5","These brownies are sooo good! They are dense and chewy like fudge, just the way I like em'. The brownies are very easy to make too. The only issue I had with them, was spreading the frosting. The recipe says to spread the frosting over the brownies while they are still warm. I found I needed to heat up the frosting in the microwave for about 10-12 seconds before I spread it over the brownies, because otherwise the frosting started to tear and deflate the brownies. But heating up the frosting first solved that problem. These brownies were so good, I made another batch and took them to work with me. They were such a hit! They were gone within minutes and talked about for the rest of the day. I had people telling me they were literally thee best brownies they ever had. I received so many compliments. Definitely try them."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! Super easy. However, I don't make it with the frosting! Right before I pour the batter into the baking dish, I'll squeeze chocolate syrup (how much depends on the day) and mix it. They come out very moist and delicious!"
"1","5","these are so bomb! I used a cupcake pan and poured the frosting over the top when they were done baking and put them in the fridge and popped them out when cooled completely. they are dense but really really good. I did use applesauce instead of the butter and you couldn't tell the difference."
"1","5","Made these the other day- they are plenty moist and chewy- very fudgy. One of the best recipes I have made."
"1","5","Best Brownies EVER! I made these for the chocolate lovers table at my wedding reception. Again tonight just for the love of them. I made them exactly as the recipe called. Thanks Angie!"
"1","5","yummy, quick and easy"
"1","5","This recipe is fantastic!! And so easy and quick. I mix it all in my pot, so clean up is a cinch too. I melt the butter and then add the sugar in the pot. I remove it from the heat, add the dry ingredients and the vanilla and then add the eggs last. I mix it with a silicone spoon/spatula and the result is a perfect dense chewy brownie. I should add I have never made the frosting. When I made this the first time I had some left over chocolate glaze (Melted chocolate chips and butter in equal amounts and a small amt of corn syrup). I re-heated the glaze and spooned it over the top of the brownie while it was still hot and got that perfect glaze where you can't tell where the brownie ends and the frosting begins. The combination is deadly!"
"1","5","easy and a great give away gift!"
"1","5","These brownies were absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I have made them TWICE. The first time I frosted them. The second time I didn't and just dusted them with powder sugar. I would have given them 10 stars with just the powder sugar."
"1","1","Not into it. I was looking for chewy ooey. This came out like a dry sub-par chocolate cake. Guess it just depends on your brownie style needs.  Ah well, at least my chocolate lust is gone."
"1","5","So delicious! The best brownies that I have ever had."
"1","5","This is a great, quick and easy recipe. Im a cook in a supper club and I needed something quick and easyfor dessert! This was and still is the best brownie recipe I have ever made! Everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was I added some water to the frosting to make it spreadable but otherwise was AWESOME!!"
"1","5","My family loved these brownies! They were on the cake-y side, but that how we like them, NOT HARD. The only modifications I made was to melt the butter for the frosting (I couldn't wait for it to soften) and added a bit of milk, maybe 1 T. and omitted the honey, definitely sweet enough without it. I started out with about 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, stirred and added a little bit at a time until I got the consistency and sweetness I wanted. Very delish!"
"1","5","yuummmyyyy.. is all i can say .. this is the first time i have made a brownie and it turned out great..my kids love it and told me to make it everyday for their snack.. easy and very very tasty... follow the recipe and it turns out great ..thnx again for the woderful recipe.. i dint need to make any adjustments.."
"1","5","Fantastic brownie...flavor (yum), texture (tender), and no hard crust on the edges. This one is a keeper! :)"
"1","5","Kids said to stop buying the store box mix.... great with vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","No complaints, this is perfect as is."
"1","5","Good texture!"
"1","3","I'm split on these brownies. My husband loved them - thought they might be the best brownies he's ever had. I did not care for them at all. I found them to be way too sweet. It's a recipe I will make again for my husband on special occasions but I don't like them at all. Just personal preference, it's certainly a good recipe. Maybe I will read through the reviews and tinker with the recipe."
"1","5","OK... I'm not that great of a cook. I am the type that has to follow a recipe to the T. The brownies were AMAZING. and easy. But the frosting drove me crazy! I tried the actual recipe and ended up with a crumbly mess first. Then tried several of the suggestions and finally ended up with soup. My 5 year old loved sampling all my attempts at frosting. Thankfully no one else was home, so they enjoyed the frostingless brownies and didn't know the difference."
"1","5","These brownies are really something else. Even though (or probably because) the recipe is so simple these are still one of the better brownies that I have made. The entire batch was gone by morning. Totally deservs its name."
"1","1","I am glad I just made these out of boredom and not for anyone in particular, because these brownies were not good. Very disheartening :("
"1","5","Since finding this recipe I have made it for my family on at least 10 different occasions. Everytime I make them they are gone by morning! These are the BEST brownies! I have yet to make this recipe without he frosting...I always just add walnuts...but I imagine the frosting is delicious too! Try this! You will not be disappointed!"
"1","5","We had to bring dessert for an event, so I doubled this recipe and put it in a 13 x 9 pan. I received many compliments and my wife declared them the 'best brownies' she's eaten."
"1","3","I followed this recipe to the 't' and they were just okay. The flavor was not there. I read many reviews that stated that (after cooking this recipe) they will never use a brownie mix again and I disagree 100%. Although I prefer homeade recipes, I will definitely buy brownie mix at the store until I find a different recipe. The preparation was not worth the taste. Trust me."
"1","5","These brownies were the bomb! I will never buy box brownies again. For icing I just took some store bought cream cheese frosting and mixed about 3 tbs cocoa powder to about half the can to make yummy chocolate cream cheese icing!"
"1","5","I've always made brownies from a mix, these were a pleasant change from the typical mix brownie. (not hard and dry) They were very yummy!"
"1","5","My family rates this awesome brownie recipe with 5 stars! Love that you can make such super chocolatey brownies from scratch. I used Dutch cocoa powder and put pecans on top. The best I ever baked!"
"1","3","These are good if you like cakey brownies, but unfortunately my family does not. They were very easy and quick to make. The icing was very good - but I followed other reviewers' advice and only used 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar."
"1","1","I followed the directions exactly and all i got was a tough layer of messy overcooked brownies...."
"1","5","This is the best brownie ever and yes it is brownie not chocolate cake !!! finally I found a great easy recipes even better than brownie mix ,but be careful not to over mix it ,and for the frosting I add a little milk only other than that everything the same ."
"1","5","I will give this 5 stars because my stupidity is not a reason to deduct!! Baked the whole pan and then realized I left out the flour! So mad at myself. They actually ended up tasting like gooey warm brownie batter, which my kids will still eat. I am only posting this to comment on the icing. The recipe does not really say what to DO with the ingredients in the icing, just what to put in it. I guess it is assumed I one would know. It came out VERY thick. While the flavor was good, even on very warm brownies (err, baked batter) it was difficult to spread. Not sure if there is a clarification that might help. Will try again sometime!"
"1","5","These are absolutely delicious!!! I have made homemade from scratch brownies before and they were not good at all. I was a little skeptical to make these but they truly are the best brownies!! Of course the kids loved them too;)"
"1","3","I made these in a pan for bars (12 squares) and learned that a double recipe is the perfect quantity to fill the pan, and that you need to cut the cook time to 20 minutes or the brownies will burn."
"1","5","These really are delicious! I've made them soo many times, they don't stay long though, so eat them within a couple of days if you want them to be nice and chewy. If you don't have time to make the icing, the Betty Crocker Chocolate icing is really delicious with these."
"1","5","I make these brownies when I want my husband to do something around the house. They take less than 10 mins to whip up, and are so delicious!!"
"1","4","I am beginning my search for the perfect brownie recipe. This was a good start. It is indeed a little bit cakey, but it is still brownie-like (as others have mentioned. If you add a chocolate frosting, you can get your dense chocolate fix (which is what I am after). Let me ask everyone a question though- if I add more eggs, will this brownie come out more dense?"
"1","5","Made this today to the T but without the frosting on top and it tasted fantastic! This will be my brownie recipe from now on. My hubby loved it and he's very picky about brownies."
"1","5","I had a craving for brownies tonight but didn't have a mix, so came here looking for an easy recipe. To my surprise, I found these and now I will never use a mix again! I used margarine instead of butter, melted it in the microwave. Doubled the recipe and put in a 9 by 13 pan. Baked at 325 for about 27 minutes and they are perfect. Not too chewy, not too cake-like either. Didn't make the frosting because hubby doesn't like frosted brownies. This one's a keeper!"
"1","5","Comes out perfect every time!"
"1","2","I am a brownie connoisseur. The texture was great but the brownies tasted buttery -I never thought that would be a bad thing but I really didn't like it. My family liked the brownies -but they were not for me."
"1","5","OMG!!! These were amazing!! 10 stars Will never buy brwonies again!!"
"1","5","So delicious, perfectly chewy. The frosting is not necessary."
"1","5","This was my first time making these brownies. I didn't have any cocoa powder so I used 2 squares of unsweetened baker's chocolate and reduced the butter to 1/3 cup. They turned out very moist and were delicious. I also covered them in an icing I had used for cupcakes and it complimented them well. I would definitely make these again."
"1","5","Hands down THE BEST brownies you will ever eat! I had to change NOTHING with the recipe. The frosting was a tad hard to spread, but if you lay it on in thin layers and let it get melty, it's easier. A 6 star brownie actually."
"1","5","EDIT for 12-25-2011. I made these again for the 10th time! I made brownie cupcakes and gave them as a Christmas present. I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips:) Melt in your mouth good with a perfect brownie crust/crack on top!"
"1","5","I have to agree with the majority of reviewers that these are great tasting and easy to throw together. I threw in an extra tablespoon of extra dark Hershey's cocoa powder along with the 1/3 cup of the regular cocoa powder. Besides some pecans, I also mixed in about 1/3 cup of Ghiradelli double chocolate bittersweet chips. I agree that these are neither fudgey nor cakelike, but somewhere in between. If you don't want a cakelike brownie, don't overmix and definitely don't beat the mixture."
"1","5","i understand now how 80,000 people can't be wrong. seriously. so amazing."
"1","5","These brownies were so good. They are moist and chewy and not to chocolaty this will be my go to recipe from now on thanks so much for sharing. And I did make it just a little different I melted the butter for about three fifteen second intervals in the microwave and added the rest of the ingredients came out excellent."
"1","5","Excellent recipe!!! I ice these while they are still hot, it's so easy this way and everyone loved them. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","WOW! These are amazing. I doubled the recipe as we love brownies and they disappear quickly. I mixed everything by hand. I whipped up the eggs and added them to the recipe last to ensure the mixture was not over mixed. I added walnuts to the mixture as well. The brownies were perfect after 25 minutes of baking, texture was perfect smooth and not cakey just as a brownie should be. Will keep this as my brownie recipe moving forward. Thank you for sharing!"
"1","5","These brownies were fantastic! Not too cakey, not too fudgey. For anyone who is experiencing more cakey results, I think you are leaving them in too long. When I took mine out at 25 minutes, they were a little jiggly still in the middle - it will take at least 30 minutes out of the oven for those to set.   I doubled the recipe, but as someone else suggested, I only used 3 eggs. I put them in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes. I also melted one Baker's Chocolate square (semi-sweet) and drizzled it over the top before baking.  These brownies were not too sweet, not too bitter. I'm very surprised at those who experienced bitter results -- did you add the right amount of sugar? Unsweetened chocolate will have a great flavor as long as you add the proper amt of sugar!"
"1","5","These come out chewy, fudge like. This recipe is a keeper for me."
"1","5","Can't stop eating these..... :)"
"1","5","I'm a begginer baker and this was the easiest recipe to follow. I just took my first bite and can't wait to make more. I'm sure my husband and son will be asking for more of them tomorrow! I followed the recipe exact and came out wonderful :) Very pleased!"
"1","5","This recipe is great and super easy! Only adjustments I made: I used 1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of a 1/3 to make the flavor a little richer, and I added 1/4 cup vegetable oil (which is definitely the limit, next time I'll just use tablespoons instead) to make it a tad moister. I also wanted them to rise more (they're definitely NOT tall, cake-like brownies) so I added another 1/4 tsp baking powder but it didn't do much. Really recommend these brownies, and they're very easy to tweak! Oh, and I didn't try the glaze, nor does it seem to need it."
"1","5","Very good brownie recipe, very rich. I made it with the frosting this time but will try without the next time."
"1","5","This is an awesome brownie recipe. Received nothing but raves! My husband has a dairy allergy so I substituted the butter for oil. Came out great! I made up my last box of 'box' brownies and gave them away. These are even better, and my husband can once again enjoy them. Didn't try the icing. They don't need it. : )"
"1","5","This is a very nice and easy recipe to follow! I was able to make some very tasty brownies the very first time I tried, and I am only a beginner at baking! I took them out a little too early, so it was a bit soft in the middle, but they were still very good, especially when served with ice-cream =)"
"1","1","The 'frosting' was difficult to spread and these just did not taste very good to me."
"1","5","I love this brownie recipe, I think I goofed on the frosting and it was too thick to spread, I added a few splashes of milk and it was perfect. I also sprinkled some walnuts on top. It was just what I needed to cure my chocolate fix!"
"1","4","Really good brownies. These fall over the line towards cakey rather than fudgey in my opinion, but you can make that less so by mixing by hand gently and briefly. They were blonder than I expected, even with a tiny bit extra chocolate, so if I made them again I would add a bit more of that, but they still tasted great. They weren't very sweet, which was a plus in my opinion, but if you like brownies sweet, I would add more sugar too. I only cooked them for twenty minutes and they came out done through. I didn't make the frosting, so I can't attest to the deliciousness of that, but I can say that these were certainly the best brownies I've ever made, and came close to the best I've ever tasted."
"1","5","BEST BROWNIES EVER! moist and rich but not overwhelmingly sweet. seriously, best brownies i have ever had"
"1","5","I followed the directions exactly as written. The frosting was crumbly at first but after following a review to just keep mixing, eventually it turned thick and creamy like frosting should be. I did not have to add egg or oil or milk, I was just patiently stirring and mixing the crumbly powder briskly and for what felt like minutes and minutes until VOILA! we ended up with frosting. My husband and children loved this recipe. I also let the brownie sit and cool before cutting so that the frosting was the perfect texture and not too droopy and the brownie had set."
"1","5","I made these last night to satisfy a chocolate craving. I followed the recipe to a T, only I did not make the frosting. I followed the recommendation that suggested gently beating the eggs before adding to the mix, and not over mixing the batter. What came out of the oven were perfect brownies. Well formed on the outside, soft, gooey inside. Absolutely fabulous with whipped cream. Was also so simple to make. Thanks for posting."
"1","3","I thought these were better the next day -- they firmed up overnight. They were a little sweet for my taste, and they came out really thin. If I were to make them again, I think it would probably leave out some of the sugar and maybe make 1.5 batches so they would be a little thicker. I didn't make the frosting so I can't comment on that."
"1","5","Amazing Brownies! My brownies always end up like blondies, no matter what I tried... these are amazing! I changed it up a little bit though, because I doubled it. Increased the Cocoa to about 3/4 a cup. Smashed up 3 Hersey's milk chocolate bars after pouring batter into the 13x9 pan. Followed the other's suggestions about halfing the confectioners sugar. I forgot to double this part and it was just the right amount of sweetness with the chunks of milk chocolate in there too.  LOVE IT!!!! Made a double batch then had to make another the very next day! SO easy, such little clean up!"
"1","4","The icing recipe was difficult to work with. But, overall, the brownies were a hit!"
"1","5","These brownies are awesome! I made sure to sift powdered sugar for the frosting (no lumps). Definitely will be making again :)"
"1","5","Very good."
"1","5","I turned these into cupcake brownies. I followed the brownie recipe to a T, as well as the frosting which was amazzzzing...however I did add chocolate chips to the brownie batter. They are incredibly rich! One brownie will satisfy your chocolate fix. I have nothing but positive feedback for this awesome recipe. I agree with other reviewers who say they will never used boxed brownies again. These are the BEST brownie!"
"1","5","These brownies are so good!! I have made them probably seven times, and they never get old. Yum!! Thanks for this keeper!"
"1","5","Y-U-M!!!!!!!!!!!!  I made these following the recipe and added 1/2 cup of milk. Super moist. Super delicious. Added some chocolate chips too.   Yummmmmmm!"
"1","5","Wonderful brownies! I substitute flaxseed for eggs bc my son is allergic to eggs and we just can't get enough of these HM brownies. I havent tried it with the frosting yet but know it will be wonderful!"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful brownies!!! I made them for a camping trip and they were a hit. I doubled the recipe, but used only 3 eggs (which I whisked together first). I also mixed the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl. Fits perfectly in a 9x13 pan. I loved how they were the perfect gooey (but not too gooey) consistency with a crisp crust. Not cake like at all. I will never buy a boxed mix again."
"1","4","really good! I also substituted apple sauce in place of butter and it was surprisingly yummy! I kept everything else in the recipe the same but also omitted the glaze."
"1","5","I needed a very basic recipe to use as the base for a cheesecake, and these were perfect. Lovely and dense. Didn't need the frosting, but I'm looking forward to giving that a try as well. =)"
"1","5","These brownies were amazing - everyone raved about them! These are a combination of a gooey and cakey consistency. The frosting had an interesting taste with the honey addition - but topped with chopped, toasted walnuts it was a hit. This recipe - and the irish cream brownies from myrecipes.com - will definitely be a regular."
"1","5","These brownies are amazing!! They really are in between 'cakey' and 'fudgy' brownies and I think they are just fine even without the icing. I made the icing exactly how the recipe says and it was kinda thick and a little too sweet for my taste. But nonetheless these brownies are SUPERB :) Will definitely make them again!!"
"1","3","Usually I like desserts that aren't very sweet. This recipe wasn't sweet enough. It did not balance out the bitterness of the cocoa. Also, it was more cake like than I had expected by the previous reviews."
"1","5","A few people mentioned that these were a 'fudgy' type brownie so I decided to make a bite-sized version . I used my mini muffin tins and followed the recipe exactly. They were perfect! :D And way better than the pre-packaged store bought ones. I baked them at 325 for 15 minutes. I didn't ice them cause they didn't need it."
"1","5","These brownies are awesome. The people who rated these 1 star clearly don't have any tastbuds. By far the best brownies I've ever had!"
"1","4","Very good! They came out perfectly. Love these brownies!"
"1","5","I was in a crunch for time and threw these together for a family reunion. I hoped for the best...and was very pleased with the results! They were quick and easy to make and the pan was empty when it was time to leave. Thank you!!"
"1","5","these brownies are great! the only thing different from the recipe i did was to temper the eggs before adding them and then let them bake for app. 35 min. they are crusty and very, very moist on the inside. i can not imagine how anyone could not like these or how they can mess these up. they are easy to make and supper yummy! this one's a keeper!"
"1","3","Too cakey for my taste. The proportions are good - not too sweet, and nicely chocolatey, but definitely cakey."
"1","5","These were the best homemade brownies I've ever had! I had to add 2 extra tablespoons of butter to the frosting to make it creamy enough, but I think that maybe if I had creamed the butter before adding the other ingredients I would not have had to."
"1","5","These brownie's are rich, and my hubby loves the recipe and so does other men at his work. I added a 1/2 cup of semi sweet tollhouse chocolate chips with a tablespoon of flour, coat the chips with flour so the chips set in the mix and WOW amazing. Thanks for posting this recipe."
"1","4","I have never made homemade brownies before but these were delicious!!!! I would make again!!!"
"1","5","I love these brownies! They are so much better than a box mix. So easy to make and delicious!"
"1","5","These are really good if you like a really rich and fudgy brownie! Next time I will warm up the frosting before putting it on the brownies, because I think it smushed them. I'm also going to double the recipe next time because it didnt make very much. Excellent brownies, though."
"1","5","Very simple and good. Loved this recipe."
"1","4","Delicious! I topped them w/cream cheese icing (already in freezer), added 1/4 c. chocolate chips & 1/4 c. chopped walnuts & took to a dinner party. Everyone LOVED them. However, my husband & i thought they were a bit thin & not fudgy enough. I will make them again. The flavor was great."
"1","3","I would not call this Best brownie. Does not taste like a brownie. I thought it tasted exactly like wacky cake, yet had more ingredients, not a brownie at all."
"1","5","the frosting was delicious with the honey in it. This was a great recipe for brownies."
"1","5","This was an awesome chocolate fix. Super easy and hit the spot!"
"1","5","These are the BEST homemade not-from-a-premix- brownies that I've ever made! It's the right amount of chocolate and the texture is perfect!"
"1","5","No need for the topping per the recipe... the brownies were perfectly sweet without it! Everyone loved these, and I plan to make them over and over again."
"1","4","These are good, though I like mine more moist and rich"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! It is easy and quick. This recipe is a good base recipe if you want to replace ingredients. The brownies turned out fudgy. They remind of those little debbie brownies without all the fat and sugar. Delish!"
"1","3","Taste was great but the frosting is difficult to work with. It's way too stiff. It is difficult to spread. Thought I did something wrong so made it twice. Turned out the same way. Will use a different frosting next time"
"1","4","These are the best brownies that I have tried from this site and I like them because they are more chocolatey than even the recipes that call for chocolate squares and chocolate chips. They are also extremely quick and easy. I followed the directions exactly execpt I made a double batch and did not use a mixer to incorporate the flour and cocoa powder. Instead I just mixed by hand..only 50 strokes or less. Dont overmix, and like others have said, don't overbake. I would have given it 5 stars if I could somehow get that crust on top that I get with the boxed stuff. Thanks so much for the recipe Angie."
"1","5","I tried a few substitutions to 'healthyfy' 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 cup greek yogurt instead of the butter 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup agave instead of 1 cup white sugar 1/4 cup white flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 cup white flour Added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and reduced salt to 1/8 teaspoon. The flavor was perfect a bit thin but will do this again"
"1","5","Yummy! These brownies are wonderful!  The consistency is between a brownie and a dense cake... next time I make this I'll make into a cake with cream cheese frosting :)"
"1","5","With or without frosting I took it to fair one year and got a blue. For me the preparation time takes about 10-15 min. tops this is great! Just make sure you know that powdered sugar is confectioners' sugar."
"1","5","Brilliant, tasty, I usually eat half the batter raw it's so good!"
"1","5","FANTASTIC Brownies chocolatey and moist. I doubled the recipe used a 9x13 pan and added a cup of chopped almonds. The icing is sooooo good! My husband says they're the best he ever had. This will be my 'Go to' brownies recipe from now on."
"1","5","These really are the best brownies!! My family loves them. This recipe doubles perfectly."
"1","5","I didn't even put the frosting on these and they were SO good! We did add walnuts and m&ms which made them very rich. SO GOOD and EASY!"
"1","4","I would give the brownies a 5 and the frosting a 1. The brownies are perfect and just fudgy enough. The frosting is just thick even when I followed the reviews and used 1/2 the sugar! So just make the brownies!"
"1","5","These brownies are so awesome & delicious!! I think they are perfect without the frosting, but they are great with the icing too. In my oven the perfect time is 25 minutes, nice & fudgey. :)"
"1","5","best homemade brownies we've ever had! added some toffee bits and white chocolate chips...omitted the frosting. so delicious!"
"1","5","These are THE Best Brownie! My final prodect looks just like the one in the picture! I made a double batch for a memorial day party and they are fabulous. One thing I had trouble with was the frosting. It was really dry at first so I but it in the mircrowave for a little bit which seemed to do the trick. I reccoment puting the frosting on with a spatula in order to make it easier to apply and for a smoother finish. Super easy and extremely good."
"1","5","These were absolutely yummy!! First, I over mixed the batter so it was a bit cakey, but they were still yummy. Two things I did that made a huge difference after they were baked and cooled. After I frosted it, I stuck it in the freezer to harden the frosting and that did the trick to making it thick and hard. Then after the brownies were completely cooled, I refrigerated them, this gave them that fudgey like look and just made them over the top. Give these a try, just DON'T over mix them!! Also...for the frosting I followed some of the tips. I only used half the amount of powdered sugar it called for. This made a TASTY frosting! ADDED 9/8/2011: I always double my recipe, this time I did half whole wheat flour and half AP flour....yummy results and a little better for you. A bonus...my picky husband and kid's didn't even notice!"
"1","5","Fantsatic! Didn't make the icing but the brownie itself was phenmenal : ) I only had about 1/3 c butter so I drizzled a little veg oil in the mix. I think that's what I'll do everytime I make these now because I don't think that they could get any better."
"1","5","These brownies are great! Fudgy and chewy. I always add a little instant coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor. Thats the only change I made. Excellent, will make again!"
"1","5","Agreed: 'these brownies always turn out' AS LONG AS you add the flour....How could I have forgotten? REALLY!? Better a second time, with flour. Thanks for the simple recipe!"
"1","4","i gave it 4 stars because i like my brownies to be thick and the way it is written, the frosting is just as thick as the brownie itself...i put the batter into two separate 3' dishes and mixed one with 1/2c walnuts...holy ...it was amazing"
"1","5","My boys LOVE these! A new family favorite! I love that they are farely quick and easy. We double the batch and bake in a 13 x 9 pan."
"1","4","These were great and really chocolaty. There were gone in 2 days!"
"1","4","Took the advice of a few reviews and made some changes (the reason for the four stars, even though the results are definitely worth 5).  I doubled the recipe, but only used 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 tsp. salt. I also used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup applesauce.   The result: dense, moist, fudgy yet sliceable brownies that blow the socks off of boxed mixes. Be sure to line the pan with foil for easy removal and slicing."
"1","1","Okay...I am not sure what I did wrong with these. I am a pretty good cook, and I followed the recipe exactly, other than substituting Splenda for the sugar (which I often do when I bake), and I didn't make the frosting. They turned out AWFUL. They didn't rise at all and were almost completely flat...and they honestly didn't taste that great either. I can't figure out what I did wrong!!"
"1","5","Yummy! Rich and chocolatey! Very good recipe! I was looking for a dessert using cocoa powder and things I had around the kitchen and this popped up. I just baked them and iced them and my boys and husband consumed the entire pan already! This is a keeper! Thanks!"
"1","5","Very tasty... And I made them with what I had on hand! My husband said that they were good, although the chocolate taste was 'authentic' instead of the commercial chocolate he is used to. I did not frost the brownies... That seems like something you do for a cake. These were not hard or chewy... They were a light bite, but fudge like. They didn't stick to my teeth (something I don't like) but they were not cake like. They were much denser without the same stick together. This recipe did crumble a bit. I did sift the cocoa powder and flour together to ensure no odd lumps and made sure not to over mix. I might spring for a better quality cocoa powder (I used Hershey's) if I was going to make them for other people... But to satisfy a late night urge... These are it! They were good out of the oven and then when they were cold later!"
"1","5","I wanted to make the 'brownie batter + cupcake = the second best cupcake. ever' recipe i found on this site (try it, it's heaven!) but i didn't have brownie mix in the house.  These worked PERFECTLY for that with a few tweaks according to some of the reviewers: a) upped the cocoa to 3/4 cup b) upped the flour to 1 cup (though that was by accident, it worked out fine).  Didn't touch the frosting so you're on your own for that.  I had some extra brownie batter so made them straight, they're good but a little dense-probably from the extra flour. and actually, i think i'd go down in cocoa too.  Moral of the story: stick to the recipe unless you're making the cupcakes."
"1","5","Super Yummy!!! I followed the advice to 1/2 the powerdered sugar content for the frosting but I added a small T of creamy peanut butter to it as well. Really good!!!"
"1","4","these brownies were good, but not amazing. i was almost afraid to make them due to all the reviews that said they were cake-like, which i cannot stand in a brownie. mine were not cake-like and were fudgy, but not as much as i like. i did make a change to use both brown and white sugar and also added chocolate chips and a splash more vanilla. i also used another frosting so i cant comment on how good that is. from all the brownie recipes ive tried on this site, Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies is still my favourite"
"1","5","The title 'Best Brownies' is absolutely correct! I cut back on the butter (to about 1/3 cup) and they are DELICIOUS! They are now my #1 used brownie recipe. Thank you!"
"1","1","I've never met a brownie I didn't like...until now. :-( I followed someone else's recommendation of omitting the frosting, and substituting applesauce for butter, half Splenda / half sugar for sugar, and egg whites for eggs. Blah! They were very flat and dense. Not at all crumbly or moist like brownies should be. I told my guests they wouldn't hurt my feelings if they just threw their serving in the trash."
"1","5","These brownies are the best I have ever made from scratch. I even used egg substitute (Baking powder and water) because I was out of eggs and they were amazing! Very chewy and excellent flavor! No alterations needed here except to double or triple the recipe! :)"
"1","5","These turned out good, reading some reviews I thought they were going to turn out cakey but they were not, though they're not the fudgyest brownies either, they were more fudgy than cakey to me. I made the icing as well, I added a little milk to it because I don't think I measured out enough butter, I thought the icing was fine. I wouldn't say its the best brownie I've made, but I'd say it's up there."
"1","5","Great combination of chewy and crunchy. The frosting was amazing! I may add mint extract to the frosting next time for a change of flavor. I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes."
"1","4","Good and Easy"
"1","4","This recipe is very close to the Hershey's recipe for brownies. However, they are easy to make and turn out really well."
"1","5","These are really the best brownies I ever made! One time I tried baking brownies and they were just too dry, but these are GREAT! Cakey outside and in the middle 'chewey'! Thanks for this wonderful recipe! Lisa"
"1","5","I followed the advice of bakedbyjen since I was doubling the recipe. They turned out great! We did not add the icing to minimize the mess since this was for a school function. We also added mini M&M's on top for fun! Thanks for a great homemade brownie recipe!"
"1","5","I use my own icing, a family favorite!! but by far the best brownies ever!!!!"
"1","4","These turned out wonderful, they were moist and chocolately! Simple tasty recipe."
"1","5","Sooo YUMMY!! And so easy! I didn't make the frosting just covered with pwdr sugar! Anyone who says it's more like cake, made it wrong! This will forever be my brownie recipe!!"
"1","4","I am only rating the brownie recipe, which is why I gave it 4 stars. This is the first time I've ever made scratch brownies and they were SO delicious! I won't use a box brownie ever again. To top the brownies I used another frosting recipe from this site. Can't wait to make these again."
"1","5","These brownies are the best I have ever made. My nephew has informed me 'These are the bestest brownies in the whole wide world and I love you more because you make them!' Can't get a better endorsement than an unfiltered 6-yr-old's review!"
"1","3","The frosting has a wonderful flavor, but the brownies just weren't my cup of tea."
"1","5","I made these brownies and added caramel bits, chocolatechips, pecans. They were great. I even got a call from my mom asking me to make her more. Thanks for the great recipie."
"1","5","These brownies definitely live up to its title! This is the first time I've ever made brownies from scratch and it was successful! I was concerned when making these and poured them into an 8x8 baking dish because the batter seemed so thin. I thought maybe they are supposed to 'fluff' up which I did not want because I don't like 'cakey' brownies. I am used to the box kind which are thick in consistency and come out fudgy. The brownies turned out great! They are not thick brownies by any means but no need because they are still very dence and rich! A small piece is all you need to satisfy any chocolate lovers gotta-have craving. I don't think the frosting makes or breaks this recipe. I like mine with but I suppose it depends on how sweet you like your desserts. I will never bake boxed brownies again! They just don't compare!"
"1","1","My 11 year old sells cookies at my husbands work. We are always on the hunt for yummy recipes. As we were making these (we made 7 batches), we thought they were so easy to make; until the frosting!!! What a nightmare! It was very frustrating. First off, the frosting was hard, then it said to 'spread'. How?! We actually patted it in our hands and laid it on the brownies. Well, after a few, we stopped 'frosting'. We compared the two, with, and without frosting. The ones with were gross! The ones without were pretty good. All that work for nothing!! Also, DO NOT flour the pan!! It makes the brownies look awful underneath. We will NOT be making these again!"
"1","5","Awesome brownies.So easy to make my 10 year old son made them all by himself.Turned out picture perfect and they were extremely yummy."
"1","5","These are awesome! The best recipe I have found so far! It's quick, easy, and oh so tasty! Love the crunch you get on the outside then the nice soft gooey middle. I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of heath bar to mine too! They are the best brownies I have ever had! I even used whole wheat flour and turbinado sugar. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","2","Tastes okay, but doesn't have that 'brownie' consistency I'm used to."
"1","3","fantastic flavor- i mean amazing!- but so incredibly oily"
"1","5","These are amazing!! I froze some so we wouldn't eat the whole batch...we practically ate them right out of the freezer! They're good like that too! Thanks!"
"1","5","Made these for my son and his friends and they raved. Didn't bother to frost them either."
"1","5","I was having a MAJOR sweet tooth and wanted something quick so I whipped up these brownies. soooo easy and delicious! (not at all cakelike like some reviewers said, they were probably over-mixing). I had to use brown sugar and they taste fine. I love the ease of this recipe. Because I am lazy, I melted the butter for the frosting to make mixing it easier. It is very good, but super sweet, I would consider removing or lessening the honey in the future. But wonderful recipe! Perfect for when you are craving something sweet!"
"1","5","WIll never buy store bought brownie mix again. I've never had a brownie from scratch, wish I could make these every day and not gain weight. Nice recipe for a splurge."
"1","5","AMAZING!"
"1","5","These turned out fantastic. My only problem was the icing only make a small amount. It barely covered my entire batch. I think I will double it next time for more icing. It still tasted great."
"1","5","Best homemade brownies!"
"1","5","These were the best homemade brownies I have ever had! They turned out perfect. They are very rich (too rich for my husband), but I thought they were great. I was skeptical about having honey in the icing, but it was soooo good! I added some chocolate chips to the top for an extra treat. I highly recommend them!!"
"1","3","Too sweet and not chocolately enough for my family. Where not at all cakey! They had a great texture and I may try again with much less sugar and MORE cocoa,"
"1","5","Holy cow these are great! The only adjustment I did have to make was to heat the frosting up. Wow! I have always made box brownies, but not any more. I have now made these four times and they are a hit everytime. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","these brownies are just as the name states, BEST BROWNIES!!! all my friends are shocked when they find out these are cocoa brownies. sometimes to mix things up i add, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, mint oil, coffee, maraschino cherries, the possibilities are endless and they turn out perfect everytime. last time when i took them out of the oven i covered them with mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, and walnuts then covered til completely cooled....OMG i think they lasted about 10 seconds they were soooo good!"
"1","5","Yum! These brownies were so easy to make. I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the frosting with the honey in it, but it is scrumptious!"
"1","5","Truly are the BEST brownies and every time I have made them everyone agrees. I don't change a thing except I double it and bake in a 9X13 pan. Oh, I do have to add milk to the frosting. Try them though! They taste like you are eating fudge!"
"1","4","I made these as directed but used 1/2 tsp of maple syrup instead of honey because I realized last minute I was out of honey. They turned out great!"
"1","5","These brownies are delicious! The recipe is so simple, but yet so perfect. I have made these many, many, many times and everyone seems to love them! I have also renovated this recipe and made it into a healthier version, which are absolutely to die for!"
"1","4","I doubled the cocoa powder and skipped the frosting. These brownies were great, but I've had better.. However I WOULD make them again.. and again."
"1","5","the name says it all if u like a dense brownie then these are the BEST BROWNIES"
"1","4","The brownie was good but better with the frosting. The brownies were very thin as well."
"1","2","I gave this two stars solely for the frosting. It was chocolatey and fudgy . . . mmmmh. The actual brownie however is, sadly, chocolate cake. Not even good chocolate cake but dry tasteless cake. I really had high hopes for this recipe, wanting a chewy fudgy brownie but this wasn't it."
"1","5","Easy and delicious! I've never made brownies from scratch, but now I always will. I dusted some powdered sugar on top and skipped the icing. My family polished off the pan in an hour!"
"1","5","Thanks Angie! These brownies were easy and quick to make. They came out fudgy and delicious with no changes to the brownie part of the recipe. I *WOULD* suggest skipping the honey in the frosting and use milk to thin. I made the frosting as suggested and it was unworkable. I thinned with milk and added one tablespoon of peanut butter to mask the honey flavor (I was using a strong honey). Still five stars!"
"1","5","I found this recipe very quickly while making dinner. It was so quick I had it in the oven before we ate and they were done as soon as we were ready for them. I loved that it didn't make a huge pan becaus we would have eaten them all! Without telling him the name of the recipe my husband said these were THE best brownies he's ever had! Great texture, crispy on the edges and soft but chewy in the middle. I added a little extra cocoa powder, some walnuts and left off the frosting. This will be my new go to brownie recipe! Thanks Angie! :)"
"1","2","cakey :( not browny like at all!"
"1","5","I have been making this recipe for many years now and it has always been a hit. I have done this recipe with whole wheat flour and it is still delicious. With the icing, it is absolutely decadent and wonderful (bring it to the office and the ladies will not stop raving about them). Without the icing, they are addicting and less guilty."
"1","5","I just needed a quick sweet fix tonight and this was perfect! It only took me about 10 mins to get the brownies into the oven. One thing I would definitly note is that I did not whisk the batter at all but just stired it together leaving the chunks that were left from the flour and coco powder this helps keep them more of a true brownie and not a cake."
"1","4","These brownies were pretty stellar. I'm only giving them four stars because the fudge frosting was a pain in my butt. I mixed everything as written and it turned into a crumbly mess. I ended up having to heat it over the stove to mix and soften the frosting mess, and it turned into a giant chocolate dough ball (think Tootsie Rolls). Not what I was expecting. I had no problem coating the brownies with the 'frosting', but it hardened up pretty fast. Like rock solid chocolate. I'd make it again, but I'd either double all the frosting ingredients with the exception of the powdered sugar or I'd use a completely different chocolate fudge frosting recipe. But those brownies were awesome and a quick fix for a brownie craving when there is no Duncan Hines in the pantry!"
"1","5","It came out very rich and dense with a crispy top but a bit crumbly (?). I must have done something wrong LOL. Otherwise, this recipe is great!"
"1","5","I didn't make these with the frosting just the brownies but they turned out great and the kids love them."
"1","4","They are VERY good. The only thing is, they are NOT very fudgy. They are definitely a more cake-like brownie. That said, they are super good, especially with the frosting. I am a fudgy brownie person, but these were yummy. I followed the recipe nearly exactly, besides doubling it and adding a bit more vanilla extract. YUM! Now, if only I could find a super fudgy recipe."
"1","5","I've made this several times (and adapted it to become my own) and have never had a single person not love it. Verbal signs of orgasmic pleasure is omitted when people eat these brownies. If you're getting a cakey texture, then you're doing it wrong! There's absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe. I personally prefer undercooking mine because I prefer a more lava-cake texture, which is not like a traditional chewy and hard brownie. Mine come out nothing like the pictures (and I'm happy), so I always undercook mine and I'm happy for that. Try it and I bet you'll never go back to a traditional hard brownie.  Also, I have never made the fudge (and I never will) because I prefer make my own toppings. The best is probably homemade caramel or homemade nutella."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. The brownie itself is very chocalatey without being too sweet. For the icing, I actually just used 1/2 cup brown sugar (you can actually use anywhere between 1/4 to 1/2 depending on your sweetness preference), 2 tbsns of soft butter, 3 tablespons of cocoa butter and the tbsn of vanilla extract. I then used this on top of the brownies and it really added a nice sweet flavour to the brownies. This is something you can do if you don't have icing sugar at home yet you feel the urge to make brownies."
"1","3","Very rich, gooey brownies if you don't over-bake! My problem was with the icing (as many have pointed out). If I try these again, I'll double it and melt the butter..."
"1","5","I wish I could give these brownies 10 stars!!!! They are SOOOOO good. The trick is to leave them in the oven the perfect amount of time...check them often to make sure they don't overbake, otherwise they are dry and crumby and just not as good! The icing is divine and gives them the perfect touch. So rich--a MUST for chocolate lovers like myself. Do yourself a favor and try these brownies!!!"
"1","4","Followed the recipe exactly. Really not impressed...these really didn't taste like anything special. I've had box brownies that were better."
"1","5","Resounding YUMS at our house!! I usually make a recipe at least twice before I review it...but these were so incredible that I couldn't wait! I didn't change anything about this recipe - it's perfect!! Goodbye Betty Crocker!"
"1","5","These were awesome! I doubled the recipe and mixed everything by hand. They came out soft, chewy, and tasted like fudge. I did need to add a little warm water to the frosting to get it to the right consistency. I will definitely be keeping this recipe and making them often."
"1","4","These were OK. The icing was difficult to spread. I added more butter to it but then it made the brownies too moist, and they fell apart, but they were still tasty."
"1","5","Oh yeah! I just baked a pan of these this morning and am now eating them warm from the pan. Yum! I followed the recipe to the letter, but didn't make the frosting. I don't know if there will be any left when the kids come home from school today."
"1","5","Fantastic! But they are more like fudge than brownies. Very rich."
"1","5","I halved the recipe. Mixed everything in a 4 cup pyrex measuring cup. Melted the butter in the microwave and just stirred everything together with a fork. Next, I put the batter in a 6 cup muffin pan that I sprayed with pam and I baked for 13 mins until the ends looked done but the center looked soft. OMG, these were amazing! I didn't make the frosting, I had them with Ben and Jerry's vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","omgoodness! These are now my only brownie recipe. Next time I HAVE to double it. THESE ARE SO GOOEY, MOIST, DELICIOUS AOFIJAE;IAJF;KJ everything. I need to go to MMA tonight to work off the whole pan.. I mean... one slice :)"
"1","5","Was told that these are the best brownies my sister in law ever tasted"
"1","5","I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written, including the frosting. (Except that I doubled it and made them in a 13x9.) I stirred mine with a wooden spoon just until the wet and dry ingredients were mixed. My kids and I have rated these as THE BEST BROWNIES EVER! I will never make boxed brownies again."
"1","5","These brownies are SO good! The consistency and texture is perfect-not too fudgy, not too cakey, not too chewy..I did as some other reviewers suggested and beat the eggs slightly in a separate bowl and then added into the wet batter. Also, I stirred the batter with a wooden spoon just until the dry ingredients were mixed in. I didn't make them with frosting but will try it next time. These are just as easy as a cake mix but taste so much better."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. They were very chocolaty and the frosting melted beautifully on the brownies and set up nicely as they cooled. They were a hit for Super Bowl Weekend. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","3","Ever had a Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie? well... these aren't that much like them. But they are pretty good. Also I would eat them sans frosting. And it's hard to mix in the eggs so they don't cook in the warm butter."
"1","1","I was quite disappointed in these since I had high expectations given their overall rating. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to those who mentioned that this recipe produced something that is in-between cake brownies and chewy brownies, since these ended up being much more like cake than brownies."
"1","5","I've never made homemade brownies before, these are the best brownies EVER. I will never use a box mix again. I only baked these 25 minutes and they turned out perfect, followed the recipe exactly; the frosting is very thick and takes a long time to 'look like' frosting, I put it on as soon as I took these out of the oven and it worked out beautifully! I would give more than 5 stars if I could!"
"1","5","Decadent. Can't eat box brownies any longer."
"1","3","Verrrry rich. The chocoholics loved it, but I don't think I'll make it again based on my family's tastes. Other reviews commented on the texture, but I followed the recipe exactly and thought it had a normal brownie density."
"1","4","The brownies turned out very tasty. I used the recipe exactly. I am wondering tho if maybe i add a 3rd egg it'd be more moisturised. I'll try again soon with the 3rd egg and see if it helps. Keep you posted!! :)"
"1","5","i just threw a handful of chocolate chips in the batter as well; MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!!!!!!!!!!! simply wonderful so, so, easy. LOVELY RECIPE!"
"1","4","it taste good, super easy and fast, but it turns out caky , i don't know what i did wrong!! i mixed all the ingredients by hand, and bake for 25 min(as i check it at 20 min it was very runny from the middle) i think am gonna give it another chance and try to take it of the oven at 20 min and see.. wish me luck"
"1","5","YUM!!! These were absolutely perfect!!"
"1","5","this was my first-ever attempt at brownies, and they were ohmygosh delicious! :)"
"1","5","Very Good! They really are the best brownies. I made these one evening when we really wanted brownies but didn't have any brownie mix. Now my husband, does not want me to buy mix anymore and only make these! I did not make the frosting (we never frost our brownies and did not have the ingredients on hand). Next time I want to jazz them up even more and add chocolate chips/chopped walnuts."
"1","4","These were a lovely brownie as many have said it is a nice compromise between cakey and fudgey. The crumb is very like a bakery brownie, very fine textured yet tastes like fudge, so chocolatey! Followed directions exactly but only needed to bake twenty minutes. I used my own frosting and dusted that with Heath toffee bits. Oh, and I also put semi-sweet chips in the batter. Is it the best brownie ever, it sure is a contender!"
"1","5","these brownies are amazing. ive tried a few brownie recipes from this site and this one tops them all. i doubled the recipe and used one less egg. they were not cakey at all. instead of the frosting i threw in chocolate chips in the batter. heaven."
"1","5","Thank you, these are amazing! They turn out every time!"
"1","5","This is the best brownie of the world."
"1","1","Very disappointed with this recipe."
"1","4","I made individual brownies in a cupcake pan and the recipe turned out okay. A little on the cakey side for my taste but still chocolately goodness."
"1","5","tried this recipie for the first time and first time making brownies and it was perfect the brownies were almost inhaled by my two teenaged sons. Easy and clear instructions"
"1","5","Fudgy, delicious, perfect. I made them and made the fluffy peanut butter frosting and they are divine."
"1","5","These brownies are fantastic. I have tried to make brownies before and they never turn out right and those were box mixes. This was so easy to make and I'm very pleased with the results. I will definitely be making these again."
"1","5","So far, I've made these brownies twice this week and my brother has been begging me to make them again. Unlike normal brownies, these are softer and amazing. Tip - make sure to sift flour. it will make the brownies better. I've found they only need to cook for 20 to 25 minutes until ready. This has definitely become my favorite dessert recipe!!"
"1","5","This recipe makes the 'Best Brownies' literally! My husband and mother-in-law fell so in love with them we went through four batches in a week and a half."
"1","5","Perfect!!!"
"1","5","these brownies certainly are the 'best brownies'!! restaurant quality dessert, served hot with vanilla ice cream...delish!!"
"1","5","My husband really enjoyed these!"
"1","5","These were ridiculously easy and insanely moist and delicious! I just sprayed the pan with non-stick coating rather than grease and flour, and I didn't frost them because I was being lazy. AMAZING!!"
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe! I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan. I melted the butter in a saucepan and put the rest of the ingredients in and used a wooden spoon to mix until smooth. I made sure to scrape the corners of the pan too. I didn't ice them as I am not a huge fan of icing. My kids and husband loved them. This is my new brownie recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious!! Everyone had seconds and thirds! Great recipe! I followed others suggestions with not stirring the mix too much, and warming the icing, it turned out perfectly!"
"1","5","I am a TERRIBLE baker. Try as I might, I usually fail unless it comes to breads or packaged stuff. I made these on a whim because I was craving something sweet & didn't want our usual diet snacks. They did not disappoint. I was surprised to see they hadn't been reviewed in awhile. I was a little worried when I saw a few of the negative reviews but I think majority rules & everyone seems to like them. I definitely thought they had brownie like consistency!? They weren't ask thick as normal but you could just double the recipe to make them thicker. Easy peezy. Very yummy. The frosting definitely makes these."
"1","5","Fabulous!"
"1","4","Always a hit."
"1","5","My husband loves brownies and he gave these a 5 1/2 star rating! I made them exactly as written except that I added a few drops of milk and 2 Tbsp. peanut butter to the frosting. This will be our go-to brownie recipe from now on!"
"1","5","These were the best brownies for sure !!!! I do have to say I agree with the other reviews 25 minutes to cook exactly is perfect. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Tastes like fudge!!! So delicious. Made them yesterday and they are gone already!!"
"1","5","Dense fudgey brownies. Love this recipe. It is a one pot brownie. I also love putting all the dry goods in a bag and having my own brownie mix. For the frosting, I need to add a little bit of cream to make it smooth. All and all and fantastic recipe."
"1","5","After reading a bunch of reviews, I decided to make these exactly as listed. I did have to add a dash of 1/2 and 1/2 to the icing to get it to mix. It wasn't spreadable and took some of the top of the brownie off when I tried to spread it, so I let it sit on the hot brownies and melt for a few minutes and then it spread much better. The icing was a little sweet for me, but overall still an awesome brownie. My husband loved them too. To the reviewer who said they were cakey, I would recommend following the recipe as written and NOT overcooking. I started checking mine at 23 min and they were ready at about 27 min. They are nice and fudgy on the inside with crisp edges, I wouldn't do anything differently next time. Thanks for the great recipe! ETA: usually when I make brownies, we like them very well at first, but end up having togive or throw some away, as there are always more in the pan than we have an appetite for. With this recipe, they were gone in just over 24 hours and my husband asked me to bake another batch right away. I guess they really are the best brownies!! *ETA2: I just made these again, subbing rapadura for the sugar and spelt flour for the white flour and they are still amazing. yum!!"
"1","5","WOW, these are every bit as good as everyone says they are! I followed the tips of hand mixing and baking exactly 25 minutes and they are perfect. I didn't bother to make the frosting and in our world, it only yields 8 servings......so off to the gym I go. :) Think I'll take this camping this summer and bake in my cardboard oven!"
"1","5","I don't usually follow recipes as written but this one is AMAZING!!!! Haven't tried the frosting as I feel it's good enough without it."
"1","5","I have searched and searched for a good brownie recipe and this one is by far the best one I have tried. They come out so moist and delicious, I have friends and family always asking me to make them!"
"1","4","Very Sweet! Good moist brownie. I ended up having to add a little milk to the frosting, but it turned out great. My daughter loved them."
"1","5","Those were great. My men enjoyed them and that makes me happy. Thanks so much"
"1","3","I too think there was something unclear about the frosting recipe. I had to take my butter chunks out and melt them in the microwave. Even then, it would not mix very well so I added some heavy whipping cream. The honey was a bit overwhelming for me so the added whipping cream helped mellow it out. They were good brownies. Not the best I have made, but good enough that I am sure none will be thrown out."
"1","4","Brownie Recipe is SPOT ON! simple and delicious! The frosting recipe, definitely cut the sugar in half!!! I failed to read the reviews beforehand, and the icing was a bust....... also great if you add pecans (my opinion....)"
"1","4","The brownies were great, the frosting was just a little too sweet for me personally.."
"1","2","These brownies are OK at best. Maybe I did something wrong, but these definitely are not the 'best brownies'."
"1","5","The only brownie recipe I'll use... Definitely the Best Brownies!"
"1","4","Fantastic brownies! So simple to make. :D"
"1","3","I'm not sure what, but something is missing in these brownies... More cake, than brownie texture. I'm going to play around with the recipe, and see if I can make the ultimate brownie."
"1","5","YUM! These brownies were great and so easy/quick to make...Don't know what other reviewers did to say that they were 'cake-like'. They came out very fudgy and gooey! When making the icing according to the recipe it was very solid, so I added about a tablespoon of butter and kept putting it in the microwave when the brownies were almost done to make it a smoother consistency"
"1","5","Is the best Brownie recipe i have ever found, never changed a thing! doubling it next time sure never lasted long!"
"1","5","first time making brownies w/o a mix - FANTASTIC - THANKS! i didn't have honey so subbed karo syrup in the frosting, but had to add milk because i couldn't get the butter/sugar/cocoa to 'combine'. turned out great!"
"1","5","These really are fantastic. I think the key is not to use an electric mixer, but do it by hand. They're chewy and heavy and great. No frosting needed, especially if you sprinkle a few chocolate chips on the top just as they go into the oven. Thanks"
"1","4","Maybe I haven't found the right brownie recipe. Or maybe I just don't care for brownies... are they cake or are they fudge? At any rate, this recipe was a cinch to throw together and even without the frosting, the crew horked these down... nary a crumb was left."
"1","5","Yumm!! Just added some almond extract and cinnamon to the batter and icing. Also added a T. of milk and a T. of corn syrup to the icing when I was melting the butter. Seriously delicious!!"
"1","5","So delicious and moist that I didn't need to make the frosting! As odd as is it, using a plastic knife to cut them does the trick. No crumbs! UPDATE: Made these last night WITH the frosting. I had to add about 2 tsp of milk to thin it out. The brownies were to DIE for with the frosting!"
"1","5","I.LOVE.THESE.BROWNIES. I have made these many times over the last year and they are always a hit! I double the recipe and put them in a 9x13 pan and double the frosting. As the recipe says, make sure to NOT overcook them. They are supposed to be gooey, cake-like browines....goooood stuff! I think they would also taste amazing if ou added chocolate chips or mint chips before baking. Enjoy!"
"1","1","dont ever make"
"1","5","These brownies are amazing, and turned out perfectly both times. Lots of compliments from friends and family. I waited until they were cooled before frosting. Also added about a 1/2 cup more butter to the frosting recipe (more like a buttercream) as I found it to be a little dry and crumbly."
"1","4","Made w/o frosting. Put mini choc. chips & reeses chips on half and it was much fudgier and moist! Good!"
"1","4","These tasted pretty good but the icing, I could do without. I didn't like it. Even though I mixed with a wooden spoon and tried real hard not to have many air pockets, It still came out cakey. I will try it again."
"1","5","I found this recipeabout 2 years ago and I make it ALL the time! It has never ever failed me, and is even just as delicious without the icing if you are in a hurry.If I have company coming I sometimes make them ahead of time, and warm each peice in the microwave one by one and serve it with ice cream. I have yet to serve these to anyone who has not asked for the recipe afterwards. MMMMM!!!!"
"1","5","I baked this in a 9x9 pan for 20 minutes and it was extremely moist and a bit chewy, just like we like it. I made the icing but cut the icing sugar in 1/2 and it was perfect. I added walnuts cause I love them and they were enjoyed by all who ate!! Thanks"
"1","5","These are very rich! Very yummy though!! I followed the directions, and my family loved them! I did double the recipe to cook in a 9x13 dish. I will definitely make these again."
"1","5","5/5 ~ These were ahh-mazing! I made the frosting and put it on RIGHT when they came out of the oven, it absorbed quickly and they were just amazing. Although, I did add a little bit of milk to the frosting. I also added more honey [then said] and, everyone is loving them! There is only one left, and I made them last night! You won't regret making them!"
"1","5","mmmm"
"1","5","the bomb"
"1","2","They looked really good and had normal brownie texture but left a bad powdery after taste. What did I do wrong?"
"1","5","I made these last night in the apartment that I share with three other girls, and the entire 8x8 tray was empty by noon today. I followed the recipe exactly, apart from halving the sugar in the icing, and it was perfect. Texture is a matter of personal preference, but I found these to be just right for me. I will never make brownies from a mix again."
"1","5","Easy, and delicious!"
"1","5","Awesome!!! Just listen to the top reviews. Don't overmix or bake, and there is nothing cake like about these incredible melt in your mouth brownies."
"1","1","All I could taste was the butter in the brownies. The recipe called for butter I used sweeten salted butter. I'm disappointed."
"1","5","These are really good brownies! I did tweek it a little bit. I put less butter but added a small amount of milk to lower the fat from the butter. Great recipe over all!"
"1","5","Fabulous brownies!! I've never made the frosting but these brownies are perfect when baked in a 9' x 9' pan."
"1","5","These brownies are wonderful! I have been looking for a chewy brownie recipe and this is it. I did double the recipe and it worked fine. I was a little worried because they were very bubbly up until the end. Also, I live in high altitude so I used 1/2 the recommended baking powder and added a little more butter."
"1","5","This recipe is great. You can't go wrong. I even melted a block of chocolate and mixed it in with the mix before baking and it made it maybe slightly more cakey, but delicious. Really a great recipe, thanks! Oh yeah, double the recipe because everyone will want some!"
"1","1","Too cake like."
"1","5","Great basic brownie recipe. Although, maybe I'm a fatty or something, but this is not 16 servings! Maybe 16 toddler sized servings.. I should really triple the recipe next time. Also, I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about with the yearn for a 'hard and chewy' brownie. That sounds terrible, and nothing like any brownie I'd ever want."
"1","5","The title of this recipe says it all! They are truly the best brownies I ever had, let a lone made. They are very moist, a little chewy and totally chocolaty. Not cake like at all. I added a few milk chocolate chunks in mine and they turned out great!! The frosting is really worth the extra few minutes to whip up as well. My boyfriend took a batch for an office party and he is now known as the brownie king!!! Will definately make these again, and again and again!!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe as it is a keeper!"
"1","5","Easy, I had everything I needed on hand and they're delicious. Made two double batches so I can take one to a bake sale and keep one for us! Did not make the frosting as I had to cut and wrap a pan for individual sale but tossed a handful of milk chocolate chips on top before baking. We will certainly be making these again, probably quite soon!"
"1","4","Our teenage daughter made these for family night treat the other night. They were very good and easy for her to make. wonderful recipe."
"1","5","Easy and delicious. I didn't make the frosting but I think I will next time. I also made it exactly as the recipe is written and I yielded 9 small brownies (I don't know why 9!) Anyway, I'd probably double the recipe."
"1","5","Fantastic! I didn't make the glaze for the top but I did add some peppermint flavor to the batter. Perfect combo of both cake and fudge texture in one brownie. I have found my base recipe!"
"1","5","I just made these brownies ...they smelled sooo good baking that i had to try one before they were cool.They are VERY yummy.However,I did not read the reviews before making them - the frosting didnt turn out for me...it was more like a thick paste and was very hard to spread.I ended up putting them back in the oven as it was still warm to loosen the frosting a little bit...it is still thick but tastes wonderful.Next time I make these I will use suggestions from the other reviews and melt the butter and half the confectioners sugar."
"1","5","I just made these today and they were wonderful! Didn't make the frosting. I think they taste just like a mix - yum! I followed the previous advice and did not use a mixer and simply whisked everything by hand instead. Very good, will make again!"
"1","2","came out a bit too bready"
"1","4","Great Brownies...Had to convince the family that small brownies are just as good and not quite as fattening though. The frosting worked great, I always tend to ruin the frosting but this came out great.( I did use splenda instead of sugar )"
"1","3","These are pretty good, but the name of the best brownies just really let me down. They do have good flavor, but they don't have the yummy chocolate fudgy flavor I love from brownies."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe exactly as is. Utterly delectable moist and delicious brownies."
"1","5","I have to say, Ive never thought about homemade brownies, but when I didn't have any to make I went looking... tried this and it is wonderful!! My husband said, ' don't make it out of a box ever'. Even my 17 month old said 'MMMM'. I will try it again."
"1","5","These brownies turned out really GREAT! I only made the brownies and didn't make the frosting. They are sweet and chewy and I didn't feel they needed any added sweetness. If you don't over stir the batter and don't over bake them they will turn out perfect."
"1","4","I doubled the recipe but decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used 3 eggs. I did not make the frosting. I substituted cocoa powder for flour when preparing the pan. They were very good. Not cakelike--moist and delicious. Looked much like the primary photo."
"1","5","These are my second favorite brownies! I LOVE them!!! Very easy to make. Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!!"
"1","5","Wonderful! Followed the recipe to the T (but we did add a few handfuls of semisweet chips) and they came out delightfuly sweet! We did not cook them all the way so they were really chewy and melt in your mouth."
"1","5","I left off the frosting altogether and I took them out of the oven at about 22 minutes. Perfection!"
"1","5","This recipe is amazing. I doubled to brownie recipe, not the icing. Before I put the icing on I heated it up for 30 seconds and it covered them completely. Very easy to prepare, short baking time (20 minute), tastes AMAZING. Will be making these many more times! I even got it right the first time, which is rare for me!"
"1","5","These brownies came out great! They were fudgy and moist. I mixed them by hand as suggested by another reviewer. I also added some hershey kisses with almonds to the battery. It was delicious! I will def make these again."
"1","5","OMG is all I can say... these turn into perfect brownies every time and anyone who says they are 'cakey' is doing something wrong. I have tried many but always come back to this one. The only thing I will say is that they don't need any icing at all, they are sweet enough!!!! Enjoy"
"1","5","i think they probably taste good"
"1","4","I had to change my review! Straight from the oven, these brownies did taste cake-like and very light on the flavour. But, my third taste an hour later was a totally different taste. The consistency changed to the thick, fudgy dessert I was looking for. I used a hand mixer, I cooked for 27 min. (in Italy, our ovens seem to need extra time), I skipped the frosting...and it still was delicious. Great as a first attempt at homemade brownies! As difficult as it seems, these brownies need some time b/t oven and eating for the best taste!!"
"1","3","Great promise for flavor, but just too sponge like for me. The batter was really promising but just didn't have the final flavor when cooked. I was really hoping for a brownie that stood on it's own. Better luck to everyone else!"
"1","5","These are great! I didn't bother making the frosting; I never see any need to frost brownies. If you're careful not to over-beat the batter, these aren't cake-like at all. They're dense and chewy, just as brownies should be. My boyfriend, an incredibly picky eater who's never been a fan of box brownies, loved these. I'll be making these often. UPDATE: Oddly enough, I find that these brownies seem to be much denser and fudgier the day after you make them. I made a big batch and put the leftovers in the fridge overnight, and ate them cold the next day...and, oh my God, they were AMAZING."
"1","5","I bake a lot and I'm a tough critic when it comes to baked goods. I thought these were wonderful. I added a little more cocoa than the recipe called for and I took them out shortly before the 25 minutes was up so they would be 'fudgy'. This is a very good recipe for your basic brownie. (I didn't make the icing--I had some leftover homemade icing from a birthday cake so I used that.) I will also add that I doubled the recipe and put them in a 9 x 13 pan and baked for just under 25 minutes. If these come out 'cakey' you baked them too long."
"1","5","What a simple great brownie recipe. They turned out super moist, very fudgey and even better not too sweet!"
"1","3","Despite mixing everything by hand to avoid whipping in too much air, mine turned out too cakey. However, if you like cake-like brownies, these may be great for you."
"1","5","My first time making brownies from scratch and the recipe was so easy to follow. Resulted in delicious brownies even without the frosting =)"
"1","5","These truly are the best brownies! I served them for a Labor Day BBQ we had with a couple of friends and everyone loved them! My boyfriend and his best friend both said they were the best brownies they ever had! I served them with some cookies and cream ice cream with hot fudge on top. As far as the recipe goes, I followed a suggestion to add more cocoa powder, so I added a little less than 1tbsp more. I made 1 and a half batch for a small roasting-type pan (it fits in my toaster oven, if that gives you any reference for size). They were the perfect thickness and I baked them for 24 minutes exactly (I kept a close eye - I didn't wanna screw up my very first batch of brownies! I would maybe take off one minute next time, for more 'fudginess') I will use this recipe for every time I make brownies in the future -- I highly recommend this recipe! Don't overstir or overbake, and it's okay if they seem underdone before you take them out -- they'll have that 'fudge' center!"
"1","5","oh wow... so decadent and delicious!! it made a very fudgy, moist divinely chocolatey brownie! a bit thin, but then again if it had been deeper i don't think it would have cooked properly and it likely would have been too rich to eat. i will be making it again for my family to try! a must try with 'brownie frosting' from this site!"
"1","5","Ok, I admit it - I crave brownies when I'm pregnant. Lots of them. I thought I'd give a new recipe a try this time and WOW. Long story short, I'm one happy lady. My family doesn't mind them either, IF they can get one."
"1","5","I could not resist taking these to the next level- Sprinkled 1/4 bag of semi sweet chips over the batter. Then I made a cream cheese fill- block of cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, and an egg. Swirled the cream cheese mix across the top. Ended up adding 5 minutes to the baking time- wonderful and easy!"
"1","5","Terrific brownies! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!"
"1","5","LOVE this recipe! Definately a keeper. Made these last night & my kids could not stop eating them. They kept raving on how delicious and yummy they were. They were all gone by the morning. Can't wait to bake some more. This time, I'm gonna double the recipe!:)"
"1","5","excellent brownie recipe, quick and easy. For a little more flavor, instead of vanilla I added about 3 TBSP of coffee mixed with some Kahlua. Gives it a nice flavor without being too overpowering, and doesn't significantly change the consistency of the batter."
"1","5","Very good, moist and chocolaty!"
"1","5","I loved this brownie recipe definitely a keeper, i made them a week ago and loved it. i didn't have sugar so i used honey, i used wheat flour,and olive oil in place of butter. they turned out great. don't over bake them, i didn't but i know a lot of people have a tendency to over bake when they push the center in. just stick a tooth pick,they'll come out clean and let them cool for like 5 -10 minutes and they're ready to eat. great with ice cream. thanks! today i will try adding peanut-butter in place of the cocoa powder, hope it goes well. oh and this recipe is 100 times better then One-Bowl Brownies, those come out nasty ever time i make them."
"1","5","EXCELLENT BROWNIES!! They tasted sooooo delicious!! LOVED the texture and the taste! Will definitely make again and again! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","2","Lets just say i made the recipe. flavor was pretty good. Baked them for 25 minutes, so they wouldn't come out cakelike which they didn't. However I do they theres way too much butter in this recipe. I have had much better homemade brownies. and I would perfer to make storebought again over these. I will keep looking for a better recipe for homemade brownies with less butter and perhaps less sugar. and perhaps a little more flour so the recipe makes more."
"1","5","These turned out great! I added a tablespoon of milk to the frosting because it was very powdery and not coming together, it worked! My boyfriend loves them!"
"1","4","This is my first time baking. The brownies came out so tasty and nice!! The only problem was that I had hard edges and base. The centre was perfect! Any common mistake that causes hard edges?"
"1","5","Simple and delicious, just the way I like it! I have even made them using rice flour and they are still absolutely fantastic......a great and rare treat for people who cant eat wheat/gluten because they are even as good as the original recipe!"
"1","4","Made these last night and they turned out really good. I took the advice of several reviewers and only mixed it as much as necessary, batter was a little lumpy, and they turned out really nice. Not cakey at all."
"1","5","Really yummie and very easy. Very similar to another brownie recipe here, so I generally make one of the two. I cut down on the sugar a little to make them less sweet. Wonderful recipe! I haven't made the frosting yet, they are great without, but maybe one of these days I'll try it."
"1","5","Hands down the BEST brownies! Make sure you don't over cook them though. I have made this recipe 3 times and each time the max cook time has been 2o mins."
"1","5","Really heavy chocolate taste! Easy to make."
"1","4","A good, easy recipe. Added 1 melted square of bittersweet chocolate to batter for more intense flavor. Baked for 20 minutes then cooled completely. Didn't need frosting!"
"1","5","I chose these because I was jonesing for brownies but was feeling too lazy to work hard for them. This recipe was quick and very simple. When they first came out of the oven I didn't like them as much as I had hoped I would. Just your average brownies. But the next day when they had cooled they were fantastic! My roommates and I downed them in a very short amount of time. Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","These are so good. I cut the sugar in half and only added half the icing. Like someone mentioned before, they are somewhere in the middle of fudgy- cakey brownies. Will be making this again ALOT."
"1","5","OMG! These were awesome. I took them to work today for my coworkers and they ate them up. I didn't even get one, lol! Awesome. I will never buy box brownies again...ever. YUM."
"1","5","Hhhhmmm good! The first time I made them I added an extra tablespoon of vegetable oil and they were perfect! Second time I didn't added the oil and they were a bit cakey. Third time I added the veg. oil and once again perfect brownies. Better than any I've ever had!"
"1","5","To whoever has written that these brownies are bad, dry, flat, crunchy and so on - you are 100% wrong. If you are getting results like this your baking it or making it improperly somehow. I've made these about 5 times now, and every time they come out perfect, delicious and chocolatey!! I always add pecans though, because in my opinion you can't have a great brownie without pecans."
"1","4","Easy to make. Taste good. They satisfied my chocolate/sweet craving with the little ingredients I had on hand. I suspect they'll taste even better in the morning after cooling overnight. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that they didn't wow me. But it's certainly a keeper recipe."
"1","5","Excellent brownie with a fudgy center. I baked them about 22 mins. and they were perfect. I used a metal pan which may alter the baking time. I did not make the frosting. I used very good quality cocoa and the flavor was great. I've also used them as a base for home-made vanilla ice cream, choc syrup and whipped cream. What's not to like! :-) This recipe is a keeper. I might add 1 TBS. espresso next time per the suggestion of one reviewer as that sounds interesting. Thanks!"
"1","1","Icing didnt turn out, it looked and tasted better raw!!. Brownies forgot to come out of the pan when we put flower at the bottom of the pan. Brownies ended up crunchy, So take my advise and use another recipie"
"1","1","These were not to my liking. I took TheSpicelands advice and used applesauce instead of butter and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. they came out underdone and never seemed to get fully cook. both that and the icing were too bitter (from the cocoa powder). i do not know what i did wrong but i followed the recipe exactly and they didn't taste good."
"1","5","i double the recipe but left out an egg and stayed the same amout of salt, just like what the other viewer said. i think leave it out for one night is more tasty and fudgy :) this recipe is really great..caz i dont have any chocolate..and this recipe doesnt request for it"
"1","5","great recipe!"
"1","5","These were fantastic! I'll have to make at least 2 batches next time as they were immediately devoured by my entire family. I did use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa for both the brownies and frosting and it was super rich! I know I would have loved it with regular cocoa too though. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","3","I was very disappointed in these brownies. I know that over mixing can ruin brownies so I was careful to only stir until the dry ingredients were just combined. This still turned out a bit too 'cakey' for our tastes. I also didn't think that they were sweet enough, although I admit I like my brownies so rich I can only eat a very small square so take that into consideration :) I also had trouble with the whites from the eggs not mixing into the batter well. When they were done there was even a big chunk of egg white cooked right there on top that I had to cut out. I even beat the eggs lightly before adding them. I think I will try another brownie recipe next time but I won't rule out trying these again in the future. Egg whites and cake-like texture aside, these were still OK and I'm sure they will get eaten by someone in the house."
"1","5","Wonderful brownies. I took some advice from the other reviews. Beat the eggs before adding. Stir the mixture, don't beat with a mixer. For the frosting, melt the butter first. Only use 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar."
"1","5","Both my husband and my six year old said these were the best brownies ever. Pretty high praise from my husband (who is a much better cook than I). Only tweak I made was to use Dutch Processed Cocoa and added a half-teaspoon of espresso powder. Awesome - just don't work the batter too much to keep them chewy and don't over-bake."
"1","4","these were very good! I didn't have the right size pan so they were a little thicker than I would have liked but otherwise very good."
"1","5","I make these brownies any time I need a chocolate fix! I usually make them without frosting, and they're delicious! When I made the frosting it turned out pretty crumbly so I had to add 1 tablespoon of milk and it turned out perfectly!"
"1","5","These brownies are the best!! They are so easy and tasty. If you decide to double the recipe, just add 3 eggs, otherwise it ends up more like chocolate cake. Which is also good, but it's not a brownie!"
"1","2","cakey, the top didnt look like a brownie, they lacked flavor and seemed tough"
"1","5","i was thrilled on how fast this came together and how fantastic they were. I think I would need to double (or even triple), the recipe for the simple fact that they just disappear way too fast. the one that i was able to stash away for the next day was even better!! I did not make the frosting because i feel a good brownie, doesnt need frosting and these didnt!!"
"1","5","Delicious! And SUPER easy. None of that 'dry ingredients in one bowl and wet in another and then combine'...everything in 1 pot! I added some reese's mini peanut butter cups to the top because...well, just because :)"
"1","5","Great recipe...exact same one as on the Hershey's Web-site...."
"1","5","Best brownies I've ever made! I used evaporated cane juice for the white sugar."
"1","3","I was very bummed that these did not turn out as I had hoped. I substituted brown sugar for the white and applesauce for the eggs, so that may have been the problem. I cooked them for about 27 minutes and they were still under-done. Definitely will not be making this recipe again."
"1","5","These are wonderful brownies! I made a double batch and baked in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes. I used 1/2C butter and 1/2C applesauce. I also substituted half of the eggs with egg beaters and they were still so good!! I frosted the brownies with one batch of the 'brownie frosting' recipe off this site. These are definitely better than the box mixes."
"1","5","Perfect as is! I loved the texture and flavor. Our second round with these brownies, I added white chocolate chips. The fell to the bottom of the pan and made for a great layer -these are awesome!!"
"1","5","These are so easy to make and absolutely delicious. Got raves from everyone 4th of July. I did add chopped walnuts, and didn't bother with the frosting. And remember to not over-bake."
"1","5","These were absolutely amazing! My 6 year old helped me make them and they were gone within an afternoon!"
"1","5","These were really simple and very good. I didn't make the frosting ... seemed like overkill. They turned out perfectly ... not too cakey, not too fudgy. I hand-mixed as suggested. They turned out great. Yum!"
"1","5","Wow. First time making brownies from scratch and I'll never go back (unless my husband begs, but he hasn't tried these yet). I may have underbaked mine a little in fear of over baking but I like them fudgy so no big deal. I also didn't have as much vanilla as I thought so had to use 1 tsp almond extract (I doubled the recipe & used 13x9 pan). These are melt in your mouth delicious!"
"1","4","These were good but the frosting was just too sweet. If you can handle the rich sweet taste this recipe is great!"
"1","3","These were OK.. but not my favorite. Everyone in our house really enjoys the dense chewy fudge-like brownies, and this recipe was more on the 'flavored like fudge brownies but textured like cake' side. Very easy for my daughter to help me make in the kitchen and the icing tasted OK... But, next time I will keep my eye out for the chewy fudge brownies we all enjoy. Thanks for the recipe though! :)"
"1","5","These brownies are truely wonderful and very, very rich! I loved the frosting as well. To cut the richness, I served with drizzeled raspberry preserves (just a personal preference.) Simple to make and hardly no mess! Love, love, love!!! Thanks for the great recipe - I will never use a box mix again!"
"1","5","These are DELICIOUS I don't know how anybody could say they are dry and cake like unless they messed up making them. They are so moist and fudgy I will never make box brownies again!"
"1","5","These are SO good! I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added semi sweet and white chocolate chips to the mix since I didn't feel like making frosting. They were gone quickly. I wish I had more. I'll double it next time."
"1","5","I followed this recipe almost to a tee the only thing I altered was I added about 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and I did not top with the frosting since I'm not big on frosted brownies. However, these were soooo easy to make and so delicious!!! followed others advice and mixed with a spoon just until wet and they were perfect!"
"1","5","Best Brownies I've ever had!"
"1","5","Big hit at the neighbors summer cookout."
"1","3","These were just ok. I skipped the topping and just made the brownies. They were a great texture, but could have used less sugar and more cocoa."
"1","5","I have been looking for the perfect brownie recipe for the last year....I believe I have found it!! I will make this recipe from now on. I followed recipe exactly - except had to add a splash of milk to the frosting. A keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","These were great! I didn't add the frosting and had no complaints! I would recommend doubling this recipe!"
"1","5","I love these brownies. I follow the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Except you do need to lick the spoon once the brownies are in the oven. : )"
"1","3","i dont know why people are saying these are fudgy. ive tried these 4 times and every time they are airy and cake-like, dry out quickly, and not much flavor. i like super dense and fudgy. i have always followed the recipe exactly, too."
"1","5","This brownies were excellent. Not too sweet. I loved the frosting as well, tasted just like store bought frosting. They didn't taste as good the next day, were a little dry. I think I will be making these again."
"1","5","These brownies are amazing! My husband and I added semi-sweet chocolate chunks. Because it was going to be really rich with the chunks we decided not to make the frosting (but I am sure it is amazing)"
"1","2","I was very disappointed in the way these brownies turned out. The taste was good, but contrary to the description and other reviews, they were not fudgy at all; too cake-like for me. I could actually tell that they would not be what I was expecting when pouring the batter into the pan. I ended up making another batch using a recipe that I should have used in the first place. That one uses oil, 1 egg, baking soda and about double the cocoa; those turned out fudgy and delicious, just the way I like them. This batter looks a lot like the batter you would get from boxed brownie mix. I'll definitely be sticking to my tried and true fudgy homeade brownies."
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly apart from, for the frosting, I used golden syrup instead of honey (which made no difference) The brownies were lovely. I made some with frosting, some without (both tasted good so make what you prefer) and they were soooo good. Will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","1st time: The best 'from scratch brownies' that I've made so far. (But I also haven't made too many.) 2nd time: Cooking time gets funny when you double it in a 9x13. Parts in the middle were slightly soggy, but I was afraid of over baking the outer part of the brownies."
"1","5","very good, this is almost exactly the same recipe as the 'Best Brownies' on Hershey's website. The only difference is they have the option to add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts into the mix. and the topping is the same except its 1 tablespoon honey or light corn syrup, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1-2 tbsp milk as needed. I made it without the topping but I may try it next time. My husband thought they weren't sweet enough, although I thought they were fine. Also, I used a glass pie dish instead of a square pan."
"1","5","So good! Everyone asks me to make these now! I cheated and used the 'perfect brownie' pan too! So yummy and perfect!"
"1","5","These are AMAZING!! I followed the recipe exactly as written, but omitted the frosting because I wanted them for brownie sundaes. If you want the brownie 'texture' avoid using a mixer, it is worth the extra time time mix it by hand!! These truly are the 'Best Brownies'!"
"1","5","Very sweet but oh so good. Might have to use less sugar or something...did I mention it is SWEET?  Made it again for a get together and everyone loved it."
"1","5","These are great. They don't make much, though, so I just doubled the recipe, added a tad of confectioner's sugar (cuz I have a huge sweet tooth), and put some semi-sweet chocolate chips in. Take them out just before they're baked all the way through, and you have some seriously delicious fudgy brownies!! (Oh, and I didn't make the frosting, just in case you thought I was going overboard with the sweet. I just don't like to mix frosting and brownies)."
"1","3","These were just okay. I was careful not to overmix or overbake. The texture was kind of fudgy, but there was also something weird about the it. The only thing I can compare it to is soft tofu; I think it was the eggs. They tasted okay, but I think brownies made with oil taste better. I won't be making these again. **Update** The texture was better the next day (more like a traditional fudgy brownies) but I still wasn't crazy about the flavor."
"1","5","LOVE THESE BROWNIES!!!! I never tried putting honey in frosting before, but it was a huge hit!"
"1","5","Oh my god! Thats what I said as i took my first bite! These brownies are 'Bangin'!' I am in 8th grade and I made these for our '8th Grade American Food Day!' they were an instant hit I highly reccomend these!"
"1","5","These really are the quintessential brownie, and I'm usually a fan of the boxed brownie mix. They are very fudgy and moist, not cakey at all, or dry like another recipe I've made from scratch. This makes just enough to fill an 8x8 pan halfway, so if you want 13x9 you probably have to double it. The only changes I made were to the frosting, I only had salted butter left and no honey, so I substituted corn syrup. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla and added a tiny bit of milk. I topped with slivered almonds to make it a little fancy :) I'm not really into frosted brownies so I'm interested to see how these turn out with some cream cheese or chocolate chunks on top."
"1","5","Super good!!!! Texture is a little more like a cake, but taste is pure yummy brownie!"
"1","5","These are the best brownies!! I have been using this recipe for seven or eight years now, and I will never, ever go back to brownies-in-a-box! (The icing is fab too -- I have used it over and over again, and not just with brownies!!)"
"1","5","These brownies are the best I have ever made. I have always claimed that the boxed brownies were so good--why bother making them from scratch. I won't be making that argument again!"
"1","5","Incredible browies. I add marshmellows to the frosting."
"1","5","MMMmmm good and so easy to make. I recommend doubling the recipe as they do not last long. Had to bake mine about 8 minutes longer, also sprinkled pecans on the top and they do not need frosting."
"1","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had. Next time I will make a double batch like others had suggested."
"1","4","Had a brainstorm, and added semi sweet chips. Then frosted them with a thin layer of Nutella. Oh My God, I thought I died and went to heaven!!!!"
"1","5","Really Good Brownie! I have been competing with myself to find a brownie that rivals Betty Crocker, and this one does. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","It's actually my first time to bake brownies from scratch. And I'm quite new at baking, too.I say this recipe is soo easy to make the first time. I baked mine for about 21 minutes and it came out perfect! These brownies are amazing!! They were exactly what I was looking for. Soft, chewy and chocolaty. Everyone loved it!! I did exactly what the recipe said, and the reviews were very helpful too!! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"1","5","We really liked these brownies! They are fudgy, and a little goes a long way. I did have a problem with the frosting because it wouldn't spread. Maybe I should have melted the butter or thinned it out. It doesn't matter because the taste was great!"
"1","5","These brownies are sooo tasty!!"
"1","5","LOVE THIS. Seriously could never by box mix (or store made for that matter) brownies ever again. My husband who normally does not like brownies actually asked for two!"
"1","5","There are not words to describe these decadent little pieces of ooey gooey fudgy heaven! Yes they are so simple and basic but some times simple is better! My icing was a bit too thick so I thinned it out with some Kahlua!"
"1","5","I love this recipe. It is fast, easy and does not create a load of dishes to wash. And as for the taste, they are perfect. I never frost my brownies so I can not comment on the frosting part of this recipe. I do not understand the comments about cake-iness. I don't get that at all from this recipe. I make loads and pop them in the freezer. That is the only way I can keep a triple batch from disappearing within 24 hours."
"1","5","another reviewer recommended when doubling the recipe leave out an egg and keep the salt 1/4 tsp. It worked and they came out fantastic. If you don't do this your brownies will come out like cake. I also had to bake it about 10 mins longer and the inside was still gooey but by the time they finished cooling off it came out fine."
"1","5","Wonderful! Very easy to make. Were very popular at a church picnic I made them for."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! They are fabulous without the icing! I followed the previous suggestion of doubling the recipe minus one egg...perfect!"
"1","5","These brownies are AWESOME! Fudge-a-licious! One problem I had was with the frosting.. I spread it as much as I could and I topped it once again with a quick layer of confectioner's sugar. Deee-lish! Cant wait to make them again and again!"
"1","5","I just made these again and this time I used only half a cup of confectioners' sugar for the icing. The icing was richer and more wet, the type that stays wet instead of solidifying. I liked it much better, the whole thing was more fudgey instead of so cake-like. Thus I am upping my review to 5 stars - these taste amazing and are easy to make."
"1","5","I made these exactly as directed (but used self rising flour instead of the all-purpose w/ salt & baking powder) for my husband's birthday. He absolutely LOVED them - giving them 10 out of 10! I baked them in a 8x8 square glass pan & they needed the full 30 minutes. I also frosted them while warm as directed which made the icing melt like ginache - but maybe that was the idea? I prefer my icing/frosting UNmelted - but super chewy, rich & good regardless!"
"1","2","I wasnt too crazy about these brownies. The frosting never got to spreading consistincy so I had to add a few drops of milk to it. The brownies werent the right texture to me. Ill stick to the Brooke's bombshell brownie recipe!"
"1","5","Better than any others! That's all I can say about them! A must make over and over again! UPDATE: Still making them...this is a keeper recipe!"
"1","2","THIS IS CAKE! Good flavor, but it was NOT fudgey or chewy! I wish I read previous reviews on this recipe because one review said the same things. I did double the recipe and other reviews say when you double this recipe take out an egg. I wish I listened to them because I'm supposed to bring brownies to a party tomorrow and all I have to show for it is an okay tasting chocolate cake. The frosting however, is DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","The name describes it all !!! But since I am not a sweet tooth, I had reduced the amount of sugar used, to just 170g. Thank you for the recipe!"
"1","5","I made with dark chocolate powder and it was super yummy! I think I will try to make them better for you with applesauce and Splenda as another reviewer suggested because I so ate like 5 of them."
"1","5","These brownies were phenomenal! Any bad reviews, must just not have done something right?? Mine turned out very fudge-ish, but I undercooked them a bit on purpose for that very reason. If they were cooked through, they would be somewhere between fudgey and maybe cakey, but so delightful! There was a ton of frosting which I love, but husband does not, so I just glazed it over the top. I recommend with any brownie recipe that you use a fork and not a blender (will always turn out more cake-like with a blender). I also did beat the eggs first and put them in that way. Overall a fantastic recipe that I will use over and over!"
"1","5","I am NOT a baker but you just can't go wrong with this recipe! It's so easy & oh so good. I took the advice of others & didn't use a mixer. Instead, I just hand mixed it with a fork. I baked it for 25 minutes & they were perfect. I didn't make the frosting either, didn't need it at all!"
"1","5","Healthy substitutions: I replaced one of the eggs with a tablespoon of ground flax seeds/3 tbs of water and it worked great. I also replaced some of the butter with applesauce and used part white whole wheat flour."
"1","5","Wow!!! Made this exactly as instructed. The whole family LOVED these. I was skeptical on the frosting but, it was a perfect touch!"
"1","5","These are easy and delicious. Melted the butter and added 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup organic coconut palm brown sugar to that while slightly whipping the eggs (suggestion of redzinner). Mixed the white wheat flour (had no all purpose) with the baking powder, salt, 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, and 1/2 cup cocoa. Added the eggs and vanilla to the melted butter/sugar mixture and then gently incorporated the dry ingredients. Used Baker's Joy spray in place of grease and flour for the pan and baked in a 9x9 for about 20 minutes (next time will use the suggested 8x8, as the brownies were a little thin). Did not frost as have never really cared for frosted brownies. Yummy"
"1","5","I have been making these for years! For all those people who say they are terrible...you are CRAZY! You must have used a mixer...that will make them turn out like cake! Mix by hand and they should be a thicker batter. My recipe calls for slightly different measurements, but very close. These are the BEST brownies I have ever made and I don't ever buy them in a box! Try these, don't use a mixer, use good old fashioned elbow grease! It's not that difficult to mix together anyway. Enjoy!!!"
"1","5","This is my new favorite brownie recipe. I make no modifications except sometimes add some chocolate chips or marshmallows. Try this out!"
"1","5","These were amazing! Followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect and very simple to make. I did stick my frosting in the microwave for about 20 seconds just to make it easier to spread over the top of the brownies."
"1","3","i think that they could be better. i love to cook and they were even to sweer for my taste buds"
"1","3","These were okay but they were too cakey for me. I was expecting them to be more gooey and they weren't chocolatey enough for me either."
"1","4","These brownies were very good! I had to add a tablespoon or so of milk to make the frosting into something resembling frosting - until I did that, it was just a crumbly mess. Excellent flavor, though!"
"1","5","I really love this wonderful desert as tit is the best"
"1","5","Instead of making the frosting I used Nutella for the frosting and also topped it with chopped hazelnuts,,, YUM!"
"1","5","This is the same recipe for Best Brownies on the Hershey's website. These are awesome just wish they were a bit thicker is all I used my 8x8 square dish. They turned out great and I used a pyrex dish! I think the trick is to make sure the pan is coated well. I heard someone else say they made their own cake release using equal parts of oil shortening and flour works great for me and cheaper than bakers joy. For that post about brownies should be hard and chewy that's only stale brownies! A brownie is moist a fudgy and that is what these are."
"1","5","Amazing!!! Delish!!!! I made as the recipe said, except for two very minor changes. I cooked these in a glass pan, so I lowered the oven temp. to 325 degrees, but baked them for the same amount of time the recipe called for (30 min.). I also added a tiny bit of water to the frosting so it would mix easier."
"1","4","The brownies are easy to whip up, delicious, warm, fudgy, the whole nine yards. I make the frosting and always have to add water because the frosting is powdery. Then, there's way too much frosting that goes to waste. Delicious and I will never go back to boxed brownies"
"1","3","I'm having a problem with this recipe at 5,000 feet. I've made them twice. They taste great, but the middle never seems to get quite done and it's always sunken in, despite cooking longer than the directions call for. If I try this again I will add more flour and see if that helps. Also, don't skip the icing - it really makes this recipe. I added a few bits of dark chocolate, too and that adds a nice touch."
"1","5","These brownies were so good, we made 3 batches in one week! I underbake them by at least 10 minutes and add a little extra butter and cocoa because we like them really chocolatey and really gooey!"
"1","3","After reading all the great reviews I had high hopes for this recipe. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. We like chewy brownies and even after one day they weren't. They were OK but a bit light on chocolately flavor. May try this again and 'doctor' it a bit but not the best brownies ever."
"1","5","i am a novice in the kitchen, and baking is still very new to me. to my surprise and delight, these came out fantastic, i will be making these again and again! great with or without the frosting."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! I tried them when they were warm, right after putting on the frosting. The flavor was an overwhelming taste of unsweetened cocoa, i was worried they hadnt turned out very well. However, after trying them the next day, i LOVED them. The flavors had evened out nicely. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!"
"1","1","If you want to make this recipe with a pyrex square dish...DON'T! IT WON'T TURN OUT AT ALL!!! It came nowhere close to being a brownie or cake or anything edible, waaaaay tooo soft, even after 30 minutes."
"1","5","I make these all the time now, and everyone always tells me how AWESOME they are! Here's what I do: I double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan, but only use 3 eggs (instead of 4). I use half white and half whole wheat flour, substitute half of the butter with applesauce, and increase the vanilla to 1 tablespoon. I also cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups since the applesauce is sweet. I mix the dry ingredients in a big bowl. I melt the butter in a pot on the stove, then add the rest of the wet ingredients to that, beating the eggs separately first. Then I pour the wet mixture into the bowl and mixt well. I don't bother with the icing, but I usually sprinkle M&Ms or something on top. I can put them together in 15 minutes now, and they are in the oven for 25 minutes."
"1","5","My brownies NEVER turn out right, but these did! And everyone loved them! Frosting turned out a little wonky but... that might just be me."
"1","5","LOVE THESE BROWNIES!! If you want a good dessert, this one is way worth the calories!"
"1","4","Delicious! I gave it 4 stars because though the recipe says 16 servings I couldn't have squeezed 16 brownies out of this if I'd tried! My brownies tasted great but came out flat...followed exact so not sure what happened there..."
"1","5","I know there already over 2000 reviews for this recipe, but I just had to add my own comment. These brownies are the best I have ever had in my entire life. I followed the recipe to a T. I mixed all the ingredients with a wooden spoon, in fact I just used a larger saucepan to melt the butter and just mixed everything in the saucepan. I baked for 27 minutes and they came out perfect. I was afraid the brownies would end up too fudgey (which I don't like), but they came out perfect, neither too fudgey or too cake-like, just smack in between. I skipped out on the frosting. Wouldn't change a single thing in this recipe."
"1","4","Delicious brownies! I did make a substitution though. I unfortunately didn't have enough unsweetened cocoa powder, so I just melted 1/2 cup of simi-sweet chocolate chips with the butter. Because the chocolate chips have sugar I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Also I baked for 25 minutes. Let it cool a little before serving otherwise it may be too gooey. The brownies turned out a little thin so I may double the recipe next time."
"1","5","These are fabulous! I always have the ingredients in the pantry, so it's no problem to whip them up whenever I need a chocolate fix. The only problem I have is that they always have lots of little airholes on the top (I know, be careful about overmixing - that isn't the problem) which don't bother me but my husband has decided is 'gross.' Luckily, you can just cover those right up with frosting!"
"1","5","they were SO GOOD. so easy to make! i recommend cooking right at 35--don't overcook, and do NOT use too much vanilla. especially if you have a strong extract. but talk about simple recipe, and all the brownies were GONE in less than a day! i made another batch to bring for a friend's birthday the next day."
"1","4","Made these yesterday afternoon as a co-worker recommended them...almost gone! Delicious!! I didn't make the frosting for them."
"1","5","*****PLEASE READ****** These brownies were not very good when I made them....they were powdery tasting. We kept them in the fridge anyway. 24 hours later we tasted them again and they were AMAZING!!!!! DELICIOUS! Let them sit a day or two. They get better everyday! I'll definitely make these again. Try using 1/2 C white sugar 1/2 C brown sugar.....this is great too!"
"1","5","I use half the butter amount (because I read the recipe wrong the first time and thought it called for 1/2 stick of butter) and it turned out perfect! I add just a little extra cocoa and a little less sugar to make them 'dark chocolate'. This is my new brownie recipe!"
"1","5","Great fudgy brownies. The only change I made was after seeing Bobbby Flay's Brownie Throw Down, I used half brown sugar and half white and I was happy with the results. For any brownie recipe, it's important not to overcook them."
"1","5","Great brownie recipe will use again."
"1","1","I was excited to make these for the first time for church as I take great pride in my baking. Think about my surprise and embarresment when I got home for my family to tell me they were not good. I had made a double batch and there were only 3 gone :("
"1","5","I have searched for a 'from scratch' brownie recipe for years and this is IT! The only thing I changed (got the tip from another review) is that I use 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. These never last in our house for more than a few hours! Thanks so much for helping to end my search. :-) To make it into a 'dessert' I put the brownie in the bottom of a bowl, add a scoop of ice cream and then add homemade carmel sauce on top of that - absolutely to DIE FOR!"
"1","5","yum yum and yum"
"1","2","Tried to make mini brownie bites with this recipe.. didn't turn out like I was expecting."
"1","3","These brownies were too chocolatey, EVEN AFTER I only put like 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. I suggest that you use about 1/4-1/8 cup of cocoa powder because it is too chocolatey.. in a bad way. but its OHKAY"
"1","5","Pretty good. Added dried cranberries and walnuts the second time and they were even better!"
"1","4","Pretty good taste, but nothing amazing. Quick, easy to make, and I had all the ingredients on hand. I will use this recipe again. :) They looked rather cake-like coming out of the oven, but were a bit chewier after they cooled."
"1","5","These were great! They were so easy to make and were exactly what I was craving tonight. I didn't make any changes to the ingredients but I did whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder in a separate bowl before adding them. I didn't want to overcook them at all, so I checked them at 15 min and they were actually done(the way I like them) at 20 min. I also didn't make the frosting. I just sprinkled chopped white chocolate chips on the batter before baking."
"1","5","Very good! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! I did take one users suggestion and stirred everything by hand (to keep it from being too cakey). These brownies aren't super sweet (which I like). I didn't make them with the frosting, and they were delicious."
"1","5","Literally impossible to mess these up! So quick and easy and DELICIOUS."
"1","5","These brownies were awesome! A keeper for sure!"
"1","5","My family thought these were the best brownies ever! I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9X13 glass pan and cooked on 350 for 30 minutes and they turned out perfect. They are very good and easy to make too!"
"1","5","Made these with my daughter this weekend. So easy and delicious. Most people would have all of the ingredients in their pantry. I will never use the boxed mix again!"
"1","2","something is wrong with this recipe. my brownies came out flat. i followed it correctly, but something went wrong. i wouldn't recommend it."
"1","4","love these! yes, they are a bit rich, but they are GREAT with ice cream or whipped cream"
"1","5","Wonderful brownies! Turned out beautiful! Although they lost when I put them up against another brownie recipe (used melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder), they are still an exceptionally wonderful and easy to make brownie treat! I skipped the frosting, since the taste test was for just a brownie... it doesn't need anything extra on top! YUM!"
"1","5","There are many brownie recipes on this site, but I chose to try this one, never having made brownies from scratch before. My husband and I really enjoyed them! The only trouble is having the will power not to eat them all at once! BTW, I substituted spelt flour, because I try to avoid wheat. Spelt is a very similar flour to wheat and the result was great! I also tried adding chopped walnuts. With or without, the brownies are great!! (If your results are not what you expect, check your oven temperature. Also, ensure you take the pan out early enough.)"
"1","4","Very good but definitely a little more cakey than fudgy. And I didn't overbeat or use an electric mixer. I will probably keep searching for a bit of a fudgier recipe. However, these are great if you don't have any baking chocolate. These call for ingredients that I would think most people have in their pantries. Thanks!"
"1","3","Good flavor but they came out cakey, I wanted a dense brownie. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and made sure I didn't over-mix the batter, but it didn't seem to make a difference."
"1","4","This is a simple and easy recipe although.I added a lilttle of me into the cake.I add about 1/3 c of chocolate chip morsales 1/4 tsp instant coffee a extra tsp of vaniila extract.Thanks these are the best thing since box mixs brownies."
"1","5","This recipe is really really great... I have my Sister and Sis in-law asking for the recipe and even my friends whom hates baking. Basically they just order from me. Believe me, you will never stop baking bcos it's really a popular demand brownie...yum..yum"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!! and very very easy to make. love this recipe!! i didnt put the frosting on it cuz i love my brownies plain, so i cant say anything about the frosting but the brownies themselves are to die for."
"1","5","The best brownies ever! They were slightly crispy on the outside (just the top), and moist and chewy on the inside. We used Ghirardelli chocolate and instead of making the frosting, we sifted powdered sugar on top. Now that I have this recipe, I will never use a box again!!!"
"1","5","I have tried a few brownie recipe and found this one to be the best so far. They melt in your mouth. Next time I will try adding more cocoa powder or maybe dark cocoa powder for a more intense chocolate flavor, maybe that's just a personal preference of mine. Thanks for the great, easy base brownie recipe. I had everything in the kitchen for this recipe!"
"1","5","excellent!!! it's true it always turn out, just don't over bake them it or else they will turn out like cakes. my husband and i love walnuts so i add them to the brownies and it's just delicious."
"1","4","these are good. I can never quite get a cocoa based recipe to come out as rich as a melted chocolate based one...but many times I don't want to be bothered with the double boiler and melting down chocolate. This is quick easy and good. Probably the best cocoa based bownies I have tried."
"1","4","Pretty good. Instead of frosting, I sprinkled a generous layer of chocolate chips on top before baking."
"1","5","Made this recipe into brownie bites added a ganache topping with M & M's!"
"1","3","Upon reading countless 5-star reviews, I enthusiastically tried this recipe this afternoon by doubling the recipe to fit my 9x13 pan. The only changes I made were as below: - 1. Reduced butter to 1/2 cup and replaced with 1/2 cup of applesauce like others. 2. Reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cup to suit personal taste. 3. Upped cocoa powder to 1 cup. 4. Added ½ cup of chopped walnuts and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I baked mine for exactly 25 minutes and let is sit in oven for 5 minutes as advised by others. However, I was rather disappointed with the outcome as my brownies turned out to be rather hard; it turned out to be neither fudgey nor gooey at all and it was just like a hardened cake. I was very certain that I DID NOT OVERMIXED NOR OVERBAKED as I had only manually mixed dry and wet ingredients with wooden spatula for about 50 strokes as advised! Will most likely not do this again anymore..."
"1","4","A good basic recipe, would be better with dark chocolate melted into the butter or with good quality chocolate chips added. I added melted chocolate to the batter, and just grated dark chocolate on the top as it came out of the oven instead of using frosting, and it was nice, not overwhelmingly sweet."
"1","5","great also if you halve the butter, use fructose instead of sugar(halve that quantity too) and use all-purpose gluten-free flour! i also like to put marshmallows on the top:)"
"1","5","The best homemade brownies i've ever had! they're delicious, and extra fudgy."
"1","5","I'm very particular about baking recipes, but these brownies always turn out fabulous! They're quite decadent by themselves, so I always skip the frosting. The frosting is, however, a good recipe and worth keeping around for other uses. My husband's family is full of 'baking snobs' and these brownies made quite the impression."
"1","5","I usually change one of the ingredients in a recipe, but this one I kept the exact same. I did use a larger pan so they'd be smaller, and I cut them to bite-size pieces. I doubled the batch. I threw in chocolate chips in the first batch and mini reese's pieces in the second batch. Both turned out great, so sinful. Btw, this was my first attempt at brownies from scratch, and I'm not going back! Thanks!"
"1","3","I liked these but there were extremely rich/heavy. My mom could only eat a very small piece. My dad managed to finish his but that's because he likes his sweets. My husband calls these my pound cake brownies."
"1","5","Hi,greetings from germany.It´s delicious!!!! I gave 1/3 cup pecanuts within."
"1","4","I guess I should have heeded the warning that these were sweet because they were, but they were still really good. I just at a little at a time and sprinkled the crumbs on top of vanilla ice cream. I'll make these again and reduce the sugar just a little bit."
"1","5","Okay I changed a few things only because I was missing a couple ingredients. Instead of butter I used coconut oil, instead of vanilla I substituted amaretto (2 tsp) and used a small box of jello mix (orange) to replace half the sugar. I also added some powdered milk (about 1/2 cup) I totally forgot the baking powder so they didn't rise as much as they probably would have for anyone who did use it. They turned out very moist so maybe next time I'll probably just use less of the coconut oil. Very tasty though and I think adding nuts (maybe chopped pistachios?) next time I try the recipe would work great with the existing flavors. A simple and tasty brownie recipe!"
"1","5","Yep, these are Great, a family favorite. I don't make the frosting the Brownies are chocolaty enough."
"1","5","Fudgy, chewy and overall pretty good! I didn't make the frosting though, I figure that would be to much for these. They are great just as they are! =)"
"1","4","I think it's hard to beat the texture, flavor and simplicity of box-mix brownies...but this recipe is fair competition. I kept all of the ingredient amounts the same, but I chose to take a little more time to sift and mix my dry ingredients together first, then add them to the wet ingredients. I baked them just at 15 minutes and they looked great! They had the flaky top and were a good combination of fudgy/cakey. Next time I might put them in for just a little less time to make them softer. It's a keeper!"
"1","5","These brownies are amazing!!! If you don't like them, you are crazy!!!"
"1","5","Scrumptious! My kids thought I cheated and used a box mix (perish the thought). I just threw all the ingredients together in a bowl and mixed well with a wooden spoon until smooth. Comes out perfect every time!"
"1","5","These are Best Brownies!!! No fuss in making them, like others suggested I didn't use a mixer and the result was a moist, soft and rich brownie texture. I use a bag of milk chocolate chips for the frosting, just sprinkle them on when the brownies were still warm and spread. I give this recipe - two thumbs way up!!!!"
"1","4","I've made these brownies twice now, the first time I made them I followed the instructions. I'm not a big dark chocolate fan and using the amount of cocoa called for made them really rich. The texture was good though and my husband still loved them. They had that slightly crumbly top like the store bought ones. The second time I made them, I cut back the cocoa to make them not so sweet and they turned out great. Before I baked them I also melted a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter and drizzled it on top, that really added some yumminess to them. I took them to a meeting at church and everyone loved them. I will continue to use this recipe because my husband loves brownies and I don't always have boxed ones at home and these are easy to make with stuff I already have on hand. I also didn't use the frosting recipe either time and they were plenty sweet enough."
"1","4","YUMMY!!! You have to like chocolate though :)"
"1","5","Best Brownies bar none!"
"1","5","Some of the best brownies I have ever had! My boyfriend doesn't even really like sweets and he loved them!"
"1","2","These were not exactly what I was looking for. A little too soft and what I mean is I like a dense brownie with a good bite to it and these were very sugary and dissolved in your mouth."
"1","5","These brownies were so good and I didn't even make the frosting. I doubled the recipe and made a 9x13 pan."
"1","5","These brownies are always a huge hit and easy to throw together. Any baking that requires no mixer and can be completed in a sauce pan is worth a try. If you don't cook from scratch on a regular basis, don't give up if your first attempt isn't perfect, but if you follow the directions, you should be ok. Also, trust the recipe for the frosting. It takes some mixing, but then suddenly the crumbly dry mix turns into a fudge-like frosting. Then once it's all mixed, take the ball of frosting and flatten out. Once the frosting is on the cake, the heat from the cake will soften the frosting allowing you to carefully spread out to the edges of the pan."
"1","5","amazing! Ive made these several times, once as a brownies, once as cupcakes and another time as mini cupcakes. I love them. I think they're great w/o the frosting, but in general Im not a frosting lover on brownies. I just have a really hard time making them look pretty. When I made brownies I waited for them to cook before cutting into them but they really stuck to my pan. I think they best was the cupcakes, making sure to fill them only half full. I also got nervous each time because they never looked done to me. I think its because they're so gooey..in a good way. But even the times they have had a less attractive apperance, people eat them and rave about them! They're moist, chewy, have the crackle top..pretty much everything you could ever want from a brownie."
"1","5","This recipe is a favorite of mine. Sometimes I add a teaspoon of coffee to it. It's also good with peanut butter frosting on top. You might want to double this!"
"1","5","i found the frosting a bit buttery, add 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, or cut butter back to 2.5 tablespoons. the frosting takes some elbow grease to mix, but is worth it. For a yummy overload; sprinkle some Hershey's Skor Chipits on top after everything has cooled."
"1","5","Used sugar in the raw and it added the best texture. Love these."
"1","5","Absolutely amazing! Better than any bakery or store, these brownies satisfy that sweet tooth! This was my first time making them from scratch and they were so easy! Also I had to use about 6 tbsp of butter for the frosting, it was way to dry with just 3"
"1","5","I simply mixed these up by hand and they turned out great!"
"1","5","These brownies were spectacular! I will never bake from the box again! I followed the directions as read but used dark cocoa instead (i like darker chocolates) and was very happy with the results. Amazing, chewy, and just as easy as a box recipe!"
"1","3","It just wasn't the flavor I was looking for in a brownie. I think there's too much vanilla- I will try it again w/o the vanilla."
"1","5","I was looking for a good brownie recipe and this was the first one I clicked on. It turned out delicious, and didn't even need the icing. The crust was AMAZING!!! What I did do though for the icing was mix oil and butter (half + half), because I didn't have any butter left. It turned out fine but I found that the icing was hard to work with, so I put the icing on top of the (cooked)brownies and popped it in the oven for a few seconds to soften it up and it was easy to spread. Also, since I used a 9 x 9 pan, I figured it would need less time to cook so it was in the oven for about 22-23 minutes. They turned out so moist on the inside and chewy on the crust. I would definitely make them again!"
"1","5","OMG is not even reaching the top of how great these brownies are. Talk about your chocolate fix! these are so velvety, and have the perfect brownie crunch that you crave from the brownie crust. I think with the few bad talks about this recipe they must have mixed it WAY too much in the mixer. As everyone said on here hand mixing is the best and I agree strongly to do that. Also watch your cooking time because it does cook fast so dont over cook. THANKS GUYS FOR THE GREAT NOTES! With that I was able to make my first batch perfect! I have not yet tried it with the frosting, but add a touch a vanilla ice cream and major yumm."
"1","5","These are the best brownies ever! I have made these several times and they disappear instantly. The recipe is easy and uses ingredients I usually have on hand."
"1","3","The flavor of these brownies was incredible but they were way undercooked on the inside."
"1","5","Always turn out perfection!"
"1","5","My 10yr old son (Connor) has made this his specialty and has a reputation for his great brownies at every potluck! These are easy and taste great. I never use the frosting and instead sprinkle 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips over the whole thing when there is 5 mins left of baking. Then complete the baking, cool about 10 minutes before cutting. These are great, easy, and use the simplest of ingredients!!!!"
"1","5","I love these cake like brownies their delicious. although i tried the frosting and it was very sweet and strange it might be because i whip everything by hand and i didn't have enough power to whip it all together and make it perfect in look and taste. Also EVERYONE MUST TRIES THESE, DOESNT REQUIRE MUCH INGREDIENTS AND TIME. So in conclusion their perfect for a sort of quick snack to enjoy alone or with family."
"1","5","Mmm, these definitely turned out well! Sure, brownies are usually chewy and sticky, or whatnot, but these taste great anyways. I decided to make my own frosting by slicing about an 1/8 cup of butter into a saucepan, melting that into a cup of milk, and adding 1/2 cup of cocoa. The resulting sauce hardened into almost another layer of pure chocolate over the brownies - thank you for such a yummy brownie recipe."
"1","5","I don't know if these are THE best- but they're close... and easy. I did a double batch: half the batter with mint chocolate chips and the other half with toasted walnuts and white chocolate chips (the white chips fell to the bottom and stuck- need to do something about that next time). I did not make the frosting. These are very moist brownies if cooked right. I think I'm still in search of a DARK rich (but not as greasy) brownie. I think I'll try a recipe with dark chocolate chunks next time."
"1","5","Moist and awesome. I avoided thoroughly mixing, as reviews stated thorough mixing is the problem when your brownies come out too cake-like. I doubled the recipe and used only 3 eggs, instead of 4, which also kept them moist. I ran out of white sugar, so used 1 cup brown sugar. Beware of the cooking time! Even with a double batch I am so glad I checked them after only 20 minutes, as 1 minute more would have been too much. I melted the frosting and it became a lovely shiny glaze I drizzled over. Definitely a nice touch."
"1","1","Tasteless, wrong consistency."
"1","5","I have made these brownies dozens of times now and they have never failed to please. I follow the brownie recipe exactly but I omit the frosting for it makes it a bit too sweet for my tastes. If you are after that chewy, dense texture, it is a good idea to leave them in the oven for only about 20-25 minutes; the center should not be fully cooked when taken out of the oven."
"1","5","I made these brownies for work and my co-workers loved them and asked for more. Next time I will definitely double the recipe and make it in a bigger pan, because 8x8 is too small for something this good :) I thought they were slightly cakey (despite following recipe perfectly), I prefer my brownies very dense and chewy, but all I got was great feedback so this recipe is getting 5 stars."
"1","5","The name says it all. Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as stated. One thing: I think that the brownies would be equally as good with or without the frosting---if you like very sweet and rich, then frost the brownies; if you prefer a slightly less sweet taste, leave the frosting off."
"1","3","I must have done something wrong...they were flat and hard (I know over cooked)."
"1","5","This recipe was definitely quick and easy but the results show that. It is not quite as good as others I have tried. Considering I am the only one in the household that likes brownies I will use this simple recipe again for myself. (I did not make the frosting, there was no need for it.)"
"1","4","I rated this 4 stars because though it is a pure brownie, i am not a huge fan of the pure taste of cocoa. And I am not a fan of frosted brownies. I believe brownies should be sweet and chocolatey all by themselves. So i didnt add the frosting. But like I said...a little to much cocoa for my taste."
"1","5","I have made these brownies twice. Both times they came out fabulous. For me putting the frosting on about 10-20 after they come out of the oven is perfect because I believe that a little of the frosting melts and then soaks into the brownie. I also believe that when the brownies get to set up overnight they are awesome. One thing about the frosting though, I read a review that said for the frosting to melt the butter, I did that and followed the directions and it wasn't frosting so I put in maybe a quarter cup or so of milk and the frosting was fabulous. Great Recipe!"
"1","5","We loved this brownie. Made two batches of this last night and both turned out very gooey and not cakey. Doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 pan and as per other reviewer's suggestion used only 3 eggs. I mixed all the dry ingredients first, then added it to the butter mixture, careful not to overbeat. Added marsmallows and choc chips to the batter and sprinkle more choc chips before baking it. Baked for 25 minutes and very gooey and yummy. No need for frosting. This is a keeper. Thanks for this great recipe."
"1","3","Very inconsistent recipe! I am not one to write reviews, I actually just registered in order to write a review about this recipe. The first time I made these, I was in a complete rush and just through the ingredients in without reading- they turned out fabulous right at 25 minutes! The next time I made them, I had more time and followed the recipe EXACTLY. And it doesn't matter- they come out different EVERY TIME. I use the exact same pan, same oven, same technique, and I get different results every time. Sometimes good, sometimes like a chocolate cake, sometimes too fudgy. When they are good- they are good! But this can't be my go to recipe for a brownie. Just inconsistent. And I am a very experienced baker. So I'm not sure what the problem is!"
"1","4","These were good but not the best. They were a little dry and not suitable to my tastes."
"1","5","These are great. Very moist and gooey. The frosting was awesome too. Never used honey in my icing but I thought it really made it. Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","so rich, chewy, delicious! I cannot say enough about this recipe - it's fantastic! the frosting was a bit hard to spread on so i added a bit of milk."
"1","5","I have a child with a milk allergy, so I was looking for a milk-free brownie recipe using cocoa. I used the non-dairy margarine (Fleishman's unsalted), melted the margarine in the microwave, mixed the rest of the ingredients in by hand with a wisk, and followed the recipe exactly. After these cool, they are very dense and fudgy, not at all 'cake-like.' I'm not sure what to make of reviews that say otherwise, but perhaps those people should try again. We will make these again for my milk-allergy babies! Everyone in the family thought they were great, though I wish I had made a double batch."
"1","5","I loved these brownies!! I didn't make the frosting, but it didn't matter. They were super easy too. I mixed with electric mixer for a more cake like texture, and they were great!!"
"1","5","The best cocoa-powder brownie recipe I've tasted! Mixed by hand, served with a dusting of powdered sugar instead of the frosting-this recipe's a keeper. Thanks, chibi chef!"
"1","5","This is the first time I've made brownies from scratch and I will NEVER buy boxed brownies again. NO joke. I also made the icing/frosting and it was more than amazing and didn't last very long. Next time I make these I will definitely double the recipe! This one's a keeper."
"1","1","These were the worst brownies that I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe to a T, and what came out were the driest brownies in the world. They wouldn't even soak up cream which we drizzled over them in our attempt salvage them. Don't use this recipe! Best brownies my foot."
"1","4","These are really good, chewy brownies. The recipe is easy and turns out well. I didn't give it five stars, though, because something is missing for me... Not sure what, but I think i'm going to keep looking."
"1","5","These are yum!! I 'stirred' my batter by hand (don't have a mixer). The batter was thick actually and better to mix by hand and prevent the overmix problem. I mixed all the dry ingredients together before putting them into the wet ones. Baked mine for 25 min. When it just came out of the oven, it felt cakey (couldn't wait for it to cool so I had a little bite). But after it cooled, it's really chewy. I made it as the recipe calls for (skipping the frosting part) because I was trying a new recipe. I'll make a bigger batch next time. This is a really good recipe, easy and quick, and most of all, DELICIOUS!! Worth keeping!!"
"1","5","When this says the 'best' it means the 'Best'!!!! These brownies are so good and I cant wait until my husband gets home so I can surprise him with this deliciousness!!! If you tried this recipe and did not like it, you are doing something wrong or you are insane!!! ( I could understand if you don't like sweet food though as these are SUPER sweet and chocolaty) I personally was looking for a chocolaty treat so I added 1/2 a cup of cocoa instead of 1/3 and I made my own topping but they would have been good without it! I also used whole wheat flour and they still turned out DELICIOUS!!!! I am going to give this recipe to EVERYONE!!!! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYY!"
"1","1","I have to say I was so excited about this recipe because I had never made brownies from anything but a box before but I think I will stick to the box. I must of done something wrong because mine tasted like hard brown sugar! I did make some adjustments though. I doubled the recipe to make them in a 13x9 pan and left out one egg because of another review and I also used a cup of shortning with a little salt because I didnt have enough butter. I baked for 25 minutes. And YUCK! My 4 year old loved it though. HA! Go figure!If I do attempt this recipe again I will FOLLOW THE RECIPE!!!"
"1","5","These brownies are PERFECT. I made them exactly as the recipe suggested (though I did follow another reviewer's advice and halved the confectioner's sugar for the frosting) and they came out thick and delicious! My husband and I ate the whole pan in about two days. Those who said that they were too cake-like must have used an electric mixer, because I mixed by hand, and the consistency came out wonderfully."
"1","4","What I changed: increased the recipe by 1/3; 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white as opposed to only white; 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter as opposed to only butter; (just to make them a bit healthier) :-D These were good. Not better, not worse. Nothing spacial. Very ordinary."
"1","5","Perfect name for the perfect brownie recipe!"
"1","5","Absolutley yummy!!! Perfect - and easy. I did not make the frosting - they don't need it. My boyfriend doesn't want me to ever make boxed again!"
"1","5","These were VERY good brownies and so simple to make. I will be making these brownies again and never use a store bought mix ever again!"
"1","5","I have been making these brownes for a few years now. Eveyone who has ever tried them loves them! We do not even bother with the frosting! I double the batch and bake them in a 9 x 13 pan! You can't go wrong with these and they are very quick and easy!"
"1","5","Yum! Crunchy edges, soft center. 25 minutes was perfect in my oven. For the frosting be sure the butter is very soft. I added a pinch of salt and 1.5 tsp of kahlua!"
"1","3","too sugary"
"1","5","The best brownies !!!"
"1","5","Quick and easy. My husband loves them. I make them without the icing and I like to add dark chocolate chips and walnuts. Tasty!"
"1","5","Excellent brownies! I took the recommendation to not beat and to stir by hand. I also did not making the frosting...but I did add a handful of chocolate chips and walnuts to the batter! They're perfect brownies. They are cakier than what you get with a box recipe. I'll definitely use this recipe again!"
"1","5","Wow!!! This is one of the best if not THE best brownies I've ever ate. Chewy on the inside but crispy edges. We sprinkled pecans over the batter before baking and omitted the frosting. Good thing, because IMO it would have been too rich. My husband said he doesn't really like brownies, but he loved these!"
"1","4","this is sooo good! i will make these from now on....bye bye box mix!!"
"1","5","they are the BEST BROWNIES EVER. i've made them so many times and they come out AWESOME. but you should put a little more cocoa powder in it."
"1","5","My 12 year old daughter and her friend baked these on a rainy day. They turned out great. The glaze was a little strange, it was easily spread on warm brownies with the back of a metal serving spoon. The glaze complimented the brownies nicely! We'll make these again!"
"1","5","We made these today. I didn't do the frosting but regret that now after I've tasted them. They remind me alot of my mother's sheet cake and if I would have done the frosting it would have even a bit better I believe. Don't get me wrong these were excellent without the frosting on them. We will definately be making these again. We don't always have a brownie mix in the house but we always have the ingredients for this recipe."
"1","5","These brownies were very moist. I made them for a dessert party I hosted and they were gone just as quickly as I could put them on the table. I was leary of them because of some of the reviews so I only made two batches. I wished I had made more. They were easy to make and tasted great."
"1","5","Used onlu a half a cup of sugar. They were gone by the next morning! Delicious!"
"1","5","I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, and the Bownies were rich . . . perfect texture. I dusted with powdered sugar instead of frosting them."
"1","4","I really like these, but they are sa-weeet. My mom doesn't have that much of a sweet-tooth, and about died after one teeny bite x) If you wanna cut the sweetness down, just omit the icing. Either way, I really enjoyed them, and they went over real good at the party we took them to."
"1","2","Even though these brownies are very easy to make, they were way tooo cakey! I was looking for a chewier brownie recipe, and I guess I'll keep looking. I used a wooden spoon, so I did not over beat the mixture, like others suggested so it would not be as cake-like...oh well...they also leave a funny after-taste in your mouth. I dont think I'll be using this recipe ever again."
"1","5","My husband is SUPER picky about brownies. He LOVED these. Instead of the cocoa powder (which I didn't have) I used 2 oz. of dark chocolate to the butter when I melted it. Came out fabulous."
"1","5","This is an awesome recipe!! I read through a lot of the reviews, and I agree it is a bit fugdey, but still awesome. My husband, the king of prepackaged foods, also loved them. I don't think I'll buy boxed brownies again!"
"1","5","moist and delicious!"
"1","5","These are great! like other reviewers I beat the eggs before adding. I used dark coco powder, which gave it a more chocolately taste - worth trying if you enjoy dark choc. I didn't even make the icing yet - hopefully tomorrow if they are still around then."
"1","5","My first time making brownies from scratch and I loved them!! Of course my husband loved them and our friends! I don't know if I could ever make any box mix again! It definitely doesn't yield a whole bunch so I will probably at least double the recipe for a bigger pan of these yummy brownies!"
"1","4","I only had a 9x9 pan, so I increased the recipe by half, so instead of 2 eggs I used 3, and instead of 1 cup sugar, I used 2 cups, etc... They were still very good!! I used a wooden spoon instead of a mixer, and they were still a little cakey. I'm still looking for that great chewy brownie recipe! Again, it was still really good though!"
"1","5","Used whole wheat flour and was really yummy. I shortened the prep process by melting butter in microwave. I put all ingredients together then added butter last so the warmth of the melted butter didn't cook the eggs (I had that happen with a recipe once). Mix it until just blended. Cooked for 25 minutes and they were great!"
"1","4","These were good. I whipped these up after dinner the other night when my husband was having a sweet craving (men!). They were easy to make, requiring ingredients I had on hand (yay!). I didn't make the frosting though because my husband didn't want to wait that long! They were good without it!"
"1","5","These are the best! I've tried them with and without the frosting. They are great both ways and I've also tried them using dark cocoa powder and regular cocoa powder. Again, great both ways."
"1","5","Easy and excellent! I followed the reviewers suggestions to NOT mix vigorously, but to lightly beat the eggs before adding and then mix until just blended. They didn't last long enough to frost... I'll TRY to get that far next time :-)*UPDATE* have made this 3 more times... never HAVE frosted them! UNDOUBTEDLY one of the recipies that I will make until the day I die! For ME, I do as I said above (I mix everything in the pan that the butter is melted in) double the recipie and cook in a 13x9 pan, at 350 for no more than 25 minutes.. they HAVE to cool or they are just WAYYYYY to mushy - but SERIOUSLY, there is not a good enough word that describes these amazing little chocolate nummies whose recipie I have now committed to memory!!!"
"1","5","These brownies are the BEST EVER! My husband at 4 within 2 hours! I didn't use the frosting. They didn't need it. Super moist and I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. OMG!"
"1","5","Made them without frosting and they were great! Used margarine instead of butter."
"1","5","Yes! Yes! Yes! Half the try I topped with mini mints and the other half with pecans - both equally delish. I also added 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips to the batter before baking. I had no problem with burning like other reviews stated, in fact I had to cook 5 minutes past the recipe time and still came out fudgy-perfect."
"1","5","These brownies were really good, I made them for my guests for the Superbowl. I doubled the recipe so I made enough to go around. There wasn't one brownie left by the end of the evening. I won't buy packaged any more after having these. I sprinkled a little powered sugar over the tops as they really don't need icing."
"1","4","I'd give it a five star rating, but I didn't completely follow the recipe. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. Very good!!!"
"1","5","I love this recipe!! Toss in a bag of whatever chocolaty goodness you have on hand and these always hit the mark. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"1","5","These were WONDERFUL! I've never frosted anything while they were warm so I was a bit worried but they turned out great! My hubby LOVED them and requested that I make them again and soon! :)"
"1","5","This is the BEST ever brownies. I love the all aspect of this recipe being so easy, handy ingredients and texture which is moist and right between cake and fudge. I always double the recipe and bake it in the 9x13 casserole dish, that works perfect for me. I’ve been baking this years now and I’ve tried adjusting few things over and over. I like it bit less sweet, so I reduce the white sugar to be 1+1/2 cup instead 2 cups. I don’t even do the icing any more, yet it’s still plenty sweet to me. I also used half of the flour for whole wheat. I’ve done with 100% white whole wheat (King Arthur’s), it was very good too. But, it got too much nut like crunchiness to the texture, which was okay, but I decided I like it less. This is just a great recipe. Thank you so much for sharing."
"1","4","'These brownies always turn out!' Not any more. I'll try again, but I did something wrong. They were yummy, but very odd looking. Maybe it's the altitude. Yeah, that's it. ;-)"
"1","5","This was perfect for my chocolate fix. Didn't take long and most everyone should have all the supplies in the pantry. They are so soft and melt in your mouth. I made just the brownie without the frosting."
"1","5","very good"
"1","5","LOVED these brownies! They were fudgy, and so easy! I didn't use the frosting since I like my brownies 'naked'. Took them to the superbowl party and they went fast. :)"
"1","5","These are fabulous! I have made 3 batches in less than 24 hours. I can't keep them on stock! They are soooo easy."
"1","5","These are SUPER GOOD! They are fudgy also. I didn't make the icing for them. They took less than 10 minutes to make! I like the crunchy part on top."
"1","5","This is the first time my brownies have ever come out perfectly. I've made these at least 5 times and they are perfect every time as promised. These even won 'best dessert' for me last week. I also add a little milk to the frosting. Thanks Angie"
"1","1","Ok so these are by far NOT the best brownies. I took others advise and mixed it by hand so not to add to much air and make it cake like and it still came out blah cakish. I made them the day before I had compagnie. My daughter helped me make them and only took a bite, didn't want to eat more and my guests said it was too cake like and not dense enough. I will look for a better recipe. UPDATE:APRIL24 WOW forgot I had made these before, how very disapointing! I doubled it to bring to school for my DD's 5th b-day and now I have to trash it and start all over, glad I did it ahead of time. very cake like and oh so bland! looks NOTHING like the video instruction, booooooo!!!!"
"1","1","these brownies had a very weak chocolate flavor. definitely not worth the effort over making brownies from the box."
"1","5","So yummy! I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9X13 dish. It only needed to be cooked for 25 minutes. I took a suggestion from other review and only used 1/2 cup sugar for the frosting. I also did not double the frosting recipe and it was plenty for the double batch."
"1","3","ok...i may have overcooked it. cooked icing and turned out fudgy."
"1","5","This recipe was so amazing. It was my first time baking brownies from scratch and I had no problem. It was nice and moist!"
"1","3","These were okay, but I found them to be 'cakey' as other reviewers have also commented. My fiance didn't think that they had much flavour either. As I prefer a more fudgy brownie, I wouldn't make these again."
"1","5","Wow!!! Awesome brownies. I'm not a baker, but this recipe is so simple, these brownies are ready in less than 1 hr. I got great reviews! (didn't have to make the frosting, and everybody loved them)"
"1","5","i didn't change a thing. Easy, quick and so good. not too sweet, fudgy or cakey. plain perfect. i wont try another another recipe or use boxed again. thanks so much! I don't use the frosting because I don't care for frosted brownies. I also add pecans sometimes."
"1","5","This recipe gets 5 stars for being simple, easy, fool proof and richness!! I wasn't able to make the suggested icing because I didn't the ingredients readily available. I did improvise however with equal parts of nutella and whipping cream and that came out fantastic as well."
"1","5","they were amazing"
"1","5","fantastic brownies! Mix by hand if you want the fudgey-est, use your mixer if you want cakey brownies. The ultimate instant chocolate fix, so quick so easy and so satisfying. I want to thank the submitter whole heartedly!"
"1","2","I did not like these. I made them twice and there is just something off w/ them. The frosting did not turn out even w/ the alterations (1/2 the powdered sugar + melted butter). Not a fan but I gave them two stars because they could have been worse."
"1","5","Hands down, best brownie recipe ever! I always have these ingredients on hand anyway, so I always have a go-to dessert for last minute! You will never make another brownie recipe!!!"
"1","5","AMAZING. I substitute half the white sugar for brown and half the cocoa for bakers chocolate. top with melted white chocolate et voila! perfect brownies."
"1","5","These are the best brownies, I think an so does my family, but I suggest doubling the batter an using a 9 by 13 pan, an don't use the frosting just put powder sugar on top instead, an mix everything by hand really does help an doesn't make the mix come out like cake mix, it comes out like brownie mix, an makes them taste like brownies. I give this a 10 outta 10"
"1","3","I didn't make the frosting on this recipe, so that's probably part of the reason why we didn't love these brownies. They were ok.. moist and chewy but not very chocolatey. I bet with the frosting, they would be better. I just personally don't like frosting on brownies and feel like any decent brownie shouldn't need it.  Don't make these brownies unless you plan on adding frosting."
"1","5","These brownies are very rich, and very good. I have made them for friends on several occasions, and they have gotten rave reviews each time. I always need to add milk to the frosting to make it spreadable, but other than that I make the recipe exactly as it is written."
"1","5","This is an awesome recipes, with or without the frosting. I have been using this for a long time now. I have tried many others, with mixed results. But these are always great!! Just be careful not to overbake"
"1","5","If you are used to boxed brownies do not make these. There is a huge difference between homemade and boxed brownies. I haven't had homemade brownies like this in a long time! Very good! Make sure you put the frosting on as soon as they get out of the oven so it's easier to spread."
"1","5","These are definately the BEST brownies EVER!! I cannot wait to make them again tonight. The only thing I will do differently is, I will DOUBLE the recipe!"
"1","5","My husband and I agree that these are the best brownies we've ever had--and I didn't even frost them! I used high quality Dutch cocoa and these are to die for!"
"1","2","I followed the directions exactly (but made them w/o the frosting) and I have a mixed review. Although they were very tasty, they didn't rise much while baking. They turned out VERY flat. I baked them for 27 minutes and used an 8x8 inch pan. Also, they didn't bake well all the way through. The top of the brownies looked perfect, however the bottom layer was TOO sticky/undercooked. I love my brownies chewy, but these were almost WET. Maybe the recipe calls for too much butter? I recommend not using as much as it calls for. Although they turned out pretty flat and mushy...they were still delicious and I'm not sorry I made them for my dad and I to share! BUT, I would be embarrassed if I had made them for company! Glad I made a test batch first. I think I will look for a better brownie recipe...something was just not right in this one."
"1","4","Very good...better than 'from the box' brownies. I was running very low on vanilla so I substituted 1 tsp. Kahlua for the brownie mix portion. They turned out great! The frosting was a little difficult and took quite a while to blend enough to get to a frosting consistency. I heated it a little to help it get softer and easier to work with. Next time I'll try adding nuts and chocolate chips."
"1","1","I did not like these at all. Bad frosting. Also, the brownie itself is WAAAAY too light. Brownies should be either chewy or fudgey. This is NEITHER."
"1","5","Very good, much better with butter (as in this recipe) than oil (as in copycat 'Better Brownie' recipe). I just wish I could figure out how to keep my edges soft!"
"1","5","Best Brownies I've ever made! Perfect size, nice and gooey.  Frosting perfect addition, great recipe. Not like any other frosting Ive ever tasted.   I have made these brownies SEVERAL times, once I forgot the butter and they were still good.   I added walnuts and they don't last more than 3 minutes. The salt from the walnuts complimented the chocolate tremendously.   Without the frosting they are just as good."
"1","5","These are 'OH MY GOD' good.   My only issue is that it says it makes 16 brownies. In my house, it was more like four.   :)"
"1","4","This recipe is great for its quickness and simplicity. And it makes a very tasty CAKELIKE brownie. Personally, I prefer the denser, fudgier version but these are good too..."
"1","3","good thick brownies, very natural taste; did them exactly like recipe says and it wasnt as sweet as i thought they'd be.  a little cakey yes, some parts came out fudgier than others, maybe the cooking time needs to be reduced? oh also, an 8 x 8 inch pan only yielded 10 brownie squares."
"1","5","I stumbled upon this while looking for a chocolaty moist cake or brownie like recipe and I am blown away!!! These are brilliant. Chef Ramsey would be pleased!! Something about honey and sugar and chocolate..who knew! I can't say enough! Thank you for this delicious recipe I will also be using at the Cocoa Cafe!"
"1","5","These were very good brownies: fudgey, tasty, easy to make. I didn't make the frosting as I didn't think it was needed."
"1","5","All I can say about this one is.... INCREDIBLE!!!!! Everyone loved this one."
"1","5","Very easy and very good. Skip the frosting these brownies really don't need it."
"1","5","The best brownies ever!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","First try was cake-like just as others have wrote. Took time to read through a few reviews and found that I had over mixed them to make them cake-like. Next time I combined dry ingredients separately and mixed into the sugar egg mixture just until moistened. They turned out perfectly that time and have become the family favourite. Trying to cut down on prepared mixes as much as possible so I found this recipe just in time."
"1","5","These are fantastic! I did not even make the icing because they were great as is."
"1","5","Absolutely great! I agree with the other reviews that say no need to ever buy box mix again! So easy, and they taste great. Chewy and just a little crisp.  Take these out just before you think they're 'done'  We iced these with regular Duncan Hines frosting, my husband LOVED them!"
"1","5","So quick and easy, but they taste like you worked for hours. I melt the butter in the microwave, making it a super easy clean-up. These are a must try."
"1","4","I am seventeen and made these brownies to absolute perfection! (Excpet I forgot the salt and used self-rising flower) I loved them I couldn't, however figure out why the icing turned out so gritty and hard to spread...but the texture was JUST right! And my date that i had that night, who doesn't like brownies cause they're either too rich or this or that, said they were good. Thanx for posting this recipe. Looking forward to more good recipes from ya!"
"1","5","Very moist and chewy. I actually made them to put into a cheescake. I wish I would have made more because there were not many left over after I used them in the cheesecake. I will definitely be making them again."
"1","4","I made these a couple of times before the summer, but am just reviewing now, as I'm thinking of making them again.. ;))  turned out really well each time, def. the best brownies I've ever made! (though I've only tried 2 other recipes)  Would prefer if the recipe didn't call for so much butter and icing sugar - but hey, I guess that's where the flavour and texture comes from :)  cheers ;)"
"1","5","Delish!!! I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I only baked it for 20 minutes and they came out perfect. I made it for a friend's birthday. They were a huge hit. We could barely wait til they were out of the oven to eat them. Also, I didn't have white sugar on hand and used raw. It was delicious. I also added a bit of milk to the frosting to allow for easier spreading. Thanks for the great recipe! It's a keeper!"
"1","4","These were moist and tasty. But they weren't the chewy fudgy brownies I like with the crunchy edges. They are somewhere in between fudge and cake brownies. They are definitely better than cake brownies (which I do not care for)"
"1","5","These brownies are fantastic! I always have the ingredients on hand and can whip them up at the last minute if I have guests drop in. Everyone raves about them! I've never made the frosting since they're perfect 'as is'. I do add a couple handfuls of chocolate chips to make them extra yummy!"
"1","5","These brownies came out great. The only things I did differently was add a tablespoon of coffee granules to the batter and a teaspoon to the frosting give it a little coffee flavor and I only used 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the frosting. For the frosting to come out smooth it is very important to use room temperature butter and mix it very well with a spatula. I also cut the brownies before I put the frosting to avoid getting crumbs in the frosting after cutting. I served the brownies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce and they tasted wonderful."
"1","5","A great traditional brownie recipe complete with frosting. My only complaint is that the photo looks nothing like the actual brownies (they are frosted)."
"1","5","Wow! These brownies are excellent. I cooked these brownies in an 8 inch glass baker, because that was all I had. Another review said to decrease the temp. to 325 F. and cook for 32 min. and mine came out great. I don't know why some of the reviews said this was cake like, mine was no where near. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","4","We have made this Brownie recipe several times BUT we never add the frosting included with this recipe. We use the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting, from this website. Once we were out of Butter , so i used a 1/2 cup of cream cheese in place of the butter. The Brownies were great. Sometimes we add chocolate or peanut butter candies to the top of the brownies ."
"1","5","These brownies are easy and delicious."
"1","5","These are delicious! I will never buy box brownies again! They were perfect consistency, fudgy and tasty. I added chocolate chips to the top while baking and opted not to make the frosting. Perfect and so easy!"
"1","5","The best brownies! So good. Those who said they turned out like cake most likely cooked them too long. I've made them twice, cooking only for 25 minutes in a glass dish and they turned out fudge-like both times and tasted great. Only change was I reduced conf. sugar to 1/2 C because some reviewers said the frosting was too sweet. Also, if the butter is truly soft - mixing the frosting is not a problem at all."
"1","2","Didn't care for these at all."
"1","4","I made these brownies to take on a road trip. I used mini muffin pans and cooked for 13 minutes. They came out perfect. I omitted the frosting and mixed the batter by hand. They were nice and fudgy. Great recipe and very easy to make. Why buy a box."
"1","5","This is delicious and turns out right every time I make it. This is as much chocolate as my friends and family can tolerate before politely labeling it as 'too rich.' As if that is possible..."
"1","5","I used this recipe in place of a recipe that called for a brownie mix(mixed in with other ingredients), and it turned out wonderful, I can't wait to make it alone and see how it tastes! EDIT: Have made it as is, and it's great!! I ran out of white sugar though, and had to use 1/2c of brown. Still turned out very yummy, but I don't really like brown sugar in my brownies so next time I'll make sure I have enough white. I baked mine for about 21 minutes and they were done (toothpick came out clean)."
"1","2","These brownies did not have a whole lot of flavor and were definitely not chocolatey enough for me. I followed the recipe exactly and found them to be nothing special. In fact, I reviewed the ingredient list at least five times to make certain I did not leave out something. I will stick with my William Sonoma recipe next time."
"1","5","These brownies are yummo! They taste great! Will definately make again! 5 stars! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Amazing, I had a similar recipe with 1/2 cup cocoa (WAY TOO MUCH)and 2 tsp on vanilla which overpowered all of it. THIS IS THE RECIPE! AGAIN, AMAZING!!"
"1","5","I've made these twice so far and they always turn out great. Very easy and tasty."
"1","5","I've made this recipe twice now, once without and once with the frosting, and it was EXCELLENT both ways! People raved about them! I followed the advice of one? reviewer who said to add a teaspoon more cocoa powder, and it was fine that way. I also used the dark chocolate cocoa powder, which is very good. When I made the frosting, I melted the butter (used margarine) instead of just softening it, and added the rest of the ingredients (adding more vanilla, as I usually do), and the frosting was luscious. GREAT recipe! This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!"
"1","5","these were pretty awesome. I made the frosting, but never used it, the brownies were great without the extra sweetness. I did add dark chocolate chips to the mix and will try nuts next time. I think I may use the frosting recipe in the future for cupcakes. will definately make these again!"
"1","5","I've been baking since I was spilling flour near my mother's knees, and I've tried DOZENS of brownie recipes. This one has become my favorite, hands-down. I will never make another chocolate brownie recipe."
"1","5","canola instead of butter. yum! yogurt gives it a fudge texture"
"1","5","Ok - I had the worst time with the frosting. I did exactly what the recipe said to do and it turned out nothing like frosting. It was as if it was only dry ingredients. I had to add 2 more tablespoons of butter to it before it became moist at all. Then it was so thick that it would not spread over the brownies, so I warmed it in the microwave for 30 seconds. I was able to spread it to some degree but next time I will not make the frosting. Made it too rich anyway. So rich my dad would not even eat them and he eats anything."
"1","5","These came out fabulously! I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract (bec. I love almonds) and threw in a handful of pecan pieces I had floating around...Fantastic!"
"1","1","very flat, not chewy at all, very dry."
"1","4","I doubled this recipe and called it my 'test' brownie batch. I think the frosting came out a bit too sweet, but other than that, they were great. Everyone at my husband's work gobbled it up in no time. Next time, even if I double the recipe, I will still only add a half of a cup of confec. sugar to the frosting. I think then it will turn out just perfect!  **Also, I found that they were easier to eat the next day, after completely cooling and settling."
"1","5","In general, I'm not a brownie lover. Although, almost all brownies that I have made have been from the box. I made this recipe as an appreciation gift for my son's childcare workers and it was a great hit. I even liked it. The brownies were more moist then the box varieties and the frosting was great. I'm a frosting lover. I believe that the brownies would taste great without the frosting."
"1","5","Best brownies I have ever made. Made the glaze instead, melted the butter and cut the conf sugar in half. Never make boxed again!"
"1","4","The frosting was very hard to mix ,so I added a couple drops of milk. Overall they were very good brownies!"
"1","3","i halved the sugar, undercooked it at 15 minutes, and baked it in a bunt pan. i got good results (tastes good) but it wasn't as chewy/fudgy as i would have liked, i.e, it was chewy in the centre and too cake-like on the outside... but, i guess this was due to my alterations :D"
"1","5","I thought these tasted just like a good box mix at the store. I didn't have time to make frosting, but they were still gone the same day. Thanks so much!"
"1","5","My kids LOVED these. They turned out incredibly moist. Normally I am not a brownie fan, but these were terrific. I added about 2 tbsp extra flour and 1/2 a tsp more vanilla. Thanks for a great and easy recipe."
"1","5","Great!! Being a box brownie fan, never found a homemade one I liked, these were excellent! I just wished I doubled them...maybe it's better I didn't :o)"
"1","5","I make these all the time. They are perfect! I like the chewy brownies opposed to the cake like ones, and these are perfect. I usually have all ingredients on hand to make this."
"1","5","I have made these brownies more times than I even remember! Though I have never made the icing because I usually don't eat it on brownies, I haven't ever wanted to change a thing! Sometimes I do half dark cocoa and half regular, or just all dark cocoa and then they are really intense! The chocolately flavor is amazing, and they whip up quickly as I just melt the butter in the microwave and then pour it into the mixing bowl. This has become a family favorite!"
"1","5","Delish! We make these with the kids for special occasions. They all love to take turns stirring etc. We don't make the frosting, but do add m&m's in the batter. As soon as they're out of the oven and slightly cooled we cut them and serve with ice cream. These brownies are loved by all! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","These are GREAT brownies, I always get great reviews. I make the icing without cocoa, because I find that the vanilla icing complements the flavours well!"
"1","5","These are by far the best Brownie recipe I have ever tried. I got great reviews from everyone. This recipe is definitely a keeper."
"1","3","I followed the ingredients but instead added 1/2 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup of sugar. It took about 30 min to bake and they definitely did not look as good as the profile picture! I was disappointed in this recipe...especially after all of these rave reviews on this recipe! These brownies were rich with cocoa but too cakey and fluffy.  The best brownies I had was from my sister's bake sale. A friend of hers made these brownies that had sour cream in them and they were so moist and rich! These brownies do not compare to that recipe and even the box brownies taste better than these. This recipe was certainly healthier but just did not have that fudgey texture and taste.  Disappointing..."
"1","5","I made these brownies for some of my friends, and they absolutely LOVED them! I had to turn quite a few poeple away so I could save a couple for my family to try! This recipe isn't for someone who loves to eat extra chocolate in their brownies, but it was perfect for those who like a 'not to chocolatey' brownie!"
"1","5","Fabulous! I am the worst baker and tend to mess up everything. These brownies turned out perfect for me."
"1","4","Brownies were divine, but the Icing was difficult to handle. Next time I make these, I will use my own frosting."
"1","1","I have totally changed my mind on these. I made a double batch and loved them (I must have added extra sugar or something), the second and third time i just followed the recipe and they were not sweet and not enjoyable. Too bad, I will just try another..."
"1","5","These are really great brownies. I even forgot 1/2 of the butter -- long story, but they were still delicious! Next time I'll remember to use ALL the butter :O) I doubled the recipe and used a muffin tin instead of a pan. I also halved the sugar in the glaze and added a tbsp of Nutella. Awesome glaze. I also substituted about a third of the white sugar with brown sugar. I also think I used 1.5 cups instead of 2 cups of sugar as recommended by the doubled recipe. (I made these a couple weeks ago, trying to remember!) I added chocolate chunks and chips to them also. Really, really good!"
"1","5","I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan and they turned out wonderfully! My husband - who considers himself a brownie expert - couldn't stop raving about them! I've made them several times and I still haven't tried the frosting. To us, they don't really need it. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","These turned out excellent. I used dark chocolate cocoa and mixed well because I like cake-like brownies. I didn't bother with the frosting. Add walnuts and voila. Top this with ice cream and what a delight!!!"
"1","5","All I can say is WOW! They we're gone in one night. I'M NEVER UESING A BOX MIX AGAIN!"
"1","5","just made this brownie, yummy, yummy that all I can say, my kids loved it, I double the mixture also added chopped walnuts."
"1","5","Excellent and easy to make. I didn't add icing."
"1","5","I added about 1/4 C of water to the icing to thin it out a bit. Also, I only baked them for 22 minutes, because I like brownies to be really chewy. Other than that, this recipe is absolutely perfect - the first recipe I've found that's better than the Ghiradelli box mix!"
"1","5","These are exceptionally good brownies! I made them exactly as the recipe said, and they are wonderful! As for the frosting, I did make a change. I used all ingredients listed, except I used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the confectioner's sugar. It is not as sweet, and it actually tasted great. I did not frost the brownies, rather I used it as a spread for individuals to put on their own brownies as they chose. Most did use it, and loved it. These come highly recommended!"
"1","5","Yum - I doubled the recipe, and that too proved too little (for a family of 4)! I like my brownies to be cakelike, and very chocolately, so I made a couple changes: melted a slab of dark chocolate in a 1/3 of a cup of milk, and added it to the mixture, and added a cup of chopped pecan nuts to the batter. You can't go wrong here."
"1","3","I followed the recipe, but they didnt turn out how i picture the best brownies to be like. They were more cakelike and just had sort of an unusual texture and taste for brownies... perhaps I am just accustomed to boxed mixes... but the men in my life liked it a lot."
"1","4","I added 1 cup walnuts and reduced the sugar content to 350 gm. The brownie turned out beautifully, with a slightly shiny crust even without glazing, it tasted fudgy and with enough air to maintain some height.   Bst brownie recipe I've tried so far."
"1","5","Deeeeliscious! These didn't even last an hour. Very good and delicious and dense."
"1","5","Best Brownies I haved made, I will never use a box version again. Added chopped walnuts and choc chips!!"
"1","5","very yummy"
"1","5","Easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe and added a bag of chocolate chips. Awesome!"
"1","4","Delicious! Even with recommended modifications, my frosting didn't turn out because it was nearly impossible to spread. The flavor of everything was great. I'll try this recipe again."
"1","5","Tasty and moist! Warning: Wrap any remaining brownies tightly in saran wrap and tin foil. They dry out in a day or two if left just covered in baking dish."
"1","4","These were NOT idiot-proof brownies in my case! This being my first time making brownies from scratch, I thoughtlessly put in a rather HEAPING 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder resulting in basically cakey brownies. I'll put in a scant 1/4 teaspoon when and if I make these again. The flavor was good (I used a little more cocoa powder than specified), but next time - since I prefer a richer, denser chocolate flavor - I'll try dark cacao powder instead of the regular. Maybe one less egg would help. Also, although I used an 8x8 pan, my brownies turned out pretty shallow. I might consider multiplying the ingredients by 1 and 1/2 next time."
"1","5","I've tried at least 5 different brownies from this site (one of my weaknesses) and this one came up my favorite. Not quite fudgy, not quite cakey. I haven't tried the frosting recipe on it, I like to top it with a scoop of mint ice cream."
"1","4","These are the first brownies I made from scratch where the entire pan cooked all the way through. Very easy. It's staying in my recipe file. Didn't care for the frosting, but I always add chocolate chips, otherwise the chocolate flavor is a little lacking in my opinion."
"1","5","These are awesome. I made a gluten free version of them and it was out of this world. Great brownie top. I went without the frosting and topped mine with ice cream and hot fudge for a real special treat!"
"1","2","Followed recipe as written with exception of a suggestion from reviewer who said to half the amount of powdered sugar and melt butter to allow frosting to spread easier, which worked great. I was disappointed in the texture and flavor though. I found these to be extremely dense (closer to fudge), intensely sweet and used way too much cocoa powder, which made them overwhelming in my opinion. Definitely not a subtle brownie."
"1","5","These brownies are awesome. I made these for some friends who were coming over for dinner and they each ate two. Thankfully, I had doubled the brownie recipe to make sure I had plenty for everyone. However, I only had enough confectioners' sugar to make the frosting amount of the original recipe. It would have been way too much frosting if I had doubled that also; it was perfect just like this. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand and make these brownies again."
"1","5","Amazing, these are always a hit, and since they're so easy, I take them everywhere."
"1","5","I will never ever buy a box mix ever again. I doubled the recipe and baked for 25 minutes. Added about half a cup of mini chocolate chips. Doubled the frosting but added a splash of milk. Then melted white chocolate and drizzled that on top."
"1","5","Delicious brownies! I doubled the recipe and took the advice of another reviewer and used 3 eggs instead of 4. I also added about a 1/2 cup of mini semisweet chocolate chips. I also did not make the icing. They were perfect, and very easy to make. I will never make my brownies from a mix again!"
"1","5","These are just the most deathly delicious, divine, and decadent chocolate brownies i have ever made. They turn out every time and even thought i always make a double recipe, they never last for more than a few hours and have rapidly become a family favourite. Thankyou"
"1","2","I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out dry and cake like. Wasn't moist at all. Probably won't make this one again."
"1","5","These are incredible! I have never liked brownies from scratch, but I will never go back to boxed! I did not use the icing, and I added a handful of semisweet chips. Yum!! My husband raved about them as well! Thank you for the recipe. The brownies are outstanding!"
"1","5","Snow day here and I needed something for a valentine party tomorrow. Very good tasting brownie.I added chocolate candies (pink and red) for valentines day. You put half the mix then a layer of candies (or giant size candy bards like butterfinger work well also) then the rest of the batter. These make them extra yummy. If you use the candy bar make sure to let them cool completely."
"1","5","Delicious, I wasn't sure about the frosting, since it was a little thick, till I tasted them. I took them to a BBQ and they were a big hit. I might make them again today! Thanks!"
"1","5","Super good!!! Moist, chewy, and very chocolately. Mine came out very thin because I used a 9x9 pan by mistake, but they were still wonderful. Next time I will double the recipe and use a 9x13. The kids had them with icecream and chocolate sauce while they were still warm. Great recipe, thanks!!"
"1","5","Yum! These brownies are delicious! At first I was hesitant to make the frosting so I put semisweet chocolate chips on top of the batter while it baked. Halfway through baking, I changed my mind and decided to make the frosting. I made half of what the recipe calls for and only used 1/4 c confectioner's sugar...I also added a tiny splash of milk. I frosted the brownies while they were still warm, allowing the chocolate chips to melt into the frosting. They came out PERFECT! This recipe is definitely a keeper."
"1","4","These are pretty good brownies - the texture is moist and chewy and the flavor is good as well. They are a little sweet however - I would recommend cutting back slightly on the sugar unless you have a real sweet tooth! I have tried substituting applesauce for the butter, and found that it still has the same delicious texture and flavor without all the added fat."
"1","5","I love these brownies. I didn't change anything in the recipe and they turned out great. Rich, Fudgey and delicious! 04/23/09 Now I make a double batch and bake them for 35 minutes so they are thick and gooey."
"1","5","These really are very good. They are quite fudgey. I made the mistake of adding milk duds to the batter, but the caramel is WAY too hard, and it made them hard to eat. Next time I will add pecans or walnuts! I also didn't make the frosting with this recipe, I made my own. Some peanut butter, powdered sugar, and a little milk to loosen it up makes for great frosting on these!"
"1","5","This a great recipe for anyone who loves brownies but doesn't like the walnuts that a lot of other brownies generally have. The recipe was easy to follow and turned out just like the reviews said, somewhere between a cake and a brownie. ***Make sure if your going to frost, to double the recipe and pour it on the baked brownies while they are still warm, this will ensure the mix will spread evenly."
"1","3","Not the 'best' brownies. I agree they are in between fudgy and cakey but way too much vanilla"
"1","5","These brownies were fantastic!! The easiest from scratch brownines I have ever made.. Throwing out all my other brownie recipes!"
"1","5","I have made these brownies several times, with and without the frosting, and they turned out perfectly every time. Like others have suggested, I use 1/2 cup of sugar in the frosting.   I use egg whites instead of the whole egg and Benecol instead of butter and the taste is still great."
"1","5","The best 'from scratch' brownies I've ever made or tasted. The only thing I added was about a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. I didn't even have to frost them. The brownies alone are decadent, rich and delicious. Yum. I was going to take the leftovers into work in the morning--now I'm not sure there will be any left over!"
"1","5","Great brownies. I made them with Hershey's Dark Cocoa and they turned out great! I love Dark Chocoalate :)"
"1","4","Good, but not the 'best brownies'. I only did one thing differently with the ingredients where I used dark cocoa instead of regular cocoa. With that said, the brownie itself is good. The frosting by itself is alright (even if I had used regular cocoa, it wouldn't have changed anything since I love dark), but you absolutely cannot spread it as is on the brownies. So I scattered the frosting in clumps around the brownie, put it back in the cooling oven, and three minutes later I took them out to spread it. Worked great. However, I'd say the frosting is TOO sweet (and I'm a powdered sugar lover) and do not need to be added to the top of the brownies. I would make these brownies over boxed, but I would omit the frosting and add some kind of chocolate chips or nuts to the mix instead. And perhaps a dusting of powdered sugar on top and a little vanilla ice cream on the side. The family ate them, but I think we'd rather indulge ourselves in some other kind of sweet dessert. However, should we have a craving for brownies, I will likely refer back to these until I find one we really like. :)"
"1","5","These were delicious. I followed the brownie recipe exactly but didn't make the frosting. They really don't even need it. They were quick to make. I followed the reviewer's suggestion to mix it by hand. I usually use my Kitchenaid mixer to make brownies but sometimes they come out dry and maybe that was the problem. So thank you for the recipe and the suggestion! These were a hit. I've made these many times, now with variations. Sometimes I add 2 Tb instant coffee dissolved in 1-2 tp water. This 'mocha brownies' version is always a hit. Also, I've learned to add 2 Tb extra cocoa powder and 2 Tb extra flour. This gives them a richer chocolate taste and they stick together a little better. I've also tried them with the frosting, both with and without coffee in the brownies, and it's great every way."
"1","2","These were not a 4 star brownie, I was very dissapointed. The frosting was gross as well. The brownie was just ok. Look for another recipe!"
"1","5","made these for a party and everyone loved them , I loved them too from now on ill never have to use another recipe for brownies.This ones perfect!"
"1","5","I love the original. I made a lower-carb version as well by substituting 6 packets of Splenda for half of the sugar and 1/4 cup of almond meal (ground almonds) for the all purpose flour. Still quite delish. Oh.. if you can't find your 1/3 cup measuring cup... it's 5-1/3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. :)"
"1","5","By far one of the BEST brownie recipes ever! Wouldn't change a thing."
"1","4","I have never made homemade brownies before, and I must say that I will NEVER buy boxed brownies again!! I did not make the frosting on my first batch, and I found that the frosting is needed to compliment the brownies. My second batch included the frosting and Boy O Boy were they good!!"
"1","5","Sinfully rich. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 X 13. Had to bake for an extra 7 minutes. I didn't have enough cocoa so I used a container of chocolate icing on top. I microwaved the container for about 30 seconds and then stirred it before spreading so it wouldn't peel of the top layer. Delicious."
"1","4","I think my oven temp might be off. I followed the recipe exactly as written and baked it for about 28 min. The center came out great, nice and gooey but the sides were hard as a rock! I baked it in an 8' square glass pan. Perhaps tomorrow the edges will be more soft. I was SO hungry to taste these that I could not wait until they were completely cooled off. I love the flavor, it's just the hard edges that I don't like but as I mentioned, maybe my oven temp needs to be corrected."
"1","5","Heavenly, I have been making these for years now and realized I should review them! SO easy, always have the ingredients on hand, and fudgy and chewy. I like to add peanut butter chips on top before baking. I don't understand the person before me who gave it a bad rating b/c she didn't like 'cocoa in brownies'...Then don't try the recipe!! I don't understand people's ratings sometimes!! Okay, I'm done..."
"1","5","Sensational!! Will never make a box mix agian. The perfect combo of chewy and a little cakey. So moist and flavorful.Frosting is not necessary at all."
"1","5","I started making these brownies before I realized I didn't have cocoa powder on hand! I decided to try it anyway using milk chocolate and white chocolate chips. I had intentions of cutting the white sugar down since the chips had sugar, but I forgot to! So, I was really worried. You wouldn't believe how good these brownies were!! They were the hit of the party! Not one brownie was left and I doubled the recipe! I would recommend trying them with the chocolate chips. I will make them again with the cocoa powder as well. Thanks Angie!"
"1","5","OH MY! These were the most amazing brownies I have ever put in my mouth. I am a chocolate lover and had no clue that chocolate could taste THAT good. WOW, WOW, WOW!"
"1","5","These brownies are awesome! I didn't make the frosting. Everyone loved these, they didn't last very long! You have to make a double batch!"
"1","5","OMG! These are fabulous! graham crackers on bottom 9x13 pan, bake, add choc chips, mini marshmallows, & chopped peanuts....SMORES! yummy"
"1","5","MORE like TEN stars! They were so good! Amazing, Magnificent, and a really cool flavor. I loved the cocoa and it is much better than the store bought brownies."
"1","5","I have tried more brownie recipes than I can count, looking for one that gives me moist and fudgey brownies, and this is the one! The last time I made then I was all out of butter and white sugar so I used canola oil and brown sugar instead and I found they came out really moist with the oil. Any way you make it this recipe turns out every time!"
"1","4","These were very good, definitely better than a box. They aren't my absolute favorite brownie, but I will probably make them again. I like the addition of the frosting. I do think you need to melt the butter, not just soften. My glaze was just a bunch of balls of stuff, lol, so I had to add a little milk and hot water to get it to pouring consistency. As far as texture, these are the complete opposite of cake-like, so I'm not sure where that result is coming from. They're definitely fudgy brownies. I baked them for probably 22-23 minutes, and that was perfect. No problems with sticking at all. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Great recipe, made with my kids - they loved them. Topped with powered sugar instead of glaze."
"1","5","These brownies really were great. I did not make the frosting as I did not have all the ingredients but I did add some milk chocolate chips. They were like a combination of fudge and cake brownies which was wonderful."
"1","5","These are the BOMB according to my 7 yr old son and I happen to agree with him. We have made these twice and they come out perfect every time..GOODBYE BOX MIX!"
"1","5","This is really a never fail recipe. I doubled this and used half melted butter/half corn oil and it turned out great (I was running low on butter)."
"1","5","Mmmmm...these were delicious. Very rich. I undercooked them a little because I do like them fudgy. I doubled the recipe. My husband has a friend over right now and they've already eaten 3/4 of the pan! Really good with Cool Whip on top. Thanks!"
"1","5","Wow! I pulled these brownies out of the oven about 20 min ago, and I'm ashamed to admit how much of the pan is left. :) Every bit as good as the title reveals. I baked mine for 25 min and the center was soft and gooey and the edges were chewy and delightful. Everything I expected from a brownie. I'm just dissapointed that I didn't have a high quality vanilla ice cream to mix with the warm-from-the-oven brownies."
"1","5","Very good brownies I added some cashews in my mix and my husband couldn't stop eating them!"
"1","3","I thought these were pretty good. Not amazing but good! I chose not to make the frosting, maybe next time I will."
"1","4","These brownies weren't too bad, but I don't think they were the best either. A little too cake-like for my tastes."
"1","5","I doubled this recipe and did not include the frosting. I thought they were very good - all of the family at Thanksgiving LOVED them - which is a good sign. And, I love the fact that these are as easy as making brownies from a box mix!"
"1","5","These were so good, not a cake not fudge either. A real brownie which was soft and delish. I didn't make the glaze but I think I will next time because I love over the top sweets but without is probably perfect fot a mild sweet tooth.Try it out it wasn't hard to make and I already had everything in my kitchen."
"1","5","I added a quarter-cup of chopped peanuts, then spooned the mixture into a mini-muffin tray. I baked for about half the time (12 to 15 minutes), but watch the oven - theses things cook quick! Made 24 delicious one-bite morsels, that were just a little bit gooey. A keeper recipe, for sure."
"1","5","This is a very good brownie recipe; they came out light, but not cakey, and not dense. I used dutch-processed cocoa (that's all I had), and I doubled the cocoa (I like my brownies to be very chocolaty). I didn't make the frosting because I had leftover chocolate ganache, so I just used that. So quick and easy, and soooo tasty. I baked for 22 minutes and they are perfect."
"1","5","Super recipe for a quick pan of brownies! I added a little extra cocoa powder because I added a little chocolate syrup to the batter (like my own, original recipe). I baked these in a greased pie plate and cut into wedges. The bake time was less because of the dish I used. I also opted not to frost or glaze these, and they were really good plain. I made these last night, and this afternoon there is only one left. Not a bad recipe at all and I just love how quick and easy they are to make! I will make these again."
"1","5","[[UPDATE - Jan 08 - Yes, these brownies are great but I am more of a fan of the Vegan Brownie recipe from this site.]]  I've never made brownies before but I followed this recipe exactly (except I doubled the brownie mix -- wasnt enough to fill an 8 x 8 pan) and they came out BEAUTIFULLY! I didn't have vanilla extract for the frosting but I don't think that made much of a difference. I baked my brownies for 25 min. but the middle was still uber gooey so I think 27 or 28 would have sufficed."
"1","4","These are pretty darn good. Use the best cocoa you can get your hands on; I think the quality of the cocoa makes a big difference. Poor-quality cocoa (or old cocoa) can really mess with your final results.. The brownies are not cakey but not entirely fudgy either. They're dense without being to heavy. I frosted some of them with a mixture of melted chocolate mixed with peanut butter. Wow. Good! Oh, I aslo added about 2 tsp of instant esspresso powder to the melted butter mixture. Intensified the chocolate taste."
"1","1","These are not the best brownies."
"1","5","This is the perfect brownie recipe! I made the recipe exactly as written, except I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan. I didn't use the frosting because it was already sweet enough. I just dusted with powdered sugar. I love this recipe because it's so quick! And the cleanup is a cinch - I didn't even have to use a mixer - no mixing bowls required - straight from the pot on the stove to the baking dish. I will make this again and again!"
"1","5","The name is no lie. These are unbelievably good brownies. The best brownie's I've ever made from scratch with cocoa and no added processed chocolate. My square pan was in the oven already, so I used a round pan and cut them into triangles. Soooo delicious- my family gobbled them up in no time."
"1","5","this was a great brownie recipe! my family loved it and hopes i make it again"
"1","4","You will need to add a little milk to the frosting to make it smooth and bind it together. Otherwise it won't mix well. The brownies are pretty good. Next time I might use a little more flour to thicken them up and also because the sugar-to-flour ratio seems a little high. I halved the frosting but actually used less than half of the powdered sugar and it came out just right and in just the right amount. I will probably make this again when I need a good chocolate fix."
"1","4","This recipe makes excellent brownies. Mine did not come out cakey at all like some other reviewers said. They're not very sweet, which I liked because I don't like food that is too sweet. So you might want to add more sugar if you like them sweet. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","I've tried quite a few recipes from here and this one is definitely the best so far! It has a great flavor, not too sweet and would be just as good if nuts were added, if you like nuts in the brownies. I want nuts sometimes and other times I don't. I didn't try the frosting, they didn't last long enough! I didn't quite get the crisp crust on top, not that it matters they're so good. VERY easy to make, if anyone says they didn't turn out then you need some lessons in baking because I do it all the time and these are extremely easy to make. If you're using a microwaveable mixing bowl, you can just make these in one bowl. Microwave the butter instead of dirtying a pan to melt it, then add the rest of the ingredients to the mixing bowl."
"1","5","awsome recipe.frosting was hard to spread so i added a little milk to make it spreadable.."
"1","5","great brownies! the frosting was too thick/hard, so i doubled the frosting ingredients (except for the powdered sugar). turned out great then. also, use melted butter instead of softened for the frosting."
"1","4","I doubled it and dropped an egg. They were really delicious, but seemed too buttery. Next time, I'll probably try with a bit less butter."
"1","4","Wonderful brownies. They stayed moist and fresh for several days. Thank you!"
"1","4","Great, chewy & chocolately brownies and fast to make with items on hand. I doubled the recipe and changed it a bit due to pantry limits. But I'm going to note my changes and make them permanent for next time. Instead of 4 eggs, I used 3. Instead of butter, I used 1/2 margarine stick, 1/2 Crisco shortening stick. I also added an add'l tbl of cocoa powder to the batter. I microwaved the marg/shortening instead of melting in a saucepan on the stove and then used that bowl to mix the rest of the ingredients (by hand, no electric mixer this time). Not sure why others had problems with this recipe, but I'm quite happy with it and it's better than a box and almost as fast. Sorry if this is a duplicate -- I Forgot to mention that I didn't make the frosting so I can't comment on that aspect."
"1","5","I had a craving for peanut butter brownies, so I made this recipe and added a half cup of peanut butter to the sugar mixture before I added in the flour. I also did not make the frosting. They turned out to be moist and delicious. I will make these again."
"1","5","Pretty good brownies. I added butterscotch chips."
"1","5","This is my favorite brownie recipe from this site. It's very fast and easy and the flavor is great. I love the honey in the frosting!"
"1","3","These were alright. They turned out pretty cakey for me. I prefer fudgier brownies so they weren't my favorite."
"1","5","I love this recipe. It is 'my' brownie recipe. I never use the frosting. My favorite thing to do is double the recipe and add milk chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and chopped walnuts. WONDERFUL. Especially with ice cream. Everyone asks me if they can have more :) Thanks so much!"
"1","5","I really liked these. As someone else said, they truly are a good hybrid of cakey and fudgey brownies. They were good frosted and unfrosted."
"1","2","Well... I don't know what happened! I am pretty good baking and following recipes but these brownies turned terrible... My husband is a 'browny lover' and these brownies did not get eaten... the frosting was the worst of all. I am sorry."
"1","5","These were great. I am just now starting to cook...it must be because I'm pregnant. But if I can make these and they turn out this good...anyone can..they were super easy and very 'fudgey'."
"1","5","I don't know why everyone's making suggestions and trying to change the recipe-- it's absolutely perfect AS IS. Seriously- the best brownie you'll ever consume."
"1","5","Absolutely the best brownies i've ever made in my life!!  Best part is, when i changed a bit of the recipe to make brownie cupcake/muffin, they disappear even faster!!  As I felt it was a tad too sweet, I reduced the sugar to 150g instead and I used demenara or brown sugar. Just before pouring the batter into muffin/cupcake cases, I've also added chocolate chips (1/2 pack or 3/4 pack, depending on how chocolatey u like ur brownies) and also, macadamia nuts and just mix it well to ensure that the chocolate covers everything.  Then I only baked the cupcakes/muffins for only 15 mins.  After that, they disappear into everyone else's mouths..."
"1","5","Best brownies ever!"
"1","5","Very easy to make! My fiancee loves these brownies and I added a tablespoon of chocolate syrup to the wet ingredients...thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","The brownies were delicious! I made them with my niece, Tyler, and nephew, Kenny, and we all thought the recipe was easy to follow and yummy to eat. We let the brownies cook for 25 minutes in a preheated oven and loved the consistency. The only change we had to make was with the icing. We found it a little too thick and added 1/4 cup of milk to thin it out a bit. Two thumbs up!! We'll make this one over and over again."
"1","5","Loved them great flavor. Added some chocolate chips,then sprinkled confectioners sugar on top. Next time I'll double the batch."
"1","5","So simple and so delicious! The only other thing you can add to perfect this is to swirl creamy peanut butter on its top before baking."
"1","5","I've tried the recipe on the side of the cocoa powder container before and didn't really like it. These were SOOOO good! My husband loves peanut butter, so I swirled some of that in, plus I added some chocolate chips (for me) and they turned out great!"
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out WAY to cakey and not at all dense like a brownie should be. Too bad because I really wanted brownies and not cake. If you like dense brownies, find a different recipe."
"1","5","These brownies turned out a little thinner than expected (probably because I used a 9 x 9 pan instead). It's a perfect combination of a cakey but fudgey brownie. If you use a 9x9 pan, only cook for 20-22 minutes! I use this recipe as a base for Nanaimo bars."
"1","5","brilliant. I used a 9x13 pan and doubled the amount, except I used 1/2 c apple sauce and 1/2 c butter and 1/3c less sugar. and I didn't make the frosting. In preheated oven 25 minutes exactely. Fantastic on the second day, great texture, not cakey or dry, just right. This was the first time I made brownies and they turned out just as I wanted."
"1","5","I've always wanted to try making home-made brownies and I'm glad I used this recipe! Very moiste, tasty, and I already had all the ingredients. We use natural turbinado sugar (unrefined) in all our cooking and it came out fine."
"1","3","This is a copy of the Fudgey Brownie recipes on the side of the FRY'S cocoa powder can."
"1","5","These ARE the best brownies!!! Made a double batch in a 9x12 pan last night and they were gone within 24 hrs! PERFECT consistency, awesome fudgy flavor!!! I microwaved the butter in a plastic mixing bowl and just stirred everything right in there... Be sure to mix the ingredients with a spoon only, though."
"1","5","After making these brownies, I will NEVER use a box mix again! The ingredients are probably available in every kitchen and takes only a few minutes to put together. Pop in the oven and you will have fudgy, moist brownies in about 25 minutes!   I didn't have a 8X8 pan so I doubled the recipe for my 9x13 and it turned out fine. A little thin but I decided to make tiny brownie bites so it worked out. (I also mixed in a cup of bittersweet chocolate chips.) I skipped the frosting and they are still delicious! Even my dad, who never eats anything sweet, snuck a few pieces. I am a complete novice in the kitchen so if I can make them, anyone can!"
"1","5","These were absolutely amazing! We ate half the pan of them the first day (yea I know, not smart but man are they addictive). I followed the advice about just gently mixing the dry ingedients into the wet, and they came out wonderfully fudgy. I didn't make the frosting as I was feeling lazy plus for the amount we ate, probably better off I didn't!"
"1","5","Soooooooo rich!! I only used 1 egg to make the brownies fudgey. I also had to add a bit of milk to the frosting. Otherwise, when I make brownies I will be using this recipe and not Betty Crockers!!"
"1","5","This is a great recipie! These brownies are so easy to make! 'One bowl brownies' They are moist & chewy. I looked long and hard for a good brownie recipie using cocoa powder rather than baking chocolate for when I'm out of baking chocolate & finally after many brownie disasters I tried this! I don't even make the icing because they don't need it! Sometimes I change it up a bit example 1/4c + 2Tbsp apple sauce + 2 Tbsp coconut oil, or 1/4c apple sauce 1/4c butter/oil. Or I just make it full fat. Whatever I'm in the mood for. No matter how I make them, they turn out delicous every time! A keeper thankee sai!"
"1","5","These are soooooooo good. They are so easy and quick to make too - I added chocolate chunks and they were awesome. This will be my brownie recipe from now on."
"1","4","These were wonderful but very rich! I think I will leave off the frosting next time. I also added whitenchocolate chips which always add a nice touch but made them even richer! I doubled the recipe for a party and they were gone in a few minutes. A definate keeper."
"1","5","they live up to their name! I doubled and turned out perfect! I made a simple chocolate glaze and added sprinkles..the kids devoured!"
"1","2","I did not like this recipe...the edge of the brownies burned after only twenty minutes in the oven. I cut the burnt part away and decided to try the brownies...they weren't very sweet, and very cakelike. Thanks anyway!"
"1","5","Wow.. these brownies are awesome! I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 inch pan.. but there wasnt much batter for that big pan, so I made more batter (without doubling it this time) and they came out to the perfect thickness... the frosting came out good but it is pretty sweet... you do have to add milk untill youve reached your desired consistancy. Ill be making these again, Im sure! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","This is a great brownie recipe! They taste sooo good! They're chewy on the inside and form a light 'crust' on the outside. Really nice texture. I reduced the sugar by 2 tbsp and didn't frost them, which pleased my family's sweet tooths just fine. I especially like how quick and easy it is to whip these up. I used a spoon to mix them; no beaters needed. Clean-up is super-quick, too. I greased (didn't flour) the pan, and they popped out easily. The longer you let them cool, the better they taste....and the faster they'll disappear. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","All I can say is that I wish I HADN'T tried this recipe because I cannot quit eating these! I doubled the recipe using only two jumbo eggs, one full cup of cocoa powder, one cup of Ghiradelli bittersweet baking chips and then baked these in a 9x13 pan for exactly 23 minutes. These brownies are simply the fudgiest and most moist brownies that I have ever eaten. This is my new favorite brownie recipe...everyone else in the house enjoyed these, too, because they were made less than 24 hours ago and the entire pan is almost empty. Thanks for this great recipe!!"
"1","5","i decided to make these brownies today because it was my husband's birthday. I had just ran out of store mix brownies so i quickly had to come up with something. He loved this more then the store mix brownies. It was fantastic and very easy to do. I didn't use the frosting because it was perfect the way it is. I just decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. Baked it for about 30 mins. FANTASTIC. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This recipe is amazing. I have tried all kinds of brownie recipies, from super fudgy that burnt in the oven, to overly fluffy that tasted like a cheaply made, sweet chocoalte cake even if I used heaps of the best cocoa at the store. My only alterations were to beat the eggs apart (as other members had suggested) and I added 2 tbsp of chocolate syrup along with the vanilla. I will definitely be making this again, and throwing betty crocker out the window!"
"1","5","To make these brownies even better...break up two small hershey candy bars into the batter. Then when you take the brownies out of the oven, break two more candy bars on top and spread with a spoon instead of frosting. Great recipe and so easy when you mix with a spoon vs. a mixer."
"1","5","I made these for my husband, who is a brownie fanatic, and he LOVES these! Thanks!!"
"1","5","These brownies are perfect. Have never tasted a better home-made brownie before. Very common ingredients and yet somehow it results in a delicious desert that tastes better than any other. It's been rated over a thousand times so that's a good clue as to how good these are."
"1","5","What a wonderful treat this is. The brownie is not to sweet thats why the frosting is nescessary. My frosting almost had the consistancy of fudge when I chilled the remaining that I didnt use. My boyfriend ate the rest of the frosting straight out of the bowl and has single handedly ate half the tray in one day. The best thing is it only takes one bowl. Kudos."
"1","5","hmmmmm...could Splenda be the culprit? i've baked with splenda b4, but now 2 brownie recipes have failed.  ***UPDATE***[originally one star] - could have been the girls or the splenda. I made these last night - with reg. sugar - and they totally suit their name! They ROCK!! Made exactly as stated - even added some chocolate chips. I did not make the frosting."
"1","5","GREAT brownies! Easy and quick to make, always turn out great. I love the topping... although some people have found it a tad too sweet. I've found that I need to add just a splash of milk to make the frosting smooth. Overall, a true crowd pleaser! They really hit the spot when you're craving brownies."
"1","1","These were cakey and not moist at all. I was very disappointed by it all. Will never make them again."
"1","5","These were so good we didn't even make frosting for them! Thank you sharing."
"1","5","they really are the best brownies! this was my first time making brownies from scratch and it couldn't have been a more pleasant experience!! i didn't make the frosting b/c I didn't want to go and buy the extra ingredients. As some others have said, it wasn't necessary!!"
"1","4","This recipe was great. I used self rising flour, therefore, did not use the baking powder or salt. That was the only change I made and they turned out perfect. Frosting was good too! Did not change a thing. Will bake again & again!"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! I did everything exactly as it was written except the honey, I don't keep honey in my pantry, so I thinned the frosting ever so slightly with milk. Both the brownies and the frosting were wonderful and they didn't last long at all! Thank you!"
"1","5","I absolutly LOVEEE this recipe!!! i added caramel and pecans to the top and they tasted just like turtles...my friend has braces so when he gets them tightened i just make the fabulous icing and he loves it! a biggg hit!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe!!! These brownies are sooo decadent! I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I used instant coffee in the brownies and the frosting. I also put a little bit of peanut butter in the frosting. It gives it a more solid consistency and a nice hint of flavor. Everyone I know asks me to make these brownies when my husband and I are invited to parties, and he always takes home what is left over. I've had to start making 2 batches to avoid embarrassing situations with our friends!"
"1","2","Hmm.. not too fond of the taste or texture. Too cake-like, I like my brownies more chewy/dense."
"1","5","maybe this brownie lacks the fudgy, deep chocolate flavor, but i have to give this a 5 star because it is so easy to make. right afterwards, i made another batch with about 5 coffee beans finely ground to give it a mocha flavour. i am experimenting with different suggestions from other users, such as omitting baking p, using both brown and white sugar etc."
"1","5","These brownies were absolutely excellent!! Fabulous for a chocolate fix. They were dense and chewy - just the way I like my brownies. I made a double batch, cooked it for about 30mins in a 9x13 pan and dusted it with powdered sugar. I will definately make this again - if you want a fabulous, easy, rich chocolately brownie you need to try this recipie!"
"1","5","There is nothing much i can add to these reviews but YUM!!!"
"1","3","These are okay, but I certainly wouldn't call them the 'best'. I usually inhale anything chocolate, but to me these are quite mild and not a brownie texture at all. The flavor is decent and it was a quick chocolate fix, but I probably would try another recipe next time."
"1","5","So good! I've made these with & without the glaze and actually prefer them without. They're midway between cakey and fudgy and just made us all say yum. My 12 year old daughter made these on her own one night and aced them! She thanks you for a simple, yummy recipe too!"
"1","3","Honestly...these were just mediocre to me. The texture was good, but didn't seem to have all that much flavor. I am one that likes my chocolate dishes to be extremely rich and decadent. These aren't what I'd consider to be brownies for a 'grown up' pallate. I won't be making these again."
"1","5","These brownies are great and turn out every time. I do add a teaspoon or two of milk or cream to the frosting. Without a little milk the frosting is quite stiff."
"1","5","Excellent! If you are planning to bake brownies in a dark pan, they will be done in about 20 minutes! I make these quite often. I am constantly being asked for the recipe."
"1","5","What can I say? These are literally the best brownies ever. I prefer to use a nonstick metal pan rather than a pyrex glass pan, as they metal seems to bring out the texture I prefer for this recipe. Another awesome time-saver is that you don't have to wait for these to cool to ice them. I just LOVE that. I am always impatient about icing, and I have often not waited long enough with bad result. So thanks for this awesome recipe!!"
"1","5","Thought this was delicious! I didn't have everything to make the icing so I improvised with some store bought fudge icing and store bought whipped cream cheese icing. I mixed them together and spread that on top. Yummy! I'll definitely be making these brownies again. So simple, so easy, and ohhhh so good!"
"1","5","these are so good- everyone wants the recipe when I make them"
"1","4","The texture of this brownie is perfect. I did make a couple of additions. I added 1 tsp of espresso powder, 1 c. of semi-sweet mini morsels, and I sifted all of the dry ingredients before adding to the wet. I also didn't use the frosting, instead I just dusted them with powdered sugar.   I was not a big fan of them when I tried it the same day I made them, but I really liked them the next day."
"1","3","This recipe was 'ok'. It was a little too bitter for me, with all the cocoa powder. I did add milk choc chips into the batter, and a few melted ones into the glaze. It is decent, but not the best. We will just have to see what my hubby says about them...He is a brownies lover."
"1","5","This brownie recipe was perfect. I skipped on the icing; they didn't need it at all. The only addition I made was to stir in a few chocolate chips at the end--delicious."
"1","5","For the first time in my life, I have made brownies that has come out right!! I cannot believe how happy I am for getting right!! And it is the recipe that is just superb. ..thank you for this!! You are right..it comes right every time. After 20 attempts and failing religiously at making brownies..this recipe has made my brownie attempts successful and uplifted my spirits in making good brownies:-) Thank youuuuuuuuu for this!"
"1","4","Great brownies. For higher altitudes, you may want to add a tablespoon or so of flour and increase your baking time a bit. My family loves these, with or without the icing."
"1","5","Inspired by that photo, I followed the recipe exactly, but instead poured the batter into an 8' 8-wedge cornbread skillet pan. They looked and tasted awesome! Great recipe!"
"1","4","These were good and very easy to make... but just not what I was looking for I guess. I had a hard time spreading the frosting since it was so thick. The taste was good though, but I didn't get too many comments on them from my dinner guests. I'll be trying another recipe before I try this one again"
"1","5","wonderful recipe for brownies. finally, one that beats a box mix!"
"1","5","These brownies are absolutely delicious. I didn't expect them to come out as great as they did. They were gone by the next day."
"1","5","There is absolutely no way that this is not a five star brownie...wow, I'm in love...absolutely in love."
"1","4","These brownies were 'extremely' sweet! I liked the brownies, but next time I am going to reduce the sugar, use unsalted butter and not use frosting. They were so sweet they hurt my teeth!"
"1","3","A very nice brownie, but just not what I was looking for. I guess I'll have to continue my search for the perfect brownie recipe."
"1","5","My husband loved these brownies. I've been making brownies for years but they always turn out cakelike and I throw about half away. These were rich and dense, just the way he likes them. The frosting made it extra rich. There are never any left over."
"1","4","Good brownies, didn't rise much though so that left them thinner than I had expected."
"1","5","yummy!!! ive made this 3 times, 1st time w/the frosting...pretty yummy, 2nd time w/o the frosting, kinda cake-y, and today in a mini-muffin tin for 15 min and omg so deelish! the top is nice and crusty and the inside is moist and gooey!!!"
"1","5","I really liked these.. I can't believe how easy and quick they were to make! I only used one pan and that's it, and I swear, it must have taken only 10 minutes to prepare. In addition, I substituted splenda for 1/2 of the sugar and omitted the frosting. The splenda did not diminish the flavor at all since I still left half the sugar in. Also, I think I overcooked them a little at 20 minutes baking time. Next time, I'll check them at 15 minutes."
"1","5","The Best Brownies I have ever made!! And believe me, I have tried many different recipes from this site. Update: I used Special Dark Cocoa Powder instead of regular cocoa powder and did not use the frosting. OMG. It was delicious. Pair it with a cup of milk and it's the perfect balance."
"1","5","turned out great, everyone loved them :)"
"1","1","they sank like a stone. AWFUL!"
"1","1","I have NO idea why this received such high ratings????? To me it was a total waste of my ingredients! I will go back to using MY recipe, which never fails me."
"1","5","I've baked a number of things before but I've never made brownies before! So this was the first time for me... and I am so glad I tried this recipe, because I think it's definitely a keeper! So simple, and the ingredients I usually always have on hand. I added 1/2 cup of walnuts into the batter, and also sprinkled some on the top. Really, really nice :) Nice and gooey in the center as well! These really are the best brownies!"
"1","5","They are the Best Brownies and soooooo easy to make !!! After mking them I will never buy box brownies again!! I did not make the froting.I like fudge frosting and bet that would be great on top of theses brownies."
"1","4","This was a good basic brownie. My husband loves brownies, and this one met his expectations. The frosting didn't work for me, but it really didn't need it. I didn't have an 8x8 pan, so I made them in a 9x9 pan and they were too thin for my taste. Next time I will definitely make them in a smaller pan or adjust the measurements of the ingredients so that it will make a thicker brownie."
"1","5","Easy to make and delicious! This is my go-to recipe for brownies from here on out."
"1","5","THE BEST!!! made several times, comes out every time"
"1","5","Wonderful Recipe!!! My husband loved these and he is a hard brownie critic. But these were a hit. I added a little more cocoa, just to make they really chocolatley!! This is a keeper!!"
"1","5","I have been married for 16 years, and a friend of mine gave me a chocolate cookbook for a wedding present. This was the first thing I learned how to make as a newlywed trying to impress her husband. This recipe lives up to its name, and never fails to convert those who think that brownies can only be made from a box mix. I prefer them without the frosting."
"1","5","These are the BEST brownies! Yummy"
"1","5","These came out thicker than cake, but not so fudgey that they stick to your palate in a gross way.   I needed something to fix the 'sawdust' frosting as given in the recipe, I was out of eggs but a touch of half-n-half produced great results.   These would be perfect to make again for a bake sale or office potluck. Will make again!"
"1","5","These were really yummy. I will make them again for sure."
"1","5","yummmyy//these were awesome. everybody in my family loved them. thanks for the recipe =]"
"1","5","These brownies turned out great! The sides weren't hard at all, a first time for me. 25 mins was exactlty enough. These brownies were so chewy and sweet enough for me that I didn't even need to put the frosting on top. Instead I dusted them with a little bit of powder sugar since my husband likes brownies like that, yum! I'll definitely keep using this recipe."
"1","5","Delicious!! The name says it all! This is the best brownie recipe that I have ever made! They are very easy and fast to whip up. In addition, the frosting was wonderful. It tasted just like store bought icing. The only addition I had to make was to add a little milk (maybe 2tsp) in addition to the other frosting ingredients."
"1","5","awesome brownies! i followed other reviewers advice on the frosting - halving the powder sugar - tasted great. easily made and tastes great!"
"1","5","I am giving this recipe five stars because even though I prefer cakey brownies, these ones definitely live up to the majority of the reviews (they are very moist and fudgy). I didn't bother to make the frosting, but my family and friends just loved them!"
"1","5","I made these exactly as written except baked them in mini muffin pans and they are amazing!"
"1","5","OMG!!! These are the best! Very sweet but that is how our family likes it! They are soo good I had to put ice cream and hot fudge on top!     I did double the batch and made enough to fit in a 9 X 13 pan.. the frosting mix I didn't have to double it was enough to coat the entire pan!"
"1","5","I made these for Christmas as my sister was coming and she loves brownies. She said they deserved 5*s, as she ate the whole thing I have to take her word for it. I followed advice from others about half white and brown sugar, I also added 2-3oz chopped walnuts and I left out the baking powder because my sister like it fudgy. Now she knows I have the recipe it looks like I will have to bake them alot more often!!!"
"1","5","This recipe is tried & true, easy as can be, & simply put: just plain yummy! I keep coming back to get this recipe to send to those who try my brownies & must try to make them on their own. Get silly with the frosting, as well as adding things to the batter & see what flavors you can come up with, I'm sure they'll be great."
"1","5","This is a great, easy to make recipe that always impresses. It has become my family's most requested."
"1","5","These brownies really live up to their name. Yum! I found the icing to be a little thick, so I followed the recipe and iced them while they were still warm (making it easier to spread). I had no problems. Give this recipe a try!"
"1","5","These are great brownies! Nice and chewy! I skipped the topping and I think they taste just fine without it. Might try it next time, but they definitely don't need it. They taste a lot like my mom's fudge pie which is one of my favorites!"
"1","4","The brownie itself was great but the frosting turned out dry and crumbly."
"1","5","Yummy Yummy yummy! These are some of the best brownies I've ever eaten. I make the recipe exactly as is. Thanks!"
"1","5","Love these brownies - but i never bother with the icing. They're great without it."
"1","5","The title says it all, the most wonderfully moist and delicious brownies you will ever taste. However , I omit the topping, they are good enough without it!"
"1","5","These were a big hit! and so easy!"
"1","5","AWESOME! Love these. I used extra dark cocoa powder and added some dark chocolate chips, because my husband loves dark chocolate. He now makes me make these almost once a week, for his work's potluck, for thank you presents, any possible occasion. Yeah they are a little fudgy, but that's what brownies are suppose to be like in my book. Never had someone eat these without giving me a great compliment."
"1","5","I make these brownies every other week! My husband loves them. I make them as-is and they turn out perfect everytime!"
"1","4","I really liked these. My husband though said they had a weird taste so that is why I am only giving them 4 stars. That's OK because that leaves more for me! The only change I made was that I doubled the recipe."
"1","5","I do agree, these are the BEST. These are my favorite brownies! They are easy to make and easy to clean up."
"1","5","These were super good. I used up all my cocoa powder in the batter so we didn't have any frosting but I had one hot out of the oven and it was incredible. I think they would be even better with chocoalte chips. Thanks"
"1","5","New family fav..... Thanks for sharing such a great recipe :)"
"1","4","This was very good, but was a little to sweet for me. my mom and broher loved it. i added a mixture of nutmeg, cinnamon, and wallnuts. i put those ingredients in. maybe that's why they were so sweet."
"1","5","Much better than Betty Crocker in a box."
"1","3","The frosting came out grainy but apart from that it was OK. Not the best recipe for brownies out there though."
"1","5","These are very good brownies. However, I followed the icing exactly how the recipe said to, and it did not look like icing at all. There were big clumps of chocolate that couldn't incorporate all the powdered sugar, so I had to add water to make it icing like. Even so, these are still very good brownies."
"1","4","i made these brownies today and they weren't bad, but it was like a dense chocolate cake. i was hoping for a thick and fudgy brownie, but my mom enjoyed them though. maybe witha few modifications they'll come out great next time"
"1","4","By themselves these brownies aren't all that great; good chewy texture, but they dont really taste sweet or fudgy. The frosting (made with milk instead of honey) significantly improves them."
"1","5","i made it and i was a little worried because the frosting looked crumbly that it wouldnt go on the brownies...but it spread perfectly and tasted delicious!!!!"
"1","5","Great recipe! The brownies were moist, rich and fudgey! I cooked them a few minutes less than the directions suggested, but otherwise I followed the recipe (I didn't, however, try the icing as it didn't get such good reviews...also, I don't think the brownies need any icing as they are rich enough without!)"
"1","5","Great! Can't say more about it."
"1","2","Just made these brownies. They were very cakey, and not very tasty. I thought the icing might add to the taste, but it didn't."
"1","2","These had a wonderfully rich chocolate taste, but were a cakey texture. Very dry as well. They were very simple to make in one large saucepan, kudos for that! But they weren't crispy and cracked on top and fudgy and chewy like we expected. Frosting was thick and I had to add a couple splashes of milk as it was too chalky and dry. I only cooked these the minimum amt. of time suggested. I've tried this one twice to be fair, but it just hasn't worked out. Sorry."
"1","5","So good! nevermind the people that say it didn't turn out...it's not the recipe, it's them. I'm inept and it was my first try at making brownies; these were everything a brownie should be. Didn't change a single thing, just added some nuts on top."
"1","5","This is so easy and so yummy! I love it and so does my family"
"1","5","I make these all the time and everyone loves them. Simply the best brownies!!!I top them with M&M's instead of frosting them :)"
"1","5","The first time I made these I wasn't sure what to do with the frosting...it was very hard to spread on the brownies. The next time I made them I placed the frosting between two sheets of Saran wrap and rolled it out with a rolling pin. After that I just draped it over the brownies and spread it out after it melted a bit. I find it makes it much easier."
"1","5","I absolutely loved these brownies. They are the BEST i've ever had. So chewy and moist. I used them in the chocolate trifle recipe from this website, and it was delicious. As for the frosting...What happened to it? Mine was a crumbled mixture, not creamy AT ALL. So what i did was i added 1/2 cup of cream cheese, and it was PERFECT. If you love chocolate, you have to try this. Definately make again."
"1","5","I added a little cinnamon to the frosting....very good either way!"
"1","5","I always get rave reviews when I make these brownies and I don't even use the frosting. They are rich, moist and very tasty. I use them in the Chocolate Trifle recipe from this site."
"1","5","The title for these is perfect! THESE ARE THE BEST BROWNIES! They were super moist, and delicious! I was a little worried about the frosting because it was a little pasty, but just adding a little milk helps. I'll be making this one again, and again! Thanks!"
"1","5","Great and kept well."
"1","5","Wow! These were so delicious I was asked by my daughter to make it a second night in a row. Easy and simple to make."
"1","5","Amazing flavor, just as easy as packaged, and without all of the poison they use in those packaged mixes!"
"1","5","Delicious! Made these for a special 4th of July treat,and even the neighbors loved them! :)"
"1","1","I thought this recipe was pretty awful. they puffed up and then sunk in and didn't really even taste like chocolate. i followed it exact (minus the icing) i wouldn't make again."
"1","5","My friends referred to these as 'the pixie stick brownies.' With the frosting, they turn out super-sweet (which is how I like them!). The frosting was a little hard to spread, but very tasty. Try leaving the frosting in the mixing bowl on top of the oven while the brownies bake-- the heat makes it more spreadable. These turned out pretty gooey in the middle, but still sooo tasty. Not sure how others ended up with 'cakey' brownies, as mine were rich and gooey and sugary and HEAVENLY."
"1","5","Excellent recipe.I did as other had suggested and didn't add the baking powder and added a few chocolate chips to it. It worked fantastic! I didn't try the frosting though.."
"1","4","They were very good but way to mushy. I made them 2 times because the first time was like pudding. I even let them cool for an hour. The second time i added some more flour and let them bake 35 minutes and then let them sit for a longer time while i was out and they were a little bit better."
"1","5","These brownies are fantastic. I served them at a BBQ and everyone kept talking about them and how they were the best brownies they ever had. I had some leftover chocolate frosting from a cake recipe I had made earlier in the week, so I used that instead of the frosting included in the recipe. It was pretty similar in its contents though, and it was a perfect complement to the delicious brownies. I might make another batch of these and freeze them for a nice cold summer treat. These are, indeed, the best brownies. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","These are amazing!!! I've made them twice and my brothers and dad love them! I am making them again for father's day :)"
"1","4","Cake-like and not too sweet"
"1","4","These are good, but I have had better. I added a little dark chocolate bar, a little less sugar and did dark chocolate chips/walnuts for the top.(Didn't feel like doing the icing thing)"
"1","5","OMG!!! These are the bomb!! I'll never buy the box mix again!! Fabulous!!"
"1","3","these brownies didnt turn out as i expected at all. i expected the frosting to set but it stayed mushy so i melted chocolate on top to give a more sturdy top. they tasted very good though. next time i will probably try a canned frosting or different frosting recipe."
"1","5","Very good. Followed recipe as written except didn't make the frosting because I had some leftover chocolate frosting to use up. The brownie itself was very moist not dried out like some get and still is as good the next day. Will make again."
"1","5","The name says it all. I expected homemade brownies to be much harder to make than the boxed kind, but they were very simple and tasted SO much better. I just couldn't believe how much more I liked these! I'll never go back to store-bought. Thanks!"
"1","5","I've been searching for a good brownie recipe for a long time, and my search is finally over! These are the best brownies I have ever tasted. I took some advice from other users and left out the baking powder and added some chocolate chips. I didn't bother with the icing which was fine because it didn't need it. I will definately make it again. This recipe deserves more than five stars! Thank you! *************"
"1","5","These turned out really well. Very easy to make. The only thing I am going to do next time is double the recipe, as I prefer a slightly thicker brownie than what this made. Maybe first I'll try doing it 1 1/2 times, then move up to 2 if it isn't thick enough. But as far as taste goes, this is GREAT!"
"1","5","This is an amazing recipe!! These are the best brownies I have ever eaten!! Trust me I have tasted a lot of brownies, from fancy restaurants to gourmet specialty shops to down home cooking joints. Hands down these are it. In the past I have hated making brownies because half the time I do not have bakers chocolate in my pantry (always have coco powder though) and it always just seems not worth the trouble to go buy it, then melt it...etc. Brownies seemed like just a hassle to me before this recipe, but not any more. My only modification that I made was I used a little less egg due to the fact that I like my brownies to be really fudgey and not as cakey. Thanks Angie for the recipe."
"1","5","These brownies were fantastic. I doubled the recipe as my teens would have eaten it all without saving me a bite .. and it was superb. I also didn't add the baking powder as we prefer the less-cakey type brownies. I've made them several times now .. each time .. totally awesome. Thanks."
"1","3","i wasn't really impressed - still searching for a brownie recipe that's better that the godiva chocolate brownie mix."
"1","5","Fabulous recipe! As I do in all recipes, I changed it a little to suit my family's taste buds. I added 1/3 cup Jiffy peanut butter and 1/2 cup walnuts. Then I stirred 1/2 package Hershey's mini chocolate kisses into the batter and put the remaining kisses on top of the batter. Making it this way there was no need for frosting. It was a hit. Thanks so much."
"1","5","These are fantastic! I also omitted the baking powder to attain a denser brownie, but it didn't hurt them at all! They are so moist and rich. I did make one other substitution in the frosting. I added light corny syrup instead of the honey (didn't have any honey) and a sprinkle of water to moisten the mixture.  These would get a 6th star, if I could only offer that!  Definitly a keeper!"
"1","5","I like my brownies dense and fudgy and less cake-like, so I substituted butter-flavoured shortening for the butter and omitted the baking powder and salt. After about 15 minutes in the oven, these came out exactly how I wanted! I didn't even need to frost them (they developed a nice shiny, glazed top) and I normally add chocolate chips to the batter but these were good without them!"
"1","5","Very quick and easy to make. Did not make/use frosting-were great without. Perfect with a scoop of vanilla icecream."
"1","5","Awesome brownies! I left out the baking powder so they were nice and chewy! Just like the two-bite brownies you buy from the store. And instead of using honey in the icing i opted for a little water."
"1","5","Fearing cake-like brownies, I omitted the baking powder. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious."
"1","5","I didn't make the frosting. I don't think these brownies need it!"
"1","5","Truly Awesome!!! I added macadamia nuts and it tasted even better! Thank you for the great recipe."
"1","5","These are so good they should be illegal."
"1","5","great"
"1","1","The frosting was really weird and way too sweet...The brownies were okay though"
"1","2","Perhaps I am picky. Certainly not a good cook. But I just did not like these much. Tried them twice. I like thicker brownies and with the sugar amount suggested they are too sweet."
"1","5","These have a great brownie texture, not too cakey. I left off the icing and they were great!"
"1","5","Wow! These are awesome. And easy! I followed the recipe exactly, made them for a party and everyone raved about them. No more brownies from a box!"
"1","5","These were great! The entire pan disappeared within half an hour after I took them from the oven and the kids wanted more! I think the proportions are off in the frosting as it was too thick and dry. I just added some milk, and I used corn syrup instead of honey. Will definitely make again!"
"1","4","Pretty good. Very similar to a brownie recipe I made as a little girl. Only changes I made were to eliminate the honey and instead use milk. Make sure you check the time, I've made these a few times and they were always ready after just 22 minutes."
"1","5","These are the best brownies ever! I don't make the frosting because they are super rich and perfect without it. My friends loved it."
"1","5","These brownies are the bomb! They are definitely the best brownie recipe i've tried..and trust me, i've tried many! I added white chocolate chips to them and it made it even better..i've made them twice this week and will be making more very soon..this recipe is a keeper! Thank you!"
"1","4","These were good, although not the best. I do like the store-bought ones better, but that might just be my corrupted taste. I didn't think these were too cakelike, although they could have been more chewy and fudge-like. I recommend doubling the ingredients. Definitely don't overbeat ingredients!"
"1","4","I thought this recipe was very easy, and pretty good, but not exceptional. I have had much better brownies."
"1","4","These are exactly the kind of brownies I like. They are more 'cake-like' and that is what I love. The only thing I had a problem with was the frosting, it was really dry so we just didn't use it...it didn't really need it anyway. Great recipe. Will make again!"
"1","5","I've always been a total loser in baking but this recipe worked for me and my family likes it. So you can imagine how easy it is and what wonders it does!"
"1","5","These brownies are wonderful both frosted and unfrosted! We always double the recipe but only frost half."
"1","5","the name indicates everything!!!the BEST..even I put just half stick of butter in tead of one,it was still good but just a little bit dry,and i didn't frost it because we didn't have powder sugar and they were still good...!!!best recipe ever...next time i'll put full stick of butter and find powder sugar,try it!!"
"1","5","the hubbie looooooooved these brownies! I wasn't sure how they would turn out, esp. since I tried molasses in the frosting (at someone's suggestion)... it added an interesting taste, and he/we loved it (but he is the chocolate conniseur)"
"1","4","good but a little too buttery for my taste"
"1","5","easy and very delish! will definitely be making these again!"
"1","4","After reading the reviews and seeing how difficult it was to get these brownies out of the pan, I decided to try lining the pan with foil--DO NOT do this--I found it even harder to get the brownies off the foil. I also didn't agree with other reviewers that these brownies were cake-like because they didn't rise very much and they were actually quite chewy. I did like that I had all the ingredients and they were easy to make in one pan and they have a great flavor--I just wish they would have risen a bit more."
"1","5","Excellent Brownies. I changed the frosting because I did not want so much chocolate. Instead of 1 tsp vanilla I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract, I left out the cocoa powder, and added enough soy milk to make a good spreading consistency. I put the frosting on after the brownies cooled. Yum!"
"1","5","Awesome!"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. These turned out perfectly moist and tasted delicious. I did find them better with no icing - they're rich enough on their own."
"1","5","First time making homemade brownies. There were NONE left! Even after a huge Thanksgiving dinner. I used regular store bought frosting and Ghirardelli Cocoa. They came out so wonderfully. Definitely mix with a spoon. They come out fudgy and chocolatey!"
"1","5","These are the best brownies I've ever eaten and my roomated agrees! One recommendation: wait a minute or two before adding the eggs, otherwise they cook and you'll have egg-white bits."
"1","5","Very good and rich. I cut down on some sugar since I don't like it too sweet. DO NOT OVERCOOK, just like the recipe said, or your brownies will taste not as good. Check the brownies every couple minutes for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time. As soon as no paste or very little paste sticks to the toothpick it's done. SO GOOD!"
"1","1","This is the first one star rating I have ever given and I am not sure how this recipe got so many fives but I am not going to mess around modifying it to get there because it would be way too much experimenting. Although this recipe had some good chocolate flavor, it did not turn out brownie-like AT ALL all but rather like chocolate CAKE. Sorry for the poor rating but I thought I was making brownies."
"1","3","I followed recipe exactly, however I would stick with the boxed brownies"
"1","1","I would rather eat the box mix brownies."
"1","5","These were really great brownies. I don't even like chocolate much but these were still perfect. I could eat a million. My roommate said they weren't chocolaty enough so I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. They tasted great, and way more chocolatier."
"1","5","WOW! Two Thumbs Up! Anyone who says these aren't the best brownies ever didn't make them right. I made them exactly as the recipe read and they wre soooooooo delicious! Thank you Angie!"
"1","5","These brownies turn out perfectly everytime . . . and they're so easy to prepare. My family loves them, and I've never even made the frosting!! (Don't tell them that)."
"1","5","YUMMY, MADE W/ DARK CHOC."
"1","5","I know lots of people have rated this recipe but I have to put in my 2 cents! They are wonderful, and amazingly easy to put together and better than a box recipe. More or less powdered sugar can impact the dryness of the icing, but if that happens, all that's needed is an extra tablespoon of melted butter or a T of milk to loosen it up. Then it's plenty easy to spread, especially if the brownies are still warm. They really are the best!"
"1","5","I think that these were the best brownies i have ever tasted in my life!"
"1","5","very easy to make. soft and tasty. I didn't make the sauce so i dont know how that tastes. Excellent quick recipe."
"1","5","These brownies are rich, chocolatey, and DELICIOUS! I forgot to get the confectioner's sugar at the grocery store, so I made them without the frosting, and they still turned out great! These are just as good as brownies from a box, but without all the chemical preservatives and additives! I used all natural and organic ingredients (as I always do), and they were absolutely wonderful. I served them with vanilla ice cream fresh out of the oven, and they were a big hit! These brownies are rich, so a small serving packs a lot of taste. Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe... Adios to Store-Bought Brownies! This one's a keeper!"
"1","4","Great. Easy to make. Try marbeling in some cream cheese and a dash of raspberry syrup for variety."
"1","5","This brownie tasted better than the Wal-Mart brownie mix AND IT WAS JUST AS EASY TO MAKE!!!!!!!! I ran out of cocoa for the topping...so instead I put hugs kisses in the mix. It was delicious without the topping......I recommend if anyone needs a quick and delicious dessert......These ROCK!!!!!!"
"1","5","this is an alright recipe, I might have whipped the eggs too much. Its not the chocolateiest I've had."
"1","5","Super easy great brownies every time. These brownies stay moist forever!"
"1","5","These brownies are very dense and great for chocoholics! It is very easy to make, as I made them great, and i AM ONLY 13 YEARS OLD! Just make them in 30 mins! WOW!!!!!Amazing! Angie, these are THE BEST!"
"1","5","The brownie itself is perfect. Looks great and tastes great. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan and it fit just right. However, the frosting leaves a lot to be desired. I followed directions precisely and it was not spreadable. (Tasty, though!) I will definitely use the brownie recipe again, but I will use a better frosting."
"1","4","Very good- although I did have to add a bit of milk to the icing to make it spreadable..."
"1","5","baked to perfection, it is true they do always turn out!!"
"1","5","very good brownies except i used 2 tablespoon of vanilla on accident but it turned out great. doubled the recipe and put in a bigger pan let the frosting cool in the fridge for a little to thicken and put on brownies after i took out them out of the oven great brownies will make again"
"1","5","You can't go wrong with these."
"1","5","This recipe was SOOO good! my husband loved it!!!!"
"1","5","Although the brownies were a bit difficult to cut and take out of the pan, everyone went crazy for them and they were so easy to make!!...Oh just onething, I found I had to add a bit of water to the frosting while mixing it, as it came out too dry."
"1","4","Very good brownie just not the best brownie."
"1","5","These brownies were WONDERFUL!!! I agree with the review that said how could you give this recipe less than 5 stars. I am not much on brownies, but I could not leave these alone. I did double the recipe and add 5 eggs instead of 4 because my hubby likes cake-like brownies and they were still unbelievably moist. And have yet to make them with the frosting, which I will try the next time. Definitely a keeper!! Thank you!!"
"1","5","I like brownies as much as the next person, but I wouldn't call myself a brownie junkie or anything. That is, until I tried these brownies! I don't know what it is about them, but not only are they super-easy to make, always turn out great and are the perfect texture every time....there is also just something about the taste that make these totally addicting! The only change I made in this recipe was using half brown and half white suger in the brownie. You've GOT to try these!!"
"1","5","This is a really good 'basic' brownie recipe. As others have stated, it makes a good compromise between a fudgey and cake brownie (use less flour, and take away an egg white if you want it fudgier, use about 1-2 T more flour and add another egg if you want it more cake-like). The only thing I really changed is to use half brown sugar, and half white. I've made this before with a cup of chocolate chips (mix of semi-sweet, white, and milk chocolate) stirred in at the very end, and sprinkles on top just before baking. I've also tried this with a bit of orange zest and a teaspoon of orange extract...this is a recipe that can take on many variations--definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","these brownies rock! My 7-year-old son and I wrap them individually in foil and stick them in the freezer. When we want a chocolate treat, we grab one. They're even good cold!"
"1","5","These are amazing moist brownies, and simple to make! I used melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder, and it was DELICIOUS; grown-ups went crazy over them but I think that if I had made these for children, I would have used the cocoa powder or combined dark and milk chocolate. I didn't try the frosting, it looked so sweet... the best plain brownie recipe I've tried so far."
"1","5","What can I say they are what the name says. Excellant recipe."
"1","5","This will be my standby brownie recipe from now on- tastes very close to the Giradelli brownies out of the box (some of the best you can get) I am not sure what I think of the frosting though. I'd just assume not put any frosting on them- they are perfect as is!"
"1","3","So I got a can of Hershey's cocoa powder and lo-and-behold - almost the exact same recipe was on the back of the box! The two differences was that their recipe didn't have the frosting part and it was titled 'Hershey's Best Brownies.' I do have to agree with what one other reviewer said about the frosting...the honey does make it taste a bit off (in my personal opinion). If one was to make this with a frosting, I would probably opt for a different frosting recipe or one out of the can. I also encountered a problem when making the frosting - when I tried to mix all the ingredients together, they just balled up into little balls and wouldn't blend until I started slowly adding a bit of milk bit by bit to help smooth it out. The brownie itself was pretty good - not too bad, not great. A bit heavy on the butter side, but I understand most brownie recipes tend to be. If you like heavy brownies, this is great, but again, opt for a different frosting."
"1","5","Best ever, chocolate lovers will agree! some modifications i made- 50g white sugar and 150g brown sugar. And i added almond essence and vanilla essence. i like my brownies fudgy so i baked them for about 22 minutes. Have not tried the frosting though..."
"1","5","My 8 year old daughter made this today (by herself)and it turned out wonderfully moist and delicious. Definately a keeper!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness, soooo yummy. These came out awesome. I ran out of vanilla extract after I made the batter, so for the frosting I ended up having to use almond extract. It was actually pretty darn good, and I might do it like that next time too, only half vanilla/half almond, as the flavor was pretty strong. Regardless, these were really delicious and I will definitely be making them again. Thanks!"
"1","5","I have been baking for many years, first time making this brownie recipe. I sifted the flour and cocoa power together. Also used 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar. Baked 25 minutes exactly. These are SUPURB!!! Great flavor, and perfect brownie texture, not too chewy not too cakey. This will be the only brownie recipe from now on."
"1","4","The taste is chocolatey and satisfying and the ease of the recipe is fabulous! I only cooked for 20 minutes as suggested by some other reviewers, but next time I will leave in a tad longer - right now it's like have a dense, gooey fudge so I'm not complaining. I thought the icing was on the sweet side - but it's fun to indulge every now and then!"
"1","5","Another 5* review. I followed the recipe exactly, the only expception being I added approx. 2TBS of milk to the frosting to get the consistency I wanted. To my husband and I these seem more like chocolate cake. Didn't turn out fudgy, but still incredibly delicious! For a more fudgy brownie I will still use Ghiradelli box mix, but for a cake brownie this is it!!"
"1","5","sooo good! you'll never use a box again! Doesn't make much batter though, may want to increase by about 1/2 to make a nice thick brownie."
"1","4","Quite good. Very easy to make, came out tasty. I used this to make Rocky Road brownies - topped brownies with mini marshmallows, nuts and some chocolate chips, then put frosting over that. Very good and gooey, but almost too much! Nonetheless, the brownies themselves were very good."
"1","5","I can only sum this up in one DELICIOUS!!!"
"1","5","These brownies are just plain sinful!! They are so rich and yummy. I could have eaten the whole pan but they made my teeth hurt they were so rich and sweet. The only problem that I had was this. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and they were no where close to done after 25 minutes. I baked them for approximately 40 minutes and they still could have used a little longer. I also had to add a tablespoon of milk to my icing because I just couldn't get it to smooth out. Other than that, these brownies are just a little slice of heaven on earth! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!!!"
"1","5","made 'em lotsa times, johnny always expects these if he hears that brownies will be made..."
"1","4","My first brownie attempt... They were pretty good, but I'm still looking for the restaurant-like dense brownie!"
"1","5","All I can say is 'WOW'!!!!!!!!! This is the most moist brownie I've ever eaten and the frosting...out of this world!"
"1","5","Yum! I didn't know homemade brownies could taste so good! I'll never use brownie mix again..."
"1","5","These really are the best! I almost always have the ingredients on hand and you can make them so fast and easy. They are better than any box mix too!"
"1","5","GREAT!! MY FROSTING WAS A LITTLE TOO THICK SO I JUST ADDED A TEASPOON OF MILK - JUST PERFECT!"
"1","5","great- although this is the EXACT recipe off of the hershey's cocoa can."
"1","5","These make great vegan brownies. Substitute 1/4 c. canola oil and 1/4 c applesauce for the butter, and 1/2 c. pureed tofu for the eggs. Trust me, they are good and you don't taste any of that 'weird' stuff."
"1","5","These brownies are EXCELLENT and VERY chewy. They also stay fresh for a long time- a week later and they are still fantastic!"
"1","4","For the record, I'm not a big chocolate lover. But I looved this recipe - should have called them 'Butter Brownies.' My husband, on the other hand, didn't like them at all. Not fudgy enough for him, like cake as others have said. So to balance us out I'll give it 4 stars. (We did not make the frosting.)"
"1","5","This is a fantastic recipe! The brownies came out moist and fudge-like! Yummy! I did use a mixer to cream the frosting together and added a few drops of milk. I also added 1/2 bag of chocolate chips I had on hand. Next time I will add nuts! Great recipe and so simple to make!"
"1","5","I found this recipe here several years ago and have used it since. I love it...easy and delicious! I make it without the frosting and sometimes add chocolate chunks. Everyone I serve them to loves them too. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!"
"1","5","yummy!"
"1","4","These brownies were very good and just as easy to make as a boxed mix. I would make again, but the frosting has to be missing an ingredient because it was powdery and totally dry (I think another reviewer said sawdust, I agree). I added some half and half (or you could use milk) to get the consistency I liked."
"1","5","I think this is a great recipe. Two things to make life easier: 1) I line my baking dish with aluminum foil. 2) Use a food processor to mix the icing since the icing is so thick. Because of the butter it will melt and be spreadable if you add as soon as the brownie comes out of the oven."
"1","4","Scrumptious, and really quick to make. The texture of the brownies was really soft, which is just the way I like it. I found the frosting a bit difficult to make. Next time I wont use the honey and I'll add some more butter. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks."
"1","5","My new favorite brownie recipe. So ooey gooey. I doubled the recipe & took the advice of some others for the frosting. I only needed about 1/2 the powdered sugar in the recipe. I didn't have any honey so I used caramel ice cream topping. They were gone fast!"
"1","1","not fudgy. had a bad chocolate flavor. needs more than chocolate powder."
"1","2","didn't turn out well, maybe because the pan was too big. wouldn't make it again since it came out more like a cake than a brownie"
"1","5","I did a taste test with another brownie recipe from this site (chewy cocoa brownies) and these were definitely better (the others were very good though). The only thing I did differently was to ice them with the german chocolate cake frosing II recipe from this site instead of the frosting listed. I'm sure this frosting is terrific but we wanted something different and we weren't disappointed. Will make these again and again."
"1","5","These brownies were very tasty. Had family over for dinner/dessert and they lasted all of 10 minutes tops. I added some pecans in to the mix. Personally, I thought they were a bit too chocolatey, (but I'm not a big chocolate fan). I will definitely make these again, however, I will cut back on the cocoa next time."
"1","5","These brownies are fabulously rich & delicious. I have made them several times & they're always a hit. Very easy--only change to recipe: When preparing the frosting, I have to add 1-2 tbsp. water so it's not so thick."
"1","4","Everyone in my family loved these brownies but made a suggestion for next time. They thought nuts would make them even better. These were very fudgey and chewy, so if this is the type of brownie you prefer ( I like cake-y myself) you will enjoy these! Great recipe!"
"1","5","These are by far the best brownies I've ever had! The made from scratch way is 10 times better than any boxed brand!"
"1","5","Warning, these brownies will cause you to make them twice in 2 days (like me). But it's worth it!!!! :) :)"
"1","5","These brownies... delicious! We've come to call the frosting 'Magic Frosting'- can make even yucky desserts taste yummy!"
"1","5","very easy and simple to make, my boyfriend ate the whole thing in one night"
"1","3","This recipe was average. My husband and I liked the brownies, but the frosting was not very impressive. I would also suggest reducing the baking time as the brownies were overcooked."
"1","5","These were fantastic! Very rich and fudgy. Everyone loved them. Thanks!"
"1","2","I thought these brownies were too cocoa-ish and the icing was way too sweet. I was embarrassed to even put them out for a picnic. I won't be making these again."
"1","5","I love these brownies they came out perfect at 30 min and tasted delicious i didnt even make frosting i just sprinkled on some powdered sugar and they were perfect! i highly recomend baking these! =)"
"1","5","decadent is the most accurate description i can give... doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, it really is neither cakey nor fudgy, just fabulous, will definitely make again!! boyfriend took one bite and said 'ohmygod'... thanks a lot!!!"
"1","4","Delightful. I made these for a friend's birthday. They are moist, soft, chocolate goodness. I liked how the brownie frosting required only mixing, and no heating. I frosted them immediately after taking brownies out of oven, which made spreading it much easier since it semi-melted (it hardened up after a few minutes and by being semi-melted it seemed to soak more into the brownies.) The birthday boy liked them. 12/19- Made them again for Christmas baggies. Yum. Turned out better the second time,when I doubled the recipe."
"1","5","These are EXCELLENT!! They are the only brownies I make. I have made these several times with and without the frosting and they are good either way and so easy to throw together. I will never use a boxed mix again."
"1","2","This was FAR too thin...far too SWEET and were so cakey!! After cooking it for 30 mins, they were STILL uncooked and all gooey...The icing was TOO sweet and just horrendous..Sorry but I will not be doing this ever again"
"1","3","These are ok, but not the best. I found the frosting to be way too sweet for my taste. Also, the brownie itself was not chocolatey enough nor was it moist enough."
"1","5","These are soooo good! I would definitely say to try this recipe. I thought from the other reviews that it would be cakey, but it was fudgy and great. My family LOVES fudgy brownies. I reduced the powdered sugar in the frosting and it was great. To the brownies I added some broken up mint patties. If you like mint at all, you'd love this! The whole pan was almost gone after only 2 hrs. of being out of the oven!"
"1","5","One word: DELECTABLE! These were incredibly easy and delicious. I like my brownies really fudgy, so I took one minute off the bake time and they were perfect. They were done, but still a little gooey. My husband says the icing was too rich, but I loved it, so next time I'll only frost half to please us both. These are NOT a waste of time. They are nothing short of awesome!"
"1","5","These are really good. I ended up making two batches because I wasn't satisfied with the first. I thought they were too shallow and didn't like the consistency of the frosting. On the second batch I did one and a half of all ingredients which worked perfectly for a nice full brownie. I doubled the frosting which made more to spread out. The frosting is really crumbly but melts in your mouth. I will definitly save this recipe."
"1","4","I've baked brownies for the first time ever. They were tasty, but much too sweet. I got disappointed, because I wanted them to become fudgey, but they weren't:("
"1","5","Fabulous recipe! Fudgey and chewy and just divine. The second time, I subbed the sugar with 1/2 cup light brown and 1/2 cup regular and added a tsp of dried coffee to the dry mix to make mocha brownies. Came out great."
"1","5","This was a very good recipe- a perfect combination of cakey and gooey. The frosting was a little too thick, so I added a couple of tablespoons of milk. Other than that, it was perfect. I liked that the frosting hardened so the brownies can be cut and stacked without sticking to each other."
"1","4","Sometimes you make a brownie that just blows your mind. This was not one of those brownies. I like it quite a lot though! I am usually quite skeptical of adding frosting to brownies, but these would not have been good without it. I loved the fudgy icing, but the brownie itself seemed slightly dry, and cakey. (I tend to go for the fudgy brownies though, so if you like cake like ones, these ROCK) Anyway, I think next time I will try using some choclote syrup before baking as one user suggested. They were gobbled when I took them to work though. I will make again. Thanks!"
"1","5","These are so chewy and moist and the frosting makes them truely the best. I never really liked brownies that much so I make them for the kids, but these are definately different and better than any I've tried. I will never make boxed brownies again, only these."
"1","5","These brownies are the greatest! I loved them and so did my family. I definitly think that they are better than mix and I didn't have to go to the store for the ingredients. I had them all on hand. So easy and well worth the time."
"1","5","Woops! I packed the icing sugar and I guess I shouldn't have, because the icing was more of a lumpy powder. I saved it by adding a touch of cream and it came out shiny and lovely. Yum!"
"1","5","This recipe works really well if you double it and use it in a 9x13 inch pan! They turn out every time and are so easy to make!"
"1","5","LOVE the flavor of these so much better than box mixes. But you do need to ice them immediately out of the oven while they're hot - it's a pretty thick icing and putting it on the hot brownies makes it easier to spread - rubber spatula is best."
"1","5","My first attempt to making homemade brownies and it was great! I added a 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. They are different from the box but they are equally as good. Also I added a teaspoon of milk to the frosting like the reviews said. It was fabulous!"
"1","3","They're good, but they taste more like a dense cake than brownies."
"1","5","If you are a chocolate lover these are for you!!! They are very rich, I loved them."
"1","5","I have tried many, many brownie recipies and mixes searching for that 'perfect, chewy brownie'. Finally my search is over. If you try this recipie once, you'll never make another. I double the recipie since the original only makes an 8x8 pan. By doubling the ingredients, you can use a typical 9x13 pan with good results, or for a large gathering, x4 the recipie, bake in a half sheet pan. Enjoy."
"1","5","AMAZING. there's nothing more to say."
"1","5","These were delicious. I didn't add the frosting because of some of the reviews. I followed some of the suggestions and used 1/2 white, and 1/2 brown sugar, and added a cup of chocolate chips. And I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 baking pan. This is a keeper recipe!"
"1","5","I've made this recipe several times and it turns out perfect every single time. They take no time to make and tast better than any box brownie mix I've made."
"1","5","Wonderful! Moist, chewy, not at all cakey. These were really fantastic. I even loved the icing, although I didn't like the vanilla flavour in it. I'll leave the vanilla out of the icing next time.  A great basic recipe!"
"1","5","I've never before made brownies from scratch but my daughter and I just HAD to have some chocolate and I had everything here on hand so we gave it a try.  Excellent! Best brownie I personally have ever tried. I will never again buy a brownie mix.  Yes, the frosting IS thick, but I only let my brownies cool about 5 minutes and was able to carefully spread the thick frosting without tearing the brownies.  These are even better tasting the next day!"
"1","4","The brownies were really good. They had a perfect brownie taste. The consistency was a bit doughy but that could just mean I should've baked them longer. They are extremely sweet and rich with the frosting so you can have a small piece and you are good to go the rest of the day. Very good."
"1","5","My kids love these!"
"1","5","These were so good that I better not make them again too soon as my waistline can't take it. The only thing I did different was to add chopped pecans. I used the recipe for icing but needed to add a little milk to make it spreadable. Thanks for a keeper."
"1","5","I've made many brownies before but this recipe yielded the best results. They turned out nice and chewy, just the way I like them. I couldn't wait for the brownies to cool down and ended up eating almost half of it right out of the oven! Will definitely make these again."
"1","4","The brownie recipe doubled very well for a 9x13 pan, but I changed the recipe slightly. I melted the butter in the microwave (quicker and less dishes) and I had to bake the brownies for 35 minutes before a toothpick came out clean (possibly because the recipe was doubled). I made the frosting without the honey and added milk to help with spreadability, though I'm sure the brownies would've still been good without it."
"1","5","Got a chocolate craving? You won't after eating these! I made a couple of changes- I omitted the baking powder (I like my brownies chewy, not fluffy),and doubled the recipe. The frosting came out nicely, however I did have to add a splash of milk otherwise it would have been concrete. These are best when they are fresh, after a couple of days in the fridge they aren't too good."
"1","5","it's a wonderful recipe, but I was expecting more a fudgy type of brownies - not this cakey type of brownies. However, I am very pleased with this recipe...bravo!!!!! thanks for sharing this yummy recipe."
"1","4","Very easy and yummy:) I added a capful of maple flavouring which intenisified the flavour. First ever homemade brownies made... and will certainly not be the last for this recipe!Thanks;)"
"1","5","I have been making these brownies for my family for 3 years and they love them!! They come out perfect every time. Thank you Angie!"
"1","5","I am queen of the brownies and these are IT!!!! My search has ended. I do sift my dry ingredients together to get the lumps out of the cocoa powder. THANKS!!!!"
"1","5","This was a very good brownie recipe! My family loved them. Cake like texture if eaten right after they are baked but more of a dense brownie taste the next day (after refrigeration). I don't think these would taste as good without the frosting... So Yummy!!!"
"1","4","I added more cocoa powder and about 1 cup of chopped dark chocolate, and used 1/2 and 1/2 white and brown sugar as suggested in other reviews. Have now made these about 6 times, once as a birthday present for a friend. Adding 1tbsp instant coffee powder made up with 1tbsp hot water gives a nice tang, or try adding the zest of an orange, or a handful of walnuts. Gorgeous fudgy brownies which satisfy the chocolate urge!!"
"1","3","I did not make the frosting but I found the brownies to be too cake like. However, the flavor was good."
"1","5","I followed the advice of other readers and did not frost the brownies. I also added chocolate chip and shopped pecns which gave added zest"
"1","3","I liked them, but didn't love them. They were dense, but I probably should have added chocolate chips or something. And I wasn't crazy about the frosting. I don't know if it was the honey, or not, but I wasn't crazy about the taste of it."
"1","4","Moist, chewy and very yummy. I did not care for the frosting much. They are better without."
"1","5","This is a really cool recipe! I had every ingrediant in my cuboards from the start! It makes hardly any dishes and is easy and quick! I have my first batch in the oven right now(2:29pm dec. 14/03) and can't wait to share them with all my friends! I couldn't find any good recipes in my cookbooks, but I found this site and recipe. thank you for setting this site up! I will be back. Oh! there went the timer! Let my go check on them....................... WOW! they look REALLY good!!!!!! mmmmmmm........ Tip: put choco. chips (point down) into the still warm squares of delight and dust with powdered sugar. Bon Appitiet!"
"1","5","I've made these brownies about five times so far. They always turn out and I'm not a very good baker. I do use store bought frosting though, love the thickness and creaminess."
"1","5","These brownies were wonderful! I will use box mixes, but they never come out fudgey enough for me. These were chewy, soft, and moist - absolutely delicious! I made some for my husband and myself and we annihilated the pan within an hour, without the frosting! This will be my brownie from here on out!"
"1","3","Hmmm.... I just don't think these are all that special. Mine took the full 30 minutes to bake, and they were still kind of soft in the middle (though done on the edges). I also thought they were too sugary, as opposed to chocolatey. Don't get me wrong, I liked them just fine, but these aren't the 'best' brownies IMHO."
"1","5","Great and easy recipe! Please try it, you'll love it! Much beter than any box mix! Thanks."
"1","5","i think this is the best bronie recipe the worst thing is that i live in egypt and theres no choclate chips to do the other recipes. angie your the best."
"1","5","I've made these before and I must say that even being a picky brownie eater I love these. They are better than any other recipie I've found and have the perfect balance of all the right taste and texture to please everyone! It's a definite winner!!"
"1","5","These are excellent and very easy to make. I like that you can make it all in one pot. I doublded the recipe and baked in a 13x9 dish. I did use 1/2 cup cocoa (1 cup if you double). I did not make the frosting since we all like them plain. I think I'd put some nuts on top next time. Definitely will make again (soon)."
"1","5","They are sooo.. good and soo rich.. very easy to make.. i would make them again.."
"1","5","I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, used 1/2 c. instead of 1/3 c. cocoa. The brownies themselves turned out great. Then I tried the frosting. I had to come back online to see if I'd forgotten something. I guess my butter wasn't softened enough, but it made like a cocoa crumble. I sat the bowl (stainless) on the back burner of the stove where the oven vents and after a few minutes it melted a little. Then I beat it again and it made what another reviewer called 'play-doh' like consistency. I wasn't optimistic, but spread it over the warm brownies and as it spread it became a glossy smooth frosting. When I cut them they were absolutely perfect.....chewy, moist, yummy!!!! Mine were thin like box brownies not like cake but I like them like that.   This is a really good EASY recipe and I'll make it again more confidently next time....haha"
"1","5","I made the frosting without the honey, this cut the sweetness a bit."
"1","2","The frosting was good (you must melt the butter to get frosting to right consistency). Brownies themselves were just so-so. Wouldn't make again, prefer the Ghiradelli's much more. Sorry."
"1","5","this brownies turned out so delicious. i used 200 gr dark cooking chocolate instead of cocoa powder and reduced the sugar of 3 tbsp. the chocolate bars should be melted along with butter. it's just right, thanks angie!"
"1","4","These turned out wonderfully. I didn't even make the icing part. They were very moist and had a great 'not-too-terribly-sweet, just chocolatey enough' flavor. Will definitely make again. Thanks!"
"1","5","great recipe! i only had about 1/6 of a cup of cocoa powder so i melted about 1/3 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. they still came out delicious...really moist and chewy. my only complaint with the recipe is that it doesnt make enough!"
"1","5","The recipe's title says it all! They are sooo good!!! I doubled the recipe and got moist, chocolatey brownies and I also put a little milk in the frosting to make it more spreadable. But these were a hit at my house! Thanks, Angie!"
"1","5","very good and easy!!"
"1","4","I was abit nervous at first when the frosting was so thick that it wouldn't spread over the brownies-but it worked great. They tasted good to."
"1","5","Great! Thank you! Although I only needed 1/2 cup sugar for the icing. Thanks!"
"1","5","I have found a homemade brownie recipe that is fantastic. I have made these a few times with and without the icing. Always great!"
"1","5","As a guaranteed 100% choco-holic....... I have to say this IS the best brownie recipe I've ever found! They're like 'Two-Bite Brownies' but with an icing twist!!! YUM YUM"
"1","5","Wow - these brownies are awesome and soooo easy! 10 stars ... LOL"
"1","5","This was an excellent home made recipe for brownies. I always buy the boxed Duncan Hines Fudge Brownies.   Changes: I would double this recipe (although I didn't this time, I will in the future). For an 8x8 square pan, the brownies are really flat. Also, I didn't have any honey on hand for the frosting so I used a tablespoon of cream cheese and it worked perfectly - helped make it creamier.   All around good job with this one - everyone likes it."
"1","3","These were good, but not as good as the 'Chewiest Brownies' on the same site. These are better if you like a drier brownie. Not bad, just not the best."
"1","5","These were the Best Brownies. I added milk chocolate chips and pecans and they were great. The Brownies were so good we did not want to wait to put the frosting on them. Will definitely make them again."
"1","4","These brownies are really good. I found them perfectly fudgy and the taste was perfect. The only thing i had trouble with was the frosting. I found that there were too many dry ingrediants and it didn't mix well. I took the advice of others and added a tiny bit of milk and that helped with the consistency. Overall this is a great brownie recipe."
"1","4","I love brownies, and these were good. I added some chocolate chunks, which was even better. However, what I liked the best was the icing! I don't normally like icing on brownies, and this was really good... not too sugary. However, I ran short on butter so I substituded 3 tablespoons of cream cheese for the butter in the icing, and it turned out great! Thanks!"
"1","5","these brownies turned out so perfectly! I topped them with chocolate pudding, sweetened sour cream, rasberries and blueberries. Everyone loved it!"
"1","5","These brownies are fantastic and live up to their name. Easy to make and surpass store-bought dry mixes in flavor. Wonderful!"
"1","4","I thought that the recipe was very easy (with the exception of the icing, which did not turn out right) and I will make them again; however,I would not market them as 'best brownies ever'."
"1","5","These brownies are the greatest and so easy to make. I put the frosting on when it was hot and served the brownies while still warm. Totally awesome!!"
"1","4","A little gooey but delicious. Melt chocolate chips on top and spread around to  make a great, faster icing. They went quick with my friends!!"
"1","5","before this none of the brownies i had tried turned out...and these were amazing!! like really really good!! the frosting isnt crumbly if you melt the butter all the way and then mix.....hope you all like as much as i did! i am making them for my mom for mothers day....and snacking in the process (lol) hope she likes em as much as i do!!"
"1","5","Very good, easy brownie recipe.  Definitely worthwhile to double recipe and add chocolate chips."
"1","5","These brownies are the best ever!!! I add about a teaspoon of sour cream to the frosting to make it more spreadable. Definitely make the day before you plan on eating them."
"1","5","Always moist, not dry, excellent flavor and they really do always turn out."
"1","5","These brownies were terrific! I think maybe some of the negative reviews were from folks who just didnt read or follow directions correctly. Thanks Angie!"
"1","4","pretty good... just a little on the sweet side. i would make these again, but maybe with a little less sugar. we didn't like the icing very much, it was just too, too sweet and we found the honey-flavor a bit off (besides, the brownies are sweet enough on their own). but the texture of the brownie was great! smooth, velvety, chewy!"
"1","4","I literally made these brownies on my way out the door, after realizing I was leaving the sitter with practically bare cupboards. That's what I enjoy most about this recipe. It's easy and efficient. One pot, one pan. I start the butter melting and then gather the remaining ingredients. By the time I've done that, the butter is ready to go. I let the butter rest just a moment and then complete the recipe as instructed using the same pot. This recipe results in a fudgey brownie and is not for those interested in perfecting the cake-like brownie. Best chocolate flavor will be achieved using a high quality dutch processed cocoa in my opinion. I have not attempted the frosting recipe attached. I simply left a can of the store bought on the counter for the sitter."
"1","5","Fantastic. I made these in a dutch oven when we were camping and they turned out perfectly."
"1","5","These are fabulous - I have never made brownies from scratch and these came out perfect! They were the perfect brownie combination - not too cakey not too fudgey. - I added chocolate chunks to the top - yum!"
"1","5","They really are the best brownies. Super easy, simple ingredients, and turned out great. Dense and chewy. I only baked mine for 25 minutes and might actually go a few minutes less next time. I used white icing to frost them, they were a big hit."
"1","4","These were very tasty, but a little too fudgy for my tastes."
"1","5","These brownies are awesome! I didn't make the frosting either (it would probably be way too sweet with it). I sprayed my 8x8 pan with Baker's Joy (it already has flour in it - a lot of people don't like it, but it works for me - I'm lousy at 'flouring' my pans). The brownies are kind of fudgy on the inside with nice crisp edges. I cooked mine for 30 minutes. The best part is that I ALWAYS have the ingredients on hand for these - and they are SUPER quick to make! They will be a new family favorite forever. My husband - who is not a big brownie fan - adores these."
"1","4","I don't know what I did wrong, but my brownies turned out a sunken mess. They did taste very good so I will try them again. Need to put frosting on right after they come out of the pan, I didn't and tore up the top of the brownies because the frosting is so thick. But I will try again."
"1","5","Thank you Angie for the great recipe. The brownies are still delicious without frosting!"
"1","4","These were excellent tasting brownies, however the texture was a little more fudgey than I like. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks so much for sharing."
"1","5","These brownies were amazing! Really fudgy and chewy. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter and they were a chocolate lover's dream!"
"1","5","I added bourbon instead of honey.Brownies are truly the 'Best Ever.' Don't be afraid of the thick frosting.Place scoops on top of hot brownies and it melts into a perfect frosting with a little pushing around!"
"1","5","Angie- these were wonderful. I just got married and my husband loved these!!! Thank you so much. The icing was great with that bit of honey."
"1","5","These brownies are awesome! The pan was gone in a day! I skipped the icing topping and they were still great! Thank you, Angie!"
"1","5","these were great! a combination of all things brownie..moist, without being cakey, and chocolately without being too sweet! I always add chocoalte chips to mine. actually, I think I'll go make a batch right now!"
"1","5","These brownies were wonderful! Great flavor and very easy to make. I will never use a mix again! They were gone in one evening. I will be making them again very soon this time. I did not have to make any adjustments, though you could add nuts if you like."
"1","5","Great one pan recipe. This is now the only brownie recipe I use. I haven't tried the icing as I like them plain. Thank you Angie."
"1","5","These are very good. I didn't frost them because I was pressed for time, but they were still really good."
"1","5","Angie, you have done yourself proud! These are the best brownies I have ever had. The frosting is really good. I love chocolate, so I will be making these again. Thank You."
"1","4","These brownies were easy to make and tasted pretty good, but just weren't what I was expecting with all these great reviews. There's a brownie that sells 7-11, I think it's called 'ye olde fashioned brownie' this tastes EXACTLY like that w/o the walnuts. The icing was a bit too sweet for my liking, next time I'll cut back a bit on the honey and powdered sugar, but I'll be holding on to this recipe."
"1","5","These brownies are great! I will never buy a box mix again."
"1","5","This was my first try at scratch brownies, they were Great. My husband just loved them and can't wait till I make them again."
"1","5","Very easy to make and delicious. I don't think I'll ever bake brownies from a mix again. I told my husband that these brownies were called the Best Brownies and he agreed that they are the best!"
"1","5","I made these brownies for my husband and his co-workers. Everyone loved them. They didn't stay on the plate long. The perfect brownies for sure."
"1","5","i didn't try the frosting this time but these brownies are the best brownies i've ever tasted that were home made!!! and my hubby and 5 yr old agree."
"1","3","considering the brownie mishaps i've had in the past, i should be thrilled with these. true, the taste is wonderful but they were somewhat flat. maybe i'll double the recipe next time but use only a slightly larger pan...???"
"1","5","Delicious! Very moist and chewy but not too heavy. Very simple to make, also. I'll definitely make these again."
"1","5","These brownies were AWESOME! Quick, easy and DELICIOUS! I found this recipe after being asked to bring a dessert at the last minute and was completely thrilled when I realized just how easy they really were to make! And once again, they were absoluetly DELICIOUS! Try them yourself!"
"1","5","I made this receipe a couple of days ago and I have to say that it was very good. I loved the brownie in a box because it has a slight crust to it and I was happy to know that this one had one too. In fact I probably will make another batch tomorrow since the one I made last only a day. My son he's two kept on tugging one of us to the kitchen and would point to the pan, that he wanted another one."
"1","5","These are really good! Not too chocolate-y, but still great! And very easy to make...thanks!"
"1","5","Grrreat! Don't bother with boxed mixes again after trying this. It is so easy and delicious. The end result even produces that faint, crispy brown crust on top. Yum."
"1","5","The simplicity of this recipe does not hint at the supremely rich chocolate flavor of this treat. My only caveat is that you MUST double the recipe -- it disappears, and quickly."
"1","4","this recipe was nice and simple although it didn't turn out as fudgy as I like them to be. I didnt make the frosting either. it was still very good!"
"1","5","I made these brownies for Thanksgiving. I had never attempted to bake ANYTHING before, but my daughter loves brownies. This recipe was SO simple and delicious. Anyone can do it, even a beginner like me. By the way, my daughter took all of the leftovers home with her. Guess I'll have to make them again...."
"1","5","I ALWAYS use this recipe when I'm in the mood for brownies. It always turns out perfectly, and is enjoyed hearily by all. I like to add different nuts or toppings (such as almond toffee, frostings, etc). I always have these ingredients on hand, and it's SOOOO super easy to make! I've tried tons of the brownie recipes here and this one is the best."
"1","3","I was somewhat disappointed in the taste. Guess I'm spoiled to the brownies I've been making since 1975. Haven't found a brownie recipe yet that can top them."
"1","5","These brownies are just great! I always double the amounts and bake alittle longer. I don't think it needs any frosting on them at all. However, having 4 boys and a husband, I can never seem to keep the brownies in the pan until they're cooled off enough to even attempt to frost them. The little buggers 'steal' pieces of it when ever my back is turned. :)"
"1","2","These were very cakey, not at all chewy and gooey like I was looking for."
"1","4","This recipe was so easy and quick, and the end product was the best!!!!!!! very yummy"
"1","5","Just have to say that this is the second time I've made these delicious brownies in a week! This is the only brownie recipe I'm ever going to make from here on out. The smaller sized pan is a definite plus- just the right size for my boyfriend and I. This brownie recipe is also versatile and fun to toy with. They taste great plain, or frosted. They are the perfect snack!"
"1","5","These really ARE the 'best brownies' even better the next day if they last that long."
"1","5","These are the best brownies Ive ever made!And they always come out the same every time.If you want them thicker I just double the recipe.You  cannot go wrong with these."
"1","5","These were good, I would say a cross between a brownie and cake. I cheated and used icing out of a can. I only needed half the icing so I will make them again next week. My 13 & 10 year old really liked them. They are a keeper and really really easy especially with the store bought icing."
"1","5","This is an awesome brownie recipe! It is NOT for the faint of heart, but for die hard choco-holics like my family and me, they were a big success!! Very rich and delicious and sooo easy to make. The frosting AND the brownies turned out perfect...I will make these again and again..."
"1","5","this was absolutely excellent! i kid you not =) it's so simple, and the ingredients are very basic ones that you probably already have. it came out perfect and didn't break or fall apart when i cut it into cubes (unlike all the other brownies i've made before). but both my sis and i didn't care for the icing, so i scraped it off in the end. thanks for sharing..."
"1","3","My brownies turned out like chocolate cake. They weren't chewy like I thought they would be. The icing just stayed powder. I think it needed more butter but I didn't have the patience for it. My 4 year old son liked these. I think I will look for another one."
"1","3","maybe i did something wrong but mine turned out to be a chocolate cake. however it did satisfy my sweet tooth and was a very good cake."
"1","5","WOW! That's all I can say. These brownies are so simple and delicious. I had all the ingredients just sitting around, too. It turned out fabulous, I didn't have to change a thing. The icing turned out to have the perfect consistency, I don't see why anyone had to add milk. I did however substitute the sugar for a no-cal sweetner, but that's just me."
"1","5","My family is always looking for a treat and with this delicious brownie recipe all of our children's friends flock over when they hear that I've made brownies. What better way to spend a wintery Saturday night at home watching movies along with a bowl of popcorn and these brownies! Believe me you will not be disappointed with this one! All I can say is make sure you have plenty of milk on hand."
"1","5","This is a great recipe -- very simple. Someone had said that their brownies tasted stale the first day, and I would suspect that that is because they used old/stale butter. Because these are fantastic! I do like using butter-flavored shortening instead of real butter. Gives it a richer flavor. I didn't use the icing though -- they are rich enough without it!"
"1","4","This is a cake brownie that comes out with a flat top perfect for frosting. I sifted powder sugar on top because I think that makes a brownie look more festive. But after tasting I can tell the frosting would be better with this recipe."
"1","5","This is truly the best brownie recipe. The ingredients are soo simple and everytime I make them they come out perfect. Being a teenager, My very hungry guy friends always come over and eat my cooking and they seem to favor this recipe out of all the many goodies i make. I'm gonna try to add nuts next time or raisens and instead of the frosting (which i think makes it way to sweet) i load on some powdered sugar. They are very good and very fudgy! THE BEST."
"1","5","I have been looking for soft good brownies like this for a long time, and I finally found them. I never did like boxed brownies, but these are soft, taste terrific, and smell wonderful when they come out of the oven!"
"1","5","ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. AND THEY REALLY NEVER FAIL. THANK YOU"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! Beautiful brownies! They were the first Brownies I have ever made, being Australian, they don't have them there. I'm trying to diet, but I couldn't resist having another one of these, my son also loved them!"
"1","5","TO: K8320  Recipe called for baking POWDER not SODA. Perhaps that's what went wrong for you. I believe that would definitely make them flat."
"1","3","this recipe has a few kinks which need to be worked out all the butter int the recipe rises to the top and the end product looks like a toffe."
"1","3","Tasted good, but way too crumbly."
"1","5","These brownies are easy to make and excellent!! I doubled the recipe (made what the recipe called for twice) in order to make the brownies thicker because they would be too thin otherwise. These are really fudgey brownies and the frosting makes them even fudgier. If you like chocolate, these are the best brownies to make--hence the name :) Thank you for the recipe. I think they would be even better with walnuts."
"1","3","The brownie part turned out pretty flat, and yes, I added the exact amount of baking soda that the recipe called for. But the frosting was great. Maybe next time I'll double the brownie recipe to make them thicker."
"1","5","Brownies don't get any better than this."
"1","5","I thought these were very good. They are a deep, rich, homemade brownie. My kids, however, thus far raised on box mixes, missed the gooey, half-baked consistency of boxed brownies. What do they know anyway?! :-)"
"1","5","I am a hopeless chocoholic and these really hit the spot. Amazingly I had everything I needed in the pantry when the chocolate monster took over one evening around 9:00 pm. I made the frosting but only frosted half the pan since my husband thought he might have some too, and he doesn't even like chocolate desserts. I can't believe it, but they actually were better without the frosting. Quick and easy and very satisfying to this sweet tooth."
"1","3","these brownies were pretty good. I didn't have butter so i used margarine they came out pretty good. It was fast and easy. next time i'll try them with white chocolate chips."
"1","5","This is the first time my brownies from scratch have turned out. Thank You so much. I left off the frosting though because they were sweet enough without it."
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!!! I didn't know that food could be addictive...."
"1","5","This is the first time that I have made brownies from scratch and I could not be happier with the outcome! I love the frosting. I plan to use it for cakes and cupcakes. These are the best brownies ever!!"
"1","4","These were pretty good - made them for a get-together and they went down well."
"1","4","these brownies were awesome! i had a feeling that the frosting would be too much though, so i altered the recipe a little bit to make it more of a sauce. instead of just mixing the ingredients together, i had them over a low heat to make it smoother. i also subtracted half of the confectioners' sugar and added about a 6-8 tbsps of peach baby food. i served the brownies with a bit of icecream, the chocolate sauce and extra baby food to garnish. i got an awesome response!! thanx so much!"
"1","5","Excellent delicious brownies. Easy to make with all ingredients on hand. Probably will never buy a box of brownied mix again"
"1","4","These were indeed good, and I did make them without the frosting. However, in their unfrosted state, I didn't think they were chocolatey enough. I will probably make again, but double the chocolate."
"1","5","I made these to take to my future mother in law and her sisters and they gobbled them up and I scored MAJOR 'brownie' points!"
"1","5","Excellent brownies!! It's so hard to choose when looking at all the brownie recipes; you just have to hope that the one you choose is as good as the reviews. This was a lovely recipe and hit the spot! I was craving brownies. The only problem was my icing was very dry at first so I mixed a teaspoon of instant coffee granules with 2 teaspoons of hot water and then poured that into the icing; it worked perfectly and I got the mocha flavor I wanted!"
"1","5","Great, moist brownies. Why use a box when it is so easy from this great scratch recipe? The frosting is good and adds a special touch but when I make them again, I prob will not frost them."
"1","4","These were good, not great. I like my brownies thicker so I will double the recipe next time. Otherwise, these are perfect for when you want something sweet but your pantry is bare!"
"1","5","Really good, fudgy brownies. I will use a different frosting next time though. It was hard to spread and it was hard to differentiate the frosting from the brownie."
"1","5","I doubled this recipe to fit a larger (9x13) pan and it worked really well. I was a little concerned when I put the frosting on and it started melting, but as it turned out that was a good thing because it spreads so evenly that way. I lined my pan with foil so the brownies were easy to lift out and cut. Everyone loved these brownies!"
"1","2","Not good at all! Wayyyyyy too little flour and too much butter for the lack of flour. They came out crusty liek orea cookie crumbles. Okay tasting.... Will not make again."
"1","5","Just wonderful. I just baked this and the kids already ate it. I got one tiny piece of it to taste. It really tastes great. I am glad I baked more things for the family that is coming over tomorrow."
"1","4","These brownies definately were chocolately. I don't know if it was my oven or the time but they were very wet still in the middle - which made them even gooeier. I would make them again but increase the cooking time by 10 mins. Thanks, it fixed the chocolate crave in my house!"
"1","5","Chewy, chocolaty and delicious. Enjoyed by all. I've spinkled nuts over top for adult occassions and dinosaur sprinkles for children. A great hit everywhere we take them!"
"1","5","I've made these brownies at least 10 times, and they always disappear. I've given many batches away as gifts, and people always rave about them. I have never bothered with the icing because they are perfect as they are. Icing would be overkill. Toasted nuts and/or (white)chocolate chips are a nice addition. I've even swirled in 1/2 cup cream cheese mixed with 1/4 cup sugar and an egg. The cream cheese version needs an extra five minutes in the oven. Mmmmmm. The amazing thing about the original recipe is that the brownies taste even better the second day...that is if you can keep them in the house that long! Thanks for ending my relentless search for the perfect brownie recipe."
"1","5","By far, the BEST BROWNIE EVER......IF you prepare them properly. Beat in the eggs but don't overmix the flour mixture. Trust me on this one."
"1","1","Not for me. Very fudge-like, and you will enjoy if that's your preference. I am grateful to all submitters for sharing their recipes, and enjoyed trying something different, but I won't try again."
"1","5","First, the recipe is AMAZING. Now, let me share a few experiments. 1) I reported that the recipe could successfully be made vegan by substituting 1 banana for 2 eggs. That's WRONG. That was a different recipe. If you do this, you'll get chocolate tar, not brownies! Powdered egg replacer is a bit better, but the brownies don't rise like they should. 2) I tried adding chocolate chips to it but what happened was that they just sunk to the bottom of the pan while it was baking and didn't add much to the flavor. 3) I melt the butter in a large saucepan and then add the rest of the ingredients to the melted butter. ADD THE EGGS LAST if you do this or you'll cook the eggs before they get mixed in. 4)Butter or margarine both work just fine, but the flavor and texture is a bit different. 5) I actually multiplied the recipe by 4 and it still works, although it needs another 10 minutes or so in the oven."
"1","4","This is a cake like brownie. The other recipe from this site, Deep Dish Brownie, is fudge like. So depends on one's preference, both are actually good. Mine is for the other"
"1","5","My husband made these for dessert tonight and I would definitely agree that they are the 'best homemade brownies' I have ever had. We didn't bother with the icing since I like my brownies plain. Thanks for the recipe, will make again and again."
"1","4","The brownies were really good, I added walnuts! But what was the deal with frosting? It was hard to spread even on warm brownies! I will make the brownies again, but I will definitely replace the frosting!"
"1","5","Add walnuts to mix."
"1","2","If you like sweet brownies, you'll love these. My kids thought they were to sweet & rich. Don't think we will be making again. Sorry.:("
"1","3","Nothing special about this one. Tasted like a chocolate cake, and not the best one I ever had. Kids thought it was ok, nothing special either. Won't do it again. Sorry:("
"1","5","Wow! They really do ALWAYS turn out! My father said the taste was the best he had ever had and I always omit the icing. Nothing wrong with it, I'm sure, its just that my dad likes plain 'ol brownies. I am quite impressed."
"1","4","These were really yummy!"
"1","5","this is really the best brownie recipe I have ever tried. My kids and practically everybody in the family loves them. I brought samples in the office and I got a lot of orders for these brownies. Our pastor likes them a lot, my neighbors, friends. Until now I'm still getting plenty of orders. Absolutely great."
"1","5","These really are the easiest and best tasting brownies ever. I also left the icing off as the brownie is fantastic all by itself. These are virtually 'no mess and no time'. Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you!!!"
"1","5","Really good and chewy! I'll opt out the icing next time though coz the brownie itself is already very sweet. Very good with ice cream!"
"1","5","Because my oven is very hot, hotter than usual ovens it was hard to bake these brownies without burning them, but I estimated and when I had a piece they were excellent, especially with the frosting."
"1","5","Yummy-yum yummy!! These brownies were a big hit with my boyfriend who ate the whole pan over the weekend!! I made more for the guys at work, and the pan dissappeared again within an hour!! Definately a keeper - so easy to make!!"
"1","5","Added about 1 tbsp of milk to thin the frosting as previously recommended; worked like a charm. My son loved these and they're a total no-brainer to make. Consider adding 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans and it will be a total winner."
"1","5","These were wonderful!!! Soooo easy and with a great chocolate taste. I always have all the ingredients on hand. I don't think I will ever buy another box brownie. I did have to add a couple of tablespoons of milk to the frosting. It was a bit hard to spread without it."
"1","5","The title says it all. I usually only make box mix brownies but have always wanted a recipe from scratch. I have now found my recipe. Everyone loved it even thought I didn't use the frosting."
"1","5","I'd been looking for a brownie recipe with frosting - I'm so glad I finally found one."
"1","5","I have made these twice so far, and they've come out great both times. Only complaint is with the frosting; I had to add a bit of milk in addition to the ingredients listed in order for it to be spreadable, but aside from that it was perfect."
"1","5","These really are the best brownies! I added 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips, and left off the frosting, (just because I don't like frosting) And it was excellent!! Very yummy and easy!"
"1","5","Very good and easy to make - I didn't even make the icing and they were still very rich. I made two batches. the first one I cooked just 25 minutes and they came out 'cakey'. The second batch I cooked about 22 minutes and they were much more 'fudgey'. Either way they tasted great. Next time I will use nuts."
"1","5","These are fudgy and fantastic. I have made 6 batches in the last 3 days for my daughters school...I did find that warming up the frosting made it shiney, smooth, easier to spread, and much fudgier..(is that a word)...they are really the best choc. brownie I have tasted!!!!signed:chocoholic!!"
"1","5","Very Good Brownie! I prefer these without the frosting, it makes them too sweet. These are nice and fudgy!!!"
"1","5","These were so easy and tasted great, I will definately be baking more of them!!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe, quick, easy and very tasty. I found the Brownies were better after they sat for a few hours. I added chopped pecans to mine and used a little cream in the frosting. It is best to frost when hot."
"1","2","I prefer the 'cake-like' brownies, and this recipe did not produce what I was hoping for. The flavour was good, though, but a bit too sweet for my liking."
"1","5","WONDERFUL!!! EASY!!! I will NEVER buy a box mix of brownies again, this recipe was easy and I had everything I needed in my kitchen"
"1","5","really good"
"1","5","My daughter is 11 and she wanted to cook something. We pulled this recipe and she made them by herself with me watching on. They were great and were very easy to make."
"1","5","I thought these brownies were great, especially a day or 2 after baking. I can't complain, because it was so easy. I served them at a party and they received rave reviews."
"1","5","These are fabulous. I took them to my parents house and they were eaten within a few minutes."
"1","5","These are the best brownies i have ever tasted! you might have to mix the icing mixture on the top of some hot water in the sink to get a better consistancy. but overall....they are the best!"
"1","5","These were so good. They really ARE much, much better the next day (they taste a little bitter on the first day, but it goes away after that). I mixed in about a cup of peanut butter with the frosting for a little kick.. YUMMY! Thanks for sharing this one."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. I am an avid baker and know my way around the kitchen, so I've been told. These brownies were terrrrrrrrrrrific. I will never look for another recipe. Angie, thanks for sharing this one, you should have kept it a secret and made alot of money with it later on like Mrs Fields did."
"1","5","This Best Brownies receipe is definately the best. I've never had much luck for baking anything, much less brownies, and with a new baby in the household I certainly don't have time for any complicated receipes. My husband was very impressed with the moistness of the brownies and I was impressed on how easy these were to make. Believe me when I tell you that if I can do this, anyone can!"
"1","5","I am a brownie-monster. I have spent 2 years baking and testing many brownie recipes and I think I will stop it now 'cause I found the really best brownies---thanks to angie for sharing your great recipe. I just baked them this morning and it turned out to be a big hit. These brownies are very yummy with or without the frosting."
"1","5","These are the most wonderful brownies I have ever tasted!!!! I made them this evening and shared them with a friend and the pan is now empty.....Thanks Angie!! You are great for sharing this recipe. Never mind that I'll probably wind up as a fat lady in a side show!!"
"1","4","The brownies were very good, but the icing was kind of bitter!! very good without the icing!!"
"1","5","My family loved it so much, that I had to make another one the next day!"
"1","5","This recipe is by far the best brownie recipe ive tried. Its simple and easy, and the brownies are delicious. Add a little milk to the frosting to make it creamier."
"1","5","My husband and son each took one bite of these brownies and asked me to add the recipe to my permanent file! I'm not even a brownie fan, and I liked them as well."
"1","5","These are the best brownies I have ever made. Almost a fudge like consistency, dense and moist and very chocolaty! My boyfriend loves them and would eat the whole batch if I let him! Yummy served warm out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream."
"1","5","These are very good. Add some milk to the frosting so it is creamier and spreads better."
"1","5","great recipe for homemade brownies!! I was running short on time so I used store-bought frosting and they still tasted great!! Thank you"
"1","5","Good,rich brownie. There are those that don't like the frosting. Personally, I loved it!"
"1","5","These brownies were very good. They were really moist and chewy when it had cooled a little bit. But the next day they became a little on the cakey side. Still very good though. Everyone at work loved them!"
"1","5","I made these brownies the other day, and they are GREAT. I recommend them for quick easy snack!!"
"1","5","Yum! I made these for my family and half the pan was gone in an hour. They are delicious, moist but not gooey."
"1","5","This 'Best Brownies' is really the best brownie I've ever tasted! I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. It's so so so great."
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I usually don't care much for brownies from scatch but this one is a winner. Bye bye box mixes!"
"1","4","I really liked this recipe, but I think next time I will omit the honey from the frosting."
"1","5","These are absolutely wonderful. I can't believe I made brownies from  scratch and they turned out this good!  Thank you very much."
"1","5","Yum!! These brownies rock! I doubled the recipe and still could have eaten tne entire batch by myself! (Hey, and this is coming from a pastry chef - would I steer you wrong?) I added a little sour cream & milk to the frosting to soften it up a bit. Truly yummy!"
"1","5","Yum Yum!! Fudgey fantasy!!"
"1","5","Beware, if trying to diet. These are hard to resist. Very chocolatey, good, relatively easy to make using ingredients usually on hand from the pantry! It is a winner!"
"1","5","I have never liked any homemade brownie recipe until I tried this one. They are so moist and rich. They are a great do ahead recipe since they taste delicious the next day."
"1","5","These brownies are indeed the 'best brownies!' They come out very soft and are quite rich tasting. I also loved them because it uses just the very basic ingredients you have in your pantry!"
"1","4","These brownies are wonderful! Everyone loved them - I should have made another batch. Going, going, gone!"
"1","5","My children loved them!"
"1","5","A chocolate lovers dream!"
"1","5","Great brownies! I have had a hard time finding a good recipe for brownies that wasn't to sticky and gooey, this one is perfect! My kids and husband loved them, I made a batch this afternoon and they are already gone!  Thanks!"
"0","5","Unbelievable! These are among the best I have ever has. My wife, who is pregnant and demanded I make brownies at 9:45 at night, ate three of them in one sitting."
"0","5","I love making this recipe for brownies its quick and easy, if you add just a few chocolate chips in the batter there is no need to make the frosting because they come out nice delicious!!!!"
"0","2","I followed the recipe other than not making the glaze. I baked them for 18 minutes. They're very cake-like in texture and a bit dry. I was hoping for a brownie with a chewy texture like the box mixes."
"0","4","I just made these and ate them. They were very good, but I have two comments. I baked mine for exactly 25 minutes, but the edges were dry. I would cook about 22 minutes instead.   The icing mixed as called for is extremely dry. I added a bit of milk to mine. I iced the brownies nearly right out of he oven and the icing melted. It was good, but maybe the recepie says to ice them warm so it will melt. I could haves added a bit less milk than I did."
"0","2","Taste bland and are too cakelike."
"0","5","Super chocolatey and moist. I used gluten-free flour and dropped a handful of chocolate chips in the batter for added flavor. Topped them with a chocolate ganache drizzle. Delicious!"
"0","5","Awwwww..... Am loving these brownies :)"
"0","3","Will not make again. Too fudgey. Kid did not like. I messed up a little while measuring the 1/2 cup flour, and maybe used a tbsp less. That should not have made a big difference. Taste was good, but cut down on sugar if I make again. Definitely does not need choc chips added to it."
"0","5","Amazing and so easy!"
"0","5","Everyone in the family loves this one! I always make 2 batches ... with & without walnuts. They still want me to make both varieties, but in 13x9 pans!!"
"0","5","Excellent!! It was easy to make and increase. I doubled the recipe, except for the eggs, I only added 2. Next I used one cup of whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup of yogurt butter, 1 and 1/4 cup of light brown sugar, and 1/2 of a baking unsweetened chocolate bar. I mixed with a spoon, no beater and it could not be easier. The chocolate I melted in a double boiler being very careful not to get a drop of water in the chocolate. I baked it in the center of the oven. I got 16 moist pieces out of it for a meeting and it was a very big hit!!! Everyone wanted the recipe, especially when I told them about the alterations I made to it. Thanks!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe to put in a 9'x13' pan. Doubled the ingredients but kept eggs amount to just 2. Baked for 28 minutes. When making the glaze, I was out of honey so I used a Tbsp. of corn syrup instead. Oh and I did NOT double the glaze ingredients. It made the perfect amount to spread for the large pan. These were delicious and had a fudgey texture. This is a keeper for me!"
"0","4","I have Tried 4th receip, and this is the best one! The topping is not yet like the one of the boxes; this one is too sweet...it's more like a mousse, while the one in the boxes is more a chocolate sauce.  Thank you from italy!!!"
"0","5","My family loved them! The brownies are very easy to make and they came out perfect. One recommendation - if you you're not a big fan of vanilla, use a little less in your frosting. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"0","1","I did NOT like this recipe. It was very watery and moist. It did taste fine but i don't want salmonella from it being undercooked. It took me half an hour to prepare and 1HR!!! to bake. my advice, don't use this recipe, use a different one."
"0","5","I made this recipe EXACTLY as written. I was nervous because of the negative comments. And when I first took a bite, I thought it was overly sweet and didn't have a great texture. But... They cooled completely and they smelled sooo good, I just couldn't resist them. I tried them again and they were unbelievably delicious!!! I'm talking, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Seriously. They were chewy and tender and the frosting added something special. I doubled the recipe (fit a 9x13 pan perfectly) & it was gone that night. Give these a chance. :)  The only thing I will do differently is use about a half cup less sugar for the frosting. But that's just because I like my frosting less sweet than most."
"0","5","efore I review a word to other 'reviewers': don't say, ' I made these brownies ' and proceed to go on and on about how you 'fixed' the recipes by adding this or that and subtracting this or that... You obviously did NOT make THESE brownies... If yours do not turn out like the picture ask YOURSELF what you did wrong... Now for my review: these were SOFT and delicious and chewy and exactly like the picture shown, I did not make the frosting, I figured it was chocolaty enough so this is STRICTLY about the brownie, and it was delectable!!! Pics to follow!!!"
"0","5","Simply Delicious! I added 1/2 tsp almond & coconut extracts along w/a tsp of vanilla."
"0","5","These were delicious! I didn't make the frosting with it but I did put in another 1/2 cup of butter, a couple more pinches of salt and some brown sugar. You Have to try these!"
"0","3","Way too much sugar. Eating these is a good way to get diabetes and a toothache. Other than that they're good, next time I make them I'm using half as much sugar."
"0","5","I used coconut oil in place of butter. I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. And added chocolate chips in the batter and hazelnuts on the top. Yumm"
"0","5","We loved them! Never will buy box brownies again. Thank you for this recipe."
"0","5","I will make it again, i loved this SOOOO much...   They are delicious although this was my first time making them... they were a bit messy.. but i think the more you make them the better they will turn out! But still these you MUST try."
"0","5","This recipe is so simple and quick. The second time I made them, I added in coconut flakes! Delicious!"
"0","5","I loooove this recipe, so does all of my family and friends! Although there's no special ingredient, I absolutely recommend this to someone who wants a simple, yet spectacular brownie recipe!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe! Simple and delicious. I followed the recipe and added a handful of chopped dark chocolate. Came out perfect ??."
"0","5","These are truly the best brownies! I've made them several times and always a hit. I, too, double the recipe for a big pan. I also add just a touch of coffee to the frosting recipe."
"0","5","made mine as cupcakes with no frosting. crispy on top and slightly fluffier than most brownies. The family loved them. No more brownie mixes in this house."
"0","5","my boyfriends favorite brownie recipe"
"0","5","These brownies are superb!   I needed to add a teaspoon of milk to make the frosting spreadable. I did use softened butter; but when I do it again, I'll make sure the butter is really soft."
"0","5","perfect!"
"0","5","I have made a lot of brownies but these were by far the best! They are fudgey and full of flavor.I seen a lot of negative reviews which was surprising. They must have over baked them. I used an 8x8 glass pan and they cooked about 22 minutes and came out perfect. The icing was a little sweet. I had to add about a 1/4 of milk and it helped make it creamy. I will reduce the sugar amount next time."
"0","5","Great fast brownies! The frosting recipe is gross. They don't really need any though. If you like more of a cake texture add a bit more flour. If fudge is your bag. Melt a handful of chocolate chips in the butter."
"0","5","everybody loved them! I doubled the recipe bc my square pan disappeared. The kiddos also wanted to decorate the brownies with mini m&m's instead of doing the frosting but that was the only modifications we did. They were moist and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","Welp, the first time i tried these brownies the texture was awful. Somehow hard but not cakey. Just odd. My fault since i misread the directions ands added too much butter. The taste of the end results was okay though.  The next day I tried it again since it's a rather simple recipe and I had plenty of the ingrediants left over. I added a little more cocoa then suggested, nearly doubled the vanilla and added nearly a table spoon of cinnamon. I added slightly less flour then suggested as well because I was scared it would dull the chocolate taste and i really wanted a knock out chocolate taste.  This batch was much better. When I first took them out of the oven and tried them, they were good. Typical home made brownie, nothing special. But once the brownies got to room temperature and stiffened...OMG! It was like biting into a smooth slightely softened chocolate bar. The texture was what put this brownie over the edge!   Next time I make this recipe i will double it to make one pan, the one complaint I have is these brownies are rather thin. These went fast in my home! Even my son devoured them and he's not a huge cake fan, especially chocolate cakes or brownies. But he cleared half the batch all by himself.  This brownie would be amazing with crushed walnuts, carmel or peanut butter swirls on the top, or mint chips! Can't wait to make and try all of those. I will also put less cinnamon but i still will add some. Also slightly less vanilla but slightly more then the recipe sug"
"0","3","Not my favorite type of brownie. Very thin. The frosting was strange. It was more like play-doh than frosting. It was not easy to put on the warm brownies. I used store brand cocoa powder so I don't know if that had anything to do with it. We still ate the whole plate of brownies, but I won't be making these again."
"0","5","My kids loved these and have requested them many times since."
"0","5","Absolutely amazing!!! i did have to add more butter to the frosting and melt it to make it spreadable. But other than that was a party in my mouth"
"0","5","Delicious! My advice would be to watch them cook closely b/c my oven cooked them way quicker than the recipe stated. Also, melt butter for the icing and cut down on the amt of sugar. Otherwise, it's a bit thick."
"0","3","They are very cake like and a bit dry and I only cooked them for 20 minutes. Brooke's best bombshell brownies are WAAAAAYYYY better, but thought I'd try a recipe with a little less sugar. I won't be making these again."
"0","2","Way too moist! You wouldn't think that's a bad thing but it is. They're not very brownie like at all. The frosting was pretty good though."
"0","5","Moist and chocolaty these were very good. A success at the gathering I brought them to"
"0","5","These are the BEST BROWNIES ever!! I double this recipe and make a 9x13 pan. They taste great with or with out the frosting! There so quick and easy I make them all the time!"
"0","5","These turned out moist, rich and soft -- delicious! Followed the advice of some reviewers: 1) heat butter on stove on low heat till melted. 2) combine by hand in gentle strokes eggs, sugar, vanilla in a large bowl and add melted butter 3) combine in a medium bowl cocoa, flour, salt, baking powder 4) stir flour mix gently into butter mix by hand until just combined and don't overmix 5) I folded in chopped pecans  Took 25 mins to cook till toothpick nearly clean when inserted in middle. Let it cool for 30 mins. I omitted the frosting.   This was so easy and fast to make! Will add it to my collection!"
"0","5","Excellent brownies. I doubled the batch using 3 eggs, 1/4 t. salt & baking for 31 minutes (per bakedbyjen instructions)....perfect...good and fudgy. Easy, ingredients always on hand & delicious."
"0","3","The brownies are easily 5! The texture is perfect and chewy along with THE PERFECT FLAVOR!! They are by far the best I have EVER had. Simply amazing. But the frosting is awful. The flavor is just not good at all.  When it comes down to it, these are the best brownies you will ever have. Just skip the frosting recipe."
"0","5","Amazing! We have made this probably 7 times and I am finally getting around to posting a review... My 8 year old can make this with very little help- we have made it both with the frosting and without and both are delicious- VERY RICH chocolate flavor- a small piece will go a long way- as stated- do not overbake- goes great with a cold glass of milk!! No changes to ingredients but I highly recommend heating the frosting over low flame on the stove- I melted the butter first and then added all ingredients and still heated it over a low flame- it spreads so much easier!! Thanks for an easy and amazingly rich homemade brownie recipe!!"
"0","5","I made these brownies and my family RAVED about them. They have never done that for my brownies EVER before."
"0","5","these brownies were sop good!"
"0","5","I´m not good at cooking, but these brownies where amazing!!! the best brownies i´ve ever cook."
"0","5","Excellent result..instead of the choc frosting I covered the brownies with dark chocolate. Will definitely do them again."
"0","5","Look delicious"
"0","5","My 10-year old son wanted to learn how to make brownies. He tried this recipe and it turned out awesome."
"0","5","Fabulous! They turned out perfect, in every way... they taste devine.. moist and cake like, and very rich, but in the way brownies are supposed to be. I imagine they'd be good without the frosting as well, but I very much liked the frosting. I didn't have honey so i used agave nectar for the frosting and I love it."
"0","5","I loved this recipe. I added a couple things to make it my own. One tablespoon of cold coffee and 'cheesecake swirls' - cream cheese, egg, sugar, vanilla. They got gobbled up!"
"0","5","I absolutely loved these brownies! I made these for my husband exactly as instructed. He is SUPER particular about his brownies and these were perfect! I doubled the recipe and I think because I had two pans of brownie in the oven, it required longer bake time.. They were in the oven about an hour. Then again, I believe something's up with my oven. HAHA! Seriously recommend this recipe though- as is!"
"0","4","love the texture. They look great. Do take out of oven at 21 mins and even though they do not look done, they are. Wait a minute and they become perfect."
"0","5","I read several reviews, both positive and negative so I was cautiously optimistic. I followed the recipe, lightly mixing after each ingredient so not to over mix. I began checking after 15 minutes. Based on my oven it did take 18 minutes. I let cool for only 5 minutes then spread the icing and let finished cooling. These are FANTASTIC- almost like fudge! I will NEVER buy boxed brownies again. These are too easy and too delicious and uses only ingredients I can pronounce. For those with negative reviews, I'm not sure why these arent your favorite."
"0","5","These were incredible good! Won't buy the boxed stuff anymore. Even the expensive mix pales in comparison. I had a little problem with the cooking time, but that may have been the pan I used. It was gooey in the center, not cooked. I baked for 30 minutes. Next time I will use a square pan of the listed size."
"0","5","These brownies are phenomenal! They melt in your mouth and they are so soft and moist!! I didn't add/change a thing (I didn't make the icing though, I believe their delicious without it, and sweet enough.) Everyone loves them and they're always gone within two days! I highly recommend this recipe!   (If you want to make a sundae out of them just put a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top of the brownie, and drizzle some homemade hot fudge on top and you've got it made!)"
"0","5","Delicious, dense, moist and fudgy just like a brownie should be. I added a little extra cocoa powder and about an ounce of strong coffee as it really enhances the chocolate flavor.   And as been mentioned before by so many others, do not overbeat or overbake. Both are death for brownies. Mix with a fork only, take them out a minute or two before you think you should and they'll turn out great."
"0","4","Absolutely delicious taste. I listened to previous reviews and was sure not to over-mix the batter. The resulting brownies tasted fantastic and were a little cakey on the edges. I'm a fan of the thickest, richest brownies possible so I might reduce the baking powder next time and add chocolate chips. However, if you are a fan of brownies that are just a little cakey, then this recipe is perfect."
"0","5","I love how simple these were to make, I didn't make the frosting & they were delicious, I ate the entire dish to myself in 1 night. What a nice pick me up."
"0","5","I make these all the time! I add chocolate chips to the batter, and instead of making the frosting, I put 1 and a half cups of chocolate chips on the brownies as soon as they come out of the oven so they melt, then spread it all over the top. When cooled, it's a thick chocolate 'crust' and everyone LOVES them! HUGE hit at bake sales!"
"0","4","This is my go to brownie recipe when we want something chocolate and quick! I 've never made the frosting, but the brownie part is super easy. The kids make this by theirself all the time. We almost always double the recipe, but the good thing is you can make it even when running low on ingredients. And, I love brownie batter, so there's that! As a matter of fact, I kinda like this better as just batter!"
"0","5","Best ever!,,,"
"0","5","This was the first time I ever made brownies, and they are the best one I have ever had. I mixed all the ingredients with a wooden spoon, in the saucepan that I melted the butter in. I also had to heat the frosting in the microwave for 20 seconds, and it came out creamy and delicious."
"0","5","Awesome !! Made exact recipe , except I leave the frosting off, and every time I make them every one loves them and asks for recipe!!"
"0","5","EASY! Delicious! Didn't make the frosting, they didn't need it anyway!!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 11x13 glass pan. These were a huge hit."
"0","5","These are great! Had to add a bit of water to the frosting to get the right texture, but mmmmmm..."
"0","5","This recipe is definitely a hit! The only problem is the frosting. For me it did not come together but I added a little (1 tablespoon) milk and then it came together as a smooth and yummy frosting! I love this recipe! I rate it 20 star!"
"0","5","Amazing!"
"0","5","These were excellent! Extremely moist (which, in my opinion, is key for a perfect brownie) and delicious. This basic, simple recipe is a necessity and I can't wait to add little kicks (peanuts, chocolate chips, etc.) as I continue to make these!"
"0","5","this recipe is delicious i made them yesterday to try and they were totally a hit this is my first time making homemade brownies and the frosting just tied it all together at first I didn't think the frosting would taste good with the brownies but I was soooo wrong these brownies are amazing!!!!!!! Tip: just remember to sprat the pan."
"0","5","I made these with white whole wheat flour, they were the best brownies I've made so far."
"0","5","I just wanted a Brownie. Not a piece of cake or some other I don't know what the hell, but an honest to goodness homemade from scratch brownie. Well I got it, thank you very much! Glass of milk in my hand eating the last one in the pan we made 3 hours ago."
"0","4","They were good! I made a double recipe and used 3/4 c. of sugar instead of 2 c. Plus, I beat my eggs a bit before I put them in the butter mixture. And also I changed the icing a bit, I used half of the powdered sugar, andmelted the butter, it was still kinda like cookie dough, so I put about 1tbsp of heavy whipping cream in. They turned out good, but. I think I beat them to much, they were kinda cakey...."
"0","5","This recipe is the best. I make them all the time and they are not enough for my 4 kids. Today I am going to make them with whole wheat flour and see how they come out...... Will let you all know how they came out.i"
"0","5","No changes needed. This brownie is excellent as is!"
"0","5","I doubled everything in this recipe and for the frosting I added eggs . This was my first time making brownies and my parents and family loved it"
"0","5","Best homemade brownies I have ever made! Only change I made was I doubled the recipe. It turned out perfectly. My kid's loved it and it was gone quickly. Can't wait to make them again!"
"0","2","Nothing special."
"0","5","This is really good, moist. I have made this gluten free by using almond flour, or GF flour mix. I have also used 1/4 nutbutter with 1/4c butter. I have at times used protein flour instead of flour. Other times I have used Splenda for half or all of the sugar. For those of you that have had problems with them coming out too hard or cake like, perhaps fluffing the flour with a wisk before scooping into a measuring cup and leveling it. Also check the temp of your oven as it could be off. try lowering the temp and not cooking as long. I have used this basic recipe for awhile, and even with subs not have a problem. I am able to adjust it to the dietary needs of many friends and family."
"0","5","My husband make this one day and it was so good we have made this for a few of our friends and they really love it!"
"0","5","These brownies are so moist and delicious not to mention easy to make. I double the recipe and baked in a metal air bake 9x13 pan for 30 minutes and also double frosting recipe. I have now made these numerous times and added Walnuts. YUM!"
"0","1","I doubled the recipe, followed instructions, brownies turned out under cooked... Very running. Frosted anyway, still never set up and tried to bake a few minutes more... Still very soft and mooshie. WILL not make these again!"
"0","5","This will satisfy anyones chocolate craving! I even held back one tablespoon of the cocoa powder in the icing. I did not use the mixer and hand stirred everything which did make the brownies chewy rather than cake like as mentioned in some other reviews. I also had to add some almond milk to the icing so it wouldn't clump up. I added about 1-2 tablespoons of the almond milk. Delicious!!!!"
"0","5","The best brownies ."
"0","4","I loved the brownies. Recipe wa easy and convenient. I only used one egg. My husband likes them a little more done than I do so I ate the whole pan!! Icing was excellent."
"0","5","I don't get the one star review at all. I followed the recipe and baked them for 25 minutes and they are not 'cake' brownies like 'one star' said. They are decadent, soft, fudgy squares of awesomeness! And I didn't even frost them! I'm going to make them again and add some chopped pecans. So glad I tried this recipe - they are TRULY the BEST brownies!!"
"0","5","Pretty darn good. Prob more like 4 1/2 stars, but definitely much better than other brownie recipes I've tried. It was a little strange to me to see a baking recipe that didn't tell you to mix the liquids separate from the powders, so I did them separately just in case. This unfortunately does add time to the process and one extra bowl to clean up, but this was for my bf's birthday so I didn't want to mess up. It might be fine without doing that step, I may try next time. I doubled the recipe like others and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. This doesn't make a ridiculous amount of brownies, just about 24. I also used one less egg and instead about 1/3 cup applesauce. The brownie was a great combo of fudgy with just a little bit of moist crumbly cakeyness. Very delicious. The frosting was awfully thick but worked fine.I will try the tip next time for the frosting of melting the butter and using less powdered sugar.Mine were kinda falling apart and didn't look as pretty as other brownies, but boy were they moist and flavorful. All in all they were super scrumptious, my boyfriend said I should sell them!"
"0","4","Yes they are awesome!!!!"
"0","4","Never made a brownie in my life. These seemed to work out just fine. A little on the dry side but it might be something I did."
"0","5","Seriously the best brownies I have ever had! My husband agrees too. We didn't try the frosting in the recipe but they didn't need it."
"0","5","YUM!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had! I followed the frosting advice of others and melted the butter and halved the amount of icing sugar. It turned out so good, next time I'll be making a double batch because a single just isn't enough!"
"0","5","Hands down BEST brownie recipe I've done!! My family loved it!! I added sprinkles after frosting."
"0","5","These are the best homemade brownies I've ever made. They are great with the frosting ( I added a little water to make it come together to form a frosting) and a little redi-whip on the side . So good! It's hard to resist eating the whole thing!"
"0","1","These brownies never turn out! I've tried 3 times to make them and every time they are hard as stones. I don't see how this recipe has so many positive reviews unless the bakers are absolute kitchen magicians."
"0","5","These are the best! I do add about a tablespoon of milk to the original frosting though. If you don't it's just powder."
"0","5","I have made these several times for my family and they are always amazing and delicuous!! My family loves them!"
"0","5","Amazing brownies! They turned out really good! I love them! :)"
"0","5","Simple. Frosting seemed a little different..."
"0","5","These brownies were awesome! I followed the recipe as is but substituted with a gluten free flour mix. I added a scoop of ice cream - No frosting needed, easy and delicious."
"0","5","I hadn't made brownies from scratch before these, and these tasted SO good! Maybe boxed mixes will be less in my future :)"
"0","4","These are delicious! They are not the dense, chewy brownies though, if that's what you're looking for. The texture is in between brownies and cake. It does get the perfect thin 'crust' on top though! I have made these multiple times and my family loves them!  I haven't even bothered with the icing...they are great on their own."
"0","5","Easy to make and tastes delicious. Exactly the chewy texture I look for in a brownie."
"0","5","Amazing! I made them gluten-free by subbing 1/2 c gf all purpose and 1/2 c brown rice flour...I doubled the recipe."
"0","5","These are worth the extra time!"
"0","4","Great brownie recipe! I didn't make the frosting (just not used to having frosted brownies) but the people I served them to were big fans!"
"0","5","These brownies are delicious, even gluten free! I've made them many times, always using gluten-free flour. I've never made the frosting because they are super tasty without it, and I can't wait that long to eat them. Lately I've been stirring in a heaping spoonful of almond butter or peanut butter to the melted butter. So, so good. I'll never buy a mix or pre-made brownies again."
"0","4","These were tasty, but they are extremely similar to another recipe on this site. The only diff is that this one's amounts are halved and it uses coco powder instead of baker's chocolate. So, I added melted chocolate chips to the egg, butter sugar mixture and toasted in the coco powder. Delicious!"
"0","1","It turns out dry and more like a cake. Not brownie tasting at all. Very disappointing..."
"0","5","my daughter wasn't feeling well and brownies are one of her faves..so i dubbed these 'feel-better brownies'..she felt a bit better after having them (might have been the ibuprofen-not added to brownies lol) anyway..I followed the former Duncan Hines worker and beat my eggs before mixing..followed everyone else's suggestion and just mixed everything by hand..fork for the eggs..spatula for the rest..doubled recipe except used 3 eggs instead of 4..another awesome suggestion made in the reviews..now I would like to eat the whole tray myself..alas..my family history is chock a block full of diabetes..so I will refrain...I was short on confectioners sugar and therefore couldn't make the icing...so before I put the tray of goodness in the oven, I sprinkled half with chocolate chips and toffee bits..OMG...added just the right amount of yum...I will still eat the other half (of course) but next time the whole thing will be topped with it..i baked them for 28 mins..any longer and mine would have burned..These are nothing like any fudge I've ever had..I'm not sure how that happened to others...maybe over mixing?? Just double the recipe, who doesn't need more brownies in their life??"
"0","5","This is the first from-scratch brownie recipe that I've made which my husband actually liked better than the from-a-box brownies. Amazing! Very fudgy, don't overbake."
"0","5","Amazing"
"0","5","Wonderful! I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup. I didn't miss that small amount at all.   Also, don't forget to temper your eggs! My daughter was helping me make these and dumped the eggs into the warm pot, which was still hot enough to cook them. I was able to salvage the brownies, but had some scrambled eggs with them."
"0","5","Wow! I can't believe we had the ingredients in our little house for this great recipe. It's divine."
"0","5","This is my favorite brownie recipe! Try these you definitely won't be disappointed. :)"
"0","4","Brownies were flawless. I usually make the recipe icing-free, but decided to try the icing. Ended up being more like dust than icing, so I added milk and whipped it up with a hand mixer. Turned out great."
"0","5","this was a great recipe! i like to stick the butter in the microwave for 15 seconds it helps alot"
"0","5","these are the best!!! i never made homemade brownies before and these came out perfect! they're fudgy and... PEGGY728"
"0","5","I've made these three times now, and they're always a big hit! I suggest doubling the recipe, they go fast."
"0","5","Our new favorite brownie! Absolutely delicious and it doesn't seem to dry out as fast as my old recipe and the corners are nice and chewy."
"0","4","Tasted great! I gave it four stars instead of 5 because this recipe does not make 16 servings; I got 9 average-sized brownies. I should have doubled the recipe like others did. Other than that it was fine."
"0","5","OMG these brownies are amazing! Hands down the best brownies I have ever had. Super easy to make, and since I just made them, I wish I could eat the whole pan. Perfect consistency, perfect mouthfeel, perfect texture, and of course perfect taste. I did have to add a drop (maybe a 1/2 TBSP) of milk to the frosting to help it mix more, but other than that, don't change a thing. If you made these and they came out undesirable, you did something wrong. THESE ARE PERFECT!"
"0","5","Really good."
"0","3","Tried it without the icing and it was just okay. It definitely needs the icing. The icing brings it to a whole new level of amazingness!!!"
"0","2","These were ok. As other reviewers have said they were more like cake than brownies. My children liked them but I thought they left a bitter aftertaste."
"0","4","Used a heavy hand with the cocoa, skipped the frosting, used a circular pan and turned out great. Would make again!"
"0","5","These brownies were the talk of my office for days afterward! The only thing I noticed is that it didn't make very many brownies (8-12 at the most) not the 16 stated in the recipe. I will triple the recipe next time and make it in a larger 9 X 13 pan."
"0","5","A perfect go-to brownie recipe! I prefer to use one egg for a chewier product vs a cake-like one. Tweak it any way you wish. Its a keeper! THANK YOU !!!"
"0","4","The recipe was very delicious! I changed the recipe so the cocoa was 1/3 c. because I saw many said that. I would next time change the recipe to 1/3 c. butter instead of 1/2 c. because it tasted a bit buttery when I ate it and my siblings made sure to tell me that."
"0","5","These are probably hands down the best brownies I've ever had! If you love a moist, gooey, but not too gooey, brownie, you'll love these! Not cakey at all! I love ghirardelli double chocolate brownies (only kind I've ever liked) and find I like these way better! They also stay moist and keep for days unlike packages brownie. My husband and I give them 5 stars!"
"0","4","I have always used a box mix for brownies. I think I will use this recipe from now on instead. The only reason I gave it a 4 is that it is a little too sweet for my taste. My husband would give it a 5. It is just as easy to make as a mix also. I did not frost them as we don't usually have frosting on our brownies."
"0","5","I just made these today and are great with out the frosting"
"0","5","I've made this recipe twice!! First time making brownies and the second time tasting them. Didn't have honey on hand still tasted great. I added some heavy cream to frosting (to prevent cloud burst and got ppwders wet first) and used reg sugar for mmmm so delish!"
"0","5","Just made these brownies to satisfy a craving for something sweet. I had all the ingredients, they were super fast and easy with very little mess, and turned out perfect. Kind of in between cakey and fudgy. I made them exactly as written, except I didn't make the icing because I don't like icing much."
"0","5","This is delicious...."
"0","5","These are way too addicting!!!"
"0","5","I've made these about 3 times in 3 days. They are so delicious and super simple to make. I tried it in the waffle iron but that turned into a mess so we are the crumbled pieces in ice cream, still very good. I make mine into brownie bites and I don't make the icing because they're good as is without it. Highly recommend this recipe."
"0","5","These brownies are soooooo tastie, and now part of my special recipe box"
"0","4","'My name's Bob and I'm a chocoholic.'  This is a very good brownie recipe! My only tweak was to add a little raw coffee because the cocoa here is so bitter. We own a small western style cafe on the coast in Vietnam. The Vietnamese don't understand real good chocolate or sweets -- we make them for us and any foreigners passing through.  My wife followed the recipe and made 'bricks' the first time...good tasty bricks though. I made the correction in time and temp. (we have a small oven) so the second batch came out just great. She also became mixed-up somehow and was adding more mix after they came out of the oven. That's not a problem but I had her change that too.  Simple and quick, very easy and moist,the bomb."
"0","5","Loved the brownies. I added the frosting with a bit of a twist. Put the frosting mix in microwave for 20 seconds, let sit for a minute then spread on brownies. Almost tastes like hot fudge topping."
"0","5","My family loved these brownies! They weren't too sweet and kept that moist, fudgy texture and flavor for a few days. I will make these again and again. Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is amazing! I make it all the time for my mom and myself and they are gone so fast. I don`t make the frosting, but they are still delicious. They taste best with dark unsweetened cocoa powder. This is the best! Thank you Ms. Angie! :)"
"0","5","I love these!! They always turn out and everyone loves them. My friend asks me for some everyday because she loved them!"
"0","4","The brownies were delicous, only thing is that the brownies ended up tilting while cooking in the oven, resulting in a thick layer on one end, and a very thin layer on the other end. For the frosting, I noticed that it was very diffcult to spread if you follow the recipe, and has a odd flavor. I recommend making the frosting in a pot on the stove, it will be very easy to spread but not watery if you do that. As for the flavor, substiute the honey for the same amount of sugar and it is perfect!"
"0","3","Easy and quick, but not as good as the bombshell brownies."
"0","4","I doubled the flour in the batter. 1/2 cup just didn't seem sufficient. Husband loved them. I had frosting issues. Tastes fine but wasn't spreadable, even over piping hot brownies. AND although I did not double the batter recipe, I had to double the frosting recipe. Maybe frosting needs a little milk? Idk. I'll likely make again with tweaks to the frosting or a different frosting all together."
"0","5","I made them without the frosting and used whole wheat flour. They were really good."
"0","4","These brownies are great! I see one problem though; the frosting. You will probably need to half the amount of confectioners sugar and melt the butter for a better glaze, but the original works great as a fudgy topping."
"0","4","Best brownies I have had in a while. Added 1 tsp of espresso to a tbsp of water. 4 stars because I had to add some milk to the frosting as it was not a good consistency to do anything with."
"0","5","These are so easy and so good! I never make the frosting, so I can't comment on that. It is such an easy recipe that I know it by heart."
"0","5","These were the best brownies I have ever had!!! Wow anybody who thinks otherwise than you did not do it right. But the icing got a little too thick so I just added some water and I turned out great"
"0","5","I made the recipe exactly how it stated and it turned out yummy! I agree that they are not too thick or too thin. I normally like my brownies thicker so I was doubtful I would like them, but they are perfect. Also, not too sweet as some recipes are. I do think some nuts would be yummy and I don't think they need the frosting. Homemade caramel poured over the top with some chopped nuts and a small spoonful of creme fraiche makes for the perfect dessert!"
"0","5","Made as described, except I had a problem with the frosting that caused me to change the frosting part of the recipe. I ended up having to melt the butter and add a little extra honey to make the frosting moist enough to spread. I'm pleased with this recipe. It produces brownies that are moist, but neither fully cake-like nor fully fudge-like, so I think it'll be a hit with both sides in the ongoing brownie war in my family. Thanks for a great recipe. Next time I'll try doubling it and using a 9x13 pan because these brownies go fast!"
"0","5","Excellent !!"
"0","5","These tasted like warm delights! The frosting was amazing and easy also."
"0","5","I made these exactly as written, doubling the mix for a 13x9 pan... I did not make the frosting...they are easy, quick and absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","I made this for my business, I adjusted recipe for 64 servings. Nice, fat and chewy brownies. I will make these again. I subbed oil for butter and I used Belgium cocoa, I use that cocoa for making ice cream and gelato. Big hit with my customers. Thanks!"
"0","5","AMAZING brownies! Very fudgy, very chocolaty. Sweet, but not too sweet. My Dad's friend said that they were the best brownies he had ever had. Great brownies!"
"0","5","This recipe was a hit with the family! I followed the brownie recipe exactly but for the frosting I had to change it up because I didn't have confectioners sugar. Instead I used regular granulated sugar, I forget exactly how much maybe a cup (?), added it to melted butter then added a little bit of milk, added only 2 tbsp of cocoa and let it boil for two minutes exactly. I then took it off of the burner, added vanilla, let it cool for 5-10 min then it was a hot fudge sauce. I slowly poured it onto the warm pan of brownies and let it cool a bit for 5 minutes before serving. It was perfect!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies I've ever had!! My 12 year old made them today and followed the recipe exactly with the addition of a tablespoon of instant espresso granules. We ate them warm and didn't need the frosting. So delicious!!"
"0","3","Although, I adapted the recipe to make just four brownies and i didnt do the frosting, i didnt find them very tasty, they kind of lacked flavor. Will do them with more butter next time."
"0","5","Very easy to make, and it came out perfect. thanks"
"0","5","I made this recipe for a family get together and everyone who ate them went crazy for more."
"0","5","these brownies were excellent! I did add a little bit of milk to the frosting to make it easier to spread."
"0","5","Mine always turn out a little bit gooey in the middle but I love it!"
"0","5","One word - DELICIOUS!!! I can't believe how simple and quick this recipe is. I just finished making it, and turned out perfect!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. Moist and rich. The only thing different I did was I added one large egg yolk to make it really moist. Do not overcook - always check since most ovens vary in temperature control settings."
"0","5","I made these last night and they turned out amazing. I didn't use a blender just gently stirred everything and 25 minutes in the oven was long enough. the frosting took a little bit to actually become frosting, but to me tasted like chocolate froating you get at the store. Definitely a great recipe to use Again."
"0","5","this was so good I made it was my brother and he loved them so much that we make them once a week from now on!!! so anyone who is going to try this recipe do it it's super good. the first time i made them they came out kinda bad but the second time it was perfect"
"0","5","Oh my fatness these were so good!! Must refrain from making them on a regular. Did all the mixing by hand in the pot I melted the butter in. Turned out delish! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","I've made these brownies twice now and they have turned out awesome...the recipe is easy to follow and fast ...my kids and I can whip up a batch anytime a chocolate craving strikes us..thanks for fun and easy recipes :)"
"0","2","This recipe turned out horrible. I baked them for 25 minutes as stated in the recipe they were still raw and gooey in the middle so i left it in for another 10 minutes. Pulled it out to cool. Cut them into bars and all the chocolate chips I added to the recipe sank to the bottom and they were still gooey on the bottom and they fell apart and was not even 1/2 inch thick. I was expecting a more taller brownie and one that would be done and not falling apart."
"0","5","Turned out great! Love it!"
"0","4","Nice brownie, not too sweet but very tasty and moist. Will make this again :)"
"0","5","Just made these and holy cow they're yummy. Easily the only brownie recipe I'll ever use again!"
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","WOW...very good, I doubled the recipe and substituted 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the eggs. On one half I added a few mini marshmallows (good addition) and one minute before they came out of the oven I sprinkled chocolate chips on top instead of the frosting, they were excellent"
"0","5","We really love this one... quick and easy to prepare. I shorten the cooking time a little because we like them extra gooey!"
"0","5","I had to make them without salt because we were out! But they're amazing! I love the frosting."
"0","5","Perfectly fudge brownies. I did not make the frosting but added a cheesecake topping, which it doesn't need. Easy, one pot mix with very little work. My go to recipe from now on. My only change, minor and not necessary, was to add chopped dark chocolate chips to the mix, about 1/4 cup."
"0","2","These brownies are taste like butter, aren't chocolatey enough, and are too sweet. I recommend Brooke's Brombshell Brownies."
"0","5","Love this recipe... Easy and tasty!!"
"0","4","Taste more like cake! But it's very easy and yummy!"
"0","4","So this was an experiment for me, I was low on flour but wanted something sweet. So I subbed in pancake mix for the flour, baking powder and salt. Doubled the recipe, nixed the icing, and cooked it in a round stone pan. It turned out great, but maybe a little over sweet, although I might have counted wrong when adding the sugar... Very dense, chewy, and good! Also, I found the measurements in the directions a little confusing since they didn't match the 16 servings laid out for the recipe..."
"0","5","Superb. I doubled it right off the bat. And good thing I did. They went fast.   For the butter, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. It came out with a pleasant hint of coconut flavor. Really, really good!"
"0","4","Very tasty. More 'cake-like' than I prefer with brownies -- even mixing by hand -- but not all the way to fluffiness. I think the texture might work better if I added nuts or some other extra. Only deviation from the recipe came because I was out of vanilla extract; used brandy instead, with good results."
"0","4","I doubled the recipe and put it in a 11' x 7' pan. Also the frosting was way to dry, not spreadable so I added 2-3 tablesppons of buttermilk I just happened to have in the fridge and mixed it with an electric hand mixer. I think 1/2 & 1/2 would work as well."
"0","4","I've made these twice now and they are amazing. The recipe is confusing though. On the list of ingredients it says one thing and in the instructions it says another. I used the amounts stated in the instructions and they come out great. With the frosting I add about 1T of milk so it will actually blend together."
"0","5","These are awesome brownies!!! I have now made them several times and it is always a hit. I do make a double batch and make adjustments that have been suggested."
"0","5","Wow! These really are the BEST Brownies! I even cut butter in half and add 1/4 c light mayo to cut out some calories. I also add 1/3 c pureed carrot. These are super fudgy and you would never know the healthier changes I made! The batter still even tastes awesome!"
"0","5","Just made these, and used heart shaped silicone molds. Delicious!! I did not have honey, and frosting was very dry without it, so I added a little maple syrup and a splash of brewed coffee. Turned out good. May skip dinner, and just go for dessert."
"0","4","I just made this and it was really good"
"0","4","Really good recipe! I added a tiny bit extra honey (like 1/4 tsp just because I was finishing off the last bit I had) and I added about 2 tbsp of cream cheese to the frosting because it seemed really thick and kind of chunky and I thought it needed something to smooth it out a bit. Result? Absolutely decadent. Also I only put it in for 20 minutes, if I had gone 25 it would've burnt for sure. I sprinkled some shredded coconut on top and it's amazing!!! I doubt there will be any left in half an hour between my boyfriend and I haha."
"0","4","The key to this recipe is not to over bake them. The first time I made them I had them in the oven for 35 mins - they turned out dry and awful. I decided to try it again and took them out of the oven after 20 mins - WAY better, moist and good."
"0","4","Pretty good. I made mine without the icing because I don't like overly sweet brownies. The top turned into a delicious candy coating while baking, and the center remained gooey. This is how I like my brownies. However I would say to add a few more tbsps. of the cocoa powder, or throw in a few handfuls of chocolate chips if you aren't icing them, because as is they are just not chocolately enough in the flavouring. My boyfriend said they were good and I couldn't have really improved them much."
"0","5","I've tried a few brownie recipes lately and this one is the keeper! Made it exactly as the recipe stated...they were perfect!"
"0","4","yes, truly one of the best recipes."
"0","3","I followed the recipe exactly. The brownies turned out more cake-like than brownie. I baked them for 27 minutes, but they were slightly burned on the edges. Also I thought they turned out pretty dry. The frosting was dry too. I had to add a tablespoon of milk to the frosting to get it to come together. I would reduce the baking time if I were to make these again. Meh."
"0","5","Easy to make and has a great flavor. Don't over bake as many say and wait until almost cooled. Mmmm so good with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","4","These are fantastic! They are so easy to make. It's so fudgy and delicious. I couldn't have enough! The frosting is a little to goopy and doesn't fit all of the brownies, but otherwise, magnificent!"
"0","5","these are fantastc! thankful for other reviewers reinforcing not to overcook, i took them out right at 25 mins and they are sooo perfect! thank you!!!"
"0","5","Perfect brownies! I also melted the butter to make the frosting and needed to add a tablespoon of water to make it spreadable. Didn't have honey so substiuted maple syrup and worked great. My little boy and I made these and couldn't stop eating them - be warned!!!"
"0","5","My husband and I have tried dozens of brownie recipes and this is by far the best. These brownies are our Friday night tradition, I have never tasted a brownie better than this, even the one I had at a 5 star restaurant. We use dark chocolate cocoa usually and they taste amazing either way. One review said to leave an egg out when doubling, we never do and they always turn out. They are not too rich, they aren't dry or heavy, they are the perfect combination of everything a brownie should be, you wont be disappointed. As others have said, just be sure to not over mix it, or they will turn out more like a cake."
"0","5","Made this recipe tonight and loved it!! Not too sweet and delicious still warm!"
"0","5","I have mad this recipe so many times and everyone of those times these have tasted Ah-mazing!!!!!!! My family eats them all and by the end of the day they are all gone. Best brownie recipe POSSIBLE!!!!"
"0","5","My kids loved them. Said they were the best brownies ever! I tried a different recipe for brownies a few weeks after making these and they were barely touched! Making this recipe from now on when the Teen sweet tooth strikes."
"0","5","It turned out perfect! I added walnuts and the family loved it! No more boxed brownies for us. This is a winner of a recipe. Thank you!"
"0","5","I had a chocolate fix and all ingredient's on hand. Perfect."
"0","5","This was a perfect recipe! My family devoured them immediately. Next time, I will double or triple this. Thanks."
"0","5","I was desperately craving something chocolate and found this brownie recipe. I made it with Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate powder and added walnuts. I spread the frosting on while it was warm. I had a 9' square pan, so I baked it 20 minutes to ensure it would be chewy. OMG, they turned out wonderful. Crazy rich with the 'Special Dark Chocolate', which is good, because then I will only eat one instead of two. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I use Hersey's special dark chocolate power and after taking the melted butter, I mix in about 1-2 tbls of peanut butter (depending on taste). Then before mixing in the flour mixture, I add some crushed walnuts. It was a wonderful balance of flavors my boyfriend cannot get enough of! I am asked to make brownies at least once a week!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I always make just half the amount for my husband and I.  I butter 2 small 10oz ramekins and bake at 350 for 21 mins. I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup (instead of 1/2 if halving the original recipe)  I let them cool for 10 mins and serve with vanilla ice cream (no frosting needed!) and they come out Sightly crispy on the edges and soft, almost gooey in the center."
"0","5","I took these brownies to Xmas party and not a crumb left, they were moist and absolutely delicious, I changed nothing."
"0","4","This is a really good recipe though the frosting was a little sweet."
"0","5","As easy to make as out of a box and tastier"
"0","5","I really enjoy this recipe. All around it's just a good brownie. Soft dense, not too cakey and not too overly fudgy but fudgy enough. Lovely chocolatey taste, not too sweet and sweet enough. I don't use the frosting it's incredible entirely on its own. Thanks Angie so much for sharing!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had! They taste so much better than the box and so easy and fast to make. They're always very moist and delicious."
"0","5","There are literally no words for these brownies!!! My father commented that they were the best brownies he's ever had! Of course, I did have to double the recipe. I also added about a cup of chocolate chips. But after that, oh wait, I found a word, YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!"
"0","3","They taste ok but are gooey. I cooked them 27 minutes."
"0","4","All my ingredients were room temperature when I started making them. Hopefully it still works. They look okay and smell great."
"0","5","my favorite brownie recipe. So easy and way better than any boxed mix! don't overmix batter :)"
"0","4","Delicioso"
"0","4","I love this recipe. I bring it to every family event, always with a new twist. For the holodays I sprinkled some crushed candy cane to make an amazing holoday treat."
"0","4","Everyone loved these."
"0","4","I added just a tad bit of milk to the frosting because there was no liquid to make it spreadable . Turned out great !!"
"0","5","I usually have no success baking brownies, but at the same time have picky eaters, these were a hit!"
"0","2","The brownies didn't really have a chocolate brownie taste. And the frosting was to grainy. I would definitely suggest adding milk or less sugar to the frosting. And adding more chocolate to the brownies."
"0","5","I thought this was great! I asked my 7 year-old if he liked them. He said 'I didn't like them, I LOVE them'. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","made for my sons birthday everyone love them"
"0","3","Frosting was way too sweet, but the brownie itself was amazing."
"0","5","I love this recipe! these brownies are PERFECTION"
"0","5","AWesome, !! they were awesome."
"0","5","These brownies are so yummy!!!! Did not even use the frosting, they are perfect without it!!!"
"0","5","The best!!! So moist and delicious."
"0","5","These are GREAT!!! I usually double the recipe and use half regular cocoa, and half dark cocoa. Gives them just a bit more richer flavor. I also thin the frosting with water to make it easier to spread without tearing up the top of the brownies, becomes a nice chocolate glaze."
"0","5","Wow best Brownies ever!"
"0","5","Big hit with the family and friends."
"0","1","This turned out inedible. However, I'm going to try this again... I tried to double it & think I screwed up somewhere...but it came out cakey."
"0","5","I used coconut oil instead of butter and added chocolate chips. So amazing we didn't even use the frosting."
"0","5","Very yummy and easy. Doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 pan. I used margerine to keep it lactose free (would be excellent with butter). I didn't make the frosting but will try this when I make them for a party next week. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I just made used this recipe to make the brownies and wow. Best recipe for brownies hands down. They're moist and not overwhelming with sweetness"
"0","5","Delicious!!!!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! The fact that you melt the butter in a saucepan, instead of leaving it out in advance to soften, is so much easier! I can never remember to set things out before hand and I don't have a microwave to soften butter in. I used honey instead of vanilla and it tastes great!"
"0","5","Amazing! Same look (cracked surface) and texture (chewy) as the kind from a box, but with a homemade taste. I'll be hanging onto this recipe for a long time."
"0","5","Do yourself a favor and add 2 ounces of baking chocolate to the melting butter to make these best brownies even better! The extra chocolate made them so fudgy, which is my preference. Took them to Thanksgiving and people were raving. I also added chocolate chips and chopped pecans, tossed in cocoa powder to keep them from sinking to the bottom. Did not add frosting on top and they were still amazing! Definitely going back to this recipe whenever I need brownies."
"0","2","Made the recipe as is with no changes. It came out extremely fluffy and cakey even though I barely mixed it. Also, it did not taste very chocolately at all. Very disappointed in the top rated brownie recipe. Brooke's bombshell brownies are definitely better and fudgier."
"0","5","Deeeelish!"
"0","5","Very rich but delicious."
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly as written except I added walnuts; I did not use the frosting. It was excellent."
"0","2","Not sure if there is any point in leaving a review since there are so many others... but IMO these are way too 'eggy.' Most recipes I have used in the past called for 1 egg, and this has 2, sooo... guess I will keep searching for the best one!"
"0","5","Really good! my wife and son love it! Used dark chocolate cocoa powder instead and added some walnut."
"0","5","Great recipe. Doubled recipe. Used coconut oil instead of butter, only 3 eggs and threw in some mini chocolate chips. Only had dark chocolate Cocoa. Nice texture. Will make again."
"0","5","This recipe was SO easy and much better than the box kind! I added a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter but would have been just as wonderful without them!"
"0","5","These were to die for! Loved 'em."
"0","4","--doubled the recipe, using 3 eggs and kept the salt at 1/4tsp. --these are extremely rich; the kids didn't really care for them cos they were too rich, esp with the frosting ---they are a cross btwn fudge and brownies as far as consistency goes"
"0","5","Yummy and easy to make. I added 1/2 cup of pecans though."
"0","5","I added approximately one tablespoon of cream cheese to the icing. These were very good and rich. My husband also kept saying how good they were."
"0","4","These brownies are FANTASTIC!! I only give 4 stars because the frosting seems off. It tastes great but it needs about 1/4 c. milk to make it spreadable. I've tried putting it on right out of the oven and it still doesn't spread. Most often though, I make them without the frosting."
"0","5","These were awesome! My husband doesn't even like brownies but he told me to save this recipe! I didn't make the frosting, which I'm happy about because these were fudgy all on their own...frosting may be overkill. I didn't make any changes other than sprinkling some chocolate chips on top prior to baking. It's rare for me to not want to alter recipes, but these are amazing!"
"0","5","I just made these and ate them hot! After reading a few reviews and before cooking, I made some changes. I did not have a brownie pan so I used a glass round pan. I used Hershey's Dark Cocoa (made the brownies almost a satin black color!) The pan made no difference. I also added some coconut milk and it gave them a much softer chew. They were not dry at all but I see how some of the comments say they were (good idea to beat your eggs separately and do not overbeat the mixture). I think that is the key, also took mine out at 20 minutes not 25."
"0","5","This is our favorite brownie recipe bar none! Simple to make and super tasty. We use Bob's Red Mill all-purpose gluten free flour, it always comes out perfectly and with smiles!"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","These are the most wonderful brownies you will ever make in your life. They're like grandma's house, happiness, unicorns and all things good in this world. Like I'm pretty sure whoever came up with this recipe had to sell their soul to the devil to create a brownie recipe like this."
"0","5","perfect every time and quick to whip up after supper when you don't have anything for dessert"
"0","5","I read reviews saying the brownies came out too cake-like which is a pet peeve of mine so I only added one egg and I hand mixed everything. They took 29 minutes to bake and they are DELICIOUS!! Gooey as ever but still aw to cut and hold together;the way I love brownies! Definitely using this recipe from now on!"
"0","5","I make these gf with pamelas products baking mix. Amazing!!!"
"0","5","These are easy to make and delicious brownies!!!"
"0","5","These brownies are easy to make and turn out very yummy! I am definitely glad that I tried this recipe!"
"0","5","I've made a bunch of different brownies over the years. This recipe, by far, has achieved the impossible! My hubby and kids BEG me to make these. I followed this recipe exactly! I did use my kitchen aide stand mixer on the lowest setting to mix. But I hand mixed the frosting. I added some walnuts to it also, but that's just adding something extra.  All I can say is this recipe is AMAZING! I wouldn't change anything about it!"
"0","5","Love it!"
"0","5","There are 2 styles of Brownies - Cake brownies and Fudge brownies. These are practically perfect cake brownies that come together quickly. The recipe is a good base if you like to experiment, but it also produces a fabulous brownie with no changes or additions at all!"
"0","5","I didn't have the ingredients for the icing, so I made them without and they were FABULOUS! I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, because I love chocolate. So wonderful! I'll never need to buy boxed brownie mix again! Thank you."
"0","5","My family and I love these brownies! We're not big on the hard crunchy brownies that you can barely crew the outside edge. I found this recipe three days ago and already made them twice. The second batch is going to work with me to share!"
"0","5","There's a reason why the title of this is BEST BROWNIE. This turns out great EVERY time"
"0","4","Very sweet. Very quick and easy to make. Halved quantities, it baked incredibly fast so mine were overcooked but that did not distract from what a satisfying chocolate hit these were. If I make these again, I will be extra vigilant with the cooking time and use a third less sugar"
"0","1","Did not taste like chocolate and actually tasted like the eggs used in them."
"0","5","I love making these brownies and to add some flare for a dinner party I add pudding (your flavor choice) and whipped cream on top, let them chill about 30-60 min and serve :)"
"0","5","I've made these twice now and they're, well, gone in a hurry. I just use a basic choc butter crm frosting recipe but instead of vanilla, I use really strong, fresh brewed coffee. Absolutely fantastic!"
"0","4","Tried this recipe last night. Very happy with it. Delicious!"
"0","5","Oh.My.Gosh. What a mistake to make these little specimens of yumminess. I am surely doomed to gain at least 100 pounds. I have no idea how the negative reviews even happened. They are definitely NOT cake-like or dry or grainy. Granted, they're a bit sweet, but nothing a cup of coffee or glass of milk can't handle. We thought they were gastronomically orgasmic."
"0","5","great treat! we added 1/4 cup of chopped nuts!"
"0","5","These brownies were a hit with everyone---especially the males in my family. They are so easy to make. I doubled the recipie for a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 minuets. We have a new family recipient for brownies."
"0","5","These are absolutely positively the best brownies I have ever had! :)"
"0","5","These brownies are AMAZING!! if you read a bad review that says 'these are the worst brownies', because these brownies are easy & they always turn out! I always double the recipe & get creative w mine and add walnuts, chocolate chips & caramel chunks!... yummm! oh and i never make the frosting, they're half way gone before I get to it!!!"
"0","5","Loved these brownies! Easy recipe and quick to make. Didn't care for the frosting and will leave it off next time. Best homemade brownies ever! I will go back to this recipe all the time."
"0","5","I've made this recipe many times now and the result is always the same, yummy good ! As someone else suggested, I mix everything by hand as well as slightly mix the eggs before incorporating into the mixture. I've tried it with and without the icing good either way. Try it out :)"
"0","5","Really good recipe! I was looking for a brownie recipe to make that would be like the little bites brownies that my son likes. I cut this recipe in half and made using a mini muffin pan and cooked for 12 minutes. came out perfectly!"
"0","5","Didn't make the frosting, but it was delicious by itself. Had to make a second batch within a week. Yum. I added some strawberry topping I had lying around and swirled it in the batter and it was perfection."
"0","5","Truly the best."
"0","2","Way too sweet & greasy for me. Used the mentioned sugar & butter."
"0","5","Soo irresistible. These are super easy and you can whip up a batter in less then 10 min. These can please any guests. They're so gooey and super moist. Couldn't have asked for a better recipe. Added crushed Oreos and it looks like I put a lot of effort in it ;)"
"0","5","The family really liked these. I doubled everything and baked them in a 9X13 pan. Think I baked them 25-30 mins. I used Penzeys natural high fat cocoa. Really rich chocolate. Will make again."
"0","5","Wow! Yum. This is my first ever review of a recipe. These are so simple, exactly what I was craving. I skipped the frosting, didn't think they needed it although for extra decadence, I'm sure it's great. I think they taste better than any box mix and they don't have any of the preservatives or artificial flavorings. Very moist, very quick. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","This recipe was delicious!!! I used the 'adjust recipe' feature to cut the recipe in ½ so I could sample it without wasting a lot of my kitchen ingredients (in the event it did not turn out as 'the best brownie') and I added some chocolate chips. OH MY GOODNESS IT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD!!! Just add some Oberweise vanilla ice-cream and you have yourself a super delicious brownie a la mode that will be sure to send you to your happy place! LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!"
"0","5","Favorite brownies! I wasn't sure about the frosting but this time I made it and it is my new favorite frosting!! Love everything about this recipe! I make it every time and everyone always raves about them!"
"0","5","These are great brownies!!! I love them!!!"
"0","5","Delicious!! I heated the frosting though as well, let them sit and ate them the next day.My 9 year old loves them too. I call them the PMS killers, lol. I had to protect them from the rest of the family though, lol."
"0","5","This recipie was amazing! I actually cooked one batch at 275 degrees for 55 minutes, and they came out a lot better than the others! It takes a long time, but it was definitely worth it."
"0","5","These were so good! I followed other people's advice and I made sure that I did not over mix or over bake them. I also added 1 Tablespoon of half and half and 1 Tablespoon of corn syrup to the frosting as per the advice of one review. All I can say is that the brownies were perfect - rich, great texture, not cake-like at all. The frosting was an added bonus. My husband and I downed them in one day. They are dangerous to have in the house! Another great thing about them - you can whip them up very quickly and you generally have all the ingredients on hand!"
"0","5","I made these as written and we loved them. I didn’t find them to be cake like at all as another reviewer did. They were moist and delicious. I added walnuts to mine since my husband insists on nuts in his brownies. I also used organic cacao powder instead of the standard Hershey’s cocoa. A wonderful easy brownie recipe!"
"0","4","I liked the basic idea of this brownie recipe. I found that they were too thin, too wet/dense and way too sweet. They also lacked a rich, chocolate flavor in my opinion. So I altered the recipe by adding 1/2 c cocoa powder and semisweet chocolate chunks. I also decreased the sugar to a little less than 3/4c. This made the brownies rich and chocolatey. When you frost them, the very sweet buttercream works great with the not-too-sweet brownie. Yum. I have also frosted these with dark chocolate ganache that I whipped with the balloon whisk! Talk about dreamy."
"0","3","These were really good the first day. Don't refrigerate them because they will get hard. Don't worry if they are thin when you pour them in the dish. They will get thicker. Overall I love them."
"0","5","These are delicious, moist brownies. They're rich and fudgy. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't know why some reviews say they're bland or dry. Maybe it's the quality of the ingredients being used. As far as those who've used coconut oil or applesauce, you are changing the taste and are no longer following the recipe. Therefore, your rating on this recipe is misleading. I also made the frosting. It's very good, but is a little dry, so I used about 2 teaspoons of milk so it would whip up easier. Do not mix by hand. You need an electric mixer. It makes a small amount of frosting. Only enough for a thin layer on an 8 in pan. Delicious!"
"0","5","My family attacked these and left all but a crumb in the bottom of the pan! I actually tripled this recipe and baked it in a 13x9 pan coated with pam baking spray for about 45 minutes due to the extra batter. Check with a toothpick to make sure its done. I didn't use the frosting either because this brownie is one that is just perfect on its own."
"0","5","This. Is the brownie to double for sure because 8X8 is not enough to satisfy your chocolate craving of dense brownie and creamy chocolate frosting. I followed this recipe even the frosting recipe with the honey added. This is a keeper! (^_^)"
"0","4","As written the brownies were a strong four star. Moist with a great taste, although I thought the frosting made it too sweet. To make it a phenomenal recipe I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, added chopped pecans and left off the frosting."
"0","4","Very easy and everyone loves them!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe a few days ago and we loved it! (I did add chocolate and butterscotch chips to the batter.). Then I made it again yesterday and left it in the oven a few extra minutes accidentally. It didn't burn, but definitely wasn't as moist as before. I doubt anyone else noticed it, though--the brownies still have to be hidden from scavengers in search of chocolate between meals!! Oh...I used Hershey's Dark Cocoa and it made them super dark, more like you'd get from a mix. (The first batch was very light colored.) Also I used whole wheat flour. Very good recipe!!"
"0","1","FAR too sweet to eat"
"0","5","So I made these for a bbq with our neighbors and everyone lived then of course I made a double batch but other than that all I did different was used coconut oil instead of butter they were the perfect texture and I did use my mixer just on a very low speed. I also didn't use the icing cuz I hate icing so I just sprinkled powdered sugar over them but they were perfect gooey brownies"
"0","3","I doubled the recipe and made in a 9 X 13 pan. I also used Cacao instead of regular cocoa to be way cooler than most people. I used organic sugar too. Which also makes be slightly cooler than most. It came out pretty good. I did not make the icing since I don't have any confectioners sugar. That would be kind of lame to have that stuff around. I might make some out of raw honey if I feel like it later."
"0","2","I followed the recipe exactly, and the brownies were pretty bland. The frosting was really clumpy, so I wasn't able to use it."
"0","5","Amazingly delicious! When I made this I tripled the recipe for 9x13 pan and I mixed everything by hand so it wouldn't get over mixed and turn into a cake like brownie. I also added chocolate chips and walnuts which made them almost fudge like."
"0","2","Mine came out like cake. I've made this twice and been disappointed."
"0","3","These were just OK for me. The taste was fine, but they did not make a tall, fluffy brownie like a prefer. I will stick with my fudgey brownie recipe. Thank you for submitting though"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and did one less egg like others said. It's amazing"
"0","5","This is a great and simple recipe! I would recommend melting the butter in a microwave and adding the cocoa to the melted butter first before mixing in the other ingredients. My family loved it, and I agree with or he reviewers, I will never buy a box brownie mix ever again!"
"0","5","OMG!!!! So amazing. I never use any other recipe. It always turns out so good. I double the recipe and my family always finishes it in one day."
"0","5","These are the best brownies ever. I will never buy boxed mix again. They are perfect with a scoop of ice cream on top. These are incredibly fudgy. I used the icing recipe included and it was great. I baked these for 22 min in a Pyrex dish and they were baked perfectly for my tastes. It was fudge-like, but also stayed together enough to have good bites. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","My boyfriend ate the whole thing he loved it.. I covered my glass pan with aluminum foil over so it wouldn't burn or dry the dough out."
"0","5","Awesome! I should have cooked them a little longer, and the icing made them wwwaaaayyyy too rich! I had to eat them with ice cream to cut the sweetness :-) PERFECT!!!!! I will leave off the icing next time, it's just a touch too much"
"0","3","The brownies turned out and cut very easily- but that's about the extent of what I liked about them. They were spongy, and felt butter oozed out when you bit into them. I felt like they needed more chocolate too. Sorry, not a fan."
"0","5","Just made them this week. They were so good and moist. I will never use a box mix again. I didn't even need the frosting. I doubled the recipe to make a bigger batch. My kids loved them."
"0","5","Made this for the first time last night. Made them exactly like the recipe states, minus the icing. I did fold in mini semi sweet chocolate chips, just a little. These were delicious. This will be my go to homemade brownies! They were super easy to make. Great recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe turned out perfect! I omitted the salt and added 1/2 tsp extra vanilla, and those changes didn't even need to happen! This is the perfect brownie. It is so easy and such a hit!"
"0","5","Perfect as written, hand blended"
"0","3","I think they were too sweet. I made them for a party, and other people likes them."
"0","5","Didn't have any honey so I used a about a tbs of milk for the frosting. Delicious brownies."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly!!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have ever eaten. I highly recommend the recipe. I added milk chocolate chips as a garnishment after frosting the warm brownies. Delicious, and a must try for the chocolate lovers!"
"0","5","These turned out really well... As others advised, do not overbake. 25 min was perfect. I did add about a half cup of semi-sweet chips, just because chocoholics live here. Frosting was perfect. I will use this one again and again as a base recipe.... Can't wait to add nuts, or peanut butter chips, mint chocolate, caramel... the possibilities are endless! Thanks!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe baked in a 9 by 13 dish and skipped the frosting. I got lots of compliments."
"0","5","For a fantastic variation, use Hersheys Special Dark cocoa (or any dark chocolate cocoa) and drop some chocolate chips on top. Absolutely delicious. My wife and I have christened these 'Crack brownies'. So delicious-- it's rare they last beyond the evening we bake them."
"0","5","This is a never-fail recipe. It is also one of my 'go-to' recipes when I need to bring a quick and tasty treat over to an outing or special occasion. Always gets rave reviews. Simply can't beat it."
"0","5","Well, the name of this recipe is bang on. I literally cannot stop making (and then eating) these. I had to buy more flour today just to feed my addiction. If we don't have these in our house, my husband gets antsy about it because he loves them possibly even more than I do. I say 'possibly' because that's just what he tells me, but I honestly have a hard time believing that. Maybe it is a tie. Maybe. I didn't change anything in this recipe, it isn't necessary. Make these, and enjoy!!"
"0","2","Very very cake like. Not much like a brownie. I followed the directions to the bone and I found them tasking like a cake not at all like a brownie. Won't make them again"
"0","5","These were real good. I prefer brownies plain so therefore did not use the icing portion of the recipe, plus it cut down on the sugar calories! Thanks Angie for a tasty brownie that pairs well with a cup of coffee!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies ever! I always use this recipe when making brownies and they turn out great every time. I highly recommend these fantastic brownies."
"0","4","Such an easy no fuss recipe! Key to this is to NOT over mix, and I underbake To just 20 minutes because I use a glass pan. Only problem was the brownie was stuck to the pan so I cut up into 9 squares and then took out one by one. Used 2/3 of sugar and no frosting. Still very sweet. I will reduce a bit of sugar next! Comes out chewy on the sides and a bit fudgy in the middle."
"0","3","An ok brownie recipe but nothing special in my opinion."
"0","5","These brownies are amazing! I can't believe I always used a box. Easy to make and delicious. They turned out fudgy and flavorful. The frosting didn't work for me (very dry and gritty) so I added a little bit of water and peanut butter and it came out amazingly."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious!!! Best brownies I have ever made! I was careful not to over mix or over bake. I did not use the frosting because my family likes them without."
"0","4","The brownies were great but didn't like the frosting. If you make it according to the recipe it is very dry. You need to add more liquid, like one other review points out. I added some half and half and some corn syrup. Still didn't like the taste of the frosting but the brownies were good!"
"0","5","These are seriously the best brownies ever! Every single time I make them they turn out. Awesome basic recipe that is easily doubled and can have nuts or whatever added to it. Using dark cocoa powder yields amazingly rich deliciously gooey brownies. The edges are always crunchy and the middle is always soft and gooey.   *Important Note* I have a gas oven. I find that when I bake things in my gas oven, I have to lower the temp by 25 degrees. I do this for all baked goods, and these brownies were not an exception. I cooked them at 325 instead of 350."
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice in 4 days! Doubled it, mixed by hand, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan ~ both times I tested with a knife, which came out clean at 25 minutes. I read another review that said to leave an egg out when doubling the recipe. I followed the recipe to a T ~ PERFECT!!! Haven't tried the frosting yet. Second time I made them I added Reese's Pieces ~ YUM! I doubt I will ever try another recipe."
"0","5","I, too, doubled the recipe and didn't bother frosting the brownies since I was taking them on a trip with me, and they were absolutely wonderful."
"0","5","I just made these brownies today and they tasted so much like my grandmother's that I cried for hours because I miss her so much. I will be keeping this recipe and making these for the rest of my life and hand it down to my kids and grandkids, too. Delicious, the frosting is great, and they're nice and crispy on the edges just the way I like it. They are very rich, though so I would definitely eat them with a tall glass of cold milk :)"
"0","5","This has been my go to brownie and chocolate frosting recipe for about the last year. I usually add a mixture of milk and semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter, but recently just tried them with the frosting and was blown away. 5 stars all the way!"
"0","5","These really are the BEST brownies I've ever had!"
"0","5","I'm not a frosted brownie kind of girl, but other than omitting that, and doubling the recipe, I stayed true. Yum! It wasn't the cracked top, that you would get from a boxed brownie, but the 'cake looking' brownie was nothing but perfect. It may have looked like cake from the top, but that's where it stopped. Adding this to my recipe box!"
"0","5","Delicious cakelike brownies! I added a cup of chopped walnuts and sprinkled the top with chocolate chips instead of making the frosting, and I'm glad because the brownies themselves are plenty sweet. Doubling the recipe works well for a 9x13 pan, taking just about five more minutes in the oven. I will definitely make these again. They were a huge hit in my household!"
"0","3","The recipe was rather tedious. Usually the brownie recipes I use call for oil instead of butter so this is a new try for me. They came out looking okay. I made the frosting, and it was very easy and simple. I ran into a problem when I couldn't find my measuring spoons so I may have glitched up the recipe just a bit. They still came out good. They were really thin, and I didn't overmix or overbake, I just think there wasn't enough batter for the pan I used. They are really tasty, but I think I'll stick to my normal brownie recipe."
"0","5","So simple, and so wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, and the brownies turned out perfect. They were a big hit at a July 4th party! Thanks so much - this will be my go-to brownie recipe!"
"0","5","Best brownies ever! Doubles the recepie and used a 9x13 pan! Wish there were 100 stars to rate this!"
"0","5","I will never make brownies from a box again! Perfect. Easy, simple, fast. Don't over mix"
"0","5","These brownies are amazing! I love the way that they are perfectly fudgey and moist but not too dense. The icing is very good but using whipped cream and melted chocolate also works very well. It is very important to not cook for too long because you really don't want to burn these, they are too delicious to miss. #Awesome"
"0","5","Delicious. Extremely easy and fast. I've got a 14 month old and a new born and don't have a lot of time for complicated recipes. This was perfect. I made them for a 4th of July party and they almost didn't make it there! I needed to double the recipe for a 9x13 and took another users advice and omitted one egg. I don't know if it makes a difference but these were fantastic. I also whisked the eggs with a fork before adding them to the butter and sugar. Again, don't know if it makes a difference. And I didn't make the frosting (didn't have time) but instead sprinkled with a layer of powdered sugar. This is a keeper."
"0","5","Very good basic brownie recipe."
"0","5","These were really good. Made them yesterday. They were a little more Fluffy then I expected them to be, Maybe because I used a Smaller Pan, so it came out almost like Cake. But had a REALLY Good Flavor. Next time I'll Melt or make some Homemade Soft Carmel to Swirl in with it."
"0","5","These delectable treats were absolutely scrumptious! I also doubled the ingredients, and used raw turbinado sugar in place of white sugar, and vegan buttery sticks in the place of the butter. This was my first experience making homemade brownies, and now I am never going to buy a pre-made box again!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. It's the perfect brownie to serve 'a la mode'. No need to alter the recipe in my opinion. So moist and fudgy! Has that perfect soft center with slightly crunchy top. Mmmm!"
"0","4","These were really good! I'm a rather inexperienced cook so I was happy with the simple recipe, my only slight complaint of personal taste is these weren't very chewy or crispy on the top. The texture was soft and moist, but still more cakey then I generally think of brownies being. I also left off the icing and that was nice because even without it the brownie was very sweet."
"0","4","I used the wrong kind of flour with these...yet yhey turned out pretty good. Did not last long because hubby devoured them! Next time will use the right type of flour. Quick and easy to make"
"0","5","this is my go-to brownie recipe! love making it with the grandkids"
"0","5","I am on my third batch of these and love it. The first batch i used coconut sugar instead of white sugar and the brownies came out tasting like a 70% dark chocolate very good flavor. the second batch i used white sugar but mistakenly only added 1 egg made an excellent chocolate cookie dough lol not intended but happy accident. third batch is the correct recipe high expectations."
"0","5","By far the best brownies I've ever tasted in my life. I make this often as it is a favourite. Doubling the recipe also results in amazing taste bud deliciousness. I NEVER make the frosting that goes along with it- the brownies are the right amount of sweet that satisfies. Any sweeter and it'd be too sweet.  Delicious.. I've even under cooked them so they were extra gooey and extra delicious."
"0","5","Best brownies ever.... didn't even do the frosting"
"0","5","Made these brownies yesterday and my family who are quite picky, loved them. They were so easy to make and very tasty... I did half white and half brown sugar - Will definately make them again - maybe try the applesauce substitute instead of the butter."
"0","5","We skipped the frosting and just dusted the cooled brownies with powdered sugar. They are really good and simple to make. I'll definitely make these again!"
"0","3","I am not a connoisseur of brownies but these did seem a little bland and cakey. I did not make the frosting because we didn't have confectioners sugar so that may have made all the difference. Will try again with the frosting and update when I have the chance."
"0","5","I loved this recipe! My younger brother loves it too! I've made this recipe millions of times and I'm still not tired of it. :)"
"0","5","No more boxed mixes for me....this was so quick and easy in one sauce pan! I added chocolate chips to the top and left the frosting off. Took them to work for picnic day and they were gone in a flash!"
"0","5","The best brownies that I've ever made!"
"0","5","These were delicious and so easy to make! I baked them in a 9x13 glass pan for 25 minutes and they came out perfectly! I also frosted them. My S/O and I loved them and I cannot wait to make them again for others!"
"0","5","Oh yes!!! These brownies are the bomb.com. I upped the quantities by half but when I went to mix in the eggs, my kids left only one in the fridge. I improvised with egg whites and they came out just fine. I also added 1/4 mini chocolate chips and since I don't like frosting on my brownies, I omitted that. I also only stirred the ingredients until they were all moist, no more."
"0","1","These have way too much butter."
"0","1","I followed the recipe and cannot figure out why they are dry and almost rubbery."
"0","5","Was so easy my kidz made it ... amazing ...great brownies"
"0","5","I have made these several times and its a big hit wherever I take them! These are so easy and so much fun to make! I just had my daughter and her friends make this recipe and they are just waiting for the oven to do its thing! :) And oh by the way they all had fun licking their fingers over the batter and they do like what they taste :)"
"0","5","These were amazing! I was looking for a brownie recipe and this was perfect!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies. I will make it again"
"0","5","These are super good!!! They go great with macadamia nuts."
"0","4","It's nice at first but for some reason, then hardened and they are soooo hard to get off the tray now, but personally, I think they r chewy and like candy. Thanks for the recipe anyways:D"
"0","5","Worth a shot my grandparents and family love this recipe if you get a chance make sure you try it. Amazing!"
"0","4","Good taste, but too sweet. When I make it again I'd cut the sugar by half at least."
"0","1","I followed the recipe to the T and it did NOT turn out...they were WAY WAY to salty... 20 minutes was too long in the oven, they came out like cake..."
"0","1","This recipe did not turn out at all. For some reason they were all buttery to the point where they lift little spots of butter on the plate underneath them. I have no idea what happened as I followed the recipe to a T. Half a cup of butter seems like way too much for the sugar and flour ratio... I used a smaller pan but that shouldn't have made the difference between the best brownies ever and these ones, which were the worst."
"0","5","I added a wee bit of milk to this recipe, as it was really thick, and disregarded the frosting... so yummy!"
"0","5","Perfect in my 'perfect brownie' pan!"
"0","5","The batter is divine. It goes together quickly with things I always have on hand. The frosting is VERY thick, but I think it will thin out as it goes on the warm brownies. This is JUST as quick as breaking out a box, with NO chemicals, just pure ingredients. Fabulous."
"0","5","Made these last night and they were delicious. Followed the directions except for adding 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. Turned out great. They were most delicious while warm. We ate them cold as we'll but they seemed a little more dry after a few hours. Will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","excellent brownie! These were great and everyone loved them. I especially like that it is so easy to make them, it took no time at all. Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","5","These were amazing! I had to bring something to work and need to make more, so I doubled the recipe and I omitted the frosting because I didn't have all the ingredients. Everyone raved about them, and the batter was so good, I was licking the bowl like a kid. Thanks so much!"
"0","5","I liked these a lot. I can't say it was my absolute favourite recipe in the world, but the brownies were VERY good and th recipe was super simple. I made the recipe as instructed except for two things. I used oil instead of butter because we were low on butter and I used a 9x9 pan (because that is what I have) and baked the brownies for 20 minutes instead of 25 since the larger pan resulted in a thinner layer of brownies. The result was a moist, fudgy, slightly chewy brownie. Very tasty! If you like hard, chewy brownies, this may not be your favourite recipe. But if you like moist, fudgy brownies I would give this a try. Because it is so good and so darn easy to make I will add it to my favourites. I can make it whenever I need to whip up a tasty treat quickly."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! I baked it just as directed. One note: I didn't use real butter (didn't have any) so I used that margarine/vegetable spread that comes in sticks (imperial brand 53% veg. Oil spread) and it turned out great. I used a glass 8x8 pan and baked it for 26 minutes. It came out nice and uniform with a surface that looked as though it had bubbles on it. The frosting however did not come together as it should have when made as directed. It was powdery. So to fix I added a SMALL splash of milk. I recommend making small splashes until you get that frosting consistency that you want. The frosting was still delicious! The brownies also taste great without the frosting. I'm definately making this again!!"
"0","4","Loved these brownies, and they smelled amazing while cooking! My oven is a little weird and cooks everything faster, so I only baked these for 23 minutes!!"
"0","1","These brownies were TERRIBLE! Bitter, flat..."
"0","5","This recipe is amazing. Definitely the best brownies I've ever made. The only tip i have is to not mix with a beater, this will make the brownies to cakey. If you hand mix then these brownies come out perfect."
"0","5","Simply AMAZING! We made the recipe in a batch in a half in a 11x7 (2.2 qt) glass pan. Had to use semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of cocoa powder in frosting and it tasted great! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","4","Great recipe...only wish there was less sugar. May try using 3/4 amount of sugar listed next time. Made some changes, including using dark chocolate cocoa powder, subbing out applesauce for half of the butter, greasing w/ coconut oil, and 1/4 cup yogurt for one of the eggs. Baked for 30 mins, ended up more cake like, but delicious! Didn't use the frosting.  Will make again definitely!"
"0","4","These were good but not the very best texture I suppose."
"0","5","These are amazing- Better than from the bakery. I didn't have a square dish so used a small rectangular 8x11 one and doubled the recipe. They came out thicker than the photo of course. I didn't mix or 'beat' anything and they were not cakey at all, just moist and chewy! Cut the powdered sugar in half for the frosting- it was super easy. Will make again!"
"0","3","I thought these brownies were good. They are cakey. I didn't have honey for the frosting so I used maple syrup, it was just ok. Mine were done in 20 minutes."
"0","3","Ok. This brownie was really good (the best my mother has ever had), but I cheated a lot. I used this recipe as a guide rather than exactly as written. Due to all the changes I had made to get the resulting brownie, I only gave this recipe 3 stars. I can imagine the brownie created by the original recipe would have a nice texture, but not be as deep in flavor.   I have a dairy allergy so I changed the recipe. The changes I made are as follows:  -1/2 cup of shortening vs 1/2 a cup of butter -added 1/2 tsp of butter extract -melted 1/2 ounce of unsweetened baking chocolate into the shortening -mixed in about1/2 cup of milk chocolate chunks (these weren't dairy free, but a little milk won't kill me so I -decided to add them. If you have a severe milk allergy just substitute the chocolate chunks for some completely dairy free brownies. ;)) -I only baked them for 20 mins  The resulting brownie was absolutely the bees knees. It wasn't a thick brownie, but definitely had a good balance of chewiness and fudgeness, and had thin crisp top. I did not frost them as they were very rich and perfectly sweet on their own; however I could have frosted them and they would have been fine. As for the flavor they were very chocolatey and had a depth of flavor added by the milk chocolate chunks. They were very good!!!The best my family has ever had!!!! Happy baking! :)"
"0","5","Better than boxed brownies! But no DO NOT overcook because you will get hard brownies."
"0","5","Loved it! Never knew made from scratch brownies were so easy. These are absolutely fantastic :)"
"0","4","The only thing I changed was to add 3/4 c walnut pieces. I baked it in an 8x8 pan as the recipe says but the middle took forever to set. I took it out after half an hour and the center still looked liquid but I figured it would set up as it cooled. 15 minutes later I checked and it was still battery! I put it back in the oven for another five minutes and it still didn't set. Finally I turned off the oven but left the pan inside until the middle set up a bit. I'm not sure what happened--I bake a lot and haven't had this trouble before--but next time I'll use a 9x9 pan instead and hopefully that will do the trick. All that aside, these brownies are really good!"
"0","5","I just made these tonight and the kids and I loved them! Changes I made: I doubled the recipe for a 13X9 pan, used 3 eggs, added a tablespoon of coffee extract in addition to the vanilla, added an extra 1\4 cup sugar. Also, instead of frosting, I sprinkled a massive amount of chocolate chips over the top before putting in the oven. (about 35 minutes) They turned out wonderful!"
"0","5","Made a double batch in a 9x13, Baked them for 35 minutes, til the toothpick came out almost clean. Used only 3 eggs instead of 4. Added dark chocolate chips.They are delicious. Thank you for all the tips."
"0","4","Yummy flavor! You definitely need to double the recipe if you're making them for more than just a family of four. But otherwise, easy to follow and delicious."
"0","5","Absolutely DELICIOUS!! These brownies are bits of heaven. I followed the recipe to a t and it came out perfect. Fudgy and soft. Next time I'll definitely be adding some nuts."
"0","5","Hallelujah! I cooked these for 33 minutes because they looked wet in the middle at 30 min. Even though my pick came out clean I left them in a bit longer. I like kinda burnt brownie edges but in my glass pan I didn't get these, and that's unusual. You can really taste the butter in my opinion. Amazing. I didn't do the frosting but I know they'd taste great with with. They were the like a dense sponge. All I had on hand was dark cocoa so these were the blackest brownies I'd ever seen in my life. I think I'll keep making them that way to have a discussion topic at gatherings."
"0","5","Cure for any chocolate craving!! These were absolutely amazing. I added about a tablespoon of milk to the frosting to make it easier to spread. Perfect!!"
"0","5","These brownies are AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't say it enough! I only baked them for 24 minutes and that was perfect! Try these... just don't overcook!"
"0","5","Best brownies I've had in awhile!"
"0","5","Excellent and oh so easy to make. Instead of the frosting recipe that is included I just sprinkled chocolate chips over the brownies when they came out of the oven and spread the melted chocolate all over to create a simple frosting. My family gobbled them up. Next time I'm going to double the recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is wonderful! I followed the advice not to beat the mixture too much and the texture came out perfectly. I used my spatula and just gently folded the mixture until all the ingredients were incorporated. Will definitely be making it again."
"0","5","Delicious! I didn't have enough butter, so I threw in some oil with the butter I had to compensate. Still came out delicious! Frosting is super tasty, but may be too sweet for some. :)"
"0","4","Great, easy, seemed fool proof. I used dark chocolate and extra fancy salt in batter and frosting and they were very rich and decidant. Still moist the next day. I only used about half the frosting, just too much sweetness."
"0","5","Nothing will ever best my Mom's baking but at least I can get close with this recipe. My husband and son ate their brownie with vanilla ice cream! Thanks for a keeper recipe!"
"0","2","Too cakey. Still on the hunt for a fudgey brownie recipe with a crackled top & crispy edges."
"0","5","Didn't make the frosting, either and put 2 HEAPING/3 of a cup of cocoa and they're delicious!!! I can't believe anyone said these were bad. I don't think they made them right. They were MOIST! Took 3/4 of them to work and everything is GONE."
"0","5","Loved it! Used Ghirardelli cocoa powder, so delicious. Never making boxed brownies again! Did not make the frosting and they were perfectly good without it!"
"0","5","It's the best brownie recipe I found so far!! Thanks Angie!"
"0","5","These are the best homemade brownies I think I've ever tasted. They beat the store box mixes hands down.   I read a lot of the reviews and took their advice (along with my own ideas):  I followed the recipe except that I used a 9-inch square pan lined with parchment paper I cut to fit the bottom and sides of the pan and sprayed some nonstick spray (no flour) on the parchment paper. I melted the butter on the stove and set it aside as soon as it had melted to let it completely cool. In a large bowl, I whisked together the sugar, cocoa, flour, salt, and baking powder. After the butter had completely cooled, I LIGHTLY whisked together the butter, eggs and vanilla just enough to make sure the ingredients were combined. I poured these wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and GENTLY stirred and folded the ingredients together 50 strokes making sure no dry ingredients were left unmixed at the bottom of the bowl. I baked the brownies for only 25 minutes. After 15 minutes out of the oven, I lifted the brownies out of the pan using the parchment paper as handles and placed them on a cooling rack to cool completely. They came out perfectly! They were the texture of brownies, not fudgey and not cakey. They are addicting. I think that if you follow what I did, your brownies will come out right. I did not make any frosting because I didn't want them to be too sweet. They are great without the frosting. Thanks Angie for sharing your recipe with us."
"0","3","The brownies turned out flat but tasted good. The mix was runnier than in the video. I may try them again with a lower oven setting and add a little more flour if it's runny again."
"0","5","These are awesome!i will never buy store bought brownies again!"
"0","5","AMAZING! Will now be my primary brownie recipe... followed it to a T, and came out perfect."
"0","4","Good, but not the best. And not really what I think of as brownies either in appearance, texture, or taste."
"0","5","Great recipe! I didn't make the frosting, but they were delicious anyway. Much better than using a store bought mix."
"0","5","Extremely rich but absolutely amazing"
"0","5","This makes, a rich, fudgey brownie that melts in your mouth. I made a couple batches for my students, then had to make a third batch for the home-folk. I don't even like brownies and I had multiple servings. (The batter before you add the flour is exquisite too.) They are quite rich though. I definitely needed a glass of milk to accompany them."
"0","5","Very good! Kids loved them."
"0","3","a thick cake-like brownie."
"0","5","Great brownies. No need for frosting! This recipe is going in my collection."
"0","5","i didn't use the frosting because i don't like frosting on brownies but i LOVED your recipe! It came out perfectly the first time! i used a cake pop pan and i made little brownie bites. they were so delicious!"
"0","4","This is a delicious chocolate cake recipe. Did not come out brownieish at all. Still yummy."
"0","5","Very good"
"0","5","These brownies turned out great, made twice for a party, everyone loved them!"
"0","5","Dear sweet baby Moses...I can not express enough how amazing these brownies are! And I didnt even make the frosting! I am not a great cook, at all (I burnt instant oatmeal once, no joke) But these are so easy and quick to make and leaves you wanting to eat the whole batch all alone. The texture was the PERFECT brownie texture. Soft, chewy, amazing."
"0","5","Every time I make these I get tons of compliments and they run out almost immediately (no matter how many batches I make). Like a lot of the other reviews recommended, I found stirring by hand to yield the best results. I also add chocolate chips to the recipe and no one has ever complained...chocolate chips never made anything worse! Never made the frosting it mentions because I feel it would just be too much, the brownies stand alone- the frosting would just be a distraction in my opinion. Overall, magnificent!"
"0","5","Excellent brownie recipe (I didn't make the frosting). I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and baked the recipe in muffin cups/muffin tin to make individual brownies (I reduced the baking time to 15-20 minutes; the recipe makes enough for 10-12 muffin cups half filled). THANK YOU!"
"0","5","very good brownies and easy to make thank you awesome"
"0","5","It was easy to make and the brownies are better than any box mix you can find at a store."
"0","2","I cooked only 22 minutes and it still turned out like cake"
"0","5","Loved them!Great for serving to friends!Definitely using this recipe again!"
"0","3","These cook beautifully & are more of a cake brownie. This is also a true 8x8 pan recipe. However, Ghirardelli has a better tasting box mix. The coco blend is just not rich enough. These brownies are more on the bland side & need a good frosting to give them some flavor because alone they're not worth the calories. I'm not into doctoring a recipe 5 times when I can by a box for a few dollars & get it right every time. Disappointed in the flavor."
"0","5","I made these while trying to stay away from sugar. Silly me. I couldn't keep my hands out of it. I didn't frost only ½ of them at first but once I tried it with the frosting, I was addicted. They are nice and easy to make. My family loved them!!"
"0","5","This recipe was amazing! Thank you for sharing. I added 150g chopped chocolate and 50g walnuts to the mix, turned out perfect. Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","These brownies truly are the best! I have been making them for 4 years now and they ALWAYS impress. Please don't listen to the critical review where she says they're 'cake squares', something must have not turned out right for that poor child. The secret, like everyone else says, is to not overbake or overmix. Also, if you like yours particularly fudgy then only bake 25mins and refrigerate overnight. OMG!  Recently, I added frozen organic dark chocolate chunks to the batter before baking and when done, I put walnuts on top the frosting then refrigerated. They were so fudgy and flavorful plus the chocolate added a nice texture and taste. I will def make them again this way."
"0","5","Fabulous! Made just as directed, except melted the butter for the frosting. I will never buy boxed mix again."
"0","5","I have tried others recipe but this brownies is so nice. My colleagues love i and this is in my favorites list."
"0","5","These are the best brownies. The directions and reviews are right. 25 minutes was perfect. I added nuts and chocolate chips. There was no need for the chocolate chips the brownie was already super chocolate, but it never hurts to have more. The frosting is a bit tuff to work with adding 2 tbl spoons of milk made it a great consistency and frosting while they were warm made the frosting even better"
"0","5","Belicious as my grandson says"
"0","4","I use a recipe that's very similar, only I use oil instead of butter and only one egg, which makes the brownies more fudgy and less cakey. I also use 1/4 tsp. baking soda instead of baking powder and no frosting to cut down on calories!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice, and both times it came out so yummy!! The second time was the first I tried with the icing and my kids and I loved it even more! I made the brownies exactly how the recipe says, never had a problem. The icing was tweaked just a bit only because I don't keep honey in my cabinets. Instead of honey I used about 2 teaspoons of milk and it was still great."
"0","5","Made this last night and loved it!!! i followed the directions and didn't change or add anything to it. Next time i make it i will add chocolate chuncks to it. Perfect!!!!"
"0","5","Very nice. Do not over bake. They seem uncooked but are perfect pulled out of the oven on time. Today is my 4th batch, they are great brownies and easier each time I make them. I added double the flour accidentally once when rushing and realized it during baking, I put handful plus chocolate chips on top, they sunk in a little and the family liked this batch better, it was denser with chocolate and yummy - so that mistake was saved. I suggest trying them more than once if at first they don't seem great. I do add choc chips on top prior to putting them in the oven now, Just a handful, I sprinkle them on, they are sunk in when done. The icing is good, I put that on when warm as suggested. Thank you"
"0","4","First time I made Brownies without a store bought box. They were tasty and very easy to make. Next time I will make double, but use same size pan, for a thicker treat."
"0","5","I made an account just to make this suggestion: if you're craving brownies, but don't have time (or don't want to) make an entire batch, then you want a brownie in a mug. You may have heard of this before, but if you change the serving size to 2 servings on this recipe, it is better than ANY brownie in a mug recipe I've EVER made.   I also made the full pan, and they were wonderful."
"0","5","Title doesn't lie, these are the BEST brownies. Everyone seems to agree so I always double the batch. I'm too lazy to make the frosting (I don't think they need it really) and no one even notices it's missing anyway. I also love who it's made in just one pan, less clean up! (See earlier where I referenced being lazy)"
"0","5","Decided to have a bash after years of not making brownies and this recipe is a winner. I doubled the recipe as my baking tins are a little larger than the stipulate 8 inch. Lovely chocolate flavour and not too sweet (I omitted the frosting). Perhaps due to my oven and the high elevation of my location the 35 minutes cooking time was a tad too long and silly me thought that non stick cooking spray would suffice. Note to self......it doesn't. Take the time to grease and flour the tin as instructed. However none of that detracts from the awesome flavour and minimal effort. Now to figure out how to save some for hubby when he gets in from work........"
"0","5","This is truly the best brownie recipe EVER!!!!!!! I made soo many times and I made it gluten free but everybody complimented me on it! This is a great recipe."
"0","4","Childhood favorite."
"0","5","These were soooo good! I crave them all the time now! I made them without the frosting so can't comment on that but without they were perfect! I made sure not to overcook them at all (probably even under cooked them a tiny bit as they will continue to cook a bit in the pan). I will use this recipe anytime I NEED brownies! I do have to say for all the reviewers saying that these tasted like cake..you must have done something wrong, like overcooked them. Because these were nothing like cake! Fudgy and so brownie-like!"
"0","5","amazing…..makes a fairly small batch though. (maybe that's a good thing…I couldn't keep my hands off!"
"0","5","These really were the best brownies. I've never made brownies from scratch - always seemed like a mix would be easier. I'll never make that mistake again. I did melt the butter for the frosting and add a little milk to make it easier to spread. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","Good grief these are good!"
"0","5","These really are the best brownies. I've always wanted to make them so that they're not too dense like most brownies, but also not too airy and cake-like. This is a perfect blend of the two. Thick, and moist. For the frosting recipe, I substituted the honey for caramel, and also melted in a giant marshmallow to make it a gooey and rich frosting."
"0","5","Tried it, loved it, make it frequently :)"
"0","5","These brownies turned out great! I made a double batch without the frosting and they didn't last long. They were moist, and sweet, but not too sweet. Just right for my family. I'll be making more soon. Thanks for the recipe, it's perfcect for us and easy too."
"0","5","Perfection! I agree that you need to make sure you don't cook too long. Huge hit with the whole family!"
"0","5","best brownie recipe ever!!! it lives up to its name best brownies I made this for my family and even my kitten took a bite from the brownie she couldn't stop herself."
"0","5","Made this recipe and had them with ice cream. Will save in my recipes because they were so good and easy to make."
"0","5","Amazing"
"0","5","so easy to make. Frosting needed to have just a bit of water added to spread easily"
"0","5","Super easy!! I've made these brownies twice now and they're PERFECT!! I only bake them for 22 min. I've added marshmallows and walnuts to them and they still came out perfect!! I have not made the frosting yet...YET but I will next time!! Amazing brownies!!!"
"0","5","They were the best I have made"
"0","4","Easy, quick - my boys devoured them. Beat the eggs beforehand and gently mixed with a spoon (as suggested by others). Great stuff!"
"0","5","These were amazing!! I made them exactly as the recipe called except I used my 'Perfect Brownie' pan which is longer than a square pan. They came out thin, but with the frosting were still soft and chewy and PERFECT. No reason to buy a mix anymore."
"0","5","Amazing! Better than out of a box! I made without the frosting (they don't need it). I also had to use an 8'x11' pan b/c I didn't have an 8' square (weighed and divided by 16 when they were done, to get equal servings). Didn't beat, just stirred slowly and thoroughly (melted butter in a glass bowl in the microwave so I didn't have to dirty a pot)."
"0","5","These brownies were absolutely amazing! I loved them so much I made them twice. If your in my family you need to make them the day you want them eaten! One tip, you should gently beat the eggs before adding them into the mixture. Ps. I'm only nine years old and they still came out perfectly so you really should make these brownies!"
"0","5","Made a batch in the morning and took them to work that afternoon. They were a BIG hit. Got people on the waiting list for the next batch. I set the timer for 25 minutes....smelled them over cooking way before that. Next time I will cook them for 20 minutes in the top of the oven. I plan on adding chocolate chips to make them even more chocolaty. The frosting added extra richness. I will double the batch to bring chocolaty joy to more people."
"0","5","I love this recipe. So easy. Only takes a few minutes to put together. Very chocolatey. I add a tablespoon of instant coffee and chopped up chocolate. Thanks!"
"0","4","Super-simple recipe. As others have mentioned, there is little clean-up. I mixed it all into the cooling pan after the butter-melting stage. I could see then that this recipe did not make a ton of batter, so expect the brownies to be 'short' (pic. above is accurate), at about 1.5 centimeters tall.   Being tired of store mixes that are too sweet and not cocoa-y enough, I lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup and bumped up the cocoa by 50% (an extra 1/6 cup) and used Special Dark cocoa. They came out nearly pitch black and were rich in flavor. I skipped the frosting b/c I've never understood the desire to frost already inherently sweet brownies. Great as is!"
"0","5","THESE BROWNIES ROCK MY WORLD!!! Not too thick, light, not too fudgy or moist, palate perfection!!When they say these are the BEST they mean it!"
"0","5","Make these and they came out perfect! My new fav! My husband loves fudgy brownies; he even did a little dance! Thanks"
"0","5","THE BEST BROWNIE RECIPE EVER!!!! This is the absolute easiest brownie recipe. I made these brownies for the first time on New Years Eve with my kids and we were instantly hooked! These are my kids new favorite dessert. The recipe is so easy to me make that my 9 year old can literally make these brownies herself!"
"0","3","I made the recipe as directed except that I used agave instead of sugar. Perhaps that is what I did wrong because the brownies came out like thin sponges with little flavor."
"0","4","These brownies are great! I doubled my recipe, but discovered that I didn't have enough eggs. I substituted 1 tablespoon vegetable oil + 1/2 cup milk for each egg I was missing and they still came out perfect.  I used a single serving about of the frosting. It gave the brownies a nice layer of frosting with none left over [I used a 13x9 inch baking pan]."
"0","5","Delicious and easy...can't ask for much more than that."
"0","5","Delicious! Didn't chance a thing!!"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","This recipe works every time. We have friends who come round just to eat these."
"0","4","Made this using Special Dark cocoa, sifted the flour, and iced while hot. Loosen the sides and poke a few pin holes before icing while hot. Very good, chewy brownie. The Special Dark didn't make it bitter at all, just very rich."
"0","5","Great brownies, my frosting didn't turn out but the brownie itself still amazing!"
"0","5","This was the best brownie recipe I tried. Although I admit the first time I used it, I didn't have enough cocoa powder (I doubled the recipe). I melted in some chocolate chips (and added a spoonful of hot chocolate powder). Turned out great! My most successful baking attempt. I also added in some chopped walnuts."
"0","5","Easy and scrumptious. Can't believe I made these from scratch. The icing looks like its not going to work at first but just keep stirring and it comes together like you wouldn't believe. So good!"
"0","3","Ok, I LOVED the brownies, I make them a couple of times each year. I have NEVER been able to get the frosting to come out right, and I've tried several times. I usually end up with chocolate play-doh."
"0","3","The frosting was awful- which is why this is only 3 stars. It is way too crumbly and does not mix well. Some other reviews recommended adding some milk so maybe that might work. Had to make the brownies again. Other than that, good and simple to make!"
"0","5","I have added much less sugar. They turn out so sweet and moist anyways!"
"0","5","Great brownie-really easy and brownies were nice and fudgy."
"0","4","These came out really good. With only a half a cup of flour, I should have realized that there wasn't going to be much brownies, so next time, double up the recipe."
"0","5","This is the second time I'm rating this recipe. Two words. TOO GOOD. I lessen the sugar by 1-2 tablespoons and upped the cocoa powder by 1 tablespoon. We packaged these brownies to small gift bags and sold them in school on Valentine's Day. Everyone loved it! :D the texture is perfect. Fudgy, a little chewy, but not cakey at all. Right amount of sweetness, lovely little brownie! :D so glad I found this recipe. Baked this in a convection oven for exactly 25 minutes. Perfection in a brownie :) yum yum! Easy, quick and delicious recipe! Will make this time and time again!"
"0","5","Just made it for my girlfriend for Valentines day. Added some white chocolate chips in the batter and sprinkled a few on top. Yum!!"
"0","5","These brownies are EXCELLENT. easy, quick, gooey and tasty."
"0","5","Yummy! They were great, but almost too rich for us. We enjoyed them, but actually like 'Brooke's Bombshell Brownies' a little better for the richness factor. I followed others' advise to mix by hand so it didn't get over-mixed. The batter ended up bubbly, but they still turned out fine and fudgy! I skipped the frosting and just used a sprinkle of powder sugar on the tops."
"0","4","Good and easy, a little too cake-like for me."
"0","5","I made these without the frosting, and I added some white and dark chocolate chips that I had laying around to the batter. I got so many compliments on them and they were gone within a day!"
"0","4","Its very cake like. I will make again. Next time I will use just one egg."
"0","5","perfect for making a quick dessert!"
"0","5","So easy and good."
"0","5","THIS IS TRULY THE BEST BROWNIE RECIPE EVER!!! doubled the recipe for a super-bowl party, added 1 cup chocolate chips, and skipped the frosting, they were gone in minutes! super easy too! thanks for sharing Angie!"
"0","5","I add pecans then just gobble these down. They are right, these brownies ALWAYS turn out!"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome! Tried them on a whim. So simple and easy to make, I already had all the I ingredients. My whole family loved it. I also made the frosting, great too! I will make these again and again."
"0","5","Yummy yummy yummy...that's all I can say!!!"
"0","5","Delicious! I'm the cook in the household and my wife is the baker. Today I was the cook and the baker.  I'm pretty inexperienced with desserts so wanted something simple. Wow! Great brownies! My wife and kids loved them.  I found the frosting to be a little too dry so I added a touch of milk to the mixture and it turned out beautifully."
"0","5","awesome frosting!"
"0","5","Great recipe using cocoa! I didn't have enough cocoa for the frosting, so just sprinkled powder sugar and they were wonderful! Doubled and made 9x13"
"0","5","One word...awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and baked in a 9X13 pan. The only thing I did differently was instead of the frosting, I swirled in caramel (I used apple dip caramel) and they are the perfect amount of soft and chewy. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Just made these delicious brownies they are to die for!!! Yum-O"
"0","5","These are awesome! I read the comments that said these are more cake-like brownies. I prefer fudgy brownies, so I made a few changes to the original recipe for baking in an 8 x 8 pan: I used an extra tablespoon of butter, used one egg and one egg yolk (beaten before adding to the butter), mixed by hand, and added half a bag of bittersweet chocolate chips to the batter before baking at 350 for exactly 25 minutes. They turned out super dense, somewhat thin/low, fudgy and chocolatey. I didn't bother with the frosting because they are amazing on their own! I am a serious chocoholic, so for me to omit the frosting means these are intense enough on their own (with the changes I made at least!). Enjoy!"
"0","5","Oh my, these brownies were the best ever! I will be doubling the batch next time!"
"0","4","It was too good. Thanks for the recipe :)"
"0","4","These were pretty good. I like a thicker brownie & these were on the thinner side. I iced one half with frosting & the other without, my husband & I preferred without frosting. The frosting seemed to take away from the brownie."
"0","5","perfect brownies! didnt change a thing about them except, even for an 8-inch square pan there wasn't much batter"
"0","5","Oh my goodness...where have you been all of my life!! My husband is a brownie addict, and he LOVES this recipe! I will never use another recipe for brownies again. I do add chopped walnuts, because he prefers them in his brownies. I have made these with and without the frosting, they are amazing both ways! Super simple, and if you follow the recipe and the directions, they have the perfect consistency! (At least in our opinion)! I have made these several times already, and they have never flopped yet!! :-)"
"0","5","These taste amazing! The inside is that dense fudgy brownie that I love. However the outside turned out bubbly looking and didn't have that crinkly top that brownies are suppose to have. Maybe I overmixed or something as this was my 1st time making brownies. I am definitely making these again."
"0","5","Amazing!!! I was a little hesitant at first to try this recipe because I haven't had the much luck with other homemade brownie recipes, but this is fantastic. It was cakey on the outside but so fudgy on the inside. My siblings said it tasted just like the box! I personally don't want to go back to the box now. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe and you sure killed my sweet tooth :)!"
"0","5","Before when I made brownies, they were just 'eh' but with this recipe, I take a bite and say 'wow!' Absolutely delicious"
"0","5","Amazing!"
"0","5","Actually, these are perfect. Not cake like at all. Anyone who says that is probably doing something wrong. I am crazy about brownies, went to culinary school, and honestly these are some of the best brownies I've ever had. If you are wondering if you should try this recipe, you should definitely do that! One thing I added though, was I sprinkled Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips on the top before I bake it."
"0","1","I followed the directions exactly. I didn't over stir and the brownies were very dry and cake like."
"0","5","I only use this recipe now. Everyone LOVES these! I have made with and without the frosting, and both are EXCELLENT."
"0","5","These are a family favorite! The only thing I do different is add about a teaspoon of milk to the frosting!"
"0","5","Hands down the best brownie, according to friends and family who just ate them. I was pleased with the compliments and managed to save a bite for myself. HOLY COW are they awesome! I made exactly as written, but used the user tip to hand mix and not OVER mix. The brownie was crunchy on the edges and moist inside. I did add in 1/3 cup of chocolate chips and baked them for the full 30 minutes. Wow wow wow are these great. And super fast/easy to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe! I will have to double it next time."
"0","5","AH-MA-ZING!!! So easy to make and was beyond delicious!!! Will definitely be making again."
"0","4","These were delicious- hard to not love brownies! But they were too sweet for me as written, believe it or not, and not quite chocolatey enough. They came out slightly dense and moist, a little chewy outside, lighter in color, and very buttery yummy flavor. Not the 'crackle top' dry top I usually see on brownies and like the photo- perhaps it's my oven, or that I added walnuts which may have had an effect. My eggs were very large as well-farm eggs- I will try the same recipe with less sugar and more cocoa powder to see if it's perfect for me- but very tasty."
"0","5","These were awesome! I added a bit more melted butter to the frosting to smooth it out a little since it was too thick. These are cakey. I normally prefer my brownies to be harder, but not this time. These were perfect. I did cook them a bit longer but that could bee an issue with my oven. Will make these again and again...."
"0","5","Wonderful! These were very good. You can definitely taste the honey in the frosting. I doubled the recipe and they turned out great! I will be making these again for sure!"
"0","5","Easy and WAY better than a box mix. I usually keep a box mix on hand just in case I need to bring a dessert somewhere. I did not this past weekend and looked at my ingredients and had everything needed to make these - very basic ingredients. I also read someone else's review about adding 1/2 tsp more vanilla and add chocolate chips at the end -- great suggestion. Also, it doesn't need the frosting - we didn't try it. Everyone raved over them!"
"0","5","Loved it! This is (hands down) the perfect 'from scratch' chewy brownie recipe I've ever made for my family(one who is NOT a chocolate lover was looking for seconds). I chose not to make the frosting so we can use it again warmed with ice cream on top and fudge over top. Excellent choice!"
"0","1","We made this recipe and the batter worked out but the frosting was clumpy and thick. It wasn't suitable to put on anything. We added milk and it became an actual glaze suitable for anything."
"0","5","I love the recipe. Of course, I changed the cocoa. I used 1-T. dark cocoa with the regular cocoa. The frosting did not work for me at all, but this recipe does not need it. It is perfect with just a little powered sugar on top."
"0","5","I made this exactly as written for the brownies, but I had to modify the frosting (more on that in a minute), and they were delicious!!! Even with the frosting, they aren't super sweet, but they are so rich at the same time! I halved the frosting because I was serving them to family who aren't crazy about sweets. While I was trying to mix it up, it was just really clumpy and dry- I couldn't get it smooth. I added a splash of water to make it spreadable. Maybe it would have melted and spread on the warm brownies without the water... It turned out as a nice shiny glaze! Next time I make these, I may add coffee to the frosting...and garnish with a few pecans!"
"0","5","I was disappointed with the quality of store bought box mixes so I searched for a scratch recipe when I came across this one....awesome! They were moist and chewy and great chocolate flavor. I added some chopped pecans (after I lightly toasted them) this recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","I have made these brownies several times. I have followed the recipe exactly, but I frosted mine with peanut butter frosting. These brownies never disappoint. Thank you for a wonderful family easy friendly recipe."
"0","5","I never really cared for brownies... until I had these. My only complaint is that I can't stop eating them!"
"0","5","Made it exactly per the recipe, and everyone loved it. My 6-year-old granddaughter, who Googled this recipe, said, 'Grandmama, these really ARE the best brownies!'"
"0","5","I whipped these up ,super quick, the other night. Ate them almost as soon as they came out of oven ( probably should have let them cool longer as they still needed to set a bit). Oh my!!! Perfectly delicious and super easy. Making them tonight and adding crushed skor bits. Didn't make icing. Oh I forgot, I used a mixture of coconut oil and olive oil instead of butter, it's what I had.  I have since made these exactly as recipe states, and they are delicious. One time they turned out cakey, but maybe I over mixed, because every other time, they have been chewy. Even my brother inlaw has asked for the recipe."
"0","5","Delicious and gooey! I will never buy brownie mix again! Very easy to make and I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13."
"0","4","right along with everyone else I have to say I don't know how the author managed to make icing with the ingredients listed - there was not enough liquid to even combine the ingredients. I added a smidge of boiling water, mixed like crazy then a slop of milk, mixed and the icing came out much better. The actual brownie recipe is great. Seems to have worked a treat and the kids were drooling in front of the oven before they even came out! I'll use it again :)"
"0","5","Great recipe and super easy. But doubled the recipe, used coconut oil to replace the butter, and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular sugar. Turned out just right, similar to box recipes. And try coconut oil to sub butter in any recipe, makes any recipe better (does not taste or smell like coconut)."
"0","5","Easy to make and was hit with my children! Thanks"
"0","5","These brownies are seriously unreal! like....the best ever! the only thing I change is I use coconut oil instead of butter & add reese's peices cuz thats my thing with brownies :) but seriously...these are absolutely magnificent!!!"
"0","5","Oh em gee is all I have to say. I wanted a chocolate fix and was out of everything. So I tried these. I double the recipe Yum. :). I didn't use the frosting here as I used peanut butter instead."
"0","5","These are the perfect brownies! I disagree with the review that called them cake-like. If you eat them right away, they can be cake-like, like any brownie. If you let them sit overnight, they are dense and fudge-y the next day. Don't worry about beating in ingredients, I hand-mixed them with a wooden spoon and everything came out fine. These don't make very many, it says 16 brownies in an 8x8 pan, but I like a big brownie, so more like 8-10 for me! They aren't very thick either, so double the recipe if you're planning desert for the family for a few nights."
"0","5","These brownies are super easy to make, and taste delicious! It isn't really a cake brownie or a fudge brownie, it's a little of both. I'll probably double it next time because it doesn't make a lot of batter. I used a cookie sheet that has a little bit of depth and spread it out on that since I like my brownies thinner, it took about 25 minutes. Even thin the brownies were really moist. I didn't make the topping for them but I sifted powdered sugar on top and it looked and tasted great. I will defiantly use this recipe again."
"0","5","My batch of brownies came out so delicious! Super rich and semi chewy."
"0","5","I love that it can all be made in one pot!"
"0","1","Followed the recipe exactly, didn't over mix or overcook, but these aren't so much brownies as they are cake. Decent cake, but definitely not brownies."
"0","5","Easy and so delicious! I added peppermint flakes and yummy!!"
"0","5","This recipe was AMAZING! Anyone who says otherwise obviously has baking issues."
"0","5","These are really good! I made them in a mini-muffin tray and they came out great! Just bake for 12-18 minutes and, yum."
"0","5","Delicious! I made this for my family and it was devoured! I added a couple drops of peppermint extract, and about 3 tablespoons ground (ceylon) cinnamon. I also put walnuts in it. I sprinkled powdered sugar and more cinnamon on the top. Pure indulgence!"
"0","5","These brownies are out of the world! It melts in your mouth!! I followed the directions to the T and it turned out fabulous!! I Whipped the eggs before adding to the mixture and the brownies turned out perfect ... Not too cakey nor mushy!"
"0","5","This is a GREAT recipe!!!"
"0","5","This recipe was very easy to prepare with few ingredients and easy cleanup. They smelled delicious and I could barely wait to dig in... I didn't wait until they were completely cool and they seemed cakey.  Once cooled, the edge had a slight crunch with a moist chewy brownie. They were awesome! I didn't add the frosting but followed the recipe 100%. Cooked just slightly less than 30 minutes because I didn't want to overcook. :)"
"0","5","THis recipe is super! I altered it a little bit by doubling the recipe (I used a 13x9 pan) and not using electric beaters-- this helps to make the brownies less cake-like. I also added half a cup of chocolate chips into the batter and then half a cup sprinkled on top of brownies. I sprinkled sea salt on the top instead of the frosting, which gave it a great spin. So delicious."
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","These are so 'GOOD'!!! I would even say you don't need frosting for these just a cold glass a milk."
"0","4","VERY easy recipe. The brownies turned out pretty good. I cooked them for 22 minutes and they were cooked perfectly. I would recommend these for beginners, or someone who just wants a quick treat. I would not take these brownies to a bake sale, or anything like that, but for a weeknight treat, they were great. Oh- I did not make the frosting. They were plenty sweet without it."
"0","5","Great recipe. I made it without frosting and it tasted perfect."
"0","5","This is an amazing and extremely simple recipe. I'll never buy boxed again. Absolutely perfect. Be sure to hand mix them."
"0","5","Amazing!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","My family loves these"
"0","2","first of all, proper mixing methods are not described in this recipe and definitely contributed to my problems... I followed the recipe and the texture was off(large bubbles on top and throughout) likely because the recipe doesn't have you mix all the dry ingredients before putting them in with the wet. Even without the un-evenness, the texture isn't my favorite, because, as someone else mentioned, these are very cakelike brownies. I also followed instructions on the frosting and the first attempt turned into crumbs (because it doesn't tell you to soften the butter, then whip it, then GRADUALLY add in the powdered sugar/cocoa powder--which i would mix together first-- and then alternate adding powdered sugar with wet ingredients). I was able to 'salvage' the frosting but even so it tasted like nothing but powdered sugar and vanilla - YUCK (most of the time i make frosting, I use 1/8th tsp vanilla for a much bigger batch of vanilla frosting but I followed this recipe because I thought the cocoa might necessitate adding more). I even tried adding some metled bittersweet chocolate and that did nothing to fix the flavor. I put some buttersotch chips and shaved bittersweet chocolate on top and let them melt and spread that around for frosting."
"0","5","These brownies are the best! Perfect texture!"
"0","5","These brownies are fantastic!! They are the perfect consistency...fudgy, but not too dense, rich, yet a delicate crumb. I added some walnuts and chopped Callebaut dark chocolate. I didn't have the ingredients for the frosting so I added the nuts and chocolate to make up for it. My only problem is that I can't stop eating them!"
"0","1","Despite following the recipe, they tasted slightly sour. I also put the oven temp below 350 just in case, and they came out burned on the outside, but almost completely raw on the inside! I'm NOT going to use this recipe again."
"0","5","Very good. No frosting. Made exactly as recipe calls for, but used cocoa to dust pan. Did add walnuts. Excellent results with on-hand ingredients."
"0","5","Been making these for a while and they always turn out right! The people who described them as 'cake-like' obviously over-mixed, causing the egg in the batter to become fluffy, resulting in cake-like brownies. All in all, these brownies were the best I've ever had and they are a hit every time I make them. I don't even bother making the frosting as they are absolutely divine without. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Pretty easy and they disappeared so fast!"
"0","5","Just made these and they are great if you like more of a cake brownie. They are very choclatey and I added nuts...Doubled the recipe making about 20 nice sized brownie....I really like the recipe and it is fast.You have something chocolate in about 30 min...cook for twenty 25 and they would probably turn out a little chewier.....  Thumbs up...."
"0","5","So Incredibly good!!"
"0","5","We have made this recipe many many times. We have not made any other brownie recipe since finding this one, it is perfect! I have never tried it with the icing because I am not into icing, but my daughters have tried it. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","Very nice brownie"
"0","5","Are you kidding me? So what if it's cakey, 'cause they are still delicious.   Hello people. I tried making it again except now i followed the steps exactly. I used unsalted butter. I say it's not that good. I recommend using salted! Darn in. I like my first batch. (• 0 •)9"
"0","4","taste good but hard to get out of pan (i had greased it) they were chewy, maybe ill bake longer next time. i did 27mins this time."
"0","1","I've found these too sweet and lacking in chocolate taste. Turn out chewy."
"0","5","I doubled the recipe but followed instructions to a t and got excellent results. Great recipe!"
"0","4","It was pretty go and easy.I added chopped up bakers cho. to my mixture just before pouring into the pan. My mom really liked it. I thought it was missing a lil something but will def. make it again. I did not make the frosting to much sweetness for me."
"0","5","SO glad I gave these a second try!! These really are the BEST! The first time they were not great . . . I doubled them and made them with the icing (who can ever just make an 8x8 pan of brownies?? Would barely last a day in this house of 5). This time I read some of the reviews and took the advice of the person who said when doubling the recipe to only add one extra egg, that made ALL the difference. The extra egg made them cakey the first time. Also, the icing is just overkill, they are perfect without it, and the icing is not very good, kind of ruined them for me."
"0","5","WOW! These really fantastic. Frosting tastes like it's from a bakery."
"0","5","My husband asked why I've been buying boxed brownie mixes. These are amazing!"
"0","5","the best"
"0","5","These have been my 'go to' pregnancy brownies, because I'm a health nut and refuse to buy packaged foods yet live in a rural area where late night sweeties are unavailable to the desperate. I just whip up a batch of these and they are awesome. I usually add a little extra salt because I like a savory/sweet combo but other than that these are perfect. Doubles easily for use with a 9x13"
"0","5","Great! I did not make the frosting. It was easy my four year old daughter helped me make it. It tasted a lot better then any box mix. One thing I will say is don't use equal or any artificial sweetners. As they contain aspertame a harmful additive. It may cut calories but aspertame is more harmful then a few extra calories."
"0","5","I will never buy brownie mix again. This recipe is so easy and they are delicious!"
"0","5","This is really...really...best brownies !!! I love it !!!!"
"0","4","These brownies are amazing! I have made them for several occasions and each time they are delicious. The only problem with the recipe is the frosting. It does not have enough liquid so I add 6-8 tbs of water when I am done and it turns into this beautiful shiny chocolate that is PERFECT in top of the brownies!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious and I didn't even make the frosting! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 13x9 pan for thirty minutes. A great dessert or winter-time snack."
"0","5","Delicious and so easy to make if you are looking for a quick dessert. I am sure the frosting is good but I skipped it and the brownies were in no way lacking without it."
"0","5","Thought these brownies were excellent and followed the recipe!..With the frosting though i had to add just a bit up water to get it to turn to frosting. otherwise it was just dry"
"0","5","I loved it! Soft and chewy brownie, just perfect! But I've got one more thing to say, why does everyone on allrecipes hate boxed mixes?! I mean they are perfectly fine. I'ts like hearing,'Don't ever reach for a boxed mix again!' or 'You won't ever need boxed mix ever again!' What's so bad about boxed mixes? Can someone please tell me?"
"0","5","Awesome...the only thing I changed was added some walnuts. As other reviewers stated, I mixed by hand and was careful to only bake 25 minutes."
"0","2","I wasn't a fan of not adding real chocolate and just using cocoa I usually use another recipe but could not find it and used this one instead. I brought the brownies to a dinner party and no one said anything and they were okay it just wasn't up to my standard of good..."
"0","5","I made the recipe for the brownies only and found this to be a winner. Much better than store bought boxes and very simple to make. This will be my go to recipe for a quick dessert. Thanks Angie!"
"0","5","Simple recipe. Fabulous results. Unanimously liked. What more could you ask?"
"0","5","I've made this tons of times, every time I can't resist going for seconds and thirds."
"0","1","These are terrible. Dry, not sweet. Cakey. Did them by hand. Exactly to recipe, they're terrible. Sorry."
"0","4","I followed every step exactly like ut says the brownies tasted really good but thet were nit fudgy or caky they were hard"
"0","2","The brownies get 3/5 stars. Not much flavor.  The frosting was so dry it was unusable. Do not waste the effort making the frosting. I took off another star for that."
"0","5","This is a great easy recipe. Even my son make it!!"
"0","5","I make these using the traditional creaming method, which produces a cake-like brownie. I have made these on several occasions now, and have been a hit every single time. I have not used the frosting recipe provided. On one occasion, I substituted the cocoa powder for flour, and added an additional 1tsp vanilla, and tossed in chocolate chips to make blondies."
"0","2","This is not a good recipe. Exceptionally dry. Needed a glass of water to wash it down. I should have known better but the reviews were rapturous. I don't have good experience with recipes that call for melted butter and I prefer brownie recipes with chocolate as opposed to cocoa powder. I always use fresh, quality ingredients and I am an experienced baker. I know my baking pans and my oven and have good technique. I mixed by hand and whipped the eggs before adding. I know what I am doing. Not a satisfying brownie. But The frosting was good, however."
"0","5","Doubled the recipe and used a 9 X 13 pan and they turned out great. Everyone at the Christmas Party loved them. Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","My go to brownie recipe"
"0","5","My 12 yr old daughter made these and they were THE BEST brownies I've ever had. They are moist and yummy! The icing that goes on top will be THE ONLY recipe I ever use again for chocolate frosting. It would be great on cupcakes, cookies, or even graham crackers. The brownies were easy to make, without a lot of fuss! Now I just wish I would have made her make a double batch!!"
"0","5","Made it exactly as specified and OMG in my list forever. NOTE: Please stop rating recipes that you guys have altered. It is not fair to the author nor the other reviewers. Thanks :D"
"0","5","Great chewy, fudgy brownie that's also easy! Worked fine at high altitude (3800'). They're plenty rich, so I haven't frosted them. I cut them small, put 2 per baggie & froze them so I wouldn't keep eating them (they're addicting!) These aren't the 'wet', fudgy type, but a nice balance of moist cake - hard to describe. I will make them again!"
"0","4","This recipe was great, except it was a little too sweet for my family. We loved everything else about this! The crust came out perfectly, the inside was fudgy, BUT the baking took more than 40 minutes. When I tested it at 30 it was still wet and far from finished. Otherwise great taste and texture, I'd probably put only 80% of the sugar you have mentioned. Thanks for putting my cocoa powder to good use!"
"0","5","Following the recipe, It was easy to make and results were delicious. My variation was to add dried cranberries for a bit of tangy taste."
"0","5","the best"
"0","4","Yummy brownies. Very cake-like. I prefer brownies to be chewier, but this was still very good. The icing was awesome."
"0","5","Soooo good :)"
"0","5","Oh, yes! These are really that good!! I double the recipe (but only use 3 eggs) and put them into a 9X13 pan. Perfection! But seriously, I do have to laugh at the original directions that states you get 16 servings from an 8X8 pan. Um . . . what?? I know this is to make the calorie count per brownie look good, but . . . lol Oh, and don't forget, the key to perfectly cut brownies is to cool them completely then use a plastic knife to cut them. Perfect every time!"
"0","5","This is a really easy and convenient recipe with good results. Since I am not much of a baker, I was apprehensive initially of making brownies from scratch. I did realize a few things over time - a few reviewers recommended that the brownies needed to be baked for only 25 minutes, however, that depends on one's oven (28 minutes for mine).   Also, when I greased and floured the pan, initially I only used unsweetend cocoa powder. However, I did not really like the additional flavor that cocoa imparted to the brownies. So, over time, I have come to use a mix of 1 tsp all purpose flour and 1/2 tsp cocoa powder that is mixed well (so as to prevent streaks of white) and sifted onto the greased pan. Since this is a forgiving recipe, I just add the remaining powder (if any) into the dry mix.   Lastly, the first time I tried this, I mixed all the ingredients and THEN prepared my pan. I guess that was a newbie mistake as the mix became quite thick and would not pour easily onto the pan."
"0","5","Recipe was awesome but I do not like honey so I used molasses instead and added coarse sea salt on top of the frosting with walnuts. Super awesome."
"0","5","I am a much better cook than I am a baker and this is a recipe people praise me for! I flour the bottom of my non-stick pan and I don't use a beater, just a wooden spoon. Comes out perfect every time!"
"0","5","This is the best brownie receipt, the only thing is I add chocolate chips to the mix and frosting, easy and awesome"
"0","1","I thought brownies were hard and chewy but this? These are cake squares"
"0","5","Great brownies very easy to bake and great for Thanksgiving. Frosting was a little thick but we added more butter and it worked well"
"0","1","to dry it's like eating dri coca powder it was disappointment"
"0","5","This recipe was great and I love it so much. I accomplished making them in the hour I had before school to bring to put Yearbook staff party and everyone loved them. I put marshmallows on too of the brownie mixture before putting it in the oven along with a palmful of sweetened hot chocolate powder and it creates the perfect hot chocolate brownies. I haven't tried the frosting (due to lack of confectioners sugar and car to go get some) but it sounds really good and as soon as I am able I want to try it!"
"0","5","best brownies ever! just being me, I add a tiny bit more cocoa, and vanilla, and it turned out great!"
"0","1","Not even close to 16 brownies, more like just 1. The amounts are incorrect and the dough is chewie."
"0","1","I didn't care for these at all! I will not be making them ever again, they needed more coco, they were very bland, what a disappointment they were,don't judge a recipe by it's name!"
"0","5","LOVE EM!"
"0","5","This recipe is simply amazing, and very easy too! Bye Bye boxed brownies! Hands down best brownies ever and my family agrees."
"0","5","These really are the BEST BROWNIES!! They are the perfect brownie! A crusty top and warm fudgy center. First time I have ever made truly homemade brownies. If you are a brownie person and you made these and didn't like them then you did something wrong. They seem to be the definition of a brownie! I didn't have all purpose flour so I used self rising and just left the salt and baking powder out. Easy.."
"0","5","First i made these for my husband's birthday and put the batter into mini bundt pans and they came out great! He loved them and so did everyone else! The I tried them in cupcake pans with pecans on top instead of mixed into the batter and another batch with mini chocolate chips on top. I was a worried the second time because I baked on batch in a mini bread loaf pan (only way to describe the pan I used). I baked both batches for 25 min and I was afraid that they were hardening or I had over cooked them so I let them sit over night to cool completely on a flat plan and amazingly they were soft an the right amount of chewy! I took them to my jobs thanksgiving party and they were a hit not even one left over, plus one of my co-workers is willing to pay me to make more! This is definitely my go-to recipe for brownies, so glad I found it and this website!!!"
"0","3","I doubled the recipe and followed the guidelines of another user- about keeping the salt the same and use one less egg- but these brownies were neither here nor there-"
"0","5","Great Brownie recipe  I didn't make the frosting just sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top after they came out of the oven let them soften them spread over the top. The topping does firm up when cooled,it's like a thin layer of chocolate candy with each bit."
"0","5","These melted in my mouth. They were a big hit!"
"0","5","These brownies are amazing! Yummy"
"0","4","This was a great, simple recipe from which to jump off from. After reading several reviews stating this was either too cake-like, or somewhere in between, I Made the following conclusions. First, DO NOT WHIP OR USE A MIXER when mixing these ingredients together. Just get a spatula or spoon and incorporate them enough to be as uniformly wet as possible. Just like a box recipe, there will be some small lumps. Fear not, it will even out as it bakes. Also, because I like think, heavy fudge-like brownies, I substituted some brown sugar for a quarter of the white sugar. I doubled the recipe, so that meant 1 1/2 cups white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, just to give it a bit more density and intense flavor.   Unfortunately my timer did not alert me to the end of baking time, and they stayed in the oven a little longer than they should have, but they STILL turned out great. The edges were crunchy with a heavy, dense brownie throughout. I am pleased they had wiggle room. Will definitely use this recipe again, maybe as a base and throw some yummy chocolate pieces or candy into it next time. Oh and I didn't bother with the frosting either. They turned out just perfect without it"
"0","5","I've made this recipe a dozen times, it's a family favorite. I have never made the frosting, it's fine as is. Also, I double the recipe, and use canola oil instead of butter."
"0","1","Terrible, what a waste of ingredients. I expected chewy, moist chocolate brownies, but they were cake-like. Not even good cake.."
"0","5","This recipe is great! The only adjustments I made were adding a little bit more baking powder as suggested by other cooks on this site and adding 100grams of dark chocolate (about 71% cocoa) when I was melting the butter. Please note that I DOUBLED the recipe, so if you were sticking with the original serving size, use 50grams of dark chocolate. I simply broke the chocolate bar into pieces and stirred consistently into the melted butter over low heat. After about two minutes, the chocolate was thoroughly melted into the butter. Be careful not to leave chocolate and butter on the stove after everything is melted because it will burn quite quickly! It created very moist fudgy brownies. This also made them incredibly rich that after one I was full! I also omitted the frosting because I thought it would be a bit too overwhelming. I will be making these for my friends birthday next week for sure! Thank you for this easy and quick recipe!"
"0","5","For cake brownies (not fudgy), these are perfect. Don't skip the frosting (I used up some leftover chocolate ganache)--too dry without!"
"0","4","very simple delicious brownie recipe. Its a keeper (per my 9 year old)"
"0","5","These are truly 'the best' brownies. This is my go-to recipe for weekends because they are so decadent and sweet! I added peppermint extract to the frosting with crushed candy canes, and they were AMAZING!!!!!! Thanks for the best brownies ever!!"
"0","5","These turn out perfect every time! Rich, melty almost like a fondant. I used high end Guidard chocolate rouge powder and they were AMAZING! The recipe is so easy because it is done in one saucepan-Waaay easier than a mix and my students think they are the bomb...:D"
"0","5","Way better than box mix! I always double the recipe and use a 9x13 shiny metal pan. Not sure if it's because of the doubling or not, but the frosting always seems way too thick to spread, so I add a couple tablespoons of extra butter and a tablespoon or so of vegetable oil (as needed). After they cool I sprinkle finely chopped walnuts on one half, cut them up and try to give away as many as possible as fast as I can because I always seem to gain a pound or two if I'm left alone too long with them!"
"0","5","I'm not a very good cook but I decided to make these one evening and WOW!!!!! Delectable goodness....."
"0","5","These are truly the 'best' brownies. I have found my new recipe to use all the time! I made these exactly as written except the butter for my frosting was melted instead of room temperature. I was very surprised reading comments they they came out 'cake-like'? Mine were very gooey and fudgy! Melt in my mouth!! They are actually addicting! Yum!!!  Oh and I am not a frosting person but don't skip this frosting - it is soooo great with these brownies!"
"0","5","Spectacular! No icing needed. This is my go-to recipe for brownies now and hereafter. The portions and calories are way off though, it makes one big brownie that is calorie free on Mondays! Thank you for a great recipe Angie!"
"0","5","AMAZING! I definitely went to brownie heaven after taking a bite out of these. I made them without the frosting. It is perfect warm, paired with ice cream. My only change would be to leave it in the oven for no more than 25 minutes"
"0","4","Tastes good, but it's more like a chocolate cake than brownie...!"
"0","5","Yummy!"
"0","4","Everybody loves these brownies! I have made my families recipe for icing on these brownies and I have tried the icing recipe the is in the recipe, both were great!"
"0","5","I use 1/2 c oil instead of butter and they turn out very moist and fudgy!"
"0","4","These brownies got rave reviews in our house! Not dry but not too cakey either. A Hit!!"
"0","5","Best recipe. Made real good brownies. Love these brownies. so awesome."
"0","1","I will never attempt to bake scratch brownies again! I tried this recipe and all was well until the frosting. I followed the recipe exactly and the frosting was so thick. I had to add a little milk to make is spreadable. It says to frost the brownies while they are still warm - what a mess. While frosting I tore up the brownies. Never again. Not worth the effort. Boxed brownie mix turns out right every time."
"0","5","These brownies are super tasty! As had been suggested in some other comments, I increased the amount of baking powder. I used a full teaspoon of baking powder and the brownies came out just right. Thanks for the lovely recipe!"
"0","5","These are great! Do not rate the recipe low if you did not follow it to a T! You can see in the video how the batter and frosting should look if properly done. I doubled everything for a 9x13 pan. I stopped at 27 minutes, to make sure not to overcook as recipe instructs. My frosting was a bit dry and unspreadable, so I warmed it like a few others commented. When everything was done, yum, yum, yum! My boyfriend asked how did you get it to be cakey on the outside and more fudgey on the inside, it is so good."
"0","5","These brownies are awesome and SO easy to make. The only thing I did different was I used 100g icing sugar for the frosting. Turns out great!"
"0","5","These are super good as written. When I make them I up the cocoa to a half cup and usually don't make the frosting. Great recipe!!"
"0","5","really good! soft and just like you would buy in the store but even better! my kids loved these. I made the frosting and it was also really good. Best to eat these warm. They are melt in your mouth good."
"0","1","This is cake, not brownies. Even for cake I did not care for it. I did not use my mixer and I did not over mix with a spoon."
"0","5","These brownies were great!"
"0","4","I just made these with my sister. This is a great brownie. It is simple and yummy. My sister and I modified the recipe by just a tad... we added a little more vanilla extract, and some brown sugar."
"0","5","Delicious! I decreased the sugar to 3/4 C and used apple sauce instead of butter. They were great i think next time i will use half a cup of sugar. This recipe doesnt need icing."
"0","5","These really are the best brownies ever. haters will hate and potatoes will potate."
"0","4","love these brownies ..."
"0","3","This is the finale to a steak & potatoes night with our 16 year old grand son. I'll rate it afterwards!"
"0","5","Really easy. Super fudgy and rich."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for brownies. here's some tips to make sure yours come out perfect. use melted chocolate instead of cocoa, i use about 3/4 c melted chips. (this will make sure you get a fudgy instead of cakey brownie. HOWEVER, doing this can result in a brownie that is too gooey, yes there is such a thing. if this happens to you, add a touch more flour next time around until you get the right feel of the necessary amount in ratio to the chocolate. melted chocolate is more on the liquid side in the ingredients list, therefore causing your batch to be less structured. to combat this, add more structure=flour, not too much or you'll have the evil cake texture) the only mixing tool you need is a good ol' wooden spoon or a spatula if its stiff enough. (reduces chance of over mixing, which can cause brownies to be more 'cakey' as well). use cold eggs and definitely do not pre-beat them (you know the flaky layer you get from box brownies? its all in the eggs...whites to be specific. be careful to not over beat eggs, as this breaks down the structure of the whites, which account for that flaky layer. again, don't use room temp eggs. make sure they're cold) ."
"0","4","This recipe is ALWAYS a hit at home especially when we are craving something chocolate. Baking them about 25 min and letting them cool then making the delicious icing adds a nice soft chewy taste to these brownies. This is one for the recipe book!"
"0","1","Not very fudgy, weird texture, hard to get out of pan. Will not make again."
"0","4","These brownies are good and very easy to make. I didn't make the frosting because I don't like frosting on my brownies."
"0","4","To be honest, I didn't think these brownies tasted that chocolatey - I find to get a real chocolate flavour, you do need chocolate, not just cocoa powder. However, I am giving the recipe 4 stars anyway because it is personal preference that I like my brownies to taste more like chocolate, and the recipe itself did turn out fine, in particular the texture. I definitely don't think the frosting is required - it is sweet enough as it is."
"0","4","These things are great! I had no idea making premix brownies were so bad."
"0","5","Oh my goodness!! I made this for my daughter and my husband and they LOVED it! I just added powder sugar, instead of icing. they were AWESOME  I'm totally going to use this again! I LOVE IT!!!! You have to TRY it! :)"
"0","5","These are so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I didn't make the frosting, but I don't think they need it. I will be making them many more times!"
"0","5","Easy, consistent, fudgy perfection that doesn't make tons of dishes. This is my new go-to brownie recipe."
"0","4","these come out well most of the time I have made them. But slight differences seem to make a big difference in the outcome (dry/moist). Not the most chocolate-ty brownie ever, but we do enjoy them."
"0","4","These brownies were good but I prefer 'Brooke's Best' brownies (also from this site) to these ones. I think Brooke's are more moist and with the addition of the chocolate chips in her recipe it has a little crunch to it that I love."
"0","1","This recipe is awful. The brownies came out with the taste and texture of a box recipe, which defeated the whole purpose of making brownies from scratch."
"0","3","Brownies are decent but nothing to write home about. I used 3 eggs instead of 2, though, to make a more fudge-like brownie. Though it worked well, they were still only decent. I also had to add some powdered sugar and a little extra vanilla to the frosting because all we tasted was cocoa. I will be using a different recipe from now on."
"0","5","Awesome homemade brownies! This is a great standard brownie base. The KEY is to NOT over bake. 25 mins is way too much. I would shoot for 15 mins. and keep an eye of it. I pulled mine out at 20 mins and it was almost over baked. I used valrhona chocolate cocoa, valrhona chocolate pieces and a big handful of pecans. Delish! I used a wonderful chocolate frosting I found on this site with valrhona chocolate cocoa as well. I thinned out the frosting too. This will be my go to brownie recipe. As far as texture. This is a true brownie, not cakey nor like a block of fudge. Give it a shot! Thanks!"
"0","5","This was teh best brownies ever!"
"0","3","This recipe was very easy, and my kids and husband really enjoyed them. But as other comments said I also found them to be cakey. I thought they were just OK. I used to make a lot of brownies back when I was a teenager and have lost my recipe (that wasn't yesterday lol) And looking for one that compares. No luck so far. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan and followed the directions exactly. I don't think this would be a recipe I would keep in my favorites. But the family is not complaining!"
"0","4","pretty good. i wouldn't say they were amazing brownies but good enough. i felt like they were not chewy enough and needed a little something....more. i will use this again after altering it a bit."
"0","5","I LOVE these brownies! I make them DF by using coconut oil or palm shortening. Delicious!"
"0","5","Yum! I made without frosting and they are delicious! Didn't change a thing."
"0","5","It's absolutely fantastic!!! I can truely say I've never tasted better dessert! It's melting and sooo delicious! All members in my family agree =)"
"0","5","I made brownies everybody in my family loved them"
"0","2","Not sure what happened here. I followed the recipe exactly but these would not set. I baked them for almost 40 minutes and they were still a gooey mess. I will chalk it up to bakers error and try again. The flavor was good but I just don't know what happened with the texture."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for snacks. Without the frosting, it taste amazing but with the frosting... it will BLOW YOUR MIND!!!! All my friends love these."
"0","2","I know that my oven usually cook well so i only let the brownie in it for 15 min before my 1st check... Border was already biscuit like, top almost burn. Only the middle of it was brownie like... but making a full batch to have half biscuit... :s  watch out for t° & timing with mordern oven. taste is good though.  didn't make the frosting and i'm happy because it was a waste of ingredients."
"0","4","I like the texture of this recipe, but thought there was way too much sugar (and I didn't even use the full amount). I may try it again one day and reduce the sugar even further because the texture was perfect for me. This would be an easy recipe to turn into mint chocolate brownies."
"0","5","Holy cow best brownies ever!!! I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole wheat flour, raw can sugar and I added 1/2 cup ground flax. The icing is hard to spread so put it on when the brownies are hot and use a metal spoon that will get warm and use your fingers a little. Soooo worth it! Sooooo delicious!!! Seriously easy and melt in your mouth!! This had become my new brownie staple recipe bye bye Betty Crocker"
"0","5","Made this recipe for the first time yesterday and it literally disappeared within minutes. My family just gobbled it up! Absolutely delicious! I didn't bother to make the frosting. The brownies were great as it is. My husband told me I have to make it again... like right now! Haha"
"0","4","They are pretty good. However, a little bit too sweet.  Very easy recipe !!!"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous! I added walnuts and these truly became the BEST brownies!"
"0","4","I will definitely try these again. I made them exactly according to the recipe, which I don't usually do. But, there were such dire warnings of not baking them too long that when I checked them with a couple of minutes left to go (about 23), and thought they already looked way done, I set them out to cool. Sadly, they weren't quite done, and I think the person who said 25 minutes is perfect was right. Also, I thought the frosting was too much. I don't usually like frosted brownies, so I should have known better. Still, they were good enough I gave them four stars. OH, and they were super easy to make."
"0","5","Tried the recipe, it was AMAZING!~ I did add an extra yolk for that little bit of added goodness, but it was also good without that! Even the likes of Sebastian Michaelis would be proud to serve this recipe at the Phantomhive estate."
"0","2","its not the perfect brownies..."
"0","5","I've made this four times, I added a cup of walnuts and baked for 30 minutes. They come out the same everytime, very good recipe,I found it easier for me to 'press out' the frosting between to pieces of wax paper in the shape of my pan, and then drop on, lots of compliments from family and co-workers."
"0","1","I was so excited to try this recipe, everybody seemed to love it! It just didn't work for me. I followed the recipe exactly as written. My brownies came out completely flat... as if I didn't put any baking powder in at all. The brownies have holes throughout the entire top. They're pretty weird to look at! And they don't taste like a brownie, definitely not fudgy. Ugh. Just didn't work out, don't know what happened! I'll try another recipe..."
"0","4","These brownies were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. They were so easy too! Box mix doesn't even compare. Will be making again"
"0","5","These are great brownies. Great taste and you will need a tall glass of milk. I make the frosting on the stove top and it spreads real nice and easy. Just be careful not to scorch the coco powder."
"0","5","I just finished making this brownie,it's was gooodddd!! It is a bit on a cakey side but has a the middle is kinda gooey. I used golden syrup instead of honey and also use less powder sugar than in the recipe. YUM !!"
"0","5","I really like these brownies!! I have had to tweak them just a tad (they are too chocolate-y to me, so I added a little more sugar to balance them out). I made the frosting for the first time on my second try with this dessert, and I used less cocoa and kept everything else the same. But these are only my preferences (the changes) when I made them the last time, sans frosting, the plate was cleaned almost instantly!! Def a keeper!!!"
"0","5","Bad idea to leave me home alone with allrecipes as 90% of my internets history. I came across this recipe snooping around for something to bake. I doubled the recipe and put in two 8x8 pans. When my family came home with some of their friends to all have a cookout all two pans of brownies were GONE!! They where not to sweet or stomach turning. DELICIOUS! Heres a SECRET for the people who like the SWEET-SALTY taste!... After pulling the brownies out of the oven (optional to frost them) wait 5 minutes and drizzle CARMEL and SEASALT over them and taste the AMAZINGNESS!"
"0","5","I put less sugar in the dough and tried adding grated chocolate. I had no butter so I replaced it with cream. I personally like to cover the greased pan with coconut rather than flour, it suits this kind of dessert. The result was delicious, I can only recommend it."
"0","5","Absolutely the best brownie I have ever made! Quick easy and delicious ! It's a keeper"
"0","5","Yummehhh"
"0","5","I made these to take to the hospital for everyone while my sister-in-law was having brain surgery (I try to fix everything with food!). Obviously, my family was pretty anxious, but they still raved about these brownies! Thanks for a great recipe! I will never buy boxed mix again!"
"0","5","Awesome! I loved these brownies, and so did everyone else. I added a cup of chopped walnuts to the mix, because nuts rock. I left off the frosting because I've always hated frosting. Perfect."
"0","5","Fats and quick recipe! We use it all the time! I wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","4","YUM!! These brownies turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly except for the frosting. When mixing the frosting, it was quite dry and powdery and not turning into frosting when mixing it. I added a capful and a half of milk using the milk jug lid. (I doubled everything in the recipe as I made 2 8x8 pans) That did the trick and the frosting turned out great. I made these this morning for my boyfriends bday and he loves them. Turned out like a chewy fudgy brownie. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","2","too dry...."
"0","5","Delicious as is, or thin the icing with milk & spread it on after they cool for a creamier,cake like icing. You can also add various nuts,caramels, or chocolates to make them your own."
"0","5","These brownies are fudgey, not fishy! Darn autocorrect!!"
"0","4","They were good nonetheless and all my friends enjoyed them. Next time I think I will try it with 3/4 stick of butter or maybe even 1/4 cup butter."
"0","4","Very easy and quick to make. Baked for 37 minutes. Very yummy! I was craving brownies and these hit the spot."
"0","5","So easy and delicious. I love that it can be made from ingredients I normally keep around the house. I didn't even do the frosting, but these are the best brownies I have ever made. I will never do another box mix."
"0","4","Made this recipe as written with the exception of mixing everything by hand. The brownies were FABULOUS. We did NOT like the 'glaze/frosting' on them at all. I will DEFINITELY make these again and omit the glaze."
"0","5","Best brownies ever! Doubled the recipe exactly for a 9x13 pan and they turned out perfect!"
"0","5","Fantabulous... Added a little more water, butter and a pinch of salt to the frosting and it came out shiny and delicious. I also followed others leads and warmed it just a bit on the stove. I doubled the recipe but made sure to not overcook. It was a big hit with all! Thanks Angie :)"
"0","5","I had intended to make '2 bite' brownies from this mix using my mini muffin pan. The 1st batch completly stuck to the tin, even after buttering it. So after a quick trip to the grocery store for mini cupcake papers, and whipping up another batch they turned out AMAZING! I read other reviews and mixed everything by hand. 12 min for the mini cupcake tin. Turned out great. I even added mini M&M's for the kids because I ran out of cocoa for to make icing. Rave reviews!"
"0","5","Very Good, I changed up the icing, because it was so dry, I added a little more butter. So goo."
"0","5","Angie, will you marry me? Yes, they are that good."
"0","5","We didn't make the frosting but the brownies were perfect without it. I don't know what to say about them. They were really delicious and I believe that we will be making them again. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","These were really scrumptious. I had problems making the frosting and ended up adding water and cream to give it some moisture. The frosting was way to sweet, but the brownies themselves were awesome. I'd make again."
"0","1","After reading some other reviews I noticed a few people heated the icing... Never have I ever heated icing and I make cupcakes ALL THE TIME. Well anyways, it would have been good to know in advance so I could avoid smashing the brownies into oblivion trying to frost them. I cannot believe this recipe has that many good reviews when it is obviously missing a very important directive! I'm appalled I wasted time to make flattened smashed up brownies!!!! I think I am going to stick to baking cupcakes from now on."
"0","4","I added a little Rosewater to the Recipe and it turned out even better than the original recipe. :)"
"0","3","Such an easy receipe to make but I was not too thrilled with the results. The frosting was a bit much."
"0","5","These are so good and easy to make!! You can add nuts or Chocolate chips. however they are great by themselves."
"0","5","These brownies are so, so, so good. Everyone loved them. They are really rich, but even more delicious!! I will definitely make these again. The actual brownies didn't take too long to make, but the frosting took a while to get to a good texture, and even then it was still very thick. All in all, these are great brownies!!"
"0","5","Great brownie. I only frosted half the pan because my wife doesn't like frosted brownies and either frosted or not is great.Some reviewers say too cake like but I"
"0","5","I'm not much of a cook or baker, but these are so EASY to make and absolutelt delicious. If anything, I'd double the frosting recipe. OK, the entire recipe. My family loves them and I'm making them for a high school band gathering today!"
"0","5","Wonderful! The pan I used to make the brownies was a bit too large. I will double the servings next time for a 9x13 pan. Obviously I ignored the serving size lol. As far as taste, they were absolutely wonderful! I followed the recipe to the 't' except I omitted the honey, because I did not have any. They still came out terrific! They were the right texture, right amount of sweetness and chocolatey taste. A note about the chocolate glaze, make sure you melt the butter a bit first. The instructions did not make that very clear so I added a dab of water to the glaze after mixing and it still turned out pretty good. Overall, this one is definitely a keeper."
"0","4","I baked these until a toothpick came out clean. When these first came out of the oven they were a little cakelike. But after they rested overnight in the fridge then left out to get to room temp, they were very nicely soft, chewy and a little fudgy. I hand mixed everything and 25 min. in my oven was perfect. Only gave it 4 stars because 5 star brownies to me have a cracked out chocolatey and sweet quality and these are not quite there."
"0","5","These were very good!! Nice and chewy! However----It seems like something is missing from the icing recipe. As I followed it, it turned out to be just crumbs. I added a little bit of milk and it turned out perfect! I will be making these again."
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever made. I added 2tablespoons of milk to the frosting and it tasted awesome. And I could make it without going shopping."
"0","1","These are not good. I didn't use the icing so only rating the brownie and it wasn't good. this is not a thick chewy brownie - its far too much like cake and not even very good cake."
"0","5","Made this tonight. Great recipe. Just dont substitute semi sweet chocolate for cocoa. They will explode like molton lava all over oven."
"0","1","The recipe was very easy and very quick however not the best I've had. The frosting was not smooth and the honey gave them an odd taste. My 2 boys didn't even like them and that is not normal."
"0","5","I loved these very much! Very easy to make and you can do all kinda of things the this recipe! Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","Delicious! First time I ever made brownies from scratch. If I'd have known how easy it was and how yummy they were I would have done this years ago! So easy, my not-quite-3 year old made them with just a little help from me. LOL"
"0","5","OMG - best brownies ever!!! I frosted them with mocha frosting. To die for! Double the recipe - trust me, they will be gone soon!"
"0","4","The cake in this recipe turned out light and fluffy and not dry. However I think it could be a little sweeter. I didn't make the frosting just used powder sugar so maybe that's why it wasn't sweet enough. I would make it again."
"0","5","I love it!"
"0","5","Made these for a work event. Everyone loved them!"
"0","5","EASY AS A BOX AND WE LOVED THEM."
"0","2","hmmm...I had the brownies in the oven almost 40 minutes...I double checked the recipe to confirm I had mixed it properly. Don't think I will be making this recipe again. It's gooey in the middle and DONE on the outside."
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it at least 5 times. The whole family and my sons friends love it as well. I double both brownie and icing recipes and use a 9x13 pan. The only thing I change is instead of all white sugar, I do half white and half brown sugars and I keep salt and baking powder at 1/4 tsp each."
"0","5","I made these a couple days ago and they where SOoo delicious!!! I undercooked them though, just a bit and they where so chewy and soft.... Yummy... We took them to a dinner party and they where finished in about 3 hours.... Soooo good!!! Definitely recommend these to anyone"
"0","5","Of all the homemade brownies I've tried in the past, these are definitely the yummiest and easiest. I followed the recipe exact for the brownie itself. I didn't have confectioners sugar for the frosting but I did have a can of Pillsbury milk chocolate frosting that did the trick. Delicious!!!"
"0","5","These are easy, fast and taste great. Always a quick treat when the chocolate cravings come along. Love them."
"0","5","these turned out perfectly!"
"0","5","These really are the Best Brownies. I tried another brownie recipe before this one and they didnt even compare. I made these with no frosting because i dont like frosting on brownies."
"0","5","this was great!! turned out perfect! I sprinkled some coarse sea salt on top to make my brownies a sweet treat with a hint of a salty finish. The salt actually hits opposite taste buds as the sugar and acts as a palate cleanser between bites. Very yummie and worth the try."
"0","5","First time making brownies from scratch! I will never buy mix again!!! They were awesome!!"
"0","5","FUDGE brownies. These are so incredibly rich and fudgey. The preparation was easy and the flavor is tops. I was a little low on cocoa powder, but there was no turning back. So I used some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to supplement the cocoa. No other alterations. They turned out great!!! My only critique is that they were so fudgey that they were difficult to get out of the pan and on to the serving plate. The presentation was not great. ***Also, if your brownies are cakelike, you are most likely OVER STIRRING the mix OR you are adding too much flour (most people scoop the measuring cup into the canister, which results in 50% more flour - instead, use a spoon/fork to scoop flour into a measuring cup)."
"0","5","Best brownie I have ever made! super easy to make and very delicious! Very moist in the middle!"
"0","5","This recipe was AMAZING. It wasn't super sweet. It was somewhere in between a cake brownie and a fudge brownie... perfect consistency. I doubled the recipe and added 15 leaves of fresh chocolate mint to mine... if you have the chance to do that you should! This is defiantly going in my recipe box!"
"0","5","These turned out really good. I was so nervous about overcooking these that I took them out at 15 min and frosted them.. They could have used another 5-8 min. I let them sit in the pan to cook and harden a little more and that helped."
"0","5","To DIE for, and so easy!!"
"0","5","So moist and delicious! I made a double batch for my family of six and they wanted to finish it in one sitting. A definite keeper! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is easy and delicious! People always rave about them! I definitely suggest doubling the recipe, the 8x8 pan always disappears very quickly!"
"0","5","Amazing recipe. Will try it again and again. Try subbing whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour."
"0","5","Hubby said these were the best brownies ever! I used regular cocoa powder, and they turned out delicious! Will use this recipe from now on."
"0","5","This is a perfect (and simple) brownie recipe; awesome, chewy-chocolaty goodness! I must say, I did not use the baking powder- that is the key to a dense brownie. Leave the baking powder in, if you like your brownies more like cake. I did not try the frosting, but they were wonderful without it."
"0","5","I made these for a cheerleading bake sale and used a mini muffin pan. Baked them for 10 minutes. They are so chewy and chocolatey. I will not buy anything with partially hydrogenated oils so buying a mix is out of the question. I don't need to though because I always have these ingredients and they are better than a mix. Also I only buy whole wheat flour and they are still delicious. Thanks for posting."
"0","5","These brownies were a hit! Frosting tip: It is a bit on the stiff side, however you need to put it on the brownies while they are still warm in even clumps. Let it sit and come back in 5 minutes to spread. Once everything is cooled, the frosting is the right consistency to easily package and transport."
"0","5","Excellent! I will never buy boxed brownies again. I've made these dozens of times now and they are chewy, chocolatey, and wonderful. I normally don't make the frosting because they are so good that they don't need it, but I did try the frosting recently and it is fabulous. Most frostings with butter and powdered sugar are too sweet and have an odd taste. This is rich and chocolatey. I did have to add a little milk to make it spread more easily. I put iron cooled brownies for more of a frosting feel vs a glaze. I think it'd be great on cake too. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","Crunchy on the outside, fudge-like center. Delish! 8' pan is perfect amount for me and my 2 little girls. Subbed a little coconut oil for the butter and added walnuts on top of half. Very good!"
"0","5","These were Amazing! No icing needed because they were sweet enough. Next time I'll double the recipe these are so good you need more!!"
"0","2","Mediocre at best. Store bought brownies are actually better.   Tried them again. Followed recipe to a t. More cake than brownie. And fyi I did not use an electric mixer."
"0","5","Made them vegan, healthier and yummy by substituting 1/2c apple sauce for butter, using half and half mix of xylitol and sugar, and using ground flax (1 tbsp) and water (3tbsp) for the egg, and oat flour. Didn't glaze. So much better than the vegan/vegetarian brownie recipes I have tried in the past."
"0","5","This recipe is really nice! I don't like desserts that are too sweet, so I would leave the frosting off! The brownies taste perfect without the frosting!"
"0","5","These brownies have turned out great every time I have made them, and they are always a huge hit! I had to add a little milk to the frosting to thin it out, and I cooked for only about 20 minutes to make sure they weren't too hard. The first time I added walnuts to the top but they could also be added into the batter if you like a little crunch in your brownie! Served warm with Italian gelato made these extra delicious."
"0","3","Taste good, but the recipe says it makes enough for a big pan, so when I used the big pan they were really thin. Also fall apart easily, and the frosting, after mixing the ingredients, it was all powder except a few clumps; so I tried adding milk, and it became soupy."
"0","5","I've made a few brownies in my day and these are the best I've made from scratch. I doubled the recipe for the brownies but omitted one egg based on others' reviews. Didn't double the frosting, I think that might have been overkill...putting it on while still hot then letting it cool made the best glaze on top. Not too fudgy, not too cakey. Just right!"
"0","4","Very good. Easy to throw together in a pinch. Took maybe 10 minutes to throw together and I cooked it for 27 minutes. Only thing I've a problem with, however, was the 'frosting'. Following the recipe, I got more of a chocolate-sugar spread and less of a frosting. I added about 3 tsp. of oil and another tablespoon of butter along with just a little more cocoa powder before it started to smooth up."
"0","5","Baked it yesterday to be delighted this morning. It's my first brownie...the first brownie in my life. I've never eaten them before, so I'm not a great expert on brownies (where I live it's not a traditional comfort dessert).  Well, I doubled the recipe to fit my 10x10 square pan. Used only 3 eggs as some users suggested, 14 oz (1,75 cup) of sugar, half a cup of ap flour and half a cup of whole wheat flour, half a cup of margarine (I strongly believe that it didn't affect the taste) and half a cup of butter. I poured the batter in the pan lined with oiled parchment, sprinkled a cup of roasted walnuts over it and slightly pressed them in the batter. Baked 30 minutes. I doubled all ingredients for frosting as well, except confectioners sugar (used only 1 cup). It turned out great: not crumbly at all, but very spreadable, not too sweet, but with very very rich flavor. In a couple of hours I got 9 large brownie squares. I wrapped them in individual parchment wrap and put in the air-tight cellofane bag. For this breakfast I gobbled 2 large brownie squares (not cake-y at all), and as a result now I have a slight nausea to all the chocolate in the world. Need to compare it with brownies made of melted chocolate chips."
"0","1","I made this recipe last night and first off, if your brownies are going to taste good then the batter itself should taste good. I followed this recipe to the letter and the batter was bitter, disgusting and just down right awful. I had to add stuff into the batter to make these brownies taste better and even then, they really didn't come out right. EVEN the frosting for the brownies in the recipe was horrible. If you're trying to make healthier brownies, there is a much better way to do it and this is not one of them. I will frankly never use this recipe again, for the effort I put in, I will just make my own recipe."
"0","4","Kind of unfair to rate this the way I am but there is no other choice since the recipe was submitted together. I would give the brownies a 10 star if I could. Rich, easy to make, not too sweet and still perfectly moist two days later. I would give the frosting a 2 because its WAY too sweet in my opinion. The frosting is easy to make but I leave it off all together. The brownies are perfect unfrosted but I use another recipe for icing if I feel like frosted brownies."
"0","1","I't needed milk I tried it with milk and it tasted like I was in heaven! It tasted bad without the milk so you need to add milk to this recipe. you did not figure out it needed milk but we did and we rock at baking!"
"0","5","I use this recipe all the time!! I am NOT a chocolate fan, but I do like to enjoy this brownie once in awhile. :) It's good with, or without the frosting. I take these with us on long car trips as snacks for the kids (and the hubby!), as they REALLY like them! *I made no changes to the recipe"
"0","5","The frosting was a little thick, a little water fixed that. I personally made some with and without frosting the ones without the frosting were better. I just think the frosting is an unnecessary addition. I love the recipe it is easy to follow."
"0","3","This recipe was ok. I will not make again. Because I like my brownies to be FUDGEY not like cake. But the Frosting was good. In my option not the best brownie."
"0","5","I really like these brownies but you really need to sift the confectioners sugar in the frosting because mine came out chunky but was still really good. The frosting was so thick that i added 1/2 tsp of water and it made it a little thinner but didn't affect the flavor at all."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious"
"0","4","Soft, delicious brownies they will melt in your mouth!!"
"0","3","Not bad, but these were more like cake than brownies."
"0","5","They turned out really tasty! Had to double recipe for 9x13 pan. The brownies sunk in a little in the middle but they were still delicious. Didn't even need frosting!"
"0","5","This recipe was amazing! I did make a few changes: I didn't make the frosting, but instead mixed chocolate chips into the batter, I replaced half of the flour with plain (unflavored, unsweetened) pea protein powder, and I replaced the vanilla with a few drops of peppermint oil. They turned out with the perfect texture, and had a very nice chocolaty, minty flavor. This is going to be my new brownie recipe!"
"0","5","This was absolutely delicious! My sister made the brownies, for the most part, and the only glitch was her use of mocha cocoa powder instead of regular cocoa powder. I don't know if we're ever going to try making it the correct way now! We couldn't quite wait for the brownies to cool and so cut them too early. All in all, they are the ugliest brownies I have ever seen, but they taste SO good."
"0","5","These really were the best brownies ever! I was nervous because in the reviews I read people either loved them or hated them. I doubled the recipe to make a batch for a 13x9 pan. I baked them for exactly 25 minutes. AMAZING!!! I can't wait to add all kinds of yummy things to them (like crushed Andy's mints...omg!) Thank you so much for posting this!!!"
"0","5","Definitely better than any box brownie I have ever tried. I totally love these! I follow the recipe exactly, no changes. LOVE 'EM"
"0","4","I made this once and my son loved it. Planning to make them again this weekend. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","These are the best brownies! I added a peanut butter icing to them...wow!"
"0","3","Very good tasting recipe, but the texture ended up very crumbly for me, and was extremely cake-like. I had trouble getting them out of the pan as well. I didn't try the frosting, because I don't like frosting on brownies, and I used a little more vanilla than called for, but this should not have affected the crumbliness of the recipe. I can't find why it ended up crummy, but even with the off texture, it tasted great."
"0","4","MY 5 yr old and I just made these. We doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan. We only used 3 eggs as a previous reviewer suggested. They came out Delicious! We had a few 'baking powder balls' in them, so from now on I will be sifting the dry ingredients. I didnt cook them long enough either (was worried I would over cook them and they would be no good like others had done). Even with them slightly underdone in the middle, these are the best, fudgiest brownies Ever!! Amazing flavor, not cake-like at All. This was our first attempt at homemade brownies and we will never go back! We always just used the box mixes, never again! Thank you So much for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","The title doesn't lie... THE BEST brownies I've ever had! Doubled the batch, put it in a 9x13 pan, and 30 minutes cooked it perfectly. I didn't even use exact measurements and it turned out great. Seems like really hard recipe to mess up. My boyfriend's family was literally licking their fingers. So good!"
"0","5","I really thought it was fun to make and easy but I would rather put the frosting on after it is cool"
"0","5","Love these brownies I hav to double the recipe I did add more cocoa powder to make the more choclatey,my family loved them, also made 4x the recipe."
"0","5","This recipe could not be more simple and easy. It's very sweet and with a nice chewy texture. I have always had problems in the past making brownies but this time they were perfect. Definitely making this my go to brownie recipe. :)"
"0","5","First time making homemade brownies. This recipe made it easy. My family loved the results. Chewy brownies."
"0","5","These brownies are awesome! I have made them several times. I usually double the batch and use a 9x13 glass pan. They bake very well. Usually takes about 25 min. But I check with a toothpick to make sure. They are pretty sweet. I cut back on the sugar when doubling and use 1 1/2 cups. And I have never made the icing. They are good without it! Always get compliments every time I make and bring to a party."
"0","4","Just made this recipe and it was PERFECT! This was a quick and easy recipe to satisfy a brownie craving; my tastebuds loved it even thought my waist may not... I just have to figure out a way to make it with agave instead of sugar."
"0","4","These brownies ARE more like cake than a brownie, but they are still good and moist. If you want to make it more dense try adding more flour and less liquids. I also powdered some coconut and threw that in there, probably about two handfuls, I think it added some depth to the dish. 25 minutes in the oven and it was cooked perfectly. I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract"
"0","5","Followed this recipe to the letter, with two exceptions: I didn't have honey so I substituted milk instead, and I added unsweetened chocolate chunks to the batter. The frosting turned out fine even with the substitution, and the unsweetened chunks gave the brownies some texture without making it overly sweet. My first attempt at brownies made from scratch and will DEFINITELY make again!"
"0","3","This was tasty, but the brownies were very thin. I prefer a thicker brownie so I would double the brownie recipe part when making it again. I had a little trouble with the frosting coming together but I added milk a teaspoon at a time until smooth. No need to double the frosting if doubling the brownie."
"0","5","YUMMY! Just made these delicious brownies. Easy to make and they taste great. I added an extra 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to give it a great chocolate kick. Be careful to NOT OVERMIX. If you over mix then they come out cake like. Mine were perfectly soft and chewy. My husband can not stop eating these."
"0","5","I made mine into 12 two bite brownies using paper liners and a cupcake pan. I under baked mine. They were gooey and perfect. Cooked until they began to rise and the gloss was gone from the top is all. I honestly didn't time it but when cooled they sank in the center into a gooey delicious fudge delight! Do NOT over mix. From experience those that do will have cake like brownies and do NOT over bake! I used a wire whisk and mixed just until things were blended. PERFECT! We plan to serve these at an upcoming BBQ!"
"0","5","This was a great recipe. Super chocolaty, loved by everyone of all ages in my family! The frosting added that extra special touch, but they are great with out the frosting too. I will be making these again! :)"
"0","3","Just ok, I'm searching for a deeper darker more grown up chocolatey brownie recipe. This just wasn't it."
"0","4","Good but not the best. Very easy with very basic ingredients.  A touch cakey, even with minimal mixing.  Not a dense, chewy brownie, but does still have a melt-in-your mouth feel.   But altogether not bad for a low effort chocolate fix.  I mixed the wet ingredients first, by hand then added every thing but the flour and mixed again. Flour was added and I stirred until well mixed. I poured them into mini cupcake pans (to make 2 bite brownies), topped them with a sprinkle of skor bits and baked them for 10 minutes.   Like I said...good but not my favourite recipe."
"0","5","These are AMAZING!!!!I love them and so does my family! If you like thin brownies use a larger pan otherwise they are perfectly fine the way they are. To the icing I did add 2 teaspoons of milk and it was very easy to pour on them. I have to say it was very easy to make and definitely tasted great. Loved, loved, loved them. Definitely a keeper recipe!!!!"
"0","5","we never buy brownie mix anynore! These are awesome and double the reciept if you have more than 3 people in the house. We are two parents of a 2 and 4 year old boys!"
"0","5","If you keep getting cake instead of brownies you're probably cooking too long or your oven runs hot. Especially if every brownie recipe you make is like that. Reduce the time.  These are the best brownies. Perfect chewy on the inside and flaky on the outside. Followed it to a T (i usually make changes to recipes). Just substituted for raw sugar and whole wheat flower"
"0","5","my absolutel favorite brownies!! So easy and so incredible! I will never make boxed brownies again!!"
"0","1","I doubled the recipe. It turned out cakey. Absolutely not good at all. I am a very average cook.....I suppose if you are a good cook you can tweak this recipe. I have neither the time nor the knowledge to mess with it. I wouldn't recommend this recipe."
"0","5","These brownies are fudgy, dense, and very moist. They are a snap to make, made with simple ingredients most of us have on hand. The batter went together in about 5 minutes. I removed them from the oven at 25 minutes. I highly recommend this recipe, but warn you...make a double batch because they won't last long! Thanks for a fantastic quick treat!!"
"0","5","excellent recipe! super easy...i'll never buy box mix again. if doubling the recipe, add only 1 egg instead of 2 to keep the fudge-like texture. still good if you add 2, but will turn out more cake-like. the frosting is amazing...very rich. add about 1 tbs. half and half and it turns out very smooth and spreads much more easily. thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","With a few substitutions, these brownies are the best I've ever had. I like FUDGY brownies, the more so the better.  If you want super fudgy brownies (like I did) here is how to manipulate this recipe!  Use vegetable oil instead of butter. It sounds weird, but it makes for a moister, denser, and healthier brownie. Use all brown sugar instead of white add 1/4 cup extra cocoa powder throw in an extra pinch of salt (it helps to bring out the chocolate)   so good. umf."
"0","5","I tried this recipe so many times my grand son who don't like brownies before now tell me to make often .very simple & very testy ..."
"0","5","This is such a great base recipe. I baked it once with a half a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and once with coconut oil (half of the called for butter and the remainder with trader joes coconut oil) and toasted coconut flakes and almond oil.. So happy with the results.... Play with it and taylor it to your preferences! Also, mix ingredients by have vs a mixer to get a non-cakey-more- brownie texture :)"
"0","5","Omg, I don't know what to say about these other than how amazing they were. Thank you for a delicious brownie recipe!! :-D"
"0","5","brilliant recipe, made it a couple of times and everybody loves them! I think a chocolate chips is a pretty great addition to these! I use about the same amount of choc-chips as I do butter."
"0","3","These brownies were pretty good, but not the best. I thought the frosting was a bit too sweet. My husband said they would have been better without it."
"0","4","Just made these brownies. They were good, but I am not sure about the best. I followed the directions, but I baked them at 325 degrees. I cant wait to see what they are like in the morning. That is the true test. O' yea I added 1/2 cup of nuts and I did not make the icing (didn't need it)"
"0","5","SOO Good!!!"
"0","5","Came out nice and tasted great."
"0","3","These were okay. I made them exactly as the recipe stated and even used the frosting. Nothing special here, but they were extremely moist. To me it was a typical brownie. Very easy to make. You really can't go wrong."
"0","5","I don't think I will ever buy brownie mix! If you are baking in a 13x9 pan you must double the recipe. Very moist and no need for the icing. They are the 'BEST BROWNIES.'"
"0","5","This was very good, I added 1 teaspoon of instant coffee to the batter for a more chocolate flavor, and 1/4 cup chopped nuts. This recipe went from good to Great."
"0","5","This recipe is awesome!!  I made it with almond extract in place of vanilla and added honey directly to the batter and it was amazing!!"
"0","5","Absoulutely Wonderful!! Followed the recipe to a t including the frosting and it was perfect. (ok I did add a tablespoon of milk to the frosting recipe and I added mini chocolate chips to the top of the batter in the pan while it baked. Other than that no alterations."
"0","5","It was fun to make and so incredibly easy to make. its a great project to do with kids as well."
"0","5","Made exactly as recipe called and was perfect. I was a little unsure if the frosting as it was very thick but when you put it over the hot brownies it was perfect!"
"0","5","This recipie is perfect the way it is. I didn't add any glazing, it didn't need it and may be too sweet with glazing. This one is going in my recipie box!"
"0","5","i love these brownies they r so good n chewy and easy to to make i fix them all the time"
"0","5","If I could say delicious 10x's I would !! A new family favorite. So easy it's unbelievable !!!"
"0","5","Very good even with the icing!!! The only negative is that it does not make enough!!!"
"0","4","I loved this recipes it was really was. It was the best home made brownies i have ever made. They were gone within an hour of making these! I will definitely have to make these again!"
"0","5","I've made several batches of this recipe, and always with amazing results. I don't add the frosting, they taste great without it! I constantly get requests to make them. I will never go back to box brownies ever, especially with how simple this recipe is."
"0","5","This recipe is GREAT. I cooked  them without the frosting and they came out soft and chewy !"
"0","5","Chocoholics' delight with Best Brownies..."
"0","4","This recipe was great! But, like most of these reviews have said, there are things that have to be tweaked. The most important thing that NEEDS to be changed is that instead of putting 1 cup of confectioners sugar into the frosting, 1/4 cup is way enough. The first time I made these, I followed the direct recipe, and the frosting was so chunky it was impossible to spread over the brownies. Also, these brownies are a little cakey, but I have heard that if you stir them less and bake them for just under 20 mins, they will be better. Also, if these are too chocolaty for you, use less cocoa powder in the frosting. Other than that, great recipe!"
"0","5","this is the best recipe ever! i made four batches and took them to a party. everyone thought these were just the best!they are fudgey and cake like. THE BEST!!!"
"0","5","WOW. Perfect."
"0","5","Delicious as is!"
"0","5","I have truly found THE brownie. I did not change a single thing in the recipe, and they do turn out cakie on the outside and chewy on the inside, the perfect combo of textures. I have not tried them with the frosting yet because I'm still savoring the taste of the brownie itself! I'll eventually get around to trying the frosting tho. Happy Eating All!"
"0","5","Our family LOVED this recipe!!! We added powder sugar and it was delicious!!!!!!!!!! These brownies are worth it and we are sharing this recipe with our other family members too!!!!"
"0","5","I did'nt change a thing about these brownies and they were amazing. My husband told me to add them to our recipe book. very good:)"
"0","5","These were excellent, I added extra 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and they turned out soooo moist and choclatety. Kids loved them. So easy and yummy I will never buy boxed again! Thanks for this recipe it`s a keeper!"
"0","5","Perfect! I love a brownie that is neither cakey nor fudgey, and this was it. I used stone ground whole wheat flour and evaporated cane sugar, and I skipped out on the frosting. And, I made sure not to over mix or overbake and to lightly beat the eggs first. My husband enjoyed it, which is awesome given that he was not even excited about the brownie dessert option. Thanks!"
"0","5","They came out so good! I did not make the frosting but I did turn them into cheesecake brownies. 1 block of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 egg. I dropped the cheese cake filling by spoonfuls and swirled into brownie mixture."
"0","5","After I made these brownies, my family told me not to ever buy a brownie mix again. Soft and fudgey type brownies I highly recommend them."
"0","5","The title says it all..."
"0","5","Best Brownies I ever made. I will never buy the box brownies again. So easy to make too!"
"0","5","Everyone I make these for love them. Thank you very much :)"
"0","5","I absolutely love these. Fast, easy and super moist!! I never even get the chance to ice them since they are gone almost as soon as they come out of the oven. Oh and I shipped some to my son who lives in Florida. I'm in Ohio, he said they were still super moist. This will be a regular in our kitchen."
"0","5","These are the BEST! You might as well double the recipe right off. The frosting was interesting and delicious as well. I have been looking for the best brownie recipe, I found it in this one! These are light, chocolate-y, just right! I didn't change a thing. Mixed it all by hand, and it was so quick and easy."
"0","5","Made as is - loved them! Nice and fudgy!"
"0","5","I thought these were amazing! I had never tried making brownies from scratch before,and I had tried another recipe first that failed miserably, so I am very glad that these were awesome. :)"
"0","5","I took these out of the oven 10 minutes ago, and the pan is already half empty. They were fabulous! I did not make the frosting, because I don't like frosting on brownies. I also went with the other reviewers who hand mixed rather than using a hand/stand mixer. The one thing that I had issues with was the cooking time. I had them in for about 32 minutes before they were cooked through (and that might be an overstatement because they were still very moist and fudgey)."
"0","5","Definitely delicious. I'm not sure how anyone could mess this up. It was super easy and my brownies had such a nice crust that i skipped the icing to avoid more sugar ;) since it wasn't necessary to enjoy them. To the people who are getting cake-like brownies; try the first reviewers tips about hand mixing and you should be pleased."
"0","5","great good wonderful fantastic"
"0","5","These are perfection! I did not change a thing. SO GOOD. Do not leave out the frosting!!!!! It really makes them go from good to great. TIP: if your frosting is too dry or crumbly while mixing, just stick it in the microwave til its warm and smooth"
"0","5","these are the best"
"0","5","This recipe was excellent. I doubled it for a 9X11 size. The only thing I changed was to add some corn syrup to the frosting. I probably doubled the liquid portion of the frosting to get an acceptable consistency. I know the recipe says not to overcook, and I cannot stress that enough. I agree with another person who suggested 25 minutes was long enough. And, yes I did mix it by hand. I decided I was a little out-of-shape, but it came together fine. I do want to try the lowfat version that another reviewer suggested. Guests loved the original, however."
"0","5","These brownies are amazing. They're easy to make, and they're better than all of the premade mixes that I've used."
"0","5","For the frosting, my daughter found it a bit too thick for her liking and added a tiny bit of milk. Much easier to spread!"
"0","5","These brownies are so soft and chewy everybody loved these also the frosting was a five star rating!!! And they always come out perfect!"
"0","5","Moist and dense and not cakelike at all. The icing added a really nice but not overpowering punch of sweetness, though I found I had to add a little milk to make it come together. This recipe is a definite keeper."
"0","5","These came out moist and fudgy and decadant! Will DEFINITELY make again!"
"0","5","These were very good, and not at all cake-like as some of the negative reviews have posted. (Unless you can't bake and you managed to screw these up). Very chocolaty and moist. You could probably go without the frosting but I wouldn't it's very good. It's almost not quite like frosting it's more fudge-y than that. Word of advice, put the frosting in the microwave for about 30 seconds to soften it before spreading. I think it would go on a lot easier that way. I will definitely be making these again! YUM!"
"0","5","These are the best, even better than a box and just as easy! I added white chocolate chips for variety. Had to have a glass of milk, too!"
"0","5","My kids loved them the frosting recipe was amazing too."
"0","4","Great recipe! First time I try to make brownies from scratch and they turned out very well. The consistency is right, and they are not too sweet. I did not make the icing- I don't think they need it! I added walnuts and chocolate chips to the batter and they were delicious. I'll try not to eat the whole thing myself (husband is out of town!)"
"0","5","I used organic sugar. I made 1 batch and pourd into pan. Then dripped Adams crunchy peanutbutter on top. Sprinkled some semisweet chocolate chips an then covered with another batch. Cooked about 325 for 35 - 40 minutes in a 8 x 13 pan. Best brownies ive ever had. Oh and i put some maple glazed pecans on top of half the pan before i baked it."
"0","5","Great recipe to make for family and friends... The perfect way to show you love them. Excellent taste.. It isn't bad for your body as much as other brownies ... And the taste blows me away!!!! great job. I LOVED IT SO SO SO MUCH"
"0","5","This is the WORLD'S BEST!!!!!!!!! Next time I will double the recipe. They are great with or without frosting. I did not change a thing."
"0","5","I absolutely loved this recipe! It cooked for the right time and came out perfect! I liked the frosting too, it reminded me of a professional bakery brownie frosting. The only thing I did differently was add about a quarter cup of milk to the frosting, it was pretty dry and actually crumbly before that,although I live in AZ so everythings pretty dry. Great recipe!"
"0","5","My family loves these brownies! I double the recipe when I make them because they don't last! The only thing I have changed is just melting the butter in the microwave and mixing all ingredients in my mixer. They turn out amazing every time and are a HUGE hit! FYI, if you're doubling the recipe, you might have to add 2 or 3 minutes to the cooking time. Make these, you won't be disappointed!"
"0","4","I should have not used Splenda with this recipe. Repeat: Do Not Use Splenda. You'll end up with something akin to rubber. Will make again and follow the recipe to the letter."
"0","5","Great recipe'. I skipped the frosting, and for the brownie I used coconut oil instead of butter. I also had about 1/3 of a cut of mini chocolate chips I needed to get rid of, so I tossed those in too. Yum!!"
"0","4","This is very close in tastes to my moms, but sweeter. I kept these in the fridge afterward to keep them chewy. No need for icing, great as they are"
"0","2","The flavor was alright but they are too cake-like."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe and used salted butter because that's all I had on hand and just a pinch of salt since the butter was already salted. I also took another reviewers advice and halved the amount of powdered sugar in the frosting.This made it very easy to mix and I didn't need to spread it, I just poured it onto the brownies. They baked for 26 minutes and were the kind that stick to the roof of your mouth which I absolutely love! The frosting added nice texture but I might omit it next time, just to cut out on the amount of sugar."
"0","5","These brownies were amazing. I actually used them for a base on a chocolate chip cookie dough brownie and they were perfect (left off the frosting since I was topping with chocolate chip cookie dough dip). They are just flying out of the pan at the work event I brought them too.   After reading a lot of the reviews I stuck almost completely with the recipe with the exception of adding a bit more cocoa powder. I don't know if I ended up with 1/2 a cup, but I did use more than 1/3. Definitely give these a try!"
"0","5","very impressed!!"
"0","5","I made these brownies 3 times already. I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out perfectly every time. They're very easy to make with kids as well. Thank you for posting it. They're now our family favourite!"
"0","5","This was such a simple recipe to make and everyone at my kids birthday party said they were really good. I double the recipe and put them in a long cake pan"
"0","5","My family loved these brownies. I didn't use the icing. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks."
"0","5","These brownies were delicious, I read many of the reviews before making the brownies and made a few adjustments to the brownie mixture: 1/2 cup of of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 3oz of Baker Semi Sweet Baking Squares, 1/2 cup of oat flour. I omitted the baking powder and the salt. I also made sure not to over mix the brownies and melted the baking squares with the 1/2 cup of butter. I also baked these in a glass pan at 325 degrees. They turned out just perfect, they were mouthwatering and moist. Next time I will try this recipe with apple sauce to make them a little healthier! I've been in search for a good recipe and this one is def the one!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies! We threw in 3/4 cup of chocolate chips for fun - absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","The brownies are fudgy and rich. They're very good. They were not cake-like at all, as some describe. Maybe that's an altitude issue. My frosting was pretty clumpy but eventually melted on the brownies. Next time I will microwave the frosting just for a little bit."
"0","4","Good - Add the topping right out of the oven otherwise it doesn't melt and solidify."
"0","5","Love this recipe, it's perfect. Have tried to make brownies so many times but they always fail but now I always use this version, thanks!"
"0","5","Absolutely love it and it's so simple! Not overly sweet either, just perfect!"
"0","5","This is a very solid recipe that delivers a crowd-pleasing dessert. I keep asking myself when am I going to make this again!"
"0","4","Im always trying new Brownie recipes for the Peanut butter pie I make! This recipe was good with my alterations i added a bit more flour my batter seemed a little runney and added some vanilla extract these were definitely fudgy! And very tasty..."
"0","4","I added walnuts. Mine came out a little dry but they are still delicious! Reading other reviews I likely over mixed them or added too much cocoa powder. I'll be careful about mixing them next time I make them :)"
"0","3","Not the best I've ever made. Easy for sure."
"0","5","I just got done making these, took my first bite, and let me tell you... These are delicious! They are just as easy to make as boxed brownies and taste worlds better. Give them a try!"
"0","5","I thought these were quite delicious, and fast to put together as well. I would most certainly make these again. I didn't think to try the brownie without the icing first to get the real flavor of it, but together, the brownie and frosting are great!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe for the first time last night for a BBQ. I forgot to add the baking poweder! Oooops....but they still turned out and where the hit of the party! I did add the frosting but they are delicious without it! This is my new 'go to' recipe for brownies and I won't ever make them from a box again. I highly recommend this recipe. Add walnuts if you would like. They are very very chocolaty so if you add choc chips...BEWARE! Highly Addictive!"
"0","5","These brownies were very good. I didn't make the frosting, but they were yummy without it. I beat the eggs first as suggested in another review. Mixed by hand with a wooden spoon and used a wire whisk at the very end just to get rid of lumps. Greased the pan with crisco before flouring which made cutting & removing them from the pan a breeze. Lowered the cooking time to 21 minutes & baked on top rack. I may even try 20 minutes the next time, but they were pretty moist as is. I read quite a few reviews saying they were dry and it is probably because they were baked too long. A few minutes make a huge difference. Hope this was helpful. Happy Baking! :)"
"0","4","I have to admit, both the brownies and the icing did have a little bit of a cocoa powder taste to it, but they were actually awesome. My Dad and Sister both liked it. Waiting to feed to my Mom and Brother. I like how the recipe included how to make icing with the brownies... overall, they tasted good for people with a budget."
"0","5","I made these tonight with my 8 year old son. We followed the directions and read most recent reviews... stirring by hand instead of mixer... Loved loved loved these brownies. My older son kept trying to sneak another one. This is a keeper. We didn't over bake. I took them out at 20 minutes (had a rectangular pan)... perfection!"
"0","5","i messed up but i bet it tastes great"
"0","4","Pretty good. I was hoping for something moist and heavy-maybe like the ones you used to smush up into a ball before eating as a little kid-but these turned out pleasant in their own right-moist, a little cake-like, but not deplorably so. They pleased this non-chocolate lover well enough. Not the kind of brownies you can pick the crackly crust off of, but then again, I did not make the frosting. Very chocolatey."
"0","5","THE best recipe ever. i followed it to T and the brownies came out AWESOME!!!!! the only different thing i did was, add chocolate chips to it becaus ei LOVE chocolate and i didnt make the glaze either. but these brownies were just amazing.... UPATE:-above is my previous review, i am updating it today because well now i have made these brownies SO many times that i can probably make them ith my eyes closed but today was different- i made the frosting. again i followed the EXACT recipe and, well, let's just say, the frosting didn't make it to the brownies(i ate it all). so i made another batch of frosting which i forced myself to put on the brownie and the brownies were AH-MAZING! just when i thought these brownies couldn't get any better."
"0","4","I thought these were great being that it was my first time making brownies for a client. Very easy to follow recipe.   Suggestions:  - Half the sugar in the frosting. I usually do this with all frostings that ask for powder sugar anyway because I prefer to err on the side of 'slightly sweet' and then add as I see fit.   - While cocoa powder is good, I prefer actual chocolate. So, in addition to the powder, I tempered a few baking discs of semi-sweet chocolate and added it to the frosting and whipped it together to make the perfect icing for piping. I put it in a plastic bag (didn't have a piping bag on hand) and put some swirls in there. I, also, added powder sugar for kicks. Next time I will sub the cocoa powder in the actual recipe itself for real chocolate.  - I added instant expresso (mixed with hot water) to bring the taste of the chocolate out further.   Great, simple recipe. Next time I'll add peanut butter for kicks."
"0","5","I've made these brownies three times and now that I've mastered them, I must say they are magnificent! The key is to start checking them at a little under 25min - if they cook too long they will be drier and more cake-like - I like mine moist, and these came out perfectly! The frosting is terrific, but your butter needs to be very soft - even partially melted (I put my butter in the oven to soften after the brownies came out), and I'd suggest starting with 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar and adding from there, because as some have mentioned the frosting can come out dry. Instead of melting the butter in a saucepan, I microwaved it in a large bowl, then added my ingredients right to that. Delicious!"
"0","5","Wow! These were super yummy... I made the frosting but never needed it after tasting how awesome the brownies were without them. I poured in some melted caramel and sprinkled some salt on top, very tasty."
"0","5","Chocolate overload! Perfect"
"0","2","The texture and taste of these brownies is exactly like a box of brownie mix. I wanted authentic, dense, rich brownies and was disappointed."
"0","5","I doubled this recipe, so Yummy!"
"0","4","Easy to make and easy to eat! For the frosting I just added a tad of milk to make it spreadable. Sweet? Absolutely! I wouldn't want it any other way! Other than that I added a tablespoon of Hennessy to the batter and it was delicous."
"0","5","I followed the instructions of another poster and used a spoon to mix all ingredients instead of beating.  It didn't specify, but I used a glass 8in pan.  Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe, very quick and easy. Love that it all comes together in the pan you melt the butter in. I had a hard time getting the frosting to come together, so I added a smidge of half & half (it was all I had in the fridge). Came together great and didn't alter the consistency of the frosting. Never using a boxed mix again."
"0","5","wow, i tried this today and it was really amazing, 5stars for this best brownies, and remember that really NO OVERCOOK."
"0","5","I made these last minute for a bake sale at my son's school. I love that the recipe uses ingredients I typically keep on hand, it was extremely easy, and they were delicious."
"0","5","I did not make the frosting but the brownies were great. Contrary to some of the negative reviews the brownies were not at all like cake. Don't over work and over bake the batter. Next time I will add some chopped walnuts."
"0","5","This is the same recipe that is in the Hersheys Cocoa Book that I have, and they are certainly the Best Brownies! Really they don't need any icing at all. Better than any mix I have ever tried."
"0","4","This recipe is amazingly easy. The only thing is the brownies are very cake like. They get less cake like as they cool. Secondly. I personally think the frosting is disgusting! It's very think and has a very strange after taste and feels weird on your tongue. Don't use the frosting. It's terrible."
"0","5","These are the best, soft-cake-like brownies!!! To make it denser, I would skip baking powder next time."
"0","2","'Always turn out?' Hmm. Perhaps the poster did something that s/he didn't include in this recipe. What I got was a greasy, oily mess-- there is WAY too much butter in this recipe. Other bakers said they had a cake-like consistency-- mine was flat, so flat that it almost seemed like there wasn't anything n it to make it rise.   As other reviewers have said, I could probably fool around with this to make it better, but I'd rather just find a different recipe."
"0","3","I followed the advice others had posted and mixed the mix by hand. Sadly, they turned out 'cakey' anyway. I found the taste to be bland and unimpressive. They were easy enough to make but given my disappointment with how they taste, I will not be making them again."
"0","5","Definitely amazing. Sweet, rich, and fudgey, they're everything a homemade brownie should be. I actually doubled up all the ingredients but still used a 8' pan, so the brownies turned out much thicker than the first time I made them. Definitely suggest trying to double up. Brownies turn out much richer and fudgier this way. Other than that, perfect."
"0","5","really is the best brownies!!!"
"0","4","Great, easy brownie recipe. I doubled the recipe, used half applesauce & half butter and omitted frosting. Great and fast!"
"0","4","These were awesome brownies that I added pecans to. They were perfect when the timer went off...which is unusual for me. :)"
"0","5","These brownies were delicious! Very easy to make, and perfect for a baking day with my four-year-old. Mix by hand for best results!"
"0","4","I used Swiss Miss packets with marshmallows and used a little less sugar. I used a cupcake tin vs 8 inch tin. They came out moist and delicious-not too sweet. I didn't make the frosting. I would definitely make these again."
"0","5","this recipe is really good :P i really liked the taste :O"
"0","5","My Husband and sons love these brownies. The only thing 'wrong' with them, in my opinion, is the frosting is too dry. I added 2 tablespoons of milk and it was perfect."
"0","3","A school sale sort of a brownie, which is what I was baking at the time. They will be gone, no doubt. Nothing beats the ingredients. All the good things. Minus everything special. I would add chocolate chips next time, just to give them something special.  In order to upgrade them to a different level - melt some chocolate, increase the eggs and cocoa powder.  I have to say in defense, I did not make the frosting, somehow in my mind it does go with brownies very well."
"0","5","so good - so chocolatey - not cakey...."
"0","3","I have tried this recipe before using a mixer and it turned out okay, but this time I took a reviewer's advice and mixed it by hand and it didn't turn out as expected. It was crumbly ,dry and didn't resemble fudge like brownies in any way. It was more like cake. This recipe is good, but i prefer ready-to-make box brownies. they save me a lot of trouble."
"0","5","Really good. Try browning the butter for both the brownies and frosting, although the frosting is not necessary...Very Rich !"
"0","5","absolutely lovely :) flawless brownies"
"0","5","These were delicious! I agree that they fall somewhere between cakey and fudgey. I didn't top them with the frosting and they were perfect. I have a feeling if I were to top them with the frosting they would have been too sweet. The other thing I changed is that I made them gluten-free. I substituted the all-purpose flour with a 1/4 cup of sorghum flour and a 1/4 cup of white rice flour. Finally I found that I needed to bake them for the full 30 minutes... but I think that is a side-effect of the flour switch-up. I've used these flours before in other recipes and always find that I have to bake whatever I'm making for longer. Anyway, I will definitely be keeping this recipe on file!"
"0","5","My family loved it. It was soft and the sweetness was perfect. Now my sister and my brother are begging me to make it again."
"0","1","tried because of all the stars, followed recipe to a t, and while they had good flavour didnt cook right, hard as a rock on the outside and raw on the inside, plus they didnt rise at all. husband told me they were disgusting, something i have never heard him say with any food i cook or bake"
"0","5","These brownies are DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and doubled. Wonderful crispy crust on top and fudgy middle - perfection! I did not make the icing, but instead served with vanilla ice cream. They got rave reviews and our company requested the recipe. The leftovers did dry out some, resulting in a bit cakier texture...should definitely be served immediately after baking.  Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is wonderful for kids and adults! I put together these brownies once for a bake sale and they were super simple to make, delicious, and only take an hour to make! I would highly recommend these delicious brownies!"
"0","4","I liked the brownies. I did use a teaspoon of raspberry flavoring in both the brownies and the icing though, gave a nice after-taste. (When a church gives you 5 bottles of restaurant-sized flavorings in lieu of payment, you're going to use them in everything to get rid of them.)"
"0","5","Definitely worth a try! Just turns out brilliant if you follow the recipe to the 'T'. It sure is like the best brownie from my favorite confectionary! Just melts in the mouth..  Though the sugar can be reduced from 1 cup to 3/4th cup or even 1/2 cup. Aldo adding walnuts makes it taste simply gorgeous.. I rate it a big 5!"
"0","5","I am not a huge brownie fan but the kids wanted some so I gave these a try and they were great, almost fudge like. One note is that the icing looks way to thick and dry, but thats why you put it on when they are hot, it melts right in there and is fantastic!"
"0","5","These are simple and fantastic! I don't make the frosting, I just sprinkle with powdered sugar. Yummy!"
"0","4","Good brownies even without the frosting. Only change I made was using 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar b/c I didn't have enough white on hand. Will make again."
"0","5","I've been making brownies with this recipe for years. The only difference is that there is 1/4 cup of honey added when you add the vanilla. And the original name of them was 'Heavenly Delight Brownies'. This fits them because they are, without a doubt, the best, most delightful brownies anywhere. You just have to try them. I intend to try the applesauce recommended by one of the reviewers, just for kicks. It might be very good. :)"
"0","4","These were so good. I made a few tweaks and they turned out so amazing! First, I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I scrambled up the eggs before adding to the batter. I hand mixed all the ingredients together instead of using a mixer. I also added 2 tsp of instant espresso powder & 2/3c mini chocolate chips. I baked them for 30 mins and they turned out perfect. They didn't need any frosting. My family loved them."
"0","5","excellent brownie!! My family loved them!"
"0","3","A GREAT chocolate cake recipe. Just not a brownie. Very cakey to be a brownie!"
"0","5","Awesome,addictive don't even need icing. i add a smidgen less baking powder they can turn out a little over fluffy for brownies"
"0","5","Very yummy brownies. I added about 2 tablespoons of Hershey syrup and chocolate chips. Turned out great. As others suggested don't over mix. I used a wooden spoon."
"0","5","We LOVED these! Even our first batch, which we accidentally over cooked, were not bad, and when you take them out of the oven on time, they are even better :) Super easy and fun to make. Give them to people, and they will love you forever!"
"0","2","Spongey texture. I'm not particularly fond of this texture in a brownie. Also the brownies were quite thin. I baked in a smaller baking dish ( 7x9) hoping to avoid a thin brownie. I thought a cup of sugar was a lot! So I used 1/2 cup. Maybe that' where I went wrong. The brownies were plenty sweet, however."
"0","5","Love it! Didn't even need the frosting!! These are so good I will have to double the recipe next time!!"
"0","5","Seriously the best brownies I've ever eaten in my life. The frosting is good (needs extra moisture though!) but unnecessary because the brownies are perfect without it. The only change I made is by the suggestion of others I subbed in some brown sugar in place of the white (I made a double batch and used 1 cup white, 1 cup brown) and I also threw in some mini semi-sweet chips that I had in the house. SO GOOD. If you grease the pan with canola oil it gets a really crispy-chewy perfect edge. Don't overcook them! They cook on the counter after you pull them out!"
"0","5","These are fabulous... Only thing I would change is that the less sugar in the topping, just to make it easier to spread! A must try!!!"
"0","3","A little too sweet. I did use dark cocoa (didn't have regular) and pecans instead of walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. They are edible, and probably would have been better had I not used the dark powder cocoa. It definitely makes a thinner brownie. I doubled the batch and used a 10x15 pan."
"0","4","these are so good. but the texture of mine was more rich cake/fudgy type. i didnt mind though because they were yummy. although the recipe says 16 pieces you should note they are tiny pieces about 4 by 4 cm, so use a small baking tray. the portion is enough for about 6 people so no need to double."
"0","5","I would agree with the title of 'Best Brownies'! These are very easy to make and are sooooo good. I did add a touch of cinnamon, but that was my only change. I made these for hubby's birthday & he loved them. They were nice & soft - I made sure not to over cook them & they were just gooey enough. I will make these again soon!"
"0","1","these were awful! worst brownies. they had a weird texture and the frosting was oddly thick and too sweet. mmmm brownies are much better."
"0","5","Whats great about these brownies is that they are very basic. Whether you add to it or leave it alone its going to be delicious. I added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter to the frosting and din't include the honey (there wasn't any in the house). I also did mix the frosting in a sauce pan, but in my blender with 1 tablespoon of water. I added a handful of chopped walnuts and chocolate chips to the batter. All in all this recipe is the start of amazing brownies that you can make to your tastes."
"0","5","I followed the exact recipe, and they were a huge hit! Yum!"
"0","5","Best brownies is a fitting title! Easy to make and taste wonderful...I added a bit of finely ground coffee beans to the frosting..yum!"
"0","5","Great recipe! Made it hundreds of times. I even mailed them to my husband when we were dating and they were still delicious when he got them. I once ran out of white sugar and used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of light brown sugar. Everybody loved it that way too. People raved that the brown sugar gave it a caramel flavor. I can't speak for the frosting. I've never made it but everyone loves it even without the frosting."
"0","5","These are phenomenal!! Perfect fudge like brownies. Way better then any box. I doubled the recipe but held back one egg and the salt and used salted butter. I also made the icing which didn't turn out very well so I added 1 Tbsp milk and 2 more Tbsp butter. After my additions to the icing, it turned out perfect!!! I love sweet stuff so be prepared for SWEET!! YUM!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT THE BEST BROWNIES EVER. THEY ARE A HIT THEY WERE SO HIGH IN DEMAND THAT I MADE ABOUT FOUR BATCHES ONE WEEK! Very chocolatey and the frosting is so fudgy what's not to love! I doubled the frosting because I felt that one batch wasn't enough, but other than that I didn't change anything else! Great recipe! Thanks much for sharing"
"0","5","Easy and fudgy! The honey in the icing really makes a difference. My family loved these brownies."
"0","5","The best and easiest brownies I've made! Thank you!!! I've done them 3 times this week!!! Everyone loves them!"
"0","1","I made the brownies exactly as written. They were very thin/flat, with a light and cakey texture. Not what I wanted at all. They didn't even taste that great, no rich chocolate flavor at all. I was very disappointed, especially because I was hoping to share them with my lab group at our weekly meeting, but I don't think I should. Also, 25 minutes is WAY too long. I only cooked them for about 20 min, and they were still slightly overcooked."
"0","5","You should have seen my husband's expression when he took his first bite of these! It was like, 'Where have you been my whole life?!' Best I've ever had, that's for sure!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe!  I made these brownies without the frosting, and they tasted great! They were easy, but when I baked them, I had to add an extra 15 minutes to the baking time before they were done. besides that, these brownies were a hit!"
"0","5","I didn't make the frosting but it turned out good; in fact I made 2 batches. Everybody loved it!"
"0","5","I made this recipe for a Super Bowl party (and because I was craving brownies!). Everyone raved about them!!! They are super good and very easy. I forgot to frost them while they were still warm, so just warmed them up very slightly in the oven while I was preparing the frosting, and had no problem. Be prepared, though, as the frosting begins to set up quite fast - spread quickly! Be careful not to overbake the brownies either. You'll never use another brownie recipe again after trying this one!"
"0","5","These are fantastic. I have made them twice now and both times they have turned out sooooo good."
"0","5","I am a devote brownies lover and never have I had brownies this good. The icing is the best I have ever tried. If you like brownies, this is the one for you. I was going to add chopped pecans, but forgot them, will add them next time. There will be a next time soon for sure!"
"0","5","easy to make and frosting the bomb"
"0","5","I doubled this recipe and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts and 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Baked in a 9x13' pan. Better without frosting. My new Go-To recipe for Brownies...Thank you for sharing this recipe! Very good!"
"0","4","This has is the only brownie recipe we make now. Family loves it!"
"0","4","It's not 'the best' recipe out there, but it's a good base to start with."
"0","5","Totally loved these. I don't care much for frostings so I took a bit of crunchy peanut butter blended with hot water and lightly mixed it into the top layer of the brownies. This will be my go-to recipe for brownies from now on"
"0","5","just made these- best brownies ever! for a change in this, add 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon & spread with nutella instead of the frosting! SO GOOD!"
"0","5","I have been making these for 3 years and they are truly the best brownies. I usually make them without the frosting. They taste like fudge cake!!"
"0","5","These are so rich and delicious! They are almost like fudge, not cakelike. And the frosting is to die for!"
"0","1","Ew. 25 minutes in the oven and they were still like soup, with grease from the butter bubbling on top."
"0","4","I was a bit wary given the occasional but vehement 1-star reviews here, but after a friend's recommendation I gave these brownies a shot. They turned out great, and as a bonus I now have a baking friend I can trust!  Cooking time is always tricky with brownies, and I took these out after a long 25 minutes (i.e. forgot to start the timer immediately, etc.). Definitely don't go over 30 minutes.  These guys are chewy but not messy, and they don't need frosting. Give 'em a shot."
"0","3","I prepared this recipe exactly as written and simply thought it was Ok, not fantastic. The brownies turned out great texture-wise but for some reason they tasted noticably salty. Perhaps the 1/2 cup of butter should be unsalted butter, but it does not state this in the recipe that I can see. I will try it again because it is quick and easy, but will definitely use the unsalted butter next time."
"0","5","We love these brownies and make them over and over again. I prefer to use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and a little raspberry extract along with the vanilla. They have never turned out like cake. Be sure to not over mix the ingredients."
"0","5","There were only three people in the house when I left. When I got home the whole pan was GONE!! My mom said they were to die for!! Definitly making this recipe again soon! :)"
"0","5","not the prettiest Brownies but the kids GOBBLED them up!"
"0","4","These came out pretty good. The brownie part itself was great - I doubled the recipe, per the suggestion of other bakers, and it made a perfect 9x13' when I baked it for 22 mins. As for the frosting, I think next time I'll make triple the amount because I had a really hard time spreading it, and I ripped the top of the brownies while trying. I think I'll also make it like a buttercream, instead of just trying to mix everything together at once. Everyone loved these though!"
"0","5","Very easy to make. We had all the ingredients on hand and they were so good. At first I thought they would be too cake like but after they cooled they were perfect. We just made the brownies and skipped the frosting. Better than boxed!"
"0","5","My family loved these brownies! Delicious, fudgey and so easy to make. The only thing that I added was 1 tsp of chocolate extract and I mixed by hand. I did not bother with the icing. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","this recipe is so easy to make and its taste really good even without frosting. my husband loves it, he usually doesn't care about brownie but i guess this one is an exceptional :)"
"0","4","I just made this recipe, and it turned out great! The only reason that I give it 4 starts and not 5 is because the frosting is overly sweet. Next time, I think I'll leave out the honey. I also agree that stirring it by hand is the right way to go, and I only made it with one egg, because that was all I had."
"0","5","Yes! This recipe did turn out, great! I did modify it with a substitute for honey though, as I had none available at the time of baking... So I replaced the honey with an additional teaspoon of butter and two teaspoons of all natural peanut butter (melted in pan first) and boy did this substitute go a long way to complement the chocolatey goodness therein! While I trust the original recipe is excellent, I will indeed 'stick' to the one I developed instead; oh yes, and please do pardon the pun. ;)"
"0","5","My go to brownie recipe."
"0","4","I made these brownies once before without the frosting, because I had used the last of my butter in the brownies themselves. I absolutely loved them without the frosting, and was really excited to try them with frosting. Now, the frosting itself...needs adaptation. I usually use a different recipe for frosting and it never fails, but I wanted to give this one a try. First of all, using the proportions listed, all I got was a big chocolatey, crumbly mess. Too much dry ingredient, not enough wet, not for a frosting. I added a few splashes of milk until it reached a frosting consistency I was satisfied with. The taste of the frosting falls short for me though. I can't pinpoint why, but I just don't love it. I will definitely make these brownies again and again, but I think from now on I'll just omit the frosting. They're perfect on their own."
"0","5","Awesome recipe. And so easy! I unfortunately realized I was out of honey after I was half way through making the frosting, so I just added a little milk for moisture instead. It worked just fine. Thanks for the excellent chocolate fix!"
"0","2","I just made a batch of these because I had an abundance of cocoa powder and wanted a quick chocolate fix. I'm disappointed! If you're looking for fast, easy, extremely sugary, cakey brownies, then this recipe will suit you just fine. However, I believe brownies should be much more dense and a little less sweet than these, so I'm pretty disappointed and won't use this recipe again. Honest truth, they're more like something Mom would have whipped up at the last minute for a forgotten elementary school birthday party or bake sale!"
"0","5","These were great! I doubled the recipe because I could only find my bigger pan but didn't have enough butter to double the icing recipe too so used a doubled brownie recipe and single icing recipe and it was just enough icing! These were already so so sweet. Anymore icing and they would be too sweet, I think. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had! I made these for my class and yearbook club and they were gone in seconds. My school used to give us these gooey brownies that everyone just devoured, anyways these are the exact same. I even had the girl that bakes A LOT ask for the recipe."
"0","5","OMG Delicious. I want be buying box brownies anymore! Had a craving for brownies, and didn't have a box of brownie mix, which I always have. Found this recipe and it was so quick and easy to make. No mixer. Advise is to beat eggs in small bowl before adding to other ingredients, this keeps from over beating the mixture. I believe the secret to this mix is not over beating. And don't forget the icing!"
"0","5","I started using this recipe abouta year ago. I haven't bought a box mix since, and I was a loyal Betty Crocker Deluxe buyer. They come out perfect every time."
"0","5","These are sooooo YUMMY!!! I didn't make the frosting as it looked too sweet. I only made the brownie batter. I followed others' advice about not over mixing. I only mixed by hand. It definitely has a different taste than box brownies and I can't see myself ever buying boxed brownie mix again. It was so easy to make too! I also used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder. Thank you for posting this recipe!"
"0","5","These are the BEST brownies I have ever had!"
"0","5","i just made them and they are very good i sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top and they are Delicious"
"0","5","Made these without the frosting and threw in a few chocolate chips in the batter. Amazing and so quick/simple!"
"0","5","I've seen this recipe for a couple years but was leery to try it for two reasons. One being that I don't usually care for brownies with frosting and figured it would be one of those that are only good with frosting (like the cakey ones). Not so! Seriously so good. Perfect chewy texture and the flavor is out of this world. No need for frosting. I threw in a few chocolate chips and pecans last minute, which was yummy. The other reason I never tried it was that you needed a sauce pan. I figured this meant more work. Nope! So quick and easy. Nearly as easy as a mix and a hundred times yummier. When I first poured it in the pan it looked way too shallow like they would be too thin, but once they cooked up they were perfect. So yummy!"
"0","5","Fabulous brownies!!! I'm not a brownie person in any way but even I couldn't resist them! I made one batch with the frosting recipe and they were too sweet to eat but my second (and third!) batches without frosting were absolutely amazing. If you're looking for a fudgy, non-greasy Little Debbie brownie, this recipe will serve you every time! Do not bake longer than 25 minutes, and allow the brownies to cool completely before you try eating them and you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Angie!"
"0","5","This recipe was amazing. I hand-mixed it, and they turned out slightly fudgy, chewy, and cakey. But you do really have to be careful not to overcook them, or they don't taste nearly as good. They made exactly 16, true to the recipe. But if you are looking for a really chewy brownie, I don't think this is the recipe. I, however, loved it!"
"0","5","Best brownie recipe ever!!!!!! Easy and so good!"
"0","3","I'm going to re-review this recipe. I made it last night and it turned out alright. The brownies didnt seem to rise much and the finished product seemed to have a lot of bubbles. I doubled this recipe as others had suggested and a 9 x 13 pan was just fine for these. The brownies without the frosting were way to salty. Like I said, I doubled the recipe, so that meant I doubled the salt too. Next time I will use 1/4tsp only. I decided to add frosting to these to see if it would improve the taste and cover up some of the bubbles in the brownies. Adding the frosting helped with overall sweetness and reduced some of the saltiness. I did have to add milk to the frosting as well. I will make this one more time in the future. If it does not turn out I will stick to boxed brownies forever."
"0","5","These are loved by all my friends. They will ask me to make them regularly."
"0","5","Great brownies! Did not need to ice them....soft, chewy, added 2 squares melted semi sweet chocolate to the batter...just because I love chocolate."
"0","5","These really are the BEST brownies. My family squeals with delight when I make them. Plus, I haven't bought boxed brownies since discovering this recipe. LOVED it!"
"0","5","I have tried several from scratch brownie recipes, these are the best! I did double the recipe, only using 3 eggs and baked in a 9x13 ' pan for 25 min. They were very chocolaty and chewy. I didn't use the frosting and they were perfect! My husband and kids loved them too! Great easy recipe for a perfect brownie!"
"0","5","Brownies are great! Frosting is a little gritty. Would like it to be more milky."
"0","5","These are so easy, so quick, and so delicious! I add chocolate chips to the recipe. These never last!"
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for 6 months now and it has yet to fail me! It is so simple and everyone LOVES them! Thank you!"
"0","5","Fantastic !!!!!!"
"0","5","I'm not big on frosted brownies, so I just made the brownies without it and they were amazing. Nice fluffy, cakey brownies. I don't think I'll be using another brownie recipe."
"0","5","I made just the brownies, no icing. I added a cup of peanut butter chips to a doubled batch. I probably could have baked them longer than 25 minutes in a 9x13 pan, but I wanted fudgy brownies and heeded the warnings not to overbake! They were deliciously soft and gooey and my word, SO rich. Definitely serve with ice cream or whipped cream! Great recipe for easy brownies from scratch."
"0","5","JUST LIKE BOX BROWNIES! ^_^ NOTE: To get that flavor though, you MUST use margarine, not butter. I tried butter and they came out tasting too buttery. Makes sense seeing as every box of brownie mix calls for vegetable oil to be added, and margarine is about half vegetable oil.  I have been on a search the last couple of months for the perfect brownie recipe. For me, this means one that tastes just like the boxed ones at the store. I LOVE fudgy brownies, and there have been a few recipes I've tried that are too gooey, or more on the cakey side. This recipe is great because it's super soft and chewy, slightly gooey, but not an 'undercooked tasting' mess, even when you cook it ten minutes over(like a Ghiradelli brownie recipe I tried). I love love love, and from now on, unless across my baking adventures I try to bake one and it's better, this will be my go to recipe for forever! ;D"
"0","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Cooked it for 30 mins and no icing. I will never buy a mix again, these are amazing! Perfect, not too cake-like and perfect in every way."
"0","5","Chocolate craving fix!!!! i only have a 9x9 pan so i double the recipe and cook for +/- 10 mins longer until i like them. i love gooey brownies! i added extra chocolate chips too to boost the gooeyness! 1/2 cup Canola or vegetable oil is a good substitute if you don't have enough butter."
"0","5","Decadent and delicious. They were gone the next day! The brownies are light and fluffy, almost like cake. Will make again and again!"
"0","4","very good, but thought the frosting called for more conf sugar than necessary. I added peppermint extract in place of the vanilla for a mint choc brownie and it was fabulous!"
"0","5","I've made this recipe 3 times now, and I heartily agree with the recipe's title. They are the Best Brownies! I've made them with the frosting, and without. Though they do stand alone well without the frosting, I think the frosting takes them over the top. I go exactly by the recipe, but I double it, then bake them in my Baker's Edge Brownie pan. It makes for a nice, thick brownie. These brownies elicit wonderful comments/compliments when I take them to a group gathering. It's good to know I don't need to bother experimenting with any other brownie recipes. I've found THE one. :-)"
"0","5","I made these first just as the recipe specified but without the frosting. I just couldn't get the frosting to come out right but the brownie itself was great. I chopped up some Ghirardelli dark chocolate & mint squares, sprinkled them over the warm brownies and spread it when melted. Scrumptious! A few days later I decided to dress it up a bit more by adding a 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and a quarter cup of chopped nuts into the mix. I used a mimi-muffin pan with pretty seasonal paper liners and topped with Ghirardelli dark & caramel squares that I'd chopped up. When they melted, I used a small spatula to spread the chocolate and topped them off with chopped nuts. They smell, look and taste amazing!"
"0","5","Literally THE best brownies I have ever eaten. I used Nestle Carlos V cocoa powder (kind of like Nesquick!) for the cocoa. The frosting is the best. I used agave in place of honey because that was what I had on hand. These are wonderful!"
"0","5","Delicious. Great brownies. Better than any that I have ever made."
"0","5","Whoever said these brownies were hard or chewy was seriously wrong. I used half apple sauce/half butter, and these still came out incredibly fudgy. I also added about a cup of dark chocolate chips and completely omitted the frosting. A true brownie does not need any! I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Overall, these were very, very good."
"0","5","I just did, they are so delicious !!!!!"
"0","5","If you follow the recipe you should have perfect brownies.I changed it up and decided to swirl in some peanut butter and everyone loved them!I didn't bother using the frosting, they are amazing without them. The only suggestion I have is to add an extra two tablespoons of cocoa."
"0","4","Easy recipe that comes together quickly, using basic ingredients that I always have on hand. The brownie part was very nice, however though I followed the directions exactly, the frosting was unpleasant. It was unspreadable, and much too sweet, and after the brownies cooled and we ate them, the texture of the frosting was off somehow.  Next time I will omit the frosting completely or try another recipe for frosting.  Overall, a solid recipe to replace boxed mixes with 'real' food."
"0","5","PERFECT!!! I used the non-stick spray with flour. My kids couldn't stop praising these brownies!"
"0","5","I make these a lot! They always turn out great. I never make the frosting. I use a non-stick pan so I don't have to grease and flour."
"0","5","These brownies are SO amazing! I made them last thanksgivings for a family member who didn't like pie, and then everyone at the table was swarming over them. I plan on making this family favorite again this year!"
"0","4","Incredibly easy to make. I altered the procedure a little bit - added the cocoa to the melted butter first, then the sugar, then the eggs so that the hot butter wouldn't give me scrambled eggs. Also added nuts (can't have brownies without nuts!)"
"0","4","Thought this was a great basic recipe for brownies. Was too lazy and just did the cream and chocolate method for the icing. My only gripe is the bake time. For me they were borderline cake-like. I think if I shave 3-5 mins. off, they will be perfect. Totally recommend this recipe. I will certainly bake this again."
"0","5","BEST BROWNIES ANYONE HAS EVER TASTED! Once you pop it into your mouth, the frosting begins melt and then when you chew, it mixes with the melted frosting, HEAVEN! It is a hearty, and very chocolaty! With the frosting, I added milk to give it that chocolate flavor a kick, DELISH!"
"0","5","AMAZING brownies! My only issue is the frosting. No way can you spread it on warm brownies. I used 1 Tbl vanilla and added water until it was a thick runny consistency... then I pored it on the brownies. AMAZING!"
"0","5","Really nice, rich brownie. Bring extra milk to drink if you make it with the icing!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! I have made them at least 25 times. Every event I go to people ask me to bring these brownies! I never have made the frosting though..."
"0","5","This was the 2nd time I made these and figured I'll actually rate it this time. I have a group home for teenage boys and these had NO CHANCE in this house! Halloween has just passed and the boys gave me all of the candy they didn't want, which happened to be the HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE miniature bars. I made the batter and put half on the bottom topped it with the HERSHEYS BARS, some leftover walnuts and caramel syrup.I put the rest of the batter on top and added another layer of the walnut, chocolate and caramel. HEAVEN..HEAVEN..HEAVEN"
"0","5","Best brownies ever! I will never buy box brownies again!"
"0","3","This brownie is more like cake - not thick and rich and moist like a brownie should be. If you like a cakie brownie then it's ok."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! The key for sure is to not let it cook too long. My recommendation is to leave a little bit of brownie on the toothpick (as long as it's not actual raw brownie). It will finish cooking in the pan while it's cooling. If you live at sea level, make sure you drop your temperature to 325 degrees and bake about 33-35 minutes. Turns out exceptional! They are NOT hard or chewy or even cakey if cooked right. Key word..cooked RIGHT. Pay attention to your altitude. I put the frosting on as soon as I pulled the brownies out of the oven. Perfect!"
"0","5","Melt in your mouth. My family and I loved these brownies. They are very easy to make and I always keep most of the products used on hand anyways. I made the 8x8 size, the kids & hubby were sad to see them go so soon. They were absolutely delicious. I might try adding a little peanut butter to the icing or mint and see how that goes too. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Amazing brownies!"
"0","5","This is the ONLY brownie recipe I use. Super easy and my kids go gaga over them."
"0","5","Excellent and I didn't even make the frosting which I'm sure would make them even better! Don't over bake or they'll be more cake like. My husband, who is not a huge chocolate fan, thought they were delicious!!"
"0","5","I just made these this morning. I have to say SUPER YUMMY! I cant wait for my husband and daughter to try them. I was nervous about not making the frosting, but they actually did not need it. I made no changes at all. Going for another one right now. Enjoy this very much."
"0","5","i added 1 Tablespoon of half and half and 2 tablespoons of corn syrup."
"0","5","I have made these brownies three times and EVERY time they come out perfectly! Instead of regular white sugar i used 'sugar in the raw' and loved the outcome even more! These brownies are gone within the first day of me baking them; everytime :)"
"0","5","These brownies were great! I read some of the comments and made sure I didn't over mix the batter. I added walnuts and did not make the frosting. They still were great!"
"0","5","These brownies are Amazing! This recipe never fails me every single time I use it. These taste delicious without the frosting but with the frosting is even better...yum. Ill definitely be using this recipe for a while!"
"0","5","I've tried this recipe 3x's and love it! The first time, it came out weird (I didn't measure correctly so my bad.), but the second time it was good, but too chewy for my mom. I added 1/4 cup of flour and it was great (melt in your mouth) !!! LOVE THESE and the frosting! I didn't like it the first time, so I left out the honey the 2nd time, and everyone loves it!!! BEST FROSTING RECIPE EVER - minus honey !!!!"
"0","4","They're still a little more cake-y than I prefer."
"0","5","Amazing, so rich you don't need any frosting!"
"0","5","I really liked this recipe. The brownie part was really good, the frosting was pretty sweet but in a good way. I think these came out better than any box mix I have ever used."
"0","5","This recipe was the first time I'd made brownies from scratch, and I found them to be pretty easy to make. I was a little nervous about the frosting (it was oddly crumbly, and I definitely thought I messed something up), but it actually spread okay enough with some elbow grease and a silicone spatula and tasted fine. I used Ghirardelli cocoa and the results were really good, especially with vanilla ice cream. I'll definitely make these again."
"0","5","I followed the recipe completely and the brownies and frosting came out absolutely delicious. I agree with other reviewers- if you are not looking for a chocolate haven or chocolate heaven... these brownies are not for you."
"0","5","Took these to a party and watched them disappear! Turn off the oven right before they are done and let them sit. Turned out perfectly."
"0","5","This is so easy and soooooooooo good! I can't stop making these brownies!! I didn't make the frosting. I am not a big fan of frosting on my brownies."
"0","5","YUM!"
"0","5","Moist, fudgy, delicious brownies. I didn't bother with the frosting, but they didn't need it. As others stated, do not over-mix or you'll get cake-like brownies. Sift your dry ingredients and mix the wet ingredients separately then combine the two. The batter is pretty thick, but not impossible to work with. This is my new 'go to' brownie recipe."
"0","5","Better than those box brownies and just as easy to make!"
"0","5","Best homemade btownies I have ever made. I have tried lots of recipes, and have never been happy with the results. These are moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
"0","5","OH MY GOD. I read the reviews before trying this recipe I told my self it must be just talk and it won't work out. the thing is I never made brownies before but this turned out to be a very wonderful recipe  I doubled everything and made enough brownies to the whole house  people !!! this is really great recipe u wont regret trying it ;)"
"0","4","These are yummy, but I think they are actually too sugary. I would not put on the frosting next time. Also, they turned out super thin, so I think I will double the recipe next time"
"0","4","I've tried a number of popular brownie recipes from this site. Between this recipe and Brooke's Bombshell brownies, I'd choose these. Other than using white whole wheat flour in place of all purpose, I followed this recipe- batter and frosting and all. You can prepare these in a snap and get some very sweet, dense brownies (as one reviewer mentioned, it's very important that you not handle the brownies too much - leave the hand mixer out of this). They're not really cake-y and not really fudge-y; they're somewhere in between. I might cut back slightly on the sugar in the brownie - use 3/4 of a cup instead of a full cup in the batter. The frosting doesn't really look like your usual frosting - it's a small, thick, grainy brown glob (appetizing, I know). But miraculously, when it's spread over warm brownies and allowed to dry, it's perfect. I'm not a frosting person, but I enjoyed these. They cut well (no ugly cracked tops), and they were easy to wrap in plastic for a bake sale. Oddly enough, the flavor is VERY similar to the recipe that's used by a local haunt of mine, which adds oreos to their brownies. Overall, I'd say I'm pleased with the result. Thank you for this recipe!"
"0","5","I added some milk to the frosting to make it smoother to spread."
"0","5","Do they taste different than box brownies? Yes, and that is something I got over when I went back for my third, fourth, etc. And frosting is not needed. If you think you'll eat the whole batch in one sitting, just leave it off... Uh-hmm."
"0","5","Yummy!!!!!! My frosting did not turn out smooth like the pic, so I crumbled it and top and it was great! They almost taste better the Next day:)"
"0","5","I took a bite from this brownie and I literally screamed out loud, 'Best Brownie EVER!' It's fudgey and chewy. It's also very easy to make although there is some cons to this recipe itself. I doubled the recipe but yet it barley fitted in a 9x9 pan. Also use pan spray that has flour or add flour to the sides. Because my brownies stuck with just regular veggie spray. But try these brownies you won't be disappointed."
"0","5","My God!!! These were the best brownies ever!! Whoever thinks making brownies is a difficult task had better try this recipe because it will turn out just perfect without any problems!!!"
"0","5","With just a little bit of tweaking this is my absolute favorite recipe to bake and to eat, hands down. 1.) Chocolate chips or chocolate chunks are a requisite for all brownies in my book, so I always add some to my homemade or boxed brownies. With the addition of chocolate pieces these brownies are Perfect. Hint: Only bake 20-25min. 2.) Skip the frosting from this recipe. I always top mine with chocolate ganache. Heat 1 cup of heavy whipping cream to a boil, remove from heat and mix in 8 oz. of chopped bittersweet chocolate OR semisweet chocolate chips. Pour over brownies.  Served hot, or chilled in the fridge, these are chocolate heaven. IF there are leftovers I cut and freeze them, and eat them straight out of the freezer. Or, if I'm in the mood for something warm and gooey (think molten lava cake) I zap the frozen bar in the micro for 10 seconds. I love these, and my husband does too. And, yes, we are chocoholics :) PS. I have also used half applesauce/half butter and they are still fantastic."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Sooo easy - mix it up in one pot and bingo, you have some fantastic brownies. I especially liked that you could cut the recipe in fourths (I'm making an effort to bake in small portions) and the flavors remained perfect. I used maple syrup instead of honey for the frosting and it spread perfectly over the warm brownies. Thanks for this recipe."
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly as written, except I skipped the frosting. The brownies were so rich and delicious, who needs the frosting? I'll definitely make this again. Oh yeah, and it is a super easy recipe!"
"0","5","These brownies were exceptionally chocolatey. The only change I made to the recipe was to add one 1-ounce square of dark baking chocolate to melt with the butter. These have a great texture, and I will definitely use this recipe again! Also, I lined the pan with parchment paper and then greased it -- this made it really easy to get the goodness out of the pan."
"0","5","I really enjoyed these...rich flavor with the texture of box brownie mix brownies."
"0","1","I have made these 2 TIMES, once gluten free and the second time normal... Both not good. I am really unsure why all the good reviews, I do a fair amount of baking and these are NOT GOOD BROWNIES. My husband said they were bland and he is not picky. I would not recommend whatsoever."
"0","5","I think this recipe was originally from the Hershey website, it was the same recipe but they recently altered it. It's the only recipe I make for brownies."
"0","5","SOOOOOOOO good!!!! they literly are the beat browines I had ever made! OMG!!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):):):):):):):):):):):)"
"0","4","I made these brownies and thought they were pretty good for non-box mix brownies. I didn't make the frosting since my husband doesn't like frosting. They taste a little cocoa-y, but they have a good texture. Not too cakey like some of the reviews said. I probably still prefer boxed mix, but these are great in a pinch."
"0","4","This is a very good recipe, turned out just fine. But I think it is too sweet so next time I will omit the honey in frosting."
"0","5","Yup, it was a hit. Next time, I'm going to omit the frosting, it really doesn't need it. It'll make it overly sweet. I had trouble spreading the frosting as well."
"0","3","I made these a couple times. Not my favorite brownie recipe, but still very good. It's hard to make a bad brownie! The icing had a different texture and taste to it. I did not make the icing the 2nd time around."
"0","5","Whoever hates this brownie or says its too cake like are DEFINATELY doing it wrong!  I love the texture of it! Just perfect. I have done it so many times and once accidentally added plain flour instead of all purpose.. didn't turn out the same!  Will never forget that. I have done plain brownies.. added chopped walnuts before ( less dense ) and I wanna try pouring in white chocolate chips the next time.   It is perfect without the frosting. When checking its doneness... don't wait for a clean toothpick.. that means it will taste cakey. It should be a little wet.. but no crumbs.. Take it out and leave it to cool well.. Don't be tempted to turn it over blah blahblahh...   JUST LET THIS COOL WELL TILL THE PAN IS NO LONGER WARM and turn it over.. IT WILL BE WORTH IT.  In my opinion... frosting is redundant. I don't see why you need it.  Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream.. its a bomdiggity! :D"
"0","5","I love these! The first time I made them they were gone in one day :D. I melted some peanut butter and added some chocolate syrup to it and drizzled it on top before baking. It was the perfect mix of salty and sweet I was looking for!"
"0","4","wayyy too sweet for my liking (even without frosting). Think I will make them with half sugar next time."
"0","5","A little thick, but still delicious. I recommend these highly!!"
"0","5","Just made these today and they were a huge hit. Three people asked for the recipe! Do not overbake these. I checked them at 20 minutes and only left in for 2 more minutes. The frosting really makes these something special. I will be sharing this one with friends."
"0","5","yum!!"
"0","5","I love these brownies! The first time I made them and overcooked them...not so great. Made them this time and cooked them less and they were great. Didn't alter recipe at all."
"0","5","Everyone loves these and they never last a day! My own grandmother wanted my recipe! Now THAT's saying something!"
"0","5","So easy and so good! I won't be buying mix anymore. I didn't make the frosting, and these were still fabulous."
"0","5","This is the first recipe I've followed to a T and it came out spendid! I LOVE the frosting!!"
"0","5","I've made these dozens of times and they always come out well. The best brownie recipe I've found so far. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","These were great! Skipped the frosting. Had to bake in a 9in cake pan, only took 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Omg! I love love love brownies with frosting, and these are the bomb diggity! I doubled the recipe and it was amazing! Family of four finished the pan in two days!"
"0","5","Absolutely the best brownies I have ever had in my life! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and I took suggestions to double all the ingredients except for 2: use 3 eggs instead of 4 and use 1/4 tsp salt instead of 1/2 tsp. Also bake 30-35 minutes. Make sure to not mix the ingredients too much and you'll have thick, rich, amazingly delicious brownies. Enjoy making and eating these! :)"
"0","5","These brownies are delicious!"
"0","4","These are *very* easy, they taste better the next day...and we liked them a lot better without the frosting. Also use high quality cocoa as it makes a big difference! Possibly 5 stars with better cocoa."
"0","5","Great brownie recipe. Easy, yet Decadent. Great for the Chocoholic."
"0","5","I have tried millions of brownie recipes. This is the best! They are nicely chewy, not overly sweet, and have a deep chocolate/butter flavor.  Bonus: they are easy enough that my 5yo can make them."
"0","4","I made the recipe just as it is without the frosting (cause I didn't have enough powdered sugar on hand) & they are delicious. I will definitely double it for a crowd but like that it was for an 8x8 pan so there aren't as many to eat. ; p"
"0","1","i DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE HIGH RATINGS ARE ABOUT. WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN."
"0","4","My new go-to brownie recipe! Only mistake I made was not doubling it! You cannot go wrong with these, they are excellent!"
"0","2","Easy recipe to follow, but once cooked the brownies were very dry. The frosting however was delicious."
"0","5","I've made these brownies several times. I added walnuts and a pinch of cinnamon. These are the best!"
"0","4","These brownies are DELICIOUS! And i'm not really even a brownie fan. I would have rated 5/5 but when i made the frosting part it was VERY dry and even crumbly. I made these orange brownies by using the juice and zest so i just added 1/4 c. orange juice to the frosting and it made it perfectly creamy. I will DEFINITELY stick to this recipe for all my brownies. Oh, i added Walnuts too and also sprinkled them on the top of the frosting. DEEEEElicious!"
"0","5","I made Best Brownies for my husband's Birthday, as he prefers brownies to cake. Let's just say yummmmmmm. They were a hit! He said that they were 'The best brownies I have ever had'. Our friends and baby sitter were blown away. They are on the cake-ier side because of the 2 eggs, however the frosting makes them super soft. Be sure to double the frosting recipe. I did and it was almost not enough. Great with ice cream!"
"0","5","These are excellent! I doubled the recipe and did it in a 13x9 pan. Did not have powdered sugar so couldn't make the frosting... didn't matter, they were still amazing! Made them for my firefighter hubby and the guys at the station. They raved and raved! One even threatened to try to steal me away... They were a hit, I will never use a box mix for brownies again. Next time I will make the frosting."
"0","5","These are really good plain, I don't use the frosting. I have also swirled a little bit of caramel in the batter before baking."
"0","4","The brownies were so good! The icing however, was not as great. I may just be sensitive to honey but I feel that honey was all I could taste in this icing and it overpowered the brownies. I think if the honey was substituted with corn syrup it may be better? Or just using the icing recipe provided on the cocoa container might improve this. Overall yummy though!"
"0","5","really the best brownies i made"
"0","5","I always have these ingredients on hand, I know I will never buy a brownie mix again. Awesmome!"
"0","4","These are great. This is going to be my go-to brownie recipe."
"0","5","My first time making homemade brownies and this recipe is great. Easy and Quick. I will never buy brownie mix again. My family loves them. My 11 year old daughter uses this recipe with no problems."
"0","5","Best brownie recipe!!! I added some white choc chunks and marshmallows which made them gooey and chewy...so so tasty!!!"
"0","5","First brownies from scratch I've made. I had so much fun making these. No more boxes for me! I doubled the recipes mixed everything by hand in the saucepan in order it suggested. I didn't double the icing and I added enough milk to make it pourable. Pour icing on warm brownies. We ate them still warm so the icing was sticky, but after cooled the icing hardened some. These reminded me of the Little Debbie brownies, but 10x better!"
"0","5","A taste bud orgasm ! I use Rapunzel organic cocoa powder instead of Hershey's cocoa powder. I find Hershey's to be too bitter ."
"0","5","Whipped these up before dinner,turned out great. This recipe is quick & easy. I doubled it for a 9x13 pan. I didn't double the frosting,melted the butter & added a little milk to get the consistency of a thick glaze. This recipe is a KEEPER. Thanks for sharing:)"
"0","5","These brownies were AMAZING! Seriously, the best brownies I have ever had in my entire life! The only thing I did differently was I added about a tsp of milk to the frosting so it wasn't super thick. Will never buy boxed brownies again! Thanks Angie!!!"
"0","5","So, this was my first time to make brownies from scratch! I made them because I'm moving & have an excess of baking supplies (cocoa, flour, sugar, etc.). Anyway, I followed the recipe to the letter except I used a 9x9 pan. In my oven they only needed 25 minutes. The brownies were perfectly cooked, more cake-like, and came out of the pan easily (I use the PAM spray for baking). As for the frosting, I saw what other reviewers meant about the dryness, and found that adding a tbsp. of skim milk worked fine in giving it a good consistency. I also added sprinkles for a pop of color. Would definitely make again and recommend to others!"
"0","5","Fabulous!! I will double the recipe next time I like them thicker than an 8x8...I have never like homemade frosting but this recipe is great!!!"
"0","3","I thought that they were alright. The only thing I did not like about them was how greasy they ended up being. If I were to make them again, I would reduce the amount of butter."
"0","5","I followed the recipe for the brownies, except that I subbed 1/2 cup of Domino Light Sugar (stevia and cane sugar mix) for a full cup of sugar. They were delicious. I like a chewy brownie and these were the perfect texture and weight for my taste... even with the light sugar. I also didn't make the icing because it was for a group of preschoolers. I ate one20 minutes out of the oven topped with ice cream. So good!"
"0","5","Very good!"
"0","5","They're amazing!! My family and I love them, they're always perfect"
"0","5","These really are the best brownies ever. Very good, not to rich just perfect. Defiantly will make these again."
"0","5","Ive made these twice, the first time I overbaked so they were too cakey. the second time I watched them closely and was not dissapointed. very good, 5 stars from me and my crew. thanks for sharing."
"0","5","EXCELLENT RECIPE"
"0","1","The brownies taste good but someone left out the levening. Come on. And honey in the frosting. Brownies sunk in the middle."
"0","5","yummy!!!! That is all I can say"
"0","5","As a self-proclaimed Chocahloic I must say that this is my go-to recipe for fudge brownies...no more boxed brownies for me!:) I have to eat a wheat-free diet (not glutten free though) and I was able to tweek these for my diet and to my liking...  I don't like things too sweet so I cut the sugar down to 3/4c & used Raw Sugar instead of white. I used 1/4c Extra Virgin Coconut oil + 1/4c butter instead of all butter and 1/2 c cocoa (more choc flavor). I used Oat flour instead of wheat flour. Omitted the baking powder and increased the amt of salt to 1/2-3/4 t. Instead of icing them I added 1/2 semi-sweet choc chips...can I just say A-MAZ-ING! My hubby even loved them and he usually doesn't like 'healthy' baking:) After making them the first time I started doubling the above recipe but only used 3 eggs as others recommended.   I also use some essential oils (doTERRA brand b/c they are ingestible) for flavoring baked goods and have used a combo of Peppermint and Wild Orange oil in this batter (about 6 drops ea),and baked them in mini-muffin pans w/papers omgosh these were sooooo good! We took these to a friends house her hubby (also Chocaholic)LOVED them, in fact everyone did, I only came back with maybe 5 mini-muffin size brownies and I made 48!:) THANKS FOR ANOTHER AWESOME RECIPE!!!!:) I will be making these for a VERY long time to come..."
"0","2","I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong, since I've never (before this) had a recipe turn out 'badly'. Might have been the cocoa, might have been the oven, but that wouldn't explain how thin these things turned out - I'm a fan of thick, fudgy brownies, not thin ones that cling desperately to the pan no matter how much I greased it beforehand. Made them twice, both times were lackluster at best. Coworkers seriously thought this was fudge and not a brownie - and not good fudge, either."
"0","5","They are quick, easy, and DELICIOUS! Everyone in my family has agreed that we will no longer be a boxed brownie family. We will be making these from now on. Perfect solid goo-e-ness :)"
"0","5","These brownies are delicious! Although I doubled the recipe to get a thicker brownie. Everyone loved them and said they were the best brownies they've had in a long time! They will for sure satisfy your sweet tooth!"
"0","5","These are THE BEST Brownies I have ever made, I made them for a sale at my daughters school and we were sold out within an hour :)"
"0","4","These are a little dry. It really needs the icing."
"0","5","BEST BROWNIES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! There wasn't even one bite left! They lasted less then 5 minutes at our 4th of July party!"
"0","5","OMG! These brownies are AMAZING!!! I would make them again."
"0","5","So delicious! These would be perfect warm under ice cream, too."
"0","4","These brownies were awesome.. some very slight modifications I made: 1. I doubled the recipe, but used 3 eggs instead of 4 eggs 2. Added a small tad of water (not more than 2 tbsps) 3. Mixed batter with wooden spoon, not with hand mixer, to get a fudge-like consistency 4. In the frosting, I followed one of the reviewers recommendations, and halved the amount of powdered sugar + melted the butter. 5. baked in a 9x13 pan, and not for over 30 minutes. overbaking will make these brownies very dry 6. Added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, and my magical secret ingredient with unsweetened cocoa, 1/4 tsp balsamic vinegar :) it works very well with the chocolate taste. DIVINE! Thank you really.. my dad who is a chocolate addict just loved them :)))"
"0","5","This review is strictly for the brownie recipe sans frosting. I have never made the frosting, so I cannot comment on it. These brownies are amazing. If you are getting anything other than chewy, fudge-like brownies, then you are doing something wrong (most likely beating your batter instead of mixing by hand). This became my go-to brownie recipe three or four years ago and I have never looked back. they are pure perfection."
"0","5","i'm making them as im typing this! they smell very good! super easy to make! and fast too! ;)"
"0","3","This didnt work for me for some reason. I guess that was because i didn't make the icing and i used almond extract instead of vanilla but my family actually loved it and asked me to make it again"
"0","5","They are not cake like. One person send not to mix or whip to much. I took their advice and they came out perfect. I added more chocolate (of course). When I melted the butter down, I added unsweetened choc bar. They were easy and super yummy."
"0","5","These were fantastic. I added a mocha frosting and served it over ice cream. Delicious!"
"0","5","These are great brownies. Not too rich, so you can eat more =) They are chewy but not too soft. Great! I doubled this recipe as per the original amounts, and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan (using parchment paper to line the bottom of the pan). I haven't tried the icing yet though."
"0","4","Really very tasty brownies! The frosting was a little weird as it was crumbly. Maybe use a little less powdered sugar next time. Easy and delish!"
"0","5","yum"
"0","5","awesome brownies! They really do turn out every time, with a moist and chewy centre"
"0","5","I tried this recipe and i MUST say they absolutely DO turn out EVERY time!!!! My family loved these i paired them with homemade chocolate sauce and they where GONE!!!! I didnt use the frosting and the brownies were still EXCELLENT."
"0","1","Not the best, not by a long shot. They're okay, but I don't see what everyone is raving about."
"0","5","Absolutely Delicious!!"
"0","5","I LOVE these brownies! It's been so hard trying to find a brownie recipe to make from scratch that don't come out hard, flaky, too gooey... these are perfect! I'm not a huge fan of honey, but when I substituted light corn starch for the honey the topping was SO good. I recommend this recipe to everyone!"
"0","5","We love these brownies. They are amazingly easy and the ingredients are pantry essentials. My advise? Skip the frosing and just sprinkle them with powdered sugar. The are best when they are plain."
"0","5","Yep, BEST Brownies!!"
"0","4","I didn't have honey so I substituted light corn syrup. I'm not sure I would have liked it with honey anyway. I should have read the reviews before making these because the frosting was impossible to spread, even though I melted the butter before adding it. Next time I will add a bit of milk. I actually have the exact same brownie recipe in my box, I've been making it for years without the icing. It is a nice addition to what I've been making, but like I said I will add milk next time."
"0","5","Super easy bits of heaven!!"
"0","5","This was the first brownie recipe that I made that didn't come from a box. My grandsons couldn't rave about them enough! Getting ready to make several batches for a large community affair. I'm sure they will be the same hit they were with my family multiplied many times over!!"
"0","5","To die for brownies, love the fudgy topping. A friend brought some for a dinner party, and I had to get the recipe from her. These are far nicer than package brownies."
"0","5","These brownies were great! The homemade recipes I have used have all been dry. These were very moist and chewy with the perfect combination of chocolate and sweet. They were still moist 2 days later! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you Allrecipes!"
"0","4","The brownies came out DELICIOUS! I don't know if I followed the recipe right but all I do know is that the topping came out disgusting. The brownies came out really good but the topping just messed it up..."
"0","5","These are yum!"
"0","5","so awesome! made no adjustments and they're perfect!"
"0","5","So great, I made a second batch later on that day! I eyed the measurements, and didn't use baking powder (we happened to be out) but they turned out absolutely delicious. I added a pinch of Cinnamon too for a unique taste, and they turned out even better. Very quick, very easy, and my family and guests LOVED THEM!"
"0","5","Yummy!! This will become a standby! Was having a chocolate attack and came across this. Only change was I used dark cocoa..Wow! Everyone has raved! I did as suggested and did not overbeat. The result-dense rich brownies, slightly crispy on edges...perfect! Thanks for this great addition!"
"0","5","Followed recipe to a 't' and it turned out great. Didn't use the frosting. I took the advice of other reviewers and gently folded the ingredients instead of beating and the brownies weren't cakey at all."
"0","5","Loved them!"
"0","4","Delicious chocolate taste but turns out cakey (though the cakey outcome could have something to do with my using a slightly smaller pan). Does not need the baking powder."
"0","5","PMS pick!!! When you want something sweet and chocolate but feel too lazy to spend a lot of effort, these are your brownies. Very sweet so a small piece does the trick. :)"
"0","4","Very rich brownie taste, and definitely not like a brownie mix from the store. I substituted apple sauce for the butter and it made them more cake-like than brownie-like, but with the same yummy brownie taste. I still made the frosting (which is absolutely delicious so do make it!). Next time I would double the recipe because if you have a deeper 8x8 pan, then it will fit. I also might try doing half butter, half apple sauce, or just sticking to the normal recipe of butter to see if I can get these babies more dense. These brownies won't disappoint! :]"
"0","4","The brownie itself I found slightly bland, but the frosting adds some great chocolate flavor."
"0","5","these are amazing. I added some walnuts and then put M&M's on top and my kids LOVED them. coudlnt ask for anything better."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for now. My husband does not really like brownies but he will eat these because they are not as sweet. Double the recipe; My kids love them. Chocolate heaven!"
"0","5","Delicious brownies. I've made them as is, and doubled them, and always come out great. Watch them so they don't over cook to keep that gooey-ness. One time i did double them and remember someone saying only use 3 eggs when you double....they DID NOT come out as good, and very dry and cakey. Spring for all 4 eggs. We love them with 'Brownie Frosting' recipe which is like adding a layer of fudge on top!"
"0","5","These are perfect! And really easy. The only thing I did different was using dark cocoa, it made them really rich."
"0","5","This recipe was very good; it produced gooey, yummy brownies. I added chocolate chunks and cooked them for exactly 25 minutes at 350 degrees, and they came out delicious!"
"0","5","Very yummy and easy. I may never buy a boxed brownie mix again. I didn't make the frosting, but they were so rich, didn't need it."
"0","4","good, but still not quite what i'm looking for."
"0","5","Best Brownies ever don't change a thing and DON'T substitute the honey in the frosting....so good!"
"0","4","Wonderful Recipe!! I never had a brownie recipe so simple to make and yet so tasty. This will definitely be one for my repertoire. Thanks!!"
"0","5","The were great! A great party treat! I'll definitely use the recipe again! :)"
"0","3","The frosting was too sweet and without the frosting way too dull."
"0","4","These brownies are so good! I did not like the frosting though. Served with vanilla ice cream instead... Perfection!"
"0","5","I make these gluten and corn free! Hands down best brownies I have ever had. Neighbors that are not gluten free ask for them! Fantastic recipe!"
"0","5","I have used this brownie recipe for at least 20 years,it came from my old Hershey Cocoa recipe book.They are the best brownies ever,I have never made a batch that ever failed."
"0","5","Super easy to make. My daughters love them! This is now my fav brownie recipe!"
"0","5","Great, easy recipe when you want a hit of chocolately goodness. Made it with 1/2 cup macadamia nuts, yummm! Instead of making frosting, I just sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top right out of the oven and spread like frosting once they melted."
"0","2","These were super easy to make, but I was incredibly disappointed with the results. The brownies were far too cakey and didn't have nearly enough chocolate flavor--I even upped the amount of cocoa in the recipe. Perhaps I should have only cooked them for twenty minutes; the best brownies are the ones that are slightly under baked."
"0","5","These turned out wonderfully! I doubled the recipe and omitted the icing this time and they were great! I think next time I will try it with the icing. Thanks!"
"0","3","I made these brownies the other night. They don't have much of a chocolatey taste as I would like. Also, they were not done cooking for about 10-15 mins longer than the recipe called for. I would recommend adding shredded chocolate throughout the batter to add more of a chocolate taste."
"0","5","Made these late night before visiting my boyfriend. I made a double batch and cooked them in a 9x13 pan because I like my brownies thicker. Got rave reviews, he said these were my best brownies yet and I bake all the time. The one pot recipe was definitely a good idea and a plus. Definitely need to use a regular knife that is run under warm water to cut them though as they are fudgey."
"0","1","This recipie did NOT turn out well. I may have overmixed these a bit, but it doesn't explain the total failure of this recipe. These were more like dry fudge than brownies, and we did NOT care for the bitter tinge to the chocolate."
"0","5","OMG These turned out wonderfully. My tip don't beat it, hand mix it. They will be so fudgy and yummy. My son says he will never eat a boxed brownie again! and nor will I."
"0","5","Made these tonight and they turned out very yummy. I omitted the frosting (I'm not a fan of frosted brownies, and I personally don't think it needs frosting at all). I sprinkled some white chocolate mini chips as well as some semi-sweet ones into the batter before baking. Turned out great! I might chopped walnuts next time I make it."
"0","5","Perfect!!!!"
"0","2","These brownies were a little to dry and cakelike for my taste. I don't think I will use this recipe again."
"0","5","Oh, so good!"
"0","4","Yummy! These were great and a perfect quick-fix for a girl's night chocolate craving! Will definitely make again."
"0","5","Delicious. Added a bit more butter for richness but overall A+"
"0","5","these are the best brownies i've made"
"0","5","these brownies are amazing after i baked them they where gone in 5 minutes"
"0","5","Very easy. I'm not a big baker, but I had all of the ingredients in my pantry. :) I will never buy another box brownie mix again."
"0","5","Bake 30 mins"
"0","5","These are really good. The only thing I had trouble with is the frosting. The frosting was lumpy, so I added a little bit of milk to make it a little more spreadable, other then that it was really good. Will be making these again."
"0","5","I make these brownies all the time for my family. They are wonderful! Don't wait for the brownies to cool before putting the icing on. Put the icing on when the brownies are right out of the oven because it is very thick. I've learned I need to double when I make them so I can have one the next day. I've also made brownie balls out of these and they are rich and wonderful."
"0","5","Awesome brownies! They were delicious, and so easy to make, especially on short notice. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","4","I made these today. They are delicious although I did make my own changes to make them a little healthier. Instead of 1/2 cup of flour I used 1 whole cup of whole wheat flower. I melted fresh dark chocolate pieces with the margarine and mixed it with the dry ingredients. I slightly beat the egg before putting them in the batter and The batter was a little stiff from the extra flour so i added 1/4 cup of skim milk. these are delicious and will never buy a box mix again."
"0","5","Awesome brownies either a single or double batch. They do always turn out moist and yummy!"
"0","5","I made this for my husband on Valentine's day. It was easy, yummy, excellent. I don't even like brownies that much, but I had some of the finished product, and wanted more of it."
"0","5","These brownies were great! I used dark chocolate cocoa and added 1 T. extra as suggested. Do not over beat or over bake and they will be delicious! I skipped the frosting and sprinkled the batter with M&Ms. Just as quick as a mix and way better!"
"0","5","I stopped looking for brownie recipes when I found this one. Truth be told I've never made it to the frosting and am quite content keeping it that way.  I will never go back to the boxed stuff."
"0","5","Hands down, the best home-made brownie recipe I have tried. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. The perfect blend of cake and fudge brownie. Thank you for a keeper!"
"0","5","These brownies were exactly what I was looking to make. They were rich and decadent. I added toasted coconut to the top to give it a little twist. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone. If you are looking for crunchy brownies then this recipe is not for you. Of course anyone can tell by the picture that these are soft and cake like. So if that's what you are looking for then you've found the best."
"0","5","I just made these tonight and they are yummy! I used an 8 inch baking dish and dusted it with some of the cocoa powder instead of flour. It just looks so much better. Do not over mix/bake. Gently stir ingredients just until blended. I baked them for about 20 minutes. I didn't even bother with the frosting. I can't imagine what happened to those who had problems with this recipe. I've had problems with other recipes on this site and was just about to give up on it until I tried these."
"0","5","Chewy, fudgey goodness! I have been looking for a tasty brownie recipe for years and I have finally found it here! I doubled the recipe and used only two instead of four eggs. Then I undercooked it by five minutes and tada... Chewy, fudgey brownies. I did try the frosting and although it was delicious, it was just way to sweet and rich, so on the second batch I left out the frosting and the brownies turned out perfect. My fiancée has always loved brownies and he even said that these were the best ones he has ever tasted. Kudos on this recipe!"
"0","5","excellent recipe!!! love these brownies! super easy to make and delicious!"
"0","5","amazing! the frosting was a bit hard to spread (I had to use my fingers) but they were truly some of the best brownies I've ever had"
"0","4","BEST BROWNIE RECIPE EVER!!!! These brownies taste delicious BUT they took forever to cook. I had to keep resetting the timer over and over again. The total time was an hour. It took forever but I'm sure to make these again!"
"0","5","Two words...Simply Awesome!  Great for bake sales, and thanks for sharing:D"
"0","5","Wow! The frosting is fudgy-tasting and awesome! I could eat it by itself! I did have to add more butter and nuke it, then I beat it to a high-gloss and poured it on the warm brownies. My family and kids couldn't believe they were homemade!"
"0","5","I love these brownies! I put a little less sugar than what they asked for but these brownies are delicious! They were nice and fudgey!"
"0","4","Wow these are amazing the first time I made them they were gone with in one day!! They are a little more of a cake like brownie than a fudge brownie but if I did a blind taste test I would be able to tell that these were brownies and not chocolate cake. I have made these twice now and I'm very happy with them! Great recipe"
"0","4","I followed recipe exactly, except doubled, but I found the brownie itself to be kind of bland. I'm wondering if I may have missed something. Oddly enough, I think that they might have needed more salt. I am going to make these again, only I think I will put some chocolate chunks in with it. The frosting is amazing though. All in all, this really is a great recipe. :)"
"0","4","I made these brownies and topped it off with a peanut butter frosting- which went perfectly. The brownies turned out good although they were a little too sweet for me. I suggest reducing the sugar to suit your taste buds. I will definitely use this recipe in the future though! :)"
"0","5","Brownies are amazing. I added chopped candied pecans on top of the browny as it baked and then added the frosting. Turned out to be orgasmic explosion in your mouth! Give it a try. And have fun baking."
"0","5","Hands down the best brownies EVER. I add a splash of milk to the icing, then place Strawberries on top and pop it in the fridge.  Make sure to always make a double batch, these don't last long!"
"0","5","These Brownies are awesome......Instead of the vanilla I used Caramel extract.   Thanks for the great recipe"
"0","5","These are perfect! Better than any mix I've used and there are no chemicals, preservatives, etc. I did mix them up with a spoon as another reviewer suggested, and they turned out moist and chewy. I didn't make the frosting."
"0","4","These were awesome! Just before I popped them into the oven, I remembered I like walnuts in my brownies. So I finely chopped a handful & sprinkled them on top. Then gently pressed them down a smidge with the back of a fork. Delish...only problem I had was with the frosting...it wasn't nearly enough to cover the whole batch...but the unfrosted brownies were every bit as good as the frosted ones. I totally disagree with the 'cake-like' reviews...came out moist & chewy!!!"
"0","3","when you make these brownies I suggest you dont put the icing opn them... I did not care for it."
"0","5","Fantastic Recipe. I've been looking for the perfect brownie recipe and this is it. Great flavor and proportions. Do not change a thing. Thanks"
"0","5","awesome."
"0","5","Yes, these are the BEST brownies EVER! My husband is usually pretty happy about everything I make, except my brownies. He always says can't you get them chewy? Now, that he had these, life is good! He has chewy brownies! This recipe is a KEEPER! Oh, and I made them without the frosting..So good!!!!"
"0","4","These were pretty tasty. A little too cake-like for my taste, so I gave them four stars. I didn't use the icing, but I did add mini chocolate chips to the batter."
"0","5","I made these for Valentine's Day and they were amazing! My new go-to brownie recipe."
"0","5","These brownies were really good - great flavor and fudgy texture. We opted not to frost them but did make a double batch. Definitely going to make these again."
"0","5","the BEST!"
"0","5","these brownies are great! i added a 100 g bar of chocolate in with the butter during the melting process and cut the sugar down by half and they're wonderful even without the frosting. i like my brownies fudgey, but to make them more cakey (some people like this) you just need to add a tad more baking powder and they rise wonderfully. this is going to be my staple brownie recipe from now on! :)"
"0","5","If you take your time making them, they come out PERFECT!! I took my time in sifting the coco powder and powdered sugar, also in advance i mixed the eggs together. I WOULD DOUBLE THE RECIPE, because this is a really small amount for such good brownies!!"
"0","5","Always a hit. I make them without the topping and use dark chocolate cocoa."
"0","5","Perfect!!!!I add some chocolate chips and walnuts and my first brownies turn out just great! Thank you very much!"
"0","5","Fantastic brownies! I followed the recipe exactly. Only modification was that I doubled it. They turned out great and I will definitely make them again!"
"0","5","Easy and tasty. I added some chopped home made truffles in the mix because my wife needs lots of chocolate!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe, and I've been searching for years for a good brownie made from scratch. The frosting is divine!"
"0","1","was an easy recipe...it stops at that...I was very disappointed in the taste, it lacks flavor!!!"
"0","5","best brownies ever"
"0","4","Great brownies; however, it seems the recipe for the icing is incorrect. I always have to add a little milk or it is way to thick to even stir. Very rich and delicious."
"0","4","I love these brownies. They are so simple to make. I mix everything in the pot and it's so much less cleanup. These always turn out great. Also, these brownies are great if you ever wanted to add something fun like peanut butter chips to mixture. They have never failed for me. I make them all the time."
"0","5","very moist and gooey...perfect!"
"0","3","These were moist, but way too buttery/salty for me. Might have just been the margarine I used. Next time, I'll replace some of the butter with applesauce and skip the extra salt. Plus, I did not add the frosting."
"0","3","Brownies did come out chewy as I added hershey chocolate syrup to them so they were not too cake like. Brownie was good! Frosting was way too rich and thick."
"0","5","very yummy brownies"
"0","2","I so hoped that I would love these brownies and that they would live up to all the positive reviews. But I will not be giving Betty Crocker the boot with this recipe. As others have stated, the brownies are more cakey than crispy/chewy. Also, there is no way to make frosting out of just the ingredient amounts listed. You just end up with a powder mixture."
"0","5","Wow great cake-like brownies. Made them as written, but had no butter so I used margarine, turned out great. Frosting is great, put it on in blobs let it melt a bit then spread. so yummy! best tip was to put on frosting while still warm. Thanks to Angie for this one!"
"0","5","These were absolutely the best brownies I've ever made! They came out perfect. I doubled the recipe into a 9x13 and I couldn't get enough of the frosting! Delicious!"
"0","4","I made these brownies on a boring Sunday, and I must say, they were great! The only problem I encountered was flouring the dish. I was never too good with flour and I think I over did it, because at first bite, they were kind of bland. I do plan on making these again sometime, just going a little lighter on the flour. Overall, fantastic! :)"
"0","3","I tried making this using applesauce instead of butter and 1/2 cup Splenda/Equal + 1/2 cup sugar as one review suggested. DON'T DO IT. Applesauce does not contribute to the taste of a recipe the same as butter does."
"0","5","I doubled the recipe to fit in my 9x12 casserole glass dish. As previous posters, I used 3 eggs total, and kept the salt to the original measurement.   I didn't have honey, so I used the chocolate icing recipe on the cocoa box. HOLY cow! These were the best brownies we have ever had. I took them to a party and everyone raved about them."
"0","5","Awesome recipe. I prefer my brownies less cakey, like these, and the frosting makes these extra rich. My husband prefers them without the frosting so I use half of the ingredients and frost half of the batch. This is the only brownie recipe I use ever since I found this recipe a few months ago!"
"0","5","Absolutely hands down the best brownies I've ever made!!! Only change I made was to the frosting. I didn't have honey, so I omitted it, and I wanted a creamier frosting, so as I mixed it, I slowly added half/half til it was the consistency I liked. EVERYONE, included my hubby who doesn't do sweets, LOVED these!!!"
"0","5","They are the best, really, haven't tried the topping though, but they are perfect, for the records, i used sweetened cocoa, and was good."
"0","5","I'm my moms 15 year old daughter and I cooked these things to perfection, I think the people who say these are bad obviously don't know how to cook or that they can't follow directions cause these clearly are the BEST BROWNIES... If you can't cook just stay out of the kitchen and hire a chef."
"0","4","I loved these brownies. Most and Duffy, only difference I did was add peanut butter to the frosting. Will definitely use again"
"0","5","Yummy, very easy to make straight forward recipe. Even when using whole wheat flower."
"0","1","I dont know what I did wrong, I ended up with a caved in mess, and it does not look like any brownie I have ever tasted! I thought maybe I did something wrong but I went back and re read the instructions and ingredients and I just can't figure it out."
"0","4","Delicious and easy !"
"0","5","Okay, these are melt your face off good. For those couple reviews I read that said these were not good, I'm not sure what recipe you used cause it wasn't this one. I did have to make a substitution based on what I had in the kitchen. Instead of 1/2 C. butter I used 1/2 C. butter flavored crisco and hoped for the best since I normally bake with unsalted butter for everything. This was so not a problem. I also read where folks suggested to mix by hand, after I had already used my mixer but sparingly. This was also not an issue. No frosting. I did coat my pan with a quick spray of non-stick stuff and then shook a bit of flour and then cocoa powder in the bottom of the pan. These brownies are superb!"
"0","5","These really are fantastic spur of the moment brownies. I don't bother with the frosting...always satisfies any chocolate craving!"
"0","5","Best homemade brownies ever ever ever!!!"
"0","4","Didn't give 5 stars because it really is brownie sheet cake. Really good brownie sheet cake, but sheet cake. Not a fudgy brownie by any means."
"0","2","Too much salt in the brownie part of the recipe. I liked the frosting a lot though...and will be making that part again!"
"0","5","The best and easiest brownies I've ever made!"
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","5","Best homemade brownie recipe I've found. I hate brownies that are more 'cake' than 'brownie.' These are soft, thick, and 100% brownie."
"0","5","OMIGOSH!!!!!!!!!! These are wicked awesome! I am a 15 year old BAKER ONLY!! I ONLY make the BEST recipies and these are WICKED!!!! (definitely kid and mom approved. ) :) :)"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I used cream cheese frosting in place of the chocolate frosting. Very easy recipe!"
"0","1","Very cakelike,not at all fudgy.I didn't make the frosting,possibly the fudgy comes from that.I found them bland,maybe adding chocolate chips would help cause they aren't very sweet and a little dry."
"0","4","Warning: this is for chocolate lovers! So I loved it, but the glaze does make it even richer, so if you don't want ooey, gooey chocolate overload, maybe leave that off. I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was amazing! Except I did add a splash of milk to the frosting - I had the same chocolate sawdust issue."
"0","5","These brownie were DELICIOUS. I'm not a big fan of frosting, so we just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top instead. We will definitely be making these again."
"0","5","loooove this recipe. my favourite thing about it is that you get a fantastic chocolatey taste without using chocolate (so it's much cheaper/can be made with stuff I usually have in my pantry)  like most other reviewers, I use waay less sugar in my frosting."
"0","5","oh so delicioso! These brownies just melt in your mouth.."
"0","5","This recipe is great!! My whole family loved it....i've made 3 batches in the last week. The only changes i made was doubling the recipe the second time i made it and i left out the honey in the frosting and it stilll turned out great :)!"
"0","5","Loved these brownies."
"0","5","I made these brownies for my girlfriends birthday. Now she will probably expect them every year! Added to my recipes box! Really great recipe!"
"0","3","They were .....how can I describe .....for lack of a better word... chalky...needed more chocolate. Maybe some chocolate chips. By no means were they bad. I did recieve some praise at work party"
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever used. I've been using this recipe for almost four years, and have yet to find a better one. I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions, doubling the recipe but leaving out one egg and half the salt, and they come out amazing every time--the perfect combination of fudgy and a little bit cakey. I get compliments on them all the time, and would never switch!"
"0","5","This is definitely the best, and easiest, brownie recipe ever. I have made three batches since I found it last week and my kids and their friends want more. Super simple to double and put in a 9 X 13 pan. The only thing I changed when I doubled it was I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar (if I only make a small batch I will do half a cup of each). I didn't use the icing as I thought it may be too sweet. Thinking about topping them with peanut butter or cream cheese icing!"
"0","5","So simple and yummy! I didn't bother with the frosting either, and I expect them to be even better tomorrow."
"0","5","awesome recipe. just made them and it was perfect! never going back to box mixes"
"0","5","These brownies were fabulous! I baked them exactly as the recipe states, and I figured out what I will do for the next batch. For an 8 inch pan, if you are like me and like your brownies on the thicker side, then go ahead and double the brownie mix. Amazing chocolate taste and texture. I will definitely be making these again;-)"
"0","1","These were not to our liking."
"0","2","I rated these a 2 because the texture is more like a cake than a brownie. The flavor was fine. I did make the topping, but I used 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar. I think 1 cup would be a little sweet for me. You can add more to taste, but I would start with 1/2 cup if you decide to make this. If you prefer cake-like brownies thus recipe might be for you. Also, I did mix these by hand and did not over mix the batter, so I don't think that was the issue."
"0","5","great, taste better than store bought mix, i didn't use the icing, and added REESE'S Peanut Butter Cup chips to the mix they were gone fast."
"0","5","These are simply the best home made brownies I have ever enjoyed. As other people have reported, these are somewhere between a fudge brownie and a cake brownie. Just the right amount of chocolate FLAVOR..not just sweet.  The frosting is super easy, quick and compliments the brownie. It doesn't overwhelm the flavors as store bought frostings can do. I did find that I needed to add a bit more liquid to the mix, so I added a TBSP of corn syrup. I now have only half a pan left, and my diet is shot, but my chocolate craving is gone, long gone...lol."
"0","5","This brownie was to die for. I added more frosting to the top and everyone who ate them, LOVED them. They are very very sweet though!"
"0","4","Always a hit!!"
"0","3","These were just okay. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I found them overly sweet and lacking chocolate flavor."
"0","5","These brownies are so yummy! I can't stop eating!"
"0","5","These were DELISHIOUS! I have never left a rating before but felt I needed to...these are that good and soooo easy. You will need to add a little milk to the frosting to make it spreadable but didn't change anything else! Will never use a box mix again!"
"0","5","WOW! These brownies are great i would make them anytime!!"
"0","5","The Best Brownies for sure!! This is the first time I have ever made homemade brownies and frosting and I think they taste better than out of the box!!! They are just perfect!! I cant wait to share them!!!! Thank u for this great recipe its a forever keeper in book!!!!!!!!!! I wouldnt change a thing either!!! I however didnt use honey simply because i didnt have any. Still amazing!!"
"0","5","For easy as these brownies were, they came out great. I will continue to make them again and again."
"0","5","So yummy. I really thought homemade brownies could not be as good as store bought, but this recipe proved me wrong."
"0","5","Delicious. Easy for this first time 'brownies from scratch' maker. Rich and chocolatey and yummy!"
"0","5","PERFECT!!!"
"0","5","Wow!"
"0","4","the recipe for the brownies themselves was great but i found that the frosting was way to sweet for me i also added peanut butter chips on to which was really good"
"0","5","My husband and I enjoyed these fudgy brownies with the frosting. This will definitely be a go to recipe for us."
"0","5","These are amazing brownies, They are moist and they melt in your mouth... Once you try this recipe you will never buy another boxed brownie mix again. The recipe is super easy to follow. Just don't over mix or over bake. I did make a fudge frosting and spread a thin layer of frosting over the warm brownies which melted the frosting.Once the brownies were cooled my family couldn't wait to try them and they said these were the ' Best Brownies '"
"0","2","You can compare this to a thin, moist cake with decent flavor, but I would not call it a brownie by any stretch. If you're looking for a chewy, gooey brownie, look elsewhere."
"0","5","Yummy! No frosting needed."
"0","5","I made this exactly as it's written & it was EXCELLENT! I will never buy boxed brownie mix again. It even tasted better the next day at room temp, the frosting really adds the perfect touch!"
"0","5","Excellent brownies! They are nice and chewy; just what I was looking for! I used margarine instead of butter and didn't make the frosting since I was using the brownies for a trifle I was making. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 23 minutes."
"0","5","Very good brownies!! Kids love them. I used canned pumpkin instead of the butter for the brownies and whole wheat flower .  for the frosting i used butter and only 1/2 cup sugar.  i think they are better with the frosting,"
"0","5","Couldn't believe the compliments! Stuck to the recipe all the way. People are still talking, four months later!"
"0","5","Yummy! Perfect with a big glass of cold milk!"
"0","2","These aren't terrible, but I agree with the reviewer who called them the best 'cake squares.' They do not have a brownie-like consistency and are not very chocolatey."
"0","5","Superb and very, very rich. I topped them with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from Amy Via and was in a chocoholics bliss. :-)"
"0","5","amazing is all i have to say about it!"
"0","5","this is just what this chocoholic needed. the right texture and taste. This is a rating for the brownies warm as they did not make it to a cooled state. perhaps next time there will be some left so I can chill it and try it cold but probably not:-)"
"0","5","These turned out great for me. I needed something for a block party and everyone loved them and ate 'em all up! I did the exact recipe only doubled, and took some suggestions to only hand stir. I did not double the frosting recipe and only used half the powdered sugar. It was enough to just cover the whole 9x13 pan as a glaze. Will make this again. I think next time I will only use half the amount of honey."
"0","5","OMG. Just plain awesomeness. I did use 1/2 cocoa, and added a little Hershey's syrup to the batter. Also shortened the cooking time by 2 minutes.....just because I always seem to over cook things. They turned out perfectly!!! IDK what they are talking about with the frosting being too thick, mine was very thin. (I had no honey, but squirted a little Hersheys syrup in there too.) These are the best brownies ever!!!!"
"0","5","These are sooooo good! i would have posted a picture because they came out brilliant but they were eaten by my family before i got a chance. next time i'll have to double the size"
"0","5","YUMMY! Follow the other's suggestions for the icing (melting butter) and they turn out really well each time"
"0","5","This are super deelish!! Easy to make. If you need a great dark chocolate frosting for cakes or cupcakes this is the one!! I didnt use the honey simply because I didnt have one! Still tasted absolutely great!!! Thanks Angie for sharing your recipe!!"
"0","5","Best brownies ever! This will be my go-to recipe from now on! I did add a bit more butter to the frosting to make it spread easier."
"0","5","AWESOME RECIPE! the brownies had a great rich taste to them (very dark chocolate taste). the icing was to thick so i added a tablespoon of milk give or take and it was the perfect consistency to spread! thanks for the recipe!!!!"
"0","3","They are edible, but there is every box version I have ever had is better. They have a funky taste and I followed recipe exact. I am shocked at the high reviews on this; I LOVE brownies and was looking forward to this--very disapointing."
"0","4","Very Yummy and a little dangerous;) They would've been given five stars but the icing was a bit hard to work with."
"0","4","I made these on a whim at 1AM the other night because this recipe had the ingredients I had on hand. I was a little leery at first as the batter for the brownies was a lot drier than I thought it should be, but I put my faith in the recipe. Once they came out of the oven, dang! That with the frosting, so delicious. My good friend came over a day later and had some leftovers, and he hates sweet cakey brownie type things, and he swore up and down they were really delicious. He had 3 of them, so I guess he couldn't be fibbing that much.  4-stars! I'd give 4.5 but I can't. Not how I normally like my brownies, but with the ease and simplicity of the ingredients and preparation, and the actual very good taste, deserves more than 3."
"0","5","these were so yummy! they turned out nice and chewy. will make these again for sure!"
"0","4","The frosting came out a bit chunky, but otherwise these brownies were absolutely delicious! I would probably add a little sour cream or cream cheese to the frosting next time to make it a bit creamier and easier to spread. However, putting the brownies back in the warm oven for a couple minutes, with frosting, seemed to help."
"0","5","These are definitely NOT store bought brownies- and that is a GOOD thing. They were very rich, moist, fudge-y brownies that my hubby loved. My only deviation from the original recipe was using self rising instead of all purpose flour and omitting the salt and baking powder. I do not regret this decision, because the out come was a dense, delectable brownie. Oh, and I melted the butter for the icing and added about 2 tbsp of milk to it to make a glaze. Oh my heavens."
"0","5","Wow! the description on these is totally accurate! i left out half of the butter (by mistake) and they still turned out tooootally amazing! i will warn you, if you alter the recipe, the directions will be the ones for the previous quantities...i learned the hard way! ;) but, it's not a big deal, because they really 'Always turn out!'"
"0","5","WOW try with half tsp of orange extract"
"0","5","These brownies (I thought) were delicious! It was so fast and simple to make, looked and smelled great too. I don't know how you can screw these up."
"0","5","I'm giving these 5 stars because not only were they very yummy, they were also very easy. I appreciate that I didn't have to pull out my mixer for these. I was able to prep these in less than 10 minutes."
"0","4","I will never make brownies from a box again, very good recipe. Next time I make them I'm going to melt 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and swirl it around on the brownies before I bake them, just for a little extra chocolate (I love chocolate). Great recipe!"
"0","5","Perfectly fudgy!! I picked this receipe after seeing that over 77k people saved it, and then read the reviews. I saw that a few mentioned the brownies came out 'cakey' but I did not have cake-like brownies in the slightest. My family ate the entire batch (there are only 4 of us) in one evening. Fantastic!!"
"0","5","These brownies were simply AMAZING!!! Delicious even without the icing!!!"
"0","5","Wow, these are FREAKING AMAZING!!! YUM YUM YUM! I followed the recipe to a T and they came out chewy, not too rich, and just all around delicious."
"0","4","pretty good, I would make them again. They don't have the brownie flavor that I love, but they were good."
"0","5","5 stars for the brownie itself - I already had the ingredients on hand and it was far better than brownie mix. Very moist and fudge-y!  I didn't care for the topping recipe though. Personal taste... there was too much honey taste shining through. But a simple topping of chocolate chips, a little milk, and vanilla made these brownies even better. Topped it all off with sprinkles, and I was in heaven!!"
"0","5","These were really good brownies. I did not use the frosting but I did make the brownies without any substitutions. I used a different frosting from this site because I wanted a different look to them. I have to admit I am used to using the boxed brownie mix so at first I was a little shocked by the difference in taste. I look forward to making more of these and making a variation of flavors such as peppermint brownies. Great recipe!!"
"0","5","This is an awesome recipe, and I use it whenever I need some good brownies! :P"
"0","3","Very tasty, but definitely not what I consider to be a brownie. Reminds me more of a fudge...very rich!"
"0","5","So good! Although I advise you to NOT accidentally melt the butter, because the frosting won't turn out right when you mix it with confectioner's sugar!"
"0","4","Yummy, gooey, fudgy and easy too! I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan instead. And used my own frosting recipe as well. Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","This recipe is great! I have made it a few times exactly as directed. It makes a nice cakey type brownie, not chewy at all for those of you who like that type (I do, but this recipe is so good who cares?). Every time I make them and give them out to my friends or associates, someone tells me that even though they don't normally like chocolate, they LOVE these brownies.   The icing is unnecessary in my opinion, the first time I made these I left it off and they were perfect, the second time I added the icing to give to a friend, and I felt it made the brownies just a bit too sweet."
"0","4","These are definitely a good base to help create your own brownie. I did not make the frosting, as it seemed to most reviewers to be terrible.  I would suggest using 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 3/4 cup sugar.  I also added Walnuts on top, and mixed in 2tbsp dried coffee crystals to the batter to make a Mocha type flavour."
"0","5","Amazing"
"0","4","These brownies are awesome! the only reason i gave a 4 star is because I followed some other viewers recommendations instead of the recipe perfectly. I used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar and also I used 1/2 cup of cocao instead of the 1/3 it calls for (I wanted it extra chocolaty!) Because of time, I did not use the frosting and these were perfect just as is! Next time for an 8x8 pan I will double the recipe and make this nice and thick... but they did come out pretty fudgey and chewey on the inside just like they should be! YUM!"
"0","5","Spectacular brownies. I followed 'Bakedbyjen”s advice when doubling the recipe and they turned out great. Im 9 monthes pregnant and this recipe really satisfied my cravings! My baby is going to come out begging for these :)"
"0","5","Really good! I doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13 and did NOT double the glaze but I did half the confection sugar. I don't like really sweet icing. Amazing!"
"0","5","yum!! these were so good and gooey!"
"0","5","Delicious and perfect!! Took me two tries to get it ,but I got it!!"
"0","5","my search is over the're the best brownies lets see i have made them 3 times already family loves them"
"0","4","Good as long as you don't let them overcook. I think the recipe is highly dependent on the quality of your cocoa powder."
"0","3","It tastes okay. But the texture wasnt fudgey or chewy like I hoped. Followed the recipe exactly and wasn't my first time making brownies. Not enough frosting either."
"0","4","I LOVE this recipe. The only trouble I find is in the frosting. I need to use more butter and honey to loosen it up enough to spread. Once I do that the recipe is PERFECTION!"
"0","3","Pretty good standard brownie recipe. I've been replacing butter/oil with applesauce in all my baking recipes and I think it's a nice improvement."
"0","5","Amazing!! This was the first time I had ever made homemade brownies and they turned out GREAT!! I do agree about the icing; it is easier if you heat the icing and you can drizzle it over the brownies!"
"0","3","These were just ok. I didn't over-mix and didn't over-cook, and followed the recipe exactly as was printed. There was just nothing special about these brownies, I didn't even want seconds...and I love chocolate, so does my two year old, and he didn't ask for seconds either."
"0","2","This brownies do not work at high altitudes. I can usually get brownies to at least set, but these completely flopped. I may try again by adding much more liquid, but I was very disappointed. They rose really pretty, then fell to a point where they were brown crackers. At 7000 ft. above sea level, these brownies do not work."
"0","5","A few weeks back I bought some cocoa powder not knowing that I had TWO half-used containers at home. This recipe was great for using it up and I had all of the other ingredients on hand. These are easy and also really tasty, not oily or greasy like some brownies."
"0","5","Best indeed! My kids go crazy for these brownies. They turn out soft and chewy. We don't make the frosting as it's not needed. I will never buy a mix again. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Very good! I added a few tablespoons of half and half to the frosting mixture to make it more creamy. These were a big hit with my kids and husbands coworkers."
"0","5","these are the best brownies I have EVER made. far exceeds a boxed brownie mix....the icing seemed a bit strange because it was so thick and hard to spread but once the warm brownies softened it up it was fine....perfect flavor/consistency for them. Easy to make....will never settle for another boxed brownie mix."
"0","5","Fantastic! Tasted just like box brownies but even better. They were very moist as well- even the edges!"
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for about a year and it never fails: if my brownies are not perfect, I go back to basics and read the recipe instead of relying on my memory. When I could not find my printed copy (wife tidied into a bin) I tried many others on the internet. Nothing compares to this, everywhere I take them, people beg for the recipe (I'm a supply teacher and I carry brownies for snacks about once a month). They deserve the title: Best Brownies!"
"0","4","Almost too sweet! I may leave off the iciing next time for a delicious traditional brownie."
"0","5","Cured my sweet tooth craving for sure! These babies were perfectly fudgey, perfectly sweet. My family gobbled them in one night...yikes."
"0","5","Very good brownies. I doubled it and still cooked them for just 30 minutes- perfectly cooked, delicious!! Not to heavy, just right. This will be my go-to brownie recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is the bomb! It comes the closest to a box mix of any recipe I've tried. Delish! Love love love them! Thank you!!"
"0","5","Absolute perfection! Honestly I made these brownies before bringing to a friends party and they were a hit :). Since then, I've made them several times and every time someone comments on how delicious they taste. I can't thank Angie enough for posting this recipe, all I can do is say - if I could give this more stars I would!"
"0","5","These are definitely the best brownies ever! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, but followed the suggestion of another reviewer and left out 1 egg, keeping the salt at 1/4 tsp and baked 31 minutes-perfect!. I also followed a different reviewer's advice and lightly beat the eggs BEFORE adding them to the mixture and used a wooden spoon instead of an electric mixer (really, it's not like a thick cookie batter or bread dough so it's very easy to just stir with a wooden spoon). My husband LOVED them and so did I!! Thanks for this fantastic recipe-I'll NEVER make a boxed mix again!!"
"0","4","This was very good with vanilla ice cream! Very chocolate-y, almost too much. It was not at all like a brownie you could pick up and eat, more like chocolate cake. Would make again though."
"0","2","Good frosting, but brownies weren't even close. edible, but grainy/sand like. I've made a lot of brownies in the past and this was not to my liking... Made these a second time not realizing it was the same recipe. They just are fudgy enough is the final verdict from everyone."
"0","5","These were amazing! Know that it doesn't make alot though. I will NEVER go back to box brownies. These were so easy as well!"
"0","5","BY far the best homemade brownie recipie out there! I didn't make the frosting, but I did double the recipie, they tured out just like box brownies! Not as sweet of course, but I always found the boxed brownies to sweet anyways."
"0","5","I've made this recipe several times and it was only recently that I was able to enjoy them completely.   While my last two batches were baking, I watched them like a hawk. I baked them at a slightly lower heat than what was recommended, and if I recall correctly, I may have baked them for a shorter time. In fact I took them out of the oven just as they were finishing baking. (I'm learning that everyone's oven is different, etc., in spite of suggested temperatures.)  When done properly, they're absolutely wonderful. If you've baked a batch of these and they turned out poorly I encourage you to try again!!"
"0","4","For those who say this is cake....you definitely overmixed it! I made these last night and they actually taste more like fudge than a brownie. I only used half a recipe of icing and added extra butter to make it more like glaze. They actually were not my favorite brownie...but they WERE very fudgy....so just be sure to hand-mix this batter, do not overbeat (do not use mixer) and then do not overbake, and you will have a very soft fudgy rich brownie."
"0","5","Yum! Made these times 1 1/2 and did them in an 8x11 pan - perfect. Added a little half and half to the frosting but otherwise kept it the same. So good!"
"0","5","The best brownies ever, period! You must make with the frosting, it is to die for. Very fudgy and moist."
"0","2","These tasted like they came out of a box, and stuck so bad I lost 1/2 the tray. Dont bother with these just buy the ones in the box."
"0","4","I have made these twice now and they just keep getting better! As reviewed, trick is to beat as little as possible and also a short cooking time. I took them our at 25 minutes as they are dense and fudgy perfection! I made the frosting this time but really don't feel they need it, and this is coming from a chocoholic. So easy they are actually ready to go in the oven before it has finished heating up. Definitely worth making!"
"0","5","I made a double batch of these and they were AWESOME! I didn't even bother with the icing, the brownies were just perfect all by themselves. The reviewers who said they were too dry must have let them cook too long. These were even moist the next day which is as long as they lasted with my kids around."
"0","5","I followed other suggestions by stirring as little as possible. It took 28 minutes in the oven and was perfect. I also, did not make the icing."
"0","4","Good brownie when you don't have box brownies. Icing is hard to spread. I heated mine in the microwave first. I rather eat the brownies w/o the icing. Too much grease!"
"0","5","We've made these 4 times in 2 weeks! Just so wonderfully gooey and dense, not like a cake at all. The frosting is the best part! Here is what we did differently for the frosting: Instead of honey we used milk, which helped cut down on the sweetness. We melted the butter and mixed the rest of the ingredients in, then poured it over the brownies. It hardened up nicely in the fridge within an hour."
"0","5","These are delicious. They totally don't need the frosting. Sprinkled with some honey and powdered sugar and they turned out great. I doubled it for a 13x9 pan - used 3 eggs and 1/4 tablespoon salt"
"0","4","These were good, but not the best brownies i've ever had. I prefer a fudgier brownie and these were more cake like, but they still were delicious. I cut down the sugar in both the batter and the icing to 3/4 cup to make them a bit less sweet and I added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter. In the icing I added a couple teaspoons of milk to make it more spreadable. I used a 9 inch square pan instead which I lined with foil then greased the foil for easier clean up and serving and they took about 20 minutes to bake with the larger pan. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!"
"0","4","These brownies were very good. I followed the suggestions of hand mixing the ingredients and the brownies turned out very dense and yummy. The only problem I had was that the recipe is too small. I couldn't even get the bottom of my small pan covered. Next time I will double the recipe."
"0","2","The brownies themselves are decent."
"0","5","Awesome recipe but I made a few changes to make them EVEN yummier... yes it's possible!! I added 1 cup of walnut pieces in the batter and instead of using the icing topping as suggested I just topped the brownies with dark chocolate morsels 5 minutes before the brownies were done baking. My husband and mother said they were the best they have ever had!!!"
"0","5","I dont think I will ever buy box brownies ever again!"
"0","5","These Brownies are awesome! To me they are the best Brownies. They are between a fudgy cake and regular browny texture. If your looking for them to be chewy like the box version. Let them cool then stick them in the fridge for the next day. Just baked goods tend to be soft and crumbly. They are sooo chocolatey and chewy the next day. We tried them with I icing and it was good but really it didn't need it unless you like really sweet brownies. Well definitely make this again whenever we want a chocolate fix!"
"0","4","These Brownies are definitely a little cakey but to be honest they're still really good. Who can call a moist brownie a bad one? I also halved the amount of icing sugar and made a glaze... perfect for the brownies. I'll be making them again and then taking them out the oven at about 20 mins (I did 23 this time) in an attempt to capture the 'fudginess' other reviewers have. A good chocolate fix!"
"0","5","Excellent! Only changes I made were to leave out the frosting and throw in a handful of Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips. Baked about 27-28 min and took them out. May not look all the way done, but when you let them sit to cool a bit, they finish cooking. This makes a tender, moist brownie -- very good!!! No more boxed mixes for us!"
"0","3","I don't know what I'm doing wrong with this recipe. The 1st time I made it, the brownies came out too cakey. Then, I inverted the order of the ingredients (butter-cocoa-eggs-sugar-dry ingredients) but didn't like the result.. then I tried butter-cocoa-sugar-eggs-dry ingredients and hated them, they were 'gummy' and sticked to the pan... this time I doubled the recipe and made them just as the recipe calls for, only used 3 eggs insted of 4: they turned out so greasy that you could see drops of butter on the pan after removing them! I like the taste of these brownies and would like to keep giving it a chance, but after making it 4 times, just don't know what to try now... anyone can help?"
"0","5","MMMMMMM! I had a hard time restraining myself from eating the whole pan! After reading reviews of too sweet icing, I reduced the powdered sugar to 3/4 cup, left out the honey and added a little heavy cream to thin it out. I thought the icing was perfect after these changes"
"0","5","BEWARE! Anyone who lacks discipline, it is impossible to eat only one! These brownies are oh so melt-in-your-mouth delicious!"
"0","4","My first attempt at from-scratch brownies & oh, so good. Mind you, I doubled it to fit a 9 x 13 pan & was almost embarrassed at the amount of butter it required (2 sticks!) Given the decadent ingredients, the taste was just that: decadent! Loved the brownie mix, did not care for the over-sweet frosting but the frosting isn't necessary on these anyways. They were that good!"
"0","5","They were awesome! and didn't survive the night lol"
"0","5","I don't like frosted brownies, so I didn't make the frosting, and these were still the BEST brownies I have EVER eaten. Never again will I make boxed brownies. In fact, I've never found a homemade I even liked until this one, and now I'm hooked!"
"0","2","No what I was looking for. Came out to 'cakey' for me, but I did use my stand mixer instead of doing it by hand. That might have made a difference in the texture. I also don't think the brownies are chocolately enough. The frosting has a very 'different' flavor to it, due to the honey. I also had to add milk to make a consistency that was even close to being spreadable. Not something that I'll make again."
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have ever made. I pulled them out after 25 minutes in the oven and they were perfect. The frosting is a little tricky. Just make sure your butter is soft and creamy. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","3","I am only reviewing the brownies. I didnt make the frosting. These brownnies are chewey and cakey both. I tried following some of the other reviews and cut down my baking time but mine were hard to get done. So I had to keep putting thme back in. I was disappointed in this recipe. I also added the chocolate chips as one person suggested. I think this was part of my problem. they are chocolatey enough with out the chocolate chips. This recipe is better than my homemade recipebut I dont think its the 'best' brownie recipe."
"0","5","I made this last night with my 8 year old son and we both said that these are the best brownies we've had. We ate almost all of them! Thanks for a great recipe, no more store bought mixes this family."
"0","5","The best recipe for brownies I've made yet!!! These turned out perfect- the only thing I would do different is double them so they would be thicker."
"0","4","These are so rich and come out perfect!!"
"0","5","amazing! I added a little marshmallow fluff to the frosting. I personally don't even like brownies, but OMG these were absolutely great!!!!!!"
"0","2","bland tasting.More like a cake brownie..."
"0","4","best brownies ever! add some melted fudge and caramel...mmm!"
"0","4","My school-age kids loved this recipe, but I like a fudgier brownie, plus I thought it was too sweet (and I love sugary treats!) Made this for a school potluck, so I needed something quick and easy the night before and this recipe was a snap. There weren't any leftover, and the kids at school wanted the recipe, but I probably will look for something less cakey next time."
"0","5","My favourite brownie recipe. I always make a double batch! The fudge over top acts like a part of the brownie, really completing the batch. PHENOMINAL BROWNIES!!! Trust me, I'm a chocoholic, and these satisfy the ich!!"
"0","3","Ok, this was a good recipe but you have not explained how to make the frosting!!! it was turned out bad for me! you don't just combine all those ingredients, there is a way to do it! Your explanation really is not clear and I ruined my frosting!"
"0","5","Made these today .they are delicious. I needed brownies to make Death By Chocolate....just hope I have some left to make it..they are really good!!! Will make again. Maybe next time they may get iced but they are great just the way they are! Thank you Annie for the recipe"
"0","4","The frosting is what makes the brownies delicious. Without the frosting, the brownies are just mediocre."
"0","5","They were easy to make and turned out perfectly delicious!!!"
"0","4","Delicious but not as chewy as I hoped...a little cakey."
"0","5","I made a twist on this by adding shortning in replacement of 1/2 of the butter. I added almond extract also.. So Good!!"
"0","5","I just made these and they are wonderful. I did not find them to be cake like at all. They are soft and yummy. I did not make the frosting but they really did not need it! I just sprinkled a few mini coco chips and they came out perfect! will make these again!"
"0","4","This was a great recipe, I didn't make the frosting because it seemed too rich and I was right. These brownies are as rich as they come! also they came out a little too soft but all in all these were very yummy!"
"0","2","A lot of work; the box brownies are better!"
"0","5","BEst brownies I have ever eaten! Only there was too much vanilla. So the subsequent times I have used progressively less and less in the icing. I think I am down to about 1/2 of what it calls for. Oh and I added ~4 t. water to the icing as well."
"0","5","I'm not a big brownie fan, but these were fantastic!!!!"
"0","5","just the way I like them, a bit chewy :) This is so quick to make it is my quick desert :) We eat them without frosting and add whip cream instead - yum!"
"0","5","EASY and yummy!"
"0","4","I made these brownies 3 wks ago and it was the first time i make brownies from scratch.. they were good but they took only 21 min in my oven and i had to put them in the mid rack , first day they were good but second day i felt as if they dried up a little. so i will keep searching for the best recipy. frosting, it did not turn out good, i will try to make it again. thanks anyway for sharing your recipy"
"0","3","hi, it was very good recipe, really delicious. I doubled the amount but reduced sugar and it came out perfect"
"0","4","I have never made the icing, but I have made these brownies several times with very good results. These brownies are not at all cakey and have a great chocolate flavor. I find that they are a little gooey when they are first made, but they are just about perfect the next day. The recipe could not be easier - it doesn't take me any more time than a mix would!"
"0","5","Never eat box brownies again.. AWESOME!"
"0","5","Very good! I didn't make the frosting but I will next time!"
"0","5","i followed this recipe as written the first two times i made these, then i doubled the brownie part and used the same size pan every time since. i prefer the double recipe. i mix everything by hand using a whisk and they always come out perfect. i have to add a tblspn of milk to the icing, i'm never able to get it to the right consistency unless i do. i'm normally not much of a brownie person, but these are much moister and chewier than a regular brownie."
"0","5","This recipes is crazy-easy to make and sooooooooo delicious!! I followed reciped with exception of mixing by hand so the brownies wouldn't be 'cakey'. Phenomenal!!! Thank you for sharing such an amazing recipe!"
"0","4","These were great, just didn't really like the frosting. It came out pretty thick which made it difficult to frost. Ended up only frosting half before I threw it out. They didn't need it anyway. Next time I might throw some mini chocolate chips in the batter."
"0","5","I've never made more fabulous brownies. I wish the ingredients made more brownies than it does! I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a chocolate fix."
"0","4","Very sweet brownies, but still full of chocolaty goodness. Best if you wait till they've cooled to eat them (for those of us who are less patient). Chewy and delightful, I might use less sugar to cut back on the sugar or leave off the frosting for a less sweet brownie."
"0","5","I LOVED these! I made them for thanksgiving, they were very easy to make and tasted amazing! I baked them in a mini cupcake pan and instead of covering them in the chocolate (which looks amazing! I'll try that next time too) I let them cool, popped them out of the pan and put about 4 at a time in a big zip-lock bag of powered sugar (confectioners sugar)! They were AMAZING I just loved them, I only powdered half of them because some people didn't want them with powdered sugar. They were great both ways and I can't wait to make them again! Wonderful recipe!!"
"0","5","I added 4 T instant coffee for just a little richness. A 60 year old man I barely know confessed they are the best brownies he has ever eaten! I made the mistake of doubling the recipe for a big pan - much better to keep recipe as is and keep brownies thinner."
"0","5","These are DELICIOUS (and I didn't even use the icing)!!! I followed the recipe as written. Another time, to make this more Christmas-y, I poured half the batter into the pan, then a layer of After Eight mints, then the rest of the batter. Cook time is the same but they end up super moist and minty. Yum!"
"0","5","this was by far the best brownie ever!!! i doubled the recipe my guests absolutely loved them!!"
"0","5","Awesome Recipe!"
"0","5","This was my first time making brownies since I come from Europe and I have to say they are AMAZING! I put a bit less sugar because I don't really like really super sweet things and they turned out great! And I love the edition of honey in the frosting it gives the brownies the best taste ever! Love it!"
"0","4","These have become my go-to brownies! I absolutely love them. If I want nice 'chewy' brownies, I make sure to use real butter, and they turn out perfect. Cake like brownies, I used margarine instead and get a nice cakey brownie. I've added mini chocolate chips to em, topped them with a peanut butter drizzle and even used these as a base for cheesecake I made. Everyone loves 'em. Great and quick treat to make when ever I get a sweet tooth."
"0","5","These are amazing. My husband is a brownie fanatic and I've always bought the ones in the store until I tried this recipe. Now these are the only ones he'll eat. My 16 yr old thinks the frosting makes it too sweet but the rest of the family loves them!"
"0","5","Super easy! I've made them 3 times in the last 2 weeks and they're always delicious!"
"0","3","They are okay, but a little sweeter would be better. I didn't have frosting cause that seemed like cake instead of brownies."
"0","4","Great recipe! The icing needed a little bit of milk added, I found it wasn't smooth enough without it. Other than that, I had to cook them for almost 45 minsutes before they were actually done. All in all, good brownies!"
"0","5","These brownies were great! They were exactly what I expect in a brownie, but I do agree with many people that the icing, though yummy, is not needed. The only change I would make would be to use less of it next time."
"0","5","These are AMAZING! I put walnuts in and I also add a bit of milk to the frosting. YUM!"
"0","5","I am ridiculously pregnant and am craving brownies like never before. I made these for a romantic dinner for my hubby and I, however they didn't even make it till he got home from work. These are soooooooo good and I thought they were just fudgy enough. Great recipe thanks for sharing."
"0","5","These brownies are fantastic! They come out with a crispy outside and on the inside they are so gooey and fudgy! I will never use a box again, they are way too simple and yummy!"
"0","1","The best way to describe these brownies is they just didn't work! I followed the recipe exactly; there was only a small section of the pan that was cooked, even after 30 min. The part that did cook tasted great, but you can't serve a pan of goo with a small center of brownies. Save yourself time and find another brownie recipe!!!"
"0","5","Last night I needed a brownie fix. This was it! I have all these ingredients on hand most all the time. This recipe is also awesome if you make your own ice cream and like it with brownie pieces mixed in and fudge swirls!"
"0","5","These brownies were sooo good. I used duck eggs which gave it a very rich flavor. I also may have cooked the sugar and butter too long but it gave it a sort of caramel flavor that the kids loved. Making another batch today."
"0","5","I just made these... And all I have to say is that they were AMAZING. So good! I didn't make the frosting but next time I make these brownies, I'll most likely make it."
"0","5","This is my favorite brownie recipe ever! I've made it way too many times to count. Tonight we added a twist. I threw in about a half cup of peanut butter chips. It was to die for! And as the title pages says, 'These brownies always turn out!' It's true!"
"0","5","I do love this recipe, it is also listed on the hershey website."
"0","5","Great recipe, I never even used the frosting. A good balance between cakeyness and fudgyness. I would like to point out something very important to the success of this recipe: DO NOT USE TOO MUCH BUTTER!!! If you use too much butter they will be hard and gooey- I say this because when you open sticks of butter they sometimes tell you the measurements- but those are if the butter if MELTED. You want a 1/2 cup of SOLID butter, not melted. So if the company says '1/2 cup' on the stick- you should probably use HALF that. I'm pointing this out b/c some people are saying the texture was hard and awful- I screwed up that way with the butter so I know why LOL."
"0","5","This is an awesome recipe!! It's such a nice mix between fudgy and cake-like brownies with fantasticly crispy sides. I doubled the recipe, using one less egg and baked it for 30 minutes in a dark metal pan. I also added chocolate chips right before baking. I will definitely be making these again!"
"0","5","I've been using this recipe for years. It is my 'standby' dessert recipe if I need something quick to make, and it always gets rave reviews!! These brownies are super easy to make, moist and delicious but not too rich. Its hard not to eat the whole pan! The only thing I change is to add about 3-4 tbsp of honey to the icing as I find it makes a more unique tasting icing, and 2-3 tbsp of milk to get it to a thick but spreadable consistency I ran out of cocoa powder once and didn't have enough for the icing so I left it out and and ended up with a delicious vanilla honey icing!"
"0","1","These were not good brownies. Followed them exactly, look NOTHING like the picture and they were flat and thin. i even tried adding chocolate chunks and that didn't help."
"0","4","I've made these several times...maybe 4. Got EXCELLENT brownies the second time around but the other times have been just blah. Haven't figured out what I'm doing differently but I will definitely try again."
"0","2","Wow. Normally, the negative reviews on this site I have found to be taken with a grain of salt as most of my highly rated recipes come out fairly well. I have to say that as far as brownies go, this recipe wasn't really a recipe for brownies so much as it was a recipe for cake. It said explicitly in the recipe to not over bake them, and maybe that's where I went wrong, because they're light and fluffy. While tasty, they weren't what I expected. I might give it another go, though, simply because they ingredients are easy and it was still edible, and try harder for this 'brownie' I was supposed to end up with."
"0","4","Very rich, fudgy, thick brownies w/a shiny top. We actually still prefer tweaked boxed brownies but these were a good sub since I didn't have a mix on hand."
"0","4","This makes for a nice cakey brownie, like others have said. I like mine a bit cakey, so hey, whatever. The results are delicious! The frosting is, like others have said, in need of a tablespoon of milk/cream to get it properly combined... but after that point, yum! Sweet and chocolatey and easy! I'll be making them again."
"0","5","Put peanut butter chips in mine, these are phenomenal brownies, thanks!"
"0","5","Moist, fudgy and super chocolatey! I cut down the cooking time considerably because at about 15 minutes they seemed to be done. They were so amazing I had to make a second pan because the first one was gone too fast!"
"0","5","I made these brownies tonight, followed the exact recipe. They really are very good!"
"0","4","Were easy too make, but had more of a cakey consistency rather than fudgey, even with minimal mixing. The frosting was great even though I was a little skeptical about the honey. You may need to heat the frosting up a little bit to be able to spread it easily"
"0","4","Next time I make these, there will definitely be a couple small changes, but they are VERY good. I'll do a bit less sugar, a touch more salt, and maybe just a BIT more baking powder (it is possible that my baking powder is a touch old and that could've contributed to my displeasure)... also, i'll likely decrease the butter. The cocoa and flour, eggs, and vanilla are all good proportions. I did a double batch in a 9x13 for 30 minutes (it could have used a couple more minutes, but they were starting to fry a bit thanks to ALL that butter), using 3 eggs and 1/4 tsp of salt. Lightly beating the eggs before adding them is definitely the way to go. I stirred all the sugar in before adding the eggs, but I sort of wish I'd added those both together all at once. Next time I'm sure it'll be way better. VERY easy recipe, though."
"0","4","The brownie batter is amazing, the frosting needs a little doctoring up."
"0","5","soooooo yummy :) I have a cake recipe exactly like this and now I have the brownie version. It's so hard just eating one! I didn't make the icing otherwise it would have been too sweet. 'Box brownies' may be easy to make but these brownies are worth the extra effort to make. I made mine in my toaster oven"
"0","1","they instantly caved in and they burnt around the edges before the inside even came close to being done. i do not suggest these. they taste of burnt sugar."
"0","5","These are great! They are even good without the frosting!"
"0","3","I don't know how they would have tasted had I made the icing, but they came out a bit bitter for me. Bitter brownies aren't bad, per se, but when I made my orange-flavored icing on top, it made them so much better. They did turn out a bit more cake-y in my opinion. Next time, I'll be adding a bit less unsweetened cocoa to the mix."
"0","4","I greatly enjoyed the texture and flavor of the brownies; they are not extremely thick, but I really like a cake-ier brownie. I doubled the recipe and used four eggs; using three would probably make them chewier. I found the frosting to be to sweet for my taste but the flavor is very nice and my husband enjoyed it. Next time I'll skip the frosting; the brownies are good enough on their own."
"0","5","My advice is for you to double the recipe. This brownie is delicious! Did not change anything, it came out perfect! Just like the picture! I won't ever buy box brownies again!!"
"0","5","Very good! Quick and easy. I did not have honey and the frosting was still just right for the brownie."
"0","5","These are FANTASTIC! I didn't have any cocoa so I used 2 oz. of melted unsweetened chocolate instead and only used 1/3 cup butter. I also added some milk chocolate chips. I only baked them for 20 minutes. They were so chewy and they're definately at the top of my list!!!"
"0","4","These were okay. Maybe we overmixed them, because they sunk in the middle and at 30 minutes with a toothpick test, they didn't seem done, so we left in the oven another 5-10 minutes (we made two separate batches)."
"0","3","These brownies turned out VERY thin - like, 1/2' thick. They had a great flavor, but were a little chewy and just way too thin. I like by brownies a little thicker. I think next time I will double the recipe and use the same size pan. I didn't make the frosting b/c I don't like frosting."
"0","5","So delicious- the frosting recipe is a little tricky- but the honey really adds a good flavor- i would check the brownies five minutes before- because it is key to not overcook- great texture- so delicious!"
"0","5","I have been making this recipe for years now...even my 14 year old knows it by heart. It IS the BEST BROWNIE EVER!!"
"0","5","Best brownies ever!"
"0","3","I was so disappointed with this brownie after reading all the positive reviews. I cooked it *less* time than recommended, and it came out drier than I would have liked. (I can't imagine if I left it in the full time, it probably would've been inedible.) Also, the frosting recipe - I added in a 1/4 cup of light cream because the original recipe produced too dry a mixture, and the cream made a huge difference, it was delicious."
"0","3","satisfied my chocolate craving but not the brownie i was hoping for. very cakey-no crunchy, chewy edges and gooey center here. i gotta find my other brownie recipe."
"0","5","I love this recipe. Although they are better when made with butter, I use vegetable oil instead to cut down on the saturated fat. They are still delicious."
"0","5","I have never liked homemade brownies till now!"
"0","5","Easy to make and delicious"
"0","5","These are great brownies! So easy to make and not a lot of cleanup afterwards to which is always nice! They are so amazing, and the brownie mix before cookies is good to ;)"
"0","5","Super easy! Wouldn't change a thing."
"0","4","This still came out a bit cakey, even though I did not use a mixer and just stirred with a spoon. I did double the recipe and cook in a 9X13 pan. Wasn't sure if I was going to like the icing or not, so I only put it on half. I definitely prefer pure brownie, no topping needed. Still a very good brownie recipe, just needs a bit of tweaking I'd say. I may try to omit the butter next time and try something like olive oil or sour cream."
"0","5","delish!!!! didn't make the frosting just sprinkled the with powdered sugar, they where amazing!!!!!"
"0","5","I have made this twice this week since finding the recipe and the kids and I loved it! I sprinkled chocolate chips ontop before baking instead of using the frosting recipe. Be sure not to over mix and not to over cook!"
"0","4","I think these are pretty good! I have never had homemade brownies before so this was a first for me! I didn't have unsweetened cocoa just regular cocoa so not sure what the difference really would have been, but next time I think I would use just a bit more cocoa. Other then that they are great!"
"0","5","Easy recipe, and delicious brownies! I'm saving this now!"
"0","5","I fix this recipe often everyone Loves it Very easy"
"0","3","The recipe turned out ok for me, instead of using the baking powder I used baking soda, after I realized my mistake I added it. They tasted ok, but over the next few days I will do it again the right way."
"0","5","I made these and ate them the next night - they were a huge hit! And they were super EASY!!!"
"0","5","I have tried SO many different brownie recipes, this one is my all time favorite. Period. Moist, thick, and the frosting on top makes it one thousand times better. Loved this recipe, and I give it to everyone I know!!!!!"
"0","5","This was probably the best batch of brownies EVER made! The topping makes the dish for certain, with the honey and vanilla - very rich - super tasty. This one will be made over and over again! THANK YOU!"
"0","5","soooo good! doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 since I didn't have an 8x8. hate when that happens :( will use a little less sugar next time maybe but other than that it's perfect as is!!"
"0","5","These were so easy to make. I left out the honey so they wouldn't be so sweet and used half sugar, half Splenda and they were great. I will definately make these again. Thank You"
"0","5","These were great! I didn't make the frosting though. Still great brownies!"
"0","5","OK - these are as awesome as everyone says they are! I didn't mess with the ingredients at all, but I didn't have a square pan (my meatloaf was in it) so I bake it in a 9 inch round cake pan. AMAZING! The icing for the brownies was scary for a bit. The wet ingredients seemed to outnumber the dry ingredient... but I went with it and grabbed my electric hand mixer. After a few seconds the icing was still very powerdery, dry and crumbly, but after a while the icing sugar started to absorb the butter and it became this awesome icing. It was a bit stiff - sort of like icing from a can - but once I put dollops down on top of the warm brownies it warmed up and was very easy to spread. One thing that I was afraid of was the brownies being to dark chocolatey... but they are just right for me! I will definitely be making these again."
"0","2","These brownies were more cake-like than brownie-like. I want brownies to be chewy, but these were soft and light. I liked the frosting, but I will not be making these brownies again."
"0","3","These brownies are very, very good, with the big caveat that they are not really 'brownies', so much as 'cake squares'. If you're not a stickler, then they're pretty good.  I made a few modifications: I substituted apple butter for some of the sugar. I also substituted coconut milk for some of the butter, but I believe I ended up with them slightly too sweet, so some tweaking is necessary."
"0","5","Love the brownies, nice flake on top and gooey insides. Will try another after they cool down. I did make a couple of additions, I did spray & flour the pan, then dusted it with cocoa powder, and I added about 1/2 tsp of ginger & cinnamon (on double recipe). Will make them again for sure."
"0","1","these brownies seemed like they would be good if the ingredients were correct. I followed to recipe exactly and all I could taste were vanilla and sugar. They were SO sweet. You should think about tweaking it a bit to your liking."
"0","4","i thought these brownies were good. wouldn't say they were best brownies i've ever had. they were a bit dry and not as moist as i was hoping for but still really delicious. also loved the frosting."
"0","4","I don't know if they're THE BEST.. but they don't suck!"
"0","4","yummy! Very easy to follow recipe - Try adding caramel and walnuts as a variation."
"0","4","Although these brownies are not the 'best brownies' I've ever had they are pretty good, and so easy to make! I made these with out the frosting a few times and they were a hit! I made a double batch once and they were a bit salty, so I would recommend only using the regular amount of salt if you double it. Will make again."
"0","5","Yummieeeeeee. Quick, easy and I melted the butter in the microwave. Baked in less than 20 minutes in my oven and eaten shortly after that by the family."
"0","4","These were very easy brownies to make and very good! I did not make any changes to the brownies and thought the frosting was very good!"
"0","5","I never review anything, but I had to write something about this one. this is finally the fudge, chewy brownie I have searched for. Th key is to not over mix it. I just stirred with a spoon. Also don't over cook, 25 mins was fine. And let it COOL, if you want the fudgy, chewy texture. Its slightly cakey right out of the oven but its not at all once it cools."
"0","4","These Brownies are delicious! I made them with apple sauce instead of the butter, they turned out so moist. The frosting tasted like fudge...yumm!"
"0","3","These were fine. Very sweet and easy to make, but much too chocolaty and rich for my taste."
"0","3","I'm not sure how to review these. Not worth the trouble? They were more like little pieces of rich, moist chocolate cake than they were brownies. I don't know how they would be without the glaze, but there is something wrong with the glaze recipe. I got a crumbly mess and had to add about 3 T. milk in order to make it spreadable. They tasted good, especially the next day, but there is definitely something wrong with the recipe. I'll try another one next time."
"0","5","Delicious and decadent! I only used about 2/3 c. sugar and they were perfect. I'm reluctant to call these 'brownies' because the texture was somewhere in between brownie and cake...not fudgy but not cakey. Somewhat dense, yet still light. Amazing is what I'll call them."
"0","5","Literally the best brownies i have ever made. i followed wat others had said in not using an electric mixer and not overcooking it, and they come out like heaven. despite what some have said THESE ARE NOT CAKE BROWNIES. everytime i make them, they come out EXTREMELY fudgey. my family absolutely adores them. i double the recipe, and even though it makes a huge amount, we still run out fast"
"0","5","Just made these. A few changes: I only had one stick of light butter.. so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup OlivExtra. (so I would have butter for the icing!) I was going to skip the icing but boy am I glad I didn't!!! Also, I only used 1/2 cup powdered sugar after reading reviews. These brownies turned out AMAZING, not cake-like at all. Gooey and decadent, these are THE BEST brownies if you follow the recipe, don't over mix or over cook. Next time i might add some walnuts! I will never buy brownie mix again. Thank you so much for the great recipe Angie!"
"0","5","I don't see why some people find these cakey... If u make them right they are very dense and brownie like... And to the person who said when you think of brownies you think of hard and chewy, idk where you are from but I've never heard hard associated with any brownies unless they were over baked. If you wanted hard chocolate then eat a candy bar."
"0","5","Yum! Just made these for dessert and they are gone. Added milk to frosting to make smooth, but that was the only addition. Loved and devoured by all."
"0","5","I've made this recipe twice in one week now and it's just wonderful! My kids loved it and so did I. These brownies were moist and in no need of frosting, so we didn't bother to make it."
"0","4","Great flavour, but a little to cake like for me. I doubled the recipe and baked for 30 mins. Maybe baked too long."
"0","5","AWESOME! By far the chewiest, moistest, gooeyest homemade brownies I've ever made. Only change I made was to use 1 egg rather than 2. Thank you!!"
"0","2","If you like fudgy box brownies, then these are NOT for you. These are dry and spongy. They taste more like cake."
"0","4","I made these exactly as written however I did not have any honey for the frosting but it still turned out tasty without it. The brownies were very tasty and I will make again!"
"0","5","These brownies are a bit more cakey then I normally like but....omg they are great!.... Love them thanks for sharing......mmmmmmmmmmm"
"0","5","We love this brownie recipe as is, and we love to use it in our brownie cheesecake recipe! thanks!"
"0","5","AWESOME!!!!! I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, it kind of balances out the sweetness. My hubby and I ate the whole pan in one day! (and that was without the frosting)"
"0","5","Exceptional!"
"0","5","These turn out perfectly every time I make them! I always throw a handful of chocolate chips on the top just before baking, it adds a little extra yummy-ness (:"
"0","3","Well, my brownies are still cooling, but at this point, I have a word of advice for the frosting... Wait until they're just WARM... and not fresh out of the oven!! I just frosted my hot brownies, and the frosting melted right on... who knows. they might still turn out. OH, and I mixed in 1 1/2 tbsp of peanut butter into the frosting... AMAZING!!"
"0","2","I made these exactly as the recipe states and they came out of the oven looking lifeless and dull. The taste is okay, mediocre at best. Not sure what went wrong since it has such rave reviews. I did give it two stars as a benefit of the doubt - I may have mixed it too much putting too much air in the batter. Either way, it's highly unlikely that I will ever make these again. I should have known better."
"0","5","Very good & very rich which is just what I was craving. Frosting is thick - topped brownies right out of the oven to allow it to get soft enough to spread. Only change I made was to add hickory nuts on top of the frosting. Yummy!"
"0","5","used margarine vs. butter. pulled out of the oven and they looked cakey; i was sad. i waited 15 minutes for them to cool and good God, they were perfect. i just ate a whole row, and then stared at my treadmill. thank you, angie."
"0","5","Wonderful, easy recipe. For extra awesomeness, use coarse sea salt. The exotic crunch made good brownies phenomenal!"
"0","5","Excellent. Didn't bother to frost."
"0","5","Delicious! Added about a T of milk to the frosting. It was thick, but melted down when I spread it on the warm brownies."
"0","5","This are delicious :) I didnt make the topping because the brownies itself are sweet enough. Putting them in the oven for 27mins were PERFECT :)!"
"0","5","I made these tonight and they are GREAT. I added some chopped pecans and I can't stop eating them!"
"0","4","Slightly bitter, but great texture. LOVE the frosting. So good! Will definitely try this recipe again, perhaps with more sugar and or honey."
"0","5","This recipe worked out great! It was all stuff I had around the house anyway and they turned out super rich. Only thing i changed was I added a bit more butter to the frosting, I think I did the better part of a whole stick rather than 3 tablespoons, otherwise the frosting didn't have enough liquid."
"0","1","I was excited to make these for my boyfriend... I followed the recipe perfectly and they turned out to be disgusting. They were cakey rather than fudgy and the icing was WAY too sweet (and i usually love sweet desserts!) Very disappointed :("
"0","5","I cooked this recipe yesterday and it was perfect! Mine didn't come out as fudge-like as I wanted, but that's not the recipes fault- I cooked it 27 minutes instead of 25. Still, they came out really great and somewhat fedge-y and everybody loved them! I will definitely be making this recipe again- it is delicious!"
"0","5","These are REALLY good brownies. Mine came out tasty and very moist...I actually made them 3 days ago and they're still not dry, and I'm not the best baker out there. I made these following the recipe exactly, (minus the frosting) and they're delicious!"
"0","5","I made these yesterday to bring to a BBQ and they were delicious!!! I've never made brownies before (even out of the box!) and these were perfect! The cooking time was quite a bit less for me-but my oven cooks everything faster...and I think putting the frosting on while warm is a key step-we also put them in the fridge for about an hour or so so they would set and we could cut them to bring along. One comment I received is, 'these have the prefect amount of melt-in-your-mouth-goodness!' They ended up tasting like those Little Debbie soft brownies-only fudgier and gooey-er! I added walnuts to the top and also a bit of milk to the frosting as suggested-as it was rather thick. These are fabulous!"
"0","5","These brownies are fantastic. Unlike some of the other reviews that I read they do not taste different than store bought....they just taste better and my 4 1/2 year old agrees!They do not turn out like cake if you do not over bake them. My oven cooks hot and I started checking them at 15 minutes and they came out gooey, chocolatey and delicious. My only suggestion is to make a double batch because they will not last the night!"
"0","5","ok! so! i of course skipped the frosting because my mom and lil sister dont care for those kinds of things. i made it, modeled it (lol), and turned out so rich and creamy like and and so delicious! i dont think i wanna shareit tonight! lol for bronies, you would expect a nice, sweet, tart-kind of-ness lol but this almost was liek candy! so sweet, but not too sweet! thankfully because my grandma doesnt like it too sweet ; )anywayz! great idea! thanx soo much for sharing! have a nice day! lol"
"0","5","love it every time!"
"0","5","Didnt change a thing and they tasted great! I didnt try the frosting. But I think it would be just as tasty.  Made these again tonight and tried the frosting. I didn't want to use honey so I used heavy cream instead. Very good! and rich!"
"0","4","This was a good brownie- not incredible and not the best I've ever had, but a good brownie, and oh so simple to make! I ended up cooking it for 15 min. at 325 in a round 8' pan because I have a demonic stove that is always 50 degrees too hot. They came out perfect, but definitely a cake-like brownie vs. a fudge-like one."
"0","5","I will never make box/store bought brownies again! These brownies are so moist and chewy. I double the recipe because I want a bigger batch. I have made them 3 times and they have turned out perfect every time. I have never made the frosting. I don't feel there is a need for it. They are just perfect!!"
"0","5","These are amazing!! The whole family LOVED them! I didn't change a thing!"
"0","1","Perfect recipe... IF you want to make a chocolate cake."
"0","4","haven't made home-made brownies since I was 16. Feel I need to warn people that these are NOT like the brownies you make out of a box or bag from the grocery store, which we have become accustomed to. When my husband and I first took a bite of the brownie we did not like the powdered cocoa taste. But after a few bites we enjoyed it."
"0","4","ONLY YIELD 8 BROWNIES I followed the exact directions and ththis recipie only gave me 8 tiny brownies in an 8 in pan. about 1/2 in think. So if you have a hungry bunch to feed i suggest you quadruple the ingridients and use a larger pan. Otherwise, a very good recipie. P.S. I substitutes the butter for Smart Balance to decrease saturated fat and cholesterol, and it cam out just perfect."
"0","5","I tried this recipe, not sure how 'great' it would turn out. But let me tell you guys, these brownies were the BEST I have ever tried. My husband, his friends, and my kids loved them! I have this recipe in my recipe book forever now, I won't even by the brownie mix at the store anymore, with a lil more work making them from scratch, they are heavenly!"
"0","3","These brownies are very good but there is so much butter that after a few bites it is too much. The brownies baked up as expected (they look great and have a good texture) but the butter leaves them REALLY greasy. I haven't seen any other reviewers with this problem-in fact some have complained that these are dry! Since these have such good flavor I am going to try them again but reduce the butter by maybe 1/3rd. I hope it works!"
"0","5","This IS the best brownies recipe ever."
"0","4","Slightly different than traditional brownies but yummy."
"0","4","The brownies were best straight from the oven. The next day, however, they were stale. The icing's flavor was fabulous, just too crunchy and unspreadable, even when placed on the hot brownies."
"0","5","these were delicious! i followed the recipe except that i only used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and it still turned out nice. it was slightly cakey around the edges but fudgey in the middle."
"0","5","These brownies are going to destroy my diet!! They are SO good and easy to make. I like to swirl peanut butter in the batter after I pour it in the pan. I don't do the icing. It's my compensation to the diet fairy! ;-)"
"0","5","Yummy! But do note these are not 'traditional' brownies. Which was good for me because I hate dry crunchy brownies. These are more cake/fudge like. Delicious!"
"0","5","These were great. This is how I like my brownies. Will make again."
"0","5","these are very good. i only had 1 egg so i used flaxseed for the other egg but they still taste great. make sure you grease your pan well because evidently i didn't and they did stick a bit. next time i am going to try using applesauce instead of butter to make them healthier :)"
"0","2","When I followed the instructions, I found this batter far too dry. They are, as many have pointed out, much more cake than brownie. I should have known, since frosting is for cake, not for brownies, but it had a 4.5 rating, so I tried it. They certainly aren't the worst cake I have had, but they are hardly the best brownie."
"0","4","These get a 10 for flavor. They are just the perfect chocolate goodness that is not too gooey, and certainly not dry. But these get a 3 for appearance for me. I don't know what happened, but as soon as I took them out of the oven (after 28 minutes), the middle sank and the edges were left quite higher than the rest of the pan. The middle had a deep crack across the center. I was taking these to a meeting, so I cut off the edges and cut up the center pieces and dusted them with powdered sugar to hide the cracks. Everyone at the meeting devoured them. I have tried many brownie recipes, and they all taste great - I just can't seem to get them to look good when they are done. Will try again and see if I can get it right."
"0","5","These were perfect and so moist!! I added nuts. Only thing I did differently."
"0","5","Fantastic! Leave off FROSTING!!!"
"0","5","This is one of my favorite scratch brownie recipes using cocoa. No need for icing!"
"0","5","Melty chocolately deliciousness! (I didn't make the frosting though.) Like another reviewer, I will never make box brownies again."
"0","5","Excellent brownie recipe, I don't think I will ever use the brownie mix ever again. The only thing I can say is that it was a bit too sweet, other than that excellent!!"
"0","5","These are awesome. I double the recipe and add chocolate chunk chips to make it extra chocolatey!"
"0","2","I really did not like this recipe. the frosting was dry and I followed this recipe to a tee."
"0","4","These brownies were delicious. I took the advice of others and was careful not to over-stir the batter. The result were outstanding fudge-like brownies. The only reason this is not a five star recipe for me was the frosting...it was way too thick. In the future, I will either forgo the frosting altogether or try a different chocolate frosting recipe on top."
"0","5","These are the BEST brownies ever! Every time I make them they are gone. I now have to triple the recipe. Can't keep these around. So gooey and wonderful. I even use fresh ground wheat for the flour that is called for. I recommend these with 10 stars!!"
"0","5","Wonderful!!! This recipe was so simple and delicious...If you love chocolate then you'll love this recipe."
"0","4","really yummy! super quick to make too. I added a couple teaspoons of a powdered mocha latte mix which gave another great layer of flavor."
"0","1","The brownies only came about 1 inch up the pan I thought it would rise, but it didnt and i took it out and half of the brownies stuck to the pan.. I greased and floured it really good to."
"0","5","A perfect brownie. Didn't use the called for topping, just dusted with powedered sugar, but they were so yummy by themselves! Can't wait to make more for my kiddos!"
"0","5","I really liked this recipe. It was easy, it didn't require me to melt chocolate bars (which I often don't have and can get kind of pricey). I tried this recipe by cutting it in half for 8 servings. I sifted cocoa powder on the bottom of the pan, and spread some toasted almonds. After that I poured the batter, and topped it with more toasted almonds. The texture is amazing!"
"0","3","We're rating these a 3.5/5. Followed the recipe to a 'tee'. Brownies were slightly dry, but had good flavor. Recipe was easy to follow with all ingredients on-hand and frosting was good. Might try it again with some added 'wet' ingredients to moisten. Thanks!"
"0","1","Without the frosting these brownies are not good. I could barely taste the chocolate and they're thin and dry and I only cooked them for 25 minutes. Better off getting a box mix of ghiradelli."
"0","5","I added 1/4 teaspoon mint extract also... so yummy!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I decided not to use the icing, and they were still fantastic. I'll never use box brownie mix again."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly - so perfectly moist and yummy ! And such a simple recipe ! Love it !"
"0","4","Wonderful Brownies!"
"0","5","Delicious! Especially warm! The brownies are great even by themselves but we loved the hint of honey in the frosting!"
"0","5","I floured the pan with cocoa powder, doubled the cocoa in the recipe, and added semisweet chocolate chips. Absolutely amazing, perfect for the chocolate lover I was making them for!!"
"0","4","These were nice, chocolatey (sp?) brownies. I enjoyed them, but my kids LOVED them. I didn't make the icing (felt it was just way too much sugar) and they still turned out better than a store bought, box version. Thanks for the yummy recipe"
"0","5","Soft, moist and a little chewy, all chocolaty delicious. And easy. But I skipped the frosting because I thought that would be too sweet. I brought these to my class of college students and they ate ALL of them and kept requesting for more. I added some marshmallow cream (from ice-cream topping) to the batter in the pan before baking (extra delicious)."
"0","3","They were not sweet enough and I must of mixed them to long because they were not the best brownies! The were just plain tasting! I like box brownies better than these! I will give them another try because they were quick to make and also I will use the suggestions people mentioned!"
"0","4","Oh please - who actually eats a 2' square brownie? For ease and simplicity, I'd rate 5* - mine weren't cake like at all - as a matter of fact, I'm wondering if my bp went bad as they barely rose - will remake with new box and re-rate. For taste, giving a 4* - okay, but not knock your socks off"
"0","4","They tasted good but I am used to a more dense brownie(the boxed kind). This is my first time making brownies from scratch but I would do this recipe again :)"
"0","5","Finally, the absolute perfect, luscious brownie! I made these for an open house event, and almost everyone who tried them raved about them, and wanted the recipe. The only thing I added was a splash (maybe 2 tbsp) of brewed coffee in the batter, and in the frosting. Definitely heightened the flavor. I cut them in very small squares, since they are extremely rich. They kept well for a few days, tightly covered. I wouldn't make this recipe everyday, but for special occasions, it's perfect!"
"0","5","These brownies were really good. Kind of cakey, but I think it's because I used a mixer. Next time I make then I'm going to try mixing them by hand and see if they're a little more fudgy. But despite the fact they were cakey, they were still really good. Skipped the frosting and just put some powdered sugar on top. My friends loved them."
"0","5","I am not a brownie lover but these were fantastic and my family loved them. I made 2 batches, one with milky way bars broken up in the batter to give it a caramel taste and the other was plain. No need for frosting. Better than box brownies!! YUMMY!!"
"0","5","I have no complaints! They weren't the best brownies I have ever eaten, but they sure were the best brownies I have ever made from scratch! I didn't make the frosting, but we didn't miss it. My 5 year old told me about a dozen times how much he liked them while he was eating them. I have already promised to make them again! Yum yum!!"
"0","4","This recipe was good. I agree with other posters that the most important aspect of this recipe is to NOT over-beat! If you follow the recipe as written and mix the brownies in the pan that you melt the butter in, you will be just fine. It takes just a couple of minutes to mix these up with a wooden spoon. With that said, I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I thought there was a lack of richness/depth of flavor. Perhaps the ratio of sugar to cocoa was off. Next time I will add more cocoa and will update my review."
"0","5","Made these for my kiddo's today. They loved them:) The only change I made was to add a bit of instant coffee to the mix. I topped with brownie frosting off this site & M&M's. Will be making again. Thanks for sharing!***Made these again. This time I followed another reviewer, by being oh so careful how I mixed the batter. The brownies turned out perfect....not too cakey, and not too doughy. We left off the icing and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Liked them even better than the first time:)"
"0","5","These brownies are amazing! My 14 year old made them and they tasted just like when I make them. There's no messing this recipe up. Keep some milk close by though because they are very rich. Thats the way we like em!"
"0","5","I make these ALL the time because they always turn out and they are SO easy. I am NOT a baker, I'm a busy working Mom with very little time for baking - but these always make me look like a superstar!"
"0","5","It was very easy and came out really well. We did not make the icing though.."
"0","5","I usually stink at making brownies and they never turn out right but i was surprised when these came out of the oven and tasted them. They were the best i ever tasted and i added coconuts on the top to give it an even sweeter taste although i didn't make the frosting and it was still GREAT!"
"0","5","Do not make the frosting"
"0","5","i doubled this recipe in a 9 X 13 and they were delicious. very easy to make and quick. a perfect blend between fudgy and cake-like and not dry at all. i always have the ingredients on hand and won't go back to box brownies. i did not make the frosting."
"0","5","It's not very often that I prefer something out of a box rather than homemade but brownies are usually the exception. This recipe, however, is juat as moist and chewy as any boxed brownie-not dry and crumbly like other homemade brownies I've tried. I did not make the frosting that went with this recipe and we still finished off the whole pan in one evening! A wonderful brownie recipe!"
"0","5","Made this on Friday and everyone loved it. I left out the frosting and don't think it needs it but do want to try it. I added semi-chocolate chips to it. I love extra chocolate!"
"0","5","These ARE the best!"
"0","4","The brownies were moist and great chocolate taste. We like our brownies without frosting. Will make again!"
"0","4","Yum, used applesauce instead of butter. Thanks for the recipe:)"
"0","5","Wonderul first time brownies or me and the children to do as a family. All in all a divine recipe, simple, sweet, and come out on top each time."
"0","4","I have never made homemade brownies. I was in a pickel with just a bit of time before we had guest. These brownies were REALLY EASY!!! I had to add a little bit of milk to the frosting. The frosting had a dark chocolate & vanilla flavor which was good. I guess you could use less vanilla. Overall the brownies were a hit! The kids of the family loved them and so did the parents. This is a keeper :)"
"0","5","These are fabulous!! The first time I had a problem with frosting consistency, the second time I thinned with a little water and it worked out great. Awesome recipe!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies ever! They are right inbetween cakey and fudgy. I have been baking them for almost a year now and everyone thinks of me as this amazing baker because of them. lol. I will say this though, this is a tempermental recipe. Everything has to be just right for the best taste. Always use butter, don't overmix, don't overbake, and make sure the eggs are more med-lrg range, not extra large. I always double and cook in a stoneware pan slightly smaller than a 9x13 so that my brownies are more moist. The frosting is amazing, and it will mix together if you put a little elbow grease into it. As soon as my brownies come out I have the frosting ready. I pop it in the microwave for 35 seconds and then immediately spread it on the brownies. They taste even better the next day. I am always getting asked to bake these for someone or something. Give them a try!"
"0","5","Make these and you'll definitely satisfy your chocolate craving. HEAVEN! The only change I made (not a big one at all). I did not butter the pan...I used nonstick aluminum foil to line the pan. MMM...MMMMM..MMMMMM."
"0","5","Couldn't be more simple. Made it exactly as listed, and they came out very soft and fudge-like. This is my new brownie recipe. I'm not buying 'box' brownies ever again. I'm going to try doubling the recipe using a 9x13 since we were through the 8x8 size in less than a day (and that was with only me and hubby eating them)."
"0","5","The topping came out too stiff to spread. I microwaved it for about 20 seconds and that softened it up enough to spread. Otherwise, these are definitely some of the best brownies I have had."
"0","5","I tried without the frosting and then with it, and the frosting is a MUST to balance the bittersweet taste. These are really good brownies as long as they have the frosting!"
"0","5","These were absolutely amazing! My first home made brownies and they were just incredible. I brought them to my parents for a family get together and everyone was in awe of my baking skills:)he he. I read one review where the person substituted a some brown sugar for some white and I may try that next time, but I don't think this recipe could be any more perfect."
"0","5","To my Husband and I, a brownie is the gooey center brownie. We absolutely LOVE this recipe, EVERY brownie is that gooey center one we love so much (and normally have to fight over! lol). Thank you for resolving so many brownie fights to come!"
"0","5","Love this recipe. I made it several times with great success. but I tried doubling it, and putting it in a bigger pan, and they didn't turn out at all. Next time I will just make two batches. It is so easy that won't be too much of a problem."
"0","5","Yummy! I was in the mood for some brownies and stumbled upon this recipe. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I even made the icing on top of the brownie and added it. It was nice and fudgy and satisfying to the taste buds. I will definitely make again!"
"0","5","Awesome! Will never use brownie mix from a box again. Super easy. I did not do the icing as generally I don't like icing on brownies."
"0","5","Absolutely yummy...very moist and rich!!"
"0","5","These brownies are quite the appealing, no matter taste wise, or visually. However my brownies did turn out quite bubbly and cake-like, mostly due to me overbeating the batter and perhaps adding a little too much baking powder. I didn't use the frosting recipe because I ran out of butter and went with a pure 1:2 ration cocoa powder to confectioner's sugar icing with some water and vanilla extract. When the icing is hot it looks like glossy ganache but it cools and hardens later with a chocolate crust look. Anyone who is not up to butter frosting can try that instead!"
"0","5","Didn't change a thing! I was in a hurry and didn't even have time to read the reviews. They were loved by everyone!"
"0","5","This recipe is DELICIOUS! We didn't have any honey for the icing so we ended up using about 2 table spoons of water instead for the icing and it turned out great. These are amazing with some vanilla ice cream on the side! :-)"
"0","5","Very tasty. Somewhere between cake and fudge."
"0","5","i make them every day! theres really r the best brownies!!"
"0","5","These truly are the best brownies! I've made them three times in the past week. I have not tried the frosting, so I'm reviewing the brownies only. 20 minutes is done for me and the key is to not overmix! Absolutely perfect brownies. I always double the recipe and use a 9x13' pan. I was out of white sugar once and wanted to make another batch, so I used brown sugar insead and the results were still excellent."
"0","5","These are the BEST brownies I have ever tried. They were easy to make (used only one pot for everything I mixed) and were fudgy and sweet, even without the icing. I followed the directions and they have come out great everytime."
"0","3","I wasn't impressed, honestly. Not chocolate-y/fudgey tasting enough for me. Kids ate them, they're not picky when it comes to brownies."
"0","5","I have tried homemade brownies in the past and they were awful. So, I decided to step out into the danger zone and try again. These turned out great! I used only one egg instead of two and they were very fudge-like. The frosting was extremely stiff so I added about a teaspoon of milk and it was fine. I iced the brownies while they were still very hot and it melted nicely into a glaze. In fact, they were so good that me and my sister hid them from everyone else so we didn't have to share!"
"0","5","I thought these were really good! I did add milk chocolate chips into the batter before I baked them. It gave them an extra chocolate taste. I did not make the frosting. They were great without it. Next time I may have to double it because they were gone in no time!"
"0","5","I made these brownies for my husbands birthday. He LOVED them. Some things that I did differently is mix the batter by hand instead of with a mixer. I also added walnuts. The brownies turned out great. I will make these again!"
"0","5","I thought these brownies were great."
"0","4","Moist and yummy. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't blow my socks off! Still looking."
"0","5","Perfect brownies. They were gooey, fudgey and yummy. Next time I will double the batter! I topped it with another brownie frosting from a different recipe and the combo was over the top! WARNING: will need a very large glass of milk on hand!"
"0","5","I was very impressed with these brownies!!! They were quick and easy, I made these and frosted them with the Brownie Frosting recipe from this site for Father's Day. Super sweet but ohhh sooo yummy! I did as other reviewers have done and hand mixed these and they turned out fabulous! They were more of a fudge like consistency and less cakey than others have reviewed. These came together very quickly and I was able to pull the brownies out of the oven and then make the frosting and the brownies were still warm enough to frost the brownies immediately after all the chocolate chips were melted. This recipe is a Keeper!!!"
"0","5","Brownies came out great. Would definitely recommend making this recipe."
"0","5","These turned out great !!! So many people have told me how awesome they are. I am one of those people who believe it is hard to improve on a cake mix or brownie mix. Believe me, you can tell the difference on this !"
"0","4","Very easy to make. My 16 year old daughter made them and they turned out great. Very fudgy. Next time will make a bigger batch !"
"0","5","I added about 2-3 Tb of peanut butter to the frosting & WOW!"
"0","5","I just barely made these brownies, and they are amazing. If you prefer your brownies less cakey, try leaving out the baking powder, and bake them at 325 instead of 350. I used whole wheat flour, which gave the brownies a slightly nutty taste. It's quite yummy. For the icing, I didn't have enough confectioner's sugar. So, I used less honey and less cocoa and substituted in a little hot chocolate mix. That worked surprisingly well. :) I will make these again and again. Not only are they great 'as is,' but the recipe is super flexible if you want to mix things up a bit."
"0","5","These are great easy to make brownies. I have made it two times with perfect results. I used a wooden spoon to mix it up. Brownies came out nice and dense that way. I added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips on the top before baking. I did this only because I had left over chocolate chips and didn't want to make the frosting. I cooked it for 25 min. Great turnout. Will make again and again."
"0","5","So good! Just as easy as a boxed mix but 10 times better tasting!!"
"0","3","Maybe I overcooked them. They were in for 22 minutes in a 13x9 (I doubled as per another review) pan. I'll try again because they didn't suck and hope for a more moist, chocolate brownie."
"0","5","These were great. I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the batter before pouring into the pan and I did not make the frosting. Very good!"
"0","5","A never-fail."
"0","5","Awesome taste!! I have to say, I have tried so many brownie recipes, and for the life of me can not seem to understand what I do wrong, but they never turn out right! Either they are hard or sticky or something! This one turned out perfectly and the frosting is a real additive! Thanks for sharing! :)"
"0","5","I've made these many, many times and they are really the best. They come together very quickly and they're so chocolate-y that I prefer them without icing!"
"0","5","I followed a previous posters suggestion in doubling while leaving out one egg, keeping the salt measurement the same at 1/4tsp, and baking 30-35 minutes. They came out amazing and it was hard to mail them off to my deployed sailor without eating them all myself!"
"0","5","I really enjoyed these. I didn't use the icing, and ate them with ice cream. Will use this recipe from now on!"
"0","5","Love Love Love this recipe!!!!!! The BEST Brownies I have ever had!!! Will never buy another box of brownie mix again. I added chocolate chips and peanut butter chips."
"0","3","Brownies have a good flavour, I baked them for 21 minutes and feel that they were in the oven for too long, next time I will bake them for only 15 minutes. I added half a cup of walnuts, good flavour and desirable texture."
"0","4","Delicious, but a little too cakey and not quite chocolatey enough. I did leave off the icing though. that was probably a mistake. I'd definitely make these again though! Maybe less beating this time..."
"0","5","I have to say that I was quite impressed with how these turned out. I have tried homemade brownies before and have been very disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, which was very easy and mess free. I did add pecans to the batter. Definitely do not over mix, just blend until moistened. These turned out wonderfully. Will def make again."
"0","5","Really good, didn't make icing."
"0","5","Great recipe! Turns out perfect everytime."
"0","5","The brownies are good themselves, but the frosting adds a rich chocolaty finish. I agree with other that it is very sweet. I used half of everything for the frosting and coated the brownies and I think that was a perfect balance. The frosting recipe needs to be tweeked a little based on your preference. I say use less sugar and honey and taste the mixture before adding more later. Add sugar, honey or cocoa power IF needed."
"0","5","These are the best brownies I've made by far. They go great with some walnuts and a scoop of Haagendaz vanilla ice cream"
"0","5","Hands down, the best brownies I've ever had, or made. A new favourite."
"0","4","These brownies were super easy to make, I especially love that the cleanup goes quickly since they're made in one large saucepan! I skipped using this frosting recipe, as I was having a serious chocolate craving, and made my own chocolate fudge frosting by mixing 1/4 c whipping cream, 20 oz. (about 1/3 c) callebeaut 55.3% bittersweet chocolate in a small saucepan. Cook over LOW heat, stirring constantly until chocolate is melted and the whole mixture is shiny and dark brown. remove from heat and mix in 1/4 t salt and 1/2 t vanilla. viola! frosting that is super easy and makes these delicious brownies ultra luxurious!"
"0","5","i would give this 10 stars! LOVE this recipe. Its just as easy as the box kind but WAY yummier! Thank you so very much for the recipe! I also like to add different flavor extracts (ie: raspberry or orange) to the icing to give it a little something different."
"0","4","So these tasted great, but I had to give them only four stars. When I think of brownies I like moist, dense and super chocolatey, however, these turned out like a really good chocolate cake. They were light and airy. Next time I need a good birthday cake, I'd double the recipe and make a stacked cake."
"0","5","these really are the best brownies! my whole family loves these."
"0","3","These are NOT fudgy , very cake like , not what we like in our house!"
"0","5","I made these for my husband last night and he absolutely loved them. I skipped the icing all together, but I added chopped walnuts for a little extra. I also made another batch with the cheesecake marbling from the Cheesecake Brownies recipe from this site and chopped walnuts. I swirled it all in the mix after I put it in the pan instead of just on top. It had to bake quite a bit longer, but once that knife came out clean and they cooled, delicious! I will be making these again in the future!"
"0","5","So great - I followed one reviewer's suggestion of only adding 3 eggs and keeping salt at 1/4 tsp. when doubling. I also only added about 1 1/2 cups of sugar so they weren't too sweet. They turned out perfectly!"
"0","2","I followed the recipe exactly as written. The brownies turned out dry and bland. Not chewy, not cakey. The frosting is really sweet, but the consistancy is good. Sorry, but we are not a fans of this recipe."
"0","4","Fabulous recipe! Made a few changes to it, and tried it with real dark chocolate rather than cocoa powder. Which obviously was chopped into pieces and melted in the bowl by the heat of the melted butter... What can I say? Absolutely delicious. Just a word of warning if you use real chocolate, you may want to adjust the quantity of sugar used to avoid having your brownies being too sweet."
"0","5","I have tried many brownie recipes. This is the best. All my friends love them!"
"0","5","Very yummy, although I found that you had to heat the frosting in order for it to be spreadable."
"0","3","This was ok...Not the best. The brownies were far too soft, more like cake (and I made sure not to over beat) and the frosting was chalky. My quest for really good brownies continues."
"0","5","very easy and delicious. I prefer without the icing as it's too sweet for my liking. I love that they're chewy. I cooked for only 20 minute and it wasn't quite enough."
"0","4","These are fantastic and very easy!"
"0","5","I 1.5 times the recipe and make it in my square pan - Great, but I upped the cocoa to 2/3 cup and omitted the baking powder. yummy and dark :) Note - it was somewhere between a brownie and a cake, so I will keep looking for a more brownie-like brownie recipe BUT my guests did love it =)"
"0","5","this is best brownie recipe, truly the most delicious homemade brownies I have made and tasted so far. I have been looking for a 'perfect' brownie reipe for quite a while and luckily I have found one. the best thing about this recipe is that its easy to prepare took me less that 15 mins to mix and they aremouthwatering. I took few to my friends in school and they loved it. my review is if you want a fudgy brownie, DONT mix with a elctric mixer, and beat the eggs slightly with a fork before adding it to batter. Very IMP.."
"0","5","This is my new brownie recipe! These were so good the whole pan was gone in a day :) I like a fudge-type brownie so I made a few alterations: I doubled the recipe (they never last in my house otherwise :P) Although I only increased the sugar by 1/2Cup and left the eggs at 2. I poured it all into a greased 9x9 pan and let it cook for about 42 mins, until the tester was almost totally clean. I was worried they were still a little under-done when I first cut into them (they were still warm, I couldn't resist) but once I let them cool in the fridge a bit they were PERFECT! I loved their crunchy top and dense chewiness, they were just like a brownie should be :) I didn't make the icing and I wouldn't recomend they be stored overnight in the fridge - at least not if they're going to move quickly. They got super-firm inside and the top/sides was hard to bit through - so I say keep them on the counter if they're all going to be gone by tomorow anyway :) Great, super great, mega-great! As long as there is chocolate in the world I will make these!"
"0","3","I tend to like brownies that are more chewy and fudge-like. This was like a chocolate cake. It tasted great, just not a fan of the texture."
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have found. It is easy to make and it doesn't have nuts. Note: make sure to use 8 inch pan per directions."
"0","3","the brownies themselves aren't all that great, I followed the recipe exactly and they weren't sweet at all, but the frosting was to die for!! I will definitely be using the frosting again and trying a new brownie recipie"
"0","5","I overcooked these guys, but they were still AMAZING!! My husband is a brownie fanatic and loved them as well!"
"0","5","The best, really..."
"0","4","These were definitely easy to make - but the frosting was a mystery to me. I think if I had melted the butter first, it would have helped. The frosting came out pretty crumbly so I had to add about two tbl of milk. There needs to be some sort of adjustment to the frosting. Regardless, they were yummy and I would totally make them again, but adjust the frosting."
"0","5","Awesome brownie recipe! I skipped the icing and added chopped Snicker bars before baking. yum!"
"0","5","followed the recipe for the brownies exactly. Used others recommendations and only used 1/2 cup of sugar for the icing. Delicious and easy to make."
"0","4","Sooo good!!! I didn't use the frosting, but it wasn't needed. They don't raise up much, but the do make a fudgy (not oozing or overly chocolate flavored) little treat. They're perfect for a brownie sundae made with sweet cream ice cream and walnuts."
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have had. Husband enjoyed them as well. I doubled the recipe to use in a 9x13 pan. I also mixed 8 oz. of cream cheese, 1 egg, 1/3 cup sugar and swirled it on top of the brownie batter. Turned out awesome!"
"0","5","The best brownies ever... I used a little less confectioners sugar for the frosting but left the recipe alone otherwise. First batch was gone so fast I only got one... Made a double batch the next time and family was fighting over it.... Truly awesome brownies, nor more box mix for me!!!"
"0","5","Really awesome Brownies. This is not hyperbole. Trust me when I say this recipe is wonderful and it's our go to brownie recipe. Try this one!"
"0","5","My family loves these brownies. I'll have to start doubling the recipe."
"0","4","Good, but the frosting needed to be adjusted. I had to add some half and half to moisten it. I took mine out at 20 minutes, and they turned out PERFECT. Very fudgy and yummy!"
"0","4","I really like the taste of these brownies -my issue is with the consistency. I read other reviews and didn't over mix, used raw cane sugar instead of white sugar, but stuck to the recipe other than that. They just cooled from being cooked and I find them too much like a cake. They should be thicker in my oppinion. My edges were a bit dark and I cooked it in an 8' round glass dish. Maybe they just happened to over-cook? If I make this again, I'll be altering it so I get a 'fudgier' brownie. *edit* I re-made them and hardly mixed them. They were fudgier and VERY good."
"0","3","These were okay...more of cake-like brownie, not chewy/fudgey, not very flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly (minus the salt) and mixed by hand. Definitely not 'the best brownie'."
"0","5","I love boxed brownie mixes and can never get homemade brownies quite as gooey and dense. Well, this recipe is the closest to a boxed mix I've tried! I'll make them again, as we are trying to stay away from all of the additives in processed foods."
"0","4","These turned out good, couldn't really find anything wrong with them just not very flavorful"
"0","5","Wow these brownies are just amazing. If you want add a little of your own, unique ingredients and make this amazing. Everyone who says my husband hated them, get a new husband or learn how to cook! Don't like the frosting? Don't use it. Learn from your mistakes and improvise. That way you can learn to make your own recipe's. Remember to use the add to recipe box. Actually this recipe doesn't really need changes. It's amazing if you do it right. Don't eat too many brownies! JamieCooks"
"0","5","Sensational! Would have been better if I hadn't burned them. I was able to scrape off the top layer and try it enough to know it's a great recipe. I added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips to this recipe-then you don't even need frosting! Definitely will make again! :D"
"0","5","These brownie came out really good! I took the advice of other reviewers and mix it by hand with a whisk and they came out very rich and fudgey. Next time i think I will try to use the hand mixer just to see how they come out and see how different they end up baking. These did not last very long in my kitchen!"
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe ever. I usually always prefer homemade to artificial but I thought that I'd never find a brownie recipe better than the boxed. These are better! I haven't even ever made the frosting. I always just make the brownies and they are perfect just the way they are without the frosting!"
"0","5","By and far the YUMMIEST brownies I have ever eaten. Chewy and moist. I ended up pulling the brownies out at 30 mins vs 35 mins but my oven runs on the hot side. The only thing I truly disagree with is the yield of 16 brownies. Doing so would yield teeny tiny amounts. Make a double batch. Enjoy!"
"0","5","These were delicious brownies - I normally don't make them from scratch, but these were embarrassingly easy. I did run a couple tablespoons short on butter, so I just topped them off with two tablespoons of cointreau for moisture and a bit of orange flavor which worked out terrifically. My only complaint is that 16 brownies is pushing it - I really only saw about 12 and those were not large."
"0","1","Yet another brownie disappointment. Comes out like cake not chewy and fudgy like brownies should be."
"0","4","These brownies turned out great and were very quick to make. Definitely didn't take one hour. I followed other reviewers instructions about not overmixing and overbaking. 25 minutes in my oven was perfect. My one warning is let the butter cool before beginning to mix. I tried to temper my eggs and the butter was just still too hot. Even with that minor issue, they tasted delicious."
"0","5","Great! I made a double batch to rave reviews! I ran out a vanilla so only had half of what of was called for but it stilled was great. The batter was really thick and i had a hard time getting them out of the pan but the taste was great!"
"0","5","Yummy! My son made them for his baking class. A major hit. He followed the advice of cutting sugar in frosting by half and hand mixing to make it more fudgy."
"0","4","I really liked these brownies. SUPER easy to make. Couldn't be easier, actually. The only thing that bothered me about them is that I thought they were too sweet. I think next time I'd cut the sugar and possibly increase the amount of cocoa powder. Other than that, wonderful! I recommend underbaking them to get that gooey wonderful-ness."
"0","3","Kind of bitter. Not very chocolaty."
"0","5","I don't know why I was skeptical about these brownies, but I was definitely proven wrong. I followed the directions to a T and did NOT use a mixer-I hand mixed instead as per one of the suggestions here. The brownies came out fudgy (which I prefer over cake-like). I made sure not to overcook and they were perfect. Very easy and good recipe!"
"0","5","Best brownies I've ever had!"
"0","5","We make these all of the time and love them. This is a recipe that we got from the Hershey's website and they also call them 'Best Brownies'. They go fast at our house."
"0","5","I make these brownies all of the time! They always turn out perfectly. I like mine with nuts, so I add a handful of pecans and some chocolate chips to make them a bit more interesting."
"0","5","I have yet to put the frosting on these brownies. I always want to take them someplace and I think the frosting would mess them up. I use salted butter and then omit the salt in the recipe. I usually add 1/2 c. chopped nuts, b/c I am nuts about nuts too. In my hot oven I bake for 27 min and when I take them out of the oven, and they are on the cooling rack, I drizzle amaretto over the hot brownies. After they cool, they are fudgy and delicious."
"0","5","Delicious! they really are the best brownies, they never last past the second night in my house..the frosting is very good also...but i always have to add a egg..and it comes out perfect..i'll never buy box brownies again.."
"0","5","Wow! Very simple and very good! I'm not a baker at all but even I could handle this recipe. I did sneak in some mini chocolate chips and I'm on my way to eating the entire pan. Thank you, Angie!"
"0","5","I'm really happy with the way the brownies turned out,I was thinking it wasn't going to be so good because it was on the internet and it was simple but they tasted just as good as box brownies.Great recipe,I'm really impressed."
"0","5","These are fabulous... best homemade recipe I've found so far. These turned out a little too gooey in the middle, but I only cooked them for 15 minutes as they looked done. If given another 2-3 min in the oven, would've been perfect! For those who claimed that theirs turned out cake-like, I would recommend mixing them less. Brownies shouldn't be mixed with a blender... just by hand, and just enough to turn all the batter brown and moist. Try again because these are worth it!!!!"
"0","4","These brownies taste awesome but my only problem is that these brownies are very thin. Even after doubling it up and baking it in a 9x13, its still thin. Anyway suggestions??"
"0","4","These were good but the icing is a bit much. Good cure for the m-m-m-munchies, bro."
"0","5","I don't know who called these cakey but I have no idea how you could make these cakey. They're soft, fudgey and moist. Very, very good brownies! Double the recipe because these go quickly!"
"0","5","i've spent a lot of time perfecting my own brownie recipe, but i decided to try another and this was grand. don't use a mixer you have to be gentle with brownie batter! for the 1c. sugar i used 1/2 c. sugar 1/2 c. honey (i use honey A LOT as a sub. for sugar!) added a little extra cocoa and omitted the icing. splendid!"
"0","5","This is for the brownie portioj of the recipe only: It was my first attempt at from-scratch brownies and they came out perfect! So easy and delicious. I didn't make the frosting because I didn't have confectioner's sugar on hand, but the brownies were so moist and just the right amount of sweetness that they didn't need frosting. Note: the type/quality of cocoa powder you use definitely makes a difference. I don't mind generic or cheaper brands for most things, but don't you will notice a taste difference with cocoa powder, especially if it's a main ingredient."
"0","4","These are pretty good, not the best, but still good."
"0","5","LOVE these brownies! I had to add about 3 more tbsp of butter to the frosting and I substituted agave for the honey. It's a keeper!"
"0","5","I just finished making these brownies about 30 minutes ago and they are the most amazing I've ever tasted. They are a more cake-like brownie, not dense and chewy, but I enjoy all types so it was perfect. The only modification I made was adding 2 teaspoons of butter in addition to the 3 tablespoons already in the recipe for the frosting... I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is a genuine brownie lover!!!! Two manly thumbs up!!!!!"
"0","5","Why by a package of brownie mix. These are excellent and easy to make. I will use this over and over again."
"0","5","These were awesome! I didn't and wouldn't change a thing. I cooked for 27 minutes and they came out perfect. I know some reviewers didn't care for the icing but I thought that's what made them so great and I normally don't like frosted brownies. I thought they were just like brownies should be dense and not cake like. Love 'em!!Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Love this recipe! I don't bother with the frosting - they don't need it! I like using Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder. It makes them extra dark and rich."
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic, not to mention so easy. Thank you for this recipe. No need to buy those trans fat filled mixes anymore."
"0","5","I have been making these brownies for several years now. They are my go-to brownies ~ easy, yummy, and chocolatey. The only changed I made to the recipe was to add 1 tablespoon milk to the frosting mixture. Thanks!"
"0","5","These are THEE best brownies I have ever made from scratch. They literally don't make it an hour in my house."
"0","5","These brownies are the best brownies I've ever had! I made them for a bake sale and overnight, these brownies turned to fudge, yes, fudge! I was kind of worried that something went wrong but they were a huge hit! I completely recommend this recipe to anyone who is in the mood for a sweet dessert! By the way, I never use allrecipes.com, just because I am a bad cook, not because it has bad recipes AT ALL, but this recipe was easy to follow and made me seem like a master chef. So please MAKE THIS RECIPE! IT IS AMAZING! It is simply delicious!"
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe EVER. I will NEVER use a mix again! So easy, so inexpensive, and so delicious!!!!"
"0","5","This was great, to make it a little more healthy I used 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 butter. I also only used 3 eggwhites for the eggs. It turned out pretty good!"
"0","5","Excellent! Add in more cocoa powder to make it richer!"
"0","5","Excellent! I top these with fresh whipped cream and strawberries instead of frosting."
"0","5","These were the first from-scratch brownies I have ever made and they were perfect! I don't think they were too cake-like at all!"
"0","5","These turned out fabulously. I only cooked them for 25 minutes -- they were done, but moist and chewy. My husband, who dislikes chocolate (don't get me started) said they were delicious and inhaled 6 of them in one sitting. That sums it up right there!"
"0","5","I substituted half of the butter with applesauce and cut the powdered sugar in half for the frosting. Delicious!"
"0","5","Amazing!!! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","1","Despite what several other reviewers said, these brownies are not very good; extremely cake-like to say the least. I even undercooked mine (20 min as opposed to the 25-30 min recommended) and they still came out dry. And no, I did not overbeat the eggs. The frosting was good, but that's about the only part I actually wanted to eat."
"0","4","GOod would make them again, but more light and fluffy then I was expecting.. almost like a heavy chococlate cake."
"0","5","Moist and flavourful!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly but decided not to make the frosting, and they were absolutely perfect. I'll make these instead of a mix whenever I can. :)"
"0","4","This was fantastic! I left one egg out when i doubled the recipie so it wouldnt turn out too cakey. I cooked it in a pyrex dish though, so I kind of undercooked the browies, so its like eating asquare of batter! Ick. Other than that, they were amazing. Everyone at my school enjoyed them."
"0","5","just very delicious!! Made half the icing and it was very nice. As someone said, put it on when brownies are still warm."
"0","5","These brownies turned out really good. My family along with myself loved them. :)"
"0","5","these taste out of this world!"
"0","5","Great brownies!! I've never responded to a recipe before but this one is delicious!! Add the frosting when warm and for an added kick I added some crushed butterfingers on top!! yummy"
"0","5","Just made these and they are not cakey, I used two eggs. I hand mixed them. Only baked for 21 min. For the frosting I omitted the cocoa and added coconut. It was delish! My 13yo son said YUM YUM! and wanted to eat the whole pan."
"0","4","Mines turned out fudgy, and that's what I like. I omitted the frosting because the brownies themselves were a bit too sweet for me, next time I use a little less sugar (I bet it's because I use beet sugar). I'll use this recipe for brownies from now on."
"0","3","nothing special. thought they wouldve been bettr than they were. maybe im just used to boxed brownies?"
"0","5","I just made this recipe as written. Just doubled it and used a 9 x 13. It is by far, the best brownie recipe I've ever made. Perfect!"
"0","5","I love these brownies! I only add one thing. I usually add semi-sweet chocolate chips, or white chocolate chips and it adds a little more chocolate flavor. Some people were complaining about them being cake-like, so I thought this would help, and I think it did. You also don't want to over-bake these. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I shared these brownies with friends at a parent/child class. Some people said these were the best brownies they had ever had. People were taking them home in their purses!"
"0","5","I made them a couple times and my husband LOVED them. This time, I made the batter and I'll refrigerate it in individual portions - microwaving it for 30-45 seconds makes a great alternative to those pricey (but YUMMY) Warm Delights bowls!"
"0","5","i made these brownies for tfc(double batch) and everyone loved them"
"0","5","Never tried another brownie recipe.. Never will.. Every single person who tried this brownie Hounds me for the recipe.. I've made like 1-2 batches every few months for the past 5 yrs. The best brownie ever... Thanks Angie..."
"0","3","it turned out okay. the brownies were sort of cakey, but tasted fine. for the frosting, i only used about 1/3 of a cup of sugar, and they were already a bit too sweet"
"0","5","Came out great."
"0","5","Good basic recipe. The second time I made them I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, split the batter in two halves and added a very thin layer of caramel sauce between the layers. Only cooked for 25 minutes in a stoneware baking dish. If cooking in a metal pan, decrease the cooking time 5 minutes and check for doneness."
"0","5","I have been searching for the best brownie recipe and this is definitely it. It is sooo moist. I doubled this recipe and put it in a 9x13 pyrex pan. Adding walnuts is really good."
"0","5","Wow! These brownies were so good! Rich, gooey and chocolatey. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the frosting...I decreased the powdered sugar slightly and added some caramel topping in with it. The frosting seemed really thick but when you spread it onto the warm brownies it melts on top quite nice. I will definitely make these again and again!"
"0","5","Best brownies I ever had!!! Not too sweet and not too rich."
"0","4","Good basic brownie recipe. I was a bit worried about the frosting-while-warm approach, but in the end they turned out very well. Took them to a friend's house and they were very well received! Obviously much better than the packaged stuff and a breeze to put together. One change I made was to add a tsp of milk to the icing -- not sure how I would have spread it otherwise.  EDIT: As written, this recipe makes way too much icing. I would recommend halving that part. Otherwise, these brownies are great. I've made them about nine or ten times and they are always a great success!"
"0","5","Awesome, quick and easy! These are definitely somewhere between a cake and a fudge brownie but remained moist and tasty. I altered the recipe some, partly due to being at 8250 altitude and partly due to our liking things less sweet and without actual eggs in it. I used egg replacer (the brown and orange box) instead of eggs and used sucanat (dried molasses granules) in place of white sugar. For the altitude, I scooped out about two tablespoons less sugar, added a tablespoon of water to the 'egg' mix and reduced the baking powder to 1/8 teaspoon. I did not decrease the fat however! I'm below 9000 feet so I just can't see the point in reducing something as yummy as butter. I did use earth balance vegan butter though so the whole recipe turned out vegan. Last thing I did was to use a mini muffin pan instead of a square pan. Thank you for such a perfect recipe!!"
"0","4","Very good, but I think 'best' is stretching a teeny bit. PROS: You're gonna need a glass of milk! Easy to make. Very good flavor. These brownies will stop a sweet tooth in its tracks! And I LOVE the frosting. I will use the frosting again on other chocolate goodies. CONS: It's not as chewy as I would like brownies, but also not completely cake-like. Think fluffy brownie texture. Might have been chewier if I had let them cool completely, but not by much. No, I didn't use an electric beater either. Maybe some oil or shortening would help? The frosting MUST be 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar. That's what I used and it turned out perfect. 1 cup would turn it to plumber's paste. Enjoy!"
"0","5","They,work,perfectly"
"0","5","Very rich but very tasty! I made them the first time and they were perfect. However, I tried making them again and failed! I over baked them and the edges were very hard! Make sure not to overbake! I enjoyed the frosting and I didn't make any changes to this except I added 1 tsp of water to the frosting. Excellent and well worth it!"
"0","5","This was awesome, in 15 min. desapere, i was surprised!! delicious.. I didn`t change anything, if you don`t like too sweet, don`t put the frost but for my a chocoholic fan it was delicious!!!!!"
"0","4","I didn't make the frosting to go with it b/c it just didn't sound very good to me. But the brownies came out great. I used a circle 9inch cake pan and had to bake the brownies for an extra 6mins, and even then they could've probably used another 4. I will def make this again. Maybe add in a little bit more cocoa next time."
"0","5","Excellent. Suggest small servings because they are very rich."
"0","4","Brownies turned out great. I wasnt sure they would because the batter was so thick it would hardly pour into pan. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is there an ingredient missing from the icing, it just makes like sugar dough, there has to be some kind of liquid... needless to say, I would've loved to have icing but didnt know how to make it."
"0","4","These brownies are amazing- that is, when they turn out right. If the icing is a little thick, I simply add a little milk and stir. These are also good when you add some kind of morsels to them. I personally like to add white chocolate!"
"0","5","I did NOT make the frosting part--good brownies don't need it, and bad brownies don't deserve to be propped up, so I didn't make the frosting. With that said, these were great, although quite thin, and I did use an 8x8 square pan. I didn't mess around with the recipe at all except to omit the salt as I used salted butter rather than unsalted. I may try these again doubling the recipe and omitting one of the doubled eggs (so 3 total instead of 4 total). These produced fudgy brownies but I did have a layer all around the outside that puffed up and got a bit cakey (but it was ok, not too much like cake, just puffed like storebought brownies, only without the revolting flavor.) I'm a TERRIBAD brownie maker, too, so if this recipe produced something other than cake-rocks for me, it must be a good one :) EDIT: 4/30/10: I just discovered that we ate these so fast I only got one sad, pathetic picture of them in my somewhat rusted 8x8 aluminum pan. These must've been TERRIFIC if we ate them too fast for me to get pictures! :=)"
"0","5","Amazing...I took them to work and everyone wanted the recipie!! These are the best brownies I have ever had!"
"0","5","My gooooooooooosh these were amazing. I had everything to make them, except white flour so I ended up using whole wheat flour. I was nervous about that, but they still taste delicious. They are really crumbly, but that's probably due to the flour."
"0","5","So perfect! Gone in two days between two people. mmmmm."
"0","5","Looking for something simple to cook during 12 year old daughter's sleepover. Found this - had all the ingredients on hand. Didn't make the icing & didn't need it. (I did add about 6 oz. of chocolate chips to the mix.) These were the biggest hit ever. All the girls wanted me to send the recipe to their moms. Will NEVER buy brownie mix again!"
"0","5","So delicious."
"0","4","I am an experienced taster/baker and these brownies tasted delicious! I cooked mine in an 8x8x2 pan, baked for just under 25 minutes and next time I'll cook them less time because I like my baked goods as moist/fudgy as possible, even a little on the 'raw' side. The frosting was very powdery and I didn't have any milk to thin it down, so I added a tiny tad of very hot water. The frosting set as it cooled. I will definitely bake these again."
"0","5","I love brownies, and these are awesome! I doubled the recipe and used a 13 x 9 pan. I also added just a tough more cocoa. Obviously the larger pan had to cook a little longer but oh wow! They were delicious! Not really fudgelike or cakelike, but somewhere in the middle. I will never buy boxed brownie mixes again. These are way easy and super yummy! Thanks!"
"0","3","a little dry compared to out of the box kind"
"0","5","These are really yummy! I made them into cupcakes and frosted them with the cream cheese frosting II, also found on this site. I topped that with crushed Pepperidge Farm Geneva cookies...that made these spectacular! Hubby couldn't stop eating them ;)"
"0","5","This is by far the BEST brownie recipe I have ever used! I took one person's advice and lightly beat the eggs before mixing with the other ingredients and also was careful not to over mix. I ended up adding about a teaspoon more of honey to the frosting just to make it a little more spreadable.... For sure I will be making them again!"
"0","5","Great recipe! My kids and hubby loved them and he also declared that this recipe was definitely a 'keeper'! It was nice to use this recipe b/c I had all of the ingredients on-hand. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Thanks for such an EASY and yummy dessert!"
"0","5","These really are the 'best' brownies. We had a snow day yesterday and I got so bored. Saw a Duncan Hines brownie ad on tv, and thought that sounds so good, but def. prefer homemade. This recipe had my husband drooling on himself. Super moist and fudgy. I added a buttercream frosting to the top. We are having them for dessert tonight with vanilla ice cream. SO good!!"
"0","5","I used dark cocoa and added chopped candied cherries in (about a 1/4 - 1/3 cup). Had to play with the frosting a little to get the consistency right. But, man, these are some of the best brownies I've ever made. This recipe is a total keeper!!"
"0","4","I made these tonight as a special treat for my fiance and I have mixed feelings about them. The texture was fantastic - kind of crispy/flaky on the top and around the edges and very chewy on the inside. My only problem with them was they had kind of a different taste to them - can't put my finger on it but there was a different kind of taste. I'm going to read the other reviews to see if I can find some 'tweaking' suggestions. But for now, I'll say thanks for a good recipe!"
"0","5","yummy! I can't see how anyone could not like these. They might not be the 'best' brownies, but they really are good. So simple and fast to make. I wasn't going to make the frosting but I am glad I did. I did have to add some milk ot the forsting as it was very thick imo. I prefered to have a nice soft spreadable frosting."
"0","5","Omg! The tast is fantastic! It's gooey and mhhmmm..!! IIf you are looking for a really dense and fudgey brownie, then this is not the one for you. This brownie is in between a cake and a brownie. LOL. But it is delish! One tip: don't beat the dry ingredients into the wet or the brownie will become airy like a cake. Also, I baked them for only 25 min so they did not become overcooked. This was really yummy!"
"0","5","My husband loved these brownies. OO yes I agree with prior comments, only use half the sugar in the frosting."
"0","5","I am a special education teacher and cook/bake with my students each Friday afternoon to develop social and life skills. I am always looking for delicious yet simple recipes. This one definitely hit the mark! We doubled both the brownie and icing recipes. For the icing, we used a little less than 6 tablespoons of butter, 4 tablespoons of dark cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of regular cocoa powder. We also a little milk to make it easier to stir and the consistency a little smoother. For the brownies, we used 1/3 cup dark cocoa powder and 1/3 cup regular cocoa powder and kept everything else the same. We each took a turn making a stir and stopped once the ingredients were barely combined. We cooked them for 21-22 minutes and they came out perfectly--the rich flavor of a brownie but not quite so chewy (but certainly not cakey). This will go in our end of the year cookbook as a great success!!"
"0","5","I thought these were pretty tasty. I took the advice of mixing it by hand, and it turned out more fudgy than cakey for me. I also used kosher salt and put in a little more cocoa powder. I baked it for about 24-25 mins. I'd like them a little chewier, but maybe they will be after they cool a little more. I couldn't wait to try one. :) I'm pretty pleased, especially considering how easy they were to throw together."
"0","5","I will NEVER make brownies from a boxed mix again - this was almost *too* easy and too good to be true- but it's not! Made these last night for a going away party for a friend, topped with mint-chip ice cream, and we were all thoroughly delighted. De.Licious."
"0","5","F*CKING AWESOME!!! used brown rice flower, organic cacao butter and organic cacao powder and organic honey powder. Everyone loves them. If you dont like these, you have no soul."
"0","4","I just cooked this recipe. I don't have sugar tongue so it's kinda sweet for me. But it's yummy. Maybe next time, I'll just put lesser sugar."
"0","5","These brownies were fantastic - MUCH better than anything you would make from a box. The consistency is more fudgy - I don't understand the reviews that said they were cakey unless they were overbaked? I did 25 minutes exactly and they were perfectly moist. I did make the frosting without the honey and added milk to make less dry- just eyeballed it. Left it somewhat stiff though and spread it on while the brownies were warm as the recipe specified and that helped it to be more spreadable. Delicious!"
"0","5","By far the best recipe I have made on this site so far, they turned out perfect. Moist, dense and flavorful. I doubled the recipe to make in a 9x13 pan, and one thing I added was when I melted the butter, I also melted one cube of bakers chocolate with it, to add some additional fudge flavor. Turned out amazing, this will be the only brownie recipe I ever use. Thank you so much for sharing it!!"
"0","5","Fudge-y, moist and absolutely delicious! I didn't do the frosting becauser they are perfect enough as is. I also did NOT blend - just mixed with a wooden spoon. Turned out perfectly!"
"0","4","Good stuff! I will never buy 'box mix' again!"
"0","5","Wow - these were really good. I followed the recipe exactly and took out of the oven after 25 minutes. The brownies came out fudgy - the way I like them. I took other reviewers' recommendations and did not stir the batter for too long. Next time I'll try the frosting."
"0","5","These are truely the BEST! My frosting was too thick so it needed a tad of milk. My new favorite recipe!"
"0","5","The brownie was delicious (I added some crushed walnuts simply because I like brownies with walnuts). Be sure to beat the frosting for at least 5 mins and with a handmixer. Comes out fudgelike, then flatten it out on the hot brownies. Had made it as a birthday present for my personal trainer and my husband and I had to restrain ourselves from demolishing them after having 2 brownies to taste :-)"
"0","5","I make these with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar... leaves them always wanting more!"
"0","5","Wow! This by far the best brownie batch I have ever made...must include the icing. Used 1/2 t. vanilla in brownies per other reviewer suggestions."
"0","3","Definately cake like brownies. Was quiet disappointed :( I was looking for a quick, easy and good recipe to replace the box kind. This was NOT it for us. I liked how quick it was, but the taste and texture just wasn't there. Too gooey and a strong butter after-taste."
"0","4","I made this without the frosting, also I used 70% dark chocolate instead of cocoa. Really delicious."
"0","1","Not sure what went wrong but these bombed. Back to the drawing board."
"0","4","I made the recipe without the frosting and thought it turned out good. I took the advice of the other reviewers and did not overmix the batter. One thing I would change is the amount of vanilla extract...even the 1 tsp for the batch was too over powering."
"0","5","Amazing!"
"0","5","frost with Peanut Butter Glaze - Amazing!!"
"0","5","I've made these plenty of times without the frosting. They are fantastic. I decided to make the icing one day and I ALWAYS make the icing now, It makes the brownies a million times better. I didn't use honey however, I used a splash of soy milk. Amazing...especially when you're craving chocolate."
"0","5","Easy, ingredients on hand. Great for a chocolate fix. Didn't make the icing, they really don't need it. If you're lookin for fudgy...this one is it."
"0","5","These brownies are awesome!Some of the reviews I read said that they turned out like cake squares, but mine turned out to be fudgy-definitely brownies! Will make these again and again-no more boxed mix for me!"
"0","5","so yummy without the frosting, don't think they will last long!"
"0","5","These brownies were awesome, even without the frosting."
"0","5","I didn't want to go to the store and I had all the ingredients for this recipe at home. They were so easy and delicious!! With or without the frosting, they are now my favorite!"
"0","4","Wasn't a huge fan of the frosting, otherwise these were wonderful."
"0","5","These are outrageous! I am living in Chile with a Chilean family right now. I made these brownies for them and I've never seen them so happy before. They said it's the most delicious desert they have ever tasted! I would definitely reccomend them for everyone. Definitely only cook them for 25 minutes. that way they are chewy and fudgey. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","2","These aren't brownies to my definition. When we think brownies they're soft and chewy. These were more like a sort of cake. They tasted good as cake, just were not brownies which is why I gave them the 2 star rating."
"0","5","This is a fabulous recipe for those who don't have time to wait for Baker's chocolate to melt. Using the unsweetened cocoa right near the stove makes baking delicious brownies a snap and the frosting just puts these brownies over the top!"
"0","5","These are very good and very easy! I didn't make the frosting. Next time I will add chocolate chips."
"0","3","I made these today. Wasnt really head over heals with them. I tasted them without the frosting and did not like them...added the frosting and liked them a little better. Not sweet enough without frosting. Ok..I will try again."
"0","5","What a great, basic brownie recipe! I made the batter as written, beating my eggs before adding to the rest of the ingredients and mixing everything by hand. I added a layer of chocolate chips & chopped walnuts on top and baked in a 9x9 pan for 23 minutes. I can't wait to use this base recipe to experiment with different frostings/toppings/layers/candy additions!"
"0","4","different from box brownies I'm used to, but very good chocolate flavor, would make again."
"0","5","GNARLY-GOOD BROWNIES!!!!!"
"0","5","These brownies are the best! I made them three times and my family loves them!"
"0","5","These brownies are delicious! I changed the recipe by omitting 1 egg, the baking powder, and (accidentally) the salt. Being in Germany, I had to use the metric conversion and only put in 100 g of butter rather than the 115 that is called for. I couldn't find any vanilla extract, only ground vanilla, and put that in instead. I also substituted a gluten-free cookie and cake flour mix for the flour. It turned out very good without any toppings or icings, with an amazing texture. It didn't taste gluten-free at all. I was told to make another, bigger batch soon. It took a bit longer to make than the recipe calls for, which I find with all gluten-free brownies, but it was only by a couple minutes. Then only change I would make is to go from 200 g of sugar down to 150 g."
"0","5","These brownies were fabulous!! But the frosting was not! I will make a different frosting for the next batch. But I would not change a thing about the brownie recipe!"
"0","5","Instead of the frosting I added chocolate chips on top of the batter. Excellent!"
"0","5","The best brownies indeed for my taste.. cake, fudgy chocolaty texture and just sweet enough. If you double the recipe, I follow the recommendations of another reviewer of just adding 1/4 tsp of salt. Thanks for teh great recipe.."
"0","5","I have found that by cutting out the baking powder, using only 1/3 cup of flour and using 3 eggs instead of 2 these brownies come out so soft they literally melt in your mouth! I also like to add some dark chocolate chips for bursts of chocolatey goodness."
"0","5","it is really the best brownies. i use the light brown sugar instead of the white sugar, it is still wonderful."
"0","4","I made these according to the recipe, without the frosting, and my family loved them! They weren't too cake-like, like some of the other reviews say. At least to us they weren't. I took the advice of other reviews and hand mixed the batter, and beat the eggs before adding them. Good brownie recipe and we're making them again tonight with chocolate chunks and walnuts!"
"0","4","Brownies are always yummy, but these particular ones are truly the best I've made. I may be inconsistent at times with the moistness because of one major no-no. ->One Warning: Make sure not to overbake these or they'll be too dry. I attempted the frosting with my sister once, but it didn't work for some reason. It was unspreadable and unmixable. Besides that, with a scoop of ice cream or just plain, you're in for a chocolaty treat."
"0","5","I failed to melt the butter in the beginning, as instructed, but I did have soft butter and they still turned out very good. The only change I made was I doubled the recipe and put in 1 3/4 C organic cane sugar and about 1/4-1/2 C organic mayonnaise (for added moisture). Everyone gobbled them up and said this was a 'keeper' recipe! Thanks for sharing this recipe Angie!"
"0","4","Good but not wonderful. I will keep looking for brownie recipe."
"0","5","WOW! You really CAN'T mess these up! I decided to double it, forgot the eggs, and half way throuigh forgot Iwas doubling it. Added the rest of the ingred's in one lump, AND had only HALF the eggs required! They still turned out AWESOME!"
"0","5","Delicious!! Made just as is with frosting."
"0","5","DELICIOUS! I unfortunately have a gas oven which makes regulating exact temperstures for baking impossible, so I tend to burn anything with chocolate in it. Apprehensive though I was, these came out chewy, crisp around the edges and absolutely perfect, not cakey at all. I added 3 tsp of instant coffee to add a cappuccino flavour and and 1 tsp of peanut butter to the frosting to make it a little creamier. The girls at dinner last night ate a whole plate, and my husband asked me to bake a batch for his buddies while they watch the big football match this week. Not typical 'guy' food, but whatever!"
"0","5","I didn't have enough butter on hand so I used half butter half oil and only used one egg...these were perfectly chewy and fudgy like a brownie should be...thanks for the great recipe..."
"0","5","this was super easy and super yummy! i searched quite a bit before choosing this particular recipe and am glad i did. i definitely recommend it. i didnt make the icing because i thought it would be too sweet, and i'm probably right because these were great sans frosting. these are also yummy and good enough for guests served with fresh berries (we used strawberries, raspberries and blackberries) and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Yum!"
"0","5","These brownies are amazing! They are not the chewy, hard brownies I remember as a kid, but light and fluffy; and so easy to make! I've made these about 3 dozen times now and they have not failed me yet (I make these as gifts for the holidays and have received nothing but compliments about them. I've even got a few requests for more)!"
"0","3","The frosting was wonderful..very sweet even after I halved the honey, but very good. The brownies though were very cake-like. If you like that then this is your recipe but i was looking for something more like a real brownie. i also did not think the flavor was chocolatey enough, kind of blan."
"0","5","These are great brownies! My boyfriend said that they were the best I've made (I usually use a Ghiradelli mix). I used coconut oil instead of melted butter- delicious! I'll definitely be using this recipe from now on."
"0","5","These are soooooo good and easy to make! I made them exactly as directed but left off the frosting as they are perfect without it!"
"0","3","I gave this recipe a three star only because of the texture. I cut the temp. down to 325 for 15 min. and they still came out too cakey for my family. Next time I will cut the time back more to see if I can get a more fudgie brownie. The picture looks great!"
"0","5","Oh. My. Goodness. These were the best thing I could have made for my chocolate craving. I used dark cocoa powder and forwent the frosting, baked it in a round cake pan for 23 minutes and it came out PERFECTLY! None of that artificial sweetness like you get from a box mix. A moist brownie with just enough crunch on the top to add a really delightful texture contrast. I added it to my recipe book right away. Thank you!"
"0","3","I didn't care to much for them but my husband loved them."
"0","5","This recipe ranks as my family's favorite brownie ever. Yum!"
"0","2","My daughter loved the batter, and while they were cooking, the smell was amazing. I just took them out of the oven, and unfortunately, the do seem to be more of a cakey consistency, while we prefer the dense, fudgey type with the crackly top. I even took the suggestions of another reviewer, but it looks like I still overmixed it (btw, I am not a brownie virgin, so I have made scratch brownies before with our preferred consistency. Based on taste alone, I'd have to give 2.5 stars"
"0","5","I have made these six or so times now and they are always great. I always double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan. I never make the frosting. Super fast and easy one-pot brownies that always get compliments."
"0","2","sorry to say but these are a disappointment. they don't even really taste like brownies they need a LOT more chocolate."
"0","5","So yummy. I made a double batch for my family and they were gone in less than two days! My mom who doesn't like brownies even liked them!"
"0","4","This is my brownie recipe from now on! I doubled the recipe and made it inside a 9x13 at 350F for 35min).Didn't use the frosting, was already too sweet for me and I only used 1 3/4 cup sugar(less than 2c which is what recipes lists for double). I used 125grams of butter (a little more than a stick of butter), melted in the micro & then I just kept adding veg. oil to make 1 cup. I think I will reduce sugar to 1 1/2 c next time and not add veg. oil if making it for DH because he immediately tasted the oil in it. He hates oil in sweets and prefers butter :)"
"0","5","THESE ARE THE BEST BROWNIES IVE EVER HAD!!!! YUMMMMMMY... I didnt make the icing, but they were perfect withouth the icing!"
"0","5","Truly delicious easy brownie recipe. Cakey and just the prefect amount of icing. I did add another tablespoon of honey to the icing because it was dry and crumbly but otherwise perfect! These were a real hit at work!"
"0","5","I used special dark cocoa and these brownies came out so rich and decadent. Chocolate buttercream frosting on top really polished them off too. I took them to a dinner party tonight and there wasn't a crumb left. Not too overly fudgy..but just right. Needless to say, they were divine and would satisfy any chocolate craving."
"0","5","These brownies are absolutely awesome! I added a little more cocoa and 1/4 cup more sugar. Amazingly, chocolaty, absolutely the best!"
"0","5","These are true to the title the best brownies I have ever made! Not hard not to much like cake but perfect! Thankyou for sharing!"
"0","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE them! They're not fudgy, which is perfect because I hate fudge brownies. They're not cakey either, they're the perfect blend!! Without the icing it was amazing."
"0","5","Love love love this recipe!!! I only had 1 egg so I halfed it and put it in a cupcake pan. Also I added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips at the very end of mixing. Cooked for 12 minutes and came out PERFECT! So incredibly easy to make...took me 5 minutes to prep the batter. Maybe for the people who thought they came out 'cakey' overcooked them because mine came out sooo chewy and soft...This will be the only recipe I ever use again!!"
"0","5","Those only lasted 1 hour in my house. Everyone loved them. By far the best browies i have ever tasted!"
"0","5","These are fantastic! I only had one egg so I halfed the recipe. Not having a pan small enough, I cooked them in a cupcake pan. Delicious! The middle was moist and fantastic and the edges were perfect brownie edges-only ALL AROUND because of the cupcake tins. Will definitely make again. . . probably still as circles!"
"0","4","I subbed 1/2 of the butter with applesauce and the brownies came out cakey but good. With the frosting, delicous!"
"0","5","AWESOME!! These were super easy to make and came out terrific. I will never again buy the box-brand. Just as the recipe and other reviewers have stated, be sure not to over-bake. I baked mine at around 22 minutes and they came out absolutely perfect, thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'll definitely will be making these again."
"0","5","I was looking for a good brownie recipe to make for my boyfriend, and he loved these! I added some Hersheys syrup into the batter and a little extra cocoa, since I like them extra chocolatey. They are definitely the best brownies I've ever made!"
"0","5","Very good brownies. Come out perfect every time even if I'm running short on a few of the ingredient amounts. Once I didn't have quite enough butter, still perfect. Twice I only used one egg. Still perfect. Love this recipe."
"0","5","These brownies were so delicious. I followed the recipe just as is but didn't make the frosting because we prefer just plain."
"0","5","These were delicious!!! Moist and chewy, just how I like my brownies. I have yet to make the frosting, as I like my brownies plain."
"0","5","Truly the BEST BROWNIES I've ever had/made. Just made this recipe and the only thing I did different was double it to fit a 13x9 pan. DELICIOUS! It had a firm crust on top and was fudgy inside. These were just good. The flavor was amazing! THANK YOU ANGIE!!"
"0","3","Let me start by saying I did not make the glaze and I will likely give these another shot with the glaze ... however based on the reviews I didn't think it would be necessary. These brownies were good but certainly no better than a good box mix... they were easy to throw together but I wouldn't agree with the 'best' title. I like the texture but thought the flavor was lacking."
"0","5","Thank you Angie and CRBOWLES...the recipe is great and the mixing tip was awesome! Also key not to bake longer than 25min with a preheated oven."
"0","5","After reading the reviews I could not wait to see how these brownies turned out. I followed the advice to gently stir the ingredients together and not over mix. I have to say that they were delicous and so easy! I baked 25 min and they were very moist. Not dense and heavy but tasted like an awesome brownie. I agree no icing is needed-sweet enough as is."
"0","5","This is the first non-boxed mix that I've ever baked with, and the result was excellent. Very easy and delicious."
"0","4","Had this recipe for a year now and it never failed me! Be making this brownies again and again.."
"0","5","These were amazing! I took one reviewer's advice and hand mixed everything, and I got the brownie texture I'm used to. I always like everything with extra chocolate, so I put chocolate chips in the butter while it was melting, which also adds a little moisture. Awsome recipe, I'll be using this again!"
"0","4","This is my husband and I's go-to recipe for brownies whenever we have the munchies at 10:30 p.m.! They are really easy and quick to make and come out tasting very delicious. I have never made them with the frosting as we are too hungry to bother with that. They are not the best brownie I have ever tasted, but they are really good."
"0","5","These really are the 'Best Brownies'. They are very addicting. I didn't have any powdered sugar so when they came out of the oven I tossed on a half bag of dark chocolate chips, waited for them to melt, then spread the chocolate around evenly. I also used dark chocolate cocoa powder. Since ovens vary along with cooking times for batch sizes, I'd suggest using the 'toothpick' rule. When it gets close to the suggested cooking time, insert a toothpick in the middle, if it comes out clean, it's done, otherwise, put the brownies back in the oven for a few more minutes."
"0","5","My boyfriend made this for us last night, and it was really good. He reported that this recipe was really easy to follow. He mixed in some chopped walnuts, with additional sprinkled on top for a beautiful presentation. The top was nice and crispy and the inside was soft and gooey. There were leftovers, which was better the next day. We left out the frosting and we shaved a little bit of sugar off also (we cannot eat too much sweet)."
"0","5","I made this recipe but with a few slight changes: 1) I used vegetable oil instead of butter (I did try it with butter but prefer the oil version); 2) I didn't have vanilla and the recipe worked out great anyway; 3) I did not make the frosting, as these don't really need it at all, they are amazing as is; and 4) as the recipe says, it IS really important not to overcook these. I put them in for 20-23 minutes, if they're in the oven any longer they're more like cake. Definitely grease and flour the pan. Makes about 9 servings. These are so wonderful, even the way I've been making them, and some friends have asked for the recipe. This is an excellent one!"
"0","5","I made no changes, and made sure I didn't overmix it by hand. (I love easy recipes that don't need a mixer). I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of half the pan. We had company and everyone enjoyed it; didn't even make/or need the frosting on top."
"0","5","this turned out great! i used the half amount of the original recipe which makes 8 servings. i took the advices from other reviewers, i didnt overmix and i cooked it for 24 minutes. i didnt even poke the brownie to check if it's done or not, i just took it out as the timer went off. and it turned out soo moisty and perfect. becuz it was so sweet and great itself, it didnt really need frosting on top. the next time i get to make it, im not going to make frosting. this recipe is great and its going into my recipe box!"
"0","5","these are fantastic- they are not cakey and not fudgey. We add chocolate chips & walnuts- yumm!"
"0","5","Oh my gosh, these are seriously the best brownies ever! They really do always turn out and are super delicious!"
"0","4","My first recipe here. It was great. I did not use the icing. I did find the key to this recipe is putting the flour in last and slow.I will never buy box brownie mix again."
"0","5","These turn out well. I double the recipe using only 3 eggs(jumbo). as for the frosting, i didn't add honey to it since i have a 9 month baby that can't have honey. i add a little water to it...still good...kids love it....the brownies haven't even cool down yet and we're eating it away!"
"0","4","They are good but a bit sweet for me. Very easy to make and moist enough!"
"0","4","Very good, as brownies always are -- I used expensive cocoa powder and vanilla. Not sure these were 'amazing', but definitely a good brownie!"
"0","5","These brownies are amazing!! My husband and I used to eat the boxed brownies because I never came across I brownie recipe that we liked, until now! Now he won't let me make any other brownies! The name was right, these are the best brownies!!"
"0","4","I give this recipe 4 stars because the brownies didn't have that smooth, shiny top that I prefer. Maybe I made a mistake along the way (if someone knows what that might be, let me know), but mine had lots of bubbles throughout. I wasn't going to make the frosting until I saw how the surface looked, then I came back and made the frosting. I must say the finished product was pretty wonderful!"
"0","5","I don't make the topping part because the brownies are just so wonderful by themselves. They're always fantastic!"
"0","4","This was my first time making brownies and it came out wonderfully! I mixed everything by hand as was suggested by others. I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chips before baking. The only trouble I had was with the frosting, which i wasn't able to spread. I added more butter, honey, and vanilla to make it spreadable. I suggest halving the powdered sugar if you intend on making the frosting. The brownies themselves came out wonderfully! I don't think i'll be making frosting next time though. Great recipe! :)"
"0","5","These were perfect! I will definitely be making these again. Only thing I changed was using wheat flour in place of all purpose and I stirred everything by hand as opposed to mixing as was recommended by others. I absolutely loved these brownies, I think next time I may add chocolate chips right before baking because I like chocolate chunk brownies. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","The name of this recipe is perfect! They are absolutely the BEST! So moist! I added mini chocolate chips and I omitted the frosting and they were awesome. They reminded me of the brownies that Applebees used to have on their menu. They were all gone in a day!"
"0","5","These are so yummy. I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan, but only used 3 eggs and added almost a whole cup of the cocoa powder. Cooked them for 30 min. and did not frost them. Fudgy and delicious!"
"0","5","I baked these in silicone baking cups (1 serving per cup). 17 minutes worked great. Very, very, good. I would recommend cooking spray in each cup; however, these are not as greasy as I expected. VERY GOOD \(^_^)/"
"0","3","very basic, and sadly did not satisfy my chocolate cravings."
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan. Added a bit of milk to the frosting to make spreading easier. So good."
"0","5","WOW!!! These are honestly the best brownies I have ever made pre-packaged or homemade. I subsituted SmartBalance (Omega 3)stick butter and whole wheat pasty flour and added just a bit more sugar by taste. They turned out amazing!! Next time I am going to try subing honey or splenda for the sugar. Then I want feel too guilty for indulging in this yummy treat."
"0","4","I just made these brownies and they taste really good. I had a problem with the frosting though. It seems there's some liquid missing from the recipe. The frosting was too dry to be mixed. I added a little milk, about a teaspoon, and that fixed the problem. Like stated in the recipe, I put the frosting on when the brownies were still warm and it basically took off the top of the brownies so it ended up being a mix of frosting and brownie crumbs on top. Next time, I will either add more milk to really thin the icing so it spreads better or I will just omit the icing as the brownies are good on their own."
"0","5","My 10 year old found this recipe and we decided to make them. They were so easy to make, he did most of the preparing except beating the last few ingred.,I had to help him. We read the reviews first and went with only baking for 20 min. They are delicious! We didn't make the frosting and instead poured melted peanut butter on top.YUMMY! I used a wisk instead of the mixer and it worked great. One pot, One Pan, 20 min. PERFECT!"
"0","4","I've found that these brownies only need to bake for about 15 to 17 min, not 25 to 30. Also the Frosting is very hard to spread. I added a tablespoon of milk, and that solved the problem. But over all, lovely recipe!"
"0","5","I'm never making brownies from a box again. These were amazing! And I didn't even need the frosting. They were gone within 15 mins and that was a double batch!"
"0","5","Great brownie recipe. I made them without the frosting and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the cooled batter before baking. Yum."
"0","2","I am sad to say I usually agree with the majority of reviews, but I gotta disagree with this one. I opted to not do the frosting and used the brownies as a base to sundaes. I doubled the recipe, omitted an egg and only baked 20 minutes of the recommended 25-30. They were still moist in the center, but still tasted cakey and were dry. I did not overmix as I read the reviews warning against this. The flavor was also one dimensional. I'm going to stick with the recipes which use vegetable oil instead of butter to get the fudgey consistency. Better luck to those of you who made them."
"0","5","Awesome basic brownie recipe."
"0","4","Great brownies. If they came out dry, you cooked too long. I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chunks for more moisture. I also mix the eggs and sugar very well (disolving the sugar) before adding the melted butter...the consisitancy is so much better. Enjoy!"
"0","3","This was the first time I've ever made brownies from scratch. I'm usually a 'just add water' type of chick. This recipe was easy and quick. My result: cake-like (kinda dry) brownies that taste pretty good. I used a dark pan and mixed by hand so as to not over-mix but still didn't get the chewy, moist brownies I wanted. Alas, I will make this recipe again and maybe tweak it a bit."
"0","5","SOOOO GOOD!!!! I made them twice in the past 2 days b/c the first batch was gone already!! The first time I made the serving size in the 8x8 glass pan and used a mixer to beat the ingredients, they turned out delicious and chewy! The second time I doubled the recipe and used a 9X13 dark pan, didn't use a mixer to beat the ingredients, and they came out cake-like but still very good! So it could be the way you make them that affects their turnout... either way these are YUMM-O!!!! :)"
"0","5","I usually don't leave reviews on recipes but i felt the need to this time. I just got done making the brownies, letting them cool off and cutting them. I had just a little piece and thats enough for me for now. They are SO rich and moist. First time making brownies from scratch instead of box mix and WOW, what a difference. I doubled the recipe and made a 13x9in pan and took suggestions from other reviews and used one less egg and stirred rather than beat. They were done in 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe. They're sure to be a hit. :)"
"0","3","I made these following the recipe listed. They aren't horrible, but not great either. As others had mentioned, definitely a cake like consistency as opposed to brownie like."
"0","4","These were good but cake like maybe i whipped the batter to much will try not to next time and let you know but it was really good"
"0","5","These are AMAZING!! I have been using my same recipe for over 25 years and thought I give these a try for something different. These are my new favorite brownie recipe."
"0","4","This is the first homemade brownie recipe that has turned out really good! I made a few changes however. I ran out of sugar in the middle so I used a little more than 1/2 cup of white sugar, and the rest brown sugar. I also had a can of mixed nuts handy so I chopped them up and added about 1/3 cup to the mixture. For the frosting I divided it in half, and drizzled it on top. For the frosting you have to heat it up and then drizzle right away because it hardens fast. Finally I sprinkled some chopped nuts on top of the frosting. These brownies were really rich, fudgy, and delicious!"
"0","5","Really moist and not cakey. I read other reviews about not over mixing and put the dry ingredients in my mixer first then the wet ingredients on top and mixed for no more than 2 minutes, stoping halfway to scrap the sides and bottom with a spatula. Also I didn't use dry cocoa, I melted 1/3 cup semi-sweet ghiraddelli chocolate chips in the microwave for thirty seconds at a time until they were creamy. Alot of recipes I've tried are to rich and cakey, this is my go to brownie recipe from now on."
"0","5","THE most amazing brownies ever!"
"0","5","Great for Chocolate Lovers. The Honey adds a very sweet & delicious kick to this recipe!"
"0","5","I brought these to a casual outdoor wedding last weekend and they were very well received. They were moist, chewy, sweet and very chocolately. I didn't change a thing! The only thing I did was double the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. I did not double the frosting recipe however! The original amount was just enough for a thin layer of frosting, which for me is just enough since I don't usually frost my brownies. This is a great recipe and best of all it's very simple to make with ingredients that I almost always have on-hand. I'll never buy a box mix again!"
"0","3","Eh...they aren't as great as the reviews made them out to be. They taste good, but no better than any other brownie out there. So far, I've tried a half dozen recipes, and the best one remain chocolate syrup brownies."
"0","4","I used cream cheese store frosting the first time I made them and it was just too much sweet. I seem to have trouble knowing how long to bake them for in an 8x8 glass dish too. But every time, the brownie part still tastes good!!"
"0","5","These brownies get 5 stars because they are the first recipe I've ever made that I would prefer making over a Betty Crocker boxed mix. I like fudgey brownies and these were fudgy while not being a total slab of chocolatey tar in the pan. They were also so very easy to whip up, one bowl and the butter didn't even have to sit out to soften - two gold stars in my (cook)book. The recipe as written filled the 8x8 pan with a moderately thick brownie, which I liked as some box mixes designed for multiple pan sizes almost overwhelm my little brownie pan. Not being a particularily accomplished baker getting acquainted with a new oven I did undercook these at 28 minutes, but I look forward to working out my perfect baking time with lots of 'failures' :) Thanks so much for this go-to recipe."
"0","4","These are so easy & delicious that I cannot imagine buying the store brand again. I used the Hershey's special dark cocoa, which made them extra delicious. No frosting for me - not needed. The office loved these & ate them up in minutes. I will make again & again."
"0","5","This is what I make when people invite us over for dinner at the last minute and everyone is always impressed. I often use a chocolate buttercream frosting instead. I never have any leftovers!"
"0","4","tastes great would be better with chunks!!"
"0","5","I am horrible at making brownies, but these were easy and AWESOME!!! My husband (who doesn't eat sweets and only eats brownies w/ ice cream) had to have these by themselves (no ice cream) the second night. We will definitely make these over and over again. (Also i did not make the frosting, they did not need it)."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly as written and much as I love my kitchenaid stan mixer - I let it be and mixed everything by hand - wasn't too bad on my wrist either! I didn't make the frosting because if I wanted to make a cake I would have - everyone loved these brownies! The only complaint was that I didn't make enough! I will definitely double the recipe from now on! These were awesome!!"
"0","5","At last! Finally a brownie recipe that makes me want to eat the whole pan. (Wait, that is a bad thing!) I have made this recipe twice and both times delicious. The second time I omitted one of the eggs and this made them even more chewy. Great brownies!!"
"0","5","This is a great basic recipe for brownies! Though you might want to double the recipe and instead of doubling the eggs to 4, just use 3!! Moist, delicious, easy."
"0","5","This is my first time trying to make brownies from scratch. These turned out great. Next time I will definitely double the recipe and perhaps add a bit of 'cheesecake' swirled on top."
"0","5","Really great and easy basic brownie recipe. Mine come out nice and fudgy. I don't know what the people who got cake-like brownies are doing differently. Maybe mixing and/or baking longer? I have to agree that I don't like the frosting though (way too sweet), so I make mine without. I also like to combine this with a cream cheese mixture to make ultra-delicious cream cheese brownies!"
"0","5","AWESOME!!! So good and so easy!"
"0","4","This recipe is a great basic brownie recipe. Absolutely going to add it to the family cook book. We didn't try the frosting but probably will next time. We will make it again."
"0","5","Yummy, yummy, yummy brownies! I usually add some semisweet chocolate chips to my batch because I love the extra chocolate. Definitely a keeper recipe."
"0","5","These were great, and so simple to make. They are quite thin, but very good. Thanks!"
"0","4","Very easy, very tasty...thanks!"
"0","5","So easy, so good! Mmm these made great treats for my class!"
"0","5","These are some of the easiest brownies,and are the best chewy oowy goowey yummy brownies.My family was fighting over the last one(but in a good way) :-)"
"0","5","Better than boxed brownies! I have never made homemade brownies before, and these were a success! I will never go back to boxed brownies again. I didn't make the frosting. I especially like them because of the portion size. I usually only make them for my boyfriend and I, and these made just enough for us. A 9x13 pan of brownies is good, but naughty to have around. I love how all the ingredients are things I have on hand. I will make over and over again when I need some chocolate."
"0","5","These brownies are fantastic!! They tasted just like box brownie mixes only better. I'll never buy a box mix again. So easy to make! The ingredients are things you normally have on hand too. I'm not sure what people mean about it tasting cake like. they are delicious! Highly recommend this brownie recipe!!"
"0","5","These brownies were the BEST homemade brownies that I have ever made!! They were so chocolatey and gooey just the way a brownie should taste! The recipe doesn't call for random stuff that you can only find in certain stores, it is just basic ingredients that you have at your house! Because of this recipe, I will NEVER go back to the brownies from the box! :D The only minor problem with it was that I had to bake them longer than 30 minutes; but it's ok, it was worth the wait!!!! DDDDDDDDDDDDDDelicious!"
"0","5","They where really easy to make and they were also realy good... =]"
"0","5","The best brownie recipe!!!My husband just give me 'A+' and my son too!!! Thank you!"
"0","3","I tried really hard to like these, but just don't. They definitely satisfied the chocolate craving that i had after reading all the reviews....but after that it was like.....meh?!? The only thing I did was cut the recipe in half...That's it. They were very simple to make, and to be honest I'll probably try again, but it seemed a little too easy of a recipe to have screwed anything up. The texture was a bit weird, but edible. Can't exactly put my finger on why i'm not thrilled. Thanks for the recipe though, I may try again and double the batch for thicker brownies and add chopped nuts and stuff."
"0","5","This recipe went over smashingly! I followed the instructions to minimize beating the ingredients together, and that helped a lot. Everyone loved them!"
"0","4","finally tried out the brownie recipe over the weekend & I was very pleased with how they turned out! Very moist & fudgy! I would have liked a it to be a little bit more cakey - just a smidge more, but I'm still very happy with my brownies. It was very easy to make & follow. Will do this again."
"0","4","Left off the icing and these hit the spot. Bit on the sugary side though."
"0","5","Love this brownie! My husband loves brownies and this is the first time I tried to make them from scratch and they came out great! The only thing I did was double the recipe to make a bigger pan. My husband loves them and was very happy."
"0","5","These were GREAT! Brownies are my weakness and these hit the spot for sure. Can't wait to make them again. They were super easy too! I did add a Tablespoon of milk to the frosting but these brownies would be awesome without the frosting as well..."
"0","5","This was the first time i tried making brownies from scatch. I was very pleased with them. I doubled the recipe. They came out thick, but not cake like.which i was happy with. The only problem wasi had to cook them longer than what was recomended. I also made them with out the icing. I would recomended this recipe. they were yummy."
"0","5","Super yummy and super easy! WAY better that brownies from the box. Didn't make the frosting though, the brownies were enough for me."
"0","2","didn't like them cooked funky. taste wasn't completely bad but not one i would try again"
"0","5","These brownies are super moist and soft, no gross crispy edges. Awesomely fudgy, not fluffy and cakelike if that's what you are looking for. Be careful not to overcook them!! I usually 1.5 x the recipe in the same size pan for thicker brownies. Play around with the amount of cocoa powder. The frosting is great, just a thin layer does it, and the honey makes it glossy. Sometimes I add a tsp of almond extract when I've got it. These are also ridiculous in cupcake form with a thin layer of frosting on top. Make sure you have plenty of milk!"
"0","5","These were my first attempt of making brownies from scratch, they turned out so good...hubby loved them. I left out honey of fear of being too sweet, came out perfect."
"0","5","I've been making these for a few months now, and I've never had a single person not like them... And I've been giving them out to as many people as possible. I use the double batch recipe with only 3 eggs and 1/4 tspn. salt with everything else doubled in a 9x13 pan. I've used white and wheat flour, and both come out great. Everyone who says these are bad is lying to you in my opinion, as I've even had some bakers compliment me on them. Most of the time my family won't even let them cool before cutting them..."
"0","4","These were pretty good, boyfriend said they were 'awesome, better than from a box'. They are in between cakey and fudgy.... I think I prefer mine more fudgy than this.... I might make these again... still they took care of my chocolate craving!"
"0","5","These were delicious. I gently beat the eggs before adding, and I combined all the dry ingredients in a bowl (besides the sugar) and mixed them before adding them to the butter mixture. I also added some peanut butter and chocolate chips to the brownies. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 8x12 baking dish, this made thick brownies. They were done in 45 minutes. I wouldn't say that they were gooey, they were a little cake-like but not that much. I will definitely make these again."
"0","2","Recipe is fine, but the end product is far far far too sweet for my taste. With one bite I thought I was going to be ill due to the extreme sugary taste. Some may love the sweetness, it's just my husband and myself prefer it a little more toned down and more fudgy."
"0","5","These brownies are very good. The icing makes them that much better. They are the best brownies I have ever had. I had to add just a little milk to smooth out the icing. Enjoy"
"0","2","Everyone said that this was the best recipe for brownies so I had to try them! Now I'm here to ask.... What did I do wrong because mine turned out HORRIBLE! It tasted like really bland dry cake. I ended throwing the whole thing away after one bite. Help?"
"0","5","I usually add a handful of melted dark chocolate chips to the melted butter. It gives the brownies a richer, more sophisticated flavor. I've also experimented with using all white vs. 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and both work well"
"0","5","These are amazing!! You do have to watch the time though...They burn easily! Take them out before they look like they are ready. I have made them 4 times!!!"
"0","5","The best! I added peanut butter chips. To the reviers who said it was like cake, I think you overbaked them."
"0","4","I made these for my daughters sleep over. They were easy and delicious. Although I thought that the frosting tasted too much like the vanilla and it was a little hard to spread. Next time I will leave out the vanilla and add some milk to make it smoother and easier to spread. Other than that I will never buy brownie mix again. My daughters and their friends loved them and it's an easy recipe for the kids to do themselves!!"
"0","1","All in all, very disappointing"
"0","5","I added 1 cup butterscotch chips. Delish! I was so affraid to overbake it, maybe it's why my brownie was too wet. But still yummy & chocolaty!! Highly recomended, especially because it was soooo eaassyyy.. to make!"
"0","5","These are great, I like chocolate and orange flavors together so next time I going to try some orange zest too."
"0","4","I like thicker brownies personally, and they were really hard to get out of the pan, but they were definitely tasty!"
"0","5","This is a very good brownie recipe. I have to disagree with the people who say that they come out cake-like. Maybe those people are baking them for too long. The only change I make is to use half brown and half white sugar. Also, I add about a 1/3 cup of chocolate chips and leave off the frosting. We love these brownies! My husband requests them all the time."
"0","5","I had never had much luck with homemade brownies until I tried this recipe. These are the best! I added some dark chocolate chips and nuts also. They Turned out perfect."
"0","5","I have made these many times and everytime I get told by at least one person that these are the best they ever had. A couple times I used light corn syrup in place of the honey as I didn't have any and they still turned out just as well. The icing was just a little less sweet."
"0","5","The recipe was incredibly easy to follow. Based on other posted comments, I decided to decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup as to not make them too sweet and I omitted the frosting, dusting a bit of powdered sugar over them. These brownies are fantastic! I'm not much of a baker and used to travel to a deli to buy brownies like these... Never again."
"0","5","Never going back to box brownies again!!! I did add a little chocolate chips to the batter and made it very rich."
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe! I can't say anthing more, just pefect, especially right out of the oven and eaten while warm..."
"0","5","Absolutely the best. The glaze melts perfectly. No more box mixes for us!"
"0","5","It was the best brownie i have ever made. But instead of using chocolate power i melded 1/3 of a cup of simi-sweet chocolate chips. But after tnat when the brownies came out of the oven i but chocolate chips in top then 2 mins. later i sread then all over the brownies for me frosting i did not use her frosting"
"0","5","These really are the best brownies. I took them in to work once, and now on Mondays everyone asks if I just happened to bake any over the weekend. My twist on the recipe: I use fresh vanilla beans, one half a bean's worth of seeds per 16 servings (one batch of the brownies) and one half a bean on the icing. I scrape the seeds into my melted butter and let it infuse the butter before I add my other ingredients. It's a negligible amount of fluid lost in the brownie batter, but for the frosting you will need to add a couple teaspoons of water for it to mix properly."
"0","5","The easiest and tastiest around. I always double it and serve much bigger portion sizes. Otherwise it would be bite-sized. Great with vanilla ice cream on top."
"0","5","These are the best brownies ever! I actually just mixed everything in the large non-stick pan after melting the butter. Very easy clean up and I baked them for exactly 25 minutes. They are so good!! Instead of the frosting, I just sprinkled confectioners sugar on top. I will never make another recipe!!"
"0","5","This is great recipe!! Easy and Delicious!!"
"0","5","Thanks for sharing such an easy to make and great recipe! everybody absolutely loved it!"
"0","4","very good- buttery and not too cake like. my husband didn't want the frosting and these were plenty good even without it."
"0","5","I dont know how you get cake out of such a delicious fudgy brownie.These were just wonderful.Just a tip for some people getting cake like brownies,dont over mix, and dont over bake.I baked mine for about 20 minutes. Good luck!"
"0","4","This has become my go-to brownie recipe. I double it, omit one egg for extra chewiness, and generally stir in chocolate chips and a packet of instant coffee. Made as-is they bake a bit thin and the frosting has a strong honey flavor, but I love a really thick and chewy brownie, unfrosted, so that's what my alterations achieve."
"0","5","the best brownies ever"
"0","5","This is a wonderful and simple brownie recipe. The trick to this is simply don't over mix the batter. Yumm!"
"0","5","TRUE TO ITS NAME, BEST BROWNIES I MELTED MY ICING A FEW SECONDS IN MICROWAVE AND ADDED A TABLESPOON OF MILK ALSO USED LIGHT CORN SYRUP INSTEAD OF HONEY"
"0","5","This was the easiest recipe I have come across. My family loved it so much it only made it a day. I do agree you do not need the frosting for this one. I will definitely use this again."
"0","5","Very Good recipe my kids loved them. I will be making these again and again ~ they are so easy and economical. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","3","These were good...but definately not the best."
"0","3","The brownie recipe is pretty solid. It's easy and fast.. The icing is a bit of eh.. a flop. it would be better off with fudge icing or pre-made icing. But a very very basic recipe."
"0","5","I added about 1/8-1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Absolutely delicious! Adds unique and unexpected flavour. Icing is also very good, tastes like chocolatey honey. Texture of brownies is perfect for me - not chewy but not cakey, just right."
"0","5","these are excellent. I also doubled the recipe"
"0","5","DELICIOUS! my friends love it!"
"0","5","wow these were sooo good. i didnt change a thing."
"0","4","I made these brownies with my daughters, and they came out pretty good. I doubled the recipe because the only pan i had was too big for the regular recipe. I could really taste the butter in these, but they were chocolatey and delicious."
"0","5","I love these brownies. I changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have any butter in the house when I made them for the first time. I used half margarine and half butter spread (40%) in place of the butter for the batter. I used dark cocoa powder and added about a tablespoon of instant coffee which brought out the chocolate flavor even more. They are more cakelike, we eat them with a fork, but I am not complaining."
"0","4","Brownies turned out great, but I couldn't get the frosting right (even following another reviewers advice about the sugar and butter). Will be making the Brownies again, but probably not the frosting."
"0","5","This was the best brownie receipe I have found! I have tried recipes from scratch a few times and non of them came out right. I didn't even make the frosting and enjoyed these so much!"
"0","4","READ THIS:I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13X9 pan,but only had to bake them 20 minutes,so be careful.These were good and fudgey,but not my favorite.I had to add about 1 Tbs.of milk to make the frosting spreadable.thanks:)"
"0","5","I was able to substitute the cocoa powder for EAS 100% whey protein powder and reduce the suger to 3/4 cup....they tasted fantastic and changed the protein count to over 50g!! perfect for my husbands sweet tooth while he's still bodybuilding! ( its also a great way to boost the protein and calorie intake for picky eating children!)"
"0","4","The taste was great. However, this recipe ended up being more of a semi-dense chocolate cake and not brownies. Loved the chocolate glaze mixture."
"0","2","They were ok, but box brownies have better taste."
"0","5","I didn't make the frosting, but they don't need it. These are the best chewy brownies everrrrrrrrrr. Just make sure that you don't over bake or they will become cake like."
"0","5","Quick and simple, with delicious results. The frosting is hardly necessary, as moist as the brownies themselves turn out."
"0","4","Brownies taste good but dry."
"0","5","The best brownies in the world! i love these!"
"0","2","These were okay. I didn't care for the frosting, and the brownies kind of left a bad taste in the mouth later."
"0","5","These are great. I didn't change the recipe, but I did just make half and do 6 cupcakes. They were so good and didn't fall apart like cupcakes, since of course they are brownies. I put the batter directly into the greased pan(no paper cups), they came out nicely and were pretty too!"
"0","5","These really are THE BEST. So easy to make and i really couldn't stay away from the pan. My family likes nut so i added walnuts and chocolate chips. WHAT A TREAT!!!"
"0","5","These are the best brownies ever! I like to cut them into bite-size pieces. They're always a hit at parties and they're gone pretty fast; I usually have to make two batches."
"0","4","This recipe was very easy and ingredients are items you usually have around the house. I did have some difficulty at first with the frosting because it seemed really dry but then the butter softened enough for it to actually look like frosting."
"0","3","I guess when doubling the recipe I should have taken the advice of leaving out an egg as they came out like cake squares...good but not quite what I was looking for in a brownie recipe."
"0","4","These were pretty good, kinda greasy but the flavor was nice. I added some peppermint extract to kick up the flavor. They were nice and gooey, maybe next time I will use some applesauce in place of some of the butter to cut the greasiness."
"0","5","so easy and they turned out great! if you don't overmix they turn out chewy and perfect. definitely does not need the icing. this will be my stand by brownie recipe for sure!"
"0","5","OK, these are truly scrumptious brownies. I doubled the recipe as is, mixed only by hand (stir well after adding each individual egg), put in a 9x13 pan and baked it for about 35-40 minutes. For the icing, melt the butter, halve the icing sugar, and mix well with a spoon until thick and glossy. If it's not smooth add 1 T milk and/or heat up in microwave a few seconds. Best brownie cutting tool is a PLASTIC KNIFE! You'll be amazed."
"0","4","These brownies were really good! I made some changes though-- (I doubled the recipe) I added a 1/2 tbsp of instant ground coffee, about 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips, and I swirled in gobs of peanut butter once they were in the pan. They turned out great! I didnt make the frosting because I didnt have any powdered sugar on hand but they were still yummy =)"
"0","5","These are sooo good, I chose this recipe since I had all the ingredients on hand. They turned out WAY better than I expected, very fudgy...def not cake like. I didn't do the icing...they don't need it! :)"
"0","5","I have been craving to bake brownies from scratch and find 'my recipe'. Well, after the trip to the supermarket where a box mix was purchased as our go-to brownie option, I decided it was time. My boyfriend sarcastically yelled out 'Good luck!' as I easily pulled together this recipe. As I served up 3 of these with a very tall glass of whole milk, all the boyfriend could say through a chocolately smile was 'These are special.' Thank you, because now I have MY recipe."
"0","5","I was bored this past week and decided to do a little taste test...box brownies or homemade. Although they were quite different this recipe for brownies was MUCH BETTER!!!! I loved them in fact. I will now crave these and I'm not even that big of a brownie fan. Well done! :)"
"0","5","Delicious! The perfect midpoint between cake and fudge. Rich and chewy. I like them better without the frosting... with is a bit TOO sweet."
"0","5","Being someone that loves chewy, cakey, and fudgey brownies equally, I'll start off by saying that these were chewy/fudgey and delicious. The 'shell' was deliciously chewy, yet the very inside of the brownie was moist and fudgey--a disasterously wonderful combination. I did add about 1/8 cup more white sugar to ensure that the brownies would be chewy; I also hand mixed the ingredients. One reason brownies can become cakelike is if an electric mixer is used; too much air in the batter will make it fluffy and hence cakey. We baked it in an 8'x8' dish because I've had a bad experience with brownies turning out too flat; these turned out to be a good thickness (about 1/2' thick). Like people have been saying, they were really rich, so we didn't make the icing (we thought they were just fine without it). Overall, it was extremely easy to prepare. The taste was delicious. I would recommend this recipe to anyone that likes fudgey/chewy brownies."
"0","5","These are brownies!! If you cannot cook them without them being hard then you need to stick to mixes you are obviously not a cook. Thanks for this awesome recipe to share with my family!"
"0","5","This will be my HG (Holy Grail) recipe. I will double it next time, add nuts & eat more before my family gets to the pan : )"
"0","5","These brownies were very very good. They are a little less sugary-sweet than store-bought box brownies, which I think is nice. The rich chocolatey flavor really shines through. I left out the icing and didn't miss it. One thing I wish I'd done differently - I used a 9x9 pan, and I wish I'd done 8x8. I prefer a taller brownie.  EDIT - I just made these again and did make the icing. It makes the brownies a ZILLION times better! Make the icing! :)"
"0","3","These brownies were...good, but not the best brownies I've ever had. They were rather dry, and when I tried to take them out of the pan, they stuck, even though I greased them before pouring the batter."
"0","4","I wondered how so many reviewers could say these were cakey and so many others say they were fudgy as these descriptions are usually so opposite. I made them exactly as written, and they were both cakey and fudgy! Perhaps a better description is that they are really really rich, but not very dense, but tender and break easily rather than being sticky. The frosting was good, but overkill. Next time I'll add a T of milk, because even directly from the over it was hard to spread. This is a good recipe for small bites. A one inch square with a dollop of ice cream is plenty!"
"0","4","I made these early today and wasn't all that impressed. I tried one again after dinner and they really tasted much better after sitting for a while. I followed the recipe exactly (I figured why mess with over 2000 good reviews), except I didn't make the frosting. Not the 'best' brownie I've ever had, but really good. I think I like a more 'fudgey' brownie, so I'll keep looking for a keeper. Thanks!"
"0","5","Excellent! followed recipe exactly. Turns out even if you live above 5000ft. like I do--Easy and delicious."
"0","5","i double this recipe,this is the very best brownies i've ever made,I make them without the topper, these are so good,"
"0","4","So this is the first time I made from scratch brownies. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I cooked it for 30mins like it said and it came out VERY fudgey almost like it wasn't done. I'll try it again and see."
"0","5","AMAZING. I made these for Thanksgiving and had to make them three times over the weekend because people kept eating them up! They're rich, delicious and fabulous. I've also never made the frosting because I think these are sweet enough as it is."
"0","5","These brownies have a great consistency - just fudgy enough. They always turn out great."
"0","4","This recipe was good, BUT it does make fluffy light cake like brownies. I prefer the heavier chewy brownies. But either way this recipe does turn out well and tastes good."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! I made these for a friends birthday that I forgot about till last minute. Super easy recipe, made in a flash. Great for those who like cake-like brownies. I topped with crushed peppermint candy and the minty flavor infused the brownies. Yummy."
"0","5","Fantastic! Make sure you melt the butter! And add milk to make the frosting easier to work with! Add less butter in the batter if you want it to be less fatty. But otherwise, amazing!"
"0","5","Best I've ever had. I've been looking for a long time! Glaze needed a bit more work - I will add milk next time as suggested by another reviewer."
"0","5","this even doubles very well"
"0","5","I've made these twice now, and we all think they are the BEST!! Not cake-like at ALL (stir gently and minimally), very moist and chocolatey (I added an extra Tbsp of cocoa powder), and the frosting is great! The second time around I added a little bit of milk to the frosting to make it a tad more creamy, though it still is very thick. It almost forms a frosting 'crust'. Oh and I spread it on while still warm as others suggested. This is going to be our official brownie recipe from now on. We all say Mmmmmm with every bite!"
"0","4","I rated this 4* as I increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup. I also didn't grease and flour the pan (used a square stoneware baker and didn't have any sticking issues). I used this recipe in a Chocolate Mocha Trifle and turned out great."
"0","1","I am sure these would be better if I had doubled them as others have. The first time with a recipe on this site, I make it as it calls for. I thought these were not good. I am a personal chef and have been making brownies forever. My fail proof recipe is the one on the back of Bakers Chocolate (In Canada). I would not make these again. I tried it because it got such rave reviews."
"0","5","I was quite surprised about how good these turned out, given the simplicity of the ingredients and the recipe. Boxed brownie mix? Who needs it! I added just a teensy bit of almond extract, and it added a nice flavor. Thanks very much for sharing!"
"0","4","These were good. I took others advice and cut down the sugar in the icing...turned out good. I just was hoping for some melt in your mouth-greaaat brownies! These weren't them..they were a mix between cakey and chewy....good flavor."
"0","5","I generously sprinkle the top with chocolate chips before baking...Awesome!"
"0","3","Not really impressed with these ones. I used applesauce instead of butter, so perhaps that was the determining factor.  Definitely not as fudgy as billed."
"0","4","Loved by my husband and brother, followed exactly. This brownie is alittle cakey, to avoid a total cake like brownie take out of the oven early. I put it in the oven for 23 mins. just make sure when you poke it with a toothpick the stick is clean."
"0","5","i had left over chocolate bars from halloween and put crushed up crunch bars in these. they were amazing, i like them slightly undercooked so that they are really soft on the inside. they were remarkable!"
"0","5","delicious brownies! they tasted even better after a day in the fridge. Then they were all gooey. One of the best brownie recipes I have used!"
"0","5","yep, these are the best! i added chopped reese's cups for some extra flavor, but they are great as is also. You can just microwave the butter to melt it instead of heating it with a saucepan."
"0","5","By the time these were done, I was ready to eat the entire pan, however, a little went a long way!! after eating one small RICH square, I was satisfied. These are very rich!! I've never known a brownie to be too rich but this one might come close...excellent recipe that will be made again in our house!  UPDATE:  My 12 year old is learning to bake, and when her and a friend decided to make these, between all the giggling and absentmindedness, I thought for sure they'd be horrible...nope. Definitely a child proof recipe!"
"0","5","Very, very good and only messed up one bowl! I added a cup of chocolate chips and raspberry extract. The chocolate chips made the brownie less cake like and the raspberry extract gave it a new flavorful twist."
"0","5","Really delicious & easy to prepare!!!!"
"0","5","Delicious! So gooey and tender on the inside! Great with warm with ice cream. A HUGE hit with the family!"
"0","5","Made this yesterday and it was loved by all!  I followed the recipe, only adding a little splash of milk to the frosting (I thought it was a little too think). Wonderful and will make it again...probably for tomorrow, as it has already been requested. :)"
"0","5","These were really good. I followed the recipe as it was written."
"0","4","A bit too buttery for my liking. I would use 1/2 to 3/4 of a stick of butter next time. I added coconut to the top before cooking, nice flavor."
"0","5","The best brownie recipe I've come across..really delicious!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and these brownies turned out perfect! They are cake-like but very dense. The frosting was great but I had to tweak it just a bit. I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the frosting. Also at the end, I added a little bit of water to the frosting til it was creamy. My husband took one bite and all he said was, 'You are never buying boxed brownie mix again.'"
"0","4","I made a double batch of these for a family dinner. They were ok, I really thought that they would have tasted much better than boxed brownies but they didn't. The frosting was a little messy looking on the brownies. All in all they were good but I expected better."
"0","5","I made these brownies and they were awesome! I didnt make the icing, and I put them in cup cake liners so they would be highly portable.I am going to make more today and add some chocolate chips.Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe two years in a row for my son's fraternity house. I take them with me for the tailgates at their house. It is easy to make and they are usually all gone in an hour."
"0","3","i did not use the frosting for these brownies because i found the brownies sweet enough as is. i found the brownies very moist but the texture of the brownies didn't suit me. it wasn't fudgy but more cakey. i guess it depends on what kind of brownie you like."
"0","5","these remind me of the little debbie brownies that my sister is addicted to. very good, but very intense. I made mine as written minus the 1T honey (I just added an extra T of butter)."
"0","4","These brownies are delicious. However, mine were a bit of an eyesore. I'm not sure if I was just having a bad 'baking day' or what- but they were yummy. My husband commented, 'They don't have to look Martha Stewart to be good!'. He is right!"
"0","4","really good brownies. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13. I also left off the frosting because they were good on their own. I think i might have overbaked mine just a little. I would like to try again with a little less time and I think they would be 5 stars!"
"0","4","Good but they should be called Best cake-like brownies"
"0","5","Hi this recipe is great! But can you guys help me with something. Why is it that everytime I make this, the center of the brownie collapses and I end up with a brownie with like a pizza crust edge. What am I doing wrong? I followed the recipe to the dot. I even scale my recipes to the gram so Im sure im using the right quantities."
"0","5","I loved this recipe! A friend suggested melting mint chocolate chips and pouring that over top instead of the suggested frosting, it was absolutely fantastic!"
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe i have ever tried. The frosting is so good."
"0","5","Great! I had to add two tablespoons of water to the frosting-- ended up with so much left over, but next time I'll leave it off since the brownies are so moist and yummy without it. Taste almost like a super moist cake!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly as given, and I loved it. The best brownies I have ever made and tasted and so easy. Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","Wow! This is the only time I felt successful in baking, haha! It's delicious. I baked it for only 15 min."
"0","5","A+ brownie! I added pecan and did not ice them and they were great. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box."
"0","5","These brownies were absolutely delicious. I have never been brownies from scratch- but now I'll never make them from the box again. My boyfriend loved them. I thought the frosting was delicious, too. Definitely don't overcook and also do not over beat brownie mixture... I have no idea how couldn't like these babies mmmm"
"0","5","These brownies are divine. The frosting is so creamy. The only thing I added was 1-2 T. water to the frosting to make it a little creamier."
"0","5","This is the FIRST time I've ever made homemade brownies and I couldn't be happier with this recipe! I will NEVER use box brownies again, they never turned out right for me anyway. This will be my go to brownie recipe! Thanks so much! My husband loved them too!"
"0","5","These brownie are moist and delicious! My only guess about the negative review is that her oven needs to be calibrated because these brownies came out perfectly and were fast and simple. Great for cooking with kids!"
"0","5","We DOUBLED this recipe into a 9 X 13 inch pan - We baked them for 30 mins. We also used store bought chocolate frosting and added crushed walnuts into the batter and ontop of the frosting. We also kept them covered in the fridge... and these are AWESOME -- ANOTHER GREAT RECIPE!!!  THANKS !"
"0","3","Ok, nothing special"
"0","4","These brownies are great! My very picky hubby loved them and they are easy and so fast!"
"0","5","AWESOME! I've made other brownie recipes and they all didn't come out quit right. This one takes the 'cake' lol! It's wonderful. I just have to be careful not to make them too often, I'm tempted to eat the whole pan myself! Thanks so much for sharing!"
"0","5","Now that I have found this recipe. It's all I use!"
"0","5","These really are the best brownies!"
"0","5","I make this recipe twice. The first time I made, i followed all the recipe. It was too wet and too sweet. My husband didn't like it. So the second time, I change the recipe. I double the recipe (4 eggs), add more flour (about 1 1/2 cup) and reduce the sugar (1 1/2 cup). I add 1/2 cup walnut and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Also I keep in refrigator for several hours before I cut and serve them. And the result is....AMAZING. I don't even give the frosting. It's great!!!!!"
"0","5","These were super easy to make and really good to eat! Instead of the glaze listed in this recipe, I frosted the brownies with Chocolate Frosting I from this site, although I must say that I didn't think they even needed to be frosted. Next time I make this I will need to double the recipe, because this definitely did not make enough."
"0","5","This were wonderful by themselves and great with icecream."
"0","5","i bake this brwonies but it didnot come out crunchy... can u pls let meknow how can i make it more crunchy on the top ..tnx  p.s but my daughter love it"
"0","3","These brownies did not taste very good. The dough tasted good but not the baked part. i made them today and they have a really weird taste to them. my brother will usually eat anything but he told me that they were gross. i would not recommend this recipe to anyone."
"0","5","This recipe is loved by everyone!!! Easy to make and a great hit."
"0","5","Thse brownies are really rich and chocolaty, just what I was looking for!"
"0","5","These brownies were raved over by anyone I have made them for! I recommend this recipe!"
"0","5","I've never made brownies from scratch. I loved these! I'll always use this recipe, and never a box mix anymore. I followed the recipe, didn't make the frosting, but added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter. The only thing is that I used an 8x8 pan and the batter was spread pretty thin. They brownies still turned out great, but next time I might make more batter so that the brownies are thicker."
"0","5","these were really good!! I've never made homemade brownies before so I was a little nervous but the recipe is simple and the results are so much better than a box mix!! I think the only change I made was to add mini chocolate chips and I skipped the frosting...they really don't need it. Maybe next time I'll add peanut butter chips!!"
"0","5","Great brownie. Really moist. I did double the recipe and bake in a 9x13 pan. It took about 8 minutes longer to cook. I didn't make the frosting, I thought it would make them too sweet."
"0","3","This recipe was pretty good- although the frosting recipe was way too thick and gloppy. I think I'll try it again but use a diffent frosting recipe and maybe mix in choc chips or chunks or something."
"0","5","Mmmm... These brownies were delicious! They are very chocolaty so these are a must for chocolate lovers! They are gooey and melty. We decided to make the frosting and ours turned out weird... it had a really crunchy texture from all the sugar but it tastes good! Great recipe!"
"0","5","this is a great and surprisingly quick recipe!  a few suggestions: -add one teaspoon of armertto, it makes it taste so good -add one and a half times the amount of chocolate to make it more fudge-y  -make 2/3s the amount of frosting, so people can taste the brownies themselves   happy baking =)"
"0","5","Excellent, just don't over bake them."
"0","5","I am an inspiring baker and really enjoyed these brownies. Personally I did not make the frosting. And also would advise to not flour the pan, but thats just me."
"0","4","I baked this in my oven-toaster for 15 mins. increased cocoa by a tsp and flour by 2. came out great."
"0","5","The brownie is really moist, hmmmmmm, taste sooooo GOOOOODDDD!!!"
"0","5","Everyone loved these. I served them to a group of 8th graders who devoured them. One of the boys said that they were the best he'd had, but don't tell his mom."
"0","2","too cakey for me, i like fudge brownies"
"0","5","This is by far the absolute best recipe for brownies and I have tried a bunch. I did add chopped pecans to the recipe, they were fantastic."
"0","5","Delicious! They didn't last long!"
"0","5","These brownies are not only the best, but also the easiest to make. My husband (who by the way is a chocoholic)loves these. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","OMG OMG OMG -- I added 8 ounce block of cream cheese to the frosting. Tasted like a gourmet desert from France."
"0","5","X-X-X-tremly good!!! Ive made them with and without the icing, but with the icing makest them even better than they already are. They are great to make on a whim, because they just use very basic ingredients your normally have on hand. I will never make brownies from a box again!"
"0","5","This is my 1st time baking brownies. This recipe is GREAT!!! All like it... I reduced the sugar and use half of the white sugar to brown sugar, I use more flour and salt.I sprinkled some unsweetened cocoa powder on the top, it turned sooo yummy and looked sooo happy!!! Thanks for the posting. Luv it !! Luv it!!"
"0","4","I used Organic sugar and white sugar in my brownies to make it less processed. The brownies were a bit dry for my taste. May be I should blame it on my moms sugar or this recipe lol. I'll try it with white sugar next time and see if theres any changes in the texture."
"0","4","My husband love them with frosting."
"0","4","followed the recipe exactly, it took an extra ten minutes to cook, and I'm feeling eh. Not terrible, I've certainly made worse but I've had better. Added a mint frosting for a bit of flavor. Not bad. not fabu."
"0","3","I must have over-cooked these because they came out dry and cakey. I only cooked them for 25 minutes. I'm going to attempt these again and decrease the baking time by at least 5 minutes."
"0","5","These are absolutely the BEST BROWNIES around! My husband, who is NOT a sweets-eating person, requests these brownies on a weekly basis. I love that they can be prepared in just one pan, and they ALWAYS come out perfect and gooey. I have never made the icing to go with them because they are just 'THAT GOOD' right out of the oven. I have never wanted to alter that taste."
"0","5","These are the best brownies! And so easy to make, I make them at least once every 2 weeks. I opt not to make the icing its a bit too much for me, but I do add a few milk chocolate chips into the batter and then a few on top once I have the mix in the pan. Also I like my brownies a bit fudgy so I bake it for a maximum of 19 minutes. Add some vanilla ice cream and ummm so, so, good. My dh and I eat the whole pan in a few days. Oh and they are super easy to make, easier than the box brownies and way better too!"
"0","5","Super easy, and positively delicious!!"
"0","4","These are delicious! I've been trying new brownie recipes lately and these are the best so far. Perfect mid-point between cake vs fudgy brownies. I followed the recipe exactly. Watch closely, mine cooked in 23 minutes."
"0","3","These were very easy to make. I usually don't like any frosting on my brownies but I tried it anyway. I failed to read the reviews before starting this and when I was making the frosting I thought it was pretty thick. Since it was too late to only use half the confectioner's sugar, I added another tablespoon of melted butter (you have to melt the butter) and a tablespoon of milk. It turned out very well. It is pretty sweet though. I might use this frosting recipe the next time I make a chocolate cake. I think if I make them again with the frosting I would just half the confectioners sugar as one reviewer stated.  The brownies themselves were a little thin. I don't know if that is because I used an 8 inch round pan instead of square. I don't think there is much difference in the area though. The good thing, however, is that I didn't burn the edges and leave the middle underdone like I always do with boxed brownies."
"0","3","These brownies disappointed me. I followed the recipe exactly, making only slight changes because I live in a high altitude environment. The brownies were very thin and after spreading the icing on them, all I could taste was the icing. I am going to give them one more try, but as of right now I am not impressed. Sorry."
"0","4","These brownies are very good and very quick to whip up. My only problem was that the frosting was too thick. I forced it to spread, but next time I will add some milk to thin it out a bit. I'll be making another batch soon!"
"0","5","I baked these brownies twice. The fist time in small recipe which turned out great. The second time I doubled the recipe and it was way too sweet!!! I suggest following the recipe except adjust the sugar levels for your health."
"0","5","No changes necessary, these were fantastic! Don't skip the icing, it makes them even better!"
"0","4","plain but good"
"0","5","doubled the recipe.. it was the BEST!"
"0","5","These brownies are really good! They don't even need the icing. They're so easy to make, too."
"0","3","Not very fluffy, but I used the original recipe in a 9x13 pan. If I had doubled it, the brownies would have turned out better, but this time around they weren't any better than a box mix."
"0","5","Incredibly easy to make, took me maybe 5 minutes to whip up, and the results were great."
"0","5","Very tasty brownies! For the frosting I melted the butter and only used 1/2 the sugar. It made a nice glaze. I have already used this recipe 3 times!"
"0","5","I have been making these brownies for years and I love them. I wanted a brownie that I could make from scratch and stop buying all those box kind that my husband loves. Well, this is it! By far, the best brownie recipe. The name suits it well."
"0","5","This is the best homemade recipe I've ever made, absolutely delicious! I let the brownies cool before I put the frosting on, I didn't have time to make the frosting when they came out of the oven, so I frosted them right before we ate them instead. Perfect consistency and taste was amazing. I will never buy brownie mix again!"
"0","5","They were cakey and fudgey. Delicious!"
"0","5","These brownies were delicious! I'll never have to buy another box brownie mix again. I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't make the frosting. They were so fudgey that it really wasn't necessary. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","For me, the name of this recipe is most appropriate. These are definitely the best brownies I have ever made. As others have said, they are not fudgy and they are not cakey...kind of inbetween. I doubled the recipe, keeping all ingredients and amounts as called for (just doubled). I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 25 minutes. I checked it with a toothpick. Oh my..so yummy. I did not frost them. I figured with a cup of butter, I had all the fat and calories I needed. I used Ghiradelli chocolate..mmm mmm good!!!"
"0","3","Just okay. I had high hopes for this recipe, but i found the brownie pretty bland. Try Ina's recipe instead - you won't be disappointed!"
"0","4","Wow these were really good my 1 year old daughter defitnitly ejoyed this recipie however i think that the brownies came out alittle too dry for a brownie. they had the consistency of a cake like mixture, but it didnt taste bad. I like my brownies to be moist and smushy and chewy.. yummm but if u like brownies it wouldnt hurt to try this out!"
"0","5","The first time I tried this, I made my usual substitution of egg white for eggs. That batch didn't turn out. But when you follow the recipe exactly, it makes the perfect brownie. I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips, because that's my family's favorite. But this is the perfect recipe for brownies."
"0","5","They turned out more than perfect!  LOve them! will make them again and again..."
"0","4","It was very good. But careful not to shake it when it's not done fully."
"0","3","These were just okay for us. I was looking for a more dense, fudgy brownie. We did leave off the frosting and serve them with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Absolutely loved them!!"
"0","4","Skip the frosting, it is too sweet. However, the brownie itself is GREAT! Everyone should give it a try."
"0","5","AMAZING. They are perfect when they're nice and warm, served over fresh homemade ice cream. They also are great a few days old. Most brownies get all dry and crumbly after a few days, but these just get better!"
"0","5","I was looking for a cookie/brownie I could make with the few ingred. I had on hand. This was great! My husband loved the frosting so much he has requested it on other cookies and baked goods. Of course, he always wants to lick to spoon as well!"
"0","5","These are very good and will fix any chocolate craving you have. Should've made a double batch...or maybe it's good that I didn't..."
"0","5","These brownies are wonerful! Since I'm more of a 'brownie w/out frosting' girl, I omitted that part but, I don't think anyone missed it. I made them for my boyfriend and his friends, let's put it this way, they were asking for more!"
"0","5","These brownies are awesome and can be whipped up really quickly. Could be dangerous when you are craving chocolate."
"0","4","This a quick recipe that hits the spot when you have a chocolate craving. When they came out of the oven, I sprinkled cinnamon on top, which really added an intensity and depth to the brownies. These could be a great base recipe for experimenting with different flavor combos too! I made the brownies in a pie pan and baked them for 21 minutes."
"0","5","I got this recipe from my friend, and I'm glad I did. I added half oil and half butter and it came out even better. I didn't even make the frosting."
"0","5","After reading several reviews, I decided to melt the butter and use only half a cup of confectioners' sugar for the frosting. Other than these two minor changes, the recipe turned out incredibly well. I recommend serving the brownies with ice cream while they are still warm. I will definitely make these again!"
"0","4","Yummy, but nothing amazing."
"0","5","These are fantastic brownies! I made these for a party last night. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13. They were a perfect thickness. I sprinkled the brownies with chocolate chips as soon as they came out of the oven so I did not use the frosting. I served perfect brownie squares with semi-melted chips sitting beautifully and vanilla ice cream. Beautiful!"
"0","5","they turned out wonderful. The baking time was a little longer than i expected, and i had to turn up the heat a bit but the end product was great! Chewy on top and cakey on the bottom!"
"0","5","These are soooo good!!! Very easy to makes.I try to make the frosting and added water.It was a little soupy but delicous.Next time I'll add less water.  Thanks for the recipe"
"0","5","'Best' brownies is an understatement! These are FANTASTIC brownies! I make them all the time...people RAVE about them! When making the icing I have to add a little more water slowly to get the right consistency...but they are so so good!!!!"
"0","5","These brownies are delicious. I love the taste of the honey in the frosting."
"0","5","This is a great brownie recipe. The measurements are great and its quick and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup of nuts...yummyyyyy. thanks."
"0","5","These brownies were awesome! I couldn't stop eating them, even after I gave myself a tummy ache. I don't get the point of heating the butter on the stove, I just melted it in the microwave, them added it to the sugar. Over all, these were the yummiest brownies I have ever had, and really easy, too"
"0","4","These are terrific. Very chewy. I left out the frosting and didn't miss it."
"0","4","Taste Good. Easy to make recipe."
"0","5","I will never buy boxed brownies again! These are what every brownie should taste like! YUM"
"0","5","Delicious!! I chose to use ener-g replacer eggs, and soy margarine because one of my kids has a lot of allergies. I also added chocolate chips (non-dairy). So perhaps because of these substitutions, the appearance was sub-par. In the oven they were bubbling, like the sugar was just boiling away!! I was starting to worry....however they came out fine. They just had a strange bubbly (porous) top that I sprinkled powdered sugar over and that covered okay. Overall I still loved them and will make these again...probably tomorrow!"
"0","5","I just found my new favourite brownie recipe! They are a melt-in-your-mouth balance of deliciousness. Oh, and I tossed in some walnuts, too. Yum :)"
"0","5","My husband brought these to his class of college students (many who had never tried brownies made from scratch) and they raved!! They said they were the best brownies they had ever tried!"
"0","4","These were great, I took them to a super bowl party, everyone loved them Perfect."
"0","5","REVISED: Made these brownies again and baked for less time and added chocolate chips to the batter. AWESOME, thank you."
"0","4","These brownies were darn tasty. I did not make the frosting, and made them in a 9x13 pan as suggested. Kids ate them up, lasted less than a day. Very simple to make. They were moist. Will make them again, but may add choc chips or frosting."
"0","5","So delicious! Omitted the icing and drizzled melted chocolate over the top instead. Mixed everything by hand and refigerated batter 30 minutes before baking. Only baked 22-23 minutes. There is no debate....these are not a cake-like brownie....they are very fudgy."
"0","5","If you like chewy brownies, these are the best. I've been looking for a good brownie recipe for years, and I've finally found one. This is a keeper!"
"0","5","Not sure how ppl can even compare homeade and boxed brownies. These are wonderful and use ingredients that are kept in most kitchens. Definetly a keeper."
"0","5","I give it 5 stars. This recipe is great. My boys really like it."
"0","4","I tried it when it was still warm and it was the texture of cake. Good thing I didn't write the review until after I had it room temp because it became a nice fudgy texture. Very easy to make and a nice rich chocolate flavor but not chewy enough for my taste."
"0","5","Never was into the cakey/fudgy brownie debate. These are quick, easy, and tasty...For me that is all that counts"
"0","4","Very very good, moist and chewy. Good with or without icing."
"0","5","Wow! These really are the best brownies! They are great and while the frosting is good, it is not needed. These are plenty sweet all on their own. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe!"
"0","5","My family and I love these brownies! I have been making them for several years now. I definetly make them with unsalted butter-so rich!Not as good with margarine. Also, I definetly make the frosting- does need some milk. I use real butter in the frosting as well and I let the brownies cool first because I like my frosting to stay creamy. I always have to double recipe! LOVE EM!"
"0","5","I made these last night, and they are the best brownies I have ever tasted. They are not chewy, but they are not dry or cakey. Rather, they have the consistency of a very moist cake. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did not make the frosting, and I baked them for 25 minutes (used the old toothpick test). They are rich in cocoa flavor and taste like an old fashioned brownie your grandmother would bake! I highly recommend these brownies."
"0","5","These are awesome...Not really chewy, but yet not like cake. I could eat the whole pan!"
"0","5","I have to agree that these are the best. I stirred in a some chunky peanut butter to the top for my peanut butter-loving sweetheart.  These will be on my short list for desserts."
"0","4","I made these last night, and even though they did not come out like they were supposed to, they were pretty good. I followed the recipe to the 'T' with the exception of using Splenda instead of sugar. My brownies came out very flat, but still had the taste. I'll probably try these again, but not for a little bit. My pride is a little hurt because these didn't come out as they were supposed to!"
"0","5","So great! Definitely the best brownies I've ever had."
"0","5","My 4 year old son told me I couldn't make brownies as good as the store bought ones....so I bet him I could...  THANK YOU!! I won the bet these were fantastic and super easy. I'm anxious to try the low cal version."
"0","5","I didn't frost them. THey were decadent!! Loved the texture. Moist and almost chewy."
"0","5","This recipe was so simple. It tastes similar to the 'good brand' of box brownies....but so much better. I didn't change anything except I added walnuts to the batter. I can't believe how easy it was. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","Oh my goodness. These brownies are sooooooooo good. I will definitely be making these again, and again!!! The icing is really good, too. I think that's part of what makes them so yummy."
"0","5","They were very very good. It's true, first time for me to bake brownies from scratch, but these were just so yummy. I did use a bit of apple sauce, i did not have enough butter and I did omit the frosting(had no butter left) and still they turned out great! Definitely a keeper"
"0","4","This recipe was great! the batter was more firm which was great for pouring and wasn't as much as a pain as some other recipes. I found this to be delicious and my mom and brother loved them. I loved baking and found this recipe simple and satisfying. I added a cream cheese icing which made it all the better. I creamed 1 pckg of cream cheese and 7 tbsps of butter. Then added 1 cup 10x sugar and 3/4 tsp vanilla. it was a hit!"
"0","4","This was good, and very easy to do. However, having tried the Barefoot Contessa's outrageous brownie recipe, I had to give this 4 out of 5 stars."
"0","4","Turned out really well. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed the batter as little as possible. Turned out closer to fudgy rather than cakey."
"0","4","The brownies were good, but not the best. Maybe I just made them wrong, but the frosting was too dried out or something. Anyway, I would still reccomend making the brownies. They were good, but not the best."
"0","5","These ARE yummy! I added about 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. No need for frosting. Maybe wouldn't say they are the BEST brownies I've ever had, but for the little bit of ingredients and easy to make, they are perfect. Great alternative to the box brownie mixes."
"0","5","These are really good. I will definitely make them again."
"0","5","Everyone loved them. I topped them with a botterscotch topping (melted butterscotch chips, plus milk and powdered sugar), and they were a hit. :)"
"0","5","These brownies were awesome... Really enjoyed the texture. Not cakey but not too fudgey either..."
"0","5","Brownies were great."
"0","5","Mmmm good :) Next time i will keep plain or dust with powderd suger my in laws loved them."
"0","4","I just made these brownies and think they're good, but not great. The frosting is really nice - I did have to add a bit of milk to get a spreadable consistency. I think I'll continue my search for the 'wow!' brownies instead of making these again."
"0","4","Great brownie recipe, and fairly easy to make! Very sweet and gooey. I added walnuts...delicious!"
"0","5","The perfect brownie--chocolatey, fudge-like and chewy. The frosting gives it that extra yummy crunchy top. My husband and son were crazy about these. I hate boxed brownies but was still searching for that perfect brownie recipe--this is it!"
"0","5","GOOD TASTE! i will double the recipe next time with the same amt of butter (1/2 cup)"
"0","4","My family liked these, but said they weren't sweet enough."
"0","5","These are the best brownies yet! Nice and chewy and great with milk! I used room temperature butter which melted quickly and lessened my preparation time. I didn't make the frosting/icing and will add some walnuts next time. These are the 'best brownies'!"
"0","5","Excellent. Followed recipe exactly and it was great - not cakey at all. Make sure to hand mix this or else you'll get too much air into the batter and end up with cake. It does get the same, shiny, crusty top as a boxed mix. It's very fudgy. The 2nd time, I added about 1/4 cup of melted chocolate chips and it made it even more chocolately and fudgy -a great addition that I will use from now on. No need for frosting."
"0","5","These are awesome chewy, fudgy brownies. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 baking dish; didn't even bother with the topping because I didn't have the ingredients, but I did add about 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I made them for my younger son's birthday and my older son has requested them for his birthday as well. This time I might have to triple the recipe so that I actually get to eat one!"
"0","4","Very yummy recipe, went down well at an afternoon tea I baked it for! I did add a few things to the original recipe. But these additions are only for hardcore chocolate addicts :)  To the batter, I added:  1/2 cup apple puree (for added moistness minus the fat of extra butter),  1/2 cup walnuts (crushed),  200 grams Nestle Plaistowe cooking chocolate (dark and crushed),  50-100 grams cocoa powder (depending on personal chocolate level tastes).   To the icing, I added: 3 squares of Nestle Plaistowe chocolate (crushed)"
"0","4","This made a nice brownie, the perfect compromise between cakey and fugdey. I spooned the batter into individual muffin cups to make them handy for packing in school lunches instead of baking in a large pan. You need to reduce baking time, however, if you do it this way."
"0","5","I'd give this brownie recipe 1,000 stars if that were an option! Yumm! I actually used less butter and omitted the honey in the frosting and they came out SO good!! This is a must try and will be my end-all be-all brownie recipe from now on!! Thank you!! A+++"
"0","5","Fudgy, delicious, and SO easy. Key is NOT to overcook them as they can get hard quick. I cannot keep these in the house very long. The family gobbles them up in a hurry. So good with a big glass of milk!"
"0","5","SO EASY TO MAKE AND SO FREAKIN GOOD!!!!!!!"
"0","5","These are delicious. We made a double batch and used a 9x13 pan and baked for 25 minutes. Didn't make the frosting - ran out of butter. Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe!! Exactly what I was looking for! I added chocolate chips to this which made it sinfully rich and fantastic. My husband went crazy over these!"
"0","4","These are good, but it's the exact same recipe that's on the Hershey site. They do have a different taste than using semi-sweet chocolate. Depending on what you're used to or your personal preferences, you will either love or hate this recipe. Nothing wrong with the recipe. We all have different tastes."
"0","5","I followed the baking part to the letter. Out of the oven in 27 minutes they pulled away from the glass ever so slightly. When cooled they were moist, tender, flavorful and delightfully gooey even without the frosting. . The only thing I would have wished for was a shiny surface with a delicate crisp. If you make the frosting I doubt you'd have to worry about that. This recipe is a definite must try."
"0","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RECIPE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I DID WHAT THE RECIPE SAID AND IT CAME OUT GREAT. MY HUSBAND AND KIDS SAID THEY DON'T EVER WANT BOXED BROWNIES AGAIN. THANK YOU"
"0","5","I love this recipe and make these all the time! My step-father always requests these when coming over. Sometimes I make the icing without the honey and just add a few tablespoons of milk. These always turn out great! Thanks for the delicious recipe!"
"0","4","Easy to make but they weren't what I was looking for. These are more cakelike. Icing wasn't that good."
"0","4","These do always turn out. I make these instead of the 'box' now."
"0","4","Yum...it gets even better the next day!"
"0","5","Three words OMG. Fantastic. Best brownies I have ever made."
"0","5","Awesome!"
"0","5","awesome brownies! My b/f loved them. Made three batches yesterday and they're almost gone =)"
"0","3","It was just OK. I'm not a big fan of cocoa in brownies. I would much rather have tried semi-sweet chocolate squares. It just tastes richer that way!"
"0","4","Good Brownies ... but mein also turned out a little cake like. My husband loves em!"
"0","5","Very rich but oh so good! I haven't been able to stop eating them! Thank you!"
"0","4","This is a perfect recipe for homemade brownies. I was a little skeptical reading all the great reviews, but these brownies are truly the best brownies I have ever tasted!... and I'm not a big sweets fan either! Serve with a tall glass of milk or scoop of vanilla ice cream and you're in heaven. I suggest using the topping as it leaves a beautiful shiney topping to the brownies. I found that I only needed about 2/3 of the topping using a thin coat. Also, the topping was a little thick and as another user stated, I had to add milk stirring to consistency. Perfection!"
"0","4","I am amending my review - b/c these are MUCH better the second day. They have a very nice flavor, and texture. Overall this brownie turned out very nice. I like my brownies more fudgy, and this was a bit more cakey to me. I did add both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips, and that made it more dense and moist. My husband and co-workers loved them, though."
"0","5","YUMMY! Everyone especially my husband loves these. We are big fans of brownies and have tossed many batches in the trash. They have to be the right texture as well as have great flavor to pass in this house. These have it all! Chewy edges and fudgy center! I used dark chocolate cocoa and added 1/2 cup of shopped macadamia nuts. DELICIOUS. We all agreed they would be very good with out the icing as well. You will cure your chocolate craving with these for sure! I will be making these again and again.With regular cocoa powder, with nuts, with out nuts. I dont think you could go wrong with these. Did I mention they are super easy and fast to make!"
"0","5","These were awesomely delicious; fudgy and buttery and incredible. Great homemade brownie recipe, and so easy to put together. Thanks!"
"0","5","This was my first time to make brownies from scratch. Wow, these are delicious and very easy! I followed Mama Cass' advice and cut the powdered sugar in half for the icing. I love my brownies fudgy, and I followed another reviewer's advice not to stir too much, so the mixture wouldn't get too much air in it and turn out cake-like. As a fudgey brownie love, I found these perfect! Not as fudgy as I would normally prefer, but definitely not too cake-like at all. Those other reviewers who said these were too much like cake must like to actually taste raw egg in their finished product or something. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, chibi chef!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! Left the icing off, they were so good just like that, I didn't think they needed it! Yummy."
"0","4","A good brownie. Easy to make. I left off the icing, sprinkled with powdered sugar. Yum."
"0","5","These were delicious! I received so many compliments on them when I took them to a party."
"0","4","My family loved this recipe."
"0","5","made exactly as specified, turned out great!!"
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever made. Very good and moist."
"0","5","Aptly named: Moist, dense, easy, perfect."
"0","5","I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips, and these brownies were heavenly!"
"0","4","I been trying many brownie recipes from this site looking for the 'best' one that my family liked. This wasn't it. We still continue to LOVE the Deep Dish Brownie recipe from this site!!"
"0","2","I was disappointed. These turned out flat with a texture that was neither cakey or fudgey. I like a balance of the two, but this was neither. And the frosting tasted too much like vanilla extract."
"0","5","Wonderful! I did not make the glaze and it was perfect."
"0","4","I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan. I used 1 part white sugar to one part brown sugar. I also sprinkled the top with m&m's before baking to make them more kid friendly. They turned out soft and moist. They were somewhere between chewy and cake-like. Didn't even need frosting and I'm a frosting LOVER. Delicious!"
"0","4","I used whole wheat flour, which wasn't the greatest in this recipe, and I also used a larger-than-needed pan. If you're going to use a 9x13, make sure you double the recipe or else you'll have seriously thin brownies. Nevertheless, I ate all of them, they were delicious."
"0","3","While they were pretty good, they were not at all what I expected. I don't know if I did something wrong (I thought I followed it exactly,) but they were MUCH more crumbly and cakey than I was hoping. Again, nice tasting, but in my eyes undeserving of the title 'Best.'"
"0","4","Nice and moist! wasn't crazy about the cocoa flavor"
"0","1","not the best brownies. wrong name. the frosting is too sweet and it's more like a cake than a brownie. the instant brownies is a lot more yummy than this."
"0","5","followed the recipe exactly - turned out fantastic and yummy. Very easy and just the right amount for a sweet something without a lot hanging around to tempt you."
"0","5","These are truly the best brownies I've ever made. They were a hit at our Christmas eve party, everyone loved them. I changed a few things though, instead of regular butter I used unsalted butter and for the cocoa powder I used the regular one...added some walnuts and they came out delicious. YUMMM!!!!"
"0","5","Perfect brownie recipe - be sure to grease and flour your pan well!"
"0","5","The Best!!! Made by my grandson. One change, he had no vanilla, so used almond extract. They were awesome!"
"0","5","Excellent brownie recipe. I can see what others are talking about when they say that there is more of a butter taste to them, but I liked that. I swirled in a cheesecake mix that I made to this. Delish!!"
"0","5","These are sooooo good! I didn't have any honey on hand (for the frosting) so I used corn syrup. I haven't tried it with honey so I can't compare the difference but it was still very good. Definitely give these a try!"
"0","5","Yummmmm!! I have friends that for medical reasons should not eat chocolate, would rather risk physical pain then pass on this recipe."
"0","5","YUM YUM YUM!! main thing is that u dont over cook!"
"0","3","I seem to be the odd woman out on this recipe. It was edible and ok but honestly I've tasted better brownies. I was not in the least impressed and will not make again. I followed the directions and am not a novice so I'm not sure if it's personal preference or what. I ate one piece and hated the icing so I scraped that off. I even followed the suggestions of cutting 1/2 the powdered sugar. I didn't think it had enough sweet flavor or something (the brownie that is) I am not sure what was missing for me but something definitely wasn't there that I was looking for in my brownie."
"0","5","I love these brownies! I have made them dozens of times and they have always turned out perfect, even when I have added ingredients like chocolate chips, white chocolate, or nuts. Just be sure not to overcook them!"
"0","3","Texture came out perfect with 25 minutes of baking. The brownies taste way too much like butter, however. I may try this recipe again with less butter. It overpowers the chocolate."
"0","5","I didn't make the frosting because the brownies are sooooo good on their own. Best recipe ever!"
"0","5","Omigod, these brownies are the best. They are rich, with a deep chocolatey flavor, without being too sweet and overwhelming. I've made this recipe a few times, with and without the icing and they never last long. My son raves to all of his friends about his mother's brownies and my daughter wants to sell them at school! :) This recipe definitely stays in the front of my recipe box."
"0","5","I always use this brownie recipe, but without the frosting. It's amazing, so easy and quick, and they always turn out beautiful.  (well, they're a little hard to get out of the pan for me, but we can't have it ALL.)"
"0","5","Wonderful brownies! I have made several different brownie recipes in the past, some box mixes and some homemade. These are the best i have made. Never make a box mix again. I didnt use the icing because i just didnt have the time. Next time i will double it because a 8' square pan is just not enough."
"0","3","This recipe is a worthwhile, everyday recipe, although I'm a bit conflicted about it. It's good, but not excellent. However, it's easy and rather frugal, and I think the overall expense-and-effort-to-results ratio is very good. Using dutched cocoa creates a lighter, cakelike (almost crumbly) result that requires extra water to make the batter pourable. I didn't think there was enough batter for an 8x8 pan, as my brownies were thin, about 3/4' thick--a 50% increase in ingredients will produce thicker results. Like others here, I didn't need to bake as long as the recipe directed, only 15 mins. The icing is good, but as others said, reducing the sugar by 50% produces a better result, and you will probably want to add a tsp or 2 of liquid for a smoother consistency. Putting these brownies in the refrigerator for awhile firms them up nicely."
"0","5","I have made brownies before but this. Wow! This is the richest and most intense brownies I have ever had. Definitely a keeper. Thanks a bunch."
"0","5","Holy smokes these are good! I doubled the recipe but only used three eggs in a 9x13. It was so good the first time that the second time I dared to add something. I stirred about a half a package of chocolate chips into the batter, then sprinkled some pecans on top before popping it in the oven. My husband said they were AWESOME!! (Oh, and this was my first time ever making brownies!)"
"0","5","I thought that these were fantastic and like so many others say... easier to make than even a box! I added some Hersheys mini kisses to the top and then frosted it and it was devine! This will be a family favorite for sure!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe, and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I didn't make the frosting. These brownies were different from most that I've had, but I was pleasantly surprised. They were spongier than regular brownies, but richer than cake. They were so easy to make, and I only had one pot to wash. I will make these again."
"0","5","Dang, these are the best brownies! Thanks for the chocolate fix. :)"
"0","4","My family and I, enjoyed these. They were pretty good, but very sweet with the icing. I think the brownies will taste great, without it. But if you like really sweet desserts, you will enjoy these brownies. These brownies are thin, moist, rich and kinda on the chewy side. (They will stay moist longer, if you keep them in a tightly sealed container, using pachment paper betwen layers, to keep them from sticking together) If you prefer cake-like (fluffy, rich type brownies), then I would not recommend making this recipe."
"0","4","I found this to be an easy recipe to follow and the brownies turned out moist and delicious. I skipped the frosting and dusted with powdered sugar. I will definitely try it again with the frosting."
"0","5","Easy, quick and yummy. For those who rated this recipe poorly, they must have overbaked because they come you just fine. I didn't make the frosting, I melted some chocolate mint chips on the top and spread them after they melted."
"0","5","Recipe turned out great, thanks! To have ooey gooey brownies, you really need to reduce baking time to under 15 minutes. Seriously. This recipe also goes very well as a base to Cheesecake Brownies."
"0","5","To make the frosting I halved the amount of sugar and added a little milk and they turned out perfectly!"
"0","3","After reading other reviews, I've determined that it must behave differently for different cooks. I found that the brownies were much too sweet for my taste, and the texture was on the gooey side. BUT, with that said, if you like very sweet, gooey brownies, these are for you!"
"0","3","Sorry, I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but these didn't really turn out well for me. Given the enormous number of positive reviews, maybe I missed a step, I''m not sure. I was barely able to spread the batter out to cover the bottom of the 8x8 pan, and they baked up thin and dry after just 25 minutes. On the up side, though, the frosting was terrific, which is why I'm giving these 3 stars!"
"0","5","I made these tonight and they are turely the best brownie I have ever eaten. My husband loved them."
"0","4","Wanted Brownies and quick and kitchen staples in it. I add to 1 Tbsp of espresso powder to mix and frosting. I also wanted chopped walnuts and didn't use the honey but it was thick so i added a drizzle of almond milk to smooth out the frosting. I love this!"
"0","5","Perfect brownie recipe! Not too cake-y, but not too rich that they make you sick. I doubled the recipe and they didn't last long..."
"0","5","This was my first time making homemade browies and they were better than any boxed variety I've ever had, and I've had them all. I added 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter and it made them so chocolaty! If you love rich chocolate tasting brownies you have to try it! Next time i'm doubling the recipe."
"0","5","This was a fantastic recipe! The icing was amazing but the brownies where good enough to be eaten by themselves. I would double the butter in the brownies and maybe add some more honey and some milk in the icing because it was just a little to thick. Overall these brownies where amazing!"
"0","5","These brownies were absolutely delicious by themselves, I didn't even make the frosting! I love their texture, kind of fudgy and chewy and they just seem to melt in your mouth. Half an hour after I took these out of the oven, my brother and I had already ate half of them! I will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","What a great recipe! I have never been a big fan of brownies but I ended up nearly finishing the pan! I made it exactly as written. They can be made with or without frosting depending on your sweet tooth. Will definitely make again!"
"0","4","I found this very sweet. Overall good brownie if you are a chocolate lover."
"0","5","love them ,yes the best...thanks"
"0","2","I do not understand why these brownies are so highly rated! They were okay, but not that great. I would rather use a mix. I followed the recipe exactly, and it did not turn out as tasty as I expected with all of the other reviews. VERY disappointed. I will defintely use my regular recipe instead!"
"0","5","These are so good. I was looking for a brownie recipe to bring to a family party and I decided to try these before party and they were gone within hours my son was not home and they were gone before he got home. I made a 2nd batch the next day and they too were gone within hours! Needless to say this is the brownie recipe I am using for our family party and I am putting this in my recipe book!"
"0","5","I made these brownies and they were gone by the end of the night. Very delicious, but beware -- it's very difficult to avoid going for seconds!"
"0","2","mine came out like cake, and it wasnt sweet at all. :("
"0","5","Never have been able to bake brownies. These work ONLY if you follow the directions to a 'T'."
"0","5","amazing! using half the sugar for the frosting really worked. i also added peanut butter chocolate chips - so good!"
"0","5","Delicious! The batter didn't look like it was going to make much, but it made a typical amount (amount comparable to box mix). I added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and skipped the frosting. Will double or triple the batch next time!"
"0","5","These brownies are SO good! I wanted a sweet chewy brownie but didn't want all the fat, so I used only 3 Tablespoons of Butter and 1\3 cup of chunky applesauce instead of the 1\2 cup butter. That's just too much butter for me! They are supermoist and taste amazing! This will be my brownie recipe from now on!!"
"0","5","Fantastic. I made these with the frosting and they came out exactly like the Little Debbie brownies you buy. Very dark, rich, and fudgy. They held together well and kept great not drying out."
"0","5","This is a very good brownie, I've had better, but not with such a easy recipe. I'm giving it 5 stars, due to the simplicity of the recipe yielding such a tasty treat. All the ingredients are found in almost any pantry. I enjoyed the icing too. I thought the honey was a unique addition. I did melt the butter for the icing, which produced a nice spreadable icing. All around, very good!"
"0","5","I made these brownies last night because I had unexpected company and very few groceries on hand. They were wonderful!!! I added just enough milk to the frosting to make it spreadable. I will definitely make these again."
"0","5","i'm sitting here right now licking the bowl and i have to say that these are the most wonderful brownies i've ever had. i didn't make the frosting, so i can't rate that but if it's as delicious as the brownies it's a 5-star recipe too!"
"0","5","These are really good brownies. I think I should have used an electric mixer for the frosting because it was really thick and impossible to spread. Even so they tasted great."
"0","5","These brownies are the best I ever had!! I did not change a thing when making the brownies. I added a little milk to the frosting because it was very thick. Next time I make them I will double the recipe so they last longer!! Thank you for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","These brownies were great!I sort of panic at first because i used icing sugar instead of white sugar which did not dissolve in the melted butter.But they did mix up after adding the eggs and dry ingredients!"
"0","5","Maybe it's because of where I live, but these brownies took on a super-soft consistency when I cooked them. Completely cooked, of course, and completely wonderful. I made all the brownie mix right in the pan I used to melt the butter. The icing came out very thick for me, possibly because all I had was vanilla extract in glycerin instead of alcohol. Either way, my roommate and I were able to satisfy our chocolate-cravings with this one. It's hard to tell where the icing ends and the brownie begins, they're so delightfully tender and moist. I love this recipe to bits!"
"0","4","I added some peanut butter and cream cheese. They turned out more 'cake-like' but tasted really great and added more protein."
"0","5","Turned out absolutely perfect brownies. I don't like frosting on brownies so skipped it."
"0","5","Amazing"
"0","5","This recipe is excellent! I used the best quality cocoa powder I can find (I usually prefer Scharffen Berger) and I skip the frosting. This is by far the best brownies I have ever made and eaten and it is so fast and easy. To make sure the eggs don't turn into scambled eggs, I prefer to poor the melted butter onto sugar and make the brownie batter in a mixing bowl, rather than in the saucepan as instructed in the directions."
"0","5","I changed some things because I tend to do that. I used applesauce instead of oil/butter, half brown sugar, and used a half cup of cocoa. I also used a 9X6 glass pan because I don't have the right size/type. They turned out a bit rubbery, probably because of using applesauce. Next time I will use butter and then maybe I'll come back and give a better review."
"0","5","Deliciously easy brownies!"
"0","3","These brownies were okay. They were too light and fluffy for the brownies I'm used too. They also had an after taste of deliciousness as opposed to that first bite of rich chocolate. Were good, but not as dense or chocolatey as a brownie should be."
"0","5","SOOOO good!!"
"0","5","Oh. My. Gosh! SO GooD!"
"0","4","these brownies were very tasty, tender and delightfully sweet. alot of brownie recipes disappoint. this one certainly does not. it will be made again:)"
"0","3","Nothing special. I followed the recipe exactly as written and ended by sprinkling pecans on top. I used high-quality Dutch-process cocoa, and I wish I had saved it for something more flavorful than this."
"0","4","These were very good but not the 'best'. I made a double batch but cooked them in two 8X8 pans because I didn't want to change outcome by putting in one pan. I liked the texture but they were a little on the thin side. Instead of frosting I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top when they were cool. I will make again, but I prefer brownies that start by melting a high quality chocolate bar. I think the flavor is more pure intense chocolate. Which is the point of brownies!"
"0","5","The name says it all, Best Brownies. The family LOVES these."
"0","5","Flavor,ease,and time was all Wonderful! Make sure that if you live in high altitude that you add more flour. I didn't and was sorry! they turned out very flat- like 1/2 inch thick, but it is because i forgot to add the extra flour. I would have added at least 1/2 cup more than the recipe called for. YUMM!"
"0","4","This is a great, easy recipe that always gets me raves. I add half a cup chocolate chips - can you ever really have too much chocolate? I use a recipe for creamy peanut butter frosting on top. I've made this four or five times in the last two months for gatherings (and treats for my boyfriend) and the payoff for such an easy process is great. A word of caution - I veered away from the recipe the first time I made these and wasn't impressed. Since then I've gone word for word (the exception being my half cup of semi-sweet chips thrown in at the end) and the results have been stellar."
"0","5","Oh wow! We have just eaten the finished product - delicious! Not a cake, not a fudge. They really are the best brownies ever. The honey in the frosting is lovely, surprisingly. A perfect treat for dessert, served warm & drizzled with some cream. Thanks!"
"0","5","I served these to my students as part of a classroom celebration, and the entire pan was gone in 10 minutes! Next time I'll double it!"
"0","5","Such good brownies...almost too good. I took the advice of another reviewer and melted the butter for the icing and used only half the sugar. Turned out great. Will definitely be making these again."
"0","5","Very good brownies! The whole tray was gone in 1 day at my house. i slightly undercooked them which would be my fault but that just made them nice and chewy. SO GOOD!"
"0","5","These always turn out perfect. I have never made the icing because the brownies are so rich they don't need anything more. I will add in nuts, chocolate chips, coconut, etc and it always works well. The butter can be cut down 1-2 Tbsp and still turn out great. I also love that this recipe can be done in a few minutes, it's almost as convenient as having a box mix and much tastier!"
"0","5","These brownies are out of this world. They are moist, rich, easy to make and always get rave reviews. Make sure to sift the cocoa first-it gives the brownies a silky smooth texture."
"0","5","I've made these so many times -- guess it's time to review! These are delicious, chocolately, gooey brownies that are just as simple to whip up as the boxed mixes and taste LOTS better. For variety, I will sometimes bake them for 5 minutes and then take them out, add a few dollops of peanut butter, and swirl it through the brownie batter gently with the tip of a knife. They are always gone in flash!"
"0","5","this was a prety good recipe. I had a request to make some brownies and found this recipe. I doubled the recipe and added some walnut chips and followed the suggestion of another and used 1c of brown sugar and 1c white sugar. I omitted the baking powder and I only used 3 eggs which was plenty enough. I didn't use the frosting, i just dusted with powdered sugar. will definitely make again...thanks!"
"0","5","I am a fudgey brownie person but not everybody appreciates a brownie that can anchor a boat. ;) These were made for a church pot luck. I wanted something not quite so heavy. Rave reviews from husband so far. I really like them too. Exactly as advertised: a cross between fudgy and cake. The perfect mix. Great job!!!"
"0","4","This is an easy and delicious brownie. I made it without the icing and accidentally sampled 3 of them before bringing them a to picnic. Yummy!"
"0","5","Great recipe... not too sweet; not too bitter. They are nice and chewy and don't fall apart. I did not add the icing though as I have no icing sugar at the moment. I will be making this again and adding chocolate chips next time. :)"
"0","4","Overall good but the texture turned out y too much cake-like for me. Next time I'll double the recipe but use only 2 eggs instead of 4."
"0","5","mine turned out cakey. i'd try to make some again and see how it goes. at 20mins it cooked just fine. :)  --  i just made this brownies again, and they turned out great! moist and chewy!! my coworkers would love this!! :)"
"0","5","Hubby is the brownie expert here. He says FIVE STARS! Liked the buttery flavor! I made the recipe as listed for a 8x8 pan. I only baked it 23 minutes so it did not get too brown on the edges."
"0","4","The frosting tasted fine (I doubled it, but halved the sugar as other reviewers suggested). But, after I frosted the brownies and let it all cool, there was a layer of oil on top that I had to soak up with paper towels- yuck! Don't know how that happened. I melted about 1.5oz of chocolate in the microwave, spooned it into a plastic bag, cut a small corner off, and drizzled the melted chocolate all over the frosting, covering up indentations made from soaking up the butter with a paper towel. They ended up looking quite pretty.  However, even though I sprayed my pan with butter spray, the brownies still stuck and I had to very carefully pry them out of the pan. The end result is a pretty and satisfying brownie. Next time, I won't use this frosting, and I'll probably line my pan with parchment paper."
"0","5","Great recipe - thanks for sharing! Definitely recommend doubling, since they came out a bit thin for my taste. But texture and taste was perfect! Oh, by the way, I didn't bother with the frosting - adding some chocolate chips was enough!"
"0","5","Oh my gosh AMAZING brownies! Really simple to make and so yummy to eat. I will definitely be making these again. I doubled the recipe because personally I like a thicker brownie and it fit well in the 9 inch glass pan. This recipe is a keeper! Thank-you!"
"0","5","These are wonderfully rich brownies. I took the suggestion of doubling the recipe into a 13x9 pan with using 1 cup of cocoa and 2 large eggs. I didn't use the frosting as I am not a big frosting person. These are better than the boxed or bagged mixes you get in the store... and very easy, too!"
"0","5","EDIT: I just made these for the second time and followed the recipe for the brownies exactly. They are DELICIOUS! I added a TBS of milk to the frosting and warmed it before pouring it on top of the warm brownies. YUM!  I added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/2 tsp of instant coffee granules, and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. They were very yummy."
"0","5","These are impossible to stop eating!!! I'm really not sure how the frosting/topping is supposed to turn out... mine was dry and crumbly, but still tasted yummy."
"0","4","these were good, though i used a pan that was a bit bigger so they came out too thin..would double the recipe next time. i didn't find it too sweet as some users have said. very easy and quick to make. i used store bought frosting and they turned out nicely."
"0","1","i really didn't like these brownies. maybe i did something wrong. thanks anyway!"
"0","5","My oh my, simply awesome! So easy and so delicious... skipped the icing too. They were gobbled up so fast!"
"0","4","An easy recipe with a nice texture. Not a fudgy brownie, which is my preference but also not a cakey brownie, which I do NOT like. This brownie falls somewhere in between which is perfectly fine with me. It takes mere minutes to mix the batter up, but following the recipe doesn't make much batter. Using an 8 inch square pan left me with very thin brownies, so if I make these again, I will definitely double the recipe and continue using an 8 inch pan.   The brownies weren't as chocolatey as I would like, so another change I intend to make is trying them with Dutch cocoa next time. I skipped the icing because they were good enough without, and with such a thin brownie I didn't think icing was a good idea. I also added toasted pecans for a nice crunch."
"0","5","tasted great. made them for church and they all got ate. very moist. Didn't make the icing only because I didn't have any more butter though. it sounded great."
"0","4","I skipped the frosting and added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter before baking. Yummy!"
"0","5","I just made these for a church party...and I'm so happy to say that my brownies won the prize!! I didn't make the frosting...and was happy as a clam with how they turned out!! They really are the BEST!!!!"
"0","5","These are always awesome, and don't need the icing (plenty sweet without). I suggest adding either chocolate chips to the dough, or adding a little less than half a cup of fresh raspberries to the middle layer (cover them with dough or they burn) ... or add both! Yum."
"0","5","I've tried so many brownie recipes and this is by far the best one.I even substituted oil for the butter and used whole wheat flour and they were unreal. cooking time was 30 min."
"0","5","i doubled the recipe and used an 11x13 pan, had to bake longer, about 30mins at 300 degrees, middle not done at 20. these really were the best brownies i have ever had. thank you so much for the post."
"0","5","I made these for my husband on Monday, they were gone on Wednesday, and he asked me to make more last night. They are truly that good. What a wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","Yummy and delicious. I sprinkled milk chocolate pieces on top and baked. No need for the frosting when you do this. Time cooked was 28 mins, and I doubled this recipe for a larger dish. I left them in the oven with the door ajar and the temp off for approximately 10 more mins. This set them up just right."
"0","5","Gotta love these brownies! My family gobbled them up in less than 3 hours. It's amazing how rich and moist they turn out. I have even been requested to bake some for upcoming parties.  I added about 1/3 (or less) cup of coffee to really bring the chocolate out. I think the brownies are delicious even w/o the frosting, but if you do, make sure the butter is well melted in order to make a nice glaze.   Overall, these brownies are fast and easy to make. They taste sooo much better than those boxed brownie mixes! I highly reccomend this recipe."
"0","5","these brownies are really awesome! thanks for the recipe. :)"
"0","4","The frosting is too much but otherwise... where did all of the brownies go?!"
"0","5","The kids say they love it, Thank you for this recipe, from my littlest big girl. We used coconut oil instead of butter. It is awesome. They are very good just an extra 10 grams of coca powder made it just perfect with the right amount of chocolatieness as my 12 yr old son said. We made one regular bath and one batch with the extra coca powder.   God Bless"
"0","4","Very good. Though compared to the Ducan Heinz fudgey style, I'm not sure if it's worth the effort. However, they were still very good."
"0","3","Eh, not that great. I was looking for a recipie because of a major brownie/chocolate craving ( you joyce!). These just did not fit the bill. Not very chocolately and the texture was a bit strange. I read the other reviews and wonder what I did wrong. Anyway, the next time I have a brownie attack I will get off my and go buy a box mix. Less of a mess and it seems to work better."
"0","5","These were very good. Just like the brownies from a box if not better! Will definetly make again."
"0","5","Very yummy! My changes were: I only baked the brownies for 20 minutes (which left them slightly fudgy), I added 2 Tbsp of milk to the frosting and cooked all of the frosting ingreadients in a sauce pan (melting the butter first then adding the rest of the ingredients) until the lumps in the powdered sugar were mostly gone. This made more of a glaze and was perfect to top my brownies. It has to sit up a bit or the frosting will run right off the brownines. NEXT TIME: I will definitely double the brownie mix, to make thicker brownies. Hubby is a chocoholic, so more is better, LOL!"
"0","3","Not as fudgy, chewy, or 'plump' as I like."
"0","4","I brought these to a 'Movie Night' and it was devoured! Next time, I will use the frosting, for I felt that it wasn't sweet enough. My oven is TERRIBLE, so the consistency was lacking due to this. But the taste, totally made up for it. For several minutes, a friend of mine told everyone 'Try the brownies, they're delicious!' Thank you Angie, will make again!"
"0","4","Great taste, but VERY dry. And as for the frosting....I think it needs a tad more butter cause mine was coming out WAY too thick. I had to put it in the microwave and heat it up just so it would spread."
"0","5","These were excellent!! Very chocolatey and moist. I also did not use the frosting, it was delicious without it. I added some coconut flakes to half the batter. Very yummy!"
"0","5","I made these for a family gathering and made the recipe exactly as it's written. Everyone really liked them and I'll be sure to be making them again."
"0","5","These were very easy and it was so rewarding to make brownies NOT from a boxed mix. I like knowing what we're eating! These were a tad less chewy than a box mix so I see where some reviewers may call them cakey. Try them though! Here's the best tip, eat them frozen!! Yum!! It was like eating a fudgy frozen brownie. Now I'm thinking of slicing the frozen brownie and making ice cream sandwiches with them......"
"0","2","These are okay but nothing special, definitely 'over rated.' Usually brownies are made by melting chocolate squares with butter in a double broiler, not with cocoa powder."
"0","2","I've made these twice. With and without baking powder. Both ways, the mixture just doesn't taste right. If you want slam dunk brownies - go try the Deep Dish Brownies off this website!!!"
"0","5","YUM!! Did not use the frosting. These were incredible! Made a batch and they were gone in minutes. Had to make a second batch and EVERYONE wanted the recipe. Thank you for the quickest, easiest and best brownies ever!"
"0","3","I made these on a whim just to see how they would turn out. I won't be making them again. I followed the advice of others in regards to preperation and they still turned out cakey, bland, and a little dry. I cooked them ten minutes less than recommended and the bottoms still burned. I'll keep looking for a brownie recipe, but thanks anyways."
"0","5","These were very dense and yummy. I didn't make the frosting, only because I didn't feel like it, and I am glad I didn't. I added chocolate chips to the batter and the brownies were rich and delicious without the frosting. Obviously, I will make these again."
"0","5","Yummmmm! This is the perfect fudgy brownie! Not cake like at all. I did add a touch of my own to the frosting,which was delicious already. I added a bit of peanut butter chips to give it additional flavor. DON'T dilute frosting with water like some other people said. The frosting is solid enough to not be all messy when its cooled. Definitely put it on when brownies are still pretty warm. Will spread a lot easier. Great recipe!"
"0","5","When I need a quick dessert, I always make these. So moist!!! I don't like frosting, so I never use it, but they don't need it!! Delicious!!"
"0","5","An awesome recipe, it does always turn out (if you do it right). Fun to experiment with because it's so easy."
"0","5","I doubled the recipe all except for the eggs (I used one less) and baked in a 9 X 13 pan. They turned out nice and fudgy. Delicious!!"
"0","2","Being as though I'm a Brownie Lover, I found this recipe short of my likeing. It was ok, but that was it. I followed the recipie to a T, and it tasted like a chocolate cake when I was done. Would not make again, If your someone who Likes Fudgy, Chewy Brownies, this recipe is NOT for you."
"0","5","These are too easy and too good to ever buy the mix again. I had a boxed mix in the cabinet but wanted to try my hand at homemade brownies. I will make these all the time. Thanks"
"0","4","This recipe is very yummy! The brownies are very chewy, very sweet! Though the frosting is pretty thick. I had to break it up and wait for it to warm on top of the hot brownies before it would spread. They were also very thin. But because they were so sweet, it worked well because you wouldn't want a big piece anyway! Nice recipe."
"0","5","These should come with a warning they are so good. I ate the whole batch in one day! I added a lot of walnuts and left out the icing, as I don't like it on brownies. Unreal how good they were! I can't understand how anyone wouldn't like this recipe! The only complaint should be the fact that you cannot stop eating them!"
"0","5","really good and moist. Everyone loved them. Used satiny chocolate glaze from this site instead of the honey frosting of this recipe.Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","These brownies are really the BEST!!! I made these last weekend with GREAT reviews. This weekend I made a box mix w/ frosting. It was really disappointing after having such a yummy batch last weekend."
"0","4","Very good brownies... I followed the advice of previous reviewers and didn't beat the mixture but simply stirred... this gave me a nicely dense chocolatey brownie. It was a bit crumbly at the beginning (after cooling at room temp for a few hours) so I refrigerated it and it was perfect after that. I also halved the sugar in the glaze and the resultant brownie was still plenty sweet. Also added chopped walnuts which gave it a nice crunch."
"0","5","These were scrumptious and easy to make! The only concern I had was the way in which the frosting came together. I didn't think it came out right, but I worked to spread it out on the brownies, and it was so good. I'll definitely make these from now on!"
"0","5","These brownies were awesome. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and only used 1/2 of the recommended powdered sugar for the icing and the brownies were fantastic! They were just as good the next morning as they were right out of the oven. Plus, I had all ingredients on hand. My 9 year old loved them!"
"0","5","I made these yesterday and was a bit nervous about the outcome as they were my first ever brownies. They turned out really good though! I frosted them with the brown sugar cream cheese frosting from this site and my flatmate and me, we finished them off in one evening. Will have to make some more brownies soon to keep up with demand."
"0","4","These were pretty good. I thought they were a little too sweet but my hubby said they were the best that he's ever had. I think with a different frosting, like a cream cheese one, it would be a little less sweet."
"0","5","OMG, These are good. Just perfect in texture and taste. I didn't make the frosting, I don't like frosting on brownies. They are not too sweet and the consistancy is not too chewy or cakey. I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13in pan of these. I took them to work and they disappeared."
"0","5","Lives up to its name...they are the Best Brownies ever, according to my 'in-house Brownie tasting fanatic'!! Very easy to make, and you will definitely need to double the recipe, because they disappear QUICKLY!!"
"0","5","Soooo good!!! And, so easy to make! Made them yesterday and they will be gone by this evening!"
"0","5","So yummy! Chewy, delicious, and everything I could ever want in a brownie, and this is without the frosting! I will definitely have to try it with the frosting, but I usually like my brownies plain. YUM!!"
"0","5","Made these for my husbands office and they were gone in a matter of minutes. By far the best brownies I've ever made. I'll never use a mix again!"
"0","3","For some reason I really didn't like this. I think it could of been the cocoa I was using. Not for sure. Also, I would cut the frosting amount in half. It made way too much."
"0","5","Forchocolate lovers, this is a hit! Very decadent! This was my first attempt at making homemade brownies and it came out wonderful! They were way too sweet for my taste buds however, they were loved by all. I will reattempt this recipe cutting out some of the sweetness. The frosting was extremely thick so I added about 3 tsp of milk (stirring after each) until I achieved the consistency of frosting."
"0","5","Yummy brownie recipe. These brownies were in between cakey and chewy. Was nice and chocolatey fudgy tasting. I followed the recipe to a T, but sprinkled chopped up PB cups over half the batter in the pan. It was really good, I may just add them into the batter next time. Thanks for the post!"
"0","5","SO YUMMY! I didn't make the icing b/c we had ice cream on top of our warm brownies. I added some chopped up dove dark chocolate to make them even chocolatier! These are great."
"0","3","This was my first homemade brownie. I wasn't a big fan of the taste (it was too sweet for me), but it was fudgy, and that's my kind of brownie. My friends LOVED the brownies. To each his own; I'll be finding another homemade brownie recipe."
"0","5","The name says it all. These are divinity! A must for Chocolate lovers"
"0","5","These are the best brownies. I always make a double batch. I've never actually used the icing recipe included so I can’t vouch for it. I have used mint chocolate icing and chocolate cream cheese icing - both of which work very well."
"0","5","As if this recipe needs another GREAT rating! Extremely quick and easy recipe. The frosting is the 'icing on the cake'! Definite keeper!"
"0","4","When I made these, they turned out more like Texas Sheet Cake, but I am not complaining because they are still delicous. They are very different from the box mix, but every bit as good. I always add chocolate chips, because there is no such thing as too much chocolate. It's a keeper!"
"0","5","the brownies turned out super good!!! i didn't need to make the icing because they were already chocolatey and sweet! i sprinkled coconut on the top and they tasted perfect."
"0","5","Oh, WOW! I thought my Mother's brownie recipe was the best I'd ever tried, but I have to say THIS one is instead! I've used her recipe (and several others once I lost hers) for over 20 years, and was truly despairing of ever finding another recipe that was easy and yet stunningly delicious. You really can't go wrong with this recipe; I'm at a high altitude and some recipes (even after adjusting) just don't taste right after baking ... but this one was PERFECT! Tried and immediately devoured by a crew of workers who then elbowed each other out of the way as they sprinted to the computer to copy down the recipe. Wish I could give it ten stars!!!"
"0","5","These were amazing! I doubled the recipe and stirred in some chopped walnuts. Also left off the frosting. They rose beautifully, not sure why so many reviewers are having problems with that. Really tasty though. Perfect for those chocolate cravings!"
"0","5","I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe and yummy! Super rich! The best frosted brownies for sure."
"0","3","These brownies were kinda dry and had a bad texture. The taste wasokay and I liked the frosting. They were easy to make."
"0","4","I loved these brownies. They are very easy to make and taste much better than the packaged brownies. I had one batch that just sank, however the rest have all been great!"
"0","5","Made these twice already. One time I did not bake them long enough & they still ate them."
"0","4","Just tasting these fresh out of the oven, and they're pretty good. Not as fudgy as my favorite recipe, but great with only half the sugar. I doubled the recipe and put the batter in two round pans. I didn't have vanilla so left it out, which might have helped the taste a lot. Hits the spot for my chocolate craving right now though! :)"
"0","2","For me too sweet!Not make this again."
"0","4","I'd give these a 4.5 star rating. My husband made these exactly as stated in the recipe. They did fall a bit after baking...Maybe a different frosting would be the key to a five star rating."
"0","4","good texture but the taste was missing something."
"0","5","I've made these brownies several times because they're easy to whip up with ingredients I have on hand. I've never made the frosting, but I have thrown all kinds of treats into the batter - marshmallows, chopped chocolate truffles, butterscotch chips. Always yummy and moist! If you want a topping, just sift some powdered sugar on them (I place some in a fine-gauge strainer and shake)."
"0","5","WOW!!! I made these using gluten free flours instead of all-purpose flour and they turned out REALLY well. Like all things gluten free I had a hard time getting them to cook in the center, but it was so worth the extra cooking time. My only complaint was the frosting, which was unmodified from the original recipe. I had to roll it out in my hands and put it on piece by piece. It was kind of a pain. Still, it had a great flavor. All in all, these were great brownies. The only thing missing was the chewy edges. I will definitely make this recipe again."
"0","5","these brownies really are the best.I added white chocolate chunks and semisweet chips they were sinful"
"0","5","'worlds best brownies' great with or without frosting."
"0","5","WOW!!! I have been looking for a the perfect chewy, fudgey brownies for a while now and they always come out cakey or crumbly. This one was awesome. I think better than the box. I didn't use the frosting, thought it would be too much and I was right. We felt they were pretty rich without it. Thanks for ending my search!!"
"0","4","yummy! I made them in mini muffin tins and substituted margerine for butter- and they came out marvelous!!"
"0","5","Pretty amazing. Loved the frosting. Mine baked really fast though. Disaster was averted but watch out for that."
"0","4","i made 2 batches of these brownies for a college fundraiser. no changes needed aside from adding a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips to one batch & a handful of chopped walnuts to the other. we really enjoyed the fudgy taste & chewy texture. many thanks angie!"
"0","5","These really are the best brownies ever -- I made them for a superbowl party and they were gone in about 10 seconds!"
"0","5","They came out amazing- I used half the recommended sugar in the icing and I baked them until they were just set. Moist and delicious."
"0","5","I must say this one is very good. I've finally found the recipe I'd been looking for in a fudgy brownie. I just put a whole load of nuts 'coz I just love nuts. My 7 year old daughter loves this stuff. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","Better than the box!"
"0","4","took these to a superbowl party. they were a big hit. but personally, a little too sweet for my taste, i'd cut back on the sugar a little."
"0","5","Didn't make the frosting and the brownies were still delicious. Also added about a 1/2 cup of walnuts. yum!"
"0","5","These brownies turned out perfect! I made it for the volunteers at a charity event and they all absolutely loved it! They came back for seconds and it all disappeared in no time. I even had a few people asking me for the recipe. :) Although the frostng makes it quite more chocolately and sweet, I'd say it would be fine even without it.  All I have left to say is...it's a chocolate lover's delight! So if you love chocolate than this is the recipe for you!! By the way, this was my first time making brownies..."
"0","5","I took these to work. Everyone asked me to bring more the next day. Great!"
"0","5","Thanks for this recipe. The brownies are perfect. I double this recipe and make it in a standard cookie sheet pan. Comes out wonderful every time."
"0","4","Nothing too great- they weren't as chewy as I like. I did like the icing, however."
"0","5","These browinies are the bomb! Chewy and cakey all together! I didn't make the icing recipe that is listed on here though. I did however, double the recipe, because it was way to small for my family, and I increased cocoa, since I doubled the recipe I used 1 C. of cocoa, awsome. To those of you who are so negative because yours did not turn out, all I can say is, not everyone has the same luck at baking as others. Does not mean it is an awful recipe. 10 people can make the same recipe at the same time, and all 10 recipes will turn out differently. With 1000 some reviews, there's alot of people having good luck with them, this just isn't the recipe for you obviously!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. The brownies and the frosting just go so good together. The only thing I did extra was add about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the brownie batter before baking. These are chewy and chocolatey. They didn't last long enough. I'll make again soon."
"0","4","I doubled the recipe, but kept the frosting the same.Very quick and easy recipe. Brownies were nice and moist. will keep this one!"
"0","5","These are yum indeed. I doubled the recipe..added a full cup of cocoa, 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the butter, 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and half a cup of brown sugar..added chocolate shavings on top after it came out of the oven .. finished wonderful!!"
"0","5","These are delicious! For some reason that I can't comprehend I suck at making brownies. I have tried all other top recipes on this site and failed miserably. This is the ONLY recipe I've ever tried that turns out properly. Thanks!"
"0","5","Hi there! I just wanted to tell you that this brownie recipe is absolutely GREAT!!! I'm from Germany and ate my first brownie ever during an exchange in the USA. I found your recipe here and I bake your brownies very often. Everybode here loves them! I use a special chocolate together with the cocoa powder and they taste amazing! Your brownies have got a lot of fans over here :-)"
"0","5","Very nice and moist! I like to bake them in muffin cups and use 3/4 cup of sweetened cocoa powder and reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup."
"0","3","i used the exact measurements that were suggested and there was very little resulting batter. i only ended up with 6 servings. also, the brownie turned out dry and dense. not what i was expecting. probably will not make again."
"0","4","very mosit and chocolatey. not too sweet the honey makes the difference."
"0","5","made this recipe many many times, with and without frosting. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM. Ir IS the best"
"0","5","Super rich, dense and sweet. I added extra melted semi-sweet chocolate to the mix for a richer chocolate taste and texture. Other then that I didn't change a thing. The brownies were sweet and rich enough as is so I did not make any icing."
"0","5","Wow. I've never had a brownie this good. I messed up the icing a little but added some more ingredients to even it out, melted it a little in the microwave and oured it on top, sprinkled with confection sugar to make sure it would harder and they were beautiful. I'm everyone's best friend at work. This recipe is perfect as it. Keep track of brownies with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, they're done."
"0","4","These were very fudgy and moist. I used half brown sugar and less baking powder as advised by other reviewers. I also added peanut butter chips and chocolate chips and cooked them for about 22 minutes."
"0","5","Very good! The frosting is excellent too... thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","I loved the tase of these brownies, and they did well in the oven. But they didn't stick together very well; it was hard to serve because it fell apart. I used a different icing recipe. Aside from the crumbliness, it's a keeper."
"0","3","It tasted awesome! However, we followed the directions to the tee, and it was really crumbly, and fell apart. We used a different icing than what the recipe called for because we weren't too sure about the honey. It turned out great."
"0","3","The brownie was alright, but i thought the frosting was too sweet. The amount of honey and confectioners sugar could be reduced. Next time i use this recipe, i'd probably do without the frosting and add some chocolate chips to the brownies."
"0","5","there is a reason why these are called Best Brownies!! Easy to make and moist and chewy just the way my husband likes them. I added some mint choc chips into the batter and next time might try some toasted almonds. great recipe thanks"
"0","5","This was very good.The whole family really enjoyed them, even fussy husband.I made it exactly as written and it was awesome."
"0","3","My husband and 8 year old daughter liked them. I however thought they were not sweet enough. I think it had to much coco. Also the frosting was a huge glob so I didn't add it."
"0","5","I was surprised at how easy this was...and it was indeed the best ever!"
"0","5","Wonderful! Melts in you mouth. Quick and Easy to make! Thank You!"
"0","5","these brownies were a big hit when i brought them to school. 5 stars all the way. !"
"0","5","These brownies are so delicious, it is really the perfect brownie because i for one cannot stand the cake like kind and need a really strong chocolate taste so these were terrific. The only problem is that its really hard to figure out when to take them out of the oven (I was slightly spooked) by the don't overcook warning so took them out after 25 minutes and even though they passed the fork test have had to put them back in two more times... i know my oven is weird but just as a warning...still definitely going to replace my old brownie recipe."
"0","5","First of all I cannot believe that this recipe has only a total of four and a half stars overall because it DESERVES five all across the board!!!!! It should also be renamed Awesome Brownies instead of Best Brownies!! Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! Thanks!"
"0","5","Excellent brownies and so easy to make! My husband ate more than half the batch already, so it looks like I'll be making these again soon. Thanks!"
"0","5","They are wonderful!"
"0","5","Delicious and fudgy!!!! The name says it all...BEST BROWNIES!!!"
"0","4","Yummy, yummy brownies, but the frosting lacked a richness that I was hoping for! Still tasty by all accounts though."
"0","5","I love these! My fiance and I have to give some of these away whenever I make them because we can't stop eating them!"
"0","5","What a great recipe!  We needed to bake 300 servings for my childrens school for hot lunch.  We quadrupled the recipe and made a pan of 32 servings. And with the help of our *Kitchen Aide's we made 10 pans. What a yummy success! Thanks for sharing your recipe. Yvonne"
"0","4","yummy yumm !!!!!!delicious!!!"
"0","5","Wow!!! These really are the best brownies!! They came out really fudgy & chewy just like we like them. We ran out of butter so we couldn't make the frosting, instead we sprinkled powdered suger on top. We made these a 2nd time w/ the frosting & o-o-h-h, they were so rich & chocolatey (a sure fix for any chocolate lover). The frosting was a little dry so I did added some milk. Other than that, they were PERFECT. I'll never again buy brownie mix. Thanks for sharing, Angie. I wish I could give this 10 stars!!!"
"0","5","Excellent, delicious, yummy brownies. Will definetly be making these again and again."
"0","5","These were the first brownies I've ever made and they did not dissapoint!! Everyone loved them so much I'm being asked to make more!! I did have to cook them for 45 minutes though cause they were still wet on the bottom!! Mmmmm"
"0","5","Mmm.. chocolatey, rich fudgy goodness =) The brownies themselves aren't terribly sweet, but with the frosting (I only used 1/2 the sugar, I can't imagine it tasting good with that much sugar!). Fudge-y consistency, not really like a brownie. I usually bake it in a round pan and cut it like a pie. Delish.. thanks!"
"0","5","They are the best. Next time however, I will try it without the honey in the icing."
"0","5","These are delicious brownies!!! The only thing I do different is I wait until the brownies are cool to ice them. I add 1-2 tablespoons of milk to the icing ingrediants. It makes a rich chocolate icing."
"0","5","These brownies are amazing! Next time I will try milk as I found the icing to be a bit too crumbly but still yummy!"
"0","4","yes, these are neither gooey or cakey! good but i like solid/gooey better! my batch came out with small holes all over the top, wonder why."
"0","5","MMMMMMM...these brownies turned out perfect! chewy and chocolatey goodness! i'll never buy boxed mix again!"
"0","4","Very nice flavour, but came out a little drier than I like. I may have over cooked them a little. I like my brownies very gooey!"
"0","5","I cant' think of a better name for these brownies. The only change I made was to the icing. I used milk instead of honey as others suggested. Awesome!"
"0","5","Really moist brownies, I'm curious if anyone has had success in doubling the recipe? Because my roommates finished these within the night. The frosting did seem kind of crumbly at first (I panicked), but I found that it softens if you put it on the brownies while they're still hot out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","wow. there went my diet. these are SOOOO good. I made them for my husband last night for when he got home from work, well he ended up not getting home until 330am, and so there I was stuck alone with brownies.... dangerous! will make again, absolutely great VERY chocolate-y mmmm"
"0","4","Frosting came out really thick as others have mentioned - next time I will add milk. Brownies also came out a bit crumbly -not very attractive. But the taste - orgasmic! They have a fantastic flavor. I will probably make again!"
"0","4","Pretty darn good!! This is our new family recipe, and it's soooo easy!! My hunny snarfed 2/3 of the pan up in one night!! And I made a double batch!! I accidently added the sugar to the melted butter over the stove, but it still worked out great!! Before putting in the oven, i sprinkled chopped pecans over the top..wonderful!"
"0","4","I made these without the icing (didn't need it), and they were super yummy! They were perfectly between fudgy and cake-like. This batter is VERY thick, so I'd suggest a pastry rubber scraper. I made them for the 2nd time today, and they are just perfect with some chopped pecans ;)"
"0","5","Really good!"
"0","3","These taste pretty good, very sweet. But they look awful. We probably won't make again, as they are just over the top sweet for our taste."
"0","4","They tasted great, but I don't think there was anything different about them, besides the frosting. I will make them again though."
"0","5","These are great, I make them a bit different tho, no need for the frosting. I use whole wheat pastry flour, a lunchbox type cup of organic applesauce in place of butter, and the sugar I use half sucanat, half honey. 25 minutes and they are amazing! Sometimes I throw in a handful of vegan chocolate chips, its a dairy free delight!"
"0","5","i had just started baking, and this is the first recipe that i've tried for brownies. it's really good, but the frosting is too sweet for me. maybe i'll use less sugar next time."
"0","5","The best brownies I have ever made! Would not change a thing excellent as is!"
"0","5","good consistency but a lil too sweet for my taste."
"0","5","My first brownies from scratch (I admit it) and they were very good. The frosting is awesome, the consistency is good (a little on the cake-y side). I added chopped walnuts because to me all brownies are better with nuts."
"0","5","These brownies are terrific.They are moist,and they taste wonderful.I was a little sared when I made the icing because it got thick but it turned out great.To bad it doent make very much because they will not last at my house.Thanks so much for a awesome recipe."
"0","5","Extremely yummy!!! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. The frosting was perfect too, although I didn't have any honey, so used golden syrup instead. I also topped them with coconut, and they were just heavenly! Thanks for the great recipe :-)"
"0","5","Oh these were soooo good!! Just perfect in every way. I took them to a pot-luck BBQ and they were eatin right up. We're usually all about the store bought browney mix - but these are better!"
"0","5","These were very good and easy. I've never made brownies from scratch before, so I didn't really know how to tell if they were done. I pulled them at 25 minutes and I think they were a little undercooked. Also, the frosting was very dry. Next time I'll add a little milk to it, it kind of destroyed the top of the brownies as I was trying to spread it on. Very yummy though, and easy. Thanks!"
"0","5","I don't think I'll ever go back to prepackaged brownie mix again after having these. They are good with or without the frosting. We've had them both ways. We can't get enough of these!"
"0","5","chewy, chocolatey, and wonderful"
"0","4","We made these brownies for a quick dessert for company. Everybody loved them. I wasn't crazy about them, but my mom said they were a keeper... so they must be pretty good!"
"0","5","These brownies are so easy and delicious. They are really fudgy and moist though, so if you like cakier brownies, you might want to skip this recipe. I didn't use the frosting and after tasting these brownies, would not use it in the future. They ar every rich and I think the frosting would have been overkill."
"0","5","These are really great and taste better than box-mix brownies. I love the chewy texture, b/c they are very moist. I don't like the frosting though, too sweet, but my daughter likes it."
"0","5","I've made it several times....awesome warmed with vanilla icecream...yum."
"0","4","Soooo good but too sweet! And very fattening!"
"0","4","I loved the frosting so much that I'm going to use it for other things. The brownies weren't that great, and the frosting actually made them better."
"0","5","Oh My.. these are sinfully delicious! I ate almost half the pan by myself! AHHHH.. I would make them everyday if i could! thanks for this gem of a recipe!"
"0","5","Thanks. Great recipe. Well done."
"0","5","believe the hype - these are amazing."
"0","5","Delicious. I didn't even need frosting. Pay attention to the baking time."
"0","5","YUMMY! And super easy...Also the frosting is the best chocolate frosting ever."
"0","3","I followed other reviews and subsitute apple sauce for the butter and it just didn't make any big difference, I also put in some chocolate chips in it. My hubby said that the frosting really makes it good although this brownies is still not the best."
"0","5","GREAT brownies!!! I went exactly by the recipe and it turned out perfect. Very moist and D-Lish!"
"0","5","Great recipe and very easy!"
"0","4","These were good. I'm not sure what happend to mine, but they were a little to runny. I will try to make these again and see if they come out better."
"0","2","sorry to say this recipe is nothing to rave about."
"0","5","Yum. Just don't make the frosting as advised, use your own recipe for that - this didn't spread at all."
"0","4","I usually prefer fudgy brownies to the more cakey type, but these are some of the best cake brownies I've had. Be sure to check them earlier rather than later, you don't want to dry them out too much."
"0","5","I put my pot on high heat for a bit too long, so when I put the butter in, it turned into a brownish liquid. I was afraid I screwed up the entire recipe. Then I added the other ingredients. When I poured the mixture into the pan, I realized that my pan was too large (9x13). I baked it for about 15 minutes. It came out great. I blended granulated sugar in the blender to make confectioners' sugar. At first when I was stirring the frosting, it seemed too powdery to be frosting, but I kept on mixing, and it got a spreadable texture. The frosting did not get a smooth, creamy texture b/c of the sugar, but it was still good and rich. The brownie by itself wasn't much, but with the frosting, it's a good treat to indulge in."
"0","5","These are great brownies! I didn't try the icing this time but I sprinkled chocolate chips on top for an extra chocolate treat! My kids loved them and they were so easy to make! We will be making these again!!!"
"0","3","I thought these were okay at best, but my husband liked them a lot. I guess that means I'll keep the recipe around until I find something better. The frosting is a waste of time. I had to add a little milk to make it work."
"0","3","These brownies were more cake-like than fudgy, but they were pretty good. I didn't make the frosting, so that might have something to do with it. Very easy, however!"
"0","4","These turned out good, even though I added more cocoa powder than the recipe asked for, and they disappeared really fast! :)"
"0","5","These were awesome. Mine looked better than the picture. I saved extra frosting so I could eat it straight out of the bowl. YUMMY!"
"0","5","made it for a BBQ and they all disappeared fast."
"0","3","these are just 'okay' brownies, nothing spectacular. mine took a lot longer to cook, and i thought the buttery taste was way too noticeable. plus -- this recipe is the same as several others on this site, minus the frosting (which i didn't use; i guess i just think frosting id for cakes)."
"0","5","these brownies were soooo good!my friends and i ate a batch in about 30 min.!!if you don't like this recipie, you have no taste what so ever!!!!!"
"0","5","I left out the baking powder because I like chewey, non cake-like brownies. Unfortunately, only about half the batter made it to the oven because I ate the other half (so good!). I didn't cook it long enough (by far), but the edges were cooked like I imagine the brownies were supposed to turn out. This is the first scratch brownie recipe that has turned out for me. I recommend trying them, they are very classic. I will make them again, and this time I'll try to cook them properly (and maybe I'll try the baking soda)."
"0","5","Should be prepared a day before you served it, it just gets better and better."
"0","3","The brownie recipe was quick and easy. I would definately make it again. The frosting on the otherhand, I wouldn't. There wasn't enough to cover my brownies and I had to add extra honey and butter because it was far too dry and wouldn't mix."
"0","3","They aren't bad, but they were definately hard to swallow. Perhaps it's because of the changes I made? I added some chocolate chips and didn't make the frosting. In anycase they weren't the best, and not what I was looking for in a brownie."
"0","5","i was a little hesitant to try this recipe because a lot of people said it was like cake squares..which i definitely did not want. but oh my god these were SO good!!. i made sure to not overcook them because that might contribute a bit to the cake texture, mine cooked in 22 minutes. i didn't make the icing either. my partner and i ate over half the batch."
"0","5","This is identical to a recipe a friend gave me a few years ago, which was the 'best brownies' I ever ate. The title tells it all."
"0","5","i find the frosting a bit sweet so i just do away with it altogether and throw in a cup of chopped pecans. :D very yummy."
"0","5","Goodbye Duncan Hines! These were awesome. I have made these with and without the frosting and they're delicious. They never last more than a day at my house. :)"
"0","5","Incredible! Once you start eating them, it's hard stopping. Also a very simple recipe, didn't take very long to make. One of the best recipes I've ever tried."
"0","5","Great recipe! Easy to make! Very goowy, chocolaty brownies, my husband loves them."
"0","3","I give this 3 stars because my 5 year old had a lot of fun helping me make them (so easy) but I didn't think they were very good. Not enough of a chocolate taste for me and kind of spongey as another reviewer stated."
"0","5","Completely perfect as is! I needed 400 brownies, so I multiplied the recipe and baked them in a few 16x24 sheet pans. Just perfect, no recipe adjustments needed. Also - they freeze really well if you need to make them ahead and thaw on the day you'll eat them!"
"0","5","great and easy to make! everyone love it!"
"0","4","These are good. A little bit rich."
"0","5","I can't beleive how good these were! Better than boxed and better than brownies using bakers chocolate! If you like a THICK brownie, just double the recipie and bake it in a 9x9 dish (Stones from pampered chef work great) You don't even need the icing to make it sweet or moist."
"0","5","Yummy! This is a wonderful recipe, and I am glad that it uses cocoa powder (which I always have on hand) instead of the unsweetened chocolate squares. We used the frosting recipe on the back of the cocoa container and put lots of chopped walnuts on top! Try it! You will never go back to a box mix!"
"0","5","Delicious. I was surprised they came out so good..being my first brownies to make."
"0","5","This are the most amazing brownies ever. I follow the recipe exactly and they are always perfect. Sometimes instead of using the frosting w/the recipe I will use the whipped cream cheese frosting recipe that can be found on this site. I will also add walnuts or macadamia nuts every once and awhile. I will never go back to the box again!"
"0","5","I had a pregnancy craving this morning for brownies and these were better than I was expecting them to turn out. So good! They turned out perfect!"
"0","3","Very rich - I thought it was a cross between a brownie and fudge - it was about 1 inch thick. I like my brownie's more like a dense cake at least 1 1/2 inches thick, so these were not my favorite."
"0","5","These brownies were great! My husband had been begging for brownies and these just hit the spot. I had to bake them in a muffin tin since I didn't have an 8x8 pan, and they still came out great!"
"0","5","I must review this review again because it's brilliant! It's even better the second time round, everyone enjoyed it! Thanks so much again!"
"0","5","So easy! Nice chewy texture (if you omit the baking soda). Great without frosting, too. This is a keeper."
"0","5","delishhhh...dont even need the toping!!"
"0","4","I like brownies out of a box better. I added walnuts to one batch, it helped. Believe this or not but I forgot the butter in one batch and I actually preferred it that way! They are much better after they sit for a while."
"0","5","it came out soo good it was the first time i make browines soo good and soo easy"
"0","3","I hate to be the exception, but I didn't care for the texture of these at all. The flavor was fine, but they have an odd, spongy texture."
"0","5","Wow! I did a few modifications, left out the baking powder and added 1/2 cup walnuts and chocolate chips. And did not put frosting on (husband started eating them before I had a chance). I am a big chocolate fan and these hit the spot."
"0","5","This is a very dense 'sink-your-teeth-in' brownie capable of satisfying my strongest chocolate cravings!"
"0","5","WOW! These are great. I made them with the frosting. I will make these again and again. Thanks!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! The yield was small, though, so I doubled all of the ingredients. I wanted a chewier, fudge-like brownie, so I used three eggs for a double batch, added an extra 1 cup of cocoa powder and 1.5 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I then added 2 tsp of peppermint extract for a chocolate-mint experience that everyone loved. YUMMY. Thanks so much!!!!"
"0","5","These are the best!!!!!!! No frosting necessary. Perrrrrfect."
"0","4","As an Aussie I anticipated that this would be the all American over the top sweet that I love so much! I only used 3/4cups sugar and 1/2 the frosting and guess what they were still sweet and fabulous! Definitely one for afternoon tea with friends!"
"0","5","Outstanding recipe!"
"0","5","These brownies are easy to make and taste delicious! They are yummy even without the frosting!"
"0","5","These were wonderful!! Delicious 'old school' brownies!!"
"0","5","Very chewy, great tasting brownies..one of the best batches I've made."
"0","4","These were terrific! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect and delicious."
"0","5","I've made these browines dozens of times and they're never enough. I think they're perfect without the frosting."
"0","3","These were just ok, certainly not the best brownies ever. I have made them twice--the first time with the icing, which I did nt like. So I made them again, this time without the icing, and the brownies were just alright. I was very dissapointed."
"0","5","These are the best brownies!"
"0","3","I didn't overmix, didn't overbake, tried to follow the recipe to the best of my concentration abilities. Quite nice, mine were more cake like, not chewy, moist but not enough and somehow lacked taste. Quien sabe.."
"0","4","I made these twice and they still didn't seem to turn out exactly. I had a hard time getting the icing on, I'm wondering if I did something wrong. Anyway, the icing along with the brownie makes the whole thing way too sweet. I would recommend leaving off the icing, the brownie is enough on its own."
"0","4","Very good but didn't taste quite like a brownie or a cake. The frosting was very thick and hard to spread and I think it made it too sweet. Would probably make this again without the icing because it is so easy to make."
"0","5","these were wonderful!! Best served warm because the frosting is melty. Will make these again, but probably without the honey. Also 1/2 the frosting is plenty."
"0","5","Awesome!! I had a request for cheesecake swirled brownies, but I didn't want to stray from my favorite recipe. With no cream cheese, I made a concoction of pureed 1/4c cottage cheese, 1 egg, 1/2 tsp vanilla, about 1 tbs. flour, and 1/2 of a package of cheesecake pudding. Awesome!!"
"0","4","Now these were good....I have made others and was glad to finally try a recipe that was good. I didn't care for the frosting-glaze. It was overkill for me. Next time I am planning to make my famous Peanut Butter Frosting and am going to use that instead. I am looking forward to using this recipe again!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","3","They are good - but not extraordinary."
"0","5","made these one night... had to make another batch the next morning... great receipe... really easy to make... i only made half the stated icing though but it seems to be more than enough..."
"0","5","fantastic brownies. soft and great. i have a gluten free family so i substituted the flour with an all-purpose one i made with brown rice flour, white rice flour, tapioca flour, potato flour, corn flour and xamtham gum. you could not taste the difference."
"0","5","Not the best brownies I've ever had, but pretty good."
"0","5","double the recipe- for a thicker, denser brownie. but overall good recipe"
"0","4","These were the best brownies we've ever had. So much better than any boxed mix. They did come out rather cake-like, but were delicious nonetheless. I'll try not to mix the batter so much next time."
"0","5","These really are the BEST brownies. I also added about 1/2 cup each of walnuts and semi-sweet chocolate chunks for texture. And after reading the other reviews, I skipped the frosting. The recipe yielded 16 small squares and were neither too fudgey or cakey. I have never made brownies from scratch, now I have. Great Recipe!"
"0","4","brownies were pretty good, but didn't care for the frosting much!"
"0","5","Always a hit! I usually add chocolate chip chunks. I had trouble with the frosting, so I don't bother with it. Very rich. Too rich for some people, but not me or my fiancee!!"
"0","3","Okay , these brownies taste AWESOME. But.. err they take a pretty long time to bake.. longer than it says. Why is it so liquid-y??"
"0","5","Very yummy brownies, easy to make, will use this recipe again. I did not use any frosting on these, I did however heat them a little and then plopped a scoop of ice cream topped with some chocolate sauce!! YUM!! everyone loved them"
"0","5","The name says it all. Next time I make them I'm going to try some add-ins. Like walnuts, or mini chocolate chips, or maybe caramel swirls. Thanks a lot for this delicious recipe!"
"0","5","Best brownies without a doubt!!! Didnt care for the frosting. Use a diifferent one."
"0","5","These brownies are my favorite! I've been making them for years from this exact recipe, and I've just now signed up on AllRecipes.com, so I thought I would tell everyone how wonderful these are! I've even used the frosting recipe to make frosting for cakes when I'm out of the kind from the store. Enjoy!"
"0","5","Super easy & very moist. I omitted the frosting just because the brownies didn't really need it. Great recipe! Thanks."
"0","5","I definetely recomend this recipe. These are the best brownies I have ever tasted. I do recomend using molasses in the frosting, though"
"0","4","These were good, but not the best I've tasted. I wasn't crazy about the frosting, but I have to say, I had no leftovers!"
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for 15 years. I got it from an Angie while living in Las Vegas, NV. It is the only brownie recipe I use."
"0","2","I don't know if I did something wrong, but these were just okay. I followed the recipe exactly and my brownies came out alright, nothing spectacular. And my frosting was way too dry. I will probably try this recipe again with some modifications. These were, however, fun to make from scratch."
"0","5","XXXXXX-cellent recipe! I love it, this is my third time making them and they smell and taste decilicious!"
"0","5","Icing is very rich. I doubled it thinking that I wanted it thicker (batch produces a thin layer of icing) but it was too rich. If I want more icing, next time I will simply add powdered sugar and butter to thicken."
"0","5","These brownies were SO good! I doubled this recipe and it worked out fine. I was a little nervous, as the batter seemed so thick, but they turned out great. I used corn syrup as a substitute for honey and thought they still tasted fantastic! Yum!"
"0","5","These were quick and easy to make. They tasted great, were moist and chewy. AND since I didn't have any milk around these worked out great!"
"0","5","Oh yeah, THESE are brownies!!! I do have to agree with the rest of the folks about the issues with the frosting. They're good without frosting, too, but if you have to have it use a different frosting recipe."
"0","5","Well, Duncan Hines can kiss my money goodbye. These were the best brownies I've ever had. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","wanted to see what all the hype was about... and i am so glad i did! these brownies are beyond yum :) the only change i made was i only used one egg, lightly beaten, to make sure it was less cake-like and more brownilicious. also, make sure that you don't overbeat the batter. other than that, this recipe was definitely worth the try! next time i make this i'll try the frosting although the reviews on the frosting here are suspect:/ and so it goes, these 'best brownies' may be best without the frosting..."
"0","5","I love these brownies! They were all gone in an hour! they were so rich and chocolately. I added chocolate chips to the them because I have a big sweet tooth for chocolate. I will definatly make these again!"
"0","5","These ARE the best! Instead of making the frosting listed, I used canned Fudge frosting and they were awesome. These remind me of the brownies my grandma used to make; I searched for a recipe just like it. 25 minutes was perfect for me. Will make again and again. Thank you so much!"
"0","5","These brownies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out moist and fudgey. I would recommend you double the recipe if you want them to last more than one day. This one is a keeper!"
"0","4","It was delicious and simple to make. Its frosting wasn't the same as the picture but still very tasty. Even though that we did not use honey but instead we used KARO syrup it was really delicious."
"0","5","Mmmm!! SO good and SO simple!!"
"0","5","sooooo good! I don't like cakey brownies, and these are gooey, moist, fudgey brownies. they are easy to make, and hard to mess up."
"0","5","Fantastic! Always a favorite! I find that if I double the recipe, the frosting turns out better if you mix together half the frosting ingrediants at a time. Otherwise the frosting gets fudgier and thick than I like it when doubled."
"0","4","I loved them, didn't get many compliments"
"0","5","These brownies were amazing! And so moist! I added some chopped walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone loved them!"
"0","5","These taste great"
"0","2","I didn't really care for these. They were very cakey and I wouldn't make them again."
"0","5","I've been making this recipe for over a year, and I am really happy with it.   The only change that I made was that I use margarine for the icing. It tends to be too thick for me. I usually make the icing, and then over low heat, add 1 tbsp of margarine at a time until I like the consistency. This works really well.   Also, I add a dash or three of cayenne pepper and cinnamon to make it my own."
"0","5","This is a WONDERFUL recipe!! I've never been able to make a good brownie in my entire life, and not only was this an easy and quick recipe, but it was chewy and tasty too! I used a 24-mini-muffin pan and didn't use the frosting (thought it might be too sweet?), and put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Yummm!!"
"0","3","Not bad, but nothing special. These were cakey and kind of dry."
"0","4","This recipe is very easy and fast to make. I double it and put in a silicone cake pan, and it plops right out. I have never made the frosting though. I am sure it is great too."
"0","5","these are the best brownies I have ever made .... I can't screw them up . they always cook and they taste soo good . thanks so much for such a good recipe ."
"0","5","Stayed moist and delicous until the last drop was gone several days later. Next time I may use a little less frosting."
"0","3","These didn't turn out so well for me. My boyfriend, the brownie lover, was unimpressed. Maybe I did something wrong?"
"0","4","The brownies tasted good, but it was soooo difficult to get it out of my glass pan. I greased and floured it and it was still sticking like crazy. I had a difficult time getting pieces out that were presentable for sharing with others. They did taste great. I used sweetened cocoa powder and they tasted great!"
"0","5","Perfect chewy brownies."
"0","4","They were good, but I had to add a bit of milk to the frosting because it was very dry."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! They are so good we don't even frost them. I doubled the recipe once though and I had to cook it twice as long."
"0","5","This is the BEST brownie recipe I have ever tried. They always turn out great!"
"0","4","these brownies were fairly simple to make. I could tell while mixing the batter that they were going to be good because the batter was thick and rich. In stead of an 8' pan I used a silicone 9' pan, the brownies were a little bit thinner but the silicone pan didnt burn at all, like metal would. the brownies popped right out of the tray onto a platter and they were easy to frost with the great frosting recipe. I might consider using the frosting recipe for cupcakes as well because it was smooth and chocolatey. a very good recipe. these brownies really do always turn out."
"0","5","I've never made a decent brownie in my life, but these have proven to be the exception! The edges were especially nice as they were more chewy. I've found that they taste better if you let them sit for a day (that might be just me). Add nuts to make them extra-good!"
"0","4","they are simple enough and turn out good; the original recipe could be doubled because 16 are a little amount indeed"
"0","5","Absolutely FANTASTIC!! Incredibly easy with ingredients I had around the house. Deliciously fudgey and moist. The frosting makes the brownies even better. Yum!! Highly recommended!!"
"0","5","Absolutely sinful. These were easy to make and delicous. I have made them twice this week already. I made them with the frosting."
"0","5","Delicious. Made them 1 hour ago and half the pan is gone already. I cut them warm and they are yummy. The only problem was that the icing was too dry. I used the beaters and it was still dry. I wish I would've taken the advice from other reviewers and added some milk to it. It still tasted good though."
"0","3","I thought these were just allright...too much of a dry cocoa taste...i think i could have cut make on the cocoa maybe"
"0","5","These are the best brownies EVER! I have been making these for a few years now and everyone who tries them LOVES them. You can't go wrong . Don't change a thing."
"0","5","These are INCREDIBLE! I have made these three times now, they don't last long. I used 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar. I also added about 1 1/2 TBS milk to the frosting. My husband, who eats brownies constantly (even for breakfast!), has declared these one of his favorites."
"0","5","These are the best brownies,just like the name implies. Thanks Angie."
"0","5","I don't know what I did wrong, I doubled the recipe and put it in a 10x15 but then changed my mind and lifted foil and put it into a 9x13...so maybe thats y the texture came out all weird...I added bittersweet chocolate chips and cooked it for quite a bit longer...well mine came out extremely fudgey and not at all like brownies...which made me sad at first but when you have EVERYONE at a bonfire raving about them and in disbelief that you home made them...well it's hard to stay down. =) So halfway through I stopped refering to them as brownies and called them fudge...because that was basically what it was...but I have to give 5 stars anyway because they were DELICIOUS. ^^ Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","These brownies are moist and yummy!"
"0","4","These were really good, when they were just out of the oven and still warm, but the leftovers even heated werent all that great. I would make this if I get the chance to make it for more people then just me and my husband."
"0","3","fantastic recipie. Great!!!!! only one problem they just don't last for two days"
"0","5","These Brownies Are The Easiest Brownies To Make . . . . You Con't Mess Up The Recipe, Even If You've Never Baked Before You Can EASILY Make These. Althoe The Recipe Calls For 1/3 Cup Unsweetened, They Can Be A Little Bit Too Ritch, Use Just A Little Less, And They'll Be Just Right"
"0","5","I've been doing these brownies for the past year. I no longer use any other brownie recipe and I won't even buy store bought mixes. The changes I make is I divide the sugar in half (half refined/half sugar in the raw) and I add about 1/2 cup macadamia nuts (if/when available). Also I don't like brownies with frosting, so I skip that last step. Still..these do NOT last more than a couple of days and everybody loves them."
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and added a cup of white chocolate chips and a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. WONDERFUL! Best brownies I've ever had... and everyone else loved them."
"0","5","Have made this recipe twice in the last few days. My family truly loves it! I added 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 cup chopped pecans, and 1 1/2 cup mini marshmellows, to give it a rockyroad affect. It was delicious!!!!!"
"0","5","I didn't make the frosting, but instead made the 'Caramel Frosting VI' from this site, using walnuts instead of pecans..... I normally like fudgier brownies but with the caramel frosting these were AWESOME!"
"0","3","Although I like honey, I didn't care for it in the frosting portion of this recipe. Other than that, this a fine basic recipe, but I have others I like better. These are not bad, I like a thicker, chewier brownie."
"0","5","NOBODY can resist this brownie!!"
"0","4","Can't go wrong with this one. I don't think it's extraordinary, just a good basic brownie."
"0","5","This is a must if you are a brownie lover. Everyone who has had these brownies have asked for this recipes. I love it. Thanks!!"
"0","5","These are excellent. The only change I made was to briefly micowave the frosting in order to make it spreadable. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","3","I followed the brownie part exactly and skipped the frosting & I must say that these were just ok. They were kind of flat in the suggested pan size. This is one of the only things where I believe that the box is better."
"0","4","I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 pan. It didn't take me any longer to cook it. I also made it with 5 eggs (it was doubled) and it was too cake like. The recipe was ok...kids liked it."
"0","5","These are definately the BEST brownies I have ever had, absolutely wonderful!"
"0","5","I am a brownie conissour and these were dense and fudgy, but a little on the thin side. This was probably because I don't have an 8x8, so I used a 9x9. I used a glass pan and reduced heat to 325 and they turned out great."
"0","3","This recipe wasn't too shabby. Half my friends liked it, and half said the texture was strange... Well, all that mattered was that the birthday boy seemed to like it. It's not the best recipe, but it's good."
"0","2","I don't know, I just don't get it. I have tried a lot of recipes and I do a lot of baking, but I just didn't think these were that great. I made them twice because of the fabulous reviews, and didn't care for them. None of my family liked them much. There are many better brownie recipes out there."
"0","5","I made these brownies for the 4th. I used the pour and frost frosting just because of other reviewers comments. The point is, no matter what frosting you use, the brownies themselves are absolutely delicious! I also added chocolate chips and doubled the recipe so that there was enough to go around. Thanks."
"0","5","These brownies are the best I've ever had! The frosting makes them so rich and the amount of cocoa butter is just perfect. I always serve these at parties and they are eaten just like that. This is definently a recipe that will stay in my recipe box for long generations."
"0","5","these are amazing! I didn't have any honey, but i don't really like it anyway so left it out. i had to add a few table spoons of milk into the frosting because wthout it it wasn't really frosting, but other than that i followed the recipe exactly and it payed off! I can't believe something so quick & easy can be so good! Thanks"
"0","5","Wow! These are amazing. My husband loves brownies and doesn't really like the mixes. We found it to be an excellent combo of fudgey and a little tiny bit cakey. Brought to a landscaping 'party' and they were gobbled up first. People keep asking for them. I'm on batch 4 in one week:) Definitely a keeper for my recipe box!"
"0","3","These were nice, but nice as maybe your regular chocolate cake. I think brownies need to be a lot more fudgey, otherwise your better off baking a chocolate cake. It was nice for a choccie cake, but i'm lost as to what the hype is all about?"
"0","5","veryyy veryy good.. but when i cut the recipe in half the brownies became sort of dry. for the frosting if you substitute the honey in the frosting with caramel. YUM!!!"
"0","3","This recipe isn't the best I've had or made. It was very dry and didn't have a good taste."
"0","3","I really wanted to fall in love with these brownies, but I have to say I didn't. I followed the recipe to a 't', and they were good, very good, but I am not sure they live up to the hype. There is no way to make the frosting without adding milk... and if you do double the recipe, be aware that it will take possibly longer than 30 minutes to bake. The frosting has a distinctly 'honey' taste. This is a GOOD recipe, don't get me wrong. But I will stick to Betty Crocker since its much easier and tastes a bit better."
"0","5","Fantastic! I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Added chocolate chips to the batter which melted into the brownies beautifully.  Served it to company with vanilla ice cream, sprinkles, oreos, more chocolate chips, and chocolate syrup (just so happened I didn't have whipped cream).  Fantastic!"
"0","5","These brownies are awesome! I was even more excited by the frosting. I have tried several times to make frosting instead of buying the store bought and have always struck out. I decided to try one more time and this tasted better than the store bought variety. I heated it in the micro for 15 seconds before mixing to allow for easier mixing and it turned out fabulous! Thanks!"
"0","5","These were so moist yet sorta cakelike at the same time. Cut so easily after cooling. Changed the butter to Crisco with 3 tsp of water per the conversion table on the can of Crisco. Also had 2 yr old grandson helping and had batter on fingers and countertops...but the brownies still turned out! What an easy, great treat! Thanks."
"0","3","am i missing something here? I made these in an 8 inch square pan and they were about 1 inch thick, and I KNOW i put the salt and powder in it. I have had much better homemade brownies and even the box I use is better with milk chocolate pieces added in. When I made the batter up I looked over the recipe several times to see if I had added everything-it was like 1 1/2cups of batter-nothing! I am giving it a 3 only because of the frosting which I really liked and will use again on my homemade recipe or box brownies. I don't see what the fuss is about with this recipe."
"0","5","These are the PERFECT brownies! They would go great served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! You don't need to add additonal liquid to the frosting - just beat it and it'll eventually get there."
"0","5","I always made brownies from store box mix, but these are amazing and taste exactly the same (if not better)! I always add lots of chocolate chips to batter and serve with ice cream and drizzled choc. sauce!!!!!"
"0","5","WOW! Very dense and chewy. This is what I call a real brownie. Wonderful fudge taste without the overpowering bitter cocoa taste some have."
"0","5","As the title says, these are the BEST BROWNIES. They are moist. They last well for several days. I am living in northern Europe where I haven't been able to find any brownie mixes. So I make my own mixes out of the dry ingredients in this recipe and store them in bottles. These are absolutely the BEST BROWNIES and the easiest I have made from scratch. The fact that the recipe calls for cocoa rather than baking chocolate is a plus too."
"0","5","good brownies!! very easy and fast"
"0","5","My husband has never really liked any brownie that I have made. He loves brownies, just not the box kind. I tried this one and it was great. I added chopped walnuts since in my family a brownie is not a brownie without nuts. I made 2 batches, one with 1/2 c nuts and 1/2 c chocolate chips and no icing on top, the other with just the 1/2 c nuts (and since I was out of honey) canned chocolate icing. My kids liked the ones with the icing and my husband the other, but they were both great. I definately recommend this one for ease of prep and the bottom line....it is a darn good brownie."
"0","5","Very easy and very yummy!"
"0","5","I'm not sure how anybody could give this recipe less than 5 stars. These were without a doubt blue ribbon winners. I've been entering items in the fair for a long time and I would have to say the only adjustment needed on these is in the frosting. As somebody else suggested add an egg to make the frosting creamy. I added one egg to a double batch and it was perfect consistency. I just used a spray rather than grease/flour the pans and they came out perfectly. As my teenagers said, 'Mom these are the bomb.' (which I'm told is a good thing)! Thanks Angie for a great recipe."
"0","4","Really Easy! I also used the 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar. Turned out, didn't bother with the frosting and still good!"
"0","3","Pretty basic brownie recipe. Not too cakey, not too fudgey. I've made it with and without the frosting, it's okay either way - but not great."
"0","4","I have just finished making these, and they tast great! the only thing i did wrong was to not grease the pan properly and they stuck to the bottom. hence, i have some that are broken, but the kids don't mind, still gobbled them up. I didn't have a chance to ice them as some are broken, but you really don't need to. they are yummy without it. the only change i made was to use 1\2 white and 1\2 brown sugar, thank you for a quick and delicious recipe."
"0","5","These are too perfect! I've never made a better brownie. They are a perfect combination of fudgy brownies & cakey brownies. Absolutely deeeeeelightful. (By the way, I am eating one as I speak.)"
"0","4","the brownies turn out to be great!first time making brownies for me.but hiwever i have a prob with the frosting,because i used normal sugar instead of confectionary's(dont have any that moment)..so the frosting was filled with crystals.so its a bit off for me. but the brownies itself was great.the next time i do it, i'm gonna exclude the frosting and add some walnut on it..anyway 4star for the brownies."
"0","5","These are excellent brownies! I found them to be very easy to make and they baked up well. I added the peanut butter cookie filling from the Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies III recipe that is on here by spooning it on top and dragging it. WOW! My kids and husband ate a whole 9x13 pan ( I doubled the recipe ) in one day. They said it is a new brownie recipe in this house. LOL! Thanks Angie!"
"0","5","Wonderful brownies! Nothing like anything out of a box. I ditched the frosting..."
"0","4","I found this recipe to be quite good, with a few alterations. First, I substituted a 1/2 cup brown sugar alongside 1/2 cup white sugar for the entire cup of white sugar. Instead of using unsweetened cocoa powder, I used a mixture of sweet ground chocolate plus cocoa. Finally, versus the frosting listed, I used a cream cheese based frosting and added 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder. With these revisions, I have gotten numerous compliments, one of them being, 'Totally Orgasmic!'"
"0","5","This is so good, you wouldn't guess that it's homemade!!!"
"0","5","These brownies are DELICIOUS! And super easy to make, thank you!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! It is the closest thing to 'box brownies' (which are, incidentally, the only pre-packaged food that I consider the standard to strive for). I don't use the icing at all. I throw in a cup each of semi-sweet chips and chopped walnuts to make what I consider to be really really good brownies!"
"0","5","Wow, yum, yum, yum. Easy. These are polished off very quickly!"
"0","3","I had never made brownies from scrach before and I was a little disappointed with these. They were very dense, rather than fluffy and also seemed a little raw, even after I cooked them until a fork came out clean when poked into the middle. They have a good flavor, though, and are very filling."
"0","5","Excellant Brownies. My co-workers loved them. Thanks so much!!!! I keep getting requests for more!!!"
"0","5","These were super! They only took 45 min from start to finish: I used just a dusting of powdered sugar, once cooled, rather than frosting and recommend baking for only 20-25 min to guarentee a soft, chewy center. Great brownies (esp for the chocolate lover); they were a big hit with co-workers and family!"
"0","5","Absolutely Terrific Recipe!! After reading some other reviews, I also doubled the recipe and baked the brownies in a 9x13 pan. I also made a couple of changes. I only used 3 eggs and I used 1/2 cocoa powder and 1/2 unsweetened chocolate squares (melted). I added pecans to the top along with powdered sugar instead of frosting. Great, great, great! I was going to take these to work, but my husband refuses to let me take them!"
"0","5","Your right, this IS the best brownie recipe. Thanks."
"0","4","These were good. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 inch pan. I also left off the frosting. I would have given them 5 stars, but I'm looking for a fudgier, chewier brownie. These were more cake-like."
"0","5","These brownies always turn out delicious. Don't know about the frosting though, I tried it once and never again, a simple sprinkling with confectioner's sugar is all that is needed."
"0","5","best brownies ive made from scratch so far :) gotta see what husband says, hes too busy playing half life 2 to eat it yet. had to bake it for an extra 5 mins. recipe didnt say anything abt leaving it to cool, good thing i remembered, otherwise it woulda been really mushy.sides were nice and crunchy, and my fav part is the crusty top. mmmm...totally satisfied my brownie craving."
"0","4","Not the best, but still very good basic brownies. Mine came out more cake-like, since they weren't fudgy and had the icing."
"0","5","These brownies are so delicious. I've made them with and without the frosting. They always turn out just right. Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"0","1","I used half Splenda, half dark brown sugar and I believe that is why these turned out so BAD. They were very dry and flavorless. I plan to try this again using the exact recipe sometime soon."
"0","4","These brownies were quick and easy to make but I found putting them in an 8' pan made them too flat so next time I will use a 7' pan. I cooked them at 325 F. on my convection setting for 23 min and they came out great. I will definitely be using this recipe again."
"0","5","The brownies were awesome. Soft and almost fudgy. I didn't like the frosting though."
"0","3","These brownies were ok. I found the texture to be good but they were a little bland."
"0","5","Wow! These are incredible. I did make some changes to the icing that I feel made it much better. I omitted the honey and replaced it with about a TBLS of milk and a dollop of sour cream. I also sprinkled pecans on top. And next time I will double the brownie recipe. Delicious!"
"0","4","I thought the Brownies were excellent, probably the best i've ever had. My family loved them and so did I. within the first 5 minutes they were all eaten! so out of ten i give the brownies 9/10! Good on ya Angie!!!"
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","the brownies were a hit my family loved them. I can't waite to make another batch."
"0","5","These are by far the BEST brownies I have ever tasted! The icing is what makes them sooo delicious. I was a little skeptical about the honey, but it doesn't make the icing taste like honey at all. It is soo rich and chocolately. So many of my guests asked for the recipe."
"0","5","Great recipe, was just as easy as a box mix and just as yummy!"
"0","3","Brownies were okay....but not my favorite....I think I'll keep looking. It got mixed reviews in my household. However, it was unanimously agreed that we didn't like the icing.....I think it was the honey flavor....when I eat chocolate icing I want to taste chocolate not honey....and it made the brownies too sweet."
"0","5","Great, moist brownies. You'll probably want to double the recipe though because 16 just isn't enough. Frosting is also excellent. My fiancee must have eaten about 5 in a row!"
"0","4","This is trully a very good brownie recipe. I omitted the frosting, and in fact, I find it a little on the sweet side just by itself without frosting. Next time I'll use less sugar (3/4 cups). Still a very good, moist brownie."
"0","4","Very easy to make. I added 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added some walnuts. Very yummy!!!! Cook in 8 x 8 inch pan for exactly 25 minutes"
"0","4","This recipe was extremely easy and turned out perfectly. I was able to prepare these in about the same time it takes to do a box brownie mix, and they were so much better. I see why these were rated so highly!"
"0","5","My family and I thought these were delicious. It must be all that butter. I doubled the recipe and baked in a larger pan."
"0","4","Nice combination of cake and chewy. I have a convection oven and therefore it ended up slightly over cooked in 22 minutes. Less time next time. It's a good recipe."
"0","5","Fabulous and so simple!"
"0","4","Great Brownies! Be careful not to overbake - my oven over cooked the brownies at the suggested time, so I will try cutting back by 5 minutes next time."
"0","4","My husband and I really liked the brownies. They were moist and fudgy. I didn't care for the frosting. Thought it made the brownies too sweet for my taste and would leave it off next time."
"0","2","This was a disappointment. I made this brownies after reading all the great reviews but it was barely just ok."
"0","5","These are the best brownies I've ever made. The frosting is by far the best part. It's got terrific flavor and consistency, Honey makes it awesome! My husband usually doesn't care for homemade frosting, but when he'll have three brownies at a sitting, and can't stay out of the frosting bowl, I know I've found a winner!"
"0","5","These brownies are perfect! Addictive, you just can't stop eating them! Moist and gooey! I doubled the recipe and I baked them in a bigger pan (11 x 15 inches, 2 inches height). I added in the batter a cup of choped walnuts and 6-7 semi dried apricots, thinely sliced, which have an intense flavour and therefore brownies turned out with a great savour. For making frosting I added a little milk to the composition. Thank you Angie for the recipe!"
"0","3","they were okay. not the brownie taste I was looking for."
"0","3","HAHA! I just have to laugh at Portia's review below! I can't say that I thought these 'sucked', but I've definitely had better. I'm not sure what went wrong but they had an 'off' taste to me, like they needed more sugar or had too much cocoa powder or something. Others seemed to like them fine, so I give them three stars."
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and bakedin 9x13 P. Chef stone, very good. Didn't have time to make the frosting for these. Wonderful without. Does not have the oil taste like you get from the box. Looking forward having these with the frosting. Thanks Angie."
"0","5","These brownies are so good! My family just loves them!"
"0","5","My 10 year old daughter just made these all by herself. No help from me at all. These were perfect!!!! Really good. Next time I think without frosting...mmmmm"
"0","4","i made these without the topping but i think i cooked them for slightly too long because they weren't as moist as i was expecting them to turn out like so next time i make them i will bake them for a shorter amount of time. less than 20minutes. this might be because i've got a fan assisted oven? The topping would have probably made the brownie more moist but i left it out for a lower fat version. Anyway it is a great recipe and i will try it out again thanx"
"0","5","The best! Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I've had this recipe in my files for a couple of years, and I'm just getting around to rating them. I have to say, these are the BEST BROWNIES I have ever made or ate!!! The frosting on top is fantastic!!!! There is no need for box mix or store bought anymore!!!! YUMMMMMMY!!!!! GOOD JOB ANGIE!!"
"0","5","Holy you know what these are good"
"0","5","It was really good i made the best brownies in the class."
"0","4","pretty good when gooey!!!"
"0","5","This is an incredibly simple and straightforward receipt to follow. It’s exactly how the slogan says 'they always turn out'. I highly recommend this receipt to someone who is looking for a great tasting brownie with little to know hassle baking!!"
"0","5","This is the second time I have made these, the first time I dont know what went wrong but they tasted really bad. I decided to try them again and it turned out great. I added some walnuts and chocolate chips cause my hubby loves walnuts in his brownies. I coated them in flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottem. I also added about 1/2 tsp of instant coffee. Never tried the frosting cause I only had enough vanilla for the brownies but want to try it next time. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I have made this recipe 4 times and it never dissapoints! It has a really rich taste to it and I have never made a pan that wasn't gobbled up by my husband *with help of course* within hours of making it. An excellent recipe. I always double it."
"0","4","This recipe had a good flavor but I like my brownies a little more cakey. If I make them again I will try using half the butter. These were a bit too much like raw batter in the middle and I cooked the full 30 mins."
"0","3","These were pretty good, but they tasted salty to me. Maybe I did something wrong.?"
"0","4","what a hit! my family and friends love these whenever i make them for a party...not too sweet and beautifully fudgy."
"0","5","Awesome brownies!! I doubled the recipe in a 9X13. I added about 1 cup total cocoa powder and 1 cup chocolate chips. I baked for 30 minutes and left in oven and finished 10 more minutes with oven off. Perfect for true chocolate lovers!"
"0","5","This is a GREAT brownie recipe!!!!!!!! I made them and the whole pan was gone in 3 days. I doubled the recipe and it fit in a 13x9 inch pan.Also i added 1 teaspoon of mint extract to the batter.If you like a minty taste it really gives it a nice touch.These brownies are super moist and we'll deffinety make them again!"
"0","5","Seriously the best brownies ever! We are living in Oxford, England right now. And for a special treat we go to a little cafe' called G&D's to have amazing brownies. Needless to say, we will be eating in from now on! (However, I followed BATCAVE'S advice and used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I also only used 3/4 c. butter, or 6 tbs., and 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips. Thanks!!!)"
"0","5","These were quick and simple, don't need to buy boxed brownies again."
"0","2","It was too cake-like for me. And, it had a strange flavor. I was hoping it would turn out like those fudgy box mixes. Oh well, will have to find another recipe."
"0","3","I thought that these brownies were just okay. They tasted very much like a boxed brownie mix. They are good if your in a rush or want a drier studier brownie to bring on a picnic. If you like deep chocolate flavor and thick fudgy brownies than this may not be the best recipe for you."
"0","3","These brownies are okay. They were very rich and more fudge-like than chewy. The frosting was very thick and extremely difficult to spread. It went on oily and cooled to a dull finish. The frosting was too sweet."
"0","2","I didn't really like them. For me they turned out cakey and that is not what I prefere. Not only that, they didn't have much flavor to them and I followed the recipe to a T. Not trying these again Sorry!"
"0","5","Very good, I have made them twice now, and my mother got the recipe. The icing was very thick-I added a small amount of milk to thin it out. My sister in law says they are the best she has ever had!"
"0","5","Oh, my goodness, these brownies are so good and easy to make too. Thanks for a great recipe Angie!"
"0","5","Very yummy! My whole family loved them I have made 2 batches in 2 wks! Very easy to make and turn out great the hardest part is having any left the next day!"
"0","5","Although other reviews describe these brownies as very fudgy, mine turned out as the perfect compromise between fudgy and cakey brownies. My only deviation from the recipe was to use extra large eggs. I'm not sure if that made a significant difference, but my family and I loved the results. Plus, the recipe is so easy my 3 year old got to help. This is definitely our new favorite brownie recipe."
"0","5","Wonderful! The brownies were very fudgy."
"0","5","Though we in Malaysia had a natural disaster 'Tsunami'.. I made some effort to bake this brownies.. thank you Angie for the excellent recipe. :)"
"0","5","Every person that I make these brownies for raves about them. The only different thing I do is to add a little bit of milk to the icing - it's wonderful!"
"0","5","These came out perfectly! I used a pie plate to cook them in, added some semi sweet chocolate chips and some peanut butter chips, and cooked them for 25 minutes. We are having them tonight with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge (made from this site using eagle brand condensed milk.....yum!). Thanks for sharing! Just a note these are not *cakey* brownies...they are gooey, fudgy, and wonderful though!"
"0","5","These brownies have the right name. I made them and my family loves them"
"0","4","I just baked these for the first time yesterday. I thought they were very moist and fudgy--almost too much. I prefer a more cakey brownie, but these were so fudgy it was hard to even get them out of the pan. I am not sure how people are ending up with cakey brownies in this recipe. I am not a big chocolate fan, but my husband is! He ate half the brownies in a hour and raved about them. I guess they are good. I didn't make the frosting b/c that would be overkill in my opinion."
"0","5","These truly are the Best!!!"
"0","5","I've made these twice and they do always turn out! I doubled the recipe and put in a 15x10x2 pan and they turned out great. I followed the recipe as is and they were perfect. I never thought homemade brownies would be as good as boxed brownies but they were. I might try some chocolate chips in them next time. I did not make the frosting listed. I just used store bought."
"0","5","These are so easy to make and the results were suprisingly good! I used a 6 inch pan so the brownies were thicker. Icing wasn't neccessary coz it didn't last long. Will add some nuts the next time round. Definately a keeper!"
"0","2","The only thing 'gooey' about this brownie is the frosting, and that is only because I made a mistake of putting 3T of honey instead of one. The brownie itself was cakey and not what most reviewers claimed it to be. I'm giving it 2 stars because it was edible, but I was very disappointed with this recipe."
"0","5","I had to try this recipe with all the great reviews--I was not disappointed. These were some of the fudgiest brownies ever; perfect texture and flavor. I did add 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips, also the frosting needed a little milk to mix up properly. This is a definite keeper--I will make it again and again!"
"0","5","I've made this recipe 3 different times now for my classmates, family, and friends, and each time the brownies are devoured, not one survives. The brownie remains moist and chewy even when the recipe is nearly doubled or halved. Excellent!!!"
"0","5","these are soo good! the brownie is moist and fudgy. but the frostin isnt as good, it didn't even turn out as a frosting texture. it was a crumb mixture. so i added some milk and that made it better but it was kind of syrupy. i will definitly make these again but with a nother icing!"
"0","5","I got lots of compliments for these brownies. I added in half a cup of white chocolate chips and half a cup of dried cranberries. No nuts. I also added in a tablespoon of milk to the icing to help it come together. Fantastic!"
"0","4","These were really good...I printed this recipe out and my girlfiend surprised me by making these, on day...Brownies and a glass of milk...YUM...I only gave them 4 stars since I like my brownies really gooey, and I would have added some nuts for texture..."
"0","5","This is the chewy brownie recipe I've been searching for! They came out perfectly and tasted great. Chewy not cakey. I used carob powder instead of the cocoa powder as my husband prefers it. I also didn't get a chance to frost them -- they didn't last that long. Thanks. This one's a keeper!"
"0","5","Good, rich, delicious brownies. Easy to make. One will satisfy even the most intense chocolate craving. Frosting is good but needs about a T. of Milk"
"0","2","Not impressed. Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines still do a beter job. These are good with ice cream."
"0","5","These were the best brownies I've had in a very long time!! Exactly the nice, fudgy brownies I was looking for."
"0","5","I made these over 2 years ago and still get requests for them! Excellent"
"0","5","Excellent recipe....thank you!"
"0","5","These really are wonderful brownies that are so easy to make with ingredients that are usually on-hand. The brownies are so moist and fudgy and scored big points with my family. Thanks Angie!!"
"0","5","After finding this recipe, no store bought brownie mix will enter my house."
"0","5","Great brownies, next time I'll add nuts to the icing."
"0","5","These brownies live true to their name!! My husband and I took some to our workplaces for Bosses Day. My husband's boss said they were the best brownies he has ever had. They were oh so ooey and gooey. Make sure you double the recipe!! One change I made-I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for a richer flavor, and added milk to the frosting."
"0","3","These were okay, to cake-like for me. I prefer a chewey brownie. The frosting required some evaporated milk for sure at least two tablespoons to allow it to even appear like frosting."
"0","5","I agree that these are excellent brownies. The frosting is also pretty good, but not as good as the brownies themselves."
"0","2","I just made these brownies, and wow!, they are too sweet for even me (a big chocoholic). My frosting was also way too clumpy, perhaps only 1/2 cup confectioners sugar instead of 1 cup."
"0","4","The first time I made them they were overdone, and not very good so I tried again and baked for 20 minutes only. I also added a small amount of milk to the frosting to make it easier to spread. They were delicious with these changes. The only problem I had was getting them cut and out of the pan looking nice. They were very messy- I had to eat all the odd shaped, gooey ones :-)"
"0","5","great, fudgy and full of chocolate flavor."
"0","5","How many ways can you say YUMMYYY??!! These brownies are awesome and a hit with everyone! Only problem is I can't keep them around long enough!"
"0","5","They are the BEST brownies, I got the recipe yesterday and have made them twice. I am baking some right now to take to a friend. They are so easy and so good. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Hey Angie, I tried this recipe today and my kids loved them. My son told me these are the best brownies he has ever eaten. Have a nice day bye"
"0","5","I was slightly short on flour so these came out a little spongy in texture, to no fault of the recipe but the frosting truly saved the day! It was incredible. I live in Canada where we typically don't frost our brownies but this frosting recipe has converted me!"
"0","5","I usually use boxed brownie mix. I tried this recipe the other day and it is as good as it's 5 star rating. I made them just as directed and they turned out awesome!!!"
"0","5","Absolutly Delicious!! Dont change anything its perfect. Thanks Angie these always satisfy my sweet tooth!!"
"0","3","These were ok. My husband really liked them, but I found them to be cake-like and buttery instead of fudgey and chocolately. I may try again, but I think I'll keep looking. Thanks, Angie."
"0","2","I followed it to a 'T'...and I made brownie flavored poundcake...Tasted just like the MRE version...but the marine corp memory was worth it."
"0","5","I use this recipe all of the time, they are the best brownies! I add chocolate chunks for an added treat! I also sometimes mix sprinkles into the frosting (which hardens). A+!"
"0","5","made these but added some lite and tasty (nz breakfast cereal) turned out wonderful lol to the point that it has all been eaten in one day my boys love it .. a big time ty to the person who submitted it it rocks"
"0","5","My family and me love it so much, thank you."
"0","5","Wow these are so good. I always buy box mixes because I thought Brownies would be difficult to make. Wrong! These were easy and so good. I used a 9 inch pan and cooked for 20 minutes they came out chew and gooey."
"0","5","I've made this twice using the suggestions-doubling the recipe both times. It turned out fantastic! Added walnuts (2 cups because I doubled) and only 1 cup chocolate chips. When I doubled the chips it seemed like too much. Used the brown sugar suggestion too. This is my permanante brownie recipe. Extremely easy to make. Just watch the bake time. It's easy to let it get to the over-baked edges stage. I'm baking it only 20-25 minutes on my oven. Better taken out too early then too late! It still bakes a teeny more as it cools."
"0","5","TERRIFIC! These are the perfect brownies in my opinion. Great slightly chewy brownie texture and very chocolaty. I loved that I can make them with ingredients that I always have on hand. I usualy make cookies when I feel like having a snack because they are quick and easy. I will now be baking these brownies. These were sooooo fast and easy. I can`t wait to make them again!"
"0","2","they were okay, they didnt rise at all, remianed flat. i think the baking powder mentoined in the recipe is too little, and shudd b at least 1 tsp. also, u shudd use less sugar, otherwise the icing wudd b too sweet. even in the cake less sugar is sufficient. overall: a bit of a disappointer."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Very Moist! The only thing I would do to suite my taste is to double the icing recipe."
"0","5","These brownies were sooooo good. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of them! He got up in the middle of the night just to eat them because he was craving them in his sleep! The frosting is great and they are veryyyy chocolatey. Will make again, thanks!"
"0","5","These brownies were absolutely amazing, best brownies i have ever had or made. The frosting would probably have been better if i hadn't screwed up and used granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar. I figured that it would have turned out anyways, it didn't. The brownies were excellent, the frosting was mediocre and that was my own fault. Definitely will have to do this recipe again."
"0","4","This was my first attempt at making brownies from scratch, and they turned out pretty good. I liked the crisp top and fudgy texture. I wouldn't say they were the best brownies that I ever had though. I didn't try making the frosting, because I didn't have any honey on hand. I can't wait to try the recipe again with the frosting."
"0","5","Wonderful! Not many people used the frosting on the review...but it tastes great with it!"
"0","2","I don't know what happened. I followed the instructions but they were bitter and cake like. I've had better brownies from a box."
"0","5","These brownies were so good and easy to make. I actually joined to write this review. Will never buy another mix or try another recipe. It just won't compare."
"0","5","These were the first brownies I've ever made and they turned out great! I added some chopped nuts to the mix. Didn't feel like it needed the frosting, so I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. Everyone loved these and begged for more! Will definitely make again, might use less sugar next time."
"0","5","Two words: EASY & YUMMY! Could'nt get any easier than this. I did not get to make the icing because I used the last bit of cocoa powder on the brownies, but I'll try it next time. I will definately be adding this to my recipe album. Thanks for sharing with us."
"0","4","This was very good. i was a sceptical at the beginning, because the recipe doesn't use chocolate, but only cocoa, but it turns out good. i will make it again, but will put less sugar in the frosting, which was a liitle too sweet"
"0","5","PERFECT BROWNIES!! I could eat the whole pan! Next time I'll add milk chocolate chips to the batter. I creamed the butter and cocoa powder till fluffy instead of melting the butter in the sauce pan. Didnt try the frosting. I just dusted with powerdered sugar and served them on a plate. Beautiful!"
"0","5","OMG! These are the BEST brownies I've ever tasted. I made 3 batches last night because my husband was 'brownie happy'. Very easy to make and the batter is absolutely DELICIOUS even alone. This is a recipe that I I enjoyed and I will definitely be making a lot. Thanks Angie!!!"
"0","5","These brownies turned out great! Really yummy!"
"0","5","this recipe was exactly how i like my brownies i have tried 4 recipes on this site and this was by far the best! my brother ate half a dozen within an hour!i made half the recipe using a smaller pan and didnt put the baking powder and it was perfect!!AWESOME!!"
"0","4","These were very good with ice cream and some sliced strawberries. I think there are better brownie recipes out there, though."
"0","5","Angie, you rock! I like lots of add-ins to my brownie goodness, so in went 1 C chopped walnuts, 1 C white chocolate chips, 1 C semi-sweet chocolate chips; plenty of that good Mexican vanilla; have been making that pwd sugar/butter/vanilla/cocoa/half-n-half frosting for years and that works too. And they are so much better the next night I could not believe! I bet some brown sugar (half or all) would be good too. Next time maybe! Thanx, hon."
"0","2","the brownie did not turn out well... however, the frosting was very good... i sub most of the sugar with honey and added a little milk."
"0","5","These are the best brownies I have ever had. I am about to make my second pan right now and had to stop to review before I forget to share just how good these are. Incredible!!!!!! I made them exactly as directed and will not change a thing this time either. Thanks."
"0","5","This was the greatest brownie recipe I've ever tried! I changed the recipe a little bit; I added 1/2 cup soft brown sugar instead of white sugar and raisins.Although I didn't prepare the topping,this was the tastiest and chewiest one ! And also non cake-like"
"0","5","i made it and me and all my friends loved it fr:megan evans age 11"
"0","5","Not many brownies I like but these were really good. I added about a cup of chopped pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I didn't think I'd like the frosting either, but that was really good, too. I'll keep this recipe close cuz I'll definitely be making these a LOT (tasted even better with mint choc. chip ice cream)."
"0","5","okay, i take back my last review. my niece and I tried to make them again and for some reason they came out great! She says 'perfecto' Don't know what I did differently but yeah, they are the bomb."
"0","5","These turned out perfect! The first time I made them they were a bit cake-y, but the second time (in 2 wks!!!) I just reduced bake time by almost 10 mins. and they turned out really great. So delicious!"
"0","4","Very Good Brownies.. Very thin... Couldn't get them out of the pan easily.. I will make again."
"0","5","These brownies taste totally awesome! They have a great texture, not too cakey and not to fudgey, a happy compromise."
"0","2","ok..not the best...will stick to boxed recipes."
"0","5","These brownies were very good!!!! Definitely needed milk with these!!"
"0","5","Awesome brownies. This is the first time I've made brownies from scratch. I will never use a brownie mix again! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and baked it for a few extra minutes."
"0","5","I've never had much of a sweet tooth but I would occasionally have a brownie at work when someone was kind enough to bring treats for the crew. These brownies are different than the ones I've had in the past. Although very sweet, these are light and fluffy and are a real taste treat. This is my first attempt making brownies and I thought they were easy to make and REALLY easy to eat! The frosting spreads very easily if you put the frosting on immediately after you take it out of the oven."
"0","5","Absolutely love this recipe!!! Very easy and very good. Rich, chocolate flavor!"
"0","5","This recipe was so easy and soooo good!! Thanks!!"
"0","4","Good brownies. Used the 'Creamy chocolate frosting' to put on top. These are for chocolate fans though. I made them for work and I now know that there are not too many chocoholics here. I still had brownies left over 2 days later. Usually when I make baked goods, everything's gone by the afternoon. May make again b/c it was easy."
"0","3","Something was off. I'm not quite sure what it was but I did follow the recipe to the T."
"0","3","I prefer brownies without any frosting &, in the case of this recipe, I would certainly skip the frosting. The brownies are good & very easy to make; however, the frosting is terribly sweet."
"0","5","These are awesome and easy enough for my husband to make. They are requested everytime I attend an event. I don't use the front, I love them plain. I also like to plop peanut butter on the top while hot and use it like a frosting."
"0","5","This is my go-to brownie recipe. Somtimes I frost them. Sometimes I don't.  The last time I made these I put about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chunks in the batter. Yummy! It's like having the frosting inside!"
"0","5","These are so awesome! I am terrible at baking and my fiance was begging me to make more. It's the first time he's ever had seconds on something I've baked!!"
"0","5","These were great! Made them for mother's day and they were a huge hit. The chocolate frosting makes them so much more interesting than regular brownies!"
"0","5","My friends really enjoyed these...but, personally, I thought the buttery flavor was a bit intense. Overall, the recipe was great, thanks!!! :)"
"0","5","I baked these for my dad and he loved them!!! I love them to. In fact everyone who tried them loved them!"
"0","5","delicious! i baked them for the school's musical bake sale and sold out reaallly fast!"
"0","5","I rated these before and have to put my tail between my legs because I only gave them 3 stars. Since I rated them right away after baking them, they really changed after I waited. If you wait until they cool and the frostings sets up, these are awesome! I want some right now. They are great warmed up just a tad with ice cream on them (and hot fudge if you dare) MMM... Make sure to wait before reviewing these so you don't have to come back and change your review :0)"
"0","5","This was great!! Like everyone said, it came out fantastic. I wouldn't encourage the fudge frosting though; for me, it tasted a bit bittersweet. But the brownie - exquisite. and i even messed up by accidentally putting baking soda instead of baking powder! but it was still yummy, and everyone loved it."
"0","5","WOW!!! I just made these for a small get together and EVERYONE had seconds. They all raved about how great they were. I especially liked the crisp top and fudgy texture. No more boxed mixes for me:)"
"0","5","Excellent! The best homemade brownies I've ever had! Gone in no time!!! Better than any box mix!!! THANK YOU for sharing! This is a family fav!"
"0","5","Simply put, the BEST BROWNIES! 10 Stars! My husband couldn't get over how much better they tasted than my typical scratch brownie. Because I have a wheat allergy, I substituted Oat flour for the wheat flour and you just couldn't tell. Territories were staked out in the pan and my typically unselfish family became very possesive of 'their' pieces! Will definitely make over and over again, but will have to DOUBLE the recipe to keep everyone happy! Thanks!"
"0","3","These were the best 'from scratch' brownies I've made, but I still prefer the results I get from brownie mixes."
"0","5","Definitely the best brownies I have made from scratch. I followed the recipe exactly and used an oval corningware dish to bake it in. I love it with icing and without. My husband loved them too and he has never liked 'from scratch' brownies before. Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","fabulous!~didn't have a 8 inch pan..so just made muffins and kept an eye on them untill cooked all the through (tested w/ toothpick untill came out clean!) great will not buy boxed again! Didn't even make frosting! great without it!"
"0","4","Flavor was great, but mine were cakey."
"0","5","These brownies are AWESOME! It was the first time I made brownies from scratch and they were easy and SO tasty. I made half the recipe and put them in 4 cupcake foils inside of a baking pan. I didn't really pay attention to the timing, I just checked on them until they were the consistency that I like them. They taste really good. A bit heavy on the chocolate side, but great! The frosting was excellent in its own right. I am going to use it for other recipes. Thanks so much!"
"0","5","Wowee! the BEST brownies ever! I didn't have a 8 in. sq pan, so i did mine in a slightly larger pan and just cut off a few minutes cook time. They are fool proof!!! And I took another raters advice and frostest them with the creamy chocolate frosting recipe by tracy and they ROCKED!!!!! you GOTTA try these!!!!"
"0","5","Very easy to make! I did not make the frosting since my husband doesn't like frosting on anything chocolate. I would double the recipe next time because in my opinion, it would only last a day in our house! I also melted butter in microwave to save time."
"0","3","These are all right - the kids were happy with them. I prefer the taste and texture of brownies made with melted chocolate."
"0","5","You bet these always turn out! I really tried hard to screw them up too. The frosting came out much too thick but I tried to put it on the warm brownies anyway. Just plopped it on here and there then tried to spread it but the top started to rip off. I managed to spread it around a bit but it wasn't melting at all and looked awful so I threw the entire pan into the broiler to soften it. I forgot about them and they were bubbling away by the time I took the pan out. Let it cool and tested one small corner. MMMMMMmmmmmmmm. Like truffles. They cut beautifully too. I'm sending them in the mail and I'm sure they'll travel well also. This will be my new brownie recipe."
"0","5","these were the Best! I loved them, I'll definately make them again. I didn't have honey to make the frosting, but they were good without it."
"0","5","best brownies ever!!! not sure on the frosting though... yum yum yum!!!!"
"0","5","No doubt the best brownies ever!!! I never use the frosting because it will turn out to sweet for my taste. Even my picky boyfriend ask for more."
"0","4","I made these brownies last night! They were very fudgie! I love them! I doubled the recipe but only used 3 eggs. Baked under 25 minutes! I will make them every chance i get! I topped them with: 1cup peanut butter melted with 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Pour over while still hot! YUM!"
"0","5","These brownies are great! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan. Not too fudgey or too cakey. I didn't even need to use the frosting. A definite keeper!"
"0","4","I made 2 batches of this today. It was very easy to make and turned out well. This was my 1st time in making brownies from scratch!! I did not make the frosting as i do not like it on brownies."
"0","5","This recipe is so easy to make and turns out great every time. They are really moist, which makes them keep for a long time."
"0","5","THIS IS A 10 STAR RECIPE!! I ONLY MAKE THESE BROWNIES AND EVERYONE RAVES!! ANGIE U ROCK!"
"0","5","wonderful with or without the frosting!"
"0","4","good but don't do the frosting hard to make and spread they just a good with out the frosting"
"0","3","I made these for Valentines Day and to add a little more to it I put red suger on top of it. They went over great."
"0","5","Wonderful! Everybody wanted to repeat. Simple, quick, cheap & tasty. Maybe next time I'll add some chopped walnuts, hazelnuts raisins or something like that."
"0","5","my boyfriend absolutely loves these brownies and i don't even use the frosting! ...careful to make sure of your oven temperature though - my oven cooks a lil' fast and once turned these brownies into a 'cake' - but the flavor was still wonderful!"
"0","5","I just loved those. This is the best thing I ever tasted!!! I'm now browniecholic! Actually, I compared some other brownies recipes from this site and what I noticed, was that Deep Dish Brownies and Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies are actually the same recipe as Best brownies. Deep Dish brownies have only little more salt and baking powder compered to Best brownies. And Mm better brownies use v oil not melted butter."
"0","5","These were really good brownies. Per another reviewer I did not add the baking powder. They were great. I did not use the icing either. I used some cream cheese icing I had. These will be made again in my house!"
"0","2","These were very heavy and dry. Interesting flavor but no one wanted me to make them again. Also the frosting was not what I expected...very hard to spread. Was it just me?"
"0","4","I thought these brownies were very good, EXTREMELY chocolatey so BEWARE! I to added a bit of oil as they were very dry. Very good with whipped cream on top instead of the normal chocolate frosting as it balances the flavors better. A great recipe!"
"0","5","My husband is on a non-dairy diet. I replaced the butter in this recipe with non-dairy margarine from Trader Joes and the result was unbelievably delicious. This will be the only brownie recipe I'll make in future! Thanks!"
"0","4","These are good, but somebody PLEASE tell me what I am doing wrong? I made these twice. Both times the frosting is really thick and looks like it need milk added or something. When I spread it over the warm brownies, it doesn't spread out well. They taste good, mine just didn't look good."
"0","4","The recipe was easy to make and delicious!!! I will definitely make it again."
"0","5","I really enjoyed these. However, I would suggest adding a little milk to the frosting to make it spreadable and have good texture. They were delightful!"
"0","5","Outstanding!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","My family loved it even if my husband said it's too sweet. My boy loved the frosting. When I tried it second time, I reduced the amount of sugar by one-third and it turned out to be not so good. It was less sweet but dry. I recommend use exact amounts of ingredients if you want to try for the first time. You can modify the amounts later once you taste it. Most of all, do NOT overcook, NEVER. The moisture dried out. If you want to have chewy brownies, less than 25 minutes in the oven would be good (It was done before 25 minutes in my oven). It is best when it's warm even if it is not bad after a day or two. Keep the brownies in an air tight container. It will keep some moisture."
"0","5","This is definately the best brownie recipe I've tried. They didn't last a day in my house. Now I am being asked to bring them to parties!! I did follow the recipe exactly until it came to the frosting. I did find it a little thick and added the tablespoon of milk like someone else had suggested. Excellent!!!"
"0","4","I doubled this recipe, only put 2 eggs and 1/4 tsp. baking powder in it. I also used margarine instead of butter. I used 2 tsp of milk in the frosting(doubled recipe) and corn syrup in place of honey. I thought these were as delicious as boxed if not better. That's my opinion."
"0","5","This is a great recipe that was enjoyed by my family, they were so good I diddn't even frost them"
"0","5","These brownies are wonderful! They're simple to make and turn out perfect every time I make them."
"0","3","I was not too happy with these brownies. I tried the recipe because of all the reviews and was VERY disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out too cakey for my liking. They did not have the true brownie flavor and texture that I am looking for. Ghirardelli boxed brownies are still my favorite. Sorry Angie :("
"0","4","These are really popular!"
"0","4","wOw!! this is the best brownies ive baked so far! this is even better than betty crockers! =) the only thing that i might adjust is the sugar beucase it was a lil too sweet for my taste and the frosting even made it more sweeter! so instead of frosting the whole brownie...first i cut the brownie into little squares and drizzled the frosting on (remmeber to add about a tablespoon of milk so it can have a smooth and shiny consistency as someone had suggested earlier)..and shifted some powdered sugar onto it. make sure to topple the brownie squares on top of each other onto a tray, kind of like a pyramid. it will look as if u got it from the bakery store! works great for gifts or sympathy tray. remember u dont want to give so much out. u want to give them just a lil bit under enough so they will come back begging for more! i love these brownies! yummie! VERY moist! not too chocolately! perfectO! thankkks for the wonderful and easy recipe! =D"
"0","5","These were very good! I had family staying overnight and wanted something quick for the children. The children helped make them. I had everything on hand, another plus. I served these with vanilla ice cream and homemade chocolate syrup on top. No leftovers!!!"
"0","5","I got a craving bor brownies last night around 1am. So, I got online and found this recipe. The brownies turned out FANTASTIC. I made the brownies and the icing. I fudged the icing up the first time because I didn't soften the butter, but I tossed that batch and tried again, am glad that I did. Definitely plan on making these again."
"0","4","Very good. Took another reviewers advice and doubled the recipe but used a 8x11 pan. Next time I will add chocolate chips and/or nuts to make these even tastier!! No need for icing!"
"0","5","One Friday night fully clad for bed I got the worst sweet attack and found this recipe. This is like 'manna from heaven'. So darn easy and ingredients almost any kitchen would have readily available. I did have some toffee chips I threw in and some pecans, and 'boy howdy', did they fill the bill! I burned the roof of my mouth, I couldn't wait to test them out, really great. Thanks, Angie"
"0","5","This are some of the best brownies ive ever made! i was worried at first because of the small amounts of flour but it turned out great! i doubled the recipe and didnt make the frosting but put betty crocker's vanilla frosting on it and a few chocolate shavings. I took it to a party and it was a HIT!!!! Thanx Angie!!!!!"
"0","5","SOOOOO Good ! Excellent and easy, just what I was looking for. I did increase the cocoa to 1/2, because I had read a lot of the reviews. They turned out great. Thanks Angie"
"0","3","Not very fudgy at all. Okay, but the boxed version is beeter!"
"0","4","These were great - never been able to make successful brownies before but they were delicious despite that I did overcook the base a little. Lovely and chewy!"
"0","5","These were Yummy! They didn't last very long everyone thought it was more like fudge then brownies but still delicious."
"0","5","In the past I have tried recipes that have been reviewed as being the best, and being disappointed in the results. Let me just say, these are the BEST brownies, not just because they taste wonderful...but they are made without anything fancy! My whole family loved them, even my non-chocolate loving daughter, who said that she wished she had more than two thumbs - because they were that yummy! See...600+ reviews, couldn't be too wrong!"
"0","4","Like most of the other reviews I found this recipe to be very easy to make and overall very tasty. I did not make the frosting because I thought it would be too sweet. I also added almonds to the mixture and it came out just great. What I like most of all was that the ingredients used were simple and I had it all available in my kitchen."
"0","3","Not a big fan of powdered cocoa. Will not be making these again. They did not taste as good as package mixes."
"0","5","Very very chocolatey and delicous."
"0","5","Wonderful brownies. :) Had a hard time staying away from them."
"0","5","5* PLUS! These brownies are aptly named! I added some chocolate chips, this was chocolate heaven!!!!"
"0","3","I couldn't get the frosting to come out but the brownies were good."
"0","4","Tried these last night and the family said they were better than the last home made batch. However I like my brownies to be less cakey. I like good old fudge brownies like the box mix. I will make these again if I can't find a fudge recipe."
"0","5","Absolutely Fantastic!! And easy to make!"
"0","5","These brownies are absolutely delicious. Very moist and the frosting is awesome too. This is the only recipe I will use for brownies from now on."
"0","5","These brownies are the best. I topped mine with chocolate chips and walnuts. They are so rich!"
"0","5","Wow- absolutely delicious! I used margarine and skipped the frosting, and they were still incredibly good."
"0","5","Absolutely the best tasting and easiest to make brownies that you'll find on this web site!"
"0","5","Very fudgy, better than any bakery!"
"0","4","this recipe was pretty good, although the mixture didn't stay together very well."
"0","5","These were just great! My whole family loved them. I added about a tablepoon of milk to the frosting so it was a little creamier. I'll never use a box mix again!"
"0","5","These were great. My brothers and father ate them in a day and a half. If making these for the first time, mix all the ingredients in the same pot/pan the butter was melted in."
"0","5","I made various members of my family give me a star rating for these brownies, and everyone agreed they were a five! They're a great basic brownie--imagine the add-in possibilities!!"
"0","5","I though to myself they are brownies how good can they be. THEY ARE GREAT!. Very chocolatey without being to sweet. Will make many times."
"0","3","These brownies were okay, but I'm not convinced they are the best. The icing was really a pain to make and disappointing. I also had to add some milk to get the correct consistency. The kids loved them, but I don't know if the pain of making these is worth my time over the boxed kind."
"0","3","Very dense and fudgy. The frosting was sweet without being cloying. I like the honey in the frosting. I had to add a little milk to the frosting to get it to the correct consistency. Overall, good brownie."
"0","5","Delicious! I'll definitely make these again. They were nice and gooey."
"0","5","I made this for my last birthday instead of a birthday cake - I made 2 batches of double the mixture as separate slabs, sandwiched them with cookies and cream ice cream in the middle and then topped with hot fudge sauce (store-bought) - and voila - instant birthday cake!! Even with 64 servings and only 25 people, it disappeared in about 5 minutes!"
"0","5","These are the easiest best tasting brownies that I have ever made. My family loves them and they are requested for special family get togethers."
"0","5","Wow these brownies are good! I've made them every time I run out ever since I got the recipe. I never think the icing is going to work, but it always does."
"0","5","Truly the best brownies ever. They ALWAYS turn out, I make them at least once a week and they're gone before they cool down."
"0","5","Without a doubt, this is the BEST brownies recipe I've ever made. It's impossible to muck these up, so they turn out beautiful EVERY SINGLE TIME! Fantastic"
"0","5","Super easy to make and taste great (especially the first day) The frosting was thick to spread but sure tasted good."
"0","5","Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"0","5","My family and I really enjoyed these! Chewy and VERY Chocolatey!! I found we had to cook them longer than the suggested time... 60 mins, but then again, our stove is quite old."
"0","5","I'm not a big fan of brownies, but these are great! Very moist, and I had no problem with the icing turning out perfectly with ingredients as stated. I'll definitely make these again."
"0","4","The best bowl-lickin' brownies this side of the Missippi!!!They were a kick at our ward prayer!!!"
"0","5","Very good!"
"0","3","They were ok. I wasn't impressed."
"0","3","Others liked them, but thought they were a bit too rich. I don't think I'll make them again."
"0","5","These really are the best! Very moist. Stayed moist for the few days that they lasted."
"0","5","FANTASTIC! People raved about these at a recent baby shower. NO more boxed mixes for me! I did need to add a tablespoon of milk to the icing to make it spreadable, but that was my only modification besides doubling the recipe. Thanks for a real winner!"
"0","4","mine turned out like chocolate cake, too! it was not moist and chewy as i hoped it would be. and i wonder what i did wrong because it didnt slice too well. nonetheless, everybody liked it! i might tweak this recipe a little to find my desired consistency. thanks for this recipe, too!"
"0","5","yum yum... i put small 'dallops' of frosting all over the brownies as soon as they came out of the oven and spreaded it a couple minutes later, after it melted a bit"
"0","5","Yum!!"
"0","5","These are the greatest brownies!! Really easy to make and soooo good."
"0","4","Great Recipe....Fairly Easy. Extremely Chocolatey and Rich."
"0","5","My only complaint is this doesn't make nearly enough.These will be gone almost as soon as you make them. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","One of my older brothers loves brownies ... he helped us out on the farm one day ... so I thought I'd make him a batch. But I wanted something new ... and WOW ... what can I say ... he didn't believe me that I actually made these ones! The were awesome ... better double it though ... they go real fast!"
"0","5","Mmmm... these were yummy! I was very skeptical during the whole process, but they turned out great! I did have to add milk to the frosting, because it wasn't smooth at all with the ingredients listed. Very good & definitely a keeper!"
"0","3","Maybe I did something wrong, these were okay, not great. I prefer Hershey's quick and easy brownies. They were eaten up so they couldn't have been bad. Just not my favorite. I thought they seemed stale on the first day."
"0","5","These brownies were nothing less than great!"
"0","5","This is a great brownie recipe, not to sweet and all the ing. are allready in the house. Defent. the best ive made so far. i didnt use the frosting but sounds good, chewy and moist. A++++++++++++++++++++"
"0","5","This is the best recipe. EASY and GOOD, I will make these again and again. Never buy a box mix when you can make these delcious brownies. Thanks"
"0","5","I have tried many a brownie recipe and they always are too dry or too chewey or not chocolatey enough. These are amazing. My husband said that these were the best brownies that I had ever made and they were so quick and easy. I always have these ingredients on hand, so I know I will make them again. THANKS"
"0","4","WONDERFUL wont use the box again!!"
"0","5","These are the BEST brownies ever..just like the title..so ooey & gooey. A huge hit for my family. I just used choc. chips over top right when they came out of oven since I didn't have confectioner's sugar. I probably will never buy boxed again!! THANKS!!"
"0","5","I've always made brownies from a box foolishly believing them to be easier to prepare. These were simple, quick, and tasted fabulous"
"0","5","Thes brownies are the best! They always turn out and are great for summer parties and kids!"
"0","5","There's nothing else to say besides these brownies are the best!"
"0","5","My daughter Emilee made these, she is 10. These are better than a box! Very yummy !!! She will definalty be making them again!"
"0","5","This was a VERY good recipe that I've used over and over...thanks much :)"
"0","5","Theses are absolutely outstanding. Thank you Angie!"
"0","5","Some friends and I made these late one night while we were all having a chocolate craving. They turned out so good! But we didnt have any honey for the topping so instead we used chocolate and caramel syrup mixed in with the rest of the topping recipe. We loved them, and they were gone by morning! thanks"
"0","5","REALLY GOOD! I scaled the recipie for 36 servings and made them in a 9x13 pan and it worked perfectly. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I did make the icing.....delicious! It is very rich with the icing though, so dont make it if you aren't absolutely crazy about chocolate. I will try it next time without the frosting just to eat these yummy brownies in their pure state. To everyone that added milk to the frosting.....this is not necessary if you frost the brownies immediately after taking them out of the oven. The very thick mixture melts into a wonderful spreading consistency. Great recipie!"
"0","5","very easy to make and delicious! even without the frosting, which I forgot to make."
"0","5","YUM! Melts in your mouth! The crumbly topping is the big seller here. We've used it on our packaged brownies too.(cakes & cookies maybe too?) Just make sure the brownie is cooled off enough to be luke warm. Otherwise the topping will clump and not spread evenly."
"0","5","All I can say is WOW! I've been searching for an excellent, fudgy, moist but not too moist brownie with excellent flavor for some time now and have finally found it! Delicious! We added chocolate chips to the top before baking, rather than the icing and they're wonderfuL!"
"0","5","Real good flavor but thin and chewy - fudgy. My preference is cakelike. Frosting is great and easy, I'll keep using it on cupcakes. Thanks, Pam"
"0","5","These brownies turned out excellent! I doubled the recipe with no problem. I had an extra tub of Milk Choc. Whipped Frosting (I think it was Duncan Hines) and spread only about a third of it while the brownies were still warm. I used an airbake pan lined with parchment and also lowered the temp to 325, baking for 30+ min (inserting a cake tester to test for doneness) if that helps anyone who had trouble with gooeyness."
"0","5","I made these for my cousin's engagement party & they were a hit! I will definitely make these again!"
"0","4","The brownies were excelent, great for my sweet tooth. The only problem is that my icing did not come out right. It was too dry and was extremely clumpy. I will use the brownie recipie again but a different icing recipe."
"0","5","This came out great when I made it the first time exactly per the recipe. The second time I doubled the quantity and it was a bit sweet. I guess some adjustments have to be made when doubling the quantity, which I have to figure out."
"0","5","GREAT! Took them to a BBQ and everyone loved them. Thanks"
"0","5","I needed a quick dessert for unexpected dinner guests and this was perfect! Easy, quick, and delicious!!!"
"0","4","So FAST to make. I immediately decided to make a second batch to bring to work. A 'rich' brownie...I only had half fo one."
"0","5","Yummy, rich, and so easy I will never use a mix again. Thank you"
"0","5","GReat brownies! And so fast to make..!"
"0","5","very good a keeper"
"0","5","I have made these twice now and it's true 'these always turn out'. Who knew you could make brownies without a box mix. These are so good that the second time I made them I doubled the recipe because there just weren't enough to go around the first time. Thank you for this recipe."
"0","5","I didn't make the frosting b/c I thought it might be 'too much'. I also put a dash of instant espresso which was nice and subtle. I will definitely make this one again!"
"0","5","These are incredible! I've never made brownies from scratch before, and this recipe was incredibly easy. I even made them in my toaster oven using a Pampered Chef Mini Bar Pan. They're fantastic. I'll never use a boxed mix again! Thanks for a great recipe Angie!"
"0","5","Wonderful homemade brownies!!!"
"0","5","I love theme all my friends loved theme to !!!!!"
"0","5","Very good! I doubled this recipe, and it still turned out great. I also used caramel instead of honey in the icing-just because it sounded good...and it was. Try this recipe..you won't  be disappointed. Thanks Angie!"
"0","5","I am always skeptical when I see/hear 'The Best...' and was expecting to fail at making them, but they turned out to be the best I've ever made & had. I will never buy brownie mix again."
"0","5","This was the first brownies I've ever made, and I think it is one of the best I'll ever find! Thank you."
"0","5","I have been using this exact recipe for years (just modified to fit a smaller pan) but I had never frosted it before. The combination makes 'The Best Brownie' hands down. I'll never make another Brownie recipe again."
"0","4","We all enjoyed them and they were very easy to make."
"0","4","Call me crazy, but these just aren't the best brownies I've ever had. Sorry."
"0","5","This is the best brownie recipe I have ever used! Brownies were perfect! This will be a frequently used recipe for me."
"0","5","I'm amazed! I generally hate chocolate-y things but these were so yummy. *Make sure you let the brownies cool first before removing them from the pan. I made that mistake the first time I made these! (No worries though...my boyfriend just said 'Oh...guess I'll just have to eat them!!!')"
"0","5","I didn't even take the time to add the frosting and this was awesome!!!!"
"0","5","Okay, this was the 1st time that I tried making brownies from scratch. I was so glad that they turned out great. My hunnie never eats brownies but he ate these ones. He told me that he couldn't help it because they taste so great. The whole house loved them. I added chocolate chips in them to make it even more chocolatey. -yummy!. Thanks Angie."
"0","5","These are fabulous!! I can't believe how easy this recipe was. I made this for company, for the first time, and they couldn't believe these were homemade. A keeper in my files!!!!"
"0","5","delicious, almost doubled it for a 9 x 13 pan and worked just great"
"0","5","These brownies were absolutely delicious. Easy to make and had my hubby saying 'more, more, more'. Great recipe, will definately make again."
"0","5","These brownies are great! I didn't use the frosting because I thought that would be too much. I doubled the recipe and added a cup of chocolate chips. They are a big hit with my family."
"0","5","These really are the best brownies! I love to bake, but I haven't found a brownie recipe that my husband prefers over the boxed kind until now. Plus, they are really quick and easy to prepare. The only thing I had to change was to add a tablespoon of milk to the frosting - otherwise I just had a sticky powder. This is definitely a recipe I'm keeping on hand!"
"0","5","Wow - the ratings don't lie. These are amazing. It really is a perfect brownie. Only thing I changed: blended 2 Tbsp milk with frosting (to make it creamier) before frosting the brownies."
"0","5","Brilliant!!!!!!"
"0","5","Yum! They were gone in five minutes at the party! EVERYONE loved them!"
"0","5","These brownies were very good, although I did add some chocolate chips and some nuts. I ended up having to bake at least 10 minutes longer than stated in recipe, but that could just be my oven. I will be making these again for sure."
"0","5","Awesome! I made these for a bake sale at my daughter's school and turned out excellent, very moist. Next time I will add some pecans or walnuts. This recipe will definitely stay in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","5","Very quick and easy. The brownies turned out chewy and moist. I added a little bit of milk to the frosting until it was of easy spreading consistency and then spread it on the brownies about 10 minutes after taking them out. They turned out perfect! Everyone loved them!"
"0","4","I was looking for a recipe that would replace one that I accidentally threw out in a recent cleaning frenzy. This one is good but I like brownies that are more chocolatey (sp?) than these. These are a bit too sweet for me also."
"0","5","I made these last night while preparing dinner. These are the best brownies ever!!! I won't make box brownies ever again."
"0","5","Really yummy and easy! Served them at a small dinner party, and a few people had brought pastries from a gourmet pastry shop, and these were still everyone's favorite"
"0","5","I have made these 2 times, and they are the best!"
"0","5","These brownies are soooooooo good. I absolutely love them. Instead of honey, I used a little bit of corn syrup in the frosting."
"0","5","Tastes great!"
"0","4","It kinda gets alittle spongy like a cake, but it's still good!!"
"0","3","Se las he hecho a mi marido y le han gustado mucho. Eskerrik asko!"
"0","5","My sister made these for a recent family event. They were fabulous, not too cakey at all, and my little nieces and nephew loved them. This recipe is definitely a keeper."
"0","4","Too cakey for me... but they were good"
"0","5","Excellent! Everyone who tries these brownies, loves them! The frosting is delicious, but a bit difficult to work with. You definitely want to frost the brownies while they are still quite warm."
"0","5","These brownies really do always turn out! I've used this recipe more than once and I always get lots of compliments. They are moist, delicious, and around my family they are usually consumed in less then 15 minutes."
"0","5","these brownies are great! the second time i made them i added some peanut butter, and they were still excellent!"
"0","5","I added dark chocolate chips and walnuts and sprinkled with just confectioners sugar. They were great. Next time i will bake them with mint chips instead of chocolate chips!"
"0","5","Lucsious...much better than from the box...and with ingredients I always have on hand!"
"0","5","This recipe is great. I doubled the recipe for a family gathering and it still came out perfect. This is the best brownie yet."
"0","3","these were ok, a bit on the fudgy side. easy to make, but the frosting was a little heavy. my family liked them, maybe next time i'll make them w/o the frosting...."
"0","4","They were good, but a little too sweet, and it seemed like they were shallower and more rich than i'm used too--maybe I didn't do it right? I like the use of honey though. :)"
"0","5","The BOMB of the Brownie world! Unbelievably good...and they seem to come out a little different every time I make them."
"0","5","These brownies are great. For a faster frosting, just sprinkle the confectioners sugar after brownies have cooled. Yum."
"0","4","I thought these brownies were very good. After reading all the problems with the icing I didn't even bother with it; instead I looked up chocolate frosting (at All Recipes of course) and found a really great icing. Thanks"
"0","5","Really easy and so fudgy! I loved them, and will make them many more times in the future! The only complaint I had is that my frosting did not spread as easily as I would have liked... but the taste makes up for it!"
"0","5","Excellent brownies! I will be making this often. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
"0","5","These brownies taste wonderful! I made a batch to send to my cousin, but my husband tried his best to get me to let him have them instead. The brownies are moist and flavorful, but they are really thin...I think I may have used a 9' square pan instead of an 8' one. At any rate, this recipe is definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Mmm.. yummy! I made this recipe on the spur of the moment. Had all the ingredients on hand. Very quick and easy to make. Added about 1 TBSP of milk to the frosting to thin it. Was powdery without it. Definately try this recipe!!"
"0","5","My 13 year old daughter made this recipe by herself. It was fun, easy and delicious."
"0","5","This brownies were loved by all in my family and they were gone in no time! I didn't make the frosting and they were great."
"0","5","These *are* the best brownies. I sometimes make them before a road trip, then place them in the fridge overnight before we go. The brownie part is soft and just the right consisency, and the icing is so good I use it for other recipes!"
"0","4","Good brownie - a little cakier than I'd like, but I only seem to find the dense, fudgy ones out of a box!"
"0","5","These were great! I have made them twice and they turned out perfect both times! I added a bit of milk to the frosting and it was perfect, spread just fine. All I can say is YUMMY!"
"0","5","Thank you - I brought these brownies to a potluck and they were a big hit!"
"0","5","These were some of the best brownies I have ever had. I doubled the recipe and used a bigger pan. I may bake them slightly longer next time, if I do it the same way. The frosting has a very nice flavor. Chocolate lovers beware!"
"0","5","Really Good Brownies! Making the frosting is too much time, energy and mess for me! Jut get a couple of Hershey Bars and break them up. Put them on top of the brownies right out of the oven. When they start to melt spread the chocolate around. WOW! When they are still warm and gooey they are great! When the chocolate re-sets --they are still to die for!!"
"0","5","These brownies turned out amazing. I made sure not to over cook them so they are very moist. I had to cook a little longer as I made a double batch but both my 9x13 pans were being used. I put 1/2 the batter in and then sprinkled with semi sweet chocolate chips. I then added the rest of the batter and sprinkled more on top. The top is crunchy but once you cut through the top the inside is so moist."
"0","5","Ymmmmmmmmm! My family Loved them. Thank you soooo much for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","OMG! the best brownies ever..can we say 'i cant believe i ate the whole thing' definitely a keeper."
"0","5","These were really great brownies. I made a few changes: omitted the frosting, and replaced the vanilla extract with 1 tablespoon of Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur), also added 1/2 cup of chopped hazelnuts. Turned out really well!  PS: Or, try adding 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup Ghirardelli double chocolate chips to this recipe.. YUM."
"0","5","Oh yeah, that's the stuff, baby! The icing is like heaven...I double it so there will be enough left for the brownies after all the sampling! Soooo goooood!"
"0","5","These brownies were AMAZING! I brought them to a dinner party and people were begging for the recipe. I skipped the frosting and added 1 cup of white chocolate chips to the batter. Delicious!"
"0","5","THESE ARE BY FAR-------THE BEST BROWNIES I HAVE EVER EATEN----------THEY ARE SO MOIST AND DELICIOUS-----I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A GREAT AND QUICK BROWNIE RECIPE-------MY KID'S LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","mmm good stuff! Easy, quick and moist. If you add 1 T of milk to the frosting it turns out :)"
"0","5","These brownies were VERY good & easy to make; even my brother liked them! The only down-side was you could taste too much honey in the frosting, so next time I'll use adifferent recipe for that."
"0","5","these are my best and easiest-to-make brownies; comfort food for all times."
"0","5","Everybody in my household including visitors admitted that these are the best brownies in the world. No need for frosting anymore. Yum yum already."
"0","4","Good brownies but really really sweet."
"0","5","The brownies turned out wonderful! They were easy to make and delicious. I did not attempt the frosting, due to some reviews said it wasn't very good. I used a Chocolate Fudge Buttercream and my kids love it!"
"0","5","Loved these brownies! Yum!"
"0","5","Extremely yummy! Soft and chewy, and wonderfully chocolately. I had a hard time with the frosting, next time I would just skip it."
"0","5","These are the really THE BEST brownies! Even the when the batter's unbaked, it's still delicious. I add about 2 tablespoons (each) of ground up almonds and walnuts."
"0","4","My family and I just loved these brownies! The frosting might have been too much but they were still a BIG hit!"
"0","5","These brownies are very good!! However, the icing was VERY thick and did not spread - even when the brownies were hot. Luckily, the brownies taste so good by themselves you don't need the icing."
"0","5","Excellent; even better than Betty's!"
"0","5","This recipe was excellent! The brownies were so soft and moist, and the frosting was great. I added 1 cup of walnuts as well. When I baked it, I ate a quarter of the pan myself!"
"0","5","I make brownies often and this is one of the best recipes I've tried. Texture and flavor are good and it can't be much easier."
"0","5","These were a hit with my family. Sometimes I just dust them with powdered sugar instead of making the icing. I have made the icing twice, and for some reason it comes out a little grainy. I can't figure out why, but it tastes good. C. Lindsay Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"
"0","5","It's great I loved it!!!!"
"0","5","These are terrific!!!! Icing is great,too- try it! ( Is the butter supposed to be melted for the icing? Mine was just a tad lumpy, but I heated it in the microwave for 15 seconds & stirred it & it was fine.) This is now my favorite brownie recipe.Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","4","These brownies were good, but the frosting was really stiff, even with extra butter. I microwaved it for 60 seconds to get it to spreading consistancy. All in all, just average."
"0","5","I found this brownie recipe to be very similar in flavor to Pillsbury brand brownie mix. It was moist and chewy."
"0","5","These are yummy I took them to my work and they were gone quick"
"0","3","These brownies were good, but there are other recipes I've liked better-they were just kind of flat. Also, the frosting is completely unspreadable, especially on the warm soft brownies! Definately need to add milk to thin it out."
"0","4","These brownies were wonderful!!! I haven't had luck in past homemade brownie recipes but these came out perfect and oh the chocolate!"
"0","5","This recipe really was excellent. I added a cup and a half of chocolate chips and omitted the frosting and my family loved them!"
"0","4","My family really liked these but I felt they needed baking a little longer & next time will do so."
"0","5","WOW! This is the best Brownie I have ever made and eaten!! I have already made them three different times. Everyone tells me how wonderful they are...I have to agree! This is a keeper recipe!!( the frosting is a little thick..I thin it with milk or water)"
"0","5","A rare soy-free chocolate dessert. We make it regularly for birthday cakes."
"0","5","Sweet and really choclately. The best"
"0","5","These are wonderful- very fudgy! I microwaved the frosting 30 seconds and added a little milk to make it spreadable."
"0","5","This recipe is amazingly good! It tasted a little cakey at first but I left it overnight and it just got so fudgy!"
"0","5","Very yummy and buttery tasting! The frosting had a slight coconut flavor and I don't know why."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. Almost as easy as a box, but twice the taste. I microwaved the icing for 30 seconds and had no trouble at all with it being stiff. Will definately use this again, but will double, they just went to fast."
"0","5","Very yummy. LOVED the frosting. We gobbled them right up."
"0","4","I was never a lover of brownies, but I choose this recipes for my company's party because it was so highly rated. I had a couple of bite of it and thought that it was okay, but everyone else... they never stop asking me for the recipe."
"0","5","Wow- these were very good! The frosting was like a layer of fudge, very rich! I used 1 Tbsp of water in the frosting. A definate keeper."
"0","5","These are by far the best brownies I've ever eaten, hands down! I didn't make the frosting, instead I tossed in some walnuts and chocolate chips. They came out moist, fudgy and absolutely fabulous! I've made these twice this weekend and already they're begging for more! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!!"
"0","5","This is the best brownies I have ever tasted. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I did add some walnuts to the batter, and I found that the icing was a bit too stiff, so I substuted maple syrup for the honey and added 2 tbsp of cream.  Thankyou for such an awsome recipe"
"0","5","Bake them and let them set overnite!!! SUPERB!"
"0","5","I usually have a hard time finding recipes that will adapt to climate in different regions of the U.S. but this one one of the easiest most adaptable recipes I have ever tried. Thanks Angie for the recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is unbelievably good . . . over winter break, my dad made me make it three or four times in one week. They never lasted more than a day. They're very rich, very indulgent, VERY chocolate-y, really good fresh out of the oven with some cold milk. Tip to everyone having a problem with the thick icing: put it on the brownies when they're still warm --- the icing will melt to a glaze texture, then reharden. Very easy. I'll never go back to the box."
"0","4","These were very good brownies. They are slightly cakey but very moist. They are easy to make and have a good texture throughout."
"0","5","Made these to take to work, and several people commented that they were by far the best brownies they'd ever had. The batter doesn't look as dark as a box mix, so I was worried I didn't add enough cocoa. It's much darker after it bakes, though, and very fudgy. I made a double batch in a 9x12 and baked 30 minutes."
"0","5","What can i say but *Yum*?! All my flat think I'm a great baker now, especially when the American guy in our flat said these were great! I added pecans as I'm a big nut fan, I'd like to make orange ones next time, I can't wait!!"
"0","5","Growing up with my grandmother's brownies, loving to eat them, but not loving to make them, I was happily surprised by this deliciously quick, and easy recipe. The nicest part is that there is no clean up, and there is no way to mess this recipe up!!! go ahead indulge!!!!!!!!!"
"0","4","I made this a bit lower in fat without losing any taste by decreasing the margarine to 1/4 cup, and adding in a small jar of baby food prunes. The brownies were gone in a flash. Try it, you will be surprised."
"0","5","these were the best brownies I have ever had...I didn't even get to the frosting...my husband ate half the pan as soon as they came out! Forget boxes, this is our new favorite!! Many many stars...."
"0","5","Superb recipe! I've been trying out numerous brownie recipe, this is the best so far. My boyfriend is a chocoholic and is always complaining that my brownies aren't chocolaty enough, but with this one, he has no complaints. The frosting is a little too thick though, so i just thinned it out with a bit of milk. A must try.. YUMMY!!"
"0","5","These are the 'Best Brownies' ever! No need to buy a mix again or use any other recipe."
"0","5","I've made these brownies twice and they are delicious and very easy to make."
"0","5","I love this recipe. I've made these the last three days, and everyone wants more. the frosting is the best. Thank you Angie, these are so quick and good, it's unreal"
"0","5","Simple and divine!"
"0","5","This recipe is fabulous!! It was simple to make, turned out perfectly, and tasted absolutely delicioius!!"
"0","5","After reading so many wonderful reviews, I had to try these. These are soooooooo good. I did have to add a bit of milk to the frosting to thin it out, but that's all I had to change. I think we ate the whole pan in 2 days. And these are definitely better the first day. But you can warm them up in the microwave and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream - heavenly! Thanks for a delicious recipe that I'll be making again and again!"
"0","5","These are great brownies! Quick and easy. I added some nuts and a few chocolate chips and made them even better!!"
"0","5","Wow! what can i say! these were so good! YUM! im sixteen and made these for my family, they loved them! i think without the flour, it would be a great fudge recipe. but great as a brownie! i didnt need the icing!"
"0","5","Simple and excellent. I don't unerstand how anyone could screw this up!! I made a double batch, one for my neighbor, and one for my husband. I only used about half of the icing, so next time I will adjust for an 9x13' pan using icing for an 8x10. I will be making these again. Thanks Angie"
"0","5","I really liked the texture of these brownies. They weren't too gooey, or too cakey, or too fudgy. Pretty much they were the perfect combination of those qualities. I thought they were better than box mix also. Those usually have a chemical aftertaste. Also I usually have to chisel/ice pick the edges of any brownies I've ever made before. This was the first time for me that the edges were just as edible as the middle. That was a new & enjoyable experience! :o) Another reviewer mentioned the superiority of Hersheys cocoa powder over Nestles. I myself used Nestles (it's all I had) and I don't think Nestles is evil at all! :) In fact, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend using this recipe, Nestles & all! Go 'head! [note: I omitted the frosting because I didn't have any confectioners sugar on hand. I don't think I will even bother with the frosting anyways!]"
"0","5","(me being a bowl licker and all)In the begining I didn't exactly like the flavor of the batter, but after they were cooked I loved them! They were so moist and delicious that I decided to not even make the frosting!"
"0","5","We enjoyed this without the frosting and sprinkled powdered sugar on top for a pretty presentation. Very good, very easy! It's a keeper!"
"0","5","this is the best brownies i've ever make!!!! it's soooo delicious.. the best thing about this brownies is that they're chewy and fudgy..."
"0","5","The best I've ever made, why look any futher. I've passed this one down to all my friends. Thanks"
"0","5","We have this fun raising things in school(mostly for every occassion). I am always incharge, usually I make this brownies out of the recipe that my teacher gave me, but it's lost. I was browsing through the net and found this recipe. The great thing was that it turns out to be really good, PERFECTO!! My friends enjoy it, and every month they demand a box filled with brownies!"
"0","5","One you make these you'll need more...we couldn't keep out 'mitts' off of them. Even my husband (Mr. Boxed Brownies) loved them. This is a recipe you'll have for a on tim--print it off, you'll need it."
"0","5","They turned out really well. A little sweet for my taste, but still very good. I had to bake mine a little longer, very old oven. Great recipe!"
"0","4","it was kinda quick and easy"
"0","5","they really do turn out- and incredibly sweet and chocolaty without having to use chocolate at all."
"0","4","Left the honey out of icing. Icing got pretty stiff before I could spread it, but was still tasty!"
"0","5","These brownies were very good, however, the frosting was too sweet for my taste. I usually buuuy the brownie in a box, but it's nice to know how to make them from scratch, esp. since they are so easy."
"0","5","At first I was skeptical about strictly coco brownies but these were MARVELOUS!!!!! Everyone at the office raved! Perfect for fast- already in your pantry chocolate fix. 5 stars!"
"0","4","The frosting was very difficult to spread, but other than that the brownies were pretty good."
"0","5","I have to agree with everyone else - these are the best brownies I've ever made! I too, doubled the recipe and used Hershey's Dutched Processed cocoa. After 25 minutes in the oven, the brownies came out fudgy and delicious! I added a 'splash' of milk to the frosting and it came out smooth and creamy. I don't know if this made a difference, but after spreading the frosting on the brownies (while they were warm), I then covered them and put them in the refrigerator for a couple hours. To say they got 'rave reviews' is an understatement - I think there was even some 'jealousy' involved!! ;) Thanks for ending my brownie search!"
"0","5","My husband and son love it. :)"
"0","5","Doubled the batch and used 9X13 pan and added only 5 more minutes to baking time. Moist, sweet and chocolatey even without topping. DO NOT OVERCOOK. Very easy and so much better than the box."
"0","3","They were good, but the frosting didn't spread. I don't know if I did something wrong or not. Other than that they were pretty good. They also stuck in the pan."
"0","5","Sooo tasty, the best brownies I've ever made!"
"0","3","My family and I were not impressed with these brownies. I threw away half of them. They tasted like a box brownie mix, not at all as good as my usual homemade brownies. Although, they were easy and use ingredients that most people have on hand. They are okay if you are in a hurry."
"0","4","These brownies weren't the 'best' as its title proudly proclaims but they were good. Slightly on the rich side, though. These are nice, basic brownies if you don't want to fool around and just want brownies."
"0","5","These are the BEST brownies! Nice and gooey! Anyone who says these are not moist enough or that they are too cakey, have definately over-cooked them. Great once cooled, but much, much better the next day. Thanks!"
"0","5","Everyone at work loved them!"
"0","5","I made these without the frosting, as I didnt have some of the ingredients for it on hand, but that didnt matter. These brownies were fantastic alone. I think next time I may mix some orange zest into the batter to give it a wee bit of original flavor. Great recipe!"
"0","5","These were great -- I baked them by spreading half the batter in the pan, and then spreading a thin layer of raspberry jam on top, and then pouring on the rest of the batter -- it turned out wonderfully!"
"0","5","All of the ease of a box mix but with a better taste. Definitely better the next day!"
"0","5","This was my first'not from a box' brownies. They tuned out perfect.(to my surprise)I topped them with a cream cheese frosting. THat may have made them too rich. They are soooooo sweet. Get a gallon of whole milk and sit back because you can't eat just one."
"0","4","Good taste, not as moist as I would have liked, but overall good. Very quick to  make."
"0","4","It's too sweet and too cakey for my taste."
"0","5","Double the recipe, add chopped walnuts (about a cup)! Also, sprinkle chopped walnuts on the icing before it dries. Excellent recipe!"
"0","5","Way glad to of found this recipe, batter then any store bought I have ever tasted, my family cleaned them up so fast I had to hurry and get some, Thanks Jerry"
"0","5","I have made loads of brownies before, but these are by far the best. I did wait the day and it was worth it. They disappeared so quickly that I only had two. I guess it's time to make another batch!"
"0","5","These were the most scrumptious brownies! Definately worth the day wait. Yummy!"
"0","5","Wow! I just wanted to make a treat real quick, but didn't have much on hand. These were perfect! I have never had brownies turn out as good as these did. I did them w/o the frosting, but a lot of people said to wait a day to eat them...I just couldnt wait! I waited a few hours, and they were still just a delicious!! :)"
"0","5","All I can say is: ...mmm...mmm...Good! These brownies are the best, just like th recipe says! They are quick and easy to fix and oh-so-good!"
"0","5","Excellent brownies! I did follow everyone's advice and waited a day after baking them. They were absolutely delicious!! No need to look for another recipe. This is the one! I made them with the frosting which I thought would be too sweet, but excellent!"
"0","5","Yesterday afternoon, I think I read every brownie recipe this site has. I read all the reviews too. It took me so long to decide which one to make that by the time they were made and out of the oven, we were having dessert that was still warm. I've never had brownies so good. I didn't make the frosting/topping. I threw in a handful of chocolate chips when I was mixing them. OMG, they were soooo good. I served them warm with ice cream and chocolate sauce drizzled over them. I put it in 8x8 pan and there's...lemme see....none left. Ha!"
"0","3","Everyone who tried these said they were WAY to sweet. Well, everyone except my brother. He LOVED them! Different strokes for different folks..."
"0","5","easy to prepare and they taste great!!"
"0","5","One of the easiest to make and clean up I have ever made. They taste wonderful and this will become a family favorite."
"0","5","These tasted really good. They were a little harder to make because I had to double the recipe. (I needed to make treats for a group of people.) It also took a little while longer than I'd thought to cook them. Be careful not to cook them too long."
"0","4","These are the best brownies so far. A little dry, I am going to try it with brown sugar next time. Also I had to add a few drops of water to the icing. Make sure to ice when the brownies are still hot. The family ate them all up in one evening. I will definately make them again."
"0","5","These brownies were a hit at my husbands job and with my son. I did leave out the frosting though, personally I think that frosting on brownies are best when you have a crowd of PMSing females. :) I will be making these again and again. Thanks Angie!!"
"0","5","wonderfully chewy and fudgy, however i found these to be a bit sweet. next time i plan on reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup. i added chocolate chips and they turned out great!"
"0","5","A really easy, pleasing brownie. The pan disappears very quickly at our home! Irene J."
"0","5","I made these as part of my Chirsmas cookie batch and received soooo many compliments. The icing was a liittle tricky though. The icing truly needs to be thinned out so that you don't take of the top of the brownie as you spread it on top."
"0","5","Not bad. Certainly not fudgy, but they are chewy. The frosting was terribly cloying, though. I might make them again, although they don't satisfy the desire for a sinfully rich and fudgy brownie.  Addendum: Well, I ate some more of these this morning, the day after they had been made and they were SO MUCH BETTER! The icing didn't taste overly sweet and it had kind of melded with the brownies. Quite tasty! Also, the honey flavor in the frosting (which I hadn't really cared for) disappeared."
"0","5","These turned out very well. I opted to skip the frosting. These contain a lot of sugar but I received many compliments on them!"
"0","4","great recipe, but didn't need the frosting."
"0","5","i Don't know if kids love it but whenever i make a batch, my husband devours them! Adding nuts makes them even better!"
"0","5","really good with butterscotch chips!"
"0","5","This is the BEST and easiest brownie recipe! They taste absolutely wonderful!"
"0","5","all time best brownies I ever made, just make sure to ice when hot"
"0","3","Boy was I disappointed! These are good brownies, but certainly not 'the best' that I've ever had. My fiancee wouldn't even go near them!!"
"0","2","a little dry"
"0","5","The brownies were wonderful and are the best I have had in some time, but the frosting was not to my taste so I left it off."
"0","4","This recipe is good, but there are so many similar brownie recipes that are just as easy and tasty. When reading the reviews, I thought that this was going to be something out of this world. I have found that any brownie recipe that is put together on top of the stove all in one pot always comes out this way."
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe. Very easy. I added about 1/4 c of chopped walnuts cause to me it isn't a brownie without nuts. The icing was just a bit thick so I added a tsp. of water to it. The pan was gone in half a day!"
"0","5","We like this one. We baked them in mini muffin tins and that makes them great for lunches. Thanks"
"0","3","They were really easy to make and the recipe was easy to follow, however they were a cake-ish for my taste. I prefer a chewier brownie."
"0","4","I had made these brownies for my boyfriend and roommate and his girlfriend. Everyone who had tried them had stated that they were top notch. I am not even a chocolate lover but I really enjoyed them."
"0","5","awesome recipe! I cut the recipe in half for a small serving, and still came out!"
"0","5","These are truly the best brownies I have ever tasted. They are also quick to make. I didn't used frosting, I just sifted icing sugar over them. Yum!!"
"0","5","So chewy! So good! EXCELLENT!"
"0","5","I was skeptical at first about the rave reviews but these really are awesome! I'm not much of a frosting person so I just sprinkled powered sugar on top and they were so delicious. So much for my diet."
