"2751","5","Fail-proof. I followed the directions and everything turned out perfectly. ADVICE: freeze (or put in fridge) unwrapped PB cups - it is easier to press the frozen candy into the hot cookie without falling to pieces. SUPERB!"
"1556","5","WOW! Fantastic Recipe!  Made a single batch to try it out exactly as it was printed.   Some Key Tricks I Used: **Make dough, and pop into refrigerator for about an hour--it makes cookies easier to scoop. **I used the smallest cookie scoop I had (approx 2 tsp) and levelled off the bottom (so I had exact size balls (With flattened ends!) **I scooped the first batch into the mini muffin tin...and while that batch baked, I scooped the rest of the dough onto a plate--that way I could quickly refill the pan once cooled (I have asked Santa for an extra pan for Christmas--It would be good to make more than 12 at a time!!!) **Freeze PB Cups, unwrap, then pop back into freezer--until cookies are out of oven. **Allow middles to 'sink' a bit before adding the pb cup(should happen when removed from the oven after 8 minutes) the 'sink' will prevent the sides of the cookie from cracking. **ABSOLUTELY refrigerate the pan before removing cookies for cooling rack... BUT **Decorate with sprinkles BEFORE refrigerating pan--place decor quickly, as the chocolate will start to melt. Shifting placement of the decorations will be tricky! **Once cooled...HIDE from husband, kids, neighbours...they disappear faster than you can make 'em!  Great recipe!"
"838","3","I'm not sure where I went wrong, but it most have been me because all of the other reviews don't mention the cookies cracking. I used a regular muffin tin, ungreased. The balls stayed as balls, no spreading. When I took them out at 8 mins. and pressed the frozen p-nutbutter cup in, the cookies edges cracked and seperated. Any suggestions?"
"478","4","These were pretty good. One thing I can say is that they dont look like they're done cooking after 8 minutes, but they are. Dont make the mistake of overbaking them."
"416","5","5 Stars!  I used my husband's sugary 'Skippy' Peanut Butter. Also used a cookie sheet insted of a muffin pan, and cookies turned out perfect.  EASY TO MAKE.   DELICIOUS. Everyone raved about them, even people who normally didn't like peanut butter.  INGREDIENTS AND TIMING ARE PERFECT. I wouldn't suggest changing a thing. I thought that they were not done at first, and was tempted to leave them in longer, but the cook time was perfect.  LONGEVITY/FRESHNESS. The cookies stayed fresh and soft for quite awhile in the cookie tins they were in.   OVERALL, an excellent recipe that I will be making and sharing every Christmas, for years to come!"
"286","5","I made these for my Christmas Party and they were a hit! I doubled the recipe and came out with 72 cookies. I would recommend popping the trays into the refrigerator after you place the candy cups in the cookies. If you don't, the chocolate centers keep melting and it takes longer for them to cool and store. Easy to remove from the tray and small enough to fit many on a serving tray. I will definitely make these again."
"205","5","These are great! My husband has pretty much polished them off in 2 days by himself, I will have to make a couple more batches for the christmas tins. One hint, I didn't know how big to make the balls of dough, to get 40 cookies, make them about 3/4 inch in diameter."
"179","5","I used whole wheat white flour (it's lighter in texture and naturally sweeter than regular whole wheat) and all natural PB. Husband couldn't tell these cookies were 100% whole grain and gobbled them right up. I chilled the dough for a few hours, and instead of forming balls, I just used a medium cookie scoop to get uniform-sized rounded mounds in the fraction of the time. I dropped the mounds into regular muffin tins because that's all I had, but they still came out looking great. I did have to cook them 3 min longer though because I made them larger than what the recipe called for. Don't make the mistake of cooking them too long (recipe is right on unless you make your cookies bigger). The dough should be soft when you take it out. The first time I made this, I baked them too long (waited for them to turn golden), and they were dry."
"159","5","These cookies were EXCELLENT! i test most of my recipies on my sister and my boyfriend and they both LOVED THEM! They both keep begging me to make more. i followed the recipe exactly, however instead of putting the batter into muffin cups i simply rounded the dough and put them on the cookie sheet and pressed the reeses cups into them immediatly after taking them out of the oven! worked extremely well! LOVE IT:)"
"125","5","By far THE BEST cookie!!! If you like peanut butter, if you like chocolate, if you just like sweets period this cookie is for you!! The dough is just soo chewy and perfect and the peanut butter cup just tops it off!! I did however have to bake the cookie 10 minutes and not 8. I also didn't have a mini muffin pan and I forgot to buy the mini cupcake paper so I just had to use my baking sheet! Still came out great! This is one I will DEFINATELY be making over and over again!"
"47","5","I make these almost every year and they are a big hit with the family and with the office. Also try them with the white chocolate peanut butter cups ? very yummy! Most of the time I don't make them in the muffin cups, I use the muffin liners and just line them up on a cookie sheet (you can get tons on there) and drop a ball of dough into each. This works great and I love the presentation for office/family parties. The muffin papers will keep the cookie together so that it doesn't spread out too far. Also to the reviewer who had sticky dough, sometimes too soft butter or too much liquid can cause sticky dough. Usually add flour, 1 tbsp at a time and/or put dough in fridge to firm up a bit. ???? LOVE these cookies ????"
"40","5","I haven't baked since I was 5 years old and the only thing I remeber doing is licking the batter. I made these today and they are SUPER EASY - even for the non-baker. A few tips: (1) definitely unwrap the candy first and place it in the freezer because it's easier to push in. (2) use Pam Flour spray so the cookies don't stick - once they've cooled, use a spoon to pop them out. (3) put festive sprinkles on top depending on the holiday - use a spoon to sprinkle them off while still hot and then do a gentle press with the back of the spoon to make sure they melt in. (4) don't skimp on not getting the mini muffin trays - I thought about it but you really do need them. The 8 minute baking time was right on for me. Enjoy!"
"35","5","These cookies look good and I had no problem getting them out of the pan, I purchased the mini-muffin pans to make them. I will use a regular peanut butter cookie recipe next time I make them because we enjoy more of a peanut butter flavor and it just wasn't there, other than that great recipe, pretty cookie and thank you for sharing! Just to update: I now use a recipe for peanut butter cookies that has 1 cup of peanut butter in it and it made these just perfectly for pb lovers like myself!"
"30","5","Just like everyone else stated, these came out great for me. So easy and quick to make. I used crunchy pb and it was yummy. I stuck exactly to the 8-minute cooking time and it was perfect. Also, it made more than 40 for me (I was using a small scoop) so when I ran out of PB Cups I used Hershey's Kisses that I had and pushed them in upside-down to create a perfect round chocolate center. I decorated them with red and green royal icing and sprinkles for Xmas and they were perfect little holiday treats! Oh yeah, freeze your pb cups before and after opening (while you wait for the cookies to bake). Then take the cookies out of the oven, pop the chocolates in, and throw the whole pan back in the freezer for 3-5 mins to keep the chocolates from melting, then remove from the pan. I cooled mine in the freezer as well for quick-cooling so I could decorate. Good luck!"
"30","4","These are great cookies that are super easy to make! I didnt worry about actually rolling the dough into balls since the dough got super sticky on my hands. So instead I just spooned the dough into the mini cupcake pans, and they turned out just fine! One note: you really do need to work fast to place the PB cups into the dough when finished, and definitely let these cookies cool COMPLETELY before removing them from the pans. If you dont, the PB cups start running and melting all over the side of the cookie."
"26","5","Wonderful cookie. Found them easier to remove if you chilled them in the fridge."
"25","5","I made these today for a back-to-school luncheon. It took me a little bit to figure it all out. First, I froze the peanut butter cups. I used Reese's and Wal-Mart brand peanut butter cups. (The Wal-mart brand was gooier and didn't look as pretty, but it tasted 5 times better to me.) I baked them for 7 minutes. I pushed in the frozen peanut butter cups. Then, I put the whole pan in the freezer for about 7 minutes. Then, I used a serrated knife to pop them out of the mini-muffin tin. They are very scrumptious!"
"23","5","This recipe is wonderful! The cookie part was soft & chewy and kept well. The peanut butter cups pushed right in so the cookies almost looked like little tarts. Everyone raved about these!"
"21","5","Kids love these!"
"20","5","Very good! My husband's favorite. Made a huge batch of these for my wedding. They went like hotcakes!"
"19","5","These cookies are amazing! I made them this past Christmas, needless to say after eating a few of them after they came out of the oven they didn't make it out of our house...we decided to keep these yummy treats for ourselves :-P I have since made them again to share with friends and family and everyone loves them. I have found that I prefer to use Trader Joe's milk chocolate peanut butter cups over Reese's as they are creamier and contain more peanut butter. I will making these cookies often, thanks for sharing such a great recipe!"
"19","5","I actually used Hershey Kisses rather than the peanut butter cups and WOW these cookies were great!! Huge hit at a holiday party!!"
"19","5","A dear friend gave me this recipe about 15 years ago. My recipe is the same except I use 1 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I use margarine instead of butter. All the rest is the same. I use creamy peanut butter and Reese's mini peanut butter cups. Instead of greasing my mini muffin pan, I use the small mini cupcake paper liners and it works great and makes it attractive and easy to serve I make these at Christmas but are good year round, it is a favorite with all who has had them and are requested every year. My son's friend said he would pay me to make him some!!! Thanks!"
"19","5","I made these over the weekend and they lasted less than ine day. My teenagers DEVOURED them and I had to hide a couple for myself. DELICIOUS!!"
"19","5","Peanut Butter junkies these are for you! The best cookie I ever tasted!"
"19","5","THESE COOKIES ARE VERY GOOD. THEY ARE THE PERFECT PLEASER FOR PEANUT BUTTER LOVERS. THEY ARE SO SMALL AND CUTE LOOKING THAT EVERYONE GRABS THEM FIRST FROM THE COOKIE TRAY . VERY GOOD RECIPE"
"18","5","Very good cookies! I took them to work and everybody was very impressed.They look very nice but are very quick and easy to make (what took longest was unwrapping all the candies!) I also  used the tiny snickers bars and hershey's hugs for the centers - it was nice for variety, but the peanut butter cup centers are my personal favorite. :)"
"18","5","If you like peanut butter cookies and peanut butter cups you'll love this cookie. Really like them chilled w/ a tall glass of milk. Mmm!"
"17","4","These cookies turned out pretty good. I was disappointed they were fairly crumbley but they tasted good"
"17","5","These are very good. Kids will love them."
"17","5","if you love peanut butter, you'll love these!!"
"17","5","Made these many times. Everyone loves them!"
"16","5","These cookies are to die for! Completely rich with peanut butter taste. The only difficulty I had was rolling the batter into balls. They were quite sticky so I opted to scoop them out using a tablespoon. They still came out perfect and delicious. My batch created 25 cookies instead of 40 (I used a regular muffin pan). This is a keeper. Thanks! - Stephanie"
"15","5","Love these. I also cheated and used refrigerated cookie dough. I brought them to work and found people sneaking into the break room for more....I also used the paper muffin liners making clean up much easier."
"15","5","My mom used to make these and they are great! You can use mini cupcake tins and give them as gifts. You can also shorten prep time and buy premade peanut butter cookie dough, cut each slice into quarters, place a quarter in your tin, and mash the peanut butter cup inside. They come out the same with less time!"
"15","5","Excellent Cookie!! These are the first to go."
"15","5","My family couldn't get enough of these cookies."
"14","5","5 stars for the cutest little cookies. I had a bag of 40 miniature peanut butter cups and they went perfectly with this recipe. I used Skippy (creamy) Peanut Butter. I did not really know how to roll the dough into 40 mini balls for the mini muffin pans and I ended up with 32. Nonetheless, these are the cutest tastiest little cookies and I couldn't help tasting the raw batter while rolling them into balls. lol. yum! I made sure to refrigerate the mini peanut butter cups so that when I pressed them into the cookies they would set well. Don't be alarmed if the cookies do not look like they are done at 8 minutes. The timing is approximate so just take them out of the oven. Press one chilled mini peanut butter cup into the center of each cookie. While pressing the mini peanut butter cups into each cookie, the cookie itself will appear raw and soft (slightly giving), don't worry it is ok. They might even 'sink' as you press the mini peanut butter cup inside. The mini peanut butter cup will melt and set inside the cookie. After you're done putting mini peanut butter cups into each ball, just allow all the cookies to cool down completely before you take them out from the mini muffin pans. OR what you can do is take the advice of one reviewer and refrigerate them before you take them out. Next time I need to make sure to roll these into smaller balls to make 40 cookie cups or invest in a small scoop. I will definitely make these again! Hope this helps other bakers!"
"14","5","Love these. Chilled dough for an hour. Then scooped into small golf ball size. Put in regular size muffin tin (cuz I don't have the small ones) Baked 6min. 30 sec. pulled out and pressed a chilled peanut butter cup into each hot cookie. Chill in pan before you try to remove cookie from pan. I got 36 cookies out of my batch. Thanks for sharing :)"
"14","4","I tried this recipte last night to bring into the office....I was very pleased. I love peanut butter and theses definitely fulfill that graving. Extremely easy and quick to make. When I wasn't using the dough I chilled it in the fridge, which made it easier to work with. I also ended up putting the cookies on a dish and placed them in the fridge to chill the chocolate, you have to be very careful when taking them out of the pan!!!! I would recommend chilling them...it helps. They are awesome!!!"
"14","5","the best peanut butter cookie i've ever ate"
"13","5","Best peanut butter cookies i've ever made. People thought they were store bought. Delicious!"
"13","5","Very good tasting. The batter it self is so good, you'll have a hard time not to keep on 'tasting' it. The cookies made with a mini muffin pan look like they are dainty and would be good for a party. The cookies made with a regular size muffin pan are very good, too. They just don't look as 'pretty'. Thanks for the recipe!"
"12","5","Excellent! Easy to make too."
"12","5","My family loved these! You can bake them on a regular ol' cookie sheet too."
"12","5","Excellent! Next time I will use mini paper liners, because I had a heck of a time getting these out of the pan. Extremely difficult to eat just one..."
"12","5","These cookies are great! Officially my boyfriend's favourite. I am definitely holding on to this recipe, thanks!"
"12","2","Not impressed. They turned out - nothing was wrong - I just have had much better cookies with peanut butter cups. I'm surprised they are rated so high."
"12","5","How could these not be good? They were delish, but not quite what I was expecting. When you use the mini muffin tin they are more like little cupcakes or muffins and less like cookies. In fact, you don't really need the muffin tin at all, you could just form the dough into balls and bake on a cookie sheet. They are yummy either way, and super easy!! MUCH easier when you refrigerate the dough and also the peanut butter cups."
"12","5","These will be a cute addition to the cookie tray. Followed exactly and they turned out great. Wasn't sure about not greasing the tins but it wasn't a problem. I used my small Pampered Chef scoop and it made 55 cookies."
"12","5","I made these delicious cookies to give as gifts and my husband has eaten them all! They are better than I thought."
"11","3","We make this recipe but with chocolate chip cookie dough. It is so good this way. My family loves it. Buy store bought dough and keep it simple"
"11","5","These were excellent! So chewy and soft. I am not a chocolate lover, so I was looking for an alternative to peanut blossoms (topped with a hershey kiss). These were great! Just a little chocolate with tons of yummy peanut butter!"
"11","5","Everyone RAVED about these. Make sure the cookies are not undercooked which will make them impossible to remove from the muffin tray. Also, make sure they are cooled completely before removing."
"11","5","Awesome cookie for all those peanut butter lovers out there!"
"11","5","YUM!"
"11","5","Just as recipe states! Perfect and soft. Did make sure to freeze the cups before pressing them into cookie. Unwrapped and stuck in freezer while I made the dough!"
"11","5","Basically the best thing ever. No need to change a thing"
"11","5","sweet and easy"
"11","5","This recipe is right on! To avoid cracking, do not press the Reese's too far down (or using too much pressure). Because the Reese's are chocolate, after a few minutes they will melt a little and 'set in place' a bit better. Be careful taking them off of the pan if they haven't completely cooled, as this may be another way the cookie may break. Most of all- enjoy the experience of cooking and enjoy the fruits of your efforts!"
"11","5","I COULDN'T FIND MY MINI MUFFIN PAN SO I USED MINI CUPCAKE WRAPPERS WHICH WORKED GREAT!! ALSO-MY HUSBAND ATE SOME OF MY REESES SO I CUT THEM IN HALF AND PUT THEM IN RIDGED SIDE UP-THEY LOOKED LIKE CROWNS-VERY PRETTY AND DELICIOUS"
"11","5","Wonderful!!! I followed the advice of others. I waited a few minutes before putting the peanut butter cups in and I put the pan in the fridge right away. I didn't have a small cookie scoop and the first batch of 24 was a little small. That made it harder to get the pb cup in without cracking the edge. The 8 minutes baking was perfect. Great recipe!"
"10","5","Yummy! Everyone loved them, I followed the recipe as is but put the cups in the freezer to get hard before pressing them into the cookie, it really does help."
"10","5","Couldnt be simpler. I too put my Reese cups in the fridge to chill before pressing them into the hot dough. I also doubled the recipe and used my smallest cookie scoop."
"10","5","These were awesome & fairly simple to make. We made a double batch for Christmas dinner & they were ALL gone!"
"10","5","This is a great recipe and they looked delicious."
"10","5","These were great. Only change I would make is to double the recipe."
"10","5","yummy! The cookies will crack some, no big deal. I put a pecan 1/2 on each one and that made them pretty AND tasted better with the crunch!"
"10","5","Follow the recipe EXACTLY to get these to turn out perfectly. Also, try the dark chocolate, and white chocolate peanut butter cups for variation. Man I could eat my weight in these cookies."
"10","5","Had to cook them a little longer because the first batch came out raw but my husband said they were better that way."
"10","5","Easy and turned out great!"
"10","5","After a few tries, I got this cookie right-you really need a mini muffin pan. I tried this on both a cookie sheet and a regular sized muffin pan and the cookies did not look as nice. The cookies are great and were a hit at many holiday parties!"
"10","5","These cookies are great! They are very easy to make and everyone loves them. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out perfect!"
"10","5","These turned out PERFECTLY!!! It's been years since I've baked cookies and this was definitely a good recipe for a novice cookie maker like myself. I followed some of the additional instructions in other comments, like freezing the peanut butter cups. Also, I must concur that the 8 minute bake time is PERFECT. I made about 3 dozen because I only ended up with 37 peanut butter cups in my bag. Each ball was measure out to be approx 1 tbsp, as I used my measure spoon to scoop out the dough. There was enough dough left over to make another dozen plain ol' peanut butter cookies. Long story short, this is just a great recipe!!!"
"10","5","I made these exactly like the recipe. They were soft and chewy. My entire family was impressed. I will make these often."
"10","4","I made these at Christmas for my family. Followed the recipe exactly. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the cookie wasn't as sweet as I would have liked. Next time I will add a bit more sugar. I would recommend that you keep the chocolate candies unwrapped in the fridge until ready to use and then as soon as you put them into the cookies put the entire tray into the freezer for about 2 or 3 minutes so the candy doesn't continue to melt and make a mess."
"10","5","Amazing! Everyone at our Christmas gathering LOVED these cookies! You can't lose with these yummy little cookies!"
"10","5","I call these blossoms....best ever. Everyone in our family always begs for peanut butter balls but were happy with these & so easy to make. I made no changes to original recipe."
"10","5","Wonderful cookies. I had a hard time keeping them everyone wanted more. These will definitely be on our Christmas cookie list each year. Plus during the year. Our faimly loves peanuts and peanut butter. I used chunky peanut butter."
"10","5","Excellent and simple cookie. My husband can't have chocolate so I used white peanut butter cups. They disappeared, FAST!"
"10","5","One of my new favorite cookie recipes! So easy, my husband (a non-baker) mixed up the batch and I helped him roll into ball. Make sure all candies are unwrapped and ready to place into the cooked cookie. The sooner you can push them into the cookie, the better!"
"10","5","These were great!! I thought I'd try these instead of my old recipe I had that uses shortening instead of butter. I actually got 48 cookies out of this recipe, and I followed the recipe exact. I used my Pampered Chef small scoop to put the dough in the little muffin cups and my Pampered Chef wooden dowel to 'stamp' stamp the middle...I just caution, I stamped some too thin and the rim of the cookie pulled off when I tried to pop the cookie out of the cup. The flavor of these is great...and just a side note...it looks like Reese's is making the minature peanut butter cups even smaller!!"
"10","2","I don't know how I could be the only one to have trouble with this?? I could NOT get these cookies out of the pan. I had to pry and pull and shove things between the cookie and the pan, that by the time anything came out... it was ruined... I am so bummed- my whole family loves reeces :("
"10","5","I just finished making 5 batches. I came out with 250 cookies. They turned out great! Taking them to a cookie swap. I followed the recipe to a tee. I did take everyones advise on freezing the reeses first. Great Recipe!"
"10","5","Yummy! This was my first attempt at these cookies and they turned out perfectly! The only changes I made were the 2 tsp. vanilla as recommended by other reviewers, as well as extra flour (I was not quite 2 and 3/4 cups). I used two different colored mini muffin pans (light and dark coated) and both cooked equally well. 8 minutes exactly is what I did. I also did freeze the pb cups first and took them out and unwrapped them just prior to the cookies coming out. As far as waiting for the cookies to sink a bit before putting the pb cups in, I did both. I found that there was less cracking the sooner I put them in. But they do start to sink pretty quickly anyway, so I'm not sure that matters too much. And ABSOLUTELY put the whole pan in the freezer as soon as you out the cups in the cookies. This helps keep the chocolate from melting too much at the bottom of the pb cup, as well as makes it easier to get them out of the pan. You still have to be careful. The cookie may crumble a tiny bit around the edges, so use a very small thin knife or a spoon (just the edge to coax them out). They all came out beautifully. Balls were 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter. Very easy and delicious!"
"10","5","Really good. Next time, I will be a thumbprint in the middle of the dough ball before cooking so that the peanut butter cup will fit into the cooke better. I followed other reviewers advice and froze the peanut butter cups before putting into the cookie and also refrigerated the cookies after adding the pb cups to prevent them from melting too much."
"10","1","Every time I make these, they disappear nearly immediately."
"10","5","These were really GOOD. Kids loved them!"
"10","5","These were so good! And so easy to make."
"9","5","I make this exactly as posted, with the only exception being that I do throw the peanut butter cups in the freezer and take them out when the cookies come out of the oven. These are requested more than any other recipe I've made, and are almost always the first thing gone, no matter what else is on the table. My words of advice to anyone who asks me for the recipe--only use GOOD mini muffin pans. The first time I made these, they stuck to the pan I used. I bought good pans and haven't had any problem whatsoever with cookies sticking."
"9","5","These are great. I also mixed them up a bit. I made some with banana some with chunky peanut butter. I even made some with jelly inside. I used my meat marinade syringe filled with my favorite preserve, and pumped them with about 1 tsp. Great for kids and adults alike. FIVE STARS!!"
"9","5","Family absolutely loved these cookies. Freezing the PB cups and referigerating the dough definitely helped."
"9","5","These were Great!! Chilled the dough for 30 minutes and froze the candy, turned out perfect!"
"9","5","Great, easy cookies! I used a regular muffin pan because I did not have a mini muffin pan, and they still turned out great. I followed the advice of others and put the reese's cups in the freezer, and the dough in the fridge."
"9","5","Recipe is AWESOME!!! And even better they recently came out with mini pb cups bags of unwrapped ones omg perfect!!!!! I like making both big and small and the freezing them first works like a charm but you dont have to do it overnight or anything a couple hours is fine."
"9","5","Fantastic recipe. A hit in my home. I can't wait to make them again. Thanks!"
"9","4","These taste mostly peanut buttery. If you want a true chocolate peanut butter cookie use a chocolate kiss in the center."
"9","5","Simplify the recipe by buying pre-made cookie dough!!!! I brought peanut butter cookie dough from the flour, sugar, brownie aisle at the grocery store...taste the same"
"9","5","Family loved these..... i followed the recipe exactly and everything came out great."
"9","5","oh my gosh... delish!!! I made these twice, and they turned out awesome!!! We used pb cups, and also used mint cups and caramel cups as well... all were eaten quickly.. and were very very good :D"
"9","5","AWESOME!! I followed the recipe and pressed the frozen cups in the middle. Definitely let them cool completely (cups included) before moving them!"
"9","5","love this recipe"
"9","5","OMG these were deelish! First time I didn't have PB so I used raw almond butter and loved it. The 2nd time I used creamy PB and dark choc PB cups - again, devine! Both times they went VERY quickly. Next time I will do the raw almond butter with the dark choc cups, and probably less white sugar as the cups lend much sweetness by themselves. Tnx for a super easy and tasty recipe :o)"
"9","5","THESE WERE SO GOOD, THEY DID NOT LAST LONG ON THE COFFEE TABLE"
"9","5","My absolute favorite cookie and my go to for holiday cookies!!! Great recipe!!"
"9","5","Came out great!! Rich and delicious!"
"9","5","Very good! Perfect peanut butter cookie recipe. Works great for hershey kiss cookies too."
"9","5","Perfect. I made this exactly as the recipe stated. Tip: unwrap the pb cups and put them in the fridge while the cookies are baking."
"9","5","Can't say enough good things about these cookies! They are yummy, easy and everyone loved them. Made them for Thanksgiving, we had an 8 hours drive and my husband and I ate almost all of them before we got there!"
"9","4","Great recipe. I didn't have the mini muffin tin, so I just used a cookie sheet. Still turned out great. Has a strong peanut butter taste, which I love. The peanut butter cup center is a real nice added touch."
"9","5","Huge hit in my house. And so easy and fun for my 8 and 4 yr old to make. Delicious!"
"9","5","I made these the other day and they were a big hit with the family! A quick, easy recipe that will definitely satisfy any person's chocolate/peanut butter craving..*NOTE - I did follow others' advice to freeze the peanut butter cups before placing them into the cookies..This keeps the candy from completely melting and reduces the cooling time so the cookies can be stored.."
"9","5","Delicious, easy to prepare-- this will be a regular recipe for my holiday baking. I don't understand the aversion people have to using paper liners in the muffin pans, whether regular -sized or mini. I use them regularly, and did so for this recipe. No problem with removing the cookie (or cupcake, muffin) from the pan, no cooked-on batter to scrub off. Everyone I served the cookies to thought the paper liners were a good idea. I agree that freezing and unwrapping the p.b. cups ahead of baking is best---much easier to handle them this way. I also wore a pair of disposable plastic gloves to make the cookie dough balls. I'll definitely make a double batch next year!"
"9","5","I'm in love with these! Like another reviewer states, you must let these cool off (stick in the freezer) before attempting to take them out of the pan, otherwise you will have a mess! I was a little apprehensive about not greasing the pan, but it worked! These cookies turned out soft and delicious! My new favorite."
"9","5","these cookies were amazing! I tried them substituting the peanut butter for more reg butter and adding cocoa powder to the cookie dough then using mint chocolate cups and they were a big hit!!!"
"9","5","Great cookies! I followed another reviewer's advice and froze the peanut butter cups, and the cookies came out perfectly."
"9","5","Yummo goodness! I followed other recommendations and froze the PB cups and only cooked for 8 minutes. Came out perfect!"
"8","5","These were a huge hit with my husband and our friends. I've made them twice now and had to make the following changes to make them work:  1. Freeze the peanut butter cups, don't just refrigerate them, before putting them into the cookies. 2. DO spray the muffin pan - mine stuck terribly when I didn't."
"8","5","Very Very yummy!! Few things i did differnt, I kept the reese cups in the fridge overnight, After i got the cookie dough ready I put it in the fridge While i unwrapped all the pb cups, After that I put the pb cups back into the fridge and pulled out the cookie dough Used a cookie scoop and scooped out the balls. I didnt have a mini muffin pan So i just used a flat cookie sheet lined with foil. I only got 20 cookies. I baked them 8 mins 30 secs. They didnt look done But i listened to other reviewers and didnt cook them any longer. I immediatly pressed the pb cups into the cookies and then removed the foil with cookies on top. To a wire rack So they could cool faster by not being on the hot cookie sheet. Let them cool for quite awhile. They are SUPER GOOD Everyone loves them!! I saved the recipe and will be making them again."
"8","5","OK this recipe was awesome I made this for my family they loved it. Me being 14 its very simple this is one of my favorites. Great recipe"
"8","5","These are fantastic! Extremely simple and if you're a fan of chocolate and peanut butter you have to make these. I put the cookie dough in a muffin cup and baked them and then put the peanut butter cups in after. Definitely need to freeze the peanut butter cups though before you put them in or you'll have a giant mess."
"8","5","Better the next day! :)"
"8","5","Great cookies that kids love! Freeze the unwrapped peanut butter cups so that they are easier to press into the cookie dough. I have been making these cookies with my daughter since she was little; now a college student she still enjoys making them. They are a fun snow day project with children of any age."
"8","5","DELISH!!! These cookies were a SUPER HIT with all that I shared them with!! :O) I will DEFINITELY make these again!! However...please note, the size of the ball (when balling the dough) should be 3/4 the size of a ping pong ball. This will allow the cookie to fully wrap the pb-cup and won't project over the top of the candy. Also, I used the suggestion of freezing the cups before pushing into the cookie and that was perfect...I highly recommend that idea!! :O) *ENJOY!*"
"8","5","Great recipe. Really worth the effort of putting dough into mini muffin tins. but But BUT I highly recommend turning down the oven to 350 or 325 and baking them longer. First time I made them according to recipe, I burned the bottoms of about 36 of 48 :-("
"8","5","YUM!!! Make these cookies! You will not be disappointed! Like most, I did not have mini-cupcake tins so I just used a cookie sheet and they still came out wonderful. Thank you for this recipe!"
"8","5","so easy and so good!"
"8","5","Delicious!! Wouldn't change a thing."
"8","5","these were absolutely WONDERFUL!!! I'm sure they will be a Christmas tradition since they were such a hit."
"8","5","Received lots of great compliments."
"8","5","These were fun to make. We got creative and put snickers, whoppers and M&Ms in them. I would recommend doing them in mini muffin pans! The cookie will cover peanut butter cup better. I have also seen this done using a brownie mix.... I will be trying those next."
"8","5","These were sooo delicious and soo easy to make! It's always a nice change from the peanut butter blossoms that I make every holiday season."
"8","5","I gave this a 5 star rating simply because I couldn't give it more stars!! These were the best cookies!! We have found a new tradition of baking these cookies."
"8","5","Everybody flipped over these. Don't overcook because the little cups will get hard on the sides(they'll still be good) and remember to unwrap your pb cups before you take the cookies out of the oven so you can put them in the cookie while it's warm."
"8","5","This was yummy but I cut up the peanutbutter cups and added them right to the batter and baked them on a cookie sheet! They didn't last long!"
"8","5","I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I just made them on a cookie sheet and they were great!"
"8","5","Wow. These cookies were a big hit. Used dark chocolate pb cups for the health benefit (haha), and baked on a cookie sheet. Amazing."
"8","5","We made these this past Christmas and they were absolutely delicious! We put our peanut butter cups in the freezer and placed them in the cookies about 5 minutes after they came out of the oven. We refriderated the cookies for about 10 minutes prior to storing them. This recipe is easy to follow and simple to make! These cookies are a new family and friends favorite! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!"
"8","5","I love peanut butter cups, so this was the perfect cookie. Made it for Christmas family and friends loved it too. great recipe."
"8","5","These were the first gone on my Holiday cookie trays!"
"8","5","These weren't quite as strong on the PB taste as I expected, but they were still delicious! I made them to take to our company christmas party and everyone raved about them. They will be going into the regular rotation, thanks for sharing :)"
"8","5","This recipe was AMAZING! Even at high altitude they turned out soft and stayed that way. I couldn't agree more with everyone's tips on freezing the peanut butter cups and then putting the cookies in the fridge. The only thing I changed was instead of using the mini peanut butter cups that come with the wrappers, they are now making bite-sized minis that come in a snacking baggie of about 60 minis. They were WONDERFUL. To me, using a full size (even the small version) would detract from the cookie itself. The bite-size mini in the bag were absolutely perfect. They added the 'look' as well as some extra flavor, but didn't overpower the cookie itself either. I'll never make them any other way. I figure if I want a peanut butter cup I'll just go unwrap one, but if I want a cookie with a peanut butter cup as an accent that's how I'll do it."
"8","5","So good, I had trouble getting them out of the mini muffin pan so the second batch I used foil mini muffin papers, problem solved!"
"8","5","very good!"
"8","5","Great Recipe. Turned out awesome and yummy and was easier to make then anticipated. I did freeze the peanut butter cups before using and also put them in the fridge to cool to prevent the cups from melting, and they still melted a tiny bit so I wouldn't recommend doing otherwise. Timing was perfect too, don't overbake!"
"8","5","Easy! Yummy! What more can I say? I made the dough 2 days ago and kept it in a plastic container so we could bake later in the week. Then I just took the container out of the fridge and let warm up a bit. I used the mini baking peanut butter cups. Fun size would add more chocolate but these cookies are wonderful! Oh and did I mention EASY!"
"8","3","I liked them but the fam sort of let them sit...therefore I had to eat them all!!"
"8","4","Easy to make. Found that pressing down with back of spoon was easier than using the pb cup to do the pressing. Would start melting. Very fun for the kids."
"8","5","I totally cheated and used a bag of peanut butter cookie mix - made as directed then shaped into balls and followed the rest of the recipe. Yummy! Just watch the cookies closely, the will look they are not quite done, but if you leave them a minute longer, they will be too dark on the edges."
"8","4","Great recipe, i would try to make the cookie a little more crumbly next time."
"8","4","These are easy and yummy!"
"8","5","Yummy and super easy to make!!!"
"8","5","Not that this recipe needs another review but here it goes. These were awesome! I followed other reviewers comments - 1.) Do not over bake. Take out of the oven after 8 minutes. 2.) I unwrapped the candy ahead of time and put in the freezer for as long as possible. 3.) I refrigerated the dough prior to cooking to make it easier to scoop. I used a 2T scooper. These recommendations made it easy to bake these cookies when you only have 1 small cupcake pan. They cool much faster and come out wonderfully!"
"8","5","The hardest thing about making these cookies is waiting for the chocolate to harden so you can eat them. I would give them more stars if I could!"
"8","5","Awesome cookie recipe, and I didn't change a thing. Next time I make them I will use my mini muffin tin just so I can achieve the cup shape. Mine were more flat shaped with the pb cup center. Thank you, BUCHKO!"
"8","5","Delicious! I also used rolos when I ran out of peanut butter cups, and they were fantastic as well!"
"8","5","These are DELICIOUS!!!! :)"
"8","5","Fantastic cookie, easy to make. I made double the recipe and it still was not enough they were gone very fast. Will be added to my holiday baking for sure, and all year round :) thank you for the recipe"
"8","5","So easy and very delicious! I kept my dough in the fridge prior to making balls to make it easier to work with. I also used a cookie sheet insted of a muffin tin!"
"8","5","These cookies are fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. I recommend freezing the Reeses cups before placing them into the hot cookies. Also after you place the candy in the hot cookie place the muffin pan in the the fridge or freezer for 20 minutes to stop the chocolates from melting. Use a spoon to pop the cookies out of the pan."
"8","5","I made these for a party last night and they went over very well. Everyone seemed to love them. I left some at home for the kids and brought the rest to the party. They were gone in a flash. I will make a double batch next time. Yes, they were that good! I made exactly as written and my cooking time was 9 minutes. I loved how fast these cooked. They were so easy to make. I already have a request to make them again. Great recipe!"
"8","5","These little cookies are like a slice of heaven! I can't imagine improving on this recipe. I followed it exactly, but as others recommended chilled the peanut butter cups before putting in the cookies and then chilled the cookies in the pan immediately after adding the pb cups. And as another said, the trick to getting the cookie out of the muffin pan is to twist it - be sure the cookie is full enough to go over the top, so it can be twisted easily. I ended up with 34 cookies."
"7","5","These are fantastic!! The only changes I made were to use: unbleached flour and sugar in the raw. I didn't have quite enough pb cups, so for those few, I topped with chocolate chips & chopped up heath bar. Recipe is certainly a keeper! Thanks for sharing!"
"7","5","Followed the exact recipe and it turned out perfect!!  Also, followed suggestions below. Put PB Cups in the freezer and after pressing i put the pan in the fridge for about 20 minutes. also used room temperature butter and egg.  I dont eat PB Cups but i couldn't stop eating these!! so addicting"
"7","5","Love love love them!"
"7","5","Fan-tastic recipe!! I didn't change one single thing! I would def suggest refrigerating the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes, and make sure that the pb cups are FROZEN (they will keep their shape much better). I plan on making these for Easter, and decorating them with pastel sprinkles.. yummm! :~)"
"7","5","dont make the cookies too big or the top will pull off"
"7","4","I didn't use a mini-muffin pan. I'd recommend doing that, as the cookies just turned out flat. Since the chocolates melted, they still looked ok -- but the picture was better. They did get good taste-reviews."
"7","5","Favorite comment from those who've tried these at get togethers and tailgates - 'the best thing I've ever had in my mouth...almost...'.  Swapped out the peanut butter for smashed bananas, for a altered version, as well, which got great feedback for the banana w/ the peanut butter & chocolate cup together.   Shell is more towards a muffin/cake consistancy w/ the banana, and easier to remove from nonstick mini muffin pan when frozen (I've got to work on that...)"
"7","5","These are my boys new favorite! PURE CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!!"
"7","5","Everyone loved them! At first i thought they were a little hard but everyone said they were good."
"7","5","make sure to follow it the way it says, dont add too much flour or they dont turn out great"
"7","4","Good cookies - a definite for any peanut butter lover."
"7","5","The cookies are so delicious! They are not overdone whatsoever and they definitely deserve the high rating they have!   Literally perfect!"
"7","5","YUMMO! These are very good. I didn't change a thing, and they came out PERFECT! I brought them to an office bake sale and everyone loved them as well. Thx!"
"7","5","The cookies were surprisingly good! I ended up making less than 40 due to my use of a portioning scoop for consistency. Check picture #200"
"7","5","Came out wonderful! It was a huge hit. Can't wait to make them again soon!"
"7","5","I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and just got around to reviewing. They were perfect...no changes to recipe required. Easy and so yummy. My two sons loved them!!"
"7","5","These are some awesome cookies! They look like they would be kind of hard to make but they aren't! The only changed I made was that I omitted the brown sugar. I didn't wanted them to be overkill on sugar since you needed to add a peanut butter cup later on. I was also able to use a regular muffin pan since we didn't have a mini. They turned out delicious, and everyone loved them!"
"7","5","These cookies are so easy and actually stay soft and chewy! They are very sweet, so next time I make them I will use Hersey kisses instead of the peanut butter cups to see if that helps. They are DELISH!"
"7","4","I made these with almond butter instead of peanut butter. They turned out very tasty! Would recommend unwrapping & setting peanut butter cups on waxed tray in freezer; it made them much easier to plop on to the cookie. Don’t overcook the cookies, otherwise they will be too dry (they look a little bit undercooked when you take them out of oven, but that’s how they should look)."
"7","5","Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I bake often and like this version better than the rest b/c it was the perfect amount of peanut butter - not too overwhelming. Leaving them in the muffin tin until completely cooled makes it easier to remove when ready to serve."
"7","5","This recipe is so easy and my family could not get enough. Thx"
"7","5","These turned out perfect AS IS. I used my medium sccop from Pampered Chef (they also sell them at Wal-Mart, etc) and filled the mini-muffin pan. It did appear that the filling was going to be too much, but they turned out perfect as I put the cups in the cookie. FREEZE the cups. They will melt more quickly if you do not. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"7","5","Excellent! Freeze the pb cups while prepping (earlier if possible). Don't make the balls too big, they are harder to get out if they go above the muffin tin. Add pb cup as soon as they fall, then put in fridge before attempting removal."
"7","5","Oh. These are really good. Thanks!!"
"7","4","These are crowd pleasers. They are popular of course because of the peanut butter cups inside. Otherwise, they are definitely delicious, but not discriminating."
"7","5","These cookies are excellent and well worth the extra time it takes to freeze and unwrap the candies. I've found that using bread flour (with maybe with an extra 1-2 tablespoons) instead of all purpose flour yields a very tender cookie, crunchy peanut butter adds a more peanut buttery flavor and that making them a day ahead gives them the best taste. They are alright just out of the oven, but excellent the next day, heated slightly in the microwave."
"7","5","A great receipe. Dough freezes well before baking."
"7","5","Everyone liked these, they were very good."
"7","5","Easy to make and very yummy. This was a huge hit with the entire family this year!"
"7","5","Everyone thought these were great. I used a cookie sheet at the same temp and just rolled into balls and flattened them a little before baking. They will be ready to come out of the oven before they appear to be, dont overbake unless you like yours crunchy!"
"7","4","These are quite good and I was pleased at how soft they stayed! I did freeze my peanut butter cups before putting them into the cookies, and also stuck the muffin tin in the freezer once the candy was placed in the cookies, just to solidify everything. That way nothing melted. I also needed to chill my dough a bit before I could roll it into balls. They turned out beautifully and just melt in your mouth!"
"7","5","Very good. I followed all the directions. The batter reminds me of Reese's peanut butter. What's not to like. Freezing the PB cups was a good suggestion from one of the reviewers. Makes them easier to peel and less messy pushing into the hot dough. Easy and popular recipe!"
"7","5","These are the most delicious cookies ever. I have made these many times and they are really easy and quick. I prefer to slightly undercook them, so they are chewy. Everybody loves these and they are highly addictive.... so make with caution!"
"7","5","AWESOME RECIPE!! Made them for a Christmas Party and everyone loved them. Didn't have to make any changes to the recipe."
"7","5","These are the best. I made them today for Christmas Brunch and everyone loved them. I used dark chocolate peanut butter cups and they were great. I also modified the recipe a little to add equal parts of almond butter and peanut butter along with a dash of almond extract."
"7","5","This was a big hit at my family party. Easy to make and so good."
"7","3","I liked these cookies but only with a glass of milk...They were on the dry side. I thought that maybe I cooked them too long so I didn't leave the second batch in the oven as long but they were still dry. Nice concept though, I love the peanut butter cup in the middle."
"7","3","They were decent cookies, but I thought the peanut butter cookie itself was pretty dry."
"7","5","Foolproof! amazing recipe, don't change a thing"
"7","5","I made these exactly as listed and they were fabulous! I did, however, end up with 48 cookies instead of 40 and they all went in no time!"
"7","5","My husband said he has a new favorite cookie! Worked perfectly the first time!"
"7","5","awesome cookie. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I just rolled into small balls and baked on a cookie sheet.Turned out JUST FINE!"
"7","5","These are delicious! The only thing was that they take awhile to cool in the tray before you can pop them out. mmm"
"7","5","Very tasty and yummy especially if you love peanut butter. Hard to really tell if they were done after 8 minutes but I trusted other reviews and it was the right thing to do. I'd definitely make these again!"
"7","4","I also had problems with the cookies cracking. I did refrigerate the dough and use a cookie scoop rather than hand forming the balls. The tip to freeze the peanut butter cups was extremely helpful! Even though the cookies cracked they were still quite yummy!"
"7","5","Simple. Delicious. My kind of recipe."
"7","5","Tried these out and not only were they super easy to make, but they were a HUGE hit. My roommates and co-workers devoured them. *Tips: (1) Don't make the dough balls too big. They will rise, and you need enough space to press in peanut butter cups. (2) Eight minutes is perfect. You can push it to nine, but really eight minutes is perfect timing. (3). Wait for the chocolate to cool after putting the PB cups in! The chocolate stays really warm and soft for a good while."
"7","5","This was a great recipe and I didn't change any of the ingredients. The only problem I ran into was that I didn't have a mini-muffin pan like the recipe called for, so I read some reviews and saw that some people used a cookie sheet and others used a regular muffin pan. I tried both. The batch with the cookie sheets came out flat, but still tasted great. The regular sized muffin pan came out more like a cupcake. These were SO good, but some of the fuller cups needs a tad more cooking time."
"7","5","DELISH! My first batch was in the mini muffin pan, but my impatience for them to set so I could pop them out, made me make the rest on a cookie sheet. Either way, these ROCK!"
"7","3","Made exactly as directed. They stuck to my muffin pan. Basically a waste of a dozen cookies."
"7","5","Made these this morning and the only things I did different and in addition to the recipe:, was 1.) I used unsalted butter and 2.) I lightly sprayed Pam on all my mini muffin tins (cause some people complained the cookies would stick) and then I immediately froze the finished product still int he mini tins for a few minutes based on others suggestions. Gently with a knife they all came right out of the tins! Here's a tip: I did use a Tablespoon measure when scooping out the batter to make all the cookies even and flattened the Tablespoon batter filled measure on the side of the bowl then rolled each into a ball, so I got exactly 4 dozen mini balls (48) and just dropped them into each mini muffin tin. OMG, so yummy and melt in your mouth delic! I did use all natural, organic 100% peanuts, peanut butter and these are just fabulous and oh so good! I mean these are perfect! So, quick, so easy and so yummy! They look so pretty and profesional, Im sharing with my neighbor because these are just that good. I know we will not be able to stop from eating them all ourselves!"
"7","5","OMG I love these. Not only are they so cute, but they are so easy to make. And they taste amazing."
"7","5","I used a # 70 Scoop and made drop cookies out of these. They came out perfect at the 8 minute time. I did freeze the peanut butter cups. I ran out of the PB cups so I finished the remainder by using a fork to criss cross the cookie and adding a few red & green m&m's. Fantastic and they look really festive. Thanks for sharing this great cookie recipe."
"7","5","These cookies are fabulous! TRUST the timing on this. You could easily over cook them. I followed the advice of freezing the peanut butter cups and letting the cookies fall before pressing the candy in. They look just like the picture and taste even better!"
"7","5","Well I made these for a cookie bake-off at work today, and tied for the winner! They must have been great! I only got to eat one, though. I used the DARK chocolate cups too! and added sprinkles on top for a holiday touch."
"7","5","These were great!!! Very easy to make. 8 minutes in the over is perfect. I did put the mini muffin pan in the freezer for 1-2 minutes so the cookies just popped right out! I will make these again and again and again....."
"7","1","it's to chewy and i have bracers!!!!!!"
"6","5","Just made these for Christmas and they were a huge hit! Froze a few for later--worked like a charm. Simple to put together. Guess mine were a little bigger than they should've been as I only got 36 treats (darn!) Will make again...might not wait til Christmas this time."
"6","5","Excellent! Easy to make and my kids devour them! Thank you!"
"6","5","Fabulous recipe...so glad I found it."
"6","5","Love, Love, Love this recipe! My customers can not get enough of these tasty cookies. I didn't have to tweek anything, just followed the recipe as it is posted. Thank You!"
"6","4","We really enjoyed these cookies! My husband remembers similar cookies I made that were rolled in sugar before baking. Next time I will roll these ones too! I have no idea how the recipe makes 40 cookies, I got 24."
"6","5","I made these for a work function and people raved about them. They are addictive. I followed someone else's suggestion and put the chocolates in the fridge first and they were easy to push into the cookies. Also, I listened to the advice around not over baking these. The cookies hardly look done but they are brown on the bottom and ready to take out after the alloted time. I will make these lots!"
"6","5","Turned out great! I froze the peanut butter cups, and that was definitely a MUST! It would be way too difficult to use soft candy at room temperature.   Also, I found out that my cookies looked better when I actually rolled them into balls instead of just dumping the balls from my cookies scoop into the mini muffin tray. Rolling the balls between my hands gave the tops of the finished cookies a smoother look. Some of my cookies did crack a little on top when I put the peanut butter cup in, but I honestly didn't think they looked bad!   Overall, delicious! My boyfriend loved them and took a huge bag home with him after helping me make these! Fun and easy!"
"6","5","Huge hit every time they're made. For the holidays, add a few colorful sprinkles after the chocolate on top of the peanut butter cup softens. They ship really well too. 500 got to Afghanistan with no problems. My daughters also like to decorate them with faces for fun. Lots of ways to dress these up if you want and not loose their great flavor."
"6","5","I have made a cookie like this for years but much easier by using either the Pillsbury peanut butter cookie dough in a tube or Betty Crocker peanut butter cookie dough mix. Roll the dough into a ball, place it into a miniature muffin paper and place into miniature muffin baking pan and bake according to peanut butter cookie directions. Remove from oven and place miniature peanut butter cup into center of cookie and let cool. These taste really great, are easy to make and I have always gotten rave reviews from friends and family when I make them. The cookie stays fresh and softer longer if placed in a plastic container with a slice of bread placed in the container and sealed with plastic lid. Replace the slice of bread with new slice once the bread has dried out. Also great if stored in a refrigerator once the peanut butter cup has cooled down and become solid again."
"6","5","These cookies are more addicting than crack! ;-) I made several changes to the written instructions. I placed the peanut butter cups in the freezer as others suggested, chilled the dough before placing into the pans and I also lined the mini tins with paper liners. Removing the cookies from the tins was super easy and no mess."
"6","5","I made 4 batches of these cookies to send to my daughter who is deployed in Afghanistan. They were a DEFINITE hit!! Have my 'orders' to send more NOW!! They were dubbed 'crystal meth cookies' because they are so addicting...I did freeze the mini reeses and pop the cookies in the freezer for 2-3 minutes after they had cooled for 2 minutes out of the oven...they shipped perfectly....THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!"
"6","5","Delicious. My family gobbled them up. Definitely freeze the candies before squishing them into the cookie. TAKE THE COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN EXACTLY at 8 minutes like the recipe states, even if you think they need more time - they don't! Easy, no-fail recipe."
"6","5","I have to give this recipe 5 stars because for how simple these are, they are very delicious. My husband usually doesn't eat peanut butter cookies, and doesn't like peanut butter in general, but he loved these. Like many others have stated, freezing/refrigerating the peanut butter cups greatly helps. They do melt quickly though, so make sure you have an even surface to set them all on. I did substitute a 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 cup of white sugar as I was running low, and they still came out great (I tend to use brown sugar in place of white sugar for a lot of my cookies with great results). Definitely take the advice of many of the reviewers and do not bake these more than 8-8.5 minutes depending on your oven. They won't look 'done', but they will come out soft, chewy, and warm enough to melt the chocolate. I did make my first batch a little too large, so I would recommend making the dough balls about 1-1 1/2 inches in diameter at the largest. The second batch of cookies was about that size, and they were perfect. Even with the bigger ones I came out with a total of 20 cookies from both batches. So not as many as the recipe originally states, but if you make them smaller I'm sure you could get at least 30-35. If you're debating on this recipe, definitely try it. I chose it because I had everything but the peanut butter cups in my cupboards, and I'm glad I did (and you will be too). The only bad thing about these is how addictive they are. Rave reviews all around. :-)"
"6","5","I make this recipe using cookie dough from the refrigerated section of grocery stores. Both sugar cookie and chocolate chip cookie dough work well. I've also used Palmer brand Caramel Balls in place of the peanut butter cups when I can find them."
"6","5","wonderful!!!"
"6","5","FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"6","5","Gave it five stars as it was, but I would give it six now if I could. I am Italian, and we love our Nutella. Try substituting the peanut butter with Nutella-bake an extra minute or so and let cool after putting the peanut butter cup in it. Even better than the original-which is hard to beat!!!"
"6","5","Love love love these."
"6","5","I have been making these cookies since I was a kid and they are always a smash hit! Recently I made them with full sized pb cups in regular muffin tins and my husband raved about them. I found them too sweet, but I'm a baker that loves to bake more then eat the baked goods. I used the exact same recipe and just made larger dough balls. same cook time and temp. Pb cup lovers will be excited!!"
"6","5","This is always a hit with my fam/friends. TIP: If you don't have this recipe handy...don't fret, any PB Cookie recipe will do just fine for the dough. I would stay away from chunky PB (the peanut can burn.) Freeze your Reeses cups. This way it doesn't melt fast when inserting/pressing them into cookie ball. Also, be careful not to over bake : )"
"6","5","So delicious. My family loves these, and they are pretty easy to make. Brought these in for my sons party and all the teachers wanted the recipe."
"6","5","2 Words: Perfect & Beautiful!"
"6","5","Made these for Christmas and they disappeared quickly!"
"6","5","These cookies were so easy to make!"
"6","5","excellent! used vegetable oil instead of butter abd they still came out great!"
"6","5","These were very good. I burned the 1st batch... Here's a few tips. Don't put more than one tray in the oven. Don't bake more than 8 minutes. My second tray could have been in for 7 minutes. Freeze opened peanut butter cups. If you don't have time to wait for them to cool, put in the fridge."
"6","5","A huge hit with the entire family! I made 4 batches of these over Christmas. Super easy recipe that tastes great."
"6","5","These are great-I cooked one batch in a muffin tin and the other on a cookie sheet. I prefer the cookie sheet. I would also wait a few more minutes until putting the chocolates in the middle, because mine melted a bit more than i wanted."
"6","5","These cookies are AMAZING! If you don't have the peanut butter cups, the recipe works great for a drop cookie, as well."
"6","5","Love the cookies. I have made them 3 times for get togethers and everyone loved them. Lets just say there are never left over cookies."
"6","5","I am not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies...but I LOVED THESE!! Dont be alarmed when adding the peanut butter cup that they look undercooked... They will turn out just fine! LOVE LOVE LOVE! These are my new favorite cookie!"
"6","4","Delicious! I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I crushed 12-15 mini PB cups and mixed in with the cookie dough. They came out great!"
"6","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great. I made them a few times and everyone wants to know where I got the recipe from. I highly recommend this to anyone."
"6","5","Excellent!! I added 2 tablespoons of Kahula! It was wonderful!"
"6","5","Good lord, these are the best cookies I think I have ever made. My wife and I both love them. Addictive though. Kinda like Lays potato chips, Can't eat just one."
"6","5","Didn't make my usual Peanut Blossoms at Christmas and was in the dog house with my 9 year old for it. Made these to make up for it as they looked like they'd be less time consuming. They were loved by all (especially the baker since I didn't have to roll them all in sugar first!)"
"6","5","I made these cookies for a Christmas party and people could not stop saying how good they were. Definitely a crowd pleaser."
"6","5","Yum! these are kind of a pain in the posterior to make when you only have 1 small pan but everyone loved them, so it's worth it :)"
"6","5","Fabulous and easy! I doubled the recipe and it made three large pans (my scoop was not the smallest.) I think these cookies are great even when they dry out a bit. I used festive mini Christmas paper cups and they were great seasonal treats."
"6","3","These were delis on the very day but dried out quick and sat there for the rest of the week till I threw them out!"
"6","5","I would like to say thank you all for the recipe. It was very fun to make with my four girls and we loved them. I followed the directions and some suggestions and everything went smooth. Thanks again. We had a blast in the kitchen."
"6","5","Beware!! These are HIGHLY addicting!! Nothing better than peanut butter and chocolate! :)"
"6","5","Fabulous. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I formed the dough around the cups & rolled the whole thing in sugar. They looked awful but even my monkeying with the setup didn't change how great they tasted. :)"
"6","5","these cookies are great!!!!! A nice change from the traditional peanut butter blossums,I would prefer to make these from now on :) I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out really good :) Thanks for sharing!"
"6","3","I made these for the first time about a month ago and I wasn't impressed with them. Hence the reason for the 3 stars. I love peanut blossom cookies and peanut butter cups so I thought that I would love these. I hand rolled the balls then rolled them in sugar. I baked them as directed, when I took them out of the oven I let them sit for a little while then pushed the PB cups in. I had no problems with cracking. I may try them again in the future."
"6","5","awesome!"
"6","5","Delicious, and fun for your kids! :)"
"6","5","Super simple and delicious. Good idea to follow the other's suggestions regarding freezing the PB cups, waiting for the 'sink' and cooling before trying to remove. I also used my smallest scoop (approx 2t), which was perfect, but the recipe made 58 cookies instead of 40. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Enjoy!"
"6","5","Unbelievably easy to make and my teenage daughter said they were the best cookies 'ever!' Nice variation on the Hershey's kiss kind of cookie and more substantial. My only change was to use mini muffin liners in the tin so they are easier to transport. Otherwise, just perfect!"
"6","5","My son is a peanut butter fiend so I made a batch of these for him. Quick to make and very yummy!"
"6","5","I followed the directions to a 'T', Outstanding cookie, very easy to make."
"6","5","Great recipe. Cookies turned out well. Made as is and am pleased."
"6","4","Cookies were pretty good but a little on the bland side. I thought they were a little hard to ' roll ' but baked nicely. Very hard to get out of pan. After rolling I then rolled them in white sugar for a little extra something special. You can also used colored sugars which would be great for holidays. Tips: refridgerate p.b cups, let cookie sink a little before adding p.b cup middles and refridgerate cookies in pan before trying to pull them out and cool. Kids loved them !!"
"6","1","Too much PB flavor! Needs more chocolate."
"6","5","These turned out great! I've never baked before but I followed the directions exactly and they were delicious!"
"6","4","pretty good, use flat knife to remove from mini pan, not a spoon! also, don't make the balls too big"
"6","5","So yummy. Very rich. My only complaint is that even though I put the batch in fridge (as other suggested) after I put the chocolate in the cookie the chocolate still melted which actually tasted good, but the chocolae stays in the melted wet state. So you can't pile up the cookies or put in a baggie cause the chocolate gets all over. Other than that the taste is amazing. My hubby ate 6 before they were even doen cooling."
"6","5","A quick easy tip! You can use any of those break and bake cookies. It's really cute if you put the mini muffin tin paper liners in because it leaves the same creases that the peanut butter cups do. You just put one of the little squares in each liner and bake according to package directions and stick in a peanut butter cup and quickly transfer to freezer to avoid melting the cup."
"6","5","Oh wow! Decadent! Everyone was asking for the recipe. The trick is the mini muffin tin. It makes the cookies so cute and so insanely good. Like a peanut butter cup completely wrapped in peanut butter cookie. They only need 8 minutes in the oven. They don't look done, but they are. I did use the tip of freezing the peanut butter cups, and the tip to put the tray of cookies in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes after they come out of the oven. I get about 36 cookies out of this, and my tin only holds 24, so I have to use the tray again, and the 10 minutes in the 'fridge cools the cookies enough to get them out easily, and makes the pan cool enough to handle."
"6","5","To die for! These turned out great and were so much fun to make with my 7 year old daughter! I suggest putting them in the fridge after you put in the peanut butter to deter a melty chocolate mess. YUMMY and FUN!"
"6","5","This was an outstanding recipe! A peanut butter lovers delight! I didn't know what size to make the balls of dough but ended up with 53 cookies. This is definately a keeper!"
"6","5","If you're a peanut butter freak like I am, you'll absolutely love these!"
"5","5","This was our gift to the neighbors for the holidays. I had many complaints at first that I didn't make my usual peppermint bark, but once they tasted these 'cookies,' there is no going back. They are wonderful!   I, too, chilled the peanut butter cups before placing them in the cookie & chilled the final product right after baking. No problems with melting chocolate.  My favorite part about these is the staying power! These suckers stayed moist and delicious even after several days(a huge plus when handing out during the holidays!) I will obviously make these again next year."
"5","5","My husband is obsessed with peanut butter cups so these ended up being a big hit in our household."
"5","5","Awesome, very easy to make and taste great! Key is to have the right pan, I had the wrong size and they came out a bit flat, but I bought the right pan and they were perfect!"
"5","5","Wow! This was great. I baked for 8 minutes in a couple of mini muffin pans and they came out just underdone which is how we all love them! I did refridgerate the batter after it was made for about 10 minutes to ensure that it was easier to roll. Thanks so much!Also, make sure you freeze your cups before putting them into a warm cookie."
"5","5","Best cookie period...and I'm not a big Reeses fan. First time I baked them with butter on muffin paper on a cookie sheet they can out perfect. Next time I used half butter & half Smart Balance (trying to be healthy) & placed them in a muffin pan. They took way too long to bake, and were so bad I had to toss them. Just stick to the recipe. They are fantastic!!"
"5","5","I added these cookies as an additional item to my regular Christmas Baking. They were a huge hit and absolutely delicious. Easy to make. I did't have a muffin pan so just roll dough into balls and when fresh out of the muffin push the reece cup into cookie where it kind of melts. Yummy! Worth your time!"
"5","5","Excellent!! Changes I made: Used crunchy peanut butter and baked on a cookie sheet. Turned out perfect. Make sure to have extra milk on hand to drink while eating these :)"
"5","5","If you like peanut butter and chocolate, you gotta luv these cookies. Delicious."
"5","5","DELISH ! These were great ..... it took me the first batch to get the right size ... be careful to push the pb cup down bc if there is any sticking up it will just melt and pour over the sides."
"5","5","I made these this morning and they turned out great! I used a mini muffin pan, refrigerated the dough for about an hour and a half and used my small pampered chef scoop. I also put my peanut butter cups in the freeser for awhile and put the entire pan with cooked cookie with peanut butter cup in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes before removing to cooling rack. All of these tips that I read before making the cookies were very helpful! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"5","5","awesome !!!! will make again i got 5 doz using a small cookie scoop from pampered chef..."
"5","4","These were tasty and oh so sweet...but why wouldn't they be with the great combo of chocolate and peanut butter! It would have been nice to know what size balls to make to equal 40. I guessed and ended up with 32. I also followed others advice to freeze the candy and that worked nicely."
"5","5","They were great! My nieces and nephew demolished them within a couple of hours! I did make a few minor changes. I added a 1/4 more flour to mine, the consistancy of the badder is better by adding it. I rolled them into balls and then rolled them into sugar before putting them in the mini muffin pan. Make sure you freeze the peanut butter cups before placing them in the cookies. I also set them in the freezer for 5-10 min to make the cooling process faster."
"5","5","These are so amazing! My boyfriend, who HATES peanut butter, wouldn't stop eating them. SOOO delicious!"
"5","4","I make these all the time and love them. I use regular muffin tins and a whole pb cup, not miniature sometimes! No matter what size I do, the sides crack horribly and look messy. Still taste good, just embarrassing to share with company or take to party."
"5","5","Really liked these. These are easy to make and easy to love!"
"5","5","Make these! Do it now! =) You won't regret it. Well, maybe your hips will..."
"5","5","Really quick and easy - DEFINITELY put the candy in the freezer for a while - really helps them not fall apart on you when you are pushing them into the cookies."
"5","5","the pan doesnt let go off the cookie so if u use a little pam it always help"
"5","5","Wonderful recipe. Reeses came out with peanut butter minis. i just tried them thinking that it might be better than the minatures and the perfect size. NOPE. the minatures are better"
"5","5","So easy and yummy. I only have one mini muffin pan so after I put the peanut butter cups into the cookie dough, I put the pan in the freezer for about 10 minutes and I can pop out the first batch and it is ready for the second."
"5","1","these are awful"
"5","5","I made these cookies and they were sooo good.. very peanut buttery and chocolatey.... I ended up using half a reese's towards the last batch.. very sweet but yummy"
"5","5","delicious. gone very fast."
"5","3","Ok, I think I need to try them again. The bottoms were a little hard."
"5","5","amazing!! they disappear in minutes!"
"5","4","Yummy, but VERY rich! I made these for my boyfriend and I am a little afraid he will not like them because he is not into the super sweetness, and neither am I. The cookies themselves are super sweet, as are the peanut butter cups. It is a pure blast of sugar. I had to eat these with a glass of milk or something because they were so rich. This recipe is basically a peanut butter cookie with a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. I will make this again, but probably for my Grandpa who loves peanut butter cups. Overall, a good and inventive recipe. I followed the advice of freezing the peanut butter cups prior to inserting them in the cookie and it worked very well!"
"5","5","Very delicious!"
"5","5","Fantastic cookies! I found making larger balls for the tray made pushing the frozen peanut butter cups into the cookie easier. I also put the completed cookies in the fridge to keep the chocolate from melting too much."
"5","5","I made these as a gift for our nephews... I'll have to make more next year because my son was so jealous!"
"5","5","I followed recipe word for word except that I baked them for 11 mins, may just be my oven though and they came out WONDERFUL! Even friends who don't care for peanut butter cookies loved these. Thanks!"
"5","4","These were great. The Reeses instead of chocolate stars was a great change."
"5","5","Were a big hit with my grandchildren. Definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing."
"5","5","Delicious! Easy to make too."
"5","5","They're great!!!!!!!!!"
"5","5","Easy and Yummy!"
"5","5","Excellent recipe. No substitutions necessary. Thanks!"
"5","5","Holy in a Pita these are good. I made mine on a cookie sheet and they did crack when I put the frozen peanut butter cups in. Doesn't matter though. If you are making them on a cookie sheet, you will need to use about a tablespoon of dough so that there is enough surrounding dough to match the height of the pb cups. I wasn't able to get 40 cookies that way, but they turn out better if the cookie comes to the same height as the pb cup."
"5","5","These cookies were sooooo good. I got numerous raves about them. Used both reeces cups and hersey kisses!"
"5","5","Great recipe to make with kids. Mixing up the ingredient while they have an assembly line going makes things run smoothly (until they start eating them). And freezing/refrigerating the peanut butter cups before hand did make all the difference when having to shove them in hot cookies."
"5","4","Seriously easy, seriously yummy! I made these for Christmas instead of peanut blossoms (PB cookies w/Hershey's kisses), and I'm so glad I did! I loved the idea of using the mini muffin tin, and it worked like a charm. I followed many other reviews and froze the peanut butter cups - this is a MUST! The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I got slightly annoyed with taking the cookies out of the muffin pan. I inevitably scraped some of the cookie off while trying to get them out. It wasn't awful, but still annoying nonetheless. Thinking I might lightly spray the muffin tin with PAM next time to see if that helps the process."
"5","5","Had to make these twice this week, the first batch went so fast. Freezing the chocolates first helped a lot. Made them with Rolo chocolates in the centre as well. Yum!!"
"5","5","After placing the peanut butter cups into the cookie I put them back into the oven for 1 minute to let the top of the peanut butter cup melt."
"5","5","I don't really care for peanut butter, but these rocked my world! I just made them cookies and they were amazing. Bake them 8 minutes!!! no more! they're so good I'm going to have to make another batch, because I know they are going to go fast!"
"5","4","I just made these tonight!! I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing i would change is to add more sugar..to me theyre not sweet enough but i do have a big sweet tooth so maybe thats why. But i am no baker and it turned out perfect! Thanks!!"
"5","5","Great recipe. I just wish I had more of the mini muffin tins than just one. I would have gone faster. :)"
"5","4","The best! I followed the recipe as written. I also followed the advice of past reviewers and took them out exactly at 8 minutes. My brother can't stop eating them. Definitely recommend."
"5","5","I used freshly ground soft white wheat (added an extra 1/2 cup because it was freshly ground) and substituted honey granules for the sugar (1 cup - same as for regular sugar). Followed the recipe exactly, otherwise, and they came out perfectly. They look impressive and they are delicious. These will be a regular addition to my Christmas cookies!"
"5","5","Just made these and they turned out great! I followed the advice and froze the peanut butter cups while the cookies were baking and also put the pan into the fridge after putting the peanut butter cups in them. I used a melon baller to make my cookies all the same size. that worked great!"
"5","5","Wow! This cookies are delicious. Easy to make. I adjusted the sugar a teeny bit to make it a little less sweeter since the peanut butter cups are so sweet. Other than that, with adjustment and without they are the best!!!!!"
"5","3","these are ok, nothing to brag about. not much flavor to the dough itself."
"5","5","These cookies are phenomenal! My friend and I just made them today and we both agreed that they're the best cookies we've ever had. The only problem is that I don't know how I'm going to keep myself from eating them all."
"5","5","I buy marked-down candy after Halloween for such projects as this. It keeps very well. I had two bags of peanut butter cups. GREAT inexpensive cookies for treat give-aways. Hint: If cold, put in the m'wave for about 10 seconds...oh my!!!"
"5","5","These turned out GREAT!! I can't do peanut butter because it gives me heartburn, but my boyfriend and all my friends LOVED them!! I had a few concerns: The recipe says to make 40 balls, but my batch only made 24; but they still turned out perfect. I don't know if I made them wrong or if my pan was too deep or what... Also, piece of advice: Unwrap the peanut butter cups just before you take the cookies out of the oven; I didn't do that, and the last few cookies' tops were hard while pressing the cups in. I also followed some advice from other reviews such as freezing the cups! Thanks to everyone who contributed and the person who posted this!! They're amazing!!"
"5","5","Excellent. Definitely freeze the pb cups beforehand, and place the pan in the refrigerator to cool before trying to take cookies out. If you cool the pan too much, just let it warm to room temperature and the cookies will come right out. You can use the tip of a butter knife to loosen the edges. I had no problems. Also...the cookies are done after 8 mins, they don't look like it but they are. Very good!"
"5","5","Best. Cookie. Ever! I followed the directions to a T except that I don't have a mini muffin pan. Also, I recently found that Reese's has started making an even smaller mini PB cup that were just the right amount of candy for this cookie. They come in an orange bag of unwrapped minis, it saved me unwrapping candies!"
"5","5","Everyone of these came out perfect...followed some of the previous tips. Froze the peanut butter cups...waited till the centers on the cups sank before putting in the cups. Then I sprinkled on some christmas sprinkles, then I popped them back in the oven for 1 min so the sprinkles would stick to the chocolate. They are great."
"5","5","So so decadent and delicious!"
"5","5","I think these are one of my favorite cookies ever!! Seriously, I could not stop eating them. I didn't change a thing. Perfect as they are."
"5","5","I've made these cookies twice. The first time, I didn't use a muffin pan, I just used a cookie sheet. When I tried to push the pb cups into the cookies, they cracked and the pb cups would only go in about half way. The second time, I used a muffin pan, and I put the pb cups in the freezer for about 20 minutes beforehand. What a difference! The pb cups easily pushed into the cookies and didn't get all soft and melty. The cookies stayed intact, and they looked great. Plan enough time to make these cookies because they take a long time to cool. The reese cups melt in the cookies and it gets messy trying to eat them. They take a couple of hours to harden back up. Even though my first attempt didn't turn out so great, these cookies are delicious. They aren't too rich, and they are soft and gooey."
"5","5","OMG, these are so good! I followed the recipe exactly as stated. Although a cookie sheet can be used, the consistency of the cookie is meant to be thicker, more cake like so it is, in my opinion, important to use the mini muffin tin. This way, there is more dough around each PB cup, almost like a sweet little tart. I tried it with a cookie sheet and the recipe turns out much better with the mini muffin tins. Thanks for an awesome recipe. These cookies don't last around our house!"
"5","5","I used my smallest cookie scoop and gently pressed them into a silicone mini muffin pan. I froze the candies before I placed them on the cookies. I pushed the candies into the cookies immediately after removing them from the oven. YUM! NOTE: Do not wait for these to brown very much on the top because they brown a lot on the bottoms! Don't overcook!!"
"5","4","Very Yummy! I didn't have a mini-muffin pan, so I baked them on a cookie sheet. Still good, like that. Freeze the PB cups first, and they will come out great!"
"5","5","Quick prep tip: Use Pillsbury chocolate chip cookie dough! (The log type kept in the refrigerated section at the store). Slice off about 1/3 ' and line the muffin cup. Then just pop the pb cup on top BEFORE you put in the oven. All bakes at the same time. The pb cup melts during baking but will firm up once it cools. Delicious!"
"5","5","YUM! I made these as directed, but froze the peanut butter cups before pressing them into the baked cookies. I also refrigerated them directly after that and the peanut butter cups held their shape. What I like about this recipe is that the cookies came out very moist and soft. Even after taking them out of the fridge and returning to room temp, they were not hard or crunchy. I made 24 of them in a mini muffin pan and made the rest with just the mini muffin liners on a cookie sheet. I actually liked the ease of making them in the liners on a cookie sheet, best. Next time, I will skip the muffin pan and make them all at once on a cookie sheet with liners only because the still held their shape just the same. This recipe yielded 38 cookies for me. I will add this to my Christmas Cookie collection and will include them in my goodie tins for friends/teachers/family. Thanks for the recipe!"
"5","4","I've been making this for a while and its always good. Here's a tip: roll the balls in white sugar and then pop them in the oven. I also usually use chocolate kisses in the center."
"5","5","Wonderful recipe! I did follow another's review and I put them directly into the freezer after inserting the candies. Just 10-15 minutes in the freezer and the candies were solid enough to pop out of the mini-muffin pan and complete cooling on a rack."
"5","5","This cookie is FOOL PROOF! They are so easy to make and so striking when finished. The taste and texture of these cookies is perfect. Absolutly wouldn't change a single thing. I will make them again and again."
"5","5","Fabulous! I made these exactly as directed and they turned out perfectly. I used them as Christmas gifts for my kids' teachers and they were a big hit - we loved them so much I had to make a second batch. But they are so quick and easy to make that was no problem!"
"5","5","Awesome! This was the easiest recipe, not time consuming at all to make these. The dough was light and fluffy, hard to keep my daughters' fingers out of it! When the chocolate started to melt a little bit, I put a small amount of holly berry on top of each cookie to make them more festive looking. I just got done making another batch, the first one went over so well at my first party. I will continue to make these for years to come! Thanks!"
"5","5","This is an excellent recipe. So quick and easy to make. I was worried about the cookies being done because the batter was pretty wet when I took the cookies out of the oven, but as others have commented, the 8 minutes are perfect. Freezing the peanut butter cups was another great suggestion. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I used a cookie sheet and the cookies came out just fine. My toughest critics say these are some of the best cookies they've ever had. Looks like I'll have to make some more...."
"5","4","Great cookies!!! I used a reg size muffin pan and had no problems!! I did put hole pan in freezer for 5 mins before removing cookies and it worked perfect"
"5","5","Fantastic! These were the hit of our cookie exchange. I did have to cook them for 11 minutes instead of 8. I doubled the recipe and also put them in mini muffin cups for easier clean up."
"5","5","incredibly sweet but well worth the treat. My husband loves Reese Peanut Butter cups so it didn't take long for us to finish them off. I put crushed roasted (UNSALTED) peanuts on the tops to add more of a visual aspect (this is great for adult get togethers). For kids parties I highly suggest what another user said and put sprinkles on top."
"5","5","I used the roll of peanut butter cookie dough from the store and pb cups, worked like a charm......I LOVE THIS RECIPE"
"5","5","I made these after receiving some from a cookie exchange at Christmas this year. It was not the same recipe, however these were much better!! My kids love them and they are so easy to make. This one will for sure be made again. Thanks!"
"4","5","absolute perfection! Followed recipe to the tee and it could not have been any better/easier. Got 41 cookies I had lost my old recipe for these and just came across them on here. thanks for sharing."
"4","4","Delicious. My coworkers gobbled this up!"
"4","2","I really thought these would be great, but they just did not come out like I'd hoped. First off I think the recipe is lacking some information. I had no idea how big to make the balls so I rolled them a tad smaller than golf ball sized. I followed the recipe exactly but the dough was really undercooked after 8 minutes which you can't tell until you try and remove them from the tin and by then it's too late to put them back in the oven because the candies are in already. The bottoms looked like raw dough and they were very greasy looking and feeling. The peanut butter cup is what makes this taste good but the cookie part does not have a good peanut butter cookie flavor at all. The recipe does not tell you how long to let these cool and it's a very long time. I read the reviews which said to put them in the fridge but even after a half hour the candies were still not set and after an hour I still had a difficult time getting them out of the tin. This process will take a long time if you're using a 1 dozen muffin tin. I have a 2 dozen one and it still took a long time. The 40 cookie yield was way off for me too. I doubled the recipe and only got about 52 cookies. I don't see how you can roll the balls much smaller and have these come out right so I don't see where 40 cookies per batch comes from. I normally make peanut blossoms with the Hershey Kisses or peanut butter cup centers and should have stuck with the old tried and true."
"4","4","Recipe is amazing, but you need to grease the pan or they will stick. I used a non-stick mini muffin pan and they still stuck"
"4","5","Using a roll of Pillsbury Chocolate Chip cookie dough is a way to make this great recipe a lot easier in a time crunch!"
"4","5","these are fabulous! i add a little bit more peanut butter than the recipe calls for because i love peanut butter. definitely freeze the peanut butter cups before hand, and quickly put the cookies in the freezer for a little bit after you've added the peanut butter cups to them. if you do that and follow the rest of the recipe, they should turn out great! :)"
"4","5","turn out perfect every time! I like to use chunky peanut butter for a little extra crunch."
"4","3","The only reason I am giving these a lower score than they really taste, I am giving these on the lack of descriptions in the recipe. I am a novice baker so things like 'bake until the edges are starting to brown' or 'till you can poke through clean with toothpick' are crucial . Again, a tasty recipe...though the majority of my batch has fallen apart."
"4","4","They were good but I'm not as enthusiastic as everyone else. I didn't think the cookie part was quite sweet enough. I had to use skim milk because that's all i had so maybe that made a difference.  RE mini muffin pans vs just a cookie sheet: Definitely use the mini muffin pan. I didn't have enough room in my mini muffin pan for all the dough so I made some on a cookie sheet (used the small cookie scooper for both). The mini muffin pan makes a nicer presentation and the dough doesn't break when you insert the frozen PB cup"
"4","5","I dont have a mini muffin pan but I wanted to try this anyway. I made them the same. Rolled the dough into balls and placed on a cookie sheet. I watched them closely in the oven and made sure that I took them out as soon as they were done. I let them cool 1 minute and then pressed a peanutbutter cup into the middle of them. They were fantastic and everyone fought over the last few. Thanks for this recipe!"
"4","4","these cookies are amazing if you love peanut butter! i read the reviews, and freezing the unwrapped candies was a huge help. When they were done my brother and i took them to school and sold them to students. they were a huge hit"
"4","5","Made these and brought them to work. Two thumbs up from everyone! I noticed that they are done in the oven when the middles collapse a bit. Foolproof and delicious!"
"4","5","These were a real crowd pleaser. My whole family loved them. I really liked how easy these were to make, too! I had no problems with the recipe at all and they have turned out consistently every time I've made them. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!"
"4","4","I think my critic were rough on me with this one. They came out amazing in my opinion. I ran out of peanut butter cups and make a few cookies without it and my critic (aka my boyfriend) seems to like them better without. Either way, it works!"
"4","5","Turned exactly like default picture! And so so yummy!!"
"4","5","SUPER EASY! Def recommend freezing the peanut butter cups a bit before putting them in the cookies. The mini muffin pan made this extremely easy as well! YUM YUM!"
"4","5","A huge hit with my coworkers!"
"4","5","The best cookies ever! I ended up using a regular muffin pan since I didnt have a mini one. I didnt roll mine into a ball because I didnt feel like my batter was firm enough to do that. I just used a teaspoon and scooped some up and put it in the muffin pan. The cookies will look like they are not done but take them out anyway. As they are setting to cool they will finish cooking. I put my pb cups in the freezer so they were easier to press into the cookies. I didnt change any of the ingredients. I think every recipe needs to be done as instructed the first time and then do the tweaking. Thanks for sharing! By far the best cookie ever!"
"4","3","Expected better."
"4","5","Yum!"
"4","4","These are pretty good. I wish the cookie part had a stronger peanut butter flavor. In my oven, 8 minutes was a little too long for my cookies. Just remember to check them because every oven is different. (And I have an oven thermometer.)"
"4","4","We made 1.5 batches, except we only used 1 c. sugar total instead of 1.5 batches (1.5 c) of sugar). Using the melon baller that we use for all drop cookies and standard 'roll into ball' cookies we got 40 cookies (rather than the expected 60 for 1.5 batches). Very tasty and sweet even w/ less sugar."
"4","5","Delicious! Made them as cookies on cookie sheet and tried mini muffin tins. Both were great but the muffin tins worked slightly better."
"4","5","These are fantastic! Omg perfect recipe. I do reccommend baking them on a flat cookie sheet though. For me the mini cupcake was too thick and the cookie came out thick and doughy. I made both the ones in the cookie sheet were yummmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!! Wait till they are completely cool to eat they taste so much better cold."
"4","5","Best PB cookie ever... Everyone raved over them at work"
"4","5","Made these as one of the Christmas cookies and they were great! I am now making them for the fifth time since Christmas because the family wants them all the time."
"4","5","This is one great cookie. I baked 9 minutes on convection, then pressed on the peanut butter cups, sprinking some nonpareils on the warm chocolate cups....looks more like the holidays...superb!"
"4","4","So easy! They are a real treat for our Christmas tray. YUMMY!"
"4","5","Thanks for the recipe! They were the first to go!"
"4","5","Great! But, it didn't make as many as it said. I took this to a family party and they were gone with in 1 hour!"
"4","5","Phenomenal exactly as written. VERY peanut buttery! They don't look done at 8 minutes but they are perfect!"
"4","5","These were a HIT! Amazing and delicious. I bought the smallest unwrapped Reeses cups I could find (they now sell these mini's already unwrapped) and used Gingerbread cookie molds, SO GOOD>"
"4","5","These are great! Mine came out a bit flat cause I used large muffin pans so if you dont have mini's then i would get them, i will be for when i make them next! I also didnt add the peanut butter in the cookie batter and made hershey kiss cookies too! Just added a little more milk to keep them moist! great recipe and thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","These are so good. Everyone I made them for has loved them. Treat yourself to a warm one straight out of the oven with a glass of milk."
"4","5","I made these for Christmas for goody bags. They were easy and came out great!"
"4","5","Excellent and easy. Followed the recipe and the comments to the T and these are now a new family favorite. I used a mini muffin pan, baked exactly for 8 minutes and had the chilled peanut better cups ready to go when I took the cookies out of the oven. I pressed each peanut butter cup into the cookies and chilled them in the refridge until they were cooled. Excellent. My son in law who is a chef almost ate the whole batch. Use caution around hungry cookie monsters."
"4","5","First time making these and they are fantastic! Do make sure to freeze or chill the peanut butter cups before they go in the cookie and remove from the pan asap or the cup just melts. Will be apart of our Christmas cookie collection for a long time."
"4","5","may just make my husband fall in love with me all over again! Made exactly as written, and turned out perfectly! I did, though, take one suggestion and froze the PB cups first, and it did seem to make a difference."
"4","5","Oh my gosh, these cookies are wonderful!"
"4","3","These cookies were just ok. Too much peanut butter for my taste. I prefer the good old fashioned peanut butter cookie with chocolate kiss in the middle to balance out the peanut butter."
"4","5","VERY YUMMY... SUPER MESSY TILL THEY FULLY COOL BUT WHEN THEY ARE WARM THEY ARE REALLY GOOD... I HAVE TO MAKE SOME MORE TO MAKE MY FAMILY HAPPY..."
"4","1","Well I have made these cookies twice now and they are just not worth making. In my opinion they are nothing more than sugar bombs. Tasteless and dry. Definately won't make these again!"
"4","4","These taste great, but the peanut butter cups melt pretty badly when you push them into the cookie. I don't know how to fix that part"
"4","5","We LOVE these cookies!! Very easy and Makes a large batch. I used my mini silicone cupcake pans. After i put the candy cups on the inside of the cooked cookie i put the whole tray in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes. They set faster and you don't have to leave the cookies in the tray and wait before you make more. Yummy Recipe!"
"4","5","These are just plain yummy. I have made them several times and they never last very long. I followed the recipe exactly. I always make sure to unwrap the candies while the cookies are baking. Once the cookies come out of the oven, you have to move pretty quickly to gets the candy in the cookie before the cookies sets and starts to cool. Once they are cooled down, I pop them in the fridge for about 10 mins to make sure the candy is firm before removing from the pan. I have also used foil mini cupcake liners set loose on a cookie sheet when I want to make a double batch but don't have enough mini muffin pans. Beware! These are addictive! Mmmm!"
"4","5","How can you improve on peanut butter and chocolate? If you don't have a mini muffin pan, just put small round balls of dough on your baking sheet (don't flatten). They will turn out a little bigger than the picture, but are still wonderful."
"4","5","Delicious! I made these to hand out to the neighbors for Christmas but my family wouldn't keep their hands off of them so I had to make more for the neighbors. A big hit!"
"4","5","Mmmmm...perfect :) These are a new holiday tradition in my home...thanks for this yummy recipe."
"4","5","I've been making these cookies for years now and they're EXCELLENT!!!! When I was first 'introduced' to these wonderful cookies they were called 'Peanut Butter Tempations'. There couldn't be a better name for them either, because they really are a big tempation for me and my family!!"
"4","5","This is the first recipe from this website that has turned out exactly as it's supposed to. The only thing that I did differently was that I used a small ice cream scoop instead of the mini-muffin pan, and they turned out to be a perfect size for the mini peanut butter cups. These taste great and are sure to be a big hit at our annual cookie bake!"
"4","5","I made the mistake of thinking they were not done baking, so I let them go for a few more minutes. MISTAKE. They are done after 8 minutes. Don't let them stay in any longer."
"4","4","i love these cup cake cookies but i just like to put a little bit of salt in them so they are not too sweet.."
"4","5","I followed directions as is but instead used a cookie sheet and they came out great. Delicious!"
"4","5","Excellent and simple to make! My 3yrd loved to help roll up the batter and drop them in the muffin tin. Adding to my permanent collection. Thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","This is a wonderful recipe! I lined my mini muffin cups with the paper liners first. They came out super easy! Will make again for sure"
"4","5","I wish I could give more stars. I followed the recipe as written, and froze the cups. They are so addictive, not to mention quick and easy to make. My poor waistline ;)"
"4","5","Excellent recipe!! Followed the directions exactly. SO easy! I froze the PB cups before pressing them into the hot cookies. Delish! I doubled the recipe and used a small cookie scoop... it made about 62 cookies!"
"4","5","This cookies were very good. We alway try to make small cookies because we have young kids, I would not make cookies smaller than one inch. If you make them smaller, the candy won't fit right in the middle. I did unwrap and freeze the peanut butter cups before using."
"4","5","How can you not love this cookie? I've been baking these for years. If you want to whip some out and don't have time to make the dough, you can buy pre made refrigerated dough. They taste delicious either way. I've made them with all kinds of cookie dough, they are sooooo good. Try chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate chip, chocolate peanut butter chip and sugar cookie dough. It's one of my favorite cookie recipes."
"4","4","These cookies were pretty easy to make and they were good. I used a cookie scoop and got 44 cookies from this batch. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and I froze the PB cups ahead of time. I baked them for longer that the 8 minutes because my oven was set to 350 for other things I was baking. They still turned out good. There was one tray that gave me trouble getting out of the pans. A few edges ripped apart. It wasn't a big deal. These are VERY rich cookies. One or 2 is plenty! A recipe worth keeping in my recipe box :-)"
"4","2","I don't know what the big deal is, these were just not that good. I followed the directions, and like some other reviewers got some cracking in the cookie portion which wouldn't matter if they tasted good. Instead I found myself wanting either a peanut butter cup or a peanut butter cookie, and together they were less than the sum of their parts. I will say this recipe has the base for a darn tasty and crunchy peanutbutter cookie, but it's simply not good."
"4","5","Melt in your mouth goodness. These a the ultimate indulgence if you love peanut butter."
"4","5","Wow, these were amazing! I followed everyones advice, by freezing the peanut butter cups before putting them in! They melted perfectly into the cookie, and everyone couldn't stop eating them! They just melted right in your mouth, and they were so soft and chewy! Thank you!"
"4","5","Easy to make - and delicious!!"
"4","5","AMAZING!!! Everyone i made these for LOVED them"
"4","3","No one who tasted these thought they were all that exceptional. My first batch I made the cookies a little too small so for the second batch I made them larger and that was better. I had about 30 PB cups so for the last 12 or so I used Hershey Kisses. I thought these were just so-so. The hint to make the PB cups cold prior to using was invaluable. They were much easier to peel than if they were at room temp."
"4","5","Great recipe!! I followed the recipe and they were great and I am a bad in the kitchen :( but I can cook these!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!"
"4","5","FABULOUS!!"
"4","5","These are delicious, and definitely a crowd pleaser. This made 36 for me (cause i ate some of the dough) and I was 3 cups short, so I added some chocolate chips in the ones that didnt have pb cups."
"4","4","Well everybody who tried these babies loved them. me not so much. idk why. The dough is very soft, even after sitting in the frigde. I had to let the baked cookies sit in the frigde so i could take them out of the pan. they fell apart in my hands. So not sure if i'll make them again for myself, but i know everyone else will be happy if i did."
"4","5","Delish and super easy! I followed the recipie as is and they turned out perfect!"
"4","5","I made these for my kids today and they LOVED them. A little too heavy for my taste but im the only one in my family who thinks so. Thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","These were great! I think I could have baked the cookies for a few minutes longer though. Freezing the peanut butter cups first worked out great! I will definitely be making these in the future!"
"4","4","These were a huge hit at church. Overall, I've had better cookies, but they were still very good. I made them as normal on a cookie sheet, which made the cups hard to press in, but it worked fine in the end."
"4","5","These little morsels are absolutely great. I make them all the time. They are the first to go at any gathering and so easy to make."
"4","4","These were very good. The first time, I made them as directed but felt they needed a little something more. The second time, I rolled the dough in sugar before baking them and they were perfect."
"4","2","VERY, VERY GOOD"
"4","5","You can't go wrong with these delightful treats!!! I did check out the other reviews first for some helpful hints like freezing pb cups first and also putting in the refridgerator after baking. Only thing is I wish I would have had more mini muffin pans! Fast easy and well worth it!!"
"4","5","These came out really delicious! They're super easy to make although you will want to have a BIG glass of milk on hand because these are also really rich."
"4","5","MAKE IT EASIER: use pre-made sugar dough, 2 ingredients! bake in small paper cupcake liners for 8 min, stick in pbcup, done, cook 2 min more. DONE"
"4","5","These were a huge hit!"
"4","4","the kids love these - must have milk with these :O)"
"4","5","These cookies were a hit at my husband's office exchange! I sent in a few different cookies, but this one was the best by far. People who love the chocolate/peanut butter combo will love this cookie for sure. It was one of the simplest to make this year also. Thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","These cookies are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. These are the perfect cookie for any peanut butter fan in your life - a new favorite!! The muffin pan idea was neat - never done that before, but the perfect pan for the pb cups. Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!"
"4","5","I used to make a very similar cookie using sugar cookie dough. When I saw this recipe I just had to try it and Wow! is it fantastic!! Super easy to make and unbelievably delicious!"
"4","3","The 5 I was able to get out of the pan were wonderful. The rest split in a ring about half way down leaving the bottoms and the chocolate in the pan and me with a giant mess."
"4","5","This recipe is awesome. I keep having to make more and more because everyone loves these cookies so much."
"4","4","These cookies were great, a little too sweet for me. I baked them a little longer than 8 minutes, they didn't look brown enough so I baked for 10 minutes and they came out just fine. Probably a recipe I would make again, but not often since they were so sweet."
"4","5","I made these for thanksgiving and everyone loved them even better than the pie! I agree with some of the other reviewers that you must refridgerate the pb-cups unwrapped before you press them into the hot cookies. thanks!"
"4","5","I froze the PB cups and it seemed to work really well. Very good and will definitely make them again. I doubled the recipe and it made 100."
"4","5","These were such delish cookies! I have pretty brutal friends who love to offer constructive criticism. This time around they didn't have one thing to say. I altered the recipe a bit. I don't have a sweet tooth, so I decreased the white and brown sugar to 1/3 cup. I also increased the peanut butter to 3/4 of a cup. Note: The peanut butter cups will eventually soften after pressing them into the cookie, but if you let it sit an hour, it should harden. I used a silicone cookie spoon to gauge the size of the ball."
"4","5","I thought this recipe was easy enough to make. It did not specify how big the size of the 40 balls should be, which I thought would have been helpful to end up with all 40 of them. I inadvertently purchased white chocolate peanut butter cups but used them anyway and sprinkled red sugar on the tops when they were still hot. It gave them a pretty Christmasy look... I'll make these again for next weeks Christmas party. Thanks for the easy great recipe."
"4","5","This is practically the recipe off the back of the bag. Just don't be impatient like me....I added the PB cups before I baked them. :( Too late to save them...still edible but not presentable for gifts. :("
"4","5","perfect...awsome recipie, dough in freezer for hour, along with cups.....love it"
"4","5","ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I've been baking for MANY years and these cookies are AMAZING! The recipe is written PERFECTLY and there is no need to change anything! Thank you SO MUCH for providing a new 'keeper' for my Christmas baking agenda! THESE ARE FABULOUS!"
"4","5","These cookies are phenominal! First off, the dough is VERY soft. Refrigerating the dough for a couple hours helped tremendously in firming it up. I also took the advise to freeze the PB cups. 8 minutes was the perfect baking time. I added seasonal sprinkles after pressing the PB cups into warm cookies. After refrigerating the baked cookies for a few minutes, I used a toothpick to help 'pop' the cookie out of the tin. I rolled approx. 1' balls and it made 66 small cookies. They are so delishious! My husbands comment 'they are so soft and delicate it's like they just came out of the oven'. Not too bad considering they had been cooling on the counter for several hours! Enjoy this recipe - it's worth it!"
"4","5","The easiest, best way to a peanutbutter and chocolate lovers heart (which I am) I will be using this recipe over and over... LOVED IT!!!!"
"4","5","This was my first time making these and they were pretty easy and yummy. Not overly sweet like some that I have tasted. Will def be making these again and the cookie is pretty decent by itself too. Thanks for sharing :)"
"4","5","Well, let me just add my 5 star review of these sweet little gems. I took the advice of some reviews and froze the peanut butter cups before pressing into the hot cookies. It worked perfectly and cooled the cookies right down so I could easily remove them from the mini muffin tin. I used a butter knife to gently lift them out and placed them on a cooling rack. I sprinkled mine with the little red & green nonpareils and they look very festive for my Christmas cookie tray! Thanks for this great recipe."
"4","5","These are absolutely fantastic. Don't change a thing! Pop them in the freezer after baking and they are easier to remove from the mini muffin pan."
"4","5","I love this recipe! It is exceptionally easy and I always get rave reviews. My only suggestion would be to follow the bake time to a tee. The cookies may look undercooked at 8 minutes and so the normal reaction would be to bake longer. Trust me, it is not necessary and the peanut butter cups will not insert as easily and the cookie will be drier. After they cool, they brown a bit more and are the perfect consistency."
"4","5","I made these and brought them to work and everyone loved them. A similar (but not identical) recipe was on the back of Reese's cups bag so it would be interesting to compare. I didn't have creamy peanut butter because I don't like eating it ny itself on sandwiches but my extra crunchy peanut butter worked fine."
"4","5","These are delicious! They were so easy to make. Make sure you have more than one mini muffin pan though, it took me forever with just the one pan I had. My husband loved them!"
"4","5","these cookies are soo good! my boyfriends favourite food in the world is reese's peanut butter cups and i can't wait for him to get home and try these because he is going to go nuts for them! i made the recipe as written and got about 36 cookies but mine may have been a little bigger. Great recipe everyone who likes peanut butter should try these! yum yummy yum!!!"
"4","5","Delish!!! These were a big hit!"
"4","5","YUM!! I used regular muffin tins and regular sized PB cups. I used about 2 tsps of dough and they came out great. If you use this method it takes 4 of the 8 pack of PB cups for one batch."
"4","5","Everyone loves these cookies! They are fairly easy and I have never had any problems following the recipe as written. I have made these several times, and everyone raves over them. Great for the holidays, but they are perfect any time of year. I will always use this particular recipe for these cookies, thank you for sharing :)"
"4","5","Excellent! Just what I was looking for. I made these cookies on a cookie sheet instead of a mini muffin pan. I also used Kisses instead of Reeses cups. Instead of just plain sugar, I rolled half of the cookies in a cinnamon/sugar mixture. The cinnamon ones are the best! The combination of cinnamon, peanut butter, and milk chocolate puts them over the top!"
"4","5","Definitely a 5 star cookie! I followed the directions exact except for the cooking method. I just rolled the dough into balls and used a regular cookie sheet. It made 30 (5 down 3 across on 2 sheets). While the cookies were baking I unwrapped the candy and stuck them in the freezer. This made it easier to push into the cookie and they didn't melt as much. Also, it's important to not touch the cookies for at least 20 or 30 minutes....just leave them on the sheet until they cool before trying to move them."
"4","5","These are fantastic, I got given 100 peanut butter cups as a gift, I cut them into 1/4's and they work just as well. I didn't even wait for them to cool down before passing them around!"
"4","5","These were very good! I baked for 10 mins instead of 8 mins because I used a dark non-stick pan---they turned out exactly like the picture. I'll definitely make these again."
"4","5","YUM! Easy and cute. I froze the PB cups so they would be easier to handle and then once baked I put the muffin tin in the fridge until cool enough to pop the cookies out. Will be on our regular cookie rotation!"
"4","3","This recipe was difficult to get it to work just right. I was able to make 27 cookies and not 40. The recipe does not say how big to make them, so I just used a cookie scoop. I baked an extra minute more than requested and they were still very raw. I added the peanut butter cups though, to keep with the directions. Once cooled, they did not harden up with the heat of the pan and just fell apart when I tried to remove them. So, I put them back in the oven at 375 for about 5-7 minutes. At that point they seemed more coooked and did remove okay once cooled. However, with the time and difficulty I had with a simple cookie I would not make them again. In addition, they tasted like a peanut butter cookie and a piece of candy. The ingredients didn't mingle into something different, and they were also way too greasy for my taste! Nice idea though."
"4","5","Loved the recipe.Made for my son and husband lunches for the week, but the cookies didnt last but only 2 days. Will definately be making agian.. thanks"
"4","5","I made these for a DAR meeting and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. I did freeze the peanut butter cups as was suggested and used the paper cups. I used a leveled tablespoon measuring spoon of dough in each cup. That was exactly enough and the recipe made 40 cookies."
"4","5","made this for xmas was good"
"4","5","Being these are my secret weapon every year around christmas time I had to give this a 5. I discovered this recipe about 4 yrs ago on this site and I always get such amazing reviews from them, I usually add either dark chocolate hershey kisses on top (instead of PB Cups) or Hershey PB choc kisses (not sure if theyre special edition)....I also put each batch out of the oven right into the freezer (on a separate plate) for about 5 minutes so that the candies on top dont melt in the hot cookies. Best recipe ever!"
"4","5","FABULOUS! These cookies are so good! I made them exactly as the recipe recommended. ...and like the others have mentioned, 8 minutes is the PERFECT cooking time!"
"4","5","Perfect for PB Lovers! First batch just got out of the oven and they are so good! I followed directions exactly except didn't have mini muffin pans so just used a cookie sheet with the mini muffin papers - worked great. Paper peels right off and you can bake a lot at once! My husband thinks they are too PB-y so I am making the next batch with Hershey's Kiss'. I think they are a great treat!"
"4","5","i didnt use the mini muffin tins for these....rolled into ball and baked...when out of the oven pushed the peanut butter cup into the cookie ball...not too deep or they will break in half...then placed cookie sheet in refrig to harden the melting chocolate....after set took out of refrig and wrapped up for gift giving...test tasters all loved these..."
"4","5","I made this recipe for this past Thanksgiving and they were a hit! I took the advice of the other reviewers and before I popped the cookies in the oven, I unwrapped and froze the peanut butter cups then immediately put them in each finished cookie once the cookies were baked. Then I put The whole pan in the freezer for a few more minutes to stop the PB cups from melting any further (because despite how chilled they were, they still melted!) They were perfect for the little kiddies running around who love finger foods and for the adults who loved peanut butter!"
"4","5","Torture...I am on a diet so I couldn't actually eat any of these but I hear they were awesome. I doubled the recipe, and used reduced sugar peanut butter, it worked perfectly. I teach confirmation on Sunday's and my kids couldn't get enough of them this morning!!!"
"4","5","these cookies were a cinch to make and so delicious. After unwrapping the peanut butter cups I put them in the freezer so that it would be easier to push in the middle of the cookie. I will be sure to make these again. I also melted peanut butter and drizzled it on top of the peanut butter cup."
"4","5","Very good cookie .. easy to make. I used hershey's kisses instead of the peanut butter cup."
"4","5","These cookies are awesome!!! I made them with a peanut M&M instead of a peanut butter cup because I didnt have any and they still turned out great!!!"
"4","5","Very yummy, i'm not a big peanut butter fan (I know weird) but for sure i know my husband will love these and ask me to make them again! I made these to take them to him while he is training at school and for sure his buddies will like these! I froze the peanut butter cups like everyone else said and everything came out right so easy! Thank you for this recipe!"
"4","5","This is the same recipe as the Peanut Blossoms I've been making for at least 25 years every Christmas. It's my kids' favorite. The cookie is just fabulous - tender and incredibly tasty. The only difference is that this recipe uses peanut butter cups in place of Hershey Kisses. The upside of that is that this version is WAY easier to store in a cookie canister! The tops of the kisses always used to break off when they were stacked, even in off-set rows somehow, in the container. These stay nice and flat and look smashing. I roll the dough in coarse sugar (which you can buy anyplace that sells cake decorating supplies) for added sparkle. After putting the peanut butter cup/Hershey Kiss into the cookie, I always return it to the oven for 2 minutes more, which sets the candy in place so that it doesn't come off the cookie when jostled accidentally on a tray or in the container, and the very slight melting that takes place makes for an attractive sheen - get your cameras ready. A+ for an outstanding new twist on an old favorite!!"
"4","5","I made these for our annual cookie day exchange and they were a huge hit!! I ate most of them, haha!"
"4","5","Wow these cookies were sent from the heavens, they are so delicious and decadent. They come out much better when they are cooked in muffin pans versus a cookie sheet. These will become regular holiday cookies for us, I will have to bake another batch tomorrow to send to family and friends."
"4","5","These were very good! I did freeze the peanut butter cups first and after putting them in the cookies i put the entire tray immediately in the refridgerator to avoid melting. Had to make a second batch since the first one was gone so quickly!"
"4","5","These cookies are very good and easy to make. I put them in the refrigerator a few minutes after they bake. When you take them out of the muffin pan, give them a gentle twist and they will come out perfect."
"4","5","Just made these this afternoon. I've been wanting to try them for a long time. Peanut butter cookies are one of my favorites and I love, love, love peanut butter cups, so what a great combo right?   The cookies are easy to make, but the dough is pretty soft, so instead of rolling them into balls, I just scooped out some dough, dropped it into the mini-muffin cup and pressed it down into the cup some, which worked out fine. The only thing I found was that I got a lot more than 40 cookies, I got about 50 and could have gotten more as I filled some of the muffin cups too full."
"4","1","I'm sorry but we didn't like them at all. After the first batch, baked them 5 minutes longer but the result was the same. They were extremely buttery, pasty, like cookie dough."
"4","5","I entered these in my State Fair and they won first prize! To make them a little more interesting-looking, I waited until the peanut butter cup had melted a bit then pushed in a white chocolate chip (pointy side down) so they had the look of bullseyes. Really cute! These are definitely rich, but out of this world good. Definitely underbake them a bit, since crisp ones are not nearly as good."
"4","5","I didn't have a mini muffin pan so I just used a cookie sheet, they didn't come out as pretty but oh my goodness..taste freaking amazing! I unwrapped the pb cups and put them in the freezer while the dough was chilling in the fridge. I also put the trays into the freezer immediately after putting the pb cup in. I'll definitely make them again and again."
"4","5","I increased the peanut butter by 1 Tablespoon & reduced milk to 1-1/2 Tablespoons - also when i started making the dough, I popped the bag of PB cups in the freezer and it was plenty of time to get them good and cold so they hold shape.  When I put the dough in to cook, I took the cups out and started unwrapping - it took almost the whole 6-8 minute baking time to unwrap them.  The recipe made 24 in a mini muffin pan and 6 large ones in a regular muffin liner. Next time I will double it to account for the dough I ate!  I made 24 in a mini muffin pan then with the rest of the dough put larger balls in muffin liners on a cookie sheet - the larger ones turned out the best with the best shape.  I did a very light spritz w/ baking spray on the muffin pan, otherwise they would have been difficult to remove.  I also popped them in the fridge to cool as suggested - left them in there for about 20 minutes then cooled for an hour at room temp before trying to remove.  Next time I will use the large muffin liners for all of them and reduce the butter by at least 1 Tablespoon - the extra pb gave a little too much oil.  I used light chunky peanut butter and they were excellent. Highly recommended recipe - thank you for posting this!"
"4","5","This recipe was absolutely the best cookie recipe I have ever had or made. very simple to make. I used a cookie sheet because I didn't have a mini muffin pan and they still came out great. I also added more peanut butter than the recipe calls for due to previous reviews. Do freeze the PB cups prior to using much easier to unwrap them without them falling apart. DO TRY THIS ONE!!!!"
"4","5","Sinful! Very addictive. I made this already easy recipe a little easier by using Pillsbury refridgerated chocolate chip cookie dough in place of all the other ingredients. Just cut the cookie dough log into 12 equal slices, and cut each slice in half. Roll each half into a ball and plop it into the mini muffin tin (GREASED AND FLOURED). You have to make sure you change the cooking temp. from 375 to 350, as the cookie dough package directions state. And then just like this recipe says, bake for 8-9 minutes, and immediately place a reese cup into each cookie. I did take others advice and froze the reese cups before using them. This helped them not to melt. I think the chocolate chip cookie dough was a fantastic touch, and solved other reviewers problems of a 'bland cookie dough'. YUM!"
"4","4","very good and moist, I will definitely make them again."
"4","5","These are a hit at our home. My hubby really loves these. :o) I'm not a big peanut butter fan, these were ok. I make these a couple of times a year. Thank you for my hubby's favorite cookie recipe. :o)"
"4","5","This was absolutely devine! My family and friends consumed these cookies in less than a day. I rolled the cookies in sugar as one reader mentioned to make them crunchy and when they were done stuck them in the freezer for 10 minutes to keep the chocolate from running. They came out perfectly!!"
"4","5","Fantastic cookies! Made them in regular muffin tins, rolled in balls first, and they turned out great! Cooked them for about 8-9 minutes and pressed the chocolate in about 1 minute after they came out of the oven (if you did it right away, the chocolate melted too much and ran a little- not that that was a bad thing!) Also, rolled them in sugar after rolling them into balls- gave them a nice look and crunch."
"4","5","What a great cookie! I followed the recipe except using splenda instead of white sugar and sugar free p.b. cups. Because I wanted to lay out all the cups so I could bake them quickly, I did not have enough mini muffin pans so I also tried a baking sheet with a few of them. Seeing how they both turned out, the mini muffin cups worked much better than the cookie sheet so use those if you can choose. Also, I did not want to buy so many p.b. cups so I pressed butterscotch chips and m&m type candies into some of them which worked out great as well, as long as both were frozen before pressing into the cookies. Very adaptable cookie and quick to make. Be sure to bake only 8 minutes and let cool in the tins before removing. I put mine in the freezer for a few minutes so the chocolate would not melt and they popped out easily."
"4","5","I made these cookies for Valentine's Day. I used Reece's Peanut Butter Hearts then put the cookies in the fridge so the heart would keep it's shape. They were really cute- my boyfriend loved them!"
"4","5","Excellent cookies. I should have doubled the recipe!"
"4","5","AMAZING AMAZING. COULDNT GIVE A BETTER REVIEW FOR THIS RECIPE. MY HUBBY COULDNT GET ENOUGH. HIS ENTIRE WORK CREW ASKED ME TO MAKE A BATCH FOR THEM."
"4","5","I need to quadruple this recipe because my kids invite the world over to eat them!! They're GREAT"
"4","5","This recipe was very easy to make. I had no trouble with the dough, rolled up pretty easy. To get them out I waited till they were completely cool and turned them slightly and popped them out with a spoon. I may add an extra tablespoon of milk to moisten it up a bit more. I also like the idea of rolling in sugar then baking. yum!  I did not have the mini muffin pan but did use regualr size. The yield was about 20 cookies."
"4","5","VERY GOOD! i made them for a small get together and it was a hit. easy to cook but has a great result."
"4","5","These were really good. Make note though- keep the cookies in the tin when pushing the peanut butter cups in and let them cool before taking out. I copied the recipe down and missed that part, but realized soon what was going wrong."
"4","5","These were such a hit! I've already been informed by friends and family that I will be making these each and every year! I used some of the advice I read on this site like using Skippy PB and putting the cookies in the fridge after baking. They definitely helped. I also tried a sugar free version with Splenda and sugar free Recees' cups. You could hardly tell the difference!"
"4","5","This is sooo good. Easy to make and easy to eat! Use green and red jimmies for a festive cookie."
"4","5","These are really good and very easy to make. A different way to enjoy a peanut butter-chocolate cookie! Yummy!!"
"4","4","Good, but they are a little harder than I'd hoped. I've also made this style of cookie using store bought peanut butter cookie dough - I know it's cheating, but it sure is quick and easy."
"4","5","These are to die for!!! They came out perfectly...nice and chewy and oh-so-tasty! I plan to make these for my children's teachers this year as Christmas gifts. 5 stars all the way!!!  One tip...be sure to let the cookies cool all the way before removing from pan, otherwise you will have a chocolately mess."
"4","5","My husband and son loved these. Very tasty. In order to make some sprinkles stick to the tops, I pressed in the peanut butter cups and then returned the pan to the oven for 30 seconds to soften the chocolate on top. I then removed them and sprinkled on Christmas sprinkles. Very cute with sprinkles, kind of ordinary without."
"4","5","Very yummy and very easy and fun to make! I am a peanut butter junkie, so I am always looking for new recipes. I decorated the tops of the cookies with Christmas colored sprinkles. They look very nice on my cookie tray. Will definitely be making again!"
"4","5","I just made these, instead of peanut butter I used half a cup of melted milk chocolate chips, and 2 tablespoon of cocoa, and instead of peanut butter cups, I used the new Kisses (caramel, peanut butter, cherry cordial, mint). These turned out PERFECT with red and green sprinkles on top. I only wish I had doubled the recipe and made more, but I will definitely be making more on Sunday to take to work with me! I baked them for 9m30s in 375 degree oven, with a sheet of foil on a rack below. Great recipe!!"
"4","5","Christmas, 'Brown Sugar'"
"4","5","i made these before i went on a family vaca and they were a hit! my aunt absolutely loved them. also, i didnt have a mini-muffin pan, but i found that if you just place the muffin cups on a cookie sheet it still works fine--they just may spread out a little when you press the PB cup in. still fabulous though!"
"4","5","These were absolutely wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and used the mini muffin tray. The cookie was so soft, and the peanut butter cups stayed soft and melty even after they cooled! My boyfriend and I both took a batch of these to work, and everyone loved them....there were none left! Will definitely put this in my permanent recipe box, thanks! :)"
"4","5","These are by far the BEST peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted. They are easy to make and look excellent. I didn't change anything to the recipe except the cook time. The first batch I cooked for 8 min. and the bottoms were really brown so I cooked the next batch for 7 min. and they were perfect. This is a great cookie recipe."
"4","5","These cookies were a hit!! And froze well too!"
"4","5","'Holy cow' is what my fiancee said when he tried one. Absolutley one of the top cookies I've ever made. Will definitely make again & again."
"4","5","This has become my favorite chocolate / peanut butter cookie recipe, and I make them every Christmas. I do use a bit more reduced fat peanut butter(Jif brand, and yes, still tastes yummy), and I cooled the cookies in the freezer to help with cooling time, and they turned out great! Definitely freeze the pb cups, unwrap them, and place back in the freezer until ready to press into cookies. Do not overbake these cookies; they are done after 8 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"4","5","My mother left all of us a very similar cookie as her legacy...however, in true 'Mama' fashion, she used a cake mix for her's! :o) In case anyone is pressed for time, here is her version: 1 c smooth peanut butter, 1 box yellow cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/4 c water, 1/4 c oil, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 2 bags of peanut butter cups. Preheat your oven to 350. Whisk oil, water, vanilla, and egg together until frothy. Stir in peanut butter and cake mix until well-blended. Roll walnut-sized balls of dough between your hands and place in mini-muffin tins. Bake for 10 minutes. Place a peanut butter cup in center of cookie while hot. Put in fridge! I'll give yours a shot tonight, thanks for the genuinely homemade variation!"
"4","5","Fabulous!! Made these and everyone went nuts...chocolate and peanut butter just belong together! I did place a 1 inch cookie scoop of dough into mini cupcake papers instead of placing the dough into the mini muffin pan itself. Easier to get out of the pan...especially when you have a gooey peanut butter cup melting on a hot cookie. They were so tasty and worth every calorie!"
"4","4","I made these cookies for my boyfriend, who loves peanut butter cookies. He really enjoyed them! My suggestion is that if you don't have a mini muffin pan, get one. I had one and I used it but I also used a cookie sheet too. The bad thing about using a cookie sheet is when you put the peanut butter cup on the cookie, the cookie is guaranteed to crack! Then it becomes incredibly messy while eating. Nevertheless, it was a great recipe! Thank you!"
"4","4","These are tasty and attractive for cookie trays at Christmas. My recommendation is to make the balls at least 1' in diameter (size of walnut), because if you make them too small, the PB cup sticks up too much. I used the PB cups from Walmart, so those are a little bigger than Reese's anyway. Don't overbake these, either. I liked the presentation better with the little paper liners."
"4","5","Awesome cookies. Kid's loved them. Super Easy to make. I cut my mini peanut butter cup candy in half before I put them on the cookies and thought that they were great!"
"4","5","These are the best! I've made extra dough and have it in the freezer, ready to thaw & bake if we have a get together. Everyone loves 'em. Thanks!"
"4","5","I made these for a family gathering and everyone went crazy for them. I made a double recipee and they still all got eaten. The recipee says it makes 40 cookies but mine came out to about 32 cookies per batch. It helps to buy a double size mini-muffin tin so you get them all done faster."
"4","4","This was a great little cookie! I substituted 1/2 cup of cocoa for 1/2 cup of the flour to make a chocolate cookie dough. It was very tasty!"
"3","5","I make these at least 5 times a year and they never disappoint. I've run out of peanut butter cups and substituted Lindt Lindor Sea Salt truffles cut in half and they were awesome!"
"3","5","This recipe is SO GOOD! The cookies are perfect. My family can't get enough! From past reviews, I made the balls about 3/4 of an inch. 8 minutes worked perfectly for me. A tip is to freeze the reese's peanut butter cups or even stick them in the fridge prior to inserting them into the cookie. After taking the cookies out of the oven, I gave it a couple minutes to 'settle' before sticking in the peanut butter cups. One of them melted completely in the cookie (was just liquid milk chocolate)- so stick the pan in the fridge for 15 minutes after inserting them to prevent this from happening. So good, and they came right out of the pan for me PERFECTLY- didn't use liners, spray or butter etc. In my case at least, nothing like this would be necessary. this recipe is definitely worth it. so easy to bring to events, etc and has such nice presentation! thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"3","5","No problems at all with recipe as written. Eight minutes was perfect. Definitely freeze the peanut butter cups. In fact, I used both chocolate and white chocolate, and I unwrapped the chocolate ones before putting in the freezer, and as an afterthought I threw a bag (unwrapped) of white chocolate in the freezer the evening before I planned on making the cookies. They were much easier to unwrap when frozen. I used a 1-1/4' cookie scoop, which made the process VERY easy and got 52 balls out of one batch of dough. I used mini paper muffin cups and did not have to worry about them coming out of the pan. I let the cookie rest in the pan directly out of the oven for just a couple of minutes before putting in the frozen p.b.cup, and had no trouble with the cookies cracking. A few minutes later, after they had melted, I sprinkled colored jimmies on top."
"3","5","I loved this recipe because of the perfect texture and flavor to it, like the nice chewy peanut butter cookie on the outside, and the soft, gooey center! These cookies were super simple to make, and they can work for bringing to youth group, to a friends house, or even just as a snack!"
"3","5","Really a nice and tasty peanut butter cookie! I used a regular cookie sheet and never had any problems.I put the peanut butter cup in cookie after they come out of oven,and let thm cool.Thanks Buchko for really nice treat*****"
"3","5","These have become a family tradition on Christmas at our house. Kisses chocolate can be easily substituted for the peanut butter cups. Just make sure to freeze the chocolate before placing it on the hot cookie otherwise it will melt. I don't know how these taste after a few days because they always disappear the same day"
"3","4","These cookie cups were delicious! I left the recess cups in the freezer so they wouldn't melt once you press it onto the cookie. And after I put the cookie cups on the fridge for about 5 minutes so the recess cups wouldn't melt and they came out perfect. 8 minutes to cook wasn't enough time for me. I left it in the oven for about 12 minutes. I can't wait to bake it again!"
"3","5","Required Christmas cookie but good all year round."
"3","5","A lot of work, but so good!"
"3","5","Really good. After reading other reviews I refrigerated the dough about an hour before scooping into the tins. Also froze the peanut butter candy. Will be making these again soon."
"3","5","I am just now commenting on this recipe but have been making them for 2-3 yrs... They have become one of the annual Christmas Cookie's that will forevermore be on the Christmas Cookie LIST!!! Everyone that has one has become victim and craves them year round. Thank you"
"3","5","The kids loved them. I used tassie pans and cupcake liners. And also froze the Reese's. Not one problem.  ALWAYS READ REVIEWS!!! srider1962"
"3","5","Wow."
"3","3","Good, but I prefer pb blossoms. Needs more chocolate."
"3","5","they are good just looking at them makes me hungry mmmmm"
"3","5","Great, simple cookie! I did freeze the reese cups and they were very easy to push into the cookie. They will not look done after 8 minutes, don't let that fool you. Be sure to cool completely before trying to remove from pan or they will mush together. I'll be making these as gifts-thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","I tried out a bunch of new recipes over the holidays and this was by far my favourite. I didn't have a mini muffin pan but I baked them on parchment lined cookie sheets and they worked fine. A few of them did crack a little when I put the peanut butter cups in but that just meant I had to eat those ones as I couldn't give them as gifts! Delicious!"
"3","5","LOVED THEM!!!! I made these for the family and we loved them so much that we now make them for family but I cheated when I went to the store and could not find peanut butter cups so I just got my favorite chocolate and melted it!! improvise! but it is really good with peanut butter cups too!"
"3","5","Oh my goodness - perfection! I followed the recipe exactly, heeding the following advice from reviewers: freeze pb cups after unwrapping, bake for only 8 minutes (my mini muffin pans are black, so I decreased the oven temp to 350), cool until the middles 'sink' before putting the pb cups in the middle. Best peanut butter cookies ever!"
"3","5","Loved it! I don't have a mini-muffin pan so I just used a regular pan and it worked great. I actually made the dough last night and had it in the fridge overnight so it was really cold this morning. I took it out to soften a little bit before making the dough balls while I unwrapped the PB cups to put in the freezer (this is a must do!) I had a few in the first batch that stuck completely to the pan and I think it's because I tried to take them out before they had completely cooled. I ran a toothpick around to help loosen ones that were a bit stuck and they came right out. My tips are to freeze the pb cups, and then after baking stick the entire pan in the freezer to cool. Don't try to remove them until they are completely cooled. I don't care about cracked edges so I don't even attempt to fix that. I LOVE these, they are so delicious and make great gifts. They are definitely cuter when you use a mini-muffin pan, but the taste is the same regardless. ;) Also, I got 36 cookies out of the recipe by using a tablespoon measuring spoon to measure my balls."
"3","5","I looked up peanut butter cookies, and these were top rated. I see why!  There are two things I would edit, however.  1) The 'cream stuff until fluffy' is a bit misleading. It didn't become fluffy as much as incredibly well mixed.  2) There needs to be an indicated size to the balls of dough. Mine turned out quite small, and so my bag of peanut butter cups ran out before the cookies did. 8 mins worked okay on the smaller balls, but I suspect they'll be better next time when I make them a bit larger.  Seems like a ball that's peeking over the top of the minimuffin pan would work well."
"3","5","I have made this recipe many times, love it!! I must admit that when I am rushed, I have made these using the purchased Toll House dough squares (24 PER PKG). I drop the dough into the prepared tartlet pans, bake for 6 minutes, add the PB cups and continue baking for 3-4 minutes, or until done. Sometimes I add Rick's butter cream frosting, from this site! They look just like those expensive purchased cookie cups!"
"3","5","Awesome. Don't change a thing, these are perfect and delicious."
"3","3","These tasted very good, but I had trouble removing from the pans. So they broke apart when I treied. Next time I try, I will definitely spray the pans first."
"3","5","I think these are my new favorite cookie! I followed the directions exactly (without using any added tips) and didn't have any problems with cracking, my PB cups falling apart, or getting them out of the pan. Sooo good! (P.S. I have to laugh when people say 'I followed the recipe *except* I did this instead, like using a regular muffin pan. So no, you did not follow the recipe, hence your cookies not turning out... Just sayin')"
"3","5","Had never made these before and what a hit! I did refrigerate the dough for a little before rolling into balls. These didn't make it a day in my house and had to make two more batches!"
"3","5","We had a 'bake off' tonight at my house and these cookies won! I had some caramel rolos and hershey's bell-shaped chocolates along with the reese's cups that I used for the centers. VERY good."
"3","5","WOW, these are absolutely incredible. Followed the recipe as is with one minor change. I followed the suggestion of someone else and used Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups. It went from decadent to outrageous. I would offer two suggestions. One, before you start the mixing and baking process, unwrap the miniture cups (which ever flavor use choose) and place them on a plate and stick the in the refridgerator to cool. This way they are easy to handle when inserting them in the baked dough and being cool they don't melt and run all over the hot dough. Secondly don't fix more than two miniture muffin tins at a time as any more will result in the cooked dough not being as pliable as you will have too many to insert miniture cups into before the dough starts to firm up. But on the other hand these won't last more than 20 minutes anyway after they're fixed......"
"3","5","These are very good-always a big hit! One suggestion for those of you who want a fun treat such as these but want to SPEED THE PROCESS and jazz them up some, try using ready made cookie dough. I have made these using the rolled refrigerated cookie dough many times and they turn out OH so YUMMY! I always use small paper cup liners in the mini muffin pan to make the cookies look more festive. In additon, I coarsly chop peanuts and place them on top of each peanut butter cup (when cookies are done baking, after you have added the peanut butter cup, return them to the oven for a minute to melt the top of the peanut butter cup- remove and sprinkle with nuts). Another combination to try is sugar cookies and snickers. Once sugar cookies are done baking, place bottom-side up mini Snickers (flat bottom holds M&M's better) then add three different colored M&M candies on top of each Snicker... Chocolate chip cookies and broken up York Peppermint patties; the possibilities are endless. Young children can help unwrap the peanut butter cups (or whatever you choose to use). Everyone, I mean EVERYONE, loves these!!!"
"3","5","These are great!! My whole family loved them! They were really salty the first time I made them so the next time I put in 1/4 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 tsp. It may be because I use regular butter instead of unsalted. They were perfect the second time!"
"3","5","Very easy to make and good too."
"3","5","These cookies were really delicious out of the oven and stayed fresh and soft for another week in Tupperware containers. When I pressed the peanut butter cups in right after pulling them from the oven they melted all over however. So I waited a couple of minutes and while they were still warm pressed in the frozen peanut butter cup."
"3","5","Was great. I used a cookie sheet, no problem with that. I unwrapped cups, froze them and pop them into cookies. I also used kisses point down and made faces with M&Ms. All were great. Thanks for the recipe."
"3","5","Awesome cookies! :)"
"3","4","These turned out well. I also just used a cookie sheet. I thought they were good, but not aMAZing, but everyone I gave them to kept raving about them."
"3","5","Follow exactly and you will have a most brilliant, mouth watering, peanut butter cookie!! this recipe is so so so good! It needs no changes and you don't have to have a mini muffin pan. I used a regular cookie sheet!"
"3","5","Family favorite!"
"3","5","Great! I added a spoonful of nutella to the batter and they turned out great"
"3","3","Time consuming but taste good."
"3","5","very good cookie"
"3","5","Loved them"
"3","3","I made these over Christmas and although they turned out beautiful, the dough was the perfect consistency and they came out of the pan with ease, I really didn't care for them. Maybe because there wasn't enough chocolate for me. I'll stick with the old recipe with the Hershey kiss stuck in the middle of a peanut butter cookie."
"3","5","I love peanut butter and this is like that perfect bite that you save til the end!"
"3","5","Delicious! Made just as recipe says! Made for Christmas cookie plates! Recieved many compliments!"
"3","5","YUM! These are simple to make but they turn out so tasty and look great! YUM!  I did follow the suggestion about putting them in the fridge for a little bit after baking, it helps them pop right out of the pan. Thanks!"
"3","5","I made these today .. I followed the receipe exactly as written except that the only peanut butter we had was reduced fat and they still came out awesome! I'll definitely make these again :)"
"3","5","Rave reviews from everyone on this one!"
"3","5","I mix everything together. I immediately roll into balls and just plop into mini-muffin pan. The reeses easily push straight into them when you remove from oven. (make sure they're unwrapped and ready when you take straight from oven). I cook for 15 minutes and they're perfect every time. I wait about 30 min for them to cool. They easily lift right out of mini-muffin pan."
"3","3","Good cookie overall, they just did not turn out for me. They taste good and that part is fine but perhaps my baking execution failed. I baked them on a cookie sheet like one of the previous commenters did and mine went completely flat. Also after 2 hours now they still seemed really under cooked even though I left them in for 10 minutes. I will try to make them again because I still have a lot of mini peanut butter cups but I'm overall not very impressed by how they look. They do taste good though I must admit."
"3","5","These were easy to make and delicious!"
"3","3","just made these yesterday night, really easy to make but i didnt like them its to doughy but my boyfriend loves them. i might use my peanut butter cookie recipe and just add the cups into it or leave the cookie dough in the oven a little longer then 8 minutes."
"3","5","I love these cookies just the way they have it but I did use chunky peanut butter the second time and it just gives that extra texture to it which I absolutely love....and my husband does not like peanut butter but he eats these cookies like they are going out of style...."
"3","5","Absolutely delicious! Just finished making them and they're already nearly gone! Only thing I added was a cup of milk chocolate chips to the batter for that extra bit of chocolatey-ness. So so tasty"
"3","5","I have made these cookies 3 times now and each time I am begged to make them again. I don't bother with the muffin tin, instead I use a large cookie scoop and cookie sheets. Make sure to let them 'settle' once taken out of the oven before you put the PB cups in so the edges don't crack.  Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","Big hit!"
"3","5","I love to cook, but baking...not so much. These were the first homemade cookies I've ever made! I couldn't believe how simple the recipe was & how delicious they were. Maybe I'll bake more often :)"
"3","5","Yummy! Followed the recipe exactly. If you use dark pans, you might cook only 7 minutes -- I actually lost a few that browned too much (didn't bother me!)."
"3","5","Amazing! Look so professional. Based on previous reviews I froze the chocolates prior to adding them to cooked dough."
"3","5","This recipes was amazing, I did make some minor alterations. I substituted 2/3 cup almond meal for the 2/3 cup flour and added an extra tablespoon of Peanut butter. The cookies came out great but make sure you give them time to cool before trying to remove them from the pan, which is hard if you only have the one mini muffin pan. I would highly recommend and look forward to making it again, oh an next time I am going to double the recipe it did not make nearly enough considering how good they taste."
"3","3","These turned out perfect and were easy to make. However, I the peanut blossoms (peanut butter kiss cookies much much better!). My family agrees also! Cute but will not make again."
"3","5","These cookies are amazing! I needed a recipe to make some birthday treats and let's just say that my roommates were so jealous that they didn't get to keep them for themselves that I had to bake another batch the next day! I prefer my cookies a little gooey on the inside so I bake them for 7 instead of the 8 minutes and they are perfect."
"3","5","Absolute perfection!"
"3","5","so yummy!! easy too! my husband ate an entire plate by himself!!"
"3","1","I thought they were very dry cookies to be rated by others so well"
"3","5","I substituted buttery flavored Crisco for the shortening....made them chewier and better, I think."
"3","5","These were great! I baked them until they fluffed up, then shoved Reese's cups into them. Perfect and easy!"
"3","5","These are so yummy. I brought them to work and they were gone in no time."
"3","4","Pretty good. I baked for 8 minutes, removed them from the oven then stuck the cups in (after freezing the cups) and through them in the freezer to cool for about 7 minutes."
"3","3","I followed the recipe, but I fail to see what all the fuss is about. They are very labor-intensive, but you could just eat peanut butter cookies and peanut butter cups and get the same effect."
"3","5","Great peanut butter cookie. Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using a cookie sheet instead of the mini-muffin tray. Edges did crack but they still held together well (did not crumble)."
"3","5","These never last long in my house they are so yummy"
"3","5","Surprised everyone with these....they thought they were getting hershey kiss cookies!!! These are delicious!"
"3","5","These were a hit a Christmas! Followed recipe exactly and turned out wonderful! I did use natural peanut butter so they were not overly sweet, which was a good thing! They will be on my Christmas baking list from now on!!!"
"3","5","Made these for Christmas! Absolutely delicious! Came out perfectly! Highly recommend!!!"
"3","5","YUM!!! Recipe makes a lot- have been making in batches and finally froze dough. I also added cut up peanut butter cups and chocolate chips to dough for one batch (rolled dough into balls after and baked adding peanut butter cup at end). GREAT!"
"3","4","Im not a chocolate lover but my kids liked these."
"3","5","Love this recipe, it's a keeper. thanks to who posted it."
"3","3","batter thin but good flavor"
"3","5","best cookies ever and super easy! hard to keep in the house for more than a few hours!"
"3","5","Found some 'mini' peanutbutter cups by Reeces in the candy isle. Loved how easy this was to do. Thanks for another great recipe."
"3","5","Just like the peanut butter Hershey Kiss cookies, but more delicious with mini peanut butter cups! You can use a regular cookie sheet if you don't have a mini muffin pan and they'll still turn out fine."
"3","5","Delicious! Thanks. Next time I'll make sure to let them cool completely before removing them from pan. I messed up the round shape on some. Muffin cup liners are a must!"
"3","5","My husband was not going to try these because he doesn't really like peanut butter cookies. After he polished off about 10 cookies he said they were the best cookies he ever had! They were a hit with company as well!"
"3","5","Fabulous!thanks for sharing"
"3","5","No changes for this recipe. excellent as written"
"3","5","These were delicious and very easy to make. This will be a family favorite for years to come!"
"3","5","Made as directed, refrigerated the pb cups, unwrapped and ready to go when the cookies came out. I did bake them one minute longer for a little more color. Delicious and dangerous!"
"3","5","Almost didn't make these because I had to go out and buy two mini muffin pans for this recipe. The money spent on the pans was well worth it! My boyfriend loves peanut butter....he told me to make sure I keep this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly per the directions, there is nothing that I would change."
"3","5","Awesome recipe! I used a mini silicone muffin pan, had to bake it for 9 minutes because it came out too doughy, used the mini reese cups, the ones I don't have to unwrap. After reading the reviews, I made sure to freeze the reese cups and threw the cookies into the fridge for 10 minutes after. Turned out perfect!!!!"
"3","5","These cookies are great! I made them for Christmas gifts...YUMMY!"
"3","5","Yum, yum and double yum!!! Easy to make, quick to bake and delicious to eat!"
"3","5","These were very easy to make and very delicious."
"3","5","Yumm!!"
"3","5","Recipe is way easy and fun to do! I'm a very new beginner with baking so if I can do it, so can you. My coworkers and boyfriend loved them! Hard to stop eating em so be careful ;)  Important tip: Freeze peanut butter cups before pushing them into the fresh cookies. It def does help from melting right away."
"3","5","My family loves it...i also tried with caramel chocolate cup..mmmmmmmm ..thanks for the gret idea and recipe :O)"
"3","5","FANTASTIC. Works well with any kind of candy bar. We used snickers, and mini peanut butter cups. Yum!"
"3","5","These cookies are fabulous. Follow the recipe exactly and make sure to freeze your peanut butter cups. My husband had one and said, 'These won't last long.' Maybe I should make another batch. LOL!"
"3","5","Easy & delicious. I read reviews and used a cookie sheet for one batch. They spread so I won't make that mistake again (I'll just have to break down & finally get more mini muffin pans). My eight year old son helped make them & had a blast. They taste delicious!"
"3","5","Best pb cookies and what a great idea to bake them in mini muffin pans!"
"3","4","These are delicious and my kids LOVED them. I followed the advice of many and chilled the peanut butter cups before pressing them into the cookies and I cooled the pan to keep the chocolates from melting too much. The only big issue I had was taking them out of the pan. They almost all seperated in half so I had to quickly press them together again so they would stick. I followed everything to a 'T' so I don't know why this happened :("
"3","5","Follow RETROGIRL35's review tips; they will turn out perfectly. These are SO delicious! *Another tip*: If you're going to sprinkle them, make sure you wait until the PB cup melts a little after pressing it into the cookie, sprinkle, and THEN very lightly tap the sprinkles on the cup to make sure they stick before refrigerating; the sprinkles didn't stick on my first batch. Happy baking :)!"
"3","5","used about 2 teaspoons of dough per muffin cup. Baked about 8 minutes 30 seconds. Put peanut butter cups in freezer after unwrapping for about 10 minutes."
"3","5","Perfect as written! Made on cookie sheet instead of mini muffin pan, and they turned out fine. Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","Can't keep them in my kitchen. They barely survive the transfer from pan to cooling rack. :)"
"3","5","Oh so good, I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"3","5","Great recipe!! I added a little more flour because they were a bit pasty."
"3","5","YUM! Follow directions.. I only cooked mine for 7 minutes, pulled them out and popped in the frozen reeces, then put them in the fridge (in the muffin pans) for about 10 minutes before removing them. They cooked a bit longer this way and turned out a bit browner the first round. SO GOOD!"
"3","5","These were awesome! I agree that the mini muffin pan is key. Also unwrapping and freezing the cups prior helps tremendously! Everyone at work raved about these and asked for the recipe. Super easy and delicious."
"3","5","these cookies are fantastic! I brought them to a potluck and they were gone before any other dessert! thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"3","5","I am not a good baker, so I was thankful to see that these are full proof. They aren't time consuming, expensive, or challenging in any way. The only thing I'd change is to add a little more peanut butter...maybe a tablespoon or two? If you like peanut butter A LOT like I do, then you'll need a little extra."
"3","5","I used store bought peanut butter cookie dough. Everyone loved them! Great recipe."
"3","5","wouldn't change a thing in this recipe."
"3","4","This was a great recipe! I had a problem with the cookies cracking, as someone else did, and was trying to figure out the problem. I didn't sift the dry ingredients, but I didn't think that should cause cracking. So, I finally figured out that in my oven, the cookies needed to cook for 7.5 minutes instead of 8. Unfortunately, I did two cookie sheets full before I figured that out. Very good cookies and very easy!"
"3","5","So delicious and much more fund than just p.b. cups on their own. They were popular on my cookie tray. I happened to read the tip to freeze the cups first, so I had my frozen cups ready to go. Thanks!"
"3","5","OMG!!!! What a huge hit, & soooo easy. Excellent recipe Thanks Buchko!"
"3","5","Awesome! Don't change a thing. Make sure your cookies are completely cool before removing from pan or they will crumble."
"3","5","I had to re search for this recipe because it was such a big hit last year. These are quick, easy and delicious."
"3","5","Try Trader Joe's Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups with this recipe. It adds smoothness to the chocolate that Reese's doesn't have. Makes it even more delicious!"
"3","5","These were absolutely great! Can't go wrong with a chocolate peanut butter combination! I used a large muffin tin for these and the normal sized peanut butter cups and it worked well. I just filled the muffin tin cups about halfway and pushed the pushed the peanut butter cups in as soon as they came out of the oven. I would definitely freeze the cups before trying to push them in so they're not so mushy...I forgot this step and was in a hurry, but still turned out great!"
"3","5","My favorite cookie! I always freeze the PB Cups (unwrapped) first and use my medium cookie scoop to form the balls. YUM!"
"3","5","This is a Christmas classic and I always make a double recipe so I can make Peanut Butter Blossoms too. (They are the exact same recipe.)"
"3","5","This recipe is so simple and so good. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. I bought Reese's mini peanut butter cup that are already unwrapped, that I put in the freezer for about 15 minute before placing on the cookie. I used a tablespoon scoop of dough for each ball. Definitely will be making these again. I got exactly 40 cookies."
"3","5","Made these simple cookies for our annual cookie exchange and they went like wildfire. Minimal work for maximum wow reviews!"
"3","1","If you're looking for bland cookies...Go for these. I followed the recipe exactly and the 'dough' was way too wet. I had to add more flour to even form a ball. I tried one after cooking and nothing special about them. Very bland. Getting rid of this recipe!"
"3","5","WOW! These are very yummy!! I followed the recipe, didn't change a thing and they came out great! Thank you, this recipe is a keeper!"
"3","5","Best cookies I've ever made!!! Make sure to not let them cook a second longer than 8 minutes and hide from husband if you want a chance to eat them the next day!!!"
"3","5","Excellent! Definitely chill the peanut butter cups and try rolling the cookies in white sugar before placing in pan."
"3","5","I didnt have any peanut butter cups, so i mixed some chocolate and peanut butter chips together and put a little handful inside instead of the cups! mmm, it was good!"
"3","5","Awesome cookie! I followed the recipe exactly, using the mini muffin pans and the cookies shaped into perfect cups. I followed the tip to freeze the pb cups while the cookies bake and they fit into the cookies well with minimal cracking or melting. These are a great size for parties and look more sturdy to transport than many other cookies. I will definitely be making these again."
"3","5","Great recipe! I made several batches for my husband to take to work last Christmas. The requests are already coming in for this holiday season."
"3","1",".I have been baking these for years and came across this recipe. I thought since this has a 5 star rating they would be awesome. Well I was wrong! The dough is very spongy and dry. I will never use this recipe again. I am sorry I am not being rude just disappointed that I wasted so much product :("
"3","5","Wow, these are so good! Other than using half whole wheat flour, I followed the recipe exactly. I totally missed the fact that you need a mini muffin pan for this recipe. So I just rolled the dough up in balls. I doubled the recipe and got 50 cookies - I had to make them a bit bigger so when I pressed the peanut butter cup in, it didn't stick out. No need for a mini muffin pan if you don't have one."
"3","5","These were a hit at Thanksgiving! Of all the desserts, these cookies were the most popular-every single one was gobbled-up (get it?!). I made them exactly as the recipe instructed, didn't need to change a thing. Even the cooking time was exact. I didn't want the cookie to look like I simply pushed a peanut butter cut in the center, I wanted it to look a bit more polished. Once the cookies came out of the oven, I used a toothpick and swirled it in the chocolate, eliminitating those iconic pointy shapes. Worked like a charm, made a much nicer presentation and gave the impression that I worked alot harder on these cookies than I actually did."
"3","5","Peanut butter perfection! These are delicious and easy to make. The recipe doesn't specify, but I used my handmixer to finish up the dough.  So rich, you won't be able to eat more than 1 or 2! I am taking these to work tomorrow, my coworkers will love me!"
"3","5","My husband said a basket of these and a glass of milk is just this side of heaven.   I did like many of the reviewers suggested and froze the reeses and refrigerated the dough for better scooping. I had no idea how big to make the balls. I used 2 TEASPOONS per ball by just scooping two teaspoonfuls into my hand and rolling them. The recipe yielded 46 cookies. I used paper muffin cup liners and pressed the candies in as soon as they came out of the oven. The papers helped them hold their shape so I could move them over to a flat pan when it was time to do the second batch. (My pan has 24 holes.)  Can't wait to send these to my out of state kids for Christmas!!"
"3","5","Very yummy!! So easy to make. This will be one of my Christmas cookies for sure."
"3","4","I am all about the cookie dough without all extras like the peanut butter cup in the middle or chocolate chips etc. This dough was excellent and just the right amount of sweetness for a cookie. I am rating these a 4 because the sweetness of the peanut butter cup would have been overkill. I think they are perfect without the 'cup' and very peanut buttery! I took them out of the oven and left them on the pan for about 5 minutes before putting them on the rack to finish cooling. I believe this helped them from cracking and breaking."
"3","5","Really good, easy to make. Great cookies to bring to a function etc."
"3","5","These cookies are so stinkin' good, I'm going to need an intervention! I'm not a big peanut butter person nor do I like peanut butter cookies. These, however, have me switching teams. My dough seemed a little dry so I added two more tablespoons of milk-- it was a smart move because the final product was to die for. I brought some into work and, in ten minutes, they were gone. Thankfully, I was smart enough to make a personal stash at home. They are just too good to play generous."
"3","2","Nothing exciting."
"3","5","Amazing! The batter appeared a little thick when I was mixing it, when they ended up perfect. I put the peanut butter cups in the freezer for about 8 minutes (while the cookies were baking) and they inserted into the cookies easily without melting. I wish I would have put them in the refrigerator before unwrapping them though, because some of the chocolate peels off if they are warm. I found that if the batter balls are too big they are harder to remove from the cups (because the batter expands a bit when you put the peanut butter cup in), and there is sparse batter left at the end. I used mini muffin cups and they worked like a charm."
"3","4","I made it the cookie version instead by using Trader Joe's mini peanut butter cups. Great recipe! It was harder to make it all pretty looking as a cookie though."
"3","5","We baked these just last night and they are delicious! Easy enough for my 6 yr old to help. They were great while still warm and they were great this morning cold outta of the fridge!"
"3","5","These were great!"
"3","4","I liked this recipe. Very good the first time I made them. When I made them the second time I used Rollos in place of the peanut butter cups, and they turned out great as well."
"3","4","This is a quick easy recipe, I change the flour to whole wheat, and used chocolate chucks, I pressed a hole with a TSP and put the chocolate chunks in, then topped with a 1/2 tsp of peanut butter, let cool and Kids LOVED them!! I changed the recipe for what I had on hand."
"3","4","made with mini peanut butter cup centers, my husband dubbed them 'Top hat cookies!'"
"3","5","A Great Recipe! I didnt change a thing.:)"
"3","5","If you love chocolate and peanut butter, then these cookies are for you! They are easy to make and delicious! Definately going to make these again!"
"3","5","my sons really liked these cookies! I found this to be a really soft dough even after chilling overnight, next time I will omit the milk.  I used a #60 scoop and got 55 cookies, my bag only had 38 pb cups so I used rolos for the remainder.  I didn't roll in balls just dropped the scoops into the muffin cups, the dough puffs up when baking anyway. I also put them in the freezer for 5 minutes after the cup was placed to harden up, they popped out easily after that. I baked at 350 for 10 minutes."
"3","5","Kids LOVED them!"
"3","5","After tasting this cookie my husband said 'This is the best cookie ever!' A must make for any peanut butter lover. I followed the instructions as directed and they turned out perfect."
"3","5","awsome, melt in your mouth, I could eat the whole batch. First time I made them, they didn't make it till supper"
"3","5","Cookies with my favorite candy?? I'm so upset I left my leftovers 3 hours away! Perfect treat for a weekend sleepover with my daugters friends! They loved them! and so did I!!"
"3","5","Just what i was looking for!"
"3","5","I used the white chocolate cups as well and those were an even bigger hit than chocolate!"
"3","5","Just had to tell you that these cookies were absolutely the cats meow!! Could not keep these around very long. Made them just like the recipe said, and wow. Had to make more because everybody ate them in one day!! Very, very good"
"3","5","These are the best cookies I've made in a long time - thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","I have made these cookies once before and they were fantastic, although this time around i seemed to have misplaced my mini muffin pan. They still turned out the same just a bit under-cooked. I suggest cooking them for a couple minutes longer if you dont have a mini muffin pan. Also my eggs had gone bad 7 days prior to making the cookies and i didnt want to take the risk of getting salmonella so I substituted the eggs for 1 tablespoon more milk. It didnt taste awfull just not as good as the time i made them before. So if you realize you dont have eggs run to the store and by them, you will be a lot happier with the results. :)"
"3","5","These are fabulous. I've mad them a couple of times and the last few times I didn't have peanut butter cups on hand, so I stuck a couple of milk chocolate chips in the middle; they came out even better (in my opinion)."
"3","5","What an amazing recipe! Someone did a favor for me the other day, and I wanted to make cookies as a thank-you. I followed this recipe exactly, and used the tips provided by other reviewers (freeze the Reeses Cups before inserting, refigerate finished cookies for a few minutes to set the cups), and all I can say is this recipe is FAIL PROOF, and resulted in some of the best cookies I've ever made."
"3","5","Made these around chirstmas time, and used some of the advice below. It was an extremly big hit. Everyone wanted to the recipe and have now said I must bring it to ever family gathering.  A wonderful recipe that will for sure be repeated at my house!"
"3","4","Good recipe, I followed another review and made them without the cupcake pan because I couldn't find mine. They did come out cracked on the sides but I didn't mind because I covered them in a very light fluffy icing that went great with them. They also are like mini ice cream sandwiches if you put them in the freezer with the icing on top. YUMM!! Putting the dough and PB cups in the freezer/fridge helped tons with the process!! These are a keeper!"
"3","5","So easy and so good! I made these for a bake sale at work months ago and I still have coworkers raving about how good they are!"
"3","5","I made these and they disappeared. So I made them again and they disappeared again! Apparently, everyone LOVED them!! Thanks for sharing!! This one is PERFECT."
"3","4","Do not stay moist for very long uncovered."
"3","5","My husband's new favorite cookie. And everyone else who had one (or four). I made these exactly as written and thought they turned out great. I don't think I would try freezing the peanut butter cups, I liked how they melted a little and the textures were soft. Definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","I made these just as cookies instead of muffins....i wouldnt make them any other way. There great!"
"3","5","I roll the dough into balls and roll in sugar. The cookies come out of the pan much easier."
"3","5","Fantastic recipe! Best cookies ever."
"3","5","These are SO GOOD. They stay nice and soft/chewy, and don't get crunchy, which is awesome. We made almost 3/4 to maybe 1-inch size balls. And we put the peanut butter cups in the freezer first so they didn't melt too much, but some melting was good =) EXCELLENT recipe, it's been a huge hit."
"3","5","These are great, everyone loved them. They stayed soft for days. Didnt use a muffin tin, just a cookie sheet. They did spread out, but no big deal, still looked good"
"3","5","Fabulous taste - cook time was perfect for a dark non-stick pan, but for my other pan, a lighter color and not non-stick, I would have first sprayed the pan then cooked for 10-11 minutes."
"3","5","Took these cookies to my Mom's Christmas party. I made 40 cookies and they were gone in less than an hour!! Everyone raved about them!! They were the best cookies EVER and very EASY to make :)"
"3","5","These are excellent! I made them for a neighborhood cookie exchange and they were a hit. Even my picky kids loved them. Great recipe - and very easy."
"3","5","DELICIOUS! These are my new faves. The recipe is also on the back of the holiday Reese peanut butter cup package. I made a batch for a potluck and they were gone as soon as I walked in with them! A few helpful hints: it's a must to at least refrigerate the cups prior to inserting them into the center of each cookie, definitely makes it easier. Line your mini-muffin tin with paper cups so you can remove them easily for the next batch, especially since the recipe yields 40 (and you'll probably want to make many more anyways :) Waiting for the middle to the sink-in (a few minutes after removing the cookies from the oven) also helps with no cracking. To cut down slightly on the sweetness, I use all natural peanut butter (be sure to mix thoroughly first) and they turn out to be just right. If I didn't have a big group to share with, my family and I could have eaten the entire batch in one sitting ;) Enjoy!"
"3","5","Fantastic cookies! I made a silly mistake and did not realize that they were supposed to be miniatures so I didn't have as many cookies as I expected. They still tasted great. I will be sure to make more next time though!"
"3","5","Wonderful, turned out perfect. Am making them again to take to Christmas parties!"
"3","5","You can make it easier on yourself by using store- bought peanut butter cookie dough - taste just the same and cuts down the prep time."
"3","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies I've EVER had! I made the recipe exactly as stated and got just shy of 40 cookies. I don't have a mini muffin pan so I just rolled the dough into balls and made a more flat cookie on a regular baking sheet. Thanks to everyone who suggested freezing the pb cups first... I left mine in the freezer for about an hour before baking and they were perfect. Also, make sure, as others have said, that you put the cookies into the fridge to cool to stop the pb cups from melting all the way down. Mine just came out of the oven 10 minutes ago and I've already eaten 3 cookies! So delicious."
"3","5","These are delicious just the way they are - but if you are pressed for time the store-bought sugar cookie dough - in the rolls in the refrigerator section - also works really well. Just make the balls and press into mini muffin tin and continue. Really good!"
"3","5","Easy recipe (which I love!). I wanted to make them for Christmas.....so I sprinkled Christmas colored sprinkles on top also."
"3","5","very taste good - fun to make - would do them again."
"3","5","So easy, so good! Thank you for this wonderful recipe."
"3","5","These were absolutely deliscous! I followed the directions exactly except i froze the peanut butter cups and placed the pan in the refrigerator before i removed the cookies. I will definately be making these for christmas!!"
"3","5","This recipe can be made even easier if you are in a hurry or surprised that you need cookies for an unexpected event (thanks kids)! Using peanut butter cookie dough in the tube, cut into slices then each slice into 4 and place each small slice into a mini muffin pan. Bake at 375 for 8 minutes adding a peanut butter cup when they come out of the oven - foolproof!!"
"3","5","I love these cookies and have been making them for a while. You can shorten the cookie recipe here is mine: 1 c peanut butter 1/2 white sugar and 1 egg. Mix together well, roll into 24 balls (about 1 tsp mixture) and place in mini cupcake pans lined with mini cupcake liners. Bake 15 min @ 325. Do not over bake. As soon as you take them out of the oven push the peanut butter cup in the middle. Let cool. These freeze well."
"3","5","This is nearly identical to a recipe that my mom has used for years and has always been a favorite. Instead of PB cups she's always pressed in a Hersheys kiss and they were called 'Peanut Blossoms.' Either way, they're terrific. Make extra because they go fast."
"3","5","These are the best I make them and my family eats the entire batch before the end of the day!"
"3","5","They were really easy to make. They were also soft and chewy. They were really good."
"3","5","An easier quicker way to do this is get the Pillsbury or BettyCrocker peanut butter cookie mix or refrigerated dough! That is what the original recipe calls for. It's cuts your prep time way down, and the cookies always come out perfect!"
"3","5","WOW! WOW! WOW! These are soooo yummy, its hard to eat just one! Instead of rolling the balls by hand, I used the small Pampered Chef 'baller' and they were the perfect size and also made this a breeze to make."
"3","5","These are delicious! I didnt have a mini muffin pan so used a normal cupcake pan and it turned out great."
"3","5","***EASIER CUSTOM VERSION***: I use the Pillsbury Place & Bake chocolate chip cookies for the 'crust' and then place the peanut butter cup in the centre after baking according to package directions. So much quicker and each cookie is already the perfect size for the mini muffin tin. This is a favourite around the holidays for our family- make lots because they disappear fast !! :)"
"3","5","Family REALLY loved this! Excellent! I made it with all brown sugar, but other than that, exactly to recipe. I bought a big bag of pb cups. According to the pkg, there should've been enough for the 40 cookies for this recipe, but they short-changed me a dozen! So I froze the dough minus the cups. Will try to bake them off later...."
"3","5","To sum these up in one word-amazing!"
"3","5","I can't say enough about how wonderful these little cookies turned out. I followed the advice of others and froze the peanut butter cups first to make them easy to work with. I cooked for exactly 8 minutes and gently pressed the pnut butter cups down in the center of each cookie and then cooled them in the fridge for about 10 minutes. They popped right out of the pan and looked beautiful. So far nothing but rave reviews. I'll def keep this one and make again. They were super easy and so tasty!"
"3","5","These cookies should have a 10 star rating. I'm not sure why a previous reviewer gave them a one-star rating and then said that they disappear immediately...either trying to be cute or doesn't understand the rating system. I didn't have any trouble with them coming out of the muffin tin - I wonder if other reviewers are using a butter spread instead of real butter? I just let them cool before taking them out and they popped right out without a problem. I used a cookie scoop to get uniform size and it made 30 cookies. I ran out of peanut butter cups so substitued some Rollo caramel chocolates and they are yummy too. These cookies will go onto my holiday gift list - so simple, and so delicious. I loved looking at everybody's photos - you all are so creative and adaptive!"
"3","5","One word: Decadent! These are awesome cookies, and I will be making them again. I found that a full tablespoon of dough was the right size for the balls, and I baked the first batch for 10 minutes, and the second batch for 9 minutes; although they turned out great, I can see from my results that 8 minutes would have been just fine. If you like peanut butter cups, you will not be disappointed with this recipe."
"3","5","Sooooo goooood! Thanks for sharing! For some reason, I don't own a mini muffin pan, so I scooped dough out by the Tblsp, rolled into balls, and baked for 9 minutes on a cookie sheet. Pressed frozen pb cups in, and they came out great! Took these to my daughter's Girl Scout meeting and they were a hit! Thanks for a great cookie recipe!"
"3","5","this cookie and simple and soooo easy!! Don't worry about the directions--it is simply fantastic! I make these every year but often I am persuaded by my husband to make these little bites. Putting in the fridge after you put the peanut butter cup in is a fantastic way to easily pop them in one piece. This is one of the best recipes I have EVER used and my house these would rate a 10 on the scale."
"3","5","For the past 25 years, these have been one of my favorite cookies! My mom made them every holiday, and would always decorate the top by sticking a holiday M&M on the peanut butter cup. I'm sure glad to rediscover this classic recipe!"
"3","5","Just FYI these are very caky cookies... they are almost like peanut butter cupcakes with a peanut-butter cup inside them. Either way very good, may try them with a more cookie like cookie to see how they turn out."
"3","5","soooo good+fun to make! this recipe is easy to follow and makes amazzzzing results :) one of my friends ate 5+ of these in under a minute, and all of them were gone by the end of the night xD tips: freeze the cups, just as everyone below has said. right after you push the PB cups in, take the cookies out of the pan, and put em in the fridge before the chocolate can melt"
"3","5","adorable and the perfect size for a pb and chocolate treat. I made these for my boyfriends hockey team and they went in record speed. I've gotten tons of requests for them! great job - all of the previous reviews were super helpful too! thanks everyone"
"3","5","I made these for Valentine's day for my boyfriend [as well as the Sweetheart Cupcakes with Buttercream frosting (see my recipe box)] and as someone who can't resist Reese's peanut butter cups, I knew he'd go crazy for these. I froze the peanut butter cups, unwrapped, in a tupperware container as I also preheated the oven. I ended up making 48 cookies (vs. 50) because there was 48 cups in my Reese's miniature peanut butter cup package. I also pushed them into the center of each cookie about a minute after I took them out of the oven, in which the chocolate did melt a tiny bit (it didn't bother me though). The only 2 changes I made was baking the balls in mini muffin baking cups (easier clean-up and it makes for a nice presentation. Michaels sells 100 miniature muffin cups for $1.99.) and the other was to let them bake for 9 minutes (instead of 8 minutes). The only worry I had was that the dough didn't cook through all the way. I noticed in photos posted that some people had the same result as me. I didn't find it to have a bad flavor or anything but that was the one thing that irked me. Maybe cooking it for longer at a lower temperature would've helped this. Either way, my boyfriend, my 2 roommates, my boss and myself included, found these to be delicious! This is for any peanut butter lover. Easy to make as well."
"3","5","The only tiny thing I did differently, was roll the ball in white sugar before putting in the mini muffin pan. I thought this recipe would be too sweet with the peanut butter cup in it instead of a kiss. But everyone loved them! They preferred them over the ones with kisses."
"3","5","I made these for New Year's and they were so easy and perfect. After reading the reviews, I took people's suggestions to freeze the reese peanut butter cups before and after unwrapping them. I rounded the dough into 2 tsp balls. I also didn't bake them past 8 minutes even though they didn't look done. I used a mini muffin pan, but I only have one pan, so I might try using a cookie sheet anyway. I put the reese cups in right away and then put the batch in the refrigerator. We had to take them somewhere so they had to be cooled, but they are amazing when they are still hot."
"3","5","Delicious and easy! I made them exactly as the recipe indicated. They were a big hit!"
"3","5","These cookies are AMAZING!!! just be careful not to touch them once you stick in the cups. They melt in the warm cookie, then firm back up."
"3","5","an all time family favorite!!!"
"3","4","These are pretty good, but then any cookie that features a Reese's PB cup as the star is going to be pretty good! The cookie part tasted a little bit 'doughy' to me although it was cooked entirely, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. They are very cute cookies."
"3","5","This was a huge hit! I had friends offer to pay me to make them a batch. I froze the unwrapped cups before pressing into cookie and followed the recipe. Perfect everytime!"
"3","5","Amazing! I made as directed and they turned out perfect! I plan on making them for my annual Christmas cookie exchange this year!"
"3","5","These turned out great. Big hit with the kids and a keeper for sure."
"3","5","These are excellent! So easy to make and they look so nice when they are done. Perfect for all of the cookie parties at this time of year!"
"3","5","These are very good. The kids love them. Be careful not to use the natural peanut butter. It makes the dough to oily."
"3","5","Several other reviewers have said this, but: You MUST put the peanut butter cups in the fridge or freezer so they are cold before pressing them into the warm cookies."
"3","5","Simple and amazing."
"3","5","Just superb! I have made a similar recipe in the past that always seemed to turn out a little too hard/crunchy. These were very soft when I followed the instructions by many here to bake for only 8 minutes. A tip for bakers who have lots of tools around: use a #70 disher (scooper) and just plop the half-spheres in each cavity of the tin. You will get about 44 cookies that cook uniformly and look great. I ran out of PB cups and stuck Hershey Kisses in a few of them and they were very good too! Make certain you have refrigerated or frozen the candy first, or it will be messy and a little sloppy when you insert them into the hot cookies. It is true that when you remove these from the oven they look underbaked, but fear not! Delicious."
"3","5","Very tasty! Best if chilled right after placing the peanut butter cup."
"3","5","I made these today for my husband to bring to work and my kids and I taste tested them...OMG, they are so good. They might not last until tomorrow. Super easy to make and super YUMMY!!!!"
"3","5","I doubled the recipe, used 1 T. of dough per cookies, baked 7 min, and this yielded 48 cookies for me. The tips to freeze the cups first, and let the cookies cool before trying to remove were very helpful."
"3","5","These are like little peanut butter bombs! Great for peanut butter lovers, like me. I also froze the peanut butter cups. They melt a minute or two after you push them into the hot cookie. In order to get 40 equal-sized cookies, after mixing the dough I flattened it into a rectangle (about 8x10'), wrapped the dough in plastic wrap to chill for an hour or so, then used a knife to divide into 40 squares, and rolled each square between my palms to make balls."
"3","5","I totally cheated and used packaged pb cookie mix and they were great!"
"3","5","Best cookies ever! I froze the peanut butter cups and popped the end product in the fridge for 5 minutes before putting on the cooling rack and they turned out perfect. If I could only live on one treat the rest of my life, this would be it!"
"3","4","These were very easy to make and taste great! I did use mini muffin pans and froze the pb cups as well. the only problem i had was getting them out of the pan to put on the cooling rack without smearing chocolate everywhere. A great recipe!"
"3","5","everyone ate them, and fast!"
"3","5","I love these cookies and they are soooooo good and easy!! They turned out GREAT!!"
"3","1","I followed the recipe exactly as its posted. They came out undercooked! I tried baking them longer and while they got 'better' it was almost impossible to eat. They were so mushy/chewy you had to have a drink of water just to swallow them. I will never make this again."
"3","5","I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did freeze my peanut butter cups as suggested by other reviewers. Absoulutely the best cookies EVER!! I will be adding these to my Christmas candy and cookie baking list. Thank You so much BUCHKO!!!"
"3","5","I made these for my boyfriend last night, I am not much of a fan of peanut butter but they still tasted great. ADVICE- put them in the fridge for a few minutes after the pan cools down, if you try to take them out too early the top ring will fall out. Also freeze the Reeses it makes it easier to push them in."
"3","5","Definitely 5 stars!! My bf had been bugging me to make peanut butter cookies and knowing that he LOVES peanut butter cups, I thought these would be perfect for him. I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed. Very easy to make and the cookies are delicious both fresh out of the oven & the next day. NOTE: I didn't use the mini muffin pan, just a regular cookie sheet and had no problems."
"3","5","These are to die for! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I highly recommend trying these if you are a peanut butter and chocolate lover!"
"3","5","This is an excellent recipe! I followed it exactly and they were delicious. I would also suggest freezing the peanut butter cups."
"3","5","This recipe makes an awesome cookie! I didnt have the mini muffin pans so cooked them in a regular pan (bigger balls of dough) and they were great. Made about 28 cookies instead of 40."
"3","5","What could be better than a peanut butter cup wrap in more peanut butter."
"3","5","Moist and decadent! I used a medium sized scooper to portion the cookies. They came out perfectly, even in a full-sized silicone muffin pan. Like other reviews mention... freeze the peanut butter cups beforehand, bake the cookies no more than 8 minutes, press candies into the cookies immediately after pulling them from the oven, and refridgerate ASAP to prevent melting. It's almost impossible to mess up this recipe."
"3","4","I used Hershey's kisses instead of Reese's for simpler taste. I made them for a friend, and she loved them! Then my bro-in-law ate the rest and begged for me. Very straightforward, simple recipe. Make sure you make the balls big enough so that they don't crack when you put the candy in them. Didn't make as many, but they didn't fall apart, either..."
"3","5","These are fantastic cookies! I had read thru the comments people left and their tips definitely helped. I didn't have a cookie scoop so I used two teaspoons of dough rolled into a ball to make each cookie. Baked for 8 minutes, pressed a frozen peanut butter cup into each cookie then put the pan in the fridge for about 15 minutes to set. Delicious!"
"3","5","This is my most requested cookie. Everyone remembers how soft and delicious they are and always ask for more! I do freeze the cups before I start baking so they get less melty when put in the cookie. I immediately put the hot cookie sheets into the freezer to help keep the chocolate in the right shape."
"3","5","I followed the recipe EXACTLY and these were awesome!!!! I made 2 batches and could probably eat all of them!! but i wont:)"
"3","5","Amazing taste and texture but they are a pain to make."
"3","5","Oh my goodness these cookies are so good and incredibly addicting!! Follow these three steps and they will be amazing...(1) Unwrap and freeze the Reese cups before you bake the cookies (2) Bake the cookies in a mini muffin pan for exactly 8 mins and then take them out of the oven (3) Immediately push the Reese cups into the center of the cookie and then put the entire mini muffin pan (which will still be hot) into the fridge for 15 -20 mins. Wait for cookies to cool and/or then next day...soooo good!"
"3","5","Worked as advertised!! Husband LOVES them and he doesn't eat sweets a lot! I also used a flat pan. First i removed the cookies and then added the cups..then i did another batch..added the cups while the cookies were still on the pan...works much better!! great recipe!!"
"3","5","Loved every bite of them to the end."
"3","4","very good and easy to make. Make sure you unwrap the PB cups while the cookies are in the oven or your cookies will cool and start to brake when you press in the PB cup. Also, make them between 3/4-1 inch to keep small enough for the peanut butter goodness. I baked mine on a cookie sheet."
"3","2","I made NO changes to the listed recipe so I feel like my rating is true to how my cookies turned out. These were NOT GOOD at all! I am always looking for a peanut butter cookies recipe. This is definately not it for me. The cookies had no flavor. If I had not made them, I wouldn't have known what they were. I wish I hadn't wasted my peanut butter cups!"
"3","5","I want to marry these cookies.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I don't have mini muffin tins. I just rolled the cookies in a ball. I only got 35 cookies, using a measuring tablespoon to keep them uniform.  I see these going VERY fast at work tomorrow. If I go to bed right NOW...they may even make it to work. Did follow the suggestion of freezing the cups."
"3","5","These are quick, easy, and delicious. I use a Hershey's Kiss instead of the peanut butter cup in each cookie."
"3","5","Excellent! Crunchy cookie, gooey center - too good! I did not have enough mini-muffin pans for the job (I doubled the mixture), so I rolled the balls out and placed them on cookie sheets. The recipe turned out roughly the same, although the balls were not of uniform size. Also, it helps to freeze the peanut butter cups before shelling them. Little ones with clean hands are a great help with this part of the recipe."
"3","4","Yummy, but rich."
"3","5","yum!yum!"
"3","3","I have given this only three stars because I think they are too sweet. The taste of the candy overpowers the cookie. I do not think I will make them again. Nothing special."
"3","5","Yummy and easy to make - what more can you ask for?! I followed the recipe exactly. I took previous suggestions and froze the peanut butter cups. I measured 1 tablespoon dough for each cookie (I got 44 total) and baked them for about 8 minutes. After pushing the pb cany into the baked cookie I put them out on the deck to cool 5-10 minutes(it's winter and cold here now). I used a small knife to pry just a little down the side and they popped right out of the teflon coated mini muffin pan without any trouble. I will be making these again for sure!"
"3","5","Mmmm good. Melt in your mouth. I only baked for 7 minutes. 8 minutes seemed to be a bit too long, but my oven tends to be a little hot. Easily got 48 cookies (two mini muffin pans) out of one batch. I used the small pampered chef cookie scoop."
"3","5","Very good cookie! I made these last night, I used a cookie sheet instead of a mini muffin pan and they still came out great."
"3","4","I thought they were good but just a little dry. Might use another peanut butter cookie recipe next time. But I do like the concept."
"3","4","Very cute cookies! I baked them in my mini muffin pan with liners as I did not want to risk them sticking. Immediately after taking the pan out at 8 minutes, I inserted frozen peanut butter cups and put the tray into the freezer for about 8 more minutes. This prevented the pb cup from melting and made for a pretty cookie. I've frozen the rest of the batter and will be baking the rest in December!"
"3","5","Kids love these"
"3","5","Excellent cookies! One of my husband's favorites. I think the peanut butter cup on top is good, but I like a Hershey's Kiss a little better."
"3","5","This is an awesome recipe! They turned out great and they are easy to make."
"3","5","I made these for my husbands coworker for helping us move some furniture. He loved them!! We kept a few for us and that is all i ate the next morning for breakfast....yummy!"
"3","5","These always come out perfectly, and they work out okay without a muffin tin. The dough even tastes yummy without a peanut butter cup in it."
"3","5","These were AWESOME! I made them for my husband & he couldn't stop eating them! Definitely a hit here although I didn't have pb cups so instead I added those semi-sweet chocolate chunks (instead of choc. chips) Refrigerated the dough for about 2 hours, rolled into balls on a baking stone & they not only tasted amazing but were beautiful as well! Not flat like so many other cookies. Slightly underbake them & they stay chewy too! Definitely recommended!"
"3","4","I put reese's cups in the middle AND hershey's kisses and both are really cute and very tasty!"
"3","5","YUM!! These are SO good! Everyone always asks how I get the cookie around the peanut butter cup:) I took these for the youth group at my church about a month ago and I still hear people talking about them!! I have made these quite a few times and I will continue to make them."
"3","5","Perfect, these turned out absolutely perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and I put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while I was making the cookies. I also put the dough in the fridge while the oven was preheating and I rolled the balls in white sugar before I dropped them in the mini muffin pans and I cooked them for 9 minutes. It made 36 of them and they all turned out perfect. This will definitely be a keeper (and made often) at our house."
"3","2","came out of the oven way too undercooked. the bottom was like chewy batter. the taste was there, though a little too sweet for me."
"3","5","Unbelievably good. These are the cookies all other cookies should be jealous of. I also took a tip from others and smooshed the pb cup into the center of a cookie ball-no mini muffin tin requires creativity. They are truly fantastic."
"3","5","Terrific cookie! I thought the recipe was easy and they came out great. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so just used the mini muffin liners on a regular cookie sheet and that worked fine. I liked the added touch of the sprinkles."
"3","4","Best Peanut Butter cup Cookie recipe ever, except 1/2 teaspoon salt made mine too salty. 1/4 teaspoon tasted much better. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes which was perfect. I made a bunch of these and froze them to keep them fresh. And actually, I like them best right out of the frezzer."
"3","5","Awesome cookies! Everyone raves about these at parties!"
"3","3","These are cute cookies, but weren't the hit I was hoping they'd be. I might make again for maybe a classroom function, but not for a Christmas cookie. It didn't hold it's weight against the other cookies I make. Also, I had to bake much longer than what the recipe called for. I'm new to a high elevation home, so maybe that's the reason. I had to cook my cookies almost twice as long, and even then they were slightly undercooked."
"3","3","I had a bit of trouble with these. My first batch didn't turn out and I had to throw them away. I upped the bake time after that and they came out okay although a tad bit dry. They had a good taste so I will try them again. Next time I plan on rolling the balls in sugar before baking them."
"3","5","Every time I make these cookies, people just rave about them! You can make them ahead and freeze them, then take them out when you need them."
"3","5","These are terrific! I followed previous tips and used a mini muffin tin to bake the cookies in, and froze the peanut butter cups. Both worked great."
"3","5","These seem to be the new family favorite. I made them for Christmas, they were gone in a flash, everyone loved them. I will definatley be baking these again and again."
"3","3","Good taste but mine stuck to the pan and fell apart when I tried to take them out. My pan was nonstick?? I'd use some Pam next time."
"3","5","So easy, soooooooooo yummy! My husband fell in love with this cookie and couldn't keep his hands off of them! His buddies at work approved also :-) This will certainly be made again & again in my household."
"3","5","This recipe was awesome. It was easy to do, and the kids LOVED it (that also includes the hubby) I added some sugar sprinkles for holiday flare."
"3","5","If you love Reese's Peanut Butter Cups then this is an awesome recipe!  We used a regular sized cupcake pan and made balls a little smaller than golf-sized (roughly the size of two peanut butter cups put together). We also used shortening to cover the baking pan so it was easy to remove. After they were cooked we put the pan in the freezer for a few minutes. We then used a knife to loosen the edges and popped out the cookies! Yummy!  Hint: Don't push the peanut butter cups to far down into the cookie or else the center will be a soft spot and the cookie may fall through or not come out easily. :-)  GREAT RECIPE, SUBMITTER!"
"3","5","What can I say but yum? If you love peanut butter and chocolate, you'll love these cookies! I used red and green sprinkles on top for Christmas. This recipe is a keeper!"
"3","5","These turned out really well. They take awhile to make because you have to wait for them to set up before you can get them out and start another round in the same pan. Everyone loved them though!"
"3","4","Easy and delicious - tried the chocolate version (per someone else's recommendation - substitute 1/2 cup melted chocolate and 2 TB cocoa powder for peanut butter) and that was great too. Doubled and froze easily."
"3","5","These turned out perfect. They are really great. A cross between a cookie and a decadent piece of candy. The only thing I did differently, based on other posts, was spray the muffin tins with non-stick spray. I don't know how they would turn out if you don't. I didn't want to risk them sticking. Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","So much fun, and very decadent at the same time! You can easily dress these up for Christmas. My son's Kindergarten class loved them!"
"3","5","i had a baking party with some of my friends and we made these. THEY WERE THE HIT OF THE NIGHT! next day still soft and just as wonderful. 5 stars!"
"3","5","Followed the directions and the cookies came out perfectly! I followed another reviewers advice to freeze the peanut butter cups so they come out of the wrappers easier. The cookies were absolutely delicious and were a big hit! I will definitely make these again!"
"3","5","my mother and I have been looking for a GOOD peanut butter cup cookie receipe and this is the ONE just the right amount of flavor it is fantastic !!!!!"
"3","4","My husband and I wanted to are big cookie eaters, and wanted to cobble this up within a day, but we were good and finished them in 3 days. I will definitely be making this again! I used a mixture candy bag of rolo's and kisses, along with the pb cups. Awesome!"
"3","5","WOW!!! These are sooo yummy! My 5 and 3 year old had so much fun unwrapping the reeses cups, pushing them into the cookies, and putting the sprinkles on! These are fun, easy, and delicious. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! Thanks!"
"3","5","These cookies were fabulous! Not only are they easy but they come out looking perfectly pretty! I took them to my Daughter's preschool class and all the children gave these cookies an 'A+'!"
"3","5","THESE WERE SO TASTY!! i made them using the milk chocolate p.b.cups AND i used the white ch. p.b.cups!! then i sprinkled red and green christmas tree sprinkles on top and they turned out ADORABLE!! if you do it while they are still warm the sprinkles melt right in with the chocolate and it looks really neat."
"3","5","Good cookie, just wish the peanut butter cup would melt more to blend with cookie."
"3","5","YUM! I made these today for a children's cookie exchange tomorrow and I know these will be a big hit. I added some Christmas sprinkles on top to give them a more festive look but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My daughter LOVES them and I like that they look like they are much more difficult to make than they are. I didn't have any problem getting them out of the pan. Maybe because my mini muffin pan is a brand new non-stick one. I told a friend about them tonight and she has a friend who makes a variation of this cookie using chocolate chip dough instead of peanut butter. Something to try next time!"
"3","5","I made these last night... brought a few dozen to work today, and they're almost gone! The dough is wonderful- moist & flavorfu. However, not too easy to remove from pan without damaging cookie... next time I will spritz pan with Pam with Flour spray before inserting dough balls.   I also topped the Reese's Cups with sprinkles while they were still warm... what a nice touch. They melted in a bit and made the whole look of the cookie.   I would also recommend making the balls a little on the larger side; my smaller ones were too little for the Reese's Cups and rejected them a bit.  I might add chopped Reese's Peices to the dough next time and make a chocolate drizzle... ENJOY!!"
"3","5","These were great! They look like mini tarts...made me look like I was a professional baker. I made them for Christmas and sprinkled with candied holly and berries. They look great and were easy. A little time consuming, but if you have a couple of mini cupcake pans it will go much faster. Definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","I have been making these for years. They are wonderful. My family would disown me if I did not make these for Christmas every year."
"3","5","If you like reeses and peanut butter, you'll love these cookies. Definitely don't go over the 8 minute cooking time and be sure to have your reeses ready to go immediately when they get out of the oven!"
"3","5","My son's favorite, he asks for them on every special occasion. Great for giving in a fancy box or tin. I made them on a cookie sheet before I found a mini muffin pan. It worked fine, but the muffin pan is best."
"3","5","I followed this recipe exactly with regards to the ingredients. However, after placing the dough balls into a nonstick mini muffin pan, I then pressed a peanut butter cup into the center of each PRIOR TO BAKING. I baked the cookies for the prescribed time. The cookies baked up perfectly and were easy to remove from the pan once cooled. Thanks for a tasty and fun recipe!"
"3","5","Because I was pressed for time, I used this recipe idea with Pillsbury peanut butter cookie dough. I pressed the dough into mini muffin pans, baked, and pressed the mini-cup in the center of the cookie. Delicious and addicting!"
"3","5","OH MY GOD!!! Soooo good, just enough peanut butter cookie and just enough peanut butter cup, and SO EASY!!! you have to try"
"3","5","I LOVE THIS RECIPE ~ by far the best cookie I have had in a long time. My family (and neighbors) and them gone in no time. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!"
"3","5","Warning! Do not make these for your kids if you are on a diet! I could not stop eating them. I have made these in the past with store bought sugar cookie dough, but I like it much better with the peanut butter cookie dough. Fabulous recipe!"
"3","5","These are AWESOME! I made some on a cookie sheet instead of putting in mini muffin pan, and they turned out good, just more like a round cookie. My sister liked them better this way! A great Christmas present!"
"3","5","Yummy!! I also put the cookies directly in the fridge to cool. The peanut butter cup wasn't as messy. These were a big hit at a Christmas cookie exchange."
"3","5","These cookies were enjoyed by all. They kept well in the cookie jar, too, that is if they made it there."
"2","5","Easy recipe! It turns out exactly as stated, which is really nice. The only thing I'd note is the cookies need to have a cooling time of at least 20 (but probably 30) minutes in the pan before removing. I didn't freeze the PB cups and didn't have a problem. I'll definitely be making these again!"
"2","5","Wow! Never have I baked a treat that everyone begged me for the recipe. I made a few batches for Christmas to put in tins as presents and it was such a hit, that it's expected of me to make these for every family function!  I followed the recipe exactly and froze the mini peanut butter cup like mentioned here in the comments and they turned out perfect."
"2","5","The only adjustment I made to this recipe was I added a few peanut butter chips. My batch yielded exactly 40 cookies as the recipe states. The instructions were easy to follow and the result is delicious and addicting cookies."
"2","5","Yes! These are easy to make and just like the PB kiss cookies. Definitely making again! Followed directions exactly and put my Reece's in the freezer so they wouldn't melt."
"2","5","Easy, fun to make, and yummy! One of my holiday cookie staples."
"2","5","I ran out of Mini Peanut Butter Cups so I used Mini Rolos. Excellent!!"
"2","5","Me as a beginner in cooking this is great to learn about measurements and I love cookies and peanut butter"
"2","4","I loved them perfect amount of sweetness"
"2","3","I liked these and even though my dough was very moist, I felt like the cookies were too dry after baking. Perhaps I did something wrong, but was expecting a happy moist cookie..."
"2","5","Me and my darling 9 year old daughter just made these she loves to be able to help bake now, she said these are awesome! :)"
"2","3","Ok so I made these.twice. first time I folowed recipe exactly baked only for 8 minutes put chocolate in center cookies didnt crack but when they were cooled and I started popping them out, they all flattened because they were not cooked. Took the second time of me baking the batch for 15 minutes! Yes 15 minutes before the cookies were cooked enough to remove from oven and place chocolates inside.  Even with freezing the chocolates the cookie edges still cracked. But i'd rather have cracked edges then raw cookie dough.  Would make them again but make sure they are cooked before removing from oven. And yes I did refridgerate the cookie dough prior to making into balls.as it was easier to use my cookie scoop."
"2","5","I have to follow instructions to the letter, I am not creative at all when it comes to cooking. These are the BOMB!!!!!"
"2","5","5 Stars for this recipe, they were"
"2","5","I made these out of boredom, and they were delicious! (I always bake out of boredom- or when I'm down in the dumps, and all the time other than that.) ;-) I love the gooey center in the metal- it's like the cookie is melting in your mouth! Definitely try out this recipe! I freezed the peanut butter cups while I made the batter and baked them in the oven. It makes it a lot easier to press into the cookies when they're finished!"
"2","5","Mmmmmmmm turned out soooo good..... We will do it again!!!"
"2","5","Soooooo bomb."
"2","4","I love this recipe!"
"2","5","These were sooo good! Only issue I came across is my reese's melted so fast. I read someone said put the reese's in the freezer before. I will try that next time!"
"2","1","The cookie dough itself was very bland; you can barely taste the peanut butter at all. It was very soft, which I like. But I will not make these again."
"2","5","Best Peanut butte cookies that I have ever made my whole family loved them. I used as bigger pan than a mini muffin pan and it worked really well this get 5 out of 5 stars."
"2","5","So good. Followed directions to a T...except I had no reeses cups on hand but thank goodness I had the peanut butter eggs they do this time of the year. Cut them in fours and it worked out well. Happy baking"
"2","4","I used the recipe and made cookies and not cups AND no candies in it. Next time I'll add more peanut butter and less sugar.  I also substituted oats and chia for the 3/4 cup of flour.   Obviously, the recipe is very forgiving. I liked it a lot."
"2","5","Taste delicious!!! Instead of just using all Reese Peanut Cups , I also did half Hersey kisses to. I will be using this recipe again soon."
"2","5","This was SO easy, and SO delicious! I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I rolled the dough around the peanut butter cups, and baked them in balls. They turned out GREAT! I followed the recipe, and only baked them for 8 minutes. They don't look done when you take them out, but they are baked perfectly, so take them out anyway! I put some paper towels on my cooling racks so they wouldn't fall through, and they turned out so good. I also followed some previous reviewer's advice, and froze the peanut butter cups. And I used two cookie sheets, and put the unused one in the fridge in between batches, so it would cool off, and not melt the pb cups right away. All in all this was a fantastic recipe, and if I ever get a mini muffin pan, I'll try them that way, too!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious and super easy! 40 cookies sounds like a lot, but if you are making them for a gathering or if you are making treats for someone's birthday, I would say double the recipe. These are small, and delicious, and go quick quick quick!"
"2","5","it was delicious!!! I didn't use any measuring tools for the wet ingredients and it turned out fine! fail-proof! haha! will be making these again!"
"2","5","Delicious!"
"2","5","I maid this as valentines day thing using hearshy kisses it turned out great but I recommend freezing the ones that have the cherry in it"
"2","5","Never a disappointment when I make it for a event."
"2","5","easy and yummy!"
"2","5","Believe the hype. I sometimes pass over recipes that are this popular because I think they can't be that special. These are worth the praise. The tips are right. Freeze your PB cups, take the cookies out of the oven at exactly eight minutes, and put the muffin tin in the fridge to cool the cookies so the PB cups don't melt beyond recognition. This recipe has moved right up to the top of my list!"
"2","3","I think this is a very good recipe"
"2","5","I had these at a Christmas party and couldnt wait to make them myself! They looked very easy to make! This was a great and easy recipe to follow. The only part that made it harder than it looked was getting it out of the muffin tin. No matter how much I oiled the tin, they would fall apart when taking them out. The best way was to let them cool for about 10 minutes and then take them out gently with a knife. My first batch was a little messy to say the least, but once I got the taking out part down they were perfection! These are addictive!!"
"2","5","I make these a lot for our daughters 4th grade class and the kids are always begging me to bring them in every day!! They never last long in our house also, they are the best cookies I have made so far!!"
"2","5","made it exactly per recipe. used mini muffin cups to line the pan so they were easy to pop out. used xmas sprinkles on top of the reeses cup when it had melted some after being placed in the cookie dough and refrigerated to get everything to set. baking for 8 minutes was perfect at 375. took them to a cookie exchange and everyone loved them. easy and delicious."
"2","5","Outstanding. So nice to have a peanut butter cookies similar to the peanut blossoms, but something a little different. So easy to make and very delicious."
"2","4","I'm allergic to nuts so i have to rely on others for feedback. These were 'good but I have made better things' so I'm only giving these 4 stars. I followed other reviewers suggestions: 1. put the chocolate in the fridge once unwrapped. This definitely made it easier. 2. put the whole tray in the fridge once I inserted the chocolates. I was going to ignore this step until I saw the chocolate melting away inside. 3. A few people suggested waiting a few minutes for the cookies to 'drop' in the centre before putting in the PB cups to avoid cracking. I didn't have a problem with this (they already seemed 'dropped' when I took them out of the oven)& inserted them all right away - no cracking! 4. Filled each cup with 2 tsp dough."
"2","5","These cookies VANISHED after I made them. They freeze well (if you can get them in there before they are gone)! Make these!!"
"2","1","Wasn't very good"
"2","5","This is an excellent recipe! Absolutely delicious cookies. Everyone with a sweet tooth will love them!"
"2","5","I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I had to use the normal size. The cookies were easy to make and are delicious, but many fell apart after cooling. Also, putting the candies in immediately when they were out of the oven caused the candies to melt. I don't know if I had used a mini pan if the candies would not have melted."
"2","5","I used almond butter instead of peanut butter and had white chocolate peanut butter cups! I also put my peanut butter cups in the freezer for a few minutes before cookies were done! Best cookies I've ever made!!!"
"2","4","Loved it can also work with regular cupcake pans :)"
"2","5","Great recipe..We liked it;-)"
"2","5","Love it. Easy to make, fast and they go just as fast. Great combo."
"2","5","loved this recipe ! I didnt change anything in mine it took 10min to cook . everyone loved them they are really heavy and sweet cookies but amazing. only tip don't make them too big, but you could even make theese as mini cupcakes with chocolate frosting !"
"2","5","Wow! Addictive little things. These are always on my list for holiday baking. Like other reviewers suggest, I put the unwrapped pb cups in the freezer for 30 minutes or so. Fantastic! Thanks Buchko"
"2","5","Super easy to make and so good they never last more than a day in my house"
"2","4","The cookies were good but just a tad bit dry. I am not sure if it was because I made a smaller quantity (20)."
"2","5","This is amazing. I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but this is different, and awesome."
"2","5","These were very good!!! They are easy to make and the recipe makes so many. I did not make any changes to the recipe and it turned out perfect. These are best right out of the oven. I took them out of the muffin tin while they were still hot (with the peanut butter cup in, of course) and cooled them on a rack, which worked fine."
"2","5","Great recipe!! I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out as previous experience with other highly rated recipes have turned out meh. But this recipe was the exception. I followed the advice of others - I froze the peanut butter cups and refrigerated the cookie dough. I should say that I'm an avid and experienced baker married to a man with a sweet tooth who eagerly appreciates my baking. But when he tried these cookies, he immediately dropped to his knees and slapped the floor (repeatedly) ... a reaction I've never gotten. Thanks for the terrific recipe and the great reviewer suggestions. This one's going into heavy rotation!"
"2","5","hey, nursethoms, make sure that you sift the flour salt and baking soda! Otherwise you will have put in to much of all 3 of these ingredients which would prevent the dough from spreading. Good luck!"
"2","4","A little time consuming, but well worth it."
"2","5","these were delish and perfect"
"2","5","VERY good! I made some early for a St. Pat's party. I will freeze and serve later as the reviews say they last well. Tips to definitely follow: 1) I had to refrigerate the dough briefly so it could set before I could roll them in balls. The dough was too sticky at first, but once refrigerated, it was fine. 2)Yes, freeze your mini pb cups first, and make sure thay are unwrapped and ready to go when the cookies come out of the oven - you should press them in immediately after baking, then immediately place them in the fridge while still in tins so chocolate doesn't melt too much. Then take them out of fridge after about 10 mins and let them cool at room temp. for another 10 mins or so - I didn't have them cool completely yet you could do that. In order to get them out of tins, I took a knife a carefully went around edge of cookies and then they came out easily. I took them out one at a time, by hand, since they did kind of want to stay in there. I did spray the tins with cooking spray first but since I rolled them in green sugar I think that kept them wanting to stick in the tins a bit. I also made some with no sugar on the outside and I removed them the same way as the green ones. They all came out without any problems. The reason I did not cool completely and let them fall out of the tins is because I tried it with the first batch and they were a little stuck & I wanted them to look perfect since they are for a party."
"2","5","Great cookies! When it says to use a mini muffin pan...LISTEN. Oy vey."
"2","5","These turned out perfect! I used whole wheat flour and Hershey Kisses. I also rolled the raw dough balls in sugar before baking to give them a little sparkle and extra crunch. Bake time was spot on! Thank you."
"2","4","Make sure you freeze the Reese's PB cups before hand, makes it much easier."
"2","5","greatest all time cookies i've ever made!"
"2","5","Made these for a cookie exchange and got rave reviews! They are delicious! I unwrapped the mini reese's and froze them, as other reviewers suggested and it worked perfectly! Husband has asked that I not make more, for fear that he will eat them all!!!"
"2","5","Made these just like the recipe says. They turned out awesome! A big hit in our house! Another batch has already been requested."
"2","5","We LOVED these. They are simply delectable! A couple tips - Freeze the mini peanut butter cups before using them so they don't fall apart. Also, let these cool long enough before taking them out of the pan. If you're in a hurry, put them in the garage or freezer to cool faster."
"2","5","My family and co-workers look forward to these cookies every year! They are so simple to make, fun with kids and taste great too!"
"2","5","My hubby and I LOVED these peanut butter cookies :) SO delicious. I was really surprised by how easy they were and the results I got. Awesome recipe :) (Be sure to but the peanut butter cups in the freezer)"
"2","5","Loved these- so, so, SO delicious!!! Unwrapped the pb cups and stuck them in the freezer for an hour beforehand- makes the whole process easier."
"2","5","The kids went crazy with this one! Make sure that you do not over bake these cookies and definitely use a mini muffin pan otherwise it changes the moist chewy goodness in the center of the cookie!"
"2","5","Yummmm!!! My students loved it and it was way easy to make!"
"2","5","Excellent! Followed recipe exactly, but I did take others advice & I froze the pb cups a few mins before pushing them into the cookie & I also after they were done to prevent melting. I took some to work & everyone really liked these. Thanks!!!"
"2","5","These were so easy to make, and they came out great! Everyone loved them!"
"2","5","Love these cookies. I also make them with chocolate chip cookie dough"
"2","5","Perfect, didn't need to make any adjustments."
"2","5","These are sooo easy to make...and tasty too! Loved that you didn't have to form into a cup first...did have problems getting the chocolate to set up because weather was warm & humid, but put in freezer for a bit & they were fine...wedding fare and very popular!"
"2","5","Never fail. Amazing."
"2","5","These were delicious and a huge hit!"
"2","4","I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. These cookies were fun and easy to make. However, I thought the peanut butter cookie was lacking flavor. The candy kind of made up for the lack of flavor, but I feel that there are better peanut butter cookie recipes that would work better with the candy."
"2","4","good snacks/desserts. the only thing i disliked was the dough of the cookie. still great for guests. thats just me. :)!"
"2","5","I make these often and they're a huge hit every time - people freak out over the peanut butter cup in the middle. Super easy too!"
"2","5","Super good. A tad dry though."
"2","5","I made these and they were delicious!! If you love peanut butter then these are for you!! Kids love to help make them and of course eat them too!! Don't pass this recipe up (especially if you have children!)"
"2","5","Awesome"
"2","5","Soooooo delicious!"
"2","5","I love these peanut butter cups! Great for party's."
"2","5","Great recipe! thanks!"
"2","5","These are great everytime and everone loves them especially my BF. I do use the new unwrapped Reese's cups and put one or two in each cookie."
"2","5","Easy & Quick Recipe!!! Very Good"
"2","4","Nice recipe. My grandson, 6, helped and it was fun We made them for a cookie baking contest at church. Have to let you know if I won."
"2","5","The family loved these! We tried them with Rolos candy as well but liked the peanut butter the best."
"2","5","Great cookies!My family went crazy over them!Great snack and recipe"
"2","5","Made these many times now....always a huge hit! They don't last long!!"
"2","5","I made these the other day, and they are perfect! It was only frustrating having just one mini muffin pan. My boyfriend loves them, and actually prefers them refrigerated."
"2","5","These were amazing! I didn't know what to expect as I wasn't sure if the peanut butter cups would make them seem too artificial or store bought. The dough has a very nice flavour and texture that complments the pb cup. I did put the peanut butter cups in the freezeer while I made the dough--were very easy to handle then. The pb cups soften just enough to come together with the warm dough. They kept nicely for a few days and did not dry out as I thought they might. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for a great recipe."
"2","5","A hit everytime."
"2","5","Omg good. Loved this recipe and so easy"
"2","5","A delicious cookie. Made them exactly as stated and took along to my quilting group. There were none left."
"2","5","Very easy and very good. Made at Christmas and will make again and will also include as a Christmas traditional cookie."
"2","4","I thought these were very nifty, easy to make cookies. I think the cookies themselves needed to be more peanut butter-y so next time I will add more peanut butter. Went over very well with the family!"
"2","5","Recipe works great as is. Didn't have enough cups, so I added chocolate chips to the last of the dough and the cookies were just as good!"
"2","5","I followed the direction exactly but instead of letting them cool in the pan I immediately removed them from the pan (very gently with a small spoon) after pressing in the peanut butter cups, so they wouldn't continue cooking in the pan. It made them extra soft and yummy! Fabtastic recipe overall! Everyone loved them!"
"2","5","Perfect! I cut the Reese peanut butter cups in half to make them go further. It was the perfect size for the cookies, not overpowering. Delicious and a new tradition for Christmas time!"
"2","5","Love it!! Yes freezing the peanut butter cups are important part, or it will be hard to push them inside the hot dough when you take it out of the oven"
"2","5","delicious! I used other kinds of chocolates for a variety of flavors"
"2","5","Made these for a camping trip. I didn't have peanut butter cups so I just used chocolate chips for the middle. Everyone loved them."
"2","5","These are delicious! They were a big hit at Christmas and they looked so cute."
"2","5","Very good! And easy; my daughter loved unwrapping and pressing the mini cups into the cookies :) Will keep this recipe for sure!"
"2","5","This was a GREAT recipe! I will definitely be making these cookies again. I put the candy in the freezer for 30 minutes first to make them hard. Next, I unwrapped ALL candy and put them back in the freezer. I followed the recipe as written. Then I put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes to make it easier to roll. After taking the cookies out the oven, I let them sit for 7 minutes before putting the candy in it. I left them on top of the stove to allow the hardened candy to slightly melt and then put them in the fridge to let them to set. Before serving, I let them sit out at room temp for 10 minutes."
"2","5","I made these cookies for a christmas party at work, and they were a big hit. My manager even asked me how much I would charge him to bake some for him. If you love reese's cup, this is a must-try recipe. They are fun and easy to make-even my seven year-old son enjoyed making these with me."
"2","5","very yummy my husband loved them to much"
"2","4","Great recipe for the 'peanut butter lover'... I followed the recipe exactly however I did use paper mini-muffin cups. It makes it easy to remove from the mini-muffin cooking tray :)"
"2","5","I did not read the instructions carefully and put the frozen mini peanut butter cup in the cookie before baking. I used a cookie scoop to plop the dough balls on the cookie sheet and then pushed a frozen peanut butter cup inside before baking for 8 minutes. They were perfect and delicious!"
"2","5","These are an immediate favorite! I cook for 9 minutes and they come out perfect every time. They get gobbled up in no time!"
"2","5","These are a hit every time I make them. I like these cookies better than Peanut Butter Kiss cookies. I use a cookie scoop which speeds the pan-loading process and mini muffin paper cups which makes it easier to lift the cookies out of the pan.  I've made these a regular item in my cookie gift boxes at Christmas."
"2","5","These are easy to make and have a wonderful peanut butter and chocolate flavor. A great recipe for my office cookie exchange."
"2","5","All I can say is...AWESOME!!!!"
"2","4","Nice recipe! I followed it exactly except I used Hershey's kisses instead of peanut butter cups. I'm not sure what I did wrong though because I only got about 22 cookies out of this. They weren't huge either! I'd double the recipe if you want 40."
"2","5","Very easy to make! Family loved them!!! New family favorite!"
"2","5","i have a very similar recipe that i have used for years to great success. we melt semi sweet chocolate chips with a 1teaspoon of vanilla extract and a few tablespoons of butter and mix in about 1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar. spoon on top to cover peanut butter cup and let set. we think it adds to the flavor and appearance of the cookie."
"2","5","I made these exactly as the recipe states except for the fact that I didn't have mini muffin tins. They are absolutely amazing! I have requests to bring them to two more parties this week. You can try rolling the balls in sugar before baking for extra deliciousness!"
"2","5","These are awesome and addictive!!"
"2","5","Everyone for whom I have made these LOVES these cookies...my only tip is to cook them exactly as long as the recipe says. Even if they don't look all the way done when you take them out, they will cook a little more in the pan."
"2","5","These were a BIG hit!"
"2","5","I have made these for years and they are always a hit. They are also really good using the white chocolate peanut butter cups. In a pinch you can even use the refrigerated cookie dough in a roll."
"2","5","Absolutely perfect. Neeeds no a;terations, just right as is"
"2","5","All my husband could say was yummm. Easy to make. If you like peanut butter this is a perfect cookie."
"2","5","Very easy recipe to follow and my kids love these. I made them last year for Christmas, I add green food coloring to them to make them into Christmas cookies & the kids are requesting them again this year. I followed the recipe as written and they came out perfectly."
"2","5","Made the recipe as written, with two exceptions. I was out of milk so I used half and half with a bit of water. I don't have mini muffin tins so i scooped them with my cookie scoop on a sheet pan. Worked great! Will make again."
"2","5","Very good! I make them every year for our cookie exchange. Everyone loves em. Be careful when baking, they burn rather easy."
"2","5","I got this recipe at a cookie swap and I wanted to double check all the ingredient amounts. They came out great! Now I just have to hide them from my boyfriend!!"
"2","5","These were delicious... I used the recipe for 40 cookies but was able to get approximately 51 from the recipe. I am not complaining as it provided with a lot of yummy extras. :)"
"2","5","HUGE HIT! :) My husband and I work at a College, and I baked them for our student leaders at his campus and mine, well, they are all begging for round two!!!  I didn't have the mini-muffin tin, they were fine rolled into a ball with a thumb print before baking. I put the peanut butter cups in the fridge as some suggested, great idea! :) Will make again...as per the begging!!"
"2","5","WOW! Big hit with the kids and my husband. Easy to make and child friendly. Followed suggestion and froze the miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups before placing into balls. Clean up was a cinch!"
"2","5","Delicious! For lack of a mini muffin pan I placed rounded balls onto a cookie sheet. They still came out great!"
"2","4","Very sweet and easy to make, great for younger kids"
"2","5","We used hershey kisses and a cookie sheet, so they got pretty flat, but were delicious!"
"2","4","yes, they were good, although I would have liked them a little more chewy and not as flaky. probably my fault"
"2","5","Just made this recipe today and it turned out to be a hit! Not too sweet, just perfect! I do agree with storing the peanut butter cups in the fridge before placing them on the baked cookies though;-) its less messy."
"2","5","These are amazing cookies! Freeze the peanut butter cups before sticking them in the hot cookies. Once the cups have melted a little I push the down the rest of the way so they are leveled with the cookie. then you get chocolate/peanut butter in every taste."
"2","5","Awesome! Everyone loves these"
"2","5","I followed the recipe but also put them in the freezer, this really helped. I do suggest ONLY putting them in mini muffin tins for baking, they just look better this way and make sure you don't make the balls to big. They flatten out too much when you make them on a baking sheet. They are TO DIE FOR!!! THANKS!"
"2","5","Very excellent cookies only thing is I baked for the 8 minutes as sated and the insides were still doughie, I just left the next batch in for about 10 or 11 minutes and turned out great !! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us !"
"2","5","This recipe is the best! I made these cookies for my daughter, who usually doesn't go for the peanut butter and chocolate combination. But, she loved them! These were easy to make and tasted great as well. I made the 40 cookies, like the recipe makes, and ended up having to make more! They were very popular at our Cookie Crazed party! People were eating not 1 or 2 or 3 but the average amount for 1 person was 4! I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone! Except if they're allergic to peanuts!! :)"
"2","4","Added cream instead of milk - cookies were a little dry - but, super yummy! Will make again!"
"2","5","This is the best cookie I've ever made. Thank you so much!!!"
"2","5","Delicious! Followed the recipe as written and they turned out wonderful and got devoured. I plan on buying some bags of Reeses cups after Halloween on sale so I can make more for the holidays! HUGE hit at our squadron picnic!"
"2","5","These came out great! I didn't have mini muffin pans, so I used the regular size muffin/cupcake pans. I just made some of the dough balls a little bit bigger than others. The shape changed on some because of this, but it worked out perfectly. These are excellent for the peanut butter-aholic. What I changed: I used light brown sugar, Splenda blend of sugar and Splenda, unbleached all purpose flour, all natural Skippy peanut butter, sea salt, organic skim milk. Slightly healthier version, although not entirely- it's a cookie! Great recipe."
"2","5","My husband craves these all the time, they are excellent!"
"2","5","Great cookies. Put the in the refrigerator before taking them out of the pan to avoid the cookie breaking. Freeze the peanut butter cups, it makes it easier to put in the cookie"
"2","5","These were great! I put the candy in the freezer while they baked to make handling them easier,. They were so simple and quick. I will be making them often!"
"2","5","Super Quick, Easy, and a definite crowd pleaser! These perfect bite size desserts were gone within minutes. I made a second batch two days later and doubled it! -- Amazing"
"2","5","Would give this a 10 if I could"
"2","5","Quick and easy. I love the mini muffin pan application. I was able to cook all 40 in 8 minutes!"
"2","3","These cookies are good. Easy to make. I just feel that they dry out pretty quick-hard to get just right. Seems to overcook when you cook the cookie part and get the candy added right-without melting too much. Fun, easy, kids enjoy. Just not a cookie I crave-stick to making the peanut butter cookie and eating it then end with a Reese's cup-seperate works better for me-to get maximum taste of both. Two great things together don't always make awesome."
"2","5","I have been making these cookies for my family for 30 years. This is a must for holidays and wonderful for fundraisers for schools. You can freeze these and take out when needed. My family would be very disappointed if these were not made."
"2","5","What more do you have to say...peanut butter and chocolate! That is perfect. I sometimes use a peanut butter cookie mix when in a hurry. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","very good, easy to make"
"2","5","Tasty and easy to make."
"2","5","Flawless. LOVE them - and I agree with the rest. Don't bake for more than 8 minutes even though it's tempting. They'll turn out perfectly - promise!! YUM!!!"
"2","5","This is great!!! Make sure to unwrap the candies before hand and pop them in the freezer. and 8 minutes is plenty don't over do it."
"2","5","Fan Favorite"
"2","5","Fantastic cookies. Made exactly and turned out great. Also added some peanut butter chips to the dough the second time and that was good as well."
"2","5","Peanut butter cups are my favorite candy, so you can imagine how much I loved these cookies! You won't be disappointed!"
"2","5","Yup. 5 stars it is. It's true that these are delicious but also fun looking. I tripled the recipe and kept 2/3 in the freezer for next time/surprise visitors. Awesome!"
"2","5","These are amazing!!! My husband is In law enforcement an people on his shift are requesting me to make some for them! The only thing is I baked them 11 min an they kinda look not done still but once they cool an set......perfecto!!!!"
"2","5","My husband loves peanut butter cups and anything that combines pb and chocolate. These are his absolute favorite cookie now. They will be a staple in my own cookie recipes from now on."
"2","5","These completely deserve their five star rating! I tried them out as a contribution for a bake sale and they were a huge hit! I baked the cookies in a mini muffin pan and pressed the peanut butter cup into the center immediately after removing from the oven. Then I popped the whole tray into the freezer for a couple minutes before removing the cookies to a cooling rack. I had no problems with the recipe as written at all. This is going to be my new alternative at Christmas time instead of my go-to family favorite of peanut butter cookies with a hershey's kiss on top. Thanks for the dynamite recipe!"
"2","5","Yum!"
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly, and they are absolutely delicious!!!"
"2","5","These cookies are ORGASMIC :D i LOVE Reese's Peanut Butter cups already, but putting them into a cookie takes it to a whole other level!!!! :D"
"2","5","YUM! I didn't have peanut butter cups or a mini muffin pan on hand so I just made them with chocolate chips, these are fantastic! I agree with several others, the cookies don't look done after 8 min, but they are!"
"2","5","This recipe is fast, easy, and yields a pleasingly perfect little 'cookie' (I think it's more like a candy). I recommend freezing the peanut butter cups before pressing them into warm cookies. Being placed in a warm cookie makes the peanut butter cups melt, but starting from frozen, they are sure to hold their shape. Best not to remove cookies from pans until they are truly cooled."
"2","5","Great recipe! VERY easy to make. Perfect for desert trays for any occasion."
"2","5","absolutely the best cookie ever!"
"2","5","Easy and Awesome! We tried different variations of this as well (enclosing pb cup with the cookie dough), which were also great."
"2","5","Wow... I followed this recipe to the tee and its was perfect!! These cookies are so awsume, although I didnt have any myself, but my son and husband loved these!! good job!"
"2","5","perfect cookies to make with the kids, easy and fun to make and so good to eat. This is my new Christmas classic."
"2","5","Amazing! I didn't use the mini muffin pan and they turned out fine! My new favorite cookie recipe!"
"2","5","yummy!!! All I have to say!!"
"2","5","These cookies are a big hit at desert tables and bake sales. Really easy to make. I use the peanut butter cookie recipe from the Jiff Peanut butter jar."
"2","5","I rate my way 5 stars and it is so much easier. Save yourself a lot of trouble and buy the peanut butter cookies in a roll that are found in the refrigerator section. Cut roll into 10 equal portions then cut each portion in 4 pieces (you will end up with 40 pieces= 40 cookies). Place 1 piece in MINI MUFFIN PAN, bake 350 for 6 minutes, push peanut butter cup in each cookie and bake for 2 additional minutes. Let cool about 10 minutes and remove with butter knife. I place them on a flat paper bag until cool. The refrigerator idea sounds good also. You can also use sugar cookies as a variation; however, spray the mini muffin pan with Pam because they are not as greasy as peanut butter cookies."
"2","5","Excellent! I used whole wheat flour and the nutty taste just added to the overall apeal of the cookies. These did not last long out of the oven. Making more tomorrow."
"2","5","i liked these cookies a lot ! they were really good and tasty. we put in some rolo candies because we ran out of peanut butter cups but they were just as good ! i think it was too much peanut butter but that is just me. all together they were amazing cookies !"
"2","5","they turned out to be very good. They when as well as i hoped for. If I could change one thing id make them a little bit bigger but overall the were very good"
"2","3","I followed everything to a tee & took some reviewers tips but they still fell apart. I'll stick to my other peanut butter recipe."
"2","5","These are too good to be true!"
"2","5","Yummy! I'm not usually a fan of the ones with the Hershey Kiss but these are soo good. I used natural peanut butter and added just a bit more sugar to make up for the sweetness. I wasn't sure how they would turn out with the change but you couldn't tell. A new Christmas favorite!!"
"2","5","I followed this recipe to a 't' and it was delicious! I'll make this again and again, alternating with reese's and kisses in the center. VERY good! And my cookies never turn out!"
"2","5","Wonderful cookies. Everything about them is perfect."
"2","5","For you peanut butter & chocolate lovers out there, these are the cookies for you! I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out perfect, this is a very easy cookie to make. Make sure that you freeze the PBcups first. My first batch I made sure they were frozen and it worked great, but my second batch had been sitting at room temp for a little while and they started to melt right away, making the cookie not look as nice."
"2","5","These are definitely a 5 star cookie. When my husband commented about how good they are, I knew I had found a recipe worth keeping. :)"
"2","3","I wanted to like this recipe very much. I wanted to serve them at a party tomorrow but they taste to doughy for my taste. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just not my taste. My child and husband did not like them either. Sigh. Sorry."
"2","5","yummy! My family could not stop eating these! I baked them in pumpkin mini muffin liners and added thanksgiving sprinkles while it was still warm. too cute! advice- make sure you don't overcook these! even a few minutes too long and they will be hard."
"2","5","These have been a hit every time I have made them. I always add sprinkles to the tops of them while the chocolate is soft and they stay in place."
"2","5","These are phenomenal - definitely some of the best cookies I've ever had! Some advice - use the mini muffin pan to make them if you want them to look like the picture. They still taste the same even if you don't, but they look much prettier this way."
"2","5","These are ridiculously good. A huge hit with everyone!!"
"2","5","Absolutely scrumptious. But instead of rolling into balls, try using mini muffin pans. Easier and the perfect size. Once they come out of the oven, place the peanut butter cup inside and let them cool that way."
"2","5","These are great, but my cooking time was more like 12 to 15 mins. even in a pre-heated oven. I would make these again."
"2","5","I followed the directions exactly the way it was written, and these are superb!! I will be baking a double batch next time; my family absolutely loves these!!"
"2","4","These were good but a bit dry. I may have over cooked them a bit so might be me and not the recipe. Used mini peanut butter cups in some, rollos in some, white chocolate peanut butter cups in some, and hershey kisses in others."
"2","5","Excellent!!! Very easy. the onlything I did differently was use mini muffin tins"
"2","5","I made these for my boyfriend's work party! Everyone loved them!"
"2","5","I typically don't like peanut butter cookies, but these are delicious! I made them last week then had a request for them this weekend. I took the advice of others and chilled the peanut butter cups, unwrapping them while the cookies were baking. I pressed them into the cookies as soon as they were done baking. Afterwards, I put them in the fridge to cool. I only have 1 mini tin, so I balled the rest up and put them on a cookie sheet, but they are a lot better in the tin!"
"2","5","These are the prettiest cookies I have ever made. I followed the review by RETROGIRL35. I froze my peanut butter cups and while the cookies were baking I unwrapped them. I had to bake my cookies for 10 minutes. Let them cool in the pan for 5 minutes then pressed in the peanut butter cups. Then put the whole pan in the fridge for 10 minutes. They pop out easily and look wonderful! I used a mini muffin tin that has 24 cups in it and ended up with 45 cookies. I used my small cookie scoop to make them all the same size. My daughter LOVES them. This from the child who says she doesn't like peanut butter cookies. I didn't tell her there was peanut butter in the cookie itself. buaaahahahahah!!"
"2","5","use chunky peanut butter! delicious! I didn't make them in mini muffin pan because I didn't have one, so I just formed the cookies into balls, and this recipe made about 25. I made half with reeses mini cups and half with hershey kisses stuck in the top. everyone loved 'em!"
"2","5","This recipe was so easy and everyone loved it! I am already looking for an excuse to make it again."
"2","5","mmmmm so yummy! i rolled the dough into the balls and then placed them on cookie sheets and i used hershey kisses instead of pb cups. i never thought i'd say this about cookies but they are so pretty!"
"2","5","THE BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER MADE!! SUPER SIMPLE! TIP: have butter cups ready as soon as you take them out of the oven!!! LOVE THESE!!!!"
"2","5","Amazing recipe, best when eaten warm all the chocolate melts in your mouth :)"
"2","4","These were very good. They didn't even last an entire day. The only problem I had was that some of the cookies didn't want to come out of the pan so I suggest that you grease the pans."
"2","5","awesome !!!!!! I put the peanut butter cups in the freezer 4 like 10 mins it made them easier to peel. Will make again = )"
"2","5","Very tasty. I made these for my kids (who love peanut butter). Needless to say, they didn't last very long. Like others, I froze the peanut butter cups and removed wrappers prior to making the cookies. The texture of the cookie dough turned out great (when following recipe instructions). Easy cookies to make. A little time consuming. Well worth the time to make these little gems. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","Excellent Recipe. Easy to make, I used a cookie sheet since I did not have the mini muffin pan. Also I had to cook them for 15 min. I think next time I am going to use Hershey Kisses."
"2","5","I am a little confused as to why everyone says these turned out perfect. Don't get me wrong, these are a great cookie and will be my go-to peanut butter cookie, however, the consistency was far too gooey to be rolled into balls. The texture was like that of a drop cookie (which was fine because I didn't intend to press in a peanut butter cup). They tasted great though and were nice and soft, just the way I like my cookies. One change I did make though was baking them at 350 degrees for just under 8 minutes."
"2","5","Love it when I follow a recipe exactly and it turns out perfectly on the first try. I did follow others' tips to freeze PB cups before and after unwrapping, and I cooled the cookies in the fridge before removing from pan. Unwrapping all the PB cups kept my 3yo and 5yo busy while I made the dough (yes!). I doubled the recipe and got 73."
"2","5","These cookies are AMAZING!!! A note to those who do not have a mini muffin tin (something the recipe should mention in the beginning): The dough came out very wet before I even added the milk, so I left it out and added another 1/3 cup flour instead and made cookies. I pressed the cups in right after taking out of the over (have them unwrapped and ready) and they turned out just fine. Probably the best cookies I've ever had."
"2","5","Always good for your chocolate-peanut butter fix!"
"2","5","I made these today and they are excellent! This recipe has the same ingredients as the Peanut Blossoms II from Allrecipes. Instead of putting the dough into mini muffin pans, I placed the balls of dough 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. It was so easy to remove them and made the clean up easier. If I don't have the peanut butter cups, I will put a chocolate kiss into each cookie, instead. I also made less servings because I wanted more cookie to go with the peanut butter cup. I will make these again and again."
"2","4","I just baked these cookies they are very good....i had baked them on a cookie sheet and they turned out kind of flat so my suggestion use the mini muffin tins..they would work alot better ..."
"2","5","So good! I used a PB cookie mix to save time, and dark chocolate Reeses PB cups. They were picture perfect. Disappeared fast, too."
"2","5","These cookies at Christmas are always the first to go! So simple yet so yummy!!!"
"2","5","Easy and yummy, what more can I say? I sent these for Christmas this year and I had to stop myself from eating all of them before they went into the cookie tins!"
"2","5","these cookies are great! i have so many people who reqeust them from me now almost every week!! they are the best cookies ever!"
"2","5","My family, my extended family and everyone else who has tried these loves them. More of a muffin than a good and very good!"
"2","5","these are delicious, and so nice and easy! Also, they look cute and everyone always seems to really enjoy them. I follow the recipe exactly."
"2","5","This is now one of my favorite cookies. I made this for the family and my friends and they kept wanting more. My brother ate 30 of them in less than 3 mins. I recommend putting the peanut butter cups into the freezer for a while. I unwraped mine before putting them into the freezer so I did not have to unwrap them when they are already cold. Thanks for the amazing recipe"
"2","5","I make these every year for the holidays. Peanut Butter fanatics will love them! I know I do!"
"2","5","Wonderful! I made according to directions except I needed to bake mine for abt 9 1/2 mins to get them done enough. Definately freezing the peanut butter cups first helped alot! Everyone loved these!"
"2","5","Best cookies ever! I made cookies for Christmas every year and these are the favorite across the board. I've been asked not to buy gifts for anyone anymore, just to make tons of these cookies. Fun to make also. I would recommend using Pam spray on the mini muffin pan before starting. I spray it on & use a paper towel to wipe excess. It makes it easier to get the cookies out of the pan. Also make sure you refridgerate the mini reeses cups before putting them in the cookie, it helps prevent too much melting. After I put the reeses cup into the cookie, I put the pan in the fridge or freezer for 2 minutes to help the cookies set faster."
"2","5","Really amazing. To make them a bit less high fat, I replaced half of the butter with applesauce - so used half a stick of butter and one single serving cup of no sugar added applesauce. You can't taste the applesauce at all - just less greasy. No need to use muffin cups, I just put them on a silpat on a baking sheet. Push refrigerated Reeses cups in, then go back and push them once more - as they have melted a bit they will sink a bit further into the cookie. Tastes amazing."
"2","5","Also good with Hershey's kisses"
"2","5","These are really good. Follow other reviewers and wait for the cookies to sink a little before adding the candy, it will prevent cracking. I've also made these with mini Snickers and Milky Way. I make a double batch, roll them into balls and freeze them. When I want to make cookies I just give them a little thaw and it's good to go. Enjoy"
"2","5","Simple concept, big flavor! I used a pre-packaged peanut butter cookie mix for this and bought the bag of Reese's PB cups with white, milk, and dark chocolate cups. Sent with my husband for his kids at work for the holidays and they were gone in no time flat. Very addicting!"
"2","5","Pure awesome! Made just as recipe said. I hid the peanut butter cups in the freezer for a few days so they were nice and hard. I don't know how you would be able to push them in there if they were at room temperature. Eat them up fast...they are so much better melty warm!"
"2","5","I have made these cookies for years and they are always a hit. The only difference is that I have always used pre-made PillsbuRy Peanut Butter cookie dough. They come out perfect every time and taste just as good as the homemade cookie dough.......and SO MUCH SIMPLER! They can be made in a matter of minutes. It takes longer to unwrap all the peanut butter cups than it does to make the cookies!"
"2","5","These were really easy, freeze the candy before and they will come out great!"
"2","5","These are the best cookies ever! Always a crowd pleaser. Using a mini muffin pan is the easiest way to have them keep their shape."
"2","5","They were the hit of the Chirstmas tray."
"2","5","Great cookies! Too bad it's too late for Christmas. Next year I'm going to box these up as gifts. I skipped the refrigerate and roll into balls step and just used a scoop. You don't have to freeze the pbc's, just refrigerate them and they press right in, we didn't crack one."
"2","5","Excellent followed directions to a T and would not change anything."
"2","5","Just remember to open the pb cups BEFORE you start baking the cookies!! Unless you have helpers, you'll be racing the timer if you don't! ;)"
"2","5","So easy to make! These went like hot cakes."
"2","5","I got a full 4 dozen cookies from this recipe (and it wasn't nearly enough, they were so good!)"
"2","5","By far...my FAVORITE cookie. The family thought so as well. Very simple to make and such a rewarding flavor."
"2","5","I tried these for the first time Christmas day and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were! We love peanut butter cookies and cups so perfect match in my opinion. I lined my mini muffin pan with small paper cups and used a cookie scoop to shape the dough into balls. Doing it this way, I had to cook them 12 min and as another reviewer suggested, I too let them cool in the freezer for 5 minutes after inserting the candy cups. I used both peanut butter cups and Chocolate Hershey Kisses. They also freeze very well. Good thing, or else I might eat a whole batch by myself!"
"2","5","I personally loved the taste of these, they were very delicious! I did make the mistake of using our electric beater during the whole entire process (my husband told me I shouldn't have done that) so I had to add a little more flour to shape them into balls easier but it turned out just fine! Another person suggested freezing the peanut butter cups before so when you push them in they don't break. I wish I had followed this advice because mine did melt and break a lot when I was pushing them in. 8 minutes is just enough time - any longer and they would have burnt so don't think it's not a lot of time because it's just right!! These are simply tasty. Gave them to our friend for Christmas as well and they loved them."
"2","5","AMAZING recipe! When I first met my husband he told me he didn't like cookies and didn't care for sweets. I made him these for his birthday shortly after we started dating and he devoured them! I roll the balls in sugar before baking them and it adds a great crunch to the outside. I've also done them on a cookie sheet as well as the mini muffin pans and either way works. But to get the cookie completely around the candy then it's best to use the muffin pan."
"2","5","Awesome, easy recipe! Nothing else to say!!"
"2","5","A good cookie and easy to make. I did freeze chocolates first afte reading the reviews. I also bought an assortment of peanut butter cup, Rollos, and Kisses...all excellent to use."
"2","5","So, so good! By far the best cookie recipe I have found on this website. The peanut butter cookie is delicious on its own, but once you bite into the cup....oh my it's peanut butter heaven! I am so very glad I tried this recipe! A million thank you's!!!!"
"2","5","Tip: I like to make them small - about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. These are some of the best cookies I've ever made. I actually won 'Best Cookie' at a cookie party with these. They are a perennial favorite."
"2","5","perfect!! These cookies were a hit! I didn't have a mini muffin pan so baked them on a cookie sheet, came out great! 8 minutes is just right."
"2","4","Great recipe. If you have a sweet tooth, this cookie is for you. It's definitely a rich/sweet cookie. My batch made me 32 cookies. I froze the cups ahead of time. The only problem I had was that a few of them got destroyed while trying to take them out of the mini-cupcake tin. The ring around the cup would fall apart. I think I tried to take them out too early so make sure they cool COMPLETELY before taking them out so that you don't end up having a bunch that are destroyed."
"2","5","Loved this cookie recipe! Just a few tips: Unwrap the peanut butter cups, place in a plastic zip-top bag, and put in the freezer ahead of time (at least an hour). Mix up the dough and pop it into the fridge for about an hour to chill. The cookies are easier to roll into balls then. When you pull the mini muffin pan out of the oven and press in the peanut butter cups, pop the whole pan into the fridge for a few minutes. This keeps the cups from melting too much. I'm also going to try and use mini muffin pan liners (I didn't the first time and they were great) next time. Also, these cookies freeze very well after they are made: put on a paper plate, place in a freezer gallon size ziptop bag, and pull them out when needed :)"
"2","5","Great recipe and no fail! I definitely recommend adding this one to your 'holiday classic cookies' recipes for years. Thanks!"
"2","5","My seven year old son said he would give this five thousand stars! The recipe is great as is! I doubled the recipe and it made six dozen exactly. We made these for Christmas and added sprinkles to make it more festive. Put the cold, unwrapped peanut butter cups in the cookie immediately after pulling from oven to prevent cracking. Then, after the top starts to melt a bit (five minutes?) add sprinkles. I placed the whole muffin tray in the fridge for 20-30 minutes before removing cookies from tray. They came out very easily. I can't wait to share these beautiful and tasty treats! Thank you for the recipe!!"
"2","5","Very Yummy, will make again!"
"2","5","These cookies were a great hit at my party and with my family. Everyone came back for 2nds!! Tip: freeze the peanut butter cups and poke them deep into the cookies."
"2","5","Absolutely perfect. I made a 2nd batch the next day because the 1st batch went in 24 hours!!"
"2","5","Absolutely the most easiest cookies I've baked. As other reviewers suggested, I put the peanut butter cookies in the freezer before I pushed them into the cooked batter. This recipe is definitely going into my saved file! Thank you."
"2","5","Made these as written except I used unsalted butter and I used a small scoop. real easy to make and you sure won't eat just one.."
"2","5","Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to the perfect cookie recipe. Perfect for any occasion, perfect in every way! Don't change a thing!"
"2","5","MMMMM-MMMMM Needed something peanut buttery for the Christmas tins & these were WONDERFUL!! Followed Retrogirl35's suggestions & they came out perfect. I used my one & only 2 tsp cookie scoop which yielded 48, so I was a few pb cups short. Also, tried using mini liners for a couple but the sides did not crisp up and centers were slightly underdone. Much better without them."
"2","5","DELICIOUS! unwrap and freeze pb cups 1st. Other than that, dont change a thing. A friend told this was the only thing she wanted for her xmas gift. Next time i am going to try hershey kisses. yum."
"2","5","Turned out great amd very easy. I will make again for sure."
"2","5","These are so easy and taste great! Half way through I ran out of peanut butter cups so I put M&Ms in them, they looked like cute easter cookies. They tasted increadable! my family liked the M&M's better than the peanutbutter cups."
"2","5","Yum :) These cookies were delicious. Everyone loved them. I'll definitely make them again and I wouldn't change a thing!"
"2","5","These are delicious and are a huge hit wherever I take them. If I'm really being lazy, I just use refrigerated PB cookie dough. Quick & Easy & Tasty!"
"2","5","Perfect! Put the peanut butter cups in the freezer based upon others coments and followed the other directions exactly. Easy and highly recommended!"
"2","2","I did not care for these. I did however, use store bought sugar cookie dough, which I think was a mistake because they were way too sweet. Even my 12 yr old thought they were too sweet. They were also difficult to get out of the pan. I would try them again with a peanut butter cookie."
"2","4","I didn't have enough PB cups so I dipped the cookies in melted chocolate and set them in the freezer for 10 min."
"2","5","I just finished baking these cookies and they are yummy! I only yielded 24 but I think I used a cookie scoop that was too big:(. My 4 year old just told me that ' these are the best cookies in the whole entire world you made' I followed the recipe just as written and it' wonderful. I did however freeze the PB cups so they didn't totally melt on impact. These are a perfect combo of PB and chocolate."
"2","5","These are excellent and easy to prepare. I made them for several cookie gift trays last Christmas and plan on making them again this year. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly and cookies were AMAZING!!!! Will definitely make again and again!!! Thanks=)"
"2","5","Everyone loved these! I actually cheated and used the same peanut butter cookie dough I was using for the peanut blossoms, but everyone though they were great! That little extra peanut butter from the pb cup added that little extra umph. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","4","These cookies are quite tasty, though I did have one person say they were a little greasy. I made them as the recipe stated except I used margarine instead of butter, but I doubt that would make the difference since I always use margarine instead of butter (just a personal taste preference). I used a regular muffin pan since I didn't have a mini muffin pan (the recipe made around 30 cookies). I extended the baking time to 10 minutes. They didn't look done, but I took them out anyway. I also froze the peanut butter cups as many others suggested. I refrigerated them for a few minutes after inserting the peanut butter cups. They came out really good and look very nice. I think next time I'll try adding mini chocolate chips to the cookie batter."
"2","5","I have been making these for years the lazy way. Buy chocolate chip cookie dough in the tube in the refrigerated section of you grocery store.Spoon about 2/3 full into mini muffin liners. bake at 350deg. for about 15 min. take them out of oven and immediately press mini peanut butter cup into each. These are everyones favorite. A helpful hint. have you peanut butter cups unwrapped ahead of time. It make about 4 doz. SJS"
"2","5","I got this recipe at least 20 years ago from a co-worker and have made them every year at the holidays and they are a hit! You must use a mini muffin pan and yes they don't look done when finished baking but they are! These are the best!"
"2","5","These cookies were easy to make and they taste delicious! I will definitely be making these a regular cookie in my repetoire!"
"2","5","SO ooey gooey good! These were gone within minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didnt have a mini muffin pan, so I used a regular baking pan and they still came out amazing! Thanks!!"
"2","5","Very, very good! Who could resist chocolate and peanut butter?"
"2","4","These cookies are very good, especially if you love peanut butter and chocolate! Very easy to make and the timing in the oven was right on. If you put these in the fridge, be sure to take them out and come to room temperature to get the full flavor they offer."
"2","5","I loved these. I tried using both peanut butter cups and chocolate kisses, and everyone agreed that the cups made them better. I got tons of compliments from the group I served them to!"
"2","5","Wow! I just made these and I couldn't resist trying a warm cookie. OMG! The cookie is superb with a gooey center. I will most definitely be making these little treasures again!"
"2","5","Absolutely fabulous. My husband adores these. All times and ingredients are perfect so don't alter a thing! :)"
"2","5","AMAZING!"
"2","5","Hubby gives these 5 stars. I remembered I had used all of my eggs on lemon bars after I had my heart set on making these so I looked up egg substitute for baking and found this: mix together 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp oil & 2 Tbsps water or milk. I don't know if it worked but it didn't hurt. I used crunchy peanut butter & made 20 on one large cookie sheet and 20 in a mini-muffin pan. The muffin pan worked much better, covering the entire side of the peanut butter cup while the cookie had it sticking up quite a bit. I'll take these to a B-day party tomorrow & report back. UPDATE: everyone loved them!"
"2","5","I found these to be pretty good, but after the first batch, I realized they were a bit too rich. I then used a regular cookie sheet instead of a mini-muffin pan, making small balls of dough. I cut the peanut butter cups in half so that when the cookies were done baking, I could either stick in the bottom or top half of a peanutbutter cup. They turned out great and still looked good! I also took the suggestion of cooling the dough in the fridge and freezing the peanutbutter cups."
"2","4","I made these cookies b/c I had a bag of Peanut Butter Cups left over from an event. These cookies are to DIE FOR! I followed the directions as stated using the mini muffin pan. I tried one right out of the oven and it was purely sinful. I put the pan in the ice box so the chocolates would not melt. I am planning on sharing these cookies w/ friends as to not eat the whole thing. Also, my four year old son and 2 year old daughter helped me make these and loved the reward of unwrapping all the peanut butter cups. I also doubled the vanilla."
"2","5","A really impressive presentation and tastes delicious. I made them both ways in the mini tins and just on a cookie sheet. Both work just fine. I froze the peanut butter cups for ease of use. I also cooled the finished cookies before removing from the tins. Easy to make, but look more difficult."
"2","5","Yummy. Very easy to make. I put peanut butter cups in the freezing while prepping. After adding them in I put them under the broiler for a minute, and then spread the edges. Peanut butter cups are my favourite chocolate, a great way to enjoy them."
"2","4","I made these using Smart Balance peanut butter(has added flax seed oil) and they turned out good but a little oily. Natural-style peanut better would have been much better."
"2","5","Exceptionally good recipe..easy to make, tasted great and went over like gangbusters at a recent bake sale. I didn't change a thing with the recipe and did use the small muffin tins as suggested."
"2","5","Crazy good!! I used a cookie sheet instead of a muffin tin with no problem. I also made a tiny divet in each cookie when I baked by second batch, and the peanut butter cups pressed into the cookies beautifully. For all Canadians, I used President's Choice Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Melts, which are in the candy aisle of Zehr's, Fortino's, etc. Delish!"
"2","5","My grandfather's favorite!! Easy to make too. I make the dough and scoop it right into the mini cupcake pan, refridgerate for a while then cook them! they are fast and easy. the hardest thing about them is unwrapping all of teh reese's cups (without eating them!) They are not as good if you just make them into cookies, they almost aren't sweet enough, but make them as directed and you will not be upset! (use other candies too like mini snickers!!)"
"2","5","Made the recipe exactly as written. Very yummy! I did freeze the peanut butter cups first so that they didn't melt too quickly when pushed into the hot cookies. Everyone loved them."
"2","5","these cookies are awesome. they come out perfectly. i used granulated brown sugar instead of regular only because my mom accidentally picked up the wrong thing, but they still came out perfect. i followed RETROGIRL35's advice (besides refrigerating the dough). the p.b. cups slide right in without any cracking. the only thing i would say is that they are more like cupcakes than cookies; they're not all that crispy or chewy like chocolate chip cookies, especially the bottoms, they're really cake-like. not that this is a bad thing."
"2","5","Have to agree with the masses - these are definitely worthy of 5 stars! And no, they are not overwhelmingly peanut buttery. The only change that I made was I used mini peanut butter cup bits (tiny peanut butter cups about the size of a chocolate chip), mixing them right into the dough. Also, I just used baking sheets, not a mini muffin pan. I did refrigerate these for about an hour which helped the cookies not flatten and the mini p/cups keep their shape. Really good cookies but be sure to have milk on hand."
"2","5","These cookies were awesome! At first, i thought they may be too peanut buttery, but no way...they turned out perfect! I really love the brown sugar that was in them. It made such a big difference. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"2","5","VERY good. I keep wanting to make them again, but last time I ended up sick because I couldn't stop eating them! =)"
"2","3","I followed the recipe and they just didn't come out like I expected, they were dry. I'd personally rather have the peanut butter cup plain."
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly. Refrigerated the dough before forming into balls. Kept the mini peanut butter cups in my freezer after I bought them, unwrapped them before I made the cookies and put back into the freezer. Put the cookies in the fridge after pressing the mini cup into them. Sooooooooooo yummy."
"2","5","careful not to overfill the muffin tins. i found that if you make them too big, the edges crumble. but this is by far the best cookie recipe yet. i had guests the other night and they finished the whole batch and could not stop raving about them! a keeper."
"2","5","I made these cookies according to the instructions and took the advice of freezing the peanut butter cups (a great tip, btw!). These cookies came out beautifully. I made them as part of the sweet selection for Boxing Day. Everyone talked about how good they were!"
"2","5","These are out of this world good. Everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks!"
"2","5","These were easy to make and tasted great! To make them more of a holiday cookie, roll the balls of dough in sugar with red & green sprinkles mixed in. Had to make a double batch the second time around b/c the first batch disappeared so quickly!"
"2","4","Made these for our Christmas Eve party and they were gone in as much as 5 minutes! I used margarine because I ran out of butter so they were a little too soft, but still delicious!"
"2","5","If I could rate this a 10, I would! Fantastic taste especially for such an easy recipe. Definite keeper. I chilled the dough and froze the mini pb cups. YUM!!"
"2","5","These are so good they should be outlawed. YUMMMMMMMMM Y"
"2","5","Yum! These cookies would be super even without the peanut butter cups!"
"2","5","I think these are the best cookies that I have ever had...no kidding. Don't change a thing in the recipe."
"2","5","Yummy. These are delicious and really easy to make."
"2","5","Excellent recipe and SOOOOO easy. I took the advice of others and froze the peanut butter cups first. Thanks so much"
"2","5","I really enjoy this recipe. Simple, ingredients I have on hand already (other than the candies) And I often make it with out the PB cups just for a PB cookie. If you take it out when the edges are set but before the middle is completely firm you get a chewy soft PB cookie. Delightful! I roll mine into balls, roll them in sugar and press them down with a fork criss cross, so you get the traditional marks. Fun to do with the kids."
"2","5","Awesome recipe. I made them last year for Christmas and people have been phoning me to request them this year!"
"2","5","I made these with hershey's kisses instead of the peanut butter cup. Absolutely delicious and foolproof!!!"
"2","5","This recipe is so good. I just made the cookies and my son gobbled them all up alrrady. They were so easy and fast to make. I'll offer a few tips. I upwrapped the pb cups and put them in the freezer th night before to make sure they were nice and frozen. I put the dough in the freezer for a 1/2 hour before making the balls. I used nonstick mini muffin pans makes the cookies easier to remove, and after inserting the pb cups I put the muffin pans in the fridge for 1/2 hour to cool off and let the pb cups harden again. This recipe is really great for anytime."
"2","4","Not that this recipe needs any more reviews, but I thought I'd toss my 2cents in anyway. First of all: delicious and easy! I wasn't certain how big a ball to roll, but after baking size really didn't seem to matter...smaller than a golf-ball, I'd say. What I DID learn is that muffin pans are great for making cookies! They stay uniform in shape, and look very presentable for cookie-trays. I've only used this recipe, but I'm sure others would be just as nice, although some may require spraying the pans. All in all...hubby loved them! Can't wait to try it out on friends on the weekend!"
"2","5","SOooooooooo good."
"2","5","These have been a favorite of our family for a LONG TIME. We use the mini muff pans and make the recipe at 4x for the Christmas season.Had always used the mini tin holders in the pan, haven't tried without them yet.Great deal maybe with the extra we save on the holders we can make MORE! We never put them in the fridge or freezer we let them cool naturally. This lets the peanut butter cup melt within the cookie.We also simply refrigerate the Reeses and seems to work just fine.However you choose to make them enjoy!"
"2","5","It's a keeper!! I love peanut butter and chocolate. I went back and forth between using a muffin pan and a cookie sheet. My cookies turned out looking the most attractive. I also had to use raw sugar in place of brown sugar. I couldn't tell the difference. Can't wait to share these on Thanksgiving!"
"2","5","I have been making this recipe for about a year now and LOVE it! I follow the recipe exactly. I always make batches ahead of time and freeze them then bring them out around the holidays. I have used all different tpyes of cups for the center, caramel cups, mint chocolate etc and they are all great."
"2","5","These are so darn good! And best of all they are so easy to make. The batch I made disappeared within a couple of hours. The only thing I would recommend that was not mentioned in the recipe is to refrigerate the dough for an hour before baking. It makes it much easier to scoop into the muffin pan. I would highly recommend this recipe! It's a sure crowd pleaser!"
"2","5","I made these for my classmates as a 'Yay Its Friday Treat'. They we're all eaten up in less then ten minutes and the crumbs we're fought over."
"2","5","Let me tell you, these are addictive, make with extreem caution! They are so good. I made them for a bake sale for the church where the proceeds went to fight childhood hunger, they were sold within minutes, people who bought them wated to come back for more!"
"2","5","The only change I made was to use Splenda in place of the white sugar. Super easy recipe. I made about 60 cookies, and since I was making them for a party, I made them in mini muffin liners. Put the pans in the freezer/refrigerator immediately after I placed the peanut butter cup into the cookie. They firmed up in about 45 minutes. Thanks so much for the great recipe!"
"2","5","delicious! amazingly easy, and the muffin tin is not necessary; I like the quirky, more handmade-look of baking them on a cookie sheet. They flatten nicely this way, just be sure to insert the PBcups fairly straight. If they lean, they will ooze as they melt."
"2","5","Great recipe to make with kids,very tasty, very easy unwrapping the peanut cups was the mase time consuming. one recomondation that i can make is to let cookies coolin pan just untill they are able to hold their shape otherwise if they are completely cold it's very hard to remove from pan."
"2","5","These cookies were amazing! I had to use what I had though, as my friends found my peanut butter cups in the freezer! So I used Nestle's peanut butter and chocolate chip morsels instead and they turned out great! I made 6 jumbo/chunky cookies and 12 regular cookies. I can't wait to try it with the candy cups! Thanks for sharing-"
"2","5","MmM my husband loved them! if you're a peanut butter lover then these cookies are for you! They're moist and chewy! Thanks for the recipe, i didn't change a thing!!"
"2","5","They are great as regular peanut butter cookies too."
"2","5","This recipe was absolutely spot-on. Decadent cookies with plenty of flavor on the inside. Probably could have rolled the dough balls in sugar before putting them into the pan to be baked, but even without it the cookies tasted delicious. Chocolate chips (or Hershey Kisses) can replace the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup to put at the end; they all give the cookie more pleasure for those who have sweet tooths."
"2","5","These cookies are very good, definitely rich, so you have to love peanut butter! I definitely recommend unwrapping the cups beforehand and sticking them in the freezer for a while. It will take too much time if you try to unwrap them after the cookies come out of the oven, and they go in the cookies much easier when frozen. I also found they needed to bake for a good 10 minutes before they were done. Lastly I recommend letting them cool for about 10 minutes before removing them from the pan. I tried to remove mine after about 5 minutes and it started to fall apart. I used a butterknife to guide them out and that worked well. Overall a rich delicious cookie that looks very nice. They would be great as a gift. Thanks!"
"2","5","Delicious and best of all, fool proof! Just follow it exactly and you cannot go wrong with this one! I made these to take to work and they didn't last very long at all. Seemed as if they vanished into thin air! Heed the advice of others to unwrap the peanut butter cups first and set them in the freezer for awhile. It makes them easier to press into the cookie base without them starting to melt."
"2","5","The cookies are rippin' good! The only alteration I made was to pop them back in the oven for 1-2 minutes after putting the PB cups in. That allowed the chocolate to melt slightly and incorporate the PB cups into the cookie a little bit. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!"
"2","5","WONDERFUL!!!!Imade these for a party and everyone asked for the recipe, Great job, my family loved them..its a keeper thanx"
"2","5","These disappear every time I make them! It really helps to put the unwrapped peanut butter cups in the freezer. Be sure to bake until just browned or the cookies will lose that soft and chewy texture."
"2","5","These are AMAZING. I just pulled out the first batch, oh my goodness. One of the best cookie recipes I've found in quite some time! Don't change anything on this recipe, it is perfect as is! I don't have a mini muffin tin so I just used a cookie sheet. They were brilliant!"
"2","5","I have made this recipe several times and brought them into work. They never last more than 5 minutes and if someone found out I brought them and they didn't get one, they are thoroughly disappointed. I have given the recipe away countless times. They also keep supremely well. I made a triple batch for my fiance and myself, and they were still good 2 weeks later! One tip: The easiest way to remove them from the pan is to wait 5 minutes after you put in the Reese's then gently twist the top. This will loosen the cookie and they come out beautifully. SUPERB RECIPE!"
"2","5","Amazing! I took these to a Christmas party and they were gone in no time and people were raving about them! I made some in the large muffin tins and some in the small ones. Both turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","4","Very moist peanut butter cookie w/o pb cup. (Used 1 Tbls measure). Need to make in mini muffin tin using 2 teaspoon measure."
"2","5","I made these like peanut blossoms (rolled in sugar and baked on cookie sheet), and they were very good."
"2","5","I was the HIT of the season! These cookies are the BEST!! I did freeze the candy before putting them in the hot cookies! I also put cute paper liners in the muffin pans. Thanks so much for this great receipe."
"2","5","Love these!! The perfect peanut butter lover cookie!"
"2","3","Not my favorite. I made them and they looked great but I don't know if I didn't cook them all the way or they were just a doughy type cookie. I took the left overs to some friends house and they ate them. If I were to attempt them to make them again I'll cook them a little longer."
"2","5","These cookies were GREAT!!! Everyone loved them! And they were easy to make. I thought they would stick to the pan but they came out easy. I took the advice to put the candy in the freezer and as soon as the cookies came out of the stove and I put the candy in right away. I also put them straight into the fridge until they cooled and the candy kept its shape."
"2","5","Oh my goodness, these might be my absolute favorite new cookie! They are incredibly easy. Definitely take the advice of other reviewers here and place the entire pan in the refrigerator after placing the cups into the cookie. I have a mini muffin pan that worked great for this recipe. I rolled the dough into smallish balls and dropped them in the tin. Amazing recipe!"
"2","4","I thought they were very good but SUPER rich! I baked the 2nd batch for only 6 minutes. 8 was too much the first time. Easy trick to get out of the pan, use a knife when they have cooled a bit and spin it around the cookies a few times and they will spiral right out."
"2","5","Made these today for an addition to my cookie baking and they are absolutely sinful. Can't wait for my friends to try them. Thanks so much for sharing."
"2","5","These are a new family favorite. I took them to a couple of Christmas cookie exchange parties and everyone wanted the recipe. They are very easy to make and I loved the tip to freeze the PB cups first this makes for a lot less mess. I also placed the cookies in the fridge once they were baked so the chocolate did not melt as much. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe."
"2","5","These Cookies are so incredibly tasty!!!!! Its absolutely impossible to find the right words for it... I made them for a party and everyone loved them. Steph's advice to freeze the Peanut Butter Cups before adding them in was a great idea by the way. I have another TIP: try the Mini Peanut Butter Cups whith the WHITE CHOCOLATE as well, it also tastes marvelous. 100% DELICIOUS A++++++++"
"2","3","I had a problem with the dough. I followed the recipe exactly and even retraced my steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. My dough was very sticky and would not roll into a ball no matter what I tried. It was just a gooey mess. I ended up just spooning dough into each muffin cup. The end result came out fine and the cookies taste very good. I just can't figure out what happened to the dough. Any suggestions by anyone as to what I may have done wrong would be greatly appreciated."
"2","5","This recipe was sooo good and soo easy! I used the mini muffin tins and greased and floured them before baking. Also took them out of the oven and put them straight into the freezer still in the tins for about 10 min. They popped right out and then I kept them chilled in the fridge. My hubby said they were the best cookies. :) And I have to say they looked so cute!"
"2","5","Yummy** Just like others, I used (hersheys kisses)because that's what I had on hand, I also put them in the freezer for a few minutes before putting them on the cookies. Making nice size balls I ended up getting 4 dozen all together! Great for gift tins =)"
"2","5","My family loved these cookies. I made one batch and they did not last. If you love peanut butter and chocolate these are little tastes of heaven. After reading the reviews, I tried these with out the mini muffin pan. It did not work out so well. Stick with the mini muffin pan."
"2","4","I made half a batch. I love peanut butter, so I substituted half the butter for more peanut butter and then added an additional 1 or 2 tablespoons PB. Also, instead of pressing PB cups into the cookies after baking, I wrapped the dough around Hershey Kisses and baked them that way. The chocolate is a nice little surprise when you bite into them! I liked the recipe and the dough was easy to handle, but next time I might try adding 1/4 cup more sugar for a half batch. Thanks for the recipe! I will make them with PB cups sometime as well."
"2","5","My 13 year old son made these and they are wonderful. We did not modify the recipe but should have made a double batch. They were gone in 24 hours! Wonderful and easy!"
"2","5","These cookies were very easy to make and tasted delicious. Be careful with the penut butter cups once you insert them, they stay melted for awhile."
"2","5","A favorite! Loved by all in my house! Will definately be made again. Very easy and quick. Tip: stick in fridge to cool faster so you can get them from the mini muffin pan. They fall apart if they are not cooled."
"2","5","These are delicious...we look forward to Christmas every year just to have them again :) Like others have shared, it's best to put the pans in the freezer/refrigerator after putting the peanut butter cup in the cookie to help the cup keep its shape. I've also learned you can use the sugar-free peanut butter cups and not tell the difference (I tried these just to avoid having to remove all the wrappers...the sugar-free cups aren't wrapped!)."
"2","5","Can you get any better then chocolate and peanut butter? Very easy and DELISH!"
"2","5","I thought these were just great and ridiculously easy to make. For the first batch, I used mini cupcake pans, but found the cookies didn't have enough room to spread when I pressed the peanut butter cups in. For the second batch, I still used the mini cupcake liners, but put placed them in a large muffin tin. This worked perfectly! I made half with Hershey's kisses and half with peanut butter cups and both were delicious. I also made a few with caramel cups, but this was a tad too sweet. These were also extremely portable and popular at a recent party. Thanks for a recipe I will definitely make again!"
"2","3","I really thought this one was 'in the bag' based on all the great reviews. However, I found the cookie base tasted rather salty and not very flavorful. Next time I will probably try a different peanut butter recipe. They sure are cute and fun to make. Definitely freeze Reeses cups, first. That worked out great."
"2","5","Very worthy of the 5 star ratings. Putting the chocolate in the freezer first I found was very helpful. Plus, I substituted the peanut butter cups for peanut butter kisses for a cheaper and more 'sentimental' cookie. Overall, very good, very easy to make cookies!"
"2","5","These are sooo good. I didn't change anything. It does help to put them in the freezer right away. Thanks!!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies turned out delicious!"
"2","5","Peanut butter cups are my favorite so I was excited to find this recipe and it didn't let me down! I didn't have mini muffin cups, so I rolled the dough in balls and placed on a regular cookie sheet and immediately put the cups in when I took the cookies out of the oven and it seemed to work just fine! I also froze the cups before hand as was suggested and that seemed to help. Super yummy!"
"2","4","Cookies were quite good, I will definitely make these again."
"2","5","This was a great desert!"
"2","5","Awesome cookies! So easy to make. Thanks for a cookie that's a little out of the ordinary :)"
"2","5","These are AWESOME!! My hubby is a huge PB and Chocolate fan and thought he was in Heaven!! Easy to make and the dough was great to work with. Came right out of the pans and stored perfectly....if only for 2 days!!! They went quick! A new favorite in our house...thanks for a great recipe. Oh, I followed others advice and froze the pb cups and that worked great!"
"2","5","Excellent! A family favorite."
"2","4","A big hit with the kids. This is great for school parties."
"2","4","I don't know what I was expecting. These were good, but I guess I was just thinking they would be out of this world, and they were really kind of regular, but tasty all the same."
"2","4","I thought these were just ok, but my husband, in-laws and kids loved them. May or may not make again."
"2","5","Came out perfect!! Used larger muffin tin & rolled dough larger...perfect! Highly recommend."
"2","5","I love these!! If you are a peanut butter lover then these cookies are sure to satisfy."
"2","5","These were super yummy and so easy. I made them no time flat. Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","These cookies are awesome. Everyone loves them and they are my sons favorite. I also make them as regular drop cookies stirring different chips into the batter. One of my kids favorites is stirring in a bag of the mini Hershey's Kisses (I think they're called kissables). Make the batter just like stated, stir in chips, drop by small cookie scoop onto cookie sheets and bake for 8-9 minutes. Yummy!!"
"2","5","Love the cookies. Made them for Christmas treats for neighbors. :)"
"2","5","I ended up making these a little bigger and putting them in regular muffin cups because I don't have a mini muffin pan. They turned out GREAT!!! Everyone loved them. It was like a peanut butter cup cupcake almost! Will definitely make again."
"2","5","Big hit! The whole family loved these. Very rich, but a nice treat."
"2","5","Very easy to make and very good. I think I will add less peanut butter next time."
"2","4","Good, my coworkers liked them. Thanks."
"2","5","Fantastic! Very rich and easy to make. My 5 yr old pretty much made them herself, they are that easy. Will be making these again!"
"2","5","My family and I really liked these, in fact they asked why I hadn't made them before, glad I found this recipe. Thanks."
"2","4","These were very good-followed the recipe exactly. I have made these before but with chocolate chip cookie dough-and surprisingly, I was told that the chocolate chip cookie was much better than the peanut butter. I will keep the recipe and make both next time. Thanks for sharing Nancy."
"2","4","Very easy to make. I omitted the peanut butter in the cookie part as i did not want an extreme peanut butter taste, turned out pretty good, but the middle part of the bottom of the cookie didnt cook completely"
"2","5","Excellent cookies. Everyone raved about these ones!!!"
"2","5","People go crazy when they see these things. Adding sprinkles give them a festive look and nice little crunch."
"2","5","Great recipe. Made it with my nephews and they were thrilled with their results. Will be a regular on my cookie list!"
"2","5","These were a perfect addition to my holiday baking. Both, my husband and daughter gobbled them up!!"
"2","4","this cookie tasted great but I found the batter to be slightly too moist. They spread out a little more than I would have liked in the oven making the cookie look a little odd looking. Perhaps I would cut down on the amount of milk next time so they are less moist. The peanut butter cups also melted quite a lot and lost their shape. I had to stick them in the refrigerator afterwards."
"2","5","Theese where a big hit at our christmas party. They were the first to go. They take a little work and I had a hard time getting them out of the pans. I put them in th freezer to cool them down faster and but the time the last bach came around I used none stick spray to help get the out. Next time I make them I am going to use the minni cup cake baking cups. All in all they were worth the work."
"2","5","There is nothing I didn't like about this cookie. It was a huge hit at my cookie exchange and they were so easy to make. These are my new favorite cookie! (I do recommend making them in the muffin tins - I think they come out a little better)"
"2","5","These were fabulous! Nice looking too, my son ate them up."
"2","4","I made these for Christmas. This is only the second time I've tried making cookies 'from scratch!' The dough was easy to mix and I had no trouble rolling balls at room temperature. I used normal-sized cupcake liners on a flat cookie sheet, and they worked great. I used Kisses instead of pb cups, and used holiday sprinkles on top and placed them back in the oven again for a few seconds, just enough to let the kisses get a little soft to hold the sprinkles. I wrapped them up individually with plastic baggies and ribbons and they looked very cute! They turned out very tasty, VERY peanut-buttery (I used JIF), but perhaps a little TOO sweet? The kisses might be to blame for most of the sweetness, though. They are very filling - can only eat one at a time. I'm always up for trying new recipes, so I may not make this one again for awhile, but it is one I will save in my files. :)"
"2","5","This were so quick and easy. My husband said, 'I feel bad saying this, but these are better than the ones your friend makes!' I accidentally left a few out that didn't make it into gift bags when we left for the holiday and after three days, they were still moist!"
"2","5","Got this recipe at a cookie swap - the batch didn't even last two days. My husband says they're his new favorite cookie!"
"2","5","I could eat the whole batch...."
"2","5","These are FABULOUS. They taste great. They are easy to make and they look so cute. Don't change a thing!"
"2","5","I actually put the peanut butter cup in before cooking. I use muffin tins and paper liners. I make an indentation in the center of the dough and push in the peanut butter cup in upright. I bake for about 12 minutes. As soon as they come out of the oven, I add sprinkles, chopped nuts, etc. I've done the same with kisses and rolos as well. Consistently good recipe. I've also cheated in a pinch and made these with store-bought dough. Still yummy!"
"2","5","These are my new favorite!! As a child, I looked forward to my grandma's peanut butter kiss cookies every Christmas. This year, I made them using hershey kisses instead of peanut butter cups, and I must say, they were so much better than Grandma's!! Thank you for the recipe, I love these! (So did the family and the coworkers!)"
"2","5","I love easy holiday cookies and this one is by far the easiest!!! I made 1/2 of these with pb cups and then 1/2 with mini-snickers (smaller than bite sized). They were a huge hit at cookie exchange. Thank you!"
"2","5","I made these for Christmas baskets and people were seaching through the basket looking for the second bag. They were so easy and everyone kept asking how I got the peanut butter inside!."
"2","5","Excellent cookies. I too did not have any mini muffin tins, but it worked fine just pressing it into the cookie, although i'm sure it would have been prettier in muffin shape."
"2","5","These are wonderful cookies. Extremely easy to make. I refridgerated the dough a little and it was very easy to work with. I didn't have any problem getting them out of the pan. I have a Wilton non-stick and they just came right out. I didn't even cool them for more than a few minutes. I did pop the peanut butter cups in the freezer for a few minutes as others suggested and that worked great. I put the sprinkles on and then put them back in the oven for about a minute to melt them into the chocolate better. Excellent cookies! Definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","Great recipe! This is a big hit, it has a great taste and looks great! I didn't change a thing."
"2","4","These were good.  I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I just rolled the balls and put them on a cookie sheet. Because of this, I couldn't put a mini PB cup inside of them, so I cut the PB cups in half and stuck half in the top of the cookie.  They still tasted good--they were the first thing gone at the party I brought them to.  I had to cook these longer than the recipe suggested."
"2","5","These were amazing! They were extremely easy! I did as other reviewers suggested and put the pb cups in the fridge for awhile, and they were easy to insert to the cookies. I then added holiday sprinkles and they were perfect and scrumptious!"
"2","5","These are super easy to make an amazingly delicious. Roll them just a bit smaller than the size of a golf ball and you'll get about 36 cookies. Yummy!"
"2","5","this recipe was wonderful! I made tins of 5 different types of cookies for christmas, and this by far was the most popular kind. it was super easy to make. i mixed it up by using white chocolate reeses cups with red and green sprinkles in order to give it that christmasy look. will definately make again!"
"2","4","Very good, familly loved these. I thought there could be a little more chocolate though and next time might try replacing peanut butter cups with kisses. Used mini muffin pan with paper cups to avoid having to wait for them to cool completely. Cups held the shape while cookie was still hot."
"2","5","Wonderful cookie!! I did spray the pan with oil, and i had no problem with them sticking. I also put the p.b cups in the freezer and it helped with the melting issue. I will make again very soon."
"2","5","Yummo Yummo Yummo. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I doubled the size of the cookie and made them in my regular size muffin pan and baked them for 11 min. I just quickly turned them upside down on the counter so I could quickly get them on the serving dish and get the mini reeses in the middle. Soooo good and soooo moist."
"2","5","These were fantastic! I baked them for a cookie exchange at my office and they turned out perfectly! My husband and I let the cookies cool for a few minutes then pressed the peanut butter cups in. We then removed them from the muffin pan and let them cool on a rack. The cookies were much easier to remove while they were still warm. We didn't have any problems with them breaking either!"
"2","5","OMG! Soooooo good! Hubby loved them! I would def. recommend spraying the muffin cups... it made removal simple."
"2","5","I love chocolate and peanut butter so I knew I'd like this recipe for sure. It tasted so good and they 'look' good. Great to display on a dessert table. I'll be putting these out for our Family Christmas Party. Very easy to make also. Next time I'll try putting the peanut butter cups in the fridge, but I didn't have a hard time doing it without."
"2","2","This recipe was way to sweet. If you dont use the paper muffin cups they will not come out of the pan easily. Baking time is also off, they need to be baked much longer than 8 minutes."
"2","5","I'm not the world's most experienced cook but these were EASY - I followed the recipe *exactly* and they came out perfect! My husband can't resist them and they were a hit at the office."
"2","5","Very yummy, super sweet and addicting. I must have made mine on the small size because I had 48 - I ran out of PB cups for the last 12, so I put the balls in the fridge and got another bag. I thought the dough looked like it needed more flour when I was done mixing, but they turned out great - still soft on day two!"
"2","5","I loved this recipe! I can cook anything, but am just getting into baking. This was perfect and simple. It would be a great recipe to have kids help you with. Thanks!"
"2","4","Followed recipe as written, just added some rainbow sprinkles on top for a little color. Big hit with the kids- just their size and very sweet My husband and I thought they were pretty good, but not our favorite cookie ever. Still, I will definitely make again for parties, picnics, etc. where there will be lots of kids. Very easy too!"
"2","5","These cookies are absolutely wonderful. I now have peanutbutter flowing in my veins. Thanks Nancy!"
"2","3","This recipe was good, but not exceptional. I found these cookies to be a little bland."
"2","5","My Aunt Nancy made these when I was kid, it is an awesome recipe! My kids love pushing the cups into the warm cookie dough. Watch out, once you pop one in your mouth it is hard to stop!"
"2","5","made this with a couple kids - they loved being able to help by pushing the pb cups in. LOVED this, as we love reese's in our house! such a good twist on the usual hershey's kiss idea!"
"2","5","These are wonderful! I didn't have a mini-muffin pan, so I used mini muffin/candy baking cups on top of a cookie sheet and they still came out perfect! Thanks"
"2","4","You definitley need to have the mini muffin tray or all you will have is a flattened cookie with a hershey kiss in the middle! I didn't follow direction and this came out a disaster! I'll try again next Christmas. I gave it 4 star's because of the flavor."
"2","5","Well I screwed things up at the start but made a good recovery. I didn't have a mini-muffin pan. So instead, I made larger rounds of dough, cooked them for 10 minutes on a cookie sheet, took them out of the oven, pushed a peanut butter cup deep into the cookie and then cooked them another 4 minutes. I let them cool on a rack for a while and then put them in the fridge to firm the chocolate. They were a big hit for Christmas."
"2","5","What a great cookie! And so easy to make. I doubled the recipe and took them to a cookie exchange. Had Christmas sprinkles on top for a very pretty presentation. Very popular at the exchange. Definite keeper."
"2","5","How exciting to rediscover this cookie! I hadn't had these since I was a little girl and had totally forgotten about them. They're SO good! This recipe tastes exactly as I remember. YUM!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! These little cookies look so pretty on a cookie tray. Great find; very easy to do and people seem to really like them. A nice addition to my Christmas cookie trays! Will make again often!"
"2","5","These are great! My husband was the guinea pig and he didn't want me to share any after tasting these cookies. My mom also loved them and asked for the recipe, something she never does!"
"2","5","I made this for the first time and they were so easy and so good. A definate new Christmas cookie for my family."
"2","5","This recipe is wonderful! I did add a bit more peanut butter and I used margarine instead of butter. I found that the baking time is right on. I only have 1 mini muffin pan so I put them in the freezer for a few minutes to cool quickly so I could remove them and bake the next dozen. One trick that I found worked to help remove them from the pan was to twist them gently back and forth to release the cups from the pan easier and then pulled them out (other wise they would split on me) Very easy to make and delicious! Will definitly make them again."
"2","5","Excellent! I've been looking for a recipe like this one! So Easy! If you don't have PB Cups use hershey kisses."
"2","5","Great recipe to make with the kids! Dad joined in, too! Too bad there weren't any left to give away! Put colored sprinkles on top to add holiday cheer! Thanks for an awesome cookie recipe!"
"2","5","Excellent! Soft and chewy--just be sure not to bake longer than 8 or 9 minutes."
"2","5","These are great & so easy!"
"2","5","Easy to make - and I didn't use muffin cups. They came right out of the tin nicely."
"2","5","These are always first to go wherever I take them! great recipe! once cooled I always drizzle them with some melted chocolate chips and then let them set again and they always look great.Kids love to help unwrap the pb cups too!"
"2","5","I have made these for church,and school parties, and they were a big hit. Instead of making the dough from scratch, i have been using the packaged peanut butter cookie mix that you just add egg and oil.It is so easy and fast. also i would definetely recommend putting into the freezer after putting on the reeses cups.keeps them from melting too much."
"2","4","These were great. I didn't have the mini peanut butter cups. I had the peanut butter cup bites which are much smaller and didn't give enough candy in the middle. I will make them again with the correct size."
"2","5","Thanks for such a great recipe, Nancy. Your recipe was enjoyed by soldiers in Iraq. I sent two boxes of cookies to my sister and fiance' who are serving there. Although the cookies were three weeks old by the time they got them, they both loved them as did their fellow soldiers. It really brightened their day. I didn't have any mini-muffin pans so I made them on cookie sheets."
"2","5","I have been making these cookies for years and they are always a huge hit! People always ask for the recipe."
"2","5","These are so good. My stepmother has made these for years and I look forward to going home to get them. Now I will make them at home. Thamks"
"2","5","These are so easy and EVERYONE loves them! Thank you for posting this recipe...I've been making them for Christmas for many years and have been asked for the recipe many times!"
"2","4","I made these for my sister-in-law for her cookie exchange. I didn't try them, but they apparently got rave reviews. My husband and kids loved them too."
"2","5","These are delicious. A definite keep."
"2","5","These were very good. They are a lot like peanut blossoms. I made them for my daughters classmates and they were a big hit."
"2","5","Tastes so great! My bf ate 10 at one sitting!"
"2","4","These were OK...too much candy for me."
"1","5","Great cookie. Made these twice, using the mini muffin pan and mini Reeses is perfect, didn't work out so great with a larger peanut butter cup. I cooled the Reeses in the refrigerator while the cookies were baking then popped them in the cookie, cooled in the pan, then on a rack, then back in the refrigerator. Was a little tricky getting out of the muffin pan, but once I loosened one spot with a toothpick down the side, they popped right out."
"1","5","Very straight forward and it turned out fantastically.  Subs: -Agave instead of the allotted brown sugar (1/4 cup because agave is very sweet) -Brown sugar instead of the white sugar portion -Coconut milk instead of dairy milk -Salted butter-- no salt added  As many others have stated, I would freeze the pb cups to help press it into the cookie and to help prevent it from melting too quickly.  I used a cookie sheet and just rolled them into balls that were 1 1/2 inch to 2 inches."
"1","5","I made 48 of these for a church bake sale. They were so easy to make. My only issue was 'my fault' I made these in the evening and it said to let them cool completely before taking them out of the trays. So I put them in the fridge over night. Goodness they were cemented into those darn little cups I had no Idea how I was going to save them. I was thinking, they have butter all I really need to do is warm up the bottom of the tray enough to melt the butter just enough to release them. I used my hair dryer. That's right I took my tray into the bathroom and blasted the bottom for about 1 minute on high heat and they popped right out. :)"
"1","5","A New All Time Favorite! We have added it to our Holiday Cookie Baskets."
"1","5","So good no problems"
"1","5","SO GOOD! People will beg you to bring these to functions along with the recipe to share. Definitely unwrap all of your PB cups so they are ready to press in to the cookie as soon as its out of the oven. Thanks!"
"1","5","I thought I had the correct Reese's cups bit instead I only had the Easter egg ones. They were too long so I cut them in half and put the two halves back to back in the cookie. It was so creamy and good! My husband and boys couldn't stop eating them!"
"1","5","I am a chocolate peanut butter fanatic. This is super easy and perfect to satisfy your sweet tooth. My peanut butter cookie-loving family made me photocopy the recipe for an anniversary party."
"1","5","My family wants me to make these for every occasion.i don't because I'm too tempted by them."
"1","5","Great recipe! My family of chocolate & peanut butter lovers wolfed these cookies down! I followed the suggestion of others and froze the peanut butter cups beforehand which helps them keep their shape inside the hot cookie."
"1","5","These were really good!!"
"1","5","Oh my….these are dangerously good!!! Wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe and it is easy and delicious. The whole family loved it. Their is no way you can mess up. It's easy peasy lemon squeezy"
"1","5","I've lost track of how many times I have made this recipe! So good. One time I used crunchy peanut butter because that's all I had, but I do not recommend it."
"1","1","i followed recipe shortened it to 25 cookies instead went to pull them out of tray and they were not cooked all the way bery disappointed"
"1","5","Excellent!!!"
"1","5","These cookies are easy and absolutely delicious."
"1","5","Not much more that I can add to the reviews as they are all great! As far as tweaking the recipes goes, I followed what the top reviews suggested and they came out fabulous. I did cook them in mini muffin liners as I found my first batch hard to remove from muffin pan without them. This is now my go-to cookie to bring to parties, events, etc. I definitely DO NOT like to keep these in the house as they are so hard to resist! I normally eat very healthfully and am able to resist most desserts and treats but not these!!!"
"1","5","Great recipe! It's been in my family for a long time! We do a couple of different things: after shaping the dough into a ball, roll each ball in sugar, then place on a cookie sheet and bake. When you remove them from the oven, press either a Hershey's Kiss or Reese's mini peanut butter cup into the center. They're actually better with the kisses because the flavors compliment each other. Yum!"
"1","5","So I cheated a bit, but still came out amazing! I used pre-made sugar cookie mix (kind in a bag where you just add butter and egg) and followed the cut sugar cookies recipe adding a TBS of flour, then just added the 1/2 cup peanut butter to that! Followed this recipe with all else! De-Lish!"
"1","5","Very simple to make. Who doesn't love a cookie with Reece's? Crowd pleaser for sure."
"1","5","These are so good!! I made them as part of our Xmas cookies."
"1","3","After all the 5 star reviews my expectations were high ... but this recipe makes only an ok cookie - it lacks depth of flavor. Perhaps adding more peanut butter, vanilla and salt to the cookie would punch it up a notch? Also, I am a bigger fan of dark chocolate than of milk chocolate - I would've enjoyed the stronger taste of a dark chocolate peanut butter cup in the middle. (if those even exist?)"
"1","5","simple recipe that never lets me down. The kids love helping with these."
"1","5","Incredibly easy to make and super delicious!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious. I only got 25 cookies out of the batch though. But was yummy to the last crumb."
"1","5","One word..... AMAZING!!!!!! Made them last year and this year I have to make double because they are soooo popular. DELISH!!!!"
"1","5","This recipe was awesome. Like others I unwrapped and froze the peanut butter cups first and it worked great. This was a good recipe for me and my daughter to try!"
"1","5","Made a double batch of this for a work luncheon everyone loved it! Not to sweet just right."
"1","5","These are delicious! My family loves them and my daughter loves poking the candies in. This time I didn't have enough peanut butter cups so I added other Christmas chocolates I had. So now I have peppermint, caramel and peanut butter. They are all yummy yummy yummy."
"1","4","I didn't actually get to try one of these cookies after I had made them. I baked them for christmas cookie gift boxes for friends. Everyone who did try them said they were excellent! The three I had set aside for myself were snatched off the counter by my shameless dog. He seemed to enjoy them as well."
"1","5","I had no problems my cookies turned out great and tasted delicious !!!!"
"1","4","Hello. I followed the amount of ingredients given by the recipe. I didn't have miniature muffin tin so use a regular size one and made my cookies a bit bigger. I bought a small bag of miniature reeses in the candy aisle and there is 26 of them in 1 small bag. I did freeze my chocolate first. Also, before working with the dough, I made a log of the dough and wrapped in 'glad cling wrap' and put it in the freezer for about 15 mins. Then, I evenly cut the log into slices and rolled it into balls. If you skip this step, the dough is too gooey and hard to work with. I used a conventional oven and cooked them 9 to 10 mins instead of the 8 mins."
"1","5","We doubled the batch, because we knew without even trying them that they would be a 5 star. I made these specifically for my dad who loves peanut butter cookies, and loves peanut butter cups. So he is just going be thrilled to get these! It's really the best of both worlds. We made them at night while he was sleeping and hoping that he wouldn't smell the wonderful aromas :) We were lucky to be able to clean up the kitchen, so he wouldn't suspect anything going on. Of course we did have to sample a few, just to make sure... he will LOVE them."
"1","5","This is the second time I've made these and there awesome, turned out great!"
"1","5","After mixing the batter I put it into the refrigerator to cool. Makes it easier to form the balls!"
"1","5","Delicious!!!"
"1","5","Did mine on a cookie sheet..spread like a regular cookie..freaked out but followed the rest of the directions..actually came out awesome even though the shape was wrong..everyone raved out them. Great recipe!"
"1","2","The dough tasted WAY to flour-y for me. Dry and not sweet & peanut buttery at all. I'm thinking it was designed that way as to not make the cookie taste super sweet with the addition of the PB cup. I made one batch and threw away the remaining batter. I'm going to try the process again with a better pb cookie recipe."
"1","4","Great cookie! I followed the recipe almost exact, but added a few extra tablespoons of peanut butter. Will definately make these again, also ngoni get to try and make a gluten free version for my son"
"1","5","I liked this recipe. I used the extra miniature sized Reese butter cups. (The ones with no wrapper) Made smaller balls of the dough. This made for a nicer 'cookie size ' in my opinion.  Freeze nicely! Will keep recipe ;)"
"1","5","Outstanding just as the recipe was written! Would definitely make again."
"1","5","Even though this doesn't need any more 5 star reviews, I thought I would add my helpful hints from many years of baking these. After mixing the dough, I divide the dough into 4. I have 4 mini muffin tins and I roll the dough into balls with my hands to fill up all the muffin tins. It didn't make any sense to me to have a partially filled muffin tin in the oven and making 40 cookies seemed to make them too big."
"1","5","Definitely remove from oven at eight minutes! Chocolate melted quite a bit so be prepared for that as well. Otherwise they turned out fantastic!"
"1","5","These are amazing! Quick question, do these freeze well?"
"1","5","It definatly sounds and is good! It basically combines the flavor of Resees and sugar cookies!"
"1","5","Easy & delicious!"
"1","5","Followed the directions perfectly and they turned out amazing. I do suggest cooking the cookie i"
"1","5","An easy and delicious recipe. Worth adding to your holiday baking!"
"1","5","I LOVED this recipe! I actually had to go out and buy the mini muffin pan but it was well worth it. I used the ides of putting them in the freezer to cool them down after I inserted the reese cups. This made it much easier to remove from the pan."
"1","5","Perfection!"
"1","5","Do you realize this is the HIGHEST RATED cookie on allrecipes.com ??!!! And deservingly so! Delicious, most perfect combination for a cookie!!"
"1","5","First time making these. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great... Simple and very tasty. The kids and my mom loved them... Will be adding this to my yearly Christmas cookie list. Thank you so much..."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I did follow some other reviews ideas and took the wrappers off the peanut butter cups and freezed them while I made the cookies. I cooked my cookies in a mini muffin pan for the 8 minutes placed the cups in while hot . I put them in the freezer to cool for about 15 min. Yummy! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","Love it ...everyone loves these cookies."
"1","5","Everyone loves these cookies ?? #1. put the candy in the freezer for at least 1 hour.  #2. I ran out of reeses so I used leftover Halloween candy; snicker, butterfinger, etc. The snicker was my favorite."
"1","5","This recipe is awesome!! They came out perfect and did not last long in our house haha. Even my son loved them!! Will definitely make again very soon :)"
"1","5","Used smallest Pampered Chef's scoop, rolled the dough in to balls (they turn out prettier) and put in a mini muffin pan. On my second batch, I followed other's advice to freeze the cups first and to refrigerate the pan immediately after adding the cups (the cups melted in the first batch). Great recipe!"
"1","5","Easy, and very delicious. Have friends around because these are very dangerous to have to eat on your own."
"1","5","Delicious, easy, perfect! I used a tablespoon of batter per slot in a regular sized muffin tin, baked about 15 minutes, watching closely. They're amazing, already needing to make another batch!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Someone mentioned using a regular muffin pan. That doesn't work, you have to use a mini pan."
"1","5","Simple and tasty. I took them to 3 events and there were none to take home."
"1","4","I LOVE IT N SO DOES MY FAMILY !!! A VERY GREAT RECIPE!!!! DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOOD TO DO WITH THE KIDS AND NIECES!!!!!!"
"1","5","Super!"
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly except that I used a cookie sheet instead of a muffin pan. I live in a high elevation and 8 minutes was perfect. Worked out just fine and the taste wonderful!"
"1","4","I scaled the recipe back because I didn't need 40 cookies. These came out good at baking 8mins. I used cupcake wrappers because I didn't have a mini muffin pan. After chilling the dough(1 hr) before baking i flattened the top before placing in the oven. I will suggest for the dough, only use about the size of a munchkin donut if using mini peanut butter cups without a mini muffin pan. The chocolate pieces were so small I had to use three to a regular size cupcake holder. If you are making these without a mini muffin pan you're better off using the regular size peanut butter cup as far as presentation. I will try again because the flavor has room for improvement. needs more peanut butter taste."
"1","5","If you love peanut butter, you'll love these cookies.  I only had crunchy peanut butter which was even better for me because I like the extra crunch when I bite into it. My sister always makes these but it was the 1st for me & you can't mess up on this easy recipe. The only other thing different I did was leave it in oven for about 12-13 mins."
"1","5","These were perfect! So yummy. I followed the recipe exactly. The recipe didn't quite make 40 cookies, but maybe I just made mine too big? I second the suggestion to freeze the peanut butter cups before use."
"1","5","Awesome awsome awsome ... Was my first time I made peanut butter cookies ... now my husband wants me to make them all the time ... They didn't look cooked after 8 min but they were perfect ... Thank you :0)"
"1","5","Loved it"
"1","5","Great and so easy! I followed another reviewer's advice and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while the cookies were backing."
"1","5","These cookies were AMAZING!!!!! I made this while everyone was gone except for my brother and by the time they got home more than a third was gone. The only thing was that it was slightly thick so I suggest a glass of milk, but these are delicious so..... make them they are to die for"
"1","5","The perfect cookie! I followed the recipe but used a baking sheet. They came out great."
"1","5","This was very good! I didnt have fresh blueberries so I used blueberry pie filling and it was sooo good ! definitely a favorite in our house!"
"1","5","I made these cookies in my Culinary Arts class and they loved it. Its sweet and chewy if directions are followed. If you want something small light and tasty TRY THIS you won't regret it."
"1","5","Always a first choice when served. Soooo good."
"1","5","This recipe was great! I ended up baking them on a cookie sheet and they turned out really well, but I think since I did that the recipe only yielded 30 cookies. Also, I live at a higher altitude so I used a little over 2 cups of flour because of that and it was perfect."
"1","5","Loved these cookies and the turned out PERFECT! I followed the recipe exactly and did not change a thing!"
"1","4","I made these today for a neighborhood party and they all were eaten by the end. The only thing I would change is next time I'll use hershey kisses instead of the butter cup minis. They got 'lost' in the peanut butter cookie (flavor wise) - but overall very good recipe,"
"1","4","These were great. I used chunky peanut butter to add a nutty flavor and it was awesome. Although, the cookies didn't sink in the middle which is what the video made it look like it was still easy to press the cups into it. It's a great recipe and I'll definitely use it again. :)"
"1","5","I made these yesterday for a cookie contest and won first prize! Thanks for the great recipe. I used a previous hint and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer plus lots of spray Pam on each batch. It helped to remove them out of the muffin tins."
"1","5","I just made these, they were a great hit with the hubby and kids!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!"
"1","5","followed the recipe and it turned out great! loved them"
"1","5","asome"
"1","5","I'm glad that I tried one of these before I put them out for our family and guests. They were gobbled up before I had a chance to try a 2nd one. Delicious!"
"1","5","Loved these cookies. perfect mix of peanut butter and chocolate. Total hit"
"1","5","I used to make these many years ago and I must have misplaced my recipe. So happy I found the recipe on here! I just made them and this recipe rocks!!! The recipe is simple and quickly comes together. The cookie is delicious! These won't last!"
"1","5","Very good"
"1","5","Love this recipe. The dough is very easy to work with. I rolled into balls and then decided to flatten slightly, then I used a heart-shaped cookie cutter. I was very pleased with how well the cookie held it's shape. I then simply dipped the bottoms in melted chocolate..yummy!!!"
"1","4","I agree with the advice of freezing the peanut butter cups but with my experience with this recipe I would recommend using non stick spray in the pan because my cookies stuck in the pan. Also... do not push down the cookie dough leave it in a ball it will only make it harder to get out when there done."
"1","5","I love this recipe! I took the time to read all the tips left by others and found this to be an easy, fun recipe. I didn't have problems with the cookies cracking and the tips about refrigerating the peanut butter cups was spot on! I used a tablespoon to scoop the dough and like others, I didn't roll into balls, but just placed it into the mini cupcake pan as is. It made 42 cookies. I used milk chocolate peanut butter cups, white chocolate peanut butter cups and some dark chocolate peanut butter cups. I can't wait to see what my Mother's bingo group thinks of them!"
"1","3","Easy to make. I found them cloyingly sweet, but I have to admit that others who tried the batch I made loved them."
"1","5","Tastes amazing, super easy to make."
"1","5","Made two minor changes so a friend with peanut allergy could try these: Sunflower butter and Hershey's Kisses."
"1","5","Made these for my sister because she absolutely loves chocolate and peanut butter!! She couldn't keep her hands off them!!"
"1","5","Delicious! My family couldn't stop eating them and we all had a great time baking them!"
"1","5","Great cookies! I made as written and yielded 32 cookies out of the batch using my small pampered chef scoop. I used disposable mini foil baking cups on a cookie sheet and froze the peanut butter cups for a bit. I swapped rolos for pb cups in a few of the cookies per one sons' request. Santa will be quite pleased with these tonight!"
"1","5","These are awesome. I add extra peanut butter for a stronger pb taste and I roll my balls in sugar to make them prettier & a little sweeter. So good!"
"1","5","AWESOME and EASY! I used the Betty Crocker Pb cookie mix and it made about 32 1' pb cookie cups. Just roll the dough into 1' balls and put in the mini muffin cups. No need to press dough or anything. I also didn't grease the muffin tin. I froze the unwrapped pb cups ahead of time, then after the cookie cups cool a few min's I just press them into the middle. Then, stick the muffin tin into the fridge and let them completely cool (till the pb cup hardens again). Then use a small spatula to lift out. No problem with sticking for me! Love these!!!!"
"1","5","addicting and excellent flavor. Used crunchy Jiff pb and really had a great peanut butter flavor. I used my size small pampered chef cookie scoop to place them in the muffin tins and it made 50 cups. I ran out of the pb cups so filled the remaining with a Hershey's hug. Topped each with a whole peanut after the candy had melted some. They all taste wonderful. Presentation is perfect."
"1","5","AWESOME! By far the best tips are to refrigerate the dough - in ball form makes it so easy to pop them in the pan then in the oven, and to keep the peanut butter cups unwrapped in the freezer. And take them out exactly at 8 minutes for the perfect amount of chewiness."
"1","1","Since this recipe uncommonly calls for mini-muffin pans, at the very end of the recipe, it would help if you called them MUFFINS instead of cookies."
"1","5","I made these for a pot luck at my work, everyone loved loved loved them. A friend asked me if I could show him how to make them so I invited him over the next weekend and we made these little pieces of heaven. We have been dating ever since. My mom always said a way to mans heart is through his tummy! If you haven't made this, try them, they will make you happy!"
"1","5","I made these this afternoon and they are delicious! I used Jif creamy peanut butter. I don't have a mini-muffin pan so I used the regular size muffin pan I have which made 12 cookies. I sprayed it with Pam no-stick spray. I took the advice of another review and froze the peanut butter cups for about an hour before using them. I also let the cookies cool completely before removing them from the pan. Will be sending these with my husband to his office tomorrow!"
"1","5","I loved it very easy to make and my coworkers loved"
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly. Very easy and very delicious. I may have over baked them as they were a little crumbly, but that is my own fault."
"1","4","Used the Reeses Mini's that come unwrapped in a bag. They worked great."
"1","5","Followed the recipe as is plus used the tip to freeze the PB cups ahead of time. It was easy to do and the results looked good and tasted delicious! (And I only bake once a year at Xmas ;)"
"1","5","Awesome!! Made as written...following suggestions to chill the dough and freeze the peanut butter cups....got 48 very delicious cookies...a keeper...thank you!!"
"1","5","The kids loved this one!! Super easy too!"
"1","5","I love this recipe."
"1","4","This is an excellent cookie...peanut butter cookie paired with candy-how can you NOT like it? Unfortunately, 8 minutes was not long enough and of course I didn't notice until I tried one after the batch was done. And you can't cook it longer once your peanut butter cup is in it or else you'll have a mess. Next time I'll try 9 or 10 minutes to avoid that bit of raw cookie dough. Still tastes great."
"1","5","I really had fun making these and they were really good but VERY sweet! They look so neat when they're done and the cookies turned out perfect. I think next time I will try it with chunky peanut butter"
"1","5","These were a hit in my family. I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I know I'm going to be making these again before Christmas since they ate so many last night! I got 48 cookies from the recipe. I think it depends on how big your mini muffin pan is."
"1","5","Made this a little diffently than the directions. Baked them on a cookie sheet so it took about 14 minutes to bake. Same concept as the hersheys pb kiss cookies. The reeses melted into an icing and they look fantastic. Will repeat again next holiday season. 5 stars thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This cookie is the best!!!! Everyone who has tried them in my family has loved them!!!! The peanut butter is well per portioned. It was not too peanut-buttery. A MUST make recipe!!!"
"1","5","Best. Cookies. Ever."
"1","3","The actual cookie part of this recipe isn't very good. I've made peanut butter blossoms (the ones with the hershey kiss instead of the reeses) where the cookie was much better. The dough is also very sticky and so rolling it into balls is trickier than normal. Sadly, I'm disappointed."
"1","5","I did not use a muffin pan though, just pressed then in like kisses into cookies"
"1","5","Loved it. The recipe is perfect. the mini muffin tin is a must for the perfect cookie. Definitely freeze the unwrapped peanut butter cup before smashing it into the warm cookie. Definitely refridgerate the cookie while it's still in the pan to allow the the chocolate to harden again so you don't make a mess. I used 1 Tbs (leveled) of dough for each muffin holder. This recipe made 3 dozen exactly."
"1","4","This recipe was very good. Dough was sticky so I didn't roll it into balls, just dropped spoonful into mini muffin tins and baked. Worked really well and time saver to not have to roll them or chill the dough. Also, used some Peanut Butter Cups and some mini Rolos. These are excellent! My only recommendation is that next time I make them I will cut the sugar in the dough in half (husband said they were a bit too sweet!) - less sweetness in dough but made up for by the PB Cup or Rolo!"
"1","5","I made these today! They turned out great! I listened to some of the other reviews and put the Reese's pbutter cups in the freezer for about an hour (give or take). I also put the cookie dough in the fridge for about an hour before forming it into balls. One more suggestion that I found helpful was to put the cookies in the freezer for a few minutes after putting the pbutter cups in the middle. This definitely made it so the chocolate didn't melt too much! They are SUPER TASTY!!! I'll be making these again very soon!"
"1","5","I made these cookies for my husband as he LOVES anything peanut butter and/or reese cups. They are delicious but very rich! After eating one a nice ice cold glass of milk tops it off so yummy! Happy Birthday Hunny! He loves them and I enjoy them as well!"
"1","5","Loved these cookies!They were easy to make and tasted great. In fact after my son-in-law tasted them he told me I should open a cookie store."
"1","5","Excellent and so much fun to make! Here's what I did:  1) Used Skippy peanut butter 2) Froze the peanut butter cups overnight 3) Refrigerated the dough for an hour before using 4) Rolled the cookies into balls and placed them into a mini muffin tin 5) Baked per the recipe time 6) Pressed frozen PB cups into the middles and put tray in freezer on top of a towel for about 15 minutes 7) Took them out of freezer and put on a plate 8) Turned around - plate was empty  Here's what I'll do better next time:  1) Bake when no one else is around"
"1","5","I followed the directions piece by piece. I did use regular muffin pans instead of the mini pans and they came out great! I always wanted to try a different cookie.Thanx for the recipe."
"1","5","delicious!! turned out just like the picture too!"
"1","5","These are my favorite!"
"1","5","The only thing I did differently was added a bit of Almond Extra (on top of the vanilla) and froze the Mini Peanut Butter Cups... SO AMAZING!!!"
"1","5","Made them today. Froze the peanut butter cups overnight. Recipe was easy, and turned out great!!"
"1","3","I found that this recipe didn't have enough flavour so I purchased some Peanut Butter LorAnn oil from The Cake Decorating Company and it gave this recipe a nice boost."
"1","5","This recipe deserves 5 stars and more. The only thing that needs to be added to it, is what size balls to form. I doubled the recipe and used a melon ball scoop and got 107 cookies. to get the balls to form without being sticky do refridge the dough for about 1 hour and then keep it in the fridge in-between pans. I used a cookie sheet (got 24 per pan) and they did flatten a little but still looked cute. I did put each pan in the freezer after placing the reese's peanut butter cup in them for about 15 min. so I could place them in baggies for storage. I used the Reese's minis unwrapped mini cups. FYI there were 60 cups per bag. DO Not over bake. for the size of balls I made 8 mins was great. All the people at the coffee shop loved them and I didn't have any left over. thanks for a great and cute recipe."
"1","5","I've made these twice for my church and they absolutely love them. I'm in good with the choir now and the pastor is a fan of them. Although I've made 3 dozen of these bad boys. I've only had half of one."
"1","5","These cookies taste really good. I should have refrigerated the PB cups before pressing them in, they melted some after pressing in. I put the 2nd batch in the fridge after pressing in and they were more presentable. Live and learn....."
"1","5","Looks ymmmmy"
"1","5","I have made this recipe several times, and my family and friends always say I should've made more. This recipe will stay a permanent fixture in the recipe box."
"1","5","They were so good! Loved the idea of putting them in a mini muffin tin. I used the mini cupcake papers which made for a nice presentation. I made them twice within a week and they were a big hit! I used sun butter and most people didn't even know. Although the green middle gave it away on some of the cookies! I didn't know that sun butter can turn green when baked... oh well, it won't hurt you or the taste! (could be a good thing for St. Patrick's Day!)"
"1","5","Delicious!!! My family can't eat them fast enough. It is a definite keeper. :)"
"1","5","Oh my god, I ate 1/4 of the dough (If you're into eating that…and not pregnant… this is goooooood dough!!), 1/4 of the cookies, and sent the other half to my boyfriend and every single one was devoured. SO GOOD"
"1","5","I just finished making these cookies (as well as just finished eating a few) and I am SO happy that I decided to make them! They are basically fail-proof and they are AMAZING!  A few tips: -Freeze the peanut butter cups before-hand. This way they will be easier to press into the cookies. -When they say only cook for 8 minutes THEY MEAN IT! They don't really look done, but they are! -Use a knife to loosen the cookies around the edge when taking them out... it makes it SO easy!  Overall this recipe is just fantastic! I can see these cookies being gone SOON! Try it!"
"1","4","These are really good and always get compliments. But I doubled the recipe today and only got 58 cookies total. If I'd made them any smaller, there wouldn't have been enough cookie to balance the PB cup. I can't imagine trying to get 80 cookies out of a double recipe--they'd be tiny. Perhaps because they were bigger than the OP's, I baked mine for about 10 or 10 and a half minutes."
"1","5","excellent! Do not over mix or over bake. 8 mins exact!"
"1","5","This is one cookie recipe to keep; easy to make; 2400 plus votes at 5 pts, means excellent A plus plus"
"1","5","AMAZING!!! Just made these last night and everyone loved them! One definite thing you should do is freeze the reese's peanutbutter cups, it helps them not melt as fast :] these are definitely going to be 'my go to' dessert for events and occasions"
"1","5","so cute and gone in a minute/ a bit expensive to make"
"1","5","Our 12 year old daughter made these and she had soooo much fun baking them! They are excellent! She followed the recipe as written."
"1","5","Always a hit at Christmas."
"1","5","Great. I found the dough easier to work with after chilling it in the reefer for about 45 min. I also gently twisted the cookies from side to side in order to free them from the pan. My three cookie experts gave these an enthusiastic 'thumbs up'. I'll definetly be making more of these."
"1","5","Delicious! I make it all the time now! Easy and quick!"
"1","5","I just made these again for my Easter buffet. They're so easy and taste great. I followed the recipe exactly, and got 34 beautiful cookies. After they cooled, and I removed them from the muffin tin, I placed them in colorful mini muffin cups. They're gonna be great at part of my buffet!"
"1","5","Salty and sweet, these were excellent"
"1","5","Glad I finaly found a peanut butter cookie recipe that was soft on the inside,but still held together. Perfect combination peanut butter cups and a soft cookie. My sons tried to remove from pan early -- very messy (but taste gtreat warm) wait until they cool completely for a nice looking cookie."
"1","5","Everybody loves these cookies! I've made them before, but this time I decided to make them for my boyfriend for valentines day. I ended up by reeses heart-shaped peanutbutter cups and pressing those into the cookies. They came out so cute! I definitely suggest putting your cookies in the fridge/freezer before taking them out of the pan so the chocolate doesn't melt all over. Doing this also helped keep the shape of the heart in the cookie :)"
"1","5","I've made these a million times. THey are the quick go to dessert for any function. I always use paper liners to avoid clean up and refrigerate the recese after peeling and before putting into the cookies so I don't leave a thumb print!"
"1","5","Perfect; followed the directions except for switching some of the all-purpose flour to whole wheat (1 c whole wheat & 3/4 c all purpose) May try substituting the regular flour entirely with whole wheat next time. Very helpful hint to freeze the peanut butter cups first... they turned out perfect from the very first batch. My family has a new favourite cookie."
"1","5","I made these for a card party at my sister's, everyone loved them. I was worried about not having enough (given some of the other reviews) so I had a backup plan -- no need, the cookies were a BIG hit. My batch turned out 58 cookies using a mini muffin pan, bite sized cookies. Yummy!"
"1","5","I usually make about 5-6 different kinds of cookies to give to friends and family for Christmas. Each year I will add a new cookie. Well, this cookie was THE hit this year. Everybody wanted the recipe. Scored me lots of points with my hubby who LOVES just regular pb cookies...but this just kicked it up a notch with the pb cup in the center. Only changes: I froze the pb cups like suggested and used a regular cupcake pan with petite cupcake liners...PERFECT. Thanks:-)"
"1","5","This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly & it has been a huge hit with my kids, my sitter, my son's classmates... everyone! I also packaged these cookies & shipped them to my deployed fiance & he said they were awesome even after traveling half way around the world."
"1","5","can use store bought refridgerated cookie dough. I do this with chocolate chip cookie dough every year for Santa! makes it really easy for the boys to 'help'."
"1","5","Great recipe. Easy to make and everyone loved them. Like other reviews mentioned you need to freeze the peanut butter cups. It's much easier pushing the candy into the hot cookie dough and alot less messy."
"1","5","This was a great recipe. Very easy to make and a hit at my cookie swap. The peanut butter cookie is great as is too."
"1","5","I made this recipe and it was a hit with everyone. I bought the huge bag of Reese's mini and there was a variety of flavors in the package. There was White Chocolate, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate, it added some color to them. I will definitely make them more often, everyone has asked me for the recipe!!!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe approximately 5 times already using the instructions exactly as written, and taking the advice of other reviewers by freezing the peanut butter cups. It is foolproof, turns out great every time. I purchase the leftover holiday peanut butter cups on clearance and freeze until ready to use."
"1","5","Made these twice in a week! They were amazing, and super easy to make."
"1","5","All I can say is...MMMMHHHH! MMMMMHHHH!MMMMMMMMMHHHHHHH! BABY! These are devine. My 15 year old health concious son (who is not big on sweets) BEGGED me to make these again tonight. And he was right, they are devine! Get the smallest Reeses cups, the unwrapped minis. Makes for a delicious cookie and makes your cookies even easier to make."
"1","5","OMG these were delicious! It's hard to stop at just one!"
"1","5","Super moist and delicious - very rich. Definitely a crowd pleaser. Worker out well after I realized I needed to put 1 tbsp into ea. mini-muffin cup."
"1","5","Oh these are SO GOOD!!! I was tempted to leave them longer than 8 mins but read other reviews saying not to do that! And they are right! The 8 mins is right on! And I also like to have the peanut butter cups frozen or kept in the fridge to put them in the balls! That is a great tip! I'm thinking this is a new family favorite!!"
"1","5","These cookies are amazing. Seriously stop-close-your-eyes-savor-the-bite amazing. I made these in a regular muffin tin, and a bit larger in size, but they still turned out well. My oven cooks hot so after 5 1/2 mins they were done and one batch even browned a bit on the bottom, but still delicious."
"1","5","These were great. I didn't have a mini muffin pan so I just put them on a cookie sheet and they turned out fine. We used these as part of our Holiday cookies and everyone loved them so much better than using Hershey kisses."
"1","5","Fantastic! These worked out beautifully, and I am a little kitchen-challenged. I will definitely be adding these to my repertoire. I did freeze the chocolate cups first, which worked well. I think the hardest part was taking off the wrappers. I wasn't sure how much dough to use per cookie so I made some with more and some with less, and they were all good no matter what. ENJOY!"
"1","4","Same cookie recipe I use for my peanut blossoms. I didn't realize until I had made most of them that to have a better cookie to candy ratio you need to use a larger amount than you'd think (almost filling the mini muffin cup. They got too brown & did not look like the picture - the candy was still sticking out on top. I used my second largest scoop for the remaining cookies & that worked much better. However, using the larger scoop it makes a lot less cookies than the recipe says."
"1","5","These were great! As per other reviews I did put the cups in the freezer prior to harden them a bit and cooked the cookies EXACTLY 8 minutes, then added the cups and they were PERFECT and GONE! Only thing I would maybe consider changing next time is maybe using the smaller 'mini' baby cups because for me reeses are a bit much but I love the flavor. Great recipe and thank you for sharing!"
"1","5","I have made these for several years. Ingredients are the same but I use muffin papers in the mini muffin cups, then when the chocolate has begun melting, I drop sprinkles on top. Use red, green and white for Christmas."
"1","3","Thought the cookie was a bit dry...good enough flavor, but expected it to be tastier. Fun for kids to help with."
"1","5","This recipe is great. I have made it several times. I do make the dough and let it chill. I also freeze the peanut butter cups. Everytime I make these they get gone quick!!!"
"1","5","Amazing recipe! So easy to make and the cookies were a big hit with everyone."
"1","4","I have made these several times and always came out perfect. I have a shorter version that is just as easy:  1 bag of Mini Reese Peanut Butter Cups 2 Large Eggs ¼ Cup Water ¼ Cup Oil 1 box yellow cake mix 1 Cup Peanut Butter Mix all ingredients until well blended. Drop into lightly greased mini muffin pans (or use mini paper liner cups). Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Push mini Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup into center of cupcake as soon as they come out of the oven. Let sit for 5 minutes or so, then move to flat surface to cool completely. less to measure, same great quality"
"1","5","I actually made a mistake and used a regular sized muffin tin and so had to cook them for longer, but in the end, they just ended up larger and fewer of them but oh my god, they were sooo good! Will make again following the recipe so there are more of them!"
"1","5","These never last long after you make them. Best cookie recipe I have found"
"1","5","This receipe is so versitile. I have used hersey kisses, different colour chocolate rounds, plain chocolate with sprinkles, chocolate covered caramels and they all work.Some advice - freeze or serve them right away. They are best day of next day, but after that they get stale quickly.Also, i took them out of the oven a minute or two ealier than in the recipe and it kept the sides from cracking."
"1","5","I cheated and used refridgerated pilsbury peanut butter cookie dough. I also used dark chocolate Reese's cups. Followed the suggestions to freeze the cups and refridgerated after coming out of oven... But first batch fell apart when removed from pan. The tasted GREAT though. So for the next batch I cooked for 9minutes and they were just right! Maybe because I didn't use the recipe dough it took a bit longer to cook. Will certainly make again!"
"1","5","I've made this recipe before, and I know that it's in-cred-u-licious.  For those who don't have the time to make the peanut butter cookie dough, you can also use the rolls of PB cookie dough in the refrigerated section, i.e., Pillsbury. It's much easier to cut the rolls of dough if they are still partially frozen and you use a good knife.  Also, I mean no disrespect, but who EVER has any Reese's PB cups left from their kids' Halloween goodies??? If the kids don't gobble them, you know that the parents do!  Thanks for posting such a great recipe."
"1","5","awesome cookies!!! great hit at home. i did put the cups in the fridge before putting them in the cookies it worked they kept their shape. i will make them again. thanks for the recipe"
"1","4","was a little too dry but very tasty"
"1","5","Super yum! Made with white whole wheat flour and it turned out great. I did freeze previously unwrapped pb cups to aid in their placement."
"1","5","If I make them for home snacks,or take them anywhere for surprise treats, they fly off the platter. It seems I can never make enough!!"
"1","5","these cookies were great! a peanut butter cookie with a peanut butter cup in the middle. how could it get any better than that?!!"
"1","5","Okay...learn from my mistake, be sure to have nice sized balls. Do not make them so small that the peanut butter cookie can't hold the candy cup. I baked two batches and the first one turned out not so good, the cookie was over cooked and the cup was too big for the cookie. I lowered the heat down to 350, created bigger cookie balls and it turned out awesome. Next time I make this, I might roll the balls in granulated sugar (what I do with my blossoms) because it never fails for the taste of the cookie. Giving the nice batch to a family in need and my co-workers. The not pretty batch will stay home and the kids will be thrilled."
"1","5","I am in love! This recipe is so easy. I love that I can make the dough ahead of time, then just make up the cookies whenever we want fresh, hot cookies. I made half of them as described, but the other half, I took a shot glass, made an indentation in the cookie, then added a spoonful of Nutella! OMG! I liked those best. Yum!"
"1","5","People are so excited to try these when they see them. Very good for impressing crowds! :3 And they are sooo tasty.  I messed up my first batch and made them too small because the recipe doesn't say how big the balls should be and I can't roll all the balls at once. #_# The answer is just a little bit smaller than a ping pong ball. I made them in mini muffin paper cups to make them cuter and then I did find a way to roll all the balls at once by setting the cups out individually on a table and switching them out when a batch is finished baking. I followed someone's tip to freeze the peanut butter cups to make it easier to press them in. Anyway, everything went perfectly once I figured out how big to make my cookie dough blobs and the muffin cup thing."
"1","5","Delicious! Helps to let the cookie cool a bit before removing it from the pan (few minutes). I changed it up by buying a pack of mini peanut butter cups covered in milk, dark, or white chocolate which makes them look even better!"
"1","5","These are easy and so good! Quick recipe: Pick up a roll of Pillsbury Peanut butter cookie dough. Cut 10 slices (about 1/2 inch slice); quarter each slice; in an ungreased tart pan- stand-up each 1/4 round (triangle) in each tart cup or form into ball; bake 375 degress for about 8 minutes; remove from oven; quickly press an unwrapped peanut butter cup in each tart cup. Cool before removing cup. If you don't have a non-stick mini-muffin pan, lightly grease and dust with sugar for easy removal."
"1","5","Easy tasty cookie"
"1","4","Super easy and yummy!! Had little trouble getting them out of the muffin tin but was able to press back together and turn out great"
"1","5","Really easy to make, and turn out amazing!"
"1","5","delishish"
"1","5","came out great!!"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious and super easy!!!! I especially love them with Reese's cups Dark!!!!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe! I love how it tastes and how easy it is to make! Thank you for this awesome recipe :)"
"1","5","Good cookies even though the taste was predictable. I made several cookies with a regular muffin cup and it turned out pretty good also., I may make all in the regular size the next time."
"1","4","I must have made them too big because they flattened out and looked more like Reeses in the middle of a Peanut Butter Cookie. They were quite yummy though and they were one of the first items gone at the event I made them for. They were a little crunchy for my taste, but overall very good."
"1","4","Recipe could probably benefit from a smidge more salt but not a bad recipe! Thanks"
"1","5","Tried this recipe a couple of days ago and my family loved it. Followed the directions exactly as they are and the cookies turned out as delicious as they look!!"
"1","3","This was my first time to make the cookie from scratch. Now I know, I prefer the break and bake type peanut butter store bought dough. My co-worker and I both (accidentally) brought these to a party and hers (using store bought cookie dough) were better. These are dry to me and I prefer chewy. Not bad, but not at all worth the extra trouble."
"1","5","Came out perfect! no altering of the receipe. They went fast. Even people who don't usually eat peanut butter cookies said that they liked them! I didn't have the mini's so I quartered a regular peanut butter cup. freezing the candy or cooling the cookies in the refrigerator prevented melting."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! I made there as holiday gifts and my husband is always my biggest critic and LOVED them. He has requested these every year from now on :) the only advice i can give, is that the mini muffin pans are VERY important! I did use a regular size muffin pan and just kept the dogh balls the same size, they turned out fine, but cooked a little quicker and the shape wasn't as cute :) Also, The lighted (and maybe older style muffin pan, as I used one of them) for some reason took longer than the 8 miniutes.. not sure why... I will definitely make these again! thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","LOVE these cookies. They were great to make with my 3 year old old. Took them to work and people are asking me to make more."
"1","5","Just finished making these and they are yummy. I used mini muffin liners, making it a breeze to take out. Also, unwrapped candies and placed in a bowl in the freezer, made it easy to insert into the cookies. Thanks for posting! :o)"
"1","2","I was so excited to try this recipe, but it was way too sticky to make into balls, so I just spooned the batter into the cups. Also, couldn't get them out when done baking because they would fall all apart. I ended up cooling them 'in pan' in the fridge to get them out whole!"
"1","4","These were super easy to make..had my 4 year old daughter help me. But I must've read the directions wrong? I pressed the PB cup into the cookie, and tried removing them from the pan about 15-20 minutes later without putting them in the refrigerator...wrong idea!! I had three of them 'come apart', I now have them in the fridge and they are cooling beautifully..hope I can get the rest out safely :)"
"1","5","simple to make. Yummy!"
"1","5","I followed some recommendations I read in other reviews. Freezing the peanut butter cups ahead of time was helpful because they didn't completely melt or loose their shape when I mated them with the cookies. I baked the cookies in a mini muffin tin and used a melon baller to form the cookies into a cup before baking. I had no cracking issues, just some trouble getting them out of the tins. I used a spoon to dig them out. I've already passed on the recipe to friends!"
"1","4","Followed recipe exactly, turned out really well!"
"1","5","I love these cookies, they are soooo cute and delicious!"
"1","5","YUMMMY! Don't cook to long, less and 8 minutes. let cool for a couple minutes before pressing cups in! So tasty!"
"1","5","These are super simple to make, but taste amazing!"
"1","5","so easy to make. I doubled the recipe and ended up with 75 cookies!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Very easy to make. I followed the advice from other reviews and froze the peanut butter cups while preparing the dough, which made it easy to push them into the dough.  I will definitely make them again!"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe to a t. I also let the cookies settle before inserting the pbc and refrigerated them afterwards to keep them from melting."
"1","5","Oh my! Make sure you have a tall glass of milk ready."
"1","5","Super easy to make and very delicious. These will be a welcomed addition to my Christmas tray. Thanks for posting."
"1","5","LOVE these! So easy to make and so good. It's the same dough you use for the peanut butter cookies with the hershey's kiss pressed in the middle. Definitely stick the peanut butter cups in the freezer for a little bit and have them all unwrapped before you put the dough in the oven. They add a nice variety to your Christmas cookie plate!"
"1","5","This recipe is perfect and easy just the way it is. I didn't change a thing, and everything was perfect. Thank you for sharing, these are perfect for the Christmas Cookie Exchange I will be attending next week."
"1","5","i have another version of this recipe that i make quite often, and the dough doesn't crack. instead of using mini peanut butter cups i use chocolate chips. about 3 or 4 in the center after they come out of the oven works good. i'm sure the peanut butter cups are good, but the chocolate chips are good too."
"1","4","Great cookies......do not overlook. I did and they are a little dry. Still very good."
"1","5","Easy & delicious. Great recipe."
"1","5","best i've ever made"
"1","5","First time I baked these cookies. Took them to work and they were gone in minutes. Very one said they loved them. Will definitely make these cookies again."
"1","5","Everyone I have made these for loves them (as well as myself), and are very easy!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe to make with children. Easy to make, we had majority of the ingredients in the house."
"1","5","I chilled the peanut butter cups so I could push them in easier and that helped, but otherwise I followed the exact recipe and it was wonderful! Very popular treats!"
"1","5","I LOVE this recipe!!!!!"
"1","5","amazing cookies!! wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","5","Excellent! Did freeze the peanut butter cups....Super easy. A real hit, have already made them twice!"
"1","5","I have never liked peanut butter cookies, but my husband does and asked me if I'd make him some. I made this recipe exactly as it was originally posted except I didn't have mini peanut butter cups and I flattened each ball of dough with a fork before cooking. They came out perfect and so soft. I found myself keep going back for more I was very surprised how good they were, I guess I do like peanut butter cookies after all, at least just these."
"1","3","Just a heads up--get more than one mini-muffin pan. I unfortunately only had one on hand, and was planning to make these for an event. it took way too long to make them with only one pan, so I had to abandon it and just buy cookies from the store to make it to the event on time! Just a heads up, then--purchase several mini muffin pans if you want the recipe to take the time it suggests."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious!! Don't change a thing."
"1","5","They were just slightly more cake-like than normal peanut butter cookies. Almost peanut butter cupcakes! Still delicious!"
"1","4","great cookies. they look great too. a little too much peanut butter for my taste but still very good =)"
"1","5","Great flavor. I did not make into balls but used a rounded teaspoon for each and scooped it out with another spoon. The timing is perfect. I refrigerated the peanut butter cups and pressed them in immediately after removing from the oven and let them melt a little then placed in the fridge to cool. They taste great! Thanks for a big hit!"
"1","5","Absolutely*´¨) ¸.·´¸.·*´¨) ¸.·*¨) (¸.·´ (¸.·´ * Awesome!"
"1","5","Great recipe, turned out great, I might make them in muffin tins next time so they don't lay out."
"1","5","These are delicious! It was best when eaten right away so the chocolate center was nice and gooey. I made an oops that I wanted to share. I filled the muffin pan full before cooking.... Although the cookie tasted wonderful, they rose out of the pan and almost formed a cookie cake lol. Not sure what I was thinking!"
"1","5","Too die for. We LOVED them. Our only complaint was there didn't seem to be enough in one batch. So I bought another mini-muffin pan and plan on making double."
"1","5","Perfect exactly as written using frozen cups!"
"1","4","An excellent cookie!! I made these last night to add to my cookie basket I am sending to my little sister, who is stationed in South Korea. They turned out great! The only thing I did was put the cookies into the freezer for about 10 minutes after putting the PB Cup in, so they didnt totally melt and lose their shape!!"
"1","5","This recipe is easy and very tasty. Great to make with kids! As others have noted freeze the unwrapped peanut butter cups first. Another tip, invest in a small 'ice cream' scoop. It makes it easier (& less messy) to make the cookie balls. I then end up with 48. (scoop also comes in handy for mini muffins and other cookies!)"
"1","5","Super sweet but soooo good! I rolled mine in tablespoon sized balls and baked per the instructions. I did spray the pan before just in case of sticking. Definitely a keeper and went over well at a cookie exchange."
"1","5","These are my favorite cookies of all time. And this is the best recipe. Very easy. But these cookies should come with a warning label: WARNING: If you eat one of these cookies, you will have to eat two or three or four!"
"1","5","This is on the top of my list of favorite cookies. I make several times a year and its one of the cookies I exchange at christmas."
"1","5","Wow Yummy! Easy to make, Had to bake a little longer in my oven. I had 2 different size muffin pans one took 10 mins, another took 12 mins. I thought they were going to be a nightmare removing from pans, but was no problems. DELICIOUS"
"1","5","My friend made these for me. She followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out phenomenal. The only thing she did differently was to use the mini parchment muffin cups so they were very easy to remove from the pan."
"1","5","The cookies were delicious..... i loved the part when you bit into the cookie and you would go to the middle and eat the recess cup!!! they didn't bake long as i thought it would....But they were YUMMMY! :D"
"1","5","These were some good cookies i love the chocolate in the middle they were so good and delightful i like this recipe this one god be the best so far to me. LOVED THEM TRY THEM!!!"
"1","5","These were delicious! I used hershy kisses instead of peanut butter cups. I did not get anywhere near 40 cookies though, they would have been tiny. Took out of the oven at 8 min and they were perfect."
"1","5","My boys love chocolate. My son especially likes peanut butter. So, one of his favorite cookies now. I also froze the peanut butter cups prior to using. Prior to baking cookie portion, I used to pb cup to push down middle of cookie so there was an indent to put pb cup in when cookie came out. Good recipe."
"1","5","Timing was perfect! Sooo yummy!! I just rolled them in to little balls and baked on a cookie sheet then pressed in mini rolos because the grocery store didn't have the peanut butter cups. Perfect for my baking exchange!!"
"1","5","I would recommend putting a little grease in the mini muffin pans. I'm having a hard time getting some out."
"1","5","Delicious! Everyone loved these cookie-muffins. I will definitely be making these again."
"1","5","Awesome! Read the advice of others and froze the PB cups, and let the cookies sit for 8 min after they came out of the oven so they wouldn't crack. It worked perfectly. Everyone loved them! Next time, a double batch! Thanks for sharing, so easy to make and now my favorite cookie!"
"1","5","Just tasted the first one and WOW!! These are really good! Followed the recipe exactly as directed. My only problem (if you really want to call it a problem) was that I bought a small bag of peanut butter cup candies and I think I made the balls of dough a little on the smaller side, so I had extra cookie dough and not enough PB cup candies. Next time I will by a bigger bag of candies! Probably could've substituted the PB candies with Hershey's kisses too! I might try that next time around, Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Wow. I could NOT stop eating these and they never seemed to get old. yum"
"1","5","Yummy! I used to make the classic pb cookie with a hershey kiss in the middle....not anymore. Love this recipe!!!"
"1","4","These are okay to me. I'm not big on peanut butter but my son did enjoy them. I did have to cook them longer than the recipe requested."
"1","5","I found these cookies very easy to make, and I am enjoying them, I hopefully will have some to share by the time I am done 'tasting' them ; ) I do recommend ensuring that you make the balls large enough to leave a small lip of 'cookie' above the mini muffin tins, after the mini peanut butter cups are pressed in, this allows much easier removal."
"1","5","Made these as written. They are terrific! Easy especially if you can get your young one to unwrap the candy for you. These are our favs!"
"1","5","As delicious as they sound!"
"1","5","These are wonderful. Very popular at my house, I do not change a think aside form sometimes I use the white chocolate pb cups."
"1","5","Easy to make, and everyone enjoyed them."
"1","5","I made these last night, and they were pretty simple and very tasty. My husband had busted into the mini peanut butter cups I had bought and I don't have a mini muffin pan, so I had to improvise a little bit. I made 32 balls and put them on a large cookie sheet, baked them for 10 min and put a frozen peanut butter cup right in the middle. Worked great!"
"1","4","I didn't have a mini muffin tin handy, so i just made these into little balls and put them on a baking sheet. They spread out a bit, but i was still able to put the peanut butter cup in. Everyone I served these to really enjoyed them, but I wasn't crazy about them. A little to oily and peanut buttery. You can really only eat one or two."
"1","5","Yummy, I couldn't find any mini PB cups in my local (small town) grocery store, so instead used 2 'reese bites' in each cookie. My kids love these!"
"1","5","These cookies are AMAZING! i baked them for a bake sale and everyone loved them! my husband called me and had me email him the recipe bc somebody wanted to make them."
"1","5","These are more than delicious & so easy to make! I have not had the pleasure of making them using mini peanut butter cups yet as there is none available (yet) where I live so I made them using macaroons & mini Rolo pieces & they were perfect! 5 stars!!"
"1","3","I followed what one reviewer said and took them out even though they didnt look done (at about 9-10 min). Well, they were undercooked. I guess I will try and make them again and leave them in longer. They look yummy.."
"1","5","I made these last christmas, and they were a hit! I am hosting a bake sale this weekend, and I am making them for this event...they are so yummy!!I would chill the reeses cups a bit before pressing them into the cookies....works great!!"
"1","5","I made these for my cousin because he LOVES peanut butter cups. I had to make him his own batch because his kids started stealing his!"
"1","5","I used both chocolate peanut butter cups and the white chocolate ones, and I thought the white chocolate ones tatsted a lot better."
"1","5","EXCELLENT! perfect perfect perfect! Tasted amazing, everyone loved them! Chilling the batter before balling makes it easier and cold Reese cups work best! i used regular muffin tins and about 1' sized balls.. more cookie looking! SO EASY!"
"1","5","These are the best cookies I have ever made. So easy and so yummy!!!"
"1","5","delish and easy to make. I recommend openning peanut butter cups from their foil wrappers while cookies are baking. You have to put them into the cookies when they're straight out of the oven and still soft...otherwise you'll be scrambling! Will make these again! --and they're GREAT with a glass of cold milk!"
"1","5","I have made these a couple times and they got rave reviews from my friends and family. Very yummy!"
"1","5","So delicious. I made them as part of my dad's 'Cookie of the month' Christmas gift and even my peanut-butter 'hating' husband loved them!"
"1","5","LOVE these cookies!! I took them to a party and they were a hit! I followed other suggestions and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer before putting them in the cookies. I also put the pan of cookies in the fridge before taking them out of the pan to help cool them faster. Fantastic recipe!"
"1","5","TERRIBLY GOOD! What's not to like about a soft, slightly chewy peanut butter cookie stuffed with a Reese P-Nut butter cup. I cut my peanut butter cups in half; I find that with all the richness, half a peanut cup is just as good."
"1","5","loved them! didn't read everyone's tips on freezing the pb cups prior to putting on the cookie. i'm going to try it next time. yummmy!"
"1","5","These were a HUGE hit at the office! Very easy to make, very easy to transport and they presented nicely too."
"1","5","I just made these and followed the recipe exactly - refrigerating the peanut butter cups. They are amazing and the kids helped make them. Easy, quick, crowd pleaser cookie. I will make them again and again"
"1","5","Very good cookies. This one is one I will make again and again. Be careful not to overbake...despie appearences, the cookies are done and ready for a peanut butter cup afetr 8 minutes in the oven."
"1","5","Y-U-M-M-Y!!!"
"1","5","These were so yummy! You do have to freeze the peanut butter cups though before putting them on the cookie. Thank you!"
"1","5","These are even better than plain peanut butter cups. (If that is possible.) I froze candy like others suggested and this worked well. These also keep really well in the freezer."
"1","5","Outstanding!!!"
"1","5","followed the recipe exactly and they came out moist and wonderful...well that's what everyone else said, I myself don't like peanut butter."
"1","5","these cookies were AMAZING! i took them to a Christmas party and i had people coming up to me asking if i have any extras they can take home. i did not make them in the cup cake mold because i did not have one and out that it was quite expensive. if u plan on making them often it is an investment. you can buy a good pan for about $10 at target. i just pressed the peanut butter cups onto the cookies and the melting chocolate looked beautiful."
"1","5","This might be the best cookie ever. It seems way too simple but no one can stop eating them! I froze the peanut butter cups ahead of time but didn't put the cookies into the freezer at all. I thought that this warmed the chocolate just enough to almost melt and be soft but they still held their shape and didn't run. Oh and I used an ungreased mini muffin pan with no liners and the cookies came out perfectly before they were even all the way cooled. I will be making these again - soon!"
"1","5","I am addicted to these! Yum!"
"1","5","These are yummy and pretty easy to make! Recommend using mini baking cups to remove from pan easier."
"1","5","Followed recipe exactly. Came out like perfect pb cups! Remind me of one I had at the Toll House shop years ago. Great recipe to include the kids in on too!"
"1","5","Very good. Froze my peanut butter cups prior to putting in cookie, per other reviews worked great."
"1","5","Amazing!! I freeze the peanut butter cups, as some other reviews recommended, but I stick to the recipe. My husband can't get enough of these things!"
"1","5","I have known these to be called Peanut Butter Blossoms. If you want to do like me...just buy the already made roll of peanut butter dough, roll in sugar balls and drop in mini muffin cups...bake, cool and pop a reeces cup in. YUM! Sugar cookies and hershy kisses work gr8 as well."
"1","5","These were so easy to make! The ingredients were items I had on hand and it went together quickly and didn't use many pans/bowls, so clean up was a breeze too. The cups were nice and gooey, which was a wonderful taste. These disappeared just as quickly too. lol!"
"1","5","This is a winner at our house! I have made 2 batches so far and they never last long enough! I don't have a mini muffin pan but I did use the mini muffin cups and they turn out just fine."
"1","5","These are the yummiest! Can get a bit expensive when purchasing the peanut butter cups but they are a great treat! My daughter even made them the next day to take to Easter dinner at her boyfriend's house. They were well received!"
"1","5","awesome"
"1","5","These are the best cookies in the whole-wide-world!"
"1","5","I made these to take over to my cousins. The first batch, I left on top of the counter to cool. By the time I had returned There were 4 left. I made a second batch and while it was cooling, my friends came over and found the cookies cooling on the counter. These little treats are HARD to keep around. I found Mini Butter cups and used them to make mini cookies in little muffin pans."
"1","5","Love it, the cookie part isn't too sweet. I actually put mini eggs in for a cute Easter treat."
"1","5","yum! love this recipe! it's one of my favorite cookies right now. they're always a big hit when i bring them to a party. i did make a few changes, though. i baked mine at 350 degrees for 8 minutes and they came out perfect! i also used mini muffin tin liners (easier cleanup and to transport), although not using them works well, too."
"1","5","Easy and Delicious, bit hit with everyone"
"1","5","If you love peanut butter cups, you will LOVE these cookies. (They're really just a peanut butter cup with a crust.) I make these all the time, follow the recipe exactly, and always enjoy the end results. And so do the people I share them with!"
"1","5","These are a Christmas time fave. Def freeze the cups until ready to unwrap and then put them in the fridge/freezer right after pushing the cups in to stop the melting. I have made these in mini muffin tin with and without the paper baking cups and also on a regular pan. They come out awesome no matter what!"
"1","5","Soft and yummy. Perfect :)"
"1","5","AMAZING! I didn't change the recipe whatsoever. The only advice I followed was to put them in the freezer after they're cooked, otherwise eating them gets a bit messy!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except that I made them on a cookie sheet as I don't own a mini muffin pan. They came out great and I brought them to a potluck at work were they were snapped up quickly. Everyone loved them"
"1","5","My family was skeptical about these. They love the Peanut Butter Blossom's so they were disappointed when I said I was making these. However after they had one, they loved it. These do not taste good warm, you have to wait to enjoy when they are completely cooled."
"1","5","This peanut butter cookie recipe is as good as it gets! I made them without the chocolate covered peanut butter cups and I think they are so good they don't even need these cups!"
"1","5","These were a huge hit at our house for Christmas this year. Very easy to make and you can't go wrong with Reeses."
"1","5","EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic. I made them for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day (also his birthday) and he kept going back for more :D. Thank you!"
"1","5","These were amazing cookies! Didn't last long at all at my house."
"1","5","I made these around Halloween time and added some ghost sprinkles on the chocolate, they turned out very cute. They tasted good as well but it wasn't anything special."
"1","5","There were none of these left at the party I took them two. They do truly only take 8-9 minutes. They may not look like they are done but they are definitely not a cookie that you want to over due. They were soft and chewy...perfection!!"
"1","5","These cookies are amazing! Work loved em, friends loved em, so did my family. I am going to make them every chriistmas from now on. make sure ur PB cups are good and frozen b4 you put them in the cookie, then just let them sit in the fridge or on the counter to set. awesome"
"1","5","AMAZING! That is all I have to say about these! Just follow the recipe and you will get delicious, addicting cookies enjoyed by all!"
"1","5","These were awesome! I love peanut butter and chocolate together. Mine got a little too done on the bottom (dark pan) so next time I will take them out a minute or two earlier. Delicious!"
"1","5","I bring these guys out last. Otherwise everybody devours them withing minutes, before touching any of the other desserts! A plus for peanut butter lovers!! Nummers!!!!"
"1","5","I made these this past Sunday and the family and neighbor loved them. Freezing the candies did help a lot. And the only thing that I would add to the recipe is what size to make the balls. I made them about the size of a large marble. Smaller than a golf ball. I plan on making some with white chocolate reeses and dipping the bottoms in some chocolate as well, just to add a variation."
"1","5","You can't go wrong with these. Perfect flavor combination and lots or peanut butter goodness."
"1","5","great cookies. It is just hard to stop at one! I didnt change anything about the recipe and they came out great"
"1","5","Made these as written (used a stick of margarine instead of butter, and used egg whites instead of a beaten egg). Forgot to set the timer but thankfully I remembered and pulled them out before they had all overcooked - a few of the smaller ones got pretty well done but are still great, just not as soft. I refrigerated the dough for an hour before handling - it is very soft and sticky!! I made 35 cookies out of this recipe (but some are pretty large). I refrigerated the Reeses while the dough chilled and the cookies baked and pushed them in about 60 seconds after I pulled the cookies out of the oven. It's been a couple hours and they are still soft and gooey - I'm sure they'll firm back up overnight. They are so tasty warm and fresh!! The gooey Reeses is yummy! (My son called them Reeses cupcakes). Wouldn't change anything! :)"
"1","5","i make these every year, they have always been my favorite!"
"1","5","Wonderful! Took them out after exactly 8 minutes and they stayed soft and chewy for the whole week. I do suggest letting warm cookies sit in fridge for a few minutes after you add the reeces cup, or else the candy will melt."
"1","5","these are a FAVORITE in our house! but i will say i use a cup of peanut butter instead of half cup........we love peanut butter!"
"1","5","Easy and oh, so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!"
"1","5","OMG!"
"1","5","These turned out great and looked so cute!"
"1","5","So yummy and so easy!"
"1","5","My husband's co-worker gave him a mixed tin of cookies at Christmas. These were in there and were by far the best cookies of the bunch. I found this recipe so I could make my own. Her's ended up being better (less peanut-buttery). I asked him to get the recipe from her. It turned out to be the same recipe, but she happened to run out of peanut-butter so she had used less. I think it's even better if you half the peanut butter. Also the cooking time on this recipe falls a little short. Add a couple of extra minutes. Overall a GREAT cookie!"
"1","5","These are my favorite cookies during the holidays! I make them every year for cookie gift giving!"
"1","5","Awesome!!! I put the peanut butter cups in the freezer prior to baking the cookies, then when the cookies were baked I pressed the frozen peanut butter cups into the cookies and they turned out great!"
"1","4","I made 1/2 the recipe just to try it out. I followed the recipe exactly except that I ended up using 1 cup of PB for the 1/2 recipe and they were AWESOME. I think that in order to have a pronounced PB taste you need to increase the amount! But everyone thought these were really good!"
"1","5","Family enjoyed. Made for Christmas it was a different kind of cookie but well liked by the family. 12/2009"
"1","5","These are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I unwrapped the cups and put them in the freezer for 30 min. Bake these for exactly 8 min even if they don't look done. I am not a huge fan of PB Cups but this recipe seems to tone them down a bit. Everyone loved these and I was asked for this recipe several times."
"1","5","Loved these - they are always a hit! Using these exact amounts of ingredients, I was only able to make about 30 cookies - just FYI!"
"1","5","These cookies were a hit at Christmas! They will go down on my list for 'must make' holiday cookies. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
"1","5","i baked these for christmas gifts. i followed the recipe exactly and they came out great! i might make another batch just to keep for myself!"
"1","5","WOW, these were a huge hit at work. I added some Xmas sprinkles. Wonderful!"
"1","5","These are soo good and I am not a big peanut butter fan! I have made these twice, first time perfect, dough very manageable, rolled into balls very nicely. Second time I apparantly mixed it to long and very sticky. NO FEAR! I just dropped about teaspoon sized globs into lil muffin pan and they turned out wonderfully. My hubby took some to work for lunch, well not JUST lunch, and the dudes he worked with wanted recipe, and that was the 'sticky' batch. Thanks for an awsome cookie recipe!!"
"1","5","YUM!! I tried one of these cookies fresh out of the oven and thought they could not get any better than they were at that moment, but I was wrong! Even after sitting overnight they were still full of flavor (not to mention super easy to make)! I have made several batches in the last two months and plan to make several more in the future."
"1","5","Amazing!"
"1","5","EXCELLENT recipe. They are easy to make and I didn't have to change a thing. I unwrapped the candies and froze them for easier handling as suggested by another reviewer."
"1","5","Delicious and very cute. You have to work fast to get those peanut butter cups in so make sure you unwrap them ahead of time. And once they're in don't push on them or the chocolate will start to ooze."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly & they were a HUGE hit & very easy to make too. I'll definitely be making these again!!"
"1","5","Added these to my Christmas cookie baking this year. They were a hit with everyone. I plan to make these again for a New Years Eve get together."
"1","5","These were so good that my mom got the recipe from me so she could make them too! I took the advice from someone else to freeze the peanut butter cups before inserting them into the cookies and it worked like a charm! The kids had a lot of fun helping me make these."
"1","5","Easy to make these and everyone loved!"
"1","4","I used a piping bag to fill the centers of these cookies with a chocolate truffle frosting, instead of using the peanut butter cups since I did not want the peanut butter flavor to be quite so dominant. I had to wait for them to cool completely so they could be removed from the tins first. These were a great success."
"1","5","This recipe could really get one in trouble with counting calories. Having said that, they were very good. Usually I make a standard soft peanut butter cookie, but thought I'd try something new this year. I will make them again as they were super simple! I made them in my pampered chef mini muffin pans and had NO trouble getting the cups out with only my fingers. All cookies were in tact. I favor soft cookies and was really happy to taste that even after a few days, the cookies kept a firm softness about them (They did not become crispy, crunchy or hard). Will definately make again. Probably will bake a double batch next Christmas because they were received so well. I ended up with about 4 1/2 dozen, as I used a small cookie scoop to scoop out the dough."
"1","5","Not only do these cookies look really appetizing, but they are delicious! I gave my boyfriend this recipe as his first baking adventure and he had a lot of fun with them. They were also REALLY simple! He's already wanting to bake more! I would also recommend freezing the peanut butter cups. It just makes it easier to get the cups in just right, cause they start melting instantly. They do take a long time to cool down and get completely solidified, so make sure to give yourself plenty of time for cooling as we were in a rush and they got sloppy."
"1","5","These things are dangerous because you just want to keep eating them they are so good. Hersey Kisses also taste great in these cookies! The tip to freeze the peanut butter cups was such a good idea. I have another tip for everyone. I used the disposable foil muffin pans to bake these and then right after they came out of the oven I put the PB cup in the cookies and then put the muffin tin of them in the freezer for about 10 mins. The foil muffin tin and the freezer makes it super easy to get the cookies out, putting them in the freezer makes them firm up quicker then you just bend the foil on the bottom and the cookies pop right up."
"1","5","I didn't have the mini-muffin pans so I used cookie sheets. I formed them in 35 balls as that was how many peanut butter cups came in the package that I had. I pushed the peanut butter cups into the balls prior to cooking. After taking them out of the oven, I placed a half of a maraschino cherry into the melted chocolate top of the pb cup of each cookie. They not only looked nice and Christmasy, but they tasted great as well."
"1","5","Don't even bother making a single batch. So good. Additional tips (I haven't read every review, so this may have already been written): let cookies cool to warm in pan, then freeze about 10 minutes or till set, then place muffin tin cups in a shallow sinkful of hot water for 8-10 seconds. Twist gently, and they should come out beautifully."
"1","5","Excellent!!"
"1","5","My sister and I made these for the first time yesterday and they are sooo good! We used both Reeses cups and Caramel filled Hershey kisses to mix it up a bit, To add some decor to it before cooking we rolled the dough in colored sugar..."
"1","4","I made these today and found them rather time consuming, especially if you don't have several mini cupcake tins. I took another reviewer's suggestion of using about 2 teaspoons of dough for each cookie...worked out great. Next time I will use the miniture cupcake liners as I found them a little hard to get out of the pans. Not my favorite cookie but is very impressive when serving..."
"1","5","These were great! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly. I chilled the peanut butter cups which prevented them from melting too much. Delicious!"
"1","5","These were FANTASTIC. I doubled the recipe since I needed a lot and it made about 70 cookies. They were a huge hit."
"1","5","We just love these cookies! They are a staple for any cookie occasion in my family. Peanut butter cookie+peanut butter cup=heaven! :)"
"1","4","Even though I am not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies I had to give these a try after reading all the reviews. They look stunning, a nice addition to my xmas baking. I have to say I am still not crazy about them but its just a personal preference thing. They are unique though."
"1","5","I didn't change a thing and they are Great!"
"1","4","These are excellent cookies and very easy to make. I used the tip from other reviews and froze my peanut butter cups and then unwrapped them and put them in the cookie once they came out of the oven and then put the pan in the fridge immediately and let them cool. They came out perfect!"
"1","5","I haven't eaten these yet, but I'm sure they can't be bad! I didn't have a mini muffin pan either, but I used a cookie sheet, rolled into smaller sized balls, froze the p.b. cups and cut them in half (to yield more) and make cute little cookies! They look excellent! I hope I can resist before xmas!"
"1","5","Made them 3 days before christmas almost did not have any left for christmas, my 12 year old and husband loved these cookies, they were very easy to make, i used regular muffin pans for mine and they turned out just fine."
"1","5","Wow great recipe...worried a bit about how well they would pop out of the pan, but they came out easily! Only change I made was the dough seemed a bit sticky so added a tad bit more flour. Beautiful cookie thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! Easy to make and even easier to eat! Only thing I did was put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while I was making the cookies which was suggested in the other reviews. It definitely kept them from crumbling because you have to press on them firmly to sink them into the baked cookie and they will fall apart otherwise."
"1","5","Wow is all i can say to describe this!!! I followed this exactly with no variation and it was amazing!!!"
"1","5","Really Good!!! You need to make them. I am making them for christmas eve. I am sure everybody will love them!"
"1","5","These were delicious after I got the size of dough ball correct. The 1st round I made a small 3/4 inch cookie ball. The cookie was way too small and dried out. The next round I made about a 1 1/4 inch ball and that was just right. Great recipe!"
"1","5","These were excellent!! I followed other reviewers suggestions to refrigerate the peanut butter cups beforehand and then immediately put the cookie, once I placed the cup in it, back in the fridge so the chocolate wouldn't melt. I will make these every year!!"
"1","5","These are awesome and easy! I followed previous tips and froze the candy, also I waited for the cookie middles to sink before planting the candies. I did however skip the milk (my son drank the last of the milk), but from the taste, it didn't seem to miss it. =0) Thanks a bunch for this recipe!"
"1","5","Very yummy. I should've taken them out at 8 mins, but they didn't look done. I left them in for an extra min or 2 and the bottoms are right on the edge of being burnt. Still delicious! I will make these again!"
"1","5","These turn out beautifully and are absolutely delicious...and oh so simple! I followed the recipe exactly as stated. A few tips: Scooping with a tablespoon makes right at 40 cookies as the recipe calls for. I would definately bake these in a nonstick pan or spray with a tiny bit of cooking spray. Mine took 10 minutes at 375F to cook. These really have to be fully cooked, and that means that they start to crack on the tops. If you don't cook these all the way or try to remove them from the muffin pans too soon, they will fall apart. I just couldn't wait to try one, and although I'm sure these are great cool (haven't waited that long, yet!), you have to try one before they cool all the way! The chocolate sticks to the roof of your mouth and it is just heavenly. Love, love, love these!"
"1","5","good"
"1","5","My baking usually leaves something to be desired, and I had resigned myself to store bought or premixed cookie recipes, until I tried these :) I made these today out of sheer boredom and they turned out amazing. I followed the recipe to a tee, although I didn't have a mini muffin tin, so I used two regular size muffin tins, and a cookie sheet to make up the difference. Not only did they actually turn out, they taste amazing!!! I know they will be a hit with my hubby, who loves Reese's PBC's and my 5 year old little girl won't stay out of them. I will be making these again, if fact I'm pretty sure I will have to make another batch before Santa comes :)"
"1","5","VERY GOOD! Easy recipe, great results. Thanks!"
"1","5","These are tasty little treats that we have renamed;) Chocolate Peanut Butter Cuppy Cups. Easy to make, and even easier to eat. I throw the bag of peanut butter cups in the fridge for a few minutes, it makes it easier to peel off the paper wrapping, and into the freezer they go for when the cookies are baked. Make the cookie dough, pop the bowl in the fridge for at least a half hour, makes them easier to handle. Bake for 7 minutes, push in the peanut butter cups, and back into the fridge for an hour. I found the best pan to use is the Pampered Chef mini muffin tin, it makes 24 at a time. I use a spoon to loosen the edges of the cookie after they come out of the fridge. I took a batch to a Christmas party last weekend, I asked the hostess where she wanted me to put them, she said on the kitchen table and she'd put them out later with the other desserts. Well they didn't make it to the dessert table, gone in 25 minutes:) Thanks for a new family favorite!"
"1","5","made these for our annual cookie exchage....Super big hit! Everyone loved them and they are soooo easy to make!"
"1","5","Delicious little cookies. We make them with hershey kisses. They are softer than the typical kiss cookie, but that's what makes them so good."
"1","4","They came out great! The only thing is that the peanut butter cups are melty and runny when you take a bite. I also used hershey kisses in some of them. Advice: Unwrap the reeses cups before you take the cookies out of the oven! otherwise you will be scrambling to unwrap them and put them in before they are cooled. Also keep the reeses in the fridge beforehand."
"1","5","These are very delicious and so easy to make. My husband ate them as I was making cookie tins for all my neighbors! I had to make a second batch :) Fool proof cookie."
"1","4","These cookies are very easy, and turn out very pretty! Mine were a little flour-y though, and I know I followed it exactly; I always level my dry ingredients. Next time, I will probably use a normal pb cookie recipe and push the cups in, but these were still great :)"
"1","5","A giant hit in my house. They didn't last long at all. A new-found favorite."
"1","5","Freaking awesome. Guys especially love these cookies, I can't keep them around for more than a day!"
"1","5","1 batch wasn't enough for my family! I will be making a double batch this week!! I didn't have a mini muffin pan however so I just pushed the PB cup in the middle. Baked for 9 min and they were soft and delish!"
"1","3","I made these cookies and substituted Splenda for the brown and white sugars. They didn't taste bad. I thought they needed more peanut butter. I wasn't impressed. I am going to make them again with the regular sugars and see what happens."
"1","5","I would give these 10 starts if I could. Just made these for the first time and AMAZING is all I have to say. My 5 year daughter and husband can't keep their hands off of them already. Husband poured himself a glass of milk to go with them. Do freeze the peanut butter cups before putting in cookies and than put outside to cook off. We live in Nebraska and it's 11 degrees out so it works better than the freezer. If you screw this recipe up, you shouldn't be in the kitchen."
"1","5","Made just as is....absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!"
"1","5","These are amazing! They taste heavenly! I found the dough a little hard to roll with my hands, so I just scooped them with my cookie scooper spoon. I also tried making the cookies in the mini muffin pan and on a cookie sheet. I would recommend the mini muffin pan. The dough tends to spread a little bit on the cookie sheet so the cookie is a little thinner. I just prefer the look of them in the muffin pan, they look cuter. :)"
"1","5","oh my god these cookies are the best i cannot get my daughter to STOP eating them they are presents for Christmas for our friends"
"1","5","very good cool completely before taking out of muffin cups"
"1","5","Excellent! Very simple to make and little effort for a fabulous cookie! Love this recipe!"
"1","5","Fantastic! As for the lady that had her cookies crack, be sure you use the mini muffin tins not the standard. To remove I had a mini spatula that worked great. My friend and I made 8 batches to give as gifts and cookie exchange."
"1","5","Very tasty. Place the peanut butter cups in the freezer while preparing and baking the dough so the chocolate doesn't melt when pressing the cup into the cookie. Plan to let the finished cookies cool for hours before trying to remove them from the pan. The hardest part of making this cookie is removing it from the muffin pan. I had to score around the edges of the cookies with a knife before they would release from the pan. Next time I'll try Crisco rather than Pam."
"1","5","YUM! Didn't change a thing :) UPDATE: (12/22/2010) I was excited to make these again this year, however, I had the same problem of a previous reviewer. My cookies wouldn't come out of the pan and the rim came off of many of them. I used margarine instead of butter this time and I forgot to beat the egg before adding it to the batter. Perhaps one of those changes ruined the recipe for me?"
"1","5","Oh my gravy!!! These are sooooo delicious!! The first batch I put the peanut butter cup immediately into the dough when I removed the pan from the oven, then I put the pan in the frig to make the cupes easier to remove from the pan. The second batch i waited about 5 minutes after removing the pan from the oven before I put the peanut butter cup in the dough, then I removed the cups immediately on to a cooling rack. I like the second way better because its faster."
"1","5","I absolutely love these cookies!!! I followed another users advice and used 3/4' balls and baked for exactly 8 minutes as the recipe said. In addition I loved the idea of freezing the peanut butter cups before pressing into the hot cookie. Worked like a charm, and judging by the disappearing act on the cooling rack, hubby loved them too. Awesome Recipe, Must Try!"
"1","5","I made these for a meeting I was having and everyone LOVED them...I will definitely make then again!"
"1","5","Possibly the best 'easy' cookie I've ever made. Great recipe!"
"1","5","These cookies are AMAZING! I am making them for a cookie exchange party and am having a hard time not eating more than one! I did take a reviewers advice and freeze my peanut butter cups and noticed a difference after i forgot to put them back in the freezer between batches. These are soo easy to make. And would be great to make with kids!!!"
"1","5","Soooooo good!! My kids loved these, as did all of their friends. A little warning, though....they're very sugary and sweet. You won't be able to eat too many!!"
"1","5","These are just so good. Such an old PTA recipe to me. I remember my mom making these in the 80s. LOVE it. They're so rich though. I reduced the amount of peanut butter in the batter to 1/4 cup and it was still excellent. I put the unwrapped Reese's in the freezer for about 15 minutes... baked for 10 minutes (because on the first try, I baked for 8 minutes and they were still doughy on the bottom). I also used mini cupcake paper liners for my mini pans. This made 36 perfectly."
"1","5","These were good to begin with, but my husband and I both preferred them chilled. I had a hard time getting the cookies out of the mini-muffin tin, so for the second batch I used pretty paper cups."
"1","5","super easy and very delicious! great for a last minute cookie need"
"1","5","This recipe is so easy to follow ... the results are delicious!! The first time I made them I substituted margarine for the butter, but they are best with butter!"
"1","4","need to freeze peanut butter cups before inserting into cooked cookie dough! these are SO good!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Did not need to change a thing!"
"1","4","These went over really well with my family. I personally feel that they were even better the next day! I used a mini muffin pan, and cooked for 8 minutes. Next time I'm going to cook for 10 minutes as the bottoms were a little chewy. Made about 48 cookies. Also substituted some of the peanut butter cups for mini butterfingers and they were just as yummy!"
"1","4","These cookies really bring the wow factor as far as presentation goes. For me though the cookie part didn't have enough peanut butter. I may try a better PB cookie recipe to stick the pb cups into or try adding more pb to this recipe."
"1","5","I made these for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved them. They're just the right amount of peanutty flavour and chocolate. To make them fun and cute I cut the reeses in half and added two chocolate chips to make a happy face."
"1","5","So Good! My husband said these were the best cookies he's ever had, and he's very picky!"
"1","5","Awesome. I got 48 after using a small ice cream scoop. I didn't have enough PB Cups so I used M&M's and small chunks of Snickers Bars. You could add almost any candy. Great tip about freezing the PB Cups. Worked perfectly."
"1","5","my 10yr old daughter wanted to make something diffrent for her halloween party at school so i picked these and the moms wanted the recipe great great great is all i can say thanks alot"
"1","5","The best. Everyone asks for the recipe."
"1","5","My son gobbled most of these up and he was kind enough to save a few for eveyone else. However, they were gone by the next day."
"1","5","These are a staple in my house every Christmas. I love them. I have my own little tweeks, but overall they are perfect."
"1","5","my mom loved these cookies. r.i.p."
"1","5","So easy and YUMMY!!! My whole family loved these cookies. I am going to bake them again this weekend for my coworkers. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","DELIGHTFUL! The are so good. I have always made this kind of cookie with a chocolate kiss or star but the peanut butter cup is EVEN BETTER! I don't know if I'll ever make them any different again! I followed other reviewers suggestions to wait a min or two after removing from oven (the centers begin to sink) to add the PB cup. And refrigerate before removing from muffin pan. That does work best but is not required. I was rushed and removed from pan and then stuck in fridge and it worked fine. Anyhoo, these are great and I recommend them!"
"1","5","love these"
"1","5","These yummy little treats were absolutely scrumptious! Tip: Freeze the peanut butter cups (which SHOULD be Reeses) for at least an hour before baking/putting them in the cookies. Tip 2: Do NOT refrigerate the cookies! They will soak up all the nasty smells from said fridge and taste horrible! I made these cookies for the first time two years ago and have made them frequently since. In fact, I plan on making them again tonight(:"
"1","5","You can make these with refrigerated peanut butter cookie dough also. You slice the roll into 9 pieces...then cut each piece into 4 pieces so you have 36 mini muffins. The rest of the recipe remains the same but they turn our fabulously...and very quick!!!!"
"1","5","Really good, and super rich. I used the suggestion of someone before and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer. Excellent treat for tailgating."
"1","5","OMG WOW! Best peanut butter cookie in the world :) I made these last night & they were delish!!! I took some other reviewer's advice & opened up all my peanut butter cups & put them in the freezer while I made the cookies. Then I put the cookie dough in muffin tins on a cookie sheet, that way I could bake more at a time. 8 minutes was right on!! Absolutley perfect! They were a little raw in the middle but I like them that way. Then I quickly pressed the pb cups in them & they stayed together perfectly without making a melting mess. I popped them in the fridge for 10-15 min to cool & then served them. Yummy!!! I can't wait to make them agian & again lol :)"
"1","5","One of the best cookie recipes ever! Sooo good! I've made them many times and they are a huge hit with everyone I've given them to!"
"1","5","This recipe was great! If you refridgerate the cookies after putting in the peanutbutter cups they won't crack. My only problem was I didn't make enough!"
"1","5","The recipe is perfect just the way it is. Everyone LOVES them. Do put dough and pb cups in the fridge, it makes it easier to play with."
"1","5","i made theses for a cookie swap & everyone looooved them. followed the recipe exactly. froze the pb cups before inserting them. awesome!"
"1","5","I made this recipe for a holiday party and everyone loved them. The 2 dozen or so cookies I made went really fast. Even one of my relatives who never seems to eat sweets, couldn't stop raving about them. I will definitely make these wonderful cookies again!!"
"1","5","AWESOME."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! I made it for the first time today and they came out so good. I did put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes once they were done. The peanut butter cups do melt and to reset them the firge did just the trick. You can use regular size muffin tins if you want mine worked really well."
"1","5","it is a good recipe"
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly and they were so delicious!!! Everyone loved them! I read other reviews and unwrapped the peanut butter cups and popped them in the freezer/fridge before I started to bake (great idea!) and after the trays came out of the over, I put them in the freezer to cool down so they could handle easier and so I can bake the next set quicker. Definitely recommending having at least 2 mini-muffin trays! yummy :)"
"1","5","I loved these. They are easy and very yummy. My kids love them too. I tend to make two muffin pans worth and refrigerate the rest of the dough. This allows me to bake a fresh batch at a different time."
"1","5","Fantastic!"
"1","5","Very easy and soooo yummy! I double the batch because they fly off the plate."
"1","4","I'm always looking for new and interesting recipes, and this fit the bill. I used regular sized peanut butter cups (they were cheaper than the mini's, oddly enough) and cut them in half. I pressed them into the warm cookies after they came out and, WOW, that is something else. The peanut butter cup stayed goey and the cookie soft. This recipes is a keeper. Thanks, Buchko"
"1","5","Oh yeah, these are AWESOME!!! Made these to take to a soccer tournament and the kids and parents went nuts for them! My only mistake was I left the first batch in the oven for an extra few minutes cause they didn't look done. However, they were! I will be using this recipes again and again!!!!"
"1","5","So quick and easy to make and they were delicious. Freezing the peanut butter cups was a good idea. Always take things to work and let my co-workers taste test--two thumbs up from everyone! They didn't last very long."
"1","5","very good. I froze the peanut butter cups. Not sure if it made a difference but they were really really good"
"1","4","They were just okay. I thought they were too much of a hastle for the final product, but the PB cup idea is a keeper :)"
"1","5","I made these for my Father-in Law for Father's Day since he loves Peanut Butter and Chocolate. They were a huge hit! Mini-muffin pan worked out great.Barely had any left to snack on."
"1","5","Made a ton of cookies for X-mas, these were the first to go. The men in the house kept begging me to make more. Great recipes."
"1","5","These are fabulous and I don't really care for peanut butter cookies. I was afraid that with the candy they would be too sweet. But, they are perfect. Only change was I tripled the vanilla, which I do in most recipes."
"1","5","Add double the vanilla and 3/4 peanut butter and maybe a little bit of honey to the dough and top with carmel and chockolate!!"
"1","5","If you're in a hurry, just buy a roll of cookie dough. With the Reeces cup, it is hard to tell that the dough is not homemade."
"1","3","I was disappointed in these after reading the reviews. The batter was tasty but once assembled it was just kind of tasteless. I've had better cookies so I will not make these again."
"1","5","My daughter, who was home from college, and I wanted to make cookies, but we had VERY little time. These cookies were sooo easy and sooo sooo good! I brought them with me to the community dinner theatre that I was in that night, and backstage,they wer gone in minutes and I had many requests for the recipe! I loved how easy the mini muffin cups were for forming hte cookies. I am going to make them again, right now."
"1","5","Amazing! People ask me for the recipe all the time."
"1","5","I've made these cookies on several different occasions and they always go over well. They're definitely amazing!"
"1","4","Absolutely loved this. I changed the recipe the second time I made it. I added an extra half a cup of peanut butter and instead of peanut butter cups I pressed in Hershey kisses. Turned out fantastic!"
"1","5","The neighborhood comes running over when I make these."
"1","5","Easy and delicious! Like the reviews, i froze the PB cups first. Turned out great! These are on the keeper list."
"1","5","substitute peanut butter cups with 1/2 pieces of PC peanut melts. Push the melts firmly into hot cookie."
"1","5","Very easy recipe...the kids at Christmas loved these."
"1","4","Delicious. My only BIG complaint is that the recipe claims to make 40 cookies. I only got 27. I guess that I must have used too much dough per cookie, but mine turned out just like the photo. I substituted 1/3 of the sugar with stevia, and 1 1/4c flour with whole wheat flour. So good though! Making a double batch next time."
"1","5","This recipe was awesome !!!! Thanks will be a staple in our house"
"1","5","As a SERIOUS miniature Reese Cup fan, these cookies are a staple in my household!! Everybody LOVES these!"
"1","5","Yumm! I froze the PB cups. Had an issue with the cookie edges cracking when placig the PB cup into them. On my 2nd batch, I lightly pushed them into the cookie, then after they melted slightly I wiggled them in deeper. Seemed to work better then pushing then into the cookie as I did the first time."
"1","5","easy and yummy"
"1","5","LOVE THEM! Lasted forever too."
"1","5","These were absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as is, and they were rich, and very peanut-buttery. I made a batch of 60 cookies, and invited several people over, and they were all gone within a few hours! I received many compliments, and will definitely make it again!"
"1","5","This recipe was AMAZING! Definitely will be making it again. I did not have a mini muffin pan, but used a regular cookie sheet. They turned out delicious anyway (just cracked a bit when the Reeses were placed). I would also recommend freezing the Reeses. It made unwrapping and working with the candy very easy!"
"1","5","TO DIE FOR!!! I made these for a group of friends and they were gone before I knew it. They really are perfect and delicious!"
"1","5","Awesome!"
"1","5","Yum Yum Yum. I didn't have a mini muffin pan so i just put them on a baking sheet. The were flat and different, but still tasted really good."
"1","5","I rolled the dough out and made the cookies heart shaped with heart shaped reeses for V-Day- yum!"
"1","5","Amazing, addicting, absolutely best cookies I have ever had!"
"1","5","This was the best pb cookie that I've ever had and ever made! I made a batch last night to bring to work today and everyone raved about them. I've already had to copy the recipe 6 times so far today. Next time I just may experiment with caramel cups and a pecan..."
"1","5","Very simple and they taste excellent. Yum!"
"1","5","Wow! These were the best cookies I have ever had!!! The recommendation of refrigerating the dough prior to baking was a great help!"
"1","5","These were my favorite of all the cookies I made. Kept them in the fridge to hardened up the peanut butter. I like them a little colder, but I like my candy bars in the fridge, too. Great recipe!!"
"1","5","These cookies were delicious! I served them at a Christmas party and everyone thought they were store-bought--they looked so authentic! The only suggestion would be to let them cool completely in the mini muffin pans. It was somewhat hard to take them out without the bottom of the cookie breaking away. The baking process might be a bit longer if you let them sit longer, but it's well-worth it."
"1","5","Everyone loves these...I can't make enough of them or make them often enough."
"1","5","I have made this recipe several times. It is delicious! I find these cookies to be very sweet so I use a little less sugar. I fill the dough almost to the top of the muffin tins. I cook them for 6-7 minutes. I find that 8 minutes is a bit long. If these cookies overcook, they taste dry. I always end up with about 50 cookies. If I run out of peanut butter cups, I use Hershey's kisses which I press upsidedown into the cookie. Also, I find that greasing an ungreased muffin tin eliminates the difficulty of removing the cookies once they have cooled."
"1","5","I just finished baking a batch of these and they're amazing! I used cookie sheets lined with parchment paper and I think it worked great. I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar before placing on the sheet, it gives them a subtle sparkly look when done. I also used Hershey Kisses and pushed them into the cookies right after removing them from the oven. This worked great for me. The chocolate melts a bit and tastes awesome. The edges of the cookie cracked but this didn't bother me. These cookies are so easy to make, I'll definitely make them again."
"1","5","Really don't need anymore reveiws but these were awesome. I don't bake but my neighbor moved so i knew i wasn't getting a plate of cookies this year. I'm addicted to p-nut butter cups so thought i would try these , even bought the mini muffin tin.They turned out great. I tried making suger cookies and had to throw them out. Not so these. I went to target after christmas and bought a bunch of p-nut butter cups on sale. Will be making these alot. thanks"
"1","5","These were so easy to make and turned out so pretty! (plus gave me an excuse to buy the mini muffin pan :) For the holidays, I made bags of these, the Big Soft Ginger Cookies, Cashew Cookies, and Award Winning Chocolate Chip cookies (all from this site) and these were the biggest hit and disappeared the fastest!"
"1","5","Super easy to make. I have also made the low sugar version of these with natural peanut butter, slenda blend and sugar free peanut butter cups."
"1","5","The Best"
"1","5","This is an awesome recipe! Loved by all! Extremely easy to put together. Thanks!!!"
"1","5","Perfect!! My 8 yr old made these for daddy's Xmas gift- and they were a huge success!! Very simple to prepare, easy to bake, and the finished product melts in your mouth! We followed the recipe to the tee! Everything was perfect!! ~~I did want to add that 1 tbs of dough is sufficient!~~"
"1","5","Made a batch and brought to work. They were gone by 1. Everyone described them as peanut butter sugar cookies. I didn't alter the recipe at all."
"1","5","Didn't have muffin pan, just used a regular pan. Could shape or roll into balls, too goopy, but just spooned gobs onto the pan and still came out great! Put the PBCups in the freezer before pressing into cookies, then put cookes in fridge for the candy to harden again (they did melt and became quite gooey). After the cookies and PBcup cooled they were awesome!"
"1","5","I made these cookies substituting the peanut butter cups for kisses, and they were fantastic! My husband really loves them. Great recipe. Thanks!"
"1","5","Try this! I made it for my family's Christmas Cookie exchange and it was easily the best cookie there. Just make sure to chill the dough in the fridge before shaping it into balls."
"1","5","Excellent cookies! We can't stop eating them! Only thing I did differently was I dropped rolled balls on a cookie sheet as I don't have mini muffin pans. They turned out wonderfully. We also used half peanut butter cups and half Hershey Kisses (one kid doesn't like peanut butter cups). This will definately be a frequently cooked cookie in our house."
"1","5","WOW!! I love these. We ate 5 before they fully cooled. I added an extra tablespoon of PB, and used dark chocolate kisses and used a cookie sheet as opposed to the muffin pan. This recipe makes great peanut butter blossoms."
"1","5","Excellent and so fun to make. Thanks!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies! I used Hershey Kisses as well as Reese's Peanut Butter cups and left a few plain and made the criss cross fork marks on them. After one bite from the first batch out of the oven my husband said, you better make a second batch because I dont think these are going to last!"
"1","5","Sooo good. These are now my husband's favorite Christmas cookie. I definitely recommend making them in the mini muffin pan. I froze my peanut butter cups as others have suggested. Be sure to push the peanut butter cup all the way down. I was afraid I was going to have a hard time getting the cookie out of the pan, but they slip out perfectly with the help of a butter knife. Great recipe! Would give it more stars if I could!"
"1","5","No words can describe how amazing these cookies are. I followed the advice of another review and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while they were baking. I baked them for 8 mins (but only bake them for that long if you want them to be soft and chewy) If you want them a bit more crispy but yet still chewy bake them for 10 mins. This recipe is great for Christmas if you decorate them with red and green sprinkles, an m&m in the middle, etc.. Now I have to get them out of the oven!"
"1","5","Everyone loves these, many requests for the recipe."
"1","4","These cookies are easy to make and taste really great. I used whole wheat flour and chunky peanut butter and had no problems. My only issue was the chocolate for the peanut butter cups never firms up again, and so chocolate can get everywhere if you plan on mailing these to anyone or are transporting them anywhere. Better to refrigerate them."
"1","5","The BEST! These are so soft and yummy."
"1","5","RAVE REVIEWS!! My husband, the Reeces PB cup lover, said these cookies were 'awesome.' My brother, a peanut butter blossoms (with the kisses)fan, liked these even better! These will take care of any peanut butter chocolate craving you or someone you love has. Enjoy!"
"1","5","Very yummy & fun to make with the kids!"
"1","5","Great cookie! Easy to make, pretty to display and sooo tasty!"
"1","5","My sister and I have made these cookies for the past 2 years. Everyone loves them! I followed the reviews and put the PB cups in the fridge while making the cookies. They always turn out great. Fool proof!!"
"1","5","I made these for my hubby's Christmas Party and they were a BIG hit. Everyone was asking for the recipe!Thank you for sharing."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they came out absolutely perfect! Very easy and very delicious!"
"1","5","So awesome and easy to make.. I love the treasure in the middle. :)"
"1","5","Absolutely, unbelievably DELICIOUS!! I don't even like peanut butter that much but these are incredible...YUMMMM! I followed the directions to a T and only got about 30 cookies so I wish I double the recipe. But these are amazing!! UPDATE: I just got home from work and made 3 dozen more..these are amazing!!!"
"1","5","I set out to make these cookies for an event at my son's school. Then I remembered - no penuts. So, I made a few changes. First, I ommited the penut butter and the cookies still came out great. I placed frozen peppermint hershy kisses in the center and sprinkled the cookies with peppermint flavored sugar crystals (red and white). These came out great however my cookies did crack while pressing the kisses in the center. I also used a muffin pan - good suggestion."
"1","5","outstanding. Freeze the candies first, 8 minutes @350 was perfect. These are a breeze to make in the stand mixer and drop with a cookie dropper into the mini pan. Doubles, triples, yum!"
"1","5","Very good but very sweet! I used the many tips such as refrigerating the dough before scooping into pan and freezing pb cups before inserting into cookie. Big hit with hubby."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe. Kids and husband loved. Put the peanut butter cups in freezer the night before. After putting the peanut butter cups in cookies put in the refrig to cool. Also sprayed muffin tin with Pam. Cookies to crack."
"1","5","This is the best recipe I have ever found for peanut butter cup cookies. The cookie base turned out soft and perfectly chewy and just the right thickness. I didn't have mini muffin pans. So I used regular size, and they still turned out great! I am definitely storing this recipe for use every year."
"1","4","These cookies tasted great, but I am giving the recipe 4 stars because the muffin tins HAVE to be sprayed with PAM in order for the cookies to come out nicely. I followed the recipe and did not spray them & had a rough time getting them out and wrecked the appearance of several in the process."
"1","5","These turned out perfect. Made 1/2 with white chocolate PB cups and 1/2 with regular, and added colored sprinkles when chocolate was warm for festive appearance. Do put pb cups in freezer till ready and put cookies in fridge after gently loosening with knife till center sets. Highly recommend the mini muffin tins and I did lightly spray the pan with cooking spray. I also used a mini scoop for 40 perfect balls, and chilled before trying to get out of pan. It was cold out, so I put mine on a table on the deck (right off the kitchen) and they chilled very quickly. Put on some Christmas music and enjoy the experience!"
"1","4","I say grease the pan and grease it well with pam. Otherwise you will have a horrible time getting them out. They took a bit longer than recipe said."
"1","5","awesome, awesome, awesome. nothing can top this recipe. I used regular muffin pans instead and they still turned out great!!"
"1","4","I was disappointed. I bought the 11 oz. bag of mini Reese's and ran out. Followed directions to a tee and not as great as old standbys that I passed on to try something new. If you eat one warm, put whole cookie in your mouth or you'll get messy like my hubby who couldn't wait as they look so good."
"1","5","Extremely tasty! Huge hit at a dinner party for both adults and kids!"
"1","5","mmmmmmm these are great! thanks for the tips about putting the candy in the freezer first!"
"1","5","I followed this receipe exactly and it came out perfect. Freezing the peanut butter cups prior to pushing in the cookie is necessary. These are so good and everyone loves them!"
"1","5","My husband and friends loved this recipe! My only alteration to this recipe was to add a 1/4 cup of Nutella chocolate hazelnut spread to the dough. I also tried three different methods of baking these cookies: in a mini muffin tin as the original recipe recommends then pressing the p-nut butter cup in after baking, just scooping the dough into balls and pressing the p-nut butter cup in after baking, I also just made regular cookies sans p-nut butter cup. Over all the most favored cookies were the mini muffin tin cookies but all of them were good."
"1","5","These are the best cookies ever. Super easy and very quick to make."
"1","5","These cookies are great! I followed the ingredient list exactly as it was written. As suggested by some other reviewers, I unwrapped the peanut butter cups and popped them into the freezer while I was preparing the ingredients. When I pulled the baked cookies out of the oven (by the way the bake time was perfect!)the frozen peanut butter cups were easy to press into the center of the cookie without having a mess. My daughter, who is in college, took them back to school and all her friends enjoyed them. I have a Christmas Cookie Walk coming up in December and these definitely will be on my baking list! Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!"
"1","5","Super moist peanut butter cookie! I use the dough just for cookies rather than making the peanut butter 'cups'. So good! All my friends love them!"
"1","5","Everyone loved them and they are too cute!"
"1","5","These were very good. I didn't have mini muffin tins, so I followed someone's suggestion and just scooped them onto a baking sheet (stone) with pampered chef medium scoop. then pressed the reese's cup into the center once they came out of the oven. If you push them gently the cookie doesn't break as much, but I think it will crack a little. I hate that you have to wait to eat them, but I just ate 3 in a row. Love them and will make again. Thanks for the recipe. **Also, I only got 30 cookies from this recipe."
"1","5","I would make the balls of dough at least 1 inch in diameter, any smaller and when putting in the peanut butter cup, the top will stick out, so make sure you're using enough dough. *side note: I also put the peanut butter cups in the freezer for 2 hours before using them, and took off the wrapping a half hour prior to putting them in the cookies.  Wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","It is a very nice peanut butter treat. Turned out very chewy, and the chocolate was wonderfully gooey. Followed directions to the T, and they are great."
"1","5","This is a recipe I have from decades ago....this and the same one minus the milk. I always go with the no milk one it sets right for me and I press my cup/kiss in right after I take it out of the oven and yes....they are supposed to have lovely cracks on the cookie part :)"
"1","5","so good and so easy to make! This ones a keeper."
"1","5","So easy to do. These are rich and delicious. Everyone loves these even the people who don't like PB."
"1","5","Soooo good.  I followed a reviewer's advice and used 2 teaspoons of dough per mini-muffin cup, and froze the pb cups before putting them into the hot cookies. People LOVED them and I would definitely make again. And I actually made more than 40 cookies (about 4 dozen), and the plain baked dough was delicious too! Thanks for the post!"
"1","5","I never follow a recipe exactly, their just meant to be guidelines, right? I did a few things to make this cookie a bit healthier and they turned out fabulous! First I substituted 1/4 cup all purpose for whole wheat, then I added 1/4 cup honey instead of the white sugar (I used the brown sugar as called for), and added about 2 TBSP of ground flaxseed. I also had to use regular sized muffin pans, so I made them a tad bigger. They turned out beautifully! I just love recipes that work for everyone's creativity!"
"1","5","I have been wanting to bake these cookies for a long time. After finally getting my mini muffin pan I searched many recipes and this one had the best reviews.  The cookies turned out aweseome! My family loves these cookies. I have to make a double batch just for them!  Definatly better to have the cups frozen before putting them in the cookies. Thats a great job for kids too!"
"1","4","These cookies came out good! I'm not a huge peanut butter fan but family members are and they really enjoyed them. I thought these cookies tasted even better after a couple of days. They were fairly easy to make. Be sure to follow the helpful hints and chill the candies for a bit before hand. Then unwrap them all and have them ready to go when the cookies are done. I also sprinkled a little sugar on the tops of the cookies which gave them extra yumminess. Fairly easy and enjoyable recipe - I recommend it!"
"1","5","Soooo good! I use chocolate and peanut butter chips instead, but this is such a good recipe for the cookie! So peanut-buttery!"
"1","2","Maybe it's just me, but it tasted too sweet and mushy"
"1","4","Didn’t have Mini-muffin tins, used buttered baking sheet instead and it turned out fine, with the exception that it was bigger cookies – 24 instead of 40. Compensated the largeness of the cookie by chopping up frozen peanut butter cups and decorating the side of the cookie – so the cookie had a full cup as well as chunks of peanut butter cups on the side."
"1","3","This was a good recipe the only thing is with the peanut butter cups it was a little too salty. We also tried them with Rolos and they were okay."
"1","5","Yummy. I froze the peanut butter cups so they didn't melt right away when put in the cookie. I also refrigerated the dough when not in use. I make these often. Thanks."
"1","5","Yummy! I just baked a batch for my daughter's fundraiser at her school and it took me less than an hour total to prepare and bake them. As for the cookies cracking that some people complained about, don't press in your pre-frozen peanut butter cups all the way, it's okay if the top of the p.b. cup is sticking out of the cookie!"
"1","5","Great cookie! I get raves whenever I make them."
"1","3","I baked these cookies exactly as written. They were good but not exceptional. I honestly think that the candy is what makes the cookie. The actual cookie part was really not spectacular, kind of bland. I think the idea is wonderful and very pretty. I'd like to find a better Peanut Butter Cookie recipe and try that next time with the peanut butter cups. It was very rich but being baked in small bite size portions in a mini muffin pan helps. Thank you for sharing the idea."
"1","5","Very Yummy. I didn't use the mini muffin pan and they came out fine."
"1","1","I followed this recipe to the 't' and even put the pb cups in the freezer like suggested per other reviewers. These really have no taste to them. I don't think I would make these again"
"1","5","Delicious and super easy to make! I froze the Reese Cups in the freezer to avoid any melting as I was pressing them into the cookie. I also put the dough into the fridge for a short period to make the dough easier to work with. This will be my volunteer to make cookie for any type of family gathering!"
"1","5","Wow. I've never posted a photo before, but these are so delicious and look as pretty as they taste, that I had to post one. Excellent. Definitely put them in the fridge after baking to set up the chocolate. Very rich, so these are perfect for bringing to parties or handing out to friends -- otherwise you'll eat all of them."
"1","5","This is the best recipe in the would the peanut butter cup make the cookie. I make them for my brother brithday party they were a hit.    A"
"1","5","This has to be the best peanut butter cookie I had ever tasted. You would think that it would be super sweet because of the peanut butter cup but it was actually not. The recipe said that it would make 40 but I was only able to make around 32. This one is a keeper!!"
"1","5","I made these this christmas, and everyone was raving about them. They were extremely easy to make, held their shape and texture, and looked really cute to boot. Definitely a keeper."
"1","5","YUM! We love this recipe! I made it tonight for a bake sale we are having at work tomorrow and I anticipate them to be a huge hit. I recommend freezing the peanut butter cups, sticking them in fresh out of the oven cookies, and then putting the pan in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. It still takes a bit for the cup to set firm again (in fact it's been two hours and they still are melty). But I will definitely be making this again!"
"1","5","Instead of using a mini muffin pan, I just made them on a cookie sheet, and instead of pressing a peanut butter cup in afterward, I chopped them up and sprinkled them on top before baking. (I also used about 2 tbsp. less butter) These cookies are DELICIOUS!  Yummieee!"
"1","5","These turned out so professional looking! My boyfriend scarfed these down and asked me to make more this weekend. They are best after they are allowed to cool or else the middle is gooey. Will make again and again. Thanks!!"
"1","4","These were pretty good but the cookie part was not tasty enough to stand alone. The peanut butter cup is what made these cookie delicious. They are quick and simple to make and are a nice presentation. I sprinkled some colored sprinkles on top once the chocolate was a bit melted. That made them more attractive. I took them to work and everyone loved them but I think they were a bit lacking. These would be exciting for children to make because they are easy and kind of fun to make."
"1","5","These are so quick and easy!! I made these one time on a lunch hour and took back to work with me. My co-workers were impressed!! Great also for putting in Christmas cookie trays or sending as a snack for school parties."
"1","4","These were really good and got lots of compliments. They were fairly easy to make as well. Just not 5-star, but definitely a solid 4-star."
"1","5","My mom used to make a similar cookie to this when I was a kid. But these are way better. I stuck the peanut butter cups in the freezer before placing them in the cookies. I like my cookies a bit underdone, so I baked them for about 7 minutes. I ended up with about 50 cookies and I don't think they lasted 2 days! We love them!!!"
"1","4","Fun different way to make Peanut Butter Cookies. They weren't the easiest to get out of the pan, but they weren't too difficult either. Very yummy. I don't think they will last very long in my house :)"
"1","5","Definitely the winner in the race of my favorite cookie! I freeze my Reeses before hand, and even stick the cookies in the freezer after I push them into the cookies...just so the chocolate doesn't melt. The perfect cookie!"
"1","5","I've made these several times now and taken them to work. They are always a huge hit. Once set in the break room, they never last more than 4 hours (and I even make a double batch!). I don't have a mini-muffin pan, so I just make 40ish small balls and bake them on an ungreased cookie sheet. When I pull them out of the oven, I press the peanut butter cups into them and let them cool. They also are great with peanut butter kisses."
"1","5","Perfect for any peanut butter lover. I put reese peanut butter hearts instead since I made these for valentine's day. I also made a big cookie (shape dough in ball and place directly on cookie sheet) for my husband to take to work in his lunch and he liked them that way more as opposed to using a mini muffin pan."
"1","5","This recipe rocks if you're a PB cup lover like we are! I followed the suggestions of many - freezing the PB cups, placing the dough in the fridge for an hour or more and using the small cookie scoop. As far as the ingredients and basic instructions, I followed them to the 'T' and they are a hit. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Absolutely FABULOUS! 6 minutes is the key time to cook the cookies in a 24 mini muffin pan. Also make sure to roll the dough in sugar before putting in the greased mini muffin pan. This is everyone's favorite!"
"1","5","Yummy cookies! If you love peanut butter then these cookies are a score! I think I would prefer a cookie that is more like shortbread but I'm not sure you could push the peanut butter cup in like you can on these. Overall quite good and I'll probably make them again."
"1","5","My five year old called these cookies 'peanut butter cup pies.' Be warned-these are incredibly rich!Perfect for children (and husbands who eat late at night when no one is around). I did freeze the candies before pressing into cookie. I also used two level teaspoons dough in each ball as per another's suggestion. I also used chunky peanut butter- turned out fine. Thanks for recipe, Nancy. It is a keeper!"
"1","5","One word...YUM!"
"1","5","Just like my Nana used to make when I was a kid! Delicious!"
"1","5","I made these cookies for a Christmas Eve service at my church and I got some many compliements. They were so good and so easy to make. Thank You!"
"1","5","I followed several of the other reviews and this turned out Wonderful. Our favorite cookie. Took these to our school event for the cheerleaders and they went very fast!"
"1","5","Chocolate & peanut butter, how could it be anything but delicious!"
"1","5","Very good!! These were a big hit at my party. There weren't any left!!! A kids favorite."
"1","5","REALLY good...they were gone in like a day and are soooo cute. they look like mini peanut butter pies when you use the muffin pans"
"1","5","It was so nice to have a recipe that was so highly regarded. I am not the greatest baker but I knew I had a good shot at success with these. It did not disappoint! I followed the information most people advised like unwrapping and freezing the cups and refrigerated the dough for an hour after I made it. They were perfect. I knew almost 500 people could not be wrong!"
"1","5","PERFECT!"
"1","5","Wonderfully fluffy and tasty!  What a great hit with my husbands' coworkers -  so many asked for the recipe!"
"1","5","I made these several times this holiday season. My family loved them. The cookies are not too rich on the peanut butter, as you might think. I followed the recipe word for word. Do not overbake."
"1","5","These are wonderful cookies!! I made them exactly as written...and my 9 year old son helped. We both had a fun time making the cookies. They look beautiful when done...and kids love unwrapping and placing the peanut butter cups. Very Tasty...not too sweet."
"1","5","These were very soft and chewy. I followed others suggestions and chilled the dough. I rounded them into balls, baked, then pulled them out to push the PB cups in. I then immediately put them in the freezer."
"1","5","I had these in a tupperware container during christmas and thought that with all the other stuff on the counter no one was eating them because it was a closed container. To my surprise, I opened the box to find it empty. Everyone loved these."
"1","4","Turned out quite well and the family members loved them even when I was indifferent. My mom actually liked them without the chocolate PB cups inside! I took some of the suggestions made by previous reviewers and here's what I thought:  1. Definitely refrigerate the cups before use 2. Do not wait for the cookies to cool a bit before inserting - the top becomes more hard and it cracks more as you try to insert the PB cups 3. Definitely cool the cookies in the fridge before removing from the muffin molds - the chocolate gets surprisingly melted as they sit in the cookie for a few seconds and I made the mistake of removing them right after I put them in and the chocolate gooey PB cups just got everywhere 4. You don't need to refrigerate the dough after making them into small balls - just pop em in and they're fine 5. Roll out the 40 dough balls before starting to bake - that way you can get the same size of cookie for all of them by adjusting the sizes of each one until they're roughly the same 5. Try with different types of chocolate or even without chocolate at all if you think these are too sweet"
"1","3","couldnt get the cookie part to cook fully"
"1","5","loved this recipe! I made a double batch at Thanksgiving, froze half of it and used the rest for Christmas. I also made some christmas blossom cookies out of this same dough and they turned out great, too!"
"1","5","Easiest cookie recipe ever- and I love pressing the PB cups into the cookies at the end =)"
"1","5","These are the best! My husband liked them better the next day. He brought them to work, they were a hit! I did put the pb cups in the freezer, and put the dough in the fridge for a while, otherwise, I followed it exactly!!!!"
"1","5","WOW, this deserves more than 5 stars!! These were perfect, not too sweet, not too peanut-buttery, and so EASY to make and even easier to EAT! I used a small scoop to evenly measure out the batter, which didn't need refrigeration before working with. However, my peanut butter is refrigerated, so maybe that makes a difference. I mixed everything by hand, froze the pb cups, and baked the batter in a mini-muffin tin for 10 minutes. When I took them out I lightly poked the middle of each cookie and let it cool for 5 minutes before pushing in a frozen pb cup. I then put the cookies out on our cold porch (we live in MN and it's winter time!) to keep the pb cups from melting too much. SO YUMMY, these will be gone in a flash!"
"1","5","The rave reviews were right on! These are awesome. I rolled the balls in sugar, just placed them on a cookie sheet since I don't have a mini muffin pan, and baked 7 minutes. Soooo good!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious. . .and with a few changes, perfect. Changes: Roll the dough balls in a cinnamon & sugar mixture. Use a Rolo instead of a peanut butter cup. Bake at only 350 degrees (not 375) for 5-6 minutes; This will keep the outside from getting too brown. We gave both the peanut butter cup and Rolo versions as Christmas gifts. Everyone agreed that the Rolo really added something special; Although, the peanut butter cups are still very good. Thanks for this great recipe!"
"1","5","Oh boy are these good. I think these are my new favorite cookies, seriously. Tip: stick the pb cups in the fridge while you make the cookies and bake them. They are MUCH easier to get into the cookie that way. Otherwise, they start to melt as you are pushing them in. Also, while these are yummy all the time, they are soooo good while still warm because the pb cup is still gooey... A must have for peanut butter lovers (like me!)"
"1","5","A great cookie! I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I rolled the dough into balls and just baked them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. I also rolled the balls in white sugar before baking. If you're packing these to take somewhere, you might want to stick them in the fridge overnight first ... the peanut butter cups don't firm up enough for packing if you just leave them out."
"1","4","Some of the other reviewers are definitely right: 8 minutes is TOO LONG. I tried one from my first batch; they were tasty, but overcooked. We'll see how my second batch turns out once they cool (only baked for 7 minutes). I'm making a bunch of cookies for my Soldiers- either way- I'm sure they will get eaten. I also froze my PB cups for about a half hour first. After the cookies had cooled a bit in the pan, I removed them (using a small knife like others) and transfered them to a cookie rack. Be careful when moving them- the chocolate has a tendency to slide around. So far so good. I will update this review after I get some feedback from the troops."
"1","5","wonderful cookies, easy to make. i'm using them to give as christmas gifts to family, teachers, etc. definitely put the peanut butter cups in the freezer; it makes them easier to work with. my family LOVED them. my husband kept going back for more so i knew this was a keeper."
"1","5","Delicious...Delicious...Delicious! I followed the exact recipe except that I left the pb cups in the fridge for about 45 minutes before peeling the wrap off. My husband LOVED these! By the way this recipe is not the same one that is on the package of pb cups. There are some slight variations to this one. Thanks for sharing :-)"
"1","5","really really good. i made a batch, which was like thirty five cookies. i;m ninteen and i live in an apartment. my friends come over ALL THE TIME. they ate all the cookies up in one day and then came over with the ingredients and asked me to make triple the recipe!! i did it and now theres a million cookies all over my kitchen at this exact moment... :)"
"1","5","Fantastic, easy and fun to make recipie that is a hit every time!"
"1","5","I made these last night. I followed the exact directions, except i made them in a regular sized cupcake pan. As i was making the second batch, looked at the back of the package of peanut butter cups and there was this recipe! They are called Peanut Butter Temptations!! Everything is exact(including some wordng) except for i think the flour measurements and the time, which the time on the bag works better. Overall they were really good and easy cookies, and i will be making them again!!"
"1","5","I made these with my mom at her house. We had already made the dough when I realized that she didn't have mini muffin pans. I baked them in balls on a regular cookie sheet, and they still came out great!"
"1","5","amazing, I love this cookie. you can't just eat one."
"1","5","I've made these for years. I use any kind of mini candy."
"1","5","How do I love these cookies? Let me count the ways!!:  1)They are simple to make, with ingredients I have on hand. 2)The recipe is easily doubled. 3)When made in a silicone mini-muffin pan with pre-chilled peanut butter cups, they are impossible to mess up! 4)No matter how many I make, they disappear in one day. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!"
"1","5","Have made these cookies 2 years in a row and everyone loves them!! Used them for a cookie exchange and they are gone! Followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!"
"1","5","Kids absolutely love them. I followed the recipe exactly, cooked in the mini muffin tins and they were great!!!"
"1","5","These are just wonderful- my kids adore them. I do use the mini muffin paper liners so they come out of the pan easily."
"1","5","This system does not allow for enough stars!!!!! I have made them two nights in a row. My husband and I ate too many while making them and did not have enough for our cookie trays! I did run out of peanut butter cups, so we subbed dark chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. We liked them that way too. Very yummy warm, I actually have not had one cool...yet!"
"1","5","These are delicious!! I can't believe I had no problems in making these. The dough worked wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly. To make the balls all uniform I used a measure tablespoon leveled off. Worked great! I also chilled the cookies before getting them out of the pans. I found that if you turn the cookie just a tad it will lift out quite easily. I agree with another reviewer that the mini muffin pans are the way to go. These were so easy and so good! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","If your in a time crunch use premade cookie dough and to be festive use miniture muffin liners."
"1","5","These were awesome. I didn't have enough pb cups so I use some hershey's kisses and they were great too."
"1","5","DIVINE!!!! No need to use mini muffin cups, I used the normal sized ones and they still come out fabulous!"
"1","5","Great recipe! Didn't change a thing. When I took them out of the oven and added the peanut butter cup I let them cool 10 minutes then removed them carefully and let them cool in the freezer. These are good hot or cold! Everyone loved them and I will add them to my holiday cookie recipes. Thanks!"
"1","5","I make a variety of Christmas cookies every year, and these are the ones that people always rave about. Sometimes they can be hard to get out of the pan though. To make things easier, I started using those little mini cupcake liners - so much easier to get out of the pan without breaking off the tops, and they look really cute and festive in the cookie tin. I always keep the Reese's pb cups in the freezer, so they don't melt as you're inserting them. This is a great recipe. I'll continue to make these every year."
"1","5","This is the best PB cookie recipe I've ever made even with the few adjustments I made. I didn't have any butter so I used shortening instead. My first batch didn't spread (was it because of the shortening?) so I ended up refrigerating the batter and rolling it out. I didn't have any PB cups but I it would have tasted even more awesome. Absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","AMAZING! GREAT COOKIES! Very EASY and QUICK. yum yum yum!!!!!!!!!!  tip: refrigerate or freeze p-nut butter cups so that the chocolate doesn't come off the cup. Also, after they sit for a minute w/ the melted chocolate refridgerate them..."
"1","5","These cookies are scrumptious with a capital S. I suggest making them as regular cookies and not in a mini-muffin pan."
"1","5","Simply amazing- these cookies are also fantastic with regular Hershey's kisses!"
"1","5","So good! Freezing the PB cups before putting them into the hot cookie dough really helped them to retain their shape. I took these to a church potluck and while there were a ton of other desserts, not one of these cookies were left at the end of the evening!"
"1","5","Very easy to make, big hit with everyone who attended the potluck!! I made half with milk chocolate Reese's and the other half with white chocolate and both of them went fast. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","These cookies come out perfect with out a ton of effort. I did put them in the freezer just like other members did. I cannot stop eating them."
"1","5","These cookies are WONDERFUL!! Recipe is just great just as it is. I made these for the first time last year for Christmas baskets that I give away. I had to keep making more batches since I couldn't keep my husband and son away from them, LOL. Co-workers raved about these for days. The cookie is moist and oh so yummy!!!!!!!"
"1","5","Very good recipe! My family isn't too crazy about chocolate but love peanut butter cookies. Everyone loved these cookies!! I rolled my cookies in sugar before baking. Also, put the reese's in the freezer before adding to baked cookies. Definately will make again."
"1","5","I just made these for our volleyball fundraiser and wanted to make the right cookie that would sell! This was it, EVERYONE just raved about them; they are an eye catcher on the table. I also froze the candies before-hand and it did the trick. I ran out of candies and tried to make regular peanut butter cookies, but the went almost completely flat. Next time I will still cook them in the mini-muffin tins to make mini peanut butter muffins! Thanks! I will be making these again."
"1","5","Made it very very good.A restaurant asked me to bake this one for them. My son's friend are asking me to bake them a batch."
"1","4","These cookies were very good! I would probably lean toward rating them a 4-1/2. My 8-year-old son said they were 'delicious!' I did not read through the reviews before I made them. I will probably freeze the peanut butter cups next time before I make them. Am planning on taking these to a cookie sale later this fall. Thanks much--they are wonderful!! I got 32 cookies out of this recipe--I must have made the cookies a little too big!!"
"1","5","I made these for my brother's football team when they have spaghetti dinners the night before their games. They all LOVED them and were gone everytime! I would definetly bake these on cookie sheets and then press the peanut butter cup in immedietly after taking out of the oven. Also, I would recommend putting them in the frige and let the peaunut butter cup to harden again."
"1","5","Deyummylicious!"
"1","5","I'm a cookie snob and these pass my test. Excellent. Made this for a huge family reunion. I froze the cookies before I went. They were a huge hit. Everyone raved about them."
"1","5","I made these cookies for my boyfriend and his coworkers at the fire house, they were a big hit!!!"
"1","5","these were a big hit at a gathering i had the other night. i used a regular muffin tin and regular sized reese cups and left them in the oven for an extra minute. very tasty!"
"1","4","These cookies are very rich but very good. I needed to bake them a little longer than the recipe stated, though. The first batch was way undercooked."
"1","5","I made this when company was coming for the holidays. It was so good, a guest asked me to whip up another batch. I ended up making three more during the weekend. Quick, easy, and a creative change for the kids to take to school for the class on special occasions."
"1","5","this recipe makes a nice light in texture, mild in taste cookie. i substituted 1/2 c. all purpose flour with whole wheat flour & used hershey's select dark kisses to cut down the calorie count. briefly chilling the dough helped me to roll out more uniform balls. these treats looked great at our college fundraiser. many thanks nancy, some day we'll try your recipe with the peanut butter cups....i'm sure they're decadent!"
"1","3","I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the dough was very runny. I had to freeze it in order to roll into balls. They tasted ok, but took too much work to make them turn out."
"1","5","Great recipe!!!"
"1","5","My 12 yr old daughter made these. With peanut butter cups in some and also with chocolate stars. Everyone at christmas loved these. Were going to make them with hersheys kisses also."
"1","5","A very tasty, attractive cookie. Certainly not necessary, but I smoothed out the ridges of the peanut butter cup by giving it a gentle twist after inserting into the baked cookie."
"1","5","These are perfect just as the recipe suggests. I wish I had doubled it and will next time. Everyone loves them and they were a great addition to the tins I handed out. This will be a permanent recipe in my Christmas collection!"
"1","5","oh yeah...these are some good cookies..so easy tomake too."
"1","4","They tasted good, but didn't turn out correctly. The Peanutbutter Cups melted in the cookies and made the cookies fall apart. I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but I probably over looked something."
"1","5","Easy, simple and yummy. Hubbie says creative and delicious!"
"1","5","i made these yesterday for christmas, put them in the mini baking pan ..When I took them out I pressed a mini reese cup in the middle. Put them in the fridge to cool.These are SO GOOD and easy to make. thanks for the recipe!!"
"1","5","Very, very rich, but very delicious. THe first time I made these, I had a hard time getting them out of the pan, many crumbled. The next time I used mini muffin liners, and it was so much easier!"
"1","5","to die for! These were a huge hit at my house. Highly recommended!"
"1","5","I used a convection oven at 350 for 8-9 minutes (or until just starting to brown). Yum! Crispy outside & chewy inside! Some tips: I used a cookie sheet. If you have trouble rolling the dough into balls (1' was best for me), put the mixture in the refrigerator for a while. The finished cookie will be smoother. The warmer room temperature dough will not roll well, but if you just put 1' globs on the cookie sheet, it really lets the outside become more crispy. They're not as perfect and pretty but they're sure good! Also, you can speed up the cooling process by putting them in the fridge for 15 minutes."
"1","5","So easy, so good, SO worth making!I made it exactly the way it was written, coworkers couldn't get enough of them! My daughter loved helping me stick the peanut butter cups in the middle of the cookies. I will make these again and again! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Excellent cookie. Can't stop eating them. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
"1","5","These cookies are wonderful and so easy to make. They made me look like I knew what I was doing! Thanks for helping me impress my boss with wonderful Christmas Cookies!"
"1","5","Wonderful! Added red and green sugar to the tops right after the peanut butter cups are placed in the cookie. Always seem to have 36 - works perfect with my pans."
"1","5","These were great! I didn't have a mini muffin pan, but I baked them like a cookie and inserted the cup after baking and they were still great! I will defenitly make these again."
"1","5","so good & very easy! i used paper liners so there was no mess & no sticking. i was worried they weren't done when i looked at them but they came out perfectly! everybody loved them. i put christmas sprinkles on the top to make them look festive!"
"1","5","These cute little 'cups' are really good! I took the advice from other reviewers and froze the peanut butter cups until ready to use. Make sure you let the cookie cool completely before attempting to remove. Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
"1","5","I never baked cookies before I tried these, and now I have made them twice because everyone loves them so much! They all ask, how did you do that??? But they are so simple to make, and delicious to eat!"
"1","5","My husband is never EVER going to let me make another type of cookies. These were fabulous. I substituted a gluten free flour blend for the all-purpose flour and they turned out perfect. Best cookie ever."
"1","5","If you are looking for a delicious cookie, this is the one!!! The cookie is VERY moist and chewy, and it looks so pretty when you use the cup cake pans too bake them! I only had one cup cake pan, with only 6 cups in it so I had to make some using a cookie sheet. I do recommend using the cup cake pans because it just makes them look prettier and more evenly sized... They were just excellent!!! I will make these over and over again! Thank you!"
"1","5","Yummy :-D"
"1","5","This recipe turned out great. The dough is a lot easier to handle after it has been chilled for a while. I didn't have any sprinkles, so I lightly crushed some M&Ms and put them on top."
"1","5","Yummy and decadent! How can you go wrong with peanut butter two ways? I took the other reviewers advice and greased the mini muffin pans and the cookies came out very easily. I waited a little while on the last batch, and because they had cooled, they were a little harder to get out. One thing to keep in mind when you are removing them from the pans is that the chocolate gets pretty liquidy. I tipped a couple over and the chocolate spilled over the tops. I also froze the peanut butter cups ahead of time (thank you reviewrs!) and that made them a breeze to unwrap. I doubled the recipe, rolled the balls to slightly larger than walnut size and yielded 70 cookies. I will definitely make this one again."
"1","5","Definetly a MUST"
"1","5","Perfect! I doubled the recipe, used mini muffin cup liners and turned out several batches. Always a hit - Thank you!!"
"1","5","These were wonderful! I made the dough a week ahead of time and left in the refridgerator. I did spray the mini-muffin pans because I did not want to risk them sticking. I want to explore other recipes using the same idea - chocolate with mint kisses or rolos, etc. Oh - and I added x-mas sprinkles and they look adorable - like little tarts."
"1","5","These were wonderful, I took them to our church Christmas party and they were the first thing that was gone."
"1","5","Yum. A little bit time consuming - but they do look darling - very nice addition to the christmas cookie plate."
"1","4","These cookies were good but if you make the dough balls too big they don't cook evenly and when you press the peanut butter cup in at the end, the sides get messed up. Using the mini muffin pan is a hassle and next time I'll try not using it and maybe they'll turn out better."
"1","5","WOW! My new favorite cookie recipe- this is fabulous! I did use a non-stick spray and waited until cookies were cool so getting them out of the pan was not a problem. I also used holiday sprinkles which made them look perfect for my cookie exchange. THANK YOU!"
"1","4","Thought these were great! I'll probably make them again to share with others this holiday. I would suggest less peanut butter in the cookie dough since the cups hold lots of the peanut butter taste already"
"1","5","Super easy and tasty"
"1","5","Love them, love them, love them! I, too, froze the chocolates before taking the wrappers off. It made it much easier! A definite crowd pleaser!"
"1","5","We made 5 new batches of cookies this holiday season, and these were the BEST! DELICIOUS! We used peanut butter cups from Trader Joes, but were a few short so we used a few Reese's. The Trader Joes ones were a little better."
"1","5","Great cookie! Was a hit at the cookie exchange."
"1","4","These are definetly yummy.... Kids loved them. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, just used a regular cookie sheet and they seemed to have come out just fine. I love peanut butter and chocolate, but they did seem a little too sweet for me... We will make these again."
"1","5","This is an excellent and easy recipe. I made 48 cookies. I let the cookies cool in the non-stick, ungreased tray for about five minutes and it was easy to remove them from the tray with a butter knife. Next time I will add festive sprinkles as shown in the picture."
"1","5","Awesome. Didn't even make it to Christmas and I made a double batch."
"1","5","This cookie is super easy and delicious. A definite kid favorite!"
"1","5","These are amazing!! and really easy! I just need more mini muffin pans."
"1","4","I made these cookies to take to a party and they were indeed very delicious. However, the recipe states 'UNGREASED' muffin tins and they really stuck to the bottom. Every single one. Next time I am definately spraying the muffin tins with cooking spray."
"1","4","These were really yummy. Just don't press the PB cup down too far into the dough or it will hit bottom and make it difficult to remove the cookies from the tins. Using this idea (and the suggestion of another reviewer), I used pre-packaged sugar cookie dough and pressed in a Hershey's cherry cordial Kiss in each one. Yummy!!"
"1","5","Very good, would use the same recipe and add chocolate kisses instead for a change. Not overly peanut buttery either."
"1","5","Delicious cookie and candy. Easy to make, but disappears too quickly. Freezing peanut butter cups is a great tip. Make sure dough balls are larger (bigger than walnut size)so candy disappears in center."
"1","5","really good. my first batch I didn't bake long enough so the second batch i baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect."
"1","4","Didn't have mini-muffin pan, so instead used another technique from different cookie recipe on this site (Caramel Filled Chocolate Cookies). Chilled dough then rolled candy piece inside the dough ball before baking on greased pan (for the 8 minutes indicated). Let sit on cookie sheet for 3-4 minutes before transferring. Probably only draw-back to this method is a relative loss of presentation...but still looks and tastes fine. Also used assortment of rolos, reeses minis, and hersheys kisses as another reviewer suggested."
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful! Practically dances in your mouth and makes you instantly happy!! Love this delicious treat :-)"
"1","5","These are the CUTEST little things I ever saw! I had to run out and buy a mini-muffin tin because the first batch were too flat for the pb cups. It is worth it because I am going to make these OVER AND OVER again!"
"1","5","These are so good, it's hard to stop after eating one! My kids and husband and friends all LOVED these cookies!"
"1","5","Fantastic!! will make again"
"1","5","These are fantastic. I didn't have a muffin pan, so I just rolled the dough into small balls on a cookie sheet. After I put the cups in, I had to put them in the fridge to keep the cups from melting too much."
"1","5","These cookies were gone in a couple of hours. Very gooey and good!"
"1","5","I made these for the girls at work back in October and every holiday since then! I bring them to every social function and they are gobbled up. You definitly cannot stop at just one!"
"1","5","The kids and I loved them!!"
"1","5","I loved these cookies. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, you will too!"
"1","5","So good! I have loved these cookies for years and always thought they were difficult to make until I found this recipe. They are so easy and disappear in no time!"
"1","5","These cookies were VERY good and extemely easy to make. My 4 and 6 year olds loved pushing the peanut butter cups into the warm centers. I would recommend using mini cupcake papers, though. I had a hard time getting the cookies out of the mini muffin tins without papers. But, overall, a great recipe!"
"1","5","Ive made these 2 years in a row for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They have replaced my plain jane peanutbutter cookies. They are so nice to look at and very tasty."
"1","5","Such a great Christmas cookie, we love these!"
"1","5","Absolutely DELICIOUS! If your looking to fullfill your sweet tooth , this is the recipe for you!"
"1","5","I agree with everyone's reviews - these are delicious and very easy to make. All my friends loved them!"
"1","5","Easy and Excellent!"
"1","5","Delicious! I love to make them around the holidays. Last year I sent them in for my husband's employees and they didn't even last the day--he already has requests that I make them again this Christmas!! These have become a staple cookie around here!"
"1","5","Yum, Yum!! These are so good! My husband gobbled them up!"
"1","5","I made these for Christmas this year as part of my cookie tray and the were the first things gone. They are wonderful and would be great all year round. Plus they are super easy. I have two minimuffin trays and I made 40 cookies in no time."
"1","5","These are so simple and yummy! I made them as thank you gift and they just looked so beautiful. I used both the choc lovers pb cup and the pb lovers cups. I also added some more peanut butter to the batter!"
"1","5","My kids LOVED making this with me. The baking time was just enough to get the candies unwrapped and to keep the kids busy while they waited."
"1","3","I was a little disappointed in these, I was expecting them to be alot better after reading the reviews. They are good, but nothing spectactular."
"1","5","An absolute favorite in my family! Followed the recipe to a 'T'."
"1","5","FABULOUS! So easy to make and a HUGE hit at a Superbowl party. Will definately make these again. I threw in a little more peanut butter."
"1","4","The cookie part needs to be a bit more peanut-buttery, but they are quite a treat!"
"1","5","Delicious! Everyone enjoyed them!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies! I substituted shortening in place of the butter and because I do not have a mini muffin tin, I used a regular baking sheet. This worked very well and the cookies turned out soft and delicious. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","I have been making this recipe at Christmas for several years now, and it's been the rave of all the cookies that I make. My hubbyloves these cookies and eats at least half of a batch himself! These are awesome cookies!! They do crack when you put the PB cups into the cookie. I also put them in the freezer to cool quickly or the cookie part softens the PB cup."
"1","5","Highly recommend. Did follow suggestion to place cookies in fridge after placing peanut butter cups. Something different and addicting."
"1","5","This was wonderful!!! I used Wal-Mart Peanut Butter Cups (they're cheaper, less waxy, and less to unwrap)and cut them in half (so there is a top and a bottom). They turned out a little less gooey (and gooey is not a bad thing) so, they're less messy for my little kids. We all love this recipe!!! Thanks Nancy!"
"1","5","These are a big hit at our house. For anyone who likes peanut butter this is the one. Definitely a keeper. Also very easy to make. Thanks for sharing."
"1","4","We made they cookies with some slight alterations. We wrapped the cookie dough all the way around the p.b. cup before cooking. This made for a less messy cookie, as there was no chocolate to ooze all over, but it made less cookies this way and took a bit longer to prepare."
"1","5","Everyone loved these at Christmas dinner...Thank you..."
"1","5","These cookies are great! If you like peanut butter and chocolate (and who doesn't), these are for you."
"0","5","Best PB Candy Cookie recipe EVER!!! These are so so easy to make, they make a lot and are very good! I always get asked for the recipe!"
"0","5","Turned out exactly as described"
"0","5","This sounds so good!I have to make this"
"0","5","Yummy bite of chocolate and peanut butter! So easy to make too."
"0","5","Came out great I make these for my bf and he loves them!!"
"0","5","i use cannabis infused 100% organic cold pressed coconut oil in place of the butter and a little extra vanilla and all natural ingredients and they are amazing!"
"0","5","No changes made to ingredients :)  We did even out the mini ice cream scoop of dough deposited within the mini muffin pan, with a back of a teaspoon. No refrigeration was required. Thank-you to the post which noted: Do NOT bake more than the stated directions of (8) minutes. So correct :) yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy !"
"0","5","My family and friends loved it. Came out perfectly and it was my first time making it ??"
"0","5","These didn't even last a full day in the house. Big hit"
"0","5","Best. Cookies. Ever. I have only ever received rave reviews on these. My brother, who dislikes cookies and never eats them, eats these happily! Definitely freeze the peanut butter cups before use, it makes the process and the cookies a whole lot cleaner! I used 'no sugar added' peanut butter to make sure the cookies didn't come out sickly sweet. These were perfect!"
"0","5","AMAZING and always such a hit with peanut butter cookie lovers and even with those that don't typically care for peanut butter cookies! Also a HUGE success in my kids classrooms! For those without allergies obviously"
"0","5","I have tried this recipe a few times, they turn out great no changes. going to make a double batch for my wedding july 25th 2015. thank you for this great recipe"
"0","5","This recipe is great. I love it. I wanted to make something because I was bored and I love it. I'm adding it to my recipe book."
"0","5","One of my favorite recipes from this site, the peanut butter and chocolate complement each other so perfectly! These cookies taste just like my grandma's ;)"
"0","5","I followed the directions exactly (I did put the unwrapped peanut butter cups in the fridge while making the dough- that was a helpful tip!) and these cookies are pretty much perfect in every way... For the few bad reviews I read, you need to try again and actually follow the directions, because there is no way that these would come out bad if you did it right. It seems like a lot of people were complaining that they didn't cook all the way- my guess is you probably tried to make these in a regular muffin pan, using too much dough per cookie... I doubled the recipe and got 90 cookies, so for those who said it didn't make as many servings as specified, you made the cookies too big. These were DELICIOUS, and for the ingredients you use, you get a LOT of cookies!"
"0","5","really good. Super simple, too."
"0","5","These are delish! I am going to make then and sell then at my school fair. It does help though to push down on the cookie a bit before you put them in the oven."
"0","5","I have made these and everyone loved them. THEN instead of making them with cookie, I bought a chocolate brownie mix. I made the mix according to the directions. Then I sprayed the mini muffin pan with cooking spray and poured the muffin mix into the pans. I backed the brownies according to the directions on the box. After pulling the brownies out of the oven, I pushed the peanut butter cups in and let them cool for a few minutes. Then I removed them from the pans. Super super good if you are a peanut butter chocolate lover."
"0","5","they are soooo good i made them for my sisters tea party they were a hit"
"0","5","I made turkey tacos for supper and my daughter made these cookies....absolutely delicious they aren't even really sweet but awesome. Made no changes wonderful!!"
"0","1","Nice but I don't like them"
"0","4","Really good but we prefer reg. peanut butter cookies with a side of reeses cups."
"0","5","My son loves these. They are best fresh out of the oven when chocolate is melting mmmmmm."
"0","4","I just finished making these they are good, instead of peanut butter cups I made a blueberry glaze turned out great"
"0","5","These cookies are FANTASTIC!!! I will for sure make alot of these cookies for my family! Its so easy"
"0","5","This recipe was AMAZING!! It was very good and it was gone in a second, everyone loved them including me. I stuffed my self when eating these it is very hard to stop. But this recipe is very rich. And full of peanut butter so if u don't mind the richness of this amazing cookie I would recommend it to you."
"0","5","these are awesome, especially when they first come out of the over. got many compliments, thanks!"
"0","5","Very easy to make. They are sooooo delicious!!"
"0","5","Delicious, easy food! :)"
"0","5","Excellent! Hubby and kids loved!"
"0","5","So easy and delicious! I added sprinkles while the peanut butter cups were still warm, and they turned out great!"
"0","5","This recipe is EPIC! i have used this recipe multiple times and with amazing results. My family enjoyed this so much,they were begging for more. best thing ever!"
"0","5","delicous"
"0","5","These never last! They are perfect. A little taste of delicious sweet chocolate and peanut butter deliciousness. I always add a little extra peanut butter. More is better, right? :)"
"0","5","They were delicious i had a party with twenty people and these were perfect the boys ate them in five minuets."
"0","4","These were good and easy--came out exactly how they look in the picture. I took reviewers' advice and chilled the candies before pressing them into the dough. I didn't have a problem with the dough 'cracking'--sure, there are small cracks when you press the candy in, but it doesn't look bad. The only thing I would change next time is not 'mixing well' when the flour is added, but just mixing until combined. The cookies came out a little dry, and I'm wondering if that's why. Also, when you add the flour, the dough is very soft but not sticky--it rolls up into balls just fine. As someone else noted, don't bake longer than 8 minutes--they were plenty done by then. Next time, I might start checking a bit earlier. I'm also curious how they would come out using natural peanut butter."
"0","5","The only thing different I did was use a cookie sheet instead of a muffin pan. They look. Little cracked but taste AMAZING!!!"
"0","4","I made this gluten/egg/dairy milk free (the Reese's are good ole Reese's). Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour, substitute 1/3c applesauce + 1/2tsp baking soda to replace the egg, Earth Balance spread to replace the butter and sweetened vanilla almond milk for the cow milk. The baking time needed to be extended about 3 mins; otherwise, they would fall part but, soooo good. Then I wrapped the cookies in Saran Wrap and between the first and second piece of plastic wrap put the candy wrapper. So cute and tasty! Plus, the wrapping keeps me from popping them in my mouth! More for sharing!"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing. We didn't have a mini muffin pan, so asked our neighbors and they had one! Surprisingly 48 cookies came out!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe. I double the peanut butter to satisfy my indulgence. I also freeze the peanut butter cups beforehand, and it really helps reduce any mess."
"0","5","I have made these a million times and never once have I used a mini muffin pan. I cook exactly like directed and use frozen peanut butter cups. I have had people get into fights over the last one! Any negative reviews on this recipe must have done something wrong."
"0","5","Loved these! I like to think of them as 'reverse peanut butter cups'. I ended up with a little too much filling per cookie. I tried dark chocolate and regular and the milk was definitely better. Great Christmas cookies, because they look like they take way more work than they actually do."
"0","5","No fail easy recipe for great tasting cookies!"
"0","5","Rave reviews from my family and friends. My kids loved making these..."
"0","5","penut butter cookies are delisous and my sibligs enjoy them to"
"0","5","My grandfathers favorite!!"
"0","5","These were delicious!!! I made them for all of my neighbors for Christmas and they all asked for the recipe. I just rolled them into balls and out and put them on cookie sheets. And freeze the peanut butter cups!"
"0","5","Wonderful and easy! Especially warm!"
"0","5","Didn't change anything in this recipe except to make a thumbprint in the center of each ball before baking so the cookie didn't crack so much when I pushed the peanut butter cup into it. These were awesome! I can't wait to try them with the brownie mix that I read about in one of the reviews."
"0","5","One Word EXCELLENT,easy to make and the family loved these cookies"
"0","5","Made these for my work's cookie sharing party... They were a hit! I made my first batch with dark chocolate pb cups and the second batch with regular. Both were delicious. Only thing is my boyfriend's fave cookie pb blossoms made with pb cups (not in mini muffin shape) and he didn't feel this had the correct 'ratio of cookie to pb cup' compared to those. Everyone at work raved about them though... I'm relatively new there and someone told me I was stealing her baking market! Definitely plan on making them again... I'm going to try to play with the cookie size to see if I can find the perfect cookie ratio for the man though, lol. He is hard to please... :)"
"0","5","Great recipe! Very easy to make and done in no time. The only thing I did not like is when you mix in the flour it's very difficult to mix. Other than that it's a great one that I will make again!"
"0","5","Followed each step as is! Excellent treat! They go great in my Christmas baking tins!"
"0","5","I've been making these for years! Every time I take them somewhere I get so many complements. They never last long. The hardest (actually the most time consuming part) is removing the wrappers from the peanut butter cups. They are a yummy and fun cookie."
"0","5","These were the best cookies I made this Christmas season. Will definitely make a double batch next time!"
"0","4","Many reviews said bake for 8 minutes, no longer. I cooked one pan for 8 minutes and they came out almost like raw cookie dough. Cooked the next batch 10 minutes, came out perfect. Both tasted fine."
"0","5","Awesome little cookie. My 5 year old godson kept walking around with this cookie in hand and telling everyone that it was his favourite cookie ever! So easy and quick to make. Made exactly as written. The trick is to freeze the peanut butter cups and then press them in as soon as the cookie comes out of the oven. Little to no cracking. I also used caramel cups because bulk barn only had half if the pb cups. I also used Hersey kisses and put the tips in first and they turned out amazing as well."
"0","5","These were fantastic. Whole family loved them. So easy to make."
"0","4","Great combo."
"0","5","I made this for Christmas and it was an instant hit with my family! Followed the recipe as is and the results were great! I don't have a scoop so I rolled the cookie dough into balls by hand (the dough is not sticky so it is easy to handle) instead and ended up making 36 cookies. I agree with the suggestion made by Steph to freeze the unwrapped peanut butter cups for ease of unwrapping (especially if you live in a warm area, since the bottoms of the peanut butter cups have a tendency to stick to the brown paper). The candies melt pretty quickly though, so you have to be careful when removing them from the muffin pans. I am definitely going to make this again but next time, I'll follow the suggestion of popping the muffin pan in the chiller before removing the cookies so that the centers won't be as gooey (didn't have that luxury since I only had one pan)."
"0","5","Made these and rolled them into balls, baked them for 8 minutes, took them out and pressed the peanut butter cups in and baked them for 2 more minutes. People at work couldn't get enough of them. I was called evil repeatedly for bringing something so sinfully good in when a lot of people were starting their new years diets!! Don't over add the flour though or they will fall apart. I rolled them into balls in confectioners sugar to keep them from sticking and set them right on the pan...easy peasy and so good!!"
"0","5","if you make these and want them to last, hide them!"
"0","5","The kids loved making these for Santa! Like others, I also unwrapped the Reese cups and placed them in the freezer while we mixed and baked. Super easy!"
"0","5","This was a big hit. Like one of the other reviewers said, when they first come out after eight minutes they don't look or feel cooked all the way, but they are. After putting the candy in I left them cool in the pan for about 30 minutes then removed them. They were awesome."
"0","5","Delicious and easy! I used a teaspoon size to scoop the cookie dough into the mini muffin tin. Next time I will use something slightly bigger because when I pushed the Reese's cup into it a few cookies had melted chocolate at the bottom of the cookie as if there wasn't enough dough to smooch it into. I too froze the Reese's cups."
"0","4","i had to use a cookie sheet as i didn't have a mini muffin pan. the flavor of the cookie with the candy was good but dry, almost like eating a spoonful of pb. I wonder if there's a secret to keeping a pb cookie moist?"
"0","5","Great recipe. I didn't change a thing except the baking time. 8 minutes w/dark colored muffin tins was a little too long, at least for my oven. My boys, big and small, love these cookies! :O)"
"0","5","These turned out perfect!! Our new favorite addition to Christmas cookie baking. We did unwrap and freeze pb cups before cookies were baked. Didn't change the recipe at all and they turned out perfect!!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe as written and they turned out perfectly! Will definitely be using this one again and again. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","awesome, i used white chocolate peanut butter cups, if i changed anything it would be to do gluten free"
"0","5","Super easy , this is a keeper for the holidays!!"
"0","5","Simple recipe to follow and turn out exactly as picture shows :) Yummy too!"
"0","5","Worked out great! I followed the directions and had no problems- I also froze the Reeses before I used em! Made em for a holiday party!"
"0","5","Very easy and quick!"
"0","4","I tried this recipe and turned out great..but I do want to say that the batter was a little too thin to shape into balls. Just add more flour as needed to achieve the correct stage."
"0","5","AVOID ORGANIC PEANUT BUTTER! I used organic peanut butter and almond milk instead of regular milk. I don't think the almond milk influenced anything but the organic peanut butter is VERY oily. No matter what brand. The recipe calls for an non greased mini muffin pan. I think that the amount of oil in the organic peanut butter coated the pan and made it difficult thoroughly cook the cookie. If you insist on using organic peanut butter, I had to use smaller dough balls, and dry them all with a paper towel just before putting them into the pan/oven to get rid of as much oil as possible. Regardless of the process of trial and error with the whole batch, they turned out amazing!! ...the final batch at lease. Once you finally perfect it, it tastes awesome. Actually it's amazing whether it's perfect or still undercooked. Just be weary about the organic/oily brands of peanut butter."
"0","5","These cookies are so delish! Everyone LOVES and always asks for more. The recipe works perfect as-is! No changes needed! If you follow the recipe just like it says, you will not have any issues! Works perfect every time!:)"
"0","5","MADE THESE FOR MY CHRISTMAS COOKIE TRAYS THIS YEAR! THEY ARE FANTASTIC!!MY ONLY CHANGE WAS I ADDED A BIT MORE PEANUT BUTTER.THEY ARE DELICIOUS! I WILL MAKE THESE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!"
"0","5","Easy and always yummy!"
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","Easy to make, my son loved them."
"0","5","Followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! I also recommend freezing the peanut butter cups."
"0","5","roll to the size of a large marble, smaller than a walnut to get 40, very good"
"0","4","These were just ok."
"0","4","these are really good but i think the next time i make them i with a tad more peanut butter and a little less salt. i used a full sized muffin pan and the unwrapped tiny Reese's cups for a lightly less sugary cookie. just added a min to cooking time."
"0","5","These cookies were super easy to make not to mention DELICIOUS!!! These have become a new family favorite! :)"
"0","5","Awesome recipe, easy to double and instead of peanut butter I used cookie butter from trader joes and it was amazing!!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing!! They make your kitchen smell SOOOO good! Insead of all peanut butter in the batter I did half nutella- half peanut butter. I cut down the sugar a bit so that the nutella wouldn't over power the sweetness. Over all these are amazing!! :)"
"0","5","These are yummy. If you need a timesaver, try using ready made peanut butter cookie dough."
"0","5","Made exactly as stated turned out perfect! very rich!"
"0","5","So good! I bring these to work sometimes and my coworkers gobble them up every time. For those vegans out there (or if you just like to cut back on animal products), you can cut out the egg and milk and add 1/2 a banana and 2 T of almond milk. I still won the cookie bake-off with them!"
"0","5","These came out perfectly! I followed a few recommendations of freezing the Reese's, putting the dough in the fridge for about an hour before baking and putting the finished product in the fridge to cool. However I only got 30, not 40. No biggie though. Yummy!"
"0","5","Followed the instructions with no problems. Ty"
"0","5","Totally amazing.also pretty much mess free and its awesome to be able to prep all the cookies into baking cups before hand. It fun to unwrap the cookie like a Reese's ha ha"
"0","5","Yummy yummy"
"0","5","I tried this out today & my boyfriend LOVED em! I'm not a peanut butter fan but I tried one & they are great! Soft & moist & not too sweet. I followed a lot of the reviews such as unwrapping the cups & placing them in the fridge prior to, this worked great. I didn't have a mini cupcake pan so I used a flat sheet, foil & baking spray & they turned out beautifully. They did crack but I don't even mind, I like the texture."
"0","5","so delicious :)"
"0","5","Refrigerated peanut butter cookie dough can be used to save time. Made both ways and didn't tatse any difference. The peanut butter cup is the main tatse."
"0","5","These cookies are easy and decadent. I made some bigger and some smaller size cookies on a cookie sheet, not a muffin tin. The larger were more successful in that they didn't overcook. I cooked the larger for 10 minutes. Overall, great recipe and super easy for novice bakers."
"0","5","OMG! These turned out AMAZING! I halved the recipe cause I only had 20 peanut butter cups left and instead of vanilla extract, I used maple syrup. Ho! ly! ! Amazing. My husband just smiled and laughed when he ate it and immediately requested that I go get more peanut butter cups. Make them - you will not be sorry :)"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome and super easy to make!! Everyone loved them!!!"
"0","5","Went better than all other desserts. My father in law asked I leave the left overs with him. My sister was bummed she only got a dozen. HIGHLY recomend these. Only change is a little more flour to give a slightly more cake-like cookie."
"0","5","loved them"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly as it is (as one should if they're going to rate it), and they were simply wonderful. I just had to make an extra batch to take to my family for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved them."
"0","5","I am going to try a variation of this recipie made with pre-made toll house cookie mix and using mini muffin cups on a cookie sheet. Sounds like it will be a croud pleaser in my house."
"0","5","These are a hit with family and friends. Definitely baking these again this year."
"0","5","I make using store bought dough. Use half portion of dough for each spot in muffin pan. I also use muffin liners to match the holiday or theme of party. Try different variations....chocolate chip, sugar cookie ect. The white chocolate Reese's are awesome!"
"0","3","My family likes Reese's PB cups, peanut butter cookies, and chocolate chip cookies but none of us really liked this combination. After the first batch we decided to leave them straight up PB cookies with no candy center."
"0","5","Great recipe! Turned out perfect! I also opted to freeze the peanut butter cups before hand but followed the rest of the recipe as is."
"0","5","So easy and delicious! Fantastic failproof recipe. I followed it exactly and my cookies turned out perfect. The only change I made was using a cookie sheet, which worked just fine. Great tip from other reviews: freeze peanut butter cups before inserting. A must. And i refridgerated the dough before scooping. I'll definitely make these again."
"0","5","Delicious and so easy!"
"0","5","Super easy and yummy! I made these for my daughter whose favorite candy is peanut butter cups."
"0","5","They came out amazing, i used a regular size cupcake pan and just made a little more dough and cook them about 14 min in the toaster oven and the came out great!"
"0","5","These were awesome and yummy. A do again must. I took advice from many and froze the mini cups and put my batter in fridge in between handling."
"0","5","These are easy and a crowd pleaser. I also make these using a brownie mix instead of peanut butter cookie dough. They never last very long!!"
"0","5","These were amazing and so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and took some of the other bakers hints. Placed the PB in freezer, waited a minute or two before placing them in the cookies and places the tray in the fridge before removing. Perfect results! Now all I need to do is make more. They won't last long."
"0","5","I tried this recipe as is, with no tweaks... They came out perfect! At first I was afraid they were going to be a little too rich, but the mini muffin pan provides just the right size for your sweet tooth. I did follow some of the reviews and froze the peanut butter cups before pressing them into the cookie and that worked out great. I utilized both dark chocolate and regular peanut butter cups, and they each provide their own unique flavor. Can't wait to make these for Thanksgiving for the fam =)"
"0","5","These are delicious and so easy!"
"0","5","Yummy!"
"0","5","My friends and family LOVE when I make these cookies. They are simple and pretty fast compared to other cookie recipes.  The trick of putting the PB cups in the freezer before adding them to the cookies works really well!"
"0","5","Add Small Reese's Pieces to the top for a little decoration:) Makes them that much more adorable."
"0","4","Very good but very sweet. It's a perfect base cookie to try other types of candy bars."
"0","5","These cookies were melt in your mouth delicious, I've made them on two occasions but after the second time I pulled them out of the refrigerator, after cooling, you couldn't taste the peanut butter. But besides that, these cookies are great. I recommend giving this recipe a try."
"0","5","I tried a batch without the mini muffin tin and it worked, but when i tried another bath with the mini muffin tin the peanut butter cup to cookie ratio was perfect! Its an awesome recipe and I can not wait until I can make more!"
"0","5","absolutely perfect! i made a single batch the first time, then twice more i have made a double batch (within 1 month of finding this recipe)... clearly these cookies are excellent and the recipe is spot on. we like to pop the cookie in the microwave for a few seconds to warm slightly before devouring."
"0","5","I follow this recipe exactly and they turn out PERFECT every time. I get SO many compliments on these! Great recipe!"
"0","5","YEP, they're as good as all the reviews. A little (maybe a lot) rich, but that's what special occasions are for."
"0","5","These are awesome! I baked these for my coworkers to snack on before Christmas and I received many compliments! Everyone wanted the recipe! I baked another batch for my family and they were gone in no time! If you love peanut butter cups, you'll love these even better!"
"0","5","it is amazing u have to try it"
"0","5","Amaaaazing!"
"0","2","I backed them longer than 8 minutes. They seemed a little doughy when I pulled them out. They were too rich for my tastes as well."
"0","5","Perfect as is!"
"0","5","Awesome! Loved them. I cooled mine in the pan in the fridge for a few mins before taking the cookies out (if you try to remove them before they are cool the cookies crumble). One of the very few recipes that actually yields the amount of cookies it says it will."
"0","4","Very good and easy, these went fast. I ended up running out of mini reeses and filled the last six with dark chocolate pieces. I think I liked those even better than the reeses ones!"
"0","5","Did these today for a get together and they were a hit everyone adults and kids loved them I will definitely be making these again......"
"0","5","This recipie is super good. I wouldn't make any changes. Push the Peanut butter cups into the cookies right after taking them out of the oven. The cookies are always a hit and always run out before any other deserts. I love these cookies and all of my friends do too."
"0","5","These are really delicious! Just sent off a box to our son for Valentines Day and my husband is delighted there were a few that wouldn't fit! I only ended up with a total of 30 so mine must have been a bit bigger but I wouldn't change a thing. If you like a soft cookie, peanut butter and chocolate these can't be beat!"
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful!! I just used them for a cooking activity at the nursing home where I work and they were easy, quick and delicious. Everyone got to help do something. We followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great."
"0","5","I used Wow butter (soy), and it turned out wonderful. I will make these again."
"0","4","This recipe is pretty good. I think it could use a little less salt and a touch more sugar. The fluffyness is a little more like a cookie cake but i will definatley make this again! my kids enjoyed throwing everything together and it came out good! Just another helpful hint i wouldnt put the chocolates in the cookie right away id give it a few seconds first."
"0","4","Very good, pretty simple."
"0","5","Very nice, they almost tasted better the next day."
"0","5","Awesome!"
"0","5","This recipe is perfect. If you are a peanut butter lover, these are for you."
"0","4","These were good. Everyone else seemed to love them more than I did. It takes a lot longer than 8 minutes to bake these cookies! I would recommend baking them for 10 minutes, then placing the PB cups in them and bake them for an additional 5-7 minutes."
"0","5","I made these for Christmas gifts, and everyone thought I was a culinary genious. I made the first batch without the mini muffin pan. They ended up looking like a flowers with the reeses as the middle, so I called them Reese's Peanut Butter Blossoms. They dfinitely look more professional with the mini muffin pan, but either way they flew out of the kitchen as quickly as I baked them!!"
"0","5","I made 4 doz. for a New Years party. They were all gone in 30 minutes. Make twice what you think you'll need and still watch them go!"
"0","5","I love these! I make them every Christmas and people line up for them."
"0","5","You can't go wrong with these - they are fantastic!"
"0","5","Always popular. I use the mini mini pb cups and find that waiting 5 mins or so after the cookies come out of the oven before pressing the pb cup into the center helps to prevent the cookie caving in around it. Maybe if I used the bigger ones that wouldnt happen."
"0","5","My favorite cookie recipe!"
"0","5","Absolutely amazing! So easy, first cookie I made that didn't come out looking like a flat pancake. Taste wonderful, hubby and I have a hard time not grabbing one everytime we walk by them."
"0","5","Best cookies ever!! These cookies were such a big hit at our Christmas party - they were devoured in 5 minutes! I did put the Reese's peanut butter cups in the freezer while the cookies were baking & that helped prevent the cups from melting too much. I used a small muffin pan which was the perfect size for the Reese's peanut butter cups. Make sure to double or triple the recipe to have extras on hand. These cookies store well in an air tight container and taste just as good a few days later. This recipe is definitely one of our favorites!"
"0","5","Creamy, soft, delicious! Quite a hit with everyone! Easy to make!"
"0","5","These are very good!!!"
"0","5","These cookies are fabulous. I found the recipe and decided to make for a family Christmas cookie bake-off. I had the winning cookie!! I did do as other reviewers suggested and froze the peanut butter cups."
"0","5","So delicious and easy to make. And they look so fancy when they are done! Yum!"
"0","5","Peanut buttery yumminess! I followed the recipe exactly and came out with perfect results :D"
"0","3","I had some trouble, but some of it was my fault. I made the balls too small, and they did not fill the cup. We bought one bag of candy, but we ran out 2/3 of the way through the recipe. It was nearly impossible to get the cookies out of the pan without damaging them. They taste good, but I don't think I will follow this particular recipe unless I make several changes, including using paper cups or greased pans."
"0","5","Easy to make and enjoyed by all."
"0","4","The batter only made about 30 cookies, not 40. Also, you can put the balls on a cookie sheet. Don't need a mini muffin pan"
"0","5","I was very impressed with this recipe. These cookies were delicious and they also looked wonderful. I had made a cookie tray and these stood out from the rest. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","5","These cookies were a hit. I followed the instructions exactly but pre-froze the PB cups as suggested. I didn't have a mini muffin pan and just put them in a regular muffin pan and they didn't really take on any kind of shape, probably could've just used a regular cookie sheet. The cookies cracked when I pressed the PB cups in, but that doesn't bother me cause they are sooo yummy!"
"0","5","These cookies are absolutely delicious! I have made them a couple times now and people absolutely go nuts for them. I do not have a mini muffin pan so I have to use a regular sized pan. I just make the balls bigger so I get 30 cookies instead of 40. If you don't freeze the pb cups, as long as you push them right to the bottom of the baked cookie right away, the melted chocolate will stay put to cool overnight. I also use the PC pb cups as they are cheaper than Reese's. I do plan on trying this recipe with a caramel cup as well. The only challenge I had here was keeping my boyfriends hands off the freshly baked, melted chocolate deliciousness!"
"0","5","These are amazing! Made them for the first time last week. Will be adding these to my annual Christmas cookie list! I followed other reviewers suggestions by freezing the peanut butter cups (after removing the foil wrap and paper cup) and chilling the batter."
"0","5","First made these little beauties a couple years back for a holiday cookie tray for the neighbors. They were well-received then, and a few days ago, they were again, well-received at my work Christmas party. With baking, I find it's more of an 'exact science' so I followed this recipe to the letter. I do freeze the PB cups and wait a few minutes after removing the tray from the oven to press the cups in; just waiting until the middles start to slightly sink. This year, I sprinkled red & green colored sugar on the tops when they were still hot. Sometimes I pop the entire tray in the fridge; sometimes I don't. Either way, they're fine. I just make sure I roll the balls fairly big so they puff up enough, otherwise you'll get a short little cookie with the PB cup just sitting on top."
"0","5","These are great and the family loves them. They are a little difficult to get out of the mini muffin tin even with cooking spray so some broke at the base, but that just meant the family could eat those first."
"0","4","Turned out great. Make just as recommended!"
"0","5","I used both white and dark reeses cups. I did exactly as recipe said, except I used a regular sized muffin tin, and it made about 2 dozen, not 40. I did freeze the reeses before putting them in the cookie, it was perfect. The cookies are great and hopefully the family will feel as excited about eating them tomorrow as I do! Gotta love Christmas cookies! Also, one thing to keep in mind is that they are a softer kinda cookie so if you like hard cookies (my dad does, but I like soft) then you might need some adjusting there."
"0","5","I just made this kind of cookie for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! They are soft and chewy and taste great! I will definitely make these again! I followed the advice of others and froze the peanut butter cups and am glad that I did. The top of the peanut butter cup got a little runny, but without freezing them-it would have taken a lot more cooling time before you could even touch them."
"0","5","I just made these and they aren't going to hang around past tonight. They're wonderful. What I did after reading some review, and thankyou for the ones that said to chill the candy first, but I used a 1tsp melon baller type spoon and also used a Wilton 24 cup insulated pan and some olive oil spray. They came out perfect, and came out of the pan in 7 mins after baking. Recomend this to anyone that likes peanut butter."
"0","5","Always a favorite in my house any time of year."
"0","5","I followed the instructions to the t and it came out really good and easy to do. first time I got it :) will def keep this recipe."
"0","5","this was so goooooood"
"0","5","I followed the directions and they came out perfectly. I didn't need to use liners for the muffin tins, and the outer layer didn't crumble as others mentioned. The mini muffin tins yielded 24 total cookies, not sure where 40 came from.   Saved to my favorites."
"0","5","This is an absolutely awesome recipe !!! I made it according to directions exactly and it is superb. I made them for a neighbor for Christmas and she will be delighted. This is definitely a keeper....;-}"
"0","5","Full-proof recipe. Be sure to let the cookies remain in the pan till completely cooled or they might fall apart!"
"0","5","These are absolutely wonderful! I did however discover I did not own a mini muffin pan while making these, so I just made them into regular peanut butter cookies and topped them off with the reese's cups. The directions were spot on and they turned out great! (:"
"0","5","These cookies turned out amazing! Very easy and fun to bake with kids... definitely FREEZE the reese's cups before you put them in the cookies to prevent melting!"
"0","5","These are super easy to make and super delicious! I followed previous instructions and put the Peanut Butter cups in the freezer 1st and also waited about 8 minutes after they came out of the oven before pressing the Peanut Butter cups into the cookie. Glad I made these and will make them again!"
"0","5","I was worried they wouldn't come out of muffin pan easily but I was pleasantly surprised!!! Very tasty!!!!"
"0","5","These turned out fantastic and everyone was grabbing them right out of the pan when they cooled enough!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS! Very easy to make - I followed the directions exactly as listed, but did take the tip of freezing the pb cups ahead of time. I made a couple of batches, some with frozen cups and some room temp and it really didn't seem to make a difference. I think the important part is to push the cups in right away and quickly. LOVE these and will be making more! Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","I made these as part of my holiday baking just four days ago and I am already making another batch tomorrow per request of family AND coworkers! (They went FAST!) I followed the exact recipe and instructions as above and they turned out perfectly. Thanks BUCHKO!"
"0","4","Just finished baking a batch,haven't tasted them yet-but they smell awesome.Whether you press peanut butter cookies with a fork or press these cute little cups inside you will get a little cracking-it just makes them smell better!"
"0","5","These were a big hit with our big cookie baking!"
"0","5","My husband said these were the best cookies he ever tasted! I followed the directions exactly, with one addition: I put the cookies in the fridge after I put on the PB cup (while they were still in the pan). I put on the PB cup right after they came out of the oven and the cookies did crack, but I like them like that. They were still in one piece after I took them out of the muffin pan. Peanut butter chocolate heaven!"
"0","5","They are soooooooooooooo good and so addictive"
"0","5","Very good. Very sweet though! We put red and green colored sugar on top while the chocolate was still soft for Christmas theme."
"0","5","Made these for a cookie exchange. Doubled the recipe and froze the chocolates as someone suggested and they turned out amazing!! So quick and easy. I also took the cookies right out at 8min and it was perfect timing."
"0","5","These were so easy and delicious!! Will be making them often."
"0","4","These cookies are very good, though not quite special enough for 5 stars in my opinion. I made a few adjustments for my convection oven - baked the cookies at 360 for 5 minutes and they turned out just right. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used mini baking cups on a regular cookie sheet. I was able to bake my entire batch (50 cookies) at once and give the cookies a festive touch with pretty Christmas wrappers. Also made sure to freeze my peanut butter cups. These little cookies will make a nice addition to my cookie trays!"
"0","4","I have done this before and loved it. I do mine different. I use the package of peanut butter cookie mix. Follow the directions on. I think its 1 egg and water. Onced mixed take a spoonful and place into the mini cupcake pans. After baking while still hot take a mimi peanut butter cup in place in the center. These are good and not as much trouble."
"0","5","I make a similar recipe but instead of the mini-pb cup I just put about a teaspoon of milk choc chips in the hollow of the cookie and put a cookie sheet over top for a few minutes until they melt. Then, depending on how energetic I am, I might put in a dab of real PB and swirl it a bit with a sharp knife. Then a salted shelled peanut on the top lets consumers know that these are not a peanut-free treat. Since I pretty well always have choc chips on hand this treat is one I can easily whip up if I need a quick, sweet treat for something special. I have never found anyone who didn't love them."
"0","2","Okay I am not sure what went wrong here. I used a mixer to mix everything I'm not sure if that was bad. I followed the recipe but I used a regular muffin pan. Once they came out and I put the reese cup in them and tasted it after it cooled off it tasted very bland. Plus it just didn't seem right."
"0","5","These are amazing! I tried them for the first time about 2 years ago and now they are a must have on my Christmas Cookie list! A little challenging to remove from pan, so either remove them right away or wait for them to cool. I found that if you put the peanut butter cups in the freezer before you start baking the cookies, they don't melt as fast and you can remove from the tins alot easier."
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! I don't see how you can go wrong using this recipe. If you love peanut butter you'll definitely love this recipe."
"0","5","Holy cow. I made these for the first time tonight and they are awesome! Fairly simple too. I'll definitely be making these again."
"0","5","I've made these using Peanut butter cookie mix, shaped into 36 balls, inserted 1/2 of a snickers mini bar in each before baking. Top with pipped chocolate frosting when cooled and sprinkle with red/white/green jimmies for festive look. A must on my cookie platters."
"0","5","Awesome recipie!! I used the pre-packaged peanut butter cookie dough mix. It is by the cake mixes and you just add eggs and oil. They were very easy and turned out delicious! PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER after they come out of the oven. These were the hit at the work cookie exchange!"
"0","5","DO NOT MAKE THESE IF YOU ARE ON A DIET! They are so good that you can't stop once you start. I made four batches and they were gone in a day ( I did not eat all 144 cookies myself) Sooooo good."
"0","4","My husband loves peanute butter so he loves the cookies. Stuck to recipe completely."
"0","5","my family has made these for years and if you want a different twist try using the flavored kisses and insert them tip first. Chocolate cherry and peanut butter go great together. Make sure to use the little muffin pans. They make a big difference."
"0","5","I got this recipe off a bag of reese's cup.. PHENOMENAL. Seriously, do yourself a favor and make them. They are wonderful as is!"
"0","5","Yum! Easy recipe! My picky son enjoyed them. My cookies were flaky like shortbread but still good. Wished it could have been a bit chewy."
"0","5","These are wonderful!! Everyone I've made them for loves them!! Thanks for the recipe :)"
"0","4","Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out just like in the pictures. Very good, but I only got 2 dozen cookies. Could it be I ate too much of the cookie dough? Yum!"
"0","4","These tasted great,and were not hard to make. I would definitely recommend these to you"
"0","5","Excellent! I used Reese 'Minis' and they were perfect! A lot less work than having to unwrap each peanut butter cup, plus their size was a bit better suited to the size of the cookie."
"0","5","I give this recipe 5 stars. I didn't change any thing"
"0","5","I am a peanut butter cup lover and this recipe was fantastic! soft and chewy quick and easy to make what more could you ask for in a cookie!"
"0","4","easy, big hit!"
"0","5","Soo good didn't change a thing except froze peanut buttercups before pushing into cookies. Awesome"
"0","5","Instead of the peanut butter cups, I use chocolate chips and they are excellent!"
"0","5","the kids really loved these and so did my husband could not get enough"
"0","5","I made these tonight and so help me God they're the most delicious things ever!!!! I didn't have a muffin pan so I used the paper muffin cups instead. They helped hold them in shape nicely . I used the white chocolate peanut butter cups instead and it made a delicious sub foe the regulars. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making these again"
"0","5","I made these cookies for a party at my job. I had to make a whole new batch because my husband and his friends ate them all. Great and easy recipe!!"
"0","5","100% DELICIOUS! I tried out a batch for my husband (the ultimate cookie critic) and he LOVED this cookie! I then gave out a bunch to people at work and they all loved it too.. i then became so bold to make a batch for the holidays (where 20 family members were)... and they all loved it too! It's peanut buttery, sweet, but soft and wonderful!"
"0","5","So yummy and perfect for Christmas treats. Makes a peanut butter cup seem plain and boring on it's own now!"
"0","5","Try dark chocolate peanut butter cups!"
"0","5","My husband can't stop eating these, so yummy and easy!"
"0","5","Hubby LOVED them. He is a peanut butter fan. He said these were amazing."
"0","5","My favourite treat in the world! Always a crowd pleaser"
"0","5","outstanding, richly peanut buttery and chocolate goodness!"
"0","5","AWESOME cookies! Peanut butter and chocolate never tasted so good together! It's helpful if you have a large mini muffin pan with more than 12 dents. It helps to freeze the cups before and after you unwrap them. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly and they were perfect"
"0","4","we also use Pilsbury sugar cookie dough, for the cookie part. Great for halloween parties!!! :)"
"0","4","Very peanut buttery! Made them for my husband to take to work and he and all of his coworkers loved them."
"0","5","Just finished these on this cool and wet August day - figured great day to make cookies which did take a while. Using previous suggestions put dough in frig for about an hour, used the 2 teaspoons for balls, baked exactly 8 minutes, Reeses cups in right after taking out of the oven which I did freeze. Put in tray in freezer for about 5 minutes and then popped them out with edge of a butter knife - worked out fine. I did heavily spray tins with Pam not taking any chances. I am sure they won't last long around here. Excellent recipe - thanks."
"0","5","They were Delious! We didn't buy enough of the Resse's cups, so once we ran out, we scooped out a little of the middle of the cookie. We put Jelly on the center of some and Nutella in the others. The Jelly was the best out of all three!"
"0","5","I tried these and they are very good but too too sweet. I decided to try something different, so the next time I used the dough for Hershey's Peanut Blossoms. (These are the ones with the Hershey's Kiss on top of the ball of dough.) The recipe is the same except that the amount of peanut butter is 3/4 cup, and the white and brown sugars are 1/3 cup each. I used a small cookie scoop, leveled off and got 48 cookies this way. Using this less-sweet dough, these get 5 stars."
"0","5","Wow, just made these this afternoon and they are yummy...easy recipe to follow."
"0","5","So yummy! I've made them quite a few times and they are a hit every time!"
"0","5","My mom, sister and I made these, there were fantastic! Went very quickly, will for sure make these again. One thing is, defenitly want to refrigerate the dough a little as its a little sticky."
"0","5","very good! :)"
"0","5","Love, love, love!! Trying out new recipes for my holiday party and this one made the list!!! My kids and picky husband love them too!!"
"0","5","I made a 'custom' version of this recipe. I used a packaged cookie mix (Betty Crocker Peanut Butter Cookie Mix). I used my Pampered Chef small scoop and mini-tart shaper to press the cookie mix into the tin. I baked the cookies approximately 1/2 way and then removed from the oven and quickly inserted the Mini Reese’s Cups into each 'cookie' tartlet. I then returned to the oven and finished baking, making sure to not over brown the cookie itself. These were AMAZING and were devoured by everyone in my family. I am now working on making a custom version using other types of ingredients and combinations of ingredients."
"0","5","I made these for a bake sale & I even included the recipe. These are so easy & YUMMY!! I'm going to make another batch for the holidays to share with my family & friends!"
"0","5","Easy to make and yummy to eat!"
"0","5","Fantastic cookie!! Followed the recipe exactly as written. I did use the mini muffin pans with the paper liners and it definitely made it easier to remove from the pan and no worries about cracking. As the other reviewer's recommend, keep your candy in the fridge until your ready to insert them into the cookie. This one is a 5 star for sure!!"
"0","5","These aren't my very favorite, but I'll give them five stars because everyone who tries them always says, 'OhmyGod!! These are sooo good!' I made them.. sort of with the Reeses peanut butter hearts (not the giant chunky ones... the little ones that have to be unwrapped) for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day last year and he loved them. Instead of putting them in mini muffin tins, though, I proceeded like I was making peanut butter blossoms. Make sure you freeze the candy until just before you press them into the cookie. I also always pop these right into the fridge so that the candy doesn't spread too much during the meltimg process (when using flatter candies such as the hearts)"
"0","5","I found out that my folks needed me to bring something to the Thanksgiving dinner we have and was able to cook this up right quick. In about 45 minutes, I already had plenty enough and was on my way. And the cookies? Awesome."
"0","5","These are the best and so easy to make. My husband and sister law love them~~"
"0","5","Fantastic. Don't change a thing. Just make sure to unwrap and freeze the peanut butter cups prior to starting. These are a huge hit."
"0","5","These flew off my plate. Follow the recipe exactly and they will be a favorite at your party!"
"0","5","These were super good! You definitely have to be a peanut butter lover to enjoy these! I followed the instructions exactly and they turned out perfect!!!!"
"0","5","SOOOO good! That's all I have to say:-)"
"0","5","These are a HIT! The ONLY thing I changed was I use half the amount of baking soda and half the amount of salt.  I freezed 'Reese minis' before pressing them into the cookies and they already come unwrapped/60 to a pack and are perfect size. Everytime I make this recipe I have to double, triple, quadruple the recipe because they FLY out the door."
"0","5","Delicious everyone loved them!!"
"0","5","These are awesome!!! After making these at Christmas my 93 year old grandmother requested that for her birthday in August I just make her a batch of these. Crunchy peanut butter works well too."
"0","5","I made these cookies in regular sized cupcake tins because I don't own a mini muffin tin. Thus, I used more dough per cookie and had about 22-25 cookies. Instead of mini peanut butter cups, I used regular sized Reese's peanut butter cups. Delicious!"
"0","5","These were so good. We did both kisses in half and Peanut butter cups in the other half."
"0","3","These tasted good, but did not come out of the mini muffin tin well. I actually sprayed with cooking spray, and they still wanted to stick. Also fell apart when getting them out. The cookie was very crumbly and did not hold the candy in center well."
"0","5","These were awesome! I took them to my daughters Christmas party and they were one of the first to go! I followed the recipe exactly and when I make again (and I will...soon!) I won't change a thing!"
"0","5","Excellent cookie :) I made them tonight for work, and my family ate them so fast I had to make another batch - very simple and easy. I followed the written receipe, except used my cookie scooper to avoid having to roll balls; It made 30 cookies instead of 40, yet they are fantastic. I didn't adjust the cooking time. I'll make these again and again!"
"0","5","WOW is all I can say, I made this last year and eneded up making 6 bachtes b/c my husband kept taking them to work for all the guys to eat and they are begging for them again, didn't change anything, but did try with carmel cups this year, just as great."
"0","4","I put a little more peanut butter in them because i'm a PB lover but these worked very well with the PB cups and without. When not using PB cups I rolled in sugar and made the traditional criss-cross design with a fork. I also might try less flour and baking soda next time. Yummy"
"0","5","Always a hit when I make them!"
"0","5","These are so good!! I have made them a couple of times to take to parties, and they get gobbled up so fast, I never get to eat them!"
"0","5","delish!"
"0","5","Great, followed all steps, and they were perfect! Easy!"
"0","5","Depends on the quality of the ingredients... Generally speaking, very good base recipe."
"0","5","OMG made these last yr and they are so it is hard to stop and thought they were easy to make. I going to make these this year too."
"0","5","SCRUMPTIOUS. these are super easy to make, look professional & are divine. i froze my reeses cups, used a duck egg, organic milk & cooked for 9 minutes. i live at 2200 ft & this recipe is perfect. thanks for sharing."
"0","5","easy and fabulous~ my daughter has a peanut allergy so i'm going to try this with soy nut butter and hershey's kisses and see how it turns out! i will be making this recipe alot!!! thanks for sharing-"
"0","5","Really delicious cookies! Those are so easy to make and that's why they are great for baking with kids. I used the tip with the frozen Peanut Butter cups and they turned out perfect. I just didn't have a mini Muffin pan. This wasn't a big deal I just shaped the balls a little higher like kinda tower shape, which made them turn out not too flat. And even without the Peanut Butter cups those are yummy!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicous! Definitely put the peanut butter cups in freezer before pressing into cooked cookie. Cookies dont look cooked at 9 minutes but I listened and they were perfect. Recipe is great - dont need to change a thing. I didnt use a mini muffin tray and ended up having 24 cookies. Let the cookies cool for awhile even put the muffint tray in fridge to cool faster. Will make these again for sure!! Perfect for left over Halloween candy!! :)"
"0","5","These cookies are so good and easy considering how cute they are. The only thing I did differently was use grease (Pam). The first time I made them I used an ungreased muffin pan as it says and they would not come out of the pan. The 2nd time I used a greased pan and they came out perfectly. I let them cool in pan for about 10 mins."
"0","5","these are soooo yummy and very easy to make. the only trouble i had was getting them out of the pan after letting them cool without them falling apart or the peanut butter cups oozing everywhere. I figured out that putting them in the fridge for like 30 mins really helped :). Overall this recipe is an A+"
"0","5","These were pretty easy to make and yummy. I made some without freezing the peanut butter cups first and it was messy, left a fingerprint in the chocolate, so I froze them and it worked so much better. I also greased my pans slightly because the first batch was stuck. Also I left the cookies in the muffin tins and stuck in fridge for a few min. before removing. Very good recipe, kids loved them."
"0","5","Amazing. I make these all the time, best cookie I've had in, like, my entire life. I tend to accidentally make 'em bigger so I don't get exactly 40 cookies, but still amazing. Nomnomnom :)"
"0","5","Cookies turned out amazing... one of my favorite recipes"
"0","5","What a great cookie! They came out perfect. I really don't like having to unwrap each of those Peanut Butter Cups though but in the end t was worth it"
"0","3","They were pretty good. I'm not sure I would make them again but they were easy!"
"0","5","I baked a batch of the Peanut Butter Cup Cookies and send them to my grandson who is away at college and he and his roommates agreed that it is the best cookie they have ever eaten. Needless to say ' I am the best grandmother ever'!"
"0","5","These cookies were fun to make and taste delicious. I making more right now!!"
"0","5","Since I didn't have a mini muffin pan, I simply used a teaspoon to make the balls. The cookies turned out soft and delicious. I would make the cookies larger though, because after eating a couple the chocolate became overwhelming. I am never able to find a peanut butter cookie recipe that remains soft, and this one was amazing!"
"0","5","These are great. I prefer to bake homemade but when we are looking for a really fast treat I just use the refrigerated pb dough that comes in the log."
"0","5","These were delicious and so fun to make. Not as easy/fast as a simple drop cookie but well worth the effort. I made the recipe EXACTLY. Freezed the peanut butter cups as directed by other reviewers. The hardest part was figuring out how big the balls should be. I ended up with a lot of batter left over and had to go back and add to the smaller balls. The recipe made 38 for me as that's how many cups came in the Reese's bag I bought. Will definitely make a double batch next time but will recruit someone to help me unwrap cups."
"0","5","delicious!! everyone loves these cookies. just a few tips to make them flawless - use a mini cupcake pan, use mini cupcake wrappers, unwrap the PB cups beforehand and freeze them."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I made these and took them to school and I had them stolen from me! My mother and my boyfriend( my guinea pigs) decided they were heaven on earth."
"0","5","These couldn't be easier. The dough came out easy to roll into balls and baked up perfectly in the 8 minutes that the recipe called for. The hardest part of this recipe is waiting for the cookies to cool and harden to eat them. Wait until my Reese's loving daughter tries these."
"0","5","These were amazing and I agree with the other commenters - these cookies were gone with a blink of the eye! I omitted the milk because we didn't have any on hand, and used imitation vanilla since it was half the price. I considered buying Hershey Kisses instead of peanut butter cups, but I'm glad I shelled out the extra dough (har har) for the Reese's - they complement the cookie dough soooo well. I also used a cookie sheet instead of a muffin pan; the cookies were a bit more cracked than in the picture but still appetizing."
"0","5","I made these for Christmas last year they turned out AWESOME!! Best cookies ever!! My boyfriend said they must be made every Christmas now as a tradition. Followed the recipe EXACTLY and they turned out PERFECT! Thanks!!"
"0","5","These are requested at every work social that I attend!"
"0","5","These really are the best cookies ever. I cook them exactly 8 minutes and they turn out perfect."
"0","5","Easy and delicious!"
"0","5","These were fantastic and fun to make with my 6 year old son. Made the recipe 'as is.'"
"0","5","Great little cookie. I served these for a baby shower and people went crazy for them. Perfect little bite size cookie!!"
"0","5","I have no idea how the cookies taste....I bought a bag of pb cups put them in the freezer and took one here one there...now there isn't any left for my cookies...haha...I'll try again and get back with you all....LOL..right now I'm rating the chocolate and peanutbutter"
"0","5","AMAZING! My husband and I absolutely loved these! (My 2 year old did too...but we limited his intake of these because he was quite messy with them!) I bought a mini muffin pan just to make these and I'm glad I did....they're so cute! I also agree that when using the mini muffin pan 8 minutes is the magic amount of time to bake these. Absolutely delicious....will be making these again soon!"
"0","5","These were great! The dough was not too sweet, and the cookie stayed moist. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","OMG! These are the BEST cookies!! So easy to make and they turn out perfect everytime! I followed the recipe exactly, you don't need to change a thing! YUM!!"
"0","5","delicious"
"0","4","These are really good. I'm not sure they are special enough that I will be making them at Christmas or anything. (I have about 4 or 5 cookies that I always make during the holidays). I can't quit eating them today though! I will probably make these again, just not at Christmas! ;-)"
"0","5","these are so cute, easy, and delicious! Taste good with the dark chocolate and white chocolate reese's cups, too!"
"0","5","I made these for a pot luck at work this past week! They were a hit! I will definitely make these again! My fiance gobbled them up, and requested that I make them again, but not bring any to work! Thank you such a great recipe!"
"0","5","These were great, I didn't have any peanut butter cups so I used Reeses Pieces. One on top of each little muffin cup. They looked so adorable and tasted great too."
"0","5","Yum, Yum, Yum. I had to give them to the neighbors to stop eating them. I agree with everyone - freeze the peanut butter cups before you start and freeze the pan after the cookies are baked and you've placed the candies in."
"0","5","I love this recipe!!! Remember to take the peanut butter cups out while the cookies are in the oven, you'll want to press them in immediately. Popping them into the oven ASAP is a must, so have the shelf space ready ahead of time as well. I like to throw sprinkles on top to give it a little color. Great recipe!"
"0","4","These were pretty good and easy to make. I will definitely make these again. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't give me the 'OMG!' reaction."
"0","5","very good and VERY easy to make!"
"0","5","These cookies are great. I have made them over and over. My family and friends love them. I didn't change a thing. Remember to only cook 8 min. They may not look down but they are. Its now our family favorite."
"0","5","These are great! I made them for my Christmas gift baskets and everyone loved them, especially my husband. He had requested them since then but I told him he had to wait until next Christmas lol."
"0","5","I am making these now a I type a batch is in the oven. The first batch is out and cooled and already almost gone!! These taste wonderful. I made the cookie dough and refrigerated it for a few hours and I also put the peanut butter cups in the freezer for a few hours also. The only problem I am having is getting them out of the pan. I think next time I will grease the pan or use a silicone pan so the just pop out. Thanks so much!!"
"0","5","I have made these twice now...once for Christmas (I didn't bring any back home!), and I made them just because. They didn't last a day! My family and friends love them!"
"0","5","OMG! These are EVIL! They are so good. I think I inhaled 5 of them in 2 secs flat coming outta the oven! My husband loved them too. Not so sure they should be called cookies, tho. LOL. They look more like tarts! That aside, I did run out of Reese's Pnut butter cups because SOME one in my house (husband) got into the bag before I could stop him. SO I had to use chocolate kisses. Which were good too. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious!!"
"0","5","these cookies were amazing! my whole family said the recipe was great! yum!"
"0","5","I've made this numerous times and even thought i had ruined a batch when in fact they turned out just great! Definitely freeze the peanut butter cups prior to adding them. Soooo good!! :)"
"0","5","These were great! They were the first things to go. awesome recipe!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly and also put the candies in the fridge before hand and it worked out GREAT!"
"0","3","The cookies I made, while tasting OK, were dry and cracked when candy was pressed in. My thoughts are that it might be because I used organic peanut butter and it made the batter drier. The batter before rolling was very dry and would not stick together well. I would try again using something like Jif PB."
"0","5","These were very easy to make. Everyone loved them. If you like peanut butter try these."
"0","5","A favorite among my friends and coworkers. Recently described as 'to die for'. I used chocolate chips in the center this past time instead of peanut butter cups and i prefer this as the cookie itself is very sweet. Soft delicious cookies!"
"0","5","Watch out! People will gobble these up!!!!!"
"0","5","My first time making cookies from scratch and they came out very good! My husband and son loved them and they were easy."
"0","3","These definately weren't bad. They are easy to make and tasty but I'm giving three stars because it didn't have an 'oh my god' factor to me. The White Chocolate Macadamia Cranberry Dreams recipe on a/r has that factor in my opinion. I think the peanut butter cookie part washed out the effect of the peanut butter cup inserted in the middle. I think a sugar cookie base would have been better."
"0","5","Amazing. I've tried other peanut butter cup cookies and this peanut butter dough is superior to those. Everyone in my family loved, loved them."
"0","5","delicious! i used a bit more peanut butter in my batch because who can't use a little more peanut butter in life? husband had five right away! i do not have a mini muffin pan, so i just rolled into balls and baked them that way."
"0","5","best best best cookies ever."
"0","5","Super easy, everyone loved them. Followed recipe exactly."
"0","5","so so so so so so so good!"
"0","5","You can't go wrong with these cookies. I've made them dozens of times and they are always a hit. I've never used the mini muffin pan to shape them but they turn out just fine on a greased cookie sheet. Only problem I sometimes have is that the cookies will crack when you put the peanut butter cups in them. Despite this, if you wait until they cool they will not fall apart."
"0","5","Boyfriend loved them. With only 7 minutes to bake. Made it easy peasy."
"0","5","Everyone loved these-i took the advice and froze the pb cups first"
"0","5","Very tasty. I did have a hard time getting the peanut butter cup in the cookie but they were delicious."
"0","5","Unbelievable! I made the recipe exactly like instructed and they turned out incredible."
"0","5","SO SO easy to make and VERY yummy! it is very very sweet and rich though..i made it for my 11 year old and 15 year old, and they ate them ALL the first day! i could only handle the sweetness of one, but still very yummy!"
"0","5","I have made these three times and each time they have came out perfect. I freeze my PB Cups before I use them and it works wonderful. My family absolutely loves these cookies ~ great for all ages."
"0","4","Very easy to make! I don't have a mini muffin pan, so baked them on a cookie sheet. As a result, they came out flatter than they are supposed to and the peanut butter cups were a little too tall for them. Therefore, for my 2nd batch, I cut the bottoms off the cups and they fit perfectly! Also, as a little added touch, I melted milk chocolate chips and drizzled them over top of the cookies once cooled. Delicious!"
"0","4","These were very very good but for 5 stars I think my eyes should roll back in my head. Everyone loved these at my party though."
"0","5","Every time I make these cookies, it takes less time for them to disappear than it does to actually make them. Excellent cookies!!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe!! I used shortening instead of butter because I didn't have any butter. I also used a regular muffin tin because I didn't have a mini muffin tin. I baked them a few minutes longer, as they were a bit bigger. They turned out great!"
"0","5","Very good! Everyone loved them. I will make a double batch next time. Yummy"
"0","5","I made these for an all mens party last night and they went faster then anything else on the table!"
"0","5","These truly go fast and they are a great presentation cookie..."
"0","5","Awesome cookie and very easy to make! Make a double batch because it doesn't last long!"
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic! DO make sure you use mini-muffin tins for the correct shape and to make sure the cookie comes up to surround the candy properly. Also, DO freeze the peanut butter cups ahead of time. These were some of the best cookies we've ever made!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe and these cookies turned out great!"
"0","4","Good cookie that's easy to bake. Just make sure that you store them in an airtight container. I use parchment paper between the layers so they won't melt or become damaged. One perk for making these at Christmas time, I put them in the garage so that the chocolate will reset. An advantage of living in Northwest Ohio."
"0","4","KIDS AND EX-HUSBAND LOVED THESE AT CHRISTMAS. FOLLOWED ADVICE OF ANOTHER REVIEWER AND PLACE PB CUPS IN THE FREEZER TO MAKE THE PRESSING EASIER, GREAT IDEA."
"0","5","I made these for Christmas plates. They were a hit and turned out beautiful. I did freeze the pb cups before pressing them in the cookie (using the mini muffin pan) and immediately put the whole tray in the fridge. **Press the frozen pb cups FIRMLY in the cookies**"
"0","5","These are some of my favorite cookies. They're super easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","OMG - so good."
"0","5","all time favorite on the Christmas cookie tray!"
"0","5","My son could not stay out of them!"
"0","4","Delicious! I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and made thumbprints in the cookies before baking. For me, big mistake! My cookies were completely flat!"
"0","5","These were so good! I did unwrap and freeze the peanut butter cups and it worked great! I will have to double the recipe next time."
"0","5","Definitely a favorite, extremely easy to make. Didn't have a miny muffin pan, but it really made no difference... they still turned out great!"
"0","4","pb lovers dream"
"0","4","My co-workers liked these but I wasn't a fan.  They are certainly edible, just not all that special.  I would encourage anyone making this to use one of the smaller cookie/ice cream scoops (2 tsp); it's the perfect size.  Update:  I have misplaced my 2tsp cookie scoop so now I use my medium cookie scoop.  I then cut that in half, roll it and put it in the mini muffin tray.  The cookies are done in about 7 minutes.  Update 2:  I use my medium scoop to portion the cookies, remove about 1/3, roll and place in the muffin tin.  The cookies cook in 8 minutes."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. I used colorful mini cupcake wrappers and they made a great addition to holiday parties. They were so good I even made them for 3 different cookie exchanges and got raves after each one."
"0","5","Very good, my family loved them!"
"0","2","They taste delicious while they are warm, but after cooling off, they are not tasty at all. I love the idea and wonder how to make them taste better"
"0","5","awesome cookie."
"0","5","Delicious. Easy to make. Definitely use the muffin tins as making them on a cookie sheet will almost always ensure the cookies will crack!"
"0","3","Both my kids are huge peanut butter cup fans but I got mixed reviews on the cookies. One loved them and the other said they just tasted like peanut butter cups which I tend to agree with. I felt it was alot of work and there just wasnt enough of a contrast in taste between these and plain peanut butter cups. I took the other's advice and froze the peanut butter cups. I also waited a few minutes for the cookies to sink before inserting the peanut butter cups and had no issues with cracking. Perhaps it was my pan but I did have difficulty getting them out of the pan once cooled. Ruined several during the process."
"0","3","I'm not sure why but these turned out very dry... I only kept my first batch in the oven for 8 min. and my second batch for about 6 min..."
"0","5","My family LOVED these. This cookies were the star of our holiday cookie platters. As suggested by others, the timing is definitely correct, and I'd also suggest freezing the candy before placing them in the center of the cookie."
"0","5","I made these for Christmas this year and my family LOVED them! They were gone before dinner even started! I did use some of the reviews suggestions: I froze my PB cups before putting them in the cookie. I also did not use a mini muffin pan (because I don't have one) and they turned out just fine. Thanks for the great Recipe!"
"0","5","I'm not a big sweets eater but my man took one bite of these and started moaning so I knew they were good! My kids gorged on them then I took some to Xmas dinner and my fiances little brother was shoveling them down. Great recipe! I used a cookie sheet and it worked really well. So easy to make also!"
"0","5","Very good, everyone loved them! I did as others suggested and froze the peanut butter cups first. I think it's a good idea to cool these in the fridge so that the chocolate doesn't melt too much, but they taste best at room temperature (so that the peanut butter cup softens again)."
"0","4","I used more peanut butter (3/4 cup) and only needed to bake 7 minutes in my dark coated mini-muffin pan. With these changes, it was a 5 star cookie!"
"0","5","These were great, my son made them with me for everyone's Christmas present. They were super easy. I didn't have any problem with the cookies cracking and I followed the directions exactly. We did however put the muffin tin in the fridge to cool in between bakings because the chocolate melts and makes the cookies hard to remove."
"0","5","These cookies are awesome! I made them on Christmas eve for my finance and I and we were so impressed. They are very easy to make and are absolutely delicious. Best invention since the Reese Peanut Butter Cup smoore!"
"0","5","I have made these for years and they are alwasy a big hit. You can use your favorite peanut butter cookie recipe (personally I use the crisco recipe). The only thing I do different is to put a 'hole' in the cookie before baking. You can use your thumb or any other handy utensil. This will help keep your cookie from cracking when you put the peanut butter cup in. Your dough doesn't have to be firm enough to make a ball for this to work. Once they come out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes then remove from the pan. If you try to remove them too soon, they will break."
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful!! My kids absolutely love them!"
"0","5","If holiness could be a cookie, this would be the almighty of holiness. I followed the recipe precisely except that I didn't have a mini muffin tin, but I made little tin foil cups that worked just the same. I did have a little problem rolling them into balls at first, but if you let the batter sit just a little, then you can roll them. I used Smuckers Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter which, although it's supposed to be good for you, was like working with wet clay. I don't recommend it. But it did work out eventually. This is, by far, the best cookie I've ever tasted....and I've tasted a few!"
"0","5","Excellent, made them with a cookie scoop so they were all the same size and they came out a little larger than the recipe states. I didnt get as many, but they came out nice and uniform and I added some sprinkles to the warm chocolate. These also look nice in a mini cupocake paper. Definately a larger cookie. Loved it."
"0","5","I gained 5lbs. eating these last year..."
"0","5","Great recipe- enjoyed by all at our house and cookie exchange. Quick tip- Freeze candies for about an hour prior to using. Unwrap the candies while the cookies bake. They bake up well in candy wrappers."
"0","5","Very easy to make! I made the dough 2 days ahead and put it in the fridge. It turned out great, and everyone loved them at our party!"
"0","4","These turned out so yummy! The only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars is because I was not prepared for how much the cookies were going to crack when I put in the peanut butter cup - however, this was quickly remedied by just letting them sit in the fridge for a bit. In fact, I think they taste even better chilled! I used a dark Reese's cup and it was fantastic! Easy recipe to make, highly recommended!"
"0","4","Okay so I test the suggested way (put choc. cups in freezer) and I did a batch the regular way. I choose the latter. Putting the cups in freezer, only made the chocolates stay soft once it was room temp. and gooey. The chocolate looses its firmness once it's frozen. The second batch was must better (no freezer) I was able to pile them on top of each other on a platter not worrying about the melted chocolate. Other than that, it was a hit. Easy to make."
"0","5","These were so easy to make and everyone LOVED them!"
"0","3","I tried these this year since I normally make the ones with Hershey kisses and wanted to try something a little different. They are good but I like the ones with the kisses better. This is too much peanut butter at once - and I LOVE peanut butter."
"0","4","I also tried using the peanut butter cookies out of the bag to try and be a little faster, they were as good as the homemade ones."
"0","5","these are the best cookies ever! i brought these into school for a christmas party and my friend who doesnt even like resses cups loved these! i was getting compliments on them all day; from 'these cookies were like baked by jesus' to 'i was savoring this cookie in my throat for like an hour' and 'i didnt think it was possible for a human to bake something this delicious' these cookies were a hit!"
"0","5","Delicious! I froze the chocolate before put it in the cookie and then put the tray in the fridge to prevent the chocolate from melting. This cookies are amazing!"
"0","5","Exactly as promised. This one will go into my collection of tried and true! Thanks!"
"0","5","i made these for a party and they were a hit!! they loved how the cookie was a peanut butter cookie! this is a definant keeper! great finger food!"
"0","4","good recipe. followed directions as is. my family loved them. I did freeze the candy as some of the reviews suggest and that helped alot."
"0","5","I followed the recipe and made these for the first time for my my husband. He absolutely loved them and told me I should market these. I used the dark chocolate reeses peanut butter cups instead of the milk chocolate, which he thought were absolutely decicious!!!"
"0","4","These cookies are delicious and the kids love them. I made them just like the recipe and took the suggestion of making them in mini-muffin tins. The first attempt was a bit of a disaster getting them out of the pan. The second time I used mini muffin liners and that made all the difference in the world."
"0","5","Awesome and easy to make cookie! Irresistible!"
"0","5","they were pretty good. the only hard part was getting them out of the pan. and also the peanut butter cups melted after put them in..it took a lil while to hard back up."
"0","5","These are amazingly yummy!"
"0","4","These cookies are very easy to make! Mine turned out a little dry though. I will definitely make them again."
"0","5","Awesome!!!!!!"
"0","5","I made a bunch of different cookies as gifts for Christmas. These were my favorite and were the ones I got the most complements on from others. very delicious. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and put the candy in the freezer - helped a lot. thanks"
"0","5","These were yummy! I made exact recipe- my only tip is: Don't put too much in each ball- less is better!"
"0","5","wonderful recipe. came out just right."
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! I did chill the peanut butter cups before as suggested."
"0","3","If you don't have time to make peanutbutter cookies, use pre-made pkgd. referigated peanutbutter, or sugar cookie diugh. I have made these for years, and it will save you a lot of time, but if you are really Susie Homemaker, make the real thing."
"0","5","So easy and yummy too! I didn't have mini- muffin pans so I used just a plain old sheet pan- worked great (just didn't come out with the same shape. I also didin't have regular sugar, so Trader Joes Turbinado raw sugar and it worked great. I sprinkled a little sugar on top when the peanut butter cups were a little melted. I also used Trader joes extra mini peanutbutter, so some larger cookies I pushed a few insead of just one on each. Overall, such a cute-easy-tasty recipe! Fail proof!"
"0","5","omg, THESE ARE DEADLY ON YOUR HIPS! So SO SO good, amazing.. this is a recipe keeper!"
"0","4","I thought this was a great and simple recipe. I also did a batch with Hershey Kisses instead of peanut butter cups...both were a great hit!"
"0","5","I can't believe how easily this worked! They look exactly like the picture! I took the advice of others and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while the cookie baked and then put the pan in the fridge to let them cool before trying to plop them out. I expected the cookie batter to ooze up and out, all over my pan when I pushed the chocolate in, but they pressed down into it very nicely. My wife bought me a 24 count, non-stick, mini muffin pan just for this recipe and I think it saved me a little time and maybe some headache. Awesome, easy, delicious treat!"
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","Turned out great. Everyone liked these. Thank You, Carol"
"0","4","I'm not a peanut butter cookie fan so this review is from my husband and son. They both liked theookies but didn't think they were over-the -top delicious. I enjoyed the ease of making them. Probably won't make again until next Christmas. thanks for sharing."
"0","5","these cookies are amazing as evidenced by our sharpei mix that ate and entire dozen while they cooled in our cold garage...my husband loved them as well! easy and quick to make and a favorite of kids, husbands, and dogs! (the dog was ok)"
"0","5","So soft and delicious!"
"0","3","My family thought these cookies were too peanut buttery. They suggested using chocolate kisses instead..."
"0","4","The taste is definitely 5 stars, but I had such a time getting them out and I followed the directions exactly and let them cool for at least an hour. But I am definitely making them again next year for Christmas...maybe I just need newer tins? The taste is fabulous, they just don't look as pretty as the picture!"
"0","5","These are sooooo good and sooooo easy to make! I wouldn't change a thing! I made them for christmas last year and everybody loved them. I'm making them again this year."
"0","5","Excellent cookie, excellent recipe! My 10 year old son and I made a double batch and they turned out perfect! This is a new favorite recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! My guests lThey are moist, chewy and delicious! They are so cute, too. It was a great addition to my holiday baking!"
"0","5","WOW! These are the bomb!!!"
"0","5","WOW what a find, I can't make enough of these little gems. Merry Christmas to all!"
"0","5","This was a fun recipe to make, very easy too. I followed the recipe to exact, and they are wonderful! My son and husband loved them. I made them for a cookie exchange at work. I know they will be a big hit. I will for sure make these cookies again."
"0","4","Delicious recipe. However, when I tried to remove them from the pans my cookies stuck to the pans. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
"0","5","Love these! They are great right out of the oven! Thank you for such a great and easy recipe!"
"0","5","2 words....AWESOME......EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm a beginner baker and these were simply one of the easiest cookies I have ever made. Thank you sooooooo much for sharing!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","awesome...I prefer to buy the chocolate chip cookie dough from the store...tastes great."
"0","5","Fiance can't stop eating them! These cookies are very easy to make. As with previous reviews, be sure to put the PB cups in the freezer prior to putting them in the cookie. I placed the whole muffin pan on my snow covered deck to cool and they turned out perfectly!"
"0","5","This is excellent. Almost sinfully good. I will definitely make this again"
"0","5","I followed the advice of other reviewers and froze the PB cups before sticking them into the cookies, I also cooled the finished cookies in the refrigerator after they were done baking, 8 minutes was perfect."
"0","5","Delicious!!!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe and super easy! Loved by all!"
"0","5","I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and it is LOVED by everyone! I follow it exactly and they have always turned out perfect!"
"0","5","Delicious!! I made them for a work function and out of tons of other cookies, these were the first to disappear! Everyone kept telling me how delicious they were, even my husband who is not a peanut butter fan LOVED them. I didn't have any muffin tins so I rolled them into balls and put them on a normal cookie sheet. I cooked them 8 minutes, immediately moved them onto a big plate and put frozen reeses in center and then put them in the fridge until the next day. I had a few cracks, but who cares, they were sooo tasty!"
"0","5","I am not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but these were very good. I just formed the cookies into balls instead of using the muffin pan and they turned out fine. 8 minutes is definitely perfect- they looked a little under-cooked, but were the perfect consistency when cooled. I also unwrapped the reese's cups and kept them in the freezer until I was ready for them."
"0","5","This recipe is wonderful. For years my aunt would make these cookies and I would ask her for the recipe and she would never give it out, she claimed it was to hard for the average bake to make. This recipe is sso so so simple. I now make it for my family every year thanks!"
"0","4","These were delicious. I used a regular baking sheet because thats all I had. I would HIGHLY recomment putting the batter/dough in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes after mixing everything because it's much easier to roll the dough into balls when they are cooler (otherwise the peanut butter sticks to your hand and is rather hard to work with). Also, I used reduced fat peanut butter.. no one could tell the difference!"
"0","4","I always make mine with chocolate chip cookie dough (either store bought or homemade) for an extra chocolate boost :)"
"0","3","These are good, but the cookie part is too cake-like and the peanut butter cup tastes too burnt. But maybe putting the cups in the freezer beforehand will fix that."
"0","4","These were delicious..The only thing is that the peanut butter cups melted inside the cookie and took a couple hours to harden."
"0","4","Yummy! Very rich - of course, they're peanut butter cookies! - but yummy. My oven tends to run hot, especially with non stick bakeware, so I reduced by 25 degrees and increased cook time to 10 mins. They came out soft & golden - very nice! I also followed the advice to freeze peanut butter cups between batches and this really helped. I also used a small metal baby spoon to lift them out of my non stick trays and they came out just fine. Freeze or refrigerate after they're out of the pans to keep the peanut butter cups from completely losing their shape."
"0","4","A little too sweet. It looks beautiful, and tastes good on the first bite, yet after the initial bite, you can taste how calorie-full and sugary the dessert is."
"0","5","People loved these at Thanksgiving! They went so fast!"
"0","5","fabulous!"
"0","5","Freeze peanut butter candies before and after taking off wrapper. Refrigerate dough overnight before rolling into balls. Chill completed cookie before taking out of pan. Steve thought 1/2 candy would be good."
"0","5","Yummy! I was looking for something sweet to make tonight-- I already had some Pillsbury simply peanut butter cookie dough in the fridge and PB cups that I popped in the freezer. I halved each cookie (dough) and rolled into a ball, then placed in the mini muffin pan. Perfect size and so easy to make! I only made four cookies, but I'm eating them all!!! :)"
"0","4","I'm not sure exactly how to rate these because I don't like PB cookies. I made them for my hubby and kids and they seemed to enjoy them. I made them without the PB cup as regular cookies because my hubby doesn't like any centers in his PB cookies and they worked out well."
"0","5","SO CUTE!!! I made these for my husbands birthday. Everyone loved them. I followed some other members suggestions and froze the candy. Once the cookies were done in the oven I waited about five minutes for the centers to sink before adding the frozen candy to the center. It worked well. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","2","I didn't like these very much. They're an okay cookie like straight out of the oven but after they're just a little bit old they're just gross. i thought it was WAY too much peanut butter and that made it a difficult thing to eat rather than an enjoyable thing. other than that it was a VERY easy recipe to follow."
"0","5","Yummy! Even better when cooled the next morning! The cookie is crispy but soft, and once the peanut butter cup was no longer melted it went perfectly with the cookie. My kids and hubby loved these!"
"0","5","Delicious! I will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","SO GOOD & SO EASY!! Made and sent these home with my grandkids - my daughter wasn't happy about having them in the house---way too tempting! Also made a gluten free p.b. cookie and added the p.b. cup for one child - he loved them also! Thanks!"
"0","5","I made these with my seven year old son. He did most of the work! The cookies turned out DELICIOUS!!! We followed the directions exactly and everything was PERFECT!"
"0","4","very good cookies. My first batch I made too big, the second was perfect and the peanut butter cups sit just right in the center. Would make again for sure."
"0","4","Great recipe! I made several cookies for a sleepover weekend, and there hardly any left! One tip, as another reviewer noted, it is imperative that you freeze the unwrapped peanut butter cups prior to pressing them into the hot dough of the cookie."
"0","5","Very good. I let the cookies 'rest' until their centers were sunken a little. This did stop them from cracking when I put the reeses cup in them. Very yummy!"
"0","5","Had a house full of teenage boys yesterday, so I doubled the recipe. Radically under-estimated how many peanut butter cups that would require. I did still have a stash of hershey kisses. I unwrapped them and used two per cookie. One point down and then after it melted enough to be the glue, one point up. Recipe Box material."
"0","5","This recipe always gets rave reviews. If you need a super quick spin on this recipe, get the roll of store bought peanut butter dough in the refrigerated section and use that instead. So quick and it looks like you took a lot of time to make fancy cookies."
"0","3","I had a lot of trouble with this which may be my fault. I didn't have enough muffins holes in my mini muffin tin so I just put them on parchment like regular cookies. I didn't adjust the time (if I needed to) and the bottoms turned charred black. I had to throw them out, I was sad."
"0","4","Very good, but I thought the cookie layer (the outside) was too thick."
"0","5","sooo yummy! i put my cups in the freezer after unwrapping, worked like a charm. also, i used the smallest cookie scoop i have(just scooped right into the muffin tin, no rolling), and ended up with about 65 cookies."
"0","4","These cookies were really good! However, I didnt have a mini muffin tin so i just made balls and put the cups in the center of those."
"0","5","So good, everyone loves them. I like to add the white chocolate pb cups, they add a little extra yum."
"0","5","Amazing!!! Yes, definately freezed the PB cups first and 8 minute in the oven is just perfection. I also made these cookies with a chocolate cookie base and a mint cup centre, very festive."
"0","4","I liked these, but not as much as most other reviewers. There are other cookies I like much better. That being said, you really can't go wrong with a cookie that has a peanut butter cup in the centre! I made as written and cookies were done after exactly 8 minutes. Thanks to the other reviewers suggestions of freezing the PB cup before pressing them in the cookies. These would be really good to bring to parties as they look so pretty."
"0","5","These are 10 stars! Just finished baking mine and have already ate a few!! I unwrapped my peanut butter cups ahead of time and froze them. Then cooled the cookies in the fridge for 10 mins. I put mine in mini cupcake paper for easier removal from the pan. These are AWESOME! My kids new favorite!"
"0","5","super easy recipe and baking them for 8 minutes makes them perfectly chewy. you have to freeze the peanut butter cups AND i would recommend popping the cookie tray into the fridge for 5 quick mins after you put the peanut butter cups on the cookies (or else chocolate melts big time). be sure to serve milk with these!"
"0","5","This is an amazing cookie recipe!!! I do agree that freezing the peanut butter cups before placing them into the cookie makes this so easy. Plus, by doing this the cookie doesn't crack. Just wonderful!!!!"
"0","5","this is my new favorite cookie/dessert. i followed like others said and put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while the cookies cooked and then once i put them in the cookies i moved the whole tray to the fridge to cool for a while. i also placed mini paper muffin cups in the tray. that made it really easy to remove the cookies once they cooled."
"0","5","These cookies are awesome. They turned out just like the recipe."
"0","5","If your short on time, you can use an envelope/package peanut butter cookie mix, it tastes just as good and saves tons of time."
"0","5","I made these for a PTA Membership Teacher Luncheon and what a big hit! So many people asked for the recipe. They are easy peasy to make and super delish. I will be making these for many years to come. Thanks for the awesome recipe. I did take advice of others and froze the peanut butter cups and also cooled them in the fridge before putting them on the cooling rack."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! You can use just about any type of mini chocolate candies with this recipe...I also used Hershey kisses and chocolate covered cherries...will be making for the upcoming holidays!"
"0","5","These are perhaps the best peanut butter cookies our family has ever had. We keep them in the refrigerator but they don't last long. Awesome cookies!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Loved, loved, loved these cookies! Following the original recipe created a delectable treat. The only thing I did not have was a mini muffin pan, so I used a reg. cupcake (12 count) pan and they turned out beautiful. We will definetly make these again."
"0","4","These were very good. We also loved them without peanut butter cup. I just used a cookie sheet. I did not have a muffin pan."
"0","5","Perfect! So easy to make."
"0","5","I have made these at least three times now, they are so easy and delicious! My hubby and son both think they are one of the best cookies I make. I took them to work the first time I made them and everyone loved them but thought they looked too difficult to make themselves. I passed out the recipe and in a matter of a few days, some of the ladies were bringing them to work. ;0) I can't say enough about these cookies. Make them for your 'Cookie Monsters'."
"0","5","I made these for my boyfriend cuz I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter but I LOVED THEM! Can't get enough ... great recipe! Moist and delicious!"
"0","3","I'm going to try these again.. Perhaps I did something wrong - but they were dry."
"0","5","These cookies are GREAT! I made them for the first time today! My Dad loves these kind of cookies and he said they were his favorite. I defintley reccommend putting the cups in the freezer while you are making cookies. I don't like peanut butter cookies but these are great!! I'm so going to make them again! On my favorite list. Here goes another one!! HAHA"
"0","5","I have been making this recipe for years using pre-made cookie dough - usually chocolate chip. If you get the cookie dough squares that break apart, you generally just have to cut each square in half and drop them into the mini muffin cup. Bake according to directions on the cookie package - usually 10-12 minutes at 350 F. No, they are not made from scratch, but they are QUICK AND EASY. I keep the cookie dough squares and peanut butter cups in my freezer at all times - and I can whip them out in a jiffy when I am invited somewhere last minute or I know friends are coming over. They have been a HUGE hit everywhere I've ever gone... people will start begging you to bring them."
"0","5","Awesome and pretty easy. This is a keeper."
"0","5","This recipe is AWESOME! I made these cookies for my hubby who was coming home from his deployment, and HE WAS SURE HAPPY TO COME HOME TO THESE DELICIOUS COOKIES!! It's my family's favorite.. I also froze the candies for about 30 min before adding them. I baked them for 10 min, let cool for 1-2 min, and then added the candies. Delish! Tastes great w/peanut butter cups, kisses, or by itself! Very soft and yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","These were easy to make and are delicious! My whole family loves them."
"0","5","Not that this needs another rave review but I LOVE these! I ate way too many and way too fast so probably won't be making them very often because I had hardly any self control!"
"0","5","I get rave reviews every time I make these and they are SO easy! I experimented a little and also tried it with brownie mix and white chocolate peanut butter cups. Just make sure you put liners in the muffin pan for these. Thanks for a great idea!"
"0","5","Delicious! Made the recipe exactly as written, but froze the Reese cups as recommended, excellent idea!"
"0","4","the peanut butter cups were a bit rich for me. I went the old fashioned route and used hershey kisses. Nom nom!"
"0","5","I didn't even use a mini-muffin pan, just used regular cookie sheet and the turned out perfect. I suppose if you used a mini-muffin pan, they wouldn't be a 'flat.' I also doubled the vanilla (I love vanilla). Tastes great - definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Great recipe. I made it for my office and it was gone before I could have one for myself! Like the other reviewers suggested, freezing the peanut butter cups is a must."
"0","5","unbelivably delicious!! and oh so easy to make! I will freeze the peanut butter cups next time though - great suggestion!"
"0","5","Peanut butter and chocolate will always be one of the best mixes! I loved these as did everyone who devoured them. Do make sure you freeze the peanut butter cups so they don't get all melty when you are pressing them in. :)"
"0","5","so good! all said before, peanut butter cups should be frozen. 8-9 min is all that is needed; they seem undercooked/doughy but its fine and ready!"
"0","5","AWESOME! As my kids put it. Simple to make and yummy to eat. Too yummy if you ask me."
"0","5","wow!!! these were fantastic!! super easy to make and taste best warm. Loved them right out of the oven with the melted reeses pieces"
"0","3","I followed the recipe exactly...the cookies came out picture perfect and smelling wonderful. The reeses part tasted great but the cookie itself did not. It was just a bland cookie with a reese's cup in the middle...i dont think ill be making this recipe again, but i may try this same idea using different ingredients."
"0","5","This recipe was SO good and so easy! I'm not a very learned cook yet and it still turned out great. The only thing I would warn people about is to make the cookies big enough to fit the peanut butter cups! (I used a cookie sheet) My first batch out of the oven were WAY too small, I had a good laugh trying to put a peanut butter cup into one of them but the next batch turned out great and had everyone at our house raving! Very good, thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","My whole family loved these! These are one of the sofest/chewiest cookies I've eaten. The first time I made these, I had some mini reese's chips left over from Christmas (exactly like a peanut butter cup, but tiny). I made baby cookies with a tablespoon scoop, and baked on a cookie sheet. Whey they came out, I pressed 3-4 of the mini cups into the cookies. The second time, I used my girls' mini-cupcake silicone pan and followed the recipe exactly. Whew! That makes some fatty, soft, chewy little bites of goodness. Both ways worked great. Again, great flavor and texture in the recipe."
"0","5","Off the hook!! great recipe...used whole wheat flour and natural peanut butter...wanted to use up my dark chocolate kisses. used approx 2 tsp of dough for each drop and used cookie sheets. Just fab."
"0","5","Incredible! I've never made cookies that were so soft. Everyone raves about them!"
"0","5","These were great! I rolled them in sugar, baked them on a cookie sheet, and topped them with Hershey kisses! Great!"
"0","5","I just LOVED this reciie, probally the best peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted, defenitly a keeper. I made them for a party and every single person that tried one commented on them!!"
"0","4","These were great! The mini-muffin pan makes perfect little cookies"
"0","5","These are so yummy! I was craving peanut butter cookies and made these for my Superbowl party. I highly recommend freezing your peanut butter cups first. I took them from the freezer and squished them right into the hot-out-of-the-oven cookie and then put the whole tray in the fridge for about 15 minutes to set them. Definitely don't go over 8 minutes. Also, I doubled this recipe and made almost 90. I think my first tray was on the small side though. I wasn't sure what to expect. Because it made so many, I ran out of peanut butter cups. I had some Reese's peanut butter hearts for Valentine's though! I unwrapped those and squished them in my last tray of cookies. They are so cute! A definite must if you are making these for Valentine's Day :-)"
"0","5","Soooooooo good!! Used my favorite organice peanut butter and it came out wonderful. =)"
"0","5","All I can say is OH MY GOD!!! These are great!!"
"0","5","Yummy! I used all natural pb and made them as written and they turned out perfectly. Freezing the pb cups before using was a good tip. I baked them on a cookie sheet instead of muffin cups which didn't seem to make a difference except the recipe only yielded 25 cookies for me. Thanks!"
"0","5","Peanut butter cups are my son's favorite candy so I was so happy to find this cookie recipe so I could send him some in a birthday-Valentine care package. Hubby & I tried a few after they had cooled and absolutely loved these! I rolled the balls with damp hands, (after chilling the dough for probably 2 hours) and baked them right on parchment paper lined cookie sheets, as others had suggested, for exactly 8 min. Pushed the candies in immediately and let the cookies cool about 10 before moving them to a rack. They came out perfect! I love the way the cups continue to melt and get gooey as the cookies cool. My son is going to flip when he gets these - Thank you!!"
"0","5","I am not a huge peanut butter cup cookie fan, and even I have to admit that these were delicious. A hit!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I'd also recommend freezing the peanut butter cups before pressing them in. Thanks for another great recipe :o)"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome! I made it for the first time last week and people loved it so much that I've made it two more times already!! It's really easy and the whole process only takes around 30 minutes. Plus I have found the 8 minutes they take to cook is the perfect amount of time to unwrap the Reese's."
"0","5","Fabulous! I couldn't find my mini muffin pan, so I used a regular size pan. Still delicious."
"0","5","These are a major hit and get gone quickly!"
"0","5","These were great. I made them with my eight year old. He did all the work. Ours turned out to be, like really good peanut butter cookies. Totally worth the time on a cold New England day."
"0","5","Awesome!!! First cookies off the Christmas cookie platter and asked if I had anymore tucked away. Thanks for the perfect recipe!!"
"0","5","Was yummy! Big hit at the office and with the kiddies! Thank you :)"
"0","3","I make a huge cookie tray for Christmas. These did not seem to go quickly, which considering the ingredients, I find unusual. I get raves of my cookes, but these didn't seem to be too popular. I followed the directions and didn't change anything. I wouldn't do again."
"0","5","Very good and very easy to make. I will make these again."
"0","5","This recipe is great. I've never even used the recipe with the pb cups. First I used hershey's kisses, and they were delicious. Then I just tried it without any chocolates, since I don't have any and criss-cross them. Those also turned out great."
"0","5","Very good. Everyone loved them!"
"0","5","AMAZING!! =D"
"0","5","These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they are the best I've made! Mine are usually they are a little dry and crumbly, but not anymore!"
"0","5","Awesome, gooey, yummy."
"0","5","These are the most delicious cookies I have ever made! They are very simple, and I give them to friends at Christmas. My friends rave about them. I used to make buckeyes every Christmas, but these are MUCH easier and just as popular!"
"0","5","These were a huge hit!! They went so fast it was crazy. My only suggestion is to bake them a little longer than 8 minutes. One reviewer said it doesnt look like their done but they are. Well, I would bake them till they are a little golden around the edges."
"0","5","I made these for the first time over the holidays and they were a huge hit! I may have myself a new favorite cookie!"
"0","4","These are really sweet - you only need a couple to satisfy a sweet tooth (although some people in the house couldn't stop eating them!)"
"0","5","Excellent."
"0","5","These are great (delicious, pretty, and easy). I followed the advice of other reviewers and froze the pb cups for about 30. The cookies won't look done after 8 minutes but they are."
"0","5","I had about 10 cookies left and I ran out of peanut butter cups, so I substituted with Hershey's kisses and both turned out great."
"0","5","This recipe ROCKS! I won best tasting cookie at our cookie exchange with this."
"0","4","These cookies were so highly rated that I decided to make them Christmas Eve (for Santa). Mrs. Siggs Snickerdoodles (from this site) have been our traditional cookie for many years. Although the taste was good, my true test of a recipe is how long they last. Our Snickerdoodles are gone within a couple of hours of coming out of the oven. It is now Dec 30th, and I still have half of this recipe in a ziplok on my counter."
"0","5","OMG! These are amazing. I'm an awful cook/baker but I had these cookies probably 15 years ago and have always thought about them when I wanted some homemade cookies. I was tricked into baking for the holidays at a cookie making party and everyone loved them. I made half of the batch with peanut butter cups and the other half with both regular milk chocolate and peanut Hershey's Kisses. So simple, so quick!"
"0","5","great recipe. definatly freeze the reeses before you put them in the cookie and be sure to use a cupcake tin and as soon as the cookies come out push the peanutbuter up in the middle. let them cool complelty because the cup will melt if you move them to soon!"
"0","5","Follow this recipe exactly. It is fantastic. No need for any changes. I made one batch today to give away, but my family ate so many, that I ended up making another batch. It works best if your peanut butter cups are frozen first."
"0","3","This recipe was good, but tooo Sweet. I know that sounds strange, but I had a hard time eating them. I have always thought that was wierd when other people said it, but now I know what they mean. The only problem I had was getting them out of the pan. They were so soft, they started breaking. Baking them in mini muffin cups would solve that problem. My family liked them OK, but they certainly were not the first cookie gone from the selection of cookies I made. I probably will not make them again."
"0","5","Very good cookie, was a huge hit at my house."
"0","5","Very good peanut butter cookie recipe, everyone enjoyed. I like the peanut butter cup center and agree to refridgerate peanut butter cups before using."
"0","5","Kept As Is. Made them both on a cookie sheet and in a mini-muffin pan. Our family was split down the middle on which was better, so both are GREAT!"
"0","5","Been doing these for a couple years. Followed the recipe as written and they are perfect!! A big hit every holiday!"
"0","5","I love peanut butter cookies and this is my favorite recipe. I've made the past 2 years for the holidays and everyone loves them. My mom just asked me for the recipe the other night and is making them for Xmas. Thanks"
"0","4","Made these exactly as directed. Tasted Great. But i did not have a mini muffin pan used a normal size. Some of the cookies did crack on the edges... but for the most part this is a great super super sweet cookie. Have a glass of milk handy!"
"0","5","I didn't change a thing about this recipe and they turned out perfect and made exactly 40 cookies! yum yum yum!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe as is. I didn't have a mini-muffin pan, so I used a reg muffin pan and made 30 slightly larger balls instead of forty smaller ones. In fact, i used a small quick-release ice cream scoop to scoop out the cookie dough into the muffin pan...quick and easy. the muffin pan really does help the cookie retain its shape when you push a pnut butter cup into it. YUMMY YUMMY!"
"0","5","These were amazing! My boyfriend and I gobbled up an obscene amount in one evening."
"0","5","Cookies are excellent but I had a hard time getting them out of a nonstick muffin pan."
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic!! I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out great. I did follow suggestions to unwrap and freeze the peanut butter cups before placing them in the cookies."
"0","5","Let me begin by saying, I wasn't expecting much of this cookie recipe. I always hated the normal version with the kisses becauses it is just soooo dry. This cookie was perfectly moist, incredible peanut buttery goodness and so easy to make.  I made several other cookies for the holidays, and this one seemed to go the fastest."
"0","5","Delicious! I didn't change a thing and they came out great. Wonderful recipe."
"0","5","These are WONDERFUL...I chilled my dough overnight and made a double batch because my son LOVES peanut butter...I used a cookie scooper (makes one inch balls and GREAT for baking cookies)...also froze mini peanut butter cups as was suggested by others...after baking insert mini peanut butter cups in each cookie...then let the cookies COOL THOROUGHLY and then gently twist cookies out of their mini muffin cups. Thanks for sharing this recipe..it is a definite keeper and I absolutely will make these again."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious and come out looking perfect. I followed the recipe and used the suggestions of freezing the candies before inserting them into the cookie. I put these cookies in decorated jars and gave them out as holiday gifts."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious and look just beautiful when made in the mini-muffin pan. I realized I needed that pan after already starting the cookies and had to bake them a dozen at a time since I only had one pan (I had to make four dozen for a cookie swap). It was worth it though as they look gorgeous and they are delicious too."
"0","5","I made these three different ways. I put some on a cookie sheet, some in mini baking cups, and also in the muffin tins (as recipe states). I personally thought the ones in the decorative baking cups looked the most festive if you are making them for the holidays. I also put some Hershey Kisses in some of them as well. They came out great!"
"0","5","These a quick and easy. Definitely make sure to freeze the cups before topping."
"0","5","These are a wonderful cookie! The dough is good enough to stand on it's own as a plain peanut butter cookie. I had more dough than peanut butter cups, so I made some with an unwrapped caramel in the center instead, and if you are looking for something a LITTLE less rich, that turned out tasty as well. I made a batch to put on my Christmas cookie trays that I give out, and I'll have to make more, as these were eaten up! Delicious!"
"0","5","I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical about these cookies, but they're all good, trust me!! I made them on a cookie sheet and used the peanut butter cup bites instead of the miniatures and they turned out perfectly. These are a nice peanut butter cookie, moist and subtle in flavour. Definitely going to add these to my repertoire. Thanks :)"
"0","5","super soft and so yummy!! my hubby's new favorite cookies! thanks for sharing"
"0","5","Wow, wow, wow! Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (plus, froze the chocolates like everyone recommended). I made them for my husband's Christmas party at work and they were a HUGE HIT!"
"0","5","Very good, I left in just a few seconds shorter then recommended!! Loved them"
"0","5","Super good! I didn't have a mini muffin tin, so I just made these on my cookie sheet and they were still great! We were the last to show up for our Christmas this weekend, so these were the last to be set on the buffet of food that everyone had been grazing on all day...but they were the FIRST to disappear. HUGE hit!!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing,we loved them.. I followed the recipe exactly,and took the advice from others to freeze the peanut butter cups,they turned out perfect and were so easy to make... thank-you for this great recipe!!"
"0","5","short on time? buy premade cookie dough that you just have to cut, or that comes individually cut, bake the cookies, and while they are cooling, place a mini peanut butter cup in the center. I made these cookies in 20 minutes for a last minute gathering and they were a hit. Plus, when you place the mini cups in while the cookies are really warm, they melt into the cookie, looking less like a cup you added, but more like a part of the cookie!!!"
"0","5","Took some out at 7 minutes and they were good. This recipe is perfect!"
"0","5","Very delicious and very easy! I used honey peanut butter, yumm!"
"0","5","I tried to use the mini muffin pan and had a little diffculty taking them out of it, however - just made tiny balls of dough and put them in a big muffin pan - worked perfectly! Poured some colored sugar over top before baking for a festive look.  SO DELICIOUS!!! these are by far my favorite cookie of all time."
"0","5","DELISH!! I made them exactly as written and they came out perfect! Saved to my recipe box so I can make them over and over again!! Thanks for this recipe!! 9/7: Made these once again and unfortunately 'somebody' snuck off with my PB cups, LOL. I went ahead and put the little balls in the tin and baked them, tastes like PB cookies to me! Delish Again!"
"0","5","I made these cookies for work and what a hit. Now they want me to make them all the time. Thankyou for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","Amazing!! Everyone loved them!"
"0","5","lOVED them. Not only tasted great but hubby thought they looked as though they came from a bakery. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","These are fantastic - and the kids loved helping! I tried with smooth peanut butter and with crunchy peanut butter. They were great either way."
"0","5","My 17 year old son gave it two thumbs up. I made two changes; added mini chocolate chips to the batter and rolled the cookie dough in sugar before putting it in the muffin tins. I'll be make these again soon."
"0","4","Hubby didn't care for these cookies, he preferred the ones with chocolate kisses. I think they are really tasty."
"0","5","I just made them last night. I brought them into work this morning and they were gone within an hour! They are very sweet cookies... pure sugar!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious!!! I made them for the first time today for a cookie exchange, but I think I'm going to have to make another batch because my husband can't stop eating them! I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except I froze the peanut butter cups first and after adding them to the cookies, I put them in the refrigerator to cool. Even though I live in a high altitude climate they turned out perfect! The recipe made exactly 40 cookies. I highly recommend this easy, delicious recipe!"
"0","5","So good! Great recipe and easy to make."
"0","5","Although I've been using All Recipes for years now, this is my very first review ever...and I reserved it for this recipe. These cookies are AMAZING!!! These will be our annual Christmas cookies (this is the second year so far). They are a melt-in-you-mouth sensation, and perfect for peanut butter lovers!   ***Side note: I unwrapped the Reese's and stuck them in a bowl in the fridge. When I removed the cookies (I used a mini muffin pan), I pulled out the candies, stuck them inside the cookies, and stuck the tray of cookies in the freezer for a minute to prevent unnecessary melting of the chocolate. Everything worked out beautifully!"
"0","5","EVERYONE loved these over Thanksgiving. I don't know where I've been, but I had never heard of them. They are sooo rich with all the PB, but very good when you crave that PB/choc connection. Will definitely make several times over the holiday season."
"0","5","Wow! Very good, diet watch out! ;)"
"0","5","Excellent recipe, I forgot to add the milk, but, not sure it made a huge differance?   I also did not have a mini muffin pan, so I balled them up by hand (like making buckeyes) and baked them....I placed the reese cups in and let them melt a little so they would sink into the cookie a little bit, then I stuck them in the freezer. Will definitely make again!"
"0","4","Maybe I made them way too big, but I only had enough dough for 25 cookies. The cookies themselves tasted fantastic... HUGE fan of peanut butter and peanut butter cups! I doubled the amount of vanilla, but kept everything else them same."
"0","5","I make these every year for holidays because everyone loves them. Also, I use tart pans and buy the mini holiday liners to avoid greasing and mess! They are always a hit!"
"0","5","excellent cookies! Made these for a party and they disappeared quickly."
"0","5","Fattening, but mmm, mmm, good. They didn't seem to last long at the party."
"0","5","I wanted to find a delicious peanut butter cookie recipe, and this did the trick! The cookies are great- I used a cookie sheet, and they turned out fabulous. We are enjoying this recipe as we speak- I doubt they last four days!  Note: The recipe made 26 cookies, probably because I didn't measure the cookie dough balls perfectly."
"0","5","Everybody loved these! I did put the reeses in the freezer as well. Perfect as is."
"0","5","amazing cookies!"
"0","5","Excellent cookies! Very sweet, so if you don't like rich food, this recipe isn't for you. My husband loves peanut butter, so this is a keeper. They turned out perfect and did not lose there shape. Take the advice of everyone else and refridgerate the peanut butter cups before inserting them into the dough."
"0","5","These turned out great I will make again."
"0","5","These were easy to make and all my friends and family love them."
"0","5","Great recipe. Best peanut butter cookie I've ever had."
"0","4","These cookies were fabulous! Made these for a party and got rave reviews. Definitely freeze the pb cups the day before baking the cookies. While their in the oven, unwrap them and pop them in as soon as they come out. I slowly pressed them into the center of the cookie while still in the mini muffin pan and had no problem with cracking. I then put the whole pan in the freezer so the chocolate wouldn't melt. Enjoy!!"
"0","5","I used this recipe for the first time I made cookies ever. It turned out to be very easy and the result was delicious. I replaced the peanut butter cups with mini milk chocolates."
"0","5","So Yummy!! The cookies themselves were perfect, soft in the middle and a little crisp on the outside. But the peanut butter cups made it so perfect. My husband who does not have a sweet tooth, ate like five after dinner, some before bed, and asked me to send some to work for him and his co workers. Will make this often!!"
"0","5","How could one go wrong with peanut butter cups? I added sprinkles to the top similarly to one of the photos of this recipe. Very cute!"
"0","5","Wow! No one can mess these up- super easy and super yummy! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","My roommate made theses and they are fabulous!"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Delicious cookies! I made these for family and they loved them! They taste even better frozen. They are a little on the sweet side though so I may lessen the sugar the next time around."
"0","4","I think that this recipe is very creative, I tryed it, they are SO good!!"
"0","5","This is a delicious recipe! I did not have a mini-muffin tray so just used a cookie sheet and formed dough into balls. The key to this recipe, as other reviewers have stated, is to chill the cookie dough for at least an hour as well as freeze the candy. Once the cookies came out of the oven, I placed the candy on top and placed the entire cookie sheet in the fridge. Chilled the cookies for about 10-minutes before placing them on a plate. I think this helped prevent the candy from melting. These were very good cookies and I will make them again."
"0","5","My roommate made these (and I can comment b/c I tasted them!) last night, and they were wonderful. She used whole wheat flour to replace the all-purpose. As she pulled out the cookies, to speed up the cooling process, she placed the muffin tin in the refrigerator since we only had one to use."
"0","5","I MADE THESE GLUTEN FREE AS WELL AS EGG FREE!!! They were very yummy, everyone loved them! Check out some pics at chariscreations.blogspot.com"
"0","5","Love it! So good and way cute in little muffin tins."
"0","5","These cookies were really good! I already have a few people wanting me to make them again I made them 3 days ago!"
"0","5","My family has a variation on this recipe. Place 12 balls of cookie dough on a cookie sheet. Press each one with a fork in a criss-cross motion so they're just slightly flattened. After baking (8 minutes was a bit underdone--I might go 10) press a chocolate star in the center. Chocolate stars are about the same size as a Hershey's kiss except more decorative, and are found in the candy aisle of any grocery store."
"0","5","MMMM, so good! Good luck keeping these around, they disappear fast!"
"0","5","This is seriously one of the best cookie recipes ever. My husband and I could NOT stop eating them. They freeze beautifully and don't take long to thaw. Definitely freeze the peanut butter cups before sticking them in the hot cookies. Thanks for the fantastic recipe....and for the extra couple of pounds on my hips."
"0","5","These cookies are awesome! I've made similar cookies with kisses, but these were way better. The peanut butter in the dough really compliments the peanut butter cup.   Patting the dough into the mini-muffin tin makes for really presentable cookies...they're cute.  My only advice is to start by doubling the recipe. Forty cookies seems like a lot, but these are gone in a flash."
"0","5","Yum Yum! The only thing I did different is that I did not find the right size peanut butter cups. I improvised with larger cups and simply cut them into pieces. It tasted just as good. I also took all of your advise about having the peanut butter cups out of their rapping and ready to drop on top of the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven.... That was good advice as the heat melted the peanut butter cups with ease."
"0","5","Kids love these cookies."
"0","5","These were excellent. The only change that I made was to use 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose. These are a keeper."
"0","5","I am not a huge peanut butter fan, but after tasting these I am! They are sooo good and really easy to make. I followed the directions exactly and took the advice of others to put the peanut butter cups in the freezer-worked like a charm. This is the best cookie recipe I have ever made and will be making them often!"
"0","3","I followed recipe to a T. The only thing is that the pb cups melt when you put them in the cookies. It took hours for them to harden back up. Did this happen to anyone else? Also i cooked 8 minutes and the middle still looks raw but when i tasted it, it seemed cooked."
"0","5","rich and very sweet but my son scarfed them down"
"0","5","AMAZING! I have been wanting to make these for a while now but have been hesitant. I made a recipe somewhat like this one years ago that was not very good. I shouldn't have been comparing apples to oranges because this one is GREAT! My husband said these are addictive and we agreed this recipe will be around for a long time even if the cookies are not! LOL!"
"0","5","Made for a picnic and people couldn't eat just one. Wonderful!!"
"0","5","Yes, these cookies are really that good. The best I have ever tasted. I made some with and without peanut butter cups. They were equally fought over. The only thing I didn't like was that the cookies have to cool in the pan before you can take them out and make more (as I only have a pan for 18 cookies). Than that these were easy and delish."
"0","5","I live in Denver so the high altitude can sometimes be an issue. However, I followed the recipe accordingly and these cookies turned out perfect!! I've gotten nothing but compliments on them. As others have suggested, I would recommend putting the peanut butter cups in the freezer before you press them into the cookie and also refrigerating the dough for a little bit (I did about 20-30 minutes). These are excellant!!!"
"0","5","Very good and very fattening, lol. I froze the mini peanut butter reese and everything turned out perfect. I ate 3 only and the rest was gobbled up by friends."
"0","5","I didn't even realize that when you bit into this cookie the peanut butter in the peanut butter cup will just come melting out into your mouth!! HEAVENLY!!"
"0","3","I have made a similar recipe to this one before and like it much better. This cookie really lacks any peanut butter flavor. I did appreciate the advice about freezing the peanut butter cups, though. That really helped."
"0","4","I wasn't too crazy about these cookies, although I know I am in the minority. I gave the recipe 4 stars because the people at the party I took them to said they were good. They were very easy to make, if you refrigerate the dough and freeze the cups before baking."
"0","5","OMG, These cookies are absolutly awesome!! They smell great and taste just as good. My husband said, 'where did you get these?', when I told him I made them, he said these are good."
"0","4","These were alittle dry but the peanut butter cup on top saved it. Also added additional peanut butter as others had suggested and freezing the cups ahead of time helped tremendously."
"0","5","amazing!"
"0","5","These were gobbled up at my 4th of July party. I used half white sugar, half turbinado. Since I used organic PB (which is less creamy than other peanut butter), I found that I should have probably added more milk.   Thank you to the person who suggested unwrapping and freezing the peanut butter cups!"
"0","5","Delicious, everyone in the office gobbled them up. I baked them for 9 or 10 minutes, instead of 8. The idea to freeze the peanut butter cups first is genius, I wish I had read that. Still, had no problem with the original recipe."
"0","5","YUM"
"0","5","Love it!! Just be sure to freeze your candies."
"0","5","made them as gifts of appreciation, and they were great! really easy to make and not a lot of time required. would definitely suggest freezing the peanut butter cups beforehand. enjoy! :)"
"0","4","YUMMY! These were soo good! In case you are wondering like I was before I made these- use creamy peanut butter, not chunky. I almost used it out of laziness but was so grateful I grabbed some creamy just in case at the store, I can't imagine what these would taste like with chunks of peanuts in them. Anyway, these are delicious and are very small but rich, so I couldn't eat too many at once but my boyfriend sure could! I will definitely make these again. I give this recipe 4 stars because they are sooo rich (sweet), or else I'd give it a 5. :) Thanks again!"
"0","5","I made this recipe last Sept., but that recipe had a photo showing the cookies with mini chip morsels in the cookie, but the chips were not mentioned in the recipe. I mixed the mini morsels in and they were better looking cookies."
"0","5","I was afraid that these might stick to my mini muffin tins (they are not the best) so I cooked them on a cookie sheet. They came out beautifully and were so YUMMY!!!!"
"0","5","Delicious!!"
"0","5","Yum Yum!!! Thanks for the idea!"
"0","5","Always good! I've made this recipe a few times now and it's loved by everyone."
"0","5","Very good and surprisingly easy!"
"0","4","YUMMY! However, they were not nearly as good the next day."
"0","5","Yum, yum, yum!"
"0","5","Fantastic and very easy! I was surprised at how well they've gone over with everyone (me too!). Will definately make again."
"0","4","I made this recipe for my co-workers last week and they loved it! I made sure to pat the dough down into the mini-muffin pan to avoid cookies being too muffin-looking. I will certainly make these again!"
"0","5","What an awesome idea to add reese cups to the cookies. They were excellent and we plan to make them again. My 4 yr old son and 2 yr old daughter helped me make them and they were still awesome!!!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! Thanks!"
"0","4","Fun recipe and everyone loved them."
"0","5","Followed the directions exactly and they turned out magnificent! :)"
"0","4","I made this for my family and coworkers, and it was very good. Some stated it was a bit sweet, so I'll probably add less sugar next time. You definately need a glass of cold milk to wash it down. My peanut butter loving aunt ate 3 in one sitting!"
"0","5","These were very, very good. My hubby came up and commented that I should make these more often...agreed!"
"0","5","These were easy and awesome!"
"0","4","I made these and found that they were not that much better than the peanutbuter cookies with the Hershey's kiss. They were a bit richer though."
"0","5","So my husband really likes the combination peanut butter and chocolate (who doesn't??!),found this recipe and it was a SMASH hit with him, so I took them to test level two..'the office'...every one LOVED them!! This was the most requested recipe in the office all year...however they wouldn't take it for our Wellness Programs cook book...."
"0","5","The only problem with these cookies is that I can't bake anything else without someone asking why I didn't make these instead! These are dangerously good."
"0","5","I don't eat peanut butter so I can't personally say if these are good, but everybody who ate them really loved them, so i would say they are top notch. I had to put in fridge for about an hour to cool them before I took out of pans. The mini muffin pans worked well and they made a nice presentation. Will make again."
"0","4","These cookies have really good flavor. I did spray my mini muffin tins with pam, just to be on the safe side. My only complaint is that the baking time isn't nearly enough, in my opinion. At 8 minutes, they're pretty much raw at the bottom, and fell apart when taking them out of the tins (but they didn't stick,lol) I got exactly 2 dozen from this recipe. I will try them again, and bake longer."
"0","4","These are a nice twist to the traditional peanut butter cookie. I think they would be a good cookie to take to one of those holiday cookie exchange parties because they handle well without crumbling."
"0","4","Very good and most people like"
"0","5","These are delicious and easy!"
"0","5","How can you go wrong with this recipe? These are DELICIOUS little bites of heaven. The cookie dough is really terrific, I think it would be great on its own. My one recommendation, I don't like underdone cookies so I ended up cooking mine for about 15 minutes. The first batch I cooked for 8 minutes ended up being very undercooked when you bit into it. Also, do freeze the Reese's cups, as someone else suggested. This makes it easy to really plunge the cups into the cookies straight out of the oven. GREAT RECIPE, will definitely make over and over again."
"0","5","I love using this recipe whenever my family entertains guests because the cookies are easy to make yet look very professional. Not to mention they taste delicious. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!"
"0","5","awesome!!"
"0","5","This was an HIT with my family! It is so easy and fun for the whole family to make."
"0","5","This is a good recipe, but I cheat a little and buy the prepackaged peanut butter cookie mix make that when short on time. I put rolled dough in mini muffin tins and bake. After I put the candies in, I place in fridge to firm up. SO YUMMY!!! Make sure you double the recipe. They go fast!!"
"0","5","Oh, they are perfect. Froze the candy and used mini muffin pans and mini muffin cups. Took some to work, everyone loved them... thanks!"
"0","5","Wow. Just wow!"
"0","5","Always a hit"
"0","5","Always excellent. I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I used margarine instead of butter and I used cartoned eggs instead of a shelled one. :) One batch made 36 cookies for me. After cooking for 8 minutes, I popped the peanut butter cups onto the cookies and stuck the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes. This made it easy to gently pry them out of the pan with a knife! Oh, and the bag of of peanut butter cups I bought had 40 cups in it. :) Awesome recipe, Buchko!"
"0","5","What an incredible little cookie. Who wouldn't love these! These cookies are the first off of the assortment tray at work and an absolute family favorite. Long live peanut butter and chocolate!"
"0","5","I have been making these cookies for a number of years now. They are great for bake sales because they package up so nicely and make a nice presentation. Usually one of the first to go."
"0","5","I used reeces pieces instead and they were great. Gone in a day!"
"0","5","Great, perfect for the holidays."
"0","3","This recipe was a little on the sweet side for my taste but they were very cute to look at coming out of the oven. The mini cupcake pan was a nice touch."
"0","5","Great recipe! So delicious, people ate them right up!! I added mini chocolate chips too to spread the chocolate flavor around the cookie. So yummy!"
"0","5","This was EASY and YUMMY! I brought them to a work pot luck and everyone loved them."
"0","5","Wonderful cookie. I made exactly as the recipe stated. Its very rich with the peanut butter cup on top, but great for a treat. I found the cookies a little tricky to get out of the muffin pan without them crumbling, so just placed them on a cookie sheet. I'm keeping this recipe in my recipe box...Yum!"
"0","4","This was a very good recipe every peanut butter cup lover will love this cookie. Beause I love chocolate I melted some and drizzled a little on the top of Cookie"
"0","5","These are awesome!!!! Every time I bring them to work they vanish!"
"0","5","I'd give these 100 stars if I could. I made them for my husband's birthday to share with the guys at his poker tournament. He liked them so much that he refused to share them. One warning bring them with you somewhere. Do not leave yourself alone with them or you're likely to eat them all!"
"0","5","The best cookies ever. My husband (who isn't generally a sweets lover) absolutely went crazy for these. I ended up having to make three batches to have enough left to give out to my neighbors. Every time I had people over to my house, these would 'mysteriously' disappear."
"0","5","These are great! I've made them twice now. The first time, I accidently omitted the milk and they still turned out fantastic! Nice and chewy. I also put other candies in the middle, but I still think the best is with the peanut butter cups though. I must have made mine a little big because I only got about 28-30 out of this recipe."
"0","5","I'm usually not very good when it comes to baking but I made these and everyone loved them. I wouldn't change a thing. Easy to make and absolutely delicious."
"0","5","these cookies are awesome!! love 'em."
"0","5","I've been asked for this recipe countless times! They are my friend's favorite and they ask for them all the time!"
"0","5","I made these at Christmastime, and found they were very popular."
"0","4","these were good. I used my mini-muffin tin and it worked out fine."
"0","5","Oh my...these are great!! Also did some Hershey's Kisses in them, very good!! Dries out after a few days though, if they last that long."
"0","5","Tastes amazing, the best cookie I have ever had, this works perfectly by simply placing the dough directly on a cookie sheet, then inserting the cups, after it bakes. And it is very important to place in the frezer right after!! Try this and no one will be dissapointed."
"0","5","Loved these! Made them for the holidays....made some with peanut butter cups and some with hershey kisses! Kids could not get enough of these! Thanks!!!"
"0","5","yummy, and perfect recipe to multiply as I made these for a cookie exchange that I need to make 8 dozen cookies!"
"0","5","I made these as part of my Christmas cookie goodie bags. They were raved over by everyone! I had so many people beg me for the recipe. When you are making these, definitely make sure that you have your peanut butter cups unwrapped before the cookies go in the oven. I kept forgetting and then racing the timer to unwrap all the cup so they were ready to press into the cookies immediately out of the oven."
"0","5","Yummy! I unwrapped the cups and put them in the freezer as suggested by another reviewer, this kept the cup whole instead of melting. I brought them to the office and everyone loved them! I will make them again!"
"0","5","These were very easy to make, and they tasted wonderful! Following the advice from earlier reviews, I refrigerated the unwrapped peanut butter cups overnight before I made the cookies. I pushed the Reese cups into the cookies as soon as they came out of the oven, and I didn't have any problems with the dough cracking around the edges. Also, I didn't form the dough into the muffin tins at all; I just used a small cookie scooper, and put the scoops into the cups. Great recipe!"
"0","5","YUMMY!!! I made these over the holidays to take to parties, and they were a hit. Looked and tasted great. They were even easier to make than I thought they would be. I did follow the advice to freeze the peanut butter cups, and that was definetly a good tip. I will put the cookies in the fridge/freezer after putting the peanut butter cups in next time, the chocolate began to melt so, I could't store them for a while."
"0","5","OK, I love PB cups, so I am a little biased. But I took these to a cookie exchange at work and got rave reviews. I do not have a mini muffin pan so I just did them on a regular cookie sheet and they came out fine."
"0","3","These cookies were too dry, but they were still pretty good. I don't think they won such rave reviews in my house that I'd make them again, though. My husband thought that they were TOO peanut buttery."
"0","5","Delicious! I am not a fan of the peanut butter blossom cookies with the kiss on the top but they are my husbands fave... so I tried something different that we both would like and he now has a new favorite!"
"0","4","good...but not the best...will keep looking."
"0","5","Yum. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","5","This was everyones favorite. I didn't have a muffin pan so I just made the cookies and put a peanut butter cup in the center. They turned out beautifully."
"0","5","i had to make another batch of these the next day because my boyfriend and his friends ate them ALL! SOOOOOOO GOOD!"
"0","5","also made these with regular chocolate chip cookie dough. was a hit."
"0","5","I made mine a little too large, but they tasted wonderful. They are even good with rolos or kisses."
"0","5","My coworkers did not believe that I made these! They were wonderful! I used the Walmart/Sams Club brand peanut butter cups because I think they are more creamy than the Reeses cups. I followed the advise of others and froze the peanut butter cups before putting them in the cookies, and I am glad that I did!! I used mini muffin trays as directed, and they all turned out perfectly matched!! Thanks so much for this recipe, it has been a huge hit!"
"0","5","You just can't go wrong with these cookies! So easy and delicious. I couldn't make enough of these and I had to just carry the recipe with me because every time I made these I was begged a copy. Thank you."
"0","5","the best cookies ive made in awhile. thanks to everyones tips they came out perfect! freeze the peanut butter cups before pressing them into the cookie and pop the tray back into the fridge to keep them from melting into a puddle. my cookies needed at least 10 minutes in the oven."
"0","5","These were very well received by everyone who ate them. I followed the recipe exactly cooking them for 8 minutes and they turned out great."
"0","5","These cookies are among my family's favorites. They are easy to put together and have a fun presentation. I think I'll go grab one right now..."
"0","5","What more can be said?! We followed all the good advice in the previous reviews and we (unknowingly) turned our peanut butter cups upside down."
"0","4","Love the cookie (made exactly as written), but prefer it with a Hershey kiss in the center over a PB cup.  I think this recipe tastes like the store-bought packages of PB cookies. This is the best recipe ever!"
"0","5","yum! and easy! only need 1 bag (20 oz.) of peanut butter cups. i froze the pb cups then added them to the cookies when they came out of the oven. then stuck the cookies in the refrig. - hardly and melting! thanks!"
"0","5","Fantastic! Kids loved helping me make this one. Definitely do freeze the peanut butter cups before putting them in the center - I am sure they would melt otherwise. Thanks for a great cookie party recipe!"
"0","5","I froze my Reese's as others had recommended, and the cookies came out awesome. Everyone loved them. :)"
"0","5","Really great recipe. I like these better than the peanut butter blossoms with the hershey kiss on top. I followed other's advise and froze my pb cups before putting them in the cookie. I did not refrigerate the cookies once they came out of the oven before putting the pb cup inside and they turned out great. I will be making these every year!"
"0","5","I made these just as the recipe called for. They were delicious! Thank you."
"0","5","This is my go-to recipe when I need to make a cookie that I know everyone will love. It's easy yet produces tasty cookies!"
"0","5","Thank you for this AWESOME recipe! I made a batch for one of my friends as a christmas gift and brought it to school. Soon, everyone was eating them up! All I did to alter the recipe was add some milk, because the dough turned out a little dry and crumbly."
"0","4","Turned out pretty good! I took the advice and put the pb cups in the freezer for about 30 min. When the cookies came out I waited about 4 min and the put the pb cups on top. I followed the recipe exact.Tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Perfect peanut butter cookie. My hubby's favorite recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is incredibly easy and very delicious. Kids and adults both love the cookies!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT! I agree with a previous reviewer about waiting to add peanut butter cups until the cookie has dipped a bit in the center. Worked perfectly. Also, I froze the peanut butter cups and after adding them to the cookie I refrigerated them in the pan. Absolutely wonderful! Thank you!"
"0","5","I make this cookie every year at christmas except I take the easy route. I buy the chocolate chip cookie dough that cames in the squares. I cut the squares in half,put them in my mini muffin tins, bake for 10 mins and when they are finished I press the pb cups in. They are absolutley delicious!"
"0","5","Wow. These were AMAZING!! Im rather new at baking, and these cookies made me look like a pro. Freezing the PB cups is a must. So easy, and SO yummy!!! These were gone in minutes. Thank you for tge recipe!!!"
"0","4","Good cookies!"
"0","4","I did like these cookies, I used white chocolate Reeses and they turned out great as well. However, the cookies ended up a little too cakey, Im sure that it was something I did wrong"
"0","5","These are fantastic! And super easy. I used the mini muffin pan from Pampered Chef and the small scoop. I filled all 48 cups. After they had cooled a bit I took almond bark and drizzled over the top and sprinkled with red and green sugar. Made for a great addition to my cookie tray."
"0","5","I'd give these more stars if I could. These are, hands-down, the BEST peanut butter cookies ever. I am on a sugarfree, low-carb diet and was baking these for Christmas gifts. Well, I ate a ton and ruined my diet and it was WORTH IT! Everyone went nuts for these, kids and adults alike. And I love the way they look."
"0","5","Amazing...this has become my family's new favorite! Per previous suggestions, I froze the PB cups. I didn't roll the dough into balls prior to putting it into the muffin tins, I just used a teaspoon cookie scoop, and they still turned out perfectly! This is now one of my 'go to' recipes!"
"0","5","These were perfect. I made them for Christmas gifts but my husband ate them all first."
"0","5","If heaven if a cookie, this would be it."
"0","5","These are great! I didn't have a mini muffin pan so I just used them as cookies, but think they'd be better in the muffin pans because then the peanut butter cups would be even more melty. Yum!"
"0","5","Best recipe ever! I agree that 7 minutes is perfect! I actually won 1st place at our annual office 'Holiday Bake-Off'!! I've been requested to make these cookies for everything, and tons of people have asked for the recipe! Thank you!! I would give this 10000 stars if I could!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT, My Family Can't Get Enough Of These, However The Recipe Given Only Make 24 In a Mini-Muffin Pan For Me, So I Always Make Sure and Double Batch, Cuz They Go So Quickly!!!"
"0","5","I used the recipe exactly the way it was. The suggestion to unwrap and freeze the cups was A+, if I hadn't done this, they would have broken when I tried to put the cups in the cookies. The only mistake I made was putting the cookies in the freezer once they were done - I should have used the fridge!"
"0","5","Unbelievably great cookies! Added them to homemade gift baskets and they were the favorite!!! My family LOVED them as well. Thanks so much for a new family favorite!"
"0","5","This is not a 5 star cookie, it's a 10! I did follow others' suggestions about freezing the peanut butter cups first. I'll be purchasing a second mini-muffin pan JUST for this recipe. Thank you!"
"0","5","These are so awesome! I made them just as written. I used some of the tips to help. I used my cookie scoop that's a tablesoon and got 48 balls (I didn't have enough pb cups but they are yummy without too). I put my PB cups in the freezer as well. Over all a great easy recipe that I know will be made again! My boys loved helping with this one."
"0","4","These were good, but not the best dessert ever. I wouldn't make these again. I much prefer peanut butter cookies with a stronger peanut butter flavor."
"0","3","Really rich. Not the kind of cookie you can really eat w/ out a lot of milk. I froze the PB Cups and reduced the heat to 365 for 7 minutes. I made twelve in my mini muffin pan and less than half were eatten. Will not be making this again and threw out my remain dough."
"0","4","I think they were in the oven too long. I like my cookies softer! But they still got all -- everyone liked them!"
"0","5","Yummmm!! So easy and so cute! The dough portion is the same recipe as the original Jif Peanut Blossom cookies which are a family favorite in our home. This added a nice twist to something we already love. Like other reviewers, I froze the peanut butter cups prior to pushing them in the cookies and that worked well. This was an easy recipe for my kids to help make. Make sure you double the recipe; they disappear fast!  UPDATE: I have decided it is best to grease the pans lightly. Otherwise, I cannot get them out of the pan. Might be the pan as I never had this problem before..."
"0","5","This recipe was great! And so easy to make. I used the suggestions for putting the peanut butter cups in the freezer which definitely helped. Also put the pan in the refrigerator after I put the peanut butter cups in. Helped the cookies cool and I could put them away faster."
"0","5","In a word, awesome ! These almost disappeared before I could try one !"
"0","5","Yummy, everyone loved them!"
"0","5","These were great! Everyone loved them. I would give them a perfect 10 but a 5 star will have to do!"
"0","5","I highly suggest having ~2~ (24) mini muffin pans. It's a pain to have to cool the chocolate cups in the pan in between bakes--really slowed me down. With 2 it would be a snap! You could also use a rolo and top w/ crushed pecans or pretzels- yummy!  This is a must have recipe and they freeze wonderfully! :)"
"0","5","These were awesome!"
"0","5","Worked out great for my Christmas cookie collection. Thanks!!"
"0","5","Great, easy to follow recipe. Delicious cookies, impossible to mess this up."
"0","5","This was my first adventure with this type of cookie and these turned out awesome. I used a mini-muffin pan and jammed the candies into the cookies right when they came out of the oven. I was suprised at how long the chocolate took to cool off. Next time I might put the cookies in the fridge to cool. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","I used another person's suggestion of freezing the peanut butter cups first and it worked great. Also, after I put the peanut butter cups in the cookies and as the chocolate was melting I added Christmas color sprinkles."
"0","5","I can't bake and I made these and they came out perfectly! I used the mini muffin liners on a cookie sheet, and they looked really cute!"
"0","5","Amazing! So easy to make. I put my Reeses peanut butter cups in the freezer as well. I also used crunch peanut butter, that was a nice touch."
"0","5","My husband adores these."
"0","5","These are delicious!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Always a hit and very easy to make."
"0","5","These are HORRIBLE...I can't stop eating them!:-) heehee! They truly taste wonderful! I didn't have mini muffin cups, so I used rounded dough on a cookie sheet and they worked fine. I made my cookies a little big, so I baked them from 9-10 minutes. Also, I didn't put them in the fridge afterwards, and this made these cookies 10x better b/c the reeces cup got very gooey and soft. :-) I did freeze the cups about an hour before making the cookies though, so I didn't have the problems of them melting away like some reviewers did. Didn't change a thing regarding the ingredients. This is a perfectly tempting cookie! :-)"
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful! The best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. This will definetly be on my list of must make cookies."
"0","5","I froze the reese cups, rolled the balls in sugar, AND tried the rolo's. All of these suggestions were from other members, ALL were great ideas and worked well. GREAT RECIPE!!!"
"0","5","Unwrapped the candies and froze over night. Made the dough and put it in the fridge for about an hour first so that it was firm and rolled easy. Used mini cupcake wrappers placed on a cookie sheet. Easy and quick and everyone loved them."
"0","5","Fantastic cookies!"
"0","5","Very easy to make, overall fantastic!"
"0","5","Oh lord these are good!! I didnt have a mini muffin pan, so I used a regular cookie sheet and wow! really excellent! A great cookie to make with kids as its easy and fast! I cant wait to eat more!"
"0","5","so easy! and so yummy! Froze the PB Cups."
"0","5","Fabulous! I wouldn't change a thing."
"0","5","These were a hit!"
"0","5","Very Yummy! Just what I was looking for. As recommended, I did toss the pb cups in the freezer for a bit before pushing them in the cookies, also put the pan in the fridge right after pusing in the pb cups so they didn't melt."
"0","4","These have a great taste. My boyfriend really likes them."
"0","5","I love this recipe and have also made them using Rolos candies instead of the peanut butter cup. A really great alternative too."
"0","5","this recipe is incredible. the cookies turned out moist and peanutbuttery. peanut butter cups started to melt slightly so i stuck them outside where its 15 degrees. after i ran out of peanut butter cups, i started using chocolate stars. i used 2 forks to gently lift cookies out of the muffin pans. this is an amazing recipe. i followed it as is."
"0","5","what a great recipe. everyone loved them and they were gone almost as quick as i pulled them out of the oven!"
"0","5","I have an egg allergy and couldn't have any but my husband and daughter were absolutely CRAZY over these. I made them for a family get together as a snack and they all went home with a copy of the recipe. Fantastic!!"
"0","5","So easy and oh so good! Putting them in the freezer works perfectly!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! They were a little difficult to get out of the pan, but working patiently paid off! Yum!"
"0","5","These are probably the cutest cookies I have ever seen, not to mention that they're delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully! So easy and so impressive looking!"
"0","5","I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! The best cookies I have ever made. Everyone loved them and my kids loved to help make them. Thanks!"
"0","5","I made this recipe for my husband and he loved them! They disappeared very fast. I didn't have a mini-muffin pan so I used a regular muffin pan with mini-muffin cups and it worked great!"
"0","3","The cookie texture was more cakelike than I expected. I think the recipe needs a little tweaking to get it just the way I remember."
"0","5","o my goodness!!!! These cookies were the best!! I am really glad I followed the other member's advice because even after I froze them they still melted a lot!!! I rolled mine in sugar like some of the other members suggested and use regular muffin tins!! You better work with what you got honey!!!! :)"
"0","5","These are Great!!! I just made them and they are vanishing already. I didn't change a thing with the recipe... They turned out perfect."
"0","5","Easy to make, delicious to eat! I wouldn't change a thing! This will always be on my list of cookies to make. Thanks."
"0","5","This was a great recipe and very easy to make. I took them to our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved them. We didn't bring any home!"
"0","5","I made these last year, and out of all the cookies I make, these are most requested. They turn out great everytime, and are fairly simple to make."
"0","5","Although not a peanut butter fan myself my husband absolutely loved these, as well as my sister-in-law. I cooled most of them in the fridge just after the addition of the cup. You could use just half a peanut butter cup, but it wouldn't look as pretty."
"0","5","Excellent! I did not have a mini muffin pan so I used a regular sized one instead. There was a little more cookie than there would have been with the mini pan but I think I prefer it this way. The cookie recipe is delicious and there were none left to bring home after Thanksgiving dinner!"
"0","5","These are amazing and did not last long once the staff at work got hold of them. The only change I made to the recipe was to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour, because my dough was a little too sticky to easily handle. Be careful not to overbake....they are only light brown aroudn edges when they are done. A keeper for the holidays (or anytime!)"
"0","5","Our familys new favorite cookie. Thanks 4 this recipe."
"0","5","Huge hit!!! As others suggested I used the mini cupcake holders and baked in a regular size muffin pan. I didn't freeze my peanut butter cups and they still worked like a charm."
"0","5","super easy and very yummy! Kids loved making these!!"
"0","5","I made these for Chrismas last year and they were a big hit. They are so easy to make and the cup in the middle was neat. They came out perfect, and will repeat this year for the holidays!. Thanks!"
"0","4","These cookies are good. Actually, they are good without the peanut butter cups too."
"0","5","Ridiculously good! Used all organic ingredients and they were just as fabulous!"
"0","5","very cute and fun to make. i froze the peanut cups which made them very easy to place in cookies. i also put pumpkin sprinkles on top... very cute!"
"0","5","Excellent! I am been making these for years and yes freeze the PB cups..it makes it easier."
"0","5","Very easy to make and eat! Great to do with kids! I took them to work and they were gone in no time!"
"0","3","The cookie tasted really plain I followed all the recipe but I did freeze the reeses and put the cookies in the refrigerater once they were done. Next time I would add more peanut butter so the cookie can have more of a peanut butter taste"
"0","5","Awesome! These were gone the day they were made."
"0","4","I finally made these after printing the recipe last summer. They are good, but I think a little overrated. The peanut butter cookie base didn't have much flavor. They really needed the p.b. cup, I felt. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I used my regular size muffin pan and baked them about 9 minutes. If I make these again, I will freeze the cups beforehand like others' suggested."
"0","5","These are delicious, i added sprinkles to the top of the cookie like the picture and my family and i couldn't get enough!"
"0","5","My husband says these are 'at least a 5!' They sure went fast in my house! Thanks"
"0","5","Mmmmmm.... Doesn't get any better than this."
"0","4","Superb, A very good appetizer A good snack A good mouthfull"
"0","5","My boyfriend made these for me last night, and they were great!"
"0","5","This is a great cookie, even without the peanut butter cup. Got lots of compliments. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful."
"0","5","This recipe was deliiicous! I used Hershey's kisses instead, they're what I had on hand. And I popped the fully assembled cookies (and the muffin pan) in the freezer for a few minutes so they were easy to get out of the pan. Great recipe. :)"
"0","4","Very original idea. Definitely needs the peanut butter cup, the cookie doesn't have that punch without it. I also cut the sugar by about 1/2 a cup. Made them for a friend and she loved them!"
"0","5","Very moist, our new favorite cookie."
"0","5","These were a hit at a church function. They are so easy to make and they taste SOOOOO good. Great recipe, thanks for sharing."
"0","4","SO Easy to make, and SOOOOO good!!"
"0","5","These are yummy! I messed up and didn't realize that I needed a mini muffin pan. I just made them on a cookie sheet with a thumb print on the top to flatten a bit. Not as pretty as the picture but they still looked ok. I've made 3 different cookies this week and these are the best by far!"
"0","5","It was a great recipe and the sprinkles taste great on the top!!"
"0","5","Just made these this morning. They were very easy to make and the kids love them."
"0","3","These were pretty but I must have done something wrong because the bottoms were mushy. Either needed to make the balls smaller or bake them longer - not sure which. Anyway, the concept is a good one."
