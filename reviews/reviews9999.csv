"1523","5","Kids said that these are better than Reese's! Very tasty. Has anyone tried using just 1 stick of butter successfully? I'll let you know if it works! UPDATE: I made these with 1 1/2 sticks of butter with equally delicious results. I will update again trying 1 stick...UPDATE #2: Okay, I tried one stick of butter - the taste is still delicious! The only difference is that the peanut butter part is a little more crumbly...doesn't hold together quite as well...so you decide how much butter you want to use!"
"953","5","These have become an absolute staple in my house! Also, it is my total standard recipe for 'gotta-bring-something-sweet' to 'fill-in-the-blank'. SO easy, SO fast and terrific for satisfying those cravings. I chill the peanut butter base for 15 or 20 minutes before topping with the chocolate so the warm chocolate doesn't melt into the peanut butter too much, making spots of too thick chocolate and leaving other areas spread too thin!"
"586","5","These were great! I was a little worried because I used natural peanut butter and the bottom layer was really runny when I put it in the pan. I am glad I kept them refrigerated because they do soften quickly at room temperature but all in all, they turned out great. Everyone who tried them loved them and my friend wanted the recipe. I had hoped to find a review saying they work even with natural peanut butter but couldn't find one, so now you know! I'm sure they are firmer with regular peanut butter but I'll save myself the hydrogenated oil!  UPDATE: This has become a staple in our house as well as many of our friends. I still prefer natural peanut butter, and I've found Skippy Natural works the best, but you can do with other kinds like Laura Scudders, etc. Just keep them in the fridge!"
"253","5","Out of all the chocolate/peanut butter bar recipes on this site, this one to me is the best because it has a good ratio of chocolate layer to peanut butter layer and also is not too sweet to allow the chocolate and peanut butter flavors to shine through. I made a few alterations for my own personal taste as well. I added an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter to the bottom layer mixture. I also used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips and I used the whole 12 oz bag (for 2 cups total). Since I had more chips, I also added 1/4 cup of butter to the chocolate/peanut butter melting mixture. This helps keep the chocolate layer smooth and spreadable and helps adhesion to the peanut butter layer."
"237","5","SO GOOD!!!! If you are a peanut butter/chocolate fanatic like me, then you will love this. I followed other reviewers suggestions to make the recipe easier by melting the peanut butter with butter, then mixing with graham crackers and powdered sugar. Also, chill the peanut butter base for 15 minutes before topping with chocolate mixture."
"216","5","I decreased the butter to 1 1/2 sticks, and used 14 graham crackers, and milk chocolate chips. I used softened butter instead of melted. You really need to pulverize the graham crackers to a fine powder to get the texture of this recipe right (a food processor works great). I used a 7x11 pan so they'd be thicker. Taste just like Reese's except the filling is a little coarser. Keep these babies in the refrigerator or you'll have a soft, gooey mess on your hands!"
"143","5","A hit, a major hit. Our guests loved this, we loved this, my children asked me to make it again this week. Since we only have dessert once a week, that is a big compliment! To make mixing easier, I put the pb in the pan with the butter and let it 'melt' along with the butter. Then I added both to the graham crackers and powdered sugar. Otherwise, I followed it exactly. Thanks!"
"105","5","I loved these Peanut Butter bars! I helped my Mom make them. They were easy enough that I could make them on my own! This tops any dessert I ever had! We froze half of the bars they were great too. For the peanut butter part, we only used a half of cup of butter instead of a whole cup.  JOHN AGE 9"
"93","4","These are very good and very sweet. I made them to send to a friend and they didn't turn out as sturdy as I was hoping for. I'm keeping this batch (poor me) and will make her another using less butter in the PB mixture and less PB in the chocolate. I think I'll also add a little salt. Thanks for the recipe!"
"92","4","These were really good. I would like a bit more peanut butter flavor (personal preference). Based on another recipe I cut the bars up after chilling for 10 minutes, then chilled until ready to serve. I had no problem with the chocolate breaking up that way."
"63","5","Mini muffin pan + mini muffin liners = MINI PEANUT BUTTER CUPS!!! Drizzle warm chocolate into a thin layer on the bottom, place a small ball of the peanut butter mixture(leaving space between it and the liner all around the sides) and drizzle more chocolate over the ball until it is fully encased!   The chocolate set up quickly and beautifully. I'm bringing them to a Thanksgiving event so I will update with pictures and how well they went over. If they taste anything like they look and smell they'll be a hit!"
"51","5","These are so easy to make and taste amazing! The only changes I made that were suggested by other reviewers was using 1 1/2 sticks of butter and also chilling the peanut butter/graham cracker base layer for 25 minutes before adding the warm chocolate peanut butter layer. I used dark chocolate chips one time, and used the semisweet chips another time (I usually only eat dark chocolate!) and couldn't really notice a difference. My boyfriend loved them and took some to work--his coworkers loved them too. They actually ask for them! They are very addicting."
"34","5","These turned out great! I had read previous posts where people had used natural peanut butter and it had not set up. I also used natural peanut butter and it turned out perfect. This is what I did - I added the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and peanut butter to my kitchen aid and mixed. I melted the butter and then just poured it in until it looked like a good consistency…..there was still quite a bit of the butter left. I mixed it well, and it set up great, I did not need to keep it in the fridge like others had with the natural peanut butter. I hope that helps! YUMMY!!!"
"27","3","I found these didn't turn out as I had hoped! The semi-sweet chocolate gave it a funny flavor and the chocolate was super hard to cut unto while the peanut butter bottom was a bit soft. I bake out of my home and wanted to try some new recipes, this just isn't one I'd use. It had a some what good flavor, but next time I would definately use a diiferent flavor chocolate chip and try a different method on letting them set and harden."
"27","5","I am a beginner baker and have to say that these peanut butter bars are completely fool proof! They taste great and completely satisfy my sweet tooth! I followed to recipe exactly in addition to these reviewer's tips: 1) allow the peanut butter base to harden in the refrigerator for 20mins before spreading the chocolate on top; 2) cut the squares after about 20mins in the refrigerator to prevent the chocolate topping to crack. I strongly recommend this recipe for anyone who loves peanut butter and sweet desserts!"
"22","5","Yum! Made these for Christmas- my grandma made her famous apple and pumpkin pies but everyone stood around waiting for me to cut these! Next time I make them, I'm going to use less sugar- maybe 1.5 cups because 2 cups is just too much, these are tooth-achingly sweet. Also, I can't recommend enough lining the pan with something- parchment would be best but anything would work since you're not baking them. With the amount of butter I didn't think twice about following the instructions and not greasing the pan, but I wish I had- getting them out was a pain. It's a little easier when they're a bit softer but they're harder to eat then... catch 22! All in all, very yum. Why eat reeses?!"
"19","5","I was the hit of the party with these bars! Everyone loved them! I followed the advice of one reviewer and melted the peanut butter with the butter. This made it very easy to mix and to spread in the pan. I also lined the pan with wax paper, so when I was ready to cut, I just pulled it out of the pan and put it on a chopping block. The peanut butter melted into the chocolate topping was perfect.. I used a double boiler for that. I will definitely make these again for my next event."
"17","4","I really wanted to rate this a 5, but the chocolate top layer kept separating from the bottom layer which made cutting and serving this for a party a little tricky.  I did use all natural pb. I wonder if that is the problem.  I did step one in a food processer, which allowed me to freshly crumb the graham crackers first, and then add the remaining ingredients.   The flavor was very good. Just the texture issue with the 2 layers separating."
"15","5","OMG!!! I made this for friends and ended up eating the entire batch myself! I'm such a PIG!   FYI, I used natural peanut butter and think this will make a significant difference, as compared to processed PB."
"15","5","So yummy and so easy!! I took the suggestion from other reviewers to melt the peanut butter WITH the butter for easier mixing. I had to use honey graham crackers because that's what was in my pantry. I used 1 stick of salted and 1 stick of unsalted butter and even added a big pinch of sea salt. This was perfect for my taste. The semi-sweet chocolate helped to tone down the sweetness of the p.b. mixture as well. If I would've used milk chocolate chips, as another reviewer suggested, it would've been WAY too sweet for me. After patting the peanut butter mixture into a parchment-covered 9x13 dish, I refrigerated for approx. 30 mins. before spreading the melted chocolate on top. I'm glad I used the entire 12oz. bag of chocolate chips rather than the 1 1/2 cups the recipe called for because I feel if I hadn't, my chocolate layer would've been pretty thin. I refrigerated again for approx. 45 mins. and then cut into small squares. I read a few reviews where folks had trouble with the chocolate layer separating from the p.b. mixture and I'm happy to say I didn't have this problem :) These are so good with a tall glass of ice-cold milk...mmmm!"
"14","1","I would not make these again, I did not taste enough peanut butter. Anyone that is going to try this recipe might want to try adding a little more peanut butter and taking some butter away."
"13","4","I made the recipe EXACTLY as instructed -- no substitutions, no reductions or increases in ingredients. You know, the way you're supposed to if you're going to review a recipe. :) After doing so, I have three tips:  1. I found the texture of the bottom peanut butter layer in the finished bars to be somewhat 'grainy,' for lack of a better term, and I processed my graham crackers VERY fine. I suggest mixing them with the melted butter and then letting them sit until they have gotten completely mushy before you add the peanut butter. 2. About prepping the pan and cutting them: I lined my pan with that nonstick liner that's parchment on one side and foil on the other side, with the foil side down. (No pan cleanup makes this a real bonus.) After refrigerating the bars overnight, I turned the full brick out CHOCOLATE SIDE DOWN -- very easy if you use the liner -- onto a piece of waxed paper and let them sit for 15 minutes so they got soft enough to cut. I used a pizza cutter, but whatever works for you. Using this method I had very little cracking of the chocolate layer, and they're quite attractive. 3. Store them in the fridge unless you like this sort of thing gooey or unless you keep your house VERY cool. The butter in the PB layer makes them good, but it doesn't hold up well at room temperature. I layered mine with waxed paper in a Tupperware container and they are holding together quite nicely.  This is an easy and delicious treat. The instructions just need some tweaking."
"12","4","Very yummy and the kids loved them, I used choco chip cookies and fudge striped cookies I had left over"
"12","4","The photo posted is misleading because they do not come out that thick in a 9x13 pan. You may want to use a much smaller pan. These are extremely sweet, be ware!"
"12","4","I have to agree with other reviewers: I would call these Reese's peanut butter bars if I could. These calorie-packed monsters taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups except they're in the form of bars. But for me, this recipe is four-star because it is TOO sweet. I even decreased confectioner's sugar to 1-1/2 cups, but they were still sweet. Even my American friends thought that they were plenty sweet. SCARY! If I ever make these again, I'd use only 1 cup confectioner's sugar. And with that adjustment, I'd increase the amount of graham cracker crumbs for a firmer base by 1/4 to 1/2 cup, which was what I did this time. I also used only 1-1/2 sticks margarine, which worked well. For both the base and choc layer, I used chunky peanut butter; I only stirred in 3 Tbsp peanut butter in the choc mixture though and the peanut-butter flavor was strong enough for me. I decreased choc chips to 1 cup as well. But, instead of all choc chips, I melted 1/2 cup hazelnut milk choc squares. That's why you can see bits of white-colored nuts in the choc layer. Overall, this is a calorie-loaded treat that we can enjoy once in a while--BUT, only with the amount of sugar decreased!"
"11","4","I thought these were excellent. As others have said, it reminded me of the treats they used to make in my elementary school cafeteria (OK, that was about a million years ago!). Those who have said that the crust is 'too wet,' cannot be doing this right. My guess is that these people have not used the full 2 cups of crumbs (btw, 14 graham crackers is approximately 1 cup--a full box 14.4 oz box is needed for 2 cups). The butter--regardless of the amount--will be totally absorbed by the cracker crumbs. In other words, 'wet' crust is NOT because the amount of butter is too much. You could cut it back a bit if you like, but it won't drastically change the texture. As a couple of other commenters have said, after melting the 1.5 cups of chocolate, I felt like it needed a bit more. So, I added another 1/2 cup before pouring/spreading the topping.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane."
"10","5","Easy and tasty! My first attempt wasn't so good but I changed a few things and voila! success! I did 2 packs of graham crackers processed in the food processor to a very fine consistency, and I melted the peanut butter and butter together. I refrigerated these in the 9x13 pan for about 20 min. before I added the topping. For the topping I used a bag (12 oz) of semi-sweet choc chips and a 1/4 c. peanut butter. After putting on the topping I put them back in the fridge for another 20 min and then cut them. They look great and taste even better!"
"10","5","These are TO DIE FOR! So good, will make it again and again!"
"10","5","I have made this recipe exactly as it is written 5 times now, it is always well received. Thank you for sharing. Couldn't be a better way to do this, if you are having troubles, you aren't doing something right."
"9","5","Simple and delicious! Thanks for sharing, Nancy!"
"9","4","Yummy! Made this for Christmas, cut into small squares and set it on a serving tray. Everyone loved em! Even had to pass the recipe on. :)"
"8","3","I made this recipe exactly as provided, and I found the peanut butter layer to be too crumbly and too sweet. I'm not sure how this ended up so differently than some of the really positive reviews. Overall, the flavor is pretty good, and I like the texture that the graham cracker crumbs adds. I would simply prefer the PB layer to be a bit more moist. Perhaps next time I could cut back on the sugar and crumbs and maybe add a bit more PB."
"8","5","The first time I made these, they were to die for. The second time, not so much. The second time I used cheaper ingredients so don't make that mistake. I portioned these out and wrapped individually before keeping them in the fridge (they get really soft at room temperature)."
"8","4","These are so good! the only thing I will do next time is cup the powder sugar in half it was way too sweet"
"8","5","This is the best candy recipe I have ever tried. It is absolutely delicious and so easy. I followed the recipe exactly. I did let the peanut butter base set in the frig for 30 minutes before making the chocolate topping. Then I let the entire thing chill for two hours before I cut it. It was perfect. There is no reason to change anything about this recipe. I would suggest you try it as written before you start making changes because I doubt you will want to change a thing. It really does taste just like a Reese Peanut Butter Cup."
"7","3","Ok, so as written. the recipe gets a 3 from me: here's why. 1 cup of butter, melted was WAY too much! My mixture was like a soup when it should have been more like a semi solid that I could press into a pan. The only way to offset this was to add more graham cracker crumbs which made the mixture too grainy. Next time I will only use 3/4 cup butter melted and see how that turns out."
"7","5","I tried this same recipe with chocolate graham crackers and white chocolate chips instead of the milk chocolate it was great for the holidays. All around a great recipe."
"7","5","Oofta ... These are so rich! The recipe says there are 12 servings, but I would say that this it is closer to 24. As others have suggested, I added some extra peanut butter to the bottom -- About 1/4 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt to cut the sweetness just a little bit. After I mixed the peanut butter layer and put it in the pan, I used a piece of waxed paper to flatten it and get a nice even thickness. I also refrigerated it for a while to get it nice and firm before putting the chocolate layer over the top. My husband thought that these tasted like peanut butter cups, as the description says. I thought that they also resembled Girl Scout Tagalongs or even a little like a Butterfinger. Will make again, but make sure we have lots of people to share them with ... I don't even want to think about the calories and fat in these puppies! :)"
"7","5","Great recipe! My daughter has to eat gluten-free and casein-free because of autism, so I replaced the graham cracker crumbs with rice krispies (crushed) and the margarine with a milk-free version. I'm sure it wasn't the same as the original version, but still really tasty!"
"6","5","I highly recommend using milk chocolate and not semi-sweet. I honestly cannot rave enough about this fantastic recipe! It is way better than a Reese's. I will make a full batch to take to parties or events and I make half batches for myself to enjoy throughout the week and pour it into a glass pie pan. I usually add more chocolate to the top, mmmmmmmm......"
"6","3","this recipe is ok, i found that for a smoother and better peanut butter taste, use the recipe for buckeyes that was submitted on this site by Tammy Winters and instead of making them out into balls, just press into bottom of pan. i use half semi-sweet choc chips and half milk chocolate chips that is more to my families likes, and the 4 tbls. of peanut butter mixed into the melted chocolate is a wonderful idea."
"5","5","These are a favorite at our house. If you don't like the gritty texture just grind the graham crackers for a long time in a food processor, add the butter and let the butter soak into the crackers for a few minutes before continuing. To keep the chocolate topping from cracking when cutting leave it out of the fridge for 15 minutes before cutting. You can line the pan with parchment paper, which makes it easy to remove out of the pan, lay it upside down on another piece of parchment paper, bring it to room temperature for about 15 minutes, cut it with a pizza cutter and return it to the fridge before eating. They will come out perfect, but are better to eat while they are cold."
"5","5","I made these and it's way more than one household with 3 kids needs to be consuming. I ended up cutting them up and giving a baggie full to 2 separate next door neighbors. The first guy took one out of the baggie and ate it and wanted to steal the other baggie. Guess that means they went over well. LOL"
"5","5","These are too easy to make. They disappear so fast. I highly recommend hiding some in the freezer for yourself. Five Stars!"
"5","5","I created my own crumbs from graham crackers in the food processor, then added the powder sugar, mixed; then added the peanut butter, and as this was mixing added the butter slowly. It was much quicker than doing it by hand. My husband loves Reese's, and he loved these more...as he says 'This is a do over'."
"5","5","Awesome! I used crunchy peanut butter for the bottom part and used creamy peanut butter with the chocolate chips--turned out really well."
"5","1","Must have done something wrong because peanut butter mix never got hard, just mush! :-("
"5","5","Used chocolate graham crackers and a little bit of crushed oreos because that's what I already had but they came out amazing! My only suggestions are, you shouldn't need more than 3/4 cup of butter... maybe even a little less. And using a 9x13 they would come out really thin so I would make more of the graham cracker mixture or use a smaller dish. Otherwise this is a great recipe I will definitely use again!"
"5","5","Thanks for a great recipe!"
"5","5","Nancy these bars are sooo easy to make and they are to die for. Love them and my family loves them. We will be making these tasty treats oftem. Thanks"
"5","5","Everyone loved it. Instead of using graham cracker i used golden graham cereal and made the bars that way with the peanut butter."
"5","5","Addictive! Update 9/4/10: Made this for the second time tonight. Got to be one of the easiest treat recipes I have ever made! Can throw a pan together in no time. Unfortunately, they will also disappear in no time!! Used the suggestion in another review and made it using 2 cups of chips and 1/4 cup peanut butter in the topping. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"5","5","Amazing bars... I love that they are no bake!"
"5","4","The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 is I followed sunnybirds suggestion and used less butter in the PB mix. I used about 3/4 c. That said, these are absolutely wonderful. The kids loved them and said they were better than reese's cups! I love the fact that you can make these and never have to turn on the oven. Wonderful when it is very very very hot out. Thanks for sharing this wonderful quick and easy treat!"
"5","5","Just like peanut butter cups is right! If you refridgerate before putting chocolate one, be sure not to cool it too much cause then the chocolate layer won't stick and it will crack when you cut it..."
"5","5","************* This recipe is very delicious so I had to add extra stars! The have a taste that is between reeses peanut butter cups and a butterfinger. You will definetly enjoy these! Thanks for the recipe!"
"5","5","All I can say is WOW!!! My work does a rotating snack schedule and on my week I brought these. They were so good that they were gone in 15 min. My only comment is to make sure your graham crackers are finely crushed, or they will be grainy."
"5","5","Mmmmm! Way too good! Way too easy! I find myself making a tiny batch just for myself when I get a craving!"
"4","5","I have made this many times now, and EVERY TIME I use an entire box of Keebler Graham Cracker Crumbs to achieve the texture I am after. I then line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper, put on plastic foodservice gloves (a lifesaver for many messy recipes and doughs), and just squoosh the PB mixture down onto the pan. After topping with chocolate I refrigerate until set, then lift the parchment out and cut with a pizza wheel. So. Easy. Tastes like Buckeyes with none of the hassle. Now here is my original old review: This recipe literally saved me! I needed to produce a sweet treat on a deadline. I fell for a food blogger, and like every other time I have made a blog/Pinterest recipe....it was a miserable failure. I know better than to stray from AllRecipes, because the reviews and suggestions make a good recipe great. With two hours until my deadline I had two pans of multicolored blog-inspired garbage. I decided to try these, and they were *awesome*! I have never made chocolate chip/peanut butter frosting, but it was picture perfect. I make everything with parchment paper, so I easily lifted them out of the pan, cut them with a pizza wheel, and put them in candy papers for pretty presentation. The taste-testing husband has already declared that I need to make more soon...for him. I can't thank the poster and reviewers enough!"
"4","5","I will never go back to Reese's! I used baker's semisweet chocolate and grated it finely so it melted evenly - glad I got the warmer element on my stove for exactly this!"
"4","5","Made these for my boyfriend and he loved them! When he goes home to school, I always want to send him with something sweet to get him through the week. I was short on time and these were PERFECT. So easy to make, 4 ingredients, and they tasted good too.   CHANGES I MADE: Instead of 1 cup of butter, I used a little more than 1/2 a cup. Seemed like way too much butter to me and my bars came out great. Still held together and they weren't overly-rich. I think the next time I make it though, I'm going to use natural peanut butter."
"4","5","These were a hit at work! I made the following modifications: only 1.5 sticks of butter, 16 honey graham cracker sheets and almost 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips. I also used Skippy natural chunky peanut butter. As others suggested, I chilled the crust for 15 minutes before pouring out the chocolate and I kept them in the fridge until it was time to eat them."
"4","5","Amazing! I couldn't believe how easy these are to make and that they taste identical to the famous peanutbutter cup candies. I could tell when melting the chocolate that it was going to set up harder than I wanted so I added an extra tablespoon of peanutbutter, 1tbsp of butter and 2tbsp of half and half and the end result was perfect. As others have mentioned in their reviews, let the bottom layer chill at least 20min to prevent the chocolate from mixing into the peanutbutter. Next time I will be lining my pan with parchment paper so I can pull the whole thing out to cut. Cutting got a bit messy."
"4","1","Easy, fast and delicious. I made this reciepe for the first time, to be sold at a bake sale. I have no idea if they sold, but I tasted them and they were fantastic!"
"4","4","These are quick, easy and tasty! I got 2nd place in our bar contest at work... 2nd place to someone else with this recipe! Very rich too."
"4","3","This was too sweet, and I LOVE anything peanut butter/chocolate. Also, the base gets soft very quickly out of the refrigerator. Probably will not make again."
"4","5","These were really great if you love a really rich treat! Made them for a party and everyone loved them! They didn't last very long at all!!"
"4","2","I've been wanting a good peanut butter bar recipe for a while, and after seeing all the great reviews, thought this one looked good. My family and I were pretty disappointed. I made the recipe exactly as it said (even though I considered cutting the butter in half). They were quite bland and I almost felt like I was biting into a cube of butter. The recipe needs to be reworked to make it a 5. If I were to even attempt these again, I would decrease the butter, increase the sugar, and add vanilla for starters. As is, they were lacking."
"4","5","I read a past review where natural peanut butter was used and unlike that review I would not recommend it. Something was lost flavour wise. I gave it an excellent rating as I'm sure with regular peanut butter it would be scrumptious. But with the natural peanut butter, it really took over and I'm sure changed the taste."
"4","5","So just how do you type lip smacking noises anyway? If I could it would be accurate for these bars! I made them for my son to celebrate his first day of college. They were a big hit with everyone! I used candy melts in place of the chips because 'someone' took to nibbling on my bag of chips I had planed for this!!! LOL Worked just fine and was the only change made. I chilled the bars prior to cutting but after attempting to slice the first row I let the pan sit for 30 minutes. This prevented cracking beautifully and they sliced just as nicely as the recipe photo! I also cut in to much smaller pieces as 12 servings is way to large a serving for us. I got about 40, 1 inch or so, squares. Just right for a grab and go bite! Will definitely make again!"
"4","3","Very good. Definitely add more butter to ensure a solid crumb/peanut butter base. Chilling the base before pouring on the chocolate was an excellent suggestion, too."
"4","2","I was very disappointed in these bars. It doesn't taste like Reese's, and believe me, I would know. The graham cracker crumbs ruin the texture, it was mealy and grainy. I'd much prefer the taste of buckeyes, you can probably make that recipe into a bar."
"4","4","These are almost too rich! I liked the appearance, but the texture was a little strange. I think you have to not just crush your grahams, but make them into powder. I'd try it again, but with changes."
"4","5","I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and I love these! I make them all the time now. One change I make sometimes is to lower the amount of icing sugar, and up the graham cracker crumbs, just because sometimes I find the base toooo sweet. But I don't do that all the time."
"4","5","These turned out great. I agree they are better chilled, although mine didn't become mush at room temp. I did not think it needed salt added to the peanut butter mixture. I guess that depends on the pb you use. Mine were not gritty either. I turned th e graham crackers to near powder. I also stuck the pb in with the butter I melted. Mixing was easy. I also used milk chocolate chips because I like them better."
"4","4","The peanut butter layer never really did get hard enough to serve as 'bars'. I think maybe using margarine (the spreadable kind) was a bad idea. I think I will try this again using real butter, or stick margarine, because it does have a good flavor."
"4","5","quick, easy, and delicious!  I would use a little less graham cracker crumb and a little more powdered sugar.  Regrigerate for about 30-45min, then cut into squares, then continue to refrigerate (if the chocolate hardens too much they are difficult to cut)"
"4","3","The bars did not set up for me. They had to stay refrigerated to be able to eat them."
"3","4","the cookie base is way too sweet. I halved the amount of powdered sugar, friends still find it too sweet. Next time I'd cut the sugar to 1/4-1/2 cup."
"3","4","I halved the recipe and they still turned out great! A little rich, but the ratio of chocolate to peanut butter is perfect, and the consistency is creamy and delicious."
"3","5","This is a great easy recipe for peanut butter bars. They aren't too rich or overly sweet. The crushed graham crackers give the peanut butter mixture a nice texture. I used creamy peanut butter. My husband loves peanut butter and he really liked these."
"3","5","These turned out great.  I'd recommend using 'Milk Chocolate' chocolate chips rather than semi sweet. It gives it much more of a smoother taste and even balance.  Keep this one for sure!"
"3","5","Only tweaks I made were to line the dish with wax paper to be able to have them come out cleanly and easily (made it much easier than the first batch when I did not) and I chilled the peanut butter layer for 30 minutes or so before putting on the chocolate layer. Wife and son loved these!"
"3","2","My peanut butter never hardened it stayed gooey. So I don't know what happened"
"3","5","For those of you who say the instructions are confusing.. Read the ingredient list. It clearly states 1 cup of peanut butter and then another 4 tablespoons peanut butter. The 4 tablespoons are what you mix with the chocolate for melting. Also, due to variations in humidity and moisture content in different peanut butter brands, etc, those who are having problems with the filling being too runny need to adjust and add more powdered sugar or graham crackers to achieve the desired consistency.   If you make changes based on how it sets up, you will be fine. I've made this recipe probably a dozen times and I always have to make minute adjustments according to temperature or humidity and brands of peanut butter. After a few times making it, you can easily see how to adjust it."
"3","5","Love this recipe! Line your pan with wax or parchment paper before you begin allowing an inch or so to hang over the sides. When you are ready to cut the bars, lift the entire dessert out of the pan by holding on to the paper liner. It is SO much easier to cut if you take it out of the pan first."
"3","1","This just tasted like eating a spoonful of peanut butter mixed with butter. Way too rich for me and that's surprising because I LOVE all things peanut butter and chocolate."
"3","2","Something wrong with recipe! I went to make it but got so confused because when you melt the chocolate for the top layer it says to melt it with the peanut butter, but you used the entire cup of peanut butter that was listed in the recipe in the first layer. So was the bottom layer only supposed to use some, but not all, of the peanut butter? Were you supposed to reserve some for the top layer? There are so many good reviews but it doesn't make sense to me."
"3","5","I read a lot of the Reviews & adjusted the recipe as followed: I only used 1 1/2 sticks of Butter & followed the rest of the bottom ingredients to make the crust. I DID put in the frig. for aprox 30 min. based on what others said. I did also increase the chocolate to 2 cups of chips (you can also use 'chunks') & 5 TBSP of PB melted together, I did this in a double boiler & then poured it over the 'crust' mixture. Then put back in the frig for another couple of hours. They ARE Fabulous! My entire family loved them, already getting requests to make them again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
"3","5","So bad for you, but sooooo good!"
"3","5","Made these using half the butter. I filled 1 tbsp of filling per mini muffin cup and refrigerated for 20 minutes, then spooned 1/2 tbsp of chocolate layer on top of each. Just enough for 56 mini pb cups and they look great! I made these for xmas gift boxes."
"3","5","I read tons of reviews and decided to test this out before I made it for a LARGE cookie exchange next week. The only small changes I made were 1. I melted the butter with the peanut butter in the bowl, 2. I put the butter/sugar/peanut mixture in the fridge for 30 min to set it up before I did the chocolate part. and finally 3. I added a smidge more peanut butter to the chocolate in the last part to increase the peanuty flavor. This recipe ROCKS! It set up beautifully...even though I doubled it! Easy. Quick. Perfect! Cookie Exchange, here I come!"
"3","5","I made these about a month ago and everyone loved them. I just made 2 batches of this recipe today to take to church this weekend. Only thing I do different is to use 1 1/2 cups of Splenda in place of 2 cups confectioners sugar, taste great and have received very high praise from my husband."
"3","3","was really easy to make the kids thought they were so yummy"
"3","4","I'm not the kind of person to write a review when I've made a bunch of changes from the original recipe. I followed this recipe exactly, and it was very good, but it was a little soft. The bars couldn't be taken out of the fridge for more than five minutes or they'd melt. But they tasted delicious, everyone loved them."
"3","5","very easy and very good: I used crumbled bread instead of graham crackers and my kids appreciated it"
"3","5","Delicious, tasted very similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Much more like a candy than a traditional cookie bar. Followed the recipe exactly. Thanks!"
"3","5","These bars never last long in our household! I use half the butter as well, and it comes out perfect. My husband likes to say it's even better than a Reese's Cup; I love the crunch that goes along with it. Good stuff!"
"3","5","Fabulous recipe! The kids couldn't get enough and are already begging for more."
"3","5","Very yummy. They are extreemly sweet so cut them small. My picky hubby really liked them so it's a keeper. Also, this makes a LOT of peanut butter squares.. next time I'll probably cut it in 1/2."
"3","5","Let this sit in the fridge for a day or two, it gets better as it ages. Also, soo much better cold. LOVED it!"
"3","5","These are just wonderful!! Simple and quick to make and they sit in the fridge until temptation strikes.... we added some chopped peanuts to the base for extra crunch - a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing Nancy."
"3","4","The graham cracker crumbs made the peanut butter layer less creamy than I expected, but they were very good. The family loved them."
"3","4","I brought these to a BBQ of mostly adults. As soon as they were served I was sought out, introduced to new people, and asked for my recipe. Very decadent. I think I'll try dark chocolate and cut the sugar a bit next time as they were very sweet -- but no one had any complaints. This recipe definitely serves more than 12 people."
"3","5","ShielaRenee....I melt milk chocolate chips..without the peanut butter...you need to put them in the fridge for about half hour...when you see the shine start to go off the chocolate topping, take them out of fridge and cut them before they harden...hope this helps..been making these for years and they are a fave at our house..."
"3","5","This is a great recipe that takes alterations easily. I didnt have graham crackers so i used vanilla wafers (yummy!), real butter, creamy peanut butter, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. i was worried about my chocolate not melting correctly but i tossed in a tbsp of butter and it was perfect:) will definitely make again:)"
"3","4","Seemed like they should be refrigerated but they taste much better at room temp, the peanut butter layer is creamier that way."
"3","5","I have made these a few times. They have turned out best when I have ran the graham crackers through the blender and when I have used creamy peanut butter when mixing p.b. into the melted chocolate. I love using crunchy p.b. in the base of the dessert. I have also used real butter and margarine. Both have worked fine. The butter solidifies a little easier and quicker. A favorite in our family!"
"3","5","These were great!!! I used 2 8x8 pans. I started with organic PB that doesnt have sugar so I added a little more powdered sugar to the crust. I found the chocolate and organic PB mixture hard to spread, it was very thick! The other pan, I used Jiffy PB and I had no problem, the mixture spread nicely. Moral of the story, use the full fat, full sugar PB! They both tasted great but the Jiffy pan was easier to make."
"3","4","These were really good, but mine were much thinner than pictured. I made everything as listed except I used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 stick. I did make them in a 9x13 as listed. Not sure why mine were so thin. They are really rich though, so being thinner is not all that bad."
"3","5","These were so simple and came out delicious! Using what I had in my pantry, I used reduced-fat peanut butter, 14 (~1 cup) reduced-fat graham crackers, margarine, and semi-sweet baking chocolate squares. Per the recommendation of another reviewer, I used my food processor to finely grind up the graham crackers for a good consistency in the bars. Overall, I love how easy these were to make, and they were a hit with the family."
"3","5","OMG these are delicious! i was looking for something that was similar to Reeses as they are quite difficult to get hold of in the uk, and these were spot on! simple to make and tasted great, they are very sweet though but thats fine for me ;) have made these many times now and i am sure they will stay a firm favourite in our house."
"3","5","Made with Skippy Natural Peanut Butter, that is what I had. These came out great! Wish I had this recipe around Christmas. I would have made candy with these. Better than a Reese Peanut Butter Cup!!!! Will be a staple in our house too!"
"3","5","It taste just like a Reese's PB cup. Awesome and sooooo easy!! Thank you for sharing;)"
"3","5","How can you go wrong to peanut butter and chocolate? You just can't say no to these!!"
"3","3","I liked it but it was a bit crumbly for me. I would use less graham cracker next time. Also, I added vanilla wafers. YUMMY"
"3","5","This was absolutely simple. Great for hands-on kids who want to help. I used name brand peanut butter as I've never had a cookie/bar recipe turn out with store brand/cheap peanut butter. These absolutely taste like Reese's. Or, so my husband tells me. He just likes it because it's bigger than those little cups. For him, bigger is always better."
"3","5","Oh, this is bad. I hate peanut butter, but somehow, I flippin' LOVE these things. Made them for lunchbox treats around here, yet I just had to resist eating half the pan by myself. I used 10 tablespoons of butter (just over 1 stick) and used an extra few tablespoons of peanut butter. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract.. definitely recommend this. I wasn't crazy about the topping, so next time I think I'll just melt the chocolate with a few tablespoons of butter instead."
"3","5","yum, they taste like reese's peanut butter cups. it's very rich in taste."
"3","5","love these, ive been making them for years and absolutely love how easy and delicious these are!"
"3","3","Pretty good... we liked them."
"3","4","After reading other reveiws, I changed some things. I didn't want a super sweet,greasy candy,so I used 1/2 a stick of butter,and 1 cup of sugar. I left everything eles the same as written. I also microwaved the crust ing for 30 second to help melt the PB since I used such little butter,and that made everything mix very well! This recipe is great!! Its not overly sweet nor greasy due to my modifications,and I LOVE it!! Its just like a resess(sp) cup!! And I'm amazed at the clean cut!! I thought it would be like cutting a cheesecake! Nice recipe!"
"3","5","I made these for my husband for our anniversary and he loved them, thought they were better than a peanut butter cup! Very rich, I halved the recipe to fit in an 8x8, and cut it in small pieces."
"3","5","Delicious! perfect for summer potlucks since you don't have to turn on the oven. 1 1/2 sticks of margarine for the filling was plenty. Great recipe : )"
"3","5","I used 3/4 C. Butter (Instead of 1 C) & 1 3/4 C. Hershey's Mini Kisses Baking Chips (Instead of 1 & 1/2 C. Semisweet Baking Chips). I had a hard time smoothing out the peanut butter mixture, so I took a piece of parchment paper, placed it over the mixture & pushed down & smoothed it out. As I was melthing the chocolate over the saucepan, I put the peanut butter mixture in the freezer for about 5 min. After I poured the chocolate on top, I let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes until it set. Then I cut it into squares & popped it back in the freezer for about 10 min. Then I scooped the squares out & enjoyed! It was a BIG hit. My mom loves Reese's PB Cups, but doesn't like sweets, and she ate about 4-5 squares herself!!"
"3","5","We agree these are better than Reese's. I doubled the recipe and these were very thick- delicious! I also reduced the butter by 1/4 and still was great but figured could've just threw it all in since the calories are crazy-high no matter what."
"3","5","Very easy recipe & tasty!!! Made these for hubby's lunch bucket. I worried that possibly they would 'melt' but they didn't. Held shape & consistency very well. Will be making this again & often."
"3","4","I made these yesterday morning. They were extremely easy to put together. I also put mine in the fridge to set up. No problems with the two layers sticking together. The taste is very good. My only issue with these was the texture of the bottom layer. I was thinking it would be smooth and melt in your mouth. Very good overall! Will make again."
"3","5","Very rich, but delicious! I've made these many times already. The longer you process the graham crackers into dust, the more they taste like Reese's. I like a tiny bit of crunch, so the best combo for me has been to put crunchy peanut butter in the bottom part and only semi-pulverize the grahams, but I still use smooth peanut butter for the topping. Fabulous! Cut them small; it'll make the pan go farther before you're forced to make another batch, and it'll save you from a stomach ache (although that jumbo-size bar was worth it!)."
"3","5","These bars are probably the best no bake cookie/bar that I've ever eaten. They are so easy to make, and taste just like a peanut butter cup! My whole family loved them. I cut the butter down to 1 1/2 sticks, and they turned out beautifully. I will be making these often! Thanks for a perfectly delicious recipe!"
"3","5","Very good, very easy to make. Yummy!"
"3","5","Yum. I cut the amount of butter in half (per Jennifer C-thank you) and used Smart Balance instead. Maybe because the Smart Balance has more water than butter, mine weren't crumbly even with less. These remind me of the Buckeyes (peanut butter balls) my mom makes every Christmas, but with SO much less work. I really like dark chocolate and may use it next time, but it's so good as written."
"3","5","CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME. THE PICTURE THAT SNOWWHITE4 POSTED HOW DID YOU GET THE BLACK AND WHITE SQUARES. I AM THROWING A BLACK AND WHITE BIRTHDAY PARTY NEXT WEEK AND WANT TO MAKE THESE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW YOU DID THEM. THANK YOU."
"3","5","I used Earth Balance vegan margarine, and vegan chocolate and instead of patting into a pan, rolled them into small balls and dipped into the chocolate to coat. They looked and tasted fantastic!"
"3","5","Brought it with us to a dinner at a friends....everyone loved...and I loved how easy it is. Thank you!"
"3","5","I love these!!! I really like Reeses and this came pretty darn close to tasting like them. I will be adding this recipe to the holiday menus."
"3","5","Very good and very easy! I had all the ingredients on hand. I made 1/2 and put in 8x8 pan. Perfect!"
"3","3","Not sure if I did something wrong but we all found these to be awfully sweet and the peanut butter portion a bit on the gritty side from the graham cracker crumbs. Not sure if I will make these again or not."
"3","4","oh my goodness these are good. i have been looking at this recipe for awhile, but finally got around to making it today. i used 1/2c butter as some of the other reviewers suggusted and they turned out great. my only complaints are that one side of the pan has more chocolate on top because of my slanted countertops, but that's not the recipes fault! and it makes the one side of pan that much better!"
"3","4","I thought these were pretty good, but I made them for my boyfriend and he barely touched them. My only complaint was that they didn't stay hard after they warmed up, which I expected they would. Good, but I probably won't bother making again. Thanks :)"
"3","4","Very good and easy to make. I prefer to have a fudgier texture but will make this again."
"3","5","Very yummy! Great for when you need a 'peanut butter cup fix.' My dad said they taste just like the store bought candy, except it's cheaper to make! The PB texture came out really smooth even though it looked 'rough' when I poured it in the pan. I lined the pan with wax paper and stuck the pan with the PB mixture in the freezer while I melted the chocolate. After I put on the choc. mixture I stuck it back in the freezer for 30 mins. and then took it out and cut it with a pizza cutter and stuck it back in the freezer. It set-up nicely and was ready to eat in no time! I put the rest of bars in a container in the fridge."
"3","5","WOW is all I can say! These were so easy to make and taste just like peanut butter cups, which I love. My 6 year old and 4 year old helped out. I followed the recipe exactly except for the following changes: 1)I used Honey Made whole graham crackers chopped finely in my food processor. 2) I took the advice of another reviewer and 'melted' the peanut butter with the butter. The results were fantastic! If you like chocolate and peanut butter, then you will love these. Thanks for the post."
"3","4","Okay, this is a good recipe. It is SWEET and if that is what you are looking for then it is awesome. My family liked them and I will make them again for a special occasion only."
"3","5","A quick, no-bake recipe that everyone loves - perfect! They are very sweet, so I usually cut a 9x13 pan into 24 squares."
"3","4","This recipe was very good - just not what I was expecting. I thought that the base would turn into more of a substantial crust with all the graham cracker crumbs; our bars got a bit melty served at room temperature. Someone even asked me if the base was straight peanut butter. Next time I'll make a graham cracker crust and then add the peanut butter and chocolate layers. Great flavor - they do taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups!"
"3","4","This tasted very good! Next time i make it I will make an extra 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crust and pour it on the bottom of the dish before pouring the graham cracker/butter/ and peanut butter mixter because it needs something solid to hold while eating it. Maybe if I mix it w/ some butter, but not all the other stuff it will work. Also 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips is too much! I'll use 1 1/4 cup next time and I also mixed it with 1/4 cup milk and a dash of butter because simply melting chocolate does not make it poour and coat eell. It has to be mixed w/ a liquid and what I did worked perfectly!"
"3","5","These were really easy and good. Everyone loved them!! Thanks :)"
"3","5","Easy and delicious!"
"3","4","Great, but don't make on a hot, humid day!"
"2","5","Fantastic! It helps to put the graham crackers in a food processor. love love LOVE this recipe!!!!!! It's 10-star worthy."
"2","5","I loved this recipe and am addicted to these! I'm allergic to dairy so I used Earth Balance butter substitute and it came out great. I also used about half the amount of chocolate because the chocolate was just too much the first time I made them. Overall loved them, thank you for sharing the recipe!"
"2","5","Add chocolate chip cookie crumbles at the top...and mmm mmm mmm!"
"2","5","This is my Most Fav Peanut butter & chocolate bar recipe EVER. I had to use chocolate chunks instead of chips but that was the only sub I used. Excellent recipe!!!"
"2","5","I used 1 cup of powdered sugar and added dark chocolate to the peanut butter and chocolate was"
"2","5","its a keeper!!!"
"2","4","Loved the TASTE... but do not use store-bought graham crumbs. WAY too grainy. Blend your own graham cracker crumbs in a blender until it is a fine powder."
"2","5","Mmmm! Almost too good. Note: peanut butter, especially natural, may differ in the oil content and need an adjustment in the butter/margarine ratio. As mentioned in other reviews, be sure to pulverize the graham crackers to a fine powder for the best texture. I find it easiest to melt the butter/margarine and peanut butter together to blend thoroughly and then add the mixed dry ingredients. My adjustments from the original recipe for personal preference include cutting the butter/margarine to 3/4 cup; cutting the confectioners sugar to 1 1/2 cups; increasing the peanut butter to 1 1/4 cup. I triple the base recipe and use 1 1/2 X of the top layer and make these in a 15-1/2” X 10-1/2” cookie pan, and then get them out of the house as soon as possible! I said they are good?. I also use parchment paper to line the cookie sheet and another piece on top of it and then roll it to get the base as smooth as possible, chill the base before spreading the top layer, chill again and then cut into squares. Keep these goodies refrigerated prior to serving."
"2","5","Absolutely love this recipe! We have made it many times and I have found that if i use sticks of real butter and use it soft (not melted), the bottom firms up much better. When I used margarine, the bottom stayed mushy. Also, cool the peanut butter layer for a bit before you spread on the chocolate."
"2","4","The recipe itself was absolutely delicious. The only problem I had was after I had put the pan in the fridge to set, I tried cutting them into bars but they wouldn't come out in one piece. I honestly don't care because they tasted so good, but the presentation wasn't as good as it could of been. Maybe next time I'll try greasing the pan first."
"2","3","The peanut butter never got firm, taste was good."
"2","4","I used Hershey's milk chocolate chips and it was perfect! My 9 and 11 year old love these!"
"2","3","Quick and simple, but I really didn't care for the texture of the graham crackers in these. Not a do-over."
"2","5","They fell in love."
"2","5","Yummy, not to rich"
"2","5","I make these with rice crispier ground up instead of graham crackers for a gluten free option. Use earth balance butter substitute for an equally delicious vegan gluten free option:)"
"2","3","Easy to make & tastes great."
"2","5","This is my go-to recipe when I need to bring a dish to a get together or work pot-luck. They are ALWAYS a HUGE hit and people ask me for the recipe every time. They are pretty addictive though so my only warning is that you will eat a LOT of these ;)"
"2","5","Way better than Reese's! So easy to make too. Thank you for posting this."
"2","5","Wonderful! I let them freeze in the freezer."
"2","5","If you like peanut butter or buckeye balls, this is a great, easy recipe to make. I followed previous suggestions, cutting butter to 1 1/2 sticks, melting it with peanut butter before mixing with graham crackers and powdered sugar. I placed in freezer for 30 minutes to chill. I also recommend cutting the whole pan when removing from refrigerator/freezer. YUM!"
"2","5","Yum Yum Yum."
"2","5","Used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips because it was the only one I had. I think that's 2 cups of chips. Very good!"
"2","5","I'm making these for the first time but I decided to go rougue and add 1/2 c of crushed rice crispies to the 1 1/2 c. of graham crumbs and add a bit of a crunch...the batter was good... ;)... I'm sure they won't go to waste.... Wish me luck!"
"2","5","Very yummy. Only thing I would change is make these in a smaller pan for a thicker bar or double the recipe."
"2","5","Loved it ya great"
"2","5","They didn't make it to the next day! Delicious!"
"2","2","I didn't care for them but then again I do not like gram crackers. And it was very rich"
"2","5","Quick, easy and most importantly its delicious!"
"2","5","Simple and delicious. Will try next time with a little less butter per other reviews."
"2","4","This is a family favorite for sure! I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips. I have also substituted the graham crackers with shortbread cookies."
"2","4","I liked the recipe and it tasted great but 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips sadly weren't enough. I still loved them though."
"2","5","Tastes better then the Reeses cups ! Simply AMAZING !You will not regret trying this ."
"2","1","So unhappy with how these turned out! Even after refrigerating for 24 hours the bottom was stull runny and the top hard as a rock."
"2","3","these are good taste like peanut butter cups I did find it hard to cut after with out breaking off the choc and getting them out of pan even tho I took advice of others and cut them before adding choc"
"2","3","They were gone in a flash, but i did have some problems. The recipe was so tiny that i used a 9x9 instead. Next time I will have to double the recipie."
"2","4","Everyone loved it! I did as others suggested:1&1/2 sticks butter melted with peanut butter on the stove top, 1&1/2 cups confectioner sugar mixed with 2&1/2 cups crushed graham crackers in kitchen aid, then poured butter mix into kitchen aid; also placed bottom layer in refridge while melted choco chips for topping. I used microwave to melt 2 cups choc chips in glass bowl (30 second intervals on high -- took about 90 seconds total) then mixed in peanut butter. spread nicely and no issues with the layers not adhering to each other. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"2","4","My husband has severe nut allergies, so I made the recipe using WowButter instead of peanut butter. WowButter is a roasted soy butter that is the closest thing to peanut butter that I've found. Of course to me, the bars didn't taste exactly like a peanut butter bar should, but they were still very good. My husband enjoyed them too! So if you need an allergy friendly dessert for an event or your peanut-free schools, this recipe tastes great with WowButter."
"2","4","These are much like my peanut butter eggs I make. some times I just make peanut butter cups. I do change the gram cracker out with butter crackers (Ritz) that are not so sweet. Line your pan with plastic wrap it makes clean up a breeze."
"2","5","Yes, made these last nite, and they are wonderful...taste just like a reese cup :) no kidding....but when I make them again, I would do a couple of things different...I would definitely line the pan with either wax paper or parchment paper, and then remove it all and put on counter to cut.....it was hard to cut in the pan, and get it out.....and I would pour in a thin layer of chocolate in the pan first, and put in fridge for about 15 mins. then pour the peanut butter mixture over that, then back in fridge for about 15 mins. then take out and add the rest of the chocolate and spread on top....as I found the top chocolate a bit too thick, so by putting a thin layer on the bottom first, then the top would be perfect and less of a mess eating it.....and you definitely have to leave it in the fridge once you cut it in squares.... but it is well worth making....."
"2","5","Very good! I remember getting these in school For dessert with lunches so I decided to make them and I was very pleased because these are MUCH better. I substituted unsweetened bakers chocolate so the conversion was fun and was a great math lesson for my 9 year old as well. I recommend cooling for more than an hour for a nice firm set. Overnight is good."
"2","5","I really like this recipe, its simple, quick and yummo. i refrigerated the crust part for about 30 min and used a whole bag of chips rather than the 1 1/2 cups which resulted in a thicker layer on top. also i used chunky peanut butter cuz it was what i had on hand, i think actually they turned out better than they would have if i had used smooth because there's now chunks of peanuts in the bars and in the chocolate."
"2","3","I must confess I was tempted to give this recipe 2 stars...I hate it when this happens--everyone loves it but me. I just don't get it---why not just buy a peanut butter cup? Yes, it's a slightly different texture because of the graham...but still...If I'm going to cook, I want it to taste original. That didn't happen here."
"2","5","Me and my kids loved this. We devoured them. Next time though just for my own tastes I'd only put 2 tbsp peanut butter in when melting the chocolate, to give the chocolate more of a chocolate flavor instead of peanut butter overpowering it, since there's definitely enough peanut butter flavor in the rest of the bar. Also, you could definitely get away with using less butter. About 1 1/2 sticks. I froze the bottom peanut butter mixture in the pan for about 3 minutes while the chocolate was melting so by the time I put the chocolate on it didn't mix in with the bottom part."
"2","5","This DOES taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups! It's probably one of the best desserts I've made, and it's so easy. The hardest part was cleaning up the dishes afterwards with melted chocolate and peanut butter all over them. Everything else was a breeze!  I used 1 package of graham crackers and 1 1/2 sticks of butter, as suggested by another reviewer. I believe this made the crust more 'crusty' and less creamy, which was the consistency I was looking for. I wasn't too meticulous about crushing the graham. I just put them into a zip baggie and went to town crushing it with a rolling pin. Even though the chunks weren't all the same size, that really didn't bother me in the end. Refrigerating the final dish is a must. I was nervous about using semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk, but when served cold, it was the perfect pairing. Milk chocolate would have been overkill. This dessert is very rich, very delicious, and a definite keeper!"
"2","5","These are SHUT THE FRONT DOOR good! My BF loves peanut butter and I decided to surprise him with these little cuties for dessert yesterday. He said they were little bites of heaven. Based on the suggestions I: used 1.5 sticks of butter, melted the cup of PB with the butter, refridgerated the crust for about 20-30 minutes before pouring in chocolate mixture, let pan cool in fridge for 45 minutes before cutting into bite size pieces and then cooled another 30 minutes before serving. What I meant to do, and didn't, was use the parchment paper; some of my crust broke (minor pieces) and think using the parchment will help next time. When I cut into the chocolate, I did have a little breakage but once I used a firm smooth cut with a super sharp knife it went fine. Will be using this recipe at many gatherings to come. Thank you Nancy!"
"2","5","I make these for group gatherings (or I would eat the whole pan myself!!) I add chopped nuts to the bottom layer. Also, I line the pan with aluminum foil so they can be lifted from the pan, then they are easier to cut into bars."
"2","5","When I made this I didn't have any graham crackers. I only had nilla wafers on hand so I used 2 cups crushed along with the rest of the original ingredients and it turned out FABULOUS I could have eaten the peanut butter mixture alone it was that good. Great recipe. For the future I think I will use a 9 x 11 pan because I would like to have just a little bit thicker peanut butter mixture but not an 8x8 because that's too thick. Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
"2","5","These were so easy to make and SO yummy! I followed the recipe exactly. However, I layered wax paper in my cookie sheet (first, sprinkle a little water or spray the pan with Pam so the wax paper doesn't move around when spreading the mixture) before spreading the yummy mixture to cool. After they cooled, I lifted out the wax paper filled with yumminess and it was super easy to cut and transfer to a pretty serving platter! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
"2","5","I loved these and they work great for peanut butter cups as well. If I make them in bar fashion I only use about 1 1/2 sticks of butter. I always line the pan so I can lift them out for cutting. I cool the peanut butter mixture about 20 min. then frost them with the chocolate and wait about another 20 min. and cut them so the choc. doesn't crack."
"2","5","This recipe worked great! The top and bottom were both firm enough not to fall apart. I did use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips and it tasted fabulous."
"2","5","I made this for the first time about 18 years ago and it continues to be a favorite of mine. so good."
"2","5","Very tasty, no bake bar! Go ahead and splurge for the already crumbled graham crumbs in the store...it's worth it. Also before putting in fridge, sprinkle tops lightly with graham cracker crumbs for a gourmet look."
"2","5","Perfect! Put wax paper on bottom of pan, mixed chocolate chips & white chips & 2 tbs butter when melting"
"2","2","These taste like chocolate covered butter. I cut the butter to a stick and a half! The chocolate part turned out great. The next time I make these, I will increase the peanut butter amount and use a stick of butter or less. (I used no-stir natural peanut butter and it worked great!)"
"2","5","My son told me about an invitation to go somewhere about an hour before he had to be there - with a dessert in hand. I whipped this up in no time, told the boys to set it in the fridge until they were ready to have dessert, and it was a hit with everyone. Simple, quick, delicious. Fabulous! The next time I made them, I didn't have graham crackers, so I used the buttery round crackers I did have. Still amazing."
"2","2","These for whatever reason did not turn out correctly. The pent butter never sat. I followed the recipe exactly..."
"2","5","Awesome recipe! I have to keep making them for a constant supply for my 71 year old mother! I did increase the PB to 1 1/2 cups for more flavor. I would recomend letting them sit for a day (like that's going to happen!) to let the graham cracker crumbs absorb some moisture, but this is like having a whole pan of Reese's peanut butter cups! Yummmmm!"
"2","3","I'm not very fond of this recipe. I think it was extremely sweet; the amount of sugar called for was too much. I also think the peanut butter-chocolate combination used here was dense and needed something to lighten the proportions."
"2","5","Rich and yummy!!"
"2","5","These were a big hit at a party I hosted recently. Everyone raved about how they tasted like big Reeses PB cups and asked me for the recipe. The other desserts on the table got overlooked next to these.  I only had unsalted butter on hand when I made these and next time I will be sure to use salted. I could tell something was missing. Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Nancy!"
"2","5","I made these at Christmas and they were fabulous. So much so that I didn't put a many in my goodie bags I give away as gifts because I wanted to keep as many for myself as I could!"
"2","5","Perfect, don't change a thing. Make sure to refrigerate the heck out of them as they soften quickly in heat."
"2","5","Very easy and taste very good. I doubled the topping."
"2","5","I love these. There is not a thing to change about them. I could eat the whole pan myself but I have 3 boys so they got most of them. This is definately a keeper and I will make over and over. Quick, easy and delicious."
"2","4","These are very easy to make. I had a little bit of a hard time getting them out of the pan since they were so thick and heavy. Cut them into small pieces as they are very heavy and you only need a couple bites."
"2","4","A little too crumbly, but they tasted great!"
"2","3","The taste is good and very reminiscent of a Reese's, but these bars almost too rich to eat. Our family couldn't eat more than one small serving each. The graham crackers seem a bit gritty even when they are finely crushed. I've made other recipes where the PB is melted in with the butter, which makes the crumbs soften and become creamy."
"2","4","Good stuff!"
"2","5","These were a BIG hit! I wish I had taken a picture, they turned out perfect! I did add 1 1/3 cup of peanut butter vs 1 cup, to have more of a peanut butter taste. People asked for the recipe. I was told the bars took them back to high school cafeteria days, and that their butt and thighs even thanked me!"
"2","5","These were terrific!"
"2","5","awesome comments from others, many request for recipe. K loves them, made for work, xc banquet. Quick-must take out of refrig to let choc come to room temp"
"2","5","Very easy to make and delicious! I made it for Christmas this year and everyone loved them. Will definitely make them again."
"2","5","This is exactly the recipe I was looking for, and it came out just as I expected. It's so simple, it feels weird giving it 5 stars, but it is deserving."
"2","5","These went really fast and got rave reviews at our christmas party!"
"2","4","followed recipe to a T,..these were very tasty, but you can almost taste the butter. will make it with less butter next time (reading through the reviews) they were still gone in a flash though.."
"2","5","These are just like the ones my mom used to make during Christmas when I was younger! Yum! If your base seems too wet you can always add more graham cracker crumbs to thicken it up."
"2","3","It tastes great, however the peanut butter part of this recipe is too wet and did not set very well. I would recommend using half the amount of butter that the recipe call for."
"2","5","I took these to a fundraiser and got great reviews. I did make a small change, I added a quarter of a cup of flour to the crust and baked at 375 for about 10 minutes, then cooled and completed the chocolate layer. They set up well without refrigeration with this change."
"2","5","So easy AND so good!!! I made this as written and loved them. Definitely a keeper."
"2","5","These are truly the best peanut butter bar I have ever tried and so easy to make"
"2","5","My family went crazy for this! I made them for my husbands birthday and within days he was begging for me to make it again. I made it again with some tweaks and added semisweet chocolate chips to the peanut butter/graham cracker base and used white chocolate with 3 tbs. peanut butter for top. Both my husband and step daughter were disappointed and wanted the 'original' The next week I made it again...just like exactly like the recipe with no modifications and they went crazy again. Even this weekend I pulled a few leftover pieces out of the freezer and my sleep over Thanksgiving guests went crazy again! Everyone thinks they taste like Reese's cups. I think they are OK...but everyone else goes nuts for these."
"2","5","I used this as a crust without the chocolate chips....top that with brownies crumbled up, marshmellow, chocolate pudding.....was a BIG hit at the pot luck dinner."
"2","2","I must be missing something here with all the rave reviews. Made these today and they were too soft to even cut out of the pan. Nothing but mush. Was so disappointed."
"2","5","OMG these are great. I followed the recipe exactly the 1st time I made them. The 2nd time I put them in an 7x9 pan for thicker bars."
"2","5","Delicious! I used only 1/2 Cup butter, I think 1 Cup would have made them too greasy. I also had graham crackers on hand that I wanted to get rid of, so I just crushed them. It gave the bars I nice crunchy texture. Super easy and great for potlucks or bake sale."
"2","3","Like another reviewer said, make sure the graham crackers are pulverized otherwise they will give a chunky texture. I used part natural peanut butter and part Jif and only 1.5 sticks of butter. Still had good flavor. I also pre-cut them 10 minutes into the refrigeration process."
"2","5","These were great! Texture was smooth and these were eaten up fast!"
"2","5","This is SOOOOO good. We loved this. The peanut-buttery crust reminds me of a Butterfinger candy bar. The only thing I would do differently (although, hubby said it's grand as is!) is, I would take it out of the fridge 10 minute before serving so the chocolate softens just a tad before cutting. SOOOO good (did I already say that??)!!!"
"2","5","I've made this recipe a bunch of times and I'm never disappointed, everyone who has tried them has loved them! Thanks for it"
"2","5","Soooo good! I made it with 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter as suggested by others. Used milk chocolate chips (Callebaut - the best). I will definitely make these again, so many compliments. They are gooey but stay firm in the refrigerator."
"2","4","Was very good! I made it as written and think I agree that it may have a bit too much butter and powdered sugar originally. Will cut back on them slightly, but overall very rich and tasty!"
"2","5","This recipe turned out wonderfully. Creamy and crunchy all at once. It's too rich not to share though."
"2","5","Yummo! I used dark chocolate chips for the top and reduced the butter to only 1 1/2 sticks. Fantastic recipe, thanks!"
"2","5","These are amazing and great to make with young kids, its so hard to stop yourself from eatin g the whole thing! i love this and its so easy to make, sometimes i add home-made caramel and toasted salted peanuts for that salty sweet combo."
"2","5","These were wonderful! It's become one of my favorite recipes. They are so quick and easy. The only problem I had was they were runny, so 'pressing' them into the bottom of a pan wasn't going to happen, it's more like spreading. Next time I will try using less butter as suggested by another reviewer. I also noticed that for me butter works better than margarine and I used Milk Chocolate. Like others, I kept them in the refrigerator."
"2","4","yum yum I made these today using 3/4 cup of butter because I didn't have enough butter and it still tasted delicious! I also used 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate and 1/2 cup of bittersweet because I ran out of semi sweet. It was so good. I made bars and a few in mini cups and it turned out so cute so I think next time I will make it in the mini cups for presentation and it's easier to eat."
"2","5","a.ma.zing. I got rave reviews. People thought I was so talented. But this recipe is so easy that a monkey could make these treats, which I've seen referred to as Buckeyes. I followed the instructions pretty much verbatim, except that I melted the butter and peanut butter together so that they'd be easier to mix with the other ingredients. Melt in your mouth goodness!"
"2","5","This recipe is great! So easy to make and taste wonderful. Huge hit for our family and fills the need to chocolate."
"2","5","I made these for my niece's bridal shower this past sunday and they turned out great. None left at the end of the party and a few asking for the recipe. I had a little bit of trouble getting them out of the pan...especially those first few...if you have a springform pan..(which i do have, but didn't think of it until after), i think it would be a big help to use one."
"2","5","I would give it 4 stars based on my modifications but thought it unfair given that I didn' t follow the instructions exactly. I can see how they would be terrific with peanut butter and they were super easy to make!  I have a peanut-allergic child so I used sunbutter (sunflower seed butter, available at Trader Joe's and similar stores) instead. The flavor is a lot more subtle, so next time I'd increase the sunbutter and/or decrease the chocolate (scandalous!). Even with the proportions as written, mine did not firm up until I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes. After that I kept it in the fridge and it was fine. I ate about half of it myself :(  Thanks for an easy and yummy recipe!"
"2","4","Hey guess what? No graham crackers? I used plain - PLAIN, NOT Italian, breadcrumbs and it worked just as well. Great recipe for summer! I also had some leftover chips from doing chocolate dipped strawberries, and used that as my chocolate and it worked great. I used an 8 x8 square pan, because I like the peanut butter part a lot. Thanks for the recipe. It's a hit!"
"2","5","I admit I'm usually a recipe 'tweaker', but I followed this ALMOST to a 'T'. I used a little less sugar (not sure how much, no more than 1/4 cup difference) and possibly slightly more graham. And I used more chocolate chips b/c it looked too light to me (I used Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate chips instead of semisweet, so that could be why - used the full bag, which was 1/4-1/2 cup more than called for). Used a smaller dish so it just meant it was thicker.   This was DELICIOUS!!! Everyone loved it and it was ridiculously fast. I whipped it up while preparing the BBQ stuff, let it stiffen in the fridge while we ate, and even everyone who was 'full' from dinner just 'had' to have one... then one more. The texture added by the graham crackers is genius! Really does taste like Reese's. My toddler who is over-skinny and we try to get peanut butter more often gobbled this up saying MMMM, MMMMM!!!!!!.  So, had to give it 5 stars b/c perfect as-is! YUM.  OH, PS - I used a smidge less butter b/c I used natural PB that was a little runnier. So, if you're using natural and you're worried it's too oily, just cut the butter back some and the extra peanut oil will basically take its place."
"2","4","The taste was excellent but the graham crackers gives it a weird texture, even though I used a food processor to grind them up. Not quite the recipe I was looking for but not bad either."
"2","5","SO YUMMY! I made these last night, and they are fantastic! I followed a couple other reviewers suggestions of using only 1 1/2 sticks of butter, and chilling the bottom layer for 15 minutes before adding the top layer. Worked great. I'm keeping these in the fridge since its hot out. My 3 year old had fun making them with me and my husband LOVES them (he is a peanut butter cup fanatic). I even ate one for breakfast :) I am going to make these A LOT!"
"2","4","These are pretty yummy, but they didn't taste like a reese's peanut butter cup to me. Still good thought. Took them to a church potluck and there were none left. An entire pan may be too much unless you plan to share. Make sure your graham crackers are finely crushed unless you like chunks in your bars. Keep refridgerated until ready to eat."
"2","5","These are simple and yummy. Cool them and let them get to room temperature before eating, they are wonderful!"
"2","4","These are very good and the texture is like Reeses Cups. But I thought the chocolate overpowered the peanut butter. I would prefer more of a peanut butter taste. I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan but followed the recipe exactly. Next time I think I'll cut back on the chocolate topping. As some reviewers noted, it is a thin layer but still overpowering, at least for me."
"2","5","OMG, these are sooooo good. Even better than Reese's peanut butter cups, and I love those. I doubt they'll last two days in my house. :)"
"2","4","These were simple o make tand great tasting!"
"2","5","Wow! This was so delicious I couldn't stop eating them. I think I'll add a little bit more graham crackers next time to make it more crunchy but these were so good. I can't wait to make them for a family get together. :)"
"2","5","My husband and I were craving chocolate, but were out of several key ingredients for our old stand-by, including baking powder and brown sugar. I did a quick search on All Recipes, and found this recipe. It sounded like it would hit the spot, and I had everything on hand to make it, so we whipped up a batch. Very easy to make, quick to throw together . . . the hardest part was waiting the full hour till it had set in the fridge! Oh my! They are fabulous! As other reviewers stated, they really do taste like reese's cups! Yum! I made the recipe as stated. I think the only minor change I would make would be to do a full two cups of chocolate chips. The layer of chocolate on top of my peanut butter bars is pretty thin, and I made them in a 9 x 13 pan as the recipe calls for. But that's really a matter of preference. These peanut butter bars are delicious even if the layer of chocolate on top is a little thin! These will definitely be made over and over again!"
"2","5","This was amazing! Serve it cold otherwise it falls apart."
"2","5","I made these for our Easter family gathering and used a metal egg-shaped cookie cutter to keep with the Easter theme. (Of course we just HAD to keep the left-over pieces from the cutouts at home!) They were a huge hit!"
"2","5","Way better then reeses. Very good! I loved them! I could eat all 12 myself! :P"
"2","5","Great recipe!!! My husband picked up cinnamon graham crackers instead of just regular but it came out wonderful just the same. My mother and father in law even went back for seconds!!"
"2","5","These are so delicious and VERY easy to make!!! I reduced the butter to 3/4 cups and they taste exactly the same (with slightly less fat). I let these bars chill for 15 minutes and then cut them into squares. The next morning, they were very easy to cut and remove from the baking pan. I will definitely make these again! Great recipe!"
"2","5","These are SO GOOD! I used 3/4 of the butter as another reviewer suggested. These are really addicting and delicious!"
"2","4","I LOVED this recipe, but gave 4 stars because of the modifications I made to make it allegedly more healthy. 1. Used 1 stick Promise spread, 1 stick unsalted butter. 2. Used 2c ground Fiber One cereal instead of graham cracker crumbs. 3. Used Splenda instead of confectioners' sugar (realize the texture/taste will be a bit off). 4. Used 2c NATURAL peanut butter, and hence, like other reviewers, the mixture was very runny, so chilled for ~1h before adding chocolate. (Would have frozen prior but there is NO room in my freezer!) 5. Also, for topping, used a whole bag of chocolate chips, minus the several that I 'tested', 1/4c natural PB.  It is DY-NO-MITE!"
"2","5","freaking amazing!!!!!"
"2","5","yummy! I halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan, I halved the butter and replaced it with more peanut butter, for the frosting I used 1/4 cup butter melted with 1/4 cup cocoa, 2/3 cup icing sugar and a little milk until spreadable."
"2","4","These were really great tasting and easy. If you want them thick like some of the pictures I would recommend doubling the recipe"
"2","5","These are amazing. They taste just like Reese Peanut Butter Cups, and are so easy to make."
"2","5","very tasty and easy to make. Great way to use up broken or stale graham crackers. I went ahead and greased the pan and they came out perfectly. The peanut butter part was quite runny, but solidified when cooled."
"2","4","Super easy and good! I made exactly as directed. Next time I will try a Milk chocolate chip version and white chocolate."
"2","4","Not my favorite texture - the peanut mix was a little grainy - or flavor - just not quite right - but DH loved them, so 4 stars!"
"2","5","Simple and good."
"2","5","I LOVE the Betty Crocker Reese's Bars, so when I saw this I knew I had to try it. It is BETTER then the BC bars, so good!! They were an instant hit with my husband and son. :)"
"2","5","I've made Peanut Butter Bars for years. The only difference is 1/2 cup + 2 Tbls butter."
"2","5","These are soo good. I am a huge Reece's cup fan and I think these are better!!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I tend to not have all of the specified ingredients (no graham crackers/some butter) on hand, so I work with what I have. I find that almost any crushed up cookie (leftover trefoils, Anna's ginger thins, etc) work very well! I've used as little as approx. 3 oz (3/4 stick) of butter and it still turns out tasting amazing. Sometimes a little crumbly, but it works! You will not be disappointed. Oh yeah - and it is very quick and easy."
"2","4","I followed this recipe exactly and the peanut butter bars came out great. I don't think I got the graham crackers fine enough so there is a coarser texture to the bars than I would have thought. There was also not a strong enough peanut butter flavor for me. Lots of reviews stated these were like/better than reese's peanut butter cups, and I didn't think so. I would make them again and see if I could get the filling texture to be smoother and richer in peanut butter flavor. Overall a great, quick dessert. I loved the flavor combination."
"2","5","Made for Veteran Holiday Celebration and Everyone LOVED! Important to read about melting chocolate if your first time (like it was for me). A learning experience! Read other reviews and used some of their suggestions."
"2","5","These are really good and so easy to make! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of them! He practically ate the entire thing and made me give him the recipe so he could make them for himself too. I've made these a couple of times, and everyone I have shared them with has loved them. These are definitely a hit!"
"2","3","The chocolate was too hard to cut it and look nice."
"2","5","Made these for dessert tonight. You gotta love a recipe that comes together with 10 minutes of prep! The kids loved them. They are easy and delish!"
"2","5","YUMMY! Taste a lot like a Reeses with out all of the extra junk in them and very easy to make!!"
"2","5","Yum! These taste just like peanut butter balls I used to have when I was a kid. Substituted 2 cups crushed rice krispy cereal for the graham crackers to cut the sweetness a little. Also used 3/4 cup butter as suggested by other reviewers. My 3-yr old can't get enough of them!"
"2","4","Oh-My-Yummy!! My only complaint is that I should have made more chocolate because in some areas it seemed a bit thin. Definitely do again!"
"2","3","Just like other reviewers mentioned, this was lacking in some serious peanut butter taste. The 'filling' was too sweet, but the consistency was great. Next time, I will experiment a bit and try to decrease the powdered sugar and increase the peanut butter. I love this idea, but it definitely needs tweaking. Oh and for easy cutting (per other's suggestions), I covered and let chill for 15 minutes, cut, then wrapped and let chill more. If you let chill longer than that, the chocolate topping solidifies and as you cut, it will break and not have a clean line on top."
"2","5","OMG!!! SO GOOD! I normally would make them for holidays but when I am craving Peanut Butter Cups and don't feel like going to the store I will check my pantry for the ingredients and make them!! But if you want a smaller serving cut the recipe in half!!"
"2","5","amazing! don't change a thing!"
"2","5","Mmmm, these were soooo yummy!"
"2","3","Way too SWEET!! Maybe if cut into 1 inch squares it would be tolerable."
"2","4","Really great cookie bar. The pan was gone in one day in our 7 person household. I made the graham cracker mixture entirely in the food processor and melted the chocolate/peanut butter mixuture in the microwave so my prep time was less than 10 minutes. I accidently bought milk chocolate chips. It turned out to be a happy accident, since I'm sure it produced a more classic peanut butter cup flavor. The only problem was getting the bars to come out of the pan. Thinking about setting them on a heating pad for a few minutes to warm just the bottom long enough to allow them to release from the pan, the next time I make them... and there will be a next time!"
"2","2","I found these bland as written. I guess I expected a more intense peanut butter flavor. I used jif creamy, and the one cup of butter. It was far too much butter, since it doesn't add much flavor. The graham crackers also diluted the peanut flavor. Of course, the whole business being cold seemed to make it less intense. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad. They were just less intense than I thought they were going to be. They were definitely easy to make and didn't require cooking, which was good. But after the peanut butter cup description I was hoping for better."
"2","4","Super rich and sweet, tastes better than a peanut butter cup. I think I'll go less on the sugar next time, they were overly sweet. I'll probably halve the recipe too, it makes a lot."
"2","4","Very good! But dont put the metal bowl in the microwave, lol"
"2","4","Too much butter! This was yummy and rich but the crust part was more like peanut butter mush than a 'bar'. In future tries at this recipe, I'm going to halve the butter or at least cut out 1/2 cup of it. Other than that, its an easy, party pleasing recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","My husband will never say that any PB bars are better than his mom's...but these came close. I used non-chunky peanut butter and topped the finished product with chopped Reese's PB Cups...he loved 'em and so did everyone at work. Its a keeper."
"2","5","These are the most amazingly easy and drool-inducing little treats ever! I only used about a stick and a quarter of butter and it still came out fantastic, and way better for you than two sticks of butter. Do place the graham cracker crust in the fridge for a few minutes while you are melting the chocolate, it holds up better once you start spreading on the chocolate. Definitely do what one reviewer suggested and cut the bars about 10 minutes after you started to let them chill, its so much easier than doing it when the chocolate has hardened. (Besides, the knife makes pretty swirly patterns in the chocolate when you do this!) Is a favorite treat of friends and co-workers at the holidays or for pot lucks."
"2","5","Better than a p-nut butter cup! I did make a couple changes. I added crushed pecans to my graham crackers. Also i prefer milk chocolate to semi-sweet so i used milk chocolate chips. Also made a batch in mini cupcake liners in my mini muffin pan."
"2","5","These were very good! Very sweet, I will probably try a little less sugar next time. I just smashed grahams to make crumbs which made it more fun fo my helper! I used only 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and they turned out fine....except the first one out of the pan crumbled so I had to eat it :) All the rest were perfect!"
"2","5","These are so good it's insane. They start to taste even yummier a day, 2 days, 3 days later. Great if you need to make a tasty dessert a few days before company or an event. Even after a few days they still look pretty and are easier to cut, and retain their shape. I made exactly how the recipe called, then the second time I added more chocolate, and cut back on the powdered sugar- still just as fantastic. Kids love them too. I have also made this using almond butter instead of peanut butter, they are good, but not as sinful and decadent tasting."
"2","5","Very good. Very sweet. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the butter to 3/4 cup. That seemed to be the perfect amount. I also chilled the peanut butter base before spreading the chocolate. The texture is a little bit different than a Reese's pb cup, but the taste is spot-on. Mmmmm...."
"2","5","YUM! These tasted awesome, but mind didn't cut well! They are still a keeper!"
"2","5","I love this recipe! I've made it a bazillion times, and it seems that once I make it everyone wants me to make it for their parties too... I sometimes make the bars, cut them, and freeze them in a container separating the layers with wax paper. They thaw perfectly! The only issue I've ever had is that the layers separate when cutting or serving, and you end up having to hold the layers together when you're eating it (which is not a big deal). Has anyone else had this happen, and did you find a way to fix it?"
"2","3","Everyone was right- this has too much butter as written. Very greasy and takes away from the peanut butter flavor. With less butter this would be 5 stars, and many people are giving it 5 stars after they modified it. Do yourself a favor and cut back on the butter."
"2","4","Yummy! As per other reviewers, I cut the margarine to 3/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup peanut butter, and the base held together well. I think another time I will use a better quality chocolate - I agree with other posters that the semi-sweet chips just don't do it justice. You want good quality ingredients in this!"
"2","5","Wonderful! I love what the graham cracker crumbs do for this. Gave the PB layer an interesting twist. So simple to make, an excellent recipe for the children to help with making. The only changes i made was to cut the recipe in half, just to keep myself and hubby from eating so much. Thank you for sharing. I don't think i've had a pb bar recipe like this before."
"2","4","These were sooo goood!!!! They were just like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I cut them small since they were really rich and peanut buttery!"
"2","5","Loved this recipe! Great combination of sweet/salty, not too rich."
"2","5","I loved these! these are the best. Yummy"
"2","2","These were easy to make (although GREASE the pan, I didn't and they pb kept sticking to the pan and separating from the chocolate) although they weren't that amazing. Didn't taste as good as Reese's. Overall, not impressed, will not make again."
"2","5","oh lord, these are so good! just like a reeses! the graham cracker crumbs give it just the right texture too. i think you could get away with a little less butter, because these are seriously rich, but they definitely deserve 5 stars. hubby couldn't stop eating them!"
"2","5","Excellent and easy recipe. I used organic PB (and about 1/2 cup more than called for and added it to the butter to melt-really helped), and only 1 1/2 sticks of butter (didn't miss it). I thought when mixing the crust I should have gone with the full amount of butter, but it came together and held up very nicely. Great recipe-my hips thank you!"
"2","5","I make these every year for the holiday season. This recipe is much better than some out there because it uses less powdered sugar so it's less crumbly and sweet. I always line my pan with wax paper only to make it easier to pull out and cut up. Or using a silicone pan works really well too."
"2","4","Very yummy for the peanut butter lover in your life! I even made using chips ahoy cookie crumbs because I was out of graham crackers. It was just as good!"
"2","4","So easy, so elegant. The texture looks a bit odd when you just have the peanut butter in the pan, but don't worry. Cool the PB or else it may mix together. I marbled in some white chocolate, too, just to elevate it a little - it looked very pretty."
"2","4","Very easy, very tasty. The bottom layer crumbled too readily and was just a bit granular textured, but really a very good dessert for the negligible effort that goes into making it."
"2","5","Made this for work and received rave reviews even from the pickiest eaters. Truly fills a 9x13 generously. Adding the PB to the chocolate chips works well. Once I had the bottom layer in the pan I put it in the freezer to set while melting the chips and PB mixture. Once cool, then added the melted topping and back in the freezer until set. Such a glossy finish to the chocolate. GREAT RECIPE"
"2","5","amazing.........sinful really!!!! sooo easy to make, will make these again, next time i will use less butter and milk chocolate chips :)"
"2","5","These were a huge hit! Will make again!"
"2","5","Best 'peanut butter cup' - like recipe I can find. I get tons of compliments every time I serve this. So easy and quick to make. Definitely 5 stars!"
"2","4","huge hit."
"2","3","We made these 2x this weekend. The first time i only use 1.5 sticks of butter and didn't get the choc. top put on right away. We thought they were dry. The next batch we made exact as recipe said. They need something, maybe a litte layer of Peanut butter between the bottom & top layer ? They were ok. Easy to make. The kids had fun making and eating them."
"2","5","I've been making this recipe for years, but this the first time I've taken a picture and written a review! These are awesome!!! Recipe is perfect as written, they come out wonderful everytime, and they taste just like Reese's. 'Nuf said!"
"2","5","Very very good. Just the right amount of peanut butter and chocolate. My whole family loved them, they were gone in 2 days!"
"2","5","I made this recipe and it was so easy and tasted great I made it according to the recipe and did not change a thing and it was soo good I will be making this again I used a rolling pin to crush my crackers i have made this for a couple cook outs and is always a hit Also i think it is better if it sets over night not just an hr"
"2","5","I made these last night, and my boys LOVED them. The hubby ate so many, and my one year old nibbled on one. My advice is to cut them small, they are seriously rich. Using 1.5 sticks of butter is fine...dont use the full amount, its too much, and will make them greasy. [I've made it both ways]. When melting the butter, go ahead and melt the peanut butter in with it for the crust, then melt the pb with the chocolate for the top as well. Other reviewrs stated to let the crust chill a while before pouring chocolate on top- this is a must!!! Also, cutting after a quick chill of 10minutes is reccomended, as the chocolate will crack if you chill the whole hour before trying to cut. Great bars! Thanks Nancy!"
"2","5","My son and husband loved these....just like a peanut butter cup"
"2","5","These are fantastic! However I changed a lot to make them a little healthier...NO ONE KNEW THE DIFFERENCE! You'll find that wheat bran and wheat germ have a similar texture to graham cracker crumbs, I only used 1/3 cup of graham crackers and topped the rest up with a mixture of wheat bran and wheat germ. 2 cups of sugar is wayy too much, I didn't even use a whole cup, as the peanut butter and chocolate are already sweet enough."
"2","5","Made this exactly as instructed and thought it was AWESOME! Definitely a keeper for our family."
"2","5","These were absolutely so delicious. Use crunchy peanut butter for a tasty crunchy bite!"
"2","5","These are SO much better than even Reese's! One reviewer mentioned processing the graham crackers in a blender or food processor. This made all the difference since doing this gave the peanut butter filling that smooth texture. This is such an easy recipe and was a hit with my family!"
"2","5","AMAZING! we used cheerios because we didn't have any graham crackers, and mashed them up into crumbs (and added a few tblsps of sugar.) wonderful!! the cheerios made the peanut butter part just the tiniest bit crunchy--great either way. will definitely, most definitely, make these again SOON!"
"2","5","I'm giving this 5 stars because: 1. I got up early this morning and drove 3 hours to work. 2. I drove 3 hours back. 3. Made these bars and had every ingrediant in the house. 4. Picked up my daughter from school. 5. Cut these up and put them in cute Christmas bags to be sold a bake sale. 6. Drove daughter 1/2 hour to ice skating rink to practice Christmas show 7. Drove 45 minutes to second job. 8. My daughter and Son LOVED them:) 9. Happy Mom is a Happy house 10. Happy Holidays and thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Oh my...I cannot stop eating this peanut buttery goodness!!! I used milk chocolate with a few teaspoons of butter for the topping, natural crunchy salty peanut butter, and this is so sinfully delicious that my waistline is expanding just thinking about it! MUST TRY!!! LOVED this!! Also super tasty to either layer in pretzels between the pb and choc layers, or jus add some onto the chocolate layer before it hardens. AM-A-ZING!"
"2","5","Very tasty, I used organic peanut butter so I had sit the crust in the fridge for a little while to harden, but it came out great. The kids at way too much of it too fast!!"
"2","5","These peanut butter bars are nice for something different. I will follow Lisa H's suggestion and add about 1/4 cup more of graham crackers for a firmer crust. Also, I melted the chocoloate chips in the microwave for 20 secs. They don't look completely melted but when you them out and stir them, they are melted and smooth. Will make these again!"
"2","5","These were REALLY good! Used about 1/4 cup extra graham cracker crumbs to make a firmer texture. I used crunchy peanut butter in the base, and creamy in the topping. I noticed that when I tried them right of the frige, you could not notice the peanut butter as much. Once they came to room temperature, the flavor was much more intense. With the extra crackers, I had no problem with them being too soft. Give them a try!"
"2","5","These are good, but I did make some modifications. I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup, and melted the PB and butter together. I used graham cracker crumbs that were already crushed (pie crust crumbs). Why anyone would crush their own graham crackers for this recipe, I do not know. =) This modification provided an actual crust, which was very good. I also used milk chocolate because that's what I like. Very tasty!"
"2","5","Made these Satursday for a treat, and teenagers seemed to pop out of the woodwork to gobble them up. I microwaved the butter and pnut butter and melted together and then added the dry ingredients. Popped that into the frig to firm up while I melted the chocolate-- made the chocolate easier to spread"
"2","5","I was worried when I mixed the ingredients that it was too liquidy but it totally solidifies in the frig and was my son's favorite treat all week - he compared the bars to Reese's Peanut Butter cups!"
"2","5","One word: AMAZING. I never usually post a review but these bars are too good not to. In my husbands words: 'the best dessert bar i've ever made'. I took the advice of some and melted the pb with the butter first. I also let it cool for 15 mins in the fridge before adding the chocolate topping. (And used the whole bag of choc morsels) I will definitely make these again and again. Thanks:)"
"2","3","Replaced the butter with more peanut butter and decreased the sugar by half. These would have been way too sweet for us. Followed other reviewer's advice and chilled bottom before adding chocolate. Easy enough to make but they don't hold together very well at room temperature."
"2","5","I've been making these for a few months now. So easy and so gooooooddd!!!! Didn't change a thing about the recipe. Great recipe to have on hand becuase they aren't time consuming and you usually have the ingredients on hand!"
"2","5","i have this one personally in my house and it rocks! and YUMMY"
"2","5","Oh my! Just fantastic. Especially great when pregnant and craving peanut butter!"
"2","4","Yummy. I melted the butter & peanut butter a little, chilled the peanut butter base for 15 mins before topping with choc. Thanks."
"2","4","These remind me of my favorite peanut butter bars that they serve with school lunch way back in the day...yum"
"2","4","I followed the advice of others and popped the dish in the freezer to set the p.b. layer before pouring on the chocolate. The layers set nicely and evenly."
"2","5","These were great! I used 1 stick of butter and only 1 cup of sugar. It would have been way too sweet for me and my husband if I would have used the 2 cups of sugar. I added a pinch of salt to the graham cracker mixture. I also only added a spoonful of peanut butter to the chocolate chips. Next time I think I am going to try melting some Hershey bars in place of the semi-sweet chocolate chips. The semi-sweet was good, but didn't seem quite right. It did sort of taste like a Reese's! Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","These really are great. I was skeptical of using graham craker crumbs but it gave them the texture of reese's. Very easy and rich. High calorie though."
"2","5","These were a flavor explosion! Everyone loved them and wanted more!! I used an all natural peanut butter and it gave it more flavor than the normal peanut butter. I will make these every chance I get! Update: Served these at a graduation party and everyone was following me around wanting more. Two people requested the recipe. I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! ********** :)"
"2","5","This recipe was so easy to make. I made it on the spur of the moment one weekend. As I live in the UK, I had to make an adjustment. I used crushed, plain digestives for the crust. They worked really well and are really very similar to graham crackers. Also, I had some Nutella on hand and added that to my chocolate mixture. A helpful hint...icing sugar is the same as confectioners sugar here in the UK."
"2","5","Tasty! Roommate loved them! Tasted a lot like a reese's peanut butter cup, very rich! Definitely need a glass of milk with these! I made them in the 9x13 pan as noted, but I think next time I will put them in an 8x8 and use less chocolate topping!"
"2","5","Instead of graham cracker crumbs, I used a wheat hors d'oeuvre cracker (what I had on hand). This gave the bars a nice hint of salt, which balanced out the sweetness of the other ingredients. My coworkers raved over these!"
"2","5","Very accurate description...tasted like a giant Reese's cup!"
"2","4","My family loved these bars! They are a simple bar to make if you're in a hurry and everyone loves them however, if you do not store in the fridge they don't hold their form very well and start to melt a little."
"2","5","oh my goodness!! I cannot stop eating these! they are awesome!! so easy to make! next time though, i will cut them into squares after in the fridge for an hour, i waited till the next morning and they were tough to cut! but, I can't complain at all- these are amazing!"
"2","5","Tastes just like a Reese's! You might need to add a bit more graham cracker crumbs, as I did. Just makes it a little more firm."
"2","4","My family enjoyed these, I do think I'd might use less powdered sugar or more peanut butter because I prefer a stronger peanut butter flavor. I think I would make more chocolate for the top also, or maybe a layer for the bottom, freeze and once hardened continue with the recipe as listed. The peanut butter to chocolate ratio just didn’t do it for me. Maybe use less of the peanut butter mixture?? Not sure, but this is a good recipe."
"2","5","This recipe is quick and easy!!!! I LOVE IT! I also melted the penut butter with the butter and I mixed 1/2C of semi-sweet morsels with 1/2C of milk chocolate morsels. Its sooooo GOOOD!"
"2","4","I liked them but did not find them amazing. I also found the peanut butter filing to be grainy. If you like peanut butter cups though, you will like this recipe."
"2","5","Super easy and super good! I followed the advice of a past reviewer and melted the peanut butter with the butter, it made it a lot easier to mix. I also used half semi-sweet chips and half milk chocolate chips for the chocolate layer."
"2","4","Very tasty but needs to be eaten fairly chilled or else they tend to lose shape. Good, though!"
"2","4","My kids loved these and they were easy to make, I felt the butter taste was a bit much and they seemed gritty from the graham cracker crumbs. I might try again and tweak a little bit."
"2","5","WOW!!!!These are so yummy. I'm addicted to them. The crust will seem a little moist but it hardens very well. I also used a whole bag of choc. chips and lots more peanut butter in the choc. chip mixture. They are to die for!!!"
"2","5","These are great. In order to avoid trans fats, I used organic graham crackers and pb. I crushed the crackers in my food processor and then added the rest of ingredients for the 'crust' and processed them all together. This worked very well and probably helped to avoid the gritty problem some people are talking about. I used one stick of salted butter, and one unsalted, in the crust, and this worked out really well too. When I went to melt the chocolate, it was going fine until the very end, when it kind of seized up on me and made it very difficult to spread. This may have been my fault though, because I used just butter instead of pb and milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet, just because I prefer it. They don't look too good, but still taste great. Next time I'll try a mixture of pb and butter in the topping."
"2","5","So so easy to make and the taste is so yummy a real winner.If you love peanut butter you will love these bars.Excellent recipe thanks."
"2","4","I think I'll use less graham cracker crumbs next time. I thought they were a little too gritty. I also used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips."
"2","5","My family and I have been making this recipe during the holidays for well over 25 years!! The only thing we do different is use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. This is a wonderful recipe!!!"
"2","2","I followed the recipe exactly and had trouble with the PB mixture. It was more spreadable than pressable. It finally did harden a bit once refrigerated. I was disappointed when I took the bars out of the refrigerator about an hour later to cut them - the chocolate layer completely seperated from the PB layer. They were a mess to get out of the pan. Maybe I need to let the pan come to room temperature before cutting. Overall, an okay recipe."
"2","4","Here in Belgium, we don't have no graham crackers, so I fix them either with McVitie's Digestive or plain cookies. They're great, and even my sister, who HATES peanut butter LOVED them. Watch out: they tend to be sickly if eaten in large amount (I'm hugely greedy)!!!"
"2","5","These were SO delicious! Mine never got very firm at all and had to be eaten with a fork and kept in the fridge but I didn't even care because the taste was so amazing. I'll just have to keep practicing!"
"2","5","This is sooo easy & my entire family enjoyed them. They didn't last long!"
"2","5","I wanted something quick and easy BUT great tasting. This recipe met ALL my expectations and some. Thank you so much Nancy. I will be making this a lot in the future."
"2","5","So Good, So easy !!! My kids and husband loved this recipe, a must for 'Reese's' lovers."
"2","5","These may be a doctor's nightmare but they are pure heaven. Definitely a keeper."
"2","5","I have a 2 year old and he loves this recipe as does my 22 year old husband. As for me making it is so easy. I looked everywhere for a recipe for these and this was the best."
"2","4","These are so good and quick to make. Taste just like peanut butter cups!! Kids love them (and adults too!)"
"1","2","Didn't like this recipe-"
"1","5","I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter, but these were delightful! I followed the recipe as is and found nothing wrong with them, although I haven't taken more than two or three bites of a small square since I made them. They are so incredibly rich, but good for company. Originally it was my coworker who asked me to make these for her, and for me it was something new to try out in the kitchen. Not only did she thoroughly enjoy these (she says that her family finished all twelve of them in less than a 24-hour period), but when I made these again for my very own family, I nearly had to beat them off with a stick just to get a piece for myself. I wouldn't make any modifications to this recipe except for maybe that's only personal preference"
"1","5","Kids agree this is better than Reeses. Easy and delicious. Cut before refrigerated fully or they become too hard to easily cut."
"1","5","Amazing! I exchanged the graham crackers for almond meal and now it is gluten free; my family loved it!"
"1","5","My 12 year old daughter and I made these....wow!!! Soooooo good!!! The only change was half cup less of the sugar. Will definitely make again (but not too soon because it's easy to devour more than your fair share;)"
"1","5","Put these in the freezer for a summer snack! Really really good!"
"1","2","Although the taste was ok - the peanut butter base was way too soft. Think softened margarine would work better than melted."
"1","5","Let me start by saying this recipe is a crowd-pleaser!Tasty and easy to make. I used a stick and a half of butter. Chilled the crust before the chocolate topping. The downside of this recipe is how to avoid the chocolate from breaking up when cutting into bars. HOwever, after nearly cutting all the bars. I did find cutting halfway into the bars first (a section at a time) helped alleviate the breaking."
"1","5","These work great with Cashew Butter as well...I'm more of a Milk Chocolate fan so I substitute that too. I use the gluten free graham cracker and life is good!"
"1","4","It was a little gritty so I am going to try to experiment with the recipe.Other than that , my family loved them and it's great to do with the kids."
"1","3","I used natural peanut butter for this recipe so I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was (which is very sweet). I don't think it needed all the icing sugar in the base.  Still tasty and makes LOTS!"
"1","4","Just finished this for my friend's son's birthday party. Hope its a hit. Used 1/2 a cup less sugar and added a tblspn of honey 1/2 a pinch of numeg and cinnamon and 1/2 tspn vanilla essence to the base. Used crunchy for bit of bite and for the topping added abt a tblspn of nutella and vanilla and more spice. Tasted soooo decadant. *throws away weighing scale*"
"1","5","Oh my gosh, these bars are SO good! They taste just like a peanut butter cup! Very easy to make. Cut into 2X2-inch squares, these bars go a long way. Definitely keep in the refrigerator, though. Adding to my personal family recipe box!"
"1","5","This was a great, simple recipe! I didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect. Its not very often that a simple recipe turns out so good!"
"1","5","This was DELICIOUS!!! Only thing I changed was that I used Natural Peanut Butter (without the hydrogenated oils) and it didn't end up getting loose and mushy like other reviewers said when they used natural peanut butter. It was perfect!  I have a child who is allergic to peanuts so I also made a half batch with almond butter for her. It wasn't nearly as good, although it might have been because in the almond butter one I also used coconut oil instead of butter... Won't make that mistake again! Use real butter!"
"1","2","I was disappointed in the recipe. The sugar added to the graham crumbs had a grainy taste. Way to sweet. Muffy"
"1","5","This is the first recipe I have tried for my New Years resolution, which is to cook or bake one new recipe each week. I used to have these peanut butter chocolate bars as a kid, our school called them gold bars. They were so easy to make - even I didn't mess it up and I have nearly 0 kitchen experience. I cut the recipe in half and used a smaller pan because it's just me and my roommate eating them. They were as tasty as I remembered! A good start to 2015 :)"
"1","5","Easy, rich and delicious!"
"1","5","These are excellent. I made them after making the homemade peanut butter cups on this site and I think these are much tastier. The peanut butter mixture is the best I've had. I might prefer to make more of the chocolate layer next time, though. Made these for Christmas and they were a hit with everyone."
"1","5","First recipe I have seen with peanut butter & Graham crackers. It's fabulous! Saving this one!"
"1","3","Not enough peanut butter flavour, and the graham crumbs I used made them crunchy. Just an okay bar."
"1","3","The peanut butter bottom got smushy when it became room temperature."
"1","5","I took the bars to a family Christmas party and everyone was telling me how good they are. As others suggested I puts the peanut butter in the fridge for 20 minutes before topping with the melted chocolate. I also put 1/4 tablespoons into the chocolate mixture. Came out perfectly and everyone was asking me where I got the recipe from. This is a keeper."
"1","5","These are great! Nice texture, sweet enough, and my family loves them. Might make them with part milk chocolate next time."
"1","4","With a peanut allergy in the family I decided to use sun nut butter instead. Turned out really good, but the base was rather soft and crumbly. Not sure if this is because of the sun nut butter, or if it would be better to cook the graham cracker base after it is mixed together.  Still, very tasty."
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. They had a very gritty texture."
"1","5","Fun, easy, no bake and taste great!"
"1","1","I did not like these at all. I think it was more the taste of the crumbs that ruined it."
"1","5","I've made this about 4 times in 2 weeks. Everyone loves it! I use the 1 1/5 sticks of butter as well and it's more creamy that way. I also use Skippy Natural in Creamy and it's wonderful!!!"
"1","2","The bars did not taste like ressies at all"
"1","2","Did not care for the texture at all"
"1","5","I tried this with white chocolate and loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","4","Great, kids loved them! What an easy thing to bring to work."
"1","2","Fell apart, tasted too sweet"
"1","5","This was so simple to make and tastes like peanut butter cups. Yummy"
"1","4","Really good. Tastes just like peanut butter cups. I would recommend using A name brand peanut butter for sure:)"
"1","5","My daughter makes these and they are always a hit at every gathering."
"1","5","I have been making these for months now. My girlfriend loves them. I also make them for my fellow employees and they love them as well. I go by the exact recipe when I make them, no more or less of anything from this recipe."
"1","5","This recipe was absolutely phenomenal! The squares were moist and delicious and they were a huge hit! I will definitely make these again. Thanks Nancy!"
"1","5","Ok, so these are CRAZY good! Milk chocolate is a must for a true Resee like experience. And I like to make my own peanut butter. To do this, use 2 cups peanuts in a high speed blender (like Ninja) or a food processor. that way you get no added sugar, or hydrogenated oils!! Just pure peanut yumminess!!! BEWARE!! These are extremely addicting!!!"
"1","5","The only complaint I get is that I don't make them enough. Taste better than any store bought and easy to make."
"1","3","It was good"
"1","5","I thought this recipe was delicious and it's easy to make! I have made it several times now and it was a big hit with the family!"
"1","3","Too sweet for our family including the kids. Great taste, but painstakingly sweet. If I try it again I'll reduce sugar and compensate with more graham crumbs"
"1","5","Absolutely amazing. I made exactly as instructed and everyone loves them. They taste like Reese's. Everyone at church devoured them!"
"1","5","So good and super easy to make!!"
"1","5","Amazing! I was heavy handed with the chocolate on top, thinking that I love chocolate. However, I loved the peanut butter layer so much, I actually removed some chocolate to enjoy the peanut butter on its own!"
"1","5","AMAZING!!!! I can't think of any other way to describe them. They were so easy to make and yes they do taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups."
"1","5","These were really good but very sweet! I did not put the whole two cups of sugar in. I'm not much of a sweet eater but even my daughter said they were really good but very sweet. I would for sure make again for a party.."
"1","5","These are AMAZING! They remind me of the 'Buckeye' bars we had in the schools when I was young. NOTE: they are better when refrigerated overnight."
"1","5","Took these to the office and everyone was singing my praises!"
"1","3","I didn't think these were so good i think there was to much chocolate"
"1","5","I made a gluten free version of this for a dessert table at a party for 30+ people. I used an 8 oz package of GF cinnamon cookies ground up in the food processor. Everyone raved about these and my cupcakes, but didn't even care about the double chocolate brownies topped by a dollop of buttercream frosting. That's how good they were! I cut them into 48 small squares and only had a few left at the end of the party. Be sure to follow the instructions of lining the pan with parchment or waxed paper, putting the chocolate topping on after 20 min in the refrigerator, and then cutting into bars after another 20 min in the refrigerator."
"1","5","I substitute the peanut butter for Trader Joe's Cookie Butter...it's INCREDIBLE! So easy to make and everyone loves it!"
"1","5","AMAZING! I made the recipe"
"1","5","Yum! I used extra chunky peanut butter to add more texture and half milk chocolate half semi-sweet chocolate chips; it came out delicious! Definitely easy to make and perfect for any gathering."
"1","5","I found this to be incredible. I actually did only a half batch in an 8x8 pan. First time ever I ate a dessert totally. lol I cannot wait to make them for my daughter. It is much better then a reeses."
"1","4","I thought the flavor of these was fantastic! The consistency of the bottom crust fell to bits and pieces when I cut the bars. I would recommend adding an egg to help the graham cracker crust form a crust easier."
"1","5","I can't make enough of these for my family. My daughter loves Reese' s Pieces ,and she says these are just as good."
"1","5","Really easy and really yummy! I used the ingredients as listed. I chilled the bottom layer a little too long before topping with chocolate and the first piece I tried separated...maybe bringing it to room temp will make it stick together again."
"1","4","Great taste but likes others have said, use less butter, graham crackers need to be a powder and fridge is a must. Will make again with changes."
"1","4","To make it healthier, I reduce the butter to 2/3 cup. I use only 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 cup honey. and then even add 1/4 cup oat bran for fiber. This recipe is so forgiving that you can even throw a handful of peanut butter Puffin cereal for more texture. Make them into balls and dip in chocolate."
"1","4","Seemed like had a little too much peanut butter. I would decrease a few TBSPs."
"1","5","I could live on these! my family, friends and I loved them!"
"1","5","These are so good. I changed one thing to make them perfect though. I added 2 1/2 Cups of graham crackers instead of the 2 C in the recipe. Some reviewers said they were too greasy or soft. Adding the extra 1/2 C made them perfect. Not too crumbly, not too soft. :)"
"1","5","Just like Reese's! However, I didn't have graham crackers (not to mention they aren't very healthy) so I subbed with club crackers, and the bars were even better than when i made them with graham crackers!"
"1","5","I really appreciated the reviews that pointed out natural peanut butter doesn't set up as well as 'regular'. Mine too are delicious but soft, so now I know why :) I think when I make these again (still using natural) I will make sure it's a generous 2 cups super finely crushed graham crumbs. I may try to reduce the butter but as written, this is really the perfect flavor. Thanks so much for sharing!"
"1","5","Perfect. I added 1/3 cup more graham cracker crumbs. great receipe"
"1","5","I'm crazy about Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, so when I found this recipe I had to try it. It's wonderful! It's so easy to make I had my four year old granddaughter help me. I made it just as the recipe instructed, didn't change a thing. (That's very unusual for me!) if you like peanut butter cups, you're going to love these!"
"1","1","I followed the recipe but the bottom part didn't harden. I also didn't like the grainy texture of the graham cracker crumbs in it."
"1","5","Wow!! Amazing, amazing, amazing!! So easy and so delicious! No need to buy the name brand peanut butter cups ever again. I did melt the butter and the peanut butter together and refrigerate the base for 30 minutes before topping with the chocolate as other reviewers suggested. The result was perfect. Update: These make great peanut butter cups! I cut the peanut butter base recipe in half but did use the entire amount of the chocolate topping. I used regular size muffin cups. I used a very small melon scooper and used one scoop of peanut butter and one scoop of chocolate. Doing this makes about 23 peanut butter cups."
"1","5","I only had 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs and only downsize the butter to 1 stick then added 1.5 cups of peanut butter to make the crust stick together more. I also added about 6 tablespoons of peanut butter to the chocolate. Refrigerator overnight. The cons on this recipes is that it was really hard to cut when it comes out the fridge. Next time, I'll cut them when it's semi-hard. Second, the some of the chocolate broke when I cut it. Third, some of the chocolate separated from the crust. Fourth, need to be kept cool or it'll get soft. The pros are that it does tastes like that peanut butter cup candy, it didn't matter if some broke since I ate them (should move this to the cons), and lastly, it was very easy to make. Everyone loved them. Thanks!"
"1","5","These things are so amazing! Every time I make them they disappear in an instant. They are crazy rich... so you can cut into tiny little nibblet pieces. I suppose the only down size is they melt if left out of the fridge too long so they aren't a god plan for a cookie platter. Oh, and... they take about 10 minutes to make, which is the coolest part...done and done"
"1","5","I made these a few days ago for Easter, and people absolutely raved about them! I put the graham crackers (2 sleeves) in the blender and pulsed them into a fine powder, then mixed in the powdered sugar in a large mixing bowl. I melted 1.25 cups of smartbalance with 1 cup of peanut butter on the stove top and added the mixture to the mixing bowl. After stirring everything together I pressed the crust into the bottom of a 7x11' pyrex pan and put it in the fridge for 25 mins as per other reviews. I melted the peanut butter and chocolate chips together in the microwave (Warning: the peanut butter will easily burn, be sure to mix every 25-30 secs or so) and spread the topping on the crust. After returning the pan to the fridge for 10 more minutes I cut them and returned them to the fridge for 15 more minutes. Thank you for the amazing recipe, this is definitely a keeper!"
"1","4","Made an Oreo cookie crust then added peanut butter mixture & chocolate. Superior! Try it y'all, you'll love it!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe last night and it came out fantastic. My daughter and husband loved it and they said it taste just like Reesie's cups. Will be trying it again for family picnics and barbecues this summer. Thank you so  much!"
"1","5","When I was making this, I found that I did not have any regular chocolate chips. I found some white chocolate chips so I used those. They turned out to be the best bars I have ever tasted and my family raved about them for days."
"1","4","These were tasty, although if I were to make them again, I would use more peanut butter and less butter as I found the base tasted very strongly of butter. I also found the chocolate part did not adhere well to the base and they kept splitting apart when I was transferring them from the pan."
"1","3","Like others, I had a problem with it not 'setting-up' properly. I kept it in the fridge overnight, took it out a few hours before serving, and by the time we were ready to eat it, it was just mush. The reason I gave three stars is because they were good, just too mushy. I might try again with less butter, as it seems those that reduced the butter didn't have this problem."
"1","5","I made it exactly as shown, the whole pan was devoured in a flash!"
"1","1","The graham crackers made it taste gritty!"
"1","5","These are absolutely wonderful! Soooo good, the whole family could not get enough of these delouses bars. Will definitely be making again soon"
"1","5","If you make these, make sure you bring them somewhere where you will be leaving them because if you keep them home you will eat the whole pan! Highly addictive and delicious"
"1","5","Soooo. Goooood. My family thinkgs I'm a baking genius because of these wonderful things, but they were unbelievably, ridiculously easy. I made mine in a quiche pan, so it looked like a giant peanut butter cup."
"1","5","Easy and delicious. What more could you ask for?"
"1","5","Awesome. Don't hanged a thing. But let the peanut butter mixture set in the fridge for a little bit before you pour the chocolate into it."
"1","5","wonderful and easy"
"1","5","I made this for a BBQ & everyone loved them. They do taste exactly like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups! Followed the recipe and had no issues with any of it."
"1","5","In an effort to control our sugar intake, I split the batch and put half in the freezer to take out another time. Well, that didn't help a bit, we just went straight to the freezer for more. Turns out we like them even better that way!"
"1","4","Very quick, very easy to make...just felt it was missing a little something. Will try adding a pinch of vanilla extract next time I make these to kick the flavor up an extra notch."
"1","3","I wasn't wowed - maybe too much dark chocolate - net time 1/2 dark 1/2 semisweet"
"1","5","I used milk chocolate chips."
"1","5","lve the recipe so much.thank you."
"1","5","Extremely delicious!"
"1","5","Made this for my One Act crew from my high school, and they all loved it to pieces and ate almost all of it. I hope to make some more for my band directors and fellow drum majors soon ^-^ This is seriously one of the best dessert recipes I ever came across"
"1","5","Fabulous !"
"1","5","It was fantastic! My entire family said it was better than Reese's, and we are still eating it for breakfast!"
"1","5","I made some..and I didn't even get one. They were all gone within an hour!"
"1","5","I made a half batch in a 9x9 pan. I didn't have the semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand so I used Hershey kisses instead. Everybody LOVED them. The recipe is super easy and the results taste almost like fudge but not as sweet."
"1","5","These are heavenly! I used homemade peanut butter (we ran out of store bought) and they still turned out delicious. My only concern is how I'm going to be able to hold back from scarfing the whole pan before the rest of my family gets to them!"
"1","2","Way too much butter, very heavy"
"1","5","Delicious! I used organic peanut butter which was not as sweet as regular peanut butter. The quality of your peanut butter matters. I used 1/4 to 1/2 cup more graham cracker crumbs as well. I will make this again. My family enjoyed it."
"1","5","Loved this! Followed directions for the peanut butter part perfectly. Made a change on the chocolate part though. Instead of semi sweet chips I cut up approx. 2 cups of Hershey's plain chocolate bars and melted them with 1 tbsp. of butter over low heat then poured and gently spread over the top of pb filling and refrigerated. Perfect for us and will definitely be making this one again!"
"1","5","Love this dessert! Here are some slight changes I made to this recipee: Used 1.5 sticks of butter. Added 1.5 cups chow mein noodles to add the perfect crunch, and the chow mein noodles never went soggy. I did chill the peanut butter layer before adding the chocolate layer, so it would spread better. I think it tastes best to eat the bars at room temperature even though they are softer that way."
"1","5","These are awesome! I made them for a couple different occasions and made some last week. They do taste just like a peanut butter cup. The only thing I don't like is how much butter goes in them, being 4 1/2 months pregnant in all, it cause some heartburn lol, but they were very good overall!"
"1","5","The family loved it, thanks for the recipe :)"
"1","5","Amazing!! Made them just as the recipe said didn't have any problems other than they were eaten too fast. Adding this to the family favorites list!!"
"1","4","We tried this recipe yesterday and it is quite good. My one complaint is that these were thin and somewhat insubstantial. Next time I will make them meater by using crunchy peanut butter for the base - or salted peanut halves - and use a 9x9 so they are thicker."
"1","5","Yep great."
"1","4","These are delicious I don't really care for the dark chocolate so I used white chocolate in one batch and milk chocolate in the other but all in all great"
"1","5","Yum! I didn't have graham cracker so I used pretzels and a little bit of sugar. I also added a little bit of whipped cream and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper, thanks!"
"1","5","I made this recipe exactly as is. Easy, yummy, like Reese's in a pan. Thanks Nancy"
"1","5","Addictive like crack"
"1","5","Delicious, just what I was looking for. Hubby loved it, too!"
"1","5","Thanks for the recipe! This is way easier than forming them into balls."
"1","5","These were a hit but I'm going to try and spray the pan with non-stick spray next time, so it was hard to get them out without breaking them."
"1","5","wounderfully great!!!!!!"
"1","5","As good as the candy bar."
"1","5","I made this recipe a few nights ago. The Peanut Butter bars turned out soooo yummy! A household hit for sure. Thank you :-)"
"1","5","Just made these tonight!!! If you love Reeses...youll love these...I used light peanut butter (like that really made it healthier! LOL!) and ran out of semi sweet chips so used 2oz of bakers semi sweet chocolate with 1c. of chips. The whole family loved it and I will be bringing them home for Christmas!! Chocolate and Peanut butter hard to go wrong with that!!"
"1","5","These are super simple and always a big hit. The only thing I will mention is that they need to be kept cool otherwise they start to melt. They usually go so fast at the functions I make them for that it never really is a problem for me. Definitely recommend!"
"1","5","I absolutely love it! and so does my family. I followed the directions it turned out great! Thank you for posting this."
"1","5","This recipe is simple to make and tastes great! I make it when someone unexpectedly stops by. I always have these ingredients on hand!"
"1","5","These are awesome! They really DO taste like peanut butter cups! They best consistency is room temperature - then you can get the feel of your fingers 'melting' into the peanut butter, just like the peanut butter cup!"
"1","4","I liked this. I would probably use sweeter chocolate chips next time. I took another person's advise in using less butter and kept the rest of the amounts the same."
"1","5","I loved this recipe! It was very quick and easy, and it tastes great! I used natural peanut butter and because of the natural oils in it, I only used 1/2 cup of butter. Turned out fabulous! Thanks!"
"1","4","This is really good as written, but since it was purported to taste like Reeses, and we were hoping it did, we judged it accordingly. It is close. If we hadn't hoped it was like Reeses, I think we would simply love it and adopt it for those rare occasions when we would make candy. The smell is JUST like Reeses. I have a son who loves Reeses (so we tried this to see if it would be just right for his birthday). I think this could be modified to be more Reeses-like, starting with using milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I like the semi-sweet myself, but that doesn't make it Reeses-like, if you know what I mean. There is also a particular flavor in Reeses that comes from corn syrup, so that is a must. Lastly, there is the texture of the of the peanut butter. I have a couple of 'fixes' in mind to try, but I'm not sure if either will work - I'll let you know if I find the 'just right' solution."
"1","5","Unbelievable how good these are. Experiment a bit with the peanut butter/ butter ratio and you will get what you're looking for be it Reese's or more of a bar consistency. Absolutely delicious, and so simple. You wouldn't believe how many more friends I have now that I make these regularly. Now where is my glass of milk."
"1","5","I made these yesterday for a football party. I needed something quick so I just threw these together. I followed others advice and only used 1 stick plus 2 Tbs butter. I used a 13X9 and an 8X8 square pan because I wanted them to cover a platter and I didn't want them too thick,I also sprayed the pan with Pam. I also found out(too late) that I only had not quite a cup of confectioners sugar, so I added about a half of a can of Duncan Hines white frosting. I put these in the freezer for about 45 minutes to firm up before I left and they were perfect. They were gone in minutes and everyone raved about these, they almost couldn't believe that I made them and it only took me a few minutes! I used Jif creamy peanut butter, real butter and good quality milk chocolate chips, maybe the quality of ingredients that some people used made them turn out less than perfect. The texture and taste of these was amazing...Thanks so much for this recipe!"
"1","5","Used natural peanut butter without a problem. Tastes best the next day and each day beyond."
"1","1","I followed the recipe exactly but we found these to be way too rich and the bottom peanut butter part was very crumbly. Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for."
"1","5","Texture of a Reese's Cup and flavor of a Tagalong. YUM!"
"1","3","This recipe has too much butter for my liking...   I followed the recipe measurements exactly. I made the crumbs from a mixture of tea biscuits, oatmeal crackers, and traditional crackers, giving it a crunch texture which   Be aware, When i tasted the warm mixture (prior to refridgerating) it tasted sickly...Too salty, sugary and buttery. I thought something went wrong and was going to throw it out. But thankfully with the chocolate on top and served chilled it tasted much better...  Overall however I would have like it tasting more peanut butter, and less buttery. Despite the above dislikes i couldn't stop eating them, which gave me a queasy stomach for the rest of the day after a few pieces. I read in a review below that you can use less butter which if i make again i will try 1 stick. Maybe melt a few marshmallows into the mix to help it hold together. More peanut butter too."
"1","2","I am a peanut butter fanatic. I make PB cookies quite often, and also buckeyes. I saw this recipe and was so excited. It did not meet my expectations. Not only that, but the bars have sat in the fridge uneaten for almost a week. Will not make again, sorry. Texture was off, and PB flavor was almost non-existent. I don't understand all the high ratings. I can only assume that these aren't big PB lovers!"
"1","5","THIS WAS SO SIMPLE AND DELIGHTFUL MY KIDS AND HUSBAND AND FRIENDS LOVED THEM AND WELL THE 9 /13 PAN LASTED ONE DAY..... EASY AND FROM MAKING ONCE NO THE RECIPE OF HAND..... THANKS A BUNCH NANCY :) AND THEY ARE JUST LIKE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 STARS"
"1","5","Incredible!"
"1","5","Very tasty and very easy to make."
"1","5","This recipe is so good, it is better than peanut butter cups if that is possible! Very easy to make, I babysit my friends grandkids and I had her 12 year old granddaughter make them."
"1","5","Excellent! I did make 2 small changes just to suit my family. We are not huge graham cracker fans, but we do love peanut butter, so I reduced the graham cracker crumbs to 6 oz., and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups."
"1","5","I LOVE this quick recipe. I used honey peanut butter the first time I made these because that's what I had at the time...I think that put it over the top!"
"1","5","Very enjoyable. I used milk chocolate chips because I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips and they worked out fine.  I melted the peanut butter and butter before mixing them together; it worked out MUCH more easily."
"1","5","I've had similar recipes for years, but all the reviews encouraged me to finally make these bars. Three teenaged boys devoured them quickly, though I thought they were very rich and could only eat a small square. Very, very good. I did reduce the butter a bit, and they turned out just fine. I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","This recipe produces terrific peanut butter bars and it is so simple!"
"1","5","Amazing but a little dry"
"1","5","I triple the recipe, and put it in an industrial cokie sheet, and people Love then!! I like to make a lot so I can freeze some and pull them out whenever we want one. Great recipe! Thank you!!!!"
"1","5","I used extra peanut butter 1 1/2 cups for the bar and 5 tbs in the chocolate (for more peanut butter flavor)! HUGE hit ... will make over and over!"
"1","5","Love these!!! I need to cut back these yummy little delights I was eating way too many of them. ;P"
"1","5","Just like the real thing...and super easy too!!"
"1","5","I have been making these for years. The only difference is using whatever chocolate chips I have on hand, and melting them in their bag in the microwave, clipping a corner and spreading on the base. No peanut butter in the chocolate, no bowl to wash!! Thanks for reminding me it was time to make again!!"
"1","5","Very good. Only changes I made were to reduce butter by 1/2 stick and use milk chocolate chips, as that is what I had on hand. Everyone loved them."
"1","5","One word, DELISH! Chill the bottom for about 20 minutes before spreading the topping on it. Also do yourself a favor and use MILK chocolate chips instead. ENJOY:)"
"1","3","really good but i think ill use milk chocolate next time and chill the peanut butter before putting the chocolate on top."
"1","2","tasted great... but they were runny once they came to room temp. I followed the directions."
"1","4","Pretty darn good! Very rich."
"1","4","Very tasty, but my chocolate wouldn't stick to my peanut butter mixture and I couldn't easily get it out of the pan. I think this is due to me using a food processor and blending it too much; I will use a wooden spoon next time."
"1","4","They tasted good, but I had very uneven layers of peanut butter and chocolate in the finished product. Next time I plan to chill the peanut butter layer before topping with the chocolate ganache, and then chill the completed pan again."
"1","3","Pretty good. Made a HUGE batch. Very rich (OMG butter!)."
"1","5","These were beyond awesome, but we thought they could be improved with pretzel or with salt in the chocolate mixture for added crunch and contrast in flavor.  Edit: I added 1 cup chopped pretzels on top - they were delicious. May add a caramel drizzle on top of the pretzel next."
"1","5","Absolutely delish. I made two batches. I ran out of peanut butter for one of the chocolate toppings, so I used peanut butter chips instead. The flavor was not bad, but the texture is too hard. Much tastier with the original recipe."
"1","5","Love it! As a kid of age 8 I’m not too used to cooking but this came out perfect! I let the peanut butter bars cool for 2 hours instead of 1 so you wouldn’t get peanut butter all over your hand and that worked! One thing is that it is real hard to get them out of the oven but even then it’s too good. I will make this recipe again for sure! Thanks Nancy!"
"1","4","As other have said keep refrigerated as they go real soft. These were nice but have sat for near a week in our fridge, so not a recipe I would prob do again. Took them to my grand daughters today for them, just to get them out of the fridge. The taste is nice but very rich."
"1","5","just about the perfect peanut butter bar... so so simple to make... I followed the recipe exactly not problems at all... great recipe if you need a quick bar... not the healthiest in the world that if for sure but what peanut butter bar is..."
"1","5","So good! I used reduced fat graham cracker crumbs, 1 c confec sugar (plenty sweet for us) maybe because I used milk chocolate hershey kisses in place of semisweet chocolate (I had leftover chocolate because I used a smaller pan). I also added a couple of Tbsps of hemp protein powder. I don't know the size of my pan but it's much smaller than a 9X13 and they are a nice thickness. Next time I'll use only 3/4 c butter. They cut beautifully with a dough cutter after a few hours of chilling. Keep them in the fridge for a firm bar!"
"1","5","we've made more than once and are amazing every time"
"1","4","Good. Not quite like Reese's but still very good."
"1","5","Fantastic! Took the advice of one of the reviews and reduced the butter by 1/2 stick. I chilled the PB bottom for about 20 minutes to make spreading the chocolate easier. HUGE hit at our Superbowl Party and could not be easier!"
"1","5","These are amazing, so addictive."
"1","4","Very good flavor. I followed recipe though I halved it so I didn't eat the whole thing. I did spread some more peanut butter on the crust before spreading w/ chocolate as some had noted a lack of pb flavor. Did get crumbly when removing from pan however."
"1","5","My husband just can't get enough of these. Recipe is perfect, no changes needed!"
"1","3","The chocolate layer was so yummy, but we didn't care for the peanut butter bottom. It was very crumbly and way too sweet. I think I may try tweaking it, or put the chocolate layer over another bottom recipe."
"1","5","Crazy easy. Takes 10 minutes from start to finish. And yummy! I used homemade peanut butter and loved it."
"1","5","OMG...these are SO good! I took them to my family Christmas and everyone loved them. I expanded the recipe (about 1 1/2 of the original) and used a mix of semi sweet & dark chocolate (Hershey's) brand chips. It mad the topping a little richer. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","These were a hit with my family! I made a few changes: I added a touch vanilla as well as evaporated milk to the melted chocolate. For the top, I swirled some white chocolate into the still warm chocolate. And, I actually FORGOT to melt peanut butter in with the chocolate, but it still tasted yummy! My family thought it tasted like fudge!"
"1","3","I thought these were ok. I'm a big fan of peanut butter and these just weren't peanut buttery enough! The bars also got quite soft if left out of the fridge, which isn't good for parties when people are grazing all day. So...in a nutshell: These are good, but could be better. :)"
"1","4","I cut mine into 72 pieces. That was about the portion of a mini Peanut butter cup. My husband is a die hard p.b. Cup fan and he loved these. Simple simple simple to do. No cooking. I liked that :). And for the weight watcher folks, if u cut it into 72 pieces, they are 3 pointsPlus values per piece."
"1","5","Love! Didn't change anything."
"1","5","Would give it 10 stars if I could. These bars are AMAAAZING! They were eaten all up at our Christmas party and everyone was saying how yummy they were. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","These are very sweet. Has anyone tried reducing the sugar?"
"1","5","taste just like reeses"
"1","4","My 2 Favorite ingredients. I have the worst sweet tooth and this was rich enough for me! I left one for my husband that said with love from heaven. I used 1 stick and 2 TB of butter and it turned out fine. I definitely have to watch myself with these!"
"1","4","Taste was great we loved them, but the texture og the crumbs and the peanutbutter bottom was a put off for me. Maybe I just didn't make the crumbs fine enough? Though not sure how much finer I could have made them than using a heavy marble rolling pin to crush them."
"1","5","Awesome recipe! This will be replacing Reeses in my home for sure. I made them this morning and my boyfriend has already eaten half the batch! The recipe is easy, and tastes amazing. I followed what some of the other users said and melted the peanut butter with the butter and I used an extra 1/2 cup chocolate chips! Thanks for putting this up, it will definitely be used again and again!"
"1","5","Wow these were incredible. I think anyone who loves peanut butter and chocolate will love these. Also, they were easy to make. Will definitely be making these again."
"1","5","So Yummy just like a peanut butter cup, but tastes way better if frozen."
"1","5","These were very easy to make and tasted delicious! My only complaint with them was that the bottom layer was very crumbly and the chocolate layer on top came off as soon as I cut them. Not sure what I did wrong as I followed the recipe exactly. I guess I will have to make them again to see if I can get it right :)"
"1","5","These are divine!! I was looking for a quick dessert with things I had on hand, and these are AMAZING!! I will be making these again and soon! Thanks Nancy for sharing!"
"1","5","How can you not love these? Sooo delicious!!! I used Ghirardelli 60% chocolates. Came out perfect!"
"1","5","Incredibly simple, hubby's comment was 'Those were amazing.' And he's spoiled to good desserts. LOL"
"1","3","I didnt love these...maybe it was too rich for my liking. I enjoyed the version with cake layer much more."
"1","5","Delicious!! Huge hit at my house! Thanks for the great recipe :)"
"1","4","delicious & easy to make. I would rather have a creamier texture to the peanut butter instead of the graham cracker crumb texture."
"1","3","These taste - and smell! - great. I found the bottom layer to be too mushy. They were fine straight out of the freezer, but that's not a realistic way to serve them if you're bringing them to a party where they're apt to sit on a tray. Maybe I'll try less butter next time..."
"1","5","Better than store bought! Imade a few big pans for Easter and they were a hit. I cut it into candy size pieces because it was very sweet, but overall, it was excellent."
"1","5","a family favorite at our house!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe. My husband loved it also. I put some in the freezer, I am waiting until I see my friend to give her some to taste...We share recipes and I know she will love it also. It was very easy to make and it did taste like peanut butter cups.I would like to give it 10 stars"
"1","5","AWESOME! LOVE THESE!"
"1","4","Super easy to make and very rich. My little cousins devoured them. Great recipe and easier to make then peanut butter balls."
"1","4","Very easy and tasty."
"1","5","Delicious! I will add these to my Christmas cookie making list!"
"1","4","I made these when my cousin was over she raved about them and ate almost the whole pan! i added peanut butter m+m's to make them look better! they are easy to cut and still look nice. Agreat snack for the kids."
"1","5","Wonderful! I can't stop making these bars! I love to freeze them for when guests come over and I have had nothing but compliments. They absolutely 'melt in your mouth' (comment from one of my guests). Thank you for the wonderful recipe, although my jeans are getting a bit tight these days!"
"1","5","Super easy and had ingredients on hand. WE ate in one sitting. Unhealthy, but stress relieving."
"1","5","they do melt quickly at room temp... but ARE exactly like Reese's. Will make again following other reviews and using less butter."
"1","5","SO AMAZING! I am a huuuuge peanut butter and Reese fan and these are awesome!! The whole pan only lasts a couple of days in my house! I do keep it in the fridge though.  THANK YOU for this recipe!!! =)"
"1","5","Very Yummy! and super easy. Melted the chocolate chips in the microwave, only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter. Thanks Nancy!"
"1","5","Yummy as written. Does taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The butter affects the creaminess of the peanut butter layer. SO, yes, it does taste the same with less butter as other reviewers have mentioned. I like the creaminess so I use the recommended amount of butter. Next time, I will reduce the powdered sugar and sub crunchy peanut butter and semisweet or dark chips (or a mixture of both?) in the frosting layer. Really great and easy recipe. Thank you for sharing."
"1","5","These Peanut Butter Bars were absolutely delicious, everyone in my family loved them and they did not last long at all. I will definetely be making them again to enjoy, very addictive and I didn't alter the recipe at all. Delicious!"
"1","5","Perfect recipe the way it is, sublime, thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Incredible, my family begs me to make this."
"1","5","Whole family loves these taste like resees next time I'll put chocolate on bottom, THanks for sharing and God Bless!"
"1","4","Just an FYI, of course these taste great. Little trouble, don't try to cut right from fridge, top chocolate layer wants to crack off. Also, husband took a pan to work, got comments of good, but rich. There were leftovers for the next shift. I'm going back to Monster cookies, they eat the whole batch! Makes me feel better!"
"1","3","Holy sweetness!!!! These are way too sweet for even my sweet tooth! They were good but only a small piece, more than that gave me & my husband such belly aches & sat like rocks in our belly!! They did taste good though, if I do make them again (not sure after such a belly ache!) I would decrease the butter to 1 stick of butter & only 1 cup of confectioners sugar, maybe then they will be good & not overly sweet."
"1","5","These are so delicious that they will make your worst enemy your best friend. I make these when we have company and they never leave the table without complimenting these wonderful peanut butter bars."
"1","5","I'm cutting these into about 72 pieces to make them candy sized, because they're so rich."
"1","2","Tasted good, but the peanut butter/graham cracker mixture would not set up. I followed the instructions exactly, then tried adding more graham crackers, but nothing worked. Will not make again!"
"1","5","Theses were absolutely delicious!!! Will definitely make them again!!"
"1","5","I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips...yummy!!"
"1","5","I made this for my cookie plates at Christmastime. Everyone was raving about how great they were! Good job on this recipe. In order to make the chocolate re-solidify, I added some vegetable shortening. It helps to make the chocolate harder.  I tried to use natural peanut butter with one batch I made. I had to keep them in the freezer. I gave a small tin of them frozen to a friend. They told me they were awesome! :D (Beware, the frozen chocolate cracked randomly like crazy. I only managed a few neat pieces.)  Good luck if you're making it with natural peanut butter!"
"1","5","We absolutely loved these and my son didn't even offer his own sister one tonight....and they are adults. So I am making her family their own batch. Didn't change one thing, didn't need to."
"1","5","Really liked these for a quick and yummy treat! Kid approved!"
"1","5","oh my!!!!!! Amazing!!!!"
"1","5","YUM! such an easy and tasty recipe. I tried with 1-1/2 sticks of butter and had a slight crumbling problem but not so bad to not make it worth while to reduce the butter. We'll have these again!"
"1","5","My family loves these so much! They are super easy to make."
"1","4","These do taste like Reese's Peanut butter cups!! Was so easy to throw together with things you have on hand!! Will be adding these to my holiday trays!! Thanks for sharing your recipe Nancy!!"
"1","5","Delicious! I made these with sunbutter since my son has peanut allergies. Turned out great. My husband loves them."
"1","5","The were wonderfull my husband an kids ask me to make them all the time!!!"
"1","5","Delicious, easy (no-bake), fun to make with 3 year old daughter. Very rich, you may want to cut the recipe in half if you're making these for less than four people.."
"1","5","I cut the recipe in half and put it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out great! I put them in the freezer to make the chocolate harden faster because I was impatient. The next day cutting through the chocolate was difficult because it was just too cold. This is a great recipe for when you want a sugar fix but don't want to make a whole batch of cookies."
"1","5","OMG theese bars are the best thing ever! And so easy! I would bring them anywhere!"
"1","5","These are so easy & delicious.I was able to whip up a batch of these with my 3 month old strapped to the front of me in her Bjorn.No 'cooking' involved,so it was the perfect treat for us to make together.I am pretty sure these would be a huge hit at any party or gathering."
"1","3","It was good, loved the texture..but it was VERY rich."
"1","5","Very easy! I took the advice of others and let the bottom layer chill for 15 minutes before adding the chocolate. Great suggestion, as there were two distinct layers, and the chocolate did not run through the peanut butter layer."
"1","5","Excellent, everyone liked."
"1","5","This was a GREAT recipe! I would not recommend cutting any of the butter tho. The first time I made this I cut the butter to 1 1/2 sticks but it was not as smooth as my second batch with 2 sticks. I did however add a tsp of vanilla to give it a little extra something."
"1","4","I would highly recommend not adding the full cup of butter. I used 2 sticks and the bottom layer was very wet and slimmy :( I will only be using one stick next time, they taste great though - exactly like my mom used to make!"
"1","5","These are so good. Can't make them very often because I can't stop eating them. DELICIOUS!"
"1","4","I didn't care for the taste of the semisweet chocolate chips. Next time I will try using regular chocolate chips and I think it will be 5 stars."
"1","5","Very good and easy! Next time I will grind my graham crackers very fine...its seemed a little gritty. Mmmmmmm...so good besides that!"
"1","3","These were good, but not as good as the more labor-intensive buckeyes I was trying to replicate without all the work. The kids really liked them, including my younger daughter who's not a fan of peanut butter. Mixing peanut butter into the chocolate topping was genius as it gave it a very creamy texture and allowed me to cut it without cracking. One tip: line the pan with parchment or wax paper and just lift the whole block out on to a cutting board for cutting; let it come to room temperature before cutting as it will be softer. Now, if anyone can tell me how to make a buckeye in bar form, I would greatly appreciate it!"
"1","5","This recipe is awesome! It is not only easy but delicious!"
"1","5","Loved these - better than a Reeses and so easy to make!"
"1","5","Delicious!!! thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","VERY tasty! Make a mistake and didn't cut 'em in time so they kinda broke into shards instead of bars, but they were delicious and easy!"
"1","5","These bars taste just like the peanut butter squares I had when I was in school. Delicious!"
"1","5","obviously these are great tasting considering they're comprised of mostly fat & sugar!!!! recipe is simple and its a good dessert that doesn't make you try very hard!!"
"1","3","This just did not seem sweet enough to us. Next time I will use milk chocolate chips for the top layer, and add more powdered sugar to the bottom layer. Not a bad recipe but it needs a little work."
"1","5","Excellent family favorite!"
"1","5","my kids said they 'better then loved' these although one did say they were a tad too sweet....I have 6 kids. I have to agree they were pretty sweet but cut into small squares makes a 9x9 pan go quite a ways and they are perfect for a PB/Chocolate fix though not quite like reeses IMO. This review is from my kids....I would say 4.5 stars myself"
"1","5","These are absolutely wonderful!!!! My family thought they were DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! Besides all that, they are so EASY to make!!!!!!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!! WOW!! These are soooo good and is something that you can whip up in minutes when you need something sweet...."
"1","4","really good,I might put less butter in it next time though ."
"1","5","I need peanut butter daily, but I'm not a huge cookie fan - these are delicous and will definitely satisfy those cravings."
"1","5","Brought these to work and to a school function-they went FAST! I must add they were sweeter than expected, I cut them into small 1' squares so the sweetness wasn't overwhelming. Problem solved-wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","5","So easy, I may make these more often than I should! Yum!"
"1","3","These had a really good taste, but was very dry. I chopped the graham crackers in my Bullet chopper. Which could have made them too fine resulting in needing more graham crackers to make the amount needed. Next time if I use my Bullet chopper I will add in some more butter."
"1","5","Everyone liked these. Hubby made them, he did a fantastic job, too. Used the food processor for the graham crackers."
"1","4","This was very decent as written - 4 stars. But if you really want to take it to the next level, start with the peanut base as written, add a thick layer of melted caramel, chill and layer on double the chocolate topping. Look out - it's a five star ticket to weight watcher's h*ll."
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly as written and was not impressed, nor was my husband. The bottom was gritty, and overall just not that great."
"1","5","These taste awesome! Mine came out crumbly but I did try to use a little less butter. Don't try to cut while they are cold or the chocolate will break apart from the peanut butter."
"1","5","AMAZING! We ate them for days. Absolutely wonderful."
"1","5","These were so good and so easy! I used a 9x11 pan and they came out a bit too thin for my taste so next time I'll be using a 8' square dish to get the thickness of the bars in the main picture. :) So easy it should be made illegal, hehehe."
"1","5","Best bars!!! Everyone in the office loved them. In fact three or four people came in for fourths!! My boyfriend thought the peanut butter part was grainy but personally I loved the flavor and texture! I would not explain it as a peanut buttercup because the peanut butter mix is not smooth but it was awesome and SOOOOOO EASY!!"
"1","5","If I could use one word to describe these, it would be ADDICTIVE! They really are just amazing. The only change I made to this was I took 1/4 c butter out of the peanut butter mix and instead used it to help melt the chocolate chips, and because I didn't have graham cracker crumbs, I crushed up graham crackers, and ended up not crushing them entirely (there were still some chunks, but it only added to the flavor). These are so good, they taste more and more like reese's the longer you have them refrigerated. It's really difficult to leave them alone in the fridge, though, once you've had one, they start looking lonely in the fridge, and maybe if I just cut a little off here, just to even it out . . . before you know it half the pan and a gallon of milk is gone, and you have a tummy ache like your first Halloween that you went overboard on the sweets. (I have no regrets LOL) Thank you for this amazing recipe!!! :)"
"1","5","These were the BOMB!!! I made some and they were gone in 2 days. Making some more to share with my husbands bowling team. A quick and simple receipe I will use over and over again."
"1","5","Yum! I substituted the semisweet chips for dark chocolate, and it offsets the sweetness of the peanut butter mixture very well."
"1","5","Yummy! I didn't have graham crackers so I used crushed animal crackers with a tsp of cinnamon mixed in. I also used 2 cups of chocolate and added 4 TBS of butter to that. So easy to make and so good!"
"1","4","These are really good! Use LESS butter, and added more crumbs. I used a stick and a half of butter, but you could definitely use just one, because I still had to add more crumbs than was suggested. Definitely buy the crumbs, and try not to do it yourself, unless you use a food processor to get them really fine. Keep in the fridge, obviously, or they go soft and the chocolate melt."
"1","5","better than the original Reese"
"1","5","Super easy and better than Reese's! They were a huge hit."
"1","5","Yum!"
"1","5","LOVED these! I thought they are definitely better than Reese's. I am so excited to have found this recipe. Thanks!"
"1","3","These were very easy too make, however, they were way too sweet for my family. I will probably make them again but I will try it with 1 1/2 cups of conf. sugar."
"1","5","There are a favorite of my husband Jonathan. He LOVES them!"
"1","5","Wow and yum! Those words came up often when I served these at a family bbq recently. They are very rich and taste just like a Reese's candy. Like others suggested, I decreased the amount of butter to 1 1/2 sticks, rather than 2. I had to run to 2 different stores to locate graham cracker crumbs, but def. worth it. Some of my family would have liked more of the peanut butter base, so I may try upping that next time. VERY delicious!"
"1","5","OH MY GOSH! YUM! Made them exactly how it's written. Had to give a little away cause me and my husband would have eaten all of these in a short period of time. Next time I will probably freeze some and chop them up and use them in brownies or flurries cause they taste just like Reese Peanut Butter cups but WAY better!"
"1","5","This recipe was down right perfect. It actually was BETTER than reeces, for the simple fact that the chocolate/PB topping taste way better than RPC. You will love this recipe...but be careful. Every time you walk by your fridge you will want to steal another peice!"
"1","5","We love these! I have had a few requests for these since I first started making them about a year ago. Good job!"
"1","5","WOW - Super quick & easy & yes, they taste JUST like the Reese's peanut butter cups. Will definitely become a common treat in our household!!! Thanks so much for the recipe. I did take the advice of another review & cut the butter down to 1 1/2 sticks, and microwave was quick & easy for the top."
"1","5","Followed directions exactly, turned out great! To get your graham cracker crumbs really fine, use a food processor."
"1","3","I wasn't really impressed with the recipe and neither were my guests. It tasted like a brick of peanut butter and chocolate. It was sweet and I love chocolate with peanut butter but it was a little too rich. If you make this make sure to cut into small squares - like you would with fudge."
"1","4","Yummy! Will definitely make these again!"
"1","4","Very good, but very sweet! Tastes just like a peanut butter cup."
"1","4","very easy to make, and tastes soooo good. next time i think i'll add 1/2c more chocolate though."
"1","5","YUM!! My new favorite dessert! The graham crackers make it gritty and delicious. I used half natural peanut butter/half regular and it worked great. They do best cold. Although still delicious at room temp, cold keeps them very firm."
"1","5","So yummy and so easy!! I put it in a 8X11 pan instead of 9X13 because it looked like a better fit... perfect!"
"1","5","These are really, really good! I only had the cinnamon sugar graham crackers so I used those and they turned out great. My entire family ate the whole pan in record time. This is definitely a keeper recipe!"
"1","5","So good! Better than a lot of peanut butter bar recipes here."
"1","5","I only make these for potlucks because I've learned - thanks to my husband refusing to eat peanut butter, I WILL eat the entire pan myself. SO GOOD."
"1","4","Thank you to the reviewer who tried these with just one stick of butter, for my first try I decided to do the same and it turned out so well that I wouldn't make them with more butter than that. It was a bit dry (I used natural PB that didn't have any ingredients other than peanuts, so that + less butter is probably the cause) so I added a splash of milk and it came together well. Such a quick, easy recipe, I used the same bowl for everything so the cleanup with quick as well."
"1","5","wow i love these!!!!! i love this combination! i used milk choc instead of semi sweet... and these went fast!!"
"1","5","I wanted to try a no-bake recipe and decided to try this one because I had all the ingredients and my husband is a bit of a peanut butter fiend. Having read some of the reviews that stated these we better than Reese's peanut butter cups, I didn't think that was even possible (I love Reese's!). I followed the directions and ingredients exactly. To make the graham cracker crumbs I put two packages of graham crackers in the food processer (I think that was about 20 graham crackers) and measured out the 2 cups worth. Its important to have finely crushed graham crackers. I used Jif creamy peanut butter. For the chocolate, I did substitute Hershey kisses for 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips because I didn't have enough, but honestly I loved the taste the kisses gave to this recipe. I refrigerated the peanut butter 'crust' for about 15 minutes before spreading the chocolate mixture on top. These really were better than peanut butter cups. They are soooo good. The only problem I had was the peanut butter crumbling when trying to remove from the pan. I think this could be fixed by pressing it down more with a spatula and lining the pan with parchment paper. I am thinking of making this recipe into peanut butter cups using mini muffin liners. I will be keeping the Kisses in this recipe though, they give it a really good flavor."
"1","5","Yummo, tastes just like peanut butter cups!"
"1","5","These were fabulous and super easy to make. If you love Reese cup's, you'll love these!"
"1","5","My whole family loved this! It's a keeper!!! It was very simple to prepare! the hardest part was tha waiting =D Will make again and again. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"1","5","I made this recipe as-is and it came out wonderful. They tasted just like peanut-butter cups and the crust stayed moist and did not fall apart because it was so dry. My family loved it. This is such an easy and quick recipe I will definitely be making this one again."
"1","5","These are very good. If you decide to 1/2 the recipe, use a 8x8 pan not a 9x9 pan, as they get too thin with a larger pan. will definately make these again & again!!"
"1","5","This might be one of the easiest and quickest desserts I've ever made. To lighten it up, I used two sticks (1 cup) of light half the fat butter with 1 cup of light peanut butter. I also used 1 cup of confectioners' sugar and 1 cup of Splenda and I bet it would work just as fine with 2 cups of Splenda which I will try next time. For more chocolate flavour, I used chocolate graham crackers but I'm sure you could just add a tablespoon or two of cocoa to regular graham crackers for the same effect. I followed other review suggestions of cutting the squares in the pan after 10 minutes of refrigeration and then refrigerating the whole pan for the rest of the time. I cut the squares with a sharp knife which I dunked periodically into hot water. To get more height, I also used a 9 x 9 square pan. I didn't refrigerate the base before adding the chocolate layer. If you cut into 16 squares, with the modifications to lighten up, each square comes out to 225 calories. These squares are absolutely scrumptious and fool proof!"
"1","3","These are good, and I might make them for a kid's party, but they are too sweet for me. They are sugary and crumbly. I'd probably spend more time baking if I were making dessert for adults."
"1","5","Excellent, I took them to a party and everyone loved them."
"1","4","These were SPECTACULAR! The reason i took one star away is because when I cut them they were very crumbly and the chocolate popped off a lot. I will make these again. maybe tweaking the timing of putting the chocolate on. i dunno but the crumbs left on the plate were yummy!"
"1","5","omg! you would not believe the women that are hounding me for this recipe! It is too good. I make it for all the knit nights I go too or if I host a party. They're such a hit and it is easy. If you have a stand mixer it is nothing to make this recipe."
"1","5","Growing up, our middle school had a Peanut butter bar on the a la carte menu... They were so wonderful. These taste the same! I am so excited to finally get it right!"
"1","5","If you want somehing easy to make for your potluck these Bars come out looking very pretty. They really are hard to mess up. Everyone loves them."
"1","1","I'm not sure what I'm missing. Maybe I just had high hopes because of the previous reviews. I made the recipe exactly as listed, and found it to be way to greasy. One reviewer had success with just one stick of butter which might make it a little better. It was edible, but nothing special for me."
"1","5","Easy and awesome! Thank you for sharing!"
"1","5","I usually don't care for peanut-buttery stuff, but these are good and addictive. I melted the butter with the peanut butter and put approx 1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs instead of 2 cups. Popped the pan in the FREEZER for 10 minutes or so, then added the chocolate. After that I let the chocolate harden and cut them in bite sized pieces. Holds together great. For those of you who have trouble getting them out of the pan, dip the pan in warm water for 30-60 secs before cutting;works like a charm."
"1","5","Sooo good. These are so rich and someone else mentioned they do taste like reese cups."
"1","4","These were very easy and my husband, dad and friend all thought they tasted great. The downside is that they are too soft when they weren't straight out of the fridge! Followed the recipe exactly, need to hold together a little more."
"1","4","These tasted amazing! The only thing is i will put less sugar in next time because i could feel the grainyness of it . And also , mine stick to the pan ALOT. And it was really hard o get them out , i had to re-cut them and shoe a kife underneath. Does anyone have a tip for that? Otherwise great recipe !"
"1","4","If u like Reeses peanut butter cups (I do!!!!) you'll love these! They turned out great but don't have as near as much chocolate topping as it has in the picture. Maybe add one more Tbl. of peanut butter and another half cup of chocolate chips...?"
"1","5","Delicious and easy! Love the graham cracker addition to the peamut butter - gives it more texture."
"1","5","i have made these many times for dessert buffets. they always are the first thing to go. when people see them in the freezer (i keep them in the freezer until serving time) they even break into them before i get to put them out. if i have some around, i add a handful of butterscotch chips to the peanutbutter to the melted butter. and if your chocolate breaks (always happens to me), just add a little cream or half and half to it."
"1","5","Super easy to make. I made them in little paper cups and sent them on to school for the kiddies Christmas party."
"1","2","It was very messy. I put it in the freezer so it would have some shape to it. This did not work.It did not have the consistence of bars. It tasted great though."
"1","5","These are amazing! I made about 8 desserts for Thanksgiving and these were the first to go. I put the peanut butter mixture in the dish and put it in the freezer while I melted the chocolate and it seemed to work perfectly."
"1","5","Really great recipe! So delicious! I made these with natural peanut butter and reduced the amount of sugar slightly. My husband thought they were VERY sweet, and I agreed, I think I'd try going down to a cup and a half sugar, and one and half sticks butter too. overall - AWESOME!"
"1","3","These are pretty good. Whatever you do though do NOT melt the peanut butter. It breaks down the peanut butter and makes it 'greasy' and add that to the already too much butter and the crust comes out too 'gooey'. I can't stress this enough... DO NOT melt the pb with the butter. In my opinion the recipe calls for too much butter. I would suggest dropping it down to 3/4 cup of butter. They came out way too rich. Tips and tricks: If you want you can add a couple tablespoons of milk while melting the chocolate to thin it out a bit and it won't make it as rich. Adding peanut butter to the chocolate (while melting) is pointless I think. I didn't add the pb to the chocolate and it came out just fine. Not bad, but if I make them again I will use a few tweeks for the recipe."
"1","5","These are the best !!Thank you !!"
"1","5","Very easy to make and it was so yummy!! I did use 1 1/2 sticks of butter like the other reviews suggested. Will be making this one again very soon. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Really good follow the tips in other review and let base chill for about 15 min. before topping w/chocolate and then chill again for about 20 min. and cut. Chill after that for the remainder. The ratios are good and I would say if you add too much graham cracker or peanut buttter there won't be enough moisture and they will be crumbly. So measure."
"1","5","I've been looking for a peanut butter bar recipie from when I was a child, and still have not found it, BUT WOW, this one is good. Very easy to make. Only problem was I wanted to eat the whole pan. A very simple dessert that will please many."
"1","5","These were great! I made as recipe reads, my kids and hubby loved them. I might add a little more peanut butter next time. They were super easy, no bake, love this recipe!"
"1","5","This is so incredible, and made better only by the fact that they are completely fool proof. I put the peanut butter portion in the fridge while I metled the topping... it was flawless. We let it set and went to town! I can see us making this at LEAST once a week. I cant wait to do it again!"
"1","5","Yummy!!! I tried these out for the first time by making them for my son's football team. My family loved it, suddenly my son had 30 new best friends, and one of the coaches asked my husband if he could ask me out on a date. Ok...so any recipe that would do all that has to rate as a 5 star recipe! I made as is directed and they turned out great! I did put in the fridge for about 10 min before adding the chocolate topping. They cut better if cool but close to room temp. If too warm it gets messy. I stored refrigerated."
"1","4","When non-peanut butter lovers attack these like they are the last morsel of food on the planet, it's a good thing. ;-) The recipe is easy, although pressing the graham/butter/sugar mixture into the pan and making sure it's smooth, took a little bit of time. I took the advice of others and put the crust in the freezer for about 15 minutes prior to pouring the chocolate on, and it definitely made it not sink in to the crust.. yay. In order to cut these so that they are neat, I put them in the fridge for an hour to 'set up'. The only problem with that is that the chocolate topping separates from the crust, when you start cutting them! Yikes! So, the remedy is that after you bring it out of the fridge, leave it out for about 15-20 minutes and then cut. That way, the chocolate begins to soften enough to adhere to the crust, yet isn't too soft to create a messy cut. These are very yummy, but also very rich - so keep that in mind when cutting them into squares. :) Mine were a little bit larger than bite-sized. Picture, added! Oh, and I used 1.5 sticks (3/4 cup) butter instead of 2 sticks (1 cup)."
"1","5","These take me back to elementary school. We would get these twice a week for desert at our lunch. These are wonderful and so easy to make. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Thank you Nancy for the recipe."
"1","5","I have always loved Reeses Peanut butter cups - and these bars are like Reeses Peanut butter cups from heaven. Everyone in the family LOVED them; my Dad said he could eat a whole pan. I've made them twice and they disappear every time. Be sure to pound your graham crackers into very fine crumbs if you like a smoother texture. Awesome recipe!!"
"1","5","Great, simple recipe. I have made with both regular peanut butter and reduced fat. Delicious!"
"1","4","Super yummy! The peanut butter part of the bars came out a little mushy...I would suggest using a little less butter like other people have suggested. That is one reason I gave this recipe only 4 stars...the other reason is that when I was melting the butter in the microwave, I was careless and must have left it in there for too long. As I was taking the bowl out of the microwave, I started to stir it with a spatula and it EXPLODED all over me and the kitchen. My wrist and hand got burned pretty badly. Apparently because of the high water content in butter, it has a tendency of superheating and possibly exploding; especially when using a glass bowl (which is what I used). So please be careful when melting things in the microwave! After the incident, I cleaned up, and kept going with the recipe...taking the bars to a BBQ tonight, hopefully everyone likes them!"
"1","5","These bars are the best! Everyone says they are better than Reese's PB Cups. I was skeptical because im not a Huge fan of graham crackers but they were amazing! I didnt make any changes to the recipe. The Peanut butter this recipe calls for equaled one small jar of PB and the choc chips equal a little less than one bag. I will be making these again. possibly for my christmas cookie trays."
"1","5","Perfect mix of chocolate and peanut butter. Everyone loved them"
"1","4","These are great! So easy and delicious."
"1","3","This was OK. I personally did not really like them. They were just not that PB tasting. That being said, I took them to a BBQ this weekend and they were all eaten."
"1","5","These were delicious! Flavor was good. I would use a little less butter next time. We had to keep them refrigerated because the bottom layer got really soft otherwise."
"1","5","These are awesome but I think next time I will put in a smaller pan to make them thicker! Thanks for posting!!"
"1","5","FANTASTIC! This recipe is easy and great tasting. Everyone enjoyed it."
"1","5","I only had enough peanut butter to make a half recipe. I used 1/2 cup magarine and 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I'm pretty sure that I'll be making another full recipe when I get back from the store. My husband is thrilled with what he called a giant peanut butter cup! UPDATE: I haven't made a full recipe of these bars and I don't think I will. I'm pretty sure my husband would make himself sick if I made a bigger batch. I'll wait for company to make the full recipe."
"1","5","Yumm!! These are much better than Peanut Butter cups."
"1","4","These were very good.Really rich tho."
"1","5","This recipe couldn't be simpler. Followed it as written, but cut the bars into 24 bite-sized pieces, because they are very rich! One note: if you refrigerate them overnight like I did, take them out of the fridge and let them come up to room temperature before cutting into squares. I didn't wait long enough the first try and ended up cracking the chocolate top. Had to eat those, dangit! These were a HUGE hit at 'girls night'. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
"1","4","These were very rich! I definitely cut down on the amount of butter (and obviously still very rich). I took the suggestions of previous users and made sure to refrigerate the mixture prior to adding the chocolate/peanut butter topping. After pouring the chocolate/peanut butter topping, I placed back in the fridge again, but made sure to cut them in very small squares prior to hardening completely. I made these for a cookout the day before; very simple to make but incredibly fattening. Would definitely suggest only make for a large group of people, unless you are looking to gain 10 pounds!"
"1","4","Very good."
"1","5","Made these for a picnic and everyone gobbled them all up! Got rave reviews. So yummy.... just be sure to cut them into small pieces because they're very rich!"
"1","5","Absolutely awesome! It was like a big Reese's cup. I only made half the recipe but still tasted great."
"1","5","Yum Yum Yum!!! These are delicious. I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great!! Heavenly. They are so rich that you only need a small bite so I like to cut the squares very small. Thanks for satisfying my peanut butter chocolate craving!"
"1","5","I modified the recipe a bit due to not having enough graham crackers (added flour til dough was firm) and used semi-sweet bakers chocolate. They were a huge hit with family and can tell I will make this often."
"1","5","When a recipe is this easy and tastes this good, it deserves a 5-star rating. I think you could easily cut back on the butter by 4 tablespoons without altering the taste. As recommended, let first layer chill and harden before adding chocolate layer and cut through topping shortly after hardening to prevent separation of peanut butter layer and chocolate layer. Think I'll try it with milk chocolate morsels next time. Good recipe!"
"1","5","Sooooo good! Super easy!"
"1","5","Delicious! I can't keep my hands out of them!"
"1","4","They were really good but really rich. But very good altogether. I will most certainly do it again and put it in my recipe box!"
"1","4","This is a good recipe but could be better. Unfortunately, I didn't have any grahm crackers so I supstituted it. It still turned out well but it was very rich. Overall a 4 star recipe that I will definately keep :)"
"1","5","Fantastic, Even better than Reese Cups and easy to make. Thank you, Thank You!"
"1","5","Very good!! I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and had to use a smaller pan so they took a bit longer to set up. I also melted the peanut butter into the butter which made my life simpler. I wish I would have cut them before they totally set up though because the chocolate keeps breaking away from the peanut butter. But the flavors were spot on, and VERY VERY easy to make!"
"1","5","Wonderful, the perfect pregnancy bar!!!"
"1","5","Just made some of these and am sampling a piece as I write this...delicious! One hint I've always used in recipes like this is to bang the pan on a countertop a few times on order to make sure the peanut butter/graham mixture is evenly distributed. All in all though, terrific recipe!"
"1","5","These peanut butter bars were so easy to make and great tasting. My family gobbled them right up."
"1","5","These are very addicting! Make sure too keep these in the refrigerator."
"1","5","These were incredible! They were so simple to make and were a hit with everyone who tried them. I think they are better than peanut butter cups. I put mine in the fridge over night and then drove six hours with them in the car. They were perfect!"
"1","5","I made these for a work function and they were an amazing hit! EVERYONE wanted the recipe. I will definitely be making these again."
"1","5","I have been using a similar recipe for years with the exception of adding the peanut butter to the chocolate chips. ***WARNING*** It's best to make these if you are able to share with others, otherwise you will wind up eating most of the pan!!! They are that good!"
"1","5","Like others, I reduced the butter to 1 1/2 cups but followed the rest of the recipe as written. They were very nice texture and flavor - will make them again!"
"1","4","I cut down the butter to 3/4 cup. Next time, I'll cut down on the graham cracker crumbs a little bit, as I'd like to taste more PB. They were still delicious and so easy!!"
"1","4","These were a big hit! I cut them in small pieces because they are very, very rich. Don't know if I will make again, but many people were asking for the recipe"
"1","5","These are soooooo good! They do taste like peanut butter cups. I didn't have enough butter and ended up using about 2/3 cup and still came out fine. The second time I had marshmallows and I melted them and incorporated them in the graham cracker mixture, and still came out really good (still using less butter and in this case also 3/4 cup of peanut butter as well). I've used all types of chocolate with this. Good all the time."
"1","5","I made these and sent them to work with my husband. The office raved about them. Per other reviews, I chilled the base 20 minutes before pouring on the topping, then sliced into squares after about 25 minutes in the fridge. The only thing I will do different next time is let them sit at room temp at least 20 minutes before serving (the base layer is slightly grainy coming right from the fridge), and I will cut them in smaller bars, as they are RICH."
"1","5","Everyone loved these!!"
"1","5","Off the Charts! These are sinfully delicious! They remind me alot of a a Girl Scout Peanut Butter Patty. I think I would double the recipe and put it in the 9x13 pan. Small servings are better because these are rich! Yummy!"
"1","5","Perfect as is."
"1","5","These are easy and excellent. Every time a make them they are a hit! Tastes like a peanut butter cup. It's a keeper."
"1","4","Very good but, in my opinion, a little too sweet. Next time I will definately decrease the amount of sugar AND will make a thinner layer of chocolate. Otherwise it was great and the texture was yummy. I took this to all my neighbors on Fat Tuesday and they all raved about them - PB and Chocolate is a winning combination."
"1","5","Very easy to make and so good! The only thing I did differently was added about 1/4 cup more peanut butter for a stronger peanut butter flavor. Amazing!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS! I used chunky peanut butter since that is what I had on hand. I liked the texture alot and could hardly notice the pieces in the chocolate topping. I did use a mixture of milk choc and semi-choc chips since it was what I had on hand, and I do think the addition of milk chocolate makes cutting into squares easier. Easy, rich, decadent! This is now my go-to peanut butter bar recipe, thanks for sharing!!"
"1","3","I didn't quite care for these. I do love peanut butter and chocolate but they seemed to taste more like butter than anything else."
"1","5","These tasted like Reeses Peanut Butter cups, delicious! Will definatley be making these again!"
"1","4","The bottom (peanut butter mix) part of this was really good and did taste a lot like a Reese's peanut butter cup, but the semi-sweet chocolate wasn't doing it for me (although I did forget to mix in the 4 T peanut butter with it). I will definitely use milk chocolate chips if I make this again. The texture of the peanut butter cup part is really good."
"1","4","If you want your bars to look like the tantalizing featured photo, don't use a 13x9 pan. Go smaller. I used a full 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips (about a 1/2 cup more than the recipe called for) and it was just right."
"1","5","5-star PLUS. I scaled the recipe way back to make a sweet treat just for me! I divided the pnut butter mixture up between 4 paper baking liners and froze for several hours before adding the chocolate layer. Then back into the freezer...just peel off the paper and you're good to go...no sticking or cutting problems."
"1","5","THESE ARE SO GOOD. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN. NO NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING. EVERYONE LOVES THESE."
"1","5","Wow, this recipe is fantastic. I used this recipe for my Christmas candy platters that I hand out to special friends. This is definitely a keeper. Be sure to cut the bars in exactly one hour."
"1","2","I followed the recipe exactly, and it was easy to measure, mix, and chill. But when I took it out of the fridge after more than 'at least one hour' to cut into squares, it crumbled under my knife. The chocolate cracked and separated from the base, and the base itself just broke into tiny pieces. Maybe the graham cracker crumbs were too dry (they had been in my pantry quite a while)? If so, then be sure you use FRESH graham cracker crumbs-- don't let what happened to me happen to you!"
"1","5","I made these exactly as written, with the exception of using milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet & they turned out phenomenal! Better than store-bought PB cups. Better than my old, similar recipe. The chocolate is so creamy with the addition of the peanut butter & using milk chocolate really enhanced this. It's like very smooth fudge on top of a Reese cup center. Definitely helped to melt or at least soften the peanut butter with the butter. Very, Very, Very, VERY good!!! Thank you for posting this."
"1","5","My husband is a huge peanut butter fan but I actually made this for my girlfriends birthday. Both of them LOVED it! It was a huge hit by kids as well as the adults."
"1","4","Very good, but after cooling for 2 hours, they were still coming out of the pan kind of messy and I had to mash them together. I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what caused it. Still very delicious!"
"1","4","I made these for my boyfriend and didn't get a good review. I don't like sweet stuff so I only nibbled one and it seemed fine to me but he only ate one and then hid the rest in the back of the fridge (I think he was afraid to tell me he didn't like them.) He is a fussy eater though so perhaps it is much more his issue than the recipe."
"1","5","Is there a more perfect combination? Peanut butter and chocolate?? LOVE IT. Brought these into work and got rave reviews and some new friends :o) I melted 1 1/2 sticks of butter with the peanut butter to help the sitrring process. I also used 3 cups of graham cracker crumbs and used a 7x11....it doesn't get any easier than this....thanks Nancy!"
"1","5","SO GOOD! Sinful almost :) I cut the butter by 1/4-1/2, which made the crust a little more crumbly, but I could not bring myself to use 2 sticks of butter! I did not have graham cracker crumbs on hand so used Nilla Wafers, which I put in a food processor. Will keep this recipe for sure"
"1","4","These tasted good, but were EXTREMELY crumbly. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, but those were the only changes I made to the recipe, besides chilling the dough for a few minutes before adding the chocolate, like other reviewers suggested. I chilled the bars for about two hours, and when I sliced them, the chocolate broke into pieces, which made it hard to have even bars. The bars didn't have much flavor right after they were chilled, but I liked them a lot more once they had been in room temperature for several hours and the chocolate had softened a bit."
"1","5","Perfection for the sweet tooth!!! I didn't have enough butter. I only used 1 stick melted but not hot. I upped the pb for the crust just a tad to make up for not enough butter. I heated the bp for about 20 secs in the micro just to make it easier to mix and added the 1 tsp. of vanilla others had talked about. Everything worked out just fine. While I was melting a full 12 oz. bag of semi-sweets and the remaining pb I put the pan of crust in the freezer then spread the topping on when it was done melting and refridgerated. Ate about 3 pieces a few hours later and YUM!!! Perfect."
"1","5","A friend gave me this recipe in high school and it's one of my favorites to make. I usually soften the peanut butter for a few seconds in the microwave to make it easier to mix in the graham crackers. You can also try using chunky peanut butter."
"1","5","These are fantastic. My aunt always made these when I was growing up and I lost the recipe years ago. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Excellent!!!!"
"1","4","These were ok, I thought they didn't really taste much like reese's bars though, reese's aren't as peanut buttery they have more chocolate to them. But they guests loved them"
"1","4","These were really easy and yummy. Mine turned out a little dry so I will try less Graham cracker crumbs next time! Thanks for the yummy recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious and rich! The perfect cure for a sweet tooth! I loved the texture the graham cracker gave to the bottom layer. Easy and tasty!"
"1","4","Very Good! I didn't have problems with mixing the bottom layer like other reviews. My peanut butter was room temp and that might help. If you like peanut butter and chocolate anything -- you'll love these! I followed recipe exactly! I cut for the first time after 2 hours, easily came out of the pan. I will keep in refrigerator...it's summertime!"
"1","5","This is awesome. I used skippy natural peanut butter. YUM YUM."
"1","5","These taste just like a Reese's but better! This was very easy to make (no baking) and everyone went crazy over them"
"1","5","These were fabulous. I only used 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter, as another reviewer recommended, and replaced the rest with more peanut butter. I suggest food processing the cracker crumbs for the best texture."
"1","5","Delicious recipe!! We are crazy for chocolate peanut butter in my house - so it was a big hit! Followed the recipe (maybe added a pinch more peanut butter due to personal taste preference) except that I used a slightly smaller pan then 13 x 9. The peanut butter mix was spreading so thin and I wanted it a little thicker. Worked out great. I took other reviewers advice and put the pb mix in the pan and refrigerated for a few minutes before putting the chocolate layer on. I will definitely make this again!!!"
"1","2","I had such high hopes for this recipe. Followed it to the letter. Something just did not work. It tasted like there was too much butter. I did use generic peanut butter, I don't know if that makes a difference. The chocolate topping was good. Threw out the whole pan. :("
"1","5","This recipe takes me way back...when I saw the bars I remember eating them when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember where. While I was mashing up the graham crackers I remembered that I use to get these with my school lunch...it was one of the things I really liked at lunch time. These turned out just like I remembered. Thanks for sharing. Here's a tip, smash the graham crackers in a ziplock bag. Two packs of graham crackers equals about 2 cups. After using the bag to smash the graham crackers use it when pressing the peanut butter mixture in the pan by putting it over your hand so you don't get messy."
"1","4","These were a delicious, but a little rich. I think they needed more chocolate. I agree with another user and next time I'll probably make into balls and dip in the chocolate."
"1","5","Used Smart Balance brand peanut butter the first time, and they were just OK. Used Reese's brand peanut butter the second time and they were GREAT!! Also added a little butter to the chocolate mixture so it would not be so soft. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","As the previous ratings and reviews stated...this is a really great recipe. My family loved these. I was making both lunch and supper for a fairly large group, so I went the easy route and purchsed grahm cracker crumbs instead of crunching them up myself. The recipe called for about a half cup less than the amount that came in the box, so I ended up just adding a little more of each of the crust ingrediants until it was the right consistancy. I put them in the fridge overnight, but let them sit out for 10 mins or so before I tried to cut them. They did not crumble at all and I was able to slice them pretty small (because they are very rich). Yummy!"
"1","5","Wonderfully easy to make and eat! VERY rich, so be careful on portion sizes, but VERY addictive! Definitely melt the peanut butter WITH the butter - you can then mix everything together with just a spatula. Also, use a food processor or a 'Magic Bullet' to make your crumbs, makes them so fine and then they don't add texture (lumps) to your bars. ENJOY! UPDATED: Two sleeves finely crushed is too much ... the bar gets crumbly (but it still tastes great!) I'll update again when I get the mixture right for two full sleeves. :)"
"1","5","SO good and SO easy...Simply the best. I'll make these again and again and again... Update: used Low fat graham crackers, reduced fat peanut butter, and Smart Choice butter blend stix...still very good!"
"1","5","These were delicious! They taste just like Reese peanut butter cups! I think next time I would cut the butter to a stick and a half instead of 2 full sticks and up the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups. Everyone loved these but they need to stay refrigerated so they don't get mushy! Mine got left out at a party and got pretty mushy but everyone enjoyed them anyways!! Will definately be making again!"
"1","5","yummy. so quick and easy. I used 1/4 cup less sugar and didn't miss it. I went ahead and used 12 oz of chocolate and melted just a 1 T of peanut butter in it.  I left the PB mixture in the frig for 15 mins, then topped with the chocolate and refrigerated for 10 more mins. I then cut into squares and returned the pan to the frig to continue getting hard. This kept them in pretty little squares and I will repeat this procedure when making this recipe again."
"1","4","These were great for a fast fix (a forgotten co-workers birthday). Everyone loved them! Very easy - had all the ingredients on hand. I think next time though I will use less Graham cracker crumbs as it was a little too grainy and not creamy enough. After preparing, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes, sliced and then refrigerated."
"1","5","I tried a different recipe before this one and this one is much better! I only had milk chocolate chips, so I melted them with 1 tbs of shortening and only 3 tbs of peanut butter. Delicious!"
"1","5","Living in Korea we can't get Reese's very easy. These were WONDERFUL!!! I didn't have chocolate chips but had white chocolate chips...mmmmmm sooooo good! Thanks for helping us get our Reese's fix! :) I ended up using 1 1/2 bags of chips and used mini muffin papers. Put a little of the white chocolate on the bottom a flattened ball next then more white chocolate to make it more like an actually Reese. I had a lot of peanut butter mixture left over so then I put it in a 8x8 pan and melted a couple Hershey candy bars for the top (added peanut butter to chocolate like recipe says). I liked the white chocolate better. The actually bars were a little too sweet much more peanut butter mixture than the 'Reese' style. Thank you so much!!"
"1","5","AWESOME!!!! Better than Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. I can't stop eating them!"
"1","5","I made these in cupcake cups. Melted chocolate chips and peanut butter chips together and put some in the bottom of the paper cupcake cups, then the graham cracker mixture and topped off with more melted chocolate. They were so good and you didn't have to worry about the peanut butter mixture going soft. Adding peanut butter to the chocolate chips is the reason the chocolate was too soft. All those that tried these said they were great, none but the brave could eat a whole peanut butter cup! They are very rick! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","These were very good and super easy. I good snack when it is too warm to turn the oven on. I was a little nervous after mixing up the base, as it said 'pat' into pan, but my mix was too wet to 'pat', so I smoothed it into the pan, put it in the refridgerator for a little bit & they set up fine."
"1","5","Very good! Made these last Friday. Took some to my parents and saved the rest for me! My bf (who says Reeses are not his favorite) really liked these. I did too, but next time, I will be sure to crush my graham crackers into very fine crumbs to better suit my taste. I was sure I crushed my crackers really well, but I found the bars to have a subtle crunch to them (I am the only one who noticed this, so I guess I am just too picky!). Only modification I made was to sub milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet variety. Prepared recipe to a T with great results. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","They are so easy to make, and will definately satisfy your peanut butter chocolate craving, just make sure your crumbs are very fine, mine weren't and the bar wasn't as smooth as i would have liked, also i added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter"
"1","2","I made this for the first time today. Brought it to a friends house. Everyone there liked it, however I thought it was too sweet and the bottom mixture was mushy. I followed the directions to a 'T' but it just didn't seem right. I put the pan in the freezer to firm it up. Not sure I will try again inspite of the compliments, just didn't settle right with me."
"1","5","i hate graham crackers so i used crushed special k cereal instead so i'd still get the crunch. came out perfectly!"
"1","5","ABSOLUTELY the best dessert ever. If you are hungry for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups these are identical but you get alot more!"
"1","5","Oooh yummie!! I left out the butter and they still held together fine. I made them in a silicone muffin pan (instead of a rectangle pan) and refrigerated them over night. I love the crunch of the graham cracker crumbs. Yum!"
"1","5","I reduced the confectioner's sugar to 1 1/2 cups based on other reviews, and omitted the peanut butter from the chocolate topping. The only mistake I made was in using an 8x8 pan, which resulted in thicker bars. I wouldn't do this again, as I thought it made the bars a little intense. But everyone seemed to love them!"
"1","5","These are highly addictive and SO easy!!! Most of these ingredients we have on hand too.  I would recommend popping the peanut butter mixture into the freezer for a few minutes while you melt the chocolate so that it gets firm and doesn't mix with the chocolate when you spread it on.  These are a huge hit at parties."
"1","5","These were very easy to make and turned out wonderfully. I made them for a bake sale and they were gone quickly! They are very rich, so cut them into small squares."
"1","5","These were great! I didn't have chocolate chips, so I used bakers chocolate instead. I also used natural peanut butter and they turned out fine. I followed the suggestions to chill the peanut butter mixture while I melted the chocolate and it was perfect! Thanks!"
"1","5","Taste just like you said it would! Very sweet! Sticky to make but wonderfully simple!"
"1","5","Yum! Used all natural peanut butter and it's great! Will definately definately DEFINATELY make these again!"
"1","4","Pretty good, but too rich for my taste! If I make next time I will probably leave out the icing."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious, but very rich. They definitely need to go in the fridge for a while to set, but they are well worth it. I think I'm going to use the parchment paper next time to line the pan though."
"1","5","I love these! My little brother asked me if I could make them for his English class! That's really saying something!!"
"1","3","I'd give it five stars for how easy this is, but I wasn't that impressed. Took it to a bbq, everyone loved it, but still had squares left on the plate. I cut them into pretty small squares since they are very sweet. My husband who is a peanut butter chocolate fanatic thought they were 'ok'. Will leave it in my recipe box, but not sure I'll make again."
"1","5","I LOVE THESE!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious. I made half the recipe, as previously indicated by other reviews. The bottom was a little softer than I had hoped. Tasted divine!"
"1","5","Worked really well! Everyone thought this was absolutely delish, so for all the great reviews and how unbelievably easy it is, it gets five starts. I only had 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs, so I subbed 1 cup of corn flakes (processed to fine crumbs). I also used milk chocolate chips. People said it tasted like a peanut butter cup with a crispy texture. Thanks so much! I'll definitely make this in the future. It is popular, yummy, and fast!"
"1","5","Wow!!! These are great!!! Thanks so much. I will make these again and again. I can't believe how much they taste like Reese's Peanut Cups."
"1","5","These were sooo good! They're not as creamy as a peanut butter cup, but they're just as tasty!!"
"1","4","Very easy to make but we thought the peanut butter part had a weird texture--maybe I should have left the graham cracker crumbs bigger. ALMOST tastes like peanut butter cups."
"1","5","Made 1/2 recipe and used an 8x8 glass square pan. Melted butter in microwave in the glass pan. Then added sugar and graham crackers. Used cheap cinnamon graham crackers crumbed in food processor. I put the pan in the fridge while I measured and heated the peanut butter and chocolate chips in the microwave. Seemed it had more cracker base than chocolate topping. Next time I would use a bit less of bottom layer and 1 cup total of chocolate topping. If I was bringing it to company I would have made the 9x13 pan or served it in paper cupcake holders, otherwise the 8x8 size is the perfect dessert just for us -yummy and easy!"
"1","5","These were so delicious and so easy to make! I only made a half recipe, and was a tad short of graham crackers so I used 3/4 cup graham cracker and 1/4 cup saltine cracker. So delicious! Not too sweet this way, the saltines and the sweetness mixed perfectly!"
"1","5","These are delicious! I took them to a party and they disappeared in no time at all."
"1","4","These were definitley tasty- just got a bit gooey at room temperature. The peanut butter layer was more runny than I had anticipated, we had to use silverware! One suggestion, if not the grahm crackers, you could use rice crispies.. I make a similar a recipe in which I use rice crispies cereal and it also adds a nice crunch."
"1","5","All I can say... Mmmmm."
"1","4","These are moist and very good. Even our dog enjoyed a coupld of them."
"1","5","These are so good if you love peanut butter and chocolate! I like to put the pan in the freezer for about 20 minutes or so. Then once you get your chocolate/peanut butter melted when you add it to the base it sets much faster. Plus I love my desserts cold! Anyway you end up doing them... they are delicious and so fast and easy!"
"1","5","So fanfreakin'tastic! Taste just like Reeses. Rich, delicious and totally hit the spot. The only thing that I did different was that I did not add the extra peanut butter to the chocolate. I wanted just a plain chocolate layer on top. What a treat!"
"1","5","WOW...I can't say enough about this recipe, these are to die for! I followed the recipe to the T, except I melted the peanut butter with the butter before adding it to the other mixture. Stuck it in the freezer for a 30 minutes to set up and the bars were perfect!"
"1","5","UNBELIEVABLE! These things are awesome. Yummy and soooo easy. Really, no bake? I thought I was dreaming. I told my friend to open her mouth and take a bite. I gave her a little piece and she shrugged. I told her it wasn't Reese's and she flipped. They taste exactly like the pb cups in the bag but way cooler. :)"
"1","5","My friend makes this all the time. She gave me this exact recipe, then I found it! I have had it tons of times and it is amazing. I still have yet to make it, but I know this is the same recipe she uses. GOOD LUCK! Oh PS- she puts chopped almonds on top:)"
"1","5","My family could not stop eating these!"
"1","5","These taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. They were awesome. Very rich! I was surprised by how easy they were to make. Will definately be making these again!"
"1","5","These bars are so easy to make and really taste like Reese's cups. I crush the graham crackers in a blender or food processor to make the process even faster and easier. My friends all love it when I make these. Even my husband who doesn't really eat dessert likes these. I cut them into much smaller pieces than this recipe suggests. They are very rich!"
"1","2","I have made these twice recently and got the same result both times...they tend to come out with too much of a butter flavor. It was sort of good, but the butter was just a bit too strong. Not sure if reducing the butter a little will help or not! I also agree that it needs to have more of a pb flavor so possibly adding more into the mixture will help with that. Not sure I will make again as I ended up throwing both batches away and it is sort of costly to make."
"1","2","I used to make a similar recipe , since the early 90's. I moved after 17 years and couldn't find my old recipe, and used this one. I was very disappointed in the outcome. It was very grainy and i could hardly spread the topping. After it had cooled, the dessert was 'crumbly' and the chocolate topping split when cutting,despite using a hot knife. Addendum....I just found my old recipe ...I will stick to that one.... thanks anyway"
"1","5","I just left a recipe party where I took these bars. They were the first item gone and everybody raved about them. I found that putting the graham crackers in a food processor really helped to get them to the consistency needed for the bottom layer. Overall, they were a hit!"
"1","5","How tasty and how easy! I was out of butter, so I used Country Crock spread, worked out fine. Also, I used reduced-fat peanut butter and it worked out fine. I opted to microwave the chocolate chips/peanut butter - only had to microwave for 1 minute (stirring after 30 seconds, then again after another 30). I personally love the taste of semi-sweet chocolate, but if you really want these to taste like peanut butter cups, use milk chocolate chips instead. Oh, also I only had to refrigerate these for an hour, then I used a small square cookie cutter to cut out the bars, then cut them in half diagonally to make triangles. You could use any shape of cookie cutter with these: circles, diamonds... but I think too intricate of shapes would be hard (also, you may get a lot of left over scraps if you use circles, but those are for you to eat!)."
"1","5","WOW!!! I've been searching for the perfect peanut butter bar recipe and this is most definately it! The perfect blend of peanut butter and sweetness. As other reviewers stated, I also think this tasted like peanut butter cups, just not as rich, which is just the right flavor for a bar. I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup and it turned out great. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!"
"1","5","My fiance and I loved this recipe. While the chocolate was still warm I sprinkled peanut butter chips over the top to add a different texture. Next time I will try dark chocolate. The semi-sweet was good but it seemed like it could be better. Also make sure that you sift the confectioners sugar. It will get lumpy on you and not mix in well."
"1","5","I made these the other day, and they were fabulous! They taste just like the real thing. Both my husband and children loved them so much the pan was gone by the next day. Great recipe."
"1","5","These are to-die-for delicious! I usually use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet for personal taste reasons and they are a hit every single time. Even my husband who almost never eats sweets will devour these."
"1","5","Ridiculous! If you think you're just going to leave these around the house and somehow manage to control yourself, FORGET IT! The most amazing thing about these bars is how fast they disappear. I used crunchy PB but don't think it made a difference."
"1","5","Absolutely Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, only instead of using a 9x13 pan, I put them into 2 8 inch pans, to make two GIANT Peanut Butter Cups that can be sliced like a pie or cake. Fit perfectly this way. Was really easy to work with considering all that peanut butter!"
"1","5","Not as good as I was hoping, but I think I'll try it again with milk chocolate instead.  EDIT: I made them again with milk chocolate chips... perfect. Just perfect! Everyone LOVED them!"
"1","5","Best I've tasted so far!!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe for kids to help create. The melting can all be done in the microwave. We didn't have graham crackers the last time we made it and used animal crackers instead, it was even better! We may never make it with graham crackers again."
"1","5","Just excellent! Very easy and simple too! What a great recipe!"
"1","5","My chocoholic family loved these! I used milk chocolate in place of semi-sweet but didn't change anything else. I thought the graham cracker crumbs added texture and my family thought I used chunky peanut butter! I definitely like the added texture. These are very rich...almost like a chocolate-peanut butter fudge. And yes, they do taste like peanut butter cups. I'm sure I will be asked to make these often!"
"1","5","I made these as they sounded simple and had ingredients that most bakers have on hand. I also used milk chocolate. They are delicious, even my husband who is not a chocolate fan enjoyed them. My parents also thought they were great. What combination is better then chocolate and peanut butter?"
"1","3","I feel like it's missing something--real Reeses's cups are saltier so may add a bit of salt next time. I think I'd also like to try this with milk chocolate as others have stated. I LOVE peanut butter so will probably try again. Thanks!"
"1","5","These were absolutely wonderful!!!! I used milk chocolate chips and they tasted just like peanut butter cups. These will be a family favorite!!!"
"1","5","Exactly what I was looking for in a peanut butter bar - just like we used to get at school."
"1","5","!!!~wOw~ !!!! Now this is an indulgence one should appreciate. Not only is it super easy but the result is mouth watering yummy! Thx for this Post :->"
"1","5","These taste SO good and are very easy to make. Mine didn't come out of the pan very neatly because I used both low fat peanut butter and margarine, but they still taste great. I'll be making these again. Thanks!"
"1","5","Add a little salt to crust."
"1","5","The only problem I had was cutting through the top layer of chocolate while cutting them into bars, after chilling them. So I set them at room temperature to soften, but then the bottom peanut butter layer was too soft to lift out of the pan, so back in the fridge they went to harden and cut again! Very tasty, though. These are perfect with a cold glass of milk! Yummy!"
"1","5","This recipe is very quick and easy! The peanut butter bars disappear in seconds. Its an all-time favorite. I make it for any event!"
"1","5","So easy...and SOOOO rich! If you are a big lover of peanut butter and chocolate, you'll love this recipe. Make sure you have a big glass of ice cold milk! Oh, and if you like PB a lot, you can up the PB and lower the butter by 1/2 cup with good results. Also, if you are one of those who are having trouble with crumbling of the bar while cutting after refrigerating, make sure you bring the bar back up to or nearly room temp for easy cutting. Update - today I made this recipe with 1.5 cups rolled oats that had been processed fine in a food processor and 1/2 cup wheat bran. Also only 1/2 cup of butter and 1.5 cups PB. And only 1 cup of choc. chips. Very good results, mildly healthier."
"1","3","I thought the strong butter flavor and odd flavor of the graham crackers were too much, but my friend loved them."
"1","5","Very easy and tasty. The only problem I had was that I didn't get my graham cracker crumbs fine enough, and so there were chunks in it, but it still tasted great. Does get a little soft unrefridgerated."
"1","5","Excellent treat! Quick and easy to make. :)"
"1","4","Just like a peanut butter cup! A little on the sweet side, but very good."
"1","5","Yummmy! i used a whole bag of chips though!"
"1","5","Delicious! I sold them at a bake sale and they were sold out within a half hour! Definitely recommended!"
"1","5","I'm dishing out 5 stars for this one! Super easy and extremely good, especially if you're a fan of Reese's cups- they're just like them... in square form. If you're not much of a baker, you can't go wrong here- they taste like way more work. Yum! (Oh, and I keep them refrigerated... they do get a bit melty at room temp. Not that I still wouldn't eat them.)"
"1","5","These are very good !! Easy to make and they taste delicious when you are done !! Much easier to make than 'buckeyes' at Christmas time. I will gladly make these instead !!!! I made a double recipe and had some leftover. I froze them in the freezer like I do the peanut butter cups !! I'm sure they will taste wonderful !!"
"1","5","WOW!!!! I ran across this recipe and had to try it right away to see if they really are like Reese Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite), and they didn't disappoint! Amazing likeness except with a little less chocolate. But great nevertheless! So easy to make and I had all the ingredients already on hand (except that I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet). Thanks so much -- this will be a definite favorite! I can't wait to make some for my mom, also a peanut butter-and-chocolate fanatic."
"1","5","Oh my gosh! These are sooooo yummy!!! They're super-easy to make, too. They taste just like a Reece's Peanut Butter Cup. Wow. These are a definite keeper."
"1","5","Incredibly easy to make and yummy too! Depending on how goopy your peanut butter is, use between 2-3 cups of graham crackers, adding a little at a time after the first two cups until the mixture is easy to spread and not so sticky."
"1","5","Oh my! These ARE peanut butter cups in a pan! Peanut butter cups are an all-time favorite of mine and this is a fabulous re-creation! It's so hard to eat just one!!!!!"
"1","5","This is a great and quick recipe!! I recommend it to everyone!! You will be amazed how much it tastes like the big brand name peanut butter cups!!"
"1","5","Very easy and delicious..."
"1","5","Very quick to make, great tasting."
"0","5","The Peanut butter bars were delicious and easy to make! I love non baking sweets!!"
"0","3","Where's the taste? Where's the flavor? I followed the recipe, but I find that they have no taste. They're not even sweet. What a disappointment."
"0","3","The base layer was extremely soft however. I added an extra half cup of crumbs as I knew that it was too runny, and that still wasn't enough. I will try this recipe again, but will try not melting the butter? It is definitely worth another chance due to the similar taste to Reese peanut butter cups ...."
"0","5","Sweet, peanut buttery, and awesome. A most excellent dessert if you like peanut butter cups."
"0","5","Really good, the changes I made was to use butter flavored shortening and to set it I put it in the freezer."
"0","4","They don't taste like peanut butter cups but they're still awesome. I would def. make them again!"
"0","5","Really good and easy. I refrigerated the tray after adding the chocolate, and when the chocolate hardened I found I had to let it come back to room temp. before cutting it into squares or the chocolate would crack. Everyone loved it though. I will be adding this to my Christmas treats list. Thank you for a great recipe."
"0","4","Love these! Question though, does anyone have any tips to keep the bars more together? The peanut butter part seems to break apart and not stay in a firm bar."
"0","5","All I had was cinnamon graham crackers and they turned out amazing!!! My co-workers enjoyed it!"
"0","4","Taking the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the butter to 1.5 sticks, with excellent results. I also chilled the bottom layer for an hour before spreading the chocolate mixture on top. But first, I lined the inside of my pan with foil to create a sling. When the bars were done chilling, I lifted the whole thing out of the pan using the foil sling. Made it SO EASY to cut nice, neat squares."
"0","4","Bars were very good , but the bottom was way too soft. I decreased the butter to 1 1/2 cups of butter, they were much better!"
"0","5","They taste super good! Just like Reese's if anything better!"
"0","5","These are amazing and always a big hit when I make them! Is it possible they somehow taste even more like famous-brand peanut butter cups than famous-brand peanut butter cups do?"
"0","2","Did not turn out very creamy. Rather dry, not crumbly, just dry. I made it exactly as written. Will not make again."
"0","5","Soooooooooooo gooooooooood!!! My family loved them. I did make them in a 8x8 dish so they were thick but still amazing. I'll definably try using Reese's peanut butter next time. Awesome with jiffy to"
"0","4","One and a half sticks of butter was PLENTY! I also substituted ritz crackers for gram crackers and it turned out fine. 2 cups of sugar seemed slightly outrageous so I only used 1 which also worked well. Not sure what size pan you used but I used a 9in and they were kind of thin so I suggest an 8in pan. Great recipe!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe for chocolate covered peanut butter bars. I made it as the recipe states, with the exception of using low sodium peanut butter. I'll be making these again in the future."
"0","2","I was not all that impressed with this recipe. It was a bit too sweet and not peanut buttery enough. Plus, the texture was not firm enough, so not long after it was out of the fridge it was turning very soft and the topping even melted. It was a very warm day, so may be better in the winter, but for a back yard summer time thing I would not make it again."
"0","5","These taste just like Resses peanut butter cups! I used all natural nut butter and they still turned out awesome! They are so rich and tasty, my peanut-butter-loving husband raved about them."
"0","5","Like a dark chocolate Reese's bar."
"0","5","Wonderful, refreshing and nice to make on a hot day! My family loved this!"
"0","5","Delicios!"
"0","5","One of the boys favorites!"
"0","5","These were delicious!Easy and quick to make - and so very yummy. Here's what I did after reading reviews (one of my favorite things about allrecipes!!): used coconut oil instead of butter, and I did use 1 full cup. I melted the coconut oil with the PB. I ground (very fine in the food processor) some toasted whole grain oats, probably about 1/4 to 1/2 cup, to bring the graham crackers to 2 cups. I also ground the graham crackers really fine as recommended by others. I added a pinch of salt, and used only 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar (and honestly they were still a bit sweet for my taste - I will try next time with less and get back to you!). I lined my 9x13 pan with parchment to overhang the edges, and after pouring in the first layer stuck it in the freezer (it was a very very hot day here). I did add a bit of butter (1 Tbsp) to the chocolate layer, and after adding this to the bottom layer I re-froze the whole thing for about 20 minutes before taking the whole thing from the pan (using the parchment overhang) to cut into small squares. Then it was back into the fridge. Unbelievably delicious!!!"
"0","5","We made these twice in two weeks they were so good"
"0","1","Gritty - WAY too sweet - Bottom didn't harden."
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly as stated..it is fantastic! Absolutely perfect…because I hate to use that much butter, and rarely do, so next time I'll try it with 1 stick. I have a feeling it will still come out delicious!"
"0","5","easy and delicious. It doesn't get any better than that!"
"0","4","I rate this more like 4.5 stars. Great flavor and easy to make. My peanut butter/graham cracker portion was a bit too soft to easily hold and eat. Maybe I will adjust my portions. Will make again. Thank you"
"0","5","These peanut butter bars are amazing! So easy and easy on the wallet too!"
"0","5","I made these with just 1 stick of butter and they came out great! Not crumbly at all, I also only put about a tablespoon of peanut butter in with the chocolate chips and they spread just fine. Will make this again"
"0","5","These were amazing! I cut the butter back to 3/4 cup and the sugar back to 1.5 cups and they were still very rich! I will definitely make them again, my whole family loved them!"
"0","5","I have made these for Easter and a baby shower. They were a HUGE hit both times. Everyone kept commenting on them. One person said 'I'm all about texture and these have good texture to them. They are better than Reese's' thanks for the great recipe"
"0","4","I agree with other reviewers: the peanut butter base was too greasy, so I recommend another 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs next time. I made other recommended adjustments: 1.5 sticks of butter in the base layer, and only 2 tablespoons of peanut butter in the chocolate layer. I had trouble with the melting as well, so I recommend leaving it in the fridge. I got good comments on the flavor, though."
"0","5","Huge hit at our weekly family dinner!"
"0","5","So good! I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe exactly as written. Didn't have any problems, and we loved these so much!"
"0","4","good but pretty sugary and too much butter. might try again with less butter."
"0","2","Not crazy about it surprisingly ...has almost all great ingredients but even with extra peanut butter the grittiness of the graham cracker crumbs just didn't work for us."
"0","5","Living in Greece where there aren't any graham crackers I used a package of a plain cookie call Pti Brer. Also, even if you can find them, choc. chips would be too expensive so I use unsweetened dark chocolate squares (about 6 as they are in grams) Also, because most American recipes are too sweet for my taste I cut the sugar to 1 & 1/2. I might even cut it more. But believe me, the dark chocolate really tastes good in this recipe. Don't ask me about the peanut butter; all I know is it is 85% peanuts and it is salted. At any rate, since I can't buy peanut butter cups here this is my treat a couple of times a year. My Greek friends who receive them as host's 'gifts' also love them."
"0","4","These were very sweet, and very rich, almost like fudge. Amazing peanut butter cup flavor, though. Overall very good."
"0","5","This is an amazing recipe!  They taste like Little Debbie Nutty Bars! I mean, exactly like them! They are a huge hit and I will continue to make these."
"0","3","Make sure your graham crackers r crushed very finely. I feel that will have better results. Next time I'm thinking of sprinkling some Reese's pieces on top before allowing to cool."
"0","5","I made these exactly as written. Was amazingly easy! I cut them small because of the sweetness. They were brought to a party and were devoured! Thanks for sharing."
"0","4","I just made these for the first time. I pretty much stuck with the recipes, but made two notable changes: 1.) I doubled it, but kept the 9x13 pan size, since some reviews said it was too thin 2.) I chilled the first layer for 20 min. before adding the chocolate layer on top.   The bar was way too thick, especially the graham layer; also, the chocolate layer separated from the graham layer. Next time, I will keep the graham layer the same, but double the chocolate, as well as NOT chilling the graham layer first and see what happens. As well, make sure your crumbs are fine, otherwise the bar will be a bit grainy."
"0","5","They really do taste a lot like Reese's."
"0","5","I made this instead of a birthday cake this year. I used milk chocolate chips instead...Recipe is awesome, better than the real thing!"
"0","5","I mixed all the ingredients with a hand mixer. Made it a lot fluffier! I would add a picture but they didn't last long enough in the pan to take a pic!"
"0","4","Delicious. Used a whole stick of butter with 1/4c extra peanut butter.  If your mixture is too gooey or watery just add extra powdered sugar."
"0","5","I saved time & $ by using whole graham crackers, crushing a little first in the package & then putting them in my food processor w/ the metal blade. I used 1 sleeve of graham crackers plus 3 whole crackers to get 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs. Then I pulsed in the food processor until all chunks were crushed into crumbs. I then added the rest of the base ingredients to the food processor and mixed the whole base using the pulse setting. Much easier & faster! I then chilled the base as others suggested & melted the chocolate chips & 4 TBSP peanut butter in the microwave, using 7 power for a minute and stirring after every minute until melted. Be careful not to over-melt or the chocolate will turn crumbly instead of smooth."
"0","5","These really do taste like peanut butter cups and even have the same texture. Very rich so I don't make them often. They disappear very quickly."
"0","5","These were really good. I use this recipe now instead of my old one."
"0","5","Wow! This is one of the best peanut butter and chocolate recipes I have made!"
"0","5","Love these...I add a little bit of salt because I think it helps the bars not be so cloyingly sweet."
"0","5","These were amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Tasted better than peanut butter cups."
"0","5","As a mom of 7, this is a great easy one for 'when the kids get off the bus.'"
"0","4","Very good, but the chocolate would come off."
"0","5","I make them for everything! So easy!!!!!"
"0","5","I made this recipe for Easter. I did change it up just a little bit. I did put wax paper at the bottom of my pan so they would lift out easily. Additionally, I melted a bag of milk chocolate chips and put on the bottom of the pan. I let that chill, then proceeded with the recipe. Chocolate top and bottom and peanut butter in the middle. It doesn't get better than that! EXCELLENT! They taste a better when you let them sit for a day. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","5","SO SO SO GOOD!!!!!!! This is the best peanut butter bar recipe EVER. Make recipe exactly as written. Don't change anything. You will be very happy with results and so will your family"
"0","3","Really sugary."
"0","5","So good and SO easy. I brought these to work and got great feedback. I will make these again."
"0","4","Yummy, I'm thinking of halving the chocolate!"
"0","5","The teen boy sleepover party had these gone in an hour. If you don't like semi-sweet chips, use milk chocolate. We like the semi-sweet. Definitely melt butter and chill the peanut butter mix before adding the chocolate, as other reviewers have suggested. Easy and tasty."
"0","2","Too sweet... Just peanut butter on peanut butter"
"0","5","Delicious recipe that has a nice presentation. Only problem was that we used All-Natural Peanut Butter that never hardened enough, despite being in the fridge. They taste fabulous, but was unable to give as a gift as had hoped because they were soft. Kids loved them and didn't mind they were soft! Would make again and try different peanut butter."
"0","5","I will be making these again."
"0","5","best recipe EVER!!!!!!!"
"0","5","These are awesome. I use soy butter for peanut butter due to my husband's peanut allergy. He loves these. Thanks so much for this so he can get his fix :)."
"0","5","love this recipe"
"0","5","These are really good. They taste like a nutter butter dipped in chocolate."
"0","5","This is really good and it does taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Yummy"
"0","3","They're a bit on the thin side, when you halve the recipe and make it in an 8*8 pan. Overall the dough needs something to give it a bit more of a creamy flavor, because it cannot stand alone without the chocolate, like it can when bullseyes are made. Also, even after setting for several hours, the bottom is still a bit more soft and greasy than it should be, making it harder to get out of the pan and rather messy to eat.   These were good, very much like a reece's, but next time, I think I'll switch the recipe for the peanut butter part with my secret bullseye recipe. They're almost the same, but not quite."
"0","5","The best dessert ive ever made for my family."
"0","5","As I live in the UK,we don't know what Graham Crackers are! I use a semi sweet rich tea biscuit,crushed.It works brilliantly and we love it.I make double and it is so popular that it doesn't last very long."
"0","5","Heaven on earth."
"0","5","These are amazing and so easy to make. They are a quick dessert to throw together and always a crowd pleaser."
"0","5","Definately will make again and again. Thank you for this teriffic recipe."
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","5","So very tasty and easy to make. I substituted Nilla Wafers for the graham crackers and my tasters liked it better that way. =D"
"0","5","So we gave these out as gifts fr christmas. Since we dont have enough money to go out and buy a ton of presents for family and friends. We cut them into bars and boxed them up. People raved over these. ALSO Some people cannot eat nuts, but they can eat peanut butter, they loved how it had a crunch to satisfy there peanut craving. Alot of people want this recipe. So thank you soo much for sharing this. This will stick with our family. ;)"
"0","5","My mom always made these for us, this exact recipe. It's sure is a keeper, it's simple easy and tastes amazing!"
"0","5","Yum! Added a little extra peanut butter to both layers (+ a little corn syrup for the chocolate) and my boyfriend and I both thought they tasted fabulous! Very close to Reese's!"
"0","3","I guess the graham crackers made these seem grainy and I thought these would be more rich."
"0","5","These are SO close to the real thing it's uncanny! I love them and they will be a part of my cookie and candy gifts from here on out!"
"0","5","I made these with 'Wow Butter' since my son is allergic to peanuts but still loves the taste. They turned out fabulous and I use 1 1/2 sticks of butter. I'm making them again tonight!"
"0","5","This was very easy to make. I have made it 2x already and they were a huge hit! i just added a 1/2 cup more chips bc we liked."
"0","5","Easy to make! Taste just like Reeece's Peanut Butter Cups. I even found Reece's Peanut Butter to use. Wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","5","So yummy! Can become a somewhat addictive, too! A BIG hit in my house. I will make these for any occasion!"
"0","5","The only thing I did different was use milk chocolate chips instead. It turned out yummy and perfect."
"0","5","So fast and easy and absolutely delicious!!!"
"0","5","Made as is, because, why mess with a good thing??? So delicious, and, IMO, better than a reeses peanut butter cup! Make these, you won't regret it!!!"
"0","5","I made these for a potluck and had to reserve a few little bars so my wife could try them. They went fast! After reading other reviews, I used 3/4 C butter and about 1 2/3 C confectioners' sugar. I also chilled the peanut butter layer for about 30 minutes, added the melted chocolate, chilled for another 30 minutes, cut the bars, and put back in the fridge. The chocolate was not fully hardened but retained its shape, so it did not crack and turned out very well. I thought the peanut butter layer turned out a little too crumbly, but that may be due to using less butter. I think I'll try again using even more PB since I love PB. Thanks for the recipe, Nancy!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly!! They are amazing! I've made these a dozen times and everyone loves them!"
"0","4","My daughter's boyfriend's favourite Christmas treat! The only thing I do differently is I use crunchy peanut butter for a bit of texture. Always a huge hit at my house!"
"0","5","I actually made these before I say your recipe. I had liked them before. I would recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter cups, like me."
"0","5","These were so delicious, I made them for a work function and they were one of the first things to go. I had people asking me for the recipe left and right, will definitely make again"
"0","5","Big hit for work potluck!"
"0","5","Very good"
"0","5","A little too good, and a little too easy! I only used 1/2 cup butter (margarine), and they turned out great."
"0","5","I did everything the same except added a couple of extra tablespoonfuls of peanut butter to the base, as I thought it seemed a little too crumbly. Just right! I love how very quick and easy this is. And there's no cooking! My mom made these when I was growing up, so I was really happy to find this recipe again."
"0","4","This recipe is awesome. I made these today. They are super simple and a quick fix for you peanut butter/chocolate lovers!!!! I did feel however it was Very buttery. Its still delicious but I think next time I will cut the butter a tad and maybe add 1/2 cup more of crackers for the base. AWESOME"
"0","5","Made a half batch of these to try them out. Should have made the whole batch! Everyone LOVED them and asked for the recipe. This recipe is a definite WINNER!"
"0","5","Delicious any way you make it! Straight up, by the book as written, or with half the butter and sugar, etc. Really how can you go wrong with these ingredients? :)"
"0","5","yes, fabulous, will make it often"
"0","5","These are dangerous to make! I will only make them when we have company otherwise I risk eatting them all myself! So yummy."
"0","5","These were a big hit. I chose this recipe to use up some wow butter that I bought to send a 'peanut butter' type sandwich to school for my son. He wasn't a huge fan so, I thought I would use half wow butter and half natural peanut butter and make these. I also cleaned out a combination of graham cracker crumbs and Oreo crumbs from my pantry. Combined I had enough to make the recipe. They turned out fabulous."
"0","5","These peanutbutter bars are very good, and they are really easy to make. A good recipe to try."
"0","5","Really tasted like Reese's.....I even used soy butter because my daughter is nut and peanut allergic. I cut down the sugar by half, since there is the choc chip ingredient too. I will make this again....kids and husband love it."
"0","3","Good. I think I made it wrong. I maybe didn't get the butter to the right state before mixing it all together. It felt like I was just eating butter."
"0","1","Too greasy! Too much butter. What a waste of ingredients. :\"
"0","5","These were awesome! My grandsons and neighbors loved them! I followed a couple of other suggestions (chilled the crust for at least 30 min before putting filling on)and melted the butter and peanut butter together (for crust). Also used 1 1/2 C powered sugar and added a little extra peanut butter to both the crust and the filling. Then put finished bars in fridge. They were great!"
"0","5","I have been making these for a couple years now for the Holidays, I do cook all my ingredients together on the stove top except the chocolate, it makes it easier to spread in your pan and helps the chocolate stay melted to spread on top easier, then I freeze mine for 15 minutes and then pop it out and cut it, Done and ready to eat. Thanks for the great recipe, everyone will keep coming back for more.. P.S. Cut them small they are rich, like quarter size small."
"0","5","I can't believe how good these are! This is such an easy recipe too. I did only use one and a half sticks of butter and I took the advice to melt the peanut butter with the butter and I had no problems with mixing it. I also let the 'crust' sit in the refrigerator while I melted the chocolate chip topping although it didn't look runny at all so it may not have been necessary. I used the entire bag of chocolate chips since the recipe calls for a cup and a half which is 12 ounces even though it measured 2 cups before melting. Melted it was the correct measurement. If you use less than that you won't have enough to spread all over the top. These are really thin bars but they are so sweet that I really don't mind it. Such a simple recipe that there's no reason not to try these!"
"0","5","Easy and rich tasting!"
"0","2","I made the recipe as is and found the crust way too greasy and heavy. I am a huge peanut butter and chocolate fan, but this is missing the yummy peanut punch I love in a good chocolate peanut butter bar."
"0","5","Flippin' ridiculous good- pardon my French! Like buckeyes, but so much easier than dipping each ball. I did lesson the butter slightly, and I used milk chocolate chips, because that's what I had on hand."
"0","5","GOOD LORD these were amazing!!!! Fantastic!! Wow. I made these because Im a huge Reeses fan. My foodie girlfriend went bananas over them! Unreal. These are simply the best. Thanks. Will definitely be making these again and again. Woohoo!!!"
"0","5","These are a hit every time! Just cut through once after chilling for about 20 minutes and they won't crack"
"0","3","WAY TO SWEET."
"0","5","With over 1500 reviews, you don't need mine. HOWEVER: these are sinfully delicious and remarkably like Reese's Peanutbutter Cups. NO baking either. Now, how good is that (on a hot summer day)?"
"0","5","i was browsing thru the recipes and i found this one...this is now my new favorite dessert.it's easy,it's quick,no mess when putting the recipe together,no fuss.i love it.....thanks for publishing the recipe.:)"
"0","5","have u tried to use white chocolate on top of peanut butter bars.?"
"0","5","Be careful, these can be addicting! We all love these and they are so easy to make, Great for a gluten free diet if you use GF grahams."
"0","4","At first I was confused about making this recipe because I didn't know how long to microwave the chocolate chips and the peanut butter but the reviews for the recipe said to heat it 30 second intervals. Other than that the recipe was good and I would make it again."
"0","5","Made this and my neighbors demanded the recipe! All new favorite in my family."
"0","5","Absolutely the easiest and most delicious peanut butter and chocolate recipe out there! Made a batch for family and for a barbecue and there were gone within 10 minutes. A few people fought over the crumbs. Very rich, and very yummy!"
"0","4","This is a very rich dessert. I I only used 1 cup, and it was still pretty sweet. I also cut the butter in half, and it seemed to come out fine. It does taste like a reeses peanut butter cup, so the flavor is good. I used a food processor like others mentioned to make the base layer smooth. It still had a slight grit texture to it from the graham crackers, but I liked it that way. I probably won't make this again, as it is really heavy, but it did taste good."
"0","5","Wow! These are awesome bars. I don't crave peanut butter too often, but when I do, these will always fit the bill. Rich taste, super easy to make. Definitely a winner! I followed the directions as given, had no problems whatsoever. I did use a mixer to blend the crust portion, making sure it was thoroughly blended. I also used a 10 inch square pan, making them nice and thick!"
"0","5","We took this recipe to a friend's house last night and it was a huge hit! We will definitely make this again for future gatherings."
"0","5","amazing"
"0","5","I use this recipe for peanut butter and jelly cheese cake. good lord is it good."
"0","4","This is exactly the same recipe that my mom started making in the 19790's. I think that she found it on the back of a graham cracker box. This recipes is a love it or leave it kind of candy. My youngest brother loves it, my kids not so much. I do make this quite often. It's on of those recipes that you can make with your eyes closed. It makes a great addition to cookie gift boxes just because it is so easy. The only that I add is 3/4 teaspoon if vanilla extract."
"0","3","This is basically home made reeses, not what I expected. Tastes like candy."
"0","5","I brought these to a Memorial Day party a couple of weekends ago and they were the first things gone. Made exactly as stated and they were very good"
"0","5","These peanut butter bars are terrific! I made them exactly as recipe states and they turned out delicious. Very rich flavor so you can only eat a few, stored in fridge and I was able to keep them all week."
"0","4","Good, but I would add half the suggested amount of butter or maybe less than that, otherwise they end up mushy and greasy."
"0","5","I put in vanilla extract it was amazing!"
"0","5","These are great! I would agree that they are a little too sweet so I cut back on the icing sugar a bit. I didn't measure but i'd day I left out 1/2 cup or so the 2nd time I made them. Also, I personally like more peanut butter flavor so I added peanut butter chips to the topping after I spread out the chocolate. I also added skor pieces b/c I had a few left in a package and that was awesome too!!! Everybody loves these!!!!"
"0","3","The taste was OK, but I found the bottom portion to be dry. Then, the chocolate topping separated from the bottom when I tried to cut it into slices. I probably won't make these again."
"0","5","I love this recipe made today and it was gone fast leaving everyone wanting more I will be making it many more times thank you for such a great and easy recipe"
"0","4","I personally didn't care for these bars. Maybe my expectation was too high after reading others high ratings. BUT people at my husband's work really liked them."
"0","5","5 stars + these were out of this world and super easy to make. I used one bowl plus the pan I put them in."
"0","5","So delicious! I made this for the first time at Christmas last year and It was a hit. I'm a big peanut-butter-n-chocolate-cup fan, and this beats them all."
"0","5","This is easy and yummy!"
"0","5","This was awesome"
"0","4","So easy and delicious! The texture from the graham crackers was a little 'textury' and I'm not sure that I liked it but it was still good, nonetheless."
"0","5","dont need to say anything i ve given them 5 stars...says it all!!! yummmmylicous!!!! just that refrigerate it more than an hr they be perfect:)"
"0","5","LOve This! I have made it three times now! LOts of Chocolate is better but thin is ok too! These are better than Reese! And I used to love Reese! I love to eat these Frozen! :)"
"0","5","omg..these are amazing!"
"0","5","This recipe was awesome!! Family and friends couldn't get enough. Wife is a Reese's Cup lover but said these are better. She should know!! I'm just a novice and I wouldn't change receipe at all. So easy to do to make people soo happy!!!"
"0","4","Everyone loves these"
"0","5","So good! I wish the chocolate topping was a little softer, but they were still some of the best peanut butter bars I've had."
"0","5","These were excellent and so easy. I like quick and easy! Had to use chocolate graham crackers and milk chocolate chips as that is what we had on hand. It was so good, everyone loved it!"
"0","4","Pretty banging, hit my craving like a freight train. Freeze those suckers and die crying (for joy)!"
"0","5","This recipe was great, everyone loves it at home. I like other users microwaved the PB & CC. Like someone else mentioned, only microwave it for 30 seconds at a time or you risk burning the PB & CC. Scooping out the burnt portions is no fun."
"0","3","These squares were really easy to make, but they had a really grainy texture. I feel that the recipe sacrifices quality taste for convenience. Not for me! I'd rather bake squares that taste better."
"0","5","I made this as a peace offering to my boyfriend since he is a peanut butter nut. Of all the Peanut Butter bars I have made, I love the texture of this one most. Instead of using the peanut butter and semi=sweet chocolates; I used melted Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (his favorite).   Needless to say, we are still together!"
"0","3","Wasn't crazy about this recipe. I didn't feel there was a good peanut butter to chocolate ratio. If I make this again I will double the chocolate portion. Only keeping it because the hubby liked it."
"0","5","Delicious! Fast and easy to make..followed recipe to a t"
"0","5","I have made this recipe several times this week. Everyone who tried them asked for the recipe. My grandaughter also made a batch for school and was so pleased that her class loved them."
"0","5","Oh my goodness.................well these were a hit! Very quick and simple but not very healthy :/! Oh well, a great treat now and then. My boys loved them. I cut them up in to small squares so I had about 20 to serve. Thought my husband was going to cry when he realized they were all gone. Thanks all! X"
"0","5","first time trying to melt chocolate and it went well. everyone loved these and they were gone within a day .but i would change a few things as they were way too sweet if thats possible. i would use only 1 and two thirds cup of icing sugar,half a cup of butter,1 and a half cup of graham crumbs and one cup of peanut butter. also i first mixed the butter and peanut butter. then i added the icing sugar and crumbs slowly. put mixture in pan , melted chocolate and put on top."
"0","5","Best ever treat I ever made! Took some when I visited my daughter's family of five this past week & they all loved it! (Note to my other daughter & grandson: sorry, there's none left, but we'll make more for when you come to visit for the night.) EVERYONE (including myself), had a nibble every now & then.  The only change I would make for my next batch would be to reduce the amount of confectioner's sugar to 1 or 1 1/4 cups. Otherwise, it was loved by all 3 generations. Thank you Nancy, for your very generous and delicious contribution."
"0","5","The Peanut Butter bars are awesome.Every one loved them.Didn't change anything.I give it a 5"
"0","5","Amazing!"
"0","3","They were 'okay' I used 1/2 natural and 1/2 regular chunky peanut butter & butter. Base seemed too sweet and lacked punch. I put in about 1/2 tsp. salt, maybe slightly more. This definitely added to a better result. Maybe I'm not a fan of these, my son liked them, I told him to take the pan to work. I used an 8x8 pan and made them thicker- better this way too."
"0","5","I used one reviewer's suggestion and melted the peanut butter with the butter, made it so easy to stir! I put the bottom layer in the fridge to cool while I melted the chips (I used 1/2 chocolate and 1/2 caramel chips). My whole family loved this! Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","wow! Delicious! My family of 5 and I are trying to eat healthier and so I decided to make a 'diet' version of this recipe. It turned out perfect! My opinion is that all food can be enjoyed if one keeps in mind portion and quantity. My version: I made the recipe as stated except I quartered all ingredients (for the math faint of heart: just figure what is 1/2 of the amount and then take 1/2 of that amount). I spread it out on a dinner plate into a pretty circle and cut it into 10 small pieces. We each ate 2 small pieces and can honestly say we ate healthy today!"
"0","5","So easy to make. Freezes easily."
"0","5","Fabulous! I'm not much of a baker, but always looking for dessert ideas and this one will def be made again. Kids and adults loved it!!! One change I made for necessity, I live in the Netherlands so there are no graham crackers so I used regular sweet crackers (called 'tea biscuits' here) and added about a tsp of honey when making the crust and still turned out great and had a graham cracker-y taste."
"0","3","My husband can not eat peanut butter ...so I am going to try it with cashuw nut better."
"0","5","Wow! I usually don't review recipes, but this one is absolutely the best! I can't tell the difference between these bars and the store bought peanut butter cups!"
"0","4","They are pretty good but too much butter flavor. If I we make them again will cut the butter."
"0","4","Good basic PB bars. Although I find them lacking in PB taste."
"0","5","When I made these, they were 10x better than I thought they would be! They taste EXACTLY like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. My family loved them, they were gone pretty fast. And the best part is, its cheap!"
"0","5","very easy, very good."
"0","3","I found these too sweet. Couldn't really get much peanut butter taste through all that sugar! I would decrease the amount of sugar if I ever make these again."
"0","5","We made these while snowed in for days during the Blizzard of 2013. They were so delicious, we couldn't stop eating them!"
"0","5","Sooo good! My boyfriend is constantly asking me to make this recipe and my mom always has to take some home. I have never come across anyone who doesn't like these squares. They are so easy to make. I follow the recipe exactly except I will sometimes use milk chocolate chips."
"0","5","One word: YUMMY! These are great and so super rich nobody will need more than one!"
"0","5","these were absolutely great! everybody loved them, and they were very easy to make."
"0","5","OMG tastes just like Reeses peanut butter cups!!!"
"0","5","These Pb bars are just wonderful. Made them for Christmas and they were gone before the day arrived. Made it exactly as written. No changes. Will make them again. Very soon."
"0","5","We love love love this recipe. So super easy to make and tastes identical to a Reese's cup!!! I have shared it so many times after serving at various functions!"
"0","5","very simple and delicious-tasting bars. I also melted the butter with the 1 cup of peanut butter. I used an 8 x 8 pan to make them thicker. Tasted just like peanut butter cups!!!!"
"0","4","Very Easy to make. Only changes I made was cut back to 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar and more chocolate chips. But will for sure make again!!"
"0","4","These were really tasty but the chocolate layer wouldn't stay put for some reason. Will definitely try again though!"
"0","3","These were good. Taste is similar to the peanut butter cups you find at the store. I personally did not have any trouble with mine as other' have. They do need time to set and I did only use 1 1/2 sticks of butter. My kids liked it but unlike other sweets I make, these lasted a while(in the fridge) because they are sooo rich. They were good, just not as good as I hoped."
"0","5","Oh! My! Gosh! I will never look at a box of graham crackers that same again! I am truly sorry I found this recipe!!! It is SO GOOD!  Made with a natural refrigerated peanut butter, half the recipe in an 8x8 pan. WONDERFUL~!"
"0","5","I made these for Thanksgiving and they were fabulous! I've been asked to make them again for Christmas! Thank you!"
"0","5","This turned out soooooo delicious!! I'm a dark chocolate lover so I topped my bars with melted dark chocolate chips....Yummm...yummmmmm :) Made it for a lunch guest and she went crazy for them..and requested the receipe..it's a hit for sure!!..and I'll be making them more and trying different toppings to them."
"0","5","We make a recipe very similar to this where I work. They are delicious and addicting! Very rich, like a homemade Reese's cup."
"0","5","I used some of the suggestions as well as added my own variations. Instead of 2 cups of confectioners' sugar I used 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar. When I bite into a Reece's I love the texture - it's almost granulated so that's why I added regular sugar. Also, For the crust I added 1 and 1/4 cup of peanut butter instead of just 1 cup. I then stole 1/4 cup of the melted butter from the crust mixture to set aside for the chocolate mixture. (I used 3/4 cup of melted butter for the crust and 1/4 cup melted butter for the chocolate) In the chocolate mixture, I added the 1/4 cup of butter which I took from the 1 cup of melted butter for the crust. I also used a whole package of milk chocolate chips (which was exactly 1 1/2 cups) and added 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chips. Again, for the chocolate mixture I used an additional 2 spoonfuls of peanut butter. I followed the suggestion to set the crust aside in the fridge for 30 minutes to harden before pouring the chocolate on top. The pan was set outside (it's cold and snowing here) for 20 minutes and another 30 minutes in the refrigerator at a Christmas party. We found that a silicone knife is the PERFECT tool to cut these with! We didn't try a regular knife but I'm sure that works just fine as well. All in all, I love this recipe so much... but I can't eat more than a few tiny pieces at a time or I would have had to roll myself home from the Christmas party. I still have lots left! Delicious."
"0","5","Delicious and so easy!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. I did let the graham cracker crust set in the fridge for about 30 minutes before I poured the chocolate on top. My whole family loved these bars and I have been craving them every day since I made these yummy treats. I will make again very soon."
"0","4","So easy, and as delicious as Reece's Peanut Butter Cups."
"0","5","Made as directed but made into peanut butter cups rather than bars. Turned out GREAT!"
"0","4","Great recipe! I used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 of a cup of vegan margarine. I also, put 1/3 of a cup carmel and chocolate chips in the base for an extra something."
"0","5","This recipe is excellent, and really easy to make. I went exactly by the recipe and they are delicious."
"0","5","My husband and i LOVED these! They were really easy to make and really yummy! Defiantly would recommend."
"0","5","I did not change a thing. I can't believe how yummy they are! I made them for my son-in-law and Grandkids who love peanut butter cups. I only kept 4 small squares here and good thing cause I would have eaten the whole thing! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Delicious, simple and always gone! Wouldn't change a thing although I do shrink the portion size by making bite-sized squares."
"0","5","My daughter has a peanut allergy so I tried making it with soy nut butter and it tasted amazing! And really easy to make. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","I just made these and they are delicious! I did as other reviewers have suggested and chilled the peanut butter base first. I also only waited about 20 minutes to cut them so the chocolate didn't harden too much and crack."
"0","5","Really delish! Took to Eugene - liked by all. very rich just like Reese's peanut butter cups"
"0","5","These are wonderful and so easy to make. Everyone loved these."
"0","5","Super easy and super yummy. I didn't have enough butter, so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter Crisco and they taste the same. I also only had crunchy peanut butter and that works too...."
"0","4","tried this today, it was easy to make tasted great, family loved it"
"0","5","Super easy and super delicious!! Everyone always asks me to bring these for parties. Thank you for the recipe!!"
"0","5","love it great family hit"
"0","5","These are FABULOUS! I only had one pack of grahams so did the rest with crushed saltines. Worked great ...BIG HIT!!"
"0","3","these are okay, although they don't have the creamy texture and rich peanut buttery-ness I was craving. Give them good marks for something that's super easy, has great presentation possibilites and would hit the mark for most everybody but me."
"0","5","My husbands first comment after taking one bite was, 'You made a peanut butter cup!' He loved them. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were addicting and beyond delicious!"
"0","5","This recipe is Heaven. Period."
"0","5","My family is nuts about this recipe!!! It's easy, quick & yummy!!! It's definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","These are amazing!!!!! I love peanut butter cups and these taste just like them. So easy and no baking makes me love them even more!!! Thanks Nancy"
"0","5","I'm the Chef at a Hospice where I live and I've made these a few times here. Everyone absolutely loves these tasty treats. They have a way of putting a smile on the face of the people we take care of. Thank You!"
"0","5","simple & delicious!"
"0","5","I love these! They're so easy to make, and they're so, so, so delicious! Just looking at the picture makes me want to rummage through my cabinets and whip some up right now!! Thank you so much for sharing!"
"0","5","Super sweet & super rich but oh so good! I made these with minor modifications; my graham crackers were a bit stale so I toasted them before crushing then sifted them with the powdered sugar for a uniform consistency. I also mixed 3/4 cup of both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips with the peanut butter for the topping and it turned out well. I did have a minor sticking issue when I pulled them out of the pyrex dish so a light mist of cooking spray may be in order next time."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious and gone in a sec!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! I made these for our weekly game night and they were quickly devoured. If you like peanut butter cups, you will love this recipe!"
"0","5","These were excellent! I followed the recipe with NO VARIATIONS the first time I made it. They definitely have to be completely chilled when cut into squares. I cut the batch at all at one time, then used a pancake turner to carefully lift them out of the pan. I am getting ready to make them again and will use a small amount of pan spray on the bottom of the pan this time. Enjoy!"
"0","5","These bars were super easy to make and out of this world good! Thanks so much for this recipe!"
"0","4","The flavor is excellent and very rich. My only complaint is that they were a little gooey and that made it difficult to transport and still have them look attractive for the party I was brining them to. Very good, but I would make them again for eating around the house and not to take to an event."
"0","4","These. Taste. Amazing. It's ridiculous how good they taste, my sister even told me she'd rather eat one of these than a Reeses. The reason I only gave this 4 stars was just because the bottom of the bar is very moist, and because of that they don't hold together as well as I would like them to. 5 stars for taste, though! They never last long :)"
"0","5","We had peanut butter bars served on our dessert bar at our wedding. I knew I needed to find a recipe to replicate them - this recipe is EVEN better than the ones served at our wedding! Be careful, they're addicting."
"0","5","They are excellent and so easy! Can I freeze them? and for how long? Not that they will stay frozen very long."
"0","2","Nothing to rave about, they were too grainy for our liking."
"0","5","Love Love Love! this recipe my daughter has a nut allergy so we replaced the peanut butter with wow butter and it still tastes amazing!"
"0","5","I just love these bars. Took them to a graduation 2 months ago. My neighbor tasted them and asked me to make them for hers this weekend."
"0","4","Fantastic! I had to add extra graham cracker crumbs to firm up the bottom layer, but these taste wonderful."
"0","4","These are SO good!!! They taste even better than Reese's Peanut Butter cups. I just made them today and couldn't believe how delicious they are for a 'no bake' recipe. I had to alter the recipe so that it would fit in a 8x8 inch pan because I was using my 9x13 inch pan for something else. They turned out perfectly except for the peanut butter part being a little gooey (which also caused the peanut butter and chocolate to separate a little). I mean, no one minded, but as far as presentation goes, they could have looked better. I think this may have been due to me altering the recipe for a smaller pan though. Overall, this was an amazing recipe and I WILL be making them again...in a 9x13 inch pan ;)  Oh! Also, I put the peanut butter layer in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes before adding the chocolate. It seemed to keep the chocolate from running."
"0","5","This was awesome! My twin grandsons kept calling it chicken, but the whole family loved it -- from the oldest to the youngest. Very peanutty and so simple to make. This is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","These are the best thing ever I loved them so much."
"0","5","So good and so easy! Followed the recipe exactly as written - they are awesome!"
"0","5","I love these, its a GREAT and easy recipe. I made a 9x13 pan of these last nite, I ate one and so did my hubby, I don't know how we ate JUST one. We woke this mornng to find there were only 3 or 4 of them left! My 15 year old son and his friend, the same age, DEMOLISHED the pan. He loves Reeses peanut butter cups more then anythng and this is what he said as I was about to yell at him ' But mom these were SO MUCH better then RP cups, we couldn't help it!' That says it all. He didn't get yelled at, and we found a recipe that is quick, easy and yummy to keep! Thanks!"
"0","3","These sure sounded good, however, the bottom peanutbutter layer was crumbly that u could not even cut them into bars...so...I ended up just crumbling it up along with the chocolate layer on top ..and I keep it in my freezer and we sprinkle it on top of sundaes, cakes, and whatknot!!"
"0","5","these tasted so much like reese's peanut butter cups! Per some other reviews I only used 1 stick of butter, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the mixture (when I made them the 1st time I tasted more of hte graham cracker crumbs than I would have preferred) and I used milk chocolate choclate chips (the whole bag) rather than the semi-sweet ones (althought I don't think it will make difference which ones you use)."
"0","5","These peanut butter bars were rich and delicious but i would add a little less butter or refridgerate for not as long."
"0","5","I cut into bite size squares and placed in mini cupcake wrappers. These are so rich a bite is all you need! I stored leftovers in the freezer and they are a tasty little frozen treat."
"0","5","so amazing and easy to make :) I normally use 2 cups or more of chocolate to make the chocolate layer a little thicker. Love it"
"0","5","Thankfully I had the good sense to bring these to work or I would be laying on the floor in a sugar coma by now! PB cups are my favorite thing on earth so I found these wonderfully delicious. I (as some others did) used milk chocolate chips and a little less butter."
"0","5","These bars are SOOO good. Chocolate & PB - what more can you ask for. They are always a hit at parties and not too hard to make."
"0","5","YUMMY! Family loved these. I pulsed up about a cup of stick pretzels in food processor sprinkled on top of peanut butter layer and covered with the chocolate. Perfect combination of sweet and salty."
"0","5","This was sooooo good! Especially since i didn't have to cook it! WOW-my kids and I thought it tasted exactly like a Reese's cup-we tried to taste one after refrigerating an hour or so but it was a wierd texture-we had them the next day after they were frefrigerated overnight and they were killer! Thanks for sharing-"
"0","5","soooo good"
"0","5","I make this dessert all the time! Everyone loves it and I love that no baking is required! When I'm in a pinch to get dessert ready in a hurry, I run to this recipe. I pop it in the freezer once it's made for a quick cooling process and we always keep these refrigerated for best texture."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! I get major compliments every time I make these wonderful bars. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","We called these Peanut Butter Squares in school and I literally survived off of them during high school. I got the lunch ladies to give me the receipe for graduation. They used Rice Krispie cereal instead of graham crakers and less powder sugar than this. Then I lost the receipe!!! Several years later I found this receipe in a cookbook. HALELIULAH!!! I now make these regularly. But I have added at times, both graham crakers and rice krispes equally-1 cup each. The cereal gives it more of a crunchier texture like we had at school. But you still get the gooey, and yes they can be greasy, chocolately, party in your mouth!! If you find yours is too dry, try adding more melted butter and peanut butter alternatively until it spreads well in the pan. A tablespoon at a time. More than that will make it too greasy and you don't want that. Hope you all enjoy this as much as I and my family do!!"
"0","5","Oh my gosh, these are like heaven!!!!!!!!! My friend had told me about them, and when I got home, I jumped right on the computer to find the recipe!!!!!!"
"0","4","We loved these! Kind of like peanut butter fudge to me. I needed a recipe to use up some old graham crackers and this was perfect."
"0","5","I remembered these from my elementary school. They cost a nickel then and Ohhh so good. It's great to finally have the recipe to make them for my grandchildren. All this time I didn't think about the graham crackers - duh! Thanks"
"0","4","Very easy and most ingredients are on hand in the pantry. Also tasty, curbs the peanut butter chocolate craveing"
"0","5","This was a family hit the first time I made it! Everyone is asking me to make it again! The only thing I would change is to use a smaller pan, to make it thicker. And we all preferred it when the graham crackers were more coarse; not completely beat to crumbs. It gives it more of a crunch."
"0","4","This was AMAZING! I used 1/2 regular peanut butter and half natural and it turned out great! Tons of requests to make again!"
"0","4","Not a big fan, found that they tasted to much like butter then peanut butter & I even cut out 1/4 of the butter & used peanut butter instead but with saying that my Boyfriend LOVED them! So for that I have to give 4 stars, thanks for the recipe I'll be asked to make them again I'm sure lol"
"0","4","These were definitely yummy, and addicting, but they are super rich and greasy... I think maybe removing some of the butter from the peanut butter mixture would help? These bars did not hold up after being cut into squares -- they fell apart in my hands and made my hands extra oily... Definitely delicious though! Also, if you're hoping for a smoother chocolate topping, this one gets hard as a rock after cooling, which I guess would be expected. I think it would be better with less greasy peanut butter layer and softer chocolate layer."
"0","5","I made these and used chocolate graham crackers they are delicious!"
"0","4","Very easy to make. A little on the rich side, so I cut them into small squares. My kids loved them."
"0","5","Amazingly yummy, I accually added about 3/4 cup quick oats to give it a little more nutritional value and still very good and sweet,just like a reeces peanut butter cup."
"0","4","Used Rice Krispies in place of graham crumbs, as a last minute emergency substitution, and it tasted great! Also used milk chocolate chips which was good."
"0","5","This is an AWESOME and easy recipe! I love it!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Everyone loved them!"
"0","5","Awesome! My family loved them and they are incredibly easy! I used natural peanut butter, 1 1/2 sticks of butter and only 1 c of chocolate with 3 TBS peanut butter for the topping and they were still excellent. Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!"
"0","5","Made these for one of our friend's for his birthday. He said that it was the best birthday dessert he had ever had!!  My husband said that it was better than any store bough peanut butter cups!!  The kids loved these as well!  Not only were they delicious, they were super easy to make!!"
"0","5","I doubled the fudge topping and added peanut butter and a little butter to it."
"0","4","Easy to make and delicious. I cut the butter to 1 stick, but not intentionally, I just read recipe wrong. They turned out great. I used a small cookie scoop and pressed peanut butter mixture into mini-muffin pans lined with mini-muffin cups. I put one small cookie scoop of chocolate on each. This required a double batch of the chocolate topping. I refrigerated until chocolate set. After that, refrigeration was not required. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I prefer a stonger peanut butter flavor. Next time I make them, I will use 1 1/2 cups peanut butter."
"0","5","Better than peanut butter cups! My husband would eat the whole pan if he could!"
"0","4","Just got done making some...they are soooo good...although I dont really think they taste like a peanut butter cup which is ok..if I want one of those I can just go to the corner store...They remind me of peanut butter and chocolate fudge I used to get from a bakery years ago. I am definitely going to include  these in with my Christmas goodie plates."
"0","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it i added extra cinnamon which was a great idea.Try this recipe."
"0","5","If you kive reese peanut butter cups you will love these"
"0","5","EXCELLENT!!!! Very tasty and quick and easy to make. Very rich! Addicting."
"0","5","Oh boy!!!! One word AMAZING!!! I do not care for semi-sweet anything so I always sub with milk chocolate. They are so easy, so yummy, and so addicting. I know I'm going to be mad when I get on the scale tomorrow."
"0","5","These are now famous at my work. I found it does take slightly longer than 1 hour to set, and it's the longest hour and a half of my life.  Also, try swapping the graham crackers for coarse pretzel pieces and a pinch of sea salt. That batch didn't even make it to the employee lounge."
"0","5","These bars have become viral. I made them for a family I knew, who that asked for the recipe. They made them for a graduation party...and they just keep spreading. They are that darn good! I love these things!"
"0","5","Delicious! I've made these with Nutella as well and they are melt in your mouth yummy."
"0","5","Made this for the first time last night and fell in love!!!!!!!! Soooooo simple, soooo goood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Me and my boyfriend found our new favorite dessert, treat, etc!! Once i made the 'base' i did refergerate for a bit. I also added 1/4C butter to the choc chip/peanut butter mixture and it was so simple to spread on the base!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Excellent!!"
"0","5","Absolutely perfect. When I'm not eating them, I'm craving them."
"0","2","I thought these were greasy and grainy, but I gave it 2 stars because my 9 year old likes them."
"0","5","I always make these with an oreo cookie crust and it makes them DIVINE. I used ghee (only 3/4 cup, tops), so they're a little runnier, but still firm enough, especially since I prefer to freeze them anyway. These would be great in individual cups like reeses. They're a little too dangerous as bars."
"0","5","this is a recipe I had gotten years ago , when micro wave ovens first came out !!!!! I lost it, but now I am so happy to find it again, my kids loved these now my grandchildren will love them !!!!!"
"0","5","Loved the bars...used them at a family function and they went fast..mostly by me. :)   I did tweak the recipe by using the tips from others and it was perfect!"
"0","5","YUM YUM YUM! This was exactly the recipe I was looking for! It certainly does taste just like a peanut butter cup! And it's the perfect dessert to make on a hot summer day when you don't want to turn on the oven! I'm not a big chocolate person though, so I cut down the chocolate topping a bit... The bottom is so good you could almost go without the chocolate all together! :) Yum!"
"0","5","its sooooooooooooooooooo delicous"
"0","3","These tasted very good but too messy - will try again and grease the pan for easier removal."
"0","5","Wow! Super-rich so a little piece is more than enough. I'll probably half the recipe next time. The only change I made was using crunchy p. butter."
"0","5","Love Love Love this! Its easy and delish! I had a craving for something sweet last night and whipped this up and yes it DOES taste like a peanut butter cup but richer!"
"0","5","Just like my mom used to make for me and my brother"
"0","5","So quick! So Delicious! So Easy!"
"0","5","excellent! Simple to make, and everyone ate it up in my house."
"0","5","I would add a little less butter next time"
"0","5","Made this one with 1 1/2 sticks butter just in case and it is awesome! It really doesn't seem to matter how much/little butter you use because it combines really well. I did let the bottom layer chill in the fridge for about 15 minutes before added the top layer. Does taste just like a gosh-darn PB cup!!! Thank you!"
"0","5","These are so good and so easy! I made a plate of them for a church function and they were gone in seconds. My husband and kids keep asking when I am going to make them again and leave them at home this time! They make great desserts for school lunch boxes."
"0","5","These are awesome! The only things I changed was instead of using semisweet chocolate chips I used a full bag of peanut butter milk chocolate chips because that's all I had and I used an extra half cup of peanut butter. 1 cup crunchy and 1/2 cup regular. Still turned out very good!! Will keep this recipe close at hand for sure!"
"0","4","I decreased the butter to 3/4 cup, and used 14 graham crackers. It was very soft and gooey, and a bit greasy - required refrigeration. I wish it were a bit more solid. Maybe even less butter next time."
"0","5","I like an easy to remember recipe like this, basically twice as much dry ingredients to wet, and as much melted chips as you desire, and you can easily make any size batch you want. People will be amazed when you make it without looking at a cookbook!"
"0","5","Terrific & easy!!"
"0","5","Made these for my boss this passed holiday season, he loved them!!"
"0","5","I will never buy Reese's again! These were DELCIOUS! And were a HUGE hit at our Superbowl party. I left little Graham Cracker chunks in it, and that made it extra yummy! : )"
"0","5","WOW!!! These were incredible! SO easy to make, literally done in ten minutes the whole family loved them! Thanks for such a yummy and easy recipe!"
"0","5","If you're a reese fan these are heaven! Just make sure you have people to share them with, eating the entire batch yourself is hard to resist! I usually store these in the freezer"
"0","5","Amazing! I made these exactly as written, and they're irresistable!"
"0","5","super easy. super delicious!"
"0","5","Love these bars. They were so simple to put together and so perfect."
"0","5","These are not only delicious, but easy to make. Tastes just like a Reese cup. Will make again!"
"0","5","This is Awesome! Tastes better than Reese's in my opinion. I used organic peanut butter. It came out delicious! Only problem is I want to eat it all!"
"0","5","I'm not a fan of PB but my boyfriend loves it. The recipe is simple and quick so I don't mind making it for him. Everyone that has tried them loves the balance between the graham cracker bottom and the chocolate topping."
"0","5","Wonderful, son's and one of the church gatherings favorites"
"0","5","Easy, easy, easy...yummy, yummy, yummy!"
"0","5","These are fantastic! My oven broke so I couldn't make my family's favorite dessert, so I tried this no-bake recipe. My family couldn't not stop eating them. Now, these are their new favorite dessert!"
"0","5","I just made these and they are very good. I did need more powdered sugar than the recipe calls for, but other than that stuck to the recipe exactly and came out great. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","These are so yummy. I changed it up a little (I never make a recipe exactly as it states, lol). I used canned fudge frosting instead of the chocolate chips and peanut butter for the chocolate layer and it is YUMMY!. We also used honey graham crackers this time and that gave them a little different flavor. I like them best with just plain graham crackers. Everyone loves them when we take them to a pitch-in."
"0","5","I reduced the amount of sugar to about only 1/2 to 2/3 of what is stated in the recipe, and it worked really well. It was certainly sweet enough for my sweet tooth, but allowed the peanut butter taste to be stronger at the same time. I really loved this, as did all my coworkers, who begged for more!"
"0","5","i made this recipe for a family gathering and had a ton of compliments. this dessert is very rich and soooooo good. very easy to follow the directions. my 6 year old daughter always asks for me to make these. have made this recipe on many ocassions and will continue to do so"
"0","5","If you like rich things, this is one for you! I made these to share at work for my birthday, and received lots of compliments and requests for the recipe. A great candy-type bar!"
"0","5","YUM...no need to read reviews prior...it is hands down DELICIOUS!"
"0","5","I've made these several times, with some changes, they're a 5. As in, probably only a 4. If you're planning to keep and serve the bars at room temp, I'd suggest using room temp butter so you can see what consistency they're going to be. I usually end up adding an extra 1/4-1/2 c powdered sugar. I also love the texture of the graham cracker crumbs, so I add an extra 1/3 c of them as well.  If you put the bars in a 9x13 pan, they'll be pretty thin. I usually put them in a 9x9 instead to have slightly thicker bars"
"0","5","I took these to a party and by the time I put them on the food table only 2 squares were left! :D"
"0","5","These are great! I made them for all of my European friends who love Reeces peanut butter cups. I used natural peanut butter and Belgian speculos cookies and they turned out to be really delicious."
"0","5","These are great. I added a layer of marshmallow cream between the peanut butter and chocolate on half. It is really sweet, but really great!!"
"0","4","I love these and so did everybody else that got to try them. I especially love how incredibly easy they are to make. They were my first peanut butter bars. I have one question though. I did use half a cup of butter and sugar less than the recipe asked for(i had read in the reviews somebody else ha done them this way too). Everything else i did excactly as in the directions. But i have i really hard time getting them out of the pan. Thy stick really bad to it. It cuts very easiy but when i want to take to take out a piece, half of sticks to the pan. Can anybody tell what i am doing wrong or what i can do to get them out easier? Is because i used less butter? I would be very thankful for any advice, as i plan on making them again. Theu are really so good!"
"0","5","These are so easy to make and taste wonderful! I melted the butter on the stove then added the peanut butter to melt before adding the powdered sugar and graham crackers. Everything combined easily in one pot. Refrigerated for about an hour before I added the chocolate to the top. Be sure to store in the fridge or they will melt just like a real Reese cup."
"0","5","So delicious and quite easy! Didn't have access to graham crackers so used some basic tea biscuits, and they were fine. Very yummy and a big hit with those I made it for."
"0","5","tastes just like a Reese's and is super easy to make! Can be thrown together in a hot minute, but need to chill for longer than an hour if you want to cut into bars otherwise it is very messy and ugly."
"0","4","These are very easy to make. Very easy to cut turns out just like the picture. I loved that it's an easy last minute dessert but I thought it lacked peanut butter flavor. The graham crackers over powered the dessert. I may try using crunchy peanut butter next time to see if it helps. I will make this again."
"0","5","Much Better than anticipated! These are excellent! They are easy and quick to make. Cures a craving!"
"0","4","These were pretty good. Perhaps the taste would have been better if I used regular peanut butter instead of the natural peanut butter that I had on hand. I chilled them so they would not be too soft, however, this made them very difficult to cut. Might give them another try in the future."
"0","5","I've made these several times so far and they never last more than a day! so good. Tastes just like a Reese's cup"
"0","5","YUM! I halfed the butter, used low fat honey graham crackers and natural (JIF) peanut butter -- still great. Plus, after I pressed the mixture into the 9x13, I used the same bowl to melt the chips & PB for 60 seconds in the microwave, voile la: one dish prep."
"0","5","These are so good that my husband has forbidden me to make them unless we are taking them somewhere!"
"0","5","Excellent! These turned out great! Will be making them again."
"0","5","Fast, easy, and better than peanut butter cups!"
"0","4","These were delicious however they were a little bit greasy. I'm wondering if 1/2 the amount of butter would do the job, without it crumbling apart."
"0","5","These are SO easy to make and they are a hit at every family gathering. I HAVE to show up with peanut butter bars or I am in trouble. :)"
"0","5","these were amazing!!!!! will make them again. I also only added 2 cups of confectioners sugar and a table spoon of peanut butter to the melted chocolate. YUM!!!!!!"
"0","5","Can't keep these in my house very long! I read the reviews and only used one stick of butter...was still delicious!"
"0","5","I made these both for myself and my husband, then for a family party. They were a HIT!! People loved them, and it was surprising to them how simple they are to make. Very delicious, easy, quick dessert."
"0","5","Luscious! I doubled the crumb (but not the butter or sugar) in the base mixture to make thicker bars and used white choc chips instead of semisweet, which, I can tell you, is WIN. A pinch of salt in the base mix wouldn't go amiss."
"0","3","These were ok. I was looking for more of a baked cookie and not this."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and this was a huge hit with my family. Definitely 5 stars!"
"0","5","I made this in 2 shallow 9x13 pans instead of one. Took one to work & the other on a retreat. I got RAVE reviews on them. They are for sure better the next day though. Chill them for a while. I also added a bit more graham crackers on the bottom layer, but overall a great recipe!"
"0","5","Exceptional! Truly. So easy to make and to absolutely die for."
"0","5","Absolutley wonderful!!! All the other reviews said it was just like Reeses peanut butter cups, they are right. Very easy to make too."
"0","5","I love this recipie! I tried replacing the confectioners sugar with 4 cups of granulated sugar and 4 tsp of corn starch and it turned out really good! (Except it turned out a little thick)"
"0","5","Delicious! I will DEFINITELY make these again!"
"0","4","These are great! I use a rolling pin and graham crackers in a plastic baggie. The texture turns out great."
"0","5","YUM made these for a cookie exhange.. since my oven was broken last christmas these were a perfectly delicious no bake bar. the cookie exchange was canceled do to a snow storm so I was stuck with 12 dozen.. lol... i couldn't help myself, they were gone pretty fast. :-)"
"0","5","This one got rave reviews from the family.it's so easy too!"
"0","4","AWESOME!! These taste better than Recess PB cups, ...with some modifications; Reduced the butter & sugar by half, used natural peanut butter (natural oils helped make up for the reduced butter without all the perservatives, hydrogenated oils & added sugar in regular peanut butter), & used dark chocolate instead. Can actually taste & enjoy the quality ingredients rather than all the sugar & extra calories, but still decadent!! My boys love this receipe & the new mod's - ENJOY!"
"0","5","Excellent, quick and easy!"
"0","5","I can't make these fast enough! Everyone loves them and they're so easy to make that even my kids can do it with little supervision... We love this recipe!"
"0","5","We make these all the time because they are super fast and easy and absolutely delicious."
"0","5","well I absotlutley loved this recipe, it does taste like peanut butter cups. I used crunchy peanut butter, which gives it that crunch and it was very good. my daughter and I enjoy making this together, but you should definatley try with the crunchy nuts.."
"0","4","Quick and easy the only thing to heat up the house is the microwave or stovetop to melt choco chips. Excellent. I used 12 Tbs Butter to cut fat but still holds well together. 6 if you half recipe which was plenty for little o' me. I followed anothers advise and ground up graham crackers fine and was sure to leave in refrigerator so would not soften"
"0","5","I made this treat for my boyfriend's family Christmas party. Since it was my first time meeting his entire family I wanted to take something yummy to the party. It was a HUGE hit! Everyone raved about it and the entire platter was empty by the end of the evening. If you want something that everyone will love then this is a great treat selection! It was an especially big hit with the younger children."
"0","5","Great bars! I added some cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg to the peanut butter part; and made the chocolate coating with white chocolate chips and a splash of vanilla extract. I also made the coating with 2 cups of chips (1 full bag) and 1/3 cups of peanut butter. My coworkers loved them! the didn't last the day."
"0","5","I think these will be made regularly at my house. Easy and so good."
"0","5","These were amazing!! Everyone loved them. I cannot wait to make them again."
"0","5","So delicious that my grandmother and great-aunt not only asked for the recipe, but ended up preferring it to Reese's cups."
"0","5","Simply Awesome!!!!!!"
"0","5","these were the best peanut butter bars I've ever had and they were so easy! And the best part is, you don't have to heat your oven up to make them! what can be better than that? my two year old can't seem to get enough of these. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","WOW! I did it exactly as suggested on one side of my pan and made the other half with chocolate graham crackers, then topped it with crushed reeses pieces prior to putting on the chocolate. Then I put 3 different kinds of chocolate on top of that, for that side and it was so good. This recipe is PERFECT as is but chocolate graham crackers made it more chocolaty and also good."
"0","5","These are delicious. I did as others suggested and used 1 1/2 sticks of margarine and that seemed to work fine."
"0","4","My best friend's mom used to make these for us a lot when we were kids. I am so excited to find the recipe. They are YUMMY!"
"0","5","I mad these with my 4 yr old son and he had so much fun helping me. My husband and sons loved them."
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","4","Would love to give this five stars but the 'crust' didnt' hold up well. It stuck to the pan. I think if I had decreased the butter it would have done much better. Very good otherwise."
"0","5","These are the best peanut butter bars ever! The crunchiness of the graham cracker crumbs make them really unique. They are better than Reeses!"
"0","5","It really does taste like a peanut butter cup. I brought them to a party and they were the first things gone. Amazing. I have had many requests for the recipe."
"0","5","I made this recipe only once before and gave it four stars because I had to chisel it out of my glass dish. It tasted good but the presentation was lacking due to me having to hack at it. ***However, this time I gave it five stars because I only made half the recipe and instead of using a glass dish, I used a cookie sheet lined with my Silpat mat! Once the pan chilled, I lifted the whole piece right out and placed it directly on my cutting board! Great presentation and excellent taste! Will make again and probably again and I'm sure again after that! ;-)"
"0","5","my family loved these .i will mking these for all of our summer picnics."
"0","5","I have made this recipe many times over and it is always a hit. I make it just as the recipe says. Very easy. Taste like reese's cups to me. Yum!"
"0","5","Awesome and perfect as is! Do not change the recipe, but make sure your graham crackers are fine before mixing."
"0","5","The only problems I had were that 1: the peanut butter burnt in the microwave. Probably my fault for not stirring enough! and, 2: I used a larger pan, I guess, so I had to double the amount of chocolate used, so that it covered all of the peanut butter mixture. Also-- I recommend NOT crushing the graham cracker by hand - it took forever! Even though the recipe isn't cooled yet, I tried the mixture and it was great! I think this recipe will taste really good!"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! My boyfriend and his son loved this recipe. However, I think next time I will try using only 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2. I think it would make me feel less guilty about eating more than 1 in a day!"
"0","5","These were awesome! I made no changes to the recipe itself and it turned out tasting very similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan. Worked just lovely!"
"0","5","Oh man, these are delicious! They taste just like peanut butter cups. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 inch square pan. Next time I'll reduce the butter in the crust slightly. These are great straight from the freezer!"
"0","5","This is my kids favorite, they ask me to make it all the time!! A regular treat in our house when we want something sweet to eat."
"0","5","Excellent! My family loved them. The only change I made was to add some milk chocolate to the topping because the semi-sweet chips ran out."
"0","5","So delicious! I took the suggestion of only using a stick and a half of butter, and it worked out perfectly. I can't get enough of them!"
"0","4","These are very good bars and everyone at the gathering I took them to was delighted to eat them! I took the advice of others and melted the pb with the butter and I shouldn't have as it made it a runny mess and I had to freeze it before I could put the chocolate on top! Not the fault of the recipe, mind you!"
"0","5","I JUST DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN..."
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!!"
"0","5","Very easy and VERY GOOD!! My whole family loved these. I'm making them again tonight :)"
"0","4","Taste was good but I couldn't get them out of the pan without the bottom falling apart and the chocolate top coming off. Kids liked them."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious and very easy! My whole family loves these! My son is such a fan that he has bragged about them on Facebook and directed anyone who has asked for the recipe to allrecipes.com :^D I have to admit, most of my family's favorite recipes are those that I've found right here. Love this site!"
"0","3","made as peanut butter cups - tasty, but melty"
"0","5","Good recipe, easy, tastes good. Good filler for cookie tray as well."
"0","5","I just made these and they are fantastic!!! I wouldn't change anything about this recipe--it's the BOMB!"
"0","4","my peanut butter layer did not get firm and it was in the freezer for a day. its was a little messy getting out of the pan, but very good."
"0","5","I made these last night, and they are so simple and SO GOOD! I doubled the 'frosting' ingredients to get rid of an old bag of chocolate chips, and per another reader's tip, refrigerated the peanut butter layer for 20 minutes before topping it with the chocolate. They turned out perfectly, and will be a staple in my recipe rotation. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","I used crunchy peanut butter- was just fine. My husband loved them!"
"0","5","These are delicious and very easy to make. They are definitly hard to mess up because I didn't have fresh graham crackers and people still loved them. I noticed but hey, it's choclate and peanut butter...can't go much wrong! :)"
"0","4","Loved these! Addictive! Had a REALLY hard time getting them out of the dish in one piece, though. Finally put it in the freezer...I think there might be too much butter, as they were pretty mangled but still yummy!"
"0","5","These are good, but be prepared...very rich and very sweet! I followed the recipe exactly. The peanut butter didn't set up enough in the refrigerator after only an hour, but they were perfect the next morning. One easy trick I did was to buy the graham cracker pie shells instead of having to chop up all of the crackers myself. The shell just crumbled into a fine powder. For 12 servings (2 cups), you would need ~1 and a half pie shells."
"0","5","I used less butter and milk chocolate chips instead. They were wonderful!"
"0","5","Oh, my goodness- these are delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and put them in the freezer. They were set in 30 minutes. My family loves them- way better than the candies you buy at the store!"
"0","5","Very good! The kids love them."
"0","2","The bottom layer was quite tasty when you first spread it, but I did not like the chocolate topping or the entire thing once it set. They did not cut easily and the pan should be greased because I had to keep scraping them up. Make the bottom and just eat that or skip the whole thing."
"0","5","One word....AMAZING! Loved these bars. Such an easy, fast and delicous dessert. The only thig I changed was I used 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. Great recipe!"
"0","5","i have made these twice so far and everyone has LOVED them. in fact, i brought them to work today and the whole batch only lasted an hour and everyone raved about them! the only thing i will say is this, the 1st time i made them, i made with name brand graham crackers and they turned out perfectly...and the 2nd time i made them, i used store brand graham crackers and they didnt turn out as strudy, in fact i had to add more graham crackers so they would hold shape and not be gooey. I dont know if its because of the name brand versus store brand, but who knows. So just a suggestion, use the name brand. :) but either way, they were delicious no matter the look or consistency :)"
"0","5","This was great! We didn't change a thing and they came out perfect."
"0","5","awesome, tastes so good"
"0","5","I made this recipe with carob chips instead of chocolate chips and reduced fat peanut butter instead of full fat. It turned out great and no one could tell that it was a 'healthier' version."
"0","5","Perfect! I wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","5","So good! I made these when I couldn't fire up the oven and i didn't have any flour :) they were AMAZING! I probably only used about a cup and a half of powdered sugar cause we ran out and I'm not 100% sure but i think i followed the rest of the instructions correct. I loved the texture of the 'crust.' So sweet and if u like peanut butter/chocolate combos then you'll LOVE this :D  Update: Made this again. Such a hit!!! A bit tough to get out of the pan without leaving patches of crust on it. Do NOT forget to refridgerate the crust before you put the chocolate peanut butter on. Also, don't wait too long before spreading the chocPB mix or it'll harden in the bowl and make it really difficult to spread. I had to keep remicrowaving mine :P Great recipe Nancy!!!"
"0","3","The bottom part has the right texture and taste is not far off from Reeses but I would try this with milk chocolate next time. Semi sweet was too bitter.. unlike most pb cups.~ just noticed I was to add 4T peanut butter to chocolate chips. (I had misread and added regular butter to the chips) That might help. I will try this next time or go milk chocolate."
"0","5","These taste exactly like the real thing!! I think I might increase the chocolate:peanut butter ratio next time though."
"0","4","Yumm-O made them with crunchy PB. Awesome to eat right outta the freezer!!"
"0","5","Um.....YUM! These really did taste like a reeses cup. I think it has something to do with the peanut butter in the chocolate? These are super easy with the food processor. I used my food processor to get the graham cracker crumbs really tiny but next time i'll just pulverize the heck out of them to get them even more smooth (think graham cracker dust). I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of shortening to the chocolate/peanut butter mixture to help it be really smooth and easy to pour. They came out looking beautiful. I've been to the Hershey factory in Hershey, PA and it smells like these bars there!!! Thank you so very much, I will be making these often."
"0","5","So delicious! I brought these to a youth party and they were a definite hit (besides the fact that I dropped them...)! My friends agree that they taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I will definitely make these again (and again, and again, and again...)."
"0","5","Easy, fast and delicious. I only had 1 1/4 cups of confectioner's sugar and they tasted great!!!"
"0","3","I had high hopes for these, but was let down. They were very simple to make, but didn't taste a thing like those candy bars they sell. I used 1/4 less butter, and 1/4 more peanut butter, and they still tasted like butter. I didn't care for the mixture of chocolate and pb on top either, i think just plain would have been fine. My husband liked them, but they are definately not a replacement for a reeses."
"0","4","Delicious! I used a smaller pan for a thicker bar. Presented beautifully! The only change I would make is to use better quality chocolate, chocolate chips didn't do the peanut butter layer justice."
"0","4","Good recipe. It was a hit at my daughter's birthday party."
"0","5","Awesome! Though I didn't grind the graham crackers up enough, so it came out a bit lumpy. But now I know for next time, which there will definitely be! :D"
"0","5","Fantastic!!!"
"0","5","Awesome!"
"0","4","Yummmm! My daughter and I enjoyed making these, too. Very rich so a small piece goes a long way!"
"0","5","Amazing! The only problem I had was the chocolate and crust separating when I cut it."
"0","3","These are good but not sure what the 5 star ratings are all about. Think I'll try some of the similar recipes on this site. And I might think about tweaking this recipe - definitely more peanut butter to up the peanut buttery taste and make some modifications to make it smoother, less gritty (yes, Reese's cups are a bit 'gritty' which I like, but this is a little less smooth than Reese's). Very inventive though to use graham cracker crumbs to mimic the grittiness of Reese's cups."
"0","5","OMG!!! These are great. Altough the bar is slightly stumpy and the portions are huge."
"0","5","My husband almost ate the entire batch in one sitting. These are amazing!"
"0","5","delicious! I loved it, and so did everyone else"
"0","4","I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out just like the picture. They were very easy to cut and didn't crumble. I think I might still like reeses better but my husband disagrees. I might have prefered a higher quality chocolate or possibly a milk or dark chocolate but the chocolate chips were fine too."
"0","5","Delicious - I don't know why there's half a star missing - you certainly can't get any closer to that familiar taste."
"0","5","Can't go wrong with this simple, no bake recipe! Really, whats not to love--peanut butter AND chocolate! For a delicious alternative-try using reese's pb cereal in place of graham crackers, and then use only half of sugar in recipe--still plenty sweet--and even more peanut-buttery!"
"0","5","I have a coffee at my house every week, and I made this for my ladies. They all loved it! Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"0","3","I was excited to try these, I am pregnant and can't get enough peanut butter these days. They were good, simple to make and rich! More for the kids I think, they were good but nothing special for me."
"0","5","My Reese's loving 11 year old loved these as her 'birthday cake' this year, as did everyone else at the party - everyone had at least two! I scaled the recipe up to 16 servings because we had a larger pan and it came out perfectly."
"0","5","These tasted better than a Reese's cup. Delicious. Everyone loved them and were debating over who should eat the last one. HAHA. Will make again! I made a half batch and put it in an 8X8 pan. I used a food processor to do the graham cracker crumbs. Was perfect."
"0","5","Better than Reece's! Thank you!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and tasted just like Reese's Peanut Butter cups. Very good and this is a recipe I will keep in my kitchen!"
"0","5","Yep, these are really good. The filling does taste just like a Reese cup!"
"0","5","Completely amazing. These are always a big hit when I take them to a party."
"0","5","Super easy to prepare! Did exactly what the instructions stated and eveyone liked them! Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","4","Great recipe! The texture was a little granular, so I recommend making it a little smoother with some milk or cream if possible. I used chunky peanut butter and found that it gave it a great taste! My huband loved these and I will definitely make them again!"
"0","4","This was a very good recipe. I did not have any powdered sugar in the house, therefore I used white sugar. Regardless, the recipe was very good. Maybe next time I'll use powdered sugar and it will be smoother. I will make this again!"
"0","5","Deee-lish. I made this with 1.5 sticks of butter, 1C semi sweet chocolate chips and 1C milk chocolate chips. Incredible. My only tip is to let them come back to room temp a bit before cutting or the chocolate comes right off. I cut half at room temp and then half once they had been in the fridge for several hours and the chocolate came right off of latter ones."
"0","5","SOOOOOOO good! Very yummy"
"0","5","Wow! These are excellent! My whole family raved over them! I made the recipe exactly as written!"
"0","5","Love this recipe. So easy to make and rich and delicious! I personally think the taste is more in line with Girl Scout Tagalong cookies than a Reese's Cup, but fantastic nonetheless!"
"0","5","Excellent! The best peanut butter bars I have ever had. My co-workers ate these up instantly! I wouldn't change anything about these at all-except make a double batch! Great recipe!!"
"0","5","I think this recipe was stolen from Reese's!! Exactly like a Peanut Butter Cup!"
"0","5","Better than the Tollhouse and Betty Crocker recipes for peanut butter bars!"
"0","5","Made these for my sons bake sale and they were a hit! The kids loved them as well as the adults. The best thing of all is they are a cinch to make. The only thing I did differently was use good chocolate instead of store bought chocolate chips."
"0","5","OMG these things are to die for! YUM"
"0","4","Yumm... I made this with half the butter and it tasted obscenely good. I don't why you'd ever want to add all the butter. I did, however, add another big glopping tablespoon (probably several tablespoons if measured out) of peanut butter to the mixture to make up for one less stick of butter. The mixture combined well in the mixer, set up well, and held up well when cut. Definitely an instant favorite. I was originally looking to replicate my grandma's old recipe and this did the trick. I would have given it five stars but I can't fathom eating two sticks of butter."
"0","5","yum! taste just like peanut butter cups."
"0","4","Not bad...still taste a little too graham crackery for me. I will add more peanut butter next time. These were well recieved by others."
"0","3","ok"
"0","5","I used 3/4 of a cup of margarine and these turned out perfectly!"
"0","5","These are fantastic!! They will be gone from the troop building by the end of the day I am certain."
"0","5","yum yum yum! thx!"
"0","5","Wonderfully easy, followed the recipe to the letter and it all worked out very nicely. Wouldn't change a thing...if you love peanut butter and chocolate then you have to try this!!"
"0","4","easy to make and easy to eat."
"0","4","These taste just like reeses peanut butter cups..So rich that i have to make it in small batches...Kids always love these and they are very simple!!!"
"0","5","these are great and are a quick easy dessert bar!~"
"0","5","OH WOW! These were amazing and easy to make. Both my husband and I thought the longer they were in the fridge the better they tasted... So any tips would be to make ahead of time so that the mixture really gets to mix together."
"0","5","These are great. Don't leave out of fridge too long it gets a little soft. Only difference was I used 2 cups of chocolate chips as I didn't want to put 1/2c. back in the pantry."
"0","5","These bars are OH SO rich! They are also quick and easy. Next time I make them I am going to try to shape the peanut butter mixture into balls and dip them in chocolate. If it works, they'll make great gifts at Christmas time."
"0","5","Delicious and i made exactly as specified but were nice and firm ,not too soft as others had reviewed. Will make them only for special occasions though because they are too addictive."
"0","5","Perfect as written! I couldn't find the packaged graham cracker crumbs... 2 cups = 1 'sleeve' of grahams. Thanks for this rich and delicious recipe!"
"0","5","YUM! I made a few alterations to this recipe - but, really... how can you go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter! I crunched up graham crackers in a freezer bag - probably about 3 cups. I also increased the amt of PB I used in both the crust and the chocolate topping. I also increased the amt of melted chips and used a whole bag (2 cups) in the topping, and I added about 2 Tbsp of butter to the choc. topping as I melted it on the stovetop - helps make it a bit more glossy and smooth. YUMMY! Next time, I will use powdered sugar in the crust."
"0","5","Incredible!!! This is one of those recipes that you see and just have to make right then, it looks so good! I didn't have graham crackers, but I did have Nutter Butters on hand. Substituted those, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Hardened in the fridge, cut and served - A BIG hit!! Will definitely be making these the next party we go to.."
"0","4","These are excellent. Mine were not crumbly at all and adding wax paper is a must before filling the pan. I followed this recipe fully - though I melted the margarine in a pan on the stove and then the graham crumbs, sugar and PB while the heat was still on - I think this may have made a difference helping to melt the mix a little better thus, less crumbling? I also microwaved the chocolate chips and the peanut butter. It was yummy. The only thing I will do different next time is add a bit more chocolate."
"0","4","Very good! Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","Very good! My hubby loved them. I loved that I didn't have to bake them!"
"0","5","Taste just like reeses! I love them!!"
"0","5","Made these and everyone loved them! I didn't have enough graham crackers so I threw in some corn flakes. Turned out okay, but I'm sure it would've been even better with all graham cracker crumbs. Also ran out of peanut butter so didn't have enough to mix in with the chocolate topping. Turned out fine! I even liked them, and I'm not a peanut butter fan (I purposefully made them so I wouldn't eat any- didn't work!)"
"0","5","These were really good and quick! Next time I think I'll add a bit more peanut butter to the base and a bit less peanut butter to the chocolate, but overall great recipe!"
"0","5","This is such a simple dessert but has two of the most loved flavors. Easy to make and easy to eat."
"0","5","It was incredibly ease to make! And it was the biggest hit at Christmas. Never thought melting chocolate was so easy."
"0","4","Yum! I made it with chunky peanut butter and only used semi-sweet chocolate chips (no PB) in the top layer. I made it in a 10x15 jelly roll pan, but would go with the recommended size pan next time since the bars came out thinner than I'd like. I chilled the bars before frosting as suggested by other reviewers."
"0","3","I made these for a Christmas Party and couldn't bring them. They were tasty, but crumbled everywhere...just too messy looking for a party. I am going to tweak this, so they don't crumble. They were delicious!!!"
"0","5","Oh. My. God. Perfection! I am in love with Reeses PB cups and to me, they taste so similar. There are a lot of reviewers that complain about the graham cracker crust being too grainy, but I think it's great. I used 1.5 sticks of butter instead of 2 and it did not have the over-butter taste that people complained about. This will be a lot faster for you if you have a food processor for the graham crackers. Also, I used a whole 12oz bag of choc chips along with the 4 tbs of PB. Definitely freeze the crust for 15 mins and the chocolate smooths on easily. This dessert will be a true crowd-pleaser and I can't wait to take it everywhere, this is a nice substitute for my pb cookies that family is always begging me to make. You'll love it!!"
"0","5","Very good. I love that I can whip these up super fast without turning on the oven."
"0","5","This is very similiar to one I've made for years. We don't add peanut butter to the chocolate chips but I bet it would be good, I'm going to have to try it. We also just use an entire bag of chocolate chips. This recipe is made on a cookie sheet, so everything is spread thinner and goes farther :) I like making these because they aren't as salty like the Reese's, and are more sweet. YUM!"
"0","5","My family really enjoyed these. Was like chocolate on top of peanut butter fudge."
"0","3","My husband really loves these. I use less powdered sugar than called for, but I always do. Pretty good."
"0","5","So easy but so yummy. Followed recipe exactly except I used light jiffy and that worked fine. Also, set peanut butter bottom portion in fridge for 15min before spreading choc, refridge 1 hour to set then left out 10min before cutting."
"0","5","Wow, these really taste like a reeses peanut butter cup!!!!! I made them and they were gone in a flash!!! Everyone is requesting them as a treat for Christmas so I think I might pruce them up with red and green m&m's."
"0","3","Ok, so my bars didn't turn out so well. I added a little less sugar so that they wouldn't be as sweet. My main issue was the texture of the bottom half, the peanut butter layer. It was too soft and crumbly....and grainy. The graham cracker crumbs I used were finely ground, but i still found it too grainy. I probably won't be making these again...but all in all, the flavor was good, and the texture of the chocolate layer was awesome."
"0","5","Really good and super easy. Perfect if your in a hurry. Thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious, everyone loved these. The chocolate/butterscotch combination is amazing."
"0","4","These are very easy! Good but yes a bit to much butter.I think next time i will cut the butter down to 1 1/2 cups and decrease the topping or maybe i will just use Nutella instead of the chips.Still very good and worked to help get rid of the sweet tooth i had today.Will make again thanks."
"0","4","I made these for my boyfriend who loves peanut butter and he claimed they were better than Reeses!"
"0","5","YUM!!! I made them with natural peanut butter (still with sugar added though) and they were great. We ate the entire pan right away."
"0","4","These are really good! They taste just like a peanut butter cup! My only complaint is that they get mushy if not stored in the fridge."
"0","4","Went to review these, and was surprised to see that I'd made these before. I had decided that next time I would soak the graham cracker crumbs in the melted butter for a bit first, because I don't care for the little bit of crunchiness they give the peanut butter layer (and I ground them finely in the food processor). Well, I guess I'll try that the third time I make them! Kids really like them, though."
"0","5","Great recipe and very eash to make!"
"0","5","These are my husbands favorite!!"
"0","4","Not quite like a peanut butter cup, but very tasty nonetheless. Easy to make, except I had problems melting the chocolate chips."
"0","5","I followed the directions exactly as written and it was so yummy! I made it for my husband's birthday because his favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and he loves peanut butter. He liked these bars more than his favorite candy! I will be making this again, but only for special occasions cause they're so bad for you."
"0","3","These are good! Next time I make these, I will use an expensive melting chocolate bar, and I will put the cereal into the processor, I'm a texture girl!"
"0","4","This was good but not great. Definitely needs less butter. My kids liked it though. I think a mix of semi-sweet & milk chocolate chips would be a good compromise, at least at my house. I think I would make these again, with those adjustments."
"0","5","Crumbly bottom layer that is easily forgiven by the amazing taste!"
"0","4","good, but a little buttery for me. maybe use half butter next time."
"0","5","I loved these bars. Very chewy, but smooth and creamy when it starts to melt in your mouth. Unfortunately, my boyfriend didn't find them delicious so I'm going to freeze them. They do freeze well as I cut a piece out and froze it last night. Kept well and dethawed nicely. No funky taste or flavoring afterwards. I used an 8x8 pan and my bars were nice and thick with a heavy layer of chocolate. Any Reese cup lover's dream in that pan."
"0","5","I will add some salt next time."
"0","5","Okay, If the way to a mans heart is through his stomach, you`ll win him with this one !!"
"0","5","These were Great!!! Just like my favorite Candy at the checkout. Vary easy and beautiful when cut to serve - I will include these in my Christmas gift collection - Thanks for the recipe:)"
"0","5","a huge hit where i work. these were perfect"
"0","5","So easy and so delicious! Love this recipe!"
"0","3","I didn't care for the grahm crackers in the bars. I was looking for something more creamy. They were also very hard to get out of the pan. You would have to removem them right after taken out of the fridge or they would be to soft and come apart."
"0","5","Really good and so easy to make. It does like a reese peanut butter cup. Next time I will use milk chocolate for the topping."
"0","5","Love this! They are a family favorite now and my get out of jail free card. Whenever I have made my husband mad I make these and all is forgiven. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","Loved 'em! Great and easy recipe."
"0","5","Taste just like reese's (if not better! :D) I jus have a problem with mine setting up. they've been in the fridge for about 1 1/2 hrs and the peanut butter part is still not fully set. Maybe I'll wait til tomorrow or later on to try again. They were still delicious though! I used crunchy pb in the chocolate part and sprinkled chocolate sprinkles and graham cracker crumbs over the top of mine"
"0","4","these are really yummy and super easy. Although the peanut butter layer was still gooey after chilling them in the fridge for an hour, so I moved them to the freezer and that helped. I took someone elses suggestion of chilling the peanut butter layer for a few minutes before adding the chocolate layer and had no problems with the chocolate melting through. YUM!"
"0","3","Okay, something I don't say often....way too much butter. I should have read the other reviews, but instead I am left with these to serve at my Halloween party tomorrow night. Oh well, they are okay I guess but seriously, they do tasts like eating butter."
"0","4","Followed recipie to begin with, after i had it all mixed up there was way to much butter in it, tasted more like peanut butter flavored butter so i added more of everything else. Next time ill only use 1 stick of butter, but it came out good they were gone in about 20 min."
"0","5","These were great. I managed to make the 12 servings last for 11 days' worth of desserts (doubled up once!), and I didn't get tired of it. I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but seeing as there are 715 before me, I'll skip it this time. These were quick and easy, and I made them exactly as written. I used creamy (smooth) peanut butter; it didn't say whether to use crunchy instead, but I don't like that as much anyway. These also keep very well in the fridge. The graham cracker crust did have a slightly grainy texture to it; it was good, mind you, just a little unusual. I will recommend this recipe when I get the chance."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Really rich! Just one and your sweet tooth will be satisfied. Good flavor and super easy! They didn't last long at my house."
"0","4","Great taste, but following recipe exactly results in awful texture (and I'm not talking crunchy b/c of the graham crumbs). Waaay too much butter! Kept it in fridge overnight to harden and tried it the next day; feels like biting into a stick of peanut butter flavored butter! Will definitely try again, but will reduce butter to 1/2 cup. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","I used milk chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate chips. They tasted very good. My boyfriend went gaga over them! He is a big Reese's lover, and said these do come quite close. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that it doesn't seem to get creamy enough because of the the graham cracker crumbs in the mix."
"0","5","Made as directed but made 1 1/2 batches & put in a spring roll pan. I don't think they taste like or have the consistency of the infamous pb cups tho. Still excellent!"
"0","4","Very good and everyone loved them,but the bottom stayed soft and stuck to the pan. Next time I think I will try using less butter like someone else suggested. Other then that they were good.Will try this recipe again."
"0","4","Good, but rich. The graham crumbs in the crust threw me off a little since I was expecting a creamier consistency (like a Reeces). Would make again though."
"0","4","I would suggest ot use name brand graham crackers. I didn't and it turned out kinda gritty but the longer it sat in the fridge the gritty went away. My friend loved them and took all of them home."
"0","4","I didn't have a problem with the chocolate being 'too hard' but I did have a problem with the crust. It seems like maybe there is too much butter. It is greasy and really unsturdy. I love the taste though. Very good. My husband thinks they are really sweet but I think they're just right. I will probably try out the recipe again but with less butter or a smaller size pan."
"0","3","These were just okay to me. I used a 7' x 11' pan and cut them into 40 bite-sized pieces. They have to be kept refrigerated or they become too soft and I'm not a fan of cold chocolate. Preparation was super easy using Keebler graham cracker crumbs. I probably won't make them again though, they just didn't 'wow' me."
"0","4","These really do taste like Reese's peanut butter cups. These are super rich, I cut them into 24 squares instead of 12 and I think they're still decent-sized. I used 1 and 1/3 cups of butter, any less and it would have been too crumbly. Very decadent but easy to make. My only gripe is that the chocolate is too hard. Next time I might use a milk chocolate ganache topping."
"0","5","Taste just like Reese's PB cups. Love them! Will try them with 1/2 a cup less butter next time."
"0","5","I made these bars for my husband's birthday because he loves Reese's PB cups. They are wonderful! The only change I made to the recipe is instead of adding the 4 TBSP of PB to the melted chocolate chips, I added a bag of the Reese's PB chips. I did that because I had a bag left over from baking last year and wanted to use it up before it expired. I put the PB base in the fridge for about 15 minutes before I put the chocolate topping on. Then after I put the topping on I let it set out for about a half hour then put it in the fridge for about an hour to set. They get too hard if kept in the fridge so I keep them on the counter and haven't had any problems with the layers separating or with cutting them. They're very rich butI will be making these again soon!"
"0","4","Delicious. Just like peanut butter cups!"
"0","5","These are really good! I made mine with milk chocolate chips. I refridgerated the bottom for about 1/2 hour before adding the chocolate topping, but they didn't stick together very well. Maybe I won't refridgerate it as long next time. Delicious!"
"0","5","I whipped these up last night - super easy recipe and SO tasty! I made half the recipe and put it in a 7x11 pan and they were a little on the thin side, so I'd probably use a smaller casserole dish next time so they'll be a little thicker. My husband is a HUGE Reeses fan, so I know he's going to love these. I do think you can get away with less butter than the recipe calls for, and I'll probably cut it down by 1/3 next time and see how it comes out. Thanks for the great recipe! :)"
"0","4","These were really good! I actually like them more than reeses cups, the graham cracker gave it a special crunch!"
"0","5","Wow! These are so good! I also tried it with milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet because my husband wanted me to, but I think they'd be good either way. My sons love them. They do taste a lot like peanut butter cups. I will definitely make these for gatherings. I think I will buy some foil baking cups to pour them into before they set to make them look a little nicer and maybe a little swirl of chocolate on each. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","taste just like Reese's cups! Very rich."
"0","5","Excellent, exactly as written. Freezing the bars with hope they'll survive a picnic at the beach."
"0","5","All the grandkids loved these; said they were better than Reeses. I cut them in small squares to fit in the mini paper muffin cups."
"0","4","My kids loved them but I thought they were just OK. Next time I will try adding salt like others suggested. They were really easy to make and I had no problem cutting them."
"0","5","I've said it before and I will say it again these are the BEST peanut butter bars ever! I make these all of the time and people just rave over them. They are gone as soon as I set them on the counter at parties and people have taken some and hidden them so they do not miss out. People refer to these as Reese's on crack - SO GOOD!!! These are good as written but I usually use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet."
"0","5","This recipe was very easy and quick to make. Great for unexpected company and kids! I think there is a bit to much butter in it for my taste, next time I will only use 1/2 cup instead. I used natural peanut butter and everything turned out fine. Definitely needs to stay in the fridge though! ;-)"
"0","4","This is very nice - sweet and really rich, but nice. In order to really make it taste like a peanut butter cup, you need to add a little salt to the peanut butter layer."
"0","5","This recipe is very forgiving. Made with Chocolate Graham Crackers and mixture of white & chocolate chips too. Very Yummy!"
"0","5","Use milk chocolate chips instead... and we will probably double the recipe this time. These were delicious and easy."
"0","5","I've made these many times. Everyone LOVES them and they are very easy to make. Better than Reese's."
"0","4","This was a very good recipe. It was VERY simple to make. It's a nice, quick candy."
"0","3","they were pretty good in flavor but the texture felt like i was chewing on sand maybe i did something wrong but I looked and looked and I don't think i did"
"0","5","Best Peanut butter bars ever, easy to make and very creamy."
"0","5","AMAZING!!!"
"0","5","Chocolate and peanut butter = the best combination ever! Just like Reeses, but maybe a bit sweeter. Very easy! I made half the recipe and used an 8x8in pan, and was able to cut it into 16 bars. Next time I will line the pan with foil or plastic wrap, so that I can remove them from the pan, then cut into squares (I had some trouble getting the first piece out and the corners). I might double the chocolate layer next time too."
"0","5","A wonderful option for people like me who like to get their peanut butter fix. And they do taste like Reeses cups! I will definately make these again!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious. Definitely satisfies that PB/Chocolate craving. As a child they would serve these to us at school and called them 'peanut butter candy.' I have looked forever for this recipe. Wonderful!"
"0","5","This was a great recipe-wouldn't change a thing!!!"
"0","4","these are delicious! i pack my fiances lunch for work every morning, and i try to make sure there's a home made treat in there for him everydsy. I just made these and they are quick and simple an oh so tasty. the only thing i did differently was add 5 tbs peanut butter to the chocolate chips instead of just 4 because the mixture was still a tad too bitter, and i used 1 1/2 sticks of butter as opposed to 2."
"0","5","Easy and they loved them at work."
"0","5","Makes more than it says. These are SO good!"
"0","5","What an unbelievable recipe!!! This was SOOOO easy to make, and it was incredibly good. I didn't have graham cracker crumbs (pre-done). I used my amazing Vitamix and it used about two packages of graham crackers ground up. Each package seemed to make one cup of crumbs. Will make this again and again. This is going in my cookbook, for sure!!! The only thing that confused me on this recipe is the serving of 12… This made WAY more than 12 bars. To get 12 bars, you would have to cut these into enormous bars… I made decent size squares and it came out to be about 42 squares."
"0","5","What an awesome recipe! My son has a Peanut allergy so I substituted Sunbutter for the peanut butter and they were soooo awesome! Thank you!"
"0","5","I am so happy to have stumbled across this recipe! I can eat peanut butter by the spoonfuls, and adding chocolate just puts me on cloud 9! Using only 1.5 sticks of butter my base came out a little dry. I would like the PB flavor to come out a little more than the graham cracker, so I may add bit more PB next time and see how that turns out. Processing the graham crackers and melting the ingredients as suggested work great. Many thanks for the recipe and all the suggestions!"
"0","5","WOW!!! These were delicious and very easy to make. I took someone elses suggestion and cut down on the butter. I only used 1 1/2 sticks and they still turned out great!! I highly recommend this recipe."
"0","4","Very good. Everyone in the office loved them. Definitely keep refrigerated."
"0","5","These are easy to make and very good. They remind me of the buckeyes I make at Christmas without all the effort."
"0","5","I had to modify this recipe because of what I had at home, and it was still great. I put the graham crackers in the blender to get them really fine, and since I didn't have enough, I used Quaker Oatmeal Square cereal blended as well. I also used natural peanut butter (organic from Costco) and had to cut the amount down to 2/3 cup because of the strong peanut taste. I also took the advice of another reader and cut the bars after they had cooled for 10 min, and then let them cool the rest of the way- the chocolate doesn't break as much."
"0","5","This stuff is famous at the summer camp I used to go to. They called it 'Nestor Cake!'"
"0","5","I halved the recipe & only had dark choco chips. Everyone loved them!! I'm forcing myself to step away ♥"
"0","4","Although these were very tasty, they were so rich that they went slowly at my house"
"0","5","Incredible recipe. Easy and fast and everyone raves about them."
"0","5","They are wonderful! Followed directions exactly."
"0","5","Wow. Wonderful!! I followed directions exactly as Nancy posted. Thank you for a great recipe."
"0","5","WOW! Tastes just like the peanut butter cups, really. They are dangerously good."
"0","5","excellent. be sure to make the graham cracer crumbs very fine for the best texture."
"0","5","Made just as the recipe is written and they turned out great. Everyone loved them, they did not last long. Super easy. This is a keeper recipe!"
"0","5","I tried reducing the butter by 1/2 stick as another reviewer suggested but the results were drier and more crumbly than I would have liked. I will try this recipe again as written. Good taste and easy."
"0","5","I made these last night and was amazed had they turned out. Just like the picture you see. And I used a food chopper to ground up the graham cracker, this made it easier. I'm not crazy about peanut butter, but I had others to try them out. Was told they were to die for, so I will be making them again. A keeper. Thanks"
"0","5","LOVE the ease and taste - only thing I was disappointed in was that I 'lost' some of them to cracked tops or crumbly peanut butter bottoms that fell apart (which surprised me, b/c I used the whole 2 sticks of butter it called for, thinking that would help hold it together - seemed too dry without.) Maybe I should have pressed into the pan harder, and scored/cut the top before they fully chilled. Regardless, they were VERY well received and hubby (not a sweets guy) gave an 'Oh my...' when he tried one (and went back for more...)"
"0","5","So decadent - perfect for peanut butter cup lovers. Stores well on counter or in fridge for a cool treat."
"0","5","Chocolate and peanut butter go together like heaven. This recipe is quick and easy and always tastes amazing. The bars are also very rich so you can cut them small and it serves a lot of people. It's one of my go-to recipes."
"0","4","I tried the peanut butter mixed in with the chocolate and didn't like it as much as the traditional recipe. However this is always a favorite!!"
"0","5","I didn't have the chocolate chips but I did have some unsweetened chocolate. I used the equal amount of that (with a TON of added sugar to make it sweet) and ended up with it thick instead of runny but I put it over the mixture like frosting.. and despite that, this was still the best bars EVER!! I cannot wait to go to the store and get proper chips for this! I could have eaten the 'crust' all by itself!"
"0","5","Taste very much like a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup! Excellent and super easy. Next time I may add a 1/2 cup more grand cracker crumbs, came out a little too smooth. Not that smooth is to complain about! I don't put five stars on anything that doesn't deserve it. A very quick, no fuss dessert."
"0","5","easy and delish!"
"0","5","this is awesome fun 4 everyone"
"0","3","These were alright. They are very very very rich! Better the second day, but I probally won't make them again. They really did not get firm, so they were soft and mushy."
"0","4","These taste awesome!! I tried a couple substitutions, and it came out splendidly!! Instead of graham cracker crumbs, I used Oreo Cookie crumbs, and instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used 72% dark Swiss chocolate. Those substitutions made them extra chocolatey, but you can still enjoy the PB taste under it!!"
"0","5","awesome...! I am a huge fan of anything peanut butter and this is superb. Definitely follwo recs to cool PB layer in fridge for 30 minutes or so. I also used a cuisinart to pulverize the graham crackers. Would suggest using 2 cups of choc chips instead of just 1.5 cups...Awesome! I will be freezing half for another time so I don't pork out on the entire pan!"
"0","2","They were just okay. I could not get the graham crackers fine enough so the texture was not quite right. Probably will not try again."
"0","5","I make these for church and everybody loves them. I rarely have any to take home."
"0","5","These are fabulous!!! If you like Reese's peanut butter cups....you will LOVE these!!! This recipe is a must try!"
"0","5","Everytime I make these for anyone, I get asked for the recipe- no fail. They are so gooey and a little messy to eat, but trust me- no one will mind. Just grab a spoon and dig in :) I use milk chocolate instead of semisweet. Yum!"
"0","5","These were yummy! just like PB cups. I have tried another version of these and it is not as good as this recipe. My boyfriend says he doesn't like PB and he ate almost the entire pan. Delish!!!"
"0","4","i didnt have quite enough graham crackers or peanut butter and they were still great! and i used milk chocolate chips. i dunno if they would taste alot better with semi sweet but thats all i had.."
"0","5","Made this recipe for a birthday party and it was a huge hit!!! The next day it tasted even better, so next time I might make it a day ahead. Beware...this stuff is addicting!!"
"0","5","Used about 1 and a quarter stick of butter instead of 2 sticks and pressed it in an 8x8 pan. Really sweet,so i cant eat too much. I also cut the chocolate topping to 2 tbsp of butter instead of 4 and it tasted good! Not sure ill make this again though bc i am trying to watch what i eat"
"0","5","These were wonderful and so easy to make!"
"0","5","Everyone who has ever tasted this after I made it instantly rolled their eyes into the back of their head and let out a nice aaaaaaaaahhh or mmmmmmmm. People especially like them just a little warm."
"0","5","AMAZING! I live in the UK and it's hard to find Reeses anywhere here. This recipe is a good alternative, and so easy! Yum (:"
"0","5","OK I used Jif,Hersheys and Keebler Honey Grahams,YUM!It tastes like PB cups!Using it again!Also a Fathers Day success!!!!But,the PB kept sticking to the bottom of the pan,so I may use around half the chocolate on top and half on bottom to sandwich it...it may be worth it!I'll update it next time I make it,it may turn out like a PB cup,a goal for sure! :-)"
"0","5","So freakin good. I needed chocolate and peanut butter because I was PMSing and this was recommended to me by Coot226. It was exactly what I needed. I used I can't believe it's not butter sticks and used low fat graham crackers and the turned out awesome. It does taste like peanut butter cups. If you love peanut butter cups you have to try this."
"0","5","I love making candies, and have tried numerous recipes for my peanut butter balls that I am famous (in my family, atleast) for. I liked my old recipe, but this sounded interesting, so I tried it. OMG! They taste closer to Reeses than anything I have ever tried. This is my new recipe. I make them into balls, freeze, and dip them in chocolate bark instead of the (easier) bar way. THis makes for greeat food gifts that (I promise) will highly impress folks!"
"0","5","Wow, they really are like peanut butter cups! I only used 3/4 cup butter (1 and 1/2 sticks), which worked fine and made them a touch healthier. I think the longer these sit, the better because the graham crackers get nice and soft. And by the way, I doubled the recipe, and one 14.4 oz package of graham crackers was the perfect amount (when crushed) to equal 4 cups."
"0","5","These are really good! When you have a chocolate and peanut butter craving, this is the go to recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. My guys can't wait to get home today from work and school to finish off the rest of them."
"0","5","De-lish! Tastes just like Reeces!"
"0","5","This receipe is perfect just the follow the directions. I made this for a team of volleyball players and they LOVED IT! Made it for church, and home,..can't go wrong with this one."
"0","5","These are excellent! Thanks for the recipe, my fiance and his son can't get enough! I took other reviewers suggestions and used a little less sugar and butter."
"0","4","These are good. I took other's advice and cut the butter back to 1.5 sticks. The bar is a little crumbly but not too much so. I will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","These are so much like Reese's peanut butter cups! My kids and co-workers went nuts for these. I only had 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips so I subbed the rest with milk chocolate and it turned out fine."
"0","5","I've died and gone to heaven!! These are insanely good and addicting. OMG!!"
"0","5","I had to stop making these scrumptious treats as they overpower my willpower! I just can't stop eating them they are so good. Be sure to make these, but beware. They also freeze well!!"
"0","4","I hate peanut butter cups, but I like these. Most people raved about them. I did adjust the recipe to use more peanut butter and less butter, for better flavor."
"0","3","i used cookie crumbs and decreased the butter. for some reason these were still really buttery tasting. it tasted more like reeses pieces than reeses peanut butter cups."
"0","5","Very Good!"
"0","4","I used 1-1/2 sticks butter and it turned out just fine. I love chocolate and peanut butter. This turned out too sugary though. Think I'll try 1-1/2 cups sugar next time. It was good. I was just expecting better I guess."
"0","5","love these they taste like resses pb cups"
"0","3","Delicious bars, although they didn't have a lot of peanut butter taste. I only used one cup of sugar and then next time I make them I think I'll skip the sugar completely and add more peanut butter. I also used a 9X9 pan so that my bars were thicker."
"0","5","I have an AMAZING lemon bar recipe that knocks the socks off every single person i've served it to. But...these peanutbutter bars are the ONLY RECIPE that has beaten my lemon bars. they are SO GOOOOD!"
"0","5","Yum, no one could resist."
"0","5","These are so yummy and so easy to make!!"
"0","5","Great recipe and very simple too! If you love recees pb cups, this is perfect! It tastes exactly like the candy, down to the texture and everything. Very nice :)"
"0","5","Taste very good! Great for potlucks and so fast to make."
"0","5","This is an awsome recipe! if you love reese's then your sure to love these.. fast and easy to make too!! Thank you"
"0","5","I can't keep my husband away from these! He said they taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (his favorite). I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and they still turned out great."
"0","5","These taste just like Reece's Peanut Butter Cups!"
"0","4","some members of my family didnt like the 'grainy texture' of the bar."
"0","2","These were very rich, and with only 2 in our house it was hard to eat it all. Probably wouldn't make it again unless I would take it to a party/potluck."
"0","5","One word DELICIOUS!which is really weird since i have never like peanutbutter cups anyways i made these in muffin cups but they turned out huge.i couldn't even finish the whole one :O .and also i think next time i'll double the chocolate part and put a layer of that in the bottom.thnx."
"0","5","Fantastic recipe -- very easy and absolutely delicious! Like some of the other reviews, I found that these can be a little gooey, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs and they came out perfect. And the longer you leave them in the fridge, the better they are!   Love this recipe :)"
"0","5","Being that there are over 500 reviews there is no need to put up another one... however, I can't help it. These are OUT OF THIS WORLD - CRAZY GOOD."
"0","5","These are fantastic! And easy to make! Thanks!"
"0","4","I did not think I needed to use a whole cup of butter, so I just did a 1/4 cup like someone else suggested. I don't ever have graham crackers, so I just decided to use wheat flour. It worked great! I just added a little cinnamon for the graham flavor. I only had milk chocolate chips, but they were way too sweet, so I added a couple T of cocoa. Anyway, they were good even though I made tons of adjustments! Thanks!"
"0","5","Easy to make and everyone enjoyed them."
"0","5","Wonderful!!! My roommates and I loved it and it's so rich that you're totally satisfied with a few bites (no gorging myself on the whole batch in one night!) The only thing I might change is using one stick of butter instead of two, because the butter taste is really strong."
"0","5","These were great!"
"0","5","I am my own worst critic, so I ALWAYS find something wrong with what I make...but this recipe...this I believe is the best thing that I have ever made!!! And it was so easy!! And soooooo good! I am bringing them to a family function tomorrow and will simply await the rave reviews!!!!"
"0","5","These are so good, I wouldn't change a thing! The graham crackers give it a little surprise crunch!"
"0","5","Everyone loved these at our family gathering! Easy to make too!"
"0","5","OH. MY. GOD!!!!!!!!!! THESE ARE THE BEST THINGS EVER!! They are so easy and I even used reduced fat peanut butter.. and its fabulous. I'm in utter shock of how good these are. I highly recommend them."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe. My wife eye's lit up after the first bite. Very rich was her comment. I used a gourmet natural peanut butter. I took the advice of another reviewer and refrigerated the peanut butter mixture before adding the chocolate (about 15 - 20 min)."
"0","5","Very easy to make, and a huge hit wherever we take it. Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","4","Very Good! but super Rich. Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","3","Pretty good in theory, but they are too buttery and not peanutbuttery enough. Next time I make it I'll use half the butter and twice the peanut butter."
"0","5","These tasted great, super easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","These are Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. To set them up faster, I put them in the freezer and it worked like a charm."
"0","5","What's not to like? I had to stab myself with a fork to stop eating the peanut butter/chocolate combo. YUMYUM."
"0","5","Man oh man oh man! These have become a favorite in my house, we all love them. Great recipe."
"0","5","Very fast and easy. I used Smuckers natural peanut butter. They turned out fine. Natural peanut butter is thicker, so maybe it gave a good consistency."
"0","5","These were very good, the whole family loved them!"
"0","5","Made these for my husband. His school's peanut butter bars are a favorite childhood memory of his. These were super easy to make and tasted really good. He keeps sneaking in the kitchen to eat yet another one!"
"0","5","Super rich dessert. Perfect with a glass of milk. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. :o)"
"0","5","Perfect- People couldn't get enough of these! With melted chocolate on top, it was just like eating a Reese's PB cup!"
"0","5","I made this for a bake sale at school. They were easy, looked beautiful, and sold out. they didn't get soft being out in the open which was a concern."
"0","4","Very good!! And RICH!! Next time I will be sure and crush the grahm crackers even more and may add a tad more peanut butter needs just a tad more peanut taste."
"0","5","I made these for my New Years Eve party and they were a blast! Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","All I have to say is: Da Bomb! I used natural peanut butter and the slight grittiness of peanuts (of the brand I used) absolutely made this!"
"0","5","easy and wonderful"
"0","5","These are great! I love the recipe as is, but for a healthy twist I use coconut oil and added wheat germ for the crust and low fat graham crackers. I also use dark chocolate chips for the top and instead of spreading over the crust I dot the chocolate and use a fork to make a marble design. These are GREAT!"
"0","5","Yum yum yum! As suggested by someone else, I used only 1.5 sticks butter. Too good. I won't be able to let myself make these very often. Kids, hubby, friends love them."
"0","4","Yummy!!! But the peanut butter mixture sticks to the pan a lot..."
"0","2","Turned out really gooey... wished for something a little better!"
"0","3","Next time I will make these with less peanut butter crust and more chocolate."
"0","5","Closest thing to a Reese Cup that I have found."
"0","4","I took these to work and they were gone in no time. Good thing I tried one before I put them out. They were delicious, but a little too soft and were falling apart when I cut them - not sure how to fix that - maybe more graham cracker?"
"0","5","The best ever....I have replaced the semi-sweet chips with milk chocolate (11 oz) and also add Reeses peanut butter chips (11 oz). It is very, very rich & decadent!"
"0","4","It was a little dry on the bottom, I'd recommend using a little less icing sugar than recommended. Also, smooth peanut butter is much better than chunky peanut butter."
"0","5","I made these tonight due to craving something sweet. Wow! These are so easy to make and do really taste like a peanut butter cup. I used a mini chopper to make the graham cracker crumbs more smooth, but other than that followed the rest of the recipe completely.My family really liked them and my husband said 'these are awesome!' and ate 3 of them. Next time I will try to make the mini peanut butter cups as another reviewer suggested."
"0","5","Wow! My husband loves Reese's peanut butter cups and he went crazy for these! I made these for Christmas Eve and everyone loved them. I did take another reviewer's suggestion to melt the peanut butter in a pan with the butter for the base...made mixing it all together much easier. Will definitely be making these again!!"
"0","5","Very Good! Easy to follow recipe. Yum, Yum."
"0","5","I followed this exactly and it was very easy and just delicious! Will make again."
"0","5","Amazing & easy ... enough said!"
"0","5","These were very rich, but oh so good! I forgot these in the refrigerator for most of our family Christmas this weekend, but they still disappeared after I pulled them out later in the night. Really good, a hit with both adults AND kids!"
"0","4","Very good but very rich! Will definintly make again...Thanks!"
"0","5","Very rich so cut them small. I used organic PB and kept them refrigerated. It worked out well and they were consumed quickly at a staff luncheon. Good amount of icing too. Very easy!"
"0","5","these were very easy and everyone loved them. they were the first to go among several other good choices."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, these were soooo GOOD! I did change a few things with them. I will def make them again!!!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I took the advice from other reviewers and used milk chocolate chips and cooled the peanut butter mixture while melting the chocolate."
"0","5","after reading others reviews i only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter..very easy to make and delish :) everyone loved them... will def make again... tyty"
"0","5","I love pretty much anything peanut butter and chocolate. This recipe filled that craving perfectly. I enjoy the tiny bit of texture you get from the graham crumbs. I decreased the butter by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup more peanut butter. I also made this recipe in a 8x8 pan. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tbsp. of peanut butter for the topping as well. I thought the chocolate would be to thick if I used the full amount."
"0","4","I made a few adjustments to this recipe. First off I used Adams Natural peanut butter, yum. I only used one cup of butter and because I don't like things too sweet, I only used one cup of confectioners sugar. I also substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips with Ghirardelli 60% cacao chips. The bars came out delicious! So if you like things more savory than sweet, these adjustments work perfectly."
"0","5","Awesome!! I followed someone else advise and melted butter & peanut. Then added Conf. sugar and graham cracker crumbs (make sure the crumbs are fine - I chopped mine up in a food processor)."
"0","5","Simple and delish!"
"0","5","I love this recipe so much I swear I could eat the whole batch. It's so simple and involves very little effort."
"0","4","Can you say reeses peanut butter cup? You can't get any closer to the real thing than this. Enjoyed by all."
"0","5","Almost like what I remember in school. They are very rich. I will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","These are amazing!! They never ever last long in my house."
"0","5","Yummy!"
"0","5","i was a little nervous at first becasue i didnt have real fine cracker crumb (crushed them myself). But what wonderful bars!!!  needed a bit more than an hour to cool down in fridge, the next day they were perfect :) thanks!"
"0","5","These ARE just like Reese's cups! Wow! These are excellent, but the recipe makes a lot. If you are a dieter, you may want to half the recipe or plan to give a few away. Considering how good these taste, they cannot possibly be good for you! I'll eat them anyway!"
"0","5","My daughter just asked me to make these again and I forgot that I had a while back and had not rated them. These were really good. They didn't last the day in my house...guess I better get to making them:)"
"0","5","I love these bars and have had them a lot, but this is the first time I ever made them. This recipe was perfect! I actually only used 3/4c. butter and 1 1/2c. confectioners sugar and it was perfect for us. The PB mixture had a bit of a crisp to it also, which we loved! Almost like the texture of rice krispies. I did find the PB mixture a bit challenging to spread, so I spread it as well as I could and placed the pan in the freezer for ten minutes and it was a lot easier to finish spreading it out. For thicker bars use a dish a bit smaller than 9x13. Great recipe!!"
"0","5","This was absolutely FABULOUS! Everyone loved them. The only change I made was to use milk chocolate instead of semi sweet! I also would suggest more refridgerator time..mine took several hours to firm up..but firmed up nicely!"
"0","5","These were so yummy and super easy! My daughter is alergic to eggs so it's a great treat to make for our family."
"0","4","Very simple and easy to make. Turned out perfect. I will be making these again throughout the holiday season!!"
"0","3","these were okay, sorta stuck to the pan/crumbled when trying to cut them...also the grahams in them made them sorta gritty? overall i can see why people like them, it will curb your pb/choco craving =)"
"0","5","These are the absolute best peanut butter bars! Everyone loved them. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews: I melted the butter and peanut butter together at first, much easier to mix, I also put the crust in the fridge while I made the top so it would stiffen. These are definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Loved, Loved, Loved these simple great bars! They tast just like candy and are so quick! Will definitely use again and again!"
"0","5","They really do taste just like peanut butter cups. My husband loved them. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","Woweeee! After two trips to the grocery store (don't ask me why we didn't have powdered sugar!), I was amazed at how great these tasted. I accidentally greased the pan, but it was still yumazing! I was worried because when I poured the peanut butter mixture into the pan it looked goopy, liquidy, and didn't look like it would EVER solidify-but it did-beautifully! Thanks!"
"0","5","Fast and easy. per the other reviews, I added 1tsp. of vanilla to the PB mixture and used only 3/4C. of butter. They were perfect!"
"0","5","Delicious! I used to have these at school lunch almost 40 years ago. Still remembered how good they were!"
"0","5","These are ridiculous. They are soooooooooooooooo good and dangerous! WAY BETTER than a Reese! WAY! A staple in my cookbook!"
"0","4","These are my fav! Since I love pnut butter I added more pnut butter to the base and put it in the fridge before adding chocolate topping. Also reduced pnutbutter in choc topping to 1 Tbs."
"0","5","Awesome! So easy & tastes just like peanut butter cups."
"0","5","I made these last night and they turned out yummy AND they were so easy. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","These are very rich! Cut into bite size pieces."
"0","4","Followed recipe except I put one less tablespoon of PB into the chocolate mixture. I used Ghiradelli Semi Sweet chips (which are my fav) and it was delicious. I thought the taste was really similar to Reese's, but my only complaint is that the PB Base was not creamy enough for my liking. It stuck together well (even at room temperature) but it had a slightly grainy texture. I even made sure to put the graham crackers in my food processor so the crumbs were really fine. I think next time I will try what someone else recommended--add at least a half cup more peanut butter into the 'base' mixture. That should help the creaminess a bit. I hope!"
"0","5","Really liked these bars. It was just the right amout of peanut butter and chocolate. MIne turned out a little crumbly. I tried to decrease the amount of butter not a good idea. They still tasted great."
"0","5","wow, these taste like reese's peanut butter cups. yum."
"0","5","Very good! Very easy! I did use a whole bag of chocolate chips for the topping."
"0","5","Good Stuff! If you like chocolate, I would increase the chocolate chips to 2 cups because the top layer was a little on the thin side. Very tasty!"
"0","5","I made these for school just for a nice treat at lunch and everyone was raving about them. They were absolutely magnificent! I will definitely be making these again."
"0","5","delicious - pan was gone in minutes!"
"0","5","These are great. Taste similar to peanut butter cups. Very rich and decadent so you can only eat little pieces. I processed whole graham crackers into crumbs. Best if processed very finely. I also used a whole bag of semi swet chips, and it only deposits a thin layer of chocolate, which is fine with me."
"0","5","Very good!! My kids just loved them. This would be great recipe for any kind of party, so quick and easy to make."
"0","4","Good, but very rich. I must say they do become addictive tho!"
"0","5","Delish!! Almost ate the whole pan by myself! Make sure the graham crumbs are very fine!"
"0","5","FABULOUS! I made these for a family gathering and they were gone in a few moments. Very easy to make - so easy, they would be fun to make with children."
"0","5","LOVED these! I made these for a party and everyone loved them. I will definitely make them again just as written.   Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","I used to eat something like this at school when I was younger. This was absolutely easy and great. This has become a must have for dessert in my house."
"0","4","Cut into small squares unless you want to go into suga shock! Mine did not firm up as much as the picture shows"
"0","4","so good but just a little too sweet. my sister ate 3 bars rights in a row. I am sure she would give them a 5!"
"0","5","These. Are. Amazing."
"0","4","Brother and fiance loved them. They do taste very similar to Reeses. I took the rec. of a previous reviewer and let the peanut butter mixture refrigerate for about 15 minutes before adding the chocolate layer."
"0","5","FANTASTIC! Everyone love these."
"0","5","So easy and so good! I took the advice from other reviews and used 1.5 cups of pb in the base and cooled the base before putting the chocolate on top. I used all natural peanut butter when I made these. The do taste very similar to a certain name brand peanut butter cup. I love the no-bake factor of these. Will be making them again."
"0","5","tastes like reeses pb cups!!"
"0","5","This was a big hit! I liked it better the day after I made it, so I would recommend making it a day ahead of time if possible."
"0","5","These taste just like Reeses' cups, but better! I chilled the peanut butter mixture in the freezer for a few minutes before pouring the chocolate on top, it helps keep the two layers separate."
"0","5","This was a huge hit at work! I've made the recipe twice but changed a couple things because I found them a bit too sweet. First I used crunchy peanut butter, I cut the sugar to about 1-1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar and added 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the bottom layer and chilled them over night. We all loved them!"
"0","5","These are sooo good. I just had to send it to my bestfriend in Texas. We both have families that love Peanut Butter cups. It's a big hit."
"0","5","LOVE these. I use one stick butter and only one cup of powdered sugar. I use one and a half cups Smuckers natural peanut butter and they are delicious. I also add a 1 tsp of butter to the chocolate mixture instead of more PB- it turns out fantastic, all chocolaty and prefect.  I have made this a million times and get rave reviews every time."
"0","5","I made these for a company picnic and they were a hit! The next day at work everyone came over to me to get the recipe. Others claimed they've tried similar recipes, but none came out as good as these!"
"0","5","I have been looking for a recipe like this for YEARS! Just like the kind I would buy everyday in junior high school MANY years ago! My girls loved these! Definately a staple in our household!"
"0","2","It never set. Unlike the photo, I could not cut the bars, because it was a gooey mess. I don't think I did anything wrong. If I'd try making these again (which I doubt), I'd reduce the amount of peanut butter."
"0","5","I had to make these with milk chocolate chips(all I had)- Awesome! Next time I will make with less butter like another reviewer cuz I don't think it needs the enire one cup-then I can call them low fat Ha Ha!"
"0","5","This is wonderful!!!!"
"0","4","Very good. Both the kids and my co-workers loved it!"
"0","5","I used reduced fat peanut butter and these still turned out wonderful!"
"0","5","great. made a batch of these when we had family over and they were gone in 60 seconds! also this is so fast & easy to make."
"0","5","The best way I heard these described was by my husband's friend: 'These aren't just chocolate and peanut butter, they are deliciousness.'"
"0","4","These were pretty good. I think I added too much graham cracker out of fear (from other reviews) that the peanut butter mixture wouldn't set. This made a bunch so I took them to work...my co-workers loved them!"
"0","4","Made these for an army family day potluck and they were a hit but unfortunately it was warm outside so the chocolate top didnt stand up to tyhe heat. Brought the rest home to stick in the fridge and they were ok again."
"0","5","Awesome! Do NOT substitute granulated sugar for the confectioner's sugar as your bars will be grainy and not good at all!"
"0","5","Very quick and they taste wonderful!"
"0","5","Taste like Reese's cups to us. My son even requested this for his birthday. We LOVE it! I use crunchy peanut butter for the crust and creamy with the chocolate chips."
"0","5","Wow. These should be classified as a controlled substance they are so good and so addictive. I only changed the recipe slightly by adding some milk chocolate in with the semi sweet and I also used natural organic peanut butter with no ill effects. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","4","pretty darn good. rich though, keep milk on hand."
"0","5","These were a huge hit! I didn't change a thing, and everyone loved 'em. Thanks!"
"0","5","Absolutely awesome! I cut the butter in half, I cut the sugar a little, just to cut calories some. I melted the butter and pb together, and mixed the sugar with the crumbs, then mixed the melted butter and pb in. I froze the pb mixture for 10 minutes before frosting."
"0","4","These tasted just like a peanut butter cup and were a hit at the picnic I took them to. I followed the advice of another reviewer and melted the peanut butter with the margarine. It made it so much easier!"
"0","5","this tastes exactly like peanut butter cups! i also melted the butter and peanut butter together and used a 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips. chill the peanut butter filling first, then spread the chocolate...much easier to spread. i will make this frequently."
"0","5","Delicious! I doubled the recipe, but was out of chocolate chips. I used 3 squares unsweetened chocolate plus 4 tbsp sweetened condensed milk with the chocolate mixture. I also chilled the bottom crust before putting on the chocolate topping."
"0","5","I thought these bars tasted great except there was a bit too much chocolate for me but that is my personal taste. Next time I will cut back on the chocolate."
"0","5","Absolute heaven! I used 1.5 sticks of butter instead of 2 even.  Very quick and easy to make too."
"0","4","Pretty good, very rich - a small square is satisfying. Definitely easy to make."
"0","5","These were quick and easy to make, and definitely satisfy the sweet tooth. I did everything in the microwave. Melted the butter first, which softened the peanut butter well enough to make it easy to mix. Then used the same bowl to make the topping in the microwave. Taste pretty darn close to a Reeses for me - I did use 1 cup semi-sweet and 1/2 c. milk chocolate chips. I'm wondering for the people who mention the 'butter' taste, if they are using real butter or margarine? I used real butter. They are crumbly and I will store them in the fridge, but I don't mind that. Next time I will try putting the graham crackers in the food processor to get the crumbs super fine. I had a couple extra Tbsp. of crumbs so just tossed them in rather than wasting them."
"0","5","Delicious. Used some of the other reviewers' suggestion. A little messy but very delicious. Better than a Reese's. Will make again!"
"0","5","I melted the butter on the stove and just added the peanut butter in. After everything melted I added the other ingredients in. Firming the peanut butter in the fridge before adding the chocolate top is a must."
"0","5","Oh my gosh!! These are so very good! I followed the recipe and used Organic P.B. which I think might be the key to fantastic bars!! Thank you for sharing!  In God we Trust!"
"0","5","Perfect recipe for us! My daughter cannot have milk so she has never had a peanut butter cup, this recipe tasted almost exactly like it. I used half the amount of margarine, and not as much semi sweet choc. for topping."
"0","3","Not sure what happened here... but the peanut butter base was not firm. I poured it in to the pan thinking 'this needs to be thicker I know it does' but thought maybe after it was in the fridge it would firm up. I should have gone with my insticts and added much more powdered sugar!!! AWESOME flavor, but needed tweaking"
"0","5","My family LOVED this! We are peanut butter Fanatics, and this hit the spot! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","4","I made these bars last weekend and they didn't last very long. I followed the directions exactly, except I used milk chocolate chips. I also froze the PB mixture for about 15 minutes before I put the chocolate mixture on, and then I froze it for another 15 minutes. I also put a layer of waxed paper in the pan first. When they had froze slightly, I simply pulled the waxed paper out, and I cut the bars neatly on the counter. Will make again this weekend for family campout!"
"0","5","Boy, these just don't last long at our house. I've quit buying the peanut butter cups and just make these when we have a craving for them."
"0","4","This recipe is great, we dont have gram crackers in england so I used digestive biscuits, turned out lovely.  was very impressed :)"
"0","5","If you are on a diet...DO NOT make these! I had to freeze these before I ate half the pan. Way too easy to make."
"0","5","My husband loved these! They were OK to me but I didn't expect to like them because peanut butter cups aren't at the top of my favorite treats. If you have a peanut butter and chocolate lover in your family they will love you for making these. I had to store mine in the fridge though or they would be too messy."
"0","5","Wow - what can I say? It's fantastic! Easy to make and very easy to eat!!"
"0","5","Never tried it but...If I wanted WHITE Squares for a Black & White party...I would coat them with white chocolate or almond bark instead of milk chocolate or semi-sweet morsels.   This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious."
"0","5","I am definitely going to have to pass these out to the neighbors or else I will eat them all!! They are so quick to make with ingredients that I always have on hand. This is now my official go-to desert when I need something last minute. I did add everything in the sauce pan and melted it all together. Then I let it cool in the fridge while I made the topping. The graham crackers are definitely better than the rice crispies found in some bars--I may even add another 1/2 cup next time. Oh, and the little bit of peanut butter in the chocolate topping tones down the semi-sweet chips... Good stuff!"
"0","5","I have been making these for years but add a layer of toasted coconut...everyone I make these for gets addicted and begs for more!"
"0","5","These were exceptional. I always took the advice of the previous reviewers and upped the PB to 1 1/2 cups and melted it with the butter. I also increased the grahm cracker to 1 1/2 cups and I decreased the chocolate chips to 1 cup. No major changes and everyone enjoyed the results!"
"0","5","I love this recipe and I have made it several times already. I made some changes to the recipe; I use 1/2 cup of butter instead, and 1 cup of confectioner's sugar instead. I also added a layer of homemade whipped cream on top of the chocolate layer and chilled all together to make a three layer cake instead of bars. Just whip a half pint of whipping cream until it is very thick and creamy, mix some confectioner's sugar into it (a few tablespoons depending on how sweet you want it), and then layer over the chocolate layer. Make sure the chocolate layer is at least semisolid so it doesn't mix. Chill all of it for about an hour. The homemade whipped cream chilled makes it so wonderful."
"0","4","I made these for my boyfriend's birthday, and they are incredibly tasty! But, I had a really hard time getting them out of the baking dish without them breaking."
"0","3","I have had much better peanut butter bars. I really didn't care too much for these ones. They needed more of a peanut butter taste. They were really lacking flavor."
"0","4","I tweeked the recipe just a tad, which I shouldn't do the first time around. It's hard to give it a correct review if you don't 'go by the book' so to speak. I used extra chunky peanut butter and added an add'l 2 tbl to the graham crackers. I doubled the recipe for the chocolate topping. It really tastes like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Next time I'm going to try creamy peanut butter, roll up the graham/peanut butter mixture into balls, dip them into the chocolate. Great recipe! Thank you."
"0","5","Even though the bottom of these never got completely firm for me, these were still outstanding ~ completely addictive and delicious."
"0","5","These were soooo good! I couldn't stop eating them. Will definitely make again."
"0","3","Made the recipe as stated...My husband and I are peanut butter lovers but this bar just didn't do it for us! If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would since many other people at the picnic LOVED it - the teenagers especially. I passed on the recipe, but I will not make it again. Thanks for sharing though!"
"0","4","Very gooood,We loved it,but I felt like mine came out kinda soft(Maybe to much butter?)Still very good!"
"0","3","Way too much sugar and butter. Too rich. Can anyone tell me if I can make some subtitutions or just cut back on the butter and sugar? Thanks!"
"0","3","My husband said they had to much chocolate. I thought they were to sweet. My 10 year old daughter was the only one who really liked these."
"0","4","I made these in a little smaller dish so they were thicker. My husband wants me to add a little crispy rice cereal to the next batch to add a little crunch."
"0","5","This recipe was AWESOME and VERY EASY! The only difference I did was use milk chocolate chips instead of Semi-Sweet. I will be making this again!!"
"0","5","YUM! I did have to add some extra peanut butter to make it taste just right, but other than that, this was fantastic! It is very rich and filling though, so don't make my mistake and serve it immediately after uber-rich chicken marsala - you won't be able to finish a square! :)"
"0","5","These are so good! I cut the recipe in half besdies that I followed all of the ingredients. After assembling it I put the pan in the freezer for 15-20 mins and cut into it. A++++++ Will make again soon. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","These were great! Very easy and a big hit with my 6-year old. I plan to keep this one on hand."
"0","5","these are fantastic. When i was in middle school a girlfriend of mine used to make these all the time but would never share the recipe. When i seen the pic i thought wow that looks just like them an man are they ever good. Think i will use resses peanut butter next time. yummy!!! thanks for the child hood memories an great recipe."
"0","5","GREAT! My kids (11 & 5) made these and had so much fun. EASY! I didn't have enough peanut butter for the 4 T in the frosting but we didn't notice. I want to try them with chunky peanut butter and extra chocolate on top next time. What an awesome treat for Christmas friend giving gifts."
"0","5","WOW!! These are fantastic! I made them as the recipe said, except followed the advice to melt the pb with the butter. I also put them in a smaller pan to make them thicker. Perfect! Love that you don't need to heat up the oven-perfect for Summer treats!! This is a new favorite-I can't wait to bring it someplace!"
"0","5","GR8! so yummy, very easy"
"0","3","I thought the graham flavor was overwhelming, but everyone at work loved them."
"0","4","Very good--they do taste like pnb cups! Make sure you serve them immediatly out of the fridge as they soften really quickly. (TIP: NOT good for cookouts!!!) Otherwise a really yummy treat--kids love 'em!"
"0","3","These were good but way to sweet and I love sweet things. Just to much for me. Prob. won't make again."
"0","4","Really good, might be nice with a little more crunch on the bottom."
"0","5","OMG, so good. i only had crunchy peanut butter on hand so i used that and it came out unbelievable."
"0","5","simply delicious!!! i made them for my baby's first birthday."
"0","4","Great Recipe. Difficult to remove from pan. I will have to make with only 1/2 c butter and 1c sugar. Overall, will make again. My super picky son who loves Reece's loved these! Thanks"
"0","5","OMG these were fantastic! I made them for a party and they were a big hit. I brought some home with me and could not leave them alone until they were gone. I can't wait to make them again. Super easy to make and taste just like my favorite Reeses Peanut Butter cups."
"0","5","My family and friends loved these. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so easy. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Definitely hit the spot. I used only 1 stick of butter and lessened the powdered sugar by about 1/2 c. It worked well for me. I also lined my pan with was paper and chilled the peanut butter mixture a few minutes before sticking the chocolate on top. I used milk chocolate chips and only 1 cup of them--which was plenty! After I melted the chips, I poured it over the PB mixture and spread with a knife--fast and easy. Love this recipe! I think it would also be great using rice krispies instead of graham crackers. Yum..."
"0","5","Yum! Yum! I made these with natural peanut butter and only 1 1/2 sticks butter. They held up really well and were not crumbly. I only added a heaping teaspoon of p.b. to the chocolate. Also I cooled p.b. mixture while I melted the chocolate. I didn't have any problems with chocolate seeping into p.b. mixture."
"0","5","Very good, very easy, but a little messy to prepare. I think the pb part is a bit sweet so I might cut down on the sugar by a little bit, also might cut down on the butter, but only for the sake of the waistline!"
"0","4","OKey, so I made these the other day, and I was kinda dissapointed. For one... Way to much butter,maybe you need half that. I used 1 cup, and my 'crust' was more like 'mush'. Maybe not so much sugar, too. 1 1/2 cups insead. So even after they were chilled, they were a bit hard to get out of the bowl in one piece. However, the flavor was so good, just like a PB cup. If you alter the recipe a bit, and your a die hard PB and choc, fan like me... You'll love it. I will try this one again."
"0","5","Kirstie and carols fav"
"0","5","With my being more of a cook than a baker I was quite impressed with my results here! I took the advice of previous reviewers and lined with some parchment paper... excellent advice! My bars came out quick and were easy to cut after spending about 15-20 minutes in the fridge. They taste great and already are almost gone. Thanks for such a great... and definetly reuseable recipe!"
"0","5","oh my gosh...yum yum yum!!!! perfect recipe as is. was going to give them as a gift and ended up keeping them all!!"
"0","4","Very quick, very easy, very sweet. It's a keeper."
"0","5","This is excellent! Me and my fiance ate a whole pan of it in a few days :)   The only inconvenience was that it needed to be refridgerated all the time as it was kinda melty. But it was good cold any way.  Also, next time I will not add peanut butter to the chocolate topping because we both agreed it made the whole thing TOO 'peanut buttery' ;)"
"0","5","Great, easy to make with items on hand!"
"0","3","They are good, but I think I'd rather just have the peanut butter cups and spend my time making something different."
"0","5","Just like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup!"
"0","5","These were a big hit with the family. Will be making these again. I lined the pan with parchment paper to make it easier to remove and it worked great. I then cut them up into serving sizes and put them in baggies in the fridge."
"0","3","Turned out grainy . Probably wont make again because of that"
"0","5","This is really rich! For some reason, it didn't set up like a bar...it's more of a spoon dessert. Really good stuff!"
"0","5","OMGSH THESE ARE THE BEST! PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE ARE MY FAVORITE FOODS, ESPECIALLY TOGETHER AND I JUST LOVED THESE! I WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN! THANK YOU =]"
"0","5","These were a hit! I brought them to a gathering and they were begging me to give them the recipe! The peanut butter part was a little grainy, because of the graham cracker crumbs. This recipe was SO EASY, too! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","This recipe was great and very simple to make! Being a chocolate lover I did add mini chocolate chips to the graham cracker/peanut butter layer."
"0","5","Yum! So easy and they really do taste like peanut butter cups!"
"0","5","Mmmmm this was so amazing! Loved every bite"
"0","5","super fast and easy and delicious. they taste just like reese's peanut butter cups, better really. i cut them little tiny to serve with an easter buffer. everyone loved them."
"0","5","YUM! To me (and my co-workers agree), these taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups. Quick and easy to make. This one's a keeper!"
"0","4","Not what I was looking for but they were tasty. I thought they were better the second day. I made them for Easter and my frisends and family seem to like them."
"0","5","fabulous ...everyone who had one raved about how good they were"
"0","5","I loved these!! The graham crackers in them gave them a really good flavor. I made this recipe exactly as it was stated, the only thing I did differently is I used SunButter instead of peanut butter and it was yummy!! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","REALLY GOOD! I took these to my in-laws and they loved them. Plus, they are so easy!"
"0","5","Woo-Hoo! Not only was this super quick and easy to make, but these were oh-so-tasty, too! I made a half-batch, cut them into small squares (thinking they would last longer-ha!) and the entire pan was gone in a day and a half. The only downside to this yummy recipe is that I ate about 1/2 the pan myself! I also melted the peanut butter with the choc chips and used boxed graham crumbs, so this was not gritty at all--tasted just like my favorite candy. Thanks :-)"
"0","3","I was really disappointed in this recipe. It didn't in any way, taste like a peanut butter cup. The chocolate was SO over powering (usually not a bad thing). The peanut butter was 'deadened' by the addition of the graham cracker crumbs. I did like the texture, but that was about it. I won't be making these again."
"0","5","These were great! I didn't realize I had very little chocolate chips on hand so I melted a couple of leftover Hershey Crisp bars from the treat jar. It came out great and the crispies were a nice addition. People commented it tasted like peanut butter cups to them without me saying anything - I had a hard time getting them out of the pan with the chocolate still attached to the peanut butter, but I think that was because of the way I melted it."
"0","4","I agree that these are very easy to make - and a real treat. While they do have the flavour of a popular peanut butter cup, you can detect the grittiness of the graham wafer crumbs. So, that's the reason for the 4 stars."
"0","5","These were delicious!!! They taste exactly like Reese's cups. These will be my party staples from now on!"
"0","4","These are pretty good. This recipe is easily halved. The peanut layer flattens out nicely if you shimmy your pan and I think next time I'll chill that layer a little bit before adding the chocolate and I may try milk chocolate chips."
"0","4","quick, easy and everyone really liked them...will keep on file!"
"0","5","Easy and yummy!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe and SO easy. I made the dish and was worried it would not be good because it was so easy, but it was a HIT. I brought it to work for a pot luck and have gotten many compliments. This recipe is one I will make again and again!"
"0","4","I started to make this for a church event- when I realized I didn't have enough graham cracker crumbs. lol I need to get into the habit of measuring my ingredients BEFORE I start cooking.   So I had to cut the recipe in half. I then let it set in a small spring foam pan which was the best thing I could have done. The peanut butter bar looked like a peanut butter cup & it was very easy to then cut the bar into pieces and distribute. I found the bars to be very rich- so I cut them into tiny pieces (made about 25). It was just the perfect amount of sweetness, anymore I think would have been too much to eat! I got rave reviews and had one person beg me for the recipe.   Overall, a crowd pleaser!"
"0","5","These were abolutely sinfully delicious! And soooo easy to make! Worked well to chill base a bit before spreading chocolate on top."
"0","4","A little sweeter than peanut-butter cups, but VERY good! (I served these at a party and a group of teenagers INHALED them!)"
"0","4","These were really good, but I think some people would find them too rich. The peanut butter portion had a fudge-like consistency, and I had expected a drier crust. I followed another reviewer's advice and cut the bars into squares after they had been in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, which worked out great."
"0","4","These were sooooooo good!!! Super easy and super yummy!"
"0","5","When I found this recipe, I knew it was perfect for my daughter to help me with. We love how easy they were to make and love how good they taste! My brother, who isn't a pb fan, liked these as well, saying 'They taste like pb cups!'"
"0","5","My husband is a peanut butter fan and let me tell you...he was in heaven when he had his first bar! These had great texture, a bit stiffer then a peanut butter cup, but I prefer it that way. They did crumble a bit, but it got better as they were refrigerated longer...we were too impatient and wanted to try almost immediatley!! sooooo good! Will defintely make again."
"0","5","At the last minute, I realized I was out of graham crackers, but I had some Honey Butter Ritz crackers, so I thought what the heck. Turned out great, DH ate 1/4 of the pan by himself last night. Can't wait to try them with the graham crackers."
"0","4","Pretty good! Very quick and easy recipe! At first I thought it was a little odd to mix the graham crackers in with the peanut butter. It ended up being very good and I liked the crunch of the graham crackers mixed in with the peanut butter."
"0","5","These are soooo good. Wouldn't change a thing."
"0","4","This was a great recipe but I wish the pb part was little creamier...."
"0","5","I made these when we had company in, and they were a hit, they did not last more than one day! The only thing is that they can get a bit crumbly."
"0","5","Oh man....what more can I say? I'm a poor college student who can only use a microwave in the dorms. When I saw this was no-bake, I jumped at the chance! (plus I had a MEAN craving for sweets) This hit the spot! Thank you SO much!"
"0","5","The recipe submitter is not kidding! These do taste like peanut butter cups! I made these in a 8x8 pan, but that might have been a mistake, as they are very rich! But I do love them. Next time I'll follow the recipe, just halve it to make less."
"0","5","Excellent!!!!!!!!!! These are better than reese cups. My kids love them. Thank you for this recipe."
"0","5","Chocolate peanut butter heaven! Love the texture. The do get a little soft but we prefer them right out of the freezer anyway."
"0","4","Not as good as Special K bars, but very good. Taste like a candy bar, but I think I prefer the special k cereal bars  ' chewy-ness ' better. :)"
"0","5","This was so easy and yummy! I made them to take to an event and BF keeps sneaking in and snagging pieces of it. Do use milk chocolate chips if you like it rich."
"0","5","these were delicious, I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","Unbelievable! People raved about these when I made them. I must have given the recipe out to 5 people afterward because people were begging for it! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. thank you for this one!"
"0","5","These are so yummy. I made these this morning 30 mins before walking out the door to come to work...I put them in the fridge for 1 hr when I got to work and just got them out. They are great. Super easy and eveyone here at work loves them. Thanks for a great & super recipe."
"0","5","These were a hit. Def. a make again. It is a cross between a reeces peeces flavor and butterfinger flavor."
"0","5","These rock! Everytime I make them, someone wants the recipe."
"0","5","I can't believe how simple this was. It was gone in 2 days in my house. My boyfriend who isn't a big sweets eater ate most of it. :) This is a definite keeper! YUMMY!!!!"
"0","5","instead of graham crackers i used raisen bran and put more raisens into it. i also used crunchy peanut butter. my boyfriend loved it! its like a homemade snickers/peanut butter cup!"
"0","5","Couldn't be easier and super good!"
"0","5","So easy, and so delicious!"
"0","5","Very yummy! Easy to cut and easy to make."
"0","5","I thought these bars were scrumptious...very rich but a hit at a neighborhood party. The graham cracker crumbs leave a bit of a grainy texture but they are really good!"
"0","5","If you're looking for something quick and easy to satisfy that sweet tooth, this is the recipe for you! They do remind me of peanut butter cups. I threw these together for a school luncheon, and they got great reiews! Be sure to allow plenty of time for them to set up. I was afraid that mine would be too runny, but they were firm enough after refrigerating overnight. My husband and kids loved these bars, so I'm planning on adding them to my list of Christmas goodies!"
"0","5","AMAZING!!!! they were easy to make and really good"
"0","3","The graham cracker crumbs areessential, but I really think this calls for WAY too much butter. The bar was okay, just too HEAVY of a snack for me. Super sweet and dense.."
"0","4","I thought these were pretty good. I was expecting more raving about them than I received though."
"0","5","These are INCREDIBLE!!!! I used Smart Balance in place of the butter. Absolutely perfect recipe!"
"0","5","WOW!! What an easy but amazing tasting dessert..I can't believe how GOOD this tastes. I used 1/2 cup butter and thought it was perfect. I also melted the peanut butter with the butter to make everything easier to mix. Now that I've tried this recipe, I will be making all the time."
"0","5","This dessert is perfect for anyone who loves peanut butter and chocolate. I never have leftovers when I take these to a party! Careful, they are addictive."
"0","4","I made these bars for my crew and they all really seemed to enjoy them. They went fast and got big compliments. The only thing i didn't like about them was they were a little too rich and not all that healthy but on the up-side they were easy to make, perhaps using more peanut butter and less sugar will help do the trick. (they really did taste like peanut butter cups)"
"0","5","Unreal! These are absolutely amazing! I usually only make half a batch when I try a new recipe in case it's a real doozy, but I'm so glad I didn't! These will be gone in no time. I used milk chocolate chips since I'm not a fan of semi-sweet. It's wasn't too sweet, just perfect, and just like Reeses. YUM!"
"0","5","I made these bars to take to a meeting. I told my roommate that she could have the leftovers when I came home, but there weren't any! She was very disappointed so I made her another pan :) If you make these bars, expect them to disappear quickly."
"0","4","Good, fast, kids loved it. It is really sweet, but made a great dessert for a picnic in the park. I used the food processer on the graham crackers, and though the texture is a bit 'grainy'...there isn't really any way around that...graham crackers are grainy. It's good...try it!"
"0","5","Great! These are a danger to any peanut butter loving choco-holic!! I did not have enough graham crackers to make 2 cups.. I used a little of everything to make up the difference.. pretzels, crackers and a couple different kinds of cereal! Turned out wonderful!"
"0","5","Yum! These were great! Very easy to make. My friends cleaned the plate!"
"0","5","Tasty! They do need to set up in the refrigerator before cutting, but they were hard to cut after I let them chill for about 5 hours. The chocolate fell off the peanut butter...it was a mess. I was able to cut them in perfect squares after they softened a bit. They also taste better when soft, so I'd recommend only refrigerating if needed after they're cut. I didn't find them grainy at all, but I did use a food processor for the graham crackers. And I didn't substitute milk chocolate chips, I don't think it's necessary. Great recipe!"
"0","4","These were good but a little too sweet for me. If I make them again I might try substituting half the sugar for powdered milk - also may help with the grainy texture - if you don't like that (I actually did.) Tasty but extremely unhealthy. Had to give 4 stars"
"0","5","ohhhh....these are so good."
"0","4","I thought these were very good, but, like other reviewers, I found them to be a tad grainy. I'm not sure there is a way around that; I mixed all the ingredients together very well. I also used chunky peanut butter, which gave the bars a nice crunch. I used more chocolate than the recipe called for, but I actually think that was too much chocolate for the topping; I won't use as much next time. This was quite easy and good for hot summer days when turning on the over seems like too much effort. The bars are very rich, so a small piece goes a long way."
"0","5","These bars are wonderful! I took 2 pans of them to a bake sale and they were my best selling baked item. I got many requests for the recipe and were told they tasted just like the candy bar many times. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","These are the BEST!"
"0","5","Great! Didn't change a thing."
"0","5","SOOOOO good and so easy. Made these to take to work and everyone loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!!!"
"0","5","Delicious, just like I remember as a kid. Fast and easy for a quick dessert."
"0","5","Just once word to described these bars -- DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","These are very good. I followed the recipe except I used chunky peanut butter because I like the crunch. I will make these again but next time I will use 2 cups of peanut butter with the sugar and crackers. I will also use more pb in the topping and use the pb & chocolate chip swirls. I just really like more taste of peanut butter. That 9x13 pan is just perfect for these bars."
"0","5","Fantastic! Melted the butter and peanut butter together as another reviewer suggested. I also added 2 Tbs butter with the chocolate chips and peanut butter for the top layer. Halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, but will double the recipe next time. They didn't last long!"
"0","5","These were so easy and so delicious. Taste like Reese's peanut butter cups..."
"0","5","My family loves it..."
"0","5","5 stars for easiness and 5 stars for tasting fabulous! I brought them to work for potluck and everyone inhaled them! Nobody thought they were too grainy as some people had said and I did the recipe to the letter - don't change a thing!"
"0","5","Simple to make, and absolutely yummy!"
"0","5","super easy and super good!"
"0","4","A little sweet for me and it made a huge batch. If cut in small squares they are pretty good, can't eat more then 2 though."
"0","5","Made this for a Christmas treat. My fiance loves peanut butter foods and enjoyed this the most. Everyone else did too!"
"0","5","These were incredible!! Toad-ally decadent and delicious and will become a new favorite of mine to present at all my gatherings."
"0","5","These are great! They're super easy to make (I did all the mixing in a food processor) and everybody loves them. My officemates just devoured a whole pan in a matter of seconds!"
"0","5","These were so easy to make, I nearly tried it with my eyes closed! Seriously though... I used buttered foil and it came off like a dream. I also used more chocolate chips for the top in order to make it a touch thicker. Delicious!"
"0","5","Yummy!! very easy. I half followed advise of another reviewer, halfway thru melting butter, I added in the peanut butter. I also half chunky and half creamy peanut butter. Will definitely make this again."
"0","5","Simple and good! If you love peanut butter and chocolate you'll love this."
"0","5","Woah, me and my hubby love it so much! No need to change a thing! Thanks!"
"0","5","So simple to make! I loved the texture the graham crackers (finely crushed) gave to the bar. They are definetly a crowd pleaser, just don't tell your guests how much fat and calories are in a single bar."
"0","3","I remember having these as a kid and they tasted much better. They tasted kind of 'gritty' because of the graham cracker crumbs. I will use more peanut butter next time. There wasn't quite enough peanut butter flavor."
"0","5","So addictive. These taste like Reeses peanut butter cups, only better ;)"
"0","3","This was good, but really rich! If I make it again, I will have to adjust my ingredients."
"0","4","These were very good and super easy to make. I loved that I didn't have to start up my oven during the summer heat to make a dessert. Thank you."
"0","5","Awesome recipe!! I was looking for something fast and that I didn't have to heat up my oven for because it's been 115 degrees where I live. These were so easy to put together and everyone loves them. 3 people asked me for the recipe. Delicious!! Thanks so much!!"
"0","5","I don't think I've ever made bars this good, this fast. This is truly an easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have any problems cutting them, or removing the bars from the pan...they were perfect."
"0","5","So yummy!! I was a little worried when I first made them that they would be too soft because the mixture was soft, but after an hour in the fridge, they were a perfect consistancy!   The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips.   I will be making these again for sure!"
"0","4","These were pretty good! However, a few changes would improve them. My sister in-law melts a 'Symphony' bar over the top instead of using semi-sweet choc. chips. She also uses less of the peanut butter filling to make them a little thinner. Still yummy!"
"0","5","Really easy to make and super tasty"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! This recipe is very simple and I had no problems with it. If you don't like peanut butter, then you probably won't like these."
"0","5","These were AWSOME and SO easy to make! Very rich!!"
"0","4","These are as sweet as candy. Of course, the kids love them! A little too sweet for an adult dessert in my opinion though."
"0","5","Fabulous! I made these for a family get-together, and they were a huge hit. My aunt said that she thinks they are better than Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. My husband had me make another pan to take into work tomorrow. This will definitely be a 'go to' recipe."
"0","5","This recipe should be better named 'A Peanut Butter Lover's Heavan' I crushed up a GOOD brand of graham crackers in the food processor, melted everything in the microwave. Instead of a 9x13 pan I used a 9x9 pan to make extra thick bars. A very good recipe, not met anyone who did not like them, have lots of milk on hand. Very rich and tasty."
"0","5","These bars are too easy and too good. They are rich, so cut them smaller than normal bars. By far the best Peanut Butter Cup Bar recipe out there--definately a keeper!"
"0","5","Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, and won't change anything for next time - they were that good!"
"0","4","Yum! They DO taste like Peanut Butter Cups, only as though they were made with crunchy peanut butter. Also softer than the cups are. To melt chips in a 1000 watt microwave, zap them on high temperature for 30 seconds at a time, stirring each stop, until melted. Followed recipe exactly...no complaints except my sister thought they were too rich. Keeps fine in the fridge but you can't leave them at room temperature for long before they get mushy."
"0","3","I wasn't terribly impressed with this, although my son liked them. Luckily, I only halved the recipe because I wouldn't want to eat much of it. I love PB Cups, but these didn't taste much like them in my opinion."
"0","5","Simple and delicious"
"0","4","I melted the chocolate on the stove and it was super easy. No cooking really. FAST treat if you are in the mood for something NOW (which at 9 months pregnant, I AM! But as they sat and tried them later, not so sweet to me. Kind of bland tasting. Dont think I will make them again. GOod fresh, I am mixed. Would maybe bring them to a get together, And would try to add REAL sugar, not powdered sugar. at least 1 cup of each i think that would make a big difference."
"0","5","EXCELLENT!! These are a definite hit in my family! Soooo Easy to make. Very sweet and rich, so I cut them into very small squares."
"0","5","sooo good"
"0","5","I actually prepared this recipe in a large bar pan, took it to a church function, and it was gone in minutes!  It was very simple to make too!"
"0","5","Thse are great. Very easy to make, and everyone loved them. Thank you!"
"0","5","Awesome...Quick and easy to make....Thanks!"
"0","5","This is so easy and very yummy. I have been making this for a while and everywhere I go I'm asked for the recipe."
"0","4","This was a pretty good recipe. I thought it could be a little better, but my husband approved and he's a die-hard peanut butter fan."
"0","4","very good, but a little too rich for my tastes"
"0","5","These are so easy and tasty!!! I wouldn't change a thing. I was a little worried about my peanut butter mixture though. There was no pressing it into the pan, it was more of a spreading consistancy. I just knew I blew it. I popped them in the freezer, and now we're enjoying something that tastes sooo close to a peanut butter cup. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"0","3","This was all right. Nothing great. Certainly not five stars. Probably will not make again."
"0","5","I made these for my elementary school class and got rave reviews. They were very easy to make."
"0","5","Fantastic ! It's easy to make and delicious ! This recipe is really good, thanks a lot !"
"0","5","I made these bars to bring in as a treat to work and everyone loved them. Very yummy!"
"0","5","Loved this recipe! My kids especially enjoyed it since I don't bake too much. This one was even easy for me, a complete novice in the kitchen!"
"0","5","Excellent, easy recipe; a 'must' for any cookie plate, especially at Christmas. Very easy to make and they sure disappear in a hurry. Everyone asks for the recipe. Thanks, Nancy!"
"0","5","Very tasty,sweet and simple to make.All my company inhaled them. I cut them small like nanamiobars."
"0","5","These bars are so easy to make and are a hit everywhere I bring them. They really taste like the real thing!"
"0","5","Made this recipe at least 4 times this summer. I always used milk chocolate chips and one time I even used a mix of milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. My friends and family all loved it both ways. My nieces had a great time helping me make at a cabin we rented over the summer. I premeasured the peanut butter, sugar, and # of graham crackers before I went to make it easier. I always kept mine in the fridge or freezer, but I like my candy bars frozen anyway. Enjoy!"
"0","4","this was real good, but needs more chocolate. everyone thought that they tasted alot like peanut butter cups. I halved the recipe because it was toooo sweet."
"0","5","These were awesome. I made for a party and these were gone before everything else. Everyone asked for the recipe. I added additional graham cracker crumbs and made 1.5 of the chocolate topping. My husband is begging for more."
"0","5","Soooo easy to make and soooo yummy! I didn't change a thing and was very pleased with the results."
"0","5","These are so terrific and so easy to make. Everyone who tastes them loves them. I have had many requests to make these to bring to gatherings. tahnks for sharing this wonderful treat."
