"3048","5","These were fantastic, but NOT moist! First, you do not need to dip the fork in sugar when you press these cookies flat. They are sweet enough! Don't press the cookies flat if you don't like thin & crispy cookies. Leave them in little balls for thicker and more chewy cookies. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter and then divided it into 3 bowls. In one, I added 1/3 cup of raisins, in another, 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and in the last one, I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of shredded coconut. They needed a full 10 minutes to bake and they were all DELICIOUS!!!"
"1774","5","This recipe makes a great cookie! You can tailor it to your liking: take them out a bit early for softer cookies, or bake them a little longer for a crisp cookie. I divided the dough and added raisins to one batch; chocolate chips to the second; and Craisins & white chocolate to the third, which were absolutely delicious! Of course, they were great without adding anything. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves which gave them an even better taste. Also, I didn't grease the pan, chill the dough, or flatten w/fork and they turned out just fine. Try it for yourself!"
"1418","5","Wow! I loved these cookies and they were super easy to make. I used Splenda instead of sugar. WW flour in place pf white flour and added raisins. I also took the advice of another eviewer and left them round instead of flattening them with a fork and the came out round, soft and perfect. I will make these again and again. Thanks for the great recipe."
"678","5","True to their name, these cookies were quite soft, and tasty too! I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate the dough, and rolling it into balls was too time-consuming. I just made your basic drop cookies using a spoon. I also tried flattening some using a fork dipped in sugar, but it really didn't make a difference. In my opinion, you can just skip that step. I will definitely make these again!!"
"367","5","These were great! the first time i made oatmeal cookies and a total success. i chose this recipe cos it said 'soft', which is what i wanted and they really are - lovely and moist, chewy and with v.good oatmeal flavour. changed a few things - added 1 1/2 cups raisins, so cut white sugar to 2/3 cup so they wouldn't be overly sweet. next time might try cutting to 1/2 cup cos i dont think the cookies need the extra sugar. also used margarine instead of butter. unfortunately realised that i didn't have enough cinnamon (only about 1 small teaspoon!) so next time i'll make sure i have the right amount. found this dough really easy to work with. had to knead the raisins in by hand cos it was too thick to stir, but that was ok. after chilling it rolled really easily into balls without being sticky! i baked the cookies on parchment paper, and made 30. baked for 8 minutes - they come out looking way too doughy, but give them 5 minutes and they firm up to perfection! tip - i found that these cookies do not spread and flatten much by themselves, so i'd advise anyone to flatten the balls a lot before putting them in the oven. i'll be making these again and again!! :)"
"337","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've had yet. I can't put my finger on what separates this one from the rest, but the ingredients are the perfect combination for a great tasting cookie. Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle, with a perfect blend of spices. I can't wait to try them with raisins and various flavors of chips (chocolate, butterscotch, and cinnamon). Thanks for a great recipe."
"279","5","The perfect oatmeal cookie. No rocket science here--simple to mix, simple to bake, great results. Bake longer for chewier, shorter time for softer cookies, add nuts or raisins if you like or just as is. Nice oatmeal flavor with just a hint of cinnamon and not overshadowed by a ton of spices. Just that simple."
"231","5","After reading other reviews I subtracted 1/2 cup of sugar, and I was sorry I did. They were still delicious, but next time I will use the full amount of sugar. The cookies even stayed soft for 4 days (that's when everyone finished them). Excellent recipe!!!"
"214","5","Outrageously delicious! I cut the amount of oats to 2 cups to make them more chewy and thin + some chocolate chips for the Mrs. She doesn't usually have a sweet tooth for cookies 'n cakes, but these - I had to fight vigorously to get my share!"
"203","5","This has become a new favorite in our home! One of the only recipes I've ever tried that truly lives up to the soft cookie name. The flavor is just right, the cookie melts in your mouth, and they are easy to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"60","5","These are very good. I made a few personal changes, but the original comes out awesome. I saw a few reviews mentioning that these came out dry. One thing I've learned about oatmeal cookies is that they are done when the edges are golden brown. Yes, you're going to touch the middle with your finger and say to yourself, 'no, they need to go back in the oven'. Wrong. The center will seem to be undercooked, but they are done. If you don't believe me, at least take one out earlier than you think it's ready. Let them cool for a little bit and they'll be chewy and awesome as they should be. I make them with a 3oz scoop and flatten them -- that size takes almost exactly 8 minutes at 375°F. What to do with the cookies you left in past when I said to pull them out? If you like milk or coffee, you can always dunk them!"
"50","5","fantastic! This is the perfect oatmeal cookie base. I have made these twice this week! First time I halved the recipe and added semi-sweet chocolate chips. Last night I halved it and added SunMaid dried fruit bits. I also substituted Smart Balance light spread for butter and it is still the best oatmeal cookies ever. As for making the cookies uniform in shape, I simply pressed these little babies into patties like I would a mini hamburger. They came out perfectly chewy yet cooked throughout.  UPDATE: The third time I made these, I replaced the butter with peanut butter. AMAZING! So good."
"42","5","So Good!! I made a few changes to make it healthier and it turned out well. I used 1 1/2 stick of butter and 2 tbs of unsweetened apple sauce, 1 egg and 2 egg whites, and I used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 c all purpose. They were super good and had to force myself to stop eating them. I have found my new oatmeal cookie recipe!!"
"35","5","Best oatmeal cookie recipe! I made two batches so far - one plain and one with white chocolate and dried cranberries. My oven required more than the 8-10 minutes for baking - 12 minutes was just right. I didn't have quick oats and used Old Fashioned Quaker Oats and it came out fine. At first I followed the advice of one of the reviews to only use 2 cups of Old Fashioned Oats but thought the dough was not oatmeal-ey enough so I ended up using the full three cups. Also, I reduced the cinnamon to only one teaspoon and added a dash of ground clove and nutmeg. The only down side is that we can't stop eating them!"
"27","5","These are excellent oatmeal cookies -- very soft and moist, with the right balance of oats to flour. The only change I made (and will make again) is to take the white sugar down to 1/2 cup. I have a huge sweet tooth, and these were plenty sweet -- even with the reduction in sugar. A definite keeper of a cookie recipe. Thanks!"
"25","5","Just finished making these and WOW, they really are amazing...I wanted to find a recipe that used what I already had at home and so the amount of oats I had on hand was only 2 1/2 cups, but they still turned out great. Also, I read a tip awhile back that said you can sub old fashioned oats for quick cooking anytime, just keep in mind the product will be a little more chewy...so I used old fashioned and they turned out great. I thought I'd pass that tip along to other novice cooks like myself."
"22","5","These cookies are great! Unfortunately I had to stray from the recipe just a bit due to an egg allergy (toddler). I used an egg sub (1 banana mashed with 1 tsp of baking powder for the 2 eggs) and baked them for just under 8 minutes. My little guy LOVED these! The banana didn't overwhelm the oatmeal taste either. Great cookie, thanks so much Barbara!"
"19","5","The title says it all! This is an amazing recipe and the cookies came out moist, soft and chewy. I used a small ice cream scoop to make all the cookies the same size. Be sure to chill the dough before baking. It didn't seem to matter if you flattened the cookies. I tried both ways and all of them came out perfect. I did make one change. I rolled the cookies in sugar before going on to the cookie sheet (I've done that with other oatmeal cookies) and it made them even better!! 5-stars all the way!! I baked all the batches for 8 minutes then pulled them out (they still looked a little doughy) and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 2-3 minutes then let them cool on a wire rack. We can't put them down!!!"
"19","2","Easy, good but not the best recipe for raisin-less oatmeal cookies. I'll try these again sometime and see if I just didn't get it right the first time. It might be the cinnamon, but we usually love cinnamon. Also way too salty. Thanks for the recipe."
"18","5","My first time making cookies and they came out great! I didn't press them down as per other reviewers so I could get a nice fat chewy cookie. YUM!"
"17","5","My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe yet! I only had 'old fashioned' oatmeal, so I ran half of the oatmeal through my food processor. The cookies were fantastic. Soft and chewy."
"16","5","OH,MY!!!!!!! these couldn't be better!, as i sit here eating my 5th cookie, i realize how i fell in love with them at the start! you have GOT to try these cookies!"
"16","4","These were great! I gave 4 stars because I altered. I added 2tsp. Vanilla, and doubled the cinnamon. First batch I made too large and they 'ran' everywhere, so I made smaller walnut sized balls and they came out PERFECT! Also don't bother with the sugar and fork mess...unless you like flat cookies... These are soft & chewy. This is a keeper! Also PERFECT with this *cream filling: 1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 cup marshmallow creme 1 teaspoon vanilla extract *from the Cream-filled chocolate cookies recipe from this site."
"15","5","Very nice. I also put 1/2 cup less of the white sugar and they turned just right. My two-year old enjoyed making and eating them too. I pressed the dough on the rolling board and let my daughter cut it with a biscuit cutter.   I was very surprised, though, when we've got more then 50 cookies, using the recipe scaled for 24... We gave away some to my little one's daycare and some to her aunt and her gradma. Everyone said they were good!"
"13","1","this is the worst recipe i've tried so far."
"13","5","The people at work love me when I bring in these cookies. Two dozen are gone in a matter of hours. They also freeze really well. 40 seconds in the microwave when frozen, & it's like they just came out of the oven."
"12","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've used. I added 1 cup raisins and I love cinnamon so I eyeballed (and probably doubled the requested amount)... it turned out perfectly soft. Take them out on time... they might not look fully done in the middle but once it cools it is PERFECT and SUPER SOFT! SO SO SO delicious.  I am a sugar fiend and per my sister's request only put 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar (reduced sugar by 1/4 cup) and it was perfect... just remember that the raisins will be sweet too if you add them.... if were to have added nuts though, I would want to keep the full amount of sugar because the skin on nuts taste bitter to me.  What a great recipe!"
"11","4","I'm no baking extraordinaire, but seriously, I want to meet the person that can mess up the taste of a cookie recipe that has 1 cup of butter and two cups of sugar. It just doesn't happen. My clogged arteries thank you.   That being said, I only used 1 cup of sugar- brown sugar only- and they turned out good. To replace added some honey and reduced sugar syrup. Tripled the amount of vanilla extract. As usual.  The dough was pretty cement-like for me, but not too bad. I just used a spoon instead of my hands. I didn't do anything like refrigerate it. Coz lets be honest, I want cookies and I want em now."
"10","5","Pretty good recipe, DH loves it but I'm not overly fond of oatmeal cookies as a rule so it's hard for me to say for sure. Most definitely soft and moist, I don't think they're going to last very long. I made 2/3 the recipe plain with no add-ons but added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the remaining 1/3. Pretty good too. Edited to add: On the second day, the cookies were MUCH better. Suddenly I could taste the oatmeal (which I think is what I was missing before) and the texture and everything was much better. Changed to five stars from four."
"8","5","I skipped the chilling of the dough, as well as the flattening the cookies with a sugared fork. I also added a cup of craisins. The cookies came out soft and delicious! A definite keeper."
"8","5","Amazing. Straight up amazing. My batch came out completely chewy (no crispiness at all, just as my husband and kids prefer :), and I followed the ingredient list as written. I didn't chill or flatten with a fork though; instead, I rolled them into balls (I managed about 4.5 dozen), and popped them into the oven as is (no flattening or chilling required). 8 1/2 to 9 minutes later? Perfection. Definitely my 'go-to' oatmeal cookie recipe from now on. :)"
"8","5","Wow, I cut the sugar in half, only using 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown, and they turned out great! I'm sure they would be awesome with full sugar also, just not as good for you :)"
"8","5","These cookies were wonderful. They were heavenly soft right out the oven, and mine only needed 8 minutes. The first batch, I left in for 10 and they came out a bit crunchy. I cut back on 1/4 cup of sugar and added some coconut instead, but I think 1/2 of coconut would be better. Also, when I was mixing the batter, my wooden spoon snapped! Be prepared for a workout if you don't have an electric mixer."
"8","5","Excellent! Stay chewy, taste great, the best I ever made... even better than my secret recipe!"
"8","5","This is a good oatmeal cookie but it's way toooo sweet!! I will absolutly make this recipe again, I will just cut the sugar by at least 1/2 a cup. It's really good with dried cranberries and walnuts, I also used 1 tablespoon of vanilla and cinnamon for added flavor. Thank you for this recipe."
"8","5","I made these cookies for my boss for 'Boss' Day'. He loved them and said they were better than the bakeries. My husband gave them two thumps up. They were soft and baked up perfect."
"7","4","I've made these twice and they really are nice and soft. First time around, I did it almost exactly as the recipe stated and oh my god, it's way too sweet. And they were a bit plain (bland) outside of the massive sweetness. I didn't flatten the cookies with a fork dipped in sugar (thank god, the last thing this recipe needs is more sweetness) but I did press them down with my palm. This recipe doesn't spread all too well so it needs it. I ended up baking them 8.5 minutes.  Second time around, I only used 2/3 cup of both the white sugar and brown sugar. And I added more cinnamon, some cloves, nutmeg, and ground ginger. That's when it really started coming together. I will definitely make this recipe again, with the adjustments."
"7","5","I added a box of chocolate pudding to the mix for a different version. I loved the recipe as reads but almost peed my pants when I tasted the choco. version! Thanks Bittersweet1 for this awesome recipe !!!"
"7","5","I used this recipe to make oatmeal squares. I substituted 1/4 cup vegetable oil plus 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1 cup butter and used only 1/2 cup white sugar. I added a good helping of Craisins and baked in a 9x13 pan for about 30 minutes, then cut into squares. They were super yummy! Next time I might use only 1/4 cup white sugar."
"7","5","Made these the other day, outstanding! Added 1 cup of white chips and 1 cup of craisins. I didn't find any need to refrigerate the dough. I made walnut size balls and left them that way and I baked until lightly browned any more than that made a crunchy cookie."
"7","5","These cookies remind me of the thick oatmeal raisin cookies you get at the grocery store bakery or Costco....yummy. They stay thick and chewy as long as you take them out early. My family loved them gone the first day I made them. I had to make more the next day, my husband couldn't get enough of them. I will definitely make them again."
"7","5","These were the best oatmeal cookies I've EVER had. Delicious."
"7","5","My first attempt at Oatmeal cookies was sucessful. These cookies are easy to make and easier to eat. They're just like my grandmother used to make."
"6","5","LOVE these! Perfect flavor, perfect consistency. Thank YOU!!!"
"6","4","I made these cookies yesterday for the first time, i did not refridgerate them because i didn't see the need for it, i just put a spoonful on the cookie sheet and pressed them down with my palm of my hand, i like mine a bit thicker and i put dried cranberries in them, they weren't over the top, i find no oatmeal cookie recipe that is flowing over with flavor but they were good and i will make them again."
"6","5","I love these soft chewy cookie. I added raisins cause an oatmeal cookie is not complete without them. The recipe states to push the cookie down with a fork, prior to cooking, but I didn't want more sugar so I just left them in a heap on the cookie sheet, and found they fell flat, just fine, without the added step."
"6","5","These cookies are terrific. I have been experimenting with various oatmeal cookie recipes this week (including the one one the oatmeal box) and this is the best. I made batches with raisins, craisins, chocolate chips and plain. All great. I used parchment paper and did not grease. I did not refrigerate the dough, I used 3/4 c of white sugar instead of 1 cup. I flattened the cookies slightly, with damp fingers. Did not use more sugar. They are the best....thanks."
"6","5","My husband said they were the best oatmeal cookies he had ever had. I did add about a cup of raisins. The first batch I let chill about 45 minutes. Decided to see how it would do in the frig for longer so I left it overnight and made another batch the next day. And finally one more fresh batch on the third day. The dough kept nicely and I was able to have a fresh cookie for 3 days! Several days after being baked they have held up really well and are still very moist."
"6","5","Husband and I loved this recipe. I did a half batch and I did add raisins. Did exactly as directed. Great recipe"
"6","5","Very nice. I did add a half cup of raisins, which I soaked in hot chai tea and drained before adding it to the dough. These baked up nicely and were a wonderful cookie to make with my boys. NOTE: I cut this recipe in half which made 24 medium sized cookies."
"6","5","These were so good! We baked them as directed for the first pan full. For the second and third pans, we baked them 12 minutes, and then immediately transferred them to the wire rack without cooling them on the pan. It seemed to go faster that way. They were delicious!"
"6","5","Love this cookie! Like many, I tweaked mine based on the reviews. I coarsely chop 2 out of the 3 cups of oats, add 1 cup each of the white choc. chips, walnuts and sweetened dried cranberries (Craisens). I also add a tsp of cinnamon to the mixture as well. Just be sure to get them as uniform in size as possible to ensure even baking. I know that’s a “duh” moment for many of you, but I’m always in such a hurry I forget. ;-) I've always gotten rave reviews from this cookie and I'm so glad it was shared with us!"
"6","5","Yum! For soft and chewy cookies, don't push them down very far (just enough to establish their place on the tray)... take out immediately after 8 minutes; even if they don't look done, they continue cooking on the pan and after 5 minutes to cool, they're perfect! If you prefer them crispier, cook the full 10 minutes and push them down a bit if you'd like. I like mine soft and chewy, but they're good either way. Also, this batch made a lot more than 24 cookies for me, but that was fine with my family!"
"6","5","These are great! I added some walnuts, raisins, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and made them twice the size. Thanks Barbara!"
"6","5","The reviews say it all!"
"6","5","I MADE THESE COOKIES AT EASTER AND THEY WERE SOOO GOOD. I PUT CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN HALF THE MIX AND LEFT THE OTHER HALF PLAIN.VERY GOOD TASTE AND THEY STAYED SOFT.MY FAMILY LOVED THEM."
"6","5","This is a quick easy recipe and everyone loves these cookies!!"
"6","4","Made these with my 4 year old daughter and they turned out very well. Quick and easy to make. As they cooled, they got a little crispy, but still tasted great!! Thanks for sharing!!"
"5","5","WOW! These are really good!"
"5","5","What a lovely recipe! I made a half batch of these cookies, and they turned out great! I used margarine instead of butter, and I measured everything else out except the cinnamon and salt. Just added a dash of salt and maybe 2 dashes of cinnamon. Also I baked them at 350 degrees since I was using an aluminum cookie sheet and was afraid they would burn, and cooked them for about 12 minutes instead of 8. They came out great! Also make sure the dough stays cold. I left the bowl of remaining dough out on the counter when the first batch was baking. The second batch did not puff up as much as the first, but still came out good. Also baked the second batch a few minutes longer to make them crispy."
"5","5","These might just be the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I did add one cup of raisins, and they ended up being perfectly moist & chewy. This one's going on the frequent-rotation list."
"5","4","Made as is and also made using half butter have vegetable or canola oil. Doing the former is tasty and doing the latter makes for a softer cookie with enough butter taste. I like these esp. since I can easily half the recipe as the full recipe calls for two eggs. I would suggest chilling the dough first before baking though."
"5","4","Delicious!!! I couldn't stop eating the batter while I was making them. I didn't press them down and they came out think and soft. they were super easy to make too. after I left them out to cool they got as hard as a rock. These are best to eat as soon as they are out of the oven while they're still soft and warm."
"5","4","Ok, so I rated 1 star for now because of the consistency of the dough. I haven't baked these yet so I'll update after they come out of the oven. I normally use an ice cream scoop to form my cookie dough. Well...I just took my dough out of the fridge and omg, it's hard as a rock! Perhaps this is why the instructions say to 'roll the dough' because, quite literally, it's unscoopable. Being the stubborn gal that I am and, I'll admit it, I'm feeling lazy today...I'm going to let the dough sit out for a bit and see if it softens enough to scoop. I shall return! UPDATE: Alright, I couldn't wait until the dough softened. I struggled with my ice cream scoop, dropped 'em on a parchment lined baking sheet, DID NOT FLATTEN, and stuck 'em in a 375 degree oven. After 8 mins, the edges were browned and they were utterly flat. I pulled them out but they still looked completely raw in the middle. Back in they went for another 2 mins. Although they looked like the middle still wasn't fully cooked, I took them out because they were getting really dark. I made 2 different batches, one with butterscotch chips, the 2nd batch I made with semi-sweet chocolate chips, dried cranberries and toasted almonds. The second batch turned out better. The flavor is really good. We'll see if they stay soft. I decided that if I make these again I'll reduce the amount of oats and NOT refrigerate the dough."
"5","5","Great cookie recipe! I underbaked them slightly, so that they would be soft and chewy. I made this recipe pretty much exactly as written, except I left the dough in balls, and didn't press it down with a sugared fork. Also, I divided the dough in half, and added raisins to one half, and miniature M & M's to the other half before chilling. This worked well, and the cookies came out beautifully. My family is really enjoying them. Thanks for sharing the great recipe! I'll be using this one again and again!"
"5","5","I added peanuts and some peanut butter to a few of mine and they were delicious!"
"5","5","These are wonderful! Soft, delicious, and easy, and this recipe makes a TON. I added 2 cups of white chocolate chips, and they went well together. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"5","5","These are great cookies. I didn't flatten them with a fork and they can out round and chewy."
"5","5","cookies came out great!! (I followed the recipes as it...) I added white chips and cranberries- they were a hit at the church fair!!"
"5","5","These cookies were moist, delicious, and had the perfect amount of spice. *However*, and this is a bonus, my dough yielded 44 healthy sized cookies and I followed the recipe to a 'T'. Some even started out slightly larger than a walnut. Also, I skipped the refrigeration step (due to time constraints) and I didn't bother with the smooshing of the dough balls (due to laziness) and they couldn't have been better. Last, these are QUICK to put together, even for a slow-poke like me!"
"5","5","These came out at a pleasant mix of soft and chewy. However: You do not need to chill the dough, in fact, this stuff becomes almost frozen stiff if refrigerated. I'd skip the part about dipping the fork in sugar etc - I just rolled these into balls, and used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet."
"5","1","These cookies really aren't that great. They are very crunchy. Not soft. I doubled the size of the cookies and they turned out a little better. I'd rather buy oatmeal cookie dough from the grocery store."
"5","5","I was first nervous about making these because the serving size says 24, and I needed to make exactly 36 cookies. I then found that one reviewer commented that this recipe made 50 cookies for her. so, I decided to keep the recipe the same & not change the serving size. I added a heaping cup full of Trader Joe's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, reduced the oatmeal to 1 & 3/4 cup, and added a Chocolate chip morsel in the center of each cookie. SO CUTE!!. You don't need to refridgerate. In the end, I ended UP making 48 regular sized cookies & 4 JUMBO COOKIES!!! YUM-O VERYYY GOOD. I love chewy, gooey cookies & these were perfect!"
"5","5","Great recipe! I followed recipe exactly and the came out just perfect. Because I am a chocolate lover, I have also added chocolate chips to this recipe - YUM! My latest addition: chocolate covered raisins :-)"
"5","5","These cookies are AWESOME!! I added a half a cup of raisans and some dried pears. They are so yummy. Some of the other reviews said to take out some of the sugar, but I think they are perfect the way they are. If you were to take out some of the sugar, they may be a little to boring."
"5","5","i love these cookies!! They are award winning!"
"4","4","Really good cookie. Soft and chewy."
"4","5","Delicious!!! Made half with chocolate chips, and half with craison and white chocolate chips. Both turned out amazing! Followed the recipe exactly (the cinnamon is the secret ingredient!), except I just froze the dough in the freezer for 10 min while the oven was preheating, then used a cookie baller instead of pressing flat with a fork. Be sure to take the cookies out when they are just beginning to turn brown around the edges. Then let cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring. So good!"
"4","5","Wonderful recipe! I made this twice in one week! That is now good this recipe is. During the first time I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon because I only had that much around. The second time around I had forgotten to buy some more cinnamon, so I made it without the cinnamon. I didn't pack the brown sugar and skipped the fork dipped in sugar at the end. I used a cookie scooper and ended up with 2 inch cookies. I baked them for about 9 minutes. They tasted and turned out great both times. Very chewy! I couldn't stop eating them, and I even had a few for breakfast with my coffee. I got plenty of compliments on these cookies as well!"
"4","5","Great recipe! I leave them in for 8 minutes and then take them out and let them cool on the rack, and they're so soft and yummy :)"
"4","1","Very dry and pretty bland. Won't make again."
"4","5","awesome cookies!!!!"
"4","5","Made as written except for the sugar, I used coconut sugar (low glycemic) but used the same amount as written, also I didnt flatten them but left them round. They came out soft and chewy and taste great!"
"4","5","Excellent cookies - I added 1 cup mini choc chipits and 1/2 tsp each of allspice and nutmeg to kick up the flavor and they are dee-lish."
"4","5","The best oatmeal cookies! I did not refrigerate them, did not grease the cookie sheet, used spoonfuls dropped on the cookie sheet and did not flatten them with a fork. I did try a little sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top. All of this I got from other reviews. What ever you do this is a good starter to add stuff too or even good just as they are. They cook a little quicker than 8 - 10 minutes so you need to keep an eye on them. My new favorite."
"4","5","soft. could use a little less sugar next time."
"4","4","love these cookies! my husband said it wasn't too sweet but he loves sweet. these are perfect for me. chewy inside but yet hard outside. did everything on the recipe except i added raisins and it was still good!"
"4","5","I had no idea these were so easy and delicious! I got so many compliments... I added a cup of chocolate chips but only because I didn't have raisins. KEEPER!"
"4","5","These are an absolutely perfect basic oatmeal cookie recipe. Dress them up however you prefer your oatmeal treats to be. I added 1c white chocolate chips and 1/2c dried cranberries. Otherwise I kept the recipe exactly as is. Do chill the dough before baking and form into balls for thick, chewy cookies. Don't flaten them. Bakes in 8 minutes."
"4","5","I gave these to a friend of the family and she told me later they were the Best oatmeal cookies she's ever had anywhere! I always add chocolate chips to mine because that's what we like-not much of a raisin-cookie family. But this is a great recipe to add whatever ingredient(s) your taste buds prefer. I also cut down the sugar by about 1/2 cup total...just a personal preference. Everything has SO much sugar in it these days. If you cut back on this recipe they are still VERY sweet cookies-you won't even notice and they'll be slightly less fattening that way too."
"4","4","I made this recipe with my grandsons (ages 5 and 6) and it turned out great. I added dried cranberries and walnuts. I halved the recipe at this time and it was great right away but it gets a bit stale the next day. Don't double the recipe. I did that and it was very dry and wouldn't keep their form."
"4","5","A perfect oatmeal cookie."
"4","5","Oh my yummy!! I followed ingredients as written (but I did replace the white sugar with splenda). I did not chill the dough, I went ahead and rolled them into 33 little balls (did NOT flatten them or grease the cookie sheets) and baked at 375 for about 11 minutes per batch, cooled a couple minutes on the cookie sheet and moved to the cooling rack. This resulted in DELICIOUS and soft little cookies which is the way we like them. The flavor is really great!"
"4","5","Just love these cookies!!! I will say I made them exactly as the recipe said and they were VERY thin!! I pressed the first bath down with a fork and baked for 8 minutes, and they turned out underdone and incredibly delicate because of how thin they were. Don't worry about pressing them down!! They spread a lot! I may use margarine or shortening next time, as they have higher melting points. I will probably add in some raisins, too, but the flavor of these without anything added is superb!! I went with a 9 minute baking time. I like my chocolate chip cookies a bit underdone and soft, but you can't do that with these - it just doesn't work the same. They need to be cooked until they are pretty brown. Overall a wonderful recipe and a definite keeper!!"
"4","4","Of course this recipe is good; it is straight from the Quaker Oats Lid. I was looking for something different when I ran across this familar recipe."
"4","5","i am 15 and this recipe is so easy and delicious that i had to double it just to ensure that they last for more than 2-3 days! But i DID change it up a lil. Instead of using all purpose flour i used whole wheat flour and splenda to make it a little bit healthier. I did not use vanilla but i did use caramel pecan extract which is phenominal in the cookies!thank you soo much for the amazing rexcipe!!"
"4","4","Overall I quite liked these cookies. I did find there were a little too many oats, but that may be down to personal preference. Reduced oats to 2 1/2 cups, added 1/4 cup of Raisins and 1/4 cup of mini choc chips. Followed the recipe exactly."
"4","5","These turned out DELICIOUS!!! I don't usually review things and I kind of hate when people write what they did, but I thought these changes might be helpful and time saving... I used whole wheat flour and they still taste great (not whole wheaty). I also did not chill which saved a lot of time, and I did not press down with a fork with sugar. They were sweet enough already and I didn't want them to get too crisp. And I added craisins and pecans for an extra touch! Great recipe. I highly recommend!"
"4","5","There isn't really much to say that hasn't already been said but these are really great cookies. I followed the recipe exactly but did not chill or flatten dough. I think next time I will chill a little because they turned out a little more flat that I like. Excellent cookie!"
"4","5","I've never liked oatmeal cookies until now. These are absolutely outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of 1 cup of dried cherries. I used a small cookie scoop and ended up with about 6 dozen cookies."
"4","5","Five stars for sure. These are so delicious and a great base recipe for different add ins. I just dropped mine onto cookie sheet with my cookie scoop without making a ball or flattening. They were perfect. Not sure how some submitters got flat cookies-maybe ck your baking soda that its not old. Store it in a cool spot. It will lose it power. I cooked 8 minutes for a softer cookie and ten minutes for a crispier cookie. Perfection. Added 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup raisins-YUMMY! Will add choc chips in very very soon ;)"
"4","5","DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MAKING 1 BATCH. Double up the recipe. I made 2 changes. I substituted half of the flour for Bob's Whole Wheat Pastry Flour & omitted the fork & sugar bit. KEEPER"
"4","4","These cookies are very good, I love them because they are chewy! But they are so sweet, I already decreased the sugar to half and they are still too sweet, and you can feel the granules. Next time I think I will only use the brown sugar, there is no need for both. Also, there is no need to chill the batter or flatten the cookies with a fork dipped in sugar(please no more sugar! haha). You can use the batter as soon as you make it and the flattening, that all depends on the shape that you prefer for your cookies, if you like them flat them flatten them, if you dont then dont! Overall this is a yummy oatmeal cookie. I added raisins; next time I want to try dark chocolate chips and walnuts! YUM! Just a tip, when you store them (or any cookies), keep them in a plastic container with a tight fitting cover, and put the cookies in while they are still a little warm; this way they stay very chewy!! I actually think these cookies taste better the next day."
"4","4","(actually 4.5 rated recipe)good cookies but too plain for my taste.i should have added nuts or raisins."
"4","1","These cookies were not soft AT ALL. They were actually very hard, and tough. I made the recipe twice just to make sure it wasn't the way I had made, them but they were just as awful as the first round!"
"4","5","This was my first time making these cookies and they were actually very easy. I gave some to friends and family..and every single one of them said they were the best oatmeal cookies they had ever eaten! This will be the only recipe I use from now on! Thank you!"
"4","5","This recipe is excellent. I made the cookies on Monday and Friday they were still moist and chewy. With just my husband and I at home now, the amount was just right. I will definitely use this one again."
"4","5","Excellent recipe. This is my husband's favorite cookie. This is better than the name brand oatmeal recipe. I ended up with about 3 1/2 dozen cookies and had added a cup of chocolate chips. I also only cooked for 9 minutes since we like them to stay soft after a day or two. This will definitely be the recipe I stop at for good!"
"4","5","Mmmm... These made my house smell so good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for 2 things. I only used 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) that's more than enough. I was craving chocolate and I LOVE oatmeal, so I decided to make these into choco-oatmeal cookies. All I added was 3TBSP of Hershey's cocoa. If you want to use baking squares instead it equals out to 1 square. Delicious!"
"4","5","Absolutely amazing flavor! I'd suggest really watching these cookies while they bake though. They continue to cook even after you pull them out of the oven (and therefore lose that 'soft' element). PERFECT flavor-- give this one a try!"
"4","3","WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR!!! If I make these again I would definitely half the sugar. I'm sticking with the Quaker recipe."
"4","5","These are great cookies and always get compliments. I prefer to use 2 c. of oatmeal because the cookies spread more and are more chewy. Either way, delicious!"
"4","5","These cookies are so easy to make, and they're chewey and yummy! I followed the recipe, and it made a little over 3 dozen decent size cookies. Will definitely make again."
"4","5","Easy, soft and chewy cookie!! I added a 12 oz. package of butterscotch chips and omitted the cinnamon. I used a level measuring tablespoon and just flatted them with my hand. They all were all uniform in size (big) and my grandkids think they're the best oatmeal cookie they've EVER HAD!!!"
"4","5","This is the BEST Oatmeal Cookie Recipe I have ever tried and believe me, I am a cookie monster... If you like Oatmeal Cookies, you have got to try this one!!  Try adding Walnuts too.THANKS BARBARA (makes more than 2 dozen)"
"4","5","I skipped the hour chilling and just dropped them by the rounded spoonful onto the baking sheet. I followed the recipe exactly and they were a nice simple soft cookie."
"4","5","Excellent. I used half Crisco (butter flavored) and half butter. Really good"
"4","5","These are true to the claim! Soft and chewy and delicious! One thing though, they don't spread much beyond what you squish them down to with a fork, so if you want larger cookies, make larger dough balls and squish accordingly. Excellent recipe!"
"4","5","These are kick-butt cookies!! I also changed the brown sugar to 1 1/4th cup and backed the white sugar down to 3/4 cup. Also I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. They came out awesome!! My girlfriend tried them and said that from now on, I will be in charge of all 'cookie making' in the family. Try this recipe, you wont regret it I promise."
"4","5","These cookies are wonderful. I added 1 cup of butterscotch chips. Note: when they come out of the oven, they will be very soft but they firm up after standing for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet."
"4","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe. I have been baking for over 30 years and this recipe is a winner. I make it at least 3 times a month. My husband is addicted to these cookies. I do add 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup walnuts and 2Tbs of molasses."
"4","5","The oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I have been searching for! These cookies are great if you like soft, chewy cookies. I only did a couple of variations...I like oatmeal raisin cookies so I used a cup of raisins. I soaked the raisins in the egg, vanilla and a 1/2 tsp rum to plump them up and also added a little extra cinnamon. Delicious!"
"4","5","so so yummy. I used whole wheat flour with bit of wheat germ instead of the white flour and they are perfect. I will definintely make these again."
"4","5","a couple of changes for us... First used 1/2 cup splenda sugar blend and added a ton (2 1/2 cups) raisens second didn't chill, but instead spread out onto a lightly greased jelly roll pan 3rd baked at 350 for about 5 minutes longer 4th cut into about 72 small bar cookies. Saved a lot of time rolling and smushing. and then I have lots of little chewy cookies for my family."
"4","5","amazing oatmeal cookies!!! i added 2 cups of raisins.. wow makes a whole lotta cookies. definitely not 2 dozen..... more like 4?!?? but anyway...no matter!! they're gooood! must make these cookies.."
"4","5","Yummy yum yum!!! These were easy to make and SOOOOO good! I made the mistake of picking up plain instant oatmeal one time at the grocery store and never used it so I wanted to experiment with instant oatmeal packets! It turned out GREAT!!!! These are so soft and chewy! WE LOVE 'EM! Thanks Barbara!"
"4","5","I loved these cookies! They were just what I was looking for in an oatmeal cookie recipe!"
"4","5","Yum Yum and Yum.....these cookies were great. Soft and chewy..even when thawed from the freezer. I scaled for 96 and got 180 good size cookies, oh dear, but oh well the more the merrier. I divided it into 3 batches....oatmeal raisen, plain and simple...oatmeal, raisen and white choco chips a little sweeter....oatmeal, raisen, white choco chips, macadamion nuts and skor toffee pieces, now thats a cookie...works for the sweet tooth. Husband and three teens give it big thumbs up."
"4","5","I love having bacon with pasta, but with the garlic and the oil it makes the recipe really Italian. This is ideal for large amounts of people quickly and easily with a delicious meal."
"4","5","My family LOVED these cookies! It was fun and easy making them and delicious to eat. They came out very soft with a wonderful aroma that filled my kitchen. I made a batch and send them for Christmas to my parents."
"4","5","This has got to be the best cookie ever. It is soooo good and i make them now once a week for the family. I add 2 cups of raisins to my dough and the cookies are spectacular. GOOD JOB BARB. by Tammy in Manitoba"
"3","5","Great Recipe, turns out perfect just the way it is. Accidentally omitted the cinnamon, loved it anyway. Gives a sweet and chewy cookie. Recipe recommends 8-10 minutes in the oven- 8 minutes was perfect for me."
"3","5","This is a beautiful cookie. Soft and chewy with a sweet, crunchy bottom. Awesome - my new recipe."
"3","1","Awesome taste. However, they are crumbling even following the recommendations of others. Perhaps one less cup of oatmeal. Sadly this will be the first and last time I will make these ."
"3","5","These make awesome cookies! I made the dough and froze it into logs, cut them, baked them frozen.... so so so yummy and easy!"
"3","5","I goofed when making this recipe. Instead of using one cup of butter I used one stick. The cookies actually turned out great. I feel a little less guilty eating these knowing I used half the butter!"
"3","5","so I did the same as fellow members and did not refrigerate the dough. I did peal and chop two apples and mixed that in with a tablespoon of sour cream. sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top before baking (and no I did not flatten the cookie). soooooo good!!!! will be trying this many different way"
"3","5","These cookies turned out great. Followed most of the recipe. Accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda I used old fashioned oats because that was what I had and added 1 1/2 cups raisins. I lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper instead of greasing it. Also used my own homemade vanilla extract. When their still warm from the oven they're soft and chewy. After they have cooled off completely they firm up, but are still chewy and delicious. My husband and kids kept sneaking back for more. For all those who tried this recipe and had their cookies fall flat. Try mixing until the ingredients are just combined. Over mixing can cause them to flatten out. Will definitely make these again. Going to try adding chocolate chips next time."
"3","3","when I made this recipe I cooked them at 350 degrees F and for 10 minutes and it turned out nice and soft when I tried it at 375 degrees F and 8-10 minutes like the recipe said it turned out dry and crunchy but over all the cookies were soft tasted great but were a tad dry."
"3","5","I had some quick oats that I wanted to use up, and these cookies were the perfect solution! I wanted to add some raisins, and following what another reviewer said, I accordingly decreased the amount of sugar used. In addition, I didn't refrigerate the dough or press the cookies with a sugary fork because it seemed unnecessary. After I had combined all of the ingredients, I noticed that the dough was a bit dry; to compensate for this, I added a little unsweetened applesauce. The cookies baked for ten minutes exactly and came out golden-brown on the tops and bottoms yet soft inside--the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. I ate five before I stopped myself--they were that good. Very impressed!"
"3","5","So delicious! I made them because they looked easy and quick. My sister loved them! I still have a few batches left in my oven baking!! I baked mine for 9 minutes and they were perfect! This is my all time fave oatmeal cookie recipe!  My little tip: I used Splenda instead of sugar. That's what I dusted with. They are so good!   I am definitely making these again!! Love them! :)"
"3","5","These cookies are amazing! I made it exactly as it is written and they turned out perfectly. The first batch disappeared in a day so I'm making another batch with raisins. I will never use another oatmeal cookie recipe!"
"3","5","Followed the exact recipe. Easy recipe & soft chewy cookies."
"3","5","I just made them with a small revision of 1/2 cup suger, 1/2 cup brown suger , 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. They came out amazing! I did 9 minutes and very important walnut size on the pan. They came out light and tasty."
"3","4","Mixture was really sticky even after refrigeration but the taste was very good, added some MnMs for extra omph."
"3","4","-Instead of pressing with the back of a spoon I simply give them a gentle press with my thumb before putting them in the oven.   -I only used 1/2 cup of each type of sugar.  -Instead og baking for 8-10 minutes, I take them out at 6 minutes, when they are still gooey inside. When they cool, this will keep them very moist.  -I also added 3/4 cup of raisins."
"3","5","I would give these six stars if I could. These are perfect. Chewy, melt-in your mouth, positively delicious. A permanent addition to my recipe collection."
"3","4","excellent cookie! I followed the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing. I did take the posters suggestion and added 1/2 cup walnuts and a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. I yeilded 30 cookies from this recipe due to the addition of nuts and berries. Highly recommend!"
"3","5","Excellent!!! Thank-You for the recipe!! I am not sure why some say they are not moist?? Mine were soft and moist, I just followed the directions (Except didn't have butter, so I used a baking margarine). I assure you I WILL be making these again!"
"3","5","I followed the recipe and they turned out really well! I did add in dark chocolate chips which were good, but clashed with the cinnamon. So either I would skip the cinnamon or the chips next time! Good cookie! Also I did just drop them with a spoon on a cookie sheet you don't need to chill them and flatten them with a fork.."
"3","5","My coworker made these and brought them in today. They are delicious! Not too sweet, not moist and yet not dry, not as soft as I expected (I don't like them too soft anyway), not buttery. Overall a great tasting, guilt-free oatmeal cookie!"
"3","5","These are great! I did make a few modifications based on a wonderfully chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe I have. I melted no salt butter and allowed it to brown slightly to enhance the nutty flavor. I decreased the overall amount of sugar to 1 3/4 cup and used 1 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, using more brown sugar than white also increases chewiness. I whisked the butter and sugars together until well combined and added the eggs and vanilla. I whisked for 30 seconds and allowed to rest for 3 minutes, repeating this 2 more times, this allows the sugars to fully dissolve. I also added a pinch of ground cloves and nutmeg to dry ingredients. Adhered to the directions from this point on and got rave reviews from my taste testers. They are so addictive. WOW! I've made these cookies probably about 4 times in the last week, tweaking each time a bit, and they keep getting better. I definitely recommend melting and slightly brown the butter, reducing the sugar to 1 1/3 cup total (1/2 cup white sugar and the rest brown), reducing the flour to 1 3/4 cup (I used 3/4 of whole wheat flour on my last batch and they were awesome and a little healthier). I use a heavy teaspoon of cinnamon, plus ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves, 1/2 t each. SO SO GOOD!"
"3","5","Delicious baked and unbaked! I read from some reviews that you should not flatten the cookies with a fork or else the would be too thin and crisp. I did not flatten mine and they were slightly brown on the bottom. My second round I slightly pushed them down with my cookie scoop, they turned out great."
"3","5","Excellent. I used old fashioned oats. Didn't chill dough or flatten. Turned out excellent. Cooked for 9 minutes. I made 1/2 the recipe and it still made about 20 cookies."
"3","5","Just made these today. My family loves these. These are my go to oatmeal cookies. I've tried many different recipes, but come back to this one.   I did NOT roll them into walnut size balls. I always drop them by spoon. I get 4 dozen outta this recipe every time.   My kids love the taste of these cookies. I like the way the cookies look, always perfect. They never ever turn into those lumpy fat oatmeal cookies that we dislike. They always have the look of a chocolate chip cookie, chewy and flat, but not thin.  The dough mixes up perfect for me every time. So very very easy. I have made 8 dozen at a time just to stock up the freezer. They freeze perfectly.  I never have added raisins, kids dislike them, but bet they would be great.  Can't say enough good things about this recipe."
"3","5","Totally agree with Jenip. These cookies can be soft if you just bake them for 7-8 minutes at 350. Or they can be crispy if you decide to bake them for longer than 8 min. However, I think these cookies were only designed to be soft. Ingredient ratio is great, but it only works for soft cookies. Yes, The cookies will be crisp if you bake them long. Only problem is that they will also be dry. So if u like crisp cookies, dont use this recipe. If you like soft chewy cookies, this recipe is perfect, but only if you underbake."
"3","5","These are delicious frozen. I know it sounds weird but they make an excellent frozen treat (plus they last longer... not that you'll need them to). I made them once the normal way (Yum!). And once using splenda for the white sugar and apple sauce for half the butter (guiltless yum!). This is a great recipe!"
"3","3","After reading all the positive reviews I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe exactlt and they were way over-the-top sweet.They were also very flat.  I'm trying to decide if I should try 'tweaking' the recipe. Or just move on to a better one. If I tweak -- these are the changes I'd make:  Use butter flavor shortening in lieu of at least 1/2 the butter and not refrigerate or flatten before baking. Would also cut back at least 1/2-cup on the sugar. Then we might have something."
"3","5","I made these the other night with my little boy and we followed the recipe exactly, well we added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and some nutmeg...and they turned out perfect. A hugh hit. For greasing the pan I used a non stick spray, baked at 375 for exactly 8 minutes, centres still looked a little gooey but I pulled them out anyhow and they were perfect. Soft, baked through and delicious. LOVED THEM! They are all gone. Making another batch tonight! :)"
"3","5","Great cookie! MMMMMMM! I left em in a ball and made them a tbs size each. cooked them 10 min."
"3","5","I made these just before the holidays after my last batch turned into hockey pucks within a day. These were fantastic. I do recommend that you watch the cooking time if you want them to be soft. My oven (gas) cooked them in 6 minutes. I used a tablespoon to measure so they were all the same size. They didn't spread much at all.  Overall, great recipe and I will definitely make them again. I added butterscotch chips and pecans to a few to give them a holiday kick!"
"3","1","I made this recipe exactly as is and we were disappointed! They flattened out in the oven, even further than you flatten them with the fork. They were completely crispy after 8 mins in the oven due to the spreading out and they were flavorless! I do not recommend these cookies."
"3","5","All I can say is this is a great recipe for 'GOOD & MOIST'cookies. You must take the cookies out in 10 minutes and not a minute longer. THey will be brown on the bottom and soft and gooey like on top, but once they rest they are awesome. It will look like you are taking out undone cookies, but don't fear, because they are still cooking on the hot cookie pan once you take them out. I just love this recipe."
"3","5","These are great as is, BUT if you want an OUTRAGOUS Oatmeal cookie, add raisins, golden raisins and craisins! WOW! Super good!"
"3","2","crumbly, low flavor and boring"
"3","5","these are the best oatmeal cookies,i made some plain ones,and some with white and semi sweet chocolate chips sooooo tasty and moist.thank you for sharing"
"3","5","Perfect. I added a splash of black-walnut extract and a didn't refrigerate, didn't press with a fork. Just drop-cookie style, baked for about 8 minutes. I only made half a batch and I got 30 cookies!"
"3","5","Hubby drooled after eating them. I took a reviewer's advice and added 1 tsp cin and 1 tsp cloves and then I added to dash's of nutmeg. YUM!!!! I didnt cool them in the fridge. I just scooped them, flattened them and cooked them till almost done (7 min)... let them stay a little longer on the pan, and then removed to the rack. Moist chewy deliciousness!!!"
"3","5","the best cokkies i ever made but i would use rasins they taste much better"
"3","5","These are the absolute best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten! I made these recently for a family reunion of over 100 people and they were definitely a hit and everyone was asking about them! I didn't change anything about the recipe and I even let the dough sit in the fridge for several hours before baking. If you do refrigerate the dough then you will need to press the dough down with a fork because they didn't spread out much even after 10 mins in the oven. They were thick and chewy and just perfect; and I've never made oatmeal cookies before. I highly recommend this recipe!"
"3","4","I just made theses cookies, and all I can say is YUM! These are soft and the flavor is great. I wanted something different."
"3","5","LOVE these cookies. So soft and yummy! I made some changes - used palm shortening for the butter to make lower-cholesterol, used 1.5 cups brown sugar instead of any white sugar, put a little extra vanilla to my taste, omitted cinnamon and added chocolate chips.   n the past I've left cinnamon in and added dried cranberries and walnuts, which is awesome too!"
"3","5","I followed the recipe to the 'T.' Easy to follow and taste good. I added 1/4 cranberries, 1/4 raisins, and 1/4 butterscotch chips in half of the oatmeal mix so i can have varieties. Both cookies were delicious!"
"3","3","I followed the recipe, but I added in a cup of mixed: raisins, almonds, and coconut...I regretted following some of the suggestions, like not pressing it down with a fork, because the balled walnut sized version didn't cook up properly on my oven. Burned bottoms, raw interiors. Next time I would follow the sugar with the fork suggestion."
"3","4","Great cookies but really too sweet for my taste, next time I will certainly cut down on the sugar. I divided my dough into 2 parts. I baked 1 right away the other I chiled for an hour, but the result was no difference between the the two batches."
"3","5","These are so delicious - I added 1 cup of raisins & 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips. Soft, chewy - exactly the kind of cookie you want your child to remember when she is all grown up!"
"3","5","Perfect! I just used Demerara sugar for both the white and brown sugar, as I'm a huge fan and always adds an extra richness and delicious caramelized texture and taste to baking. Thank you! My boyfriend approves too;)"
"3","5","I gave this 5 stars because it was easy and it turned out great, well half of them did. So my first batch I used a traditional dark/semidark cookie sheet with the lip - and I used parchment paper - they turned out absolutely PERFECT! BUT when I tried to grease a lighter flat sheet the bottoms got real weird and crunchy ... the whole cookie didn't spread well except for the very bottom, not good. Also, I took others recommendations and didn't bother cooling or rolling the dough, and I added raisins. Delish :)"
"3","5","Got rave reviews from this one. I actually added half wheat flour as well as some molasses with white sugar instead of part of the brown sugar. Turned out wonderfully!"
"3","5","a wonderful traditional oatmeal cookie. So delicious!"
"3","5","I've been told these are the best oatmeal cookies ever."
"3","5","Delicious! Definitely soft. I made the dough yesterday and didn't get to baking them until today. I was a little curious about whether you needed to flatten them so I did it to every other cookie. Personally, I didn't taste a big difference. I didn't dip the fork in sugar either. Instead of rolling them, I used a small cookie scoop. Will definitely save this recipe."
"3","5","Great cookie! Crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Though alot of sugar, this cookie is actually not overly sweet (I even added some semi-sweet chocolate chips!). It made about 40 normal sized cookies (3'). I did substitute half of the butter with vegetable oil to lower the saturated fat content, and replaced 1/2 cup of the quick oats with natural bran. The dough will feel a little dry after refrigerating it an hour but it will still hold even after I press the balls of dough down slightly (I think you can possibly skip the refrigeration step). I like my cookies as fresh as possible, so I usually bake a dozen and freeze on parchment lined trays, and Zip-loc bag the remaining dough pucks to bake for a quick batch fresh, hot cookies from the oven. Mmmm!"
"3","4","These are some of the better oatmeal cookies I have tasted. My ONLY dislike was they were SUPER sweet. I mean, really really sweet. But based on other reviews, I did not want to cut the sugar and mess them up further. So I left the sugar alone. I did not have all purpose flour so I used self rising and omitted the salt and baking soda. They WERE pretty moist, almost too gooey so we had to bake longer than the time given and turned the oven down 25 degrees when we did that to prevent them from burning. They were very rich and yummy though. We did add 1 cup of raisins and they were great."
"3","5","I am definitely not much of a cook. But I made these cookies and my husband loved them. I will definitely make them again!"
"3","5","I have tried a lot of oatmeal cookie recipes but this is the best one I've tried so far. This recipe needs no flavor alterations. It tastes GREAT!!!! My kids loved them. They are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Bake on parchment paper and the cookies will come off without having to grease the pans."
"3","5","Wonderful cookies. I too followed the advice of another reviewer and added a small amount of nutmeg. These are great and I will be making them again. Thanks for sharing."
"3","4","These cookies are nice and soft. The flavor was really good, except my husband and I both thought that the cinnamon flavor was a little too strong to be an oatmeal cookie. My husband joked that they were a combination of a snickerdoodle and an oatmeal cookie. So next time I will probably reduce the cinnamon. But regardless, they were definitely tasty!"
"3","5","Picture perfect cookies! Try pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and they'll have a wonderful spiced flavor to them."
"3","5","I omitted the brown sugar; used 1/2 cup molasses and still used 1 cup white sugar. added other stuff like chips, raisins, and walnuts. great basic recipe!"
"3","4","Made these and loved them a little too sweet so definitely decrease the white sugar especially if adding raisins. Hence the 4 stars."
"3","5","The only ingredient substitution I made was regular-flavored Crisco for the butter because I didn't have enough butter. Also, I didn't refrigerate the dough, press cookie dough w/a fork dipped in sugar, nor grease the cookie sheet. They turned out awesome----best oatmeal cookie recipe ever......slightly crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle---YUM! Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","This cookies are the perfect oatmeal cookie. They are very soft and tasty. I had to substitute applesauce and canola oil for the butter since I can't have dairy. I also replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour. I added raisins too. I couldn't stop eating them."
"3","5","Very simple and tasty. You can't mess this one up. I didn't chill them at all, didn't grease the cookie sheets, and didn't flatten them with a fork and they still came out great. I even decided to mix everything in one bowl, just to see how it would happen. Perfect."
"3","4","This is a very good recipe. For me there is something missing that would make it great, but I'm not quite sure what. They do come out nice and soft. I divided my batch in half, and put raisins in one, and dark chocolate pieces and dried cranberries in the other half. I did refrigerate mine for a couple of hours, as I didn't have time to bake them right away. I rolled them into balls and flattened them a little bit with my palms. One very useful tool I would like everyone to get familiar with is parchment paper, it will make your life in the kitchen much easier. I always line my cookie sheets with it and then there is no need to grease anything. I don't even need a spatula to remove the cookies to a cooling rack. It is great for lining your bread pans and cake pans too."
"3","4","Ok was looking for a good cookie recipe and I came across this one and I am so glad that I did. These cookies were so soft and moist. They were even the same the day after. Kids were happy, I was happy and most of all husband was happy and he love oatmeal cookies. Thanks for sharing and this one is a keeper. As for cooking them it is always good to take them out a little before time so that they won't burn on the bottom. :)"
"3","5","try a cup or less of red hots (omit cinnamon) and a cup of white chocolate chips for a festive valentine cookies...TASTEE..."
"3","5","Hubby says 'Oh man....They're DELICIOUS!' I have to agree. I used a bit less cinnamon and added mini choc chips. These are not 'fluffy' or cake-like....they're ooowey chewey awesome good! ****UPDATE! Do yourself a favor and before you dream up all the possible add-ins....make at least 1 batch as-is. OMG!! Simple and OHHH SOOOO GOOD!!"
"3","5","These are by far these best oatmeal cookies that I have ever made and I have tried alot of good ones. I also followed another reviewers suggestion of adding 1/2 t. of ground cloves. I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter because it is cheaper. I liked it so much I made 3 batches. 1 with raisins, 1 with cinnamon chips and one with butterscotch chips. All were very good. Thank you so much for sharing."
"3","4","I cut the white sugar in half and added some chopped pecans and some yogurt chips (which are delicious, id reccomend using them if you can find them, its the same stuff they use to make yogurt covered pretzels). I didn't chill or flatten my dough because my butter didn't get too soft. I did have to lower the oven temp to 350 because at 375 the bottoms of the cookies burnt before the centers were cooked.I also got way more than 24 cookies, especially with 'walnut sized balls'... I got 57 total. These were good, they won't be my 'go-to' recipe but id make them again."
"3","5","I used the granulated sugar substitute in place of the white sugar to bring down calorie count. I also doubled the vanilla to 2 teaspoons (used Mexican vanilla - you can find this at mexican food mart - it is better than the regular big box store vanilla). These are AMAZING cookies! GREAT recipe, I have made them 3 times, always a hit!"
"3","5","Excellent recipe! No changes whats so ever!"
"3","5","Yum! Great cookies and a simple recipe. They all turned out soft and moist. No need to roll them into balls, just dropped them on a cookie sheet and they turned out great. Also didnt use a sugared fork, they bake up nice on their own. This one is a keeper!"
"3","5","These cookies are GREAT!!! I just baked them and I am so Happy...Thank You Thank You...I tried another recipe last night (must have been tired) but my 100lb Pittbull Baby looks at me like I am crazy trying to feed them to him..But this recipe is the BOMB so nice and big and soft.... Merry Christmas everyone."
"3","4","These were excellent!"
"3","5","Followed the recipe exactly and had wonderfully moist, soft yummy cookies. Thanks!"
"3","5","Since I was making these for the first time I followed the recipe exactly in regards to ingredients/measurements. I split my batter in half and added cranberries to one half and left the other just like the recipe. I saw quite a few reviews where people said they didn't chill the dough, so I decided to use my two batches to try both methods. Had MUCH better luck with chilling the dough...not doing so made for very flat, thin cookies whereas my chilled batch came out perfectly (I rolled them into balls but didn't flatten them). Loved the flavor and texture, will certainly make again!!!"
"3","5","Excellent recipe! I read all of the negative (1 star) reviews before making it, just for kicks, and was very amused that the vast majority of unfavorable reviews were from people who got negative results when they didn't follow the recipe. Amusingly, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the results were some of the best cookies I've ever made (I ended up using slightly less butter, adding chocolate chips, and a tad bit of milk). Will DEFINITELY use this one again!"
"3","3","Where did the chewy centers go? Somehow these turned out lacky yumminess."
"3","5","Wow. I have never found such a brilliant oatmeal cookie. Its chewy, soft, and simple, yet flavorful. a couple little things: many people have commented that you don't need to refrigerate the dough. I think this depends upon the temperature of the kitchen--if its cool and the dough isn't warm, then you're fine. I was baking in a tiny kitchen with no AC in 85 degree heat and my dough was starting to get melty by the time I was ready to bake. I would just be sure the dough is firm. If you follow this tip, do not press them down; if the dough was cold, that would be ok, but otherwise your cookies will spread too much (unless you want them crunchy which is fine, but not what the recipe advertises). I also definitely agree with the person who said to keep them small--walnut-sized is perfect. They spread out a bit and brown perfectly at a small size. And then you can eat MORE! Happy Baking!"
"3","1","Don't add any liquid to the cookie dough. I made the mistake of adding 1/4 cup of milk to the dough to make it easier to manage and my cookies turned out flat and doughy. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly + adding a cup of dried cranberries. I chilled the dough for an hour too. I greased the cookie sheets lightly w/ olive oil which I'm not sure if that affected them. Let's hope they firm up more in the next couple of days."
"3","5","These were soft, chewy and delicious! This was the kind of oatmeal cookie recipe I was looking for. Everyone devoured these tasty morsels!"
"3","5","I really like this recipe! If you use all whole wheat flour, the cookies won't spread as much, but it's still really good. It's a great base recipe. I can't wait to do more of my own variations."
"3","5","These cookies as so soft and chewy! I added a cup and half of raisins and I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 apple sauce. My family raved about these cookies!!"
"3","5","WOW! These are SO tasty. The first batch I baked for 9 minutes and they were too hard -but the second batch I timed for 7 minutes and they came out perfect -the next day they were still chewy. I dusted the tops with cinnamon-sugar before baking and right after pulling them from the oven...I will definitely make these again! I froze a few rolls of this dough for quick baking next time."
"3","4","good cookie!! I used WW flour and reduced the sugar and butter a bit and added applesauce instead. I added Easter colored M&M's to the batter and my kids and husband love them!!"
"3","4","Good recipe. Added 1 cup raisins. Did not chill and did not flatten. After mixing the dough I immediately scooped in heaps on the baking sheet and baked for 8 minutes. Yummy!"
"3","5","Fantastic cookies. I added shredded coconut to the batter and then topped the cookies with some toasted coconut about two minutes before they were finished baking. I did not press the cookies down with a fork and mine were nice and thick."
"3","1","Everyone who gave this a good review must not have actually followed this recipe exactly as written. I tried twice and got the same results with flat ugly looking cookies. Taste is fine but nothing special. Not soft...crispy and crumbly, no matter when I take them out of the oven."
"3","5","A perfect oatmeal cookie couldn't ask for more!!!!!!!"
"3","5","These cookies were amazing. I did not add the sugar on top, I try to use as little sugar as possible...but they turned out very chewy and moist! I will definitely make these again, but next time I may add some raisins. Thank you for posting!"
"3","5","delish... I agree that the balling and pressing is unnecessary. I just used a spoon and plopped them and they turned out great. I will make again!"
"3","5","These cookies are very good. I followed what others said about not pressing w/sugar fork. I used a cup of dried bluweberries and instead of butter I used I can't beleive it is not butter and instead of white sugar I used Splenda. My son is allergic to eggs so I used 1 tsp dry yeast to 1/4 cup warm water per egg. Even with these few changes the cookies are very moist, chewy and YUMMY! Many Thanks for sharing!!!!"
"3","5","I was looking for the Quaker Oatmeal Cookie recipe that you usually find on the inside lid of the container. I bought store brand oats though, so I checked here for something comparable. I think this recipe is almost identical and it was exactly what I wanted. The only thing I changed was I added a cup of chocolate chips. I didn't chill the dough or flatten it with a fork and they turned out great. Thanks for posting this recipe."
"3","5","Excellent cookie! I double the vanilla and use pure mexican vanilla, because my husband loves a rich vanilla taste. I also add a quarter bag of white chocolate chips or of andes mint pieces. For softer cookies, don't flatten them - they will spread out into perfect rounds on their own, retaining a moist, chewy center."
"3","5","I've made a lot of oatmeal cookies in my life. These are by far the best. I subbed the white sugar for splenda, and dropped them onto sheets instead of refrigerating/rolling. Air-bake cookie sheets, 10 minutes, perfect cookies."
"3","5","These are THE BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever made....& believe me, I have tried dozens of recipes!! They were just perfectly moist and the flavour was excellent! I will never look for another oatmeal recipe. The only change was a chocolate chip addition. Mmmmmm PERFECT!!"
"3","5","These are simply DELICIOUS! I didn't use butter. We use Fleishmans Olive Oil spread. Didn't have any vanilla, though it didn't matter. I would not press these cookies down with a fork. They turned out perfectly when formed into a walnut size ball and placed on cookie sheet. Mine did take almost 12 minutes to bake. Very moist and chewy. This is now my 'go to' oatmeal cookie recipe. I might also add that making them walnut size, you will get WAY more than 2 dozen...at least 4 dozen. I've stopped counting!"
"3","5","Oh My God! These were wonderful. I made them just as the recipe says."
"3","5","This recipe was a great success...in fact, the cookies were 'as close to perfect as they could possibly be' (my husbands words). I added 1 cup raisans and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. One could play with the sugar and additions to come up with their own 'perfect' version of this delightful recipe."
"3","5","KEEPER!! I have been looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe, this is a great one. After reading reviews I did do 'my thing' with the recipe. I subbed fresh ground white wheat for the flour, only used 2 cups quick cooking oats, 1/2 cinnamon 1/2 nutmeg, then added 1/3 cup raisins to half of the recipe and a handful of chocolate chips to the other half, baked 9 minutes and they were perfect. Didn't put in fridge-couldn't wait! Used a #20 scoop and got 20 large cookies. Hubby loved them. Thanks for the recipe, it will definitely go into my notebook of favorites to hand down to my daughter."
"3","5","These are wonderful! I added one cup of each cranberries, white chocolate chips and walnuts. These are our new favorite cookies!"
"3","5","EXCELLENT recipe if your looking for a soft cookie, this is it if your ball it before baking."
"3","5","Great tasting cookies! I prefer them soft and chewy. I did flatten the cookies a little before putting them in the oven since they don't spread very much. I baked them in my oven for 9 minutes and let them cool. I added raisins to the second batch I made and love them even more."
"3","5","'These were the best cookies I've had in a long time.' - My husband. I followed the directions to make the dough exactly and then added chocolate chips to half the batch and white chocolate chips and craisins to the other half. The taste and texture were awesome and I was really appreciative of a simple recipe without a mile-long list of ingredients! I'll be making these again!"
"3","5","this is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! the only thing i do differently is add chocolate covered raisins to the mix. then you get the chocolate and the raisins combined in your cookie!"
"3","4","Great recipe! Very nice flavor, substantial texture, and easy to make. However, I would not describe them as 'soft.' I liked the texture but really found it more chewy and crunchy.  We made 3 adjustments: - Replaced 1/2 c. of white sugar with Splenda. Next time, I'll replace all the white sugar with Splenda (but still use regular brown sugar). - Added 1 cup mixed chocolate and butterscotch chips (yum). - Baked for 12-14 minutes (at 8-10 mins, they were still raw).  I will make these again and experiment with adding a bit more cinnamon along with raisins and toasted pecans.   Thanks for sharing this classic, 'go-to' recipe."
"3","5","AWESOME!!!! I have NEVER been able to bake a cookie in my life.....until now!!!! This was the best cooking that I have ever tasted! My children love them just as much as I do. I could not wait to post my rating. I will admit that I did not wait the hour to put them in the fridge. Maybe it was more like 20 minutes for the first batch, and then I made up more cookie sheets and threw them in the fridge while the first ones baked. They were all the same. But I think that I would not have had the same results without some type of cooling. Also, these batter does get very 'thick' as others have suggested. I was lucky to have plastic gloves and mixed it by hand. And I used the exact amount of sugar and would do so every time. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
"3","5","I have tried several different oatmeal cookie recipes. I finally found a soft chewy oatmeal cookie. The name says it all. I just made these this am for my husband to take on his business trip. I had to make a second batch b/c we ate so many of them already! Thanks for the recipe Bittersweet1. This is a keeper!!"
"3","5","Excellent! I added dried cranberries and pecans also. I baked them for 11 minutes on my air bake cookie sheet, and they turned out perfectly soft and chewy. I didn't refrigerate or flatten them. I always use parchment paper, and I just dropped them right off the spoon. I'm saving this recipe to use again."
"3","4","These were very good and turned out perfectly just spooned and flattened a bit and baked for 10 min. (soft) or 12 (a bit crispier). The 4 stars is because they are WAY too sweet--I think you could reduce the brown sugar by half and maybe even the white sugar, too, particularly if you add sweet mix-ins. They hurt my teeth, but hubby loved them. Like he said, 'They are really good. They are too sweet for oatmeal cookies but they are good!' He doesn't like oatmeal cookies and I do, so they worked fine for him! I was looking for something a bit less sweet."
"3","5","These came out wonderful! I added 1 cup of Craisins (soaked in warm water for about 30 minutes). They were perfect and got rave reviews. I made no other changes other then adding the cranberries."
"3","5","These are outstanding. We used half whole wheat flour and half white, and did not flatten the dough with a fork."
"3","5","I didn't want to give up on this recipe so I tried it again tonight and they are perfect! So yummy! and in case you are wondering what I did differently here's EXACTLY what I did; I used margarine instaed of butter, I used ALL brown sugar and liquid honey instead of vanilla. As for the steps, I turned on oven just before I started to mix (thats right, before chilling the dough) I creamed the egg, brown sugar and margarine until it looked like frosting, mixed the dry ingredients by spoon THEN I mixed the dry into the wet ingredients 1/4 bowl at a time and mixed each 1/4 really well, once I finished that step I mixed 1 cup of quick oats in at a time mixing well. I let chill for about 50 minutes. I sprayed the cookie sheet with butter flavored Pam and rolled dough into ping-pong sized balls, flattened them to 1/4 inch thick with bottom of a glass and topped with mini choclate chips and another batch with frozen blueberries. Be sure that when you are making these that you take them out when the edges brown, if you have ever made sugar cookies before that is the browning you are looking for! Now that my boyfriend has caught a whif of whats going on in the kitchen, I wonder how long these cookies will last this time......?"
"3","5","I didnt change nothing with recipe. I only added walnuts, chocolate chips and toffee chips when baking to make 4 different cookies and I must say all were good but I like the toffee chips added with walnut...VERY GOOD...I like the extra crunch in the cookie...will keep recipe THANKS :)"
"3","5","THIS RECIPE CAME OUT GREAT NOT ALOT OF INGREDIENTS AND EASY TO MAKE...PLUS THEY TASTE GREAT TOO!"
"3","5","Fantastic! I made this recipe and the Quaker recipe to compare. This one was a lot better. I expected them to taste the same or the Quaker recipe to beat this one. I think refrigerating the cookies made a big difference. I made both recipes when it was in the low 80's outside so maybe that's why the Quaker one turned out flat and didn't have the great texture and appearance this recipe had. Both tasted good but I preferred this one because of texture. This one does have more salt and sugar though..."
"3","5","best cookies i have ever baked or tasted in my life! i followed the recipe exactly except instead of cooling the dough for an hour i cooled the dough for 15 minutes. They came out perfectly soft and chewy."
"3","5","This is a great recipe i tell you! I was going to make some cookies from my own recipe which is really good but it is a harder,crispier cookie.I wanted a soft recipe this time. Wow! I am not a big cookie fan but this is good!Had lots of excellant reviews and i was skeptical but let me tell you listen to them. I love to bake and give it away and this will be next on my list!"
"3","5","I just wanted to let everyone know that this recipe is very easy and is the best oatmeal cookie, it says soft and chewy. I followed the repice to the letter. I do like mine a little more spicy so I added 1 more teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon of both clove and freshly grated nutmeg. They were absolutely divine. I will be using this recipe from now on in my x-mas cookie boxs for my friends and family!"
"3","5","ohhhhh I am going to grow fat! These are so good....everybody has fallen in love with them! Followed the review tips of you guys....turned out brilliant and they do remain soft! thankss!"
"3","5","These are really good, best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I added my own likings,dried cranberries and coconut. They look like the kind you will find at bakeries and coffee houses and taste crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Yum...they are really great"
"3","5","Until I found this recipe I was a chocolate chip cookie gal. Now I`m reformed, cuz everyone knows oatmeal cookies are health food:)"
"3","3","Overall a good cookie, My only suggestion would be to use less cinnamon. Can really taste it."
"3","5","These cookies were great! I added an extra tsp of vanilla like suggested by the other reviewers. They were moist and delicious!"
"3","5","Awesome! Just like everyone before me, I think these cookies are the best ones I have ever had or made! I don't generally like oatmeal cookies much because they never seem to taste better than good ole choc chip, but these are soo good! I made mine with Whole Wheat Flour and added about 2 cups of raisins that I plumped with water ( didnt know about the egg/vanilla thing) I chilled about 2 hours and used a cookie ball scooper, I also followed others recommendations to not flatten, so, being Lazy I didn't. they flattene on their own but not too much.looks great, tastes even better. Also thought I'd mention that I use an electric oven in case it helps anyone."
"3","5","Good tasting cookie - KEY is to not over cook - only cook 8-9 minutes even if you think they are not done. I made that mistake on my first batch and they came out hard. The second batch is really good."
"3","4","I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies tasted good but mine turned out really thin, flat and not particularly pretty. I also baked another recipe of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and they were thick and beautiful, so, I know my ingredients were fresh. In spite of the way they look, they are soft and do taste really good."
"3","5","THESE ARE DELICIOUS! The best that i have ever had! Moist and chewy YUMMMMMMM I ate 2 with in 30 seconds of them coming out of the oven. MMMMMM"
"3","5","very yummy and not too spicy... just the right amount of cinnamon. took 'em to the office and they were gone in a minute!"
"3","5","Very yummy recipe. Cookies were very moist, flavorful and freeze like a dream. No need to add nuts or raisins to this recipe....cookies are perfect without them. I highly recommend lining the cookie sheets with parchment paper instead of greasing the sheets."
"2","5","Hands down the best recipe! I followed the direction but added raisins and did not grease the cookie sheet & my cookies came out fantastic! I also just spoon drop my cookies in lieu of flatten them w/a fork. My family insisted that these are our new 'must have' Christmas cookies. First time making them and it won't be my last."
"2","4","Great oatmeal cookie recipe! Aside from not adding nuts or raisins (or the extra sugar right at the end) I didn't change anything and the cookies came out perfect. Very moist, chewy cookie even after they cool!"
"2","5","This is a great, great base recipie.   I agree with others that it is unnecessary to press down. I also add a bit of milk of the batter seems to dry. I have never refrigerated the dough.   You can add almost anything to it and it turns out fantastic. I normally add a cup of both raisins and chocolate chips. My family requests these over and over!!"
"2","5","I love this cookie! I was looking for an oatmeal cookie like my granny's and I found it! Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. Cook a little longer for a crispy cookie."
"2","5","These are really good. At first i thought they were going to be hard (I only cooked them 9 minutes) because when they first cool they are hard. After a little while of sitting though they get soft. I like the flavor but did not do the sugar on the fork thing for they were sweet enough..I also went just a little less sugar and used about a tablespoon of honey. I think I might try all honey next time to make them healthier."
"2","5","I've made this recipe a few times. To make them moist and chewy, I add a pkg of vanilla instant pudding mix (no additional liquid) and top with melted butter (a must). I also add a half tsp all spice to up the flavor. Make sure you flatten the cookies, especially if you make em big like I do. If your cookie has a salty-chemically taste than you used too much baking soda. The more baking soda, the further cookies spread"
"2","5","Super easy to follow!! First time making them and not my last. I did add a cup of semi sweet mini chocolate chips and it was perfect!! So yummy!! Thank you!"
"2","5","Delicious and perfectly crispy. I used Quaker Quick Oats, halved the recipe and added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also did not chill the dough or flatten it with a fork. Cookies turned out great."
"2","5","It I'd so quick and easy to make and the cookies are delicious... I had all this just sitting around and added a little special touch of my own and I call them oatmeal surprise cookies... Yum!"
"2","4","Just tried Jan 1st, 2015...magically delicious!! I left out the salt and vanilla extract. Used half of all ingredients since I'm only cooking for 2. Instead of regular oats I used instant maple and brown sugar oats 4 packs....and waaa laa!!! Did not fork them left them walnut size and baked only 10 minutes exactly. Very soft and warm delicious with soy milk...;)"
"2","5","Originally I gave this recipe 4 stars because the first batch I made seemed to be lacking flavor. However, upon request I made it a second time, and it turned out much better somehow! I would strongly recommend adding raisins for added sweetness and a more interesting texture. Also, I subbed canola oil for half the butter and that worked fine. Instead of flattening the cookies with a fork, I just pressed them down a little with my finger - that way they were still super chewy, but cooked through. These truly are the ideal oatmeal cookie - nice taste (and you can go heavy on the spices. I even added a little nutmeg), and they bake perfectly. Would recommend!"
"2","5","Love this recipe! So easy and always perfect. I do half wheat and half regular flour. Add a tsp of baking powder. Use half quick oats and half regular oats. Sometimes chocolate chips or raisins. But even plain they are delicious. I flatten some (no added sugar needed in fork) and leave some in a ball so everybody gets to pick a cookie to their liking. Also, I use ice cream scoops to make it easy and mess free (awesome tip given to me when I was first making cookies and frustrated with having my fingers and hands sticky with dough while rolling them). And place parchment paper on cookie sheet so there is no need to grease it. In my oven, it takes about 12 to 13 minutes to bake, but I assume each oven is different. Totally recommended recipe! It yields about 3 dozen medium size cookies, or more if adding chocolate, raisins, etc."
"2","5","There is absolutely no need to refrigerate these; it seemed like such a waste of time so I didn't. i just did it as a drop cookie. Perfect!"
"2","5","Delicious ... I had to bake them a bit longer but had a great texture. I added some raisins and cut down a bit on the sugar."
"2","5","I have made this recipe twice and both times my husband ate them all. Maybe the third time he will leave me one lol."
"2","5","Just finished making these and they are absolutely delicious! !! Soft in the middle and crunchy around the edges. I didn't change anything, but I did add raisins to 1/4 of the batter. I don't think they will last through the night! !"
"2","5","These are amazing. I use 2 cups oats instead of 3."
"2","4","Softest I have made"
"2","5","I loved this. The dough was almost better than the cookies! I replaced the egg with 1 tsp flax meal + 3 tsp water, mixed separately. I used ground quick oats (put through the food processor). I added a spoonful of coconut oil after cooking the first batch, they were a little dry for my taste. I also added a handful of chocolate chips."
"2","5","I thought this recipe was to sweet so I cut the brown sugar in half and a quarter cup of the white sugar out - perfect after that. Cutting both sugars in half would be the max. After cutting the sugars down really enjoyed the cookies. Also added another 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the recipe and soft raisins."
"2","1","Followed the recipe exactly, cookies came out under baked and spread out to be touching each other into one panned cookie disaster"
"2","5","To die for! Don't grease your cookie sheet and don't flatten these, in fact I formed balls with the dough and they turned out wonderful. Also important to not overcook."
"2","4","Very yummy! I didn't use baking soda (didn't have any) & they still turned out pretty tasty!"
"2","1","Too sweet! And too much cinnamon! Followed the directions as written. Texture was good. Baked for 8 minutes and they were chewy (as desired) and not crispy or hard. Didn't taste like a cookie but like chewy cinnamon flavored sugar. In contrast, I also made the Easy Sugar Cookies submitted by Stephanie and they were perfect."
"2","5","made these cookies exactly as recipe states except I only had 2 cups of oats so I added chocolate chips.. so good I have eaten 4 already warm out of oven.. great cookie"
"2","5","Everyone loved them! I only used half the sugar (1/2C white and brown) and added some dry fruit. These are GREAT with fresh fruit and yogurt! I didn't not refrigerate the dough first AND I accidentally melted my butter but they still came out great! Next time I'll try with some agave."
"2","5","These are AMAZING, always soft and chewy and last for days. I add dried cranberries or raisins to them as well."
"2","5","These cookies are yummy!"
"2","5","Just made these and they were awesome. I think they were moist enough for an oatmeal cookie. I ran out of quick cooking oats and also used Quaker Multi Grain hot cereal for the rest. There is no way I could wait 5 minutes to let them cool! I did not flatten them. They are a tad sweet so may cut the sugar back the next time.  9/4/13 - I can't even tell you how many times I've made this recipe. The cookies are awesome. The only thing I changed was reducing the white sugar to 2/3 cup."
"2","4","Very good taste. I didn't have any raisins so added chopped pecans, different but good. Ended up with nearly 4 dozen cookies, that must have been a doubled recipe. Will make again."
"2","5","I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also added butterscotch and chocolate chips and they tasted amazing. Rule of thumb with any cookie recipe is to cut the sugar in half. It makes a softer cookie."
"2","5","A wonderful oatmeal cookie with a crunchy outside and chewy interior. I used my cookie scoop that measures about a heaping tablespoon and got 3 dozen cookies. Cooked each batch of 12 for 10 minutes."
"2","5","Perfect as-is and with additions. Tried it both ways and loved it all. The instructions were spot on - 10 min exactly in my oven and then allowed them to cool a few minutes on the pan. Absolutely perfect. NOTE: Don't hesitate to substitute old-fashioned oats for the quick-cooking oats."
"2","5","These cookies were delicious! I made these for Christmas and did three different additions, raisins, craisins, and raisinets. No adjustments of any kind were needed, these are perfect the way they are!"
"2","5","Great recipe, a total of 1 cup of sugar (1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown) is more than enough for sweetness. It can be even further reduced, to a total of 3/4 cups of sugar. I added some chopped dried apricots and chopped toasted walnuts. Great cookie, chewy, soft, filling. Baking time 10 min."
"2","5","These are awesome! Okay, I have not baked them yet, have not gotten to that step, but the cookie batter is AWESOME!"
"2","5","MMMMMM EXCELLENT COOKIES !!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING !!!!!"
"2","4","Yum"
"2","5","I tried a different Oatmeal-Raisin recipe first and I did not like them at all. So I did a little research and found this recipe with the step by step video direction. WOW! I loved it it has just the right flavors! I added a few cups of raisins and they were great! I was afraid that I would not have enough so I doubled the recipe....Was NOT necessary I still have a good two dozen cookies left over after setting five dozen cookies out at a pot luck! Will make again.....maybe with some nuts next time."
"2","5","Fresh out of the oven and incredible! I split the batch- raisins in one half, chocolate chips in the other.  I did chill the dough, but didn't flatten it. The cookies spread out just fine without any help. This recipe is a keeper."
"2","5","These cookies were great. My girls enjoyed making them. I did follow the dips that others suggest. Dipping the fork in suger and leaving them thicker made them chewy."
"2","5","Perfect base recipe!!! Due to health concerns, I substituted half of the butter with canola oil (just mixed the canola oil in with the softened butter), and results were excellent! I added raisins and chopped walnuts. Since I was too anxious to wait for one hour before baking them, I put the dough in the freezer while the oven was preheating (10 minutes or so) and they were easy to handle. I also skipped the rolling and flattening with a fork dipped in sugar part - just placed walnut-sized mounds of dough on to the cookie sheet and flattened them with the back of the spoon. I had to bake them 9-10 minutes for slightly golden edges and very chewy center. Delicious!"
"2","5","This recipe is perfect."
"2","5","Thank you Bittersweet1! This recipe worked out great. Oatmeal cookies aren't even my fave but we wanted dessert one night and only had the ingredients on hand for these. I was amazed! Keeper for sure, and they even earned me a backrub from hubby. Thanks again!  P.S., Only things I changed were I didn't have time to refrigerate (although I can see how refrigerating would make the dough much easier to handle) and I didn't dip the fork in sugar."
"2","5","Yummy yummy..:D I've cut 1/4 of sugar, 1/4 of butter, and it's still very very good...I've made 34 pcs with 5-6cm in diameter and 2 pcs with 9cm in diameter... :D Thanks for the recipe..."
"2","4","The batter looked like tuna at first I had to add a handful more of oatmeal. they came out delish :D"
"2","5","These cookies are incredible, a big hit with the entire family, even those of us who don't usually enjoy cookies. I made this recipe as is and it turned out great. I added craisins rather then raisins though."
"2","5","This cookie is amazing! I have been looking for a oatmeal cookie that stays soft days after baked. We really like raisins in ours, so I added 1 cup of raisins (soaked in hot water for about 30 minutes then patted dry). Upon reading others reviews, I tried not refrigerating for an hour, and made a few cookies, then I tried refrigerating and not smooshing the cookie down, and made a few cookies, finally I refrigerated and smooshed the cookie down. My husband and I both agree, the smooshed, refrigerated cookie didn't spread as far therefore it was the moistest and tasted the best. I won't ever try another oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!!! FANTASTIC!!"
"2","5","First time making these- they were super easy and taste great. We ended up making a sort of homemade oatmeal cream pies by sandwiching cool whip between 2 cookies we warmed up in the microwave. The kids devoured them."
"2","4","I added 3/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 cup of currents. I would use 1/2 cup less rolled oats next time. Also, I rolled them into balls and passed them through turbinado sugar. They were a bit dry and crumbly unfortunately, which is why I'd use less oatmeal."
"2","5","Made the cookies exactly as the recipe called for. I have never gotten so many compliments on a cookie before, especially the softness of the cookie. One thing, unless you are making huge cookies, you will get closer to 40 cookies than 24."
"2","5","very good, didn't smoosh them and added cranberries"
"2","5","yum!"
"2","5","Substituted Splenda for white and brown sugar. turned out excellent"
"2","4","I'm not much of a baker but these turned out really well. Since my cookies always end up flattening out and spreading quite a bit, I didn't press them down with a fork. I took them out after 10 minutes, and they were still really gooey and floppy, but they firmed out nicely while retaining a chewy center. My only minor complaint is that they weren't quite sweet enough for me, so next time I will add some raisins or choc chips. Really good though. Thanks!"
"2","5","This was an easy recipe. When I got to adding the oats I realized that I only had 1 1/2 cups. I saw that other people skimped on the oats so I tried it too. I added dried cranberries and coconut.... they were awesome. I got lots of compliments and I am not a very good baker. Try adding the cranberries and coconut for sure!"
"2","5","Just perfect.i did add chic.chips,and nuts.My new favorite cookie recipe."
"2","4","Nice texture. I think I might cut the sugar down next time to 3/4 of each. A little bit too sweet for me :)"
"2","4","I added boiled raisins and it really made a difference in the 'moistness' of these cookies. I have made these a few times now and never chill or flatten them, i add cinnamon and cardamom as well. Everyone loves this recipe! Will definitely make this one again!"
"2","5","Nice soft cookie. Cut shortening to 3/4 c. and white sugar to 3/4 c. I used a small scoop to dish them out, did not flatten Added 1/3 c. chopped nuts. Added white chips and dried cranberries to 1/2 the batter."
"2","5","Turned out great!!!! I did cut the oats down to two cups and added 1 1/2 cup of coconut and 2cups of butterscotch chips. We love cinnamon so I upped it by 1/2 teaspoon. Also from reading reviews I baked them right away doing drop cookies and they turned out perfect. My best advice is don't over bake, when the edges look slightly brown take them out and let them cool they will be perfect. My son thinks they are greatest!"
"2","5","add cranberries and pecans"
"2","5","I found 8 mins was a perfect time!"
"2","5","These are fantastic! The difference is the cinnamon. I didn't bother with the sugar on top or refrigerating them. They are fabulous. I could eat them all myself!"
"2","5","Absolutely fantastic. I followed another review and only put in 1t cinnamon, but added 1/4t clove and 1/4t nutmeg, I put in some chocolate and peanut butter chips, and I did not smoosh them down. My guests couldn't stop eating them, everyone complimented the cookies and I was asked for the recipe. I only had them in the oven for 8 minutes (thank you for the comment on timing!) and it was perfect."
"2","5","Lovely, simple flavor--very comforting. After reading the reviews, I did not refrigerate the dough nor flatten with a fork, and I kept the cookies pretty small (walnut sized dough balls). Thanks for the great recipe! I served them warm with caramel/vanilla ice cream on top and drizzled them with chocolate fudge topping."
"2","5","These were outstanding. My 16yo son cooked them for 8 minutes in a convection oven at 350 degrees. Our whole family of 7 loves them - even the die-hard 'chocolate chip only' cookie lovers of the family! He made them exactly like the recipe except he didn't press them down with a fork other than a tiny bit. Cooked for 8 min in a convection oven at 350 degrees. This is will be our 'go-to' oatmeal cookie recipe from now on."
"2","4","Really great oatmeal cookies. As noted in other reviews, to keep cookies soft cook for 8 minutes and be aware that cooking time can be affected by the cookie sheet you use. To make these cookies even better I added chopped pecans, cranberries (chopped them up in the food processor) and chocolate chips to the batter."
"2","5","The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. They do stay soft! I added chopped walnuts to the batter which enhanced the flavour. I'll make them again."
"2","5","i melted the butter, otherwise followed the recipe exactly"
"2","3","DRY! I cut the sugar in half and it was still sweet enough."
"2","5","I followed the ingredients exactly, only doubling the salt because I was using Kosher salt (so good, much better than your average salt, imo), and these turned out SO GOOD!   NOTE: I didn't chill the dough mixture in the fridge first, I didn't squish them with a sugared fork - I left them like little balls the size of walnuts instead and they were PERFECT, and perfectly sweet. I also cooked them for 11 - 12 mins instead of 10 which made them nice and chewy. Oh, and I added chocolate chips - I'm thinking raisins would've been delicious too. I also cut the recipe in half and it made at least 18 cookies - maybe more (I'm a dork, I didn't count them, but there were two pans full!) - Anyways, these were so good and super easy to make! I mixed it all by hand and it was easy-schmeasy! 5 stars!"
"2","4","I really thought these were tasty but they weren't the soft cookies I had hoped for. They turned out very thin and kinda cripsy on the edges. I think if I hadn't pushed them down with the fork, maybe they would've been puffier and softer, but I don't know. Maybe I'll try it next time. :) But they were very tasty! :D"
"2","5","These cookies are so delicious and so easy to make. I made them on the large side and they didn't spread into each other like most do. Very good cookies."
"2","5","These were great good texture on the crust and chewy on the inside I did change up the ingredients. Instead of adding salt I used sweet cream salted butter. It made quite a difference from the first time I made it. Overall I always use this recipe but just add different toppings ex.(chocolate chip,peanutbutter chips,raisin,walnuts)."
"2","5","This was pretty simple and very yummy. I added walnuts, raisins, and dried cranberries to one batch and made one batch plain. My husband ate about 9 of the batch with the raisin mixture and my finicky eater ate some of the plain. Thanks!!!!"
"2","5","very good and easy to make"
"2","3","While these taste great, they are no means soft. I only cooked them for 8 min in hopes to make them a little on the softer side. I also skipped the refrigeration step."
"2","5","I just made these cookies for My Uncle for his birthday and there the BEST oatmeal cookie Ive ever tasted IDK what someone of the people were talking about on there reviews, But I did it exactly by the reciepe and they are soft and chewy and DELICIOUS!!! Thanks So Much for sharing!"
"2","5","These came out great! I did sub bread flour instead of AP Flour. Also Did not press them down and I added pomegranate craisns, they came out amazing! Also, I used rolled oats, before adding them to the mixture I toasted them over low heat (thank you Alton Brown) I think that really brought out the flavor and chewy"
"2","5","Great cookies, Added Raisins, and 1/2 cup chunky natural peanut butter, AWESOME!"
"2","5","This recipe was awesome! I did make several changes. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco. This change as well as taking the cookies out of the oven after 8 minutes and allowing them to remain on hot cookie sheet for 2 minutes made them very soft and chewy!! I added 2 cups of mini chocolate chips.. very tasty with a nice cinnamon flavor."
"2","5","This was amazing! Out of baking holiday cookies this was by far my favorite! I added dried bluberries, dried pomegranate, and sliced almonds. I could eat the whole batch! Will make alot!"
"2","5","Baked for 10 minutes. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","These cookies were really great! Take the advice to only bake them until the edges are brown about 8 minutes at 375 (the inside will look like it needs longer but take them out anyway!). They set up really nice as they are cooling and are moist and chewy! Did some with raisins and without, and used whole oats chopped in a food processor. Delicious!"
"2","5","These were the best Oatmeal cookies ever. I added raisins but otherwise made as directed. They stayed soft for days. Thanks for sharing a great recipe."
"2","5","Excellent! 1/2 batch made 24 cookies."
"2","5","These came out excellent! I did reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used this recipe to make thumbprint cookies: make an indentation in the top of the dough ball, then add a spoonful of raspberry or cherry preserves. I got a ton of compliments on these cookies and there were none left by the end of the party!"
"2","4","pretty good a little thick for me family loved them added raisins and walnuts yummy"
"2","5","Excellent flavor and texture. The cookies remained soft after they cooled. I divided one recipe into 3 separate bowls. I left one as the original recipe as written. In another bowl I added chopped cashews, shredded coconut and coconut flavoring, in the remaining bowl I added craisins and chopped walnuts. All variations turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, and made one batch with chocolate chips, and one with craisins and walnuts. This could not have come out ANY BETTER. Extremely satisfied."
"2","5","PERFECT JUST AS IT IS! I made this recipe as written and it is FANTASTIC! Just as advertised--soft & cinnamonie ... just yummie. I wouldn't change a thing."
"2","5","Made these this weekend. Really good. Great flavor. I had no problem with the dough after being refrigerated, used a small cookie scoop. The dough was somewhat dry to work with, but bake up moist and chewy. Thanks for a great recipe:)"
"2","5","Wow-this is the best recipe! I can't stop eating them! We made a bunch of different types of cookies for the holidays yesterday, and mixed up a double batch of these, but got too tired to bake them.....so I got them out today to ball them up and bake 'em. Oh so good! These are my husbands favorite type of cookies and I will be using this recipe from now on!"
"2","5","Just try this cookies and love them. We substituted 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill organic High Fiber Hot Cereal for 1 cup of the oatmeal and love it. Added chocolate chips we did not chill the dough and had not problems."
"2","4","My whole family just love these cookies... They were so good that my sister ask me to send her the recipes, and her family just went crazy over them... then her girl friend, ask for them too! So your Oatmeal Cookies are the no#1 in our family... Happy Holidays!"
"2","4","Very good! Maybe a little too much sugar, next time I will cut that down a bit. Different than any other oatmeal cookie I have ever had. Great with craisins. I cut the recipe in half due to what I had on hand yet still ended up with 24 good sized cookies!"
"2","3","These are okay, but certainly not delicious. I did find them most if you are absolutely vigilant about taking them out before they brown. The flavor, though, is only so-so."
"2","5","This is an awesome recipe! I made these for Thanksgiving I am an oatmal cookie lover. I added raisins to the recipe and they were amazing I am making more today for my Dad who has been asking for more since Thanksgiving."
"2","5","Very pleased with this recipe. Its a keeper in my opinion."
"2","5","These cookies were really good. I made as instructed but I did not refrigerate the mix before forming and they still came out good. I left one batch in for 10 minutes and they came out soft and chewy in the middle - just the way I like it. I left another batch in for 12 minutes and they came out crunchy - my husband likes crunchy. All in all the flavor was great."
"2","5","added chocolate chips! Still amazing"
"2","5","Hands down, the best soft oatmeal cookie recipe. My family and friends agree 100% :)"
"2","5","These were AWESOME!"
"2","5","Fantastic texture and flavor! I used these in Halloween-shaped baking molds and while it didn't capture visual details in the molds because of the texture of the dough it worked really well in the bone-shaped mold! Since the cookies are soft some of the bone-shapes broke, but that was thematically consistent."
"2","4","Really good, but VERY sweet. But they're cookies, what do ya expect :)"
"2","5","very good recipe. they are soft and chewy and ther are great plain with chocolate chips or raisins . i am sure nuts would go well too"
"2","4","Very tasty cookies, and very soft. My only problem with them is that they flattened out a bit too much. I didn't flatten them with a fork nor did I roll them into balls. I just used a spoon like a drop cookie and they still flattened out more than I would like. I was expecting them to be a bit 'fluffier'. It's a very tasty and easy recipe, however."
"2","3","Whoa, way too sweet for me. Great recipe for chewy and soft cookies but it's too much sugar. I tried this using half the sugar and it was just right. Oatmeal cookies have a great nutty flavor thats good with just that dash of sweetness.."
"2","5","Great recipe. Added 1 1/2 cups chopped dates to add to the chewiness of these great cookies. A terrific addition if you like dates."
"2","5","This recipe is great just the way it is -- no changes necessary. They came out just like in the picture and were awesome!"
"2","5","Hands down, the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made, but I did make a few changes. I used margarine instead of butter because that's what I had on hand. I used only 1 tsp. of cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp. of allspice to the flour mixture. I also borrowed the idea of soaking the raisins in the beaten egg and vanilla from another recipe. I did use walnut-sized amounts of cookie dough, but only flattened them slightly and didn't bother putting sugar on the tops. I didn't so much follow the cooking time, I just removed the cookies from the oven when the edges turned a light golden brown and the cookies came out delicious, chewy and perfect. Yum!"
"2","5","I only eat soft, doughy cookies and these were the best ones I have ever made! I took other people's advice and cut the sugar down and made 1/2 a batch with chocolate chips and the other 1/2 with raisins. I still found them to be a bit too sweet, but they are so soft!!! I also didn't flatten them with a fork, and they ended up flattening by themselves. I am so excited to have found a cookie recipe that's so easy to make. It's a keeper!"
"2","5","FANTASTIC! I added golden raisin and dark chocolate chunks. My husband ate them all up!"
"2","5","This is the best recipe I have tried to oatmeal cookies. To have them chewy in the middle,just roll into balls-don't flatten. They cook perfectly."
"2","5","Great Recipe. I added craisins in half of the batch and chocolate chips in the other half. They were delicious. I left them in mounds on the pan and they were plump and very moist cookies. If you want a chewy cookie just leave them in little balls. Thanks for a great recipe. They were gone in no time!!!"
"2","5","Oh my gosh!!! All I can say is amazing!!! These are the best!! I made the recipe almost exactly. I added 3/4c. caramel bits and 3/4c. dried apple slices; chopped and made them into caramel apple oatmeal cookies. I also only left them in the fridge for about 10mins and didn't smash them down before baking and they flattened out perfectly! I will definitely be making these again!!"
"2","5","These cookies are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a pinch of cardamon. I also used rolled oats because I don't keep quick cooking on hand, and the cookies still turned out fabulously. Only problem I will have is not eating them all the same day."
"2","5","I usually read the reviews before I make something but I didn't this time. I missed the bit in the instructions about flattening the cookies before you bake them. Mine came out very flat anyway. They spread quite a bit, and I'd chilled them for about an hour and a half. They also took longer to bake for me - 13 minutes and they were brown on the bottom and very chewy. They were what I was looking for - a nice chewy, sweet oatmeal cookie. Thank you!"
"2","3","This is a great recipe. I'm sure I will be able to make at least 3 dozens of medium sized cookies. If you are in a tight budget but still prefer choco chips on it, you may place several semisweet chips after you have created balls of the batter. I suggest not to press the ball with fork as it will eventually flatten on its own while baking."
"2","5","This is the best recipe I have ever ran accrosed! I did change the butter to shortening and added half of fourth Tsp. of ground cloves. They were moist and just perfect. Butter would have made them taste even better but, I think they would have been drier and would have dried out sooner if they are not eaten right away. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it is now a favorite and my search for a good oatmeal cookie recipe is over."
"2","5","These are the BEST cookies I've ever made. I add one cup of chocolate chips to them; I will never make any other kind of chocolate chip cookies again."
"2","5","Wonderfully soft, yummy cookies, with a hint of cinnamon! I did not chill the dough, grease the cookie sheets, or flatten with a fork, and the cookies still turned out perfectly."
"2","5","SOOOoo good will now be a permanent in my recipe book. For those having gooey problems first off press the cookies down as is stated in the recipe and second they will seem gooey when they are straight out of the oven. i used a toothpick inserted in the center of the cookie it came out clean so i knew it was done. once the cookies cool off they are not gooey they are firm on the outside and soft inside."
"2","5","I made these in hopes of going into labour. I added chocolate chips rather than raisins. I was very fortunate to go into labour the next morning and these cookies were an amazing treat through out recovery. Very very delicious, chewy and yummy. I will definitely be making these again and again."
"2","5","Very good & easy cookie!! I didn't freeze the dough, I just spoon dropped on the cookie sheet right after. I also didn't press flat with a fork and it came out chewy and a little crispy on the outside. Perfect! I have this saved for next time!"
"2","4","This is my new go-to oatmeal cookie recipe. It is awesome plain or with raisins! I did everything as the recipe calls for, except I used rolled oats instead of quick cook for a slightly chewier texture. Overall these cookies were a hit in my house!"
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Very nice fluffy firm cookie. Oh but I did add chocolate chips. I prefer raisins and think they would have been better but my boys were demanding the chocolate chips. This recipe is a keeper."
"2","3","if you're following the recipe to a T, your cookies will come out quite thin. i'm going to remake these once my family has eaten the batch i've just made. they like the flavor, but, they prefer thicker oatmeal cookies - more to bite into. in order for the cookies to spread out less, i'm going to reduce the amount of butter and sugar, possibly replacing some of the sugar with honey. i'll be back!"
"2","5","If you love soft and chewy cookies, this is the one for you! These were very easy to make and are delicious. I didn't chill the dough and they still turned out fine. The sugar on the top was a bit much but still good. This was the first batch but I'm looking forward to adding chocolate chips, raisins or peanut butter on the next batch."
"2","5","The only thing I didn't do was flatten them. This made them soft and chewy. But my cookie scoop is pretty small too. I think cookies the size the instructions want would need to be flattened. I got 4 1/2 dozen, not 2 dozen. DAY TWO: These are still amazing. I'm glad I only brought four with me to work. Otherwise there wouldn't be any left for my hubby."
"2","4","These very soft and hearty! I enjoyed the texture, although I did substitue half of the butter for apple sauce and lower the sugar amount for a lower calorie version. I added white chocolate chips and dried cranberries."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe the way it is. I added raisins and more cinnamon to mine though. Great!"
"2","3","These were just OK. When I see a title that says 'soft' I think 'cake like' which these were not. I also felt like more spice was needed."
"2","5","A very good, basic recipe...very similar to the one found in the 'Joy of Cooking'. I liked the touch of cinnamon, which was not in the 'JofC' book. I cut down on the oats (2 and 1/2 cups) in favor of a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Thanks for sharing :)"
"2","5","Excellent. Followed recipe exactly, added raisins and chopped walnuts. Needed 8 mins. 30 seconds and came out perfect. Flattened them a little before baking but did not dip fork in sugar!"
"2","4","These were good. Not really soft though. I would make again."
"2","5","Subbed applesauce/oil for the butter (because I was out!), doubled everything except the sugar and used all brown sugar, about 2 1/2 cups. So good! Made mine big and they were a tad crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside!"
"2","5","Delicious cookies, and I made them with gluten-free flour and oats. They still tasted great! I also cut the white sugar in half, and added a half cup of golden raisins. I thought they were great, my parents both thought the sugar could still have been cut more."
"2","5","Super yummy!! I definitely added raisins and they were sooooooooooo good!! Big hit at my office too!!"
"2","4","You really don't need to refrigerate or press this dough down with any more sugar. The cookies are sweet enough as is and bake really nicely. Just as some other reviewers said, take them out a bit early for chewier cookies. These are really delicious with raisins."
"2","5","Left the cinnamon out and added walnuts. Best ever."
"2","5","hands-down one of the best cookie recipes i've found to date! they are the perfect mix of chewy on the inside & slightly crisp on the outside. i omitted most of the cinnamon & added butterscotch chips. as other reviewers said, there is no need to refrigerate the dough before baking, it is good to go right after mixing."
"2","5","This recipe is a keeper. The only thing I didnt like was letting it sit for a hour thats to long to wait for a cookie, but It was worth the wait in the end, this was so easy to make and so delish! It needs the rasins and nuts to make it 5 stars . Thats the only thing I recommed. God Bless and thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","These are great! I didn't have enough oats (and only the old fashioned kind), so I used only 2 cups of oats and it turned out well. I'll try 3 c next time (like the recipe calls for)! I did not refrigerate the dough for an hour, nor did I flatten them with a fork and it was just fine. I bet white chocolate chips would be perfect in this recipe!"
"2","4","Very yummy and soft. I added white chocolate chip and it was really good."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe. The quick oats make them nice and chewy without the large pieces of oat. Some reviewers argues they were crispy. I learned from America's Test Kitchen that the secret to soft oatmeal cookies is: 1) roll them in bog round balls then flatten a bit with your hands. 2) Take them out of the oven when they don't look quite done - just barely golden on the bottom and not at all on top."
"2","5","My favorite favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. Even my husband, who claims to not like oatmeal cookies, begs me to make these. They are consistantly soft- I do not flatten before baking. Also, they store well in tupperware for a few days. Great base recipe, delicious on its own, but add ins work fabulous-we like cranberries with pistachio-white chocolate!"
"2","5","These are amazing! I followed recipe, but did not do the fork. I left it in rolled balls. I added 1 cup sweetened coconut, 2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips, and 1 cup chopped walnuts. They turned out fantastic. Soft and moist. My batch yielded about 4 dozen, but my balls were about 1.5 inches big. I will definitely make these again."
"2","5","I divided the dough in two and made chocolate chip oatmeal and oatmeal raisin cookies. Deliciously soft, chewy, and flavorful cookies."
"2","5","Great oatmeal cookie!! I agree with some other people's posting - I do not press my cookies down flat, doing that does tend to make them a wider and more crunchy cookie - I left mine in little balls for about 10mins and let them cool completely. Came out perfectly chewy. I will omit the salt next time, I use salted butter and I think I can do with out the added salt. Also add a little bit of nutmeg to give them a bit more flavor. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","These were great! Very chewy and passed the husband/ son test! I used raisins in half and chocolate chips in the other half. I left them in balls and baked for 9 mins. Perfect!"
"2","5","Didn't change a thing. Absolutely delicious!! Thanks so much!"
"2","5","Great cookies, the only thing was for me the dough seemed reaaaallly dry when mixed so I added 2 tbsp of honey to make them a little stickier and less dry. It may have been my measuring was off a little but they came out good!"
"2","5","These cookies are soft and taste good. I added some chocolate chips and a dash of nutmeg. Thank you. My family loves them!"
"2","5","This is by far my fave oatmeal cookies recipe..I added some chocolate chips too, turned out great :)"
"2","5","Delicious, everyone loves them and people keep asking for the recipe."
"2","5","Just made these for the first time and they are so delicious. Will certainly be making more of these. They are moist and soft and full of flavor."
"2","5","These taste wonderful. I made these pretty much exactly to the recipe, and they came out great. I didn't flatten them with a fork; I just made them like a drop cookie. I also didn't chill them for an hour. They came out great. My whole family loves them. One of the best Oatmeal Cookie recipes I have tried."
"2","5","Just took these out of the oven and they are perfect! I only used half of the recipe and it works just as well, no alterations. I added some shredded coconut to the tops of them before putting them in the oven, yum. I didn't chill for an hour and they turned out perfect - slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I will make these again for sure :)"
"2","5","Wow - this is our new favorite cookie recipe! Usually my kids go for chocolate chip, but we didn't have any in the house, so I went hunting for a new recipe. To this, I added chopped dates, chopped apricots and coconut. I flattened them just slightly, with no sugar added, and they turned out perfectly! I'm known for my cookie-baking acumen, and these are absolutely the best I've ever made. Thanks!!"
"2","5","Just made these tonight and these are fabulous! I did as others suggested and didn't refrigerate the dough or flatten. I just used a cookie scoop to drop them on a cookie sheet. I also substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for the Cinnamon because I was really in the mood for that type of flavor and it was really good! I cooked mine for 8 minutes and they came out really soft in the center but crisp on the outside; PERFECT!"
"2","5","wow! Don't tell my husband, but I'm in love with a cookie! Like other reviewers I didn't flatten, but otherwise followed the recipe- added raisins. So amazingly good."
"2","4","I am only giving this 4 stars because the original directions say to flatten with a fork and place on greased cookie sheet. I did that with the first batch and sadly the bottom burned. Second batch I left as a ball and used an ungreased sheet. Much much better! I also put some chocolate chips in some of the dough. Delish."
"2","5","Really good no nonsense oatmeal cookies. Keep em 'no-frills' simple or add what you like. This will be my staple oatmeal cookie recipe."
"2","5","PERFECT!"
"2","5","Perfect! Better than a bakery...added chocolate chips."
"2","5","These are easily the best cookies I've ever made. I've made these a few times and always get rave reviews. Since I like to add mildly sweetened dark chocolate chips and raisins, I usually leave out the white sugar completely to compensate for the added sweeteness. The batter is so thick and holds its shape so well that I have never found the need to refrigerate the dough first, so I skip that step entirely. Also, I like thick, moist cookies, so I also skip the flattening step and just make roughly shaped balls out of them."
"2","5","Heavenly! This is a perfect recipe. I made chocolate chip, original, and chocolate chip with peanut butter and they were fantastic! I used Smart Balance (butter), and 1/2 cup of all natural sugar with 1/2 cup of regular white sugar ( i didn't have enough natural sugar). I also made them a bit bigger then walnut size and baked for 11min. My husband loved them and even took some to his work to share with his health nut buddies! They loved and approved =) Can't wait to make them again. Definitely a keeper! Thanx for sharing"
"2","5","This is such an easy recipe and the cookies alway come out great! The cookies are usually gone within an hour of me making them. I've also added in Walnuts, pecans, shredded coconut, dried cranberries, chocolate chips......you can pretty much add anything to these! I also make them in 1/2 cup portions for giant cookies."
"2","5","I've made these cookies at least a dozen times already and love it each time! I've found that if you live closer to the ocean making the cookies smaller (3/4 walnut) they tend to caramelize much better. Also if you want to add chocolate chips or raisins 1 1/2 cup makes the perfect balance!"
"2","5","This is my go to oatmeal cookie recipe, everyone who tries them loves them! I like to add chocolate chips, dried cranberries and coconut"
"2","5","These were delicious! Next time, I am going to add some raisins."
"2","5","This turned me into a Breakfast Cookie person!!! I saw the plate of cookies this morning and just *had* to have one with my coffee. I cut the white sugar down by 1/2 C, and they have the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I didn't overcook them, which is amazing for my cooking. 6 minutes seemed to be the perfect amount for them in my oven/with the size I made. It was such an easy recipe too! I've never made oatmeal cookies before. I did have to use regular oats, not the quick cooking kind, and the oats *might* be underdone, but not really noticeable. I'm going to buy quick cooking oats today though :)"
"2","5","Very yummy. I added mini chocolate chips to half the dough and both halves turned out excellent. Definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","This is the only oatmeal cookie recipe i use now. My family/friends love these! I've baked these cookies probably about a dozen times now and everytime they come out yummy!"
"2","5","Excellent as oatmeal chocolate chip (without cinnamon or raisins). Took them to a neighbors & people raved about them!"
"2","5","OMGosh! So delicious and moist. I substituted 1/2 cup of the oats with granola. Yum..."
"2","5","Awesome soft cookie recipe! I omitted the cinnamon and added 1/2 C of peanut butter. It was the perfect peanut butter cookie."
"2","5","These cookies are seriously good. I added walnuts and cranberries....Yummmy. You can save some time by not flattening with a fork. They come out looking puffy but flatten out when cooled into a beautiful cookie."
"2","5","I added 1 cup of dried cranberries, 1 cup of white chocholate chips and 3/4 cup of chopped toasted almonds. I did flatten the dough a bit before baking at 350 for 9-10 minutes. Made almost 6 dozen cookies. Scrumptious!"
"2","5","These are the best Oatmeal cookies I have ever tries, they work perfect every time, I cook them a little less time so there perfectly soft, there chewy and a little bit of crunch perfect they don't last long! Also i kind of flatten the dough down with my hand on the tray right before baking,so they get bigger when they cook, I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips and coconut YUMMY!"
"2","4","very good"
"2","4","I found the cookies to be tasty right after coming out of the oven but by the next day the consistency wasn't right. I believe that they would be a lot better if there was maybe a cup less of oatmeal."
"2","5","Chill the dough overnight. You can add butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, or raisins to change things up."
"2","5","Wow, we loved these cookies! I experimented with adding chopped pecans and dark chocolate chips to some. The pecans really added something to them, and I'd definitely add them again. They're easy to make, and the texture is wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe! We'll definitely make them again."
"2","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie! I did not make them with raisins or nut, but I actually didn't think they needed them. I like that they are not spicy or crispy like many oatmeal cookie recipes. Make sure to refridgerate, as suggested, as the cookie will bake up a little thicker and not flat. The whole recipe makes 4 dozen with a cookie scoop. In order for them to be soft they must be removed from oven about a minute or so before they are completely done, as I do with most cookie recipes. I also found that 10 seconds in the microwave will make them soft again. They taste great out of the oven or really good the next day with coffee."
"2","1","Followed recipe exactly. Not good at all."
"2","5","Fantastic! I cut down on the fat a little by substituting half the butter for applesauce! I cut back a teensy bit on the sugars and it was still a little too sweet for my taste, I think I'll cut the sugar back a little more next time I make these! Oh! Also, I did not chill my first batch before baking and they still turned out wonderful! Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
"2","5","Hey, these are great!! I halved the recipe, but otherwise did not change anything. I was only able to chill them for about 45 minutes, and they turned out great. Slightly crispy outside, chewy inside! Yay! Thanks :)"
"2","5","No wonder this recipe has 5 stars, it is wonderful!!!!! No changes necessary!"
"2","5","Don't overbake these - my first batch looked 'not quite done' at 8 minutes but they WILL darken up after they come out of the oven. First batch was overcooked, after that, they were perfect! I added about a cup and a half each chocolate chips and dried cranberries, probably could've done half a cup less oats just because of the extra additions (lots of oats floating at the bottom of the bowl in the end)."
"2","5","Great recipe. These were DELICIOUS! I couldn't stop snacking on them...definitely dangerous having them around when you're on a 'diet'..."
"2","5","I made these today and everyone loved them. I didn't chill the dough nor did I flatted them with a sugared fork and they were great. I added raisins, pecans and choco chips...YUM. This will be my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies."
"2","5","Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly. I added raisins to half of the batch and left the other half plain. Both came out moist and delicious!"
"2","5","Yummy! Very good cookie. I added cinnamon chips to the cookies to give them a little extra something. I will be making these again!"
"2","5","These were delicious and probably the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. Thank You!! I followed the ingredients listed exactly, but added 1 cup of raisins. I also did not grease my cookie sheets and they were fine and did not stick at all."
"2","4","these cookies are so delicious and easy to make! i halved the recipe and still managed to get 28 cookies out of it. the only changes i made were that i did not freeze the dough and i didn't flatten/sugar the tops. i just scooped the dough onto the parchment papered cookie sheet using a tablespoon icecream-type scooper, baked for 8 minutes, cooled on pan for 5 minutes, and transferred to a baking rack to cool completely. this is an excellent basic oatmeal cookie recipe that i will definitely be making again!"
"2","5","These are without a doubt the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever made. I made 1 batch and they were gone in a day so I had to make more. Everyone raved about them. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box."
"2","5","Wow, super yummy and thank you for this recipe! So easy, I did not chill the dough nor did I use the sugar/fork thing, I just did drop cookies on parchment, they are soft and fabulous and disappearing quickly, must go.....!"
"2","5","YUM-MMMY! ME COOKIE MONSTER (or 'sometime snack' cookie monster)! My fiance made these cookies and added a cup of raisins as suggested, and they came out phenomenal. I keep stealing them as they come out of the oven. Taste great the next day!"
"2","5","Yummy! These were really delicious. I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, plus a tablespoon of wheat germ. I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp of cloves. 2 cups of oats were plenty. I also added 3/4 cup shredded coconut and 1 cup cinnamon chips. Chopped almonds or pecans would have been really good in this but I didn't have any. The batter was kind of crumbly, so I did form them by hand into balls, but I did not flatten them with a fork or top them with sugar. I baked them for a full 10 minutes. I got 46 cookies out of this recipe. Less than 24 hours later, there are only four left! I will be adding this to my recipe box for sure!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I substituted pumpkin puree for the butter and added cloves and nutmeg. Cookies didn't spread much without the butter so flattening them with a fork was necessary--didn't dip the fork in sugar though. Very moist, flavorful cookie."
"2","3","Something good to snack on...won't be making this again any time soon."
"2","5","These came out so good! I love them! I did use Splenda for the white sugar and 50% of the flour I substituted for whole wheat flour (can't even tell!!!) Threw in a few raisins. Did NOT chill. First ones I rolled into balls and got puffier cookies. Second tray I rolled into balls and flattened slightly and got a slightly flatter cookie. By no means did I end up with a thin cookie...so maybe refrigeration is not needed, or I got lucky :)"
"2","5","I baked these as the recipe stated. Added 1 cup of raisins & did not flatten with fork. Hubby swears they are the best he remembers ever having. AWESOME!!!"
"2","5","Loved this recipe!"
"2","5","Perfectly chewy and moist...I added chocolate chips and omitted the cinnamon, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My cookies did, however, take approximately 13-14 minutes to bake."
"2","5","Love them! Have put raisins and also crainsins and white chocolate chips in them. All really good and super moist. I don't press them down so that they will stay this way."
"2","5","We thought these cookies were wonderful and easy to make!! I followed the recipe as written and had no problems at all with taste or texture. I baked them for 10 minutes using parchment paper and they came out perfectly."
"2","5","AWESOME! I used the exact ingredients and amounts and they turned out perfect. The only modification was, I used a glass mixing bowl with 2 sticks of Blue Bonnet butter, I added the sugars and I set the oven to 200° and warmed bowl with ingredients for 10 minutes then mixed. I have read a lot of comments that mention they don't refrigerate the dough after completion, this is a mistake. You refrigerate the dough for at least the hour to make it less sticky so you can handle in your hands when you roll up balls. The key is to space them far enough apart, the 2 inches in the directions is adjustable depending on how big you roll your balls, trail and error. The walnut size suggested isn't universal, some walnuts are bigger than others. I made mine the size of a super-ball. Remember them? Those tiny rubber balls that would bounce really high, bad visual I know. Once I rolled the balls and spaced them on sheets after I sprayed the sheets with baking oil, I then used a small spoon and I lightly sprayed the bottom of it with the baking oil spray every other cookie. Only press down a little, DO NOT flatten balls or the cookies will be too flat. At 375° I baked them 11-13 minutes, just enough to make the edges of the cookies a medium brown. Cool on sheets for 5, then move to wire rack to cool 15. Perfection."
"2","5","Best homemade cookie I have ever made. I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Also, I added close to a tablespoon of vanilla extract and only used 2 1/4 cups of quick oats. Oh! And I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. My cookies were not dry at all!"
"2","5","a week later and these cookies are still soft! i did change up the recipe a bit and used splenda for baking in place of the white sugar and all whole wheat flour. Because I have found that whole wheat flour sometimes makes a recipe dryer and my family likes soft cookies, i used half shortening for the butter. I don't know but it's been my experience that butter makes a crisper cookie while shortening or margarine make a softer one so i just went with what i know. i added mini chocolate chips to half the batter and dried cranberries to the other half and this recipe was sweet enough for the cranberries."
"2","5","This recipe was awesome! I've only really tried two other recipes...the quaker oats one and mom's treaure island cookies. But this one was definitely the softest and chewiest! I was craving oatmeal cookies so I made them and they turned out great. I added some semi-chocolate chips to satisfy my chocolate craving too. I will definitely keep this in my recipe box. Thanks! =)"
"2","5","amazing, soft and delicious, with a little hint of cinnamon. Such a versatile recipe! thanks for a great recipe! Next time i will try with splenda brown and white sugar, for less calories!"
"2","4","These were good...I didn't think they were the best oatmeal cookie I ever had though."
"2","5","Great recipe! I needed a basic recipe for oatmeal so that I could 'play' with it a bit. I added raisins, chocolate chips and some walnuts! I didn't refrigerate them and didn't flatten them with a fork in sugar. Just dropped them normally. They came out great!"
"2","5","All I can say is WOW! OMG! I wasn't going to review this recipe at all. I didn't even have an Allrecipes account, but decided to just to let everyone know how great these are. I made these and tried the dough, just to make sure they tasted amazing, and I couldn't even stop eating the dough! However, I did manage to stop myself from eating all of the dough and baked some off. These are HANDS DOWN THE BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever had and ever will have. This is a PERFECT recipe! Thanks sooo much for sharing this with the rest of the world!"
"2","5","Awesome!!"
"2","5","Loved these cookies, best soft oatmeal I have ever had. I used Old Fashion Oatmeal and cut it to 2 1/2 cups."
"2","5","These are great cookies! The whole family loved them and they did not last even two days! Changes: I did not freeze the dough, nor did I flatten them. I just mixed, and spoon dropped. I also added raisins. Be sure not to over bake and they will be soft and chewy!"
"2","5","I made these cookies with the following modifications: used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour, added 1 cup of chocolate chips and omitted the cinnamon. Came out divine - these will be my go-to cookies. Thanks!"
"2","5","Really soft cookies! Delicious! I added milk chocolate chips too, but I don't even think these cookies would need them. Oh, almost forgot.. I used wheat flour and they were awesome!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I slightly flattened them with the palm of my hand instead of the sugar and fork and then sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar. Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!"
"2","5","These were excellent! I added mini m&m's - I didnt have to flatten they went flat on their own, maybe I didnt put the full 3 cups oats, but it was close. Still I will use this over & over. Excellent!! Thanks"
"2","5","[I had to add on to my review. I've made these three times now and everybody LOVES them. I took them to a weekend cottage retreat (8 people) recently and everyone kept taking one - one here, one there, and by the end of the second day, they were gone. This recipe is in my 'keeper' file, for sure.] Yum!!! Soft and chewy with a little bit of crisp around the edges. Really very tasty! A keeper! The only thing I did different - 350 degrees for the oven temperature - and baked for 10 minutes."
"2","4","This is a very good cookie recipe. I was short on time so I did not refrigerate the dough first and it was fine...not too sticky and still okay to roll into balls."
"2","3","I had high hopes based on the great reviews, but I was actually a little disappointed with the way these turned out. I was looking for a chewy cookie, but the texture of these was much too cakey for my liking. Although the flavor was very good, I wouldn't make them again."
"2","5","These tasted wonderful! This was my first time making oatmeal cookies and I was suprised that they turned out so well ^.^"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! Very versatile. I added in coconut, chocolate chips and raisins.They seemed a little dry and crumbly, so I added some water and that did the trick! I really liked the flavor with the cinnamon and oats. Will make them again! Thanks"
"2","2","These turned out really bland. After tasting the dough and not thinking much of it, I added more spices (ground nutmeg, ground cloves, pumpkin pie spice, and more cinnamon), but the cookies still turned out really bland. They lived up to their soft reputation, but I expected a lot more, especially after all the high reviews. I would rather have hard cookies with flavor than soft cookies with none."
"2","5","I used old fashioned oatmeal, and added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with everything else. The kids tried talking me into letting them have them for breakfast the next morning. A keeper!"
"2","5","These were soooooooo good. The first batch were a little hard because I over baked them. They aren't kidding when they say 8-10 min. I took the second batch out when it still looked a bit under done, and let it set...those were perfect. Hearty and delicious, and perfect with raisins!"
"2","5","This is one of the best cookie recipes I have ever come across!!!! Very tasty and yummy!!!"
"2","5","I made a batch of maybe 50 cookies and brought it to work... all gone by the end of the day. (Well, I ate 11 of the 50) :)"
"2","5","Excellent cookies! I've followed the recipe exactly & they're wonderful as written. However, I usually make them with the following changes: using 3/4c butter, Splenda instead of the white sugar, replacing 1c of the flour with 1/2c wheat bran & 1/2c wheat germ (both finely ground), adding 1c craisins & 1/2c chopped pecans. If you leave them round before baking, they stay plump and sturdy, yet soft and chewy! I always freeze the dough & just bake up a batch at a time. If you do not prefer a very sweet cookie, I would recommend reducing the sugar by 1/2c. This is a great base recipe that you can easily alter to you liking!"
"2","5","Fantastic recipe.. Delicious and easy. These cookies got rave reviews from all who ate them. Thank you for a great recipe."
"2","4","I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions: 1) I added 1 cup of Raisinettes which is a perfect raisin-chocolate ratio. 2) I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet. It made exactly 5 doz, walnut-sized cookies. I made these for my boyfriend. He really liked them and said they were very good, but not the best ever. If you like soft cookies, take them out of the oven when they look raw. I took them out at 8 mins (10 mins tops) and they were soft and chewy for 24-36 hours. When I took them out when they looked done (12-14 mins), the cookies were very hard (within hours able to break teeth hard) and had a granola like taste. I do plan on making these again; mostly because my boyfriend likes them. But I found these really easy to make. I liked the fact that they spread very little on the cookie sheet so I could put 11-12 on each sheet. I also liked that the dough was firm enough that I could roll them into balls, put them into little baggies and freeze them. I didn’t eve have to defrost them. I set the timer for the usual 8 mins, put them on the sheet as balls and put them in the oven for 1-2 mins. Then I took the sheet out, pressed them flat and then continued to bake them for the remainder of the 8 mins."
"2","5","These cookies were soft and delicious, the recipe was solid. The only thing I did which sent them over the top, was to moisten the bottom of a glass, dip it in sugar and then press down the dough balls before baking. My husband is picky with oatmeal raisin cookies and he really liked these."
"2","5","These cookies have a wonderful buttery flavor. I added raisins, dates, walnuts and pecans. Nice chewy texture. Held their shape, didn't spread out flat. This will be my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe."
"2","5","I don't like oatmeal cookies but these were fantastic. I added a cup of raisins."
"2","5","Excellent cookies. I made some alterations, i added chocolate chips and pecans and rolled into larger balls (as previously suggested). The bake time was the same and they turned out fabulous."
"2","5","This recipe was so delicios and thay were so easy to make but the recipe made more then what it said but that was grate and I just added like a 1/2 cup of Semi-Sweet chocolate chips to make it a littel Chocolatie."
"2","4","These were good, well-received, but kind of flat. If you like flat chewy cookies these are the ones for you."
"2","5","These cookies are AWESOME...followed the recipe to a T except added one and a half cups of raisins..I used Baker's Joy to grease my cookie sheets and dropped them with my cookie scooper two inches apart..Baked them for 10 minutes...The yield was 5 and a half dozen WONDERFULLY soft Oatmeal Cookies...(I did slightly mash them down with a glass dipped in sugar...Three at a time before I dipped glass in sugar again.)..THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH for sharing this recipe...it is a WONDERFUL cookie which I highly recommened that you consider making...SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD."
"2","5","This recipe is a keeper! My 15 year old loved them. They were very good and soft - I did add a cup of raisins they were EXCELLENT- thank you for the recipe March 2011 - my son is now 18 years old and off to the Navy. His one request for his Care Package are these cookies - we all love them!!!"
"2","5","Best oatmeal cookie I have ever had or made. I got the idea to use butterscotch chips from another review but forgot to add it. So as I rolled the dough to freeze (it freezes well) I rolled it into the chips. YUMMY!"
"2","5","Followed the directions exactly. Awesome!"
"2","5","The best oatmeal cookie I've ever made. Would be delicious plain or with your favorite additions - I divided the dough and put raisins into one half and butterscotch chips into the other. I used a sugar-coated glass bottom to press them, but didn't press them down much, just a little as they continue to flatten as they bake."
"2","5","I'm not a big fan of oatmeal cookies in general (and I hate raisins), but these were excellent! Everyone loves them and they're so simple to make. These are now in my Christmas cookie tin line up!"
"2","5","Excellent base recipe - I used 1 Tbsp fresh orange zest, 1 cup Craisins & one package white chocolate chips per other reviewers' suggestions. They turned out perfectly soft with 8 minutes of baking time. Heavenly!"
"2","5","great recipe!...i followed the recipe exactly except i added raisins and pecans...everyone raved they were the best oatmeal cookies they had ever had..."
"2","4","The taste was good but I did have to soften them up a bit the next day. Good cookie."
"2","5","By far the best recipe for Soft Oatmeal Cookies that I have found! They taste great with or without raisins. They were a hit with all the people at my husband's place of work and with the whole family. Even after a number of days, although the outer surface became a bit tougher, the inside was still a beautiful consistency."
"2","5","I made these cookies with my daughter, and it was very easy. Everyone liked them. I split the dough into 3 parts and added chocolate chips to one, raisins to another and left the 3rd one plain. Baked them for about 8 minutes and they turned out great."
"2","4","Made these cookies with raisins, chocolate chunks (Mexican chocolate, no less), and plain. All were delicious! I used whole wheat flour and reduced 1/4 of the sugars, using Splenda for white. This recipe makes 24 very big cookies; I flattened them slightly on the sheet before baking because they didn't spread. Like other reviewers, I neither chilled the dough nor used sugar on top of the cookies."
"2","4","These were crunchy, not soft. Instead of vanilla I used crushed cardamon(but only a little) and oil in place of butter. Overall I give them 4/5 stars as they don't top another recipe I have. However, these could still stand in for your basic oatmeal cookies as long as you're not looking for 'extraordinary'."
"2","5","Fabulous. I really liked how attractive the cookies came out. I didn't chill them, no problemo with over spreading or anything. Overall really yum."
"2","4","very good cookies. they turned out very soft and chewy as described. I added a little bit more cinnamon and a dash of cloves and ginger for a little more spice. I would consider using a little less sugar next time since they are bit sweet for me. I didn't refrigerate the dough for the full hour (probably around 20 minutes) and they still turned out fine. Another note- they stay pretty true to size and don't expand much when they are done cooking, so keep that in mind when measuring out portions."
"2","5","I decreased the cinnamon by 1/2 a tsp and added a sprinkle or two of cloves and nutmeg. Fantastic and they stayed soft. Thanks!"
"2","4","Excellent! Followed the recipe to the T except I added chocolate chips. Soft, tasty, came out perfect!"
"2","3","I followed the recipe exactly and give it 4 stars. I thought the taste was great, but the texture was a little dry for me. Although it is a good cookie, I think I will keep looking for that perfect oatmeal cookie recipe."
"2","5","Easy,chewy and soft. Delicious flavor. Made exactly 3doz. large cookies....family loved these. Will make again!"
"2","4","Wonderful and easy oatmeal cookie...I followed other reviewers suggestions and didn't grease the pans, press down the cookies or chill the dough. They tasted great, a very homey flavour. My husband loved them!"
"2","5","These were so delicious!! Oddly enough, I didn't have enough oatmeal so I used around 10 packets of cinnamon and spice instant oatmeal and then just omitted the cinnamon in the recipe. Worked great. Thanks for a really great recipe."
"2","5","The few minutes difference between soft & chewy and hard & crumbly is nominal so keep an eye on them!!! I add fresh grated orange zest, sundried cranberries and pecans to mine. Heavenly..."
"2","5","They were good and chewy. The best cookies I have ever made!!"
"2","5","Awesome! Soft and Light. One of my new favorites. I didn't bother to chill in the fridge and they still turned out great."
"2","5","Very easy to make and delicious. I didn't put the dough in the fridge to chill simply because I couldn't be bothered. And I simply dropped tablespoon sized balls (without flattening) onto a cookie sheet lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect."
"2","5","great recipe! I split the batch into 2 and added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to one batch and crasins to the other. My kids gobbled them up...thanks for the recipe!!"
"2","5","These cookies were awesome! The first time that I made them, I went by the exact recipe. The next 2 times I only used 2.5 cups of oats, substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour, used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and added raisins. The last time I also added chopped walnuts. Each time they were gobbled up by everyone. The best part, aside from the taste of course, is how easy and quick these are to make! The only minor problem I had was mixing after adding the oats. Will make these again and again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Barabara!"
"2","4","This is a great basic oatmeal cookie recipe - chewy and not too sweet. It also works great with the addition of pecans, chocolate chips, dried fruit... pretty much anything."
"2","5","Absolutly delish!!"
"2","5","These were very delicious. Be sure to leave plenty of space between the cookies. I didn't have to flatten my dough. I also didn't refrigerate the dough. I added some ground cloves to mine and I added in dried cherries. I took about a cup of dried bing cherries and soaked them in hot water with a teaspoon of vanilla for about 10 minutes. Then I drained them, chopped them up and added them to the dough after the oatmeal. I also stirred in about 4 tbsp of flax seed that I round a little with a morter and pestle."
"2","5","I have probably tried hundreds of cookie recipes over the years, but I have to say that these cookies are some of the BEST I have ever had!! I followed the recipe, and made sure to put them in the fridge for an hour. They were crisp on the outside, and very soft and chewy inside. I also added 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, and they were delicious! These have become our whole family's new favorite."
"2","5","This was a good cookie! I used all brown sugar instead of the white and they still turned out REALLY GOOD. I had to cook them a few minutes longer than the recipe because they were too mushy when I first checked them. I also added only 1/2 the cinnamon and used egg whites. Next time I am going to try replacing 1/2 the butter with applesauce.   UPDATE: I made this recipe w/ 1/2 the butter, the other half applesauce, all brown sugar, and wholewheat flour. They were pretty good, not nearly as good as the first batch with the reg. ingredients. They were cakier and not as chewy...more like a muffin, but still delicious."
"2","5","Added a cup of choc chips to these. I did not flatten the cookies before baking. These came out nice and soft. Will make again but with more choc chips since I love chocolate!"
"2","5","My hubby is an Oatmeal Raisen Cookie Lover! Over the last 10 yrs. I've tried many, but this is by far the best one! Soft and Chewy, just the way we like them! I scaled the white sugar down to 2/3 cup, and next time I'm going to try 1/2 cup. I added 2c. raisens and a little extra cinnamon."
"2","5","Great Recipe! I followed the advice of a few others and only used 2 cups of oats, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, and I put 1 1/2 cups of raisins. I think it would have been better if I added even more raisins, maybe 2 cups next time. Also more cinnamon, or maybe next time try cloves as others suggest. A great cookie, i did an experiment and baked some right after I made it, and they spread out fine on the pan and I didn't spray the pan. They stuck a little but otherwise ok. I refrigerated for about 45 mins and the consistency was better, but I still sprayed the pan so they wouldn't stick. If you use a cushion air baking pan then you won't have a problem of really burning the cookies, I've left them in there for 11 or 12 mins, and they were dark brown but not burnt, and just a little crisp on the edges, but still super soft. Great cookie!"
"2","5","These cookies were delicious! It made a lot more than the recipe said but that is ok. I gave some to my parents and they loved them too!"
"2","5","Super good cookie!!! I baked mine for 9 minutes and in my oven they were PERFECT! I did grease the pan for the first batch but found it really isn't needed. I didn't dip the fork in sugar either."
"2","5","I made as written (except I used old fashioned oats), then added chocolate chips to one half and raisins to the other half. I didn't chill the dough or grease the pans or flatten the cookies (just dropped them on with a spoon). They turned out delicious, soft, chewy, and slightly spiced. Just like an oatmeal cookie should be! (And a really big 'mmmmm' from my toddler, who rarely gets cookies!) I don't often have such good success with cookies. This will be my standard oatmeal recipe."
"2","5","These cookies are to die for. I added a tad bit of cloves to really set it off."
"2","5","These cookies were great! My husband loved them because they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside."
"2","5","This recipe came out really good. I used fructose instead of the white sugar and they still came out great. I also put dried cranberries and nuts in some of them for variety. Great flavor and consistency."
"2","5","I added raisins to 1/2 of the batter and chocolate chips to the other half before chilling. Both turned out great but the raisin half would be good with some added cloves. NOTE: With the add-ins the recipe makes closer to 5 dozen cookies, not the 2 doz as listed..."
"2","5","I made these cookies trying to use up some ingredients that I've had for a while. They were definitely soft. I added some chocolate chips. Next time I will reduce the cinnamon when adding chocolate chips to this recipe. Very good. Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","These are absolutely the best! I made half with raisins and half without as my husband does not like raisins. He devoured them and he usually only eats chocolate chip cookies."
"2","5","these are just lovely! i had tried and tried to make the perfect soft oatmeal cookie for ages, and it was always a fiasco. this one showed me the secret.. chill the dough! everyone in their right mind loves this recipe!"
"2","5","These are awesome!!! I didn't have any raisins for them, so I just chopped up some grapes (I know that sounds weird, but it worked!). I forgot the cinnamon, but these cookies are so good that they don't really need it (I think, anyway). I made them for my daughter to take to preschool choir for snack and she came home with 2 cookies left (out of a bowlful) and 3 requests for the recipe! I'm making another batch today!"
"2","5","This is now my only oatmeal cookie recipe - they're that good. Be sure to chill the dough, or else they spread out a lot - on the other hand, if you like thin cookies (as my husband does), don't bother and put them straight on the cookie sheet!"
"2","5","Delicious! I just added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup cranberries, but I loved the cookie dough and it would probably taste wonderful all on it's own!"
"2","5","I made a huge batch (then split it to add different toppings) and they were the rave of christmas. i gave them to friends and family and most of them either called me back or sent me a thankyou note because they loved the crisp/chewiness of it. I didn't particularly like them with semi-sweet chocolate chips, but the dried cranberry and the spice ones (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon) were the favorites.  Good recipe! I did lower the amount of white sugar and substituted it with brown sugar."
"2","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tried. I followed the recipe exactly, and personally, I don't think it needs any twinking. Last time I made half of the batch 'as is' and added chocolate chips to the other half batch. My husband LOVED the chocolate chip ones. Tonight I am going to make them again - half chocolate chip & walnut, half cranberry white chocolate chip. Can't wait!"
"2","4","This is one of the strangest post i will make. My husband tried one and while looking at it and tasting it he said they don't look or taste like Oatmeal cookies, but they are the best Cookies i've had. So i rank them a four star because they are very good, but won't give a five because they just don't have the look or taste of a traditional oatmeal cookie. Even though he is requesting i Make more for him tonight haha. Now if your confused, then you know how i feel. :-)"
"2","5","Really yummy cookie. I followed other reviewer's advise and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 brown sugar. I added white chips and craisins to 1/2 the mixture and chocolate chips to the other half. These cookies are great and they don't go 'flat' in the oven."
"2","5","Yummy Yummy Yummy! I've used this recipe at least 6 times in the last 2 months. I like it better with semi-sweet choc. chips (it reminds me of my favorite resturaunts choc. cookies). I also use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I did this one time because I was low out of butter. Also suggest decreasing the amount of cinnamon as it interferes with the chocolate."
"2","5","I love this recipe! Lost my old oatmeal cookie recipe and found this today and tried it...with awesome result!! I did made a change however, used half butter and half shortening instead of using all butter to make it crispy around the edges and not spread out too much like all-butter recipe. Must try! Only problem is that you tend to eat about 10 at a time..."
"2","5","These cookies are so good by themselves that you don't need to put raisins or chocolate chips in them. I made some plain & some cc/raisin, and I thought the plain cookies were better. I only used 1/2 t. of salt & 1/2 t. of cinnamon. Also, I didn't chill the dough. They came out nice & soft just like the name says. We loved them!! This is one of my favorite cookie recipes."
"2","5","These turned out wonderfully well--with a few changes. I used only whole wheat flour, and I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar with 1/2 cup of white. I also added closer to 2 tsp cinnamon. They were flavorful and soft but not mushy. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"2","5","These cookies are great, I used more brown sugar/less white like other's suggested. Added dried fruit to one batch. Hubbie said that they were better than his mother's!!"
"2","5","These were DELISH!!! I modified the recipe a little bit with the 3/4 white sugar, 1tsp cinn, 2tsp vanilla and 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also added cransins, white chocoloate and coconut. These came out so perfect and soft. I only cooked them for 8 minutes. They did look undercooked, but they weren't. BEST EVER!!!"
"2","5","the cookies are delicious... i baked only 2, and formed balls and froze the rest so we'll have a treat ready to bake when we're in the mood. the recipe is very similar to quaker oats' 'vanishing oatmeal cookies'- just an extra 1/2C sugar and flour here."
"2","5","Quick question- this is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. I've made it about 3 times now. I baked these cookies today and something was different- they were not as moist as they usually are. I baked them for only 8 minutes as I always do. Any suggestions on how to make these cookies moister and chewier?? Should I add more brown sugar? I don't know what went wrong this time. They were still delicious, but someone not as moist as they usually are. Maybe a teaspoonof milk would help?? Thanks."
"2","5","Love these cookies! My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of cinnamon in half. I found the cinnamon a little overpowering when I used the full amount."
"2","5","I was surprised that such a simple recipe yielded such an extraordinary cookie! I cut out the white sugar completely and added a bit more brown. I also added raisins. Best oatmeal raisin cookies ever!"
"2","5","I HATE baking. hate it hate it hate it. But I have to say, this recipe was easy to follow and who knew I actually had all the ingredients in my cupboard already! Despite not being the avid baker that some of my co-workers are, I got rave reviews. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","So I don't even like oatmeal cookies, and I couldn't help but to nibble on these. They weren't crazily oatmealy- and were definately soft inside with a crispness on the exterior. Everyone loved them...made half the batch with raisins, and half without. Would definately make again- so easy!"
"2","5","This recipe is great! I had such fun playing with it. Instead of a whole cup of butter, I did a half cup. Then I added a half cup of PEANUT BUTTER!! Omitted the cinnamon and added a touch of milk to make it a bit more doughy. I also added a smidge more baking soda--JUST a smidge. They turned out fabulous. I would reccomend if trying this version, flatten the dough balls a bit with your fingers (otherwise they come out kinda rounded)Thanks a bunch for the great recipe!"
"2","5","these are yummy and nutritious. I put a pecan on top of each cookie as well."
"2","5","These are delicious! I was kind of skeptical, since I have tried so many different oatmeal cookie recipies and have never found one to my liking. But I gave it a chance, since it had some many rave reviews, and I am so glad I did! Soft, definitely the right texture, and such a good taste. I added 3/4 cup of raisins to the second batch (the first one was gone in a matter of hours)- yummy! Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","4","I made these as directed, and added some dried cranberries, just to try something other than raisins...they turned out very yummy, and I will make them again! BUT...I chilled the dough overnight and it was hard as a brick, I had to wait quite a while before I could even scoop any out, and then I found it to be very crumbly, and impossible to flatten with a fork. I had to shape the dough into flat round shapes with my hands before cooking them, which was very time consuming. Maybe if I had let the dough come to room temperature first it wouldn't have been so difficult. As I said though, a very good end result! I definitely recommend the cranberries."
"2","5","DELICIOUS!!! Truely very moist and tasty. Everyone loves them. I added 1 cup raisins, and cut back a little on the cinnamon. To prevent them from spreading too thin when baking, I just left the cookie sheet ungreased. The amount of listed ingredients actually makes 4 dozen cookies."
"2","5","Oh My Gosh...These were fantastic...Make sure to follow recipe exactly and you will have the best oatmeal cookies EVER!!!"
"2","5","These cookies are wonderful, and super easy to make! I added 1 1/2 c. chocolate chips, and they turned out great!"
"2","5","This had a little too much cinnamon for me, but my boyfried and my brother L-O-V-E-D these cookies. I rarely review recipes, but I am so grateful to have one of 'those recipes' in my arsenol. I am chilling dough for more now, this time with less cinnamon and some chocolate chips!"
"2","5","The best oatmeal cookie recipe ive ever had! Its a house favorite. My family asks for them every 2weeks or so lol. Its simple and easy to do and turns out ever so yummy everytime."
"2","5","Hands down THE BEST oatmeal cookies ever! Will never use another recipe again. Also, I used whole wheat flour instead of white."
"2","5","Delicious! Used Splenda instead of sugar and added raisins. Followed the rest of the directions exactly. Thanks Barbara"
"2","5","this is THE oatmeal raisin cookie i've been looking for my whole life. the edges are the slightest bit crunchy and the rest is moist, chewy and soft. i added 1 1/2 c. raisins, 3 t. cinnamon. i also took the chilled dough out of the fridge and formed them into 1 1/2 inch balls and slightly flattened them with the palm of my hand. they were a gift for my grandfathers birthday. A++++++ better than any bakery cookie!"
"2","5","The first time I tried this recipe, I used old fashion oats. Though there was good flavor, it flattened the cookie. The next time I followed the recipe exactly (using quick oats) and it turned out to be the perfect cookie! No kidding. Soft, firm and moist. I baked it for 10 minutes, any less and they didn't get done. I also used parchment paper to bake on and I highly recommend, so much easier and cleaner too. This is now a top of the list cookie! I have already added it a cookbook I am creating for my son of my favorite recipes. Thanks!"
"2","5","loved this recipes because it was simple and easy to modify. i added a cup of raisins and a cup of chopped walnuts. these cookies are so soft and chewy. i've already made them three times and they've been a hit every time!"
"2","5","I just pulled the last tray of these out of the oven, and I couldn't wait any longer to rate this recipe....FABULOUS! Soft and chewy in the center with just the right amount of crunch around the very outer edge. These are by far the best cookies I have tasted, better than gourmet bakery cookies or even those Otis Spunkmeyer cookies they sell in restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly, and added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. A word of WARNING, though, this recipe takes some elbow grease!! I don't have an electric mixer (or even the hand-crank kind), so I mixed it by hand with a spoon. Quite a workout! The dough is very thick, but it is well worth the work. Also, mine were done at 8 minutes...don't overcook!! They will look raw when you take them out (browned only around the edges and soft/gooey in the center), but they continue to set as they cool. As my boyfriend (who grabbed two right off the first tray) said, 'these are the PERFECT cookies!'"
"2","3","This one isn't a keeper. It's not bad mind you, however I don't believe it would take a bit of time to find a better oatmeal cookie recipe. These cookies are okay if eaten within 48 hours but after two days the kids wouldn't even eat them and they ended up in the trash. I cook and bake a lot, I am always in search of the perfect recipe for everything and this one, in my humble opinion, just doesn't make the grade."
"2","5","Best oatmeal cookie I've found yet - & believe me I've been looking! If you follow the directions correctly and not over cook them they are PERFECT! These have the right texture I was looking for... I only added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and one cup of chocolate chips."
"2","5","Excellent recipe!! Really easy to make. I left the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours and then it was really easy to roll. Could almost use some more cinnamon. Maybe next time!! Anyway thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper!!"
"2","5","These were fabulous.. easy, soft and tasty, just what I was looking for. They were gone in a flash. Thanks Barbara!"
"2","4","I added 1 1/2 cups raisins and cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp. They were soft and very flavorful. Thank you."
"2","4","Nice and soft; added dried cranberries. Not truly, truly decadent, though."
"2","5","These were excellent. For once I didn't even make a substitution!! I will next time put in two cups of raisins as one wasn't enough."
"2","5","A good tasting oatmeal cookie. Mine did not turn out soft but they were not as crispy as other oatmeal cookies. I added more cinnamin and did not press cookies with fork and sugar. My husband and I both give thumbs way up!"
"2","5","These cookies we're so good- crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Probably the best oatmeal recipe i've used."
"2","5","OMG - The Very Best. I made these for a group of friends right before finals - some with raisins and nuts and some with chocolate chips...now EVERYONE wants the recipe. Thank you Barbara!!!"
"2","5","Yummy cookies! Thanks!"
"2","4","The best oatmeal cookie, period."
"1","4","Just made these but excluded the cinnamon and the chill time. I also added two heaping tsp of PB2 (powdered peanut butter). It did not make it very strong peanut butter but just enough for us. I also did not dip the fork in sugar as there is enough sugar in the mix. But mine turned out very soft middles with crunchy edges and moist insides."
"1","5","Delicious! Exactly like my grandma used to make. I didn't chill or use the sugar fork flattening method."
"1","5","This was a very easy recipe. We added chocolate chips to half to taste test and we liked  the regular version the best! My family will totally make these in the future!"
"1","4","These were yummy and easy. But they were definitely on the crispy side (which I personally like). If you want them to be moist and chewy, I would recommend baking for 7 minutes or less."
"1","5","These cookies are AMAZEBALLS!!! I made them for my husband who fell asleep before the dough had chilled so I only made a couple cookies the first night for myself and I thought they were good but really dry. The next day the dough had dried out further so I added 1/4ish cups of oil (only made 1/2 the recipe) and that made all the difference. I didn't roll the dough into walnut sized balls or press them with a fork (if they look too perfect how will people know I slaved over them ; P). I just scooped big globs onto the pan and they turned out SO well!"
"1","5","made just as written except I did not chill dough and I used a cookie scooper. Turned out great."
"1","5","These cookies are good. My youngest daughter has a a gluten and dairy allergy. So I changed the butter to Blue Bonnett Lactose-Free. For the flour, I used Bob's Red Mill All-purpose baking flour. I had to add a 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum and I also added 1/2 cup of Enjoy Life semi-sweet chocolate chips. These chips are dairy, nut and soy free. I skipped the chill stage and the cookies are just as moist. Awesome recipe though"
"1","5","Yummy!"
"1","4","Great tasting! After the third batch I eliminated the sugar on fork because we thought it made the cookies too sweet. Other than that, followed the recipe and added raisins. Very good!"
"1","5","Delicious. Perfect texture."
"1","4","The cookies are great. The first batch was in the oven for 9 minutes which seemed too long so the next ones were only in for 8 minutes. After I took the dough out of the fridge, I tried forming little balls but it was way too messy. Instead I used two spoons for putting them on the cookie sheet. I think my cookies are a bit chewy but they taste great. Maybe a bit too sweet. Next time less sugar."
"1","3","They cookies are very very dry. I warmed them up in microwave to soften them when I served them."
"1","5","These turn out soft and scrumptious! My family's favorite oatmeal cookie."
"1","5","I just made these cookies and they were great! I followed the recipe exactly except I used organic oats from whole foods & I baked them for 15 minutes. They weren't as soft but they were still great. I recommend these!"
"1","5","Excellent! I baked for NO longer than 8 minutes to keep them soft."
"1","2","Way way way too sweet. I had to add a few huge scoops of unsweetened peanut butter and they're still way too sweet!"
"1","5","These cookie are goodddd..i add ex cinnamon they are chewy"
"1","5","This is incredble! The best Oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. They came out perfect and tasted even better! Easy to mix and simple to bake!"
"1","5","This was great. I did the exact recipe, but added a cup of raisins. Also, I got 45 2 inch cookies. I'm stuffed."
"1","5","This is the best recipe I have used and I find the cookies are excellent even without raisins or nuts. Be sure to use the fork on the rounded balls. So so easy and delicious."
"1","4","These are pretty good. The refrigeration isn't absolutely necessary or the flattening with a fork. They are a little sweet for an oatmeal cookie though, I think I'll cut the white sugar a little next time."
"1","2","these tasted good but the mix was so dry I could barely get a decent scoop to bake"
"1","4","These are yummy!! Ill give it four stars only because I made a few changes. I used one cup wheat flour and one cup white. I also cut the sugar a bit. I used one cup brown and half cup white. I also added raisins and chocolate chips til it looked like enough! Not very exact but whatever! I refrigerated for an hour and 30 minutes, then baked for 9 mins. Do grease the sheet and let cool before removing though!"
"1","5","It was very good. I loved making these cookies and eating them. We just put 2 cups of oats in it"
"1","4","These cookies came out great. I added dark chocolate, dried cranberry and flax seed. Over all the cookies are tender. I will bake these again"
"1","4","I followed the recipe nearly to a T. The only difference is I didn't press the cookies with a fork prior to baking, which I thought was only a peanut butter cookie thing. Any how, I used my small scooper to make equal sized balls. Baked on parchment paper for 12 minutes (10 didn't seem long enough) at 375 and they are perfect. I mixed in a cup of raisins and a cup of vanilla chips when I mixed in the oats. I creamed my butter and sugar with my hands mixer but did all other mixing with a wooden spoon to avoid over mixing. Delicious and moist cookies!"
"1","5","This recipe is deelish! Some seem to have problems with the texture. Make sure to use Quick Minute Oats. It makes a big difference to texture and moisture. I added a little more cinnamon than called for. I didn't cool in the fridge or press down and they were perfect. It is quickly our new go-to favourite. Thanks!"
"1","5","Hubby says these are the best oatmeal cookies he's ever had. I added 1 cup raisins. Didn't refrigerate dough or grease the pan or flatten. I wanted large cookies so made golf ball size and baked about 10 min in 350F convection oven, just until beginning to brown on edges."
"1","4","Good recipe. I added 1/3 - 1/2 cup raisins (boiled and drained to be more moist- cheap alternative to 'baking raisins') and reduced the cinnamon due to my picky eaters. Wonderful.  Update: I tried to replace the butter with applesauce. Not so successful.... did 1 cup applesauce to replace the butter. I knew they would not be as good as the original, stil, they are edible but disappointing. I will still to the recipe from now on !"
"1","5","My roommate and I made these. We added chocolate chip and coconut flakes. Everyone loved them, even the people that don't like coconut. The hint of cinnamon is great. We plan on making these again soon."
"1","5","This recipe is the best! I add dark chocolate to them every time. My favorite cookie ever."
"1","5","This was the best recipe I have ever tried ! My hubby and son ate them in two days! I added raisins and a dash of nutmeg."
"1","5","Not a Bad Recipe. These didn't turn out Soft, they were slightly Firm after Baking. Still pretty good. I did Sub the Butter for Butter Flavored Crisco cause that's what I had on Hand, so they have a Buttery Flavor, I can taste the Salt right off then the Cinnamon. Pretty good Cookie."
"1","5","So chewy. My husband liked them as well!"
"1","5","It makes great cookies that my whole family of hard-to-pleasers loved! I used equal parts of white and whole wheat flour. I also used whole large flake oats because that's all I had on hand. I was kind of worried that they'd make the cookies too dry but they didn't. It'll definitely be a staple in our house from now on. Thanks!"
"1","5","I just made these and they were SO GOOD! I used whole wheat flour, added a scoop of vanilla chocolate protein powder and a bit of milk, and they were delicious! They were soft when they came out of the oven, but they've crisped up a bit, which is fine. They're still tasty. Can't wait to make them again, maybe add some chocolate chips next time. Thanks!"
"1","5","Easy modification tips: - I used 2 1/2 cups of oats and a 1/2 cup of wheat germ (instead of 3 cups oats) and they had the BEST chewy texture! - I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon - this recipe is MUCH better without chocolate chips--so I don't recommend adding any - you can use Splenda instead of sugar, but they won't be quite as sweet"
"1","5","Quick! Dangerously good cookies! So hard to stop eating them:D"
"1","5","This is by far the best oatmeal cookies I ever had. My husband and daughter absolutely love them. The only I will do different next time is add less sugar just a bit to sweet for us. Thanks for sharing it, it is a keeper in our home."
"1","5","I made these tonight and they came out perfect. This recipe is a great one. They came out soft and gooey. Yum!"
"1","5","Awesome recipes"
"1","5","Yes, it's Awesome I didn't flatten with the fork and they are soft and Good.."
"1","5","I have been using different recipes on AR for the last 6 years. I'm a novice baker and love to make cookies for my two year old. I NEVER leave reviews for any of the recipes I've got on AR , so that should say something about this super yummy soft and chewy cookie!!!"
"1","5","These are the perfect cookies, chewy and soft in the middle with a very slight crispy outside. This will be my new go to oatmeal raisin cookie."
"1","2","they melted down into a shallow cookie sheet sized cookie."
"1","5","These are delicious. I added 1.5 cups of chocolate chips. Cooked perfectly at 11 minutes for me. Did not chill the dough. Used a melon baller and flattened with a fork without sugar. I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. This made 70 2 inch cookies."
"1","5","Great cookie. No need to refrigerate dough and no sugar needed on the fork to press dough down."
"1","4","I recently tried this receipe with a few adjustments. First I used margarine instead because I had no butter on hand and my mom was having a sweet tooth that was being relentless, second I used whole wheat flour (i forgot to make sure I had regular flour before i started mixing), third I didnt measure my cinamon or vanilla because I thought the measurments wouldnt overcome the ww flour taste so i eyballed and tasted until satisfied, & fourth I put some ginger in the batter and i accidently forgot the salt(probabley good since the cookies arnt as moist as promoted salt would have dried them out more). They came out great my mom loved them and so did I tatsed excellent ^.^. Also the sweetness is perfect so I didnt do the fork in sugar and flatten routine thought it would be over kill. Enjoy."
"1","5","Very easy to make and makes a lot. I love them. I have even added Hershey's Cocoa to the recipe to make chocolate ones."
"1","5","I didn't add raisins, but added pecans, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips!!!! Awesome!!"
"1","4","Love these chewy oatmeal cookies. I made 2 times the recipe 1/2 added chocolate chips and other half cranberries."
"1","5","Yum"
"1","5","Just baked a batch of those ..added chocolate chips to them .. they are awesome"
"1","5","I made these cookies soft an chewy good."
"1","5","there is no better cookie out there! try it, u won't regret it!"
"1","4","Would be even better with chocolate chips"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! Family loved these cookies."
"1","5","First time baking these awesome cookies. Made then for my husband for his birthday."
"1","5","we love this recipe. i added 1/2 cup of chocolate powder and bits of home made cacao. we just love this chewy chocolate, oatmeal cookies!!! thanks so much"
"1","3","I followed the recipe, but mine didn't come out soft and the color seemed too light. I'll try again to see if I did something wrong. The flavor was good and the family still loved them."
"1","1","It turned into a cookie cake, but completely flat!"
"1","5","I made this recipe today with a few changes. Refused sugar to 3/4 cup of each, reduced cinnamon to 1 tsp., added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup white chocolate. Backed on parchment lined sheets in 375 degree convection oven for 7 minutes per sheet. I did not flatten them. Perfect texture and taste."
"1","5","Great cookie but make sure you don't make the cookie to big. Your result will me a mushy cookie in the middle. I cooked for 8 min and they were perfect. ??"
"1","4","Just like Grandma used to make us."
"1","5","These cookies restored my faith in oatmeal raisin cookies, which were never a favorite. They're soft, fat, and delicious."
"1","5","Awesome cookies! And I'm not a baker and they're easy and delicious."
"1","5","Love the cookie recipe, My variations, I used 1cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of maple syrup. Also, 2 cups only of old fashion oatmeal, didn't have the instant type. Cookies came out soft and not too sweet. Also first batch in for 10mins, afterwards 9mins for all other batches. I got 45 cookies"
"1","5","This recipe rocked my cookie world! Very simple to make with an excellent taste and texture and wonderful visual appeal. Not that it needed it, but I doubled the vanilla to 2 tsp. and added milk chocolate chips. I've taken these cookies to holiday events a few times & they've gotten rave reviews."
"1","5","My friends and family loved these.... They were easy to make... and turned out Perfect !!!"
"1","5","Added 1 cup of white chocolate chips other then that followed this recipe to the T! Wow these cookies turned out so good I had to stop myself from eating them before my husband got home LOL."
"1","5","I tried this recipe yesterday and they turned out really good. They are soft and yummy! I added chocolate chips and chocolate on top as well which gave them something a little extra. Great recipe!!"
"1","5","These are amazing and so easy to make! I added 1 cup of raisins. My husband loved them. The only thing I did to the recipe was double it! Very moist, I did only bake them for 9 minutes and they were perfect."
"1","5","I have been making these cookies for years following the exact recipe, only adding raisins and not flattening the cookie with a fork. They come out perfect every time."
"1","5","These are amazing!! So easy to make, I've only baked ready to bake cookies so I wasn't sure how these would turn out.. followed all directions, added a spoon full of mini simi sweet chocolate chips.. I read another review that said as soon as the edges are golden they are reasy, just let them sit, I would od thought they needed more time but once they cooled they were perfect!! Will definitely take these to the in laws for Christmas ;)"
"1","1","One star this spread all over the pan and then stuck. DO NOT MAKE this"
"1","5","Yummmmmilicious!!' We added a lot of dry fruits like almonds, walnuts, cashew-nuts, etc and in stead of 1 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon we just used 1tsp. Also, we made half the batch on the job using sand and half a batch in a tandoor!!! :))"
"1","5","I used this recipe to make cookies for a Christmas treat at a church event. I am glad I kept some at home for my family to eat. They were delicious!"
"1","5","I used instant cinnamon oatmeal packets because I had them in abundance and these turned out great! I'll be making more."
"1","5","It's an excellent recipe with very basic technique. Cookies turned out perfect, crunchy on top and soft from within."
"1","5","That are a fun and good way to eat oatmeal"
"1","5","Simple and delicious oatmeal cookies. After reading some reviews I decided not to press the cookies down before baking them and they came out perfect for me, crispy around the edges and soft in the middle."
"1","4","Really good, though I did change it a bit after making them exactly the first time. 375 was too hot, so I lowered it to 350 and the cookies came out great. Instead of 1C of white sugar I did about 2/3. I still did 1C of brown sugar. This made the cookies sweet but not too sweet like the original recipe. Instead of 3C of oats, I did about 2.5C for a more chewy cookie. Also, I cut back on the salt to about 1/2 tsp. Added about a cup of choc chips. Yum!"
"1","4","these cookies are delicious & super easy! i used steel cut organic oats from trader joe's to add a lil crunch to the softness & added 1 cup of raisins as well...they came out perfect. love this recipe."
"1","3","Kinda dry. Maybe i over cooked them? I should have added raisins or cranberries instead of chocolate chips. I will not make these again. There's just to many other things out there to try."
"1","4","it worked well in school but tried it at home with my little brother and my sister it didn't come out the way we wanted it looked gooish when dough but when cooked it looked great and tasted great."
"1","5","Thanks I love them"
"1","5","I made these and ate most of them myself. I loved the fact that I had all the ingredients at home."
"1","4","its really awesome"
"1","4","I bake my cookies in a cupcake tin to get the uniformity."
"1","3","Pretty good, but..Too much sugar. I had a couple of people taste and they all agreed on this, even though I only used 1&1/2 cups in total. Also, I would go for a bit less flour in favour of more oatmeal. These felt more like snickerdoodles than oatmeal cookies to me. Finally, it took me 15 minutes to get them cooked, but this may be an elevation issue. I've had better oatties, but these were quite nice with a glass of cold milk. Thanks OP!"
"1","5","This recipe is amazing! I didn't have any eggs but still wanted to try the recipe so I used an egg substitute (1T cornstarch+ 2T water= 1 egg) they turned out amazing, soft and chewy and almost had a snicker doodle taste to them. Will make again for sure ."
"1","5","These cookies are delicious!!! I did not chill the dough or flatten them with sugar on a fork. They were moist and just right!"
"1","5","I used old fashioned oats in this recipe, so I added six teaspoons of warm water to the wet mixture and then stirred in the oats and let it sit for about 20 mins before adding the dry ingredients. The cookies turned out amazing!"
"1","5","OMG, these are great, especially right out of the oven! The only thing I did was to add walnuts and semisweet chocolate chips. I live at high altitude (6,035 ft) and didn't even need to compensate"
"1","5","Awesome recipe!! Chilling the dough is a must and undercooking slightly results in a fantastic chewy moist cookie!"
"1","5","This recipe is perfect! I like adding craisins!!!"
"1","5","Very delicious!"
"1","4","I didn't have any regular quick cooking oats on hand, but I did have a few boxes of instant oatmeal in the single serve packets (regular flavor of course). I used 9 packets which turn out to be roughly the 3 cups that the recipe calls for. Also I didn't flatten the cookies like a few reviewers suggested and they turned out great. The recipe said it would make 24 cookies but I had quite a bit of left over dough so I slapped some plastic wrap around the extra and froze it."
"1","5","An excellent recipe. Very easy to make, and super tasty. You can control how soft your cookies come out by how warm the dough is when it goes into the oven; warmer dough spreads more and gives a thinner, crisper cookie. Regardless, these cookies spread a lot upon baking, so make sure to leave plenty of room between your cookies or they'll run together."
"1","5","I made these tonight for my family's desert and they are really good. But, like others have mentioned, they aren't moist but rather a little dry. My children didn't notice the difference though, and ate them up!! I will have to find a way to make the cookies more moist but, until then, the way they are, isn't bad."
"1","5","Been making this for years always a hit, I do not put salt as I use salted butter, also I only put a pinch of cinnamon because I find its too much. (I don't like cinnamon though)"
"1","4","Good, chewy oatmeal cookie. Ten minutes was exactly perfect for me."
"1","5","Just the soft oatmeal cookie I've been looking for! I was in a hurry and skipped the refrigeration step, and the cookies still turned out great. Very good -- thanks for sharing!"
"1","3","They came out flat and spread across the whole pan."
"1","5","These are great cookie! I made the recipe just as written with the addition of 1 cup of raisins. The cookies came out soft and delicious!"
"1","5","Loved it but added dark and white chocolate chips"
"1","5","Really easy and turned out delicious!! But not soft or chewy"
"1","5","These came out perfect! I added raisins to half the batch. These are great to alter to personal taste, add chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, etc. Do these count as a breakfast food? You have oats and fruit :)"
"1","4","Good recipie, but mine were soft in the middle. Bake longer."
"1","5","These cookies were very good. A secret to make them very soft is to add 1 tablespoon of sour cream in the mixture. This will soften most any type of cookie, chocolate chip ect."
"1","5","made these today, love them!"
"1","5","These taste great!! Added in some chocolate chips. Good stuff :)"
"1","5","Perfect!"
"1","5","This recipe was fantastic. I hate cinnamon so I left that out, but I did add crcranberries, coconut and i grated in some white chocolate and they were good.?"
"1","5","Hands down the best oatmeal cookie recipe out there. When I broke out this recipe a few months ago my daughter was so happy - it brought back great memories for her. It's the only oatmeal cookie we make where I work - the previous recipe has been retired."
"1","2","This recipe no matter how I tweaked it by suggestions still came out hard not soft. It was not as flavorful as the recipe that I have already."
"1","5","Great recipe for low blood sugar!!!!"
"1","5","I am not a fan of Oatmeal Raisin but these made me a believer. Very yummy as written, well almost. I added a cup of raisins. Delicious! I guess I also changed the process too...I did not refrigerate them. Just scooped them out and baked them as the recipe said. Really tasty!!"
"1","5","I believe this was a very good recipe......very mosist and I added a hint of walnut to make it crunchy........My sister even liked them...She hates OATMEAL COOKIES.....My bird also had some too......Thank you for making this recipe so eveyone can enjoy it :)"
"1","4","This recipe, slightly modified, is excellent. My new go-to oatmeal raisin cookie.  Modifications: I weighed the flour (not really a mod, but more accurate) 2 cups all purpose = 8.5 ounces. I also increased the cinnamon a little, to 2 tsp. I only had old fashioned oats so that is what I used, as is. I completely skipped the 'chill' and 'flatten with a fork' steps. In my oven, 8 minutes was perfect. Chewy oatmeal raisin goodness."
"1","5","My 8 year old made these as written but i baked them and they were perfect. I used stoneware and baked them on a hot stone for 8 minutes. Then I let them rest on the stone for 1 minute before removing. I even added 1/4 cup raisins to the last batch. They were tasty, we couldn't stop eating them! We will definitely make them again."
"1","5","Delicious oatmeal cookie recipe! 5 stars because the cookies are great as written, however I do like to make a few changes. I add a splash of lemon juice to make the cookies a little fluffier (I almost always use it as a leavening agent when paired with baking soda if I'm making cookies...you can't taste it, and it makes the cookies not go flat). I also use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon -- trust me, it is SO good! Cooking time is on point. I use parchment paper and cook for 9 minutes at 375, leaving the cookies to cool on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack. They come out perfect every time!"
"1","5","Tried this recipe while stuck inside on a rainy day. It turned out that I didn't have vanilla or cinnamon! Not feeling like braving the weather to go to the store, I used Kahlua in place of vanilla and used 1/2 tsp of cloves instead of cinnamon. The cookies turned out great! crispy on the bottom and gooey on the inside. I did not refrigerate the dough and did not press the dough balls down. They were done at exactly 9 minutes. Highly recommend this recipe, it's fun to swap out ingredients and experiment with what you have laying around in your kitchen cabinets."
"1","5","Made these cookies several times. It's my go to oatmeal recipe. It's simple and it's great. No one I know that's tried mines can only have one. Super good!"
"1","5","We make these cookies all the time, and always get compliments on how yummy they are. We add craizons (and walnuts sometimes) however which give it a nice fruity sweetness. Always a party favorite. The only skip we often bypass is the refridgeration for an hour. We have done it both with and without, and they taste the same. Overall though, delicious!"
"1","5","Add a cup of pecans for an amazing cookie!"
"1","4","Very, Very good. Well use again adding raisins or dates."
"1","4","I love oatmeal cookies, but hate raisins. Of course, you can't find plain oatmeal cookies usually, so I wanted to try to make them myself. I had been using whole wheat flour to make banana bread and figured I would use it to make the cookies. I accidentally only added 2 cups of oats vs. the 3 called for in the recipe. I definitely did not miss the 3rd cup of oats and actually think it would have dried the cookie out too much. They turned out perfect! I probably got about 3-4 dozen cookies by scooping a tablespoon of dough for each cookie. I did flatten them with a fork, but they don't flatten much more after baking for 8-9 min. Since the first batch, I have tried them several different ways by adding chocolate chips, shredded coconut, etc. They have been awesome each time! Even my picky 6 year old, who oddly doesn't usually like cookies, loved them. I did try this recipe with regular flour, but the cookies turned out terrible. They were too flat and thin. I didn't even bother cooking the whole batch and actually threw them all away. I will definitely not make this recipe with regular flour again, as the taste just wasn't good and doesn't compare to the whole wheat cookies. I gave a 4 just because the regular flour does not work for me, but a 5 with the small alterations I made. I didn't realize what a difference the whole wheat flour would make. I'm glad my first batch was with the whole wheat flour, otherwise I wouldn't have made these cookies again."
"1","5","These are delicious. Very good as written, but for my favourite variation I add raisins, cranberries and apricots, and use a 2:1 mix of quick oats to rolled oats. Don't skimp on the salt, it boosts the flavours."
"1","5","These are without a doubt the best cookies I've ever made. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except we're gluten free so I used an all purpose gluten free flour. I also just dropped them and didn't flatten them. SO MOIST and DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","Of all the recipes for oatmeal cookies I've made over the years, these are by far the best! Have to agree with RedSoxRule that can't put my finger on what separates this from the rest, but they are awesome! Although I omitted the cinnamon and added 3/4 cup coconut that I pulsed a few times in the food processor(think the texture of the cookie is better if I do this)and in doing so, added 1/4 cup less white sugar, due to the sweetness of the coconut. Next time I may make it as written...either way, this is one good cookie!"
"1","5","Favorite cookies"
"1","2","The cookie actually tasted pretty good; it had a good flavor and it was soft and chewy. After tasting the raw batter, I was afraid it would be too strong of a cinnamon taste, but it mellowed out and was perfect. However, the cookie didn't hold together. It stuck to the pan and had the consistency more like granola. Maybe it needs more 'cookie' substance and a few less oats."
"1","1","When they got cold, they turned hard as a rock. Will not be making these a second time."
"1","5","Swapped out 3/4 of the butter with Extra Light olive oil, and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. All was still very very tasty."
"1","5","Yummy. Made these for my aunt for Christmas and she and I both loved them. Super easy to make too. Thanks"
"1","5","These were really good. I made these for my Mom. I personally never liked oatmeal cookies but these are so good. I can't stop eating them. I only used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon & that was actually too much for my preference. Next time I wont use it at all. Half of the batch I added raisins."
"1","5","Delish!!! And so moist! Always a hit!"
"1","5","These turned out great. Had to take them out at 11 minutes exactly for soft oatmeal cookies. I added some butterscotch chips and they were delish!"
"1","5","These are the most delicious oatmeal cookies EVER!!!! I highly recommend these and to soften them up when you are ready to serve them just put in them in the microwave for a few seconds.. I put them in about 10 - 15 secs per cookie! This makes them seem fresh right out of the oven!"
"1","5","Great cookie! I had left a batch in a little to long, and they were still soft."
"1","4","they are very thick and dumpy.. but it seemed to be chewy when they cooled so that is a plus- I used half of the brown sugar to make them softer- too much sugar would have made this more stiff.... so good recipe minus the sugar"
"1","4","These cookies turned out great, however, I followed the advise of other reviewers and cut the white sugar down to 2/3 cup. The cookies were crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","I haven't been able to find an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe that I've liked after a lot of searching. I chose this recipe as a base and it turned out perfectly. Short on time and didn't flatten with a fork or refrigerate, I just baked them and they were perfect. At 10 minutes the outside was just crispy while the inside was cooked but soft. I tried adding raisins by soaking 1 cup of raisins in hot water, draining and then tossing them with about 1/4 c. flour before stirring them in at the very end after adding the oats. I was making these for someone else as I have never been a fan of this type of cookie and WOW. Hands down, best oatmeal raisin cookies EVER. Thank you so much for sharing!!"
"1","5","These were delicious. I didn't do the sugared fork and just smooshed with my palm. May try adding diced apple next time. MMMMmmmmm"
"1","4","Just made these last night, but made some changes as this recipe looked a little bland. I added more cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I also added about 3/4 cups of cranberries and 1/3 cup dark chocolate chips. No refrigerating and make them slightly bigger, like the size of a meatball. Baked for 15 minutes and they were perfect. They were chewy and a nice buttery taste with just a hint of crunch. Even my picky daughter gobbled them up. This is a keeper with modifications."
"1","5","Awesome! I added chocolate chips and used coconut flour instead. They kept disapearing!"
"1","5","I made a couple of modification, I used agave instead of sugar, and wheat flour , but tey are awesome! A tad salty , I like them that way, but if you don't like that decrease salt to half. I did not refridgerate, did not grease pan and did not use the sugar fork method. I just rolled them into balls then flattened slightly. They don't spread much so you can load up the baking sheet.When te time is up the ARE DONE. Even if you don't think they are, they ARE. Trust me...if you want them soft, pull them out at 8 minutes! Even this healthier version is great!"
"1","5","I'm a bad cookie maker. They hardly Ever turn out right. Until these!! These are truly the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had, much less made! The only changes I made were to use white whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, and I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. After making the batter (which I did not refrigerate) I divided it into 4 parts...one part I added semi-sweet chocolate chips (@ 1/2 to 3/4 cup), the second part I added craisins and dried unsweetened coconut, the third craisins and pecans, the fourth butterscotch chips and pecans. After scooping them I did roll them into balls and squished them a little with my hands before putting on the parchment paper. I baked them 2 batches at a time for approx 9 minutes, and let them cool on the pan for 5 min before removing to a cooling rack. This recipe made 4 dozen for me. The husband doesn't like oats, so my 2 little ones and I will have to finish these off ourselves. Terrible I know. Wonderful recipe...my new go to oatmeal cookie recipe. Thank you for sharing!!"
"1","5","I just tried this recipe tonight, and the cookies turned out really yummy. I made them a little fancier by adding cranberries instead of rasins and walnuts. I will definitely make this cookies again. -Gracie"
"1","5","A huge hit! I had to bake it three days in a row cause my family kept finishing it. The best cookies I baked so far, buttery, healthy and really tasty. I highly recommend it. Taghrid"
"1","5","This is an awesome recipe! I didn't have vanilla extract, and i used about a cup of oil instead of butter. Al so, i added chocolate chips. I mixed everything as instructed and baked on 375. They came out, Really moist and a bit chewy. Soooo good! I will be keeping this recipe!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly but did not do the addition sugar on a fork. I also divided the batter and added raisins and chocolate chips. I was unsure of these at first. I never made oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip are always my go-to. Any c.c. cookie lover knows that c.c. cookies are best right out of the oven...well...I tried one of these oatmeal cookies out of the oven and thought it was bland and flavorless. I let them cool on a wire rack and tried one a few hours later.....still bland, still flavorless and this time...HARD. I figured it's a cookie and my kids will enjoy them for school so I packed them up in a AIR TIGHT tupperware container and called it a day. I gave them each one in their lunch the next day and they were raving about them inquiring how on earth I made them. Puzzled, I told them it was easy and that they could actually make them by themselves (they are 6 and 8) and spouted off the ingredients since it was that easy and simple to recall them. I then went to the pantry and tried one and oh my goodness...these cookies are AMAZING!! They softened right up in the container and the cinnamon and other flavors just brewed so nicely over night. My kids love all kinds of chocolate but they both prefer the raisins in this oatmeal cookie. I will be making these again soon and may add some M&Ms, peanuts, cranberries or whatever else tickles my fancy. Thanks so much!!"
"1","5","great recipe! i divided my dough into two batches. I mixed one with 1/3 cup walnuts and the other with chopped chocolate and I must say, both were really great. I used a little less cinnamon (about 1 tsp) though because I didn't like the taste of it. I also cut my white sugar down to 1/2 cup. Despite all these cut downs, the final product still tasted really delicious!"
"1","5","I've made these cookies a lot, and a huge hit in our house. The secret to a soft cookie is take out early. I take them out of the oven when the center of the cookie still looks raw."
"1","3","Recipe good, but was the exact recipe on the back of my generic quick oats container."
"1","3","I tried this recipe and I don't know if it was me, the oven, or just the recipe, but it didn't seem to bake right."
"1","5","Delicious! I added chocolate chips and walnuts for a bigger treat!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe! I've been on the hunt for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and this one fits the bill. It's a great versatile base from which you can add dried fruit, chocolate, or even other spices. Some of the issues that others described sound more like issues with technique rather than issues with the actual recipe; others could just be flukes. If your basics are covered (I.e. butter is softened, not too melted or too cold, butter and sugars are creamed for around 2 minutes, etc.) they should turn out well for you :)"
"1","3","They tasted good but came out dry and had way too much oatmeal."
"1","5","This cookie recipe is awesome ... i serve them everytime we have guests"
"1","3","Making this recipe was quick, but the mix crumbled so much, I had to throw away most of it. I would advise using less oatmeal and a little more vanilla or butter. Although a crumbly mix, it does taste good!"
"1","5","this recipe is delicious! ( I do not know if I spelled that right) I tried it, I made it for me and my sisters and they ate so much, not the only problem is that we cannot stop eating them... haha bye bye diet!"
"1","5","best oatmeal cookie (non-healthy version) that I have found. made as described. don't overbake!"
"1","4","I thought these were good. I changed the spice blend a little - 1 tsp cin, 1/4 tsp ground clove, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Baked for 8 minutes. Added about 1/3 cup mini m&ms. I also skipped the refrigerating and flattening steps. They came out nice and soft, as promised. Very yummy!"
"1","5","Turned out great! I used parchment paper as I do with all cookies and it was the perfect oatmeal cookie(with raisins)."
"1","5","Used only the brown sugar. Sweet enough. Added a bit of olive oil for moisture, added raisins, substituted 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for cinnamon, added a tablespoon of peanut butter. Yum!"
"1","5","Amazingly simple and tasty recipe. Followed recipe to the 'T' with the exception of adding raisins. The cookies turned out as promised: Moist & Chewy with a slightly crunchy outside. Only thing that is a minor deterrent is it's a bit more time consuming than a mix and toss in the oven. I failed to see the part about letting the dough rest for at least an hour and was in a hurry to throw together a quick snack for my boys before they got home so needless to say my guys had to wait an extra hour but it was well worth it. They said that these cookies were the best oatmeal raisin cookies they'd ever had. Highly recommend! :-)"
"1","4","these were good, the second batch turned out better because I made them bigger cookies. I also added soaked raisins and didn't smash them down before baking. P.s. I skipped chilling the dough, it was thick enough to form balls without that extra step."
"1","2","too sweet for us."
"1","2","Way too much flour. Cut it back a cup, drop one of the eggs, and lose a cup of oats, then you've got a good cookie."
"1","5","i love these cookies .. they are soft and chewy. My kids are in love with it and they couldn't stop eating. very easy recipe and a great result.. thanks"
"1","5","I think this is a perfect recipe to do with te kids in a weekend! They really enjoyed it"
"1","5","Well, I don't often write reviews on recipes but these cookies are so delicious I thought I may share what I did when I made them! First of all, we didn't need two dozen so I changed the servings to 12 instead of 24. I like raisins in my oatmeal cookies and also love walnuts in cookies so I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of walnuts to the mix. I did refrigerate the dough for an hour as it does make it much easier to roll the dough into balls. Now, the recipe says to roll the dough into balls the size of a walnut, which I did, keeping them all a consistent size. I ended up with 41 cookies! Perhaps adding the raisins and walnuts created more volume but I wouldn't have thought it would add that much more volume! Because we had so many, I froze two dozen and let me tell you, these cookies are the tastiest cookies I have ever had! Right out of the freezer too! Delicious! Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe! This will certainly be my go-to recipe for oatmeal cookies from now on!"
"1","4","I added Heath Toffee Pieces and it was Fabulous!!"
"1","4","Good cookies! I added chopped dates. Don't forget to grease the pan, like I did."
"1","5","Delish!! Used about 3/4 cup sugar and was plenty sweet enough. Next time I'll substitute apple sauce for half of the butter and use just a half cup of sugar to get rid of some more of those calories :)"
"1","5","These cookies were fantastic! I did it just a little different. I reduced the salt by more than half, I added a large handful of coconut and about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. I also only did 1 tsp of cinnamon and added about 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp of allspice:) I did not let them sit for an hour in the fridge before, I did however leave my dough on my patio in between batches..because its Canada LOL One last thing..I found that using a fork to flatten them helped because they did not flatten easy. I skipped the extra sugar on top though! Made about 45 cookies!"
"1","5","Good flavor."
"1","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie I've tried. I added golden or yellow raisins instead and soooo yummy!!!"
"1","4","Tasted pretty good. Made a few of my own alterations, but overall pretty tasty!"
"1","4","These were very good and easy to make! I didn't cook them all the way; this left them nice and soft in the middle, while the edges had a nice crispness to them!"
"1","1","I don't know what happened, but these were not that good. Dense, not very sweet, bland."
"1","5","The best oatmeal cookies ever did not change a thing! I did bake on parchment paper with no grease!"
"1","5","These were delicious! Just perfect combination of soft but not cake like...still had some of the soft 'crunchiness' of the oatmeal. I did cut the sugar in half, so 1/2 cup per type of sugar and added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. It was still pretty sweet...I think it would still be sweet enough without the chocolate chips. I also used 3/4 cup of canola oil instead of 1 cup of butter to make it a bit more heart healthy. And used 1.5 cups of wholewheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour. I rolled the dough into a 2'x2' log inside a piece of parchment paper, chilled in the fridge for an hr then sliced into 24 pieces. It was the perfect thickness, just had to place them on the sheet, no need to flatten. I cooked them for 8 mins which was a bit undercooked but that made them soft and how I like my cookies. Will definitely be making this again and again as my hubby is an oatmeal cookie lover."
"1","2","SOFT??? Mine were harder than a ROCK.............."
"1","5","Last tray of these is in the oven now. I cut the recipe by half and added about 1/2 cup of raisins. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! My hubby and I scarfed them. 1/2 the recipe makes about 30 cookies for me. The first dozen will be gone before the last six are even done. This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever had. It's definitely going in my regular cookie rotation."
"1","5","These are just what I was looking for. I did not flatten the cookies, just baked the balls. They flattened out some during baking, but not too much. Very good flavor-my husband says they are addicting. I like the texture of the oats, but still find the cookie to be quite moist. This recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","Turned out great. Subbed half dark brown sugar for light to boost flavor. Reduced sugar to 3/4 c. Pressed down lightly without sugar and cooked for 8 min till still slightly undercooked. Used regular oats instead of quick cooking making for a nice chewy texture.Made 3 variations with one dough (raisin, chocolate chip, and cranberry white chocolate.)"
"1","5","These oatmeal cookies are fantastic! Contrary to other reviews, they ARE very moist :) I like adding dried fruits/nuts to mine and use a glass dipped in sugar to flatten them (but only to about 1/2in.). I don't think using the extra sugar when flattening is necessary, but does add a nice touch to the cookies! For those who may not be getting cookies quite as soft as they would like, just a little tip... make sure you are using REAL butter!!! Margarine is NOT good for baking (unless specifically called for in rare circumstances)! ;)"
"1","5","My entire family loved these cookies. They said that they were the best cookies I've made yet and I must agree with them. Very easy to make. I left them in the oven for about 9-10 minutes and they came out extremely soft, moist and didn't fall apart. I used 'Bob's Red Mill' gluten free old fashioned rolled oats. This recipe made nearly 3 dozen cookies. I let them cool on the cookie sheet as directed and then transferred them directly to my pub table on some parchment paper. All of the cookies were gone within 2 days."
"1","4","Over all this was a very successful recipe! I added 1 cup choc chips and cut the cinnamon down to 1 teaspoon. 1 Teaspoon cinnamon was perfect, but I would add more choc chips. The total amount should be somewhere between 1.5-2 cups. Thank you for sharing such a solid recipe! Delicious!"
"1","5","The cookies were very flavorful and they stayed Moist and Soft For nearly a week and a half, Thank you very much for this recipe, My wife and children LOVED these!"
"1","5","Absolutely amazing. These are the kind of cookies that are going in my family's special recipe collection. I was craving those Grandma's Iced Oatmeal cookies (the crunchy ones at the store) so I used this recipe to recreate them and they turned out amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, although I added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and clove to add a hint of spice, and 1/2 cup of nuts for some crunch. Flattened them (these don't spread, and I didn't chill them either) and baked at 375 for 12 minutes. They were thick, crunchy and absolutely delicious. I iced half of them with a vanilla icing which made them that much better, although the plain ones were equally as delicious!"
"1","1","I followed the recipe exactly, the cookies were not soft or chewy. They were hard and had very little flavour."
"1","5","Whenever a recipe calls for cinnamon and/or vanilla I ALWAYS add more :). I thought the recipe was easy & yummy!"
"1","5","So easy and delicious. I had all the ingredients on hand (that never happens for me). My 3-year-old loved helping -- her favorite part was rolling them into balls. We didn't flatten them and they took a little longer to bake (about 14 minutes), but they came out delicious. We also added raisins."
"1","5","These are the BEST cookies and are probably my favorite, even over the classic, Chocolate Chip! I modify the recipe by adding only 1/2 cup of Sugar as I find that to be plenty. I don't do the 'fork thing', either. I let them chill while I'm cleaning up the dishes, so only about 20 minutes, and that works just fine to make them a little firmer. I roll them into balls using my hands, and they bake into thick, soft, moist cookies. My biggest piece of advice is to really watch them and DON'T let them overcook - I often let them undercook a bit - or they won't be moist. Great recipe!!"
"1","5","sooooo good!"
"1","5","READ THIS TO LEARN MY SECRET! I use recipies as inspiration and then substitute! Used half the butter, the rest no sugar applesauce. Used half the brown sugar. Used no white sugar, substituted with 1/3 cup Truvia (sugar substitute). Used 2 tsp vanilla. Substituted 1 TB of apple pie spice for the cinn.(This was my 'secret'!) Added 1 cup of chopped apples, 1 cup raisins, 1 cup walnuts. Just scooped onto cookie sheet without rolling in a ball or flattening. 12 min 350 deg."
"1","3","They cooked a little strange, but the flavor was good. I added cranberries and raisins to spice it up. Make sure to space them out a lot and be sure to chill the dough for a while before baking, because they will run everywhere into one big cookie! that is sketchy and they don't look as good when you have to cut them."
"1","5","This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. Very easy, you do not need to refrigerate in my opinion. I don't bother with the sugar and fork either. I just make them like regular drop cookies, adding a cup of raisins as suggested. The cookies come out so nice, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. I guess I make mine smaller because I get 4 dozen from a batch."
"1","5","I have never liked oatmeal cookies, but for some reason I had the urge to make them. These were amazing! I now love oatmeal cookies as long as they're these ones. I followed the recipe almost entirely, but I added a small amount (maybe 1/3 cup) of yogurt covered raisins and apple chips (both cut up very small) from some apple cinnamon trail mix I had. I know they would have been fantastic without the changes though. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","they are most perfect cookies!! they have the best flavor and texture!! but they are not soft at all.... they are crispy but somehow moist and chunky... I used 2 cups of white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar and they turned out great... also DO NOT forget to grease the cookie sheets!! because they get really stuck in the cookie sheets if you don't. I will really save this in my favorites list!"
"1","5","Very soft and chewy. I added 1 cup of raisins. I will definitely make these again, my daughter loved them!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe; simple to follow even for inexperienced cooks / bakers, and easy to change around by adding chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, coconut (shredded) for a few examples. Made these for my neighbours and had to do 2 more batches. Everyone loved them!!"
"1","5","Bittersweet1, I have hated oatmeal all my life. My husband loves it. I made your recipe just for him and wound up eating most of the batch. You converted me! These cookies are moist, sweet and delightful. Thank you! (I added plumped raisins and look forward to adding pecans or walnuts next time.)"
"1","5","Cookie perfection! Instead of 3 cups of oats, I used 2 cups of SPELT flakes and 1 cup of oats. I didn't dip the fork in sugar, simply made drop cookies and the dough did not need to sit in the fridge. Absolutely to die for! So chewy and soft. Couldn't stop eating these and the kids raved about the delicious taste. A definite winner."
"1","4","Delicious!"
"1","5","These were delicious!!! I threw in about a cup of raisins. I had to cook mine closer to 12 minutes and I think I may add more cinnamon next time, but overall, they were by far the best oatmeal cookies I ever made."
"1","5","Yum yum yum!!!!! Followed recipe exact, just did not push them down with a fork! Super soft!!!! Will make again."
"1","5","we did not leave in a cool place for an hour they are great we did take out just a little early"
"1","5","These were delicious! I had the hankering for something sweet but 'healthy' so I set to work finding a good oatmeal cookie recipe. This was easy and packed full of flavor. I cut the recipe down to a dozen which lasted all of two hours in my house before my husband my kids and I had gobbled down the entire batch. Then of course is the question, 'So mom, are you going to make any more?' haha ;) Awesome cookies! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","I grew up making oatmeal cookies that flew off the tray, and these might be even better! I made them exactly as written, and was not disappointed. My family gobbled these up and requested I make them again two days later. Looks like I'm off to the store to buy more oatmeal!"
"1","5","These are perfect cookies...made twice. First time,I followed the recipe,they turned out delicious and second time as my hubby wants to eat these same cookies with less sugar,i took out 1/4 cup of white as well as brown sugar and add 4 to 5 table spoons of milk..even this time these cookies came out great ...crunchy and little salty than sugary..thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Perfect cookie. I soaked raisins and dried cranberries in water and added them to the cookie dough at the end. No nuts. Outstanding"
"1","5","A wonderful, some may say basic recipe but I have been trying to find a recipe to duplicate my husbands Mother's recipe for 30 years now! I found it! I add raisins (as did Mom) but I use organic very plump sweet Thompson raisins and they make all the difference when adding raisins to this great recipe.  I make several batches at a time using a Kitchen Aid mixer, makes it so much easier and faster and then I roll them in to a cylinder shape much like the already made cookie dough you find at the market that you would slice and bake. Then I seal them and freeze. When my family wants cookies I simple take one out , defrost slice and bake. Easy and good!"
"1","4","These cookies are amazing! I love soft cookies and these were def. that! I took them out somewhat early just to make sure they stayed soft after cooling but even crunchy, these cookies were a delight!"
"1","5","great recipe, thank you!"
"1","5","A great basic oatmeal cookie recipe... I made mine without any additions... if you do add something sweet such as raisins or chocolate chips I would definitely recommend cutting back on the sugar... also I don't think it is necessary to flatten these I did mine both ways and the ones I didn't flatten spread just about perfect while the flattened ones got a little thin... I used rolled oats because that is what I had on hand... I am sure it would taste great with the addition of nuts or raisins as well..."
"1","5","WOW! This is a definite winner! I can't make enough of these. The whole entire family absolutely LOVE these cookies. What a great recipe!!"
"1","5","This recipe is superb. Will definitely be making it again."
"1","5","I added 1/2 cup of coconut and they were delicious!"
"1","5","These cookies were delicious. My boyfriend especially liked them. They came on the flat side but they were very chewy and delicious."
"1","5","I have made many oatmeal cookies but none as good as these. I followed the recipe exactly except I halved it and got about 16 good size cookies. I just rolled them into balls did not bother pressing flat and they spread perfectly."
"1","5","I only had enough oats for 2 cups...so instead of the full batch, I revised it for 16 servings, and it was perfect! For the 1 1/4 cup eggs, I just put 2 small eggs in. They are so yummy!! Next time, I'll be sure to have enough oats to make a full batch. Going to try peanut butter instead of butter too, with chocolate chips!  SO....2 days later I made these again! Full recipe this time! I halved the recipe so that I could add dried blueberries to one batch and butterscotch chips to the other half. FANTASTIC!! Oh, and you DO want to wait about 5 minutes to take them off the pan...you'll fight with them and they will crumble to pieces as you try to pry them off the pan right out of the oven. It was like they were burnt and stuck to the pan, so I left them for a bit, and wellah! They came off easily & perfect condition! SUPER SUPER RECIPE!! Will be passing this one to the kids/grandkids! ~Thanks!"
"1","5","Sooooo Good!!! Came out perfect! The texture was perfect and I substitued the baking soda for baking powder. Will definitely be making this recipe a staple in my kitchen ;-)"
"1","5","My husband and I loved these cookies. I didn´t use white sugar, but still It was a very good recipe. Thanks"
"1","5","Very delicious cookies. I recommend leaving them in balls and not pressing them down, that will definitely help keep them soft and chewy. Also, I omitted pressing them down with a fork dipped in sugar, the recipe for my liking has enough sugar already! Also I found that they only need to bake for 8-9 minutes tops depending on your oven of course. Enjoy, I know myself, family, and friends did!"
"1","5","There is a reason this recipe has so many stars. Its really a good one."
"1","5","I followed the recipe and recived rave reviews at work. Can not believe some people haven't ever had these with out raisens. Very tasty thanks."
"1","5","I lost my recipe for Rolls Royce Oatmeal cookies 20 years ago, and have been looking for an acceptable substitute for a long time. This recipe comes the closest to it than any I have ever found. I suggest you follow the baking times and temperature precisely - I bake my cookies for only eight (8) minutes, and they come out perfect every time - warm, soft, chewy and with a terriffic flavor.  Kudos to the nice person who provided this recipe - it is now part of my recipe collection that I will be handing down to my children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.  Your recipe will now be part of our lives forever.  Thank you very much!"
"1","5","Got a ton of compliments on this recipe, perfect just as it!"
"1","5","Great recipe - love it using half a cup of nuts (any seem to work) this has become my families favourite!!"
"1","4","best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried- when I add raisins I soak them in hot water for about 10 minutes and then drain well before adding them- this keeps the raisins nice and soft. I use this base oatmeal cookie recipe now for all kinds of cookies- adding chocolate chips, nuts, cranberries or whatever else I have handy. Although I do use a touch less sugar just because I don't like my cookies quite as sweet. I also may use a little less oatmeal if I'm going to be putting alot of other stuff in. I've also found you can use whole wheat flour and it works well too."
"1","5","Delish!!! I'm giving this cookie 5 stars as is."
"1","5","BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever had or made. I don't bother chilling the dough, just drop onto the cookie sheet by the tablespoonful ... Makes nice big chewy cookies. Delicious."
"1","5","soft and perfect! will be using again!"
"1","5","These are by far the best oatmeal cookies I have ever eaten! Thanks!!!!"
"1","5","The best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried. I made a few changes. I used regular oats and added 1 tsp of nutmeg. I split the batter in half and added 3/4 cup of raisins to one half of the batter and dark chocolate chips with dried cranberries to the other half. Both types of cookies turned out fabulous."
"1","3","I agree with other reviewers, that these cookies are delicious, but not 'moist' as the recipe promises. You can definitely skip the sugar sprinkled on top if you make them according to the recipe, and no need to chill the dough. The second time I made these and added 1/4 cup of molasses and sprinkled sugar on top to counteract they bitterness--they came out much more chewy and moist."
"1","5","THANK YOU!!! What an awesome cookie! I've been searching forever for a 'go-to' oatmeal cookie and finally...! :) My husband couldn't wait for the 1 hr. chilling time-but they still turned out great. Years ago, I worked at a bakery and was taught to roll out the cookie dough into a thick log-then slice into 3/4' pieces-then bake. They turn out so uniform that way. If, like me, others couldn't wait for the 'chillin' time', the flatter ones make awesome ice cream sandwiches. Just put a dollop of ice cream between two cookies, wrap in foil and freeze. Next time will put in fridge for the hour to get them thicker-but for taste, these can't be beat. (I can't tell you how many recipes I've gone through!) Thanks again!"
"1","5","These cookies are just great. I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening, only because I had but one stick of butter left in my fridge (I did my shopping after putting the dough together). I kept the rest of the recipe the same. I divided the dough in half and made one batch with dark and golden raisins (soaked in warm water, drained) and the other with dried cranberries (also soaked and drained) and some chopped walnuts. The cookies baked for exactly 10 min. and still came on nice and soft. Both varieties were delicious."
"1","5","These are the best Oatmeal cookies We have ever made. We added chopped dried cranberries and it was delicious. We did not flatten the cookie, when we take them out of the over we lightly drop the pan on the counter, it makes them perfect"
"1","4","fast and easy...yum!"
"1","5","I made these, it was my first cookie i made ever and I loved it. So did everyone. Great recipe"
"1","5","excellent..been hunting for years and this is perfect. DONT overbake. i add 1/4 cup molasses yum!!"
"1","5","Quick Tip: do not leave them more then ten minutes they might not look cooked but if you can see a light golden brown color on them then trust me they're ready! I made this mistake the first time i made these and they burnt. Also leave them to cool a little before taking off cookie sheet because they will be a bit soft. I also added a few m&m's on top for color :)"
"1","5","Simple and delicious. Everything a good cookie should be."
"1","4","This is so far the best recipe for oatmeal cookies I've found. I made a half batch and so far, they're perfect! I tweaked a little for altitude (5000 ft) by taking out a pinch of baking soda. I also doubled the vanilla and added a little vanilla powder to the flour mixture to replace the soda and up the flavor. I also added about 3/4 butterscotch chips to make oatmeal scotchies.   This will be my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe for now. I can only give it 4 stars because it calls for quick cooking oats instead of plain rolled oats. I had to compensate by chopping up half my oats with a knife."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. I think next time I may add some diced apple. My husband hates Oatmeal cookies and he loves these."
"1","5","I adore this oatmeal cookie! I thought everything about them was perfect. I followed the ingredients exactly but I did do a few things differently. I ended up leaving the batter in the fridge overnight (but only because I ended up not having the time to bake them)I never added the sugar when pressing your cookie down, but the best thing I did was take 2 cookies, put a HUGE scoop of ice-cream between them and had the best icecream sandwhich EVER!! We tried one right after the cookies cooled, but the best way was to freeze the whole sandwhich. I made these cookies last week, & I'm now making them again, as I type the batter is in the fridge! Thank you for the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried yet! :)"
"1","5","I only bake 8 min bc I like all my cookies soft and chewy best! This was my first time baking oatmeal cookies, and I wanted to compare to a generic recipe on my oatmeal box; so, I did a batch of this recipe and a batch of generic. This one was definitely the better one! :) Next time I'll experiment with raisens! Thanks for sharing this recipe! 2/27/12 I've been tasting between the two recipes, and find this one a bit too sweet; next time I would put in only 1 tsp of cinnamon and maybe cut the salt slightly..and then adjust sugars in following trials."
"1","5","This recipe was delicious moist and crisp on the outside. I used old fashion oats and unsalted butter and I also separated the dough and added ghirardelli chocolate chips to one batch, raisins to another and left one part plain. My boys loved them. This recipe is a definite keeper."
"1","5","These are fabulous! I tried to healthy them up a bit my substituting 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and you can't tell at all, even my kids love them! I left some plain, and then mixed in dried fruit, raisins and chocolate chips for a variety. Will definately make these again! Thanks!"
"1","5","Awesome cookies! I was never a fan of oatmeal cookies until these. The only modifications I made were that I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, didn't chill the dough and I didn't flatten them, I just flattened them slightly with my hand after I rolled them, and they came out great. 10 min was perfect for me. I actually iced half of them (husband's request) and left the others plain. For the icing I just used powdered sugar and milk, and they were great both ways. I didn't find them too sweet at all, even with the icing, and they're still soft after 4 days. This is a recipe I will keep and make often. Thanks!"
"1","4","I love these cookies! I gave 4 stars because of my changes but feel the end result is 5 stars. I use rolled oats not quick oats. I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 white. As I don't like cookies too sweet and I always add other sweet extras such as choc chips or raisins, I only add the cup of brown sugar and omit the white sugar altogether.  I make one batch which I prefer with raisins, crumbed walnuts, cinnamon and allspice the other batch my husband prefers with milk choc chips and I omit the cinnamon. I've also made them with white choc chips and dried blueberries but didn't like these as much although they were still eaten very quickly. Don't over bake and they are moist and stay that way for days in a plastic container. The dough freezes well as individual cookies put in a freezer bag as previously suggested to make fresh cookies whenever you feel like it."
"1","5","In less than 3 days, I have made two batches of these cookies adding 1 cup each of semi sweet chocolate chips and chopped pecans. They have disappeared with in 24 hours of baking. This is the PERFECT cookie recipe!"
"1","5","Simple to make turned out great. Family loves them."
"1","4","This was pretty darn good, but on the sweet side..Wish there was a way to cut down the sugar for those who don't like it so sweet."
"1","4","Delicious and i made these in less than 2 hours. I did not need to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour. I put them straight into the oven. I did not dip the cookies in sugar either. The most important thing is that they came out real chewy. Depending on how you like your cookies. For a chewy cookies, it can be less than 11 min in the oven. Good recipe!"
"1","5","These cookies are awesome! I did the recipe just as it says, but then I added some raisens, nuts, and chocolate chips and then turned out wonderful."
"1","5","Made these cookies today and my husband loves them. will be a favorite of our family for years to come!!!!!"
"1","5","Awesome cookies! My son loved these. Very easy to make and they taste wonderful! Did not flatten with a fork before baking and they were fine! Added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts!"
"1","5","These cookies were soft and delicious. I made them different times using chocolate chips, craisins and raisins...delicious every time. I did not chill the dough or use a fork to flatten and they still turned out great. Thank you for this recipe."
"1","4","These cookies were a hit with the kids. They came out soft amd tasty."
"1","5","Delicious. The whole family loved how chewy and how flavorful these astonishing cookies!!"
"1","5","Awesome! I didn't have eggs so I subbed 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt- delish! This actually makes 48 2' cookies so you could definitely half it if needed. Quick and good cookie fix recipe."
"1","5","get the timing right and these are perfect"
"1","5","This is the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe! I add 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup of chopped walnuts and they are delicious! Don't refrigerate the dough or you'll end up with burnt cookies! Also don't squish them down or they'll end up not chewy or soft."
"1","5","I usually use the Quaker oatmeal recipe they have on their lid of the oatmeal container. This recipe is so much better! I'm hooked!"
"1","2","These were soft (I did not flatten with a fork), but pretty flavorless cookies. Need more brown sugar and cinnamon. Disappointed, especially since I doubled the recipe!"
"1","5","I loved it! I added pecans and chocolate chips in half and pecans and butterscotch chips in the other half."
"1","5","Very yummy. I didn't refrigerate cookie dough and they came out perfect. Will be making these again!"
"1","5","This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe...the recipe that others ask me for after trying the cookies. They are perfect--soft and nicely spiced. I make them exactly according to the recipe. Some of my taste-testers layered these with cream cheese frosting to make whoopie pies."
"1","4","Pretty good- tastes like an oatmeal cookie. Recipe doesn't deviate too much from a standard oatmeal cookie recipe-slightly more flour and sugar. I'm not sure if I could tell the difference in a blind taste test from this and a Quaker Oats recipe, assuming they are baked correctly. this one may taste a little sweeter. I would use this again and found nothing wrong with it- it just didn't 'wow' me enough for 5 stars."
"1","5","Excellent, tasty, soft, easy to make! I used pumpkin spice mix since I was out of cinnamon and they still taste great!"
"1","5","I needed a quick and easy 'Santa' cookie recipe, and this was PERFECT. From start to finish they took me one hour to deliver moist, delicious oatmeal cookies. For those people who use Victorian Epicure spices, I substituted the cinnamon for Poudre Douce (same amounts) and the results are fantastic. Thank you for saving the day!"
"1","5","These cookies were great! They were soft even after a week they still hold up to their name. I found them to be a bit too sweet for my liking so I reduced the amount of white sugar to half a cup instead of the whole cup. I added raisins and walnut pieces and my kids gobbled them up. This recipe is a keeper."
"1","3","these cookies are not soft"
"1","5","Excellent! Added 1 tsp extra vanilla and the vanilla I used was double strength vanilla. Cookies in a tin retained their flavor four days later."
"1","5","Love these. They are soft and moist and just plain delicious. I add milk chocolate chips occasionaly just for a little something sweeter. They never last more than a couple of days around our house. Just too good."
"1","5","I just tried this recipe over the weekend and it was SO easy! Anyone could do it! I added crasins to it and everyone gobbled them up! So delicious."
"1","4","These are wonderful if you follow the advice of those who said cut out a half a cup of oats so they stay moist. I put raisins in a batch and they were very tasty. Even my son who is not a raisin fan loved them."
"1","5","Made the recipe exactly how it says the 1st time & found that, sugar forking makes the cookies too sweet (but it was still a big hit). 2nd time without the sugar forking was a charm!!! It's a huge hit!!! The kids & adults love it!!   I've even added crushed pecans, made some with walnuts, and my favorite was ones I made with pecans, semi-sweet chocolate morsels & Angel Flake Coconut sweetened!!! Delish!!  By the way, I've only used Great Value 100% Whole Grain Quick Oats!!  This is one recipe that will remain in my families kitchen for years to come! Thank You!!!"
"1","5","I'm a novice baker but I had an easy time baking these cookies. And not only that, they turned out delicious! My boyfriend and his family couldn't stop eating them. I even made them for my students and a bunch if them wanted seconds. I'm not even a oatmeal cookie person but this recipe changed my mind."
"1","5","Very good! I used old fashioned oats, and didn't crush the cookies. They would have been thinner and not as soft. My husband ate like 20 of them, and I had to make him not eat the rest. LOL!"
"1","5","I am currently baking these cookies, we've eaten 4 of them soon as they cooled, not sure I can keep the guys from finishing them off before I'm done cooking them all. Made recipe as written for the first time, winner recipe for sure. The 2 dozen it says I am not sure about, I'm making them about 3 inches across and am on #43 with about 2 cups of mix still to bake. Used real butter and did not place mix in fridge, just started baking. Added raisins to the mix, about a 1/2 cup(?), just eye-balled them. Will make these again!"
"1","5","Fantastic little cookie! I just finished making them and they are just wonderful! I did not make any changes! They are perfect just as they are! Thank you!!"
"1","5","My new favorite cookie! Whole family loves them! Thank You!"
"1","5","First time making oatmeal cookies, they came out really good. After I tasted the first batch, I thought they needed something else so I added some cinnamon sugar to the tops of the individual cookies after I placed them on the cookie sheet, and they tasted better. They are soft & chewy which is what I like, so they were perfect. I also found that 11 minutes was the perfect time to cook in my oven. Will definitely make these again & again."
"1","5","These are great. I added a little more cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I also refrigerated mine for 2 days prior to baking because of my work schedule. Next time I am going to roll it into a log before refrigerating that long because it was a little crumbly and harder to roll into ball. Great taste though and mine weren't too moist but undercooking a few minutes helped keep them a little bit softer."
"1","5","These are wonderful! Soft inside and a little crisper on outside. I was out of vanilla so used about a Tbsp of Honey. I was surprised they turned out as well since the dough was a little harder than most cookies but they really turned out great."
"1","4","I did as others said and didn't refrigerate I just used my cookie scoop and cooked them right away without pressing down, I would not recommend not pressing them down. My cookies would not fully bake. On the 4th pan I decided to press them down to see if it made a difference and it definately did. Also they were a bit salty so next time I would omit 1/4 of the salt. Otherwise they have a great flavor and I will be trying them again."
"1","4","Very tasty! I added 1 C fresh cranberries cut in halves for an extra kick. Didn't press down and baked an extra 2 minutes using air bake pans."
"1","3","Wow, I must be pretty stupid. I put cornmeal, thinking it was flour in my cookies! Man!"
"1","5","DELISH!! I started making these cookies last night, when I decided I was ready for bed =), so I actually refridgerated the cookie dough over night and baked them this morning.. They are VERY moist, soft n chewy.. I cooked them between 8-9mins.. This is my 1st time making oatmeal cookies and I love them, I will for sure be making these again! Thankyou for sharing the recipe! Xoxo"
"1","5","Fantastic cookie! I added milk chocolate chips and my whole family loved them. Lightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. YUM! Thank-you for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","This recipe is reallly good. Soft and chewy all together. I did however change to 1/2 cup margerine and 1/2 cup shortening. They did not spead, and I took them out as soon as they turned golden brown."
"1","5","These were delicious! I added white chocolate chips to mine and after chilling in the fridge for a little over an hour I rolled the dough into small balls and baked. I will deff make these again"
"1","5","These are great! Don't overbake. These are soft and chewy with great flavor. I added 1 C. of raisins. Will definitely make these again."
"1","5","amazing cookies!! added shredded coconuts and raisins."
"1","5","Excellent recipe! Now a family favorite!"
"1","5","Yummmm!!! These taste like the cookies from my childhood!!! So easy to make! I personalized them by adding some dark chocolate and butterscotch chips."
"1","5","Great and easy. I thought I was adding plain chocolate chips and added mint chips instead - what a surprise - these were better then the raisin ones or subsequent ones that I have made with regular chocolate chips. I have also made with toffee chips. All are good but the ones that are plain or with the mint chips go the fastest. If you want chewy, which is what we love, do not overcook. Enjoy experimenting with different additions! Thanks for the recipe"
"1","5","WOW!! This cookie is phenominal! The best cookies that I have ever had. They were also a big hit with everyone else in the house."
"1","5","These were great! I halved the recipe and used 2T less butter (so 4T for the full recipe) and added 1 big spoonful of peanut butter (about 4T, so 8T for full recipe). After chilling, I added about 3oz mini chocolate chips. The peanut butter goes great with the heavy cinnamon in this recipe, but it is not so strong that you can pinpoint the flavor. I baked for 11 min and they are perfectly soft the next day, but please do enjoy one still warm!"
"1","5","Amazing after I had the dough mixed, i split it in half, and added raisins, the other half I made a cookie icing and iced theses cookies are delicious, with some other minor variations."
"1","5","Amazing! I did add 1/2 bag of chocolate chunks ... which makes everything better. But, even w/o, it would have been great. My roommate loves them too!"
"1","1","Listened to a few suggestions. I cut sugars down to 3/4 cup each. I also only used 1 tbsp. cinammon because I didn't want it to be overwhelming. I would consider cutting down the cinammon some more next time. It's still a bit sweet, but it's fine. I cooked mine for 10 minutes."
"1","5","These cookies are the BOMB!!!! I am proud to say this was my first batch of oatmeal cookies and my family loved them! I did make my own modifications, instead of butter I used coconut oil, and I added 1/4 cup of 1% milk! I also added raisins! Delicious is an understatement!"
"1","4","Had to cook a lot longer."
"1","5","Amazing, best oatmeal cookies I ever ate! They were so soft, moist, and had beautiful color. I did make some changes that were very slight. I use margarine instead of butter just what I had on hand and I added 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I also only chilled the cookie dough for 45 minutes and I didn't grease my cookie sheet I used parchment paper. I made very large cookies so my cooking time was about 15 minutes. They looked so gourmet, these cookies were very impressive to look at and amazing in flavor. I will be making these again and giving them as gift!"
"1","5","I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! It was so easy and it was easy to adjust to a healthier version. I used peanut oil (partly cause I was almost out of butter) for lower cholesterol and splenda instead of sugar, now I'm wishing I had omitted the eggs and used egg whites. Oh well, that means I'll have to make them again ;) Only bother was how stiff the dough was, had to use ALOT of elbow grease towards the end."
"1","5","OH MY GAWD!! TY so much for this recipe!!! I made them with 2 slight variations I found logical for my taste. I am a pastry chef and was just bored in the middle of the night so I wanted to try a recipe and I chose this one. Boy am I glad I did. I love love love this recipe!! My cookies came out absolutely perfect. I've been searching for the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe for a longggg time and finally I've found it. Perfection! Truely. Thanks again."
"1","4","I actually skipped putting vanilla in the batter&put in a whole 11 ounce bag of butterscotch chips. delicious! and it does need the a whole 12-15 minutes."
"1","4","I found that my cookies seemed to cakey. I will try again with less flour and maybe only two cups of oats. I enjoyed the flavor I just like a different texture."
"1","5","the best oatmeal cookies EVER!!!! The only thing I changed is I used one cup white flour and one cup whole wheat flour, I try to sneak it in when I can!!"
"1","5","These are awesome! I made a batch with dried blueberries (oceanspray) and some with whole pecans on top. I also added a dash of nutmeg too to round out the flavor. The chilling of the dough is very important to get and even bake! Also, if you are able to chill or at the very least keep the baking sheet cool till the last second that will help keep the dough from spreading and cooking unevenly. The first time I made as directed and loved it (5 stars). This time I added to aforementioned items and still loved it (5 stars). I always found oatmeal cookies underwhelming, but I actually prefer these to the 'Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies' recipe, which I so adamantly stood by for the longest time (which I got from this site) its still a good recipe, too. Try! I have tried raisins, chocolate chips, pecans and blueberries...all wonderful ways to change-up the cookie. Though, they are superb by themselves :-)"
"1","5","So good!!! I made these and my son and husband cannot get enough of them! Everyone that has them asks for the recipe! Absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","Very good cookie - easy & fast recipe! I made it as stated with no revisions & it was good. Refrigeration is definitely not needed; I made it as a drop cookie, they don't spread too much which I liked."
"1","5","I am very picky about by oatmeal cookies. this however was ACES! they were delish and easy to make. however, i realized from my own impatience that its imperative you refrigerate it for 1 hr at least! I makes all the difference! Thanks so much for sharing this with us!"
"1","5","So good, even my husband likes them and he does not eat oatmeal cookies. I added a splash of milk as the dough seemed dry. They came out perfect."
"1","5","These cookies were yummy! I did not change a thing in the original ingredients but I scooped out the dough instead of flattening with sugared fork. I added 1 cup of semi-sweet morsels. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. I would definitely make them again."
"1","5","amazing cookies"
"1","5","Great Cookie. I made these with my grandkids. Easy recipe to follow. Great taste. I let the kids use the small scoop and drop onto a cookie sheet. I will add this to my recipe box."
"1","5","Very moist and crumbly! These are by far the best oatmeal cookies in the world. After the balls of cookie dough were on the cookie sheet instead of flattening the balls with a fork I just left them the way they were and they turned out very thick and moist. I will never make any other cookie besides these. this is now my family's favorite cookie by far."
"1","4","If you follow the recipe to a T, you will get soft oatmeal cookies. I made a mistake by listening to some reviewers and did NOT flatten my first sheet of cookies, which left me with very round cookies that needed extra time to finish baking and turned out too brown outside just to be baked inside. The next sheet I did flatten (without the sugar coating, works just as well) and in exactly 8 minutes I had soft oatmeal cookies :)"
"1","5","Easy to make and tasted great! I added a pkg of craisins and a pkg of white chocolate chips. Very Yummy!!"
"1","5","I made these a while ago and they were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had. I will be making them again soon, but adding chocolate chips. I did chill, but did not flatten with a sugared fork--I just left them in balls. SO good!"
"1","5","I love this cookie recipe! My whole family does too. I will be making this again, soon!"
"1","5","I made a half batch. I added a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg for spice. I put vanilla icecream between them when they were still warm. VERY NICE Ü"
"1","5","These were great! I did use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur brand) and also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco to keep them from being too flat.  Made 1/3 with pomegranate craisins; 1/3 with chocolate yogurt covered raisisns and 1/2 wirh rum soaked raisins. I added an extra TBSP of flour to the portion with the run soaked raisins to soak up the extra moisture.  Baked only 7 min and I used the rollinto ball method. Made 61 cookies -   This is a keeper!"
"1","4","The cookies taste really great and I was very satisfied in finding such a simple recipe, but the cookies did come out a little funky."
"1","5","These cookies are fantastic! I added a cup of raisins and a half cup of walnuts...yum! I would suggest baking them for no more than 8 minutes, maybe even for 6-7 muinutes to keep them nice and soft."
"1","5","Soft and moist. I made it just like the recipe said and added some raisins for the last couple batches. They were great and soft!! I didn't put it in the fridge first, made the first batch then stuck it in the freezer while they baked and just kept it in the freezer in between batches. They came out perfectly."
"1","5","Fabulous cookie recipe! I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and I didn't bother flattening them down or adding additional sugar to the top. These are so soft and yummy. I've been wanting to try making oatmeal cookies for awhile and these do not disappoint!"
"1","4","This was a great recipe, however, I found that there was too much sugar. When I made this recipe, I cut it down to 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and it was still too sweet. Next time, I will cut the sugar down a little bit more. I also tried a variation - to one half of the mixture I added about a 1/2 cup of diced dried cranberries and a 1/2 cup of coconut; and to the other half I made plain oatmeal but then I melted down some semi-sweet and white chocolate and dipped the cooled cookies in one of the chocolates and then drizzled the other chocolate on top."
"1","5","I've never been a fan of oatmeal cookies until now. These were yummy. I made a batch with raisins, a batch without, and then today a batch with white chocolate chips. Every batch turned out great. I did add a touch more cinnamon to the plain ones, and a few drops more of the vanilla to all (I like vanilla). Make SURE that the butter is softened before you start and they will be wonderful."
"1","3","okay"
"1","5","These were awesome!! 1st time I made oatmeal cookies and they came out perfect and ohh so yummy, I used choc covered raisins."
"1","5","Very good. Only use brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 and it's still very sweet. I don't eat raisins but I like my cookies to have that nutty bite so I use wholewheat flour. Also I use 5 spice and ginger in place of plain cinnamon."
"1","5","These were outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly and then added half a bag of mini chocolate chips. I'll be honest, they seemed really stiff after I let them cool. I had to pry them off the pan, so I was very worried about them. However, the next day, they were SO soft and chewy. This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe that I've found."
"1","4","Good recipe but too sweet, and I can normally drink honey and molasses straight from the bottle! I did add some nuts and chips and raisins, but this only made them sweeter. Will find a different recipe."
"1","5","God I love these cookies! I like to add chocolate chips or m&ms to them. They are just so good!"
"1","3","These were good, not exactly soft, depends on the cooking time. I divided the batter into thirds. I added chocolate chips in one, peanut butter in second batch and raisins/cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger in the third. I did get 24 good sized cookies. This recipe is OK, normal. This recipe is equally as good as my friends oatmeal cookie recipe."
"1","5","perfect. even better with a pinch of nutmeg!"
"1","4","These turned out exactly as I hoped...soft but a little crispy. I added butterscotch chips (the whole bag makes the cookies really sweet but half a bag is just perfect to me). I didn't flatten them with the sugared fork since the chips add enough extra kick in the sweet department. Thanks for the recipe, Bittersweet1!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe. Did it twice already because my husband loves it!"
"1","5","Great cookies. I followed the ingredients perfectly, but I did not chill them and left them round. I baked them for a full 10 minutes at only 350 degrees and they turned out absolutely fantastic."
"1","5","Ok, these are incredible! I made the cookies exactly as written except I cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my son who like oatmeal cookies...that was until the other kids tasted them then Iwish I would've made the full amount. I did add to the half recipe 1/8tsp of ground cloves, and also to a few cookies I added some craisins. Very,very good, this is my new oatmeal cookie recipe!"
"1","5","Found this after the BF said that he had a craving for Oatmeal Cookies, he prefers soft ones. These were amazing!! Didn't change anything but I did add some chocolate/peanut butter chips to the last batch. BF loved these and we will be making these time and time again. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","I think this recipe was great. My cookies stayed soft and delicious. The only thing mine were missing was the raisins. Next time!"
"1","5","I have been making this recipe since 2006, when i discovered it here, and it is by far the best oatmeal cookie recipe ever."
"1","5","Great recipe. I will definitely try mixing it up with chocolate chips or nuts next time. We will be making these again!"
"1","4","Pretty darn good! I didn't give it five stars, because I only added 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white. I added extra cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp cloves, since I like a spicier oatmeal cookie. I also took others' advice and didn't chill them for an hour, just dropped by tablespoonful onto ungreased cookie sheets. None the less, this is a great basic cookie recipe - nice and soft and tasty!"
"1","5","YUM! These were so good! I added a bit more cinnamon, and kept my eye on the edges when I baked. I didn't smash them down or grease the baking sheet, but they turned out delicious!"
"1","4","Instead of butter I used margarine and canola oil. I didn't have lemon extract, so I threw in some Captain Morgan instead, and added a little honey. They were delicious! Really do need something else, though, along the lines of nuts, chocolate chips--my roommate suggested apple bits, we may try that."
"1","4","Good recipe well liked by all!"
"1","5","This was my first time making oatmeal cookies and they turned out wonderfull! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didnt have vanilla but they still had geat taste. Adding a handfull of raisins was a nice touch. Will make these again!"
"1","5","Just plain fantastic. Didn't need the sugar on top since they were already sweet enough, but I did flatten them. They were fantastic, soft and chewy, and easy to make."
"1","5","Very good! Decreased sugar to 1.5 cups and used all brown. Used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseed instead of all purpose. Increased baking soda to 1.5 teaspoons because whole wheat flour is heavier than white. Used 2 cups oatmeal and 1 cup oat bran. Added bittersweet chocolate chips and pecans to half the batter and coconut and craisins to the other half. Did not refrigerate dough or press with fork. All was great, cookies were soft inside (cooked 8 mins). Will definitely make again and will try subbing 1/2 of butter with sweet potato baby food (a much healthier substitution than apple sauce)."
"1","5","These cookies are the best! I can see these quickly becoming a family favorite! I divided the dough and baked some with butterscotch chips added and some without. Both are outstanding! Next time I'll try chocolate chips, dried cranberries and/or nuts just for fun."
"1","5","OH my goodness these are so good! Super easy to make too. I used slightly less oatmeal because the batter was so thick. Baked for about 8-9 minutes and they are soft and delicious!"
"1","5","My toddler and I used this recipe to help her increase her vocab skills, and it was a hit! My parents loves the cookies and so did my husband and step-son. Will make over and over and over again........."
"1","5","I made these cookies just like the recipe and they came out perfect and delicious. They are moist and chewy with a nice light crispy edge. I baked them at 375degrees for 9 minutes, just until they are a bit underdone and then let them sit on the pan for 2 minutes and removed. I split the dough into thirds and made plain, with raisins and with chocolate chips. Refrigerating the dough helps with even cooking and also helps blend the flavors. I did not press the cookies down because this step really isnt necessary. Before making ANY changes to this recipe I highly suggest you try it as is. I do not find them too sweet, they are perfect. If you follow the directions and dont make any changes then you will come out with the BEST oatmeal cookie. I used parchment paper because greasing the pan usually gives the cookies a dark bottom. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious! I planned on following the recipe exactly. But I started making it and realized I didn't have vanilla. So I added some nutmeg and honey to add flavor. Then I realized I had vanilla & caramel creamier in the fridge...so I added a few teaspoons of that to add vanilla flavor. The texture of these cookies are so good. I used 1 1/2 Tablespoon sized scoops and would have made about 32 cookies with this recipes. Cooked them for 9 minutes."
"1","5","Best oatmeal cookies I've had in a very long time! Moist and chewy!"
"1","5","These cookies were AWESOME!!!Very soft and chewy. My family loved them. My son is a very picky eater & he told me they were the best cookies in the world! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","Perfect oatmeal cookie. Just the texture I was hoping for. Added some butterscotch chips. Used the small pampered chef scooper and got 32 cookies from a half batch. Did not flatten down."
"1","5","A yummy, chewy cookie with crisp outsides! I found this recipe after my brother had started to make the Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies. He added everything except the flour, so I took over from there and just added flour, oats, cinnamon, and more sugar to the dough. I also added chocolate chips. Make like you would make chocolate chip cookies- drop by spoonfuls or form into balls and place on cookie sheets. They spread a bit, but don't get too flat. After 10 minutes, they might look undercooked, but once they cool they'll be chewy. It makes 48 cookies."
"1","5","These cookies are fantastic! They are simple to make and I usually have all the ingredients on hand which is nice. My boyfriend requested that I add some craisins..and they are delicious! Usually I bring half of all the goodies I make to work to share with everybody..but my boyfriend has stated that 'these cookies are staying here..no giving these ones out!'"
"1","5","Love and make every few weeks..love that they are soft"
"1","5","These cookies were very yummy! I didn't press them down at all, just dropped them on the cookie sheet as round balls, very moist and chewy!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Cut back the white sugar to just slightly less than 1/2 cup, otherwise followed ingredients list through the adding of the oatmeal. Did as some others described and made a third of the batch with golden raisins, another third with craisins and white chocolate chips and the final third with M&Ms. Big fan of the raisins and M&Ms. I think I'll try another type of combo instead of the craisins/white chocolate chips next time."
"1","5","These cookies are to die for!!! No need to refrigerate them before you put them in the oven. I added white chocolate chips to the recipe and it tasted great! Bake it for 7 minutes and they come out soft. Enjoy!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe. Have made this over and over again. Compliments from all."
"1","3","Not chewy. I think next time I'm going to try per suggestion of adding clove for 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. And don't press them. But my husband likes them and that's who I made them for.;)"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! I am living in Germany and my German wife fell in love with Pepperidge Farms soft baked oatmeal cookies while living in the US for a year. I myself, have always loved them. Unfortunately, they are unattainable here. Problem solved! I had forgotten what a real cookie tasted like...til now. Thanks!"
"1","4","I used shortening instead of butter. I did not chill the dough and I soaked raisins in the eggs for awhile to plump them before adding them to the sugar mixture. The dough was alittle crumbly but the taste is awesome!"
"1","5","The best ... perfect soft cookie! Added Ocean Spray Craisins and pecans. Have made them 3x in 2 weeks and they don't last but a few days. To keep moist, put a slice of bread in the cookie jar. Thanks soooo much!"
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies! I didnt have butter,I used Butter flavored crisco sticks instead! Turned out awesome!"
"1","5","These cookies are absolutely delicious. Great recipe and good cookie. People are always asking me to bake them. Absolutely delicious and easy to make"
"1","5","I used all organic turbinado sugar & whole wheat flour because that is what I had on hand. Added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder to compensate for the whole wheat flour. Added 1 cup of chocolate chips. I also used an ice cream scoop to put them on the baking sheet. They kept this nice round shape. So yummy! They were moist and cake-like."
"1","4","I loved these cookies and they were quickly devoured. I am saving this recipe!"
"1","5","We substituted wheat-free flours for the wheat flour, and they came out terrific following the timing advice regarding pulling them out right away. Thanks so much for sharing. We used the base recipe for cranberry-white chip and for 'cowboy cookies'."
"1","5","Can't wait to try this recipe. I will add pecans for a nice crunch. Thanks Bittersweet1 for sharing your cookie recipe with the world.  OMG! I made these tonight Dec. 29, 2010. I ate 4 coming out of the oven. These cookies are fantastic. Store bought cookies are now history."
"1","5","These cookies are fantastic! I made up a batch and they were gone that night. I made half a batch with chocolate chips and they were amazing. The only thing I did differently was not smash them with the fork, I just made drop cookies. They turned out great regardless."
"1","4","Fabulous these cookies are so easy the kids and I enjoyed baking them. easy and delicious."
"1","4","These taste like a great snickerdoodle cookie, not like an oatmeal cookie. Also following the directions for baking and these cookies are soft but flat. I didn't flatten out the cookies after the first pan and although they don't look done coming out of the oven, once they cool off they will be soft and chewy and thicker. If you want a chewy and thick cookie, don't flatten them."
"1","4","I omitted the cinnamon and added one cup dark chocolate chips. They were a big hit with kids and adults alike. 4 stars since I made revisions."
"1","5","The best! I added raisins, and these turned out soft and chewy and soooooo good."
"1","5","Very good. Can't wait to try with chocolate chips next time."
"1","5","These cookies were out of this world soft and chewy! My husand and friends all raved about how delish they were..they remided me of a really chewy store bought cookie. Too good to pass up and definitely a keeper of a recipe!"
"1","2","Easy to make and taste ok."
"1","5","I tried the recipe on the oatmeal box and they come out very cake like. My husband and I really enjoyoatmeal cookies so I decided to keep trying until I found something we both like and this is it! Excellent recipe and even better when you add your own thing to it such as raspberries or raisins, whatever you like."
"1","4","my cookies turned out great!! I did someting a little different, I used whole wheat and pastry flour. I also sifted them both. I added Raisins You really don't need to flaten with a fork. I tried both and they turned out yummy......"
"1","3","Pretty solid recipe, but I didn't think chilling the dough was necessary. I added chocolate and raisins."
"1","5","These were great!! Moist and soft, but not mushy! I didn't chill the hour recommended, only because I didn't read that part until the 1st batch was already baking. :) oops!"
"1","1","Flavor okay and flexible with adding own spices, but pressing the walnut size rolled ball not good. Also, mixing wet and dry difficult. Will try my own alterations till I get what I wanted."
"1","5","Wow. these are the best oatmeal cookies that i made in a long time. I made a few minor changes, using margerine (what i had) and i halved the recipe but used a full tsp of cinnamon a few dashes of cloves. The spices were perfect. I was alittle worried about the bake time but these babies are perfect. Crispy on the bottom an soft and chewy in the middle. No more frustation over the quaker oat recipe. Thanks!"
"1","5","The best, I will use the chilling of the dough for my next cookie recipe. Thanks"
"1","4","Mine were light and airy, and crunchy on the outside. Not very chewy. Maybe because I halved the recipe? They are definitely good, though."
"1","5","These were fantastic! I made these for my son and his friends for a road trip and they were lucky to get any! Even my son who hates oatmeal loved them :) Definitely a addition to my favorites!"
"1","5","All I have to say is, WOW! This is the way to go if you're looking for the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe."
"1","5","I make this recipe all of the time and everyone loves it! I like to add raisins, or toffee chips and use less sugar (1/4-1/2 less). I always get a soft cookie by leaving the dough in a ball and not pressing it down with a fork. With the timing, the cookies might not seem like they're done after 10 minutes (especially if you use 2 racks), just leave them in til the sides lightly brown. Enjoy, these cookies are deeeelightful!"
"1","5","I didn't change anything in this recipe except I used a little less salt and I did not chill the dough before baking and did not press them down. They flattened out a bit but not too bad, perfect to my liking. I did have to cook them a little longer than 10 mins but I made them bigger than walnut size."
"1","5","These are the best Oatmeal cookies ever. Don't change a thing, this recipe is perfect the way it is."
"1","1","Followed the recipe exactly. Tried a cookie a few minutes out of the oven, and for the first time in my life, even my 5 year old and 2 year old won't finish a cookie."
"1","5","Great recipe! Cookies came out soft and previous revieweres were right, you can bake them right after you prepare the batter. I added white chocolate chips in and cinnamon sugar on top! :)"
"1","5","Turns out great even though this is the first time I bake! Yay!"
"1","5","I needed to make some low-fat cookies, so instead of 1 cup of butter, I put 2 tablespoons of margarine into a 1 cup measure, then filled it with applesauce. The final mix wasn't quite thick enough for cookies, so I added an additional 3/4 cup oats. I made drop cookies instead of rolling the dough into balls and baked them for 9 minutes. The result was surprisingly good!"
"1","5","I love oatmeal cookies and wanted to bake them myself. These are really good and my whole family loved them. Thanks."
"1","5","Followed recipe exactly and the cookies were soft and delicious! I added Hershey's cinnamon chips and they enhanced the flavor even more! Will definitely make again and try different add-ins suggested by other reviewers!"
"1","5","Oh my, so good! Skipped the freezer step. Only trouble I had was keeping my son out of the cookie dough (almost better then the cookies themselves!). I made them slightly larger then one inch drop cookie style, and cooked for 8 minutes. They looked a little undone coming out of the oven, but hardened up around the edges after cooling and remained soft in the middle. Yum!"
"1","5","I made these a few times already and they taste great,I add dark choc chips to batter ,yummy,my kids and grandkids luv them,and they truly do stay SOFT..thanks"
"1","5","PERFECT! I made this recipe just before my grandsons arrived for a sleepover. Crisp on the edges, moist in the middle and excellent flavour. I found the recipe made over 36 cookies. I added dried blueberries . . .yummy! Remember to refrigerate for at least an hour for best results."
"1","5","These are addicting! Very soft and chewy and yummy! I didn't have vanilla extract so I subbed coconut extract and skipped the cinnamon and added chocolate chips. Fabulous!"
"1","5","Excellent. I divided the dough and added coconut & dried cranberries to half to mix it up a little. These are amazing with no additions and even more fabulous with a few extras tossed in. Yum. Thanks :)"
"1","5","Super yummy! The other reviews are right on! I added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and used old fashioned oats instead of the quick cooking oats and they were great! Also, I did not refrigerate and it still turned out WONDERFULLY!"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! There is no need to flatten them with a fork, unless you prefer a flatter/crispier cookie. My favorite way to make them is with a cup of butterscotch chips added, and then taking them out of the oven a bit early for soft, chewy deliciousness. Nom, nom, nom."
"1","5","I did not refrigerate. Scooped with a Pampered Chef cookie scoop. Baked 10 min. on Pampered Chef baking stone. Perfect."
"1","5","These were fabulous cookies. I did not press them either, I just rolled them in a ball and let them cook 9 minutes. Thank-you for sharing. Put a smile on my kids faces for sure. :)"
"1","5","I doubled the batter to make 48 cookies and ended up with 120 of them! The batter just wouldn't run out! They are lovely! I love this recipe. My new fav.!"
"1","5","my favorite cookie!!so gooddddd"
"1","3","These were very cakey, but not very moist. I cut out half a cup of sugar, and added raisins, oatmeal and pecans. No need to flatten with a fork unless you like thin and crispy cookies."
"1","5","Amazing cookies!! Just added chocolate chips which made them top notch!!"
"1","5","My first time making oatmeal cookies and they came out great. However, I tweaked the recipe somewhat- I added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2tbs cinnamon and about 1/4 cup of almond milk. I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of chopped raisins. I baked them at the rec'd temp. but the appearance of the first batch wasn't too appealing- I had to turn them and put them back in the over fot eh other side to get colour. The second batch I turned down the temp to 340c and they came out perfect!"
"1","5","I split the dough in half and made half chocolate chip, half raisin walnut. Both were irresistable!"
"1","5","These are the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! They weren't to dry and they were super moist in the middle. I made them for a bake sale and I had people asking me for more when they were all gone."
"1","5","3rd time making them, veryy delicious!! this one's a keeper"
"1","5","Very soft!"
"1","3","easy to make with good flavor. How do you make them thicker? I found them to be rather light."
"1","5","Perfectly chewy and addictively delicious!"
"1","5","My daughter and i baked these for the first time today and loved them, easy to make, they came out perfect, soft, chewy, sweet and they look just like the picture, thanks."
"1","5","easy to make and yummy :)"
"1","5","This cookie recipe is great. I made 3 different ones, one with coconut, cranberries and chocolate chip. They were a hit at home and at work. This is a keeper!"
"1","5","Great cookies. I omitted the cinnamon and added butterschotch chips and chocolate chips. Like the others, I didn't chill the dough or roll it into balls. I just made drop cookies onto a ungreased cookie sheet. Very good at high elevations (4900 ft here)."
"1","5","I had some oatmeal I wanted to use up. Even though oatmeal cookies are not at the top of my list of favorite cookies, I thought I would make some. This recipe is FANTASTIC! I think oatmeal cookies are now at the top of my favorite cookie list. I made a batch a couple days ago and had to make two more batches today--one went to my sister's work and they were gone in about 15 minutes. I have probably eaten at least 8 cookies so far today and ate at least that many on Monday. That's the only bad thing about these cookies, they are sooo addicting! Like some other reviewers, I did not put in the refrigerator nor did I flatten with a glass. I didn't have the patience to wait for the dough to chill. They came out perfect!"
"1","5","Absolutely thee BEST oatmeal cookies ever... and we've made a lot of oatmeal cookies in my family. We followed the recipe exact plus added walnuts and craisins for extra awesometasticness."
"1","5","THE BEST oatmeal cookie, we love these cookies. I've made them with raisins, without, with all brown sugar, extra vanilla or less cinnamon. And I do not bother to refrigerate the dough. Every time they are simply wonderful."
"1","5","EXCELLENT. I added 1 bag of chocolate chips. This recipe is easy and tasty. Thank you!"
"1","5","This is my new 'go to' oatmeal cookie! It's a very versatile recipe. The first time I made them as directed and loved them, the second time I omitted the cinnamon, and added lotsa chocolate chips and shredded coconut! So very delicious!"
"1","5","Wonderful cookies!!! I made exactly as directed, though I accidently didn't use the quick cooking oats. I added 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup dried cranberries (the kids' favorites). I let them chill overnight and baked them this morning. They are delicious!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"1","4","Added chocolate chips and they were yum! Not the best I've had though."
"1","3","I was excited to make this recipe and followed it completely..They baked up completely flat, and had a baking soda after taste..Maybe if I had used self-rising flour instead of all purpose and left out the baking soda and salt, they would have been better..I will try it that way next time and rate this again.."
"1","5","Yummy, I added Golden Raisins and walnuts. Definately a hit"
"1","5","Kept the recipe just as is and they were wonderful! will make again!"
"1","5","Great recipe! My cookies came out so yummy. I had to make some minor changes, I only had a half stick of butter so I used 3/4c applesauce to replace the butter I was missing and then I added some peanut butter chips and caramel chips and that's it! They came out chewy and very tasty. And I felt that the cookies needed the full 10 min of cooking as well. So try this recipe out, you'll love it!"
"1","5","so good"
"1","5","In an attempt to make these cookies healthier, I cut out all the butter and substituted with 3/4 cups of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of almond filling instead. They still remained soft and chewy and tasted great (especially since they were guilt free!)"
"1","5","Delicious! I added a cup of dried fruit & nut mix. The only problem with this recipe is that I cannot stop eating them."
"1","5","these are my favorite cookies ever. i've made them twice and they're so good i can't stop eating them. i added chocolate chips and decreased the sugar a bit the second time. FABULOUS"
"1","5","This was very good. I did add a cup of raisins. I found the dough to be pretty sticky. I kept returning it to the refridgerator after preparing each cookie sheet. Next time will put it in the freezer for an hour instead of the fridge."
"1","5","awesome recipe, I added a bit of nutmeg for fun and turned out great. thanks for this recipe."
"1","5","These are wonderful! I did everything exactly as stated, except I didn't flatten the cookies with a fork...baked them for 10 minutes and they came out crispy on the outside but soft and chewy inside. I will definitely be making these again!"
"1","4","These cookies are indeed soft, even days later. I added 1.5 cups of raisins to them and reduced the amount of sugar a small bit to compensate. I enjoyed them but they failed to get a strong reaction from anyone else (over a dozen people). Figure that is because oatmeal raisin are more or less the basic staple of the cookie world and are thus unlikely to wow."
"1","4","There were so many inconsistencies with this recipe. First, holy unhealthy batman! These were grocery store sweet, so I would use Splenda or cut back next time. I only used about 2 cups oats because they got too thick to work with and that made them spread out more on the pan. I added raisins and ground cloves as well. I might try adding white chocolate next time. Lastly, I made 52 cookies, NOT 24!"
"1","5","The recipe is perfect, and these turned out delicious. This is my new go-to oatmeal cookie recipe."
"1","5","Best oatmeal cookies ever! My boyfriend's mom is an amazing baker and she even loved them! A hint of cinnamon was brilliant. They are amazing plain, I made a third of the batch with dried blueberries and the other third with chocolate chips. They were all delicious. definitely my go-to recipe now!! I didn't leave the batch in the fridge or flatten them though. Baked with WW flour, they were healthier and still delicious. I halved the batch and still got about two dozen cookies."
"1","4","Very good base recipe.... 4 stars because they do come out a bit dry and need something added in to give them more flavor, I tried dark chocolate chips this time..."
"1","5","I'm in love with this recipe. the only change I did is adding more oats (about 1/2 cup)"
"1","5","I love these cookies! I add a cup and a half of raisins and they are perfect!!! Yum!!!"
"1","4","Pretty good. Added ground flax seed and used 1/2 whole wheat flour to make them a bit more nutritious"
"1","5","In the words of my BF: 'DIVINE!' (declared with a mouthful of cookie). He professes they're good enough to package and sell. Used Earth Balance in lieu of butter. One half was raisin chocolate chip and the other half was semi-sweet and white chocolate chip with shredded coconut. They're wonderfully crispy and for this they beat 'Beth's Spicy Oatmeat Raisin Cookies' from this site. (Disclaimer: the butter to margarine edit was also done to Beth's recipe for fairness in judging.)"
"1","5","I rushed through this recipe (added both eggs at once; didn't refrigerate dough; just dropped by rounded spoon; didn't flatten with fork). I also split the dough in half- added 2 cups choc chips to one half; added 1 cup of white choc chips and about 1/2 cup craisins to the other half. Made a ton of cookies (needed 4 cookie sheets). Easy. Delicious. Thanks!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies! The texture was perfect. Love them!"
"1","5","These are great, chewy oatmeal cookies but be warned, DO NOT double the recipe unless you have access to a super industrial strength mixer or there is a body builder in the house looking for a workout. I usually double and even triple all my drop cookie batches. I then drop them on a cookie sheet using my cookie scoop to freeze raw. I then put them in a ziplock after they have flash frozen. I just pick out however many I need to bake and am good to go. I'm sure these will freeze beautifully that way but I won't try doubling the recipe again. My husband, teenage son and I all had to take turns mixing the dough in my dutch oven pot! Had to make a rather messy transfer from my large kitchenaid mixing bowl. Lucky my little dog likes oatmeal!"
"1","5","I have been trying different recipes for years trying to master the chewy oatmeal cookie. This recipe is my favorite. The cookies were chewey and yummy!!"
"1","5","These were great! Forget the whole flatten with a fork thing....I just made them into balls and they turned out fantastic! Nine mins was just perfect...crunchy outside....soft inside.....yum!"
"1","5","Yum - these are so good! I use white/wheat flourand otherwise follow the recipe exactly. I've made these SO many times."
"1","5","I made these cookies in a resonable amount of time and they turned out great. They were a hit with the holiday crowd. Find what oatmeal cookie recipie you like and stick with it. I did take the advice of a previous review and took the cookies out a little early, and the softness was perfect :) Two things people want is a good taste and softness."
"1","5","These cookies were delicious! They don't flatten out too much when cooking. They stay nice and thick and soft. They didn't last too long in my house. I make double batches now!"
"1","5","These are fabulous! Soft and chewy and wonderful. My husband loves them, and he's terribly picky about cookies being the right texture. Super easy to make. I didn't bother with refrigerating the dough or flattening the dough balls on the cookie sheets. I did make a few minor changes: cut back on both sugars, used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, and used regular oats. I also reduced the cinnamon and threw in a touch of nutmeg and ginger. Oh, and reduced the baking time to 6 minutes. Next time (and there will be MANY next times) I'm going to divide the dough in half and add dried cranberries and chopped nuts to one half (have to keep some unadulterated for DH). I'm also going to tinker with the recipe bit by bit, to reduce the butter a couple tablespoons at a time (subbing applesauce). Can't wait to play with this recipe!"
"1","5","yum yum. these cookies turned out great. i didnt flatten them with the fork and they turned out fine. i made three kind: plain, w/ raisins, w/ nuts. I needed to bake them for 9 minutes."
"1","3","Although the cookies were soft I found that they were to sweet. The amount of sugar suggested definitely needs to be reduced."
"1","5","Delicious! Made the dough and then froze in portions. Defrosted, baked, and devoured. Followed recipe exactly."
"1","5","Practically perfection! Added a cup of raisins, would probably use a little more next time. These cookies were fabulous!"
"1","5","I made this recipe exactly as stated except for the addition of raisins. I don't usually like oatmeal raisin cookies but WOW. These were awesome...some of the best cookies I've ever made. Thanks for the amazing recipe!"
"1","5","These cookies was so good, my kids love them. Half of a batch I added raisins and walnut and they went so fast..Will be making again."
"1","5","First oatmeal cookie I have ever made, and after trying 2 more, I will be using this one from now on and always and forever. My family ate these cookies in two days flat and they were begging for more. I changed nothing but added raisins. I followed the directions exactly, and they were great. I highly recommend these cookies and after you use another oatmeal recipe you will end up back with these...they are spledid, spectacular, delicious and very easy to make and work with. A+++++++ :OP"
"1","5","Perfect oatmeal cookie recipe. They are soft and delicious. If anyone who rated these, saying they are not soft, I would suggest making sure not to overbake them. Any cookie will get hard if overbaked. A good rule of thumb, for any cookie, is to remove them from the oven, just before they're completely baked, and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or so. This way they will continue to bake, without getting too brown or hard."
"1","5","My husband's favorite cookie is oatmeal raisin. I had been searching for years for a recipe both he and I could agree on. I've finally found it. If baked longer they have a bit of a darker look about them and crisper cookie texture. If baked to 'just' done they have a pale look about them adn have a nice soft texture (my favorite). The only thing I did was add 1 cup raisins to this recipe (as it suggested in the the comments above) as we both like raisins in our oatmeal cookies. Next time I may try with chocolate chips. I thought the recipe had the right amount of cinnamon taste. Very good recipe. Will definately be keeping and making this recipe in the future. I made a double batch (as I gift cookies for Christmas). I used a small cookie scoop and recipe made roughly 10 dozen cookies I believe."
"1","5","i did add raisens and i made exactly as directed all i have to say is yumyumyum thank you for a delicious oatmeal cookie mmmm"
"1","4","Very good...didnt change a thing, were slightly crunchy on the outside...added raisins and a glaze for my husband..he really liked them"
"1","5","These are awesome. I changed the recipe to 16 servings and used cane sugar. I also added chocolate chips. I skipped the refridgerater step and I didnt mash them down with the fork. I used a melon baller and made them bite size, I didnt spray the cookie sheet either. This made 3 full pans of 24 cookies. Cooked them for 11 minutes and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before mooving to a rack to cool. Perfect. This recipe will be in my family now. Thanks"
"1","5","Its not right to rate these cookies 5 stars when they actually deserve at least 10 starts!!! Super easy to make, very soft and the best taste ever!!!! I find that there's no need to dip the spoon in sugar since they are perfectly sweet already. I slightly dipped so that they would not end up cruncy. EVERYONE has given these cookies rave reviews. I have given them as gifts as well as baked them by the truckloads for both of my children's classes. This recipe is a no-fail attempt and there is absolutely no need to change anything. I added raisins but purely due to personal choice. Your search for the perfect oatmeal cook ends right here!!! Thank you so much for the recipe. I will be making these over and over and over again!!!!!!"
"1","4","These were good, but they ended up being very flat and thin. I've made them twice now, thinking that maybe I'd done something wrong the first time around, but they were just as flat the second time. I'm not sure what's up with that, but I'll keep experimenting."
"1","4","Excellent cookie- dough is thick so don't make the dough balls too big!"
"1","5","Not only the best oatmeal cookie, but the best cookie period. OMG these are so delicious."
"1","5","These are absolutely incredible as-is! I make these for cookie exchanges and events and people absolutely RAVE about them! I have even made them without refrigerating the dough and they still come out great! For a chewier cookie, forget pressing them down with the fork and bake them by the spoonful."
"1","5","After the first bite of dough it was obvious these cookies were going to be ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Even my oatmeal cookie hating kids loved them!"
"1","5","These turned out great! I made one batch and got 53 cookies. I added Raisinettes, and they are yummy! I didn't refrigerate them, so I didn't press them down. I added a bit of Nutmeg and 1 tsp. of Cinnamon."
"1","5","This recipe is awesome...definetly going to be my 'go to' from here on out!"
"1","5","Oh Wow! These are so great! I can't wait to take them to work tomorrow-the guys are going to Love them. I bought new pans today (the baking pans from Sam's Club) & used my new silicone liners that I got @ CostCo yesterday-clean-up was so easy. I mixed them in the stand mixer-next time I will use the bigger bowl so I can add in more stuff. I used both vanilla & almond flavoring, added in raisins that I plumped in the microwave & mixed in a few chocolate chips. I wanted to add some chopped nuts, but the bowl was full. I dropped the cookies using the 2 spoon method, no chilling & they baked in about 10 minutes. Flavor & testure is great & I will freeze some so my hubby will get a few, since he is out of town right now."
"1","5","AWESOME!!!! AWESOME!!!! AWESOME!!!! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. Oatmeal raisen cookies are my very favorite and I will forever use this recipe. I loved how the dough rolled so easily after chilling it. I added 1 cup of raisens and 1/2 cup of pecans. I used Pam lightly on the cookie sheets and after baking I let them cool for 5 minutes and the cookies lifted off the cookie sheet very easily. After I rolled 1 tablespoon of dough in a ball, I flatened the dough slightly with my fingers and they came out just perfect after baking for 9 minutes. I thought putting more sugar on top would be too sweet since I added the raisens. Thank you Bittersweet 1 for this fantastic recipe and Merry Christmas!!!!"
"1","5","The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I had baked lots of different cookies the day I made these, and once I was done with the batter, I put it in the fridge to cool and forgot all about it. The next day, the batter was concrete solid. But I worked with it and it softened up, but not enough to add the chocolate chips that I had wanted to. No matter, with no extra add ins they were fantastic. Just right on the outside and chewy inside, and a nice subtle spicy smell and taste."
"1","5","Exccellent and easy did some just when they were mixed then some out of the frig some smooshed with a fork with sugar some just balls, all good. No difference. this is a keeper."
"1","5","I love these cookies. They are perfect every time I make them."
"1","5","fantastic - super soft and chewy but not obnoxiously chewy!"
"1","5","Wonderful! I subbed 1/2 wheat flour, used 1/2 the salt, and made 1/2 the batch with raisins. I might decrease the salt a bit more next time. Everyone loved these!"
"1","5","My local cafe makes amazing oatmeal cookies and I've been trying to duplicate them with different recipes. My search is over, this recipe makes those exact same cookies! They are perfect, soft and chewy and full of flavor. The only thing I changed was I only used 3/4 cups of each sugar instead of a whole cup, and they were still sweet enough. I also added chopped walnuts and craisins and blackcurrants. Oh, these are fantastic!"
"1","5","I made this recipe for my boyfriend's work and his boss said, 'If you break up with her, I will fire you!' They were just that good! I followed the recipe, except I omitted the cinnamon and added chocolate chips. Also, I didn't do the fork covered in sugar step (in my opinion, these were sweet enough with the choc chips). I also baked them for a solid 10 minutes. They came out AWESOME! And they still taste great a few days later! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","4","These cookies are great, but I'm not sure they are 5 star great. I made them exactly like the recipe. I also did what other reviewers had said and divided up the dough. In some I put walnuts and chocolate chips; in another I put nuts and dried cherries, and I didn't add anything to the last group. The cookies with something added had some thickness to them, but the ones with nothing added were very flat. All the cookies were good. I'm not sure why some of us had flat cookies. I refrigerated the dough as specified. Maybe we need a bit more flour?"
"1","5","is a great cookie. rolled into a ball and did not flatten it with a fork as said to and it was a soft fat cookie. thankx"
"1","4","What happened?! My cookies turned out as FLAT as a pancake. No, wait...they were FLATTER than a pancake! =) Although they were flat, my husband liked the taste of them. I didn't chill the dough (because I read so many reviews that stated it wasn't necessary), and maybe that's why my cookies were so flat. If I make these cookies again, I'll chill the dough to see if it makes a difference. I divided my cookies into 3 batches--the first batch had chocolate chips; the second batch had cranberries; the third batch had raisins. My husband and I liked the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies the best!"
"1","4","These were pretty good. I added 3/4 cup of golden raisins to it. Delicious!"
"1","5","This was very delicious! I brought it to school and share with my friends and they all loved it! I just followed the recipe as is without the changes some people suggested and it turned out very well. This oatmeal cookie is soft, but not very moist and it'll last about three days before becoming very hard. Also, the cinnamon added is wonderful, it doesn't overpower, but rather come subtle to the taste buds, the first time I bit into one my eyes widened in delight!"
"1","5","Wow!! I just made these cookies and they are amazing! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"1","5","These area fantastic!!! I ended up chilling my dough for 24 hours (no time to bake the day I mixed them up). The day I was ready to bake them, I took the dough out of the fridge just before leaving for a 90-minute walk; I baked them as soon as I returned and they were perfection. I did need to flatten them down just a bit, and they still baked up very nicely. I got 52 cookies out of this recipe, though I also added 1 package of Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips and 1 cup of raisins. Thanks for posting this recipe, BITTERSWEET1; it makes the ultimate oatmeal cookie!"
"1","5","Mmmm this is a good Oatmeal Cookie recipe !! I followed the recipe to a T except I did have to use a 1/3 cup of margerine (ran out of butter) and they came out fine. I also baked mine for 13 minutes (golden colour), they are still chewy in the middle but crunchy on the outside. Very simple to make..I do not own an electric mixer (just an old fashioned hand held one) and it was still pretty easy to mix all the ingredients (just had to use my muscles lol). I, like others, did not let the mixture cool for an hour, and I did not press down with a fork+sugar... I just scooped the mixture out with a spoon on plopped it onto the cookie sheet. Next time I'm going to try adding chocolate chips!! Yumm !! Thanks for this recipe !!"
"1","5","This is really good recipe. I changed some parts for making it chocolaty... So instead of 2 cups of sugar I added I cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of instant chocolate mix. As for the oatmeal I added 2 and 1/2 cup of instant oatmeals, and I added 1/2 of sliced almonds. That way I still got the soft oatmeals and with delicious chocolate and nuts :) enjoy"
"1","5","Okay as an always baking ~MoM~? These are by far the greatest cookies! I altered a few steps as I was pressed on time and patience...LOL I did NOT place the dough in the fridge at all and instead used 2 spoons to scoop and scrape amount of dough to cookie sheet. I then baked each sheet for 12 minutes. OMG! My daughter in law and I were horrid! We'd sneak a taste of the dough between bakings-you know...to make sure the taste remained consistent! Yeah that's MY story and I'm sticking to it! I had to make these two nights in row! Doubling the batch the next day as the first batch barely made past morning and half my sons weren't even aware that any had been made! Yeah. They're that good! Only ingredient changes I would dream of making would be to maybe add some chopped pecans to the mix...hmmmmm...Oh! my daughter in law and I also thought what a great flavor this dough had precooked? We're gonna take some and freeze it till hard- chop into bits. Take some vanilla ice cream and thaw till just softened. Add the dough, mix and re-freeze! Yeah...mmmmmm...this dough is just THAT good! Also great with your favorite coffee to wash those cookie crumbs down! Hehehehe"
"1","4","Cookies were saltier than I'm used to. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It took the full 10 minutes to bake. Next time, I would reduce amount of salt and add more oats. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","To die for! These cookies are so delicious I couldn't stop eating them. I don't ever grease anything. But I do use olive oil non-stick cooking spray and it worked very well. No it didn't taste like olive oil (haha). Very easy and quick to make. I did put the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes and in between baking. I did not form them into balls. I just used a heaping teaspoons and pressed each cookie with my index finger on the cookie sheet before baking and they came out wonderful! My husband says I can make these anytime! They are so good! MMmm perfect with a glass of milk."
"1","5","I found these cookies super easy to make and absolutely delishious! I brought them to work and everyone had at least two! This recipe is a definate do!"
"1","5","My daughter is a vegan so I had to alter this recipe some, but it's become a household favorite! I used 1/2 cup coconut milk and 3 tablespoons ground flax (allow to sit a few minutes) as a stand-in for the two eggs. I also added 1.5 tsp baking powder and used oil instead of margarine/butter. I did not grease the cookie sheets. These cookies are VERY moist, thick, chewy, yummy!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. I do not typically like oatmeal cookies, made this recipe for family, and even I couldn't get enough of them. It makes a very soft thick cookie with great flavor. You do not need to grease cookie sheets, as I find this gives cookies a weird crispy edge. I also baked them at 350 to cook the cookie enough, yet not overcook the bottoms. Instead of rolling into balls, I just grabbed a chuck of dough and dipped the tops into sugar, which gave the cookie a nice glistening top. The recipe doubled nicely as well. I added 1/2 c. crasiens(unsweetened) and a 1/2 c. golden raisens, which gave a nice color as well as taste. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone that loves a nice soft, chewy, and thick cookie. This one is a keeper for me."
"1","4","Delicious and moist, and they leave tons of room for whatever dried fruits or nuts you'd like to add. A big hit with my family."
"1","5","A great oatmeal cookie recipe! Crispy on the outside - soft on the inside :) I altered the recipe by substituting 1/2 tsp of vanilla for 1/2 tsp of maple flavoring. I also cut the oats down to 2 1/2 cups so they wouldn't be too dry. I added 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda because I like a 'puffier' cookie. I added 1 cup of chopped dried apples and 1 cup of white chocolate chips. Finally, I baked them at 350 for 14-16 minutes, and took them out a bit early to finish cooking on the warm cookie sheet. A keeper for sure!"
"1","5","The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made! I added 2 cups of raisins and cooked them for 11 minutes. Perfect!"
"1","5","I made these and my husband loved them! I made them into bars using a 9x13 in. pan and they were great! Thanks for a great oatmeal cookie recipe!"
"1","5","We really enjoyed these cookies!! After reading some reviews saying it wasn't necessary to refridgerate the dough, I decided to cool half the dough and see if there was a difference in the cookie. I ended up keeping the dough in the fridge overnight and made the cookies the next morning. The result was a cookie that was a lot fluffier and tastier. That being said, the dough that wasn't refridgerated was still tasty and looked good, it was just a bit flat and crispier. The refridgerated dough also needed the full 10 minutes, where as the dough that was not refridgerated only needed about 8. I also did not flatten the cookies--I didn't see a need. I also found it easier to get the cookies off the pan after greasing it."
"1","4","Yummy but a bit sugary for me :S probably just take a little bit of sugar out.. not too much but a little."
"1","5","Wow. What can I add-- this was the best, easiest, yummiest, and BEST texture! Deserves the great reviews it gets."
"1","5","These were delicious! I'm so glad I finally made them! The recipe was very easy to make, and they cooked perfectly at exactly 10 minutes. I drizzled half with white chocolate, and the other with chocolate. They looked very cute, and were soo good! :)"
"1","5","They had an OUTSTANDING taste and very easy to make!!!!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe over the weekend and noticed that when I initially made the batter, I went on and put the dough onto my cookie sheet without chilling. I had to do drop cookies because the batter was not chilled enough to roll into balls. Like other reviewers, I did not flatten them out. This set of cookies spread and made bigger cookies, but they were still soft because I baked them a little less. I didn't want to make all of the cookies that day so I refrigerated the dough and then made more cookies the next day. I noticed that when the dough is chilled, the cookie balls tend to stay smaller and they don't spread as much. As my dough warmed up, my cookies also got bigger and bigger. I'd actually suggest to take BITTERSWEET1's advice and chill the dough for at least an hour or bake unchilled dough a little less time."
"1","5","These are still coming out of my oven and they are delicious! Very simple, but great ingredients. Remind me of the ones I made as a child. Thanks!"
"1","5","These came out perfect. My only modification was adding 3/4 cup of raisins. This is a keeper."
"1","5","Good cookies! I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not refrigerate the cookie dough first. It didn't matter...they were perfect without doing that!"
"1","2","Not impressed. They turned out very dry and crumbly. They do however has a good taste to them, I will try to make them again with some changes to see if they are any better."
"1","5","I did not refrigerate the dough before baking and I used a regular cookie scoop to make big cookies, increased baking time to 13 minutes with cooling on baking sheet 5 minutes.Baking 6 at a time per cookie sheet ended up with 15 cookies total. Soft texture but after fully cooling held together well when picked up (about 5 inches in diameter) These are bakery quality and will be in gift baskets come Christmas."
"1","5","As I am standing here eating the dough while waiting for the first batch to come out of the oven, all I can say is that they are great and taste just like the one's my Mom made while we were growing up. I lost that recipe (sorry Mom) so this is the one that is going to take it's place. I did add 1 1/2 cups of choc chips"
"1","5","Excellent. I've made these cookies a few times now, and I have it honed now. Overall, I make the recipe pretty much to the letter, just with some additions. Prior to mixing up the batter, I let the eggs sit out until they reach room temperature, and soak raisins (1 cup worth) in warm water, 10-15 minutes. I always just use one cup of shortening, in place of butter. I notice no difference. I also add 1/2 a teaspoon of cardamom, just because I like that spice. At the end, I add the wet raisins into the batter and maybe 2-3 tablespoons of the water that the raisins soaked in. (I've never really measured it.) I find the batter is too dry and will crumble if I don't do that. Like other reviewers have said, dipping a fork and pressing down the cookies is pointless. Just roll them into balls and they'll flatten on their own in the oven. There's no real need to refrigerate the dough for an hour or grease the pan either. There's enough grease in the cookies. They shouldn't stick. I don't always add raisins. I've added other butterscotch chips and chocolate chips as well. In those cases, again, don't forget the 2-3 tablespoons of water, or else the batter will be a little dry. This is my honed recipe after a few tries. My cookies don't last long, people love them."
"1","5","These are my absolute favorite oatmeal cookie. Even my 12 year old DD loves these. I do add additional flour to ensure the cookies are not flat. I also do not roll them in sugar, flatten them with a fork or put the dough in the fridge. They're soft and chewy and eaten faster than I can make them."
"1","5","Can't improve on this. So soft and crispy-brown sugary on the edges. As always, baked on parchment."
"1","5","This recipe is the best. The only change that I made was to add 2 cups of quick cook oatmeal and 1 cup of regular cook oatmeal. The regular cook oatmeal is slightly bigger than the quick cook oatmeal. I even bought the store brand oatmeal. The cookies were a big success. I’m going to make them again for my sister’s bridal shower. Oatmeal cookies are my husband’s favorite. And, he can’t get enough of them."
"1","5","What a yummy cookie!!!! I followed all the ingredients except I added dried cranberries, and I didn't chill the dough, cuz I like flatter cookies. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside...perfect!!!!!!"
"1","4","i made these things a little while ago...and i ended up making like 4 batches of then it made just over 50 cookies...they taste wonderful and are definitley not hockey pucks...i will make again only took off a star cuz my friends moms are a little better...maybe she will give me the recipe one day"
"1","5","I added a cup of toasted pecans and left out the cinnamon. I knew they would be good when I could not stay out of the dough! Mine were really flat, but I will take the blame for that because I did not have the time to chill them first. Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
"1","5","I made these 2 days ago and they are the best oatmeal cookies. I didn't chill the dough though and had no problems with it."
"1","5","Made as recipe stated but couldn't find my cinnemon, so used a cinnemon sugar mix instead and still turned out fabulous! Made them 2 days ago and they r still soft and just as good as day 1! I also added some chocolate chips to mine!"
"1","5","These cookies were incredibly good! I did make a few changes, I cut both the brown and white sugar down and used 3/4 cup of each. My son is allergic to eggs, so I replaced the eggs with a total of 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. I divided the dough and made several varieties. A batch with mini Enjoy Life semi sweet Chocolate chips, another with choc. chips and dried cranberries, another with raisins. Also a set with white chocolate chips and finally white choc chips with cranberries. A real keeper of a recipe!"
"1","5","This oatmeal cookie recipe beats my mom's hands-down and reminds my husband of his mother's cookies! Thanks for giving us an easy recipe that is delicious!!!"
"1","5","The BEST! I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't leave them cool on the baking sheet because they started to stick. This is the best oatmeal cookie I've ever baked! Thank you BITTERSWEET1 for sharing."
"1","5","These are excellente cookies, everyine loved them in my family. Next time I make them, I will definetely reduced some of the sugar, it was a little bit too sweet for me."
"1","5","This recipe rocks! I did a few little changes though. I used a hot cereal that contained oats and barley and other healthy stuff and used 2 cups of that, and 1 cup quick oats. I also threw in a awesome fruit mix I got at Trader Joes that had pomegranate, raspberries, and black currants. I did also use half white flour and half wheat. Wow, it turned out amazing and I had a bunch of people ask me for the recipe! Yummmm.."
"1","5","These turned out exactly how I imagined that they would - oatmealy and soft. We added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the recipe and it gave it that extra oomph to it that we loved!"
"1","4","This is a great recipe! Because I add rasins I will cut back on the sugar next time."
"1","4","This was one of the best cookie recipes my family and I have tried. The chewy center and crunchy edges were delightful."
"1","5","awesome!"
"1","1","Dry and 'cakey'."
"1","5","These cookies were fantastic! Here's a tip: if you want them to be chewy in a container, DO NOT OVER BAKE THEM. Take them out when they are golden yellow and not brown. Or you can just pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds and they'll seem like they came right out of the oven. Plus, there's not need to dip the fork in the sugar when pressing the dough down. Although these cookies were a bit sweet, so I suggest you reduce the granulated sugar about 1 to 2 tablespoons."
"1","3","I agree with the reviewer who stated they were not moist; mine weren't either. Also I found them way too sweet. I made the cookies the way the recipe says & added the raisins. If I were to use this recipe again, I would radically cut the amount of sugar. I will say the person I made them for asked for soft cookies & they did come out soft, although he indicated the flavor was nothing special."
"1","5","I added a bag of chocolate chips and opted out of flattening the cookies with a fork. They were so good I very nearly cried."
"1","5","These cookies are delicious and moist as written. Thanks for sharing."
"1","4","pretty good, cooked 10 min. came out perfect, cooked on parchment paper, a little bland so i added coconut and dark chocolate chips to the rest of the batch, much better flavor that way. Next time i will add more spices for flavor, good base recipe though ;0)"
"1","5","Turned out great!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! the sugar was just enough in this recipe so I didn't dip the fork in extra sugar. I did add raisins to half the batch and cranberries and white chocolate chips to the other half. Both kinds were wonderful...everyone loved them. I actually flattened them and baked them for a full 10 minutes since my family likes these more crunchy than soft...perfect!!"
"1","5","Delicious! I usually don't like raisins, but I ate them happily in these cookies!"
"1","5","Wonderfully chewy! I added chocolate chips and dried cranberries."
"1","5","Yummmmmy! I made these today, adding raisins and they turned out perfectly, will be putting these on my favorites list to make often, will try butterscotch chips in them next time."
"1","3","I'm not sure what exactly I did wrong but these cookies turned out crumbly and a little too sweet for my taste. It made me really miss the ones my mom used to make. Also, to top it all off, the next day when I went get one out of the ziploc bag, the whole thing was filled with ants! It was like some bad cookie omen or something out of a horror movie. Anyway, these just weren't for me."
"1","5","Great cookie!! Even held up with 1/2 WW and 1/2 white flours. I added a 1/2 cup flaxseed meal, just for health kicks! Family loves them!!!"
"1","4","These cookies were pretty good they weren't the best that i've ever tasted but lets be honest and all agree that grandma makes the best of everything but if you want them even more moist add some milk in with the oats. about a cup or 2 should be enough"
"1","5","I thought this was a Great Oatmeal Cookie recipe. They were moist and very easy to make. I added some butterscotch chips to half the batch and they were awesome. This recipe is going in the vault for sure!"
"1","5","I made these sunday night - absolutely delicious. they are heavy on the oats though so I am really glad I did half the dough with 1/2 c of raising and the other half with 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and some raisins. I brought them to the office and everyone raved about them. I still have a few left and am trying ever so hard to not eat them for breakfast. Follow this recipe as is and add some raisins- you will love it. Oh - I kept my cookies in little balls rather than flattening before baking - still soft two days later! Great recipe!"
"1","4","I must have done something wrong along the way because mine were anything but chewy. Other than this mishap the batter was delicious and the cookies were a hit with friends."
"1","4","these are very very good. Try adding about half a small bag of chocolate chips.......we almost always do and it comes out just lovely."
"1","4","You do NOT need 1 cup of butter in these cookies! My husband who is not a baker just made these cookies and informed me that he only used 1/2 cup and folled the rest of the recipe as is. They came out great and chewy with only half the butter!! I would have never known :) Only thing is they were a little flat but taste great!"
"1","5","I never made cookies in my life, but I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies, actually I like any cookie. But Oatmeal is my favorite, and I followed this recipe to a tee other than the chill for a hour part. Here is a tip for rookies in baking cookies like these, you will know when your cookies are ready when the edge of the cookie is brown. Dont worry that the cookie doesnt look all brown as when it cools it congeals and hardens. Dont touch it. These cookies are awesome and taste better than any oatmeal cookie I have eaten from grocery stores. BTW add raisins, I put a cup but I think a Cup and a Half would have been better. I like raisins!!, but a Cup of raisins will be enough. GREAT RECIPE!!!"
"1","5","First of all, let me start off by saying i do NOT like Oatmeal & Raisin cookies. I was making these for a co-worker. They are Phenomanal!! Everyone loved them! Suepr soft just the right amt of ingredients of everything! Must bake! BTW? This makes like 36 cookies!"
"1","5","Very good.....The best oatmeal cookie i've had so far. A must try recipe."
"1","3","Too flat. Too sweet."
"1","5","I made these exactly as described, and they were fantastic! They baked into the perfect cookies - not flat, perfectly chewy, not cakey. Next time I am going to try 1 C whole oats and 2 C quick cooking oats, to see if I like them even better with more texture. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
"1","5","Perfect, they were definitely soft, which is obviously why I tried this recipe."
"1","5","Love them love them love them. Perfect."
"1","5","Great cookie! The only thing I did different was reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup each & using parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet. I put them on the cookie sheet in balls and they flattened out slightly to produce a nice hardy cookie, not flat! Yummm! Oh and I did add rasins."
"1","5","I pretty much followed the recipe and they were the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. They looked underbaked when I took them out at around 10 mins, but set enough on the pan and were perfectly chewy (and still are next day). I used half whole wheat flour and added about 2 Tbsp flax seed, and did add raisins. All around terrific, soft, chewy oatmeal cookies. Will be my standard recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies."
"1","2","Humph. I don't know what went wrong with these. They COMPLETELY flattened and are not soft at all. I reduced the temp to 350 and it still happened. My baking soda is not expired, but maybe it went bad somehow? It's obviously something I did wrong, because everyone else's sound and look great. I think I'll try these again when I buy new baking soda."
"1","5","Recipe was Excellent. I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and walnuts to finish it off."
"1","5","These were yummy!"
"1","5","I made these reduced fat/cal (used smart balance for baking and splenda blend) and they were super moist and delish! I can only imagine how awesome they'd be with all the full fat/cal ingredients. I also subbed 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and used regular oats. Don't hesitate to make these!"
"1","5","I didnt squish them with a fork in sugar like suggested, i just rolled them in little ball (the size of large walnuts). the temp was a bit high, so i had to reduce it to 350. they were a perfect blend of spices that made them delicious!"
"1","5","I would actually give this a 4 star rating, but everyone else who ate them absolutely loved them so I've bumped it up to 5. I followed the recipe exactly besides adding in butterscotch chips. I did chill the dough and they came out nice. The first pan I pressed the rolled balls like the recipe said, but thought they came out too flat. The rest of the dough I just balled and did NOT press and they were perfect. Plus, mine took 11-12 minutes and were still very soft. Maybe my oven is a little off in temperature?"
"1","5","Thanks for this one. This is my husband's absolute favorite cookie. I make them at least twice a week to have with our evening tea, I add lots of raisins and pecans, for an extra healthy snack. The dough can be difficult to stir, so I usually add a few drops of milk."
"1","5","My husband loved, loved, loved these cookies! I added raisin's to these and they came out great! It's a keeper"
"1","5","OMG Delicious! I halved the recipe and still got 24 cookies. I also did not flatten them. Will keep this recipe!!"
"1","5","Holy cow! These are amazing. I followed the recipe, except I doubled the vanilla extract and didn't flatten the cookies with a fork. Not needed. The recipe also easily changes yield. I only had 1/4 cups of butter, so I made 6 servings (which were really 8 large cookies). They came out perfectly round. 10 minutes at 375 makes them come out golden brown. I chopped dried cherries and put white chocolate chips in mine."
"1","5","YUM, I will make this recipe again and again. The chewy cookies baked up perfectly with nice crispy edges. The cinnamon gives them a mellow flavor that's super tasty but not overpowering. I didn't change a thing about the ingredients but I did make the first batch without refrigerating the dough and they came out fine. I'm going to make the rest tomorrow to see if there's a noticeable difference but either way, these were delicious!"
"1","5","This really was a SOFT oatmeal cookie!! Very good but ofcourse with every great recipe something can be tweaked. Brown sugar, more cinnamon, lemon extract, etc. Just a bit of experimenting can take this cookie from great to outstanding!!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! Followed the recipe, plus using the advice on increasing the oatmeal. I used 2-1/2 cups. Also added 1 cup raisins, 1 cup chopped walnuts, and 1 cup of shredded, sweetened coconut. Fabulous! Cool, they are crisp with a chewy center. They soften up beautifully in the microwave, if you want to relive that 'just out of the oven cookie' again! Thank you!"
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had. The only thing I changed was the oats. I didn't have quick cooking oats, so I used the old fashioned. I also added chocolate chips and pecans. This is the only oatmeal cookie recipe I will use."
"1","5","Great Recipe. I did not bother chilling the dough.. no problems."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. I added pecans and they turned out perfect.."
"1","5","Got a lot of good feedback on these! Did not need to put dough in fridge."
"1","5","Very good. All of my other oatmeal cookie recipes were a little too hard. This one has perfect flavor and softness. Thanks for sharing. My kids love it!"
"1","1","First of all I found the dough on these cookies to be really dry and I could hardly get it to stick together to make a mound on the cookie sheet. Then as they baked, they spread out and burned. Not sure what happened, I followed the recipe exactly, but I will not waste my time on these again!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! Since my boyfriend and I are choco-holics I threw in a few mini-chocolate chips. This made the cookie the best ever! In fact, I had to bring them to work cause my co-workers were wondering where I got such a great cookie. Hands down, the best! They key to getting a nice soft cookie, is simply to not over bake it. I did not find any problems with this recipe and the cookies were soft and chewy. Yum Yum!"
"1","4","Due to a snow storm, I only had half a cup butter, so I substituted shortening for the other half. I don't know if that's why it seemed to be a bit bland, but I added nutmeg and cloves, and it still needed a bit more. I split the batch in half and added dried cranberries to half. The cranberries made it super yummy! I took them out at eight minutes, when they didn't look quite done, but once cooled they were perfect. I know it's not fair to judge a recipe when I didn't have the proper ingredients. Will update once I make it again, properly."
"1","5","Great recipe! Took a bunch of these cookies to the office, and they didn't last long..."
"1","5","Turned out well - I made mine with raisins. I would suggest flattening the dough significantly if you like flat cookies. I baked for the full 10 minutes. Cookies were dense and moist."
"1","5","Really good- with chocolate chips or raisins. Can't wait to try white chocolate and cranberry like someone sugested. Don't over bake though. enjoy!"
"1","5","These cookies are dangerous! Don't try this recipe if you are on diet (like I am) because once you bake 'em, you can't stop eating 'em! SOOOO DELICIOUS!!! I followed the recipe except I reduced the amount of white sugar to 3/4 cup because I wanted to add 2 cups of golden raisins which are usually very sweet and moist. The cookies came out just so perfectly with perfect amount of sweetness! Darn, that's why I can eat them endlessly! I tried both flatten version as the recipe says (but no sugar) and just dropped the dough on a cookie sheet version but like many reviewers mentioned, both came out almost the same. Maybe the flatten version came out slightly more crispy. Because I prefer soft and chewy cookies, I won't bother chilling or flatten them next time. I wasn't even a fan of oatmeal cookies. I only decided to bake some because I got a box of oatmeal which I don't usually eat and didn't want to waste it. Now I'm a biggest oatmeal cookie fan! This was my first oatmeal cookie recipe but I don't think I have to try another one. Thank you very much for sharing this."
"1","5","Followed this recipe exactly, adding only 1 cup dried cranberries, 1 cup white chips and 1/2 TBS fresh orange zest. Baking for the shortest time produces a soft cookie, the longer you bake, the more crisp and dry it becomes, so you are in control of how they turn out in that respect. Hubby says, THIS is also a keeper as well as The Best Oatmeal Cookie recipe. I love recipes that allow me to add my own extra flavorings but produce a great result on their own. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Both get 5 stars, too hard to choose!"
"1","5","WOW! These were great! I followed the directions...but added choc.chips... and they were gobbled up!!!"
"1","5","The best recipe for oatmeal raisin! I added 1 cup of cherry craisins and a dash of orange zest. I will make these again and try lots of other mix ins."
"1","5","Very good cookies! I switched 1/3 of the butter to applesauce and added extra cinnamon, a pinch of allspice and some dried cranberries. Yum!"
"1","5","Great basic recipe and easily adapted by using Splenda, adding nuts, etc. to slightly alter flavor and/or make a more healthy cookie. Perfect consistency and bakes well, crispy on edges and soft in the center."
"1","5","These turned out delicious!!!I just finished baking them and couldn't wait to post a comment!Super easy to make, chewy and soft. I have never made oatmeal cookies but boy did these turn out great :) I made some small changes to the recipe: reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced flour to 1 1/2 cup, and instead of using quick cooking oats, it actually worked perfect with old fashioned oats. I will be making them again tomorrow for a birthday party:) Thanks for the recipe,and ENJOY to whoever decides to try!!!"
"1","4","Definitely can overcook these easily so my first few batches didn't turn out so great, but once I got the timing right they were delicious! Very easy to make too."
"1","5","I had my doubts about this recipe, but made exactly as printed. To my surprise the cookies came out light and moist. Not to mention delicious. NOTE: I left in fridge overnight and used old fashioned rolled oats not the quick oats. Cooked 9 minutes at 375. Made 3 dozen. Thanks Bittersweet1"
"1","5","I followed the recipe (adding in 1 cup of raisins) but did not chill ingredients, nor did I flatten with fork dipped in sugar. When everything was mixed, I rolled them into a ball and baked immediately. Very good! Since we like our cookies a little fluffier, I made another batch a few hours later adding an additional 1/4 cup of flour and they were perfect. These freeze very well. This is a keeper!"
"1","5","excellent cookies! soft and chewy. i had a request for oatmeal ccokies at work and chose this recipe. very easy and yummy! i normally add raisins. my only complaint is that the dough is very stiff, but obviously that can't be helped. i actually broke my cookie scoop making these one time! LOL. but they were worth it. thanks so much for the recipe. i make them often!"
"1","4","Very Easy recipe; good simple Oatmeal cookies."
"1","5","Excellent Recipe!! I have never made oatmeal cookies and this recipe was the best to be my first batch!"
"1","4","I'm not that good at baking and every time I attempt to make oatmeal cookies they turn out underbaked/cooked. This recipe was easy to follow. They turned out great for me, but i tweaked the recipe a bit Instead of 1 cup each of brown and white sugar, I used 3/4 cup of each and added chocolate chips. I'm making them as a present for my boyfriend who will spend a lot for oatmeal cookies. I really hope he likes this. My mum took 2 already. Thanks for the recipe"
"1","5","The only thing I changed was that I didn't roll the cookies in sugar or use a fork dipped in sugar. Kept everything else the same, baked them all for 8 minutes because I LOVE soft, chewy cookies!"
"1","5","BEWARE! These cookies are delicious! The only problem is that you're likely to not even come close to the recommended serving size of two dozen -- the cookie dough will get you, and get you good. After your upset stomach goes away from all the delicious dough, the cookies are great. Finally, only cook them for 7 1/2 minutes."
"1","5","I loved these! And I loved JENIP's idea of breaking the batter up into 3 parts and adding different nuts/dried fruit to each part. Next batch I'm going to ice with a glaze made from orange juice, orange zest and powdered sugar! Yum!"
"1","5","Outstanding recipe, and so easy to make! I added 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves to the original, and it gave it a great, but subtle, kick. Even without it, this recipe is fantastic!"
"1","5","Delicious! Yumo! These were definitely soft and chewy. I used 1 Cup of raisins and this was the perfect amount. I tried a batch rolled into balls and not pressed. They were a bit softer, but even the ones that I pressed with a fork were still soft and chewy, so either works :) Enjoy!!"
"1","5","These are totally delicious! I add a half cup each of craisins and chopped walnuts when baking these for adults and plain when baking for children. I usually make a half batch because this recipe is so generous."
"1","5","These cookies are wonderful. They taste just like the oatmeal cookies I grew up on! I thought they might be too boring to bring to a party, but ever since my friends request them all the time!"
"1","5","These cookies turned out great. I made some with just oatmeal, some with raisins, some with nuts and some with raisins and nuts. My husband ate most of them the same night. I will definitly keep this recipe in my recipe book"
"1","5","I got rave reviews when I added 1 Cup of pecans and 1 Cup of cranberries to this recipe. I also found the refrigeration unnecessary but did find I had to flatten the cookies once they were on the baking sheet, otherwise I had to bake them longer."
"1","5","Yum!"
"1","5","First of all, let me say thank you for sharing!! I loved these cookies. Soft and chewy just like they should be. Only thing I changed was making it 1/2tsp. cinnamon and 1/4tsp. of all-spice simply because I'm not a huge cinnamon fan. Absolutely delicious"
"1","5","OMG these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had, and probably one of the best cookies i have had, oatmeal and other. I had to cook a few different batches since my cookie sheet was small, and I think they came out better shaped when I did not use the fork to press them down - unless I pressed down too much. I also did not use the sugar on the fork, and they still were excellent. Best oatmeal cookie hands down!!"
"1","5","My husband LOVES these oatmeal cookies, I added raisins and pecans they were GREAT!!!"
"1","5","great recipe!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies. I keep them soft with a piece of bread inside a ziploc baggie or container."
"1","5","I added chocolate chips and it came out great!"
"1","5","Absolutely the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had!"
"1","5","I have tried 5-6 new oatmeal raisin recipes over the past few years, and I'm finally done searching -- these turned out great! I included 1-1/2 c. raisins, 1 c. chopped walnuts and 1/4 teaspoon allspice (on top of 1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon)."
"1","5","Well I choose this recipe because of all the great reviews and boy am I glad I did!! These are wonderful!! I added raisins and craisins!! I doubled the recipe because I am making them for gifts to give at Christmas. I added 1 tsp of cloves because to me its not Christmas without the smell and taste of cloves!!And I cant imagine eating an oatmeal cookie without raisins!! Thank you so much for this recipe!! It will go in my recipe book and will be one I hand down to my daughter (who absolutely LOVES them!!)"
"1","5","Really good starter recipe! I added walnuts and chocolate chips and took these to my work Christmas party. The cookies were very moist and yummy!"
"1","5","I made these as part of our cookie assortment for Christmas. I don't normally like oatmeal cookies but I hesitantly took a piece that my husband offered me as they were cooling. All I can say is WOW! These cookies are delicious and now unfortunately for everyone else, these oatmeal cookies are MINE and won't see the cookie tray! We did leave out the raisins since neither of us are fans and the recipe certainly didn't miss them!"
"1","5","very good...cut the cinnamon back to 1 tsp, and I added a cup of craisins and about 1/4 cup of currents, then to the last half added an additional 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. very good either way. I didn't chill them for an hour, I just mixed them up and dropped them onto the cookie sheet, didn't press them flat. will definatly make them again they are very versitle and would be good with any combination of add-ins."
"1","5","I HATE this recipe! Haha. I have eaten probably 25 of these cookies in the last 4 days. And I'm TRYING to lose all my pregnancy weight from the baby I had 5 weeks ago. At this rate I will weigh more than I did at 40 weeks pregnant! These are the BEST! I cut the salt in half and only used 2 1/2 cups of oats because I added chocolate chips and walnuts. WARNING: THESE ARE ADDICTING! This is a keeper. ***UPDATE*** 2 years later I am still making these cookies!!! I have completely perfected them and get SOOO many compliments every time I take them somewhere. I've been making a batch a day for the past few weeks and I CANNOT get people to leave them alone until the 2nd day! LOOOOOVVVEEE these cookies!"
"1","4","These is a great recipe for deliciously chewy cookies. The first time I made them I followed the instructions but the second time around I made my own modifications because I wanted them to be chunkier and more flavorful. I added one cup of raisins and one cup of walnuts plus a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. I did no hill the dough and I did not flatten it with fork dipped in sugar. The raisins makes them sweet enough. The result was a sinful cookie bursting with flavor and with sweet raisins and crunchy walnuts in every single bite. YUM!"
"1","5","I made these last night but added raisins to half the recipe and chocolate chips to the other half. Man these were amazing!"
"1","4","The cookies were very good. The bigger you make them the better. I'm a moist cookie kinda gal so these were pretty good. After they cool them seem crunchy but the inside is just right :) Also the cookies are great with either rasins or chocolate chips. I also used splenda insted of regular sugar and they still tasted just as fabulous. flattening the cookies with a fork diped in sugar is critical! dont forget it :)"
"1","5","This recipe is great. I didn't change a thing and we all enjoyed them. They came out very soft. Wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","WARNING: You will not be able to resist these cookies! I ate 3 right out of the oven and had my husband hide the rest. I added raisins (that I had soaked in hot water) to these and it really complimented the cookies. My family ate these in one day. This will be my permanent Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from now on!"
"1","5","I have never made oatmeal cookies before and these were easy. I have made them two different ways. X-large scoops of dough (baked 12 min.) come out super soft. I have refrigerated the dough overnight and made small golf ball sized scoops. The cookies hold the smaller shape and are crispier on the outside."
"1","5","These cookies were great! I was a little skeptical because the batter was slightly drier than I thought it would be, and of course I added a lot of raisins and they turned out perfect. Definitely a keeper!!"
"1","5","My family loves these and requests them for every family function!"
"1","5","I made these for my husband who loved them.   I usually don't enjoy oatmeal cookies at all but this recipe had me coming back for more!"
"1","5","This recipe is great, I've made them twice in a week. I did make some changes to make them slightly healthier; I cut the white sugar by 50% and the brown sugar I cut by 25% and used spelt flour rather than white flour. I also added dried cherries and chopped walnuts. I thought they were plenty sweet without as much sugar and the spelt flour added some fiber while still keeping a great soft cookie consistency. My husband and I loved them and I took some to work and 2 women asked me for the recipe."
"1","4","just sweet enough. pretty good."
"1","5","Awesome! Everyone loved these warm and fresh out of the oven, and they were just as great the next day!"
"1","5","great oatmeal cookies. I did cook them for 12 minutes as I bake on stoneware. I took the recommendation of adding a little allspice and not refrigerating for 1 hour."
"1","5","These cookies were great, but just a tad sweet for my liking. Next time I'll cut down on the sugar."
"1","5","1/2 portion. 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 equiv of splenda, 1/2 cup all purp flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Added about 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup plus of dark choc chips. Excellent!"
"1","5","This recipe was wonderful. Each cookie turned out so soft and moist.Because I'm always trying to make recipes a little healthier i did change a couple of things . Instead of 1 cup butter i used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce, and added 1/4 cup ground wheat germ and 1 cup large organic raisins. My family loved these, especially my 2 1/2 year old who loves cookies."
"1","5","The very BEST oatmeal cookies I've tasted! Thank you for this recipe! The only changes I made were: 1) I replaced the butter with margarine and 2) only added 2 cups of oats. Sooo chewy! A healthy snack for the sweet-tooth mom and kids."
"1","3","Other than adding walnuts to the recipe no other alterations were made. The first day they were quite yummy but dried out the next. Kept 'em sealed tight in a container-didn't seem to help. Will probably only make a few at a time as they dry out pretty fast. Weren't very 'soft' to begin with, more so chewy than anything else."
"1","5","This recipe makes a great oatmeal cookie! However, I found if you hold the dough overnight in the fridge, the cookies don't bake up as well; They are not as soft as they should be and that's what this recipe is all about!"
"1","5","I added chocolate chips. Soooooooo good."
"1","3","I had high expectations with this recipe, based on all the positive feedback from past reviewers. The cookies baked well & tasted great the night I made them. I hoped the flavor & texture of the cookies would last longer than they did. After a day or so, the cookies ended up tasting dried out (although sealed in an airtight container) & unfortunately lost some of their appeal."
"1","5","By far the best oatmeal cookie I have ever tasted! Even my chocolate chip cookie loving boyfriend loves them. He rated it a 10 and told me not to change a thing. Oh, I forgot to mention, he's the pickest eater ever. What a great recipe. Thanks!!"
"1","5","Yum! My husband loves these almost as much as my chocolate chip cookies, which is a huge deal! I did use regular oats (not quick) since that's all we had, but I actually like them slightly chewy. Even though the recipe says it yields two dozen, I got almost 6 dozen large cookies out of it! That should last us a while - or maybe not!"
"1","5","They came out delicious - I didn't change a thing. I used an mini ice cream scoop and they came out perfectly round."
"1","5","Made these last night and took them to work today. Everyone raved about them. Didn't change a thing and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. This will definitely be my #1 oatmeal/chocolate chip recipe from now on."
"1","4","O.K., These turned out amazingly good even though I'm an idiot and think that little elves must stock my cupboards with sugar, flour ect. First off: 3/4 cup sugar (ran out) and 1 1/4 cup brn sugar. Completly out of cinn. so I had to use like 1/2 teas cloves. Everything else I actually DID have and even with these mistakes they still turned out awsome! Net time I'll have the stuff to actually make them RIGHT and I bet there even better."
"1","4","Excellent recipe-followed to a T! A huge hit at work... will surely make again!"
"1","5","These are GREAT cookies! Everyone ate em up. I did make a few changes, though. Used rolled oats and left out the cinnamon."
"1","5","Excellent recipe! I made these exactly as written and they turned out perfectly. We loved the soft, chewy texture and the cinnamon taste. Flavor-wise, it reminded me of a snickerdoodle. This is definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","These cookies were really good! I did add a bit more cinnamon to the batter and only used half of the sugar. The cookies are still sweet enough though... am even thinking to reduce the sugar a bit more next time. I baked them until the edges of the cookies were crispy and the inside was still soft. Nearly all gone now!"
"1","5","Yummy and easy. My husband and daughter loved these. After mixing the batch, I separated equals into 2 bowls. My husband likes raisins, so I added raisins to one/half of the batch. He also likes his oatmeal cookies hard (not soft), so I baked his batch an extra 5 minutes. This recipe make a lot of cookies, so you can play up the divided batch on each cookie sheet that goes in the oven. On some batches I didnt press down the top of the rounded dough with a fork, so they come out extra soft (the way my daughter likes 'em). Also, next time I will add applesauce in the mix to replace some of the butter, just for a healthier recipe. Hope they turn out...as yummy as the first batch."
"1","5","Excellent soft oatmeal cookie. I followed the directions exactly the first time I made them and they were great, but this time a decided to add a few extras. I included about 1/2-3/4 cup shredded coconut, almond slivers and Californian golden raisins. Great recipe just as but also versatile enough to incorporate different things in. Thanks!"
"1","5","I came home from work to find my husband and 3 year old son making these cookies so he can do them anyone can! They turned out great and I think what made them really good was the cinnamon. He did some white chocolate chips that needed to be used up which added to the great flavor. We will have to make them again."
"1","4","Very Tastey cookie but a little flat. Almost like a lace cookie. I used butter and it seems when I do it makes my cookies flat so next time I will try margarine."
"1","5","***** Excellent! Yummy! If you like oatmeal cookies soft and chewy without being spicy then this is the recipe you want. You can't eat just one."
"1","3","Maybe I did something wrong, but these cookies turned out very flat for me. I rarely have ever had this problem baking cookies. Also, I like sweet cookies, but these were definitely too sweet for me. If I were to try these again, I'd definitely decrease the sugar. For now, I'm sticking with the recipe on the oatmeal box as I've never messed those up!"
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted. They stayed so soft and chewy even after a few days. My family loved them, including my daughter who doesn't even care for oatmeal. I didn't have cloves so just omitted that ingredient. I also forgot to add the vanilla to the first batch and they were still delicious. I did add vanilla to the second batch and they were magnificent. This recipe will be one of my regulars."
"1","5","Great recipe!!! The only addition I made was to add 1 cup of chocolate chips, but it would have been just as good without them! This would be an excellent recipe around the holiday times b/c of the hint of cinammon in the background :). Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","I added a cup of raisins to these even though I normally don't like them very much, but these were great! The bit of cinnamon really complements the raisins, and these didn't get hard or fall apart like so many oatmeal cookies I've tried. I bet lots of other mix-ins would also be good with this recipe, and I'm sure they're still really good without anything added at all!"
"1","5","There is a reason this recipe has a 5 star rating. I have tried countless oatmeal cookie recipes always to be disappointed. I made a batch of these today and can say that I have finally found the PERFECT oatmeal cookie. I too added some chocolate chips but that was it. Bake time on these were exactly 10 minutes to perfection. I think next time I may add a little peanut butter. Thank you, thank you for a great recipe."
"1","4","hmm.. my cookies came out more crispy than soft but they were really good tasting. i added chocolate chips to half of the dough, yummy!"
"1","5","Very easy recipe to follow. Been looking for years for a good oatmeal cookie for my hubby. He says they are the best amd I agree."
"1","5","You can't go wrong with an old classic. I added 1 cup raisins. This is my husband's all time favourite."
"1","5","Yumm-o! By FAR the best oatmeal cookie I've made and/or eaten! I did half chocolate chip and half Craisins.. the craisin ones were best! Thanks for the recipe.. it will be going in my keepers!"
"1","5","My 10 year old niece and I tried out these cookies......she's not a HUGE fan of Oatmeal Cookies but she liked these. We followed recipe exactly - (except for adding chocolate chips) I thought they were the BEST Oatmeal Cookies I've ever made! Recipe was easy, although we would recommend a BIG mixing bowl - it was hard to mix once the oats were added - just make sure you have a sturdy wooden spoon!"
"1","5","Makes an excellent oatmeal raisin cookie! I think that my search is over - I'll happily make these again and again. Note: I remove my cookies from the oven the second that they look just baked enough, and even I had to bake these much longer than the 8-10 minutes stated."
"1","5","These are the best!"
"1","5","This is the BEST Oatmeal Cookie I have ever made. I'm soooo proud. thank you very much for making my Husband happy too!!"
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had! The only thing I did differently was use butter flavored shortening instead of butter. They turned out perfectly! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","WOW!! This cookie recipe is great."
"1","5","Speed is necessary when I cook/bake so I didn't chill for an hour, I used a cookie scoop, and flattened them down a smidge with my fingers. I added a cup of dried cranberries instead of raisins. Despite all my shortcuts, they came out delicious! Using the scoop, I got more than 4 dozen medium size cookies."
"1","5","Everyone loved these! I followed the recipe exactly. Finally, I have the best recipe! Don't bother with the one on the Quaker Oats box. This recipe is the one you want!!"
"1","5","I substituted apple pie spice for the regular cinnamon because I like a little more spice to my oatmeal cookies, and I put in about a cup of raisins ( I don't know the exact amt, my 9-yo and I just kept adding handfuls of raisins until it looked right.) Then we put a pan of cookies in the oven and took spoonfuls of raw dough to sit down and eat. MMMMM!!! GOOD!!!"
"1","5","These are great cookies. I halved the recipe, and it still made *almost* 2 dozen LARGE cookies. Also, I added just a bit less cinnamon. The cookies came out soooo soft and chewy."
"1","5","These came out perfect and everyone loved them. I soaked the raisins first. No need to put the dough in the fridge first. Toffee bits are also good instead of raisins if people don't like them. I'll never use another oatmeal cookie recipe."
"1","5","Nice cookie. Total comfort food. I used regular oats (ie not quick cooking). I wanted to try to make them a smidge healthier (I also added chocolate chips, pecans and raisin) so tried grating 1.5 carrots into the mix. Next time I'll even try more carrot since it was not at all noticable."
"1","5","These cookies were fantastic. I used salted butter, so I decreased the salt to 1/2 t. and added about 3/4 c. each craisins and white chocolate chips.  I didn't chill the dough, just formed into balls on greased cookie sheet and baked for 7 minutes, then let cool on cookie sheet for another 5. The cookies were very moist and delicious, a hit with my toddler."
"1","5","very tasty, substituted whole wheat flour so its tasty and healthy!"
"1","5","these cookies are yum! i used whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips. They are moist, sweet and delicious. i like them on the soft side so i baked for 10 min."
"1","5","Delish! soft & chewy :-)"
"1","4","These were great! We prefer our cookies soft and chewy. I tossed in some raisins and some toffee chips I had lying around. I appreciated the tips about leaving them on the pan and squashing them with a fork."
"1","5","These cookies were just what I was looking for! I wanted an oatmeal cookie recipe that was good enough to stand on its own without raisins or chocolate chips, but also tasted good when add-ins were included. I scooped mine using a small ice cream scoop onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets, and didn't bother pressing them down before baking. My cookies were done in exactly 7 minutes. I added mini chocolate chips to the last half of the batch, and must admit, they're my favorite of the two types. Great texture and flavor."
"1","5","These turned out perfectly. I don't flatten them, added choco chips and coconut (1/4 cup). No cinnamon, extra vanilla. Perfection."
"1","5","it's great. I used 1&3/4 cups brown sugar, and 1 cup white sugar. 3&1/4 cups oatmeal. one extra egg, and 1/4 cup of milk. to make it healthier and more moist. and put it in the over for exactly 14 minutes."
"1","4","These are excellent! Do not overbake! Did add more spice!Thanks"
"1","4","Good cookie. I add about 1 cup of dried cranberries. The next time I make these I probably decrease the flour to 1.75 cups of flour. If the cookies are flattened, the cooking time only needs to be about 7 minutes. Update: I now add 1/2 tsp of cloves (halved recipe) which it gives the cookie more flavor. I also use 1 full cup of raisins (halved recipe). I also use a regular ice cream scoop to make large cookies. I flatten the cookie and bake for 12-13 minutes."
"1","5","Just wonderful. Especially the batter"
"1","5","My husband and I loved this! I made half with raisins and half w/o for him. Will make again. Thanks."
"1","5","The reason this cookie recipe has such high ratings is simple: it makes a GREAT COOKIE. I baked two batches of these to take to a potluck. I added craisins & nuts to one batch; butterscotch chips to the other. Both batches turned out wonderfully soft with just the right amount of crunch. As always...use room temperature ingredients and watch them closely in the oven. Overbaking will create a disappointing result. Thanks for passing along this wonderful cookie recipe."
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had. My daughter made the first time and accidently only put one cube of butter in the cookie. We loved the recipe and I made it again and really didn't notice the difference between one cube or two cubes. The first batch was a little salty, so if you want to cut down on the fat, just use one cube of butter and cut down a little on the salt and it tastes just as good!"
"1","5","Great cookie! Delicious flavor and perfect amount of sweetness. Texture is great too - soft and chewy with a little crunchiness from the oats. I was able to make a low fat version by substituting applesauce for the butter, but doing that does require to add an extra 1/2 - 1 cup of oats. I also mixed in a combination of raisins, chopped pecans, and dried wolfberries, and that was delicious. These cookies only spread slightly, so make them the size and flatness you want."
"1","5","Very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and have delicious cookies! Thanks so much for sharing!!"
"1","5","Very delicious cookies. Stayed very soft. I added bananas to mine and used a healthier spread instead of butter."
"1","5","wonderful... These are the best and I have made a bunch of different recipes. Try them they are so good.."
"1","5","These oatmeal cookies are delicious. The ratio of flour to oatmeal is nice - you can definitely taste the oatmeal, but not so much that it overwhelms the cookie. They turn out twice as many cookies as the recipe states, if you drop by tablespoons. When I make these I reduce the total amount of sugar by 1/2 cup so I can add mix-ins without making the cookies overly sweet. I've added white chocolate chips and cranberries, chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, and raisins. Sometimes I sprinkle in a bit of coconut as well. I would suggest leaving out the cinnamon if you make these with chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","These were wonderful! Make sure not to overcook them. Even though they might not look done do not cook them over 12 minutes."
"1","5","This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe--as others have said, a great basic that bakers can alter to take in fun, delicious directions. I'm partial to adding chocolate chips, and a friend's cookies have inspired me to add melted chocolate to make 'soft chocolate oatmeal cookies.' Even if you don't change a thing, these cookies will be a great treat."
"1","5","These cookies are Delicious. I followed the recipe but I also added Semi Sweet chocolate chips and coconut to the ingredients and it turned out EXCELLENT! Definately A Keeper."
"1","5","These are really really good. They are good if you add raisins, they are good if you add chocolate chips, cinnamon chips, butterscotch chips, or just a glass of milk! Thank you for a recipe that would deserve 7 stars!"
"1","5","It was my first time making this and it really is a simple recipe. I think it's also a forgiving recipe, so don't be afraid to try it.  I found that it helped chilling the dough, even for just 15 minutes in the refrigerator/freezer so that the dough didn't melt so quickly when rolling them into balls.   I added chocolate chip to one batch, craisins and choc chips to another, and kept one original flavour. They were far and away the tastiest cookies in our office bake off."
"1","5","I have tried all kinds of oatmeal cookie recipes, This is the BEST EVER!!!!! I added raisins and walnuts(coursely chopped) I love them. I have found my oatmeal cookie!!!"
"1","4","I added a teaspoon of almond extract came out delicious. My family raved about them."
"1","5","These turned out great. I made them with my aunt and brother as a family activity and everyone enjoyed them. They came out nice and soft as well."
"1","5","These are perfect as is, but if you want to make them slightly healthier: Substituting half whole wheat flour and adding 1/4 c flax seed didn't seem to make them any less delicious. Added craisins to half the batch and chocolate chips to the other half. YUM! Didn't look done, only the edges were brown, but took them out and they were just right (soft with crispy edges). About 9 minutes using a convection oven at 350. Had a lot of trouble creaming the sugars and butter by hand, but found that once I added the egg, it was much easier to mix. I was mixing by hand. To mix the dry ingredients with the wet, I had to use my hands, and that did the trick to get a more thorough mixing. I personally liked the saltiness of the cookie and would not add less salt. The saltiness balanced the sweetness. I did not bother chilling the dough since it was fine to work with but just a little sticky (although I used 2 extra large eggs--maybe this was the reason why it was not crumbly)."
"1","5","This cookie was so soft for an oatmeal cookie, it really surprised me! It just crumbles in your mouth. I followed the recipe, but used instant oats instead of quick cooking. I didn't chill the dough, just let it sit for 15 mins and it'll be easy to handle. I didn't grease my cookie sheets either, and the cookies slid off easily still. ADDING RAISINS IS A MUST! The sweetness and juiciness of raisins complement this cookie perfectly!"
"1","5","in my recipe i substituted the white suger with splenda. and only used less than half because splenda is much more sweet. and i used whole wheat flour instead of white all purpose. and i used about half as much brown sugar. but they still turned out great! i only made these healthier because my dad is a diabetic so next time i make these i'm definitely going to go by the actual recipe!"
"1","5","Great cookies. Quick and easy. The kids gobbled them up and couldn't wait for more. Not too greasy like other oatmeal cookies i have tried."
"1","5","These cookies were great!! I didn't change the salt amount but I will next time. Maybe 3/4 of a teaspoon. I really preffered baking them on wax paper better than aluminum foil lined cookie sheets. These have definately become one of my husbands favorites!!"
"1","5","Yum!! I followed the recipe except for switched 1/4 of the white sugar for brown. I found 8 minutes to be too undercooked, but 10 was perfect. These cookies are DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","This recipe was awesome. I didn't bother chilling the dough, and they still turned out great. If you have a stoneware baking sheet, use it, it works great for these cookies! My only recommendation is, if you are going to add chocolate chips, leave out the cinnamon."
"1","5","Easy to Make. Will use again."
"1","5","The BEST oatmeal cookies ever. I will never make another recipe. Thanks!"
"1","5","I HATE crunchy oatmeal cookies, so these were great. Everyone loves them and they didn't last long at all. Thanks."
"1","5","These were perfect oatmeal cookies.They didn't stay in the cookie jar long.I added a small box of raisins and the kids loved it."
"1","5","I've never made oatmeal cookies before and these turned out great! I added a cup of raisins. Writing the review I had to jump up and go get one."
"1","5","These cookies turned out really well....we added raisins to one half of the dough, and chocolate chips to the other half...both were great. Definitely try these!"
"1","5","This is by far the best recipe for oatmeal cookies that I have EVER tasted!! It is very close(top 3)to the best cookie recipe I have ever made (&tasted)!! And that includes every recipe with raisins or chocolate chips! this recipe is so great on it's own that i'm truly suprised! Seriously you don't need choc.chips or raisins! I did not change anything about this recipe but for a small smidge of nutmeg; but only because I believe that every recipe that includes cinnamon should have a smidge of nutmeg. Thank you soooo much for this wonderful recipe!"
"1","3","The flavor was great, but the texture wasn't soft and chewy like I expected. It was more like a scone texture."
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted! I have made these a few times now and they always turn out great. This time I added a cup of raisins. So good!"
"1","5","Wow, this was GOOD. I didn't use vanilla or cinnamon (didn't have) but they are still great. Might add chocolate chips next time =)"
"1","5","These are very good cookies, but even better with butterscotch chips. That is the only change I made. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","This recipe was a big hit with my kids, neighbors, and me. I feel good about sending one of these in my son's lunch instead of processed cookies from the store. I leave out the cinnamon, as I'm not fond of raisins, substitute dried cherries, and add nuts (any) and chocolate chunks. Yummy, and more nutritious than plain chocolate chip cookies. Not sure how long they stay chewy, because they don't stay around long."
"1","5","delish! i added some hemp seeds in it to get a little more protein and fibre. very moist!"
"1","4","Very good and soft, however I believe they should have a little less sugar."
"1","5","WOW ! i'm 36 and this is the 1st time ever i've made oatmeal cookies, duh ! And this might be the 1st and last recipe i'll use. They are GREAT, soft and chewy and a little crispy on the outside edges, I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 and a bit cups of oats, and they were regular oats, i don't know if this made a difference, i'll probably try it with quick oats to find out. Mine were in the fridge chilling for hours, cus i fell asleep, so i let them soften up a bit and i also did flatten with a LARGE serving fork dipped in sugar. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have spread on their own. You have to make these, they are great with a cold glass of milk !"
"1","3","My family wants soft cookies so I tried this recipe. The taste overall is pretty good and I added butterscotch chips to the dough as well. However maybe I should have removed them from the oven sooner or maybe its my oven I dont know but they werent soft. They were right out of the oven but as soon as they cooled down they werent soft anymroe. They do make a great crisp cookie but they didnt stay soft which was dissapointing."
"1","5","Very good oatmeal cookie recipe. Baked them for 8 min and they turned out perfect. They were almost too sweet, though. I think reducing the sugar would be a good idea next time I make them. I will be using this recipe again for sure."
"1","5","There's nothing better in the world than a soft oatmeal cookie - and these definitely take the cake! Talk about EASY to make and even EASIER to eat! Everyone was in awe of how soft these were - and how they stayed soft for days! Love this recipe - will use many more times! I cooked them a little longer than the recipe called for to ensure they stayed together."
"1","5","Hands down the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe ever! Family favorite! This will be passed down for generations to come - thanks!"
"1","5","Not being an oatmeal cookie fan, I called in a couple of experts for their opinions--my DH and best friend. They both thought they were delicious, some of the best they've ever had. My kids loved them too. I thought they were pretty good. Add some chocolate chips and now you're talking! LOL I made the first batch with raisins soaked in water for about 20 minutes. I added 1/2 tsp. of cloves, used very soft salted butter, and for the first pan, chilled about 30 minutes. They spread *way* too thin. Had to pick them up carefully or they'd fall apart. So I chilled for the full hour, didn't flatten the cookies, and the next tray was a little better, but still too flat. So the next day I omitted the raisins and switched to sweet butter (salted butter has a higher moisture content), and chilled the dough for several hours. I didn't flatten them before baking. They were still a little flatter than I'd like, but good nonetheless. All cookies were baked for 9 minutes. I give this recipe 5 stars because it's easy, the measurements are nice round numbers, and all the oatmeal cookie fans thought they were the best! Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Great cookies! They were crispy and chewy. Nobody believed I'd baked them myself. Made a fantastic 2nd batch by adding dried cranberries."
"1","5","Excellent Recipe! My family loved them. Takes a little time but well worth it! This is the only 'Soft' Oatmeal Cookies that my Daddy can eat! Thanks Alot!!"
"1","5","YUM, YUM, YUM! I made this to take to church and they all disappeared within a matter of minutes! I made half with raisins and half without and they were both scrumptious!"
"1","5","i saw this & thought it would be the perfect thing to satisfy my son's craving for oatmeal cookies. i stuck to the basic recipe but used half light & half dark brown sugars then half old fashioned oats & half quick oats for appearance & to boost the fiber content. i also stirred in 1 cup of golden raisins & a handful of finely chopped walnuts. lastly i rolled the dough to the size of a ping pong ball & got twice as many cookies (bake for 8 minutes). we love the crispy edges & chewy inside! many thanks barbara!"
"1","5","I did this cookies with some changes, i add some raisins and replace half of the butter with shortening, they are just exquisite!"
"1","4","great recipe... i reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and added a bit of nutmeg. also, baked on parchment paper to reduce risk of sticking. they came out moist and chewy. great!"
"1","3","It was hard to pick from all the other recipes out there, but I thought given its reviews I'd give this a try. Although tasty, it was missing a zing, and not gobbled up by my family as Mrs. Fields or other oatmeal cookies I've bought. So I'll still be on the lookout for a soft - but not doughy- oatmeal cookie!"
"1","5","These had really good flavor - mine were a little on the dry side though, perhaps I baked them too long or it was because I used one of those 5-grain-flax-super-hippie oatmeals. I'd make'em again though to try and perfect them. Happy baking!"
"1","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever found. It is so versatile. If you want them crispy just bake them longer, as I did by accident. I prefer them soft and chewy. I overbaked them and they came out golden brown and still somewhat soft in the middle. Not at all ruined, just crispier. I used toasted pecans, golden raisins and coconut. Next time I will use a little spice. With this recipe as a base you can have them anyway you want."
"1","5","this cookies are so good, and the recipe yields what seems like an endless supply. they're perfect: not too sweet and just a little spicy. my mom likes them so much that she had to hide them from herself."
"1","3","These cookies do not taste like oatmeal cookies. The taste is okay but I was expecting it to be alot better. I followed the recipe exactly and I am a little disappointed about the taste of this cookie. Won't be making this one again."
"1","5","i made these to give away for christmas. really soft and chewy. i added walnuts to have of the dough and it complemented the oats. was pleasantly surprised because one recipe yielded 6 dozens =)"
"1","5","Good. I added some nutmeg and ground cloves. My kids loved them."
"1","5","These cookies were GREAT! They didnt last long with 3 kids and a hungry husband, Everyone of us enjoyed them."
"1","5","Loved these cookies. I cut back on the sugar a little bit, and added soaked raisins and choc chips. Cookies did not spread at all, and were soft as named. Thank you for posting."
"1","5","Usually I use Beth Sigworth's wonderful oatmeal cookie recipe from this site, but felt like trying out something new. Absolutely wonderful! Terrific recipe. Thanks!"
"1","5","Soft...chewy... DEEEEEEELICIOUS!! ...and easy to make!"
"1","5","Simply wonderful. So moist and chewy. However, I do not cool the dough and roll. I just drop by tablespoons right away and bake. I take them out as soon as they are lightly browned."
"1","5","these were outstanding! my 12 yr old daughter and i made them together. we increased the amt of vanilla to 2 tsp and added raisins. gonna try with dried cranberries next."
"1","5","Easy & Delicious"
"1","5","The whole dorm loved these."
"1","5","I added the touch of iced cookies by mixing 1/2 c. confectioners sugar and a tablesppon of milk, mixed well. After the cookies baked and cooled most of the way I drizzled on the icing. Very professional looking cookie. They were super simple to make and I was already asked to make them again - they were only half gone!"
"1","5","I live in Mo. and the best oatmeal cookies are sold at the st. louis bread Co. So I thought..... This recipe is WOW! I did use only a 1/2c. sugar and 1 1/2c. brn sugar.Love recipe will use again, real SOON:)"
"1","4","Good cookies! I spooned out golfball size for these cookies, & they turned out nice & big! baked for 10 min. exact. Perfect! Next time I'll try adding macadamia nuts."
"1","5","Love them! Added only 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the full cup. I scooped them out in round tablespoons and then lightly pressed each one down to get a nice even baked cookie. Average cook time for me was 9 minutes. They were very soft!"
"1","5","Really good cookies! Definate keeper--Did go with the 1 1/4 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c. white sugar-for a softer cookie. Added mini chocolate chips one time for my son and made them with plumped raisins and nuts for my husband--many many request for this recipe. great!"
"1","5","This is AWESOME. I did the 1 and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of white sugar thing and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I put in almost a full bag of Heath bar bits, but I dont think it needed it. I may do chocolate chips next time. It tastes like the crumble on top of apple crisp, which as we all know is totally rad. I baked almost all of it, but saved the rest of the dough to eat raw because MAN this tastes good. That's all that needs to be said!"
"1","5","These are REALLY good cookies. I did follow some advice from the others such as DO NOT over bake...(8 min. was fine for me )add more brown sugar then white and 2 tsp. of vanilla. I also used chocolate chips (2 cups). I will use this again for sure."
"1","5","I liked this recipe as is, though I thought I would share another way to vary it -- Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal Cookies. Using this recipe, I added 1 to 1 1/2 cups of peeled, shredded apple with the oats. The juice from the apple will water the dough a good bit, so there are two options. 1) squeeze a little of the juice from the apple prior to adding to dough or 2) add enough flour (approx 1/2 cup) until the consistency returns to normal. I prefer to chill longer than an hour, maybe over night, to allow the apple to incorporate but it's not absolutely necessary to extend the chilling time. Hope you enjoy!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe!!! I always use more brown sugar than white in cookies (keeps them more moist), so I modified the sugars to 1 1/4 brown, 3/4 white. I did a batch with cinnamon chips and a batch with Craisins and pecans. A co-worker who is the same age as my mom said that they were the best oatmeal cookies she ever had. WOW!!!"
"1","5","This is now my favorite Oatmeal recipe. I had to modify it a bit since i ran out of butter so i used shortening so i didnt have to rest it and i added nutmeg. These cookies made the whole house smell soo good and i know they wont last long. Thanx for the recipe. SOOOOO GOOD ;)"
"1","5","Best oatmeal cookie ever I did not have butter so I used butter flovord crisco, and added 2TBS of watter and they turend out perfectly I cooked them for 8min."
"1","5","These are so good!! I have never had any luck with oatmeal cookies. They are always too dry or too dense, but not these. They were nice and soft and tasted very good. My whole family really liked them."
"1","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I ever had...everyone at work is crazy about them.. I have to bake batches about twice a week. The secret is not to over cook them.. yummy!!!!!"
"1","5","These were great. Hubby loves them and they are easy and healthy for a little one to eat! I only added 1 cup of coconut to the exact recipe. I think next time I will only add 1 Tsp. of cinnamon though. Thanxs for sharing!"
"1","5","These cookies were Excellent! We all loved them. I followed the recipe as written and they turned out great. Will make these again. I did add about a cup of raisins either way these would be great cookies."
"1","5","This recipe yielded beautiful plump, soft, chewy cookies! It's our new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. The only changes I made were to substitute 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' for regular butter, I used 1 cup of regular flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and I use 1/3 cup less white sugar. They were wonderful! We will definitely have these again!"
"1","5","This is absolutely the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe. I omitted the cinnamon as I'm not a big fan of it and I didn't refridgerate the dough just spooned it out onto the tray. I could have eated the entire batch myself but the kids and husband kept taking them..."
"1","5","I just made these for my husband who loves oatmeal cookies. He can't stop eating, they are so good. I added a cup of raisins and soaked them in egg and vanilla (like someone recommended in one of the reviews) and they came out great. Soft and chewy, awesome!"
"1","5","great recipe. really soft and chewy, and super easy to make. baking instructions are perfect!"
"1","5","These were absolutely wonderful. Very soft. I followed the ingredients and there was no need to change anything. Perfect oatmeal raisin-less cookie if you don't like raisins in them, like I don't. Thanks for the great recipe~!"
"1","4","The cookie dough was very crumbly, so the cookies were more crispy than soft. Also, I found that smooshing them with a fork before baking just made them crack, so I ended up smooshing when they were in the oven. Despite all of this, these cookies were VERY good! Will make again"
"1","5","Good turn out! I added chocolate chips to it, and they are great! Tried them with raisins and even better!!! Only put in 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Definitely will make them again!"
"1","5","Exellent cookies! Perfect flovor and texture.The longest hour of my life waiting for the dough to chill lol."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe! I added Craisins and chopped almonds and it was wonderful. I will make this again and again!"
"1","4","VERY GOOD!"
"1","5","I would give this recipe 6 stars if i could! It was absolutely perfect. I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup rasins and left out the cinnamon. For the flour i did 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour. This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe! Thanks so much!"
"1","5","Wow, these are some yummy cookies. I brought them to work and everyone thought they were delicious. I read some of the reveiws before baking and I have to say I disagree that these cookies are bland, they are very flavorfull. Also, I didn't think they were ugly or looked under cooked at all. I also used old fashion oats because I didn't have the instant and added some raisins and butterscotch chips (just a few) all in all these are the best oatmeal cookies I've every made."
"1","4","The look of the cookies is ok, need some frosting, becasue they are not as brown as the store one, maybe my 10 mins is not enough. It does not taste very sweet. A plus, becasue my guest all on diet after Chrsitmas. They prefer not over sweet. The cookies taste like the package you bought from the store., just more soft and less sweet. However, they are not as good as what I had before ,really soft after hours.  Definitely will try again to get the softness and add some more sweetness for myself.  The ingredient made a lot, maybe I am making them small ball (like a small walnut size), I had 42 pieces."
"1","5","I tried this recipe yesterday and all I can say is YUMMY! The cookies turned out soft and round. The only things I changed was using 1 cup of light margarine than 1 cup of butter to try and cut out some of the fat. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of salt. The only advice I can give is to make sure you watch the clock so that the cookies won’t over bake! Definitely a recipe I will keep."
"1","5","These are so yummy! I am not a big oatmeal cookie fan, however, I really liked these. I added a cup of cooking raisins. This is the second time I have made these and everyone loves them!"
"1","4","Well, I hope I'm not doing this cookie an injustice, but I won't know until I try a lot more oatmeal cookie recipes :) This one is great. My fiance loves them and I just finished making a second batch (just made the first only a few days ago. I did increase the oats just a little and the cinnamon."
"1","5","I am just about finished baking these cookies for the first time. I made half the recipe as written (no variations), and didn't bother chilling the dough. I got 36 small cookies out of it, and must say, they are truly delicious. Nice and moist, chewy, and flavourful! I'll be making these again. And for those who are on Weight Watchers, those 36 cookies are only 1.5 points each!!"
"1","4","I froze half the cookie dough for later use, but when I baked the one batch of dough for 8 minutes, they were not soft. Browned a little around edges...I would definitely keep an eye on your cookies and not overcook them. Otherwise a good recipe. Added golden raisins, 1.25 Cup."
"1","4","These were pretty good. I added some chocolate chips for the men of the house, but I will probably leave them out the next time I make them."
"1","5","the softest ccokie I ever made & oh so good"
"1","5","This cookie recipe is SO AWESOME! I made ALOT of cookies with this because my mom likes them small. They are packed full of flavor and they are so deliciously chewy! I had to add a little more flour cuz the dough was a little runny the first time I made them, but it's better now! I added pumpkin pie spice (it's up to you guys how much you want to add; I use a little like a 1/4 tsp.) Be careful with the cinnamon, it sort of overwhelmes the taste. The oatmeal does have a tendency to seperate from the dough, though. So if you really want to have some oatmeal taste in your mouth, add more. Overall a BOMBING recipe that deserves some extra recognition!"
"1","5","These cookies ROCK! I think the key is making sure the dough is cooled before cooking them!! They turned out really chewy and delicious! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
"1","5","delicious. i used 1 T less butter (i was a bit short) and dark brown sugar, plus pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon. so good.  even my calorie-counting roommates couldn't resist.  also, i cut the recipe in half and it worked just fine."
"1","5","I thought these oatmeal cookies were great! I was out of cinnamon and only had regular old-fashioned oats so I went with what I had. I skipped the chilling and rolling and used my small cookie scoop instead. As another reviewer noted these have a butterscotch flavor that I found delightful. The old fashioned oats added an interesting texture that I enjoyed. This recipe is a keeper in my house!"
"1","5","Totally delicious. I disagree with the reviews calling them 'bland' - I didnt put any chips or fruits in mine and I thought they were excellent. The cooking of hte brown sugar along with the butter (although I used half butter, half margarine) gives a subtle butterscotch flavor to the cookies. Also, I added a little Almond Extract, and that worked well to give it a tiny kick.  Very chewy - YUM!"
"1","4","Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made - and that says a lot! They would be even better with some chips or raisins as they are a bit bland without."
"1","3","I was a little dissapointed with this cookie. I found it rather bland tasting. I had to throw out half the batch, as they sat in the cookie jar for weeks! I don't think I would make these again. If I ever do I would definately add 1 or maybe even 2 cups of raisins, if anything just to give these cookies a little flavor!"
"1","5","These were great! I made these for my husband because he loves oatmeal cookies. I usually do not care for them, but thought these tasted very good. I didn't need to refrigerate them before baking."
"1","5","these cookies were really chewy and tasted great. An awesome altennative to the boring, regular chocolate chip."
"0","5","These cookies are awesome. I followed the recipe except that I added dried cranberries"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious and are a favourite of my husband. I change the spice a little changing it to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 Tsp of nutmeg . I also add coconut. I also add either raisins or chocolate chips. Thanks for this wonderful recipe"
"0","4","they taste amazing! However, the recipe was too sweet for me, I deducted some of the sugar but it was still too sweet. I also accidentally baked them longer than I should have and they came out crunchier on the outside ( which I have no problem with) overall great recipe and my mom really likes it!! thanks for posting."
"0","5","delicious. I added dried cherries and they were amazing"
"0","4","Very convenient recipe to use up stuff I already had on hand. Would make a decent lunch box treat. I used this recipe because I had a store brand quick oats box without a printed cookie recipe!"
"0","5","Love this!!!"
"0","4","No need to chill, just cook for 7 min. they are also really good with a tsp and a 1/2 of ground ginger and 2 tsp of orange zest"
"0","5","I made some with raisins and half without they came delicious. Great recipe."
"0","5","Great recipe! The only change I make is to use Old Fashioned Rolled Oats (NOT Quick Oats) because it makes a chewier cookie. I also use a small ice cream scooper to drop the dough on the sheet. Do not press it flat and it makes a nice, thick, chewy cookie. I have made these several times and play around with the goodies inside...Some of our household favorites are: walnut and chocolate chip, Toffee Chip, and coconut flakes with almonds."
"0","5","wow! this is a great help. this is my very first recipe to try baking.. thank you"
"0","4","Very easy to make and taste fantastic"
"0","5","The most perfect cookie recipe i have ever tried!"
"0","5","Still chewy even after a few days (what was left of them) and still delicious. I did make some changes, though. I upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and added an extra 3/4 cup of flour because I live at a high altitude. I also experimented a bit: I used 1/2 cup packed Truvia Brown Sugar instead of the full 1 cup of packed sugar. I may add even less than that because the Truvia sugar is very prominent in taste, but still very good. Definitely great with chocolate chips!"
"0","5","Very good! The only thing I did different was added raisins. I flattened the first batch but I like a more thick chewy cookie! Will definitely make these again."
"0","5","I used 3/4 cup honey instead of the white sugar and added a cup of walnuts! Delish!"
"0","5","Sooooo good! I baked for 8 minutes so they'd still be chewy in the middle. Not a cookie is left and I just made them - should have made the full batch instead of half the recipe!  Thanks for sharing, yummy!"
"0","5","I loved it! They were very good but a little dry. I also edited the recipe by taking half of it and added butterscotch chips I can easily see myself making this again! I also wish you didn't have to let them sit in the fridge for an hour! The wait is unbearable!"
"0","5","Super yummy! Moist and soft"
"0","5","I added a cup of shredded zucchini and they were moist and very yummy. I didn't flatten them though."
"0","5","Simple to make! I added pecans and raisins and they were delicious! I also added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. Like many reviews said, you don't need to flatten them. I ruled them into balls and let them bake! They also stayed nice and soft for 2 days after baking. I high recommend."
"0","5","Very soft and moist, I enjoyed making these for my family."
"0","5","so easy and very good! I added chopped walnuts, and in half the dough, I added raisins."
"0","5","They're amazing if you throw in 1 to 2 cups of chocolate chips :)"
"0","4","Great and easy recipe. They were delicious. I add chocolate chips to mine. I was looking for a golden finish so I left it in oven longer. Bad idea because the next day, they were hard. I'll follow the 8-10 mins next time."
"0","4","Very good! The spices were not overwhelming. I'm not sure you really need to roll them out and could probably just use a cookie scoop. You could add raisins too."
"0","5","So, I halved the recipe and still made 24 cookies. I used all of the same ingredients, except used Stevia rather than white sugar. I did this because I wanted to make them low-cal (3 WW points per cookies). AND, I just pulled them out of the oven! THE VERDICT: delicious and soft! Wonderful with a cold glass of milk!!"
"0","5","This is one of those recipes that I go back to again and again because it's delicious exactly as written, yet wonderfully versatile as well. I have made these cookies several times and added 1 cup of chopped pecans on one occasion; 1 cup of raisins (soaked in boiling water then well drained) another time; or 1 cup of dried cranberries or blueberries a different day -- OR any combination thereof. Next time I intend to add chocolate chips or maybe dried apricots. Feel free to experiment, knowing that this cookie recipe is an excellent foundation."
"0","5","These are just perfect oatmeal cookies. I did add one cup of raisins. I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla because I do not put cinnamon in my oatmeal cookies. This is a really good recipe and I did not even refrigerate the dough."
"0","5","Great recipe. Family loved them. Added 1/2 cup choc chips. Would definitely make again."
"0","4","These are a nice cookies. I didn't flatten mine and they were crisp on the outside and tender inside. I reduced the white sugar by half, & I used half light and half dark brown sugar. I also increased the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp, and the vanilla to 1 tbsp. I added chocolate chips and pecans. I then baked the cookies at 350 for 8 minutes, rotating halfway.   Thanks for the recipe, I am planning to make it again :)"
"0","5","so good soft crunchy edge no need to chill better with out pressing with sugar fork"
"0","5","Followed the recipe but added walnuts to the last tray. VERY chewy and delicious!"
"0","5","These cookies are so easy to make and they taste great!!! I brought them to a get together and a man came up to me to let me know they taste good and they were already all gone. I had to cook them for 12 minutes, maybe its because my oven is 30+ years old."
"0","5","These cookies are so amazing and so chewy!"
"0","2","Definateley needs some milk in the recipe"
"0","5","We really enjoy these cookies and give 5 stars. However, I still feel like it's missing ever so slightly a little something that I can't put my finger on. I think I wish they cooked up a little thicker than they do, but I wonder if that had anything to do with the modifications I made. I substituted whole wheat flour entirely for the all purpose and the cookies were still great! I also used rolled oats versus the quick cooking - again, that worked out fine. I did not refrigerate the dough for very long, and I simply dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet. I will definitely make these again, and next time might try refrigerating the dough as suggested to hopefully help make a thicker cookie, and I will likely add raisins and/or pecans."
"0","5","I have become famous for my oatmeal cookies; THESE oatmeal cookies. So easy to make and so moist inside, crispy outside. Perfect."
"0","5","Awesome!!! I add 2 cups of oats and 1 cup of ghiradele chocolate chips"
"0","1","Sorry but the only positive part was that it was moist. It tasted like cardboard."
"0","5","Very soft and chewy! I used coconut sugar instead of white or brown sugar. For health concious people you can actually swap butter to coconut oil. It will turn out the same.."
"0","4","I'm not a big oatmeal raisin fan but I needed to make some for a party. I made these per the directions exect for giving them time in the fridge and doing drop cookies with raisins. Next time I will take the extra time to flatten them some. I wouldn't recommend cutting back the sugar, we thought they could have used some more or extra raisins for sweetness. I also found these had a great taste but were not 'moist' if anything they were on the drier side. I will try adding more butter add/or eggs next time."
"0","5","These were awesome! They came out absolutely perfect. I got rave reviews and will definitely keep this as my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe."
"0","5","I made these yesterday exactly as the recipe stated and they turned out fabulous! There was no need to chill the dough and I flattened only half. They turned out great either way but next time I won't flatten them at all! Mmm.. Soft yummy oatmeal cookies!"
"0","4","Followed advice to cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup since I didn't want them too sweet. Also added raisins, and craisins to a small portion. Did not press the cookies flat as I was going for soft instead of crunchy. It worked! The cookies spread perfectly and didn't run together. Cooking time was 9 mins for each mini batch (only had 1 sheet). I'm not a big oatmeal raisin fan (these were for hubby) and I've been snacking on them like crazy!   Changes I'd make next time: Make the balls of dough bigger for a larger cookie, and *maybe* use the full amount of white sugar called for."
"0","5","Perfect the way they are!"
"0","5","If my husband loves this cookie, then that's all I need to know!!!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe. I substituted regular flour with king Arthur's all purpose GF flour and tossed in dash o flax (about 1/4 cup) and a handful of walnuts. They are perfect! No one can tell they are GF or that I added ground flax seeds. Keeper for my book!"
"0","5","Great recipe, super moist. I added raisins, dried cranberries, and chocolate chips in different batches. All where great."
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't have enough butter (only 1/2 cup), so I used 1/2 cup Crisco Shortening as well. After reading the reviews about them being crunchy if pressed, I decided to not press them before putting them in the oven and it resulted in nicely-shaped and soft cookies. Also, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVER-COOK THEM! 9 1/2 minutes is the exact amount of time you need.   If you make the doughballs walnut-size, your looking at at about 50 (3/2)-inch cookies."
"0","5","I just took a batch of these out of the oven, and OH MY!! This will be my husband's favorite!   After reading the reviews I did change the white sugar to 1/2 Cup. Other than that my only deviation was to add the zest of 1 orange and a generous cup of craisins and chopped walnuts. They are wonderful!! I have been trying to make soft oatmeal cookies forever but my other recipes always turned out crisp."
"0","5","Loved them. Added raisins . Next time will add chocolate chips. Very yummy"
"0","5","I took some others reviews and added crasins and I left out the last step with the sugar and fork. They were soft and yummy!"
"0","5","Made this as a welcome home treat for dad who came home from a short hospital stay and was on a relatively high fibre diet. I was worried he wouldn't touch these because of the amount of oats in them and the amount of chew that goes with oatmeal. But surprisingly he ate them one after another! These are picky eater dad approved! 5/5!"
"0","5","Fantastic! We did make a few changes. I had some crushed graham crackers I wanted to use up, so I substituted one cup of them for one of the cups of oats. Then I also substituted 1/2 cup of a hemp/flax mixture for 1/2 cup of oats. So I only put 1 1/2 cups of oats in. We also added about 1/8 cup of chia seeds for a small healthy boost. They turned out wonderful! We will definitely be making these again! :)"
"0","5","This oatmeal cookie recipe is the best that I have tried thus far! I followed other reviewers' suggestions: 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate, and kept the cookies round for a moist cookie. SCOOP SIZE: Medium cookie scoop (1.5 Tbsp of dough) BAKE TIME: 12 mins. The cookies came out slightly crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle. Enjoy!!"
"0","5","Great recipe."
"0","5","My family loves these. My kids devoured the ones I made with chocolate chips, but I preferred the ones with raisins. The cookies are a tad sweet for my taste, so I would probably cut back on that a bit next time. The texture of these cookies is PERFECT if you take them out of the oven when you first see them browning on the tops. Great recipe! Also, I didn't chill the dough, grease the cookie sheet, or flatten the cookies. No need."
"0","4","tried this for the first time and they were a little salty,so when I make them again I will use only 3/4 teaspoon instead of 1 teaspoon,other than that I really like it,and I baked them for 10 full minutes.."
"0","1","It was too dry and so hard my grandmother couldn't eat it."
"0","3","werent soft"
"0","5","Fabulous cookies! I had these Costco bought Quaker oats packets sitting at home which my entire family had tired of... So I used 6 packets of maple and brown sugar flavoured oats... Some other changes to the recipe were no cinnamon (didn't want it to clash with the maple flavour) and no brown sugar."
"0","5","There cookies are perfect. I didn't flattened cookies. They were perfect without the flattening. or more sugar."
"0","5","Super delicious! Super soft! Raves from everyone!"
"0","5","best recipe for oatmeal cookies i have ever tried!"
"0","5","My go- to recipe for oatmeal cookies. customize any way, depending on whom I am baking for!"
"0","4","I followed this recipe to a T and my whole family found it too sweet. If you're going to make two dozen cookies, use 1.5 cups instead. Otherwise it came out really nice, chewy and soft."
"0","3","This isn't my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. It's definitely chewy but Seems like it's missing something else. Would be better with coconut, chocolate chips or nuts."
"0","5","Best Oatmeal Cookie Recipe! Just like my Granny made! Very soft and chewy I added walnuts and raisins to the batter and didn't press these cookies with a sugared fork also added only a pinch of salt. Perfect recipe highly recommend. Don't know what I would do without all recipes.com"
"0","5","Really soft and sweet! I didn't use sugar to top them and I also used rice flour because of food allergies. These cookies were awesome even without nuts, raisins, or chocolate."
"0","4","Great recipe but I cut both the white and brown sugar down to 1/2 cups."
"0","2","These cookies are not moist and not soft. I followed the instructions except I used a little less flour and about 1/2 cup less oatmeal. They came out crispy on the bottom and thick. The taste was very good but I won't make these again."
"0","5","Homemade cookies are always best because its all about the love that goes into the making and baking."
"0","4","It came out great thanks for sharing! Only thing I would recommend is 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup for the kiddies :-)."
"0","5","Made 1/2 a batch of these tonight because my teenage son and my husband were in the mood for cookies. Was going to take a picture but they are all gone ...! Need I say more?"
"0","5","Great recipe, I have actually made it many times. I follow the recipe exactly except I use old fashion oats, and my family loves it. We don't like raisins either, but they are good with this cookie (it's good with chips, nuts, craisins, or even plain). I made a batch today and made them into bars, which I liked even better. I also drizzled a bit of homemade icing on them and they were delicious."
"0","5","I was getting drunk off purple beer and four lokos and wanted some cookies to soak it up a bit so I can go do round two and I found this recipe to be very good. I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and a dab extra vanilla extract for more flavor. They were very tasty. I'm now hoping that the milk I had with them doesn't turn to cottage cheese in my belly, when it mixes with the purple beer, four lokos and the vodka I'm about to drink."
"0","5","This was really good! My mom always buys oatmeal cookies because their her favorite. The other day I told her I would make her some. I found this recipe and she loved them! No more buying box oatmeal cookies!"
"0","2","I followed the directions, and these were hard and dry."
"0","5","Killer!!!!"
"0","5","I took the other reviewers advice not to press down on the dough with a fork. It flatten on its own. Either than that I follow the recipe to point and it came out delicious! My husband rave about the cookies and suggested to add raisins. I'll be adding those to my second batch. Thank you so much for the recipe !!!!!"
"0","5","my kids love these things, and they are my go to recipe for any bake sale or any classroom parties. one thing that helps to keep them looking like they came from a bakery is once you've formed the walnut sized cookie dough balls. make an OK sign using your thumb and index finger and using the same fingers from the other hand press into 3/4 inch thick flat discs. my kids always tell me its the first tray to be emptied."
"0","5","the recipe came out fine I made half with raisins and the other half without I made mine a little large because I don't like little small cookies. it was a little too sweet for me who don't like sweets to begin with; the next time I will alter the sugar part in the recipe overall it was really good."
"0","5","This was very easy to bake ... I added some walnuts and chocolate chips it came out very moist and crunchy .. I will def make more"
"0","5","I used everything except baking soda & added a little more sugar. They came out so good!!"
"0","5","taste very good, slightly dry"
"0","5","Totally love this recipe so easy, fun and tasty. :)"
"0","4","This recipe is amazing great flavor my family loved them will make them again."
"0","3","I liked them. I used truvia for the white sugar. I added almond slivers.   These were VERY sweet.  Next time I will used 2/3s the sugar."
"0","3","These cookies are okay.Got my hopes up,now disappointed!"
"0","4","Good"
"0","4","Cookies came out good, but how do I make them have less body? They came out somewhat fluffy, I was looking for something more chewy."
"0","5","My families favourite cookie. Good with chocolate chips, coconut or just plain. They don't last long enough to get old. We substitute brown rice flour for all purpose flour to make it gluten free for our family (I use gf oatmeal as well)."
"0","5","Great, flavorful cookie. Like others before me, I was able to add in extras (1/3 batch had chocolate chip, 1/3 batch had craisins and white chocolate chips, 1/3 left pain). All versions were great! I didn't chill the dough but am happy with how they turned out. Maybe next time I will to see what I was missing out on!"
"0","5","Excellent, easy recipe. They turned out great! I baked them a few minutes longer for medium instead of soft texture. I also divided the dough into three and made three kinds, raisins, pecans and plain. All were tasty and enjoyed by everyone who tried them. I'll definitely use this recipe again! I really like that I didn't need a mixer or anything out of the ordinary to make them perfect!"
"0","5","My boyfriend loves Oatmeal cookies. These are a dream to him."
"0","5","Excellent. Fast. Short on time, I had to skip the refrigeration and the ball and squish steps, they still came out great. Used 4 teaspoons of vanilla, can't help myself. I love that flavor. Sitting on the counter all day, still soft and delicious."
"0","5","I added a 1/4 cup more of flour and didn't wait for dough to chill. I also used one stick of Imperial Brand margarine and one stick regular butter. I really think that made a significant difference in the softness of dough. It still turned out phenomenal and is most definitely the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've used. I'll be using again!"
"0","5","This was the best recipe I've ever used for these cookies!! They need the full 10 minutes to bake and as soon as they came out of the oven I sprinkled them with a cinnamon and sugar mixture. Delicious!!"
"0","4","Like the recipe as is. Sometimes I add a couple dashes of nutmeg and allspice along with raisins."
"0","5","Delicious recipe! Did not change any of the directions, is great as is."
"0","5","this is a really good recipe i did not dip my fork into sugar i did leave the mix in the freg for a hour and it still stuck to my hands i also add 1/2 teaspoons of apple pie spice into it i took the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon out and only put in apple did a 1 teaspoons of cinnamon in and it is really good i also add 1 cup of raisin in and it make a good holiday dessert i also did not spray the cookie sheet i put sliver foil and that was enough to keep it from sticking"
"0","5","Don't use 3 cups of oats! I used 2 and chilled overnight. I added 1.5 cups raisins. These turn out soft and stay moist for days!"
"0","5","Wow!!! Made this recipe as is adding raisins to half the dough and chocolate chips to the other half. All was great because none are left. This recipe is going in my box!!!"
"0","5","delicious as is! they've gotten rave reviews so far. when i was making them i was concerned it was too much sugar but they ended up not being overly sweet. I didn't press the cookies and just cooked them til the tops didn't look shiny and they were perfectly soft and chewy. I did add a little more cinnamon, but that's just my preference."
"0","5","I tried this recipe and I think they were AMAZING!! BUT, I did add a few things and I agree with the other reviewers and added less salt (1/2 tsp). I did add 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda, I also used the 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon but then added 1/2 tsp of ground allspice,and 1/4 tsp ground cloves. I used Quaker Old Fashioned Oats instead of Quick Cooking and added 1 Cup chopped pecans. These cookies spread nicely, and then flattened out as they cooled. My oven runs a little cool, so I set the temp to 375 degrees F and left them in the oven until they were golden brown. That required baking them for 12-14 min. instead of the recommended 8-10. Finally the other thing I did a little differently was to use a 1 inch cookie/ice cream scoop. I cooked them on a sheet of parchment on the cookie sheet and it was not necessary to flatten them. They spread really nicely. While they were slightly warm, my husband an I ate a half dozen sitting there. They were warm and chewy. Later when they had fully cooled, they got a little more crisp, but still had some chew to them. My husband said they were the best oatmeal cookies he ever had. I highly recommend this recipe and I added it to the family recipe book we keep for ourselves online. This is the only recipe I will use from now on. Thanks for posting this recipe!!!"
"0","4","Cookies baked perfectly but too sweet for me... I will bake them again with half the sugar. I bet they will be delicious!"
"0","5","Great recipe! As another reviewer did, I used a drop cookie method, rather than making balls. They had a nice spread, during baking, and we soft and moist. I also substituted butter-flavored shortening, for the butter. I also added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup coconut. They enhanced the sweetness, just enough, and the coconut helped make them extra chewy and held them together, so they didn't crumble. Will add this recipe to my must use recipes."
"0","4","I have been looking for a soft oatmeal cookie for quite some time. These were a close as I've been to what I am looking for. They tasted a little more 'floury' than I would prefer, but I would definitely make them again!"
"0","5","Used old fashioned oats and still came out great but a bit heartier. Like others have said, adjust cooking time down for a moister cookie or up for more crunch."
"0","4","Turned out hard and crunchy (no matter when they were taken out of the oven). I didnt add the vanilla, instead a TON of cinnamon. I took the advice of others, I didnt press them down with sugar or grease the baking sheet (there was enough of both in the recipe!) Besides not being soft....they were actually really great!!! Will definately make them again!"
"0","5","These oatmeal cookies are bomb! I made them twice now, both times were amazing! Although I spooned them out much larger than called for, I didnt flatten them or put any extra sugar on the cookies. I think that most likely made a difference for the 'soft' texture you're looking for."
"0","5","Great Recipe! Many of the recipes I have tried before are crispy, and I do not like that in an oatmeal cookie. I added 1 cup of raisins, and baked them for 10 minutes, although I had used my large cookie scoop, and ended up with 45 decent sized cookies. I will be making these again!"
"0","5","nice, soft and chewy! Perfect!"
"0","5","This is a perfect recipe. I added chopped dates and almonds and these turned out so good!!"
"0","4","I added a teaspoon of ground ginger,1 cup of craisins and 1 cup of chopped pecans. They were fantastic. The ginger woke them up abit."
"0","5","Love this recipe! Simple and delicious!"
"0","5","LOVE IT . Simple. Straight. To. The. Point. (:"
"0","5","Great recipe! Ever since I made these my family keep's asking for more. Thank's! Michael"
"0","5","Yum!! I made them almost just as the recipe said except that I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips. They are moist and deliciously cinnamon-y. I used to use the recipe on the Quaker Oats container but no more - I think these are much better. I felt that maybe refrigerating the dough did something to make them better so I did it even between batches. Highly recommend!!"
"0","5","I made these with my kids and they were a hit! I didn't smash them down, I left them as a ball and they came out PERFECT!"
"0","5","One of my new favorites! I halved the recipe and it still made lots of cookies! I didn't flatten them with a fork I just rolled the dough into balls and mine came out nice and round and had the perfect thickness. I was afraid these would be dry and without flavor but they were so good and perfectly sweet! The cinnamon is a very nice touch and they weren't dry or hard at all!"
"0","5","Made these for a school party. They were delicious. Soft and chewy. I did not use nuts because they were for a school function, but would probably be good with nuts, chocolate chips, or raisins. I will definitely make this recipe again."
"0","4","Very good recipe! Moist and large oatmeal cookies with a good taste. My daughter who doesn't like oatmeal cookies enjoyed it very much!"
"0","5","The only oatmeal cookie recipe you will ever need!"
"0","4","Delicious!! Made exactly as written, dropped by heaping teaspoon onto pan, and sprinkled tops with mixture of cinnamon and sugar"
"0","5","Excellent! Very easy to make."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! Soft, not hard or stale. They are really delicious. The perfect amount of everything."
"0","5","Cut white sugar down to 1/2 cup and added 1 cup raisins. Replace 1/2 the butter with applesauce and grade up a zuchini (1/2 cup). 1/4 cup of chia seeds and sprouted flax would also be a nice touch. I baked with a stone ware cookie sheet and had to add 5 minutes cooking and up the temperature to 385. AMAZING! The batter tastes like the best granola bar you've ever had."
"0","5","Great recipe! Cookies turned out soft and chewy as the name suggest and they taste great with icing."
"0","4","Very soft and yummy! I replaced half the butter with peanut butter and skipped the cinnamon and the chilling. Added m & m's. Turned out very, very good!"
"0","5","This was a great recipe! My cookies turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I followed the recipe exactly except I used old fashioned oats because I didn't have quick oats. My stand mixer did a good job of pulverizing the oats, so it was fine. I also added a cup of mixed cranberries, chocolate chunks, almonds and walnuts (Aldi cranberry mix Trailmix,chopping the nuts before adding. I will save this recipe and use it again. I think the key is using the two sticks of butter and the sugar to make the cookie crispy, but chewy in the middle."
"0","5","Recipe is perfect AS-is. I have never made any changes to the basic recipe; I have added items such as raisins, walnuts and coconut. These are always a big hit. I usually bake them closer to 8 minutes."
"0","5","The only problem was..... Most of it didn't make it to the oven cause it was so good raw!!! I added walnuts and coconut. Also used Spelt flour. Perfect!"
"0","5","These just came out of the oven and they are amazing! I used all whole wheat flour, cut the sugar by 1/3 and added 1/2 c dark chocolate chips. I also didn't chill, just spooned them on the cookie sheet. Thank you!"
"0","4","The cookies were absolutely delicious when they came out fresh from the oven. Though id have to say i think the baking time should be reduced..i left my cookies in the oven for the whole 10 minutes, and once the cookies cooled down, theyve become pretty hard!! other than that, these have just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon to enjoy with a hot cup of coffee or tea!!"
"0","5","Loved it. I put it all in a bowl and folded it over until it was completely mixed. My son fell in love with these and they didn't last long at all. Quick, delicious and smell just as delicious as they taste. A+."
"0","5","The 1st time I made these they were very sweet so I made them again, I cut the sugars and salt in half, added 1 tsp nutmeg, I put choc. chips in half and butterscotch chips in half. I did not refrigerate or roll into balls and flatten with a fork. I just did them like normal drop cookies and they are still just as good with only 1/2 the sugar. I worried they would be too gooey without adding flour but they weren't. They were great."
"0","4","my husband is not a big fan of oatmeal raisin cookies.. but he enjoyed these very much. they are a little on the dry side but were very delicious and come out soft."
"0","5","I added raisins to this recipe and it turned out great!!"
"0","5","I very carefully followed this recipe exactly (I usually tend to estimate when I cook) and these came out just as I wished. Perfectly delicious! Even after cooling, they remained soft and yummy!"
"0","5","These came out amazing! I made the recipe as stated, however I added some goodies. One batch I added milk choc chips, dehydrated cranberries and cherries, and flaked coconut. The second batch I got a bit crafty and added some cinnamon toast crunch cereal, mini marshmallows, and milk choc chips. BOTH were delish! This recipe made quite a few cookies too, enough to freeze for another day. Will make again.... and again.... and again!"
"0","5","One of the best Oatmeal cookie recipes yet! I added 1 cup of raisins and they were perfect! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","LOVED THESE! I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead...it was perfect."
"0","5","These cookies are a success story! Just finished making them and already almost half of them are gone :) i left out dipping the fork in sugar when flattening though."
"0","5","Thanks for this quick & easy recipe! They were unbelievably soft! I was able to make a little over two dozen. Unfortunately there weren't any raisins at home...They wouldn't been much better. P.S. Dried cranberries are an alternative if you don't like raisins. They actually taste WAAY better! Maybe other dried fruits too."
"0","5","its so helpfull thank you"
"0","5","Very good and soft. I used whole wheat flour because I realized half way into it that I was out of regular. They still tasted excellent! (I've made them with regular flour before)Very versatile cookie wish I would've had some raisins/crasins or nuts! Definitely will make again."
"0","5","These cookies are the most moist and delicious cookies I have ever tasted! I skipped the cinnamon and didn't refrigerate and was still great! Next time I'll put less sugar, they don't need to be so sweet. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","Turned out awesome. The best batch of cookies I've made in a while. WOOHOO ! ! ! !"
"0","4","I made plain oatmeal cookies last night no nuts no chips added. They taste amazing! I did roll them into walnut sized balls but when I used the sugar and fork I found it made them a tad crunchy. I tried without the sugar and fork and I was able to get a delicious chewy cookie.... I would make them again but maybe add a little less oatmeal and try them with Chocolate and Carmel chips"
"0","5","I made this recipe following directions to a 't'-these are the best hands down homemade cookies I have ever made. I was sceptical after reading reviews but they turned out delicious. The only thing I didn't do was flatten them with a fork as it instructed, they flattened on there own. I also mixed white sugar and cinnamon in a bowl and sprinkled on top and just added in craisins not raisins. I was looking for something guilty to eat and very gooey-this was perfect! I only made a few so I didn't eat them all in one sitting and rolled the rest in a log and froze for later. Guess I will see how well they hold after being frozen. Yuuummeee!"
"0","5","Great!"
"0","5","OMG!!! These are amazing! I wouldn't change a thing...except I added chocolate chips!!"
"0","5","I used self-raising flower, left out the baking soda, salt and used less sugar than was called for. In addition, I didn't let the dough sit - just combined the ingredients and popped them into the oven. So easy and delicious! I also added in some walnuts!"
"0","5","My whole family loved these! I did a couple things different than the directions. I used heaping spoonfuls of cinnamon (of the Ceylon variety), I didn't refrigerate the dough, but baked it right away. I didn't push the dough down with a fork. They turned out great! My hubby said they are the best cookies I have ever made. Thanks Bittersweet1 for sharing!"
"0","5","with out a doubt the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have tried. I added a cup of raisins and a cup of milk chocolate chips and a 1/2 cup of toffee chips to the second batch I made... YUM... plain or gussied up these cookies rock. I forgot to chill the dough the second time I made these without experiencing any difference.. perhaps because of the addition of the chips and raisins?"
"0","3","it was delicious but it breaks apart when you dip it in milk and also when you eat the cookie it tastes like a fart. It was okay but not the best. I suggest another recipe."
"0","5","Wow! I loved it !! Very easy to make."
"0","2","No matter what i did to these cookies i could not get them moist. I even tried adding applesauce."
"0","5","Excellent and easy! Great taste and texture. Try this one."
"0","4","followed this recipe exactly how it was given, only added raisins and i have to say.... they are the best oatmeal cookies i have ever eaten! i only gave it 4 stars bc i wish they needed less butter.."
"0","5","42 cookies fresh out of the oven and I have to say that this recipe is a real winner. I followed the directions with one exception. I added 1 cup of shredded coconut at the end of the mixing. They turned out so delicious I can't wait to make another batch!"
"0","5","Perfection!!! I baked them with raisins fork pressed for 8 mins and they look under cooked but they are not, thats the soft moist cookie goodness!! There really is no need to alter this recipe at all!"
"0","5","Everybody in the house agreed that these are the best ever. I baked them per instructions and they were moist and chewy. Also added 1 1/2 C raisins. I was half a cup short on oatmeal and didn't use sugar to press them but they still turned out fantastic! Thank you to Bittersweet1 for this new 'old family recipe'. It's a keeper!"
"0","1","Worst cookies ever! We're dry and very strong flour taste."
"0","5","Moist and chewy. Even better the second day, cold from the fridge!"
"0","5","I make these over and over again. My husband loves them!"
"0","5","Never thought I could make a oatmeal cookie this good !!! Moist smooth rich in flavor. Makes me never wanna buy another store bought cookie. Made recipe didn't roll out dough but did roll into balls,they made themeselves look perfect.watch them to the tee for about a good 7 to 8 minutes .let cooled about 15 minutes .soft moist ooooooh .uummhhhh honey. This ones a keeper for sure .thanks allrecipe you have the best recipes hands down."
"0","5","These cookies are super delicious! I made two batches of them the first time, one with regular ingredients and one with gluten free flour and dairy free butter for my brother. Even with the differences, they worked perfectly! I make these often now, and sometimes I mix in some raisins or chocolate chips. This isn't one of those recipes that will go haywire with the smallest mistakes of measurements, which makes it very easy! Definitely recommend!"
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe! I made a couple batches this morning and they ALL turned out perfect. I chose to not add raisins or nuts and my cookies were still both large and moist. I even pureed one for my son and he loved it!"
"0","3","I think I need to try these again, maybe I need to bake them longer or in a hotter oven."
"0","2","Cookies were still very dry. Tried another batch with 1/2 cup less sugar, only 1/2 coup flour instead of 2 cups and added raisins. This batch turned out perfect. No need to push down with a sugar coated fork either."
"0","4","Don't bother cooling, and don't you dare squish them. Roll up 3-4 cm balls and bake. They come out crispy on the outside, deliciously soft on the inside. Pretty much irresistible."
"0","5","I followed the recipe but also added coconut, walnuts, and raisins. They were perfect. I have read reviews saying that these did not turn out soft for some people. One reason my be how they scoop or measure the flour. I always spoon my flour out into the measuring cup as opposed to just scooping the flour out with the measuring cup which can impact the flour and increases the amount you are actually using which could be causing the problem for some people."
"0","5","great!"
"0","5","These were a hit! added raisens."
"0","5","These cookies were magnificent! They are not too sweet with a cakeyness to them with just the right amount of oatmeal. I made mine with dried blueberries instead of raisins, and even made some plain. So good! Recipe made way more than two dozen though, which was good because 24 of these delicious little cookies would not have lasted long in my house."
"0","4","This is a good base for an oatmeal cookie, but the sugar is too much. I halved the amount of sugar & brown sugar, but the cookies are still very sweet. Next time I'd quarter the amount of sugar."
"0","5","Delicious cookies! I changed it a bit by using 1/2 cup coconut oil in place of 1/2 a cup of butter, and I added chocolate chips. They are moist and perfect! Oh and I didn't bother refrigerating or rolling the dough, just dropped on cookie sheet."
"0","5","This is by far the best oatmeal cookie I have ever tasted can't wait to make more"
"0","5","So easy, so amazing. Our new favorite. In added a cup of coconut yummmmm!"
"0","4","I made these cookies and followed the recipe but I added chocolate chips and I used some quick cooking oats and some regular oats. The cookies came out really good. They are soft and chewy and have a great taste. Thank you for the recipe"
"0","5","I made this recipe just like it is written, it is very good, not too sweet. I will make it again and add nuts next time."
"0","4","This is a really good recipe but I would add less sugar because they were too sweet for my taste"
"0","5","These were delicious even though I forgot the vanilla. I'm not a lover of oatmeal so I never made them before. My grandson and hubby absolutely. Loved them. Will make them again. Yummy"
"0","5","Have made these 3 times already, followed recipe exactly. Always turns out perfect."
"0","5","This is sooo good. I made the dough beforehand and froze it for later use. I added raisins and baked them in a toaster oven. It did not have a temperature setting, so I just covered it with foil and checked it periodically to see if it's done. It took about 15 mins and an additional 2 mins without the foil cover to brown the top. It's awesome. I make it in small batches for freshly baked cookies for breakfast!"
"0","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies EVER!"
"0","5","I really liked this! I would reduce the sugar next time I like to think these cookies are healthier then regular cho. Chip cookies but they were really sweet. I did split the batter are made one batch cho chips and walnuts and the other craisins and coconut extract. They were really tasty i cookies them for 11 mins. And i also used a cookie scoop because i really dislike flat cookies. ."
"0","5","Turned out amazingly well, I made it just like the recipe for half the batch and added chocolate chip morsels to the other half. Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","Very good! I didn't refrigerate or flatten and they came out great! Nice and chewy and flavorful - I really like them!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe as instructed. They were delicious and soft. After just cooled placed them in ziplocks. Loved them!! Thank you."
"0","5","I loved these. I didn't have brown sugar so I used all white. My batter was really dry so I added applesauce and some milk until it was a moist batter. (2 tbs of each) I added 1/4 cup of coconut. Amazing! I don't like oatmeal cookies normally."
"0","5","I made the recipe as stated, but added 1 cup of chocolate chips (mix of Nestle dark chocolate and milk chocolate chips) and used old fashioned oats instead if quick cooking oats (that's all I had). Also, I didn't flatten the cookies with a fork and baked at 350 degrees for 10 min. 375 seemed too high for the chocolate chips I added. They turned out great! Soft on the inside and really 'oat-y'. If you love oatmeal, you'll love these cookies. Maybe the oatmeal flavor and texture was intensified by the use of old-fashioned oats, but they were terrific and went quickly."
"0","4","Great taste and texture! They just did not look pretty... I will try this recipe again! Probably my fault, I rolled the entire cookie in sugar, then pressed with fork."
"0","5","To chill, or not to chill the dough. Having tried both, here is what I can report. If you like your cookies thinner and crispier, don't chill the dough. If you like them thicker and chewier (like my family), chill the dough. I also baked them on parchment paper. Perfection!"
"0","4","My hubby and sons really enjoyed these cookies! The recipe was very easy to follow and they turned out delicious! I added craisins and didn't press them with the fork or even let the dough chill. They still came out perfectly! They puff while they bake, but flatten on their own once they cool, so flattening isn't necessary at all. I also reduced the oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups. 3 seemed like it might have been too thick. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious! It made 37 cookies and pretty big ones too. I loved everything about the recipe. I did not have to use a fork dipped in sugar nor flatten them either. I like my cookies soft so I left them exactly 10 min. They came out cake like and delicious. My added part were the pecans. I added 1 cup of chopped pecans...of course...Texas style! Thank you for sharing the recipe."
"0","5","Excellent! My family loved these. They were soft and chewy just like we like them."
"0","5","My family loves this cookie recipe! I have tried both pressing with the sugar-coated fork and just rolling into a ball without flattening. Both methods work very well. I think next time I will cut back on the salt--maybe 1/2 tsp instead of one tsp. The only that baffles me is the yield--I got more than 5 dozen cookies, so I am not sure about the reported 2 dozen number, but no complaining here! :)"
"0","5","I'm a big baker in my family. I tried this tonight and everone loved them. I agree they're not a very moist cookie. But very good. I just left them in balls on my cookie sheet. they work there selfs out. better that way In my opinion. I also added a cup of raisins. Thank you for the Recipe."
"0","5","Made these with old-fashioned oats otherwise exactly as recipe states. They turned out great!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies and they are amazing!! very soft I baked them for the full 10 minutes but at 325 degrees and they were perfect!! I did throw in a little secret though.. I divided the batter in half and did half original then with the other half I added one package of m&m's and about 1/4 cup of softened peanut butter and another 1/4-1/2 cup of oats until it has the same texture as the original.. the peanut butter makes it a bit moister, you want it to make a formed ball but not soggy. Anyway it turned out delicious and I'm glad I found this recipe!!"
"0","4","I substituted Earth's Best for butter and flax meal mixed with water for the eggs to make this a vegan recipe. Also followed some suggestions in the reviews and made a batch with raisins. Overall the cookies came out good, but overly sweet in my opinion. If I attempt again, I will try using half the amount of white sugar as another reviewer suggested. Note: if you use flax meal, the cookies will come out a little more crumbly than if you used the eggs as called for by the original recipe."
"0","5","Very good and soft. No need to refrigerate dough or use the sugared fork. I rolled them and left them as is and they came out perfect."
"0","5","It's not as though this recipe needs any additional positive reviews but I felt the need to thank the author. This is a fantastic, food proof recipe. Each and every time I have made and shared these, I have been asked to make and share them again. Everyone loves them! I have made them just as the recipe is and have added all kinds of goodies as well. My favorite add ins are cranberries and chopped walnuts. I've added apple sauce, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, raisins, pecans. Around Thanksgiving, a friend gave me some persimmons, so I added persimmon pulp that I puréed in a blender and that was really yummy. Thanks for an outstanding recipe. I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and so have my family and friends!"
"0","4","Add 1 1/2 cups craisins and it perfect"
"0","5","I love oatmeal cookies but I had never thought of making them myself until I came across this recipe! For my first time they were awesome! I made them for my fathers birthday and I barely got to eat any, they were so good and gone within minutes. Moist, chewy and just enough oats. Will do again soon!"
"0","5","These cookies were amazing! To prevent the cookies from being overly sweet, I only used a 1/2 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cups of brown sugar. I also used a mixture of whole wheat and white flour to make them slightly healthier. Instead of flattening the cookies, I left them in round balls and they took 11 minutes to bake. They turned out nice and soft and had a great flavor. I will definitely be making these again!"
"0","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies! The only change would be to use only 1 tsp. baking soda as they taste a tad salty to me. I also added a splash of milk. I used a cookie dough scooper and they were the perfect size...made about 3.5 dz."
"0","5","We also added Coconut, pomegranate Craisins and walnuts to the dough and cooked them for 8 minutes to keep a bit softer. We use 2 Tablespoons per cookie ball and pressed them down with our hands instead of a fork. I wanted them to be thicker for the scoop of vanilla ice cream I was going to put in between them to make a delicious cookieice cream sandwich. Uh YUM! And it is kid friendly too!"
"0","4","Chewy and moist."
"0","5","My 3yr old and I made these tonight and we had a blast doing it together. I think she may have had more fun than me!! I added raisins to all of them and added chocolate chips to 1/2 of them. We didn't chill the dough, grease the pan, or use a sugared fork. We did flatten them slightly with our palms of our hand to get them to set on the cookie sheet. The recipe made about 40small cookies. They are amazing. My husband who doesn't really like sweets gave me a 9/10, he said he would have given me a 10/10 but the cookies were small :)"
"0","5","Great recipe! I used half a cup of coconut oil & half a cup of honey instead of the whole cup of sugar and they were soft, chewy & moist! Plus coconut oil& honey are healthier. Added some chopped almonds too :) Baking powder works just as good as baking soda in this recipe. But yes, a full 10 minutes is necessary."
"0","5","These cookies were amazing!! I divided my batter into 3 portions. Added dried cherries and shredded coconut to one. White chocolate chips to another and the last added semi sweet and white chips and raisins. My kids gobbled them all up!! I am making another batch today!!"
"0","5","for my first try at baking cookies these rocked will be my foundation recipe, they are very simple to make. Did not change recipe at all, did split dough and added semi sweet chocolate chips to one half those were the best."
"0","1","I followed the recipe to a 'T' and my cookies didn't turn out anything like the cookies above. They were flat as paper and had all run together and were super crunchy..I don't know what could have possibly gone wrong"
"0","5","The taste of these cookies was excellent, however my batch came out way too dry. Because I was experimenting (I was trying to find a good home recipe for a diabetic family member). I substituted Splenda for white sugar, halved the brown sugar and only used about 1 cup quick cooking oats. I will defiitely make them again but will try using even a little less of the oats. I believe they have a Splenda brown sugar, so next time I will use the called for amount in recipe. The taste was great! I just need to tweek my texture!"
"0","5","Cookies were awesome! I changed nothing, highly recommend, thanks bittersweet1"
"0","5","Awesome cookie recipe. I actually made it with spelt flour (what I had in the house) and it came out just great. I followed what other reviewers said and did not flatten the cookies, 9 mins was perfect. Simple and delicious!"
"0","1","This recipe lacks milk. I had to add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of milk to the batter to make it work."
"0","5","Easy to make. I baked them for about 8 minutes at 375 and they came out semi crispy, but still yummy. I also added some chocolate chips. YUM!"
"0","2","I dont know what I did wrong but these cookies came out flat and crispy! I did add chia seeds and dark chocolate chunks but that should not have changed the texture. Maybe try again with better results"
"0","5","Cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added cinnamon chips. Very tasty!"
"0","5","These are delicious! I like to bake them as bar cookies cause I am too lazy to drop :0)"
"0","5","This is definitely the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried! These cookies stay soft and chewy for a full week!!  Have used this recipe a few times and I now substitute cinnamon sugar for plain sugar on top. I sprinkle it on, then flatten the cookie balls a tiny bit (just until the top is no longer rounded, but flat) with a spatula or the back of a spoon. I bake for 9 minutes, rotate the pans due to my oven's 'hot spots', and bake for another 2 minutes. They turn out perfectly every time. Skipping the refrigeration step did made them spread out more, resulting in a thinner, crispier cookie. I keep them in the fridge for several hours or overnight. Usually, I mix in a cup of raisins, but I've also added dark chocolate chips instead and loved the results. Also, I use margarine in place of butter for baking. A tip I learned from my mother about baking with raisins: always soak raisins in very warm water for awhile to plump them up prior to using. Be sure to strain them fully so you're not adding excess water to your mix, then gently stir them in. It's personal preference, but I find the raisins dry out a lot if I skip this step."
"0","5","This was a hit at our house. I did not chill the dough, and just dropped it onto parchment paper. I used 2/3 cup each brown and white sugar to compensate for the 1/2 cup plumped raisins I put in. I don't know how big those walnut sized pieces of dough are supposed to be to only get 2 dozen cookies. I scooped them at about 2 TBSP and ended up with almost 4 dozen cookies."
"0","4","I added cranberries and white chocolate chips and then they were amazing"
"0","4","I made it exactly as the recipe read and they turned out amazing. 9 minutes... I just remembered that I didnt flatten or put sugar on it lol.. oh well they were so soft! Exactly what I needed!"
"0","5","Try adding a 1/2 cup Maple Syrup and an extra 1/2 cup flower. Amazing!"
"0","5","Loved the simplicity. My family loves this recipe. Baked it with my 2 daughters, 7 and 4. Baked it as is, no variations."
"0","5","Perfect oatmeal cookie. I followed basic instructions until the refrigeration for 1 hour, that I didn't do. Added baking raisins to half the batch and milk chocolate chips the the rest."
"0","5","They ROCKED!!"
"0","5","Delicious cookie that quickly became a family favorite. Easy, fool-proof recipe that didn't need any modifications. Baked for 12-13 minutes, though."
"0","5","Made these cookies this evening and the recipe is a keeper! Followed the directions and used the exact ingredients called for in the recipe. The only things I did different was ... I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets and I baked the cookies 15 minutes instead of 8-10 minutes. I have three Pampered Chef cookie scoops and I used the middle one. This recipe says it will make 24 cookies but I got 38 cookies. Thank you Bittersweet1 for submitting this recipe. It's the best plain oatmeal cookie I've ever baked."
"0","4","Love this basic recipe. My first batch turned out under-baked and a lithe too brown on the bottom. (Using a dark pan). I changes the temp to 350 degrees and baked them for 9 minutes. This resulted with a softer cookie and overall great texture."
"0","5","Brought these cookies to my office potluck party and everybody loved it. I added chocolate chip and substituted the brown sugar with coconut palm sugar and the white sugar with cane sugar. Omg it turned out amazing, soft and chewy. Will definitely make these again :). Thanks for the recipe :)"
"0","5","Great recipe. I've made them twice in the last two weeks!! The first batch I added Butterscotch chips and the second batch I added Caramel chips!"
"0","5","Wonderful"
"0","5","These are Sooooo good! I did split the dough in half and put chololate chips in one and craisin, white chocolate chips in the other. Sososos good!"
"0","5","Oatmeal Cookies are my FAVORITE but these cookies are the BOMB! I added raisins and a little bit more flakes. I will not use another recipe again. Thank you so much BITTERSWEET for this spectacular cookie recipe."
"0","5","Delicious! These cookies had the perfect balance as they were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The receipe was very easy to follow as I cut it in half. Next time I will add in rasins or chocolate chips. I look forward to making these again..that's for sure!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and stirred in golden raisins and dried cranberries. The edges bake up crispy while the center is melt-in-your-mouth smooth because of the brown sugar. You could pretty much eat them without any mix-ins, though."
"0","4","a great soft and crispy cookie. works just fine as a drop cookie. I omitted the pressing with a sugar fork and added raisins."
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! Took the suggestions from other members andI didn't refrigerate the door or flatten them out. They turned out great and we're very soft and moist. May try adding extra ingredients next time but this is a definite make this again."
"0","5","Awesome recipe I added raisins and the walnuts it turned out just great! They were very soft cooked them about 10 minutes and put them on the rack to dry. What a great recipe I would try it again:)-Longview,WA"
"0","5","Great recipe! Like other posters I didn't chill the dough, also I did not flatten the dough. Came out delicious! Baked for 9 minutes, just the right amount of softness. Love!"
"0","5","I added the cup of raisins and LOVED the result. Don't need any other oatmeal cookie recipes; this is the best!"
"0","5","Just made these for thanksgiving tomorrow. I added raisins to it and used an ice cream scooper to form balls. I didn't press them down with a fork because I wanted them chunkier. I was really pleased with how they turned out (I tend to like my cookies softer), they were very moist but also slightly crisp on the outside."
"0","5","i love oatmeal cookies and in my hometown, i dont have much access to delicious oatmeal cookies since my country's must-have carbs is rice. and when i found this recipe and tried it, i get very warm response from my family and friends. they love my cooking and i start to get confidence and wanna try new things everyday. they love the strong cinnamon taste and the crunch of the oatmeal and so do i =)"
"0","3","Too much sugar. I would definitely reduce to about 1 1/2 cups total instead of 2. Other than that, I added chopped walnuts and raisins so that was a plus."
"0","5","I added about a cup of chopped walnuts and a cup of diced craisins (dried cranberries) and these were just the best I've ever had. Awesome cookies!! Just made them last night."
"0","5","Great simple recipe!!! Of course I did have to add chocolate chips, cranberries & walnuts but they came out soft & chewy just the way I like em."
"0","5","I didnt use the eggs for this recipe and i only kept them in for 6-8 minuites and they turned out AMAZING!! and i am new to baking and this was very easy to make! My mom and my stepdad LOVED these!"
"0","4","I used a bit less oats, plus added walnuts, dried cranberries, and a dash of nutmeg to mine. Very yummy!"
"0","5","Yummy! I threw in a couple of handfuls of trail mix. Used an ice cream scoop and flattened them with my hand..take out of the oven when they look a little undercooked in the middle and they will firm up on the cookie sheet when they are cooling..good recipe!"
"0","5","I made these because my family asked for some although I don't normally like oatmeal cookies. But these were great! Easy to make. Not necessary to press with the fork, they cook down perfectly. They turn out so flat I was afraid they would be crisp, but they really are nice and soft. The cinnamon flavor is perfect which is what I don't normally like about oatmeal cookies, but it's not overpowering in these. I did add raisins as they were requested. I also used parchment which negated the necessity to grease the pans."
"0","5","I followed the recipe nearly to a T. I followed reviews suggestions and did not chill for an hour. I decided to roll them into 'small' walnut sized balls since any taller and they get really wide.. I added it up and made about 63 cookies. all about bite size-medium sized. very moist! when i pulled the mfrom the oven i was worried i didnt cook them long enough but they will become stiffer once they cool! 9 minutes was perfect."
"0","4","This was a good recipe. I used only 2 cups of oatmeal and did not refrigerate them or press them down. Brought them to a tailgate and everyone commented numerous times on how good they were. I also added m&m's to half of the batch."
"0","4","I followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I did not chill the dough (as other reviewers indicated this step was unnecessary). I used the scoop and drop approach without flattening the dough or using a sugared fork. I added a package of white baking chips to the dough prior to baking. I baked them 10 minutes. They are very tasty and crunchy. Next time, I would bake them less time so they would be more chewy than crunchy. They do lack a little moisture. I like when oatmeal cookies are a bit chewy and moist."
"0","5","Fantastic. Wouldn't change anything. :)"
"0","5","These are very good cookies. I have made them many times. I used chopped cranberries and pumpkin pie spice. My friends rave about them."
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookie recipe we've ever tried! Make the cookies pretty big and they'll be soft and wonderful."
"0","2","Not moist! I chose to make this recipe because it said these cookies were going to be moist. but not whatsoever! they were really good but dry while chewing it. i would of prefer them being moist and chewy. i did substitute regular sugar for splenda but i dont think the sugar was the problem oh and also regular flour for whole wheat flour"
"0","5","soft and chewy. Yumm!!"
"0","4","Very good and easy recipe. All my family and friends loved them!"
"0","4","Made them but left out the cinnamon. Super oatmeal cookie."
"0","5","I don't rate recipes very often, but these are *excellent*!! I made the base recipe exactly as written, but because it's fall I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the cinnamon, and then added 1 c. of Craisins, 1 c. of flaked coconut, and 1/2 c. white chocolate chips. The batter turned out so super thick that I didn't think it would spread much, so I didn't chill it. I made my balls the size of walnuts and put them on parchment (instead of greasing the sheets), but because of the additions, it made exactly 36 cookies instead of just 24. And in listening to some other reviewers, I didn't flatten them at all and they turned out absolutely perfect! All nice and round, just like they came out of a store bought box! They were so pretty - not too thick, not too thin. They had barely crisp edges, and the insides were chewy and wonderful! I *highly* recommend these, especially for the Holidays! Thanks SO much for this recipe! :) (Even my sister, who's the biggest cookie snoot, kept making happy 'mmm... mmm...' noises when she tried one! Now that's sayin' *something*! lol)"
"0","4","Liked the cookies, but I should have added raisins to bring some more flavor."
"0","5","I am just a regular guy that isn't particularly skilled at cooking or baking but I gotta say, this recipe is so quick and easy that I don't have to think twice about making it if I'm in the mood. This produces the most delicious and moist cookies that people I share it with actually think I'm good at baking! The only change I made was that I add a quarter to a half bag of milk chocolate chips. I gotta have chocolate in my oatmeal cookies."
"0","5","When all ingredients combine it somehow forms meth, amazing addictive meth. I halfed the recipe and added a quarter teaspoon of cloves and substituted whole wheat flour. I now have a dozen and a half cookies infront of me and the will power is fading by the minute"
"0","3","Bottoms were burnt, however, I may need a new thermostat for my oven. Did not turn out soft, but the dough was very dry. I checked the measurements several times. Just wasn't moist enough. I did like the taste of these cookies."
"0","5","I soak the raisins in the eggs in the refrigerator for 1+ hours before mixining ingredients by hand - something about mixing by hand makes them really turn out delicious. Hands down best cookies I've had in a while, this recipe is one of my favorites."
"0","5","I love these cookies, I added raisins they came out perfect!"
"0","5","Used whole wheat flour and added in some coconut, turned out really good!"
"0","5","Fabulous! I added 1 cup of Kraft caramel baking nuggets, used a Pampered Chef mini cookie scoop, and let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for 2 minutes (after 9 minutes in the oven) before transferring to a cooling rack. One batch made more than 80 cookies. I'm off to the gym!"
"0","5","Easy to prepare. End result is perfectly shaped cookies. Will definitely make these again."
"0","5","These are great. My first ever attempt at making Oatmeal cookies and they turned out great. I added raisens and chocolate chips."
"0","5","my husband thought they were great. I think the diff is that you put the dough in the fridge compare to not."
"0","5","I added raisins and they were delicious!"
"0","5","I added some shredded coconut and didn't bother flattening. These were delicious and a big hit! Everybody took some home after the party."
"0","5","Love this recipe. Added walnuts and craisins and they are simply delish. Dropped by tablespoon and they turned out great. Actually made about 4 dozen. My new favorite oatmeal cookie."
"0","5","Love this recipe and didn't change a thing! If you make cookies then you know when you should take them out according to their looks as far as how you like them done. Thanks for a great recipe!! These are my hubby's favorite!!"
"0","5","Thanks to MRONUFRAK, we made some adjustments when we made these tonight. We added a half cup of applesauce to make them more moist, didn't press them down, and gave them the full 10 minutes. We also added chocolate chips. PERFECTION!!"
"0","5","10 stars. I added raisins and some pumpkin pie spice."
"0","4","This recipe was good. I loved how soft and chewy the cookies came out. However, I listened to some of the other reviewers and cut the sugar in half and should have also cut the salt. They were a slighty salty so next time I won't use so much salt. I also used 1.5 cups of unbleached all purpose flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour. Also I think they could use some more cinnamon or perhaps some other spice as they were slighty bland. I didn't refrigerate them and they turned out fine. I also made a glaze out of powdered sugar and milk and topped them. I made them for a play date for my son and he loved them! I couldn't keep him away from them before the play date! Thanks for the recipe"

"0","5","I actually was looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe to turn into a healthy, protein cookie for my boyfriend and I. We both have a massive sweet tooth!!  Anyways I substituted butter with Ghee, (they sell it at trader joes and whole foods), instead of a cup of white sugar I used a cup of vanilla protein powder, upped the vanilla just slightly, added about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, used whole wheat flour, and added just a quarter cup of fat free evaporated milk (my mom always used it in baking growing up, so delicious!!), as well as a generous helping of semisweet chocolate chips! The first time I made these I even substituted agave nectar for the brown sugar, it was still very good! But considering how many cookies this makes, I didn't feel like a cup of dark brown sugar was really that bad to use. I have given this recipe to all of my friends. In fact my boss said these tasted entirely too delicious to be healthy or have protein powder in them ;) happy baking!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe with a few modifications as I try to avoid wheat (the wheat in oats is minimal). I used a mixture of King Arthur's Gluten Free Flour and 1/2 coconut flour (gluten free). Even though I did grease the pans, after flattening the cookies, I turned them to loosen them. And, if you take them off the pan before the four minutes, they break. Take the time and let them harden. All in all, this is a delious and easy to make cookie."
"0","5","Added 1/2 peanut butter...fantastic recipe"
"0","5","I am not a big fan of oatmeal, so I never bothered to make them...but for a benefit to raise money, I figured it was a good idea because a lot do enjoy oatmeal cookies...they were easy, baked perfect and I thought they were delicious."
"0","5","These cookies have the best combination of chewiness in the middle and crispy edges! They have a sweet cinnamon flavor and the oats always make me feel like I'm eating healthy so I always eat a few at a time! So delicious!"
"0","4","I made these cookies for my family and they loved them! One comment I'd like to make is they're a little needy is sweetness. I made them the second time and add 1/4 cup extra of each sugar and they were amazing! Thank you. :)"
"0","5","They were delish. My daughter and i threw in some peanut butter and some chocolate chips! Super soft and moist. I also just dropped them onto the cookie sheet. No sugared fork flattening them. Turned out amazing!"
"0","5","First time I made this recipe. The cookies turned out delicious; my husband and kids loved them!"
"0","5","This is the first oatmeal cookie that stays soft!! I really love this quick and easy recipe! Definitely going to keep it and pass it around to all my relatives. I made the batch 1/3 plain, 1/3 chocolate chips, and 1/3 raisins. It helps to use a cookie scoop so they all come out the same size. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Very nice recipe. I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of plumped raisins. I had to increase the baking time to 11 minutes. I didn't flatten them or dip them in sugar. They came out perfectly shaped and sweet.They were outrageous!"
"0","5","Makes a great base for whatever you can think of! I added Dried Cranberries, Raisins, Roasted Almonds, Walnuts, Granola and Chocolate chips for 'trail mix' cookies. Soft, delicious!"
"0","5","These are great! I added a few things... A dash of cloves & 1tbsp molasses. Divided recipe in two. Mixed raisins in one half, and cinnamon chips in the other. Both are very tasty! I did refrigerate mine over night. I didn't roll them into balls, just used my cookie scoop, then smashed down with hand SLIGHTLY. My cookies had to bake for 10 min. HOWEVER key is to only bake till edges are golden brown. Cookie will not look completely cooked. But after you leave them on sheet for 5 min, they are perfect. And they are so soft & yummy! Thx for the recipe :)"
"0","5","It was soooo chewy! Love it!! Thank you!!"
"0","5","Have used this recipe multiple times and always great reviews !! No need to refrigerator or roll into balls just used as drop cookies and they turn out great!!"
"0","5","awesome. i added extra sugar. burnt some and others more soft. here's me and my friends with the results."
"0","5","Great cookies! I tried them with raisins and it was a complete success."
"0","5","Delicious!! I added Raisins and Chocolate chips and everyone loved them."
"0","4","Gluten free changes - the flour to coconut flour, 4 eggs for each cup of coconut flour. I did cut the recipe in half, added a 1/2 tsp of maca powder and made the cookies smaller. They are a bit dry, as others have stated so will add in some apple sauce next time. Keeping the recipe!"
"0","5","We ate these as quickly as we could without burning our mouths! ! The kids loved them, even my very picky 3-yr old who doesn't like cookies (what??!!). The texture is wonderful, and ours came out perfectly moist. . We didn't flatten them with a fork, though."
"0","5","Made to recipe but without thinking did 2 tsp cinnamon. Still delicious. Slightlysmushed but no sugar. Can't wait to experiment with additives:)"
"0","5","Its so easy to follow, though i made some changes i lessen half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar, divided the mixture into 3, add 1/4 cup raisins in 1st , 1/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips 2nd, 1/4 cup dried apricot 3rd. Amazing and gives smile on my face, my Husband and my 4year old Son like it so much... I love those ones with dried apricot, Which my Honey and my Baby loves those ones with chocolate chips. Those with raisins i finish them last."
"0","5","Great cookie! Did not refrigerate the dough, was slightly sticky but workable and the cookies were perfectly soft and chewy!"
"0","5","loved this!! I will make them again. nice and moist!!! I left them in balls and didn't flatten them with sugar. ( they have plenty already) They where amazing!!!!! thanks soooooo much for this recipe!"
"0","5","The best oatmeal cookie! Added 1 cup raisins to make oatmeal raisin cookies which are my husband's favorite. This recipe now replaces all the others I've tried and hung on too as I searched for the best."
"0","5","This Oatmeal Cookies are so Delicious! I never tought that Oatmeal Cookies are so easy to make. it taste just PERFECT! i cant stop eating this!"
"0","5","I used Crisco instead of butter. Wonderful cookies"
"0","4","My husband really enjoyed these. I was in a hurry so I put them in the freezer for ~15 mins. They turned out fine. Next time I'll budget more time. Definitely will make again."
"0","5","These cookies are amazingly moist and flavourful! And, to top it off, incredibly easy to make!"
"0","5","My husband really liked these and they stay soft!"
"0","5","these cookies are wonderful! my whole family loves them! they are soft and chewy, the perfect cookie. All though they were a little bland. I added fruit on top of them once they were done and it was delicious. They needed the full 10 minutes to get golden brown. Overall this is a tasty cookie that i recommend. Thanks for the yummy recipe!"
"0","5","I loved these cookies. They were nice an soft, easy to make. I will definitely be making these again for a party or when I have guests over."
"0","5","Great easy recipe. Turned out perfect. Not sure why others have had issues. Added walnuts to half the batter and drizzled with white chocolate once cooled. Baked for 13 min on 350 and got a nice soft chewy cookie. Thanks for recipe! Will definitely use this again"
"0","5","I followed the recipe with a few alterations. I only used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and I added 1 cup of raisins and a cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the batter. I made my cookies larger than walnut-sized; I didn't press them down and I baked them for about 14min. Absolutely delicious! Soft,chewy and very moist!"
"0","5","I've made these twice for real estate open houses to give visitors. We bake a dozen at a time and keep hot fresh out of the oven cookies all day. Let me tell you that everyone loves them. Two people today said they were better than Starbuck's oatmeal cookies. I've never had theirs so wouldn't know, but some guests came back for seconds and even asked if they could take one or two for the road. You can mix the dough in like five minutes and the dough refrigerates well if you want to cook batches at different time. I followed the recipe to a T. I cook them for seven to eight minutes just preferring a softer cookie. One thing I learned though, is to keep the dough chilled if you aren't baking them all at once. I make the mistake of letting mine get closer to room temperature by leaving it out for an hour and my cookies looked like little rocks instead of the beautiful cookies they are meant to be. This was a user created issue and nothing to do with the recipe. Thanks so much for the post. I will be serving these at every open house from now on. ONE LAST THING.....I ADD ABOUT A CUP OF RAISINS TO THE DOUGH AND IT'S PERFECT."
"0","3","The cookie was okay, not great. I will keep looking for another."
"0","4","I added trail mix and a few chocolate chips.....yum!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, adding 3/4 cup raisins, but I didn't chill the dough. I used a small ice-cream scoop to make even size cookies, and didn't flatten the dough. They made perfect, soft, chewy cookies!"
"0","5","Excellent cookies. Easy recipe. I made them plain but I will add some raisins or nuts next time."
"0","5","Absolutely amazing texture! I omitted the cinnamon and added vanilla and chocolate chips. I baked for 10-11 minutes. The best oatmeal cookie ever."
"0","5","I did what Colorado Princess did...used splenda, WW flour and did not flatten. I also added 1/2 cup of a mix of raisins, cranberries and blueberries and a l/1 cup of chopped pecans and walnuts. Excellent!! I will definitely make these again."
"0","5","BITTERSWEET1 - Thank you for the great recipe! I read many reviews and made very miner adjustments! First, I baked at 350 instead of 375 for 8 minutes. I think the lower temperature helped to make them soft - and they were nice and soft! Since I added raisins, I headed the advice of others and only added the brown sugar and cut the white sugar out altogether. I also reduced the oatmeal to 2.5 cups instead of 3 cups and used steel cut oats. (The steel cut oats gave them a finer texture. ) This is a very good recipe! Very simple and easy to customize to ones taste. I will be making these again and again! Next time I'll try dark chocolate chips or cranberries and walnuts. Again, thank you for posting this terrific recipe."
"0","5","excellent!"
"0","5","This is the one! It definitely makes more than 24 cookies, though, probably at least twice that amount. I made the dough as is, then pressed 2-3 butterscotch chips into a couple of trays, and raisins into a few other trays. I didn't need to dip the fork in sugar before pressing, either. Next time, I may put a little less cinnamon, because my husband isn't a big fan, but, otherwise, these are terrific!"
"0","2","I followed this recipe as is to the end but I added chocolate chips and raisins to my batch and I found these cookies to be way too sweet. There is too much oatmeal in the dough which makes it hard after sitting in the fridge for an hour. A tip if you do still want to try this recipe because of the other thousands of glowing reviews is that you have to mold your dough into small balls right after mixing and BEFORE you let it sit for an hour. Maybe it it will work better for you, but this is one recipe I will not try again."
"0","5","I whipped up half a batch of these bad boys during nap time and I have to say WOW! I wanted to use ingredients that I already had in the house but had to substitute almond extract in lieu of vanilla. I felt no need to put the dough in the fridge and didn't sugar the fork I lightly pressed the dough balls with. They were quick and simple, came out delicious! Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. I was expecting 12 cookies and yielded 20 :) I don't think they will last until tomorrow!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe for oatmeal cookies. I tweaked the recipe to make the cookies healthier so I wasn't sure how they would turn out, but they still came out soft and flavorful. I substituted the all-purpose flour for white whole-wheat flour and instead of 1 cup white sugar, I added 1 tablespoon. I will try margarine instead of butter next time to see how that changes things."
"0","5","These were delicious and I only made a few very small changes. I melted the butter completely and mixed that way-made a chewer cookie. Also, roll the dough into balls before you chill them. Then put the balls in the oven directly from the fridge. This keeps them from flattening! I tried to dip the fork in sugar but nothing stuck. So I flattened them a TINY bit and sprinkled just a bit of sugar on each. Baked for 10 min and they were wonderful!!!"
"0","1","WAY to salty. I followed the reacepie exactly but it leaves a satly after-taste that is to much for me or anyone else to handle. I would NOT recomend this recepie."
"0","5","VEEERRRRYYYY GOOD! My grandma who is a very good baker asked me for the recipe! I put 1 cup of milk chocolate chips in mine, soooooo goood!!"
"0","5","Fantastic! I added a cup of craisins and these came out perfect. They are sweet...could probably cut the sugar a bit and they would still be great."
"0","2","The cookies came out ok. I am going to keep looking for a recipe I love."
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever had!!"
"0","4","These were great. Very simple and tasty. I took the advice of others and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, and I'm glad I did. They were plenty sweet. I will also admit to cutting about a half-cup of oats and adding about a cup and a half of trail mix with peanut, raisins, almonds, m&ms and a handful of chocolate chips for good measure. They turned out just great. I baked about 9 minutes to get them just right, possibly due to the additions. Texture was just right. This is clearly a great base recipe that is very forgiving and invites variations. Experiment to your heart's content!"
"0","4","This turned out to be a great recipe, though the cookies did seem to spread out a bit too much for my taste. When I made them a second time, I added one mashed-up VERY ripe banana, which made for a delicious variation that also retained the shape a bit more."
"0","5","Love, love, love these! They're moist, chewy, and my children adore them. I substitute margarine for the butter and skip the additional sugar at the end."
"0","5","I'm a novice baker, but I got a lot of compliments from these!  To experiment, I baked 4 small batches with different properties, 8 minutes + pressed, 10 minutes + pressed, 13 minutes + not pressed, and 17 minutes + not pressed, resulting in cookies ranging from super soft to rather crunchy. The 10 pressed and 13 unpressed were very similar in quality, as the thicker unpressed cookies need more time to bake. They all tasted good though, though presentation-wise, the pressed cookies look better. If I were to make these again, I would use a tad less sugar, and then do a thicker coating of sugar on top."
"0","5","These cookies stayed soft for days. I took them out of oven at the minimum time. I agree with another reviewer the sugar on the top is unnecessary before baking. Tasted fine with raisins added. Still not quite the oatmeal cookie I am looking for though."
"0","5","It was my first time making oatmeal cookies and these were really good! I followed the recipe and added rasins, but didn't use a fork to press flat -- just used a cookie scoop. They came out great! Some people must over-cook because they were moist. When you take them out they look like they need more time, but they just need to cool!"
"0","2","These came out bready and really dry. Seemed like alot of oats and was definately too much. I'll note that I only had an hour to let the batter sit so that might have made the difference. Will try another recipe for oatmeal cookies in the future."
"0","5","have added dates, raisins, dried cherries, coconut, chocolate chips-drk and milk to various batches in various mixes..it is all so good."
"0","5","I LOVE these cookies. They were the best, especially with raisins! When baked at the proper length, the cookies come out chewy and the insides were soft yet the outsides were crunchy. ^.^ I think dipping the fork is unnecessary and mine came out fine without doing so. :) (that is, if you add raisins)"
"0","5","just made them best soft oatmeal cookies ever I am not a big fan of the crunchie oatmeal cookies and this were just perfect moist and soft as the title announces my family loves them and the best thing is that is the perfect base to add any ingredient I made half with almond and the other half with unsweeten coconut the only thing I did was took out 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and added of nugmeg which gave them a nice flavor and use a little less of salt...my dad is very critical with cooking especially since he is in a healthy diet but had no comment on this ones he just loves them"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. Used 1/2 the sugar and added walnuts and ground flaxseed. Very moist and flavorful."
"0","5","This recipe is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But for me, it took like 3 hrs because I didn't plan ahead, so yeah! but still great recipe!"
"0","5","Great cookies. Were very moist. This recipe does make a lot! There were so many my boyfriend took them to work and the guys ate them up! Will make again."
"0","5","I've baked this for my korean students and they were crazy about it! They kept asking for more."
"0","5","Thought this was a really good one! y husband LOVES oatmeal cookies and thought I would make some as treat tonight They turned out great, however, for my, a bit too sweet, but not for him! I will use this one again in the future, might change things a little, like adding the raisins or chocolate chips. Thanks"
"0","4","Very delicious cookies. I added a pinch of cinnamon and more raisins and they were very tasty. I used a regular size cookie scoop and the cookies didn't spread like normal, so I ended up with small bite size cookies. But they were still delicious. Next time I might reduce the amount of quick cooking oats from 3 cups to 2 - 2.5 cups."
"0","5","I added butterscotch chips, yummy!!!"
"0","2","Soft, but dry and bland. Not recommended."
"0","5","Great recipe! I changed it slightly because I am eating vegan so instead of the eggs I used the great alternative of 1 tbsp ground chia seeds and 1/4 cup of water for each egg. Turned out perfect!"
"0","5","Amazing!!!!!!! These cookies are awesome, easy to make, and the recipe made a ton of cookies. My whole family loved them, thank you for a terrific recipe!!"
"0","4","I didn't have enough oats, so I halved the recipe. I also took the advice of other reviewers and skipped chilling the dough and did not flatten with a sugar-dipped fork. These cookies didn't need it, as they were sweet enough. Cookies were soft and chewy with nice crispy edges. Great recipe! Will try adding in other goodies next time. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","3","Texture was perfect, but the flavor wasn't there. With so many reviews I was really really dissapointed. All recipes recipes with thousands of reviews have always been fantastic in the past. This one was a fail that I will not try again. ):"
"0","5","These are awesome!!! Didn't chill and didn't flatten. Just baked 9 min. and let them rest on the cookie sheet for 5 min. and they were perfect."
"0","5","This is the first time I made oatmeal cookies, I loved this recipe, easy and test good!! but I fond it's way too sweet. I only put 1 cup brown sugar and 1 tbsp of honey insted of 1 cup of white sugar. Also I add dried cranberries and slice amonds."
"0","5","Turned out just the way I want oatmeal cookies!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies, but I added my own little twist. I added some chopped pecans and caramel bits. I also added two splashes of low fat milk when I added the oatmeal. These are crispy on the outside and soft and soft and chewy on the inside. They are YUMMY!!!!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","They did make soft cookies ,I added a touch of honey and it made them very soft about 1tbsp worth"
"0","5","Awesome soft cookie recipe that will leave your cookie jar empty!"
"0","4","I modified this recipe by using half as much butter, then 1/4 cup or do butter flavored shortening, and adding some applesauce. Sometimes rich cookies give me heartburn, and these are simple and delicious the kind of cookies my husband's Grandma makes!"
"0","4","Made this just a little bit ago, and did a few things different. Used Splenda, half ww, half white, and one whole egg, one egg white. Oh, and used more Splenda instead of brown sugar. Health issues demand I use as little sugar as possible. Any ways, yes, the rounder ones were more moist than the slightly flattened ones. Also, in the moist department, only cooked them for 6 mins, and some of them were made with a slight depression in the top, and a touch of fruit jam added before baking. They were awesome...teenager approved, even! I must say though, they really don't seem like cookies, more like muffin bites, that would be great for breakfast with a touch of butter and jam, or honey. My alterations in the recipe could account for that, but regardless, they were great for our purposes, and will be made again. Super after school snack, on the cheap without the guilt!"
"0","4","These are really good. I added some chopped pecans and chocolate chips and I wound up with way more than the recipe said it would yield. I recommend the pecans (or walnuts), they make it come together nicely in my opinion. Definitely trying it with raisins in a few days!"
"0","4","Thank you so much for the recipe. I tried many and this is the one I will keep doing. I just baked them and they are really good. I put half of sugar (only brown) and had to add some milk because it was too dry to get a dough. My son and husband loved them. I just think they have a bit too much of baking soda taste so I will put only 1 tsp next time. Thanks again!"
"0","5","Love love love these. I added 2T sour cream for a little extra moisture but the recipe is great as it is."
"0","5","These are great cookies. Since it's just 2 of us at the house, I cooked a batch and then froze the remaining dough. I wrapped them into tubes like you see at the grocery store, just sizing them down to a single evening desert for 2. Wrapped once in wax paper and then a second wrap in foil, each recipe yields about 4 tubes for the freezer for us. They turn out Delicious every time. The only changes that I made was I used only 1t of cinnamon instead of 1 1/2t and cooked at 350."
"0","4","simple and tasty. easy to vary using nuts and fruit"
"0","5","Wonderful cookie!! Split in half... one-half chocolate chips; one-half sunfower seeds and golden raisins. Thanks for the recipe! Did not chill; did not flatten out."
"0","5","they are good cookies my family likes them know they want me to make some up for them"
"0","5","I started making these a few years ago and this is the only oatmeal cookie I will ever make. I make it exactly how the recipe states, with the exception of flattening with a fork. They always come out great. I make these every year during the holidays for family and work, and they're always a hit. Actually I'm kinda now required by my coworkers to bring them in...lol. Even my father who usually never would think of eating an oatmeal cookie LOVES these cookies. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe."
"0","5","Perfect soft cookies, the only modification I made was to add some peanut butter chips to one batch and chocolate to another. No need to chill the dough before putting on cookie sheets."
"0","4","Loved it!"
"0","5","I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup of each and skipped dipping the fork in sugar. They were wonderful. Next time I'll experiment with craisins, nuts, and chocolate chips!"
"0","5","They were delicious. I recommend it for anyone who wants a delicious oatmeal cookies."
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookie recipe ever."
"0","5","Yummy! I wanted a soft oatmeal cookie recipe that I could add chocolate chips and pecans to and this was it! I added a splash of milk and about a quarter cup of applesauce to assure enough moisture for the additions. The cookies came out soft and tasted wonderful. Definitely a keeper of a recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"0","4","If you prefer a cake like cookie then slightly flatten the dough before baking but if you prefer a soft and crunchy cookie scoop a spoon size amount (rolling not necessary) then flatten the dough as much as possible. I thought I should mention that after refrigerating for an hour I rolled the dough into balls and slightly flattened resulting to a cake like cookie. 2 days later I scooped spoon size amounts and flattened really flat resulting a soft and crunchy cookie. I enjoyed these cookies with a couple of modifications. I added chocolate morsels and instead of dipping a fork in sugar I drizzled them with honey after 'flattening'. If oatmeal were my absolute to die for cookie I would have definitely given a 5 star rating. Overall this recipe creates a good oatmeal cookie."
"0","5","My husband was craving oatmeal cookies and I had a ton of oatmeal to use so I gave this recipe a try and glad I did!! The cookies had a thin crust on the outside and the inside was soft. Everyone went crazy for them. Followed the recipe with the exception of not chilling the dough, only due to not enough time, baked them on parchment paper, no greasing the sheets, used a cookie scoop and pressed them down slightly and omitted the sugar."
"0","5","i was in the baking mood but i was running low on supplies. so i used 1/2 cup oil instead of butter and all white sugar since i had no brown. these were FANTASTIC. super easy to make and easily tweak-able if i wanted to add raisins, nuts, or chocolate chips."
"0","5","Yummy! Makes a very thick batter so electric stand mixer is needed. Followed directions exactly and they turned out great!"
"0","4","Good recipe. I have found that I don't need to chill the dough. I don't flatten them either--just walnut size balls which flatten out some with baking. Really like them with chopped walnuts in them. Double the cinnamon and the vanilla. Be careful not to overbake. I baked half and watched them closely, taking them out while they were still soft. Mother made the other half. She flattened them, and let them bake until they were firm. These were still good, but only with dipping so as not to break a tooth."
"0","5","wonderful! I split the dough in 2. One i added choclate chips and the other I added rasins. I also used raw sugar on the top. They came out great. They were a big hit"
"0","5","First time making these. My favorite oatmeal raisin cookie recipe now"
"0","5","Love em nothing more to say."
"0","5","I have made this cookies a couple of times now and every one loved them. I have shared it with many of my friends and can promise you will like it too. If you like it crispy leave it in oven a few min longer. I liked them soft so 10 min was just perfect for me"
"0","5","Love these cookies! They came out amazing. My family devoured them all. They keep well too. Even after one week (kept in tupperware) they still tasted so good."
"0","5","Very easy recipe and cookies turn out great. I added a cup of rasins to the recipe. Whole family thought they were great."
"0","5","This is quite possibly THE perfect cookie recipe. Everyone raved about them and I never changed a thing. I baked them on the middle rack for 10 minutes exactly. Thanks!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe because they are soft and moist vs other recipes I have tried. Not only that but the cinnamon gave it a really good flavor kick. Oh and I would say the sugar's optional because they are fine with or without sugar. Overall great recipe, I'll be making them again."
"0","4","These were amazing, but didn't come out chewy. The first batch was runny. I added more flour to the second batch, but that still didn't do it. Any advice? More flour next time, perhaps? I like the recipe, but I want SOFT cookies!"
"0","5","just made these and went excatly by the recipe and they are very good.... next time ill try with splenda and splenda brown sugar blend"
"0","5","good added one cup dry cranberries. made half recipe. made 30 cookies."
"0","5","Easy and good. I didnt chill dough and they still came out great."
"0","5","To die for!"
"0","5","pretty soft! using them for visitor cookies at church tomorrow! :)"
"0","4","Delish! I substituted applesauce for the butter and 1 C whole wheat and 1 C rice flour instead of all purpose - they are so yummy and moist! This makes a large amount, I had 30 decent sized cookies and probably enough batter for another 6 or so leftover. Baked for 10 minutes and then turned oven off and left them in for another 2 minutes or so. They are just perfectly done for my liking - moist in the middle and slightly crunchy on the outside."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious. I have made twice. The first time I only had 2/3 c brown sugar. Both times they were great. They can be mixed the day before. I suggest if you make changes it just be adding nuts. Every one that had tasted loved them. Good for first timer kids to make."
"0","5","Super easy to make and they taste really good! I made a homemade cream cheese frosting to go with it, awesome!!"
"0","5","This was my first time making oatmeal cookies. I added a cup of walnuts and a whole banana instead of two eggs. They were great! My kids loved them!"
"0","5","These turned out wonderfully. I never put my cookies higher than 350 degrees, so I set it at that and baked them for about 20 minutes. I didn't grease the bottom of my non-stick pan and the bottoms were just a beautiful light brown color. They were moist, soft and delicious. I added dried cranberries to mine. I just used a spoon to drop them on the pan and flattened them slightly with the spoon. These are going in a gift basket for a friend."
"0","5","One of the best recipes I found online,taste very good. When I place them on the baking sheet i roll them into little balls they turned out perfect."
"0","4","These cookies were good but not the best recipe I've tried. The cookies were also moist and chewy just as promised."
"0","5","This by far is the best Oatmill cookie recipe I have tried. I added 1 1/2 cups of raisinsand 1 cup of chopped pecans...They were moist and chewy.Baked for 13 minutes. Absolutely Great!"
"0","5","yes very good"
"0","5","Delicious cookies, and very easy to make."
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever found!!!!"
"0","5","Very good but a bit too sweet. Cut back on the sugars to 3/4 cup each."
"0","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made! I love this recipe, thank you! :)"
"0","4","I cut the sugars and salt by half and added 1 cup of raisins. I did not refrigerate them and just used a scooper and flattened them with a fork. They were still sweet enough. They came out soft and yummy."
"0","3","Easy to make and very tasty. Next day though they were hard as a rock even though they were stored in an air tight container so we just dipped them in coffee like biscotti!"
"0","5","The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Even my husband who isn't normally a big fan of oatmeal cookies loved these."
"0","4","1st time making oatmeal cookies. Followed recipe. Chilled it for 1 hour, halved the batter and added raisins to one half and craisins to the other half. Chilled again for 15 mins. Made small balls and placed on parchment lined cookie sheet. Skipped the fork dipped in sugar. Baked at 350 degrees and noticed that it took more like 12 mins. Took them out when they had a nice golden color. I had to pop my first batch back in the oven since they were undercooked at 8 mins but ultimately came out great. These are a special request birthday gift, so we are VERY happy they came out so good."
"0","5","This cookie recipe is very good. Stays soft for days, and is almost a hybrid of Chocolate Chip Cookies and standard Oatmeal Cookies."
"0","4","I'm not an oatmeal cookie person, but these were still pretty good."
"0","4","I followed the recipe except I added 1/2 cup sour cream to the butter/sugar mixture. These cookies turned out great! I'll see what my bible study group thinks tonight."
"0","5","These COOKIES are AWESOME had to make a secoind batch....."
"0","5","I made these for home and work, and they were an absolute hit! I got multiple requests for this recipe - it has this many reviews for a reason! I omitted the cinnamon by accident the first time I made them (I'm not a big cinnamon fan, so maybe I subconsciously left it out on purpose?) and thought they tasted delicious, so I always make them without cinnamon. I also add chocolate chips every time. For a less messy and quicker option, I use a cookie scoop so I skip the flattening with fork+sugar step. The cookies turn out beautifully every time!"
"0","5","These cookies were wonderfull! I will be making these again and again. The first batch were alittle flat, chewy and too sweet, so I added 1/4 cup of flour and they came out perfect! It gave them volume and fixed the chewy texture. I just spoon dropped the onto the sheet, they were already sweet enough without the sugar."
"0","5","Great! If your family is like mine and can't decide between chocolate chip and regular oatmeal cookies, bake the first half of the batch regular and add 1 cup of chocolate chips half way through. This recipe also makes a small batch, I double or triple depending on how many I need."
"0","5","These were soft and delicious! Just made some little changes: I used only 1 cup of brown sugar(omitted the white sugar) and replaced the eggs with 1 pureed banana."
"0","5","I put a healthy spin on this great recipe I substituted white flour with 1 1/2 cups of Wheat flour added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of dried cherries.It has become an instant family favoite!"
"0","5","Just made these to ride out a storm and they are WONDERFUL!! This is the best foundation Oatmeal cookie I have tried. I cut both sugars to 3/4 cup each and sprinkles top with just a touch of cinnamon sugar mixed with a pinch of Pumpkin Pie Spice. Delicious and not overly sweet. They are chewy and tasty...THANKS!"
"0","2","It didn't taste like a cookie at all! It had more of a bread like texture."
"0","4","This was easy and fantastic! It was pretty moist to me, but it was a little too sweet for my other family members. These were pretty soft too, and I didn't grease the pan very well, so they stuck. They were soft when they came out so I couldn't take them off immediatly and had to wait 5 minutes."
"0","5","Great recipe! 1/2 of the batter was given white and black mini chic chips, the other 1/2, I added rum soaked raisins. Wow! The raisins ones were AWESOME! I halved the amount of white sugar in this recipe, by the way. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Wonderful cookies!! Though they were a bit too sweet for my taste, but other than that, positively mouth-watering!"
"0","5","very good cookies but need to be less sugar."
"0","5","These were amazing. I did not refrigerate nor flatten but kept everything else the same! Yummy!"
"0","5","definitely chewy...exactly how i liked it... it wasn't too sweet as how i liked it :) i made big ones and no matter the size, medium or big, the cookie was cooked just right  thanks for this!!"
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookie recipe!! Only changes I made: cut back both sugars to 1/2; added another 1/2 tsp cinnamon; added approx. 1/2 cup each of chopped pecans, golden raisins and cherry craisins. They are done perfectly in 8 mins. and sooooooooo good!"
"0","5","These cookies were awesome! No need to refrigerate or flatten as others said."
"0","5","The best 'secret' to good oatmeal cookies is room temperature butter (margarine) and eggs. This recipe reponds very well to that and produced wonderful cookies."
"0","5","I added walnuts and raisins. Soooooooo good!!!"
"0","4","Everyone loved them. Easy recipe, would make again. Baked for exactly 8 min, don't want to over bake and even a little less on the last pan. . Also added 1/3 cup of each of the following: corse cut almonds, mini choc chips and raisins."
"0","4","Dropped by large cookie scoop and baked at 325 for 18 minutes."
"0","4","I added apples & raisins. They held together well & were tasty."
"0","5","Awesome cookies! I love how they turned out chewy and soft. My dad loves oatmeal cookies and I can't wait to make these for him during my next trip to visit my parents!"
"0","5","I love these cookies, I made them with raisins and then again with chocolate chips! My favourite oatmeal cookie!"
"0","5","This came out fabulous! I had tried a previous recipe and it was a dud but I am so impressed with this recipe. The cookies are moist & chewy, as promised. I definitely am satisfied with the recipe, thanks!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies...got 35 of them instead of the 24, more than what the recipe said. They are great and next time I will forgo the sugar on the top. I didn't add any nuts or fruit to them. Folks will enjoy I am sure. I did not make any changes to the recipe, followed to the letter."
"0","5","This is a great recipe for sweet oatmeal cookies. I modified it adding 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, and 1/4 cup raisins. I also left out the salt. This yielded about 3 dozen 3 and 4 inch cookies."
"0","4","Made a ton of these to feed 27 high school volleyball players. They gobbled them up. I added raisins to mine."
"0","5","I just got done baking a batch of cookies and oh my goodness- it turned out so delicious. I had to leave out the teaspoon of salt because I used salted butter. I also didn't press down my dough with a sugared fork because I added some raisins to my dough. To get a nice chewy cookie all I did was roll a 2 inch ball and pressed it down firmly (not too much though or you'll have a crunchy one) and then bake it for 12 minutes in a 375 preheated oven. I decided to make this for my husband who is a flight engineer in the Air Force & his flight crew since they'll be flying early in the morning and I wanted them to have something to munch on during the flight! :) Give this recipe a try and I promise you that you'll love it!"
"0","5","This has to be the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever tried. I added about a half a cup of chocolate chips, which made them even better. These are fantastic!"
"0","5","my husband says these are the best cookies i have ever made!  i did need to add one and a half cups of oats to the recipe to make it thick enough."
"0","5","Cut back on the sugar and added ~1/2 cup rum-soaked raisin. Delicious!"
"0","5","These were great. I got 4 doz from this recipe. Next time I will cut sugar back to 3/4c. Ran out of oatmeal, so I used 1 pkg of instant brown sugar oatmeal to equal 3 cups."
"0","3","These were ok, although I have made better, and they were a bit difficult to bake just right, either ending up raw, or totally burnt at the edges (Probably because they are very thin) I made a few changes and finally got them presentable, but I don't think it was worth the effort.  1) Add 1/2 tsp. Cloves 2) Add 1/2 tsp. Baking Powder 3) Add 1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract 4) Place on the tray as small balls, do not flatten! (No sugar on a fork - since you don't need to flatten them) 4) Bake for 9 minutes (Cool for three before moving to a cooling rack)  Hopefully they'll be bearable :)"
"0","5","These are the most simplistic delicious recipe I have found. Just delicious. I added walnuts to mine...heaven. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Just ate one (okay, two!) warm from the oven. Crispy-chewy and delicious. Did NOT refrigerate or flatten, just shaped into balls with hands (first spritzed hands with non-stick cooking spray). I did add the raisins (actually a raisin-dried cherry-cranberry blend, soaked in warm water & drained). Also added almonds that I ground in the food processor (~ 1/4 cup after grinding) and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Made these as a gift for a friend but will have to make more for home -- And they won't last long!"
"0","5","These are awesome. Made changes as others suggested 1 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt. Very soft. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes"
"0","4","An overall great oatmeal cookie recipe, but I also made some adjustments. First I should note, that I halved everything in this recipe because I was baking for a household of two. It made a batch of about 15 medium sized cookies (still more than enough for us). It's my personal opinion that plain oatmeal cookies are boring, so I threw in a large handful of Sun-Maid Raisins. Since I was cooking at night, I did not have time to chill the dough before baking but I didn't have any issues with it being too sticky and the cookies still came out fantastic. As another reviewer commented, I also did NOT flatten the cookies and did not add any additional sugar. I prefer oatmeal cookies to be golden but still chewy, 9 minutes in my oven worked out perfectly! I recommend baking for 8-9 minutes for softer cookies or the full 10-12 for crispy cookies. Would make these again."
"0","5","Delicious. My hubby thought they were perfect as he doesn't like a lot of 'extra' things in his cookies! Thanks for the recipe"
"0","5","these turned out great. a fantastic fall cookie"
"0","5","Oh may these were SOOO good they didn't last long. I made with gluten free flour and egg substitute and you could not tell the difference. This is now my go to cookie recipe."
"0","5","Hoping the grandkids would eat these, and being sure that most of today's kids do not eat oatmeal, I ran the oatmeal though the mini processor a little bit. Also added lightly salted peanuts, which ran through the processor as well to make unrecognizable as nuts (those kids!). Because of the peanuts and using salted butter, I used only about 1/2 tsp salt. Did not chill the dough and used a mix of stevia and splenda and white sugar, but all the brown sugar for its part. Used all the cinnamon and gave a shake of allspice for good measure. Did not flatten or grease the pan. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","Very good. Added raisins."
"0","5","These were very good. I made some changes to suit our tastes - I cut the white sugar to 1/2 C and added a 1/4 C local honey. I also cut the brown sugar to 1/2 C, not packed. Still a little sweet, but not too sweet. Also, I add 1/4 C ground flax to almost all of my baked goods, use white whole wheat flour (you can't tell a difference in these) and since I only had 2 C of quick oats on hand, I did substitute Irish Oats for the remaining 1 C. Oh, and I added 1 C of raisins."
"0","4","Great. Could use some less butter and vanilla though."
"0","3","These were okay."
"0","5","SOOO GOOOD made oatmeal cream pie cookies"
"0","5","best cookie recipe I've found. I recommend the full 10 minutes at 375 degrees and do 1/2 the oatmeal as old fashioned oats and the other 1/2 quick oats, otherwise perfect recipe."
"0","5","Moist, chewy & delicious! I added a bit more cinnamon, a pinch or two of nutmeg & about a cup of raisins to make the spices really pop"
"0","5","Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with us Bittersweet1!!!! I used a cookie scoop & air bake cookie sheets (love 'em). Left them in balls and baked for 10 minutes. (Did not refridgerate dough) they were slightly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Made my husband very happy. Making a double batch in the morning. Will put icing on half of them. Taking some to work, I just know I'm gonna become everyone's best new buddy after they consume these...hehe... Thank you once again! Winks!!! Respectfully, birdkitty"
"0","5","These cookies turned out great. I used splenda and they turned out better then the recipe that splenda offered."
"0","5","Perfect texture. These are great."
"0","5","I love this recipe. It tastes like a buttery soft oatmeal cookie with a carmel under-flavor. I placed white and dark chocolate morsels in the batter. This really made the flavor even more incredible. The brown sugar mixed with white gives the cookie a semi-soft texture. For an even softer cookie, substitute the cup of white sugar with half a cup of brown sugar."
"0","4","Easy to make and great taste and softness. I found them a bit bland as I'm used to a recipe that uses cloves but that's an easy thing to add if it suits your taste. This is a great base recipe especially if you're dividing it into halves or thirds to put chocolate chips in one, raisins and cloves in another batch, etc. I also like how this recipe doesn't use lard/shortening as I don't usually keep that on hand."
"0","5","My family loves these!"
"0","5","Love this recipe! I don't press the cookies with a fork and they turn out perfect. This is a treat the whole family loves!"
"0","5","This was an amazing recipe! I followed it as written and the cookies turned out soft, and delicious! My 2n batch I added raisins, and the next batch chopped nuts and raisins and chocolate chips! This recipe is great by itself, but you can add ingredients to fit what you're craving ;) my boyfriend only wants this recipe! Thank you!!!"
"0","4","Very good cookies. Like others, I did not flatten nor add sugar (in fact I reduced the sugar a bit, which I do in pretty much all my recipes), nor did I refrigerate the dough ahead of time. They made perfect drop cookies! Quite chewy and moist. I also added chocolate chips (ah, there's the sugar!), and we really really loved them."
"0","5","These are yummy, cute little cookies. I'm not a fan of oatmeal cookies but these are good. I only had 1 1/2 sticks of butter so I substituted 1/4 cup of nonfat greek yogurt for the extra 1/2 stick and used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats then added a cup of raisins after I chilled the dough in the refrigerator. I rolled the dough into walnut sized balls but skipped the flatten with fork step. They turned out perfectly soft and chewy. I'll be making this recipe again."
"0","5","Delicious and addictive!"
"0","5","These are truly the best oatmeal cookies iv tried! They are soft but yet chewey Delicious! I did add a cup of raisins these are The Bomb!!!!"
"0","5","What an awesome recipe!! I whipped these tasty cookies up in no time! They were soft and chewy! And you can add your own touch with raisins,nuts,chocolate chips or nothing at all...straight up oatmeal! My boyfriend said they were perfect!"
"0","3","THis was very bland for me."
"0","5","My whole family loves these cookies. We've made them at least 3 times since finding the recipe, and they're a hit each time! I never do the sugar fork thing, and we still have great success."
"0","5","This was the first time I've ever made oatmeal cookies and they are excellent! I read about 15 pages of reviews and found many conflicting reports. When I made them, I didn't chill the dough, flatten with a fork, or grease the cookie sheets. They came out perfect after 9 min. @ 375 degrees. I think next time I make them, I'll try some of the variations mentioned by others. Thanx for a great recipe!"
"0","4","This is a very simple and easy recipe. It is also as chewy as it claims.But I think that the yield is off because I was able to make 3 1/2 doz instead of 2. To make sure that they were also moist, I added 1/2 cup mashed banana to the mix."
"0","5","These are very good cookies! I added some raisins to it, and they tasted great!"
"0","5","These cookies are GREAT! So moist and chewy. I added raisins to them."
"0","5","So easy to make and so good. No need to add anything else. Although I would recommend not to add more sugar when pressing them with a fork, they are very sweet. I´ll be making a lot of these."
"0","5","I looooved this recipe!! I was looking for a soft oatmeal cookie since the ones that I had done before were always very hard!! These were perfect!! I used 1 1/2 Cups of sugar and I think that next time I will use a bit less! I also used less oatmeal, I used 2 cups instead of 3!  The sugar on top of the cookies made them look fabulous!"
"0","5","This has got to be one of the best cookies I have baked and ate. I cut the recipe in half, and added a cup of raisins. Left the cookies in a little longer, a little crunch and soft. So good! Saved in my recipe box."
"0","5","These truly are the BEST.COOKIES.EVER!!! I omit the cinnamon and add dark chocolate chips instead. Sometimes I'll add a cup of walnuts or pecans... depends who I'm making them for. I don't flatten the cookies, as recommended in the directions. These cookies turn out chewy and moist and this recipe makes a LOT of cookies. I use a pretty big cookie scooper and I still get about 4 dozen cookies! I make sure I rotate cookie trays, top to bottom and front to back, halfway through baking. I have baking these down to a science! Oh, and I don't grease the cookie sheets... there's enough butter in the dough, so they don't stick. If you love chewy, moist oatmeal cookies, these are for you!!!"
"0","4","Very tasty but I agree with some of the other reviewers... these are very sweet, you could probably use half the sugar called for and still get a very nice cookie, depending on you preference. If you're short on time (which I was), you can cheat a bit and chill these in the freezer for half an hour and the dough will be solid enough to work with."
"0","5","These are really REALLY good. Some have said they are not moist but they ARE! Just don't cook them as long if they are not moist. Not all ovens have perfect temperatures! So cook a small amount, test to see if they are chewy and moist enough for you. If not, LESS time in the oven fixes this and they are soooo WORTH IT!"
"0","5","These cookies were absolutely delicious!!!!"
"0","5","WOW!! Amazing, I doubled the cinnamon as they are a treat for my man and he loves flavor and had to increase the cooking time by ALOT but o wow so amazing!! Defo gonna make this every week if I can :)"
"0","3","Bland, but wow is it filling."
"0","3","I added cranberrys and pecans.... but I noticed it took way longer to cook them....and the don't spread out. Tip: put foil on the baking sheet then spray"
"0","5","Several of my classes used this recipe. Those who followed the directions created delicious cookies and got compliments from those who didn't. They couldn't wait to cook them again."
"0","5","These cookies are so yummy! I'm an avid baker, and finding something that all my family enjoys, AND was easy to make is hard. But these cookies were amazing!  I did cut back on the sugars, using 3/4 cup for both the white and the brown, and they turned out perfect. Also, I did find the need to use cooking spray on the pan so the wouldn't stick, but besides that, they were great. Great flavor and texture! I will surely make them again!"
"0","5","VERY Yum!!! These are wonderful with raisins! Turned out great. Thanks"
"0","5","I thought these were the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. I gave a friend some for her birthday & she said the same thing. My son even likes them & he thinks he doesn't like oatmeal cookies."
"0","5","These cookies are so moist & chewy & are eaten up quicker than how long it took you to make! It goes great with adding raisins/chocolate chips."
"0","4","Excellent Cookie! I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate the dough. I just made these as a drop cookie. I will make these again."
"0","5","very good"
"0","5","My kitchen smells so good. These cookies were fantabulous. They were perfect thin soft in the middle, a little bitty crunch around the outside and did I mention the aroma. I will make them again!"
"0","4","I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cloves and 1/2 c FINELY chopped nuts for extra texture...i left everything else the same and they came out great!   I baked until the edges were golden brown and that gave me crispy edges and chewy centers...perfect. I accidentally over baked one batch (until they were golden brown all over) and these were also great...a little more crunchy, but definitely great.  I will definitely bake these again!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! I just made them with my 41/2 yo daughter to give to her preschool teachers. I cut the recipe in half and added milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. I also only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, otherwise followed ingredients listed. I didn't flatten the cookies either and they came out perfectly flat. A half recipe made thirty 2 and 1/2 inch cookies. They were slightly crispy and chewy! The best oatmeal cookie I've had in a long time. We put a stack of six cookies in a pretty cellophane bag and they looked like they came from a fancy bakery! I will definitely make these again. So easy and good!"
"0","5","I enjoyed this with a few additions! I divided the dough in half and added semi-sweet choc chips/walnuts to one half and craisins to the other. I did everything else the same but added white icing to them once cooled. I made smiley faces/stars on them and they were a HIT at work!"
"0","5","Hubby and I absolutely love these cookies. I like to pair cinnamon with nutmeg, so I added about 1/4 tsp both times I made the cookies. Excellent recipe, easy and fun to make :). One note tho, first time i did not chill the dough, and the batter spread everywhere... still, it tasted wonderful."
"0","5","I FREAKIN' LOVE THESE COOKIES!!!! (and my husband does too!) I cooked mine a little bit longer at 12 min. per batch, and they were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside! YUM!"
"0","5","We love oatmeal cookies and these are the best ever; very soft and cakey. I did not have a cup of butter on hand so used about half a cup of butter or less and added coconut oil to make up for the rest (still did not come to one cup of oil). Still delicious. I did use 3 eggs instead of 2. Perfecto!"
"0","5","most favorite cookie recipe EVER!! (with no raisins!)"
"0","5","I have been looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe like this for so long. I followed this one precisely. It is, hands down, the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had. I can't wait to experiment with adding raisins, chocolate chips, etc. Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","This oatmeal cookie recipe is a Real Keeper."
"0","5","So chewy and delicious! The recipe made around 38 cookies for me."
"0","5","I thought this recipe was spot on! Soft perfectly shaped cookies..and not to flat like some butter recipes can turn out..Minor modifications-didn't chill and flatten the cookies with fork/sugar-no need!Tried a batch on the convection setting on the oven and they didn't flatten as nice..even at a lower temp,so would have to tweak if I were to try the convection setting again..Def my go to oatmeal cookie recipe!"
"0","5","This is the third recipe I've tried searching for a soft and chewy, not cakey, cookie, and it's perfect! I make it with white whole wheat flour, flavored oatmeal (peach is amazing) and add dried cranberries, dark chocolate chips, and almonds."
"0","5","These are very good, crispy in edges and soft in middle. But in Denver and at higher altitudes, I recommend using butter flavor Crisco instead of butter, and reducing temperature to 350 degrees for 9.5 minutes cook time."
"0","5","These cookies turned out amazing! Everyone loved them. I added raisins to half of the batch. They were really good with and without raisins, but I will definitely add them in next time. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Very good, a keeper recipe"
"0","5","SOOO TASTY  a pain that you have to wait a whole hour while they are in the fridge but I guess all that is good in life is worth waiting for:)"
"0","5","Very good recipe. The cookies were truly soft and chewy. I added a cup of raisin. Didn't let cool and they still came out great."
"0","5","The best oatmeal cookies ever!"
"0","5","Delicious! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written, and it was perfect. I'm not sure why the people that did not flatten them with a fork would think that they would turn out to thin if you did, because that is not the case. They are still fairly thick, chewy, moist and delicious. Does make a ton though!"
"0","4","Greeat recipe, makes waay more than 24 though and I did not skimp on the size of them. Soaked a cup and a bit a' raisins in boilin water before addin them it , made er even better"
"0","5","i loved these! I did not chill them, or roll them, just dropped them onto the pan and they turned out fine. like some other users, i split the dough into 3rds, one plain, one with mini chocolate chips, and one with multi colored raisins. they were very soft and tasty - i used sea salt instead of regular salt and i wish i had used a tad more for a little more contrast.. (I did use unsalted butter b/c it was all i had.. so maybe that was it..) - thank you for the recipe it was great and i will make them again!"
"0","5","Very Good, little bit less white sugar."
"0","5","So soft!! I made a half batch- perfect little treat. Added raisins."
"0","5","Ok so I made a gluten free version of this cookie with gluten free oats and flour and OMG I LOOOOOOOVED it!!! They were moist and chewy and just sooo yummy! Dont over grease your cookie sheet or else they spread too thin and I found that they needed 12 mins to bake esp because I made HUGE balls! also dont flatten the balls too much or the cookies will be too flat but other than that they are delish! I added chocolate chips to mine and I can see myself adding many other things in the future like raisins and nuts! great great recipe !"
"0","5","Delicious! I added a bunch of raisins (soaked first) but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I froze a bunch in snack bags and took them out as I needed them, and they all tasted fresh and as good as ever."
"0","5","My husband made these tonight, we used vegan butter instead of regular butter, and they were amazing! We also added chopped apples to half of the batch and they were great also! The whole house smells unbelievable! I highly recommend!"
"0","5","Just made these. I found them amazing, didn't need to chill the mix for long, just 15 minutes in the fridge and they came out fine! Definitely going to bake these again. terrific recipe, really soft and yummy :)"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I added about three tablespoons of orange juice, though. Just to make it a little easier to mix."
"0","5","I used yoga te making cookies because I would either burn them or they wouldn't taste as good! Luckily I came across this recepe and am now in love with baking! I made these cookies for my family, since all in all the recepe said 30 cookies are baked I decided my batter into 3 groups. One was plain, the other was with cranberries and the last one was with walnuts, cranberries and coconut flakes! I deffenetely recommend this recepe to someone who loves crispy cookies on the outside and soft in the center! Thanks"
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookies I have ever tried! I some times skip the cinamon and replace it with 2 tsp of cocoa powder, and YUM! It makes a ton of cookies so be prepared :)"
"0","3","These were okay. Very dry. I added raisons which helped make each bite a bit more moist. There are definitely better recipes out there. Maybe another egg would help???"
"0","4","This recipe was pretty good. Easy to make, which I love, and fast! I tried multiple ways with different batches and I found to get the 'softness' we all know and love, bake for 8 minutes, don't flatten them - keep them in the balls - and when you are letting them cool down, put a cloth over them for 5 minutes and then pack them away in a closed container with some bread. THEY ARE AMAZING. :)"
"0","5","This is a great recipe and works well GLUTEN FREE. I used 3 cups of Bob's Red Mill gluten free oats and 2 cups of King Arthur's (I think it is by far the best) gluten free all purpose flour. To bind it altogether make sure to add 1/4 teaspoon of Xanthan Gum. Instead of greasing a pan, I always line with parchment paper. I also left the cookies in the oven for an extra 2 mins ... as baking time is often flexible in G-free baking. Cool the full 5 mins and then enjoy!"
"0","5","everyone that tries this cookie will love it. i added pecans to mine but to each their own."
"0","5","Wow. My husband and I made these and all I can say is AMAZING. We made the first batch without chilling the dough. We followed the recomendations of other reviews and did not use a fork to flatten them. We rolled them into balls and slightly pressed the center. Perfect. The next batch was the dough that sat chilled for 24 hrs. These took a little longer to bake but end result was the same. They are chewy and moist in the middle, and a little crispy on the outside. Baked both batches on parchment paper. I will try raisens or chocolate chips next time. These are incredible!!!!"
"0","5","I'm not into baking but this was easy and quick. I didn't change anything, this way I know it wasn't my fault if it didn't come out right. Very good but next time I will add dried cranberrys or raisens. This is worth a quick bake and nice results."
"0","5","This was by far the BEST oatmeal cookie I have ever made! I added one cup of dark rasins when I mixed in the oatmeal, did not chill the dough,lightly patted the cookie down with the back of a spoon and baked for exactly 10 minutes. Just perfect! I was able to make 36 cookies dropping by a heaping tablespoon full, cookies where large.  Thanks BITTERSWEET1!!!"
"0","5","What lovely cookies! They're not too sweet, they're chewy and yet firm. Excellent.   Like everyone recommended, I did not flatten them with a sugared fork."
"0","5","I have made these again and again, and for someone who can't seem to make a consistently good cookie, this one has NEVER come out bad! I always half the dough, do raisins in half and chocolate chips in the other half-the whole family loves them!"
"0","5","I have been dubbed the Oatmeal cookie QUEEN because of this recipe. Down to the last detail, everything was perfect. I mixed everything in a mixer and the texture in the end was perfect. I will never use another oatmeal recipe other than this one."
"0","5","These cookies are fantastic. I added a little coconut, raisins and used half coconut and vanilla extract. The only big difference I did. I was out of walnuts in my pantry. I had made some maple fudge a couple of days before, that was loaded with walnuts. The fudge had turn out like a taffy in texture and my husband wasn't eaten it. So I washed the walnuts out of the fudge and used in my cookies. I removed all of the fudge from the walnuts. But, the maple flavor had soaked into the nuts. This gave the cookies a wonderful hind of maple. Next time I think I will soak the nuts for a while in a couple of teaspoons of maple extract before adding to the cookies."
"0","5","AWESOME!"
"0","5","The best cookie ever!!"
"0","3","Cookies are moist, but extremely sweet for my family."
"0","5","I have made these 4 times in the past few months. With the exception of using regular oats instead of quick oats (because it's all I had) and soaking the raisins for a minute in just-boiled water, I stick to the receipe every single time. Clearly the best."
"0","5","DELICIOUS! I made these cookies in 2 batches. The first batch I followed the recipe to the T. The second batch I added 1 cup of RAISENETTES. Both were absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make these again. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! I'm super happy with the outcome! After reading over some reviews, I decreased white sugar to half a cup and cinnamon to 1 tea spoon. I added about 1.75 cups of raisins. Cookies turned out just like I had hoped! Will definitely make these again!"
"0","4","The recipe works with gluten-free flour as well! Mine turned out GREAT. No need to fork the cookies down with sugar... I used less sugar than called for and they are still very sweet. No need to flatten them either as earlier posts warned. Overall, a tasty easy cookie to make!"
"0","5","Awesome cookies! These are soft & moist. I followed the recipe exactly! Will make again and again! :)"
"0","5","I just made these delicious cookies and now have a brand new oatmeal cookie recipe. I rate these a 5 star...mmmmm...good Chewy on the inside and crispy on the edges."
"0","5","Great Recipe. Also added 1cup of raisins."
"0","5","Delicious, and I even made them with whole wheat flour (because that was all I had)! :)"
"0","5","sooo yummy, my whole family enjoyed these. i made some plain and then added chocolate chips in the second batch. the cookies kept their form even when baking!!!"
"0","4","I followed the recipe. These were good."
"0","5","These are soooo good! I tried not to change much,only adding raisins and chocolate chips. I used pumpkin pie seasoning as I was out of cinnamon, and I actually really liked it that way! The mixture was a little crumbly at the end, so I added just about 1tbsp. of milk to bring it all together. These are perfect!"
"0","5","A nice chewy cookie without being oily. Made it according to the recipe and very tasty. Hit the spot! :) Even as they cool, they're still soft!"
"0","5","This is for sure a keeper! Followed exactly and added some choc chips and turned out fabulous, nice and soft and chewy!"
"0","5","Great recipe. Was looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe and this is it. Pretty soft. I used less sugar - 3/4 c. of each, and they were plenty sweet for my taste. I only refrigerated for a bit and then did drop cookies that I flattened a bit with my palm. 8 minutes. My cookies were smaller and got 3 dozen."
"0","5","Great tasting cookie, very moist and delicious. I used only 2c. instant oats. I made some plain, some walnuts and some chocolate chips (i wish i'd had raisins). All were delish."
"0","5","My mother-in-law makes these every year, the only difference is she uses crisco instead of butter. Yum!! I made some yesterday, and did the same, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar over them before baking. I can't stop eating them!!!"
"0","5","These cookies are simply wonderful! They are soft but not too soft. They taste great! My family loves them. My 4 year old loved them, and she is a picky eater, and normally doesn't care for cookies too much."
"0","4","The cookies turned out soft and yummy!"
"0","5","SO DELICIOUS!!!! I even used alternative healthy ingrediants such as coconut butter, oil, and agave! turned out sooo good!"
"0","5","Very good, I added the raisins!"
"0","5","Absolutley fantastic! They were soft and moist! with these cookies you get the best Of both worlds!:) I added in a dash of nutmeg in the mixture and sprinkled cinnamin sugar on top of them when they were done. They were FABULOUS!!!"
"0","5","These were an excellent cookie. I made half a batch (just 2 of us eating cookies here) and it was so easy. The only subtitution I made was i was out of baking soda. (of course I didnt notice until I had all the other ingredients together) I used double the baking powder and omitted the salt and they came out great! Thank you!"
"0","5","The recipe was easy and the cookies turned out so good. My family loves them. I didn't dip the fork in sugar and I used an exopat instead of greasing the pan. I added organic chocolate chips. They were moist and delicious. I love this recipe. I am not typically a baker and usually stick with savory recipes. This is a keeper. Thanks"
"0","5","Galletas divinas para cualquier ocasión y lo mejor rapida y faciles de hacer, personalmente yo le agregue una taza de arandanos y resultaron aun mejor !"
"0","5","These oatmeal cookies were great! I scaled the recipe all the way to just get 6 (can't have too many! I'll eat them all!!) and I got 9 cookies instead. Not that big of a problem, but still tasty. I also popped it in the freezer for 25 mins. instead of refrigerating for an hour. Honestly, that could've been skipped. I made them without raisins but I think I'll add them next time. I also added a bit more cinnamon and some ground nutmeg. Delicious!!"
"0","4","These cookies were so easy to make and they were great. If u want them hard u leave it in the oven for 10 min but if u prefer a softer texture u take them out sooner.My only issue was that the cookies were too sweet for my taste. Drinking milk didn't help mask the sweetness either."
"0","5","Everyone RAVED about these cookies. I’m still fairly new to cooking/baking, so I know it wasn’t my superior cooking-making ability that won them over! ? I do have a few notes. I cut the recipe in half. After I added the oats, I also added a handful of raisins and mixed them into the dough. I refrigerated the dough overnight, instead of the recommended one hour. When I baked the cookies the next morning, it took about 10 – 11 minutes at 375. Aside from that, I stayed pretty true to the recipe. My husband is already begging me to make these cookies again! Thanks so much for the great recipe. The feedback I got from everyone who tried them really helps to build my culinary confidence. :)  PS - I have never rated a recipe before, but I thought this would be a great one to 'pop my reviewing cherry'. Heh heh. Thanks again!"
"0","5","I did what some of the others suggested and added 1 1/2 cups of raisins (what is an oatmeal cookie without the raisins?). I also did the 1tsp of cinnamon and the 1/2tsp of cloves. Basically these are some of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had! Yumm-o!"
"0","4","Thought these turned out really well. Added Nutmeg, and some cloves. Did not press the cookies down."
"0","5","The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Soft and chewy and perfect. I'm normally more of a chocolate fan, but I can't get enough of these cookies. Every time I make them they get rave reviews. I add chopped pecans to the mix, and don't put any sugar on top."
"0","5","Loved this recipe. Made as written (did not dip fork in sugar on top) and rated accordingly. I love soft oatmeal cookies and to achieve a softer version, after taking them out of the oven I flatten them with a fork so they do not continue cooking...leaves the centre a little on the 'raw' side. In my opinion these taste VERY close to the 'Farmer's Market' cookies sold at Real Canadian Super Store in Canada. Perfect!"
"0","5","coming from a person who has never had a cookie turn out..these came out A++++++ i wouldnt change a thing..EXCELENT!!!!"
"0","5","Just made this recipe with no alterations but 1 cup of raisins. Very yummy and soft as promised. In fact, so soft that if you make them too big they will fall apart. Keep them on the small side and they're perfect. The only thing that has be wondering is why does everyone's cookies look so different in the photos?!"
"0","5","These cookies were sensational! I made them just as the recipe calls and they were absolutely perfect. Best oatmeal cookies ever."
"0","5","Yummy Little Crunchy good flavor. my mom made them!"
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookies I've ever had!!! I bake 1/2 the batch as is, for me, then add 1/2 cup raisins to the rest for everyone else."
"0","4","Yummy! Loved these."
"0","5","These were really yummy and really easy to make!  My family really enjoyed them!"
"0","5","These cookies came out so delicious! I will make them over and over. I did not smoosh the cookie down though just left in round ball and it cooked to the perfect thickness was so chewy and wonderful. My family is raving over these. Thanks for sharing we will use this all the time!"
"0","5","THE BEST OATMEAL COOKIES STRONG OATMEAL TASTE , I don't not chill the batter , also no need to press them on top and the sugar on the fork dont do .people didn't like that at all I add cranberry and raisin . came out really good wish I had nuts to add think that would make them even better . will remake this one a lot really go fast . oh when hot out of the oven shake them salt on top really a great touch !"
"0","5","Really good cookie. i didn't have quick oats so used regular and they came out just fine. Did not flatten and cooked 9 minutes. They do look underdone when you take them out but don't be fooled. They are not overly sweet, which we liked."
"0","5","These cookies are great.. I add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of raisens... Oh so yummy."
"0","5","I have used this recipe half a dozen times and I love it. I use whole white wheat flower and substitute applesauce for half of the butter. The cookies come out so soft and moist. This is my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe."
"0","5","made this at the recommendation of a friend.. and loved it! made some changes: added 2 pinches of Epicure's gingerbread spice, 1/3 cup cinnamon chips, 1 cup mini bittersweet chocolate chips. ... they are amazing! did NOT flatten with a fork, baked 9 mins and they were perfect."
"0","4","they were lovely!! I added a little ginger to mine!"
"0","5","Great Recipe! Followed the given directions and then added: *just under 1/2 tsp ground cloves *1/2c of raisins (soaked in a bit of warm water)  I used the #2 'cookie' scoop from pampered chef to get evenly sized cookies. It is a bit larger than a melon baller in size and I did not flatten before baking. They took about 11 min. to cook and five on the sheet to cool. They did not flatten out and they were chewy! :D  My husband and kids LOVED THEM!!!!! Me too!"
"0","5","This was probably one of the best oatmeal cookies recipes I've tried. I didn't have any raisins or chocolate chips, but I had a bag of Heath toffee bits leftover from Christmas. I have had several people tell me that these were the best cookies they've had in a long time... even my husband who is a picky cookie eater!   I didn't find that I needed to refridgerate the dough or flatten the balls. This is definately a keeper!"
"0","5","These are wonderful little sweet treats! Perfect amount of cinnamon! My 2 year old loves them and so do I! Only thing I'd say is, I got in a hurry on the last batch to go in the oven, forgot to press then down with a fork....not a terribly thing, but they don't spread out, so my last batch were very round, thick cookies. I will eat them....if no one else will! ;)"
"0","5","Best cookies ever! I am not a fan of oatmeal cookies in general but these babies are yummy. When my daughter brings them to school all kids fight over these cookies, I make them with chocolate pieces."
"0","5","Easy recipe did not flatten the dough, nice soft chewy cookie. Very tasty my kids luved them. Did add chocolate chips yummy."
"0","4","The flavor of these cookies is awesome! I would say definitely bake them at 350 for about 8 minutes if you want them softer. Like most cookies, these dried out the longer they were 'leftover' (so I agree with another reviewer, they're not exactly 'soft') but the flavor was still great, and you can always microwave them for about 10 seconds to get some of that softness back."
"0","4","Barely sweet. I didn't squash these and they came out moist and cake-like, but I wish I'd sugared the tops or added more sugar to the recipe. Tasty, otherwise. I'll make these again, but sweeter next time."
"0","5","GREAT soft cookie!! I have always used old fashioned oats since I like a hearty texture, but these had a wonderful more even oatmeal texture. I also DID NOT grease the pans and the cookies can off w/ no sticking! :) I added white choc chips and craisins... LOVED by all :)"
"0","5","With the exception of the sugar covered fork, I completely followed the recipe. These cookies were wonderful tasting, easy to make and turned out picture perfect!"
"0","2","Batter tasted Great! I was so excited for them. And then....Looked in the oven and they were as flat as a pancake..I followed someone elses advice and didn't put them in the fridge or do the last step of dipping a fork in sugar."
"0","5","I didn't refrigerate them either, just mixed them up and in the oven they went. I added raisins. Very good!"
"0","2","These were not soft!"
"0","5","Turned out moist and delicious! I had no butter so I used margerine instead. I added pecan pieces and a dash of nutmeg for an enhanced flavor. My husband loved them and so did my 4 yr old! Will make these again."
"0","5","WOW these were so good!!!! I just added 1cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and the rest was original recipe!!!! Thank you :)"
"0","5","Very good! My changes: Reduced white sugar to 2/3 cup (could probably do even less), added 1 1/2 cups raisins, only chilled for about 20 minutes (because I was hungry!) and didn't flatten with fork. Baked about 8:30 to 9 minutes."
"0","5","These cookies are DELICIOUS!!!! I added 1 cup of raisins and followed the recipe as is. Will definetly be maing again! Perfect!"
"0","4","The kids love the cookies and give it 5 stars. However I am not impressed these runny cookies. Even added more flour to the mix I live in TX so not sure if it was an altitude issue but the cookies were a total flop."
"0","5","To me most cookies are too sweet and fattening, so I left out the white sugar and half the butter. I had to add two cups of water to moisten it enough. They were tasty to me and I was very happy with the results."
"0","5","Made these last night. They are great! Followed recipe exactly except I used 50/50 butter and virgin coconut oil. They came out nice and moist, then they crisp up as they cool. MMMM!"
"0","5","Really good & chewy! I didn't chill them or put cinnamon and they still turned out excellent!"
"0","5","These were a big hit. Did make some changes, I added 1/4c. more oats, cut back on the white sugar to 1/2c., added a 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, and added 1 c. raisins. baked at 350 deg. for 9 minutes. Don't overbake."
"0","5","I loved these cookies! I had to add 1/4 cup oats and an extra 1/2 cup flour, but they turned out awesome. They taste great with chocoloate chips! I made a second batch and added a dash of nutmeg, 1 tbs honey and about 1 tsp maple syrup and they tasted even better."
"0","5","These were gone in a flash! The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I can't wait to experiment and add nuts, chip, and fruit!"
"0","5","I make these cookies for my fiance and he loves them so much he won't let anyone else try them! They're amazing, I skip the cinnamon because he doesn't like it and they still taste great!"
"0","5","Simply delicious as is with mini chocolate chips."
"0","5","Absolutely PERFECT! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. My son said that the texture on the outside reminded him of the edges of brownies! I did not change a thing in the recipe, and they were absolutely perfect! Will make these frequently!"
"0","5","Fantastic. Soft and chewy, just like I like them but can never find. I was short 1 cup of rolled oats and tossed in some instant oatmeal - worked just fine. Half my cookies are plain, and half have raisins. The raisin batch needed 2 minutes longer. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","These are the best.. The only thing I will change is the sugar put a little least and of course the butter, next time I will try with whole wheat flour Chewy and nice"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! Very easy to make and everyone loved them!!! I didn't flatten with fork and they were crisp around the edges and soft in the middle... perfect!!"
"0","5","added extra cinnamon and cloves no orange zest a splash of nutmeg and a cup of walnuts very good"
"0","2","Very tasty and soft! Halved the recipe, but was still a 1/2 cup short of oats; so i put in a 1/2 cup coconut. I also added cranberries to half. Will make again!"
"0","5","great oatmeal cookie. substituted 2 cups flour for 1cup oat flour 1cup fresh ground wheat flour I also used unrefined sugar:) turned out fantastic!"
"0","5","OMG! These cookies are soooooo.... good! I made the recipe just like it said and this will be the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use from now on!"
"0","5","Incredible! These cookies are the first actually soft and delicious cookies I have ever made. (Mine usually turned out crunchy on the edges.) I didn't change a thing from the recipe and they were fabulous."
"0","5","Very good--soft. We added a bit more cinnamon because we love the flavor. We used an ice cream scoop to put them on the pan and did not flatten. They turned out perfectly that way!"
"0","5","I am totally new to baking and can generally screw anything up :) These turned out AMAZING! Loved them and SO easy! 'fool-proof' :P"
"0","2","Not sure what all the fuss is about...these are just ok. I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe. Thanks anyway."
"0","5","First time to bake cookies and the results were perfect... varied the recipe by adding 1cup/80g of raisins that had been soaked in apple juice for about an hour. As a base to begin customising, this recipe is perfect..."
"0","5","Great cookie. I added raisins and a tsp of nutmeg to mine and refrigerated for several hours. Did not press flat, just baked in balls as they were and they were thick and chewy just like I like them!"
"0","5","Excellent. My picky son does not like chocolate, or raisins, and is allergic to nuts, so this is perfect recipe for him And super moist just like we all like! I also baked right after mixing, did not refrigerate dough, super easy recipe. Thanks!"
"0","5","Like others, I also didn't refrigerate the dough, roll it into balls & flatten. I simply mixed the ingredients & then dropped the dough onto the UNgreased cookie sheet & baked for exactly 10 minutes. These were perfect & just what I was looking for. Next time, I might add some raisins, chocolate chips, nuts, etc."
"0","5","It's really a great recipe. I make it all the time for my dad, because he loves oatmeal cookies, there really good if you add some raisins, If your looking for a good recipe this is it! And there so moist i have never had better cookies!:)"
"0","5","These were great -- only cooked them for 7 minutes, 8 was too much.... made a fresh batch of homemade buttercream frosting - and took two cookies and made an 'oatmeal cream pie'... our crowd was in love with them!"
"0","5","Great tasting, easy recipe. Only used 3/4 c butter and 1/2 c white sugar. Added tons of chopped walnuts and raisins w/ required amount of oats. Dough was still wet so no need to skimp on them. For some reason, my drop cookies were about 1' in diameter and cooking time was longer than others; about 14 minutes. I lightly patted the top of the drops. Cookies were crisp on the outside and moist and chewy inside. Made 45 cookies."
"0","5","I made a quick half batch, and they cured my craving! Very good, soft, but crunchy! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","Ummm.... yum! I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C butter flavored shortning. And I didn't chill them, or flatten them. Mine took exactly 9 minutes in the oven, and turned out PERFECTLY! They were the perfect 'Welcome home from your first day of first grade!' treat! I'll definitely keep this recipe in my book!"
"0","4","I had a little trouble with the taste because I had no Vanilla. other than that I adored the taste of these delicious cookies!!! :)"
"0","5","I am making these cookies as I write this review and I can tell you they are AMAZING!! I already took one batch out of the oven and they are already gone!! I made it exactly as the recipe says and they are yummy!"
"0","5","These are really good. The only trouble I had was when I rolled them walnut size the middles didn't cook, so I rolled them 1 inch size. Could be me trying to cook in a gas oven when I am used to electric or because I cut the 3 cups of oats to 2 cups and added a cup of raisins. Nevertheless, once I straightened that out I am still very pleased with this recipe."
"0","4","I made these for my kids and they were gone in about 18 hours. The only change I would make is to add some extra butter to bring out the buttery flavor. Also, I squashed the dough balls between my palms and the cookies turned out great."
"0","5","This is the best-tasting oatmeal cookie that I have ever tasted. I used unsalted butter, and did not add any raisins or nuts."
"0","5","amazing! Soft and chewy every time!"
"0","5","So great, these are going fast! I made some with chocolate chips and some with raisins.. those with chocolate chips I'd cut the cinnamon back on but the ones with raisins were perfect. These tasted a tad salty to me but they might not taste right if that's cut back? Anyways - these are very good and soft! :)"
"0","5","Perfect! Just like everyone else, I left out the chilling step and didn't flatten the cookies. They are delicious! I used regular oats instead of quick and used applesauce to replace the eggs (1/4 c. for each egg)."
"0","4","i wasn't completely in love with these the first time i made them. the more i made them the more they grew on me. my husband loved them right off the bat. they are really moist and chewy. i tried making them plain, with raisins, and with chocolate chips - favorite by far was with raisins."
"0","5","These were amazing. By far the best oatmeal cookie recipe out there."
"0","4","This is a good start for a recipe. It's nice and soft. I found it to be bland. Next time I'll add a few more spices. I also added about 3/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the batter which I thought was a good addition."
"0","5","Best I have EVER made!!!!!"
"0","5","WOW!!!!! These were the most amazing oatmeal cookies I have ever had, they even beat my grandmother's recipe! I didn't press the very flat so they were nice and moist through and through. Thanks!"
"0","5","Very good cookies! It made more than stated on here, so just be prepared for extra cookies which it's a problem for me. : )"
"0","5","I added mixed berries(dried) and some honey, and of course chocolate chips(milk choc) made them golden brown, sweet, chewey, and delicious. And just a little healthier."
"0","5","so easy. Soooo GOOD!"
"0","5","This was a great cookie I only used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and they came out perfect !!"
"0","5","Wonderful cookies. Everytime I make them people love them!"
"0","1","Got way to crunchy and thin. Good flavor."
"0","5","I have made these several times now and my family loves them. I add some mini chocolate chips and go a little heavy on the cinnamon. YUM!"
"0","5","very good and so soft my daughter loved this will make again"
"0","5","looove reading everyones reviews and suggestions! thank you!!!"
"0","5","I persoanlly didn't follow the recipe to the detail. What's amazing about it was because it was chewy. I had used a bit of instant oatmeal [the one for mornigns]. It was quite yummy! My friends complemented me the entire day saying how good it was."
"0","5","so, so, so, so good......just the dough alone barely lasted as I was baking the cookies. I used 2 cups oats and 1 cup chocolate chips, the cinnamon taste is really good. Will be making these over and over again. As others suggested I only chilled my dough for 15 minutes, no need to flatten cookies, just roll into balls and place on a cookie sheet."
"0","5","These were fantastic! Made them exactly to the recipe and then I split the batter and added raisins to one half and chocolate chips to the other. Great! They stayed nice and chewy too!"
"0","5","My kids usually do not like Oatmeal cookies but I used this recipe and added raisins and they ate them all up. I even made some for our Church youth group's Bake sale and they were a hit!!!!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!!"
"0","5","amazing as is...everyone raved about them! super yum!"
"0","5","The Best oatmeal cookies ever. I divided the mix in half and put chocolate coated raisins in on half.They were a hit with everyone.Mmmmmm"
"0","5","OMG!!!!!! the best oatmeal cokkie EVER!!!! So quick, ez, and moist...... Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","These were DELICIOUS!! Everyone loved them! I cut the batch in half a couple times so I could do some with raisins and some with chocolate chips. I still wanna do one more version of craisins with choc. chips yumm. I've already gone through a huge tin of oats making them."
"0","5","Didn't refrigerate or roll into balls and it turned out wonderfully!"
"0","5","Love it! Will make it again."
"0","5","This is a great recipie I added a cup of chopped pecans and one mashed bananna for a little twist because of the bannana I added half a cup more of the oats."
"0","5","I added a cup of pecans and a cup of raisens! Great recipe! They turned out soft! Only thing i did was skip the hour in the fridge. Didnt even need it apparently because they were perfect!"
"0","5","My family loved these cookies. I added raisins and they were great."
"0","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried so far. I have made it several times and people raved! I did not refrigerate the dough. A good cookie that is not too soft. This is a keeper."
"0","5","WOW. These were super easy and sooooo good. I reduced the cinnamon amount to 1 tsp... perfect!"
"0","5","I've always failed at oatmeal cookies, but this was definitely a winner. I tossed in some raisins and they were perfect!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe! My kids said this is the only cookie I can make now, and that's saying something!"
"0","5","I made these for my son's snack day at school. All the kids loved them. They were very soft and I loved the cinnamon flavor. They didn't make it through the day before they were eaten!"
"0","5","These were really delicious and chewy. I added half a cup of golden raisons and just a little bit less brown sugar and it was perfect."
"0","5","I found these cookies to be excellent. I was worried that they would be plain but they had a great flavor. They were soft and chewy the day after I baked them. A good choice of oatmeal cookie for someone who doesn't like raisins, but I'm sure they'd be even better if you added some."
"0","5","This was amazing! Everyone asked me where I bought these cookies. I added slivered almonds and chocolate chips. These are awesome!"
"0","4","Subbed shortening for butter (was out). Was also out of vanilla: added an overripe banana to make up for the flavor. On account of my changes, cookies tasted amazing, but were perhaps a little chewier than expected. Still, they were so so good, and everyone loved them."
"0","4","I really liked this recipe. Now I can say that I can make any kind of oatmeal cookie right too instead of just chocolate chip. I made these cookies as oatmeal raisin cookies and only gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 because I made a few changes to increase flavor and for a substitution, and halved the recipe: I used unsalted sweet cream butter in the Great Value generic Brand (Wal-Mart) (not a change really but wanted to let you know what butter I used) I added 1/4th a teaspoon of cinnamon (so that would be 1 and one half teaspoons for those using the full recipe) I added 1/4th a teaspoon of nutmeg (which would be half a teaspoon for those using the full recipe) I didn't have any vanilla extract left and didn't want to go to the store to instead I used two times the amount of French Vanilla coffee creamer instead. I also added nearly 1 cup of raisins. (for half of the recipe, which for full recipe users would be almost 2 cups if you love raisins as much as I do or just 1 cup of you're not too crazy about them) I kept the dough in the fridge for about 3 hours. As for other changes, I made none. Some say that the flattening of the cookies before baking wasn't needed but I found that mine didn't flatten much at all while baking so I had to. You turn out with some soft and chewy, flavorful and super moist Oatmeal Raisin cookies cookies. How long do they stay this way? I have no idea because none have ever lasted longer than a few minutes in my house!"
"0","5","I made these for a party at school. I brought 24 cookies for a class of 10. There weren't ANY LEFT. The batter was very dry while mixing it so I added a tablespoon of water."
"0","3","I made the cookies exactly as the recipe states and I find the cookies to be average. Don't get me wrong, they were good and soft (even overnight in the fridge) but I felt like these cookies were missing something, maybe more spice or something. They just seemed...average."
"0","5","Very soft, chewy and moist. Very good dipped in milk, wonderful comfort food! I used the recipe as directed except for adding a 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I rolled the dough into balls and placed on UNgreased cookie sheets. I used non-stick sheets. I baked the cookies for exactly 9 minutes and they were not overdone. The cookies slid right off after 5 minutes of cooling on the sheets. I could not find my wire rack so just put them on a plate after cooling them on the sheet. These are nice cookies."
"0","4","they were okay. im not sure if i did some thing wrong they came out pretty thin. but probably had nothing to do with the recipe, prob just my mistake"
"0","5","My daughter has made these several times for family, friends, teachers...but doesn't mash them down with a fork, just rolls them in balls and bakes them in the oven. She is a vegetarian so these ingredients work with her diet. If you leave them in the oven a little longer like we've done on accident, they are crispy and great. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Thanks for posting!!"
"0","3","Good basic cookie but will try others. The dough is so dense that it strained my professional grade mixer!"
"0","5","best cookies I've ever tasted!"
"0","3","the taste of these cookies is nice, but I substituted splenda and they turned out really really dry. I was disappointed because I selected them on the basis that they were supposed to be soft and chewy."
"0","5","I love this recipe! Very easy and wonderful. I didn't chill the dough or press and they came out beautifully. Next time I think I'll add white chocolate chunks and craisins like someone else suggested. YUM!"
"0","4","I'd give these about 4.5 stars. They were a nice snack for my son's class: kid-friendly but not chock full of sugar! I did cut back on the sugar a bit and I bumped up the cinnamon and added just a little nutmeg. They were nice and soft for about a day after I baked them, but they hardened fast - so eat them quickly! If yours turn out as well as mine did, they won't last long. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","FANTASTIC recipe. One of the best oatmeal cookie recipes ever. I did tweek it slightly - I used slightly over 2 cps rolled oats and I added 1/2 cp Bob's Red Mill flax meal and 1/4 cp oat bran, sprinkling of raisins & scant amount of carob chips. They keep very well. I also agree that I didn't flatten them - like them nicer when puffy. Cooked a good 10 min."
"0","5","great reciepe.... 10 mins worked very well for these cookies and the cinnamon gave it the extra touch!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! It stays soft and chewy for days. I put about 3/4 cup of sugar and a little over 2&1/2 cups of oats and added in about 3/4 cups of raisins. I shaped the cookies larger which took a few minutes extra in the oven. I made the mistake of overcooking them because they didn't look as cooked. But that left the cookies dry and hard. When I take them out they may look a little undercooked or light but they are perfectly done and tend to darken once they start to cool. Kids love them, my little brother always asks me to make these for his class parties."
"0","5","These are great cookies. I didn't have time to chill them, so I just mixed and made them right then, and they came out perfectly. They were a hit a my house."
"0","5","Loved these cookies! Incredibly chewy if you don't over bake them."
"0","5","this is a great cookie. it simple and tastes great. i added a pinch of ginger and chopped walnuts. i chopped up 3 little boxes of those snack raisins (that all i had in the house). all i can say is wow. Next time I'll will add some dried apples. i will make these again soon! believe that! this cookie gets 5 Woots!"
"0","5","I love oatmeal cookies but I also like soft cookies! This is the best of both worlds! My 18 year old son who doesn't even chew even said these are really good! My daughter LOVES to cook and loves to try and collect different recipes, she threw our old favorite out and made this the new default recipe!"
"0","5","I've never done very well with oatmeal cookies but these are wonderful! The entire family loved them. The kids didn't even TRY to pick out the good stuff (raisins and nuts I added)."
"0","5","This is ABSOLUTELY the greatest oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever tried. Everyone that has tried these loved them so much, that I am now being asked to make them for parties! Great recipe! The only thing that I do differently is add a little more cinnamon & vanilla. Yummy."
"0","5","I thought there were fabulous and quite chewy. I did just a couple of modifications. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and it gave it a wonderful taste/aroma. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white. YUMMY!"
"0","5","Yummy! Made exactly the way the recipe read and...yummy!"
"0","5","Everybody loved these"
"0","5","WONDERFUL COOKIES!! I have been looking for oatmeal cookies that don't harden after they cool. These were perfect. Chewy and moist my two year old loved them."
"0","5","BEST OATMEAL COOKIES EVERRRRR!!!! i halved the recipe and added 2/3 cup of golden rasins. will make again and again!!"
"0","3","I just made these cookies. The taste of them is very good. But they came out very flat and some of them burned. 375 degrees would seem to be way to hot an oven. Next time, I will try them at 325 or 350. Since my family loves Cimamon, I used a tablespoon, which was good for us."
"0","5","I added some coconut and chocolate chips. They were yummy and stayed soft and good. The recipe made 52 cookies. Mine must have been smaller."
"0","5","These were great. I did add a pinch more salt and some sprinkles of nutmeg, but they were definitely soft and definitely yummy. The batter makes soooo many cookies! I wrapped half in plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge for later. I will definitely be making these again."
"0","4","awesome. i only baked them for about 4.5 minutes and they came out super soft, they were to be served the next day so i thought i'd make them super gooey. these cookies are amazingly delicious!!!!"
"0","5","Turned out perfect. I used whole wheat flour and all organic ingredients."
"0","4","pretty good for plain oatmeal cookies"
"0","5","Ingredient-wise I followed everything on here. I did add 1/2tsp of cloves and 1C of raisins. I didn't flatten the cookies before baking or refridgerate the dough. They were wondeful."
"0","5","Great cookies if you love cookies dough! The outside of the cookie is slightly crunchy but the inside is doughy like the dough. I love it and will defiantly make it again."
"0","5","My go-to Oatmeal Cookie recipe. It never fails & super easy. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Very good easy, cookie. My 9 year old is wanting to learn to bake and she measured and mixed all the ingredients by herself, when they were baked she was so proud of her success!"
"0","5","Very tasty cookie! I added a 1/4 cup of wheat germ (for extra iron and protein), omitted the cinnamon, and 1 cup of butterscotch chips (for extra yumminess)! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","These cookies were awesome. I left the recipe as is, except i added a whole box of raisins. Baked until lightly browned, and they were very moist. Loved them!"
"0","5","Delicious!! TRY AND ENJOY If you dont want to cool batter for an HOUR in the fridge put the bowl with batter in it iside the freezer for about 10 min. That's it. You can skip the fork flattening trick. Cookies are yummy!!!"
"0","4","My husband loves oatmeal cookies, he really enjoyed these. I doubled the vanilla, used half whole wheat flour, reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp, used 1 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp baking soda added 1/2 cup each of raisins and chocolate chips. Did not dip fork in sugar and didn't chill dough. Used my #50 scoop that yielded 44 cookies which baked in 12 minutes on Silpat lined baking sheets. Yield and baking time are way off."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. The cookie dough was a little dry, but that may have been my fault (I ground the quick oats because that is how I like my oatmeal cookies). I just added a little condensed milk until it was a better consistancy. I don't know what people were talking about when they said there was too much butter and it melted into flat oily cookies-maybe they did not properly chill the dough?? My cookies came out thick and soft. I did 1/2 according to the recipe and 1/2 wtih peanut butter chips. Both were delicious."
"0","5","WOW! PERFECTION! These are the absolute BEST! Even better the next day. They came out exactly like the picture. Perfect texture and flavor. Would not change a thing. Make sure you beat everything for long enough--should be light and fluffy after you beat the eggs in. I added golden raisins and chopped walnuts. Next time I'm going to try butterscotch or PB chips. My whole family went ga-ga for these. Definitely a keeper in my recipe collection."
"0","5","wonderful. no complaints here."
"0","5","Awesome oatmeal cookie! I added 1/2 tsp. of clove like another reviewer recommended. The only other change I made was turning it into one big, long, 57' cookie just for fun with the kids."
"0","5","These were really great. I jazzed them up by adding dried cherries, white chocolate chips, and chopped pistachio nuts. The only problem I has with them is they did not spread very well which is why I guess people said to press them down a bit. I'll be making these again for sure."
"0","5","Great recipe...I also did not flatten the cookies and added walnuts. They came out great. Thank you!"
"0","5","These were great, followed recipe exact. Didn't flatten the cookies though as I am at a higher altitude. Separated into three batches, first-mixed dried berries and walnuts, second-maple chips, third-maple chips and semi-sweet chips. All turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT! This is the perfect recipe. This is just like i remember from being a little girl.. Now if i could just figure out how to get some light airy whipped icing to make sandwiches....yummy."
"0","5","I took another reviewers tip on not chilling the dough and not flattening the cookies with a sugar coated fork. Cookies turned out great."
"0","5","I just made a batch of these oatmeal cookies and they are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had! I did add the cup of raisins and they were absolutely perfect! I've also added walnuts, and they are amazing. Bakery style cookies for sure."
"0","5","I added white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts & these were perfection!!!"
"0","5","Very good cookie! I find that freezing the batter before baking does wonders for this cookie."
"0","5","These cookies are SO good! Made them for my fiancee and now he expects them every weekend!"
"0","5","Great cookies! Got many compliments on them. Next time I will add raisins but great recipe!"
"0","5","YUMMO!! These cookies are to die for. I should know, I only ate about six of them out of the oven. lol Easy prep and delightful to the taste buds. My DH asked if they had butter in them?? YAAAA!! Thanks for sharing with us. PS, I put a cup of raisins in also."
"0","5","This recipe is great!! I had to add raisins...I love those. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","The search is over for Oatmeal cookies!!! I tried so many over the years these are so chewy and just perfect! I didn't have time to refrigerate it so I just baked them and sprinkled sugar on top, also added raisins. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","Great cookies! Easy to prepare, and came out perfectly! After I read the last review saying this would be the end of my oatmeal cookie recipe search, I just had to try it. They were right! I made no changes and my family loved them!"
"0","5","Very easy to make. I loved that the dough doesn't spread. I was able to get 13-14 cookies on one baking sheet, which was a relief as I was short on time."
"0","4","One of the best cookies I've ever made. I added a cup of pecans and raisens."
"0","5","Excellent cookie recipe. I did add a few handfuls of raisins. They turned out soft and chewy, look just like the photo."
"0","5","Yummy! I added smarties, kids FAV!"
"0","4","I really enjoyed baking these cookies and could tell they would be soft and delicious as soon as I stirred in the walnuts. The first batch was trial and error, overbaked them for a minute. When I baked them for exactly 8 mins, they really lived up to their name...soft oatmeal cookies. Delicious."
"0","5","I added heath bar bits and chocolate chips- WOW!!! Best oatmeal cookie recipe I've found by far!"
"0","5","this was a great recipe, i didn't have butter so i used margarine and it still turned out. i love tat u can add almost any thing to make it your own cookie. i will make this recipe again."
"0","5","So soft, most and chewy. The cookies always disappear very quickly once made. I double the recipe then divide the dough in four and make regular, chocolate chip, raisin and craisin varieties, very good. Will continue to use this recipe for sure."
"0","5","perfect!!!!!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe except for the freezing and sugar fork part and they were delicious! I baked for about 9 minutes to keep them soft. This was the 2nd recipe I found and I wish it was the first- ran out of oatmeal and halfed it all- came out fine!"
"0","5","These cookies are excellent. I made some additions to the recipe. 1). 1 tsp of butter vanilla extract and 1 tsp of princess cookie dough extract. (Can order extract from Lorannoils.com). 2). 1/2 cup of baking golden raisins and 1 cup of pecans (crushed). 3). Bake for 8 mins. 4). Use parchment paper on cookie sheet"
"0","5","Very good cookies! I used shortening instead of butter for a dairy free cookie!"
"0","4","This recipe is a good one! I boiled 1 cup raisin's in 1 cup water for 8 minutes, to plump them up,drained, then added them as well as dropped the cinnamon down to 1 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp of All spice. they were great!"
"0","4","substituted with wheat flour and ended up somewhat dry and firm. will try a second time with original recipe, but even then, the first batch was wonderful with a little milk and honey."
"0","5","Outstanding!"
"0","5","I made these cookies for Thanksgiving and added white chocolate chips and dried cranberries. There were none left a day later! These cookies are chewy and have a lot of flavor."
"0","4","This recipe is pretty good, but the cookies aren't as moist as I had hoped. I didn't roll them into balls, but used my cookie scooper and they came out a nice shape. These took the full 10 min in my oven. I added raisins to half of the batter and I much prefer the ones w/raisins to the ones w/o. I will make this again, but will add raisins to the whole batch."
"0","5","These absolutely rock. Outstanding!"
"0","5","My family loves these. I added raisins and extra cinnamon."
"0","5","These cookies did turn out soft. I even added about 1 1/2 tsp of honey. An over all excellant cookie."
"0","4","Good but not great"
"0","5","best oatmeal cookies ever!"
"0","5","instead of using cinnamon try using cinnamon chips oh so yummy the chips can be found in the grocery store now thru dec, you can order them on line at hershey.com"
"0","5","So good! I added about 1 1/3 cups of chocolate chips and a splash (about 1/2 tsp) of almond extract along with the vanilla. Following what other reviewers stated, I didn't press the cookies flat. They the third pan is just coming out of the oven and omg! I can't stop eating them!! So good!!"
"0","5","I made them just as the recipe indicated. I split the dough and added raisins to part and chocolate chip chunks and walnuts to the rest. They are both amazingly good. I rolled into balls and did not flatten, I like thick gooey cookies and that is exactly what I got. VERY GOOD, they will not last more than a day or two in my house."
"0","5","Awsome recipe I used chopped dried tropical fruit in them and it was yumbalicious!"
"0","5","WOW! This is fantastic! We halved the recipe to make a dozen and added: 1/2 super-mashed/pureed banana. Talk about amazing! We also tried variations with banana, raisin, and chocolate chip = YUMTASTIC! And, banana, chocolate chip, walnut = YUMMIERTASTIC! I agree with previous reviewers - no need to dip fork in sugar or even to roll them into balls. We just spooned it."
"0","3","My cookies came out completely flat. I did not flatten them with a fork and was expecting thick, soft cookies. The flavor was good though.. just wish they weren't flat as a pancake."
"0","5","these are amazing cookies. Because I like raisins in my oatmeal cookies I added them but, they would be fantastic without the raisins too. Best I've had."
"0","2","I found these to be dry after one day."
"0","5","These are wonderful!!! Very easy and very goog!"
"0","5","These cookies came out great-I made half with raisins and the other half with choc chunks. I did notice the second batch came out thicker(which I prefer) and I think it was because the dough was in the fridge longer."
"0","5","Excellent! I split the dough in a half and put semi sweet chips in half..and keep the other half plain. I slightly pushed the dough ball down, slightly! I did not add sugar to it either. SOOO good.. gone in two days! Soft chewy Delicious."
"0","5","Yummy. Great tasting and easy to make."
"0","5","very good! My kids loved them too, which is great!! A healthy cookie. I did not put them in the refridgerator, I was pressed for time, and they turned out wonerful!"
"0","5","These cookies are DELICIOUS!! These were my first (successful) batch of cookies and they made me feel like 'WOW! I CAN MAKE SOMETHING THIS YUMMY!' I added walnuts to the recipe and I can't stop eating these cookies. So soft and chewy!"
"0","4","As far as the taste goes, you can't go wrong. They are wonderful! However, my cookies were not soft. Even if they looked soft and puffed up when I took them out of the oven, they immediately fell into flat, crunchy cookies. I didn't flatten them pre-oven as some have suggested. Someone advised me to use half softened butter, half butter flavored Crisco to give the cookies a softer, fluffier look."
"0","4","My whole family loves these cookies. I added a cup of re-hydrated golden raisins as well as just a pinch more cinnamon. They are easy, fun to bake with the children and get wonderful reviews no matter where we take them! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
"0","5","these are the best oatmeal cookies ever.they stay soft and have a great flavor.easy to make.be sure to make extra they dont last."
"0","5","I have made oatmeal cookies in the past and they were just so so or hard but this one was the best I have ever made. My husband who is always critical actually loved these and thought they were nice and moist. This is officially my oatmeal cookie recipe! I will however use a little less sugar otherwise everything else is ok."
"0","5","my husbands response was wow. i was so pleased, he liked them. easy recipe. i added a pinch of allspice."
"0","5","I liked this recipe a lot ,and will use again , however will cut the sugar by 1/4. I will also try with WW flour and Splenda as suggested. Also, I drop cookies on sheet, they spread nicely as they cook."
"0","5","The best!!!"
"0","5","This is an excellent basic oatmeal cookie recipe. Just the right amount of spices, sweetness and saltiness. I've added chocolate chips, I've tried cranberries, and served them plain. All versions were a hit. The only thing I change is to use a tiny bit less of the butter called for, which helps them not flatten out too much. I will definitely continue to use this recipe again and again!"
"0","5","Great Oatmeal cookies. I baked them yesterday and so far they are still soft and chewy. Great tasting. I made two batches, one with raisins and one without. Both are good, but I prefer the raisins. I as well didn't push them down with a fork before going in the oven, I just kept them in a ball and they still melted down kinda thin. My only con to the cookie is that it didn't stay plump. I will definitely bake them again, and would set out for company."
"0","5","Excellent oatmeal cookie! I added 1/2 cup each of chocolate chips, raisins and coconut. I also used rolled oats instead of quick oats."
"0","5","Great cookies, I added raisins, dried apple pieces, peanuts, sunflower and pumpkin seeds. They turned out so good I will definitely be making them again."
"0","5","Yumilicious. I used 1 stick of butter instead of 1 cup. Also 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 1 cup. They turned out perfect. No need for all the extra calories! This one's a keeper! This is a good base recipe that allows you to add whatever you want. I did one batch with dark choc. chips, another batch with white choc. chips, dried cranberries, coconut and crushed pecans, another batch with raisins, and the final batch with butterscotch chips and crushed pecans. Fantastic gourmet cookies. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","OM MY GOSH! These are the BEST cookie I have EVER ate!!! You have the best oatmeal cookie recipie! I'm gonna make them again tonight! :)"
"0","5","This is the first time I've ever made cookies and I just have to say that they came out absolutely gorgeous! I didn't leave the dough to rest, as another reviewer suggested, and just formed them into balls straight away. They are slightly on the sweet side for me so I would reduce the amount of sugar the next time I make them and they would be great with some added nuts/raisins/berries too. But even as they are, they're great, do try the recipe! :)"
"0","5","These cookies are fabulous! The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made!"
"0","5","I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of raisens. Turned out yum!"
"0","4","I made them with chocolate chips very good!"
"0","5","This was the best cookie i have ever had for sure i added a extra 1/2 tea of cinamon and chocolet chips and rasins BEST COOKIES IN THE WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Best cookie EVER EVER EVER! I made some with raisins, some with butterscotch chips, some with chocolate chunks, but the best were my ultimates: raisins, butterscotch, and chocolate chunks. oh soooo good! I can't even make them again because I love them too much!"
"0","4","very good"
"0","3","I almost gave these 4 stars cause my husband liked them. In my opinion there's waaay too much sugar in this recipe. The sugar hides the flavor of the oats. Also, not sure how you only get 24 cookies if you follow the directions? I scooped mine out into 'walnut' sized balls and I got 50 cookies exactly. There was also no reason to refridgerate the dough. I think there are better oatmeal cookie recipes out there!"
"0","5","they are yummy...added chocolate chips, did not refrigerate or flatten...they turned out wonderful...."
"0","4","Barefoot Contessa's pecan raisin oatmeal cookies are way better. But these are good cookies. :)"
"0","5","OH MY GOD!This is best oatmeal cookie I have ever made I love this recipe. I added a cup of raisins and didnt chill the dough, I have made 3 batches this weekend.I will defeinatly make again."
"0","5","Absolutely AMAZING! I normally make chocolate-chip or sugar cookies for my family and I got a request to make oatmeal. I had never done so, therefor I knew I had to do deep research to find the perfect recipie. I honeslty didnt have to look to far because this was the 4th one I looked at and the 1st one I made. The whole family was extremmly pleased especially my father and his raisins. Haha. But I would defeinatly recommend this recipie to all cookies bakers :] They were soft, chewy, and not have too little or too much sweetness. Enjoy!!"
"0","5","WOW! Great recipe! Very easy to make. I went ahead and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also, I did not refrigerate or press down with a sugar covered fork. They did need the full 10 minutes. I will definitely make this again, this is a keeper!"
"0","5","Excellent! Just made them with my little girls, so I didn't bother to chill or to roll into balls. They still turned out great! I added raisins, and I love them."
"0","5","Fantastic! recipe to make additions to; dried bluberries, cranberries, walnuts! Chewy and slightly crisp edges, with balanced flavors. A keeper!"
"0","5","Very good. Added some dark chocolate chips in them."
"0","5","Excellent oatmeal cookie - moist and chewy. Added 1/2 less sugar and they were sweet enough. Also, did not use sugar to flatten cookie. Will add raisins and nuts next time."
"0","5","Love this recipe. I like the fact it just uses butter without shortening or oil. Added a 6 oz. bag of dried cranberries and a couple handfuls of Giradelli's dark chocolate chips. Very moist with a great flavor."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","These are very good and I am addicted to them. I am trying to eat them till I am sick, but so far I just keep making more and more. I bake late at night when I don't have to share and no one will catch me. I added 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 1/3 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup roasted pecans. Oh boy!!"
"0","4","I just made a batch of these cookies and they were yummy. Although some of my cookies burnt up a lil at the bottom. I suggest lowering the oven to 350 and baking 10-12 mins."
"0","4","These cookies are really good! I added a cup of walnuts to mine and they are so delicious. You may want to add another cup of flour to this recipe though, the first batch I put in was too flat. Maybe adding the walnuts changed something? Who knows, but they sure are good!"
"0","3","I followed it exactly and they were good. I did chill the dough a bit and did not flatten them. I thought the temp at 375 was going to be too high so I did them at 350. They came out pretty flat. I have used the recipe on the oatmeal container for awhile and I thought I would seek out something new/better. The one person that said the dough was dry did something wrong as the dough was very moist/wettish. I think I would prefer an oatmeal cookie to be slightly 'thicker'"
"0","5","I added raisins and walnuts, and they were sooo good."
"0","5","I made these the other weekend and they were wonderful! I did make a couple changes though. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, Splenda instead of sugar, and I added about ¼ tsp of nutmeg, white chocolate chips, craisins, and chopped nuts. They were gone before the night was over, and I made them after nightfall!"
"0","3","These were good, but not great. The recipe needed a bit of tweaking. The dough was too dry to for everything to adhere properly, so an extra egg was needed. The bottoms baked too rapidly so the oven rack needed to be raised. The oven temperature needed to be lowered to make them 'soft and moist'...and they are not really a moist cookie. That having been said, they were ordinary, good cookies, not great."
"0","5","I tried oatmeal cookies before, but i must admit, these are the best I have tasted. I plan on cooking these over and over again :)"
"0","5","Didn't flatten, didn't put sugar on top. 1/2 batter we added chopped dried cherries, the other, nothing. Delicious!!"
"0","4","Pretty good. I made them with cranberries and was glad I did cause otherwise they would be a little bland. Also, I pressed some of them flat with a fork and sugar, and left some of them in a ball. The ones in a ball came out much better. They were softer and tasted better."
"0","5","Excellent. I barely flattened the rolled cookie dough balls with a fork. Didn't put sugar on the fork. Such a good recipe!"
"0","5","Simply.....'the best'."
"0","5","This was my first time making oatmeal cookies and they came out perfect. I added about 1- 2 cups of raisins and it worked out good. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Made this for me and put it the freezer for future snacks. Started noticing my DH and my health conscious 16 y.o. visiting the freezer more than usual and realized they're after my oatmeal cookies! Great right out of the freezer. I added raisins & chopped peanuts."
"0","5","I absolutely love these cookies. I add Craisins and white morsels to the cookies. Also, to keep them moist I put a piece of bread in the container to soak up any moisture. Fantastic!!!!!"
"0","5","The best cookie I have ever had. My husband and my brother-in-law both agreed. Never changing to another recipe ever. I just shaped into balls, rather then press flat."
"0","5","These were really good...very soft & chewy. The first batch I made, i didn't refrigerate the mixture & it was hard to roll into little balls so the cookies came out flatter. By the time I made the 2nd batch, the mixture had been in the fridge for a day so it was more firm & easy to roll into balls. After rolling into balls I dipped the balls in white sugar and baked for 8 minutes exactly. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for 1 minute & then moved to a cooling rack. They came out soooo soft, chewy, and delicious! Will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","I usually don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were fabulous! I maked them for 8 minutes only and took them immediately off the cookie sheet to keep them soft. This is a keeper!"
"0","5","These were the best oatmeal cookies my co-workers have ever eaten. Taste great with chocolate chips as well."
"0","5","After reading the reviews I reduced both sugars by about 2 tbs each and added choc chips and coconut. These were fantastic!"
"0","5","They came out perfect. I didn't flatten them just dropped them like regular. The only problem is I can't stop eating them. Yum!!!"
"0","4","I loved them but I have to agree with the review below me. You don't need to flatten them down if you want a chewy cookie."
"0","5","Yummy! My family enjoyed them. I'm not that talented when it comes to baking desserts (I rarely eat them), but it's hard to butcher this recipe. Upon recommendation, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground clove. I didn't try it with the 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, so I can't tell which is better. I just know that they were superb with the 1/2 tsp of ground clove. I also used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of Smart Balance rather than 2 sticks of butter. Gotta keep the cholesterol at bay. It was still great. Thanks for a lovely recipe!"
"0","5","This cookies are so yummy! I was looking for a recipe similar to the Oatmeal cookies my grandmother used to make, soft and chewy. These cookies fit the bill and they were so good! Will definitely be making again and again and will add various things like choc. chips and butterscotch chips every now and then. MUST TRY!"
"0","4","I had to come up with cookies for a bake sale that I did not know about and was unprepared for - so I had to use several substitutions. Even with the changes, the cookies turned out tasty, although not that attractive. I didn't have enough butter, so I substituted shortening for 1/2 of the butter, and I ran out of flour so I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat. Due to timing issues, I couldn't chill the dough for more than about 15 minutes. I used a cookie scoop and didn't flatten with a sugar coated fork. The cookies flattened considerably, but they were soft. I also added choc.chips which made them even better. Next time I will try these with the correct ingredients to see if they turn out prettier"
"0","5","I've add 1 cup of Dried Cranberries,It was very good."
"0","5","I loved these cookies!!! I forgot to put the cinnamon in with the dry ingredients. So, I mixed some cinnamon in with some sugar and rolled the dough in it. They turned out great!!!"
"0","5","I soaked the raisins in brandy, reduced the white sugar and added a bit of coconut. They were still a bit too sweet for me but the people I shared them with found them to be deadly-delicious and devoured every one. Nice and soft. Best results at about 12 minutes, maybe because of the moist raisins."
"0","5","Added craisins and pecans. Absolutely awesome! My husbands favorite."
"0","5","made them with chocolate chips and walnuts. Left out the cinnamon,l substituted Splenda for white sugar and prune puree for half the butter. Also used 1/2 whole wheat flour."
"0","5","This is now my official oatmeal cookie recipe! SO delicious! The ONLY change I made was that I skipped the refrigeration and just dropped them on the cookie sheet with a spoon, no rolling or pressing. Baked for 10 min, and they are so soft and chewy! Next time I will try with choclate chips! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","Superb cookies! They are so soft and yummy! I skipped the 'refrigeration' and 'rolling' step and just dropped the dough by the spoonful onto the cookie sheet."
"0","5","Great recipe! I added 1 cup of raisins and 1 cup of chocolate chips and they turned out great. Next time will try almonds and dried cranberries."
"0","5","Great recipe very Delicious and soft cookies the only thing i did was subtracting 1 cup oats so its 2 cups instead of 3 cups and it came out GREAT. Thanks BITTERSWEET1"
"0","5","Even better than Beth's. I didn't use cinnamon, and halved the recipe because I only had 1 egg. The recipe still yielded a startling 30 cookies, about 2 inches in diameter each. I put them in balls on a disposable aluminum cookie sheet and they shaped into nice thick cookies in the oven, just how i wanted them. I turned them after 8 minutes and they still took about 4 minutes to brown nicely. They are my new staple oatmeal raisin recipe."
"0","5","Fantastic! The only thing I would do is cut back the oats a bit next time. After chilling, the dough was a bit hard to keep together in a ball. I added butterscotch chips for some extra flavor and and texture. My family can't stop eating them! I will absolutely make these again."
"0","5","This recipe is magical--I'm nor sure why it tastes so much better than the suggested recipes on the back of oatmeal containers (being that it is such a similar recipe) but somehow I managed to make the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted by following this recipe! These were delicious~ :)"
"0","4","Very yummy! One thing - I used Irish quick cook oats, and I only chilled the dough for 20 minutes. The first batch didn't turn out very well because the cookies were too gritty; however, the second and third batch were perfect because they were sitting in the fridge while they first cooked. So if you're going to use Irish or Scottish oats, make sure you let the dough rest in the fridge for at least an hour like the recipe suggests."
"0","5","These were so great! My problem was I tasted the dough and couldn't stop eating it even befoe I cooked it. They were little bites of heaven."
"0","5","YUMMY!!! Kids loved them so did my Pop and my hubby!! This one stays in the recipe box!! :)"
"0","5","I freeze about a dozen of these every time I make them; just as great thawed in the future. Great flavor, great texture, great overall!"
"0","5","Awesome! Bake for exactly 8 minutes."
"0","5","This was my first time baking cookies and I have to say, they came out FANTASTIC! The recipe was so easy to follow. I followed it exactly but added 1 cup of raisins to half the batch and 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to second half. Delicious! And as others have posted, I got way more than 24 cookies! Over 60!! I'm definitely making these again. Oh I pre-soaked the raisins, made such a difference! I made the cookies last night and this morning they are still soooo soft. Love this recipe!!!"
"0","5","THE best and simplest oatmeal cookie recipe out there. I never cool the dough and get fantastic results every single time I make these cookies. You can't go wrong - soft on the inside and crispy on the outside."
"0","5","Awesome cookies. The only change I made was that I didn't have one hour to cool the cookie dough so I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes. Worked great. This is definitely a keeper."
"0","5","I love these oatmeal cookies. I have tried several recipes and these are the best. The only changes I made was using whole wheat flour and adding chocolate chips. They were so chewy and moist."
"0","5","Delicious cookies and not difficult to make. Like other reviewers, I didn't flatten mine because I really wanted a soft cookie. I added about a cup of raisins and they turned out perfectly. Thanks!"
"0","5","They are awesome. I added some chocolate chips and they were gone in a few days."
"0","3","They taste fine. I added raisins to one batch and chocolate chips to another, but one their own I'm sure they'd be fine too. My biggest complaint is how they cook. My first batch, I kept them in for 10 minutes, took them out, let them rest for five more. When I came to transfer them, they fell apart into mushy globs, as if they hadn't been cooked all the way. So I put them in for a few more minutes. Then they got so crunchy and hard! I just couldn't win with these. Maybe I was just having bad luck, everyone else seems to have such good things to say! And yes, they flatten like mad on their own, you don't need to flatten them yourself unless you want them to be really crunchy and chip-like."
"0","4","I added the raisins. It was good and soft."
"0","3","I've had better...I'll be as 'middle of the road' as I can - it could be that I used 'store brand' Oats, or that I used older Baking Soda; but my cookies were bone dry - I could not even make them into balls to place on the cookie sheet. Nevertheless - they were eaten - noting went to waste. I'm hopeful it was 'just me' and not the recipe - I'll find out next time. Either way - oatmeal cookies, even ones that are dry; are still a tasty snack."
"0","5","Very easy. I added raisins to half of the batch. Everyone loved them and they stayed soft for several days. I would cut down on the cinnamon a little."
"0","5","Delicious! I made half the dough with raisins and half with milk chocolate chips, both came out great! A new family fave."
"0","5","These cookies were amazing! When I put the oats on I didn't wanna overbeat the oats so I mixed it with my hands... It was messy but it worked. My family definitely likes this recipe too. After his 6th cookie, my brother told me next time I make cookies they have to be gross so he doesn't feel bad when he eats a dozen a day."
"0","5","Ok...After reading a few pages (lol) I am off to make these cookies. I have looked at alot of Oatmeal Cookie recipe's and well taadaaa I'm off to do this recipe and will be back to post when they are complete-I'm looking forward to them :) ....Back.... I really like them they are not super soft which is really good as I was looking for an Oatmeal cookie not 'cake' But again I wasen't in the mood for a crispy cookie either so I must say good job I really like this recipie. I did put the batter in the fridge for 1.5 hours and I can understand why this is a 'key' well now I am just babling but thank you this recipe is definitly going in our 'family book' Now I am back these cookies are fantastic dipped in tea. Happy Cooking all"
"0","5","I made these exactly as the recipe is written. They are slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They have a delcious flavor! This is the recipe I will be using from now on for Oatmeal Cookies!!"
"0","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies. My son couldn't wiat for them to cook he kept sneaking a spoon into the dough!Followed the recipe exactly except the flattening with a fork. Awesome will make again and again!"
"0","5","The BEST cookies I have ever made and get compliments from everyone who eats them!!"
"0","5","My husband's favorite cookies. Delicious."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, these were fantastic! Instead of using the quick cooking plain oatmeal, I used the pre-packaged low-sugar maple brown sugar oatmeal (because alone it was not tasty) and they came out so good! I saw no need to use the fork, and they came out very chewy and delicious!"
"0","4","These turned out pretty good, considering the circumstances. My mixer broke and I was forced to mix it all by hand which was pretty painful... I'm not all that fond of oatmeal cookies, but these were really yummy. Mine got big and puffy, though... for some weird reason. But that may just be my horrible cooking skills. Also they turned kind of a weird color... but hey they were yummy! :)"
"0","5","Delicious cookies. They are soft, just dont over bake them. Added chocolate chips to half the batch. Yummy, will make again/"
"0","5","I must say, I very rarely add reviews but this was definetely worthy of one. I made this as is for myself and my boyfriend and we loved it!! 12 minutes was perfect and we did not need to press down with a fork. The consistency was perfect and flavor was perfect. Great job!!"
"0","5","These cookies were wonderful. I added dried cranberries instead of raisins and omitted the fork as I like me cookies big not flat...but I did do the sugar, just dip the top of the dough ball in a bit of sugar and they were perfect!"
"0","4","Good recipe! I added a cup of raisins as well. The were nice and chewy. Will make again, but this time I will add a little more cinnamon."
"0","5","Wonderful!! Added a cup of raisins to one batch and a cup of chocolate chips to another. Everyone was asking for the recipe."
"0","5","I added about 2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips and a cup of shredded coconut to the recipe and they were amazing. One of my friends even commented that they were blondies good. As in the cookie store. Seriously amazing!"
"0","4","Cookies were soft but not as flavorful as I would have liked and were a little flat. Next time I'll add a little more spice to them. Good recipe."
"0","5","Awesome cookies! I can't stop eating them! (I'm not sure that's a good thing:)"
"0","5","These were THE BEST cookies I've EVER made! They had just the right amount of sweet, they were chewy and soft but held together.. they were amazing. Everyone loved them and kept asking for more!"
"0","5","Mmmph! These are delicious. The best thing about this cookie is that it's not runny and keeps its shape. I added five spice, nuts, and raisins to mine. I used old fashion oats but I pulsed the oats in the Magic Bullet first."
"0","5","These were the best oatmeal cookies. they were soft and chewy. no need for the sugar on top, they are sweet enough on their own. I added mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. Yummy. Will make again."
"0","5","Great recipe but I put a little spin on it. To keep the cookies more moist and soft i added a small can of crushed pineapple mmmmmm sooo goood :)"
"0","5","Just perfection. Man, Allrecipes.com is making me popular with neighbors and friends. And it's turning me into a gourmet chef because of 5-star recipes! I just added chocolate chips. Wonderful."
"0","5","Awesome cookies! Even my husband who doesn't usually like oatmeal cookies loved them!"
"0","5","These are my husbands favorite and super easy to make. I added raisins and chilled the dough like previous reviews suggested. They are absolutely the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had!!"
"0","5","These are great! I ran out of time so I refrigerated half of the dough. They were very crumbly and hard to bake the next day, but the rest of the cookies were fabulous."
"0","5","havent had any better then these"
"0","4","I made these this morning for my daughters field day at school. The flavor is great. I thought they were a bit on the dry side, but overall a good cookie. I may add a little applesause next time I make them to bump up the moisture. I will also try to reduce the amount of sugar."
"0","5","The best oatmeal cookies I have ever made! They also make great ice cream sandwiches when you put some vanilla ice cream between two of the cookies."
"0","5","I would like to 'second' the above comments. I changed this up and did 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t cloves. I didn't grease the pan and I didn't squish them with the fork dipped in sugar. Baked just 8 mins. My hubby said they're the 'best cookies I've made!' Thanks for the great recipe and the great tips!"
"0","5","amazing - i dint cool the dough though and it seemed to work ok"
"0","5","These are great! My entire family of six loves them. I added chocolate chips and I did not flatten them with a fork. Great recipe, thanks!"
"0","5","Wonderful!!!! I didn't have 2 cups of flour only 1 so I substituted it with 1 cup butter pecan cake mix and it worked! I rolled them into balls, I did not flatten with a fork and sugar."
"0","5","I just made these and they came out fantastic!"
"0","5","Awesome oatmeal cookies!!! The only changes I made were to use 1 cup all-purpose & 1 cup whole wheat flour, and I added about 1.5 cups of chopped apple...soooooooo good!!"
"0","4","I made these for my husband since he loves cookies. After tasting the first batch, he requested raisins to be added. Those he devoured and wants them to keep coming. I quit putting sugar on top and flattening them because he loves them chewy."
"0","5","I'm so happy I found this recipe 'again' I made these then tried to make them 2 more times and realized I was using the wrong recipe-one on here for choc chip oatmeal- but there is no comparison-these are my fav-luscious! I didn't chill dough either, or flatten with fork & sugar, and I used parchment instead of any greasing and they came out wonderful!!! I like them better than my mom's! I added raisins & choc chips/walnuts. YUM."
"0","5","These cookies were delicious!!! Everyone in my class loved them!!! I accidentally doubled the cinnamon, but it still was delicious! I also just used 1 and 1/4 cup of oats and that was enough. They actually did turn out soft. They were done in just about 8-9 min. They didn't spread out much though. It's better to flatten them a little if you want a bigger cookie. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","3","i tried this tonight to see how it would go and test out on my co-workers. I have been dieting for the last few months with a lot of success, so I made some alterations much like others. I used Whoel wheat flour and splenda and it turned out alright. Next time I will follow others' advice and use less oats. They ended up not as sweet and very dense. I will make them again though, just need to tweek it some more."
"0","5","Really great cookies"
"0","4","Really soft and yummy! I cut the recipe in half came and baked for 7-8 minutes. They came out very soft and stayed soft and chewy after cooling."
"0","4","Very soft & flavorful cookie! I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of nutmeg since my husband LOVES cinnamon and I baked them for only 7 minutes. They came out perfectly soft and stayed soft & chewy long after they cooled. My son also wanted to dust the cookie balls with a cinnamon & sugar mixture after he added blue food coloring to them for fun and they still tasted awesome...SWEET, but awesome nonetheless!!"
"0","5","Absolutely moist and delicious! I'll add raisins or choc chips next time for some variation and may decrease some of the sugar as they seemed too sugary. I did NOT chill the dough or flatten with a sugared fork. Just mix, drop and bake! I yielded 27 pretty large cookies; so it would be easy to get 36 from one batch - didn't help we were eating the dough too."
"0","5","Excellent! I actually made these as a bar cookie instead of drop and they were delicious! I pushed the dough out into a jelly roll pan and baked for 28 minutes. I also added some almonds just cuz we like them. I cut them when I took them out of the oven."
"0","5","Yumooooooo!!!!!! The only thing I would do is not make them into balls,I think making them flat would be better. I also added some nuts to them,which gave them a nice crunch."
"0","5","Wowzers those were good! I skipped the setting in the fridge and they worked out fine. A little flat, but my family really liked them. There was a ton of dough and made lots of cookies. I added chocolate chips and lots of raisens! They were super easy and quick!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! The only thing I did different is I added 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips."
"0","5","These were great. I used a small pampered chef cookie scooper and came out with about 88 cookies or so from the one batch. I did not used a sugared fork to flatten. No need. Added Chocolate chips in half (for me). Very good recipe."
"0","4","Added raisins but other than that followed the recipe. Pretty good although i think i prefer the chewy cookies better."
"0","5","classic and delicious!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Better than the recipe on the oatmeal box. My first batch, I left in the oven a bit longer than suggested since they did not look done. These still came out good, crispy on outside, a little bit chewy, although maybe slightly dry. The second batch I took out at 10 minutes, and they set up perfectly the way an oatmeal cookie should be. Don't be afraid to take them out on time even if they don't look done!"
"0","4","These cookies were delicious! The only critique I have is that the recipe yeilds waaaaaaay more than the 24 cookies it's supposed to. I worried that I wouldn't have enough, so I doubled it and ended up passing off cookies on all our neighbors. Not that they minded..."
"0","5","Very delicious cookies! First time I baked it and I will definitely bake some more. Thanks for sharing."
"0","4","I followed recipe exactly as it is written exactly that I added 1 C raisins. Cookies were very good and soft. I would have rated a 5 but I think the recipe on the Oatmeal box is tastier."
"0","5","Yummy! it was super easy to make but I think I made them too big so I had to keep them in the oven for another 5 mins"
"0","5","Okay...I have made plenty of 'oatmeal cookies' in my day. I was very pleasantly surprised how great these ones tasted. I added raisins, that I had presoaked and some crushed peacans. Very good!"
"0","5","Wonderful cookies! Had to half the recipe due to empty pantry, but may run to the grocery store so I can make another batch!"
"0","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made! I hate it when people add a bunch of ingredients to a recipe and then rate their own version, but this time I did add 1 cup of raisins, and sprinkled in some nutmeg and cloves to my 2nd batch. They were delicious with the additional spices! I baked them for about 9 minutes, and they had a nice chewy center with a little bit of a crunch on the outside. They also held their shape well, since I put the dough in the fridge, and also had a cold cookie sheet to use. I sprinkled the cookies with powdered sugar and they looked fabulous!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, added some dried cranberries and walnuts and baked mine for 10 - 11 minutes. I didn't chill the dough because I didn't have time and I just rolled them into balls; didn't flatten them. Turned out great! The smell when they are baking is heavenly! Next time I make them I will try adding chocolate chips. Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
"0","5","By far the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever tried! I have also made oatmeal raisin cookies by substituting 1 cup raisins for 1 cup oats."
"0","5","I'm not a huge fan of Oatmeal cookies, but really enjoyed these. Since I have a sweet tooth I try to make things that I don't really like to eat so I thought I would make these. Well long story short I couldn't stop eating them. If you leave them in the oven for just a few minutes more you get the best of both worlds, chewy or crunchy!"
"0","5","Delicious cookies! Very chewy!"
"0","5","This is really chewy. I tried 3 kinds of oatmeal cookies from this site. And I have found this recipe makes the best chewy oatmeal cookies. I think the secret of this recipe is the tempreture of oven and the amount of sugar. When you bake at 350F, the cookies' outside(not only the edge but over all)don't become crispy this much. And when you reduce the amount of sugar, the cookies become just soft, not chewy. I also tried to reduce sugar and flour and add extra oat to see how they turn out. The result is, the dough became more sticky but shaped almost the same when baked(thought they would spread), but the texture and the taste became just soft and flourly(oaty), not chewy. I recommend not changing the amount of sugar, flour or oat and baking tempreture. I think this recipe should have named Chewy Oatmeal cookies."
"0","5","excellent!"
"0","5","I love the cinnamon smell while they are cooking and cooling!!!"
"0","5","these were great! my 3 year old daughter helped me out and loved that we could separate the batter and add our different favorites (raisins/chocolate chips) at the end. i definitely recommend adding something. the raisins add just the perfect amount of sweetness. i did not use the sugar on the fork. my husband likes chocolate chips and i thought they made the cookie too sweet, so it's definitely a personal preference. naturally, my daughter likes anything with the word 'cookie' in it but it has to be a good cookie or she will leave it half eaten. she ate these and then some!!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I made these for my new father-in-law's birthday. Oatmeal Raisin are his absolute favorite.. They were such a hit.. He hid them from the rest of the people at the party!! He has requested that I bring them for Easter lunch.. So, I'm going to try half with chocolate chips and half with raisins! SUCH a great recipe! And really simple!"
"0","5","these were a huge hit! I only had 2.5 cups of oats, so i compensated by splitting the dough in half and adding a ton of chocolate chunks to one portion and lots of coconut, white chocolate, and currants to the other. every cookie was finished by the end of the night."
"0","5","Since it's rather hard to find brown sugar in Indonesia, I just use palm sugar - same brown but kinda different in taste (it has a bit salty taste). The result is just perfect for soft oatmeal cookie. But if you let it baked for longer time, palm sugar makes the cookie harder at the first bite instead of crunchy. So I just baked according to the instruction, and it turned out just perfect!!!"
"0","4","This was VERY easy!! I added fresh ground nutmeg, which added a great spice taste not too overpowering. I baked @ 375 on parchment for about 10 minutes, the result: a nice golden brown bottom and lightly crisp top perfect with a glass of milk! Enjoy!"
"0","5","These were so good! Soft and moist and chewy. Absolutely nothing wrong with them. I kept them in the oven for 8 minutes and they were perfect. I did not chill the batter, flatten with a fork, or grease the cookie sheet. Also, I seperated the batter into three parts. The first I left as is. The second I added chocolate chips. And the third, I added flaked coconut. All variations were delicious. I will be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","They were good, but I didn't think they were any different than the oatmeal recipe I use off the quaker oat box, possibly a little softer though"
"0","5","I'm not a fan of oatmeal cookies but my family is and they all say these deserve 5 stars"
"0","5","Delicious recipe! I didn't flatten them with a fork and they turned out great. Thanks for sharing."
"0","2","These were good upon initial eating after they came out of the oven... after that they were not moist or soft at all, even kept in a container with a slice of bread for moisture they were hard as a rock right away. Will not be making this recipe again."
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe that we modified by leaving-out the cinnamon and adding about 1/3 cup of crunchy peanut butter. In another batch, we further added chocolate chips - wow!"
"0","5","Great recipe! Everyone at work loved these."
"0","5","These are soft and delicious! I didn't refrigerate before cooking and just dropped the dough on to cookie sheet by the tablespoon. Cooked for 9 min and they came out perfect!!!! Thank you!"
"0","5","I just made these as in they are still cooling on the rack and these are the best!!! They are easy to make and oh so yummy! The only thing I did different was I used margarine instead of butter and added a cup and a half of raisins."
"0","5","i have to admit, these are THE BEST cookies i have ever made, and continue to make. The trick is to add some coconut (if you like it). i took some to work, and gave everybody in the dept. one (only 1). and the next day they were beating down my door for them. so i sold them for a .25 apiece! ha ha!!! this is def. a keeper! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR SHARING!"
"0","5","This is now my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! Cookies turn out soft and somewhat chewy. I used chocolate chips, but raisins would be great also. I used a small scoop to form the cookies into a ball and then flattened them with a glass which made them nicely rounded. I will definitely make these again!"
"0","4","Easy to make and taste good. not the best I've ever had but ease of making makes up for that. I'll make them again."
"0","5","Simple and turned out great on first try, I added Rasins and Choc Chips. A hit around here"
"0","5","This was a fabulous recipe for Oatmeal cookies, they were soft (baked for 8 minutes ONLY) and flavourful. I added no raisins or nuts, but a little cinnamon and cardamom. I also only used 2/3 cup of white sugar. I didn't find they needed to be chilled at all, even left to sit on the counter for 10 minutes left them easier to handle. Great cookies! thanks!"
"0","5","Addictive! Followed the directions exactly. Did half a batch of raisin and the other half milk chocolate chip. I ate all the raisin ones myself!!"
"0","5","These are my new favorite cookie soft and tasty I recomend these highly"
"0","5","Delicious cookie. I did not flatten with sugar, these are sweet enough. In a second batter, I added some raisins and walnuts. Great cookie!"
"0","3","Will try again...just in case of user error but these cookies seemed dry and lacked rich flavor."
"0","5","By far the best oatmeal cookie I ever had. I added mini m&m's to the batter. Everyone that tried it raved about them."
"0","5","These cookies are fantastic ! Followed the recipe exactly (added raisins) and they were perfect ! Will definitely makes these again and again. . ."
"0","5","OMG!I love this cookie recipe.I made the dough last night and just had to back a few this morning to try it out.I did add a dash of nutmeg and a little more vanilla because I ran out of the real stuff so I added a tablespoon of the imitation stuff.other then the fact that my pan id a very dark one i cooked them at 350 for 8 minuets.they came out moist and fluffy and chewy.the perfect cookie.Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","the most amazing cookies ever!!!! i made them for my family and they were gone in three days!"
"0","5","Wonderful! My husband raved about them. I added chocolate chips to mine, but kept everything else exactly as written. Yum!"
"0","5","Very very good! I made them w/ raisins and some with chocolate chips. Yum!"
"0","5","in the last 2 weeks, i have made several dozens of these cookies.... AMAZING! everytime, i follow the recipe exactly, and usually throw in a handful of chocolate chips. if they come out too dry/ hard, reduce the baking time. my husband likes them on the chrispy side, my daughter on the soft side, i've made both. really great cookies!"
"0","4","I added toffee chips to the batter and my kids just loved them. I felt they were to oily and not as soft as I like. First batch turned out crispy, so on the rest I turned down the heat and only kept in the oven 7 minutes. They were soft, but almost seemed uncooked to get that way. This recipe did make a bunch of cookies, which is good for me with having 4 kids to feed. Probably won't make again unless I take omit some butter and add applesauce."
"0","5","Yea!we just made these cookies and 'mm mmm mmmmm!' they were 'El Deliciouso!' =D"
"0","5","These were the exact style of oatmeal cookie I was looking for. Soft, fragrant, sweet and salty. Reminded me of my youth and now they will also remind my boys of theirs. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added choc chips (my boys don't think cookies come without them). They were a big hit. Thanks for sharing."
"0","4","Recipe as is is a great start for delicious soft oatmeal cookies. We made one batch as the recipe calls for and another with rasins and chocolate chunks We prefered the cookie with the add ins. Cookies were soft like the recipe says, even 2 days later."
"0","5","mmm! I made these cookies on a whim, and now I wonder if it was just a dream....they were gone in 2 days! It's a keeper for sure!"
"0","4","These tasted really good. I made just like the recipe, but added dried cranberries and chocolate chips. I used butter flavored crisco, instead of butter. My only complaint was that the dough was really crumbly and hard to form into balls. The baked cookie stays together well though. The crumbliness might be my own fault for skipping the refrigeration time. Next time, I would put them in the fridge like the recipe and see if they are less crumbly. Thanks!"
"0","5","I have tried MANY oatmeal cookie recipes! This is by far THE BEST!! Soft, moist, and FULL of FLAVOR!! My family love these cookies with raisins, or chocolate chips, or spice drops mixed in!! Be sure to try these cookies, you WILL NOT be disappointed!!!"
"0","5","Refrigeration is really key for this recipe. I made it once with refrigerating the dough and once without and the first batch was better. Craisins and extra cinnamon went really well with this recipe."
"0","4","Followed this recipe to a tee, but added raisins. The cookies turned out too sweet for my taste, but the hubby seems to like them. I will try this recipe again, but reduce the sugar."
"0","5","Delicious! I added raisins to mine. Next time I will bake them a little less than 10 minutes because I found them a little too crisp. One of my friends even came over a few days later just to have more!"
"0","5","I loved these! I added a package of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were delicious. They stayed soft for quite a few days too, just store them in an airtight container."
"0","5","These cookies are super yummy and soft. I love it! I did cut down the sugar to half (both brown and white) because I like my cookies not too sweet so I can eat more :)"
"0","5","i just made these cookies for my boyfriend for vday bc they are his favorite cookies... they are now mine!!! these cookies are the best.. i didnt chill the dough before baking and they came out really moist and extremely delicious.. also i didnt dip my fork in sugar or flatten..simply rolled in a ball and ta-da!!!!"
"0","5","Delicious! Four days later they are still soft! Perfect recipe to use for chocolate chip cookies. I divided the dough in half and wrapped each in plastic wrap and refrigerated for l/2 hour, it was just the right consistency to work with."
"0","5","DELICIUOS!!! Great texture! Chewy, yet held it's shape. Hard to find a good cookie without shortening- this is IT! This cookie would be great just as is, but I added 1 cup softened raisins, 1/2 cup Chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. YUMMY!!! They are awesome!"
"0","4","Good, but I'd like to try some other recipes next time."
"0","5","I love the cinnamon in this recipe! We have done with plain, with raisins and with chocolate chips! They were all good! I also flattened out the little balls and put them on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper to freeze and baked later. It worked great! (I did not refrigerate the dough first)"
"0","5","This has been a favorite at our house for years. Try replacing the vanilla with a tablespoon of maple flavoring. It gives a wonderful twist to a wonderful recipe."
"0","5","Great recipe! The cookies are delicious and so is the cookie dough. I added white chocolate chips and cranberries to one batch, chocolate chips to another and raisins to another. They all turned out wonderfully! Definitely going to make these again..."
"0","5","All my kids and I have to say is 'Hmmmmm' These are so delicious!"
"0","5","excellent!"
"0","5","Oh.my.gosh. The BEST oatmeal cookie recipe EVER! I added raisins to mine...just love it!"
"0","5","These are a huge hit at our house. I add 1/2 cup coconut and about a teaspoon of nutmeg, and I can't keep them around!"
"0","5","YUM!!! I just finished baking these and we absolutly love them. I followed the recipe but gave up on the fork with the last batch and used my hand which is easier for my 7yr old. I did half with 1cup raisens and half with 1 cup chocolate chips. Next time I will put more of both in. A very easy recipe the only hard part is putting it in the fridge for an hour and yes not eating the dough. Thank you for a wonderful recipe."
"0","5","This is a great receipe that I will defintely use again and again. I added a touch more cinammon than the receipe called for and also chocolate chips. I only had old fashioned oats on hand and I used those. I put them in the food processor first so the oats would not be so big. They turned out great! Love, love, love this receipe."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic! Thanks."
"0","5","Great recipe. To decrease the fat, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour & 1/2 white flour and instead of 1 c butter, used 1/2 c apple sauce & 1/2 c low fat margarine. But then I also added 3/4 c. each choc chip & raisins. Also, instead of making cookies I spread the dough in 16x11 pan. Cooked for 25 minutes and it came out great!"
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe & they are quickly devoured in our house. I add raisins & dried cranberries...and even added pumpkin seeds once. I'm making them today for a Super Bowl party."
"0","5","I'm new to baking and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to make such delicious cookies! I don't have lot of fancy tools and for these I only had a fork, spoon, measuring cup, ikea mixing bowl and a small toaster oven. Anyone can make these! I like my oatmeal cookies chewy so I didn't flatten them after they were scoped onto the baking sheet. The result is a crispy shell with a chewy center, which is exactly what I wanted. I halved the ingredients and also changed the sugar/brown sugar to 3/4 cups of white and added one table spoon of honey (since I don't have brown sugar). I also added some dried cranberries. I've always wanted to make my own oatmeal cookies and not have to spend a bundle on gourmet store bought ones...thanks so much for this awesome recipe!"
"0","5","Taste was delicious but not moist. but me and my family enjoyed it. thanks for posting."
"0","5","Very good! I ended up putting these in the oven at 350 degrees for 10-11 minutes, to keep the bottoms from getting too crispy. They turned out perfect. So delicious, soft and chewy. I also couldn't stop eating the batter. Oops!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly! BY far the best!"
"0","3","I need to try this recipe one more time. The texture was good (soft with crisp edges), but there was too much of a buttery taste. I'll have to add more raisins next time - maybe 2 cups."
"0","3","Ok - I've had better."
"0","5","i must have done something wrong. There was not much taste. Need to add more spices. They also were not chewy. My husband liked it as he is more of a lover of bland food in terms of dessert. Think I will stick with my mom's recipe made again and changed my rating from a 3 to a 5. My family keeps asking for the oatmeal cookies including my inlaws. I make some plain, some with raisons and some with chocolate chips."
"0","5","These are very good cookies. I didn't have quiet a cup of raisins so I added some white chocolate chips with the raisins, and i also added about 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. My family loved them."
"0","5","All the goodness of oatmeal in a chewy, marvelous little cookie. Absolutely wonderful!"
"0","5","This was my FIRST time baking oatmeal cookies and it came out delicious! I substituted white sugar with Splenda (cant even taste the difference!) and I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose since I had it on hand. In addition, I added some Craisins. It is true that the cookies do not flatten much in the oven, so flatten it beforehand to approximately however thick you want the cookies to be. I made it a little thicker because I prefer chewy and soft oatmeal cookies rather than crispy. It did take the full 10 minutes to bake. These were so good and easy to make, I'll never buy oatmeal cookies again!"
"0","5","Finally An oatmeal cookie recipe for Life. I have been looking forever for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and this is it."
"0","5","I've made these twice since finding the recipe last week. My previouse attemps at oatmeal cookies resulted in flat and greasy or dry and flavorless lumps. These were perfect! I added diced dates the second time and they were great. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","Excellent taste! The only change I made was to substitute the butter with 'I Can't Believe it's Not Butter.' You can add in extras such as chocolate chips or raisins, but these really are wonderful as is. I also thought the amount of cinnamon was just right. Thanks!"
"0","5","Extremely yummy cinnamon-tasting oatmeal cookies. My boys love them!"
"0","5","I really enjoy this recipe. I love the taste that the cinnamon brings. I added a half a bag of chocolate chips and I think that added a lot."
"0","5","These were OUTSTANDING, and got rave reviews at the Christmas party. I think the one-hour layover in the fridge is what really does the trick. It gives the oats a chance to suck up some moisture and soften."
"0","5","I made these with steel cut oats the first time and while I second guessed my decisions they were PERFECT! The second time around I used quick oats. I liked the steel cut the best."
"0","5","Yum Yum!! These were perfectly moist and soft, yet held their shape well! Be sure to flatten them with fork (or hands). I added cut-up spice drop candies plus 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for a festive christmas touch and they flew off the plate at a gathering before I could get back for seconds! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","these are delicious. i didn't put them in the fridge. using a spoon as a scoop i rolled little balls by hand. they are the perfect size for little fingers and super tasty!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great. I kept a close eye on them so as to not overcook...they were chewy and yummy--- froze and cooked well to."
"0","5","I made the recipe exactly and added chopped walnuts and cranberries. It was wonderful!"
"0","5","YUM! These are fantastic cookies! I made these cookies for my husband (as I'm not a sweet fan), but these cookies were SSSOOO good - I'm now a huge fan, and have eaten several of them! Perfect in every way. The only thing I did was add a little nutmeg and chopped pecans. NUM - and they cooked perfectly. Definitely a 5* keeper in our house!"
"0","5","Fantastic! I added a cup of raisins and a dash of nutmeg. That's it. My kids are eating them fresh off the cookie sheet. My super-finicky son is gobbling them up! (The only other thing I did differently was I lightly ground up my oats in an electric chopper before adding to the flour mixture. I don't like big oats in my cookies.) Great recipe!"
"0","5","I didn't change anything with this recipe, except that I didn't use a fork to mash the cookie dough balls down, and I cooked them for 12 minutes. The cookies turned out sooo wonderful!!!"
"0","5","Great recipe! The whole family loved them. I used dried cherries instead of raisins. Also, I did not chill the dough or flatten the cookies and they turned out perfect. This will be a regular cookie at our house."
"0","5","SOO good! I substituted the 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar with 3/4 c sugar and 1 1/4 c of sugar. I also didn't flatten them. They're so good and very moist!"
"0","5","Just try them!"
"0","5","These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. The ingredients were simple, the directions were straight forward, and it yielded large cookies that had slightly crispy with a soft center. This recipe is without a doubt a keeper."
"0","4","These cookies were pretty good. I made a few changes. I used 1 C. butter flavored Crisco + 6 tsp. water. I also used whole wheat pastry flour (lighter texture than regular whole wheat flour) in place of the all-purpose flour. I decreased the white sugar and brown sugar to 3/4 C. each. The cookies were still plenty sweet."
"0","5","AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME! THE BEST OATMEAL COOKIES I HAVE EVER MADE OR HAD!"
"0","5","Simply put: amazing."
"0","5","These cookies are by far the best cookies. Just instead of one tsp of vanilla add two. It makes it taste wwwaaayyy better!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome! Mine came out soft and moist. I added some chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups) and then added less oatmeal 1 1/2 cup and it was the perfect amount. I also used the suggestions above, less salt, haft the amount and slightly less sugar which made them perfect. They didn't even last day at our house:) Don't pass this recipe by!"
"0","5","'The Best' is right! They really do stay soft! I didn't refrigerate the dough but i did flatten them slightly with my palm before baking. They puffed slightly and didn't spread too much. This one of the few recipes i've tried so far where i've been totally satisfied with the results!!!"
"0","5","Love this recipe! The cookies are soft and delicious."
"0","4","These were great, nice and soft and a great flavor. I wouldn't change a thing with them."
"0","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have made to date and I have made alot. Perfect texture, flavor and stay soft. I did add raisins and used 1/2 Whole Wheat Flour and 1/2 White. No other changes. Easy to make and freezes well."
"0","5","My husband is a fanatic for anything 'Oatmeal Raisin' flavored...especially cookies!!! I've been making the recipe on the Quaker Oatmeal box for years, but I'm living in Australia and can't buy Quaker here so I decided to look for another recipe online...oh my goodness, WE ARE SO HAPPY I did!! This is now our new favorite cookie recipe and I'll never search for a new one again!"
"0","5","These were simply delicious"
"0","5","These are awesome. They are the only oatmeal cookie I make now. I also skip the refridgeration and make them as drop cookies. So soft and soooo delicious!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is AWESOME!  As I write this, I've got a batch in the oven... mmmmm yummy cookies!"
"0","4","This recipe was fantastic! Even the dough was tasty and edible! But overall, a highly recommended recipe."
"0","5","I've baked and eaten a ton of cookies in my life time and I can honestly say that this is THE BEST cookie that I've ever tasted!!! Two thumbs up from MzB."
"0","5","I love oatmeal cookies and this recipe is perfect. The cookies come so soft, great for Christmas or anytime."
"0","5","Super Yummy!!! I added a bag of chocolate chips(instead of raisins), everyone loved them moist and chewy, just like we like them!!"
"0","4","Very good! I added some nutmeg and also a little extra flour after the first two sheets, as they 'melted' some before they cooked fully. I also threw in about a cup and a half of craisins, which was really tasty. I'll definitely make these again with my alterations!"
"0","5","Mmmm, these are perfect! Didn't change a thing! :)"
"0","5","Wonderful cookies!!! They are kind of sweet...which I love, but if you don't you might want to cut out some of the sugar. I give them 5 stars for sure!!!"
"0","5","Great cookies. Kids at my school loved them!"
"0","5","These cookies turnes out really well. My husband and kids loved them. I added some chocolate chips and raisins to them and was happy with the result. I have been looking for a chewy oatmeal cookie recipe for a while this one fits the bill perfectly. Thanks for the awesome recipe."
"0","2","I've tasted better oatmeal cookies then this one. They were to sweet and not very soft at all. Simple to make, just not that great."
"0","4","Made it per recipe. They were typical oatmeal cookies. Need more than 2 inches between each other, though."
"0","5","Great recipe!!! My kids did not want to try them because they were oatmeal. But I saw them sneaking them off of the cooling rack. They came out perfect."
"0","5","AB SO LU LEY the best hands down cookies ever. a BIG hit at my digs... I did find that you can make this and freeze, but you have to defrost for a while."
"0","4","MMmMmMmMmmmm they are so tasty! I hate crunchy cookies and I manage to get a soft, chewy oatmeal cookie out of this recipe every time! I always add white chocolate chips - but this makes it very sweet so try it only if you really enjoy sugar! =)"
"0","5","Im not to exited about oatmeal cookies but these had me sold. I made them twice. First, with quick oatmeal and found that the cookies melt in mouth and second time I used the regular oatmeal and found that these were equally delicious but had a thicker consistency. Thanks for this recipe. next time I think that I am going to soak the raisins in rum! yum!!!"
"0","5","Excellent- the structure of the cookie was soft and moist- really ideal. I added a few handfulls of raisins, 1 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also like big cookies, so I used 1/4 cup as my scoop and baked 15 minutes."
"0","5","This cookie recipe was delicious.I loved them and my family loved them as well. I will be making this recipe again."
"0","5","I grew up with crunchy oatmeal cookies. Chewy cookie person that I am, I've been looking for these cookies my whole life. I knew it was love at first site when I ate 4 of them right off the cookie sheet. They are incredible. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this perfect recipe!"
"0","5","Everyone loved these cookies...soft and delicious! Will make these again! Thanks :D"
"0","5","Absolutely perfect!"
"0","5","awesome... cook 8 minutes flat and cool. wonderful recipe. thanks for sharing."
"0","4","a really nice, chewy cookie. i only had regular rolled oats, so only added 2 cups for fear they wouldn't be done enough if i added the whole 3 cups. i think it'd be safe to add the whole 3 cups next time. will definitely make these again."
"0","5","Delicious! I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & added 1 cup of white chocolate chips, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. They were moist & went over quite well with my hubby (who normally is unenthusiastic about oatmeal cookies). Yum!"
"0","5","MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm! Yum! Wonderful!  Also if you leave out the flour and bake on a baking sheet for the same time, you'll get PHENOMENAL granola to sprinkle on your ice cream, yogurt, or cereal....this was a super mistake that we made....2 recipes for one!"
"0","5","OMG---These cookies are the best! I also went straight to baking, skipped the frig. part and used a 1oz. scooper. They came out great! This is a KEEPER."
"0","5","Very yummu recipe! I added dried blueberries and now these are so delicious! I can't stop eating them."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, me, oh my...These cookies are absolutely delicious! They're also extremely easy to make. My daughter and I had a wonderful time making them together. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","Perfection. The ideal oatmeal raisin cookie. Sent to my college kids for care packages - they loved them!!"
"0","5","Really, really good especially when warm. This made a ton of cookies, had to give some away to neighbors. Husband who doesn't really like oatmeal cookies, thought that these were great too. I didn't press the cookies down and added raisins."
"0","5","These are easy and right on. I like them about 9 to 10 min in my oven. I did not change a thing in this recipe. I did use my medium scoop from pampered chef and I have about 36 huge cookies. O I did add 2tbs of flax meal, just because I try to do that to most baked items. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","The perfect oatmeal cookie. Soft, chewy and sooooo flavorful."
"0","5","These were delicious. I added 1 cup choc. chips to mine. You don't need to refrigerate, roll into balls or flatten. I just used my Pampered Chef Med. Cookie Scoop and they were perfect. My 15 month old kept begging for them. I had to hide them. Hubby and daughter loved them too."
"0","5","I just made these cookies for my family and they are phenomenal! The best thing is I got 48 cookies (not tiny small ones, either!) from the recipe. I am baking on a very frugal budget and that was a great bonus. I made 36 cookies according to recipe and the remaining 12 I added cranberries and walnuts. Scrumptious!"
"0","5","Very tasty cookies! I followed measures exactly adding brandy-soaked raisans and choc chips and they were gorgeous! I left the dough in the fridge over-night (because I intended to cook them the next day) and didn't flatten them with a sugar-coated folk. They were sweet enough for me, just right. I made 26 good-sized cookies from a 24 serving recipe. Highly recommended!"
"0","5","keeper!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies for the kids first day of school. They are fantastic! Definately a keeper that I will surely make over and over again. I was not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies--but I am now!"
"0","5","I always have trouble with cookies turning out flat, and these really were soft and fluffy. I had to use a bit of water to get the sugar to stick to the fork. Delicious!"
"0","5","Fantastic Oatmeal cookie recipe. They stay moist for days and you can add whatever you'd like to the recipe (i.e. chocolate chips, walnuts, pecans, etc)."
"0","5","I gave these cookies a second try and they turned out wonderful. I cut the cinnamon to about 1/4 teas and only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt. They turned out yummy. Easy to make. I'll def be making them again."
"0","5","Excellent Cookies! Super easy/simple to make. The first batch of cookies I've ever made with my two year old. We didn't change a thing as far as ingredients and amount (except for when he became a little overzealous with the cinnamon). We didn't refrigerate, grease the pan, or flatten with a fork. They were still wonderful. Thank you so much for the recipe."
"0","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever found. They are so soft and tasty. Thanks!"
"0","5","These cookies were very easy to make. Really all you need is one bowl. They are very moist. I put regular raisins and golden raisins for those who like more than normal because then your cookie doesnt look like only raisins but you get the extra. It also made about 40 cookies rather than 24. You should try them."
"0","5","My favorite Oatmeal Cookie recipe!"
"0","5","These were great! The only thing I changed was instead of 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of cloves. Yummy. I did half of batch with raisins and the other half with chocolate chips. They were both amazing."
"0","5","yum! Even though I didn't think these cookies are very soft, I took them out at 8 mins, they are still delicious. The taste totally makes up for the crunchy-ness. I did not press mine and i wouldn't recommend doing so. I made chocolate chip and raisin chocolate chip. The raisin chocolate chip tastes like chocolate covered raisins!!! definitely try this recipe."
"0","5","These cookies are so amazing! Mine turned out kind of spherical because I didn't smush them down. I added cranberries and chopped pecans, and they're really great! I'll definitely be making these again, with different additions. I'm thinking about chopped coconut next time..."
"0","5","Great cookies, easy recipe. I did put the oats in a food processor to have a finer texture in the cookie."
"0","4","These were very good cookies. I took others' recommendations and reduced the sugar. I added a cup of white chocolate chips and they turned out wonderful."
"0","5","These were great. I doubled the recipe and made a ton of big, chewy cookies. I added golden raisins, beside that I stuck with the recipe. My kids, husband all loved them. (And they don't typically like oatmeal cookies.)I found you need to cook longer than 8 minutes, but my cookies were pretty big."
"0","1","too much oatmeal and not enough cookie. i have had much better. if you want a cookie that tastes like a granola bar this is perfect, but at the same time you should probably just look up granola bar recipes."
"0","5","The best oatmeal cookies ever! I cooked them on the top rack for about 10 minutes then let them sit for 5 on the baking sheet. AWESOME!"
"0","5","Excellent! These were a big hit and remained soft for several days. The second time I made them I made the following changes: -decreased butter to 1/2 cup -added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the add'l butter -used 1 cup of white flour, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour -added: 1/2 cup raisins, 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup flax, and 1/2 cup walnuts -I placed them 1 inch apart as they don't spread much and I didn't flatten them with a fork. They come out like cupcake tops. -I reserved some of the cinnamon to sprinkle on top before baking to give them a nicer appearance."
"0","4","Pretty good cookies, I added raisins for sure. They are soft and chewy just how I like them. The only thing I didn't do was I didn't put them in the fridge at all, I just made the batter and spooned the batter onto cookie sheets and baked."
"0","4","these were good! kinda bland"
"0","5","Really easy recipe and nice cinnamon flavor without being too overpowering. One note, though - this makes a TON of cookies. I will halve it in the future!"
"0","5","Holy Cow!! These are the most awesome oatmeal cookies I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Only change I made was I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon as that's all I had. This is my permanent oatmeal cookie from now on! Can't wait to try with raisins and chocolate chips!"
"0","5","oh wow those cookies were really good, i added about 120 grams of dried cranberries and a bit over 50 grams of white chocolate. life doesn't get much better than a glass of cold milk and a white chocolate cranberry oatmeal cookie!"
"0","5","Okay so I never write reviews but this was an AWESOME cookie for even someone who is not a chef. I was really wanting an oatmeal cookie that you would see out at the mall or Starbucks... So I made the cookie to recipe and spooned it by the heaping tablespoons onto my baking stone. I was a little skeptical because it was a wet consistency and I thought I bet this cookie won't rise ( I have had plenty of homemade cookies that looked like a flat pancake). However, in nine minutes I had the most beautiful looking and best tasting cookie out of the oven. My kids are eating them right now and they are a hit!! Will keep this recipe permanently."
"0","5","Wow, my family really, really, really loves this recipe. Sometimes we add chocochips or raisins."
"0","5","This is so good. I took an idea from another post and added craisins instead of raisins and WOW so good"
"0","5","My Sweetie is crazy about these cookies. I'm making him a batch today by request. These are the perfect oatmeal cookies. They stay fresh long and are very moist and chewy."
"0","5","I was skeptical at first but wow, these are amazing."
"0","5","Just what we were looking for! Thanks"
"0","5","I added about a cup of white chocolate chips, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies turned out wonderfully soft and chewy. The oatmeal adds great texture. The cookies may appear under-cooked, but after cooling, they firm up and remain chewy. Overall, this was a great recipe."
"0","5","Excellent! Followed the recipe to a T, adding the optional raisins. Might have been a bit bland without them, but with them they were great!"
"0","5","Very delicious and made the whole apt smell awesome. Followed the recipe exactly, only adding 1 cup raisins, and I know these won't last long. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","5","Great recipe and easy to make. However, for Asian baker, I would recommend you to reduce the sugar. I found that American recipe are usually too sweet for Asian taste. After I reduce both white and brown sugar by 1/4 cup, it is still too sweet for us. Nonetheless, I still give five star coz it is a great recipe and taste good (if less sweet) and we can't blame others with difference sugar taking level. I will definitely make it again with less sugar! Thank you."
"0","5","Oh yeah!!! Quite possibly the best cookie ever! I shorted the sugar just a bit and added some raisins and chocolate chips, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The one thing I will do differently next time is to use unsalted butter. Or if I do use salted butter, I'll omit adding the extra salt because I can taste a tad more salt than I would like to be tasting...but I know it's my fault for using salted butter so I still give these cookies a 5 star because they are just awesome! They came out all fluffy and soft and chewy, I've never been able to get my cookies to turn out this way, so I'm totally excited about this recipe, it's definitely going in with my all time favorites! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","This recipes is the best oatmeal cookie i've ever made and ive been baking for 40 + years,for family and perfessionaly. They are moist, and tasty thank you vvery much for the cookie. I did'nt change the reciepe other then not chilling( was in hurry) i would recomend this recipe to all."
"0","5","wow! i added extra cinnamon, a dash nutmeg, and some apple pie spice, because i like oatmeal cookies with some zip. also added raisins and a few walnuts. these stole the show over the two other baked goods i made! awesome recipe and one i will definately make again!"
"0","5","This cookie recipe is awesome! I would put 6 stars if that were an option. I made them smaller than called for so it made one shy of four dozen. They were moist and so good. I added chocolate chips and Reese's Pieces. I highly recommend them."
"0","5","this recipe was wonderful followed recipe and added 1 1/2 cups of raisins also and it made it even better will make again and again"
"0","5","I brought these to a potluck at work and people loved them! I added raisins, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","I made these with my 6-yr-old daughter. We separated the dough into three parts and mixed one with raisins, one with dried cranberries and the biggest one with chocolate chips. They're delicious!"
"0","4","They are good. Nothing super special about them."
"0","5","This recipe was so easy to make and the cookies were delicious! I didn't add anything, and they were good without raisans or choc chips. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. I've been looking for a good cookie recipe that is both perfectly yummy and easy to remember so I don't have to yank out the recipe every time I wanted to bake cookies. I made walnut sized balls and the recipe yielded 30 palm sized cookies. I flattened 12 down, dipped them in sugar and froze them for later use and those turned out just as good as the first batches. Great recipe!"
"0","3","I'm giving these a 3 because they turned out more like crisps and def weren't soft at all,I don't know if I did something wrong but these were just okay, probally won't make again."
"0","5","Great consistency. Good flavor. A winner! Add dried cherries for fun."
"0","3","Made a huge batch of these, in 1/2 I added chocolate chips, and the other 1/2 white chocolate chips. Also added gr. cloves as another rater suggested. Did not like the flavour, think it was the cloves, and found them salty.  Only gave 3 stars due to odd taste, but then again, I am not the greatest baker."
"0","5","These are very good. I added walnuts and raisins to it. There is no need to refrigerate these if you have a cookie scooper. It makes it very easy."
"0","5","Yummy! I also played with the recipe, only added 1 tsp of cinnamom and 1/2 tsp cloves as one member suggested. I added raisins, did not chill the batter or flatten the balls of dough with a fork and they turned out great. I also never grease any pan, I always use parchement paper to bake on and would not bake without it! So the cookies were great, Thanks!"
"0","5","I made exactly to recipe, but added raisins... YUMMY! Perfect oatmeal cookies!"
"0","5","These are best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly. I added raisins and walnuts and they came out perfectly."
"0","4","Really good cookies. Even the dough tastes good to eat. The cookies didn't stay as soft for me. I ended up cooking longer as I couldn't lift them from the sheet (needed to let them set on sheet longer after taking them out of the oven... I was impatient and wanted cookies NOW, so cooked longer so we could handle quicker)... so that was likely the reason they weren't as soft. Good flavor. We like both hard and soft cookies, so being crisper was OK with us."
"0","5","This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever used. I'll be using this one for years to come. Thank you for sharing!!"
"0","5","Excellent! After reading other reviews, I didn't chill the dough or flatten the cookies with a fork, and they turned out wonderful. Loved them."
"0","5","My favorite oatmeal cookie yet...i added raisins. I am definitely filing this one away."
"0","5","OMG - that's all I can say. Mu husband and I took them to our jobs because we could not stop eating them!! Next time I'll freeze some of the dough and only make small batches."
"0","4","Easy to put together, chewy and great. Had a really stong flavour."
"0","5","They came out perfect! Although I accidentally put baking powder instead of baking soda. Next time I may try to cut back on some of the sugar for a healthier version! Awesome cookies!"
"0","5","I absolutley loved these cookies and they have now become the best cookie ever."
"0","5","I made these for my family, and they love it. I did use 1/2 cup less white sugar, and added raisins. Oatmeal raisin is my favorite, and I don't have to buy store bought anymore."
"0","5","Mmmmmm...these are the BEST oatmeal cookies! You have really got a great recipe here. I will look no furhter for another oatmeal cookie recipe. This will the only that I make! I added raisins to mine and they were yummy and the cookies are so nice and chewy with just that right touch of crispiness. Highly recommend this recipe. You won't be disappointed! :-)"
"0","5","This recipe is incredible - one of the best batches of cookies I've made ever. Thank you!"
"0","5","This recipe is so good. I didn't bother refrigerating the dough so my cookies came out a little flatter, but still very chewy! I also used craisins instead of raisins and the flavor is great!"
"0","5","I'm keeping this one around as my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe."
"0","5","Wonderful! these cookies came out perfict! no need to chill dough before baking. I also added 1/2cup bittersweet chocolate chips, 1/2cup rasins. for 2in rolled balls I needed eleven minutes baking time. Look no futher for the best oatmeal cookie recipe."
"0","5","Mixed the main ingredients and separated in half - one half I added cinnamon and walnuts and the other half I added pecans and choc. chips. Both were good but the cinnamon walnut version was the winner. These are excellent cookies and everyone loved them! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","This is by far the best recipe I have ever found for oatmeal cookies. They come out chewy and are so delicious! They also freeze very well. Watch out they are very addictive. I have a hard time eating just one!"
"0","5","OUSTANDING RECIPE! Chewy and delicious... very addictive!"
"0","5","these are the best oatmeal cookies i ever made!"
"0","5","This is one of the best oatmeal cookies I have found in over 20 years!! I lost the one I received from my mother, but this one is better, she even said so!!!!!"
"0","5","These are the first oatmeal cookies I've ever made, and I'm incredibly pleased with how they've turned out.  And I'm telling you, the dough is almost as good as the finished product."
"0","5","Very soft, very good. These are very tasty and I followed the recipie exsact. I only added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Then I put rasins in 1/2 and choc.chips in the second 1/2 for the rasin-haters in my family. Thanks!"
"0","5","Great cookie! Made as directed except added milk chocolate chips! A keeper!"
"0","5","These are perfect! I cooked a couple batches a little longer than suggested just because I love crisp oatmeal cookies."
"0","5","This has to be one of the best recipes I have used for oatmeal cookies. Soft, yet chewy. Perfect consistency. I did not chill for an hour, but put in the freezer for 30 minutes and dropped by teaspoon full and flattened slightly with spoon."
"0","5","Great cookie recipe....always a favorite!"
"0","4","Taste was great!!The only thing I did not like was the color of the baked cookie ~ my hubby said it looked like plaster of paris!  I would make again."
"0","5","This recipe is so awesome! I have made it many times and my family ALWAYS wants more!! i love the cinnamon it makes a big difference than the other recipes that i have tried that don't include it. I havent made many changes, i just add slightly more baking soda and 1/4 cup(or more depending how i feel) extra of quick cooking oats to make them cookies more oaty! Everyone raves about them, and loves the softness! thanks so much for sharing :)"
"0","5","These were alsome I didnt change one thing on this recipe. they were truly soft oatmeal cookies."
"0","3","I added some dried cranberries and chopped pecans. Maybe that was the problem. They were just okay for me."
"0","5","My family loved these cookies. Added a bit more flour, some left over semi-chocolate chips, macademia nuts, dark chocolate, walnuts, and extra vanilla extract. Delicious!!!!! My husband ate most of it right after they were done baking.  UPDATE: Just made these and OMG! So delish! Made some more changes. 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce. 1 cup of brown sugar. 2 tsp of vanilla. 2 cups whole wheat flour. 2 tsp cinnamon. 2 eggs. 1 tsp baking soda. 1 tsp salt. 3 huge cups of oatmeal. Did not flatten or refrigerate. The cookies came out moist and did not get flat like a pancake. Surprisingly the cookies rose high and all I did was roll them in balls onto a parchment paper. Added tons of raisins and my 1 year old and husband devoured so many for dessert. ^_^ Will make often and will try it next time with no butter...just applesauce and less sugar."
"0","5","These cookies come out perfect every time! Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","these cookies are sensational...really moist and delicous.I added 1/2 cup of chopped nuts and i grated 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg...it was great!"
"0","5","Absolutely perfect. I didn't bother with refrigerating these. It's pretty cool in my kitchen though. I doulbed the recipe and they are delicious!"
"0","4","These are fantastick!! I only gave them only 4 stars because they fell flat when they cooled. I baked them for about 12 min. becuase I like them with crisp edges and chewy centers. Perfect for dunking in milk. I would try these again."
"0","5","These are absolutely the best I've found so far. Even beats out the Quaker Oats recipe found inside their container top. I did make a small change however, in my second batch I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for a little added kick."
"0","5","FANTASTIC!!!!!!!"
"0","4","I think I really needed to used quick cooking oats rather than just regular rolled oats...but either way, my cookies still turned out delicious! Very easy recipe, very chewy, and not too sweet like alot of other recipes out there. Just watch out with the stickiness of the dough, definitely don't try rolling it into balls, just try sculpting balls with a fork and spoon on your cookie sheet. I'm thinking next time I'll throw in some butterscotch chips instead of the usual raisin/nut combo. Overall one of the better oatmeal raisin cookie recipes I've come across!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at making oatmeal cookies and they turned out great! I used a little less white and brown sugar and added some chocolate chips. I baked them for 8 minutes and they were a little *too* soft for my liking so next time i'll bake them longer. Overall, they were very tasty!"
"0","5","These cookies are excellent! Soft, chewy, moist, sweet... Yum! I substituted WW flour for the AP flour and kept everything else the same. I had no nuts or raisins so was a bit worried they'd be on the plain side but they're fantastic. Also, I tried both ways, flattening with a sugar dipped fork, and not flattening them and the non flat ones were that tiny bit better.. This is the 3rd cookie recipe I've tried from this site and these are by far the best : )"
"0","5","ITS A GREAT RECIPE...I JUST MADE ONE CHANGE THE OATMEAL...I USED QUAKER NATURAL GRANOLA CEREAL.....WITH THE OATS AND RAISINS AND NUTS.....IT CAME OUT GREAT I WAS LITTLE SCARED BUT IT WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST...SO MUCH FOR SHORTCUTS"
"0","5","I baked these cookies for a project I was leading at work and they were a HUGE hit! One of my co-workers even commented that if the nursing thing doesn't work out, I'll always have a future in baking...funny, cause I'm a very novice baker! As suggested by another rater, I added chocolate chips to half the dough and craisins and white chocolate to the other...both very good choices. I also used 1 cup ww flour in place of 1 of the cups of white and they came out really really good."
"0","5","Wonderful! I made them for my boyfriend and he loved them. He raved about them to all his friends."
"0","5","Turned out great! Added chunks of chocolate and sprinkled tops with sugar to add a little sweetness - like it really needed any more sugar! LOL! Good stuff!"
"0","5","Great cookies - soft but not so soft they stuck to each other & tasted great! Everyone else loved them! Plus, while this dough was refrigerating, I was able to use the time to bake my choc chip cookies, so this recipe helped me manage my time a lot better too!"
"0","5","These oatmeal cookies are the best! Soft and moist, very yummy. I followed the recipe, except subsituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the butter, and added about a teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg. They were a big hit with my husband, who is already asking for more! Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
"0","4","I liked this recipe, but I guess I prefer a little bit lighter and crispier oatmeal cookies. These ones were a little thick and dense. That is all personal preference though. I took them out a little early to make sure they were nice and soft and they set up nicely. My family really liked these too. They were gone the next day. Overall, very good, easy recipe."
"0","5","What a great recipe!! Best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. The first batch I made, I added cinnamon chips...absolutely fabulous!! Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find them since. I've made these with Splenda, reg. sugar & with both & they taste great either way."
"0","5","Very good flavor. I reduced the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and baked it for 8 minutes."
"0","4","These cookies were great. I made some changes which included reducing the salt level to 1/2 teaspoon and the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and the flavor of the cookies great. I added a 1/2 cup of raisins. I did not chill the dough after preparing it however it was not sticky at all. I used an ungreased cookie sheet and baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 12 minutes and they were a nice color and chewy."
"0","5","This is a delicious cinnamony oatmeal cookie. Some of my cookies were chewy because I cooked them longer and some were very soft. Both are yummy! No raisins for us and they turned out just great. Thanks!"
"0","5","I really loved this recipe. I made them and while they were chilling in the fridge I watched a movie! I baked them a little less than they say to because they were getting really dark and too crispy so my last batch was perfect and chewy I will use this again for sure"
"0","4","This is a great recipe. I didn't have vanilla, but had some vanilla sugar, so I used that on top of the cookies. Couldn't really even taste that I left out vanilla in the mix. For the best soft cookies, don't cook more than 8 minutes!"
"0","5","I couldn't believe how good these turned out. I baked them for 8 minutes, and they were a little crispy on the outside but *perfectly* chewy on the inside."
"0","5","This turned out GREAT! I added toffee bits to the cookies as well but they would have been delicious anyways. I shared them with coworkers, friends, dog walker and received compliments from all. They stay so moist that my friend found one in her coat pocket days after I gave it to her and it was still soft and delicous."
"0","5","Just wanted to say Thank You to Barbara for an easy, delicious, and perfect cookie!"
"0","5","These are awesome. I only had 2 cups of oats on hand so I substituted 1 cup of Wheat Germ. My dough wasn't chilled so I didn't mash the balls down with a fork and they worked great. They set up very chewy and after sitting out until the next morning were still soft and delicious."
"0","5","Great cookies! I can't stop eating the cookie dough when I 'm baking them!!!! My husband loves them too, which definitely makes them a keeper. Thanks-"
"0","5","Wonderful!"
"0","5","Great and easy recipe. I did not wait to cook cookies and did not have trouble with them being too sticky. I did let my 5 year old sugar-fork the top which he loved doing. Will definitely do again!"
"0","5","This is a great cookie recipe. Very soft cookie. Just the right amount of sweet/salt combination. Good brown sugar taste. I used half whole wheat flour, and I think I'll use all whole wheat flour next time."
"0","5","Dad loved them, even John thought they were great."
"0","5","Passed the test! Besides the adults, the picky 13 year old boy and the picky 8 year old girl thought they were soooooo good. I goofed and never noticed it said 'quick cooking oats'. I used my regular Quaker oats, and they STILL came out soft, round, and delicious. I did not flatten before baking. Cookies came out perfect."
"0","5","They were so good. I loved them."
"0","5","Loved it! I soak raisins (1 1/2 Cup) in warm water and added the raisins to the cookies just before baking. Perfect chewy soft cookie!"
"0","5","These came out really good & taste great! I did add half a cup of raisins and half a cup of walnuts. Yummm!! I refrigerated the dough overnight & it was easy to work with the next day. This recipe will be for keeps! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This were great, my son loves oatmeal cookies which is why I looked up the recipe, he loved this ones, he asked for them the whole week for the school snack and my boyfriend just keeps asking for more. Thanks!"
"0","5","Really good cookies. I added a 1/2 tsp. ground cloves and a splash of milk and veganized the ingredients. I also left the cookies in for a bit longer. Turned out great."
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly. Cookies came out great. Everyone like them. This is a keeper."
"0","5","These cookies are only the second thing I've ever baked, and they turned out great. Very soft and chewy cookies, and the recipe was pretty easy, too."
"0","5","Great little oatmeal cookies! This recipe is a keeper! The dough was really tough but made really great cookies!"
"0","5","Great cookies! I followed the recipe except I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup. Cookies tasted great. I also added raisins and pecans. Husband loved them. I will make these again."
"0","5","I made these for my friends and they were a big hit! I followed the recipe just as is, and they turned out great. They're a nice soft cookie that wasn't too sweet which I appreciated. I am definitely keeping this recipe."
"0","5","Very soft, easy to make! I added chocolate caramel chips and they were delicious."
"0","5","Made these for a school party and the kids that didn't like oatmeal, ate these and asked for more!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and also a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and omitted the raisins b/c I don't like biting into something squishy like that. I will definitely make these again over the holidays, possibly even with some vanilla icing sandwiched between 2 cookies. Thanks for sharing this yummy and easy recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious, easy, and cheap to make!"
"0","5","Even after i added twice as much flour by accident and added water to even out the consistancy, these cookies flew to corowrker's mouths. They especially loved the craisin/white chocolate ones. I will definately be making these again for the holidays."
"0","5","i have been married 4 years and have messed up every cookie recipe. i attempted these for my husband, and they were perfect. i was makeing them for a sandwich cookie and they were in and out of the freezer like 5 times and each time they were as soft and chewy as when they were out of the oven. they are the best cookies i have ever had, and oatmeal cookies are my favorite!!!"
"0","5","Guilty pleasure! The key to the recipe is the butter which makes them delicious. Key changes - half batch with cherry craisens other half with mini choc chips. I prefer crispy oatmeal cookies so I formed balls and squished down with hand until very thin and baked until golden brown. They don't flatten or expand much during baking. Keeper."
"0","5","Super good! I added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup raisins and they're disappearing in no time. I was concerned that they were not done all the way through when I took them out but letting them sit for the 5 minutes on the baking sheet really firmed them up."
"0","5","Great recipe! I used some of the other suggestions, I used only brown sugar, egg whites no cinnamon and added half a bag of chocolate chips. Very yummy cookies, I can't keep my kids or husband out of them!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe tonight and I Love it! Love that the recipe can be changed around a little. Made some as in recipe, and some with raisins. They turned out beautifully. For something different I tried some with crunchy peanut butter and some with mashed banana, and then a few with both the peanut butter and bananas, even though the texture changed once I added those two items, they still turned out great! I will be making them again!"
"0","5","I made those cookies when I had guests from Hong Kong and they loved it. I'm going to make those again definetely."
"0","4","Very good, easy to make and soft & chewy as promised. The reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 was that I found them a bit too sweet. I will make again, but reduce the sugar."
"0","5","Every time I make these cookies, they are a huge hit with everyone. My husband even likes them better than his mom's oatmeal cookies (which he loves). I add about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Next time I am going to try cutting the sugar a little, though."
"0","5","VERY GOOD AND VERY EASY TO MAKE"
"0","5","these are yummy! I added allspice instead of cloves on the advice of another review and it was perfect! also, we are not raisin lovers so I used Ghirrardelli milk choc. chips instead. awesome."
"0","5","everyone asks for this recipe when I make these cookies! I usually add dried sour cherries, coconut and sometimes walnuts if they're for nut fans."
"0","5","My new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! I used a 2oz scoop and gently pressed with my fingers instead of the sugared fork. Since they were pretty big I increased the cook time to 11 minutes. I completely didnt see that I needed to chill the dough until I came on to write a review. They turned out great and I cant wait to try mix-ins such as raisins or choc chips etc. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","4","they were very chewy and good but they werent soft enough...to make them soft i would suggest flattening them out a bit more on the pan, so that they spread much more easily..."
"0","5","All I needed to add was chocolate chip cookies. These disappeared within hours!"
"0","5","Really good and really easy. I added raisens and a little clove as suggested. They're a little flat but who cares."
"0","4","we used butter instead of shortening. they were very good!"
"0","5","these cookies were perfect! i added a dried fruit medeley (cranberries, blueberries, cherries, golden raisins) and also added chopped/toasted pecans and walnuts. the batch didnt even last a whole day!"
"0","5","these were great! I accidentally put in a tsp. of baking powder too - not sure how it changed the cookies, if at all, but they were GREAT! Soft and crunchy, all at once! I used regular oats too - I could tell the difference, but they were still very good."
"0","4","Good cookie, I had to drop down the tempature as mine kept turing really brown even at a reduced time."
"0","3","a bit dry.. not the best I've ever had."
"0","4","Cookies are definately soft and moist, however there they seems to be missing the oatmeal cookie flavor."
"0","5","mmm good! this was my frist time making cookies period and they turned out soft, chewy and delicious!!"
"0","3","Recipe was okay, something is better then nothing. Didn't have time to put in the refrigerator for an hour but after I creamed the sugar, butter etc. in a metal bowl I put it in the freezer while I added the dry ingredients together and put everything away. I then mixed it. It was difficult to turn into a ball but it stayed fat and didn't spread out during the cooking. So that helped."
"0","3","it's a bit too sweet. Taste much better with smaller amt of sugar"
"0","5","Fantastic!"
"0","5","I'm the only one in our family that doesn't like raisins, so I was excited about this recipe.... I made them both ways and was really surpised to see the raisinless cookies go first. These will be a regular at our house."
"0","5","Delicious flavor, the cinnamon really adds a great touch. I doubled the vanilla for extra taste. These did not turn out soft but I have a horrible oven so it's not surprising. They did have amazing taste and texture, regardless!"
"0","5","YUMMY!!"
"0","3","These were good but not the best I've ever had. I think Grandmothers Oatmeal Cookies from this site, is a better recipe."
"0","5","A delicious oatmeal cookie. Soft raisins and crunchy walnuts make the perfect combo. Thank you."
"0","5","This was very good! Best oatmeal cookies I have made."
"0","5","Awesome! I added butterscotch baking chips. These didn't last long!"
"0","5","These are really good! For a variation (I've done these both ways now), try leaving out the raisins and spice, and add vanilla and chocolate chips, makes it a very kid-friendly recipe, and retains it's hearty oatmeal texture."
"0","4","these have a super delicious flavor but for some reason mine turned out really flat and I didn't even flatten them with a fork. Not sure what I did wrong but i'm happy to try again!"
"0","5","These cookies turned out wonderfully! My dad loves oatmeal cookies so I made them for father's day and he gobbled them up. Yum!"
"0","5","terrific!"
"0","5","Stellar."
"0","5","Really Great!! I added white chocolate chips...yummy. Thank you!"
"0","5","I love these cookies. They turned out great. I added some chocolate chips to them and it was nice. I a going to add some crasins next time."
"0","4","I made these tonight because I wanted something sweet.They were really good but needed a bit more flavor,I didnt add raisens so that was probably my problem,but all in all they were are really good cookie and they did stay soft and I love soft cookies,"
"0","5","Great cookies. Everyone loves them!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe. The best I have ever tried. My favorite cookie is oatmeal. I will use this recipe over and over. I added raisins and pecans this time. They were devine. Thanks."
"0","4","Very good cookie with a light cinammon flavor, crunchy outside and soft center. I followed the recipe as written. My family prefers a thicker cookie."
"0","5","I love this rec. because it makes the same great cookies everytime, no failed attempts."
"0","5","Great recipe. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup white. Great texture and really yummy. Make sure you don't over bake them, and they will come out nice and chewy :)"
"0","5","These are wonderful! I also changed the sugar to add more brown sugar. Next time I make these, I will make them smaller. These are big cookies. YUM!"
"0","5","Moist, simple, delicious"
"0","5","These were great! Very soft and chewy. Definately will make again."
"0","4","I made these with the other reviewers suggestion of 1 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I added 1 teaspoon orange extract, 1 cup dried cranberries, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. So good!"
"0","4","This recipe is pretty good, but too much cinnamon. If you plan to add chocolate skip the cinnamon completely."
"0","5","These are one of my husband's favorite cookies. I like them because they are soft in the center and just crisp enough around the edges. Great recipe."
"0","5","I have a 14 year old athlete in the house and he doesn't like cookies too much. He needed to add oatmeal to his diet and this was my last hope. He doesn't like oatmeal, but absolutely loves these cookies. Very soft, moist and great flavor just the way they are. I didn't chill in the refriderator, just didn't have the time, and they turned out great. Will definitely make these again. Thanks!"
"0","4","I thought these were pretty good. I like my oatmeal cookies more fluffy and softer. But the flavor was very good."
"0","5","Awesome! I added dark chocolate chips, Craisins, and a little coconut. Yummmmy!!! Thanks!"
"0","5","My search for a perfect oatmeal cookie has ended. These cookies were soft, chewy and delicious! Easy to throw together – I didn’t even chill the dough. I added cranberries, coconut and walnuts. So good, they unfortunately didn’t last very long. Next time I will have to double the recipe!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS...I have tried so many Oatmeal Cookie recipes and this one definitely stands out from the rest. I added a cup of plumped raisins but made no other alterations. I was making them for my husbands co-workers, but I can't stop my family from eating them...I will have to make another batch. Thanks so much for our new favorite cookie recipe!!"
"0","5","Best flavor of any oatmeal cookie I have ever eaten or made. I did add chocolate covered cranberries and they turned out great.Thanks A+"
"0","5","These are so easy to make and I've got to say - the dough (before baking) is amazing to snack on!!"
"0","5","Excellant! I thought that if I put it in the fridge for too long, it would be to hard to shape (as another poster suggested) so I went ahead and baked them immediately. The cookies spread a little, but were still very good. Next time I will let them chill before baking."
"0","5","I'm a college student who likes to 'try' and bake every now and then, but let me tell you that this recipe is SO easy to make and the best part of it all were the results they are SO SO GOOD!! One batch of these cookies were gone by the end of dinner!! They come out very moist and soft!! I'd also like to thank those of you who posted the FYI for adding and plumping the rasins!!! :) :)"
"0","5","There is only one way to describe this recipe....PEFIRECT. best Ive made in a long time. Grandmas were nver this good"
"0","4","This is a great recipe that stands on it's own for your basic oatmeal cookie. Nothing fancy, just goodness."
"0","5","These cookies are awesome as is/or cause I can never leave well enough alone-you can add 1 tsp allspice 1 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg...mmm mmm mmm...my new oatmeal cookie standard recipe-AWESOME!!!"
"0","5","Best oatmeal cookies I've made in a long time. I used real butter and a little less cinnamon and they turned out great!"
"0","4","This recipe was very yummy however I held back a bit on the cinnamon and I made the cookie very large and cooked them for an extra 10 minutes. More to enjoy!"
"0","5","These cookies are great! My family is constantly making requests for them. I usually prep the night before baking, rather than the one hour chill time to make mix a little firm before baking."
"0","5","They were a little to sweet for me but wonderful taste. Definitly a keeper. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","4","The cookies were moist ans soft as promised. I made a large batch and froze individual serving sizes of cookie dough. They reheat very well. Just a little too much cinnamon."
"0","5","First time cookie maker here! This recipe was very simple, and a hit with the whole family. My dad ate half the cookies in a matter of hours!! I will deffinetly be making this one again."
"0","5","These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. I have been using this recipe for a year now and everyone raves about these cookies. I do add 1/2 cup of flour and 1 cup raisins. I do not flatten my balls and they come out soft and fat, rather than soft and flat. Everyone should try these."
"0","5","Easy to make and they taste amazing! The cookies came out soft and remained soft for a few days. I added one cup of chocolate chips. My favourite oatmeal recipe so far!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious. This recipe is definately a keeper!"
"0","5","Yum! I made these with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup golden crisco. Then added raisins and walnuts to half the batch and dried cranberries and pecans to the other half. A new family favorite."
"0","3","I didn't care for these much. They were rather bland to me. I give this three stars because my husband likes them but I doubt I'll make these again. Still searching for the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie recipe..."
"0","5","Great cookie; soft and gooey and utterly delicious. And, even though I shouldn't be saying this, for all you cookie dough lovers out there--the dough tastes wonderful. I haven't tried a big variety of oatmeal cookies, so I cannot compare to others, but this was one tasty cookie."
"0","5","These cookies were fantastic. My husband who hates oatmeal cookies loves these! There is no need to refrigerate the dough prior to baking. They flatten out on their own with room temperature dough. I also added raisins. Delicious!!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe almost exactly withe the exception of using the sugared fork. Instead i rolled in balls and pressed down a little before baking and they turned out great."
"0","5","Tried many oatmeal cookies and my family liked yours overall."
"0","5","This is great recipe. I added a cup of chopped pecans and gave them away as christmas gifts. A big hit!"
"0","5","These cookies are so wonderful!!!!! Even my better half loved them. And he is not even a fan of oatmeal cookies. Followed the recipe, except did not do the sugared fork part. Also I did not add nuts or raisins and they were extreamly delicious on their own! Will make again, thanks Barbara!!!"
"0","5","If I could this would be a 10+ .... Wonderful cookie, far better than any store bought oatmeal cookie. I also used more spice. Half the recipe I dipped the fork in sugar and the other half left plain on top. Added lots of raisins, in fact the mixture was so thick had to mix it with my hand, but thats the fun part along with eating them. Thanks for sharing. Ealine"
"0","5","My new favorite!!! Because I love cinnamon, I used 2 tsp. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","These cookies are the best! I followed this recipe to a 'T' and they were so soft and sweet. This was a perfect recipe for a toddler to help with; my daughters favorite part was flattening the cookies with a sugared fork=)"
"0","5","I made these especially for my picky hubby after trying other homemade recipes he didn't care for and he loved these.. They were very easy to make. We will be keeping this one! Thanks for the oportunity.."
"0","5","Soft and chewy!! Just awesome!! I followed the recipe just as is."
"0","5","Nice and chewy; the texture I was looking for. No raisins for me, but next time I might add some chocolate chips or nuts. Mixed the oatmeal in with the other dry ingredients by mistake, but still turned out great. Thanks, Barbara!"
"0","5","THE BEST OATMEAL COOKIES I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! I have been following the recipe off of the oatmeal box for years. I just discovered THIS recipe and WOW! These cookies are so soft and chewy and FLAVORFUL. No more cake-like, bready cookies will I ever make again. THIS is the ULTIMATE oatmeal cookie recipe. My kids gobble them up! 5 STARS all the way!!"
"0","5","Good Flavor, Nice and Soft"
"0","5","Excellent! Soft, gooey, flavorful! The best oatmeal cookie we've made yet! We researched what makes a gooey soft cookie and adjusted the recipe slightly. Also, we added walnuts, raisins, and more spices like the other reviews. Otherwise, we followed the cooking instructions for eight minutes and it turned out great!"
"0","5","These were good, my husband really liked them and I'm sure I'll make them again. These would probably be even better with some sort of chips (chocolate, PB, etc) but I wanted to skip out on extra fat. I really like this recipe because it doesn't specifically call for raisins and can get away with it. Like many reviewers, I got about 4 dozen instead of 2, which is fine with me :-)"
"0","4","Good. Added 1 cup raisins. Made 4 dozen. Took 10min to bake."
"0","5","Very good. I added 2 cup of white chocolate and we really enjoyed them."
"0","5","soft and chewy and nice flavor"
"0","5","very good cookies.soft and chewy. I varied the recipe a little. I used 2 cups of individual packets of raisin and spice instant oatmeal and 1 cup of regular rolled oats. Made for a tasty cookie. My kids loved them. This is a keeper! Thanks."
"0","5","Oh my goodness...I LOVED these cookies and I am not a huge oatmeal raisin cookie fan. I added 1 cup of raisins (used baking raisins which are softer and more plump than regular raisins). CAUTION: do not double this recipe unless you have a 'monster' of a mixer. I tried to double it and almost burned up the motor on my mixer. It is a very stiff dough. I ended up kneading it with my hands. The trouble was worth it though because they were probably the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. My friend (an oatmeal-raisn cookie expert) loved them but offers the advice of using more raisins and a bit more cinnamon."
"0","4","Really tasty. I've made these cookies with both butter and margarine with great results. I've managed to get over 4 dozen average-sized cookies from this recipe."
