"3684","5","I had read on here that people were having trouble with the cookie being too thin, so I added a 1/2 cup more flour, and also 1/2 more peanut butter. the cookie came out great! also added 1 teaspoon vanilla."
"2087","5","This is an excellent recipe. My family likes peanut butter cookies to be a little softer/chewier so I increased the flour by 1/4 cup and also added 1/4 cup more peanut butter. Also, I baked them on 350 for about 9 minutes or so- but watch carefully not too over bake them! They were just soooo good!"
"1753","5","Thank you Shirley! This is a fabulous recipe. After reading some very helpful comments, I made a few minor changes. Increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, baked at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes. After forming the dough into balls, I dipped them in sugar and with sugar side up, gently created a criss-cross pattern on top. The cookies are well balanced--crispy edges, chewy centers. Delicate peanut butter flavor. My whole family loved them!!"
"576","5","These cookies were for sure the best Peanut Butter cookies I ever made. I too added just a little more flour and a little more Peanut Butter. I made 2 dozen cookies with them and they were a hit. I made them super soft and gooey. Pull them out of the oven even when they are soft, and let them cool, they will be just the right crispiness on top but soft on the inside. I think I baked my cookies for about 6 or 7 minutes.   Good luck and enjoy!"
"527","4","Very good cookies with just a little tweaking. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and, because I like my peanut butter cookies very peanut buttery, an additional cup of peanut butter. Just for something a little different I threw in a package of chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips. Because the dough is made with butter, chill the dough till somewhat firm and you won't end up with thin cookies...no need to add more flour!"
"462","5","I love these cookies! I was out of crunchy PB, so I used creamy, also didn't have unsalted butter, so used the salted and left out the 1/2 tsp. salt. Also, mine took exactly 10 minutes to bake. My kids loved them!!"
"296","4","As is the recipe is 4 stars. I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't had to make some changes. I followed the suggestions of others and added 1/4 c. extra flour and 1/4 c. extra peanut butter, and put 1 t. vanilla in. I rolled them in sugar before pressing with a fork. I baked them at 350 for 9 minutes. Thanks for a good base recipe."
"208","5","This is a great recipe! My recommendationns are as follow: Cook for 8 minutes on 350. Add 1/4C more peanut butter. Don't flatten the cookies down too much unless you want a crunchy cookie. Substatute a small amount of oil for butter for a more moist cookie. And of course....add a couple handfulls of chocolate chips! This recipes was really delightful!"
"198","3","Ok, to start, the flavor of these cookies is phenomenal. Absolutely delicious. The problem is, you definitely should make these cookies a couple of times before you plan on taking them to any parties. My first try resulted in underdone peanut butter pancakes, and overdone peanut butter frisbees. The cookies flattened out literally to be about an eighth of an inch thick. Not cool. They also spread so wide, that I had beautiful octagonally shaped cookies after I had cut them all apart. After shoving the dough back into the fridge for few days due to frustration, I tried again, and discovered a few changes that make for better cookies. They still don't look like the ones in the picture, but oh well. For one, cool the dough longer than an hour. Three days is perhaps a bit long, but definitely give it a good, solid amount of time in the fridge. Next, don't squish the balls done with a fork. The melting butter and peanut butter doesn't need any help going flat. There aren't any cute fork imprints, but after your cookie has turned into a manhole cover, you don't see the fork marks anyways. Third, after baking, the cookies are going to be really squishy. You're going to think they're not done. Take them out anyways, and carefully move them from the hot baking sheet to a cool, flat surface (like plates, not racks!!). The cookies will cool and be nice and soft, but will harden a bit too, so you can actually eat them. I also added white chocolate chunks, which was yummy."
"185","5","I have been using this recipe since I was a litle girl and first began baking! My best friend's Mom made them for us and I thought they were the best cookie around. My 'twist' to the recipe is rolling each ball in granulated sugar before flattening with a fork and baking. It really adds to the final results and everyone loves them."
"179","4","I creamed the butter, peanut butter, and sugar with my hands. I also tried to beat the eggs with my hands. The hardest part though was sifting and stirring the flour into the mix with my hands.  My mix turned out really lumpy and dry and I couldn't get it to make balls. It just crumbled out of my hands when I rolled them together like sand.  Don't worry if you also do this! I found a way to fix it!  Just add a qaurter stick of melted butter and a little dribble of milk.  The cookies turned out crappy still. But if you like crappy cookies then this is a life saver!"
"54","4","I've been making this recipe for over 4 years now, and people consistently ask me to bring these to gatherings. I do make a few changes as recommended by others, and have it down to a science now. Here are my changes: Use 1/2 cup extra flour use 1/4 cup extra peanut butter - CREAMY to balance the crunchy portion add one overflowing tsp vanilla bake 9 minutes instead of 10  Perfect."
"31","5","This is a great old fashioned recipe. They are crispy yet chewy and great with crunchy peanutbutter. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the recipe. Just like grandma used to make. I made them in about 1' balls (using a melon baller) and flattened with a fork in a criss cross pattern. Made about 6 dozen medium sized cookies."
"25","5","The best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. Putting the dough into the fridge is a must! I even made sure to put it back in to the fridge between batches, otherwise it gets too gooey to roll into balls for baking. Even the raw dough was delicious! I almost made myself sick eating the leftover dough and the hot cookies from the oven. Will make these time and time again!"
"22","5","SOFT CHEWY peanut butter cookies. Amazing. I'm always reluctant to bake PB cookies because so often they're dry and hard. This recipe is brilliant. I made very few changes, just up'd the peanut butter to 1.5c per others recommendations. I'm a sucker for extra decadent, so I threw in a bag of PB chips and a cup chopped roasted peanuts. Not necessary but gave it an extra dose of peanutty goodness. Really though, you can't go wrong with this one!"
"21","5","So great! I followed other commenter's suggestion of adding 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. Also if you have trouble with flat cookies, make sure baking soda is fresh! It goes flat after 30 days or so. I also cooked at 350 for 9 minutes and that worked perfectly."
"18","5","The perfect beanut butter cookie! YUMMM!! I make these up every year to go in my cookie platers for friends and family. Everybody loves them."
"17","5","followed a few reviewer's advise and added 1/2 cup extra peanut butter....I also usd salted butter so I did not add the extra in the recipe. I also used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky. Baked for 10 minutes for chewy cookies...delicious!!!! :o)"
"17","1","these were more like cake cookies, and the peanut butter taste was not nearly strong enough for me...i don't understand how this got so many good ratings. i will not make this again."
"16","5","An excellent peanut butter cookie recipe! I made this exactly as written. The dough tasted totally amazing, lol. The cookies were awesome too. Nice and crisp with an excellent peanut and butter flavor. This is going to be my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe...thanks for sharing!"
"15","5","Can we say Wholesome goodness. On 1-15-03 I had a massive craving for peanut butter cookies. So I tried this recipe...if I could rate this with 10 stars I would. I'm still making them. Move over Betty here comes Shirley! On the gay scale of 0-10 fingersnaps...it gets 20! You go GURL! Just hope the boyfriend doesn't find the batch I stashed. Oh and these were never crumbly, or burnt on the bottom,just in for 10 minuntes no longer, no later! FABULOUS!!! BUT GET SOME STRONG MAN TO MIX IN THE DRY THINGS INTO THE PEANUTBUTTER/BUTTER...CAUSE MY DELICATE ARM ALMOST FELL OFF...;)"
"14","5","Following the reviews, I added about a quarter cup to a half cup of extra peanut butter and of flour plus a teaspoon of vanilla and used smooth peanut butter since I don't keep crunchy on hand. The cookies got rave reviews.  I took them to work as well as to a girls' night and people were very happy with them. I separated them into half batches - one of which I had in the fridge for barely an hour and the other which was in for 24 hours - both turned out well!   Additionally, I baked the first batch a tad under the suggested time (as my oven burns hot) and they were soft for days. The second batch I baked to recommendations and they were much firmer and were crumbly biscuit cookies (though not hard) the next day so depending on what kind you want, watch the baking time!"
"13","5","I have made peanut butter cookies MANY times, but the recipe that I always use is in storage. So, I decided to try this one, and it was really good! I only made half a batch, because we were low on peanut butter. And, I used all natural creamy peanut butter. I also added a half tsp. of vanilla. I didn't refrigerate the dough at all, and didn't really feel like I needed to. It was easy enough to work with. I made them a little on the small side, and rolled the balls in sugar before my 4yo made the criss-cross pattern with the fork. Then I baked them for 6 minutes and let them cool a minute on the pan before removing them. The cookies didn't spread too much like a lot of peanut butter cookies do, and I liked that. They are nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside- everything a peanutbutter cookie should be! Other reviewers said that these needed more flour and more peanut butter. I disagree. I think the amounts were spot on. Perhaps their cookies thinned out too much because they flattened them too much while making the criss-cross pattern? This is a VERY GOOD peanut butter cookie recipe and I know I will be making them again and again."
"13","5","Fabulous cookie recipe! I used creamy peanut butter and salted butter because that's what I had on hand. I did add a scant 1/4th teaspoon of salt. I used brown sugar only, 2 cups. I refigerated the dough as directed and had no problem with over spreading. I made these cookies large. My husband who is very picky loved them. Surprise! Surprise!"
"12","4","these are really good peanut butter cookies. ihad to add about 1/2 a cup of water beacause they were a bit dry."
"12","5","These cookies have a crunchy but soft texture. I am nine years old (my mom supervised me!) and I do not like a lot of things but these are the best!!!! We did use only 3/4 cup of each sugar, which mom liked. We added 1/2 cup more of flour and peanut butter as others suggested. Mom says probably do not need the extra 1/2 cup of flour, that makes them a bit too crumbly."
"11","1","The portions on this recipe are all wrong. I made this exactly as stated and, first of all, it made way more than 24 cookies. Second, the flavor of these was just not there and the texture was not good. Waste of good ingredients."
"11","5","These cookies are amazing. Don't forget to put a slice of bread in with your cookie tin or jar to keep the cookies moist. YUM!"
"11","5","My new favorite Peanut butter cookie recipe!"
"10","5","This recipe has all the ingredients, but lacks the soul of a fabulous cookie if prepped as written. Here's my changes: 1st beat egg light and fluffy..rinse beaters and dry. Then cream butter; Start w warm butter and brown sugar, you should use high power then cream white sugar. Should take several minutes to cream..... . Scrape sides of bowl often to eliminate granules. Add peanut butter and blend well .finally add egg and beat to mix SIFT dry ingredients together, add a little at a time. Mix slowest speed until just blended  I baked at 375 for 6 minutes. Cookies did not look done, but left on cookie sheet for 5 minutes then transferred onto hard surface to cool. This seals in the moisture resulting In a crispy crunch and chewy delicious smooth pb taste!"
"10","5","Omigosh, SO good! Crisp, chewy, peanut buttery, delicious! I rolled in sugar as well, just for a little extra texture."
"10","5","I used salted butter and smooth peanut butter. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and omitted the salt. I also added a package of peanut butter chips. I made 2 tbsp sized balls, dipped the tops in sugar and pressed with a fork. I baked them for 9 minutes and let them cool 2 minutes before putting them on a cooling rack. I got exactly 3 dozen cookies. They taste great. (I skipped the chiling). Thanks."
"10","1","For a cookie, these were rather bland and had little to recommend them. They were dry, not sweet enough, and OILY. I'm not sure how a cookie can be dry and oily at the same time, but these managed."
"9","5","I added more salt, 1/2 t each of baking powder and baking soda. I also added 1 C finely ground dry-roasted peanuts for extra peanuttiest. Could possibly be the best PB cookies I've ever made."
"9","5","Another great cookie! I use this recipe in my bakery department at work, and my customers love this cookie. I make jumbo 4oz cookies, because my customers like big cookies. The cookie is soft and chewy and stay chewy and soft for days; however, my cookies never last more than a couple of days on the retail shelves. For variety, I dip the cookie half way into melted semi-sweet chocolate...wow, it has such a awesome look, it is hard to resist."
"8","5","This was a great recipe! I read through the reviews and decided to add more flour (1/2 cup) and peanut butter (1/2 cup) as suggested, and I also added about 1tsp of vanilla. The temperature was way too high at 375 in my oven, and after scorching the bottoms of the first batch, I reduced the heat to 325 and cooked for 9 minutes. After that, they came out perfect! I even added a milk chocolate center on some of them, for something extra! Great recipe, I plan on making these more often!"
"8","5","These came out perfect! I added some raisins, then baked them at 350* and kept a close eye on them. They were a perfect chewy goodness with crispy edges at about 7 min."
"8","5","OH...MY....GOSH!!! These are INSANELY fabulous!!! wow."
"8","1","Sorry but the flour that was added was soo much and the cookies crumbbled."
"8","5","I only had smooth peanut butter, but it turned out great. I followed other reviewers and added about 1/4 cup more peanut butter, but my boyfriend and I thought that it would have been fine without it. Next time, I will try the recipe as is. Also, I didn't have any issues with the baking temperature or time. I followed the original recipe and they turned out perfect."
"7","4","This recipe is really good!!!! My cookies came out perfect... I added 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips, 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup of pb to the recipe, I also decreased the temp to 350! They came out super yummy!"
"7","5","Delicious, love this recipe, have been making a similar one for the last little while, even good with chocolate chips as a final step. If I make plain peanut butter cookies, I always sprinkle a little white sugar on them before baking for the sweet tooth in me!"
"7","1","i used whole wheat flour instead of white, and that didn't work for me. The cookies didn't flatten out at all - they just burnt on the outside. Next time, I'll try half wheat flour, half white flour."
"7","5","Reading reviews before I made these, I decided to also increase the flour and peanut butter by 1/2 cup each and also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. With these changes I am giving this a 5 star rating. Many were saying that they spread too much using the original recipe, so I didn't want to take a chance. These are a very good tasting peanut butter cookie."
"7","4","These are a great, basic PB cookie. I ended up refrigerating them overnight and didn't have any problems with them spreading too thin."
"7","5","OMG these were AMAZING!!!! I finally found an amazing peanut Butter cookie recipe! i followed the recipe as followed but added 1/4 cup more of flour and Peanut Butter, i set my oven on 350 and baked them for 9 min, and they turned out soooo nice,and round (after rolling them into balls) and were so chewy, and had a good peanut butter flavor to them. they were a bit greasy on the first batch but on the second batch i placed paper towels on a plate to cool them on, and at the same time it sucked up the greasyness!!! WONDERFUL COOKIES!"
"7","5","I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of adding an extra 1/4 cup peanut butter due to the suggestions in other reviews and I used salted butter and did not add any other salt. My dough was a little sticky due to the added peanut butter, but they were still easy to form. They were very easy to make. They came out perfect, crispy, and they melt in your mouth."
"7","5","These cookies are the best! I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and increased the amount to 1 1/4 cups. Baked them for 9 mins. and they're perfect. Just the right amount of flavor and very moist and chewy. My hubby and I can't stop eating them. I'll use this recipe for peanut blossoms at Christmas, also!"
"7","4","My husband said they were really good but they weren't as peanut buttery as I would have liked and they were a little to crispy for me at first. So on the next batch, I left them in the fridge overnight I took them out before they browned and they were softer and tasted better - the way I like them."
"6","5","Thanks! This is a great recipe! I did as the others suggested with the extra quarter cup of flour and pnutbutter. I baked em at 365 for 8 mins and they were perfect. I also did a dozen not rolled in sugar, and the next rolled in sugar before baking, and all of the teen boys here that did the taste test said DEFINITELY rolled in sugar wins! They are soft, not dry at all! Thanks, this is my new recipe, tossing out the old one!"
"6","5","Really the perfect peanut butter cookie! I did customize it like others suggested and added an extra 1/2 cup of PB and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. If you make small cookies they will NOT break apart after cooking so I highly suggest smaller sized ones. I tried medium/larger ones and they were crumbly. I bake a LOT and these were truly among the best cookies I have ever made. They were great out of oven and still perfect much later in the day. I sent them in a care package to my son in college. I think anyone who loves peanut butter cookies will LOVE these."
"6","5","These are great!! I did go with the general consensus of adding on to the flour and peanut butter amounts, but accidentally over-baked the cookies. They didn't burn, but they didn't come out both crispy and chewy - just chewy. Watch very carefully how long you bake them!!"
"6","5","This the best recipe to make pretend (peanut free ) peanut butter cookies. We have a peanut allergy in our household. I thought we'd never have anything like a peanut butter cookie again. Unlike other peanut butter cookie recipes this one turns out great when using a peanut butter alternative. I use sunflower seed butter in place of the peanut butter. After rolling it into a ball, I dip the fork in sugar before pressing down. I bake the cookie as directed. This is a great recipe to use when making allergy friendly peanut butter cookies. We can tell a difference, but it the closest to the real thing we've gotten. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"6","5","Added 1/2 C of extra flour & 1/2 C of extra peanut butter like recommended. Dipped in sugar, and slightly flattened with a fork. Turned out AMAZING!!!!"
"6","5","My friends loved these! I added chocolate chips, vanilla, and more flour and peanut butter. I wish I had crunchy peanut butter with me, though! 10 minutes is perfect."
"6","5","This is my first attempt at a peanut butter cookie. It turned out really yummy ^^ It wasn't too sweet and had the perfect peanuty taste. Very soft too. Thanks for the recipe!"
"6","5","I used salted butter, creamy peanut butter, and cooked them for only 8 minutes so that they were *super* soft. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these."
"6","5","Perfect Perfect Perfect Light, chewy, great texture and taste. Definitely a keeper. Timing is extremely important...it took 12 mins for mine but thats with a gas stove."
"5","5","The best recipe I found for peanut butter cookies. Took the advise of others and increased the flour by 1/2 cup and increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup. Dough is much easier to work with after it has been placed in refrigerator. THANKS FOR SHARING!!!"
"5","5","I absolutely loved these cookies. I used salted butter and creamy peanut butter, but they were amazing."
"5","5","I took the suggestion of other users and added vanilla, extra peanut butter and extra flour....the cookies ended up tasting great!!"
"5","4","We like our PB cookies soft and chewy so I added a 1 cup more flour, 1 1/2 cup more peanut butter, also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Cooked for 8-9 min on 350 degrees."
"5","4","I made the recipe as written and they are flat and lose the criss cross pattern. They do not look like a traditional peanut butter cookie."
"5","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies EVER. And I've made quite a few different recipes of them, as they're my husband's favorite cookie. Do not change a thing! I only added a teaspoon of vanilla, and sprinkled with sugar before smooshing slightly with a fork. AMAZING! Thanks for sharing!!"
"5","2","I added the extra flour and peanut butter other reviewers called for. Cookies were way too crumbly and dry tasting :("
"5","5","I made this for my family the first time and they were so good I made another batch for my kids school party (teachers prefer things without frosting in a class of 2 yr olds) Great Recipe and better than the bakery! I also really appreciate cookie recipes without shortening...I try not to cook with shortening if I can help it."
"5","4","After reading the reviews I added more flour and some vanilla. I still had to chill the dough for 1/2 hour before rolling into balls. As usual I did the fork dipped in sugar thing to make criss crosses. I also did 1/2 crunchy pb and 1/2 creamy (we don't like too much 'crunch'). The cookies were not as chewy or peanut buttery as I've had in the past, but the centers were soft with some crunch around the outside. My 6 year old enjoyed these!"
"5","5","These are GREAT, but like most reviewers, I took creative liberty with the recipe. I increased the flour to 2 3/4 cups, added a teaspoon of vanilla and used an entire 18 oz. jar of Jif crunchy peanut butter. I also threw in a bag (10 oz.) of Reese's peanut butter morsels at the end and rolled them in sugar before criss-crossing the oversized handmade dough balls -- lightly -- with a fork (we like our cookies big and chewy). Baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and cooled on stoneware for 3 minutes before transferring them to the cooling rack. Everyone is raving about how moist and chewy they are! This (modified) recipe is a keeper!"
"5","5","Great mailing cookies. I send these to my husband in Iraq on a regular basis. He loves getting them. I follow the recipe almost exactly. If you live in the south and use White Lilly Flour (the best) remember to add a little extra- I usually add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup- it's more finely milled and less dense, sort of like cake flour. Thanks for a great recipe."
"5","5","These were a HUGE hit both at work and with my boyfriend, who is somewhat of a peanut butter cookie connoiseur. As recommended, I increased the PB and flour and added vanilla too. Perfect!"
"5","5","I am pretty particular when it comes to cookies... seriously.. a good review doesnt come easy as far as I go, BUT this cookies rock! We added chocolate chips and they were fantastic.. .I bet they would be awesome without them, but yeah.. we do the chocolate thing. Thanks for posting this one.. This one is definitely a keeper."
"5","5","Man O Man these cookies are delish! This is the first time I have ever made peanut butter cookies from scratch and I'm glad I chose this recipe! I did add a 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. The cookies are so soft and chewy! Just the way I like 'em. Highly recommend this recipe. I'll be making them again!"
"5","5","Great cookies. They could use more peanut butter flavor, but I liked them. I added about 3 tbsp of ground flaxseed to the flour and I mixed in a cup of oats at the end. I also took the advice of a reviewer and rolled the balls in sugar. I found that the cookies would be fine without the sugar rolling. I also added 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter per suggestions. I used 1/2 cup butter flavored vegetable shortening and 1/2 cup margarine.   I will make these again. Next time I'll add some chocolate chips to a batch. I got more than 24 cookies. I'd say I got close to 3 dozen. They were delicious. They made my guyfriend swoon."
"5","5","these cookies were great! my dad thought they were too."
"5","5","These are the best cookies I've ever made!! I did not melt the butter, just let it sit out until softened. I probably used more peanut butter than called for (I just dragged my wooden spoon out of the pb jar - natural, of course). I made 3' and 1' cookies, and they were both fantastic! I also added a bag of Reese's pb chips. These were very pretty, chewy and so tastey. I also rolled a couple of my batches in sugar."
"5","5","I have been searching for a pb cookie recipe for years. My mom used to have a great one but can't remember it or find it. I need to look no further. These are not too peanut buttery, light and moist. I use crunchy pb and my whole family loves them. Thank you Shirly Sadler!"
"5","5","These are really good cookies! I used salted butter and omitted the salt and made them bigger. Delicious!"
"4","5","The recipe was amazing. I wish.other people would stop addong their suggestions. Of you wsnt to post. your recipe, then do so. Stop telling peop k e who have posted a goid recipe how you made it 'better'. Its rude, narcissistic and shows you to be full of your own self importance, which is disgusting and uncalled for. This recipe wad s mazing AS IS, it needs no other peoples rewrites."
"4","5","A few years ago I was looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe and came across this one, and they were absolutely amazing that I made them a couple of times more. Over the few years since then, every time I want peanut butter cookies(which is quite often), I go for this recipe. Love them."
"4","5","Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it... One might try using an electric mixer and beating the dough extra once the egg is added in to thicken it a bit."
"4","5","Kids and I just made these. I rolled and they smashed. We all had a great time. The cookies were great as well!"
"4","4","Excellent solid recipe. I didn't deliberately change anything...I used salted butter, cause it's what I had, and thus just added a dash of extra salt. I also didn't refrigerate the dough for the first batch because I was impatient.  Oh and I only had creamy peanut butter.  The results were a thinner cookie, but I wouldn't say they were too thin. It made the edges nice and crunchy but the middles were still soft.   Next time I might sub half the butter with shortening to thicken them and enhance the chewyness, and I think they'd be lovely with salted peanuts on top rather than crunchy peanut butter.......but either way these are great as is and a great base recipe to fiddle with and fancy up a bit."
"4","5","These were awesome! I added about 3 TBS of peanut butter powder (the product is called 'PB2 Powdered peanut butter' by Bell Plantation, Inc.), and took them out just as the edges started to brown very, very slightly. Let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or two before removing to a cooling rack. They came out chewy and delicious!"
"4","5","perfect!"
"4","4","These are great! Crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle. I only gave it 4 stars because I did have to make some adjustments. Used additional 1/4 cup flour & peanut butter. Baked for 10 min. At 350. Added 1 Tbs vanilla extract. Due to our own preference, I also used smooth P.B. rather than crunchy. Thanks for the recipe!"
"4","5","As did some of the others, I added 1/4 c more peanut butter, and a 1/4 c more flour, as well as 1 tsp of vanilla. Finally a good pb cookie recipe!"
"4","5","I like my PB cookies softer, so like others, I added a 1/2 cup more flour, and also 1/2 more peanut butter. EXCELLENT!!!!"
"4","4","Great cookie, maybe a tad dry. Next time I would under cook a little more than I did this time around. I used and extra 1/4 cup peanut butter and flour. I really don't think I will add the extra flour next time either, maybe a Tbsp. or two. I normally do not use any sugar other than sucanat, however this time I stuck to the recipe. Next time I will try subbing the sucanat. Oh, and I did not chill in the fridge before I baked them"
"4","4","Not much peanut butter flavor, next time I will use 1/4 cup Butter and 3/4cup peanut Butter"
"4","3","this cookie was average yo. next time i be cookin for my hommies imma be makin these but wit chocolate chips. you know what im sayin?"
"4","3","I like the 'soft peanut butter cookies' recipies from this site the best to be honest. These turned out flat n crispy. I want a soft, moist, LITTLE crispness on the outside kinda cookie. These didn't do it for me."
"4","2","Potential to be good but 2 1/2 cups of flour is way too much! The dough was so dry that it just kept crumbling, I couldnt even smash them down with a fork. I seriously think this must be some typo."
"4","5","These turned out AMAZING! I added 1/4 more flour and peanut butter like others suggested, and omitted the salt because I used salted butter instead. I used crunchy peanut butter and added dark chocolate chips, cooked it at 375 for 10 minutes...PERFECTION! I tried them the next day and they were still soft & chewy, not hard at all."
"4","5","This peanut butter cookie I have ever made. No need to change the recipe is outstanding......."
"4","3","These were good right out of the oven, but tasted dry later..."
"4","3","I made these tonight and the texture of the cookie is amazing! I didn't think they tasted much like peanut butter though. They were a little buttery for my taste. I made the recommended changes of adding more flour and peanut butter. I think next time I would put less butter."
"4","5","Must say...prob the best PB Cookie ive ever had! i used the natural crunchy PB and added large chocolate chunk chips! :) but would have been perfect as is!"
"4","5","Like a lot of reviewers, I made this recipe with the modification of 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I also added vanilla and rolled them in sugar before before putting them on the baking sheet. After baking them for about 8 minutes, they were gooey and crumbly and absolutely delicious little nuggets of wonderfulness.  Edit: I made these again on a whim when I was really tired one night, and didn't realize that there was no brown sugar in the house. I just used white sugar in place of it, and they still turned out amazingly. I made a thumb print in each cookie before baking, and when they were done and cooled, I filled it with a chocolate ganache. It was so freaking divine. They were gone almost instantaneously."
"4","5","I was looking for a recipe like this one, so many peanut butter cookie recipes taste like health food gone wrong. They are meant to be sweet!!! They are cookies!!! I did only add 3/4 c butter, but did not change another thing, fabulous!!"
"4","5","Would give more stars if I could. First, I made homemade peanutbutter and used 1c of that and 1c homemade butter. Added 1/2c more flour per everyone elses suggestion. Yum. Say no more. These are perfect."
"4","5","Mmm, yummy and so like my grandmother's old-fashioned recipe. Chewy centers with a slightly crumbly edge. Make sure to take them out just as they begin to brown, and then leave them on the cookie sheets for a few minutes to firm up a bit. They will almost look like they are not done, but when they cool they are the perfect texture."
"4","1","Based on all these positive reviews, I thought I must have done something wrong. I double checked the recipe I was using, and I am certain I followed every step. From a house full of peanut butter fans, we were very disappointed. Something is very 'off' with this cookie. Sorry."
"4","4","Loved these cookies! My sons ate them and were left with big smiles on their faces! It's a keeper."
"4","5","I didn't make any changes other than add a little more peanut butter. About a heaping cup full. I baked at 350` for 10 minutes as well and they came out perfect."
"4","5","New favorite PB cookie recipe. Added 1/4 cup flour and upped PB to 1.5 cups. Cooked for 10 min in my oven. Turned out chewy and soft and stayed chewy/soft for the next 4 days. Best PB cookie recipe I've ever tried and the only recipe I will use from now on."
"4","4","Made 1/2 the recipe and still go 24+ cookies (after 'sampling a lot of dough!). Increased PB (used Trader Joe's organic crunchy) as suggested, used peanut flour (also from TJ's) instead of wheat flour. Added some vanilla bean paste, it's like thick vanilla extract but with a bit more flavor. The result was a very very dry crumb like dough. I added 1/4cup of water. I made flat rounds not balls and made the traditional fork marks. The cookies are great look perfect and have wonderful flavor.  I wanted a cookie without wheat and higher in protein. These work great!"
"4","5","YUMMY!!!! I did follow the recommendations of the others and added 1/2 c. flour 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1tsp. vanilla. Lowered temp to 350 and baked for 8-9min. You won't be disappointed!!!"
"4","5","Easy and delicious! My whole family loved the recipe."
"4","5","Great cookie! I went with the other reviewers comments and added an extra 1/4 c of flour and peanut butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. They turned out fabulous! Crunchy on the outside, yet chewy and soft in the middle. A definite keeper! I am planning on using them in some of my Christmas food gifts...makes a great addition to a tin of cookies for your friends and family. Thanks for the recipe!"
"4","5","Huge hit! We used creamy PB, and half butter/half shortening cause I ran out of butter and they are amazing. Very soft with great PB flavor"
"4","5","So far, the best peanut butter cookie we've had. Yum!!!!! Little crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Perfect~"
"4","1","Didn't like these, I did everything the way the recipe said except I didn't have baking soda so I used more baking powder based on an exchange ratio I found on the internet. They were not very peanut-buttery. I'm definitely kicking this out of my recipe box."
"4","5","Followed the recipe exactly, turned out great! Chilled the dough a bit to make it easier to work with."
"4","4","These came out really good. I thought they had a good flavor and was chewy in the middle and crunchy around the outside, which is my definition of a perfect cookie. I would have given it 5 stars, but had to alter the recipe, I added 1/4 cup more of crunchy PB, additional 1/4 cup more of flour, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Made these for my Dad who drove over 1600 miles to spend some time with me and PB cookies are his favorite. He loved them!!"
"4","2","I'm not sure where the good ratings come from. Most reviews I read said to add flour and peanut butter. I started out with the recipe as written. On the first sheet out of the oven, it was apparent the cookies needed more flour - a lot more flour. I added flour with each sheet, as it needed a lot more. It also doesn't have much peanut butter flavor and needs more peanut butter. Rather than adjusting this recipe, I will start with a different recipe next time."
"4","5","Amazing cookies!!! Crispy edges and chewy centers...they literally melt in your mouth! I've made these cookies a couple of times and I have to say that my favorite was making them exactly as the recipe calls! The key is to make sure to REFRIGERATE for enough time to allow the butter to cool down--without this crucial step any cookie recipe with butter will not turn out. The first time I made this recipe, I read the reviews and I took other people's advice and added 1/4 more of both peanut butter and flour but I was not so impressed with those results as it makes the cookie more bready. Will definitely be making these over and over! I make a double batch and freeze the remainder of the dough in ziploc bags and when I have company I defrost and bake...they come out as if they were freshly made. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"4","4","Made these to satisfy a peanut butter cookie craving. Definitely satisfied my craving, however, as far as peanut butter cookies go...a bit dry and bland! Needed more flavor, in my opinion. Maybe adding vanilla or cinnamon?"
"4","5","Perfect old fashioned peanut butter cookies!"
"4","5","When I made this recipe the first time, in December, it was without any changes. The cookies were just ok. I made them a couple of days ago with the extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp of vanilla. Plus only cooked for 8 minutes so they were still soft in the middle, but lightly brown on the bottom. Out of this world. Everyone that has tried them said they were perfect! :)"
"4","5","Good recipe! I made exactly as written. Next time I will add some more peanut butter as the peanut butter taste wasn't strong enough for my liking, but after chilling I had no problem with the flat cookie problem that other reviews said, did not need additional flour. Also sprinkled with sugar. BF loved them. Thanks for the post!"
"4","5","my 9 yr old dd and I made these yesterday and they were DELICIOUS. I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter, and 1/4 cup more flour, then cooked for exactly 10 mins and they were PERFECT!!"
"4","5","Really nice, the best PBCookies recipe I've made so far. Will also try with suggestions but made it as per the recipe, did not overcook, and they were great (and looked really good too!)"
"4","5","I took the advice from Natali66 and increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/2 cup. I also used 1/2 creamy peanut butter and half crunchy because I like a creamy texture. This is the best recipe I have ever used for Peanut Butter Cookies. This is a keeper."
"4","5","cookies came out GREAT!!! very versatile was able to switch out sugars with Splenda and also added a teaspoon of vanilla ;)"
"4","4","Don't add too much flour. Come out crumbly. Add a bit more peanut butter. Very P.Buttery."
"4","4","oh my ... these are SO good. the best peanut butter cookies i've had yet. however, they are super rich, so i think next time i will use half the sugar."
"4","5","Roll your balls in sugar first :)"
"4","5","I really loved making these cookies. I added a little extra flour and peanut butter too, and baked them for 8 mins and they came out golden and delicious. I love my pb cookies chewy and these were perfect!"
"4","5","This was the best PB cookie recipe I've ever come accross! I did fallow the advice of other reviews and added 1/2 cup more of both PB and Flour. I also added a dash of vanilla just because it goes against my religion to make cookies without vanilla LOL. But that's really the only changes I made. Oh! and I made one batch just putting them on the sheet. But then on the next, I rolled them into little balls and coated them with suger. Was glad I did..the result was AWESOME cookies! And they were picture perfect! I'll most likely never make them any other way again! Thanks for an awesome recipe! :)"
"4","5","excellent recipe!"
"4","5","Delicious! No need to change anything - the recipe is perfect as is. The dough was not dry, or crumbly at all. (Probably because I did not add extra flour like many are doing for some reason.) Keep in mind that if you start changing everything - as many seem to have done - it's a new recipe folks! As mentioned before, I followed the recipe to a T, they took exactly ten minutes to cook and came out crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. My entire family + all the neighborhood kids thoroughly enjoyed these."
"4","5","WOW!!!! I lowered the oven temp to 350, used bread flour instead of all purpose, added 1.5 t of vanilla... But really, those were the only changes. I baked them for about 15 minutes (lower oven temp), and made HUGE HUGE cookies. Literally, I made 24 cookies-- about 3 inches across. They are amazing!!"
"4","5","Turns out just as recipe followes. Excellent cookies. However you must soften the butter which was not included in the recipe. The cookies are great though."
"4","5","These were right on the money. When I added the Peanut Butter I added a little extra to use up my jar, maybe 1/2 a cup more. These were moist and fluffly. My husband loves them. This recipe is a 5 star recipe."
"4","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"4","5","Great peanut butter cookie recipe! I also added 1/4 cup more peanut butter, 1/4 cup more flour, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also used 1/2 cup salted butter and 1/2 cup Crisco, thus omitting the 1/2 tsp salt. The end result is a very flavorful cookie with a light and crisp outer texture while remaining moist and chewy inside. I baked at 375* for 10 mins."
"4","5","This was the best tasting cookie dough I've ever had! I couldn't find the peanut butter cookie recipe that my mom and I baked while growing up so I decided to try this one. I used creamy pb because that was all I had. The cookies turned out great! I had to cook for 11 minutes rather then 10. I rolled mine in sugar and then did the fork thing. This will definetely be my go to recipe for pb cookies."
"4","5","These were the best Peanut Butter Cookies that I have ever made. I took the advice of others and added 1/2 c more flour and 1/2 c more peanut butter and I rolled the cookies in sugar before baking them. Absolutely wonderful, we couldn't stop eating them. I will be making this again and again and again."
"4","4","I used the advice of other reviews and increased the PB and flour by a half a cup. I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tsp of vanilla flavoring. I cooked for 9-10 min. Do not over bake!! These cookies do not look done when they truly are. Very yummy"
"4","4","A somewhat dry cookie, maybe by adding more pb these will be moister."
"4","5","Excellent. I only changed two things. I used creamy pb and whole wheat flour. They were soft and moist. Husband has never given such rave reviews about anything!"
"4","4","This is a really easy recipe. I added some vanilla and extra peanut butter. I also cooked for only 8 mins because my over is very hot. They are quite moist, but I can tell will dry out quickly..if not eaten the same day! I would suggest a small piece of bread in the cookie jar. Overall, I would recommend this recipe to others."
"4","5","These are a HUGE hit, people! I decided to whip up some of these last night, and my office is currently raving over them. Because I didn't want to chill the dough before baking I opted to use margarine instead of the butter, but aside from a smidge of vanilla axtract I made no changes to the recipe. I wound up with 32 large, perfectly soft and moist cookies. This recipe is very easy to put together, and I highly recommend it!"
"4","5","Followed others advice: added 1 tsp vanilla and increased amount of peanut butter (I used an entire 15 oz jar of Skippy Natural Super Chunk). Used a small scoop to keep cookies a uniform size. Dipped fork in a small bowl of flour prior to pressing fork into cookies. Bake time 9 - 10 mins."
"4","5","Yummy!!! Took the advise from other reviews and increased the flour and peanut butter 1/4 cup each and added 1tsp of vanilla. Baked at 350 for 10-11 min. Thanks for the great recipe."
"4","5","The first ever from scratch cookie recipe I've done and this one is a hit! I have to have instructions to put water in a saucepan, but it went off without a hitch. I recommend it to any new cook. I followed hints from some reviewers (a touch more peanut butter and flour and a teaspoon of vanilla,) At 71, I'm really excited, especially with the AllRecipes site as a lifesaver for us beginners."
"4","5","These were perfect. I did make changes according to what I read in the other reviews. I add 1/2 C more Flour and Peanut Butter. 1 tsp vanilla. I rolled them in the sugar. I also used creamy PB and salted butter. With those changes they were absolutely perfect."
"4","5","These turned out great! My friend and I made them for a gift, with a few slight changes based on some of the reviews. First, We followed the 1/2 cup more of peanut butter and flour.  Additionally, we used all natural peanut butter instead of regular peanut butter- I thought the taste difference was incredible compared to my previous attempts at peanut butter cookies.  Finally, we added just a small amount (~1/2-1 teaspoon) of vanilla.   It took a little more than 9 minutes to bake perfectly, but I'll definitely be trying these again. =)"
"4","5","These are such great cookies and so easy to make. All my life my mother and I made them but they would turn so hard and crunchy that no one would want them after they cooled. These on the other hand did not and everyone is in cookie heaven! I especially loved how easily they came off the cookie sheet and how easy they were to roll. No sticky messes! I followed one readers twist of rolling them in sugar (I did it to some ginger cookies before so I trusted it.) Excellent recipe and I will use this one for now on. =)"
"4","5","Holy cow, these are the best thing since sliced bread! I am a true fan of the peanut butter cookie and have tried many recipes but this one tops them all. I made them just as instructed but used creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter (call me a purist) and they turned out wonderfully. I think I ate half of the batch myself. Additionally, I made some more another time and froze half of the dough. One month later I thawed it and baked them and they were just as good as the first time."
"4","5","this cookies were melt in my mouth good. THe extra flour and peanut butter is definitely needed to keep them from going flat"
"4","5","I not a peanut butter cookie fan but my hubby loves them. I pinched a peice off just now and I must say, these are FAB! I added a little extra Peanut butter and melted the stick of butter (it wasnt softening fast enough lol). I also rolled them in some crushed bakers semi sweet chocolate for the other half of the batch, and WOW! Definitely a keeper!"
"4","5","I am a baker in Los Angeles and I made these cookies for my customers. I did not have chuncky peanut butter so I used Laura Schudder's creamy. They were very good. Thanks for the recipe."
"4","5","Oh my gosh - these are great! I followed a few suggestions: 1 1/4 C PB, 1 overflowing tsp of vanilla & rolled top in sugar before pressing with fork. I also used margarine. I made them yesterday, and they are nearly gone today (w/in 24 hours). My Grandma-in-law, who worked in a bakery, loves them! My sister-in-law had 6 for breakfast. This is the first time I have made PB cookies and the recipe was simple; 10 min is perfect for the crisp edge and chewy center. I will be making more soon! Quick edit: Grandma asked me for the recipe because she thinks it's better than her recipe!"
"4","4","a little too crumbly to my taste, but besides that, its an AMAZING cookie recipe. i did add some chopped walnuts, they added this flavor that is so good it's undescribable. i added more peanut butter too. Great recipe!"
"4","5","Really good cookies!! Used regular butter instead of unsalted. I also used Kosher salt, which is wonderful in the cookies; gives it a little salty sweetness when you bite in since Kosher is more coarse then regular salt. It is also important to add at least a tsp of vanilla, I added a tbsp. I also rolled 2 inch balls of dough into sugar before pressing them down with a fork. 10 minutes and you're good to go. PERFECT. YUM, YUM, YUMMY!!"
"4","5","My family loves these. Moist and chewy. I did add 1/4c more peanut butter and it could have used even a tiny bit more."
"4","1","Well my cookies are in the oven right now, so I don't know how they will turn out, but I am SO unimpressed with how they were before they went in the oven. When I was putting the dough into balls i was actually able to squeeze the grease out. It is entirely unappetizing looking. I must say the dough tasted ok... this is a good recipe if you like getting greasey."
"4","5","Very good , but only bake for 7 to  7 1/2min ."
"4","5","The best peanut butter cookies EVER. They are perfect. I used salted butter and all natural peanut butter (increased the amount by about 1/4 cup) and they came out AMAZING. Peanut butter cookies are my favorite, and really good ones are hard to find. These are by far the best I've ever had."
"4","5","Really Good. I used creamy peanut butter and added in mini peanut butter cups from Trader Joes. I did not refrigerate them but dropped them on to the cookie sheet by big spoonfuls and flattened them with the back of a spoon dipped in sugar. They turned out huge and wonderful!I will definately make these again, my husband can't stop raving about them:) One thing, the batch does make a lot of cookies, I will have to make the rounds to the neighbors houses so we don't eat them all!"
"4","4","I agree with everyone else. 350 for 8 minutes is just perfect. I agree, also that there isn't enough peanut butter taste for me. Next time I am going to decrease by 1/2 stick butter and substitute Peanut Butter for that and add a bit more...They are llight and chewy if you only cook them for 8 minutes."
"4","5","This makes a wonderful cookie. I did add an extra 1/2 c. of peanut butter and 1 tsp vanilla as suggested by other reviewers."
"4","5","These were excellent. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and extra 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter. I cooked them 8 minutes. They were the best I've made."
"4","5","This were very good. I added about 1/2 cup more crunchy peanut butter based on past reviews. I would definitely add at least that again, if not more and cut down the butter about 1/4 cup."
"4","5","This is a great recipe! I added 1 c. of chocolate chips and decreased the cooking time to 8 min (the cookies would have burned at 10). Next time I make these I will increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and decrease butter to 1/2 c. Makes lots!"
"4","5","Great cookies - quick and easy. Kids love them!"
"3","5","excellent! be sure not to over bake .. i did not have crunchy and used smooth peanut butter and they were super!"
"3","5","Made these with the kids after school and they were phenomenal! I only had salted butter on hand, so I just omitted the 1/2tsp salt and they came out perfect. Once cooled, we melted some milk chocolate chips over a double boiler and dipped each cookie in it, coating them moon pie-style. They came out tasting like peanut butter cups. Delish!"
"3","5","This is a great cookie recipe. I did not want to wait...so I just put the cookies in 350 for 10 minutes...they came out perfect! I used salted butter (on hand), I still put in the 1/2 tsp of salt (thats how I make the chocolate chip cookies)and smart balance creamy not chunky (on hand). These cookies were AWESOME!!!"
"3","4","Delicous!"
"3","5","YUM! I added a bunch more peanut butter (easily twice as much) and a bag of peanut butter chips. Someone just walked by my office after taking a bite and I heard them say 'Wow. Oh, WOW!' I chilled the dough very well, and even chilled the flattened balls before baking. Baked at 350 for 13 minutes and got 4 dozen good sized cookies that are slightly crispy around the edges and soft and chewy throughout the middle. This is my new favorite pb cookie recipe, thanks!"
"3","5","Great peanut butter taste. Added 1/2 c. more flour, as well as 1/2 c. more p.b. Wonderful recipe!"
"3","4","I love these cookies! Typically I double the batch and use half butter, half crisco. I like that flavor better. Also ,they set up on the edges a bit more with the butter and that crunchy and soft combo is what a pb cookie should have (in my eyes)."
"3","5","With so many recipes out there for this cookie, it was hard to decide which one to choose. I am soooo glad I chose this one! Based on other reviews, I added 1/4 c more pb & 1/4 c more flour, baked at 350 for 10 mins. The cookies came out thick, and wonderfully chewy in the middle. My go to pb cookie recipe from now on!!"
"3","5","I made them with no changes to the recipe and they turned out great! These are not soft/chewy kind, so if that's what you prefer look for another recipe."
"3","5","I doubled the recipe so I'd have some to freeze for school lunches. As suggested, I added an extra cup of peanut butter (3 cups total) and an extra 1/2 cup of flour (3 cups total). Didn't have time to refrigerate dough. Just scooped with a small ice cream scoop and left them in balls on cookie sheet (didn't smash with fork). Turned out great!"
"3","2","Wow, I was really surprised about these cookies. I followed everything to a tee and they didn't turn out. They burnt on the bottom (used parchment paper and they still burnt...I don't get it) and the taste was too bitter. There was too much baking soda. Next time, use less baking soda."
"3","4","Great cookies! I added an extra 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup PB for extra PB flavour! Great taste and consistency.... will definitely make these again : )"
"3","5","After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar in half and they turned out just perfect. Very delicious!"
"3","5","Excellent recipe, not quite like the one I was originally looking for but they turned out great. I even made 1/2 batch of PB&J Cookies by adding 1/2 tsp. of blackberry jam in the center of half of them. Everyone loved them. Thanks!"
"3","4","I added 1/2cup more flour like others suggests My tip: for the criss-cross pattern, i dip the fork in water after each imprint (so the dough doesnt stick) My theory: After the cookies are done, i turn the oven off, open the door but leave the cookies inside to cool (keeps the cookies from going flat)"
"3","5","Delicious!"
"3","5","As a mother of a little one with peanut allergies I have really missed peanut butter cookies. Then I decided to try this recipe but instead of using peanut butter I used sunflower seed butter. I just have to say that it was such a good substitute, it tasted so similar but delicious in its own way. I highly recommend trying it!!!"
"3","4","I was looking for a soft cookie and here it is. It can however become a chewy in the center, crispy on the outside cookie though. That is not what I wanted. Make sure you make fairly large balls if you want a softer cookie. If you don't mind a crispy outside, then make them smaller. I agree with others that more peanut butter taste is also needed somehow in this recipe."
"3","5","Added about 1/2 Cup more peanut butter for extra peanut buttery goodness; did not bother to refrigerate for the hour (I was in a hurry). They turned out WONDERFULLY! Also added Reese's Pieces candies. YUM!"
"3","5","Soooo good. I also went by other's reviews and increased the flour by 1/4 cup and the peanut butter(non crunchy) by a 1/2 cup. I also did half butter half shortening. I used a 2 inch scoop and baked for 11 minutes at 375 degrees...BIG soft chewy cookies. Delish!!!"
"3","5","Love these cookies! They are just like my Mom makes."
"3","5","These turned out great and was easy enough for my 12 year old to do by himself! We followed the directions and I wouldn't change a thing.......maybe add chocolate chips next time :)"
"3","5","I've been using this recipe for over 40 years, and my mother used it before me. I believe it originally came from a Betty Crocker cookbook. The only thing different in my recipe is that it calls for 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening. They're a perfect basic peanut butter cookie. One Christmas I used a different recipe and it didn't go over well at all."
"3","5","Nothing to add or remove, it's the perfect recipe when you need classic PB cookies!"
"3","4","Instead of flatening with a fork I left them as balls and baked. The came out soft and scrumptious!"
"3","4","So I'm allergic to peanut butter and I substituted soybutter for this recipe. Honestly its pretty good. Its lacking the true peanut butter taste but its the closest thing I can have to the true thing. I added vanilla. Also Iput it in the freezer for about about 20 minutes as time was not on my side. In the oven for about 8 minutes. Flattened out a bit but was still chewy and fluffy. Good recipe."
"3","5","Wow! These turned out delicious! I followed the ingredient list exactly, and using chunky peanut butter really elevated the taste and texture. I did adjust the baking temperature down to 350 for 11 - 12 minutes baking time and also added in two generous handfuls of chocolate chips. They were the perfect mix of peanut butter and chocolate without one overpowering the other. Will definitely make again!"
"3","5","The perfect, soft chewy peanut butter cookie! I took the advice of the other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 C. peanut butter, 1/2 C. flour, and, because I'm a vanillaholic, I also added a significant amount of mexican vanilla. YUMMMMMM!"
"3","5","Very good. As others suggested, I upped the peanut butter and flour and added 1 tsp vanilla. I also dipped mine in sugar before baking. To my taste, the extra sugar makes these better. For a chewier, airier cookie, don't flatten. For a crisper, browner cookie, flatten. Overall, lighter and more delicate than store-bought peanut butter cookies."
"3","5","Delicious! I replaced the soda with additional baking powder and did not add the salt. It turned out great!"
"3","5","I Also did a little adjusting of this recipie. Just added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 C. peanut butter. No salt needed if you only have salted butter. I also roll into balls and use a potatoe masher to make a nice checkered pateren, just dont mash to hard."
"3","5","The perfect Peanut Butter cookie!"
"3","5","This recipe was so easy. I actually didn't put the eggs in (I forgot!) and only used 1/2 tsp baking powder and Baking soda. I also used creamy peanut butter, and the mix rolled so easily into balls that my 4 yr old granddaughter helped me. We made the balls a little bigger, and only got 36 cookies, but we loved them!"
"3","5","The last batch of these are in my oven right now and they are awesome! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added an extra 1/4c. flour to the recipe and they are perfect! I had a timing issue, they took a few extra minutes with my oven, but I will definately be using this recipe in the future! The perfect PB cookie! Thanks for this recipe :-)))"
"3","5","I also added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour. They came out perfect which surprised me because the baking temp seems high. They were a big hit with everyone in my family. I'm tripling or maybe even quadrupling the recipe this week to make for my sons football team. Oh, I also added a teaspoon of vanilla....yum!"
"3","5","This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe! I opted for creamy pb and added 2 t. of vanilla. I also rolled the balls in sugar before criss crossing with a fork. Delicious!"
"3","4","This is a good recipe. Ive made these a few times and always end up adding something extra. Besides adding the extra 1/4 cup of PB and flour I also added 1 tsp of butter flavor extract. So good. Also cooked at 350 for exactly 9 mins and it was perfect using my electric stove."
"3","5","Soft chewy texture and the PB taste really shines throguh. A+ cookie!"
"3","5","Lovely recipe. Not too salty or too sweet."
"3","5","I made this with 1/2 the sugar; and added 1/2 cup flour and a couple teaspoons of vanilla. I also did not have baking soda, so skipped it. They turned out great! The best so far."
"3","5","This was exactly the recipe I was looking for. The only changes I made were making them (a lot) smaller, cooking for 8 mins, and rolling them in sugar before baking. This is my go-to pb cookie recipe from now on!"
"3","5","Crispy and delicious!"
"3","4","Great recipe! The cookies came out great. I only wanted to make a small batch so I cut it in half. Worked great!! Will add this recipe to my recipe box."
"3","5","Yum! Good texture and they stayed moist. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and some extra PB too. I used them for PB&J Cookies! So delish"
"3","4","delicious cookies!!!! dried my mouth a bit but nothing a little milk didn't fix!!!"
"3","5","Very good recipe! Made for a bake sale. Dough was very soft, so I chilled overnight. Very easy and fast. Thanks!"
"3","5","This is the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe! The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of vanilla. YUMMERS!"
"3","5","I kept the ingredients the same, had to bake the cookies an extra minute. (My oven isn't really up to par on heating things well.) They were amazing! My secret? Nonstick cookie pans and parchment paper."
"3","5","Wow! I don't even usually like peanut butter cookies, but these were amazing! The instant you bite into them your head is filled with visions of rainbows and sunshine (lol)!!! After reading other reviews, I added about two tablespoon more of peanut butter. They were perfect!! For some reason, my batch made 54 cookies instead of 24.... not sure about that."
"3","4","Flavorful but cookies came out a little dry."
"3","5","I was hungry for some good home make cookies and love peanut butter so I tried this one. They came out Perfect the first time making cookies. I was eating them almost nonstop while watching the Super Bowl GO PACK GO"
"3","1","The recipe could be better. I added an extra cup of peanut butter and that made the cookies hold together better and created a cookie that had more moisture. If you use less flour than was recommended you will likely be able to avoid this process. All in all my cookies turned out pretty good with the additional peanut butter but they could have been moister with a few additional tweeks. If you are a novice baker go with a different recipe."
"3","5","excellent - soft cookies! I added nearly 3 cups flour."
"3","5","I made these cookies yesterday for my dad and he absolutely LOVED them! Per the other reviews, I added 1/2C more peanut butter, as well 1/2C more sugar. This recipe made ALOT of cookies (I used my small cookie scoop)!! Will definitely make again and again! Thank you!"
"3","5","These came out really well. I used a small cookie scoop to measure out the dough, and it made A LOT of cookies. They were delicious."
"3","5","Based off others' reviews, I added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour. These are delicious! It makes a huge batch, so I froze 1/2 of the dough for use at a later date. Perfect!"
"3","5","i was concerned that the dough was crumbly and a little hard to work with, but it turned out the best peanut butter cookies i've ever had!"
"3","5","Really the best peanut butter cookie I've had!"
"3","5","These are fabulous, especially the next day!"
"3","5","I made these cookies folling this recipe and they were amazing!!"
"3","5","Excellent recipe. Following it step by step yields some very fine peanut butter cookies."
"3","5","This is the same recipe I use and it is the same one my mom used to use also. The cookies are wonderful. I just want to mention to the person who took these to school for the children, to be sure there are no little ones allergic to nuts. That seems to be an issue with schools where I live."
"3","4","These came out fantastically well - but the cook time listed was much too long for my oven - I used my top rack and cooked for 8 minutes - they came out perfect!"
"3","4","OK, this is a pretty good recipe. Give it an A-. Issue is, unless you're feeding maybe 3 people, the portions are not sufficient. It's Christmas, and if you're like me, you make a whack of cookies. So I pretty much doubled everything (even more possibly) and added 2/3 cups more flour and 2teaspoons of vanilla extract. I didn't add any salt b/c I find PB salty already that you don't need the additional sodium to enhance the sweetness, unlike many other sweet dishes. Easy, good to make and remember to water your fork before you press down on the mixture if not it will stick. Cheers and Happy Christmas all! ;)"
"3","5","Great recipe, however I did tweak it a little bit. 2 cups of sugar is a little overkill since the PB already contains so much sugar so I used 1/2 cup of brown/granulated sugar instead and about a teaspoon of vanilla and they turned out AMAZING! I also used Smart Balance Light as a healthier alternative to butter and the cookies turned out well :)"
"3","5","I did as other's 1/4 cup more pb and flour. Yummy, i added mini chocolate chips too!"
"3","5","I added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter, baked them at 350 degrees for about 8 to 9 minutes and sprinkled sugar on them and they turned out fantastic!!"
"3","5","These are great cookies! My family has decided they are their favorite. I did follow the other reviewers notes and altered the following ingredients....to 1 1/4 cup peanut butter and 3 cups ap flour. I also added vanilla. YUMMY. Thanks for sharing a great recipe."
"3","5","I used butter flavored crisco (shortening) stick (1 cup), approx 8-10 oz REESE'S creamy peanut butter, 1.5 cups of brown sugar, .5 cup white sugar, 2 eggs, 2 1/4 cups of flour, 1.5 tsp baking soda, .5 tsp baking powder, .5 tsp salt, .5 tsp vanilla extract. roll into balls, put at least 4 chocolate chunk pieces on each cookie, bake 350 for 10.5 minutes. made appox 32 cookies. one of the best cookies i've ever made!! cookies were thick and soft! the reese's pb really puts them over the top."
"3","5","Very good cookies! The kids keep begging for them! I did change the recipe by adding the recommended extra 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup flour."
"3","5","I used half wheat/half white flour, used smooth peanut butter (added about 1/2 cup more than called for) and added a mixture of peanut butter/chocolate chips to some of them. Mine were almost done at 8 minutes, so I took them out of the oven and left them on the pan to continue baking for another minute or two. They came out very chewy. Even though peanut butter cookies are generally a more dry cookie - these came out just like I expected them to be. Thanks for the great recipe."
"3","5","I have never been able to make good cookies even though I'm a very experienced cook. Thank you so much, with your help these turned out great and I have a trusted new recipe."
"3","5","these came out absolutely perfect. not too hard but not too soft. didn't last a day at work :)"
"3","5","fabulous! i used a 1' scooper thingy and baked them for 11 minuts. perfect!"
"3","3","I followed the other advises and added more peanut butter and flour. My husband liked it but I didn't think it taste really good. It wasn't sweet enough and you can barely taste the peanut butter."
"3","5","This recipe worked great! Just a side note - to help make the dough smoother and chewier, melt the butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds first. Thank you, Shirley!"
"3","5","I recommend cooking them under 8 minutes under the same temperature. All ovens are different, but mine overcooked with 10 minutes."
"3","4","A little cakey, but I took the advise of others and added more flour. I'm going to try the original recipe next time to see if I can get a chewier cookie."
"3","5","this recipe does NOT make 24 cookies! It makes 6 dozen + 6 extra = 78 COOKIES! wow. Ended up giving half away. However, they are SUPER yummy!! Loved it. But I will cut the recipe in a third from now on ;)"
"3","5","PHENOM!! my absolute fav classic peanut butter cookie!! Only changes made was an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour to make the cookies soft and plump. If you add this you do not need to refrigerate."
"3","4","I've only made one batch so far. The night I put the ingredients together I was so excited to have peanut butter cookies that I only refrigerated the dough for 40 minutes and made them about teaspoon size, and they came out pretty flat and crispy. But after leaving the dough in my fridge for about a day or two, I made the rest of it and made them tablespoon size, and WOW.. they're soft and chewy, just how I love my peanut butter cookies. So, if you didn't read everything I just wrote. I'd say 1. colder dough = better and 2. bigger balls = better"
"3","5","perfect!"
"3","5","Wonderful followed as written...thanks for sharing."
"3","5","I made these for my 3 and 4 year old who dont really like sweets and these were perfect. I took advice of others and added 1/2 cup more of flour and P.B. I took some to my parents house and everyone ate them up and wanted the recipe. Definitely a keeper in this house!"
"3","5","My family absolutely loved these peanut putter cookies. I use this recipie every time now. I made them and took them to a staff party and everyone was asking me for the recipie! I do add a tsp. of vaniilla. I do add everything the recipie states and use real butter. I cook them for 8 minutes and take them out to cook on the pan for about 2 min. They are soft and slightly crisp on edges. So yummy! The next day a beautiful soft cookie kept in a covered container. Thank you so much for this great recipie. :)"
"3","5","These are delicious! I didn't refrigerate the dough for an hour, I just placed the cookie sheets in the freezer for a few minutes before placing the cookie dough onto the sheets. I also placed the bowl of cookie dough in the fridge as the previous batch cooked. I took some others' advice and added 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour. I rolled each cookie dough scoop in sugar and pressed down with a fork on top. I also had to set my stove to 325 because it runs hot...and I baked them for 7 minutes. Thank you!"
"3","5","Great and easy cookies to make. I needed an easy peanut butter cookie for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. I would suggest making them smaller on the cookie sheet because it tends to be softer when you make them larger."
"3","5","I followed the recipe to the letter, and they were wonderful."
"3","5","These cookies were really really unbelievable!"
"3","5","This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever! I use my medium Pampered Chef cookie scoop to get perfectly shaped cookies every time. They spread a bit upon cooking and make a large cookie also."
"3","5","this was my first time baking peanut butter cookies and they turned out to be one great cookie. every one loved them."
"3","3","I made this recipe for my husband. Peanut butter cookies are his favorite. I didn't think there was enough peanut butter in the recipe. I ended adding more and they were much better, but I think I will stick to my old peanut butter cookie recipe."
"3","5","Great and very easy recipe. Taste even better than they look and they look great. They freeze well also."
"3","4","Very easy, very nice. Big yield (we got about 50).  Definitely watch them and don't let get over done."
"3","5","Very yummy cookies. I used 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 c. of oil instead of the butter and it turned out wonderful!"
"3","5","Very good!"
"3","5","Great the way it's written. Rolling the balls in sugar makes it even better."
"3","4","Very tasty, just one note, when i made mine, they didn't look done but they were."
"3","5","I made these cookies with all white whole wheat flour and natural peanut butter, and they are great. Nice chewy-crisp texture, nice density."
"3","5","My husband begs me to make these cookies! I used regular salted butter and added 1 1/2 cups of peanut m&m's. They were great!"
"3","5","wow ! these are the best , fully deserving of the five star rating ! Unfortunately my batch did not make the full amount as stated.......I could not stop eating the batter! Great recipe! UPDATE- MADE WITH ALMOND BUTTER , GREAT BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL."
"3","5","Great tasting peanut butter cookies! I did not need to alter any of the ingredients, but did roll in sugar before baking. Definitely will use again!"
"3","5","With this recipe i added a little bit of vanilla extract to both the dry mixture and the wet ingredients and yes the batter was too thin so i added a half a cup of peanut butter but i also added chocolate chips u can add as much as you want it depends what you like in a cookie i rolled them in my hands and they came out great and everyone loved them"
"3","4","Add more sugar for crispier, meltaway type."
"3","4","Pretty tasty. Nice and soft if you don't overbake."
"3","5","Perfect! They were a great hit with everyone and were easy to make."
"3","5","Super-delicious! I didn't change a thing and they turned out spectacular!"
"3","5","This is a really good cookie recipe. The cookies stay soft for a long time. I just cant seem to make enough for the house."
"3","5","These are very good. I substituted the white sugar with brown sugar and only had creamy peanut butter on hand. As others have suggested, I did increase the peanut butter by 1/4 cup and added 1 cup of chocolate chips."
"3","5","These were great, soft and chewy, not really hard like normal peanut butter cookies."
"3","5","Great peanut butter cookie recipe. I also added 1/4 cup peanut butter and cooked them a few minutes short so they'd be more chewy inside. Perfect peanut butter cookie!"
"3","5","Oh my GOSH!!! These are the perfect peanut butter cookie! They are just like the cookies we used to make my dad and he would eat the entire batch in one sitting. I'm so glad I found this recipe. Brings back good memories."
"3","5","Mmmmmmmm, very good, just like my mom used to make."
"3","5","Ohmygosh! These are the best peanut butter cookies we've ever eaten! Make a double batch, they vanish in a wink!"
"3","5","delicious! turned out kind of flat, but they taste great and are SO chewy!!"
"3","5","These were very good, very cake like."
"3","5","I don't know if it was the PB I used, but it was not as peanutty as I would like. However, the people in the office liked it. I used salted butter and omitted the salt. In my next batch, I'd probably reduce the sugar content as well as I personally found it on the sweet side."
"3","5","Made a batch to take somewhere, and my husband and daughter kept eating them. Super easy, very tasty."
"2","5","Great recipe, nice and easy.. Followed the directions and waited till they cooled before removing them from pan...my 6 yr old was hovering over them waiting till they could be eaten.. These are now 'the best cookies I have ever made' according to him."
"2","5","Spectacularly crisp, fast and easy to make."
"2","5","Perfect for dipping in milk!"
"2","5","Great Recipe! Works with smooth peanut butter too! Can also add crushed m&m's…."
"2","5","I added a half a cup of chocolate chips. I should have added another 1/2 of cup of peanut butter because I used plain and not chunky.The cookies are light like sugar cookies."
"2","5","My husband just told me that these were the best peanut butter cookies I ever made. The only thing I did differently Was to use salted butter because that's all I had and creamy peanut butter. I rolled them in sugar and flattened them with a potato masher, makes for an interesting top."
"2","5","These cookies were perfect! We added chocolate chunks to them and I'm sure I'll be making them for years to come. I think the refrigeration is really helpful if you don't like flat cookies. Ours came out of the oven nice and plump."
"2","4","I have tried the recipe . I always add more sugar .  The cookies was a bit thin I like more of a chewy fluff like cookie but it hit the spot! Overall good cookie!!!"
"2","5","I added a teaspoon of vanilla and did them drop style, terrific!"
"2","5","42 cookies-GONE in and hour! I used half margarine/half butter (just to be more affordable). I also used 3 cups flour and 1 tsp. vanilla. I did refrigerate the dough for over an hour. The first batch came out great, 2nd and 3rd batches fell a little."
"2","5","Good, I also took the advice of some of the others and added a little more flour and peanut butter. I also added a tsp of vanilla"
"2","5","These are the only recipe I need!"
"2","1","This recipe turned out so bad that I started an account just to give it a one star review."
"2","5","I just made these and they came out great. I added tsp of vanilla and mini chocolate chips. I did not refrigerate the dough. All I did was roll into small balls and leave them instead of pressing them down. They came out great, so easy and quick to make. I baked them for 10 mins. Left them on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes for them to set then moved them to a cookie rack. No problem at all."
"2","5","These are downright dangerous. I didn't have unsalted butter, so I used salted and omitted the 1/2 tsp salt. Only baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect. (My oven runs a little warm and I like soft cookies.) No issues with thin or overlapping cookies. A welcome addition to my 'look no further' recipe book. Thank you for sharing!"
"2","4","I read some of the reviews before I started making these and noticed people were complaining about the cookie being a bit thin. So, I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more flour and a bit more peanut butter (creamy instead of crunchy). I made these yesterday and was really satisfied with the results. Definitely will be making these again!"
"2","5","My neighbor and I tried this cookie recipe for a family cookout and we absolutely loved it!! Everyone couldn't stop complementing us on this recipe I couldn't suggest it more!!!! It is 5 stars for a reason!!!!"
"2","5","Awesome Cookie, probably the best I have ever made and many people said they were the best they have ever tasted!"
"2","5","I just used the recipe for the ingredients list and forgot about the one hour refrigeration requirement. Turns out, it didn't matter. They turned out great! I only had smooth peanut butter so I added one cup chopped peanuts. Then I saw that I had some Hershey's Kisses leftover and some butterscotch chips, so I peeled and chopped the kisses and added about a cup of each (chopped kisses and bscotch chips). I used a 2TB scooper and made flat scoops onto the tray, pressed them with a fork dipped into sugar and baked them for 12 minutes in my gas oven. FANTASTIC!!"
"2","5","Perfect. As it is written, it is perfect! I always try to make a recipe as written even though I read the reviews first. This one turned out exactly as it should have, despite the problems that others seem to have encountered along the way. (Though I admit, I used crunchy peanut butter per hubby's request. ;) My suggestions to those guys are to try again! :)  My tips:  1. When you 'flatten' the dough balls, press just hard enough to make the cross hatch marks, but not so much as to completely flatten them out. They will bake up fluffy, and slightly flatten as they cool.  2. Make sure your oven is preheated to 375 degrees and the rack is in the center. If your oven is too cool, the cookies won't set fast enough, and they'll spread out and get flat.  3. DON'T over bake them! I know says that in the recipe, but I can't stress it enough. They will definitely seem underdone, but if the bottoms are brown (and maybe even the cross marks on top are slightly browned) they are done! I did 10 minutes exactly.  Thanks to Shirley for this classic perfect cookie recipe! This will be added to my company's menu for sure!!! :D"
"2","5","yummy! I added a couple Table spoons of honey, because I love the combination of peanut butter & honey. and then about 1/4 c. more flour. and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack. the cookies were crisp & perfect!"
"2","5","This was my first time making this particular cookie and it was very yummy! I read the reviews before I started baking them and I did as others recommended, I added and extra quarter cup of flour and peanut butter. I also used creamy peanut butter instead. They came out wonderfully. I also set my oven to 350, it seems happiest there and the bake time was right between 10 and 11 minutes, very good. I can say this peanut butter loving house-hold will be making these a bunch in the future. One other difference is my husband made the brown sugar, it was not store bought. Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","heres a twist some of you might like, before you flatten the dough with the fork, dip the fork in your favorite jelly ( raspberry for me ) or melted chocolate. i doubt this is an original idea but i didnt see it posted."
"2","5","Wow! I was craving peanut butter cookies and looked this up. I went through many of the reviews/comments and adapted the recipe accordingly. I've just eaten five. (Oh-oh!) These are hands-down as good as any expensive cookie at a coffeehouse but fresher! I added 1/4 cup of flour and probably a little more than 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I used Trader Joe's Organic Crunchy Peanut Butter with Sea Salt. I used salted butter which was what I had on hand--so I didn't add any salt. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of packed brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. I also added slightly chopped peanuts. I chilled the very heavy dough for one hour and baked just four cookies at first to test them. I made balls closer to 2 inches, rolled them in granulated sugar (I had never tried this before), flattened them slightly with the criss-cross of a fork, and baked them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. I moved them after about two minutes from the baking sheet to a plate to cool. They are absolutely perfect. Thanks for this recipe and to everyone who added advice and experience."
"2","5","I followed the suggestions of other people about the extra flour and Pb. Also added some chocolate chips, these were so good, got so many compliments and requests for more. Have made these about 5 times in a month!!"
"2","5","Delicious! Great combination of chewy, soft and crispy :-)"
"2","4","I read other reviewers tips and took the advice of adding 1/2 cup more peanut butter as well as an additionl 1/2 c. flour. also rolled 1' balls of dough in sugar prior to pressing with a fork. baked at 375 for 12-13 mns in my electric oven. these turned out great!"
"2","5","These turned out great, I did not alter the recipe one bit and they were perfect!!"
"2","5","It was good"
"2","5","Yummy! I also added 1/4 c flour and almost an additional cup of peanutbutter as others suggested. Everyone loved them!"
"2","5","I have made these many times and they taste wonderful, the only change I make is that I use 1 stick of margarine and 1/2 cup of butter flavored crisco instead of a cup of butter. My family beg for these ¡ALL 6 OF THEM!"
"2","5","Wonderful recipe. Dough handled well when putting on the trays, and I even added a tsp of vanilla and then mini chocolate chips as well. My 16 y/o brothers request these all the time!"
"2","5","Very good. I wouldn't change a thing."
"2","5","Awesome Cookies. I made a double batch and they only lasted 1 day."
"2","5","Added 1/4 cup flour 1/4 cup PB Bag of PB chips at the end. Barely pushed with fork, and cooked 11 minutes. Perfect!!!  I got 7 dozen toddler size cookies from this recipe."
"2","1","A really bad peanut butter cookie recipe. Not enough Peanut Butter flavor, too much flour, dry, hard. Tried several batches varying cook times. They just are not good."
"2","5","cookies came out really good!"
"2","4","Very tasty. Will use this recipe again. Only bad thing is they didn't freeze up well - crumbly."
"2","5","High Altitude adjustments (over 6,000 ft). I increased the peanut butter by a HEAPING 1/4 cup (it could have been closer to 1/2 cup). I used High Altitude Hungarian Flour and increased by 5 tbls. I reduced Baking Powder to 3/4 tsp and decreased Baking Soda to 1 tsp. I found that I had to bake these at 375 degrees for 9 minutes. I brought them into my gift store as a customer snack....I am now on my THIRD batch! My yield was also better thn advertised...perhaps my cookies were a tad bit smaller but I managed 52 cookies."
"2","5","This is a great recipe :) Very easy to make and did not change a thing. I will continue to enjoy this recipe!"
"2","5","DELICIOUS!!!"
"2","5","This recipe is easy and delicious! I replaced the crunchy peanut butter with whipped peanut butter and the cookies came out light and perfect!"
"2","4","This was a great and simple enough snack to prepare for a group meeting I attend every so often. I did make one adjustment. I added raisins which add a nice chewy contrast to any chunks of peanut that may not have fully melted during the baking process."
"2","5","Quick and easy peanut butter cookies. I was too impatient to let them refrigerate for a full hour - I put the dough in the fridge for about 20 minutes, then started baking, leaving the dough in the fridge between batches. I did add about 1/4 cup extra flour and some vanilla extract as was recommended by a number of reviewers. I baked them at 375 for about 8 minutes so they were nice and chewy. I left them on the cookie tray to cool for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack - otherwise they were a bit too soft. I also made half the batch with chocolate chips (they still needed to be flattened with a fork). I brought these to work and they were gone before lunch!"
"2","5","My 7yr old and friends love these cookies!!!"
"2","5","I looked this up on my phone as a reference while I was in the grocery store. I ended up following it as is, and it was even better than the recipe that I usually use. NO CHANGES NEEDED. Well.... I did add some chocolate chips to the ones for my wife."
"2","5","if your looking for an easier and yummy way of making a peanut butter cookie... try this.... 1 cup of peanut butter, 1 cup of sugar and 1 egg.. mix it all up form about a dozen balls and press the fork cross ways on each ball then bake and 400 for about 10 minutes... simple and delicious!!!!"
"2","5","This has been my p.b. recipe for years, with the exception of baking powder! I'll try adding it to my cookie dough recipe the next time I make these. I no longer roll the batter into balls. Instead, I use a cookie scoop and leave the dough as is when it's dropped on the cookie sheet. I get a cookie that spreads a bit and makes for a great chewy on the inside with crisp edges on the outside. I could make these cookies every week and have a happy husband. He absolutely loves them!  Prep Tip: Never, ever microwave the butter to soften it! If it is too soft, it will change the entire recipe and you'll end up with cookie batter you could wring out! Thirty minutes on the kitchen counter will soften the butter enough to work with in your electric mixer. Also, if you want to ensure the cookie dough is the right consistency for baking, take a bit of the dough and roll it in your hands. If the dough doesn't stick to your hands, it's good to bake!!! If it is a bit sticky, just add a little bit of flour, maybe a 1/4 cup at a time, until you have the right consistency for baking. This is something I do frequently because I don't measure the peanut butter so if I've added too much, I'll need to add more flour at the end."
"2","5","What a great recipe!! I followed it to the T but added a cup of chocolate chips. Mmm my boyfriend is gonna love these!!"
"2","5","OUTSTANDING!! I make these cookies for the house and to send to my two nephews stationed overseas. They're a HUGE hit!   I only cook the cookies for 8 minutes though, to keep the insides particularly moist and chewy. I get 5 stars from everyone who's tasted them."
"2","4","These cookies are wonderful!"
"2","5","AWesome cookies. I double the batch make half just Peanut butter and the other half with choc chips...I do refrigerate the dough overnight however. If in a need to do sooner I stick the dough in the freezer for awhile...Five stars from me!"
"2","3","The flavor was VERY good and they aren't dry at all, but they are way too crumbly."
"2","5","These are the easiest peanut butter cookie recipe I've ever made, and they are absolutely perfect. My 7 year old said 'Momma, I wish i could just keep on eating these cookies, cause they are delish!'"
"2","5","These cookies are sooooo yummy! I made them with my friends. Super simple, super delicious!"
"2","5","I used Almond butter instead of peanut butter, tripled the batch minus 1 Cup of butter and the recipe was perfect. nice firm dough that did not need to be refrigerated before baking. Love them!"
"2","5","I don't think I've ever had such a tasty PB cookie. Not even the ones I've purchased from cookie shops."
"2","5","Delicious! I was looking for something simple to bake with the ingredients I had. This was the perfect recipe! Chewy and creamy! Great recipe."
"2","4","Yummy! Easy!"
"2","5","Fantastic Cookies !"
"2","3","just as a peanut butter cookie should be, be careful not to over cook, I like mine a little crispy on the edges and with a chewy peanut buttery middle."
"2","5","The title says it all yummy classic peanut butter cookies."
"2","5","Thumbs up from all 3 kids! I was out of all-purpose flour so I used self rising (deleting salt, baking powder, and baking soda). I also followed some others modifications and added another 1/4 cup of peanut butter. They turned out just fine.  I made the cookies again and used all purpose flour and did not add any extra peanut butter, and they were delicious!"
"2","5","A perfect classic cookie. Made as is, and they are just what i was looking for tonight."
"2","5","This recipe rocks. I followed someone else's alteration of making it 1 1/2 cups Peanut Butter and adding 1/4 cup extra of Flour. Also just eyed in some Vanilla extract. They turned out fluffy and golden and AWESOME! I also rolled half of the ball in sugar and with that side up made the little criss cross pattern. They're amazing. :D"
"2","5","Like the title says this is a classic cookie recipe. I am not a fan of peanut butter myself but I love a good peanut butter cookie and theses are really yummy. I didn't have unsalted butter so I used my lightly salted sweet cream butter and smooth peanut butter. I could eat a whole batch myself."
"2","5","i made these billions of times and i just love them"
"2","5","These are my boyfriend's all time favourite cookies. I only make 1/2 batch at a time as he will eat as many as I make..."
"2","5","wonderful recipe! these turned out perfect! I read other reviews and wanted to make sure they didn't spread out, so added a small (3.5 oz) pkg of vanilla pudding mix, also I only had creamy peanut butter and wanted some texture so I ground up about 1/3 cup extra whole peanuts in my food processor and added it into the mix at the end. Perfection!!! :-)"
"2","5","I like my cookies a little more chewy so I only used 3/4 cup of butter. But otherwise followed the recipe exactly...and this is a great recipe! One that I will be using many more times...and will recommend to anyone :)"
"2","5","I was never a big peanut butter cookie fan until i made these. I like to consider myself somewhat an expert on baking ;)  I did change the recipe like most: added 1 tsp vanilla extra 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter extra 1/4 cup flour -perfecto! yum yum! baked for 8 minutes, used a cookie scoop, made about 36 cookies!"
"2","5","Best Peanut Butter cookies ever!"
"2","5","Really easy to make. As the reviews suggested I added half a cup extra peanut butter, and flour...plus vanilla."
"2","4","These were really good, though, not that much better than any other pb cookie."
"2","5","Just like the title says, these are your classic peanut butter cookies. Exactly how you would expect them to be. I used all-natural peanut butter and increased the amount a little (maybe 1.5 cups) Because, I think, the natural peanut butter is quite stiff, I had no problem at all with too-thin cookies. And this recipe makes TONS! Mine baked for 8 minutes."
"2","5","This cookie has make the top of my list (and I'm not even that big of fan of PB cookies!) I made a few adjustments, mostly because I realized a little too late I didn't have enough of 2 ingredients.  Per suggestion of other reviewers, I added extra 1/4 Cup flour. Also, I only had 1/4 C brown sugar so rest is Brown Sugar Splenda blend (you really can't tell) and had a little bit of Peanut Butter with Honey (made by Skippy) so used that as my 'extra' peanut butter. Apparently, I made them TOO small as I got almost 10 dozen from doubled batch. And mine took about 10-12 minutes."
"2","5","These are great cookies. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/4 cup additional flour and also peanut butter, rolled in sugar and threw in a couple of handfuls of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Baked at 350 for approx. 8 minutes. They were soft and very tasty. I will make them again and again!"
"2","4","1/2 cup flour & pb + 1 tsp vanilla @ 350 for ten mins = perfect!"
"2","5","This is a very quick and easy recipe to make, and the cookies are great. I cut the recipe in half and got four dozen cookies, and I was generous in how much peanut butter I used."
"2","5","Very good! I also did not chill my dough. It rolled into balls with no problem."
"2","4","Quite yummy. I've made PB cookies before with the very basic recipe on the PB jar and they tasted like a mouthful of PB... these, on the other hand, tasted like COOKIES. Definitely making them again. :)"
"2","5","This is a keeper! Like others suggested I added an additional 1/2 c flour and 1/2c peanut butter. Baked for exactly 8 min. I halved the recipe which yielded 24 cookies. The all recipes servings says 24 but the orecipe is for 48 cookies."
"2","3","These taste really good, but are very crumbly. You don't have to chew them they break into crumbs in your mouth. Too dry. I like a more chewy pb cookie."
"2","5","My favorite pb cookie recipe to date. Thanks for adding this! Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy and gooey on the inside."
"2","5","loved it turned down to 350 for 12 minutes.. i too addd a little more flour and even about 1/4th cup oatmeal...."
"2","5","good"
"2","5","delicious. Changed heat to 350 degrees F as first batch were too brown on the bottom. Added 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup peanut butter in addition to recipe."
"2","3","Maybe I was expecting too much or did something wrong but these didn't come out the way I imagined. I used creamy peanut butter instead of the crunchy so maybe it was missing that element..."
"2","4","After reading several reviews I also made the followig changes: I added an additional 1/4cup flour, 1/4 cup peanut butter, and 1tsp vanilla. I did not press with a fork. I used my ookie baler, and when done baking, 350 for 9 min, I topped each cookie with a chocolate kiss. They were wonderful! They were moist, and done to perfection. Would've rated a 5 if no changes wer required."
"2","4","These were very soft and chewy! Though I didnt refrigerate dough!"
"2","3","The cookies came out pretty soft with a nice shape & consistency. They were less sweet than I'd like and a bit less flavorful. I followed the modifications Denielle2 suggested with additional PB & flour, as well as changing the cooking temp & time."
"2","5","YUM!!! Made twice. Once with no changes other than used salted butter and omitted the salt. And the second time I swapped a cup of flour for a cup of oatmeal. Both times, amazing! The oatmeal made them a bit crispier/crunchier which I preferred, but both ways were totally tasty. (note that I did use natural peanut butter, the kind that is made of peanuts only, not the processed sugar added hydrogenated kind)"
"2","5","best PB cookie ever. Definitely undercook them, makes them lighter, fluffier...I added a bit of PB and flour (1/4 cup) like suggested"
"2","5","These were delicious! Very simple. Light and crispy."
"2","5","Great recipe. My cookies got rave reviews."
"2","4","great cookies! I added white chocolate chips and a tsp. of vanilla - everyone loved them"
"2","5","wow this cookie is awsome //// and i am a self proclaimed peanut butter cookie expert /// thanks yall"
"2","5","Just made my first batch of these. I made a few alterations to the recipe based on reader reviews and personal taste- I used an additional 1/4 cup of flour, used smooth peanut butter rather than crunchy, and added half a bag of peanut butter chips. They came out great, and the recipe yielded approx. 30 small-medium size cookies. Thanks Shirley!"
"2","5","Very nice. I had them in 'frig for several hours before making which made it easy to handld. Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","When I first found this recipes, I noticed that a lot of people had altered it, but I decided to give it a chance and see how it would turn out as-is. Rather than changing the ingredients I just refrigerated it overnight instead of for an hour. The cookies were perfect! They are also good if you roll your dough in sugar before baking."
"2","5","I have used this recipe numerous times and I love it!!! The only thing I would do to chnage it is to add a bit of vanilla! :)"
"2","5","perfect, as is. No changes needed to this recipe. I am going to make them again and use them for ice cream sandwiches."
"2","5","I made this recipe with extra peanut butter, and extra flour. After that, I made the recipe as posted here. This recipe makes great cookies, with no need to change any further. Plenty of my family like these cookies, they don't last very long. This is a great way to use up the extra peanut butter. Eight minutes, and these cookies come out OK. Careful not to overbake!"
"2","5","These are the best cookies I have ever made. I found these on allrecipies a while ago and i have made them ever since. You will be amazed."
"2","5","This is very similar to my Dad's recipe. I tried both and actually like this one better. Sorry Dad!!"
"2","5","Wonderful cookies, my grandaughter loves them. I added 3 tablespoons of honey to the recipe and took out 1/4 cup of the white sugar - Just an old baking habit - I think it helps the cookies stay moist. Thanks for a good basic, no fail cookie."
"2","5","Yum! Excellent cookies. Thank you!"
"2","5","Absolutely fantastic and I don't normally agree with the ratings but these are definitely top notch. I made them for my husbands platoon (he's in the Army) and the guys were begging for more. GREAT recipe!"
"2","5","Perfect!"
"2","4","This was a very good cookie. However, I did find them a bit too thin and crunchy. Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers to get the consistancy (chewyness) I prefer."
"2","5","these are the best pb cookies ever! I've been looking for a recipe that makes nice and soft pb cookies and this is it! I think next time I will add a little more pb though."
"2","5","I decided to try this recipe the other day when I suddenly was in the mood for peanut butter cookies. Since I was by myself and would be for a few days, I halved the recipe. I made a few substitutions: One, I used all natural creamy peanut butter instead of the chunky peanut butter called for in the recipe; two, I used whole wheat flour; and three, I used kosher salt. The cookies came out so soft and were so delicious! I swear those were the best peanut butter cookies I ever had, and I'm not just saying that because I baked them!"
"2","5","The first time I made these, I didn't refrigerate them. Huge mistake. The second time, they were superb. I didn't have chunky PB when I made either batch and they were delicious. Next time I will make the cookies with chunky PB...if I get the PB before I get the craving."
"2","5","I usually do not like peanut butter cookies. But I make this ones for my family. They came our very yummy and light ( which is weird being that the ingredients are no light at all). So I really like them. I try one and two and tree and now my diet is for next week :) I did change it a little bit because i did not have all the ingredients on hand. I added 1 stick ( 1/2 cup) butter and half stick margarine. 2 cups white sugar and 1/2 tbs molasses ( no give the flavor of brown sugar). Everything else remains the same. I got 3 1/2 doz and they where pretty good size."
"2","5","I followed others' recommendations of increasing the flour to 1-1/2 and the peanut butter to 1-1/4. Excellent cookies!"
"2","5","Made as others instructed. Added 1/2 cup extra flour and peanut butter. Also, added vanilla. They are super yummy!"
"2","5","Pretty good as far as PB Cookies go, I added raw sugar on top to the second batch that went into the oven. Tip, Dip 1/2 of your cookie in melted chocolate almond bark and place on parchment paper to harden then you have a chocolate PB Cookie. Irresistable!!"
"2","5","extra yummy"
"2","5","wonderful recipe. the finished cookie was the best! we recommend only cooking for 8 min to keep them soft."
"2","5","These cookies were fabulous. I did not bake them all at once. Instead I baked half the batch, and prepped and refrigerated cookie dough balls for the second half, baking them 3 days later. The 2nd half came out just as great as the 1st half. The dough keeps well in the refrigerator."
"2","2","Would try adding 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla next time. Also bake at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes. Not my favorite - all right"
"2","3","these turned out okay. I didnt like how cakey they were. I think I liked the batter more than the cookies."
"2","5","The cookies were wonderful! My husband loves them and he can be picky. Followed the suggestion of adding extra PB and flour! Great!"
"2","5","I absolutely love this recipe! It is so simple and easy and also very, very yummy! Everyone I bake these for just LOVE these cookies. What also helped was to take from some of the suggestions made in the reviews with more peanut butter and flour that really made these the award-winning. Will be the peanut butter cookie recipe that I take with me for years to come."
"2","4","my husband ate 10 after coming home from work the day i made them."
"2","5","I am not a big peanut butter cookie fan and had never made them before, but my husband asked me to make him some. I first tried a flourless peanut butter cookie recipe and they were awful! I tried this recipe next and what a difference! I sub'd creamy PB for the crunchy, added an extra 1/4 c of PB and 1/4 c of quinoa flour I had in the pantry in addition to the all-purpose flour and a tsp of vanilla extract. They came out perfect! Not too soft and not too crispy. They came out pretty big and made more than the recipe said they'd make. This recipe made me a fan of PB cookies!"
"2","5","I made these cookies last night and they were yummy! I added an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and rolled them in sugar. Thanks for the recipe Shirley!"
"2","5","These were great cookies, but i took the advice and added flour and they came out fluffy and tasted great!"
"2","4","Great texture, but not terribly peanutty. Might benefit from the addition of some ground peanuts."
"2","5","I made a double batch and froze the extra dough. Now when I want a few I just scoop it out and cook it up."
"2","4","I also added 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup peanut butter, also a bit of nutmeg. Warm out of the oven, very good! Oh, also added a scoop or so of chocolate chips."
"2","5","These were the DANKEST peanut butter cookies Ive ever made! I added 1\2 teaspoon of vanilla to this recipe. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has a sweet tooth for peanut butter cookies."
"2","5","FABULOUS!!! I added 1/2 cup more (creamy-store brand) peanut butter and 1 cup peanut butter chips. I made my cookie balls a little larger than suggested and they turned out wonderfully at 375 degrees, 12 min. Great tip: Roll the cookie balls in white sugar for even better presentation! Try this recipe!"
"2","4","I had a mad craving for something sweet tonight but i didn't have any oil to bake any of the items i want. I came across this and thought i'd try it since i had all the ingredients. It was very yummy. I followed what others said and added 1/2 cup more each of PB and flour and added some vanilla. My 4 year old is on his 3rd cookie right now. I did however was hoping that they would be more chewy then crumbly in texture but the flavor is really nice and the more i ate the more i like it :) Would definitely remake again."
"2","5","I was going to make the 3-ingredient peanut butter cookie (1c pb, 1 egg, 1c sugar) but I decided to venture out. This was excellent. My daughter and I got in there togeter and rolled out the balls and pressed them down on the pan. Everytime I make this delicious cookie I will remember the time I spent with her making them. They were not to thin, nor were they crumbly. They were a perfect balance of moist and dry; which, made them a little chewy. You can take the same recipe and pass it around and everyone can get different results. I dod not alter this recipe and it was perfect."
"2","5","Didn't have unsalted butter so used sweet cream butter and no salt. This will be the recipe that I will use for peanut butter cookies from now on. My grandkids love them."
"2","5","Awesome. I added a little more peanut butter and flour in addition to a teaspoon of vanilla. I made half the amount which ended up being 2 dozen - my husband and I ate so many that I had to take the leftovers to work the next day to keep us from getting fat! Everyone at work like them, too :-) I think next time I'll throw in 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts like my grandma used to do."
"2","5","great cookie recipe. I followed the other suggestions and added another 1/2 cup flour and peanut butter. i baked at 350 for 10 min. The cookies on my dark non-stick pan browned nicely. I would turn the heat to 375 for my light aluminum pan as those were still not brown after 10 min. I also rolled the dough in sugar before baking and everyone said they liked that touch. I don't care for peanut butter cookies but ended up eating a bunch because they tasted great! Awesome recipe!!!"
"2","5","Great cookies, but a little too greasy the first time I made them. I reduced the butter by 1/2 and the white sugar by 1/4 Cup and instead sprinkled the sugar on top of the cookie before baking. I also used this recipe to put chocolate kisses on top. I took them out of the oven when they almost seemed underdone and then after they cooled a bit, they were perfect."
"2","5","Great!! I used more flour and peanut butter as some other reviewers suggested. I took it to a church youth activity, everyone loved it!! I would say that if you add extra flour, add equal amounts of extra PB, otherwise it gets crumbly and hard to roll into cookies."
"2","5","These cookies + milk = Pure goodness!!"
"2","5","I made them just how the recipe states and left them in fridge so I could make 6 every couple of days. They were great and lasted well!"
"2","5","These cookies are awesome! I like the texture of them. I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. After making the criss-cross deign, I sprinkled sugar on them."
"2","4","These cookies were wonderful! I absolutely loved them! And a tasty hint, add 2 cups of chocolate chips for an extra burst of yummy goodness. :)"
"2","5","I made this for an end of year party for high schoolers--- I received so many compliments! My friend that loves peanut butter also loved them- I also added 1/2c more of flour and 1/2c more of peanut butter, these were just perfect, not too thin either."
"2","4","These cookies were great. A little on the dry side when rolling into balls but very moist when cooked. I over cooked my first batch, my oven is a little on the hotter side. So, watch the timing."
"2","5","Simply delicious!! This is the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe...Per other reviwers I did use 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter and increased the four by 1/4 cup. Very good and this will be my new peanut butter cookie recipe."
"2","5","This is a great cookie, I added 1 tea vanilla and cut the flour in half with oatmeal, not quick cook oats ,that I ran thur the food processor to get it like flour , also added 1 cup chocolate chip semi sweet.....375 at 10 mins was perfect."
"2","5","Its faster if you use a meat pulverizer instead of a fork and the cookies look really professional after cooking. Its also a good stress reducer, just don't hit the dough too hard."
"2","4","Per a previous review I added an extra 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1/4 c. flour. It tasted excellent, but it really spread out quite a bit. Next time I'll only add 1/4 cup extra PB, but I'll leave everything else the same. I used half natural style PB and half regular PB (I was trying to use up what I had on hand), and it came out great. With the additional PB & flour this recipe makes more like 32 cookies, rather than the 24 stated."
"2","5","I've been looking for a great peanut butter cookies recipe for many years. I like butter in my recipes and so just couldn't find the right one. This is it! The cookies were thick, soft, and yummy. I did add the extra 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour, as some reviewers suggested, and they were beautiful. My family ate them all!"
"2","4","These were very good. I made a few changes, after reading some of the reviews. I used 1 1/2 cups smooth peanut butter and added an extra 1/4 cup flour. I used a fork to make a criss-cross pattern on top of the cookies and I baked them at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. With these changes they turned out great."
"2","5","I added 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour. I used creamy peanut butter and regular butter, so I left out the salt. Cooked for 7 minutes."
"2","5","I found this recipe to be awesome! The dough was perfect and the baking time was perfect. They came out very soft and chewy. I have had great reviews on these cookies and many requests to make more. I had absolutely no crumbling and no 'flour taste'. This will be placed in my permanent recipe file!"
"2","5","The first time I attempted to make (sugar) cookies they came out horrible! LOL But this recipe looked simple so I decided to give it another shot. After reading several reviews, I added an extra 1/4 c. of flour & PB & 1 tsp vanilla. The cookies came out yummy & my hubby loved them! Thanks for the great recipe :)"
"2","5","These are my make-up cookies to my husband because I yelled at him last night.:)"
"2","5","I love this recipe but I had to substitute some things as my daughter is anaphylactic to eggs and nuts. So for those of you w/ allergies try this: Instead of peanut butter, use Soybutter or Sunbutter; instead of eggs, use EnerG egg replacer; and if your little one is allergic to milk use a butter substitute; and if your little one is allergic to wheat, use gluten free flour. Hopes this helps. :) Also, I added more flour and soybutter as suggestions from others. Thanks for a great recipe."
"2","5","I made a half batch of these with about 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and also used mostly that Omega 3 super healthy peanut butter. With most cookies make sure you undercook this babies just a little bit. They definitely keep that melt in your mouth effect the next day, even if they're not straight out of the oven."
"2","5","Fantastic! I added a 1/2c creamy peanut butter and an additional 1/2c flour and these could not be more perfect. I didn't even chill the dough and these were downright fantastic!"
"2","5","This recipe is great! I'm giving it five stars because I estimated the quantities, forgot to add the eggs until the last minute, didn't have any brown sugar or baking powder, and then baked them in an oven with no temperature controls, and they still turned out perfectly. You really can't go wrong.  Next time I might add chocolate chips though. :)"
"2","5","I don't think I have had a peanutbutter cookie in over 10 years. Not that I don't like them, I just usually choose chocolate when I have a choice. But the other day I had a hankering for an old fashioned peanut butter cookie like my grandma used to make. This recipe fits that bill exactly. My only change was that I used all natural creamy peanut butter. These were soft, and perfectly flavored. I only baked a few the first batch and left the dough in the fridge. Worked perfectly all week to bake just what I wanted and have fresh cookies every day."
"2","5","My 14 yr old daughter made these by herself, using the suggested hints (extra pb and flour) and they are PERFECT! Thanks for sharing this!"
"2","5","Added smashed up Reeces pieces to this recipe, cake out with 48 cookies which were eaten within 4 hours!!!!!!!!! Excellent recipe, easy to follow, thanks :O)"
"2","5","I thought these were great, and easy to make for my first p.butter cookie. I'll probably add a little more peanut butter next time, like others suggested."
"2","5","I ended up with excellent cookies! My whole family loves these! I put Hershey Kisses on top for a little extra fun and they were devoured!!"
"2","3","I gave this recipe three stars because I did make some changes. I made these with half organic, unsalted butter and half I Can't Believe It's Not Butter; I also reduced the brown sugar by 1/4C and replaced the regular sugar with half raw sugar and half Splenda; and I doubled the amount of peanut butter in the recipe. I might add a little vanilla next time, as well, but with the changes I made I felt that the flavors were perfect! These cookies are soft and fluffy, but with just enough crunch around the edges. I baked them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees in my convection oven."
"2","5","This recipe is awesome! I took other reviewers advice and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it up a little and added 1 tsp of vanilla for a little extra flavor. I used creamy peanut butter since we didn't have chunky on hand. I made some by rolling them in granulated sugar (another reviewer's suggestion) before putting them on the cookie sheet and I made some without the sugar to compare the two. The cookies rolled in sugar are much better! I guess sugar makes everything better. :)"
"2","4","I found this recipe to be quite good. Leave the sugar like it is but cut out some of the flour or else the batter gets too crumbly. I did add in some extra peanut butter and they turned out beautifully."
"2","5","These cookies are 'yum yum yum delicioso!' The cookies were crunchy and chewy at the same time! My family loves them!"
"2","5","Great basic recipe. I did a few changes myself which made it wonderful. I started with melting the butter. I increased the flour 1/2 a cup. Added Vanilla extract.. 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. Added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I also added 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips (yes you can press them with a fork when they have the chips added) and baked them for about 9 minutes."
"2","3","Although the cookies baked up nicely, they didn't taste much like peanut butter. I like The Joy of Cooking recipe better. It makes a denser, more 'peanuty' cookie."
"2","4","I think this needs just a little more peanut flavor to rate a 5 for me. It's very good but I can taste too much butter for my taste next time I'll use about 1 1/2 c of peanut butter. This time I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 3 cups flour, no baking powder but increase baking soda to 2 tsps. and used 1 1/4 c peanut butter. These were initially 'fluffy looking' but as they cooled flattened right out and ended up a slightly crispy cookie. Very good, it's a keeper."
"2","4","I should have looked at the photo. I was hoping for the cute litte PB cookies that keep their fork marks. I spread this recipe out onto 2 cookie sheets - what a mistake. They spread more than any cookie I've ever seen. I started with one inch balls flattend slightly, and ended up with 2 giant sheets of 1/4 inch thick cookie that I had to slice into squares. Absolutely could not tell they started off as circles or that they had cute fork marks I lovingly made in designs. They did taste good though - wickedly sweet."
"2","4","I give this 4 stars as-is, but with the addition of 1 tbs. vanilla and 1 cup of peanut butter chips, this recipe is perfect! I also only cooked for about 8 minutes rather than 10."
"2","5","I am so excited! I just made my first ever batch of homemade cookies! I used this recipe. These cookies were amazing! Hint for those that aren’t used to making cookies from scratch, especially peanut butter cookies. When all finished, the dough looks really dry and doesn’t seem to clump very well (I added ½ cup more flour and peanut butter also), but that is how homemade peanut butter dough is supposed to look! I almost threw it out…or I’ll admit… thought I had to eat all of the dough (which is very yummy by the way, yes… I know not very unadvisable because of the eggs). I am very pleased! These tasted better than most of the other peanut butter cookies I’ve tried, and I am just a novice chief. Thank you!"
"2","5","There are NOT words!!! Wow. I am making cookies for a friends wedding actually and I have NEVER, no NEVER had success with peanut butter cookies. BUT that has definitely changed. I used a full 16 oz. jar of creamy JIF peanut butter, 3 sticks of butter, 1 1/2 cups of each sugar,(plus a tsp or so of molasses as I ran short of the brown sugar by a bit). 3 eggs, and 1 tsp vanilla. Then i did a full 4 cups of flour. Basically I time and a halved the recipe with a couple small additions. No need to refrigerate. 8 minutes at 350. WOW!! Oh, and a hint. I used the bottom of a plastic potato masher/ricer for perfect criss-cross pattern. And I rolled them in sugar. Perfect."
"2","5","Deeeelicious!!! I doubled the recipe because I wanted to give some to friends and wow did I get alot of cookies. We have cookies coming out of our ears!!!"
"2","5","Hubby and son agree these are fantastic peanut butter cookies. I doubled the recipe and used an extra half cup of flour total, and I used an entire 18oz jar of crunchy peanut butter total. This made just a little over 12 dozen decent sized cookies! I let the dough sit for about 15 minutes in fridge before forming balls. Cooked 12 at a time on parchment paper for 9 minutes per tray at 350 degrees. Done perfectly in my oven this way (mine tends to run a little warm)."
"2","5","These cookies are great! Even after a week, each cookie still tasted like it was fresh out of the oven!"
"2","5","Awesome cookies! First batch of cookie recipes from this site that didn't turn out horrible! I did some editing tho.. changed the oven settings to 350F for 10 minutes.. came our delicious! Also used splenda instead of sugar. Awesome recipe!"
"2","5","I'm the 290th person to rate this cookie and I'll continue to give it 5 stars. Only thing wrong with the recipe is I should have doubled it to begin with!!!"
"2","2","The only variation I made on this recipe was to add a little vanilla and Reese's pieces. Not a great recipe. Will not make it again."
"2","4","DON'T bake at 375!!! Maybe my oven is just hotter but at 375 my cookies were too crispy and I only baked them for 7 mins!!! I'm going to have to play around with this recipe..."
"2","4","I saw the tips from other people to add more flour and peanut butter. I made half the recipe and added 1/8 cup peanut butter, but accidentally added too much flour (1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup). So when I formed the cookies they were too crumbly... Don't make that mistake! Cookies turned out really yuummy but a little crispy. Next time I think I will just try to follow the recipe (and add a bit of vanilla extract still). The only other problem I had was that I made half the recipe, expecting to have 12 cookies. I came out with 36 cookies! The proportions are incorrect. Otherwise these cookies had a wonderfully nutty and completely peanut buttery flavor."
"2","5","These were really good - reminded me of what my mom used to make! I did make some changes: I made them vegan, using egg substitute for the egg. I also had bought a jar of sunflower butter, which I love, but this time I had accidentally bought the unsalted, unsweetened kind, which really isn't so good for eating straight up. So I was looking for a way to use it up in a delicious way. I used about 2 1/4 c. sunflower butter (the rest of my can) and about 1/4 c. almond butter. I also upped the flour to 3 cups, as others suggested, but used whole wheat pastry flour. The cookies came out perfect, light and buttery. I will be making these again, probably with almond and sunflower butters again, but I will decrease the amount of shortening/butter/margarine to about 3/4 c. or even 1/2 c. They were just a little on the greasy side for my taste. Everyone at the potluck loved them though - said they tasted just like peanut butter cookies!"
"2","5","I made the recipe pretty much as stated except I used salted butter and creamy peanut butter. All amounts and other ingredients were kept the same. I baked for 9 minutes at 375 degrees and they came out perfect. Very good flavor for a peanut butter cookie, in my opinion. I will put this recipe into my permanent stash."
"2","5","Very tasty! I added 1/2 c flour and 1/4 peanut butter extra like others suggested, and they turned out perfect! I used reduced fat peanut butter and you couldn't even tell. I would definatley make these again!!"
"2","5","very easy recipe and delicious! I made them into peanut blossoms (added a Hershey kiss in the middle when the cookie was done baking)"
"2","5","These are great peanut butter cookies...I only baked mine about 7 minutes then left them on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes to finish cooking. I froze about half the dough per another reviewers advice, so hopefully they turn out as well the second time around. Thanks for a keeper :)"
"2","5","Followed to a T and they turned out perfect! Mmm!"
"2","4","I used 1 and 1/4 c. peanut butter and salted butter; I decreased the salt to 1/4 t. and used kosher salt. Even so, these were too salty. I strongly suggest using unslated butter if possible, and, if using salted, I wouldn't use any extra salt. Also, don't overbake these - 10 minutes is just long enough; they finish baking on the cookie sheet, and if you overbake, they will be dry and too crispy. These are much better the second day; they were a little crumby right after they cooled. Overall, these are good cookies, easy to bake and quite tasty."
"2","4","I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of peanut butter as well as a teaspoon of vanilla. My husband likes crunchier cookies so we stuck with the 375 degree temperature and a slightly longer cooking time."
"2","5","I'm in love with this recipe! These cookies turned out perfect. My mom is allergic to peanuts, so I made them with soy nut butter. They're completely yummy! I almost wanna wake her up to get her to try one now. They're that awesome. But I'll wait until tomorrow. Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe.  **Update: I made these with peanut butter finally! They were every bit as amazing as I thought they'd be. I took them to my boyfriend's house the first time I met his family, and they loved both the cookies and me! They all said the recipe is a definite keeper."
"2","5","I am updating this review slightly - as previous reviewers suggested, I am still adding 1 teas vanilla, and additional peanut butter and sugars to my batter. I also reduced the salt, but I used salted butter. And definitely roll the balls in sugar. I am now using 1/4 cup LESS flour because I like flatter cookies and I recently learned that more flour makes puffier cookies. I also want to mention that I use Smucker's natural creamy peanut butter, so I have added a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil depending on the state of my PB. I still luv these cookies, the batter is super tasty too!"
"2","5","This is the perfect peanut butter cookie!"
"2","5","These were the BEST peanut butter cookies I have ever had! The only changes we made were to use regular salted butter, 1 1/4 cup peanut butter, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Holy cow!!"
"2","5","these are the best peanut butter cookies! i did a few revisions, and they came out perfect. i added 2 cups of peanut butter and 2 cups white sugar, and only had one egg. if you are looking for more peanut butter taste, just keep adding peanut butter by the 1/4 cup and do some taste testing until it's to your liking. will definitely use this for a base recipe again!"
"2","5","This is the best peanut butter cookie and I've made many.. I used Jiff and the aroma was wonderful. I think it is important to use good quality peanut butter. I took them to a pot luck supper and everyone wanted the recipe. A keeper for sure."
"2","4","One of the best I have tried! I like mine on the crunchy side so I baked an extra 4-6 minutes. Texture is just right for a peanut butter cookie, but I will try different brands of peanutbutter to get a more peanutty flavor. This one is going in my favorite recipe stash."
"2","4","This recipe makes a big, chewy cookie with just the right amount of sweetness. However, even though I added an EXTRA 1/4 cup of peanut butter and an extra 1/4 cup of flour, my family still felt it could use more intense PB flavor. I also found they needed to cook more than 10 minutes long. Finally, I discovered that smashing the cookies with the fork made them spread out and get too flat, so with my last batches I just marked a crisscross pattern but did not press down hard. Next time, we will add even MORE peanut butter and see what happens. All in all, a very tasty cookie with great texture."
"2","4","Tasty and simple. I halved the recipe and added a bit more peanut butter per the advice of others."
"2","5","These turn out perfectly- very simple, just like peanut butter cookies are supposed to be! I add chocolate chips sometimes. Love these! A+"
"2","5","These cookies were delicious! I did have a problem with how fast the bottoms browned, but I think it would be perfect if the temperature was 15 or 30 degrees lower."
"2","5","Excellent classic peanut butter cookie recipe. I am making this one for upcoming Christmas parties!"
"2","4","I went with other reviewers and added more peanut butter in addition to a tablespoon of honey. Super delicious and chewy!"
"2","5","My son and I made these today and this recipe was easy, fun and turned out very well. Perfect if you dont have a lot of time. Try this recipe!"
"2","5","My family and i loved this recipe. I changed a few things to it. I added extra half cup of peanut butter. 1 tablespoon of honey,and half a bag of choc. chips. I rolled the 1 inch balls in sugar but did not criss cross them with a fork. I baked them at 375 for 8 mins. They came out very soft and chewy. I will make these all the time now."
"2","5","This is a great receipe! The only thing i changed was i used more pb as other reviewers said. My granddaughter helped me i rolled into balls and she rolled them in sugar and did the fork thing. We had a blast and they were very tasty! TY for great receipe!"
"2","4","I was looking for a hearty, chewy cookie. This one is light and fluffy, with a few crumbs falling off the top. It's tasty, but not the cookie I wanted. These do puff up quite a bit as they cook, then fall down to a fairly 'standard' size. Won't make again."
"2","5","Just like Mom used to make! I did however, add extra peanut butter(and I used creamy) and a tsp. of vanilla."
"2","5","These cookies were amazing... my roommates ate an entire double batch in under two days!!! Definitly try these"
"2","5","I'm no peanut butter cookie expert but these looked beautiful and tasted great. Let them cool on the pan a minute or so to avoid breaking them while you are taking them off the pan."
"2","4","My husband loves peanut butter cookies...and I didn't have a recipe. I tried this recipe and he loved them. Next time I'm going to add some more peanut butter for a little added flavor. Overall though, a very excellent (and easy to make) cookie!"
"2","5","very good cookies...nice and soft"
"2","5","great recipie!!!!! My hubby suggested roling the balls of dough in sugar before flattening them, tasty!!!"
"2","5","Just like my grandfather used to make. My kids love 'em. THANKS!"
"2","3","The flavor was great, but the cookies spread out really thin, and they cooked fast (7-8 minutes). The recipe says that it makes 4 dozen, but I got a whopping 98 (8 dozen +) - 2.5' cookies from it."
"2","4","it is good but it could use more peanut butter, i had to add extra peanut butter to make them taste like peanut butter cookies."
"1","5","I made these cookies exactly to the recipe with the exception of the crunchy peanut butter, I didn't have it so I used smooth. They came out exactly the way I like my peanut butter cookies, crisp on the edges, soft and chewy in the middle. Love this recipe, it will replace the one I have been using."
"1","5","The Cookie Gods are happy tonight. You know it has to be a good cookie recipe when you are want to make them in the summertime. (We have a Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven that the hubby put outside for me. It holds standard size pans so my baking production is not slowed down. I can still spoil all the kids and not heat up the house.) Consider this option and handy tip for yourself. :)  I agree with everyone else, this is a fantastic cookie. I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour, heaped my portion of peanut butter, added an extra egg and a good dousing of vanilla.   Something else I did was barely mix it just until it was all moistened. Dragging a butter knife through it gently and occasionaly scraping the sides and folding it in on itself.  Popped it in the freezer for about a half and hour and when I took it out I used two forks to simply lift our a generous tablespoon of the barely handled dough. When I fillled the baking tray, back into the freezer it went. I dipped the fork in sugar and gently presses the fork into the dough gently pushing the high spots and making the fork marks we all look for. :)  I think handling the cookie dough as little as possible will give you an incredible texture that will drive everyone nuts and only wanting more. I baked them about 8 -10 minutes BTW just like everyone else.  Have a good one --Jodi"
"1","5","I did not have any problems with this recipe! It made delicious cookies. (:"
"1","2","not so good but it's probably my fault. I used natural unsweetened peanut butter and the cookies were dull and dry. I also had to use shortening instead of butter because I was out. Don't make these substitutions and your cookies will probably be better than mine."
"1","5","What an easy recipe to follow and they cookies turned out perfect even without reading the comments I altered it to 1/2 c. of butter and 1/2 c. of shortening. I didn't have enough butter to make it and my butter was salted so no need to add the salt it called for. They turned out perfect with that. They were thick and chewy and yes watch the 10 min and pull them out. My oven cooks a little hot so this I know and adjusted to what I thought would work and like I said they came out perfect. Couldn't be happier with this recipe and how easy it was to have perfect cookies for the kiddos."
"1","5","These are great. Make sure the dough is thouroghly chilled before baking. If not, the cookies will burn on the bottoms before they are fully baked. I chilled overnight, but you would be find with a few hours. I baked at 350 for 7-8 minutes or so. I watched them to make sure they weren't burning. When you take them out of the oven they will be so soft that they seem mushy - falling apart. Just use a spatula to carefully place them on a cooling rack until they firm up as their temperature drops."
"1","5","Best PB cookie recipe that I've used. Versatile and love mixing different types of morsels. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe but added 1/2 cup more of chunky peanut butter and added 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds trying to sneak in some more goodness for my son and hubby. Lol. Very happy.. Crunchy outside and chewy inside."
"1","5","This will be my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies in the future. They are perfect! We prefer cookies that are 3 bites or larger, making it worth the time to cook them. These are 4 or more bites, soft in the center but slightly crunchy on the edges. I set the oven for 10 minutes and finally, something that didn't need even a little adjusting!"
"1","5","These cookies are excellent and turn out every time! They taste like the cookies from my Hometown Bakery where I grew up! I always use salted butter then you can omit the 1/2 tsp. salt, and I add a tsp. of vanilla for added flavor to all my cookie recipes. Be sure to watch your cooking time as all oven temperatures vary. You can chill these if you want, but not necessary as I have done it both ways."
"1","5","My absolute favorite!!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe except for inadvertently only used 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I let them chill in the frig for an hour and followed the advice of another reviewer and did not press them with a fork and they came out soft, moist and perfectly Thick in density. I also added a small amount of white chocolate chips in one batch as one reviewer suggested, they're super rich, but so good!! I will be saving this recipe."
"1","1","I hate to say something negative about someones recipe but, after these baked, they tasted like a ball of flour. I could not taste the Peanut Butter at all. I added more PB to the next batch but no change."
"1","4","So easy and delicious!!"
"1","5","I did exactly what the recipe called for except I used creamy peanut butter (don't care for the crunchy), other than that I didn't change a thing and my cookies turned out perfect! tasted wonderful as well!"
"1","5","Sometimes I add 1c. of mini m & m's !"
"1","5","I made them exactly as the recipe calls for. The only thing I did differently is start taking them out of the oven a little more quickly so they were a little softer and more moist. Still crunchy and delicious after about 7.5 minutes! Perfect!"
"1","5","Natual creamy peanut butter (the type that needs stirring and is runny) worked. Made 26 large cookies for me. For half the cookies I added 8-10 semi-sweet morsels on top after flattening them out. For me I didn't need to add more flour as some have stated in their reviews. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and they turned out slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside."
"1","3","Not great"
"1","5","Too..busy...eating...cookies to review...."
"1","4","Followed this recipe to the letter and they are pretty good. I didn't use crunchy peanut butter since I only had smooth on hand. They spread a lot so be sure to allow plenty of room for them to expand. Putting the dough in the fridge for an hour sure make it easy to roll. I was hoping for a bit fluffier cookie, but the flavour is sure there. I'll use this one again."
"1","5","So these cookies are just so perfect! I leave them just as the recipe states and are a huge hit. I make these easily once a month and they are devoured within the day. A easy favorite."
"1","5","This recipe is wonderful! It turned out perfect for me. Thank you for this recipe!!"
"1","5","The taste is phenomenal and they are delicate. I also tweaked the recipe. I added 1 teas. vanilla, 1 c more peanut butter and maybe 1/4 c more flour. At the end when it was a dough, I added by hand roasted non-salted peanuts and mini chocolate chips. I like that combination.  They melt in your mouth and are very peanuty. They didn't come out crisp as I like. Next time I'll press to make them thinner; still better than any store bought. Anyone have ideas on how to make them crispy? I did bake them longer but it didn't make a difference."
"1","5","Oh. My. Goodness. I made these cookies a few days ago having never made peanut butter cookies ever before and found the recipe easy to understand and carry out, it barely needed any ingredients. It was obviously a little thick and difficult to stir and make into balls but was it ever worth it! A few changes- I added some chocolate chips and used creamy peanut butter. They looked and tasted unbelievable. It's impossible to have just one. Even family members who hate peanut butter and peanut things LOVED these. It made so many cookies too. I will be making these again. Thank you!!!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! Don't Change a thing."
"1","5","These are exactly how a peanut butter cookie should taste. The flavor and texture is perfect. I did use creamy peanut butter because that is what I had and what I always use. I made recipe as written except I did add one teaspoon vanilla. Thanks for the great recipe Shirley Sadler."
"1","4","Very good cookies. Used smooth peanut butter because that is what I had in the house. Would make again."
"1","5","This is the recipe my mother used when I was growing up. Delicious...wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","4","Very good classic PB cookie recipe. I would suggest though using a natural peanut butter without sugar and salt and use salted butter instead of sweet butter. If you can try to find a natural peanut butter with a strong flavor - some seem to stronger than others. When I first tried this recipe I wondered why it didn't taste like the cookies I had as a child and then I realized that all the sugar etc. in conventional PB products was masking the PB flavor. Using natural PB solved the problem."
"1","5","I gave these out to family and friends and they all agreed that this is the best peanut butter cookie recipe that I have made. I ended up making a second batch right away! Really good!"
"1","5","I made a half batch and honestly, the best peanut butter cookies I ever made. I used Lucerne canola light butter and everything else usual ingredients. Awesome"
"1","5","I used creamy peanut butter and added chocolate chips! Delicious! Every time I make them they dont last very long, even though the recipe makes a lot of cookies, made over 50 on the last batch I made."
"1","5","Perfect like it is!"
"1","5","Because it's what I had I used Peter Pan Honey Roasted chunky peanut butter and, because it's just the best, I used raw sugar in substitution for white sugar and sprinkled on top as well. Holy. Cow. Best peanut butter cookie I've ever eaten in my life!"
"1","5","I made this recipe and added 1/2 cp more peanut butter and 1 tsp. Vanilla. I baked for 9 minutes.  After cooled, I topped with melted chocolate. They were delicious!"
"1","4","Theses cookies were very good. They are super simple, and a nice treat on a casual day. I added a little vanilla, a yummy improvement. It is definitely worth trying! ;-)"
"1","2","I made this recipe but with an extra 1/4 c. of flour and 1/4 c. of peanut butter as others have suggested. While the flavor of the cookie was good, they turned out a bit crumbly and dry."
"1","5","These came out delicious!  I've never made peanut butter cookies before , the first batch I over cooked thinking that they would flatten out like other cookies, they don't! The criss cross on top is needed to push the doe down for cooking!  I also added 1/2 a stick of butter extra (yum) ... Cinnamon and chocolate chips and macadamia nuts! They turned out amazing and dynamic!"
"1","5","This recipe worked perfectly. I added a chocolate chip in the middle of each cookie for my kids."
"1","5","Delicious! I love this recipe! The only thing I changed was I added 1 tbsp of Mexican vanilla when I added the eggs... Soo good! I will be using this recipe often"
"1","5","Made a double batch of these today. Very good recipe! Followed other suggestions & increased the peanut butter (used 3 cups for double batch) & flour (used 6 cups). Used salted butter & omitted the additional salt. Baked at 350 for 9 min then took them out. I kept the dough refrigerated between batches. As you can see from my pic, I also threw in some choc chips in a few of the cookies. I feel the secret to my successful peanut butter recipes is to use Jif. In my opinion, that brand has the best fresh roasted peanut flavor that is hard to beat. Thanks for the recipe, Shirley! It's a keeper!"
"1","5","They are perfect with the extra 1/4 cup extra peanut butter, and the 1/2 cup extra flour. Golf ball sized dough balls rolled in sugar. Bake 350 for 10-11 minutes. CHEWY and MOIST. Outstanding!!!"
"1","5","After reading multiple reviews I decided to follow the others lead and add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I also added a tsp of vanilla and used whole wheat flour instead of regular unbleached. They came out great, the whole family loved them :-)"
"1","4","I read the others comments and let the cookie dough rest in the fridge overnight. These cookies do like to travel all over the pan so I suggest rolling them into small balls or you will have HUGE cookies. I also had to keep them in the oven for about 15 min. I also jazzed them up with a chocolate drizzle with Heath bar bits! SO GOOD!"
"1","4","It was very good I did add more flour and less sugar"
"1","5","Well this is my 4th or 5th time in a month that I am making these cookies. :) :) Even though I live by myself, I have been sharing these with my family and neighbors! So I've ended up with only a dozen or so cookies myself. Thats O.K. This time I'm making cookies just for me and my neighbor. OH!! And each time I make them, I get 7 dozen peanut butter cookies. Lots to go round!! HAPPY BAKING!! YUMMY!! :) :)"
"1","5","I am an absolute failure at making cookies, even store-bought ones! However, I had a renewed interest and tried a few recipes again, only to be disappointed over and over again. Until now!!! This will forever be my go-to recipe for cookies! I did follow the other recommendations and added: 1/2 extra peanut butter (smooth), 1/4 cup flour, and 1 tsp vanilla. These cookies had knock you over backwards peanut butter flavor and most importantly remained chewy after cooling (even the next day!...they didn't last longer than that)! Phenomenal cookie! Thank you, Shirley! I can now confidently make cookies and even give them to others without embarrassment!"
"1","5","Same recipe as my mothers - these are delicious! I always use crunchy Jiff - yum!"
"1","3","Am I the only one that wasn't completely impressed with these? I like them to be chewy, and thick! These ended up semi-thin, and not overly sweet, even having applied a few changes suggested by the other commenters. Not bad, but no one was wowed by them (myself included)."
"1","4","I added 1/4 cup additional peanut butter yet the peanut butter taste seems too mild to me and the hubby. But still good...he ate 3 in a row!"
"1","5","I only had time to read the last few reviews suggesting the cookies are great if you add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup peanut butter more. I did this, and added about a tsp vanilla. I cooked for 9 mins at 350 on a pampered chef cookie sheet. I substituted the white sugar (equal parts) with golden cane sugar and OMG. These cookies, hands down, are the best peanut butter cookies I have had (and these are my favourite kind of cookie). I didn't roll them into balls, I just dropped them by tsp on the cookie sheet and pressed a sugar-coated fork in a cross-cross. Have added this recipe to my favourite box and will be my new standby cookie recipe! (this recipe also makes a lot of cookies). I took half of the recipe and rolled the dough into a log and put in the freezer for fresh cookies another time."
"1","5","Love this recipe. After making this recipe a few times and reading a few reviews I made a simple change, I added a cup of quick oats, which thickened the dough a bit and gave the dough a bit more texture."
"1","5","ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh best cookie EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","I made a small mistake with these cookies (poured the white sugar in with the dry ingredients instead of creaming it) and the cookies still came out PERFECT! I sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious. This will become a go-to recipe for me"
"1","5","I just made these they are FANTASTIC!! I too added a bit more peanut butter, and little more flour. I only had smooth peanut butter and salted butter so used those just cut down on salt I added. This recipe made 6 dozen for me? Will make again!"
"1","5","IMO this recipe needed no tweaking. I made no changes and the cookies were perfect. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","These are the best.On my second batch I substituted all chunky peanut butter for half chunky and 3/4 smooth. Seemed to turn out more peanut butter taste and chewy . However, the original recipe is fantastic. My mom who is particular when it comes to cookies and things, loved them. For me thst is enough said. Thank you for sharing your recipe."
"1","5","I took the advice of the reviews and went ahead and added the x-tra flour, peanut butter and vanilla. The cookies came out perfect!"
"1","5","Very tasty! Bf is allergic to nuts so we used cookie butter instead. He made some very 'magic' cookies with this ;)"
"1","5","I tried the recipe, and found it to be the BEST Pnut butter cookie I've ever had. I followed the recipe, and the cookies came out flat, but did they ever taste good... almost like I'd made them with caramel. Definitely will try them again."
"1","5","WONDERFUL ! I added more nuts and a kit kat bar. Most excellent"
"1","5","These cookies were fantastic! Turned out great the first time I tried them and they looked just like the picture. Next time I am going to try adding another 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter and cutting down on the white sugar."
"1","5","This recipe was great! I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't needing so many cookies and still came out with about 20 cookies. Even though I cut all other ingredients down, I still used 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter and I rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. You have to let them cool down before eating them otherwise they will fall apart immediately. After letting them cool, they were all intact and tasted delicious! Quick and simple recipe."
"1","5","Excellent!"
"1","5","I just made this recipe for the first time and I don't understand the comments about the cookies being like pancakes. Mine turned out a little thinner (1/4 inch) than my usual recipe but they tasted much better!  I was worried because I didn't have enough regular peanut butter and about 1/2 cup was all natural peanut butter which is much runnier and has less fillers.  The only tweak I made was that I used salted butter and omitted the salt. I never use unsalted butter when baking. I find everything tastes flat if I don't. I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","The quintessential peanut butter cookie! I did a half recipe, with only one stick of butter in the house. Also added chopped semi-sweet baking chocolate which was not really necessary. I skipped the recommended one hour of chilling time and used a ice cream/cookie scoop to portion out the cookie dough. It is fluffy and I only lightly pressed down with a fork to flatten somewhat They are perfect! Makes 2 dozen with the half recipe."
"1","5","I made these as written, they are very good, wonderful cookies. I had absolutely no issues with them spreading weird or needing any change or addition to be wonderful, they have a delightful texture, and are nice looking cookies too-see my photo"
"1","5","These are awesome. I did add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and reduced the white flour by 1/4 cup. I didn't get to bake them right away, but refrigerated them 1 day. Definitely a keeper."
"1","5","I love it and so did my friends and family they were the most softest cookies I have ate :)"
"1","5","My husband went crazy over this recipe! Like the other users, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 more of flour and 1/4 cup or so of peanut butter. I also baked it at a lower temperature (350) for 10 minutes and they came out perfectly. There are never any leftovers with this one! I haven't tried pressing them in sugar like some of the other users before baking, so I may give it a try next time around!"
"1","4","I made a peanut free version. I used Almond Butter by Jif because this has the same consistency as peanut butter. our son has a peanut allergy and I wanted to try this recipe with the almond butter and the whole family loved them! The cookies lasted only a few days before they were all gone!"
"1","5","I made some and took to work at Home Depot they loved it. I had some problem at the end with the fork design getting sticky on the cookies so I got a cup with ice and put two forks to cool as one started worming up and sticking to the dough I used the one still in the ice cup. and rotated as needed my cookies came out looking beautiful. Making some more today for my co-workers."
"1","4","I love these cookies, but made a couple changes. I used creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter. Also i found that if you let it refrigerate longer then the consistency is better and less runny and no need for more flour. Also if you are feeling daring you can add chocolate chips and have almost a Reeses like cookie!! yum yum!!"
"1","5","i made these folowing the exact recipe and they were delicious. the dough was also great. will definetly be making these again."
"1","5","Thanks for the reviews. I also added 1/4 extra flour, 1/4 cup extra peanut butter, tsp. vanilla extract. Delicious!"
"1","3","These were just medium for me (could take it or leave it.) Tried to use the popular changes suggested on a second batch; the same outcome. Not enough peanut butter flavor, but what's new? I've been on the search for that very thing for years. Oh well will keep searching. Thanks anyway."
"1","5","These were PHENOMENAL! The only change I made was rolling them into balls, then gently, forking them only a little bit flatter. This way when they baked, they didn't completely turn into peanut butter disks."
"1","5","Not enough flour. When you make this recipe, add an extra 1/2 cup of flour and bake for only 6-7 minutes. Then let them cool for 15 minutes. They will be soft and chewy that way, not crunchy."
"1","5","add a little more peanut butter and don't cook them as long so there a bit gooey...the best"
"1","3","i used real butter and all i tasted was butter, first time on this site so hence my screen name"
"1","5","Wow! Sounds like D.Finn made a heap of chocolate & peanut butter with this cookie holding it together! I want some of those, too! (will try next time) As far as this cookie goes, I love it's taste and so does everyone I've given them to - and I'm talking people that consider peanut butter cookies their favorite. Only deviation I made was to add 1t vanilla. Dough is very hard to scoop once it's chilled, and flattens out anyway - you can hardly see the fork marks. So I just made the rest of them with room temp dough & lightly pressed with a fork dipped in fine salt. I leave them on the pan until they're cool enough to move to a rack after baking 10 minutes @ 350* in my gas (propane) oven. I experimented with a few cookies by putting chopped pretzel sticks on some and Kosher coarse salt on others, but they weren't better than the plain ones so I skipped that step for most of them. Why tamper with perfection?? (Unless you can get them to stand up!!) Thank you for the recipe, Shirley!"
"1","5","VERY GOOD!! I made these today but I did take others advice and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cup, and the flour to 3 cups. I added 1 tsp of villina as well. I also baked them at 350. They were soft but do let them cool for several min befor removing them from the pan. Incase anyone care to know, you do not need to refrigerate for one hour. Do not over bake"
"1","4","the cookies came out good but I feel like I really struggled with the cooking time.. I added the extra pb and flour like others suggested.. I used a pb that had dried cranberries mixed in it and it really added a nice chew and flavor to the cookie.. ty for the recipe"
"1","4","Makes a very nice crisp cookie. Follow the recipe. Don't overcook. They are really quite delicious."
"1","5","I used creamy peanut butter and they were perfect! ALSO, instead of refrigerating the dough for an hour I rolled the dough balls, made my indentations and put them in the FREEZER for 15 minutes before baking..it worked like a charm! Just make sure that they are hard to the touch before you put them in the oven."
"1","5","This is the exact cookie I ate as a child! Crispy on the corners and soft in the middle. Yum. I followed the recipe, except used creamy NATURAL peanut butter and organic white whole wheat flour. As always, I use natural peanut butter - despite the rumblings of my critics - and get an irresistible peanut buttery flavor out of this recipe. Who needs all that/those nasty high fructose corn syrup, trans fat, additives and preservatives? Not me, I can tell you that. This recipe is a home run."
"1","5","I am getting married in July, and I decided to make all the desserts for my Rehearsal dinner. I love, love, love peanut butter, and this recipe really seemed great! So I started making it all together and I decided about half way through I really wanted them to be 'peanut buttery' So I added an extra half cup PB, and Peanut butter chips to it as well! Man....were they amazing! I brought them to my coworkers and they still can't stop talking about how great they tasted!! I can't wait to make them again!"
"1","2","There is too much of a buttery taste. With twice the butter as other recipes, too much fat & greasiness as well.  Cut the butter in half & add two teaspoons of vanilla extract to have a good recipe."
"1","5","I've been meaning to review these for weeks now and am just finally getting around to doing so. Since I came across this recipe i have made a couple hundred of them and they turn out amazing every time! This is by far the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've had. I followed the advice of other commenters and in my alterations of this recipe i upped the peanutbutter by an additional half cup, generously i might add, as well as increasing the flour by a generous 1/4 cup. and added a heaping teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, then dipped the balls halfway in sugar before baking. this takes them from awesome to amazing. i did note that with the increase in PB and flour, when you do to flatten them they do split a little on the edges, but that doesnt really bother me any. i bake them for only 9 minutes, NO MORE! they will seem like they are undercooked, and will be too tender to lift and move to a rack, but let them sit a few minutes on the cookie sheet outside of the oven, then transfer when they're sollid enough. they are so soft and moist. and the times ive made this recipe i don't know how i managed it because this never happens, but it came out exactly to 3 dozen. Mine only last a few days only because they get eaten so fast. i stick them in rows of 3 in foodsaver bags to ship in packs of a dozen to my loved ones, and they arrive perfectly intact and just as moist as when i baked them. they loved them even a thousand miles away. can't recommend this recipe enough!"
"1","5","This was a great cookie! The second time I made it, I added 1 1/2 cup of grounded up pumpkin seeds 1/2 cup of grounded flax seeds and 1/2 cf of grouded oats instead of flour and instead of butter I used coconut oil. My kids loved them! To my suprise they tasted really good a little on the crumbly side maybe one more egg....."
"1","5","Great cookie with adding an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. 350 for 10 minutes and they are perfect."
"1","5","Gotta add about a cup more flour if you don't want them to flatten."
"1","1","I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews just because the rating was good. I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. FLAT cookies; makes about 6 dozen! As I was mixing the ingredients I knew this would be the case. Didn't taste much like peanut butter. After an hour and a half in the fridge the dough was still gooey. I shaped the balls the best I could then put them in the freezer, they still spread like no ones business!   Because they spread so much the cookies were crunchy. I like my peanut butter cookies fat and soft. Will not use this recipe again."
"1","5","I have tried so many recipe's for peanut butter cookies and this is the best recipe.I did not have to change a thing followed the recipe to the T.I have made these cookies so many times and they come out the same everytime.I have read some of the reviews and can't understand why they are having so much problems with this recipe.They either don't know how to bake or can't understand the recipe.The cookies came out nice and big and so good.I was told to follow the recipe and if they don't turn out the way you want them to then you can change the recipe to your liking.These cookies were so delicious thank you for this great recipe."
"1","5","These were so good! I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I forgot to chill the dough but they turned out very good anyway. It was probably just a little harder to roll into balls. I also dipped my fork in sugar before I flattened each cookie. I almost ate the whole batch my myself!"
"1","5","i will start off by saying WOW these are really good peanut butter cookies. i made as directed no changes but next time just a little more peanut butter for me they came out perfect. my husband not a big peanut butter fan but kept going back for more THANKS"
"1","5","These cookies are fantastic however if you use margarine they are going to spread. If you over beat the butter and peanut butter they are going to spread. I made them using natural no sugar/ no salt added peanut butter and these were the best - not greasy and full of flavour. I use a potato masher to squish them - works great with a little oil on it."
"1","4","love it thanks"
"1","5","Great recipe, it's a keeper. I didn't have unsalted butter so used salted and used self rising flour omitting salt, soda, and baking powder. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, per comments and rolled in granulated sugar. My husband, children and grands loved them! I also baked for 10 minutes at 365 degrees."
"1","5","I don't typically like peanut butter cookies but at my hubby's request I gave this recipe a try. I added a bit extra flour and peanut butter after reading some of the reviews, oh and a couple tsp of vanilla extract. Didn't have crunchy peanut butter, but creamy worked well. The dough smelled so good, and even with the fear of consuming raw egg, I had to taste it. It was delicious and I knew these cookies would be a hit. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before placing on the cookie sheet and then used a fork to make the criss-cross pattern (which my husband said was important). They turned out so good! I've eaten three and am trying hard not to eat any more tonight. I can't say that I don't like peanut butter cookies anymore after trying this recipe! Yummy!"
"1","4","Love!! Really soft center- and delicious, crispy edges."
"1","5","Excellent recipe to use for quick cookies to make. Full of flavor and didn't change a thing."
"1","5","When I made these, discovered (too late of course!) that I didn't have any brown sugar...but...did have Splenda brown sugar...cut it down to 1/2 cup and the cookies are awesome! I've converted many recipies using Splenda and Splenda brown...they come out just as well! some are even better!!"
"1","5","what a great cookies. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems at all. it just took me too long to figure out how to create the criss-cross pattern easily :D :D anyways, thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","Delicious!!! Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out wonderful. Thanks Shirley for sharing!"
"1","4","I tried this recipe. I did not add flour except to substitute the last 1/2 cup of regular white four with whole wheat flout. Whole wheat flour has bulk to it and i was happy with the results. I use a melon baller to serve up the cookie dough and then i use a large meat tenderizer mallet to flatten the cookie dough. Leaves a waffle pattern and works great! I like the cookies and would make them again"
"1","4","good recipe removed baking soda added 1/2 table spoon of baking powder and whipped creammed mixture didn't need to leave in fridge turned out great"
"1","5","Perfect Cookies! Taste sooo good. I did as many reviews suggested and added extra flour and PB as well as a tad vanilla (I didn't measure). Cooked at 350 for 10 Min and they came out perfectly done. For the lines in the cookies I dipped my fork in sugar so it wouldn't stick and pressed just enough to make the indentions. (I used creamy PB)."
"1","5","I absolutely loved this recipe. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of almond flavoring."
"1","5","These were wonderful cookies! I did add about 1/2 cup of extra flour and about 1/2 extra peanut butter. Also, you can add semisweet chocolate chips or peanut butter morsels for variation!"
"1","5","I have to say I'm not much of a baker, well at all really, but these were extremely easy! I read the reviews at the bottom and decided to moderate my ingredients as well by adding 1/2 cup of both flour and peanut butter.Furthermore I also substituted the 1/2 teaspoon of salt for a teaspoon of vanilla. For two reasons I too didn't have un-salted butter and I love vanilla!  # When it's time to make the pattern, dip your fork in flour to make sure it doesn't stick."
"1","5","I have used this recipe twice now. The cookies came out great, my family loved them! I did make a few changes. I used regular margarine or butter, and I didn't have brown sugar so I used 1 3/4 cup white sugar. I also added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/2 cup more flour. They came out great both times with these changes!"
"1","5","Very Good!!"
"1","5","These were so good! I skipped the chill time and just baked right away. The cookies were the perfect thickness and chewiness."
"1","4","loved these cookies, I made them this morning. I did however give it 4 instead of 5 stars because as other reviews said, I did add half a cup more peanut butter and flour, I also left it in the fridge overnight and they were awesome. I will definitely make these again."
"1","5","very good, the only changes I made is too cut the sugar...it's perfect."
"1","5","Best Peanut Butter Cookies I ever make. Easy as can be."
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. After reading the most helpful reviews, I added 1/4 c peanut butter and 1/2c flour as recommended. These cookies are dry and crumbly."
"1","4","These cookies tasted really good, but they were kind of crumbly. Not sure why."
"1","4","These were great as far as texture but the dough as mixed was too sticky. I added just under 1/4c. of flour and it was all right. These aren't as peanut buttery as I would have liked, but considering my daycare kids devoured them, I can't help but like them! :)"
"1","5","Fantastic cookies! I read the other reviews and added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and added a tablespoon of vanilla as well.  For chocolate lovers, I always add SKOR bars crumbled on top of the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven. Try it, it's amazing!"
"1","5","Very good recipe. I took suggestions from other reviews and added a 1/4 cup extra peanut butter and flour and 1 tsp vanilla. They were nice and chewy and delicious."
"1","5","I made these exactly as stated, except I did not put the dough in the fridge. They are great! I got 48 decent size cookies from the recipe .... I can't imagine only 24 cookies - they would be huge!"
"1","5","great recipe!"
"1","5","Easy and they turned out great!"
"1","5","Made 1/2 batch of these and added mini chocolate chips. The kids loved them... so did I! Will make these again, full batch next time! *note* I used organic PB, the kind that is just ground peanuts and sometimes it does not work with recipes calling for PB but worked well with these cookies."
"1","3","Sweet, classic peanut butter cookies.... However, I had a major problem with how quickly these cookies burn!! I undercooked (almost seven minutes, rather than the ten instructed) one batch and they turned out to be the only edible ones. I can't say that my husband or I were very happy about 40 minutes of prep and burned cookies!!!"
"1","4","I love theses! I didn't even put them refrigerator, Mostly cuz I forgot.... lol, Great cookies though!"
"1","5","Excellent. Made exactly as written, except that I ran out of brown sugar, so used about 3/4 brown and 1/4 Demerara. Also, only refrigerated dough 20 minutes before baking first tray. I was out of time. Came out perfectly."
"1","4","I tried adding 1/4 cup of flour and peanut butter as suggested, but my cookies came out sort of crumbly! Use caution when adding more flour"
"1","5","I love peanut butter cookies! but since I also love chocolate I tried this recipe changing the peanut butter for nutella (chocolate cream) and they turned out pretty good as well!"
"1","5","Delicious!"
"1","5","these are awsome i made a batch got maybe 4 my bf ate the rest men are so cute best to do work the batter to a cream consistancey"
"1","5","The family devoured them."
"1","5","This is a definite keeper - my new go-to recipe for pb cookies. I added 1/4 cups each of flour and peanut butter."
"1","5","A great peanut butter cookie recipe, I did add 2 tsp of vanilla, and did not use crunchy peanut butter, just smooth. Thanks for the post!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS. a bit sweet for me but I still thought it was a great recipe. moist, soft, and a bit crumbly all in one. I also added 1/4 cup flour + 1/4 cup peanut butter. baked for 10 minutes at 350 F. I left it on the baking sheet for 5 minutes after baking and watched as the cookies cooled into a beautiful golden color!"
"1","4","Good flavor but wish they were softer."
"1","5","I will say that this is a great tasting cookie. I really like and the ingredients were all on hand to throw together. I ran a bit short on crunchy peanut butter so added a bit of creamy. I liked it just fine. The difficulty I had was with the cooking time. I am sure it is due to my oven, my weather, my humidity in part but I ended up having to increase the time to 15 minutes in order to have a cookie that did not crumble in my hand. The first batch just dissolved but the added time on the subsequent batches made for a perfect cookie!"
"1","5","This is awesome- my new favorite cookie recipe! I did do some adaptations after reading the other comments: I added about 1 tsp of vanilla and an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter for more PB flavor. I didn't need to add flour- the dough will be a bit gooey, but stick it in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes and it will be easier to handle (also refrigerate it between batches). I also followed the tip of dipping the balls in granulated sugar and I'm not sure if it improves the cookies themselves, but it certainly makes the dough balls easier to handle. Finally, I added chocolate chips to about half of mine and both ways were good but let's face it- everything's better with chocolate! :)"
"1","5","I love this recipe! I make it exactly as written and have to double every time because my family eats them all in a day!"
"1","5","AWESOME cookies! I used margarine and creamy peanut butter. I also added the extra 1/4 c of flour and peanut butter that a lot of people suggested. I chilled the dough for 20 mins or so, then used a cookie scoop instead of making balls. I just left them instead of flattening them. I really like how they came out this way. YUM!"
"1","4","These were pretty tasty! I just added a splash of vanilla extract but otherwise followed exactly. You really can't overcook these, even 1 minute longer and they're shot. I had to watch these so carefully but when I did, they turned out great!"
"1","4","Great but they turned hard and crumbly."
"1","5","These are very good cookies. As it seems many people have done, I increased the flour and the peanut butter. I use 2 3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter. I've also found that you definitely need to refrigerate the dough for at least the hour if you don't want them to spread out too much."
"1","4","happy with these only changes i made was added some vanilla and half a bg of chocolate chips. i put the cookie sheets of dough in the freezer for 20 minutes before i put it in the oven, may have got a little bigger but not much, oh and i forgot the baking soda, wasn t a big deal... i would recomend it"
"1","5","very good cookies....makes a good amount. I chopped up some fisher dry roasted peanuts and added to the dough.Have made them several times. Making them again this evening thinking about adding some choc chips"
"1","5","Perfect every time!"
"1","4","Add a bag of peanut butter chips and baked for 7 minutes.... delish!"
"1","5","I made these cookies last night for dessert. I just had a taste for peanut butter cookies. I looked over a couple of recipes and reviews, I decided to try this one. Glad I did.. they were awesome!! I did add a teaspoon of vanilla flavor, creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy a 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I used salted butter, that is what I had on hand so I just used a pinch of salt instead of a 1/2 teaspoon. I also reduced oven temp to 350."
"1","4","I cut this receipe in half and added a dash of vanilla. Everyone loved them. Thanks Shirley."
"1","5","These are dangerously good. I use creamy natural peanut butter. Also, I usually use salted butter and omit the 1/2 tsp salt that the recipe calls for."
"1","5","Just getting around to reviewing this one, perfect as written. Also fine with creamy peanut butter"
"1","5","This is the best tasting peanut butter cookie recipe! It is super easy to make and it tastes so much better then the cookies sold in the grocery stores."
"1","5","very good recipe, didn't make any changes and they turned out great, took them to work and they disappeared. only suggestion is to watch closely and not let them cook to long."
"1","5","Great just next time I would reduce the amount of sugar"
"1","5","Did 1 and 1/2 smooth peanut butter (don't like them crunchy) and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, but reduced the flour to 2 cups per people's reviews. Came out pretty good"
"1","5","really good and went fast! very tender cookie and smelled so good after baking."
"1","4","Basically good but bland.. suggestions? I followed reviews and added 1/4 c extra PB and flour each and tsp vanilla.. And dipped one side in sugar and criss crossed. Nice texture. I preferred 375 degrees to 350 so a little crispier on outside.. Took out@9min."
"1","4","Make that cup of peanut butter a generous one, and don't press down too much, keep the cookies thick. I baked mine for 7 minutes st 350*."
"1","4","Excellent recipe. I also increased the PB and the flour for a tighter cookie. I only had creamy on hand and I think the cookies Lacked texture without the nuts from the chunky. My bad, but they were still great."
"1","5","Delicious! I had to make two batches because my boyfriend at all the dough!"
"1","5","We loved this recipe too! Thank you to the bakers! We used a Jiffy-type, creamy peanut butter and they were soooo good. They are delicate so they don't hold up super well, but that's ok bc they taste so good. We added kisses on top at Christmas time, but they are so good they don't need them!"
"1","5","WOW!!! I don't like peanut butter cookies, but I made these for my boyfriend, and I LOVED them (can't wait til he tries them!). Sooo creamy! Added a dash of coarse ground salt to the top of each one prior to baking to highlight the creaminess. Friends at work are raving over these as well. Will be making another batch on Monday."
"1","5","This really is a classic recipe for peanut butter cookies. They are crunchy around the outside and soft in the middle. I used a half cup crunchy and a half cup creamy. I thought they had perfect peanut butter flavor."
"1","5","I LOVE! this pb cookie recipe!! Every batch turns out great. I usually double the recipe, and add one bag of pb chips and one bag of mini Reeses Pieces. Yum!"
"1","5","I've made these Peanut Butter Cookies a few times and they are always a hit with my family. I added peanut butter chips to the recipe and it was still awesome"
"1","5","I added M&M's to this recipe!"
"1","5","Good peanut butter cookie! A little thin so next time I will shape out larger cookies."
"1","5","Tasty! Traditional PB Cookies- can't go wrong! I bumped up the PB and flour a tad, they look and taste wonderful! Thanks for the recipe! :)"
"1","5","I've made these cookies twice. They are very addicting. I add 2 tsp of vanilla and add 1/4 more flour and 1/4 more pb."
"1","5","I made these cookies last night and I absolutely loved them! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","4","I love this recipe, but also made a few tweaks. I used regular salted butter and creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I also used light and dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and added vanilla. The first time I made this recipe I forgot the baking powder and ended up with a chewier cookie. Both were really good. I also added peanut butter chips."
"1","5","I was looking for a classic peanut butter cookie recipe one like I had in home economics class. This one was perfect , easy and very tasty!!"
"1","4","After adding a 1/4c of flour and 1/4c of peanut butter, this recipe was great. Made half plain and half with chocolate chips and everyone loved them."
"1","5","Peanut butter cookies are not my favorite, but they are my husband's favorite. I made 2 batches of these cookies. The first batch was exactly as the recipe stated. My family loved them. On the second batch, I replaced half of the sugar with Stevia and half of the all-purpose flour with wheat flour. I also increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup. My family still had rave reviews. Thank you, Shirley."
"1","4","Awesome Cookies!!! I read the reviews and added 1/2c flour and 1tsp vanilla...they were great! Cookies were not as peanut buttery as I would have liked them to be, so I will add more next time around and less butter. Great recipe!"
"1","5","I made the recipe without changing anything except the cooking time. I added 5 min because I prefer them on the crispy side. Just keep a eye on their color. They were the peanut butter cookie that I was hoping for and this will be my default from now on."
"1","5","These were wonderful. Soft, full, and the whole family enjoyed them. I didn't change anything, and I didn't have to. They were perfect. They did not come out think they puffed up when baked they shaped great. This is a cookie recipe I will be keeping for sure. It made well over 24 cookies with using more like 2 tbs drops. Its a must try"
"1","5","I had to change this because I didn't have two of the ingredients.. so this is what I did. I substituted the cup of butter with an additional cup of peanut butter, and I completely omitted the brown sugar. I had to add a splash of milk to make it the proper consistansy and then I had to get in there and mix it with my hands because it was so thick... but it made 40 cookies out of 1 inch balls, and I couldn't be happier with the flavor. These were plenty sweet and peanut-buttery!"
"1","4","Just made these and they turned out great. I increased the flour and peanut butter by 1/4 cup each, and decreased the sugars by 1/2 cup each and they were PLENTY sweet. We rolled them in red and green sugar for Christmas. Very yummy."
"1","4","I added an extra 1/4 Cup of flour as well as peanut butter. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, because I think it enhances the flavors, and I threw in some peanut butter chips for extra peanut butter flavor. I baked for 10 minutes for the first batch and then 9 minutes for the following batches. I refrigerated my dough overnight. They turned out fabulous."
"1","3","Needs adjustments: bake for 7-8 minutes, add 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon."
"1","5","My Family Loves these cookies!!"
"1","5","Great cookies"
"1","5","Great - the only change: Used Organic Peanut Butter"
"1","4","Very good, my husband was requesting peanut butter cookies and I thought I would try these out. They cam out excellent, I followed some of the suggestions (ie: added more flour, peanut butter and vanilla). Really good, just had to increase cooking time to 13 minutes as we have an older oven :)"
"1","5","Fab cookies. I made 2 dozen 'as is' and the I made a dozen with dark chocolate chunks and a dozen with white chocolate and butterscotch chips. They were all great!"
"1","5","I love this recipe! I made smaller cookies & cooked them for only 7 minutes. I ended up with just over 6 dozen cookies."
"1","4","Good recipe! I split the recipe in half because I didn't need all of those cookies. They were very good and very peanut buttery without having to add any additional peanut butter. When I took the batter out of the refrigerator it was a little soft (and I left it in for the entire hour). More flour as other suggested is probably needed. Because the batter was too soft I couldn't put the criss cross paterns on them with the fork."
"1","4","awesome, didnt notice the peanuts though"
"1","1","WARNING! This recipe will NOT work if you are using all natural peanut butter with no oil added. They come out like flour. There isn't enough oil. Look elsewhere if you have that type of peanut butter."
"1","5","I was looking for something fast and sweet..came across this recipe and decided to try it...happy I did...very good :) ps. the recipe divided nicely as well!"
"1","5","I had all the ingredients on hand, and made these with the 'help' of my 2 1/2 year old daughter. I reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup, and replaced 1 cup of all-purpose flour with whole wheat and the cookies turned out great. But next time I will cook them for 8 minutes instead of 10 so they will retain a little bit more moisture."
"1","4","made these last night. i took the advice of others and added 1/4 cup more each of flour and peanut butter. the cookies came out tasting very good. the reason i am only giving 4 stars however is because i was hoping the cookies would be softer once fully cooled. i was very careful not to overcook them. they arent crispy, but arent chewy. overall its a good cookie and i would make them again."
"1","5","I made two batches. They were great. Don't over cook them."
"1","4","needs more sugar and vanilla i had to add 1 1/2 cups more sugar"
"1","5","Northern Arizona - Elevation 5785 Feet.  Alternate Ing. - Regular Peanut Butter - Same measurement* (see below for chewie at elevation).  * Followed JenniferC77 recommendations and added the following:  1/2 Cup additional All-Purpose Flour 1/2 Cup additional Smooth Peanut Buter Sprinkled Sugar on top after cross forking.  Cooking Time Alternate - Cooked only 8 minutes versus 9.  Awesome chewie peanut butter cookies. Hope this helps some at elevation."
"1","4","I had to twink the recipe a lil but but the over all outcome of this recipe is a real big hit with my family. I'll occasionally add in chocolate chips or Reeces chips in the cookie dough. YUM!"
"1","4","I just made these cookies yesterday. The only thing I added was 1tsp of Vanilla."
"1","5","I followed what other people had suggested and added 1/4 cup peanutbutter and 1/4 cup flour. They came out great. Next time I will cut the sugar just a little as they tasted a bit too sweet."
"1","5","These are wonderful! Always gone within a day when I make them for my family. Plus it's easy! Great recipe."
"1","5","I will call my own version Three Nut Cookies. I put in one egg to toughen it, after seeing that some people had problems with the dough. I added a TB of liquid hazelnut creamer and topped each cookie with chopped walnuts. Very good and the cookies are soft but don't break apart in your hand."
"1","4","Great recipe though I found that the cookies weren't very peanut buttery."
"1","5","SOOOOO GOOD!"
"1","5","Light and fluffy and chewy and gooey delicious! Great recipe, I didn't have to alter anything!"
"1","5","I have used this recipe repeatedly and shall I just say I LOVE IT! I usually put a little chocolate chip in the middle :) It's always better with a little tiny chocolate chip."
"1","3","my cookies went tooo thin...I'd recommend reducing the butter by atleast 20 gms..... tasted AWESOME though"
"1","5","I followed great advice of others before me (increasing both flour and PB by 1/2C, and rolling the balls in sugar before making criss-cross patterns with a fork). I added a large dollup of sour cream as I often do with recipes calling for brown sugar since something magical happens when the two come together. I also increased the salt to a heaping tsp because I crave salty sweet. Baking for 9min slightly browned rims but were chewy still - though I'm a mile high so adjust accordingly. Enjoy!"
"1","5","I read the advice others offered about adding 1/2c. flour and peanut butter in addition to the given amounts and the cookies turned out perfect! I used creamy peanut butter and added whole lightly salted peanuts as well as chocolate chip cookies (not like they weren't perfect already, but why not?)."
"1","4","kind of dry but taste good. i followed recipe but used stick margarine, and baked on parchment peper, they turned out good . iwas looking for a more chewy cookie"
"1","2","these cookies absolutely tasted like peanut butter, but something wasn't right about the way they tasted.... i followed the instructions and everything but i guess i was imagining them to taste like Mrs. Fields PB cookie....... guess not... :/ ???"
"1","3","Followed the recipe exactly. Came out fine, but I've had better cookies. A bit disappointing given all the rave reviews."
"1","5","I followed the recipe and they came out EXCELLENT!!!! MUST REMEMBER TO REFRIGERATE,I did for 2hrs and turned out GREAT!!!"
"1","5","yumm! a super easy recipe too!"
"1","4","The cookie could use a stronger peanut butter taste, but it has a wonderful texture. The outside is crunchy but when you bite into it, it is soft. If you bake it longer, both inside and outside are crunchy and that's OK, too. Will use this recipe again."
"1","5","I reduced the ingredients by half and came up with one dozen amazing cookies. I will definately make these again."
"1","5","Amazing! I LOVE this recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome cookies! I used organic peanut butter and baked at 300 degrees for 20 minutes. After my mom tried these she exclaimed that they were 'The best peanut butter cookies she has ever tasted. EVER.' Thanks!"
"1","5","Perfect! I just added 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla. I add vanilla to everything. I also used creamy peanut butter and it was still very good. My boyfriend love them too! Thanks for sharing the recipe, LOVE IT!"
"1","5","Very tasty peanut butter cookie. Like other reviewers, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of peanut butter, but thought the batter still needed more flavor. So, I cut up 10 Reese's peanut butter cups and folded into the batter. The final result, a soft peanut butter cookie with a little surprise (more intense chunks of flavor). Yum!"
"1","5","Awesome! I even made these dairy free by substituting Blue Bonnet Light margarine and they turned out perfect. Thank you!"
"1","5","Perfect recipe!"
"1","5","Super yummy! I've been looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe for a while. I've tried a couple of other recipes from this site and wasn't too impressed. These knocked it out of park. I followed the exact recipe and like others have said, the cookies did turn out a little flat. Next time I'm going to try adding extra peanut butter and flour to make them fluffier."
"1","5","Made these exactly as directed and thought they were fantastic. Yeah a little crumbly but I guess as long as the taste is there, that's what matters to me. Thanks."
"1","5","Fabulous. I used a bit more flour as other users had advised, and I also added 1 tsp. vanilla. Cookies came out soft and chewy! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","I really like this recipe and have used it several times. I don't change a thing. When I made the cookies today, I forgot to flatten the balls on one of cookie sheets. They needed to cook another minute and when they were done, they turned out to be the moistest chewiest peanut butter cookies I've ever seen."
"1","5","These were more work then I am used too but well worth it!"
"1","4","Made exactly per the instructions with the exception that I baked directly after mixing. They are a bit crispy baked at 10 minutes - we prefered them baked 8 minutes. I sprinkled about half with coarse sea salt before baking - yummy! A very tasty cookie."
"1","5","These were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had! Very chewy and the flavor is perfect! My hubby and my parents loved them!"
"1","5","This is now my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe!!!"
"1","3","I used 1/2 cup more of peanut butter (Skippy Natural, Extra Crunchy) and flour. The dough was very crumbly when I pressed with a fork. The finished cookies were also very crumbly, which I do not prefer. They do taste great, but overall, I think I will try a different recipe next time."
"1","2","We thought these were just ok. They have some sort of funny smell and flavor. If I used this recipe again I would cut the baking soda down to 1tsp."
"1","5","Yummy! Not healthy by any means b/c of the saturated fat and tons of sugar, but good not the less."
"1","5","take 3 extra minutes and make homemade peanut butter. 1c. roasted, unsalted peanuts a few tablespoons of peanut oil salt and sugar to taste it takes this wonderful recipe to whole new heights! i also added a handful of ghiradelli dark chocolate chunks. holy those were amazing!"
"1","5","PB cookies have always been tricky for me, but this recipe was perfect! Thanks!!"
"1","5","As many other reviewers, I have tried many peanut butter cookie recipes on this site. This one is the best yet. My husband loves peanut butter cookies so I make them just for him. The only changes I made were of necessity. I only had crunchy peanut butter and no peanuts so I used the crunchy and added no peanuts. I also only had a limited time so I only chilled them for 1 hr 15 min. My husband likes peanut butter chips for extra peanut butter flavor, so I added those as well. Turned out AWESOME!"
"1","4","They were good, I added more peanut butter -- maybe 1/2 cup more and I also threw in a few bit of chocolate from a baking chocolate bar I had lying around. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by the comments and rolled each ball in white sugar before putting on the cookie sheet -- be careful not to push down too much or to remove while still hot because the cookies will crumble!"
"1","5","This was a wonderful recipe that my family really enjoyed. I did add 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peaunut butter and they came out perfect. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
"1","4","I tweaked the recipe a bit but it definatly deserves a good rating! I used smooth peanutbutter instead (not a fan of crunchy cookies) I put a pinch more baking soda and powder in because the first few times I made them they came out very flat. Also, I had to watch them carefully it is only a minute or so and they will burn and get hard! I would start checking each batch at around 7-8 minutes to make sure they don't burn. But this is definatly a must easy yummy recipe."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. Due to a dairy allergy in our family, I had to substitute butter with Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks, but other than adding a smidge of vanilla, I did not make any other changes to the recipe. I needed a slightly larger cookie, so I used my small cookie scoop to scoop out 2 balls of dough and then rolled them together to make 1 larger cookie. I was able to get 40 cookies out of this recipe at that size. I baked in the oven for 12 minutes, shut the oven off and let them sit another 5 mintues, then cooled them on the pan for 10 minutes and they were perfection. My daughter, who can't have dairy, loved them and kept asking for more!"
"1","4","Really good cookies. My grands are loving the dough. I made one change to the recipe and that was to use half crisco and half butter. This is just a personal preference of mine so that the cookies are soft."
"1","5","Wonderful cookies. I added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour"
"1","4","Delicious cookies, I added a bag of white chocolate chip morsels for a little pizazz. They came out great!"
"1","5","Best recipe I've tried in a long time. Good old fashioned taste thatwe all Love. Added a little vanilla and wheat germ to recipe it was awesome!!!"
"1","5","good classic cookies"
"1","5","Amazing taste, Flavorful and just great overall"
"1","5","loved this recipe! I did add per other suggestions an extra 1/4 cup of PB and flour and 1 tsp of vanilla. I only had reg PB but they were the best PB cooKies I have had. If you like your PB cookies to be softer just shorten the baking time and these will stay soft for days in an airtight container. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"1","4","One huge tip for these cookies **Wait to let the cookie cool completely on the cookie sheet before removing or else it'll crumble apart during the transfer** I flatted with a fork the 1st batch and they came out FLAT so the 2nd time around I only rolled into a small ball, they came out with a wonderful shape and just right. Everyone loved the taste, received many compliments, I also increased peanut butter and flour and added vanilla extract as recommended."
"1","5","yeah, I tried this too but i put half of sugar in the recipe. it was sweat enough. It depends on personal taste and minor point. the bottom line is it's great recipe!!"
"1","5","awesome!"
"1","4","this is my go to pb cookie recipe. like other reviewers, i increased the pb by 1/2-1cup. i also used organic, natural, creamy pb. this last time i used 1 cup of pb and about 3/4c of nutella, with amazing results. also increased the flour by 1/2 cup. great recipe that is very forgiving if you add a little here and there."
"1","4","Good basic peanut butter cookie recipe. I wonder why mine seemed a little dry however."
"1","5","My mother loves them. she called me for the recipe, And cooked them for over 30 people . All really love them, Sorry not peanut buttery tasting for me. But I will give a recipes 5 star.... they are good"
"1","4","This cookie was pretty good. The peanut butter was a little overwhelming for me but the rest of the family enjoyed them. I decided to make cookie bars and baked the cookies in a circular tin. Then I cut them into bars. They were crispy on the edges and moist and chewy on the outside. Overall this recipe was good."
"1","5","Awesome cookies. Added a bag of chocolate chunks. Definitely a keeper."
"1","4","I tried the alteration that most suggested and still found them to be a little dry. I guess that's how they're suppose to be, because most peanut butter cookies are a little on the dry side. I save some of the left overs for one last pan where I added a tiny bit of milk and mini m&m's, they were good. I'll have to try that later and turn them into a drop cookie."
"1","5","I used 1 1/2 cup crazy richard's (natural) chunky peanut butter, and 2 3/4 cup flour, leaving the rest of the recipe the same. The cookies were delicious and got rave reviews from everyone. This recipe is going to be a regular! For me, this made 60 good sized cookies."
"1","5","So Yummy!!!!!!! I added a little extra peanut butter and a little vanilla. Awesome recipe. Very simple and easy, my 4 yr old help make them, yet so very tasty!!!!"
"1","5","Loved it. They come out very soft... if you like them to be more crunchy just stick them in the fridge."
"1","4","Very good cookie."
"1","3","One secret to a great peanut butter cookie is not only vanilla extract - but to double the amount of vanilla extract. For that reason, this one ain't it."
"1","5","LOVED this recipe!! Best cookies ever! I didn't use chunky peanut butter or unsalted butter and I added 1/4 c more pb and flour!"
"1","5","AMAZING!!"
"1","4","I followed the recipe exact, only making this with my older son. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, only because I do that with all my peanut butter cookies. I found the dough for these cookies to be a little.....fluffy, which worried me. I did chill the dough for an hour, but I don't think that was enough, to be honest. They didn't spread as much as I worried they would but....these just aren't the cookie I was hoping for, I guess. We like a more peanut-buttery, chewier cookie. This just wasn't for us. 375* for eight minutes. Not the recipe's fault. FYI: This makes a TON of cookies. And big ones, at that."
"1","5","yum:)"
"1","4","I added 1/4th cup more flour to this recipe after reading other comments. I must have made my cookies small because one batch yielded 5 dozen cookies, rather than 2 dozen. I left them in the oven for 10 min at 350. They were very yummy and chewy, but quite buttery- so I guess I'm glad that I made them smaller so that people could choose to eat a smaller quantity of them, though it's still difficult to do!"
"1","5","These were amazing! I didnt have any problems with the cookies being flat. They were chewy and delish. The only thing I changed was I didnt have baking powder so I used a little more soda."
"1","5","Great recipe! I too changed it a little and added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and an additional 1/4 peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour. The result was a cookie that baked great and turned really chewy the next day. Normally I like a more crispy cookie..but these are wonderful!"
"1","5","These are delicious, the perfect traditional peanut butter cookie. I added 1 cup of peanut butter chips. These are great!"
"1","5","I only had bread flour, no brown sugar and no baking soda. I added more baking powder and only used white sugar. Wished I had brown sugar......... The cookies came out really thick & good though!"
"1","5","These cookies are so good! I didn't change one thing, and they were perfect! They were gone three days after I made them, and there's only four pepple in my house. Love them!"
"1","5","Awesome! This makes a very nice peabut butter cookie. I used half butter and half shortening because it usually makes a better texture and it worked just fine - very peanut buttery."
"1","4","The first time I made these cookies I wasn't being very precise in measurement and I had cut the recipe in half but accidentally threw in 2 eggs. I also added a little extra butter and some more peanut butter and vanilla and they came out amazing. Super chewy but crunchy around the edges and amazing in flavor. Unfortunately I stayed closer to the recipe the past two times and they came out kind of dry and bland."
"1","5","Added extra 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/4 'mushed up' dates. Used whole wheat flour. Thanks for the original recipe :-)"
"1","5","love them! I didnt have unsalted butter so i used salted butter but didnt add any salt. It worked out fine."
"1","5","My 13-year-old made these on his own. They turned out perfectly and were delicious!"
"1","4","YUMMY! I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the recipe but it really wasn't enough... so if you like that strong taste of peanut butter, I would recommend adding 2 cups, or maybe even more but other than that, this recipe is great... I can't wait to make these cookies again!"
"1","4","Pretty good. I'd add a little bit more pb next time to make the taste stronger."
"1","5","Really good. Added 1/2 cup more flour and peanut butter and 1 tsp vanilla. used 2 tbls of dough per cookie, made 37 cookies."
"1","5","Very good! The cookies were soft, chewy, and very peanut-buttery. Extra flour is a must. I have a large jar of peanut butter at home and nobody wants to eat it because it does not contain hydrogenated fat and tastes too creamy. Now we have found a way to enjoy our healthy peanut butter. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","I had a traumatic peanut butter incident as a child! My grandfather decided to make me peanut butter and jelly oatmeal... and my goodness the smell. The horrid horrid smell!!! So to make a long story short I did not eat peanut butter for approx. 15 years. So, for my husband being the big time peanut butter freak that he is... I decided to take one for the team and smell the hot peanut butter cookies as they baked in the oven...Boy was I surprised! These cookies were phenomenal! Soft... delicious... enough to make me forget about the pb&j oatmeal... Well almost ... :) Thank you so much!"
"1","5","PEFECTION!! I made these cookies with Organic Peanut Butter and added 1/2 cup additional flour that was recommended by other reviewers and found the best cookie ever! My family can't leave them alone. I was worried about how they would turn out because of the different texture of organic natural peanut butter - but they were just right. This is a keeper recipe!"
"1","3","At first I didn't like them so much, but the more I ate them, the more I got used to them. They are unusual, but good. My family liked them as well."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe. My family enjoyed it. It would be even better if you made it chewier !!!"
"1","5","Just as suggested I added the additional peanut butter and flour...I also added a tsp of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Popped them in for 9.5 minutes (in my gas oven) and BAM! Perfection! I also added a drop of grape jam to the tops of half of the batch before baking to make them PB&J cookies...yum yum!"
"1","4","Great recipe with the added changes as other people have suggested of 1/2 cup more flour and a teaspoon vanilla. I used creamy peanut butter. As an extra treat, I softened some vanilla ice cream and made ice cream sandwiches with some of these. Yum!!"
"1","4","These are awesome! We ended up adding a little more flour because it looked a little thin. Other than that....AWESOME!"
"1","5","Delicous! Simple and yummy. I didn't want to wait the hour to refrigerate, so just baked a batch after I mixed the batter. Came out perfect."
"1","5","I have a wonderful recipe my fiance's aunt gave me that makes absolutely wonderful PB cookies...I will submit it later... but the recipe got lost in boxes when we moved so I decided to try this one....The cookies were so good! my #2 fave PB cookies now. To me they tasted very similar to the ones you make from the frozen dough you buy from boy scouts and school fundraisers. so moist very delicious... I used extra crunchy peanut butter. Makes large cookies. They were so good they only lasted a half hour out of the oven with my fiance and brothers around!"
"1","5","My husband thanks you! He gobbled these up...thank goodness I hid some for myself!"
"1","5","Best peanut butter cookie recipe ever. Ive tried 3 other recipes from this sight but this one exceeded all of them. I did add 1/4 cup more flour and had to use half shortening since I only had half cup of butter on hand. Thank you for the recipe, my whole family enjoyed these cookies immensely"
"1","4","These were pretty good. 10 minutes in my oven would have WAY burned them; I needed about 5-1/2 minutes so watch them closely. They were a little bland tasting, even after adding more peanut butter. Maybe next time I will try adding a little vanilla."
"1","3","Firstly, these cookies did taste nice and they turned out soft. BUT they have way too much butter in them (and I am a butter LOVER), they fell apart and were too thin. I have a lot of experience baking cookies so I took all of the usual 'precautions' and still couldn't get them to work. I left the dough in the fridge overnight to harden, and they still came out flat. I then rolled them all into balls and put them in the freezer. Still, after I froze them they still came out flat & it was really hard to get the design on the top to come out looking pretty. These are definitely NOT 'Classic' peanut butter cookies. If I was to make these again, I would probably cut the butter in half and possibly add more PB/Flour. ALSO: they made approx 50 cookies, not the 24 as stated & I made regular size cookies."
"1","5","Awesome cookies! I followed other's advice and increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/2 cup. So yummy!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe as-is, with the addition of a splash of vanilla extract-- because I just can't bake cookies without it-- and I think the recipe is great! I've always used my grandmother's recipe, but it got packed away and is now in storage, so I was not expecting to be blown away. But, I was pleasantly surprised! One note: Do NOT overbake! They will burn very easily. My oven cooked them perfectly in 9 minutes. Note that slight discrepancies might be a result of different qualities of peanut butter. Standard peanut butter might yield a different texture and flavor than an 'all natural' peanut butter. Some peanut butters also contain more salt than others; so all these things should be considered when rating a recipe. Overall, this is a good recipe. It will give you perfectly edible peanut butter cookies, which are really great with a tall glass of milk!"
"1","4","this is great!i changed a couple of things, a used 1 1/2 cups of crunchy peanut butter,and 1 cup of peanut butter chips. baked it at 350 for about 10 min.i had to let them sit on the pan to cool a little they are so chewy and good!and i didnt have to add any more flour.just make sure to keep the dough cold!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. I used 1/2 cup more flour, though I'm sure the 2 1/2 would have been fine, I'm just used to putting in around 3 cups for that size batch of cookies and did it out of habit. Cookies came out very flavorful and fluffy, soft, and not over crumbly like some turn out. Delish!"
"1","5","By far, the easiest and best Peanut Butter Cookie recipe I've ever tried!"
"1","4","I like this recipe but i added a extra cup of peanutbutter and 1\2 cup more flour also i did not have unsalted butter, so i used salted and reduced the salt to a heaping 1\4 teaspoon"
"1","2","So I followed everything on here but the time to bake was not good at all the cookies turned out to be hard and the taste was kind of burnt we did not like them but it was something i did for sure! next time i will be doing them at a lower temp...also they need to be watched very good! Tip: if your husband does not know anything about baking dont ask him to keep an eye on them! They may just turn out with a black bottom if so LOL"
"1","2","I like alot of the taste of peanut butter in my peanut butter cookies and this one just didn't have it."
"1","5","Came out great!!!"
"1","5","I did just as the recipe suggested, but I added a tsp. of nutmeg, vanilla, and cocoa. Very Good:)"
"1","5","these cookies were a hit for me.. i made them palm size and sold all of them at a function. I added almonds for crunch, the whole jar of smooth peanut butter, balled them and dipped them in granulated sugar before i flattened them out and pressed them out with a fork dipped in milk... yummo!"
"1","5","These turned out to be the most perfect cookies. I didn't review them right away but am reviewing them now because I'm about to make them again."
"1","5","I tweeked this to be a 'healthier' PB cookie. I did add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I substituted white sugar with Splenda and regular brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar, natural PB, Whole wheat flour and no salt and I have to admit they are very addictive! Husband and daughter are begging to make more."
"1","3","Was not impressed with theses cookies. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a light airy (almost cake-like) cookie, that was dry and crumbly. After tasting the first batch, I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more peanut butter and flour to the remaining dough. This gave it a slightly better flavor, but did nothing to improve the texture. I am giving this 3 stars simply because my 2 year old did enjoy them."
"1","5","Excellent cookies. I have been making Betty Crocker's for many years. This recipe is yummy too! I did add 1/2 cup more of flour and pb like some reviews suggested."
"1","4","i used all wheat flour...and i i used all natural peanut butter....they were good...1st time using the whole wheat......i like the idea of dipping in suger and adding vanilla."
"1","4","Good! Added 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup flour and 1 tsp vanilla. Don't need to chill before scooping out"
"1","5","This recipe was simple and my family LOVED the cookies! 2 Thumbs Up!!!"
"1","4","My roommates loved them, I found them a little heavy. I added an extra cup of peanut butter, and 1/4 extra cup of flour as people suggested and it turned out great. I softened the butter in the microwave, that made things easier."
"1","5","I just made these for my husband to take to work. Fantastic!! They were crisp on the outside and soft inside. After reading some reviews I did up the pb to 1 1/4 C and the flour to 3 C. Plus, I rolled the balls in sugar before doing the fork criss-cross thing. They were GREAT! nice job Shirley, thanks"
"1","5","The recipe was easy to put together from start to execution... The cookies came out great! Very pleased"
"1","5","I dumped the ingredients together and baked the dough immediately. I didn't sift the dry ingredients or cream the butters with the sugars. I didn't chill the dough. The cookies were delicous. Next time, I'll follow the directions."
"1","5","Followed others advice: an extra 1/2 cup of flower, an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter (used creamy), and a teaspoon of vanilla. Cooked 10 minutes at 375."
"1","5","These cookies are fabulous! Per other reviewers' recommendations, I increased the flour to 2 3/4 cups and peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups. I also used creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter to suit my family's tastes. The cookies came out beautifully - thick, soft and floury, not either crunchy or grease-moist like other recipes I've tried. They also didn't get crunchy around the edges after cooling, but stayed uniformly soft and chewy. I have made these several times, and they never last more than a day - my husband loves them! Thanks for a real keeper of a recipe!"
"1","4","We liked this recipe very much. I took the advice of user 'JenniferC77' and added an additional 1/2c of peanut butter, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Also added an additional 1/4c of flour. Boyfriend likes anything with peanut butter and chocolate, so made half batch with chocolate chips. Very yummy! Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
"1","5","I was had nothing to do so thought of trying this recipe and didnt know it would turn out to be so good.. really enjoyed every bit of cookies i made.. a recipe worth trying.. will be making these again and again.. :)"
"1","5","Very good recipe , although I made these without chilling the dough, just like my mother use to make these. very good!"
"1","5","The best Peanut Butter cookies I've ever had!!! I followed some of the suggestions for upping the flour and peanut butter by another 1/2 cup each ,and added 1 tsp. vanilla...I used creamy peanut butter(prefer)..and baked 11-13 minutes.They werent overbaked and stayed soft and alittle chewy.SOOO good! Have looked for a really good recipe for peanut butter cookies for many years,finally found it! Thanks for a really excellent recipe..Bravo!"
"1","5","perfect recipe! pull it out at 8 or 9 minutes if you like your cookies chewy, because they harden quickly after."
"1","3","A little dry..."
"1","5","I baked two dozen of these following the directions last night and the remaining two dozen the tonight baking only 9 minutes. I am now enjoying an outstanding cookie where as last night's cookies were a complete disappointment. Chilling the dough overnight and reducing baking time by one minute made all the difference."
"1","4","I took the advice and added 1/4 c extra PB and 1/4 c extra flour, couldnt be happier. I might try the 1/2 c next time, but these are still excellent."
"1","5","Leave slightly undercooked for chewy cookies. Good pnut flavor"
"1","5","I've made several versions of peanut butter cookies over the years, but these were by far the best. Nice balance of crispy and soft. I used 3 eggs instead of 2 1/2 and baked them for 12 minutes instead of 10. They are our favorite family cookie."
"1","5","very nice cookie - added 1/2 cup more peanut butter on second batch for a bit more pb taste!"
"1","5","Awesome, awesome cookies: An alternative: make homemade Peanut Butter Cup Cookies by making the cookies smaller, using a vanilla frosting between two cookies to sandwich them together. Then cover the top with a melted semi-sweet baking chocolate. Let cool. They are considered the best cookies in the world at my fiance's university!"
"1","5","i made it, it turned out great, thank you"
"1","5","My go to peanut butter cookie recipe."
"1","5","This recipe made the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had, ever. I doubled the amount of peanut butter for extra flavor and they were AMAZING. Will definitely make again."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! I don't like my cookies too sweet so I cut the sugars down to 3/4 cup each. Perfect! The only challenge I run into is that my husband and I always want to eat the dough before it's baked. The timing is key: I overbaked once by about one minute and it made all the difference in a chewy cookie and a dry, crackery cookie. I will continue to make these again and again!"
"1","5","PERFECT! Never made better peanut buttter cookies! My family was 'whoa'd'! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","Everyone loves these! They are the perfect sweetness, texture and have just the right amount of peanut butter, but you can add a bit if you like them extra peanut-buttery :) This recipe is much better than the ones using shortening, they taste perfect!"
"1","4","I decided to try out a new ingredient - white chocolate peanut spread in lieu of the peanut butter and the result was worth it."
"1","2","I was not impressed with these cookies. They were very crunchy even with reduced bake time. Also the flavor was a little blan. I will be looking for a better recipe. I was really dissapointed."
"1","5","Delicious and a Family favorite! I used creamy instead of chunky peanut butter and added a hint of vanilla and a little more flour. So yummy and so easy- This is a keeper!!!"
"1","4","awesome cookies, make sure you tinker with the recipe, I added more flour and a little less butter."
"1","5","I had just moved and did not have baking soda or powder when I made these but they still turned out delicious which is a true testament to the recipe. I added a drop of cinnamon extract and a drop of honey (I would take back the honey, though - it was too dark) to bring up the complexity just a bit. These cookies were top notch."
"1","5","My son in college loves for me to make these for him to take back to school. They keep them in the freezer and thaw when they're ready to eat. I didn't change a thing. Thanks for the best PBCookie recipe I have!"
"1","5","I just finished making these and they are grest and also did take the advice and added more peanut butter and flour and vanilla. Will keep this recipe and make more. Lee"
"1","5","Great peanut butter cookie recipe!! I did take the advice of others and added a little bit more flour and peanut butter. Also added one tsp vanilla. Was a bit hit with family and friends!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies. I used 20% less sugar than suggested (otherwise it's too sweet). I also added roasted skinned peanuts for extra crunch. Will definitely remake this."
"1","3","Too dry and crumbly. I like mine to be chewy."
"1","5","These were good! I followed a few others' reviews and added 1/2 c. more of both peanut butter and flour and they turned out fabulous! I also only cooked these at 350 instead of 375. I will definetely make these again!"
"1","5","I made these cookies and I was so excited. I added some chocolate chips and a bag of peanut butter chips. What I also did was forget to put the eggs in. I have to say, despite not having the eggs it was a pretty good cookie. I'm going to make them again, but this time with the eggs :)"
"1","4","This is a good starter recipe. I took the suggestions and added 1/2c of flour and 1/2c of PB and they were very soft. I also added some Reeses peanut butter chips and baked for 9 mins at 375. Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","I made these cookies and my family and co-workers loved them. I added 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and also for something different added M&M's. They were delicious."
"1","4","These cookies came out great. However, I changed the recipie a little. I cut down on sugar - 3/4 brown, 1/2 white - to make them less sweet. As for flour, I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose for more fiber. I used creamy peanut butter as I didn't have the crunchy one and I added vanilla extract (1 tsp) as suggested by other reviewers. I love them this way - they're not that sweet and they're a little healthier! Thank you!"
"1","4","Very good recipe for Peanut Butter cookies with a good serving amount. The dough in the fridge is a must. You can add broken peanuts to regular peanut butter with good results."
"1","5","Awesome!! I was brave and made a double batch the first time I made this recipe. They were so yummie. Everyone loved them and requested the recipe. I did follow other reviewers and added the extra flour and peanut butter."
"1","5","These are soooo...yummy! i added a bag of white chocolate chips and then dropped them by the tablespoon onto the cookie sheet. They were like white resse's."
"1","5","Awesome cookies, turned out perfectly. To avoid thin cookies make sure you refrigerate them, otherwise they will be thin. =) Awesome cookies!!!"
"1","5","I added a bag oc choc chips."
"1","5","OH. MY. HECK. No doubt the best peanut butter cookies I ever did eat! They kept real well and were soft even the next day. I did add about a fourth cup extra peanut butter but it could do without. It even made more than the two dozen it said it was! Although one thing that made it better was chocolate chips! Which I did after I made half the cookies."
"1","5","This is a great cookie recipe, 5 stars. The only thing I did differently was I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening (Crisco). I do that a lot with my cookie recipes. It makes a BIG difference I think,the texture is out of this world. It just melts in your mouth. Also my cookies only needed about 8 minutes. But this is by far the best peanut butter cookie recipe yet!!!"
"1","5","Great tasting dough, we also were lucky that any got cooked. I used Peter Pan Honey Roasted Crunchy. Also added 1tsp of vanilla. I like them fresh baked but friends I gave some to a week later said they were fantastic. I did not increase flour or peanut butter, just put them in the fridge for a while. I don't roll mine into balls, instead used the medium sized PC scoop, they baked up almost perfectly round, very nice."
"1","5","Hands down, best tasting cookie dough ever! My family was lucky there was enough dough left to bake! I did use 1/2C. extra peanut butter and flour as some suggested and, my son demanded 1C. semi-sweet chocolate chips. After about 30 minutes in the frig and 10 minutes in the oven, my cookies came out bite sized and fantastic. Everybody loved them; 5 dozen gone in two days. Thanks for a new family favorite"
"1","5","I didn't have brown sugar and they still came out fantastic! Thanks for the yummy recipe."
"1","5","I didn't have baking powder so I omitted it. I put 2/3 cup of butter instead. And I followed some reviewers comments to bake at 350 for exactly 9 minutes. They turned out great!"
"1","5","i loved the cookies they were still soft the next day like from the store. very good !!"
"1","5","Wonderful cookies! I made them exactly according to the recipe and they turned out perfect. The dough freezes well too!"
"1","5","My 13 year old son made these & they were sooo yummy. Will keep this recipe & make them again."
"1","5","great cookies-the whole family loved them."
"1","5","I loved these! I did add 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 cup extra flour and peanut butter. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before I forked them! I didn't have unsalted butter at home so I cut out the salt and used a little less baking soda and a little more baking powder. They were excellent."
"1","5","This cookies were DELICIOUS! I'm not even crazy about peanut butter, but these were fantastic! Just the perfect combination! I did listen to the advice of others, and add a few alterations. I added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1/2 cup of flour, and 1 tsp. of pure vanilla extract. I also added a medium sized bag of M&Ms! Mmmmmmmmm! These were amazing!"
"1","5","I added the extra flour and peanut butter, and they came out perfect. They had great line from the fork, the right amount of crunchy edges and chewy center. I also got created and rolled some out and used a squirrel cookie cutter dragging a fork over the tail section to make it look like fur. They were really cute but all crunchy, which was okay by me. Loved this so much!"
"1","5","This is THE best Peanut Butter cookie recipe!!! I did as other suggested and used an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter & 1/2 cup extra of flour, plus 1 tsp vanilla. SO good... TOO good... I can't stop eating them, and I usually have enough after one cookie. Will definitely make these again... my kids, husband and daycare kids all enjoyed these. Thank you for an amazing recipe!"
"1","5","YUM, this were terrific and made a good amount of cookies. Sent to work with my husband and everyone gobbled them up"
"1","5","These are fantastic!! I made a batch for my family and they loved them. Be sure to not overcook them, I found that the ten minutes was perfect and gave them a crispy outside and a softer center. Also make sure you chill the dough a bit. I too added some extra flour and peanut butter (about 1/4 cup of each) and rolled the balls in sugar before pressing them with a fork. Super rich and tasty!"
"1","3","Well this was a good base. I would make again but with my changes...I made as stated for 9 cookies but they were too crumbly for me and not peanut buttery enough. I added a 1/2 c peanut butter (used organic chunky), 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 c sugar, and another 1/3 stick butter. I did chill too. I also baked at 350 for 13 min on an airbake sheet (longer then a normal cookie sheet) Perfection! Made a lot- might cut in half next time- made 50 good size cookies (I did add to the mix). oops I added a capful of vanilla too!"
"1","3","Although, I decided to make a few tweaks to this recipe, it gave me the basis to create a great peanut butter cookie! I added 1 extra egg and a sprinkle of water because I did not like how dry the batter was. I eliminated the baking soda. If I had more peanut butter I would have probably added that before anything else. And I would suggest to add another half cup of peanut butter AT LEAST. Baked at 375 for 10 minutes! They stayed soft!"
"1","5","Perfect! Excellent texture and peanutty flavor. I used smooth peanut butter (and a little more than recipe calls for). Also, since I had salted butter on hand, I simply omitted the salt. Added a bag of chocolate chips--yummy. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper."
"1","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies we have ever tasted! Perfect flavor and texture! I did follow other suggestions of adding extra flour and peanut butter and we couldn't have been happier. Truly a no fail cookie!"
"1","5","By far the best peanut butter cookie recipie ever!!"
"1","5","Good, I cut the recipe in half cuz i didnt want so many cookies! I also added crushed peanut butter cups ( that i had left over from a recipe) and M & M's!"
"1","4","Excellent! I added the peanut butter using a 1/4C measuring cup, and made sure they were heaping quarter-cups. I also added an additional heaping quarter-cup. I didn't add any flour. (I was out of all-purpose, so I used cake flour and it worked just fine.) I baked them at 350 for exactly 10 minutes, without refigerating the dough, and they turned out just fine. They didn't seem 'done' when I took them out, but I let them sit for 10 minutes and they firmed up perfectly. Wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","Actually... very good. I made a gluten free version of this recipe. Everyone loved them!"
"1","5","I didn't have no-salt butter as the recipe says, so I used the regular and they were a bit salty. I added chocolate chips to the rest of the batter after I tasted the first batch and it made them taste really good as the chocolate went well with the extra salt. I rated these cookies a 5 star because if I would have made them with no salt butter, I wouldn't of had to add the chocolate chips."
"1","5","Excellent!!!!In Greece,we don't use so much peanut butter. So , we don't use it, not even for cookies. But that recipe proves how wrong we are. These cookies are really fantastic!!!I added some chocolate chips, which made them even more gorgeous!!Thank you!!!"
"1","2","Not very good. Maybe not enough peanut butter? Did taste better after they were a day old."
"1","5","With the suggested changes (additional 1/4 c pb & flour & 1 tsp vanilla) & my own change ( I used ALL whole wheat flour) these are the best PB cookies I've ever had! Very moist!!!!"
"1","5","excellent cookies I made them according to the receipe very light."
"1","5","perfect peanut butter cookies, I was delighted at how well they turned out for my christmas baskets :)"
"1","5","We LOVE this recipe and make it over and over. They are soft and moist!"
"1","4","This Recipe is very good. I took the advice of other reviews and added 1/4 C. more flour and 1/4 C. more peanut butter. I used salted butter and left out the 1/2 tsp. of salt and used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I also added a couple handfuls of cinnamon chips adn they turned out delicious"
"1","5","Classic is correct - these were perfect. I did take the suggestions of others and use 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter and 2 3/4 cups AP flour. I also added about 3/4 tsp. vanilla."
"1","5","These turned out nice and crisp on the edges and chewy on the inside. Easy and tasty."
"1","5","absolutely no need to add flour, just chill the dough properly and the cookies stay moist and thick. I did find that 350 for 9 min was just right. added 1/2 tsp. vanilla."
"1","5","excellent cookies. I found that they were overcooked at 10 minutes, 8.5 was perfect. I live at 800 feet above sea level, if that matters."
"1","5","This is a great peanut butter cookie. I took the advice of others and increased the peanut butter and flower 1/2c each and added vanilla. I also added a bag of peanut butter chips. My family loved them."
"1","5","I loved this recipe it was simple and yeilded delectable cookies. Just a couple tips, I like my cookies soft and moist in the inside but these cookies are actually better stiff. Otherwise the cookies don't taste like cookies but more like a spoonful of peanut butter. Also I baked them for 10 minutes on 350 F.I also rolled the balled dough in granulated sugar before pressing them down with a fork on the baking sheet.this kept them from sticking to the cookie sheet and gave them a more delicate texture in the end."
"1","5","My family loves this recipe, they ask me to make it all the time. I did not refrigerate the cookies because I heard that it makes it to hard, and my family LOVES soft cookies. I also added a some vanilla and extra peanut butter. Also I cooked the cookies for six to eight minutes. Instead of one cup of regular sugar and one cup of brown sugar I did 3/4 cup of regular sugar and 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I have been making this recipe for over a year now. I recommend this recipe to everyone!"
"1","5","This is the best ever peanut butter cookies recipe I have made so far.Mine turned out fudgy which my 5 year old son enjoyed."
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe. I used Peter Pan Honey Roast Crunchy Peanut butter and rolled the dough in granulated sugar before flattening them wiht a fork. The result was the perfect crispy, chewy PB cookie. Thanks for the perfect recipe!"
"1","2","Although the taste was ok the texture was rubbish! They were so cakey. Too much flour in my opinion! I did add coconut and that really brought them out. They were just too hard, crunchy and cakey."
"1","5","I can't stop Eatin' Em they are that good! I did read the other reviews and made the following changes. I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, changed half the butter to veg. shortening, added one teaspoon of vanilla, changed half the flour to whole wheat flour, used baking splenda instead of the white sugar and added one bag of milk chocolate chips. I than refrigrated the dough for 1 hour. I used a 1/4 measuring cup as a mold and press them a little with a fork. I bake them on parchment paper for 10 min and let them cool on the sheet for 5 more before placing on cooling rack. I was swatting my kids away after the first one. They had no idea of the healthy changes made to the recipe. They were soft, big and yummy!What can I say I like a big cookie with my coffee."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! Thanks. I chilled my cookie dough only 30 minutes due to anxiety, I couldn't wait to bake them. Exactly 10 minutes as a previous reviewer stated...these are perfect! I made them with choc. chips and with M&M's and Plain...great no matter what. I definately enjoy them as is with no chips or anything the best! Thanks again!"
"1","5","I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1 cup chocalate chips!!! Yummy!! I also refrigerated the dough for 1/2 an hour befor bakeing them.They were GREAT!!"
"1","4","This is a great recipe! I added a cup of chopped dry roasted nuts. I also used 1/2 cooking margerine and 1/2 real butter. I rolled some of them in plain sugar and some in cinnamon and sugar. They were a hit either way. Thanks!!"
"1","4","Instead of adding salt, i just used regular salted butter. I like peanut butter cookies when using butter instead of shortning. Their not so hard. I hate a hard cookie! lol very good."
"1","4","I just made these cookies. And like other reviewers said, I added more peanut butter and more flour (1/2 cup extra of each). While the flavor is amazing, the consistency is a little off. My cookies are a little crumbly and chewy. Didn't know that could happen, hahaha. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could."
"1","5","Wow! I actually made cookies, and didn't ruin them. These were awesome!!! They taste just like my mom used to make. I CAN wait until hubby gets home, he'll devore them all."
"1","4","1ST TIME I MADE PB COOKIES FROM SCRATCH AND THEY ARE REALLY GOOD"
"1","5","WOW! I made these for my bible study group and everyone couldn't get over how amazing the cookies were. I added oats to mine, and dipped the tops in sugar before pressing them with a fork. Like some others have said, they really don't look done when they are, in fact they seem downright uncooked but they harden up a good deal as they cool. But they're still perfectly chewy and moist! I'm going to use this recipe over and over, I'll just have to triple it next time!"
"1","5","I am eating these as I type! By far the best peanut butter cookie I have ever put in my mouth! I added more peanut butter and flour as others suggested and added 1/2 a bag of Reese's peanut butter chips - AMAZING!"
"1","5","YUMMY!!! These were so quick and easy to make. I prepared the dough which didn't take long at all. My 4 children couldn't wait the hour for dough to refrigerate so I made them in half hour. They were delicious and gone sooner than the time they took to cook...lol."
"1","5","loved this recipe. I also topped it off with chocolate sprinkles and the sugar, just amazing. Will make again and again!!!"
"1","5","I've been looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe -- these are the best I've ever tasted. I made a double batch for a church event, the next weekend I made a double batch for the family (me). EXCELLENT! Thanks for Sharing."
"1","5","I have always strayed away from pb cookies because as a kid I could never get the recipe just right. 14 years later I try again, with success! All I did differently was add a small amount of vanilla and rolled the 1 in. balls in sugar before pressing with a fork. I divided the dough in half and added mini chocolate chips to one batch and kept one as is. Baked for about 12 minutes. Fantastic!"
"1","5","everyone loved these cookies I also added more flour and more peanut butter. thank you very much."
"1","5","This is a easy recipe, with amazing results. I get special request to bring the peanut butter cookies to things. That to me means it deserves 5 stars!!! Only thing I do different is press my cookies down with a fork, when they are hot out of the oven and then sprinkle the hot cookies with sugar."
"1","5","I've never been a peanut butter cookie fan, but my Sweetie is. I decided to do something nice and make some just for him. This recipe is SOOO good. Reading other reviews I kind of sloppily measured the peanut butter and flour (a little more of each) and did add vanilla. I've been told by my husband and my two neighbors who covet peanut butter cookies, that these are the best they've ever had. I even like them. I've made them twice this week and will probably continue to do so on a regular basis. These really are very good."
"1","4","Followed recipe exactally and my husband and I found them to not be very peanut buttery, but still tasty enough."
"1","5","Finally! A peanut butter cookie recipe that tastes great, stays moist, and doesn't fall apart!"
"1","5","oh man these are good they melt in your mouth and boy i just love peanut butter cookies yumm-o"
"1","5","This recipe is absolutely amazing. I took advice from a few other reviews and added 1/4 C more peanut butter, 1/4 C more flour, and vanilla. Best cookies that I've ever had!! I've had nothing but raving compliments and requests for the recipe :)"
"1","5","These were great! The first time i made peanut butter cookies. Unfortunatley - I ate them all myself so much for my diet. A personal tip - add a box of vanilla pudding mix to the batter to keep the cookies soft forever!"
"1","4","This is a great recipie! it is really good. But i used the recipie that makes 24 cookies, we followed the directions and everything. But, it made 139 cookies. The cookies are delicous though."
"1","5","A GREAT recipe. I did add the extra 1/4c peanut butter and 1/4c flour. I purchased the creamy peanut butter by mistake, but had salted peanuts(1/2 cup) at home and put them in a mini chopper, then added them. I also made the balls slightly larger...YUMMY!!!"
"1","5","I did increase the flour and peanut butter as instructed by several other reviewers and the cookies were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect! Brought these to a party and everyone loved them!"
"1","5","Great recipe! I added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and a 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe on suggestion of a few other users. I also added a bit of cinnamon, as I do to most of my recipes. I baked my cookies for 9 minutes, and they were just the perfect golden color on the bottom and just barely around the edges. It's a great dough, and a smooth cookie, but it just crumbles and melts in your mouth. Thanks for the deeeelicious recipe!"
"1","5","These are exactly like the peanut butter cookies that I always make, except for these changes: 3 cups flour (not 2 1/2 cup) 1/2 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cup peanut butter - it does make them more crumbly, but it gives them a wonderful peanut butter flavor.  This recipe makes DELICIOUS peanut butter cookies! (can add chocolate chips, if desired) =) :) 8)"
"1","5","I had mislaid my mum's recipe, and this one was an exact match. Great flavor and best if pulled out just before done. I use the Crisco butter sticks instead of butter and it seems to be better."
"1","5","Awesome! I didn't change a thing. My whole family really enjoys this recipe. Thanks!!"
"1","5","Awesome awesome awesome! I love these so much and everyone I make them for has fallen in love with them. They taste better than any store bought peanut butter cookies I've ever had. Each time I make it I add some thing new, whether its tiny m&ms, or semi-sweet chocolate/white chocolate chips. I love this recipe! *Thanks for posting it*"
"1","5","As other reviews said I put 1/4 cup more of flour as well as peanut butter. Made super yummy cookies!"
"1","5","Very good! I also added the extra 1/2 c of both peanut butter and flour and the vanilla. Just when I thought they couldn't get any better, I added chocolate chips the next night to the remaining dough. Yum! I didn't need to refridgerate the dough before forming the balls. I also rolled them in sugar. All in all, two thumbs up!"
"1","4","Very good recipe. I cut the all purpose flour in order to use some whole wheat flour -- 1.5 cups whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose flour. And, I used cashew butter instead of peanut butter...so, I guess, they're really not peanut butter cookies afterall...cashew butter cookies...they turned out great! My 4 year old loves them!"
"1","4","these spread out A LOT. i don't think an hour to refrigerate them is enough because the last batch came out way better than the first. i would probably just refrigerate it overnight and bake them the next day, instead. other than that, they're delicious. i used all-natural peanut butter, which gave them an awesome peanut butter taste. i didn't pack the brown sugar that much because one cup is a bit much. i lightly packed it into my measuring cup. good cookies, overall."
"1","5","Made these last week and loved them. And I'm not even a big peanut butter cookie fan!"
"1","5","awesome peanut butter cookies, soft and chewy. i used creamy peanut butter because i'm not a big fan of little crunchy bits in my pb cookies. 2 tips however. the dough is very sticky, so it's a good idea to dip your fork in some flour before pressing them down for the 'classic pb cookie' markings. also, depending on your oven it's wise to watch the browning around the 8-9 minute mark on the timer. in my oven, 9 1/2 minutes made for the perfect;y browned cookie"
"1","5","Really easy recipe and really good. I didn't have shortening for the classic recipe and found this one and i LOVE IT. I will use this one again and again.  thank you"
"1","5","great,I added 1/2 cup extra peanut butter and 1/2 cut extra flour. Cook 375 for 10 min, exactly and NO more then that."
"1","5","Great recipe! I used reduced fat creamy peanut butter instead and only had salted butter so skipped on adding the salt. Like others I added some sugared sprinkles on top of some and for something different used pumpkin pie spice on top of others. Delicious, thank you!"
"1","5","I made them for my mom and my little brother and we all loved them."
"1","5","Very Good!"
"1","5","Will definitely make this again. Do not overbake! Take out of the oven when slightly golden at the edges."
"1","5","Very good. Made a gluten free version and they were out of this world. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Amazing cookies! Very soft, even next day! I used natural smooth peanut butter and it gave it a great flavor! Per other reviewers, I also increased the flour and peanut butter a bit and only cooked it for 8 minutes at 375. I was amazed at how good they turned out!"
"1","5","Really great. I made most of the changes as per other reviewers, but I usually add my own touches to baked items. I know this makes it your own recipe, really, but this site always had great starter recipes. I love a soft cookie, so I baked at 350 for 7-8 minutes and they stayed soft and yummy!!"
"1","5","My husband loved these! These had just the right amount of sweetness, but I still rolled them in sugar before baking."
"1","4","I actually give this a 4 1/2! Great cookies, everyone loved them. The first time I made them exactly as the recipe called for. The second time I omitted the salt and added some chopped salted peanuts....this was really yummy!"
"1","5","Great Cookies! Only adjustment I made was adding more 1/2 cup more peanut butter since it was all that was left in the jar. Came out perfectly."
"1","5","I made several batches of these and took the leftovers to work about 3 days after I made them and people raved about how good they were and they were still soft--I kept them in ziploc bags. My husband asked me to make more tonight so we can give them to the firemen at our neighborhood fire station--wink wink."
"1","5","These have to be the best cookies ever! I made them with regular peanut butter and didnt refrigerate the dough, rolled the balls in white sugar and pressed it down with the fork like the recipe says...rolling the dough in sugar really makes the cookie...i already ate the first batch, so now im on my second!"
"1","3","recipe was o.k.not very peanut buttery tasting.I'll try using natural peanut butter next time."
"1","5","This was an amazing Peanut Butter Cookie recipe! My dad is a huge fanatic when it comes to his PB cookies and these were a huge hit since they stayed chewey for days after baking. I did take the advice of a few reviews and increased the flour, decreased the baking temp & time, and I also rolled the cookies in white sugar before placing on the sheet to keep them from spreading too much.  All in all, a definite keeper!"
"1","5","Best ever"
"1","4","Great cookies, minor alterations. I added 1/4c. extra flour and 1/4c. extra peanut butter and 1/4 tsp vanilla. Rolled the cookies in white sugar before putting on baking sheet for extra appeal. I like my cookies soft, so I baked them at 350 for 8 min. YUMMY! Follow this and you will LOVE EM!"
"1","4","These were good. I didn't refrigerate as outlined as I didn't have time and they still came out good. I also did not increase peanut butter or flour and the cookies were not flat. I will make these again. I think I will roll in sugar next time I make them."
"1","4","Nothing but rave reviews from family and friends on this recipe. I would have rated this cookie recipe with five stars but I had to add flour, vanilla extract and peanut butter as others suggested. I will be making these cookies for Christmas, that is how much these cookies are loved!"
"1","5","I also increased flour and peanut butter by 1/2 cup as suggested,This is a really great cookie"
"1","5","this is a terrific cookie. I make them for bake sales and they go fast. Don't try to substitute with regular butter. They just don't come out right. The crunchy peanut butter just makes them terrific, although I have used creamy and they are good. Great recipe!"
"1","5","I really liked these cookies. They came out perfectly for me. Would recommend."
"1","4","After a few cookie recipe disappoinments I was pleased when this one worked! I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter as suggested by other readers - and it worked perfectly, I also dipped the cooled cookies in melted milk chocolate - so good!"
"1","5","Mhhm! These cookies were delicious, I added extra flour and peanut butter like others suggested.. and added chocolate chips! My entire floor in my apartment building smelled sooo good! (I hope nobody has peanut allergies.. lol) Definitely a keeper!"
"1","4","I made these tonight to use for snack time for a preschool class I'm teaching tomorrow. It was a good recipe, but wasn't peanut buttery enough for me. I used margarine instead of butter. I added an extra cup of peanut butter, an extra cup of white sugar, about a 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. It probably still could have used a little more vanilla but I ran out. It was a little oily, so I added a cup of oats to help soak up the oil. That gave it a nice texture. I rolled it in sugar and chopped semisweet chocolate and flattened it with a potato masher. I have a gas oven that tends to cook more quickly than others and I baked the cookies at 350 F for about 7 minutes each, and then allowed them to cool for about 10 minutes before removing them from the pan. I formed 2 inch balls and got 21 cookies. They are yummy, though like I said, I think they could have used a little more vanilla. Next time I think I will make the cookies a little smaller than an inch as the 2 inch ones ended up being too much cookie for me, but they are very very good."
"1","5","This is a great peanut butter cookie recipe.They turned out just like my Grandma used to make them!!"
"1","5","This recipe was fantastic! I used an extra 1/4 c. of peanut butter and 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Excellent!"
"1","5","Excellent! Easy to make and no muss either."
"1","2","I found this recipe very very greasy- we made a half batch and it was literally swimming in oil. I have never added butter along side peanut butter, its just too much oil! If I made these again I would consider adding more flour and not adding the butter."
"1","5","These were awesome!! I froze the dough for a week and they were perfect. My mom even commented them saying they were like cookies bought from the store. :]"
"1","5","Hands down the best peanut butter cookie I've tasted! Cookie is light, crisp on outside, and chewy inside, not too peanuty, delicious!!"
"1","5","These cookies are great! I added a teaspoon of vanilla. Then I accidently used the measurement for the baking soda for the baking powder. Even with my mistake, they still were delicious! I also used a sugar coated glass bottom to flatten the cookies instead of the fork. This recipe is a keeper!"
"1","5","Great basic recipe!. I added a few things to call it my own. 1 teaspoon vanilla, ran out of chunky peanut butter and regular butter, so I added a 1/2 cup of dry roasted unsalted peanuts I had and margarine. I normally do not substitute margarine for butter..But in a pinch to brighten up my husbands day he tells me I 'can make these any time!'  Works for me! It was a hit!  Thank you!"
"1","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies! My 4 year old loved helping me make criss-crosses on the cookies. We also sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking. Yummy!"
"1","5","***Update: Made these again as the recipe states. I added a little more peanutbutter and a little more flour as many reviews suggested. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. They were so good that when my boyfriend took them to work his boss offered to buy a dozen more. Now that's a good Classic Peanut Butter Cookie! ***  Original review: I made these cookies tonight and it was a complete failure. But that was due to my own stupidity rather than the recipe.   I ended up using NO brown sugar at all, so I cut the recipe in half. The result was a very crumbly cookie with a slightly saltier flavor than a normal cookie. The cookies were SUPER crumbly. I thought maybe it was because peanut butter adds extra fat, thus extra crumblyness. Also my second batch (I didn't know about the sugar until a few minutes ago) I made smaller.... and they totally burned even though I put them on for a minute less.   However despite all the craziness in the kitchen tonight, the unburnt cookies STILL turned out tasty and no one complained, or even noticed after they set for a while. So I gave them five stars."
"1","5","I ran out of white sugar, so I doubled the brown sugar. I added 1/2 a tsp. of vanilla, 4 extra Tbsp. of PB, and a 1/4 tsp. of ground cinnamon. Also, I used creamy PB instead of crunchy. Perfect!"
"1","5","very good, it almost had a taste of a sugar cookie, i loved them! and i don't even like peanut butter folks!"
"1","4","i chose a last minute peanut butter recipe because i lost mine... i have to say i believe this recipe is better than the recipe i lost.. thanks"
"1","5","I baked this recipe last night. It was great. My husband can't stop eating them. I baked one pan with 12 min. It turned out to be crunchy PB cookies -- great taste. Love it!"
"1","5","These cookies came out perfectly with the addition of a tbs of vanilla extract. Dense, chewy, and flavorful...I used JIF creamy peanut butter, sprinkled them with course sugar and baked them just until the tops were dry. Thank you for this simple, tasty cookie recipe!"
"1","5","I find this recipe to be a bit mild for my taste. For a stronger peanut butter taste, double the salt. To get the right consistency, sift 2c of flour and the rest of the dry ingredients into the bowl and integrate as normal. Add the last half cup 1/6 (or so) at a time. Stop when the dough balls around the mixer blade/spoon and pull away from the sides of the bowl. I usually wind up using about 2 1/4 cups of flour."
"1","5","Awesome PB cookies!! I never buy unsalted butter so I used salted butter and they turned out just as good as my mom's recipe that I lost! Thank you so much for the great, simple, easy to make PB cookie recipe!"
"1","4","Too much sugar for my liking. Based on previous experience, I usually have to cut the sugar down by at least a 1/3. And I prefer my cookies crunchier, so I left it in the oven longer."
"1","4","These were just like Mom used to make! I took advice and added a little more peanutbutter and they came out delicious! Will definitley make these again!"
"1","4","ok good if you put chcolate chips in it"
"1","5","I loved this recipe! The cookies are perfect. My husband says this is the best peanut butter cookie he has ever had! I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble at all."
"1","2","These were not a family faveorite. In a household were a batch of cookies hardly lasts a day these are still here after 3 days. I don't know if I pressed the cookies down to hard with a fork but, they are very crumbly/ a lot of them broke. I put the dough the fridge for the time stated and the dough was hard to work with it seemed very dry, The consistancy prior to putting into the fridge was better. I followed the recipe exactly except I only had smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy. I don't know what I did wrong. I will search for another recipe."
"1","5","YUM! I read through so many of the peanut butter cookie recipes and I am glad I chose this one. I doubled the recipe and it made 10 dozen cookies! I used one whole jar (16.3 oz) of creamy peanut butter. Out of 5 cups of flour, I used one cup of whole wheat and it is not noticeable in the taste or texture. My freezer is now full of cookies for school lunches."
"1","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies I have tasted! I used natural chunky peanut butter, and they turned out even better!!"
"1","5","Very moist, delicious cookie! I wouldn't change a thing! My family LOVED these."
"1","5","My family loved this recipe! I might try adding a little more peanut butter next time. :-)"
"1","5","Big Hit! Delicious, best peanut butter cookies I ever made!"
"1","4","I read the previous reviews and added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter. Cookies turned out very moist and didn't flatten out at all - but I did turn the temp up to 200C."
"1","5","This was great and easy to make. I burn water so when my husband said he liked them I knew I had hit gold!"
"1","5","My daughter described it as the best cookie ever!"
"1","3","These cookies were ok. I did follow the recipe and my cookies turned out crispy and as flat as silver dollar pancakes. Although, I did notice after the fact that the dough should have been refrigerated for an hour before baking...would that have made a difference?"
"1","5","Great peanut butter cookie recipe! I used a little more peanut butter (organic crunchy) and flattened them with a glass dipped in sugar. Yummy!"
"1","5","The best ever! Thanks! I dipped some in melted milk chocolate chips and a little shortening... very good!"
"1","4","Very very good peanut butter cookies. Crisp edges, tender centers. Mild peanut butter flavor. Really good recipe. Makes a good cookie."
"1","5","This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe i've tried out so far. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter on hand, so I used creamy, and it makes the cookie perfect. i finished backing about three minutes ago and I've already eaten four cookies!"
"1","2","I've been using the same peanut butter cookie recipe for 20 years and decided to try something new with this one. I was very disappointed. The presentation and consistency was good but the taste was not. Very little peanut butter taste to these cookies but if you really LOVE butter than these are for you."
"1","4","Just as good as my Betty Crocker recipe. I would have enjoyed them more if they were a little moister."
"1","4","they were really easy to make, but i overcooked them.. but it was probably my fault , next time ill bake for 8 minutes instead of 10, our oven is very hot. they taste really good but just alittle dry and could use a bit more peanut butter. all in all, they were very soft and filled my craving! thanks for the recipe:)"
"1","5","My first batch turned out a little more crunchy than I like but they were still a hit from kids to adults. The second batch I made I substituted 3/4 cup honey for the 1 cup of sugar and baked them for about 15 min at 350. The dough isn't as firm so they are more of a drop cookie but they turned out fantastic."
"1","2","i didn't like this very much. the cookie was very dry, and no one really wanted to eat it."
"1","4","I used salted butter & creamy peanut butter, baked them at 350 for 8 minutes and they were YUMMY! I baked my first batch on 375 for 9 minutes and they were too dry & crunchy but my second batch was soft & buttery & delicious. I took them to work & they were gone in no time. I'll make these again soon!"
"1","4","It was quite nice, however i used 2 cups of flour, 1 1/4 PB and i used my hands to roll it into a ball, pressed it down with a fork. However, while mixing everything up together it was very crumbly. I halfed the recipe but used 2 eggs. It turned out pretty well. Peace xD"
"1","3","i made these cookies with a lot of hope, especially since the recipe was rated as a 5 star and everyone raved about it. the cookies came out for me as they did for some other users- crumbly without much substance. i followed the directions, adding 1/2c more peanut butter, and they still came out very dry. i made one test batch of cookies, and most of them crumbled coming off the baking stone, even after cooling. i just put the rest of the dough in a 13 x 9 to see if they make better peanut butter bars."
"1","5","i used slightly more PB as others suggested, and wheat flour. they're great!"
"1","3","These turned out a bit hard and not peanuty enough for me. Just okay."
"1","5","Great recipe. I followed other's suggestions and added more peanut butter and cooked them no longer than ten minutes. They were perfect."
"1","5","Peanut Buttery Deliciousness"
"1","5","I used whole wheat flour, splenda, natural (chunky)peanut butter and didn't add salt. I like softer cookies so I cooked for 8.5 minutes instead of 10. Recipe is great; one of my favorites. Thanks!"
"1","5","These are THE BEST peanut butter cookies! Moist, chewy and yummy! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Just made a few batches of these-they are wonderful. I used Crisco instead of butter and added 1 tsp vanilla. Also added sugar to the balls before pressing as suggested by other reviews. Great cookie"
"1","5","These cookies are perfect!! It's amazing that these cookies are such a hit from generation to generation."
"1","5","Very easy and tasty cookies. The kids love them and so do the adults. Very soft and chewy!"
"1","4","Very good. Very easy to make, I used creamy peanut butter though. I wanted a chewier cookie, that's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I think I probably would try another recipe next time."
"1","5","I didn't change anything on this recipe. If you roll them, put them on the cookie sheet then use a fork to flatten them they come out perfect! I've made them several times."
"1","5","Fabulous. Into my recipe box and emailed to all my friends! By far THE BEST peanut butter cookie I've ever made or eaten. Anyone who didn't like this recipe didn't make it right."
"1","5","Yummy! I used extra crunchy JIF peanut butter and cut down the salt in half. Totally necessary if you're using salted peanut butter. Mm, next time I might try some chocolate chips too!"
"1","4","This was a very good peanut butter cookie. I have had better only once and I never got the recipe! So I've been searching for my favorite peanut butter cookie. I would definately try this one again. The kids and friends loved them. I froze half of the batch for a later date. I changed the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups as did others. That worked out very well. I also used 100% whole wheat flour instead of white as I do with all my baked goods. Finally, I cut the white sugar by 1/4 cup, this always goes unnoticed."
"1","5","Super PB cookie. I added about 1/2 a cup of white choc chips and 1/2 cup of PB Chips. YUM!!! I am no PB cookie conniseur, but I loved it. I also added about 1/4 cup of extra PB and added some extra flour at the end to make the dough a little drier and less sticky. It was probably a total of about 1/4 c. of extra flour. ENJOY THIS EXCELLENT COOKIE"
"1","5","I was looking for a simple peanut butter cookie recipe and these turned out excellent! Highly recommended."
"1","5","This cookie was great! I reduced the baking time by 2 minutes and added another 1/4 cup of peanut butter. They disappeared before I could really enjoy them! Everyone loved them!"
"1","4","These were pretty good - a little dry, though. Not sure how to remedy that, as I am more of a 'cooker' than a 'baker'! Maybe more PB? Dropped some Skor bits on top to give them an extra flavour."
"1","4","These cookies were good, not THE BEST EVER, but very good. Following the advice of others, I added 1/2 cup more of peanut butter and flower. I don't know how the addition of these ingredients helped or hurt these cookies."
"1","5","Great cookies with just the right amount of Peanut Butter Flavor. I baked in my convection oven at 365 degrees for 8 minutes and they came out wonderful!!!"
"1","4","Crunch peanut butter makes this reciepe. My cookies were gone in one day!"
"1","5","These were the first PB cookies I've ever made.. and I will probably never try another recipe. These soft, chewy cookies were liked by all."
"1","5","Very good and easy to make.11"
"1","4","Very good, but a little dry, will bea dding 1/2 cup extra peanut butter and then I'm sure it'll be delicious. Thanks for a good recipe. Also, I only needed to cook mine 8 mintues or else they would have burned."
"1","5","those cookies turned out great! I'll make them again next week :) thanks for this wonderful recipe!"
"1","4","these tasted pretty ok though they spread out quite a bit so i ended up with a very flat cookie, i did not like that too much. i ended up using a 1/2 cup more peanut butter as people suggested and it seemed to be a good amount. not my very favorite but i've noticed that a lot of peanut butter cookie recipes are so similar that they all taste pretty much the same."
"1","5","I made these cookies last year for Christmas. They were both soft and crispy and were full of peanut butter taste; they reminded me of the peanut butter cookies I loved as a child. My husband, son and I finished them in a matter of days. Absolutely terrific!"
"1","4","Nice cookies.... a little crumbly and dry.... great with a glass of milk. Very tasty!!!!!!"
"1","5","Excellent, chewy, tasty and yummy! Added a little extra p.b. and choc. chips and they were delicious! Thanks."
"1","5","I was in a baking mood one day but low on everything except the essentials. I supplemented white sugar as I was out of brown and left out the salt but the cookies still came out fantastically. I also had to keep them in the gas oven for a few minutes more. Have had many requests to make more! Thanx so much for this easy, quick and versatile recipe!"
"1","4","I was in a baking mood last evening but was out of chocolate chips for my favorite cookies. So, who doesn't have peanut butter in their cupboard, right? However, I didn't have enough butter so I supplemented with shortening. They were really good. This is a 'keeper'"
"1","4","I think more peanut butter should be added to the recipe, because it tasted faintly of PB, but not really as much taste as i'd like. The consistency is excellent though."
"1","4","BEEEE prepared, these spread a lot! The flavor is good but I'm more used to thick, chewy peanut butter cookies."
"1","5","Great recipe! They don't last long at my house!"
"1","5","Fantastic! Very easy and I don't bake!Mrs Miller"
"1","5","These cookies were the best peanut butter cookies I ever made!!!!!! The whole 4 dozen were gone in 2 days!"
"1","5","These are the best I've ever made! Great cookies!"
"1","4","Very nice recipe for anyone who loves peanut butter!"
"0","4","Added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter and flour. Needed to bake at least 13-14 minutes per my oven"
"0","5","These are my new favorite PB cookie recipe. The family loves them too!"
"0","5","Great cookies!!! I did what Natalie66 did. I changed the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup flour. Also, I used salted butter so I cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Very moist and soft cookie! I cooked them for 8 1/2 mins. I did the criss cross with my fork dipped in sugar. Thanks so much for sharing!"
"0","5","Very good recipe :)"
"0","5","Really great! Used 3 cups of flour and 1tsp vanilla. Yum!!"
"0","5","These cookies my family begs me to make. They are easy to make and taste so buttery. I cooked them exactly like the it said and they look like the picture. Love them !"
"0","5","I would bake them for only 8 minutes and do not be afraid to take them out even if the top does not look cooked. If you leave them for longer the bottom will harden and burn a little."
"0","5","I've made PLENTY of PB cookies in my many years of baking...& this recipe is my above & beyond Favorite one!! You just HAVE TO take them out of the oven when they're just starting to get a bit crispy on the edges. They WILL be soft, but, just leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before trying to lift them (I use a spatula, like I use for my pancake flipping, either the small one or my larger one, depending on the size of the cookie I make.) These are my husband's absolute favorite cookie... So, I make them @ LEAST once or twice a month!!! (Sometimes to fancy them up a bit...or, if I feel like it), I'll dip half of each cookie in some melted chocolate chips... either dark or white ones.... Yummy!"
"0","5","I took another reviewer's suggestion and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, and baked at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes; Refrigerated overnight; rolled into balls and had my daughter (age 3.5) roll the balls in sugar and press them with a fork (she did remarkably well btw). Don't roll/sugar/press too many minutes before cooking, otherwise the sugar you roll will start to get too wet and won't give you that sugary taste after cooking. I was impressed how they turned out, just a little crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. To make sure you don't over cook them (or any cookie really) - the top of the cookie will go from wet looking to 'dry'. I used to look for the golden sides, but honestly, this technique has baked many batches of cookies with that awesome taste of soft Otis store bought type cookies."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe. I use natural peanut butter (made with peanuts and salt only) instead of Jif, and my one cup of peanut butter is a heaping over flowing cup! I find that they don't flatten as much if you refrigerate the dough overnight."
"0","2","They look fine, just not much peanut butter flavor."
"0","5","These were yummy peanut butter cookies! I did not have chunky peanut butter, but I did have salted caramel peanut butter. This special peanut butter gave these cookies a crisp outside and a chewy inside...perfection!"
"0","4","A great yield, and soft moist cookies."
"0","4","very good! Next time I might add more peanut butter. I only had creamy so I will try the crunchy next time too."
"0","4","I made the peanuts butter cookies and it fun easy and very tastes. Love it"
"0","5","This is the perfect peanut butter cookie. Didn't make any changes. My husband loved them. Thanks!!!"
"0","5","After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter (smooth) & 1/2 cup of flour & baked them for about 12 minutes, at 10 minutes they were still a it doughy, & they were perfect. This recipe makes way more than 24. I baked 24 & had more than half of the cookie dough left! Wrapped the rest in aluminum foil & put in the freezer for a rainy sweet tooth day"
"0","5","Best PB cookie recipe. Taste great!!"
"0","5","Best peanut butter cookies ever! This recipe replaced the one I used for many years. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter so used creamy and added 1/2 cup chopped peanuts. Yum!"
"0","5","I didn't wanna make the fork marks on them so I didn't and they weren't flat so that's less dishes to dirty and less ingredients to use too"
"0","4","These were delicious cookies! I see a lot of people having issues with their cookies being too flat. Try using Bakers Flour in lieu of All Purpose (Yes, still include the additional leavening ingredients.) Outside of a different flour, I added an additional 1/2 C of both flour and peanut butter and a bag of mini Reese's bits. I spread the dough out into a 9x13 baking dish, covered with cellophane and let sit in the fridge for about 3 hrs. Rolled into 1' balls and lightly cross crossed with a fork dipped in granulated sugar. In our oven, we baked 1 dozen at a time for 12 min and they came out perfect! They only spread just a tad so we got a 1/2' thick cookie that is a little crispy outer shell and a soft & chewy center. Will definitely use this recipe again."
"0","2","They were ok, I guess."
"0","5","These peanut butter cookies are great! My family just couldn't stop snacking on the crumbs! I definitely recommend these for anyone except for people who are allergic."
"0","4","I have had it before,and i really liked them, this is the 4th time i've made these! I really like them! :)"
"0","3","I followed the recipe exactly. The texture was fine. I did not have runny, flat cookies like others mentioned. However, I couldn't really taste much peanut butter. Maybe it was the generic brand peanut butter - not sure."
"0","5","I was looking for a go-to peanut butter cookie recipe. Following the recipes exactly, I made a batch of these and Joey's Peanut Butter cookies, also on All Recipes, and took them to work. Of the 30 people who participated in my taste test, they came out at a tie. But by the end of the day though, the Joey's were breaking apart while this Classic Peanut Butter Cookie was holding its shape in the zip lock. As they were tied for taste, this is now my go-to peanut butter cookie because it held up better for transporting."
"0","5","Followed reciepe exact. Very good very light nice crunch. 2nd time added vanilla and still turned out great. Were gone just about the same time I finished making them. Everyone loved them."
"0","5","great recipe, followed as directed"
"0","5","Best peanut butter cookie recipe ever! The family love it when I make these!"
"0","4","They were good, but a bit short. I'm gonna add the flour and peanut butter suggested by the others next time."
"0","5","I followed some other reviews and increased the amount of flour and peanut butter by 1/2 cup and baked for 9 minutes. They are delicious!!!"
"0","5","Yes! I've made these cookies and I also increased the flour and the peanut butter!! They were awesome!!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe as written- except that I halved it. The cookies turned out perfectly!"
"0","5","I don't ever write reviews but these were amazing! I took the suggestions of other reviews and upped the flour and peanut butter because I like a soft cookie. I brought these to a party and people went crazy over them!"
"0","5","I did this with almond butter dipped in sugar with pecans pressed in way good"
"0","4","Easy. not too sweet. My son, the one who made them, added a few dark chocolate m&ms on top."
"0","5","As did other reviewers, I added a half cup more pb and a quarter cup more flour. I didn't have an hour to chill so I stuck the dough in the freezer and mixed it up a couple times to cool quicker. I also didn't have unsalted butter so I added less salt and I added a touch of vanilla. I dipped the tops of the 'balls' in sugar before I pressed them with the fork. I ended up cooking them about 12.5 minutes and kept an eye on them in 30 second intervals to ensure they were just starting to get a hint of color but I don't think I will even do that next time. I think mine could have been taken out at 11 minutes, maybe 11.5 if you want to get that technical. No issues with flat cookies."
"0","4","This recipe was absolutely fabulous! Like most reviews i guess this one calls for a couple more grams of flour. I tried this egg-less with 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the resulting cookies were absolutely divine! This one's going in my recipe book!"
"0","5","I made these just as the recipe states except for adding 1 tsp of vanilla. Baked for 8 minutes, and they are of perfect consistency and are delicious. This is now my 'go to' peanut butter cookie recipe. Crisp yet chewy. Thanks, Shirley, for sharing."
"0","4","I liked them allot. they are very sweet. I think I will add less sugar and more peanutbutter next time and adjust the flour. very good all and all"
"0","5","These were awesome. I added a little more PB and a little more flour though, and they came out great!"
"0","5","I switched out the sugar with Splenda Blend and they were great!"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing as is. I was a pb cookie virgin, but I made this using typical cookie approach: cream fat/sugars/eggs for 5-10 minutes to help make fluffy cookies. I sifted my flour, didn't even bother refrigerating the dough, and used am ice cream scooper to make balls (so that the dough was handled very minimally), made slight fork marks and baked 10-11 minutes on a silpat. Hole"
"0","5","A simple recipe that my son actually likes. No more box cookies for me. Thanks Shirley!"
"0","3","Not sweet enough to me. If I make it again I'll add more sugar and a bit more peanut butter. (I also prefer chewy cookies this is soft not chewy)"
"0","2","taste good, but too crumbly"
"0","3","What did I do wrong, consistency gritty, help?"
"0","5","Made these following some of the suggestions above. Increased peanut butter and flour both by 1/4 cup, and added 2 teas vanilla to wet ingredients. Rolled balls in vanilla sugar, flattened and used fork to do criss-cross pattern. Baked at 350 for 10-11 minutes, came out very nice. Slighlty crispy and chewy. Will make again. (Also added dark chocolate chips to 1/2 of the dough - they turend out really good!)"
"0","5","Easy and so peanutty. Made it exactly as written and now it's in my cookie rotation."
"0","5","My family loved these! I mistakenly added an extra egg. It made the batter a little softer than it probably should have been but it made the cookies nice and soft."
"0","5","I followed the recipe except I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy (which I didn't have on hand). I think that the people who feel a need to add more peanut butter might not be using crunchy. With the actual pieces of peanut in the cookie, it would enhance the peanut flavor. I'll use crunchy next time. I chilled the dough for an hour and the cookies spread the perfect amount. Not flat at all, perfectly round, no need to add more flour."
"0","5","Love this recipe I make them a little bigger and after they come out of the oven I sprinkle them with a little vanilla sugar."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. My husband and his co-workers love them! Just wondering though... It says it makes 4 dozen. I got over 6 dozen the last time I made them. Has that happened to anyone else?"
"0","1","my son was disappointed because of how flat these cookies were. Do not try this recipe."
"0","4","I liked this recipe but knew that a lot of people were experiencing overly thin cookies. To help with this I used half shortening and half butter, being sure the butter wasn't overly soft. I also used half a cup extra peanut butter and a tablespoon of vanilla extract to improve the flavor. The fork pattern was a nice touch and as long as you don't flatten them too much it'll be fine, keep in mind they are meant to spread a bit in the oven"
"0","5","Made these 3 times in one month already! About have this one memorized, fast easy and supper yummy!!"
"0","5","Great cookies. Used same measurements. I cooked them on a stone. Flattened them a little with the fork but they came out perfectly, not to thin and they are chewy. I took them out as the recipe said when they started to brown."
"0","5","Delicious! I didn't change a thing. An absolute classic."
"0","5","These were perfect!"
"0","4","My kids loved them. The trick is to bake them to at 180C for just 8 mins and let them stand in the oven. The heat will make them just right on the top with gooey inside. My kids lapped them up so quick."
"0","5","Perfect. I didn't change a thing and never will. Got SO MANY compliments on these. And to top it off, the recipe is easy!"
"0","5","Fabulous cookie. Didn't change a single thing."
"0","5","This recipe was just stupid good! 8 million stars! We halved the recipe and I accidentally put more baking powder than it call for (oops) but they came out PERFECT! This is for sure, no doubt MY LAST RECIPE for peanut butter cookies! We cooked them exactly 10 minutes - Perfect! We then scooped them into mini muffin tins and added chocolate and rolo's and cooked them 11 minutes and they were perfect! Thanks for the recipe! BRAVO!"
"0","5","These were delicious! I added a little more peanut butter and flour like recommended by other users and a dash of vanilla and they turned out great! My boyfriend said he loved them."
"0","5","Have made these several times. The last time was for a party and everyone loved them. No need to change anything. They are just perfect if you follow the directions."
"0","5","Just the way my mom made them."
"0","4","Great recipe! Be careful though, they burn easily. I added mini peanut butter cup, they're delish!"
"0","5","I didn't make any changes to the recipe and everyone ranted about how delicious they were. Definitely do not overbake as the recipe states in the instructions."
"0","4","Well, I mixed it up... One stick of butter instead of 2, no baking soda, skipped refrigeration etc. When first batch came out, I thought they were very bland. So I added vanilla, cinnimon, maple syrup. The batter tasted WAY better! The cookies did too! ??"
"0","1","Terrible. Dry."
"0","5","I make these foe special occasions because my husband LOVES them and he thinks they're hard to make...these really are simple and taste EXCELLENT. They way you cook them is key. Experiment what's best for you. We do 8 minutes, 2 minutes in the pan cooling for crispness. Larger cookies make chewier middles."
"0","5","Perfect peanut butter cookie recipe! My 11-year-old made it and was thrilled to turn out delicious cookies."
"0","5","Loved this cookie. Nice texture , not dense kind of had a flaky texture."
"0","5","made this with my sister had so much fun and they tasted amazing"
"0","3","The recipe was great and simple and easy to follow, but it was my first time baking cookies, and mine came out more like cupcakes than cookies. They still were the shape and size of cookies, but rather than being crunchy or moist like cookies, were just sponge-like."
"0","4","Took everyone advice and turned out great."
"0","5","Great cookies I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and chocolate chips! IF you chill the dough you DO NOT have to add more flour! EXCELLENT COOKIES"
"0","5","All time favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies...and I've tried quite a few! Made a few small changes: added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and an extra 1/4 cup of Peanut Butter. I also baked at 350 for about 10 minutes and it worked perfectly! Stop looking now and use this recipe now! The cookies are absolutely delicious."
"0","4","I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to them and made 1.5 inch balls without smushing them and cooked for 9 minutes!! Perfect!!"
"0","5","The best PB cookie ever!! I too added 1/2 c each flour and p-nut butter, used salted butter and omitted 1/2 tsp salt listed in recipe also added 1 tsp of vanilla, baked 10min at 350 - we can't stop eating them!!! Also, for half of the batch I added chocolate candy wafer to center of cookie 5 minutes into baking- yummy!"
"0","5","I followed recipe as is, they came out perfect. I used natural peanut butter had no problem with them being to thin."
"0","4","Very good--a little different in texture, since when my children were growing up, I made them probably the size estimated here. I added the extra flour and peanut butter as others mentioned here, plus the teaspoon of vanilla. The flavor would be richer with the butter; however, since I had none, I used 1/2 cup cube margarine plus 1/2 cup shortening. Since everyone seems to like cookies larger these days, that's what I did, ending up with about 3 dozen. Just right at 375 degrees at 9 minutes. I tried some at 350 degrees earlier after preheating, but they were too pale."
"0","5","I've cooked these cookies multiple times now, except I was adding a little bit more peanut butter as well as flour. Well this time I followed the instructions exactly as they said, except I used 1/2 crunchy 1/2 creamy peanut butter, and added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, cooked on 375 for 12 mins and they're the best ones yet. The ends managed to stay crunchy while the middle is nice and chewy. So great!"
"0","5","These were exactly what I was looking for! I listened to other reviews and added some vanilla, 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1/2 cup more AP flour, and 2Tbsp of cornstarch to keep them a bit more chewy. But I made the mistake of doubling this and oh my goodness I got soooooooo many cookies! I'm not sure if I am making them considerably smaller than others but I have soooo many cookies that I don't think I know how to get rid of them all! But truly if my only complaint is that the yeild amount seems a tad off well then honestly there isn't much to complain about :-) thank you for this post as this is now my go-to PB cookie!!!"
"0","5","easy and tasty. totally like it!"
"0","4","This was a great recipe. I read other reviews which noted flatness of cookies so I added a little over 1/4 cup of flour. Also used creamy peanut butter and not crunchy as we dis n it have it on hand. Cookies came out nice, although they were a bit hard, so next time I will bake them a minute or two less. Thanks again for the recipe."
"0","5","These are amazing. Peanut butter is my husband's favorite type of cookie and he absolutely loved them. I added more flour and peanut butter as the top reviews suggested and they came out simply fabulous! Froze well, too! I definitely will be making these again!"
"0","5","FANTASTIC COOKIES...First time I'v made peanut butter cookies. I followed the recipe to a tee but did not know how to measure the peanut butter accurately so just put the whole jar of chunky Skippy in the batter. NO REGRETS. The aroma of the baked cookie is intoxicating and the next day, I could smell the cookies my husband had on a napkin, across the room. Thank you for posting this recipe."
"0","5","Loved it but... no matter whose recipe you follow, after refridgeration of your dough, it turns out really really crumbly. Add one cup of milk and mix before baking your cookies. I get compliments every time I make these!"
"0","4","The recipe is great. I added 1tsp of vanilla and did not press the cookies much to avoid the crispy pancake look. Cookies were moist and better the next day. My oven bakes fast so I baked for 8 minutes. Jiff is my favorite peanut butter and is my preference over others."
"0","5","So delicious! Just put 3 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2 and put 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter. Other than that , these cookies are wonderful."
"0","4","honestly they taste delicious, i won't lie, but they are really weak and won't hold together. like i tried to pick up one and it fell apart like my social life. i kind of ended up with a pan of peanut butter deliciousness, like i decided to just put the first batch in a bowl and eat it with a spoon.  it was a very good idea."
"0","5","The best. Don't over bake"
"0","5","These cookies are to die for. They are the perfect amount of peanut butter and all of the other ingredients made the cookies taste much better than the classic recipes that you find on the back of the peanut butter container. I wanted to go straight into the baking without seeing any comments so that I could give this a pure rating. Stay tuned if you would like to hear my recommendations. I made a large mistake during the first direction. While I was combining the butter, peanut butter and sugars, I left the stand mixer for a minute. 1 MINUTE! In that minute the butter whipped. I then returned to a very light mixture. If this happens to you DON'T WORRY. I actually had none of the problems that anyone else had. I also didn't have enough flour and only put in 2 1/4 cup flour but once again it did not mess up my cookies. Once I was done making the dough, I put it in the fridge. I went shopping and lost track of time which led me to leaving the dough in the fridge for 2 and a half hours but that once again did not mess up my cookies. The dough was a perfect consistency and didn't grip the fork so I did not have to use any sugar to keep it from sticking. Once cooked the cookies return to peanut butter colour. I highly recommend this and don't worry if your mixture is more white than it was in the video. It may even turn out better then the regular recipe."
"0","5","This is the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had. I did follow some of the other folks suggestions and used 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, and 2 2/3 cups flour instead of the measurements used in the recipe. I chilled the dough for about 20 hours in the fridge. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar, and baked them for 11 minutes at 350 degrees in my toaster oven. They turned out amazing. Just check out the pictures of the final product!"
"0","5","Perfect recipe but for the ingredients I had 1cup of peanutbutter and 1/2cup of crunchy pb for the pb amount and I kept all of the other ingredients the same even the flour."
"0","3","Good taste. Added extra peanut butter. Flat cookies but tasted yummy!"
"0","5","These are AWESOME!!! I did take others' advice and added a bit more flour (I live in CO, cookies come out flat if you don't add flour) and I cooked them for 8 minutes and they were chewy and perfect!!! I kept putting the batter into the fridge between batches--my kitchen gets HOT and I didn't want to risk it them melting in advance! Excellent recipe!"
"0","5","I LOVE this! Just like my grandma would make. The only difference I made is I switched the butter for crisco. And added Hersey kisses on some. Love it!"
"0","5","Not much of a baker! I look for the most simple recipe and go with it... I followed this exactly as it was, including the hour in the fridge and. PERFECT!"
"0","4","I love the crunchy texture. I added pure vanilla extract and more peanutbutter. For funzies I added about 3/4 cup of english toffee. Amazing."
"0","5","This recipe was so easy and I did not have to adjust it.   I made 2 dozen D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S, melt in your mouth peanut butter cookies and will keep this recipe in my recipe box :)   Shirley, Thank You So Much"
"0","3","I followed the basic recipe but did make a few changes that people said would make the cookies chewy. Well I don't know what went wrong but these (all 9 dozen of them) are dry and almost powdery. Very bland flavor too, even with vanilla. So while they are not the worst cookies I've ever had/baked, they are just VERY plain."
"0","4","I followed the recipe to the letter and really liked it!! It made a lot more than 4 dozen cookies, more like 6 dozen. That's okay, it means I have something to bring to a potluck at work tomorrow. LOL!!"
"0","4","I made exactly to recipe but I can't help but think I should've used another egg (though large they were kinda small). It didn't seem enough to make the batter consistent. Some of them crumbled (just a few not all). But they are definitely delish!!! These will definitely be made again! HUGE HiT!"
"0","5","These cookies are the BEST PB cookies I have ever tasted. I made a total of 28 large cookies, and they started disappearing right away! I followed another reviewer's advice and chilled them overnight, and they came out perfectly. Sprinkled with a little cinnamon and sugar before baking, and dipped in milk afterwards, they are absolutely fantastic!"
"0","5","LOVE these cookies! I use natural peanut butter, pastry flour, and European butter. They come out soft and creamy every time!"
"0","5","I used the modifications and the cookies were perfect, a real hit with the family."
"0","4","Came out great added the vanilla and extra flour perfect!!!"
"0","5","These were delicious! I made them as written, exept I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and chocolate chips."
"0","5","These are amazing but I don't use the fork to make them flat...this way they turn out chewy and delicious."
"0","5","I really like this recipe. I rolled my dough larger than I should have but I like a larger cookie. No big deal, but the trade off is you will lose most of the fork marks. The taste is wonderful, not too sweet. I chose to use salted butter (since I didn't have unsalted on hand) and ditched the salt addition listed. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. If the batter looks too loose or you know your oven tends to run hot, use your best judgment! Add a little flour or turn your oven down; my oven runs very hot so I turned it down to 360 degrees and had no burning issues. I highly recommend this recipe, just remember to keep your dough chilled right up until you put in the oven! If you have some lag time between shaping and baking or more dough to prepare while waiting for a free cookie sheet, pop the dough/prepped unbaked cookies back in the fridge until the pan is ready to go into the oven. Good luck!!"
"0","5","I thought this was a great recipe! First homemade cookies I've ever made. Only change I made was I cut the butter in half and replaced with 1/4 cup of yogurt."
"0","4","Very good but really greasy...needs a lot more flour."
"0","5","Didn't change a thing and I thouugt they were perfect, thank you!"
"0","5","used smooth peanut butter. Added 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter as reviewers suggested. very good!!! keeper"
"0","5","Loved it."
"0","5","We didn't chill ours and yet they are still fluffy! Also we only had maybe 3/4 cup of peanut butter and accidentally used 1&1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda. Good recipe! Not big on peanut butter but had a hankering tonight! Glad I chose this recipe!"
"0","3","Tried the recipe on it's own, and I have to be fair; only three stars' worth of good. I'm going to try the suggestions in these other reviews, and we'll see how it goes. I'm hoping I don't end up with more frisbee cookies - that really was quite frustrating!"
"0","3","3.5 stars. These cookies are good, they don't taste bad at all but both my husband and I thought the peanut butter taste could have been stronger. The first batch I cooked for 9 mins and a couple cookies were too brown so I cooked the rest for 8 minutes and it resulted in a much tastier cookie, soft but crunchy at the same time. Next time I want to make pb cookies I'll probably look for another recipe though."
"0","5","I just finished making these cookies and they are wonderful. My son requested peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips in them. I did use creamy pb, because that is all I had. After reading some of the comments, I increased the flour and the peanut butter. I did not have any trouble with rolling the dough. The chocolate chips I used were frozen, and I did refrigerate the dough with the chips inside for almost an hour. Maybe because the chips were right from the freezer into the dough, that might have helped. I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes. I had no trouble with them flattening out whatsoever. Actually, mine did not flatten hardly at all. They came out more like a cake-like cookie - which I like. My son loves them and so do I. Thank you for the original post, and for all the comments/suggestions!"
"0","5","I made these cookies today. I think they are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. I made some adaptations based on some of the other reviews, but I also live at 7800 feet, so I needed to adjust for high altitude. To adjust for high altitude, I only used 3/4 cup butter and I cut back to 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. In deference to the review recommendations, which were all great, I also added 1/2 cup extra peanut butter, 1/2 cup extra flour and 1 tsp vanilla. I love chocolate chips in my peanut butter cookies, so I added 1 cup+ mini chocolate chips. I don't like flat, crispy cookies, so I always refrigerate dough for 2-3 hours before baking and keep the dough in the fridge in between baking sheets of cookies. I think they come out better. This was a great recipe to start, the recommendations from the reviewers were spot on. I will make these again."
"0","5","I rate it a 10??These cookies were astonishing. Our guests loved them."
"0","5","This recipe was great! My hub has asked me a few weeks ago if I'd make some peanut butter cookies and I finally got around to it. I found this recipe and had most of the ingredients. I didn't have unsalted butter so I just used my land o lakes light butter (with canola oil), and I only had somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 cup...so I used that. I also had some peanut butter from trader joe's that wasn't very good on sandwiches. It didn't have any sugar. So I used that and the cookies were great! I also added a little pumpkin spice just because of the season :). I baked them on wax paper. I will be making these again."
"0","3","I followed some tips from other people like increasing the flour & peanut butter by a 1/2 cup & it did make them much fluffy & softer which we like. However I just don't think there is enough peanut butter taste. I think next time I will increase the peanut butter by a full cup & see how it turns out. I also used smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy bc it's what we prefer. Maybe that could have made the peanut butter taste not as strong"
"0","5","THIS IS PERFECT! The cookies came out as a perfect and the texture was heavenly. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter, so I had to do creamy. We added some chocolate chips and it was FABULOUS. The cookies spread out more than I had planned, so next time I'll add a bit more flour. Perhaps 1/3 a cup. I added some more vanilla extract,and they were the bomb! Do want to hear a good serving tip? Mash 4 cookies in a 1/4 cup of milk and it tastes like ice cream and cookies that you can get at Chile's. That sounds crazy right? But it was awesome. We made about 25 cookies and in a family of 4, they were devoured without leftovers. My bro asked me if we could make this instead of regular cookies, and A LOT MORE OFTEN. Well I'l tell you this. I agree."
"0","5","This is THE recipe i was looking for when I came looking for that old school taste. I love this recipe and often find myself going a little over on the peanut butter and still these little babies turn out great!! Adding choco chips never hurt either!!"
"0","5","Fantastic, fool proof recipe! bravo"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","2","The dough came out very crumbly after I chilled it."
"0","2","I was very disappointed! I made the cookies exactly like recipe and I found the cookies to be too buttery tasting. I have always loved peanut butter and used other recipes that were great tasting peanut butter cookies. Should be called butter cookies with a little bit of peanut butter."
"0","5","Good recipe. I didn't make any changes and they were delicious."
"0","5","So I use this recipe as a base and tweaked it for what I had in the cupboard.  I used  1 cup powered sugar 2 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flower A good sized glob honey a big big spoonful maple sugar 1 1/2 sticks butter 1 cup creamy peanut butter One big giant spoonful trader Joe's Cookie &Coco swirl spread 2 eggs Salt, baking soda, baking powder the same as recipe   Mixed and baked the same as recipe, topped with trader Joe's cinnamon sugar ( in the grinder)  Turned out yum!  Thanks !"
"0","4","Halloween 2014 I took my 6 children trick or treating. When we got to the house I realized how much candy we had gotten :-( it didnt look so good....we had so much candy we filled 2 medium size duffle bags. I knew this wasnt right I searched for places to donate candy to, when the greatest ideal came to me.....I can use the chocolate to make cookies. I found this recipe and BOY I'm glad I did! I did add the 1/4 flour and extra peanut butter. I crushed up all the chocolate and poured it in after I shifted my dry ingredients. Scared not knowing what the cookies would taste like considering it was all types of chocolate candy (Reeses, Hersey, cookie and cream hershey, paydays, snickers, kitkats, 3 musketeers, babe Ruths, m&ms etc) I just wasn't sure if it would come out right. The cookies were wonderful! They came out HUGE and soft! !! My children loved them and I got rid of a half of bag of candy :-). Note I have an Electric stove so I baked on 350 for 9-10 mins.    Oh yeah the next day I uses the left over batter and brewers yeast and fennel seed to the batch and made lactation cookies and they turned out great! Im really happy I found this recipe."
"0","4","10 minutes was a perfect cook time for my oven. I followed the recipe the first time. They were okay but seemed to be missing something. For the second batch, I rolled the tops in sugar. They were 5-star worthy afterwards."
"0","5","Great recipe but definitely needs more peanut butter next time even though I used a whole jar! Used smooth peanut butter and salted butter so just omitted the salt and added dark chocolate drops on top just before baking them at 190 degrees Celsius for 13 minutes. Used 1 tbsp as the measure for each cookie and it made 50. Might try another batch but portion it out then freeze so I can have fresh cookies with minimal effort when ever I crave them."
"0","3","I have made these cookies with another recipe using peanut butter, sugar,and eggs it still comes out the same way as these did"
"0","4","My family likes peanut butter cookies so this is the first time I've made them from scratch. The recipe was easy now for the cooking part...wish me luck!"
"0","5","they were very good and I like them"
"0","5","Like others, I increased the amount of peanut butter and flour by half a cup. Fantastic cookies!"
"0","5","I'm an American in England where PB cookies are unheard of. But everyone I've ever made these for has Love love loved them! I love them too and am VERY picky about my cakes and cookies. I've made this recipe 20x now at least and they are always a hit and always requested for parties and bbqs. I follow the recipe ingredients exactly; no need to add anything. I always refrigerate the dough over night which I think is the real key. And I also ALWAYS use a quality, no added oil peanut butter. The one time I used 'cheap' PB (one with fillers and added Palm oil) is the one time I thought the recipe needed more flour."
"0","5","Made these tonight and they are amazing! I followed the recipe how it was written and added some chocolate chips! Perfect for ,y peanut butter and chocolate fix! Cookies came out soft and gooey and not flat at all!"
"0","2","Needs mor peanut butter all you taste is flour and sugar."
"0","5","This was a great recipe and the cookies turned out awesome! I gave some to friends and they said that they were the best peanut butter cookies they have had in a long time. Prior to baking the cookies, I read some reviews and decided to add ¼ cup more of peanut butter and ¼ more of flour so the cookies turned out soft and chewy. I also used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and let them cool on a plate (not wire rack). I would recommend this recipe to any peanut butter cookie lover!"
"0","3","Read the comments before making and added extra flour and peanut butter.... Combined ingredients. Still had to add another extra cup of flour because dough was to soft to form balls... With that said they came out well."
"0","4","This recipe worked perfectly for me as it was written. I did leave in the fridge over night, mostly because I was tired ha. I think I will add more peanut butter with this next batch though."
"0","5","They're great"
"0","5","Made as written and came out perfect!"
"0","5","They turned out fantastic! All of the measurements were correct except for the flour. I would recommend 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup more flour. Without the extra flour it was very hard to form the dough into balls. Overall, the cookies were amazing and i would definitely make them more often for my kids!"
"0","4","It had a good flavor but was way too thin. Reminded me more of a chocolate chip cookie dough that was peanut butter flavored. The first pan I flattened with a fork but then decided not to since they were so thin. The next pans we threw semi-sweet choco chips on top. They were a great flavor as is but everything is better with chocolate :D"
"0","5","This was the absolute best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. I too like my peanut butter cookies very peanut buttery, so I added an additional cup of peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 more flour. My family devoured it, they used terms like these taste 'amazing'."
"0","5","Made exactly as written. Excellent! Will definitely make again!"
"0","4","Just got done making these. Yummy, but after reading reviews decided to add more flour and p-nut butter as others did. Glad i did because while some liked them as is, they stated that the p-nut butter taste was not strong enough. So with the additional they came out perfect for our taste. I did use creamy instead of chunky but that's because i have four jars in my house. My reason for wanting to make cookies,so thanks for the recipe even though it was slightly tweaked"
"0","5","A family favorite."
"0","4","i liked this recipe! i did add an extra 1/4 cup flour and i used 1/2 chunky and 1/2 creamy peanut butter ...i also rolled the balls in a powdered cocoa mixed with sugar...gave it a nice chocolate taste and it's cheaper than chips. i did not cool the batter in the fridge for the first batch...they were perfect..i chilled the next batch and they were flatter! still tasty though!the recipe made 4 dozen cookies."
"0","5","I liked these cookies a lot, but just remember to use the fork to flatten them out. It makes it look nice, and gives you a decently sized cupcake- not one big mound of cookie! ;-)"
"0","5","Great recipe. I added flour and vanilla to mine. I use a cookie scoop instead of rolling them in sugar, but then sprinkle them with Penzey's Vanilla sugar before baking. I've also tried it with almond extract and they were wonderful."
"0","5","I have used this recipe several times and everyone absolutely loves it. Today I tried something different. rather than two and a half cups of white flour I used 1 cup of white flour 1 cup of whole wheat flour and a third cup of protein powder.guess what. They are so delicious. A little extra nutty flavor came through and though they're not as light and crispy as the original recipe, they are delicious.my kids love them too. And they don't even know they're getting a healthier cookie."
"0","5","Really good pb cookies. Worked well with and without semi-sweet chips."
"0","5","These cookies came out perfect. I made no changes to the recipe and I didn't have flat cookies."
"0","5","The only changes I made to this recipe were to add a tbs of milk (I thought the batter may be too dry), chocolate chips (two handfuls) and I skipped the hour chilling time - we were too impatient to wait. My cookies turned out exactly as shown in the picture and tasted fantastic!"
"0","5","my husband loved these. they came perfect. he even took them to work and shared rave reviews."
"0","5","My favorite peanut butter cookie recipe! This is the exact recipe I have been using for years from the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook - with one exception - theirs also calls for 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, which I highly recommend adding. Delicious!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is perfect as is. If you are looking for a very peanut flavored cookie, this probably isn't the recipe for you. However, if you are looking for a hint of peanut butter with a perfectly chewy, soft cookie... this one is for you. My family LOVES these cookies and can never get enough of them!"
"0","5","So I rated this recipe 5 stars and I think that is due mostly to all the fantastic comments before me. I read the comments and lot of comments discussed runny consistency so I made some tweaks. First of all, I made this with creamy peanut butter and that was only due to the fact that we had creamy in the house. Secondly, I added 1/2 each of flour and peanut butter as many comments suggested. Thirdly, I put the cookie dough in the fridge for 24 hours to firm up better for baking. Finally, I added in some chopped Reese's cups and white chocolate chips. I baked my cookies at 350 but I can not tell you for how long since I don't like to follow timers but remove them when they are done. My first batch came out looking not real runny but still a little smaller than I would like so with the second batch I made bigger balls of cookie dough and Volia! the perfect cookie. It tastes fantastic but I would recommend using more flour and peanut butter and letting the dough sit in your fridge for a while before you cook it so you don't waste all the ingredients due to a runny cookie."
"0","5","Best Peanut Butter Cookies I've made. QUESTION: I need to make the cookies today and only have natural (unsweetened/unsalted) peanut butter in my pantry. Suggestions for substitutions most welcome! Thank you"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious!!! I would definitely make them again!??"
"0","5","Made these following instructions given with no changes or additions. They came out great. The last dozen baked I rolled in sugar before pressing with fork. This definately adds to the look and flavor."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly when making the cookie dough. However, because I wanted huge cookies, I cut the oven temp back to 350 and cooked them for 12 to 14 minutes. The center is soft and chewy and the edges just a little crunchy. Great recipe with plenty of peanut butter flavor. Will definitely try again."
"0","5","These were so yummy! Wanted cookies as a late night snack and peanut butter was the only thing I had. I didn't have brown sugar so I just added the white sugar plus 1/4, nor did I have baking butter, so was surprised how good these still came out. I made them with freshly ground peanut butter where you grind it up at the store. My family ate them all up in two days. I did follow,DENIELLE2's advise on adding 1/4 more flour and 1/4 more peanut butter. Which made them more softer/chewier. I was going to do JENNIFERC77's advise but didn't have that much peanut butter. I'm going to make these my go to peanut butter cookies."
"0","5","They turned out amazing and I didn't need to alter a thing!!!! They are really good and amazing!!! Love this recipe!!!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe!! My family loved them! I did use the advice from one of the reviewers: 1/2 cup more peanut butter, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup more flour. They were soft and fluffy! Very yummy!"
"0","5","Loved this! I added butterscotch chips and chocolate chips and they were just fabulous. So delicious. The family loved them."
"0","5","So yummy. Recipe was great just added a little more flour. 1/2 cup."
"0","5","followed the recipe EXACTLY and had NO problems at all. Delicious!"
"0","1","My wife and kids just made this recipe and followed it verbatum...WORST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES EVER!!! We have 20+ cookies that we can't eat...Not enough peanut butter...Cookies were more like a sugar cookie than a peanut butter cookie. Excellent texture though."
"0","5","This recipe is delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised. I kept the recipe just about the same except for adding a 1/2 cup of flour as others suggested, and 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I also added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to dough for taste. The only difficult part of making the cookies was stirring the flour mixture with the peanut butter mixture. I stirred and stirred at least 10 minutes!!! Other than that, the cookies came out soft and tasty, with a subtle peanut butter flavor. I cooked these cookies right at 10 minutes. I was able to make just shy of 3 dozen. Yum!"
"0","5","Substituted flour for gluten-free all purpose flour for these cookies today and added chocolate chips! Yum!!!!"
"0","5","I made one big cookie for family to share it was delicious"
"0","5","Thank you Shirley for a surely delicious cookie.  I made the recipe EXACTLY and cookies were very good. The dough MUST BE REFRIGERATED for at least the recommended time. This will stop the cookie from spreading while baking. Also, because it is butter based, make sure you bake them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. :-)  The TWEAKED RECIPE -increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/2 cup each and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. OH YEAH, BABY! YUMMY! Yet another suggestion, add some finely chopped up dates, maraschino cherries and walnuts or peanuts. Thank People for your suggestions."
"0","5","These are the most delicious cookies! I make them at least once a week for my husband, a peanut butter cookie fanatic. The only thing different for me is that I bake them for 6 1/2 minutes at 350 degrees."
"0","1","Not enough peanut taste, just sugary flavor. The texture is nice, though, no issues there, dough nice to work with. Not making these again!"
"0","5","I added an extra 1/4 c. flour and put in about 1/3 c. crushed peanuts(I accidentally bought smooth instead of crunchy pb!)and these came out beautifully!! About 9.5 minutes was the perfect time for them, brown on the bottom but still soft and chewey. Everyone loved them!!"
"0","5","These cookies were really good. Took them to where I volunteer and the girls raved about them and they all disappeared. They looked fantastic and depending on your preference you could have crunchy or soft. I baked soft ones for 11 minutes and crispy 13 min. The only change I will make next time is add a little more peanut butter. I don't know if because I used natural peanut butter (without hydrogenated oils) if this made it taste less peanut like) I like more peanut butter taste. I would not add vanilla to this recipe as it would distract from the flavor you are trying to acquire. I also used a melon baller to make sure all cookies about same size. Then I rolled them in some sugar and when on cookie sheet I flatten slightly with fork in crisscross manner. Wish I had taken a picture but they were gone before I got a chance."
"0","5","I have made these many times the last time I added chocolate chips."
"0","5","These cookies were perfect; I had accidentally purchased crunchy peanut butter and my family hates crunchy; so I needed to do something with it. I figured; why not do cookies!! This recipe was perfect; my daughter and husband, the peanut butter snobs, loved it. I even made them again a week later and added mini chocolate chips. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!"
"0","4","I loved this recipe, but i think i put too much flour. i had seen that other people had suggested an extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter. I think next time i will only add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. These came out a little dry but that makes them perfect for dunking in some cold milk. Yummy"
"0","5","I wasn't impressed either way with these cookies BUT the rest of the family can't get enough. They have nice texture with crunchy edges and a softer middle. Watch the baking time closely! Recipes was easy to make. I got 4 dozen nice sized cookies from walnut sized balls. After reading the reviews I did increase the flour and peanut butter. I'm not sure by how much I just used heaping measurements. I will make these again since they are almost gone already."
"0","5","I love this recipe for Peanut Butter Cookies especially because you are directed to put the dough in the fridge for an hour, gives me a chance to rest up! Today I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the recipe."
"0","5","Easy to make and yummy! I opted for the longer baking time. This improved the texture of the cookie. It also helps if you keep the dough cold between wait times. I read that some were adding extra ingredients. Longer bake times and cold dough eliminate this I believe."
"0","5","These were delicious and turned out perfectly without any changes to the recipe."
"0","1","I read the reviews before I baked these this morning. I added more peanut butter and flour as suggested in many reviews and I think that is what ruined the cookies. They are beautiful, but they crumble nearly into dust when touched and taste like slightly peanut butter flavored flour. I should have tried the original recipe first, because I would rather have flat cookies (which is what the extra flour is supposed to fix) than flour crumbles."
"0","4","I like this recipe! You just have to bake for a few minutes and it's done. I just lessen the sugar by a 1/2 cup but it was still good!"
"0","5","These tastes amazing! Like others have said they do turn out flat but I still thought they were perfect. I thought they were moist and chewy. I would definitely recommend you do not make them for the first time as a treat to take anywhere.... make them for yourself at home. They arnt pretty but taste great. I have saved them as the only peanut butter cookie I will make from now on just because they taste that good."
"0","4","Well, ive made this a few times now and something still doesn't taste right. Ive added more peanut butter, tried more flour, tried vanilla. And still, doesn't taste right. Maybe its just me. My husband likes them but I don't think he even tastes, just swallows whatever I make. hahaha"
"0","2","Mine came out tasting great but they were crumbly and dry. The looked like the picture but that's about it. I will not make this recipe again."
"0","5","These cookies are excellent!! They are very easy to make. Somtimes I add walnuts to batter. Everyone loved them. :)"
"0","5","Like others I used 1/2 cp more flour, I used margarine so omitted the salt, and added 1/2 cp of CREAMY PB. I've tried out many PB recipes, this one with the addition of the flour and creamy PB, WINS! Hands down. The best PB cookie ever. The edges are slightly crispy while the middle nice and soft and just a little chewy. 350o for 12 mins. I put a thumb print in the center and added strawberry jam before baking. OMG!!!!! Better than Mrs. Fields if I do say so myself."
"0","5","Love it by far a really good recipe"
"0","5","Made as written.... delicious. Next time will press fork down harder to keep pattern."
"0","5","Very good cookies. I didn't have crunchy PB, so I used creamy. I also didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted and just left out the salt called for in the recipe. I've made PB cookies before and I know what happens when you flatten the cookie for the imprint so I didn't flatten the cookie, just pressed the fork lightly into the dough. Mine came out looking just like the picture. Will absolutely keep the recipe as a starter and add my own twists on it. Thanks Shirley."
"0","5","I left the recipe as is, and really liked them. So, did my husband and granddaughters."
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","I made these cookies two weekends in a row to take to parties. Even though there was lots of food at these parties people ate up the cookies. The other thing I like about the recipe is that you don't have to double it. One recipe makes a lot of cookies."
"0","5","I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with the cookies! NOTHING. I always bake my cookies for 10-12 minutes in a preheated oven. The only thing I can figure out is maybe new cooks use too large eggs and added more liquid with the vanilla. That would make them cook thin and make sure you cook them until done. Wonderful.. Crunchy and delicious. Thank you for the recipe!here."
"0","5","Awesome cookies! I added chocolate chips and took them out of the oven after 8 min. Perfect!!"
"0","5","I followed along with a few others who increased the flour & peanut butter along with vanilla...they turned out fantastic!! Even my picky chocolate loving daughter inhaled them....that says A LOT in my house :) Oh, and I only had smooth peanut butter, but they were still great!! It's a keeper here!"
"0","5","I made these almost exactly to the recipe, substituting crushed almonds and leaving overnight. I don't really measure but I reckon I put about 2.5 cups of flour. I had no problem with them being too stretched, that's probably because I let it sit overnight. I used a bit less peanut butter, but I loved these! They're fluffy and crunchy and very delicious! Next time I'll add more peanut butter, but overall it was easy and quick, 5 stars."
"0","5","I made this recipe and it was wonderful. The cookies came out soft and a bit crisp. The taste was rather bland, so I did add a little bit of peanut butter. I am not a fan of peanut butter cookies, but they were just right. I don't like for my peanut butter cookies to be too overbearing with peanut butter taste. I do like my peanut butter cookies a bit more crisp. So I just added another 1 to 2 minutes. This was a great recipe! I loved them and my husband loved them as well. I may have had to adjust the ingredients, but since I don't like my peanut butter cookies overbearing, this recipe was delicious and deserved 5 golden stars!"
"0","5","These cookies taste just heavenly! They came out the same way as on the picture, taste and texture perfect. For those who like fluffier cookies, substitute butter with shortening. On a well-known brand website (wink): 'Shortening doesn't contain water, so if you want to get the same results as you get with butter or margarine, adjust the water according to the chart below. (A shortening cookie with no extra water added is higher and lighter, while a butter cookie is flatter and crispier.)' Since I didn't have enough butter handy, I used same amount of golden shortening, and whisked in 2 TBS of water in it. If you like your cookie lighter and higher, don't had the water. Yummy!"
"0","5","I would say the 'perfect' peanut butter cookie. These are so incredibly light! Be sure not to over bake, 10 max for my oven. Thanks Shirley!!!!!"
"0","5","These came out so soft and tasty. Changes I made were using salted butter, adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and some vanilla extract. I baked on 350° for 9 minutes and chilled my dough between batches."
"0","5","These cookies were great!!!!!"
"0","4","These are good. I did half crunchy peanut butter and 1/2 creamy. Next time I will do all creamy as I'm really not a fan of nuts in my cookies even though I love nuts."
"0","5","This is the best P.B.cookie I have every made!!! Next time I would add alittle more flour and P.B. Otherwise they are delicious. My grandkids are going to love them, especially the ones with the choc kisses on them!!"
"0","4","Just made 5 dozen of these bad boys. Awesome! Four stars for the adjustments I made. Three cups of flour. Extra 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Cooked for 10 min. @ 375. Also, keep the dough chilled in the fridge in between batches. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","Made exactly as recipe stated and they were very good & moist."
"0","5","This is surly a 'Classic' peanut butter cookie recipe... straight from Betty Crocker. The ingredients are doubled here but it's the same recipe. I've been making them since I was a child."
"0","5","My husband loves cookies, and is what I would call a cookie connoisseur. These cookies are his favorite. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I refrigerated the cookie dough overnight and rolled the balls of dough in granulated sugar (thanks to the reviewers who mentioned that trick) before putting on the cookie sheet. 10 minutes later, perfection! Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","I thought this recipe tasted extraordinary but I was in a time crunch and didn't realise you had to chill the dough until after I started making it but they still turned out perfectly fine!"
"0","5","I doubled this recipe and decided to add a teaspoon of vanilla and just a sprinkle of cinnamon......they are unbelievably delicious!! I put the batter in the fridge overnight and made a batch this morning not knowing what to expect because the reviews were so mixed. I had no problem with the amount of flour.....also, I did replace the butter with 'butter flavored baking crisco' - which is what I always do when baking cookies. This is a keeper!!"
"0","4","Great recipe! Keep it in for exactly 10 mins and your golden!"
"0","5","This is my mother's recipe to the 'T'...kind of sad when I found it on Allrecipes...now my secret is out! Lol!! When I baked them this weekend mine turned out slightly flat so I might take the other review suggestions and add some more flour. Five star recipe."
"0","5","Perfect every time. Easy and very tasty just the way it is written."
"0","4","I always loved when March came around to purchase Girl scout cookies mainly for the peanut butter ones. Now with this quick and easy recipe, I can bake them at my own convenience."
"0","5","Love this!! So easy and amazing. Huge hit"
"0","4","These were delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and baked for 9 minutes as directed,on parchment paper. I was able to get 5 dozen from this recipe. They were perfect. I took them to work for a special lunch and of the 4 dozen I took, only 4 cookies came home. Thank you!"
"0","4","Theses cookies are very good!! Did have to add extra flour as the first cookies came out a little flat"
"0","5","this is the best peanut butter cookie recipe i ever tried. they are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside & melt in your mouth. yummy! plus the dough was very easy to work with. thanks!!"
"0","5","Super, super delicious. Melt in your mouth!"
"0","5","Tried this for the first time ever making peanut butter cookies.. worked great!"
"0","5","Made these for the first time today. Added the suggested 1/2 cup of extra flour and 1/2 cup of extra peanut butter. My oven runs a little hot, so I baked them at 350F for 8 minutes and they turned out absolutely perfect. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The first dozen disappeared almost as quickly as it came out the oven. I'll definitely be making these again - soon."
"0","5","I used creamy peanut butter and added a little extra and they came out perfect. They nice and soft for so long. I was really pleased. I will definitely be making these again."
"0","5","We have loved this recipe for quite some time now, until recently when we discovered our sixth child has a peanut allergy! Today we tried it with homemade sunbutter (sunflower seed butter) instead of peanut butter and these are also fantastic. (I think I might like them even better!) Such a perfect combination of moist and crispy! Delicious!"
"0","5","They are awesome! Family loves them!"
"0","5","Done this about 5 times. So simple, yet so good. Family is so impressed with these. This recipe makes an amateur look like a pro. Thanks! I did a batch using all Whole Wheat Flour for a bit of a healthier version. A bit tougher, but still too good."
"0","5","According to other comments I added 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter and baked at 350 for 10 minutes. They came out perfect!! Best recipe ever!!"
"0","5","Reviews are correct. This cookie takes a few trays in the oven before they look perfect. However, they taste wonderful, have the right softness to crunch ratio. No sugar grit either. Saving this one. Thanks!"
"0","5","hello and ty for such a wonderful recipe!!! I made no changes is as is and was delicious!!! If I would of changed it I could make my own recipe hows that!!! so ill give u a 5 star rating!! woot woot!!!ty again....yummy as they are!!!"
"0","4","Pretty classic!"
"0","5","very good, will make again"
"0","5","Sound great. Confused though because the ingredients include brown sugar but the recipe doesn't."
"0","5","I made this for my husband a few weeks ago and he has been going on for me to make again... I do not believe I changed anything as I was afraid to mess it up... Making it again today just to make him happy :)"
"0","5","I usually only rate when I follow the recipe as stated. Since I added the peanut butter after I had chilled the dough for 10 minutes and they still turned out awesome. Can't wait to try them by adding the peanut butter when it should have been!"
"0","2","Tried this Recipe for the first time this afternoon. They were ok. I think they need to be a little more Adjusted for Sweetness and Peanut Butter Flavor. They were to Fluffy and Cake like for me. I like a Cookie to have a little Saltiness and Crispness around the edges. I will be Tweaking this Recipe to see if I can make it more to my Liking."
"0","2","Ok so I had high hopes for this recipe and I followed the recommendations of the other reviewers and added an additional cup of flour, a half cup of peanut butter and the teaspoon of vanilla. Put the dough in the frig for an hour and then rolled them into balls and baked them for the ten minutes. They look nice but taste bad in my book, I can harderly tastes the peanut butter and they are super fragile. I am making another batch right now with 2 cups of the peanut butter and then sprinkling sugar on top. I also made them smaller in the hopes that they won't fall apart... Hopefully these come out decent."
"0","5","Excellent classic peanut butter cookies! I used organic natural smooth peanut butter (made with just roasted peanuts) and substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour. I halved the recipe, as it is only me and my daughter at home, but forgot to half the baking powder and soda. It made for fantastic cookies and no taste issue. I would make it this way again! So yummy!"
"0","5","agreed - add the extra 1/2 c peanut butter and 1/2c flour... I always add a dash of vanilla to cookies as wel"
"0","5","Love this recipe! Very easy and delicious! Here is a small twist that I learned from my mother-in-law. Add a 12 ounce bag of semi- sweet chocolate chips. But only if you love chocolate and peanut butter! My kids love them that way. It is also a wonderful recipe on its own! Thanks so much!"
"0","5","These PB cookies rocked! I used creamy instead of crunchy, and maybe a tad more than a single cup if I'm being honest. Will try crunchy next time, and probably add a bit more than a cup then as well. Thank you, Shirley!"
"0","4","I really liked these. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I won't flatten with a fork (they got a little too flat), but will be making these again for sure."
"0","5","Made cookie dough last night. Doubled the recipe & used as instructed other than used all white sugar. Got up in the a.m. & made some for breakfast. Will freeze the xtra dough balls. This ones a recipe box keeper!"
"0","5","awesome best i made yet"
"0","5","Wow! Just wow! These are amazing. I added the 1/4 cup extra flour and a couple tablespoons of peanut butter. After refrigerating them, I rolled the balls in white sugar and then flattened them just slightly with the criss-cross pattern. The result was stunning!  I took the other 1/2 of the recipe and added 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The taste is neither too sweet or too dry!"
"0","5","I didn't read the reviews until after the dough was made, so I didn't change a thing. They turned out spectacular! I used 'old' baking powder/soda and live at 7300'. They didn't flatten a bit. The only thing I did differently was use Jif chocolate spread instead of the PB (wanted to get it out of the pantry). They tasted great, but not overly choclatey or peanuty."
"0","5","So good! Melted in my mouth practically. Added slightly more peanut butter and sugar. Did 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c shortening. Baked at 350 10 min."
"0","5","These turned out great. Yes, they do spread and flatten quite a bit, so I squished the fork down much less in later batches for the design on top - but these were delicious and easy to make."
"0","5","Great"
"0","4","I loved this recipe but it was a little salty"
"0","5","I usually do not make cookies, but since we were snowed in(Alabama!)and I was looking for something to bake with what I had, this fit the bill. Followed this recipe to the letter. No added flour or peanut butter or vanilla. I did chill the dough for an hour and cooked for 9 mins. Absolutely. Wonderful. You don't have to change a thing."
"0","5","Very tasty cookies! I cooked a bit shorter than recommended in the recipe, 8-9 minutes, then let the cookies cool on the sheet."
"0","5","This recipe is even better than Mrs. Riggs peanut butter cookies. I thought I found a great recipe, but this one tops them all. Incredibly delicious cookies. The ABSOLUTE best peanut butter cookies that I've ever baked."
"0","5","These cookies need ABSOLUTELY NO TWEAKING!!! They are perfect! Mix the and bake them EXACTLY per the recipe and you will have the best peanut butter cookie you have ever eaten!"
"0","5","Like several others, I added 1/4 cup each of peanut butter and flour as well as 1 tsp of vanilla. I also added half a bag of peanut butter chips. I used a scooper to ensure they bake evenly then rolled them in white sugar. Instead of the 'fork design' on the cookie, I pressed them down slightly with the back of a spoon and baked them for 9 minutes @ 350 degrees. The cookies are AWESOME!!! They reminded me of Panera's Peanut Butter Dream cookie.   I will DEFINITELY be making these again. Next time I'll add more peanut butter chips and a bit less butter. The cookies were a tad greasy, but still AWESOME!"
"0","5","Love this recipe but like everyone else I changed flour to 3 cups and added little more peanut butter. Took these to Bible school during the summer and everyone loved them."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing!"
"0","5","Good cookies with great flavor. I didn't have unsalted butter and had to use salted, but otherwise, followed the recipe as written."
"0","5","I've made this recipe before as directed, but since I bought chocolate peanut butter, decided to try that. When I opened the jar I tasted it and it didn't taste very chocolaty, so I added Nutella also. I'll let you know how the changes affected the cookie when they're done baking."
"0","5","Amazing :). Taste just like the peanut butter cookies my mom used to make."
"0","5","Turned out perfect!"
"0","5","Big hit in my house. Tweeked it a little. I added 1/4c extra flour, 1/2c extra peanut butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and instead of a full cup of butter i used 1/2c butter, and 1/2c applesauce rolled them in sugar and lightly pressed them. Baked at 350° for 10 monutes, PERFECT!!"
"0","5","These are awesome, the BEST Peanut Butter Cookies Ever! I did follow the other posts and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and an extra 1/2 cup of Kraft Smooth Peanut Butter along with the recommended vanilla extract. I did let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for an hour as well as between batches. I also rolled the balls in sugar before pressing with a fork to make the criss-cross effect. I baked for 10 minutes on 350. I did watch them closely. YUMMY!!! Will definitely make these again. Vegas155"
"0","5","Delicious!! My husband is allergic to dairy though so I substituted the butter for 3/4 cup of olive oil. Moist and still a perfect blend of fluffy and not too chewy. I used creamy peanut butter (sugar free), added a tsp of vanilla, and about a 1/4 cup less sugar than called for in recipe. My husband said it was my 'best baking endeavor' - I am putting this recipe in my permanent recipe box!"
"0","1","It was so dry and not sweet. I cut the recipe in half, but followed the directions to a tee. After the first dozen, I even added more butter to make the dough stick together, but still did not care for it."
"0","4","OK, I've made this recipe before and followed it exactly, and for me, the cookies were great. However, I wanted PB cookies today and had no butter… Sub'd in shortening, plus 3T water, and also added a bit of extra flour after reading reviews. That's probably great when you use butter, but shortening is OMG NOOOO!!! My dough was crumbly as heck, so I added some more PB, some more water, and a bit of veg oil until it was wet enough to at least make a ball. It's still really dry, and the cookies I baked (only one batch so far) are really pale. I haven't tasted them yet, but I envision a crumbly mess! Probably make this recipe with butter… :)"
"0","4","Crisp and buttery"
"0","5","I love this recipe, and by being a 17 year old cook, my mom always ask me to make her lots of desserts. So I chose this one since she craved it. I thought the dough was a little too thin, so I added another half cup of flour including peanut butter. And I tell you, it turned out amazing! So anybody in need in help, that's what I did, this is a keeper!"
"0","5","Good, basic peanut butter cookie. I added a drop of vanilla and some chocolate chips. Family loved them!"
"0","5","Wow. Chewy, peanut buttery, and oh so addictive! My grandmother-in-law made this recipe, and she complained that the cookies flattened during cooking, but I didn't really care; they were still delicious. No complaints whatsoever here! EDIT: I made this recipe again last night and changed it up a little to fix the complaints Grandma had. For one, I added a little extra peanut butter and flour as the reviewers suggested. For two, I refrigerated thoroughly--more like three hours, and put the dough in the refrigerator between batches in the oven. Three, I made smaller cookies--three dozen out of a half batch. Mine turned out very differently--they didn't flatten much, and they were crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. Perfect!"
"0","5","I added a small box of vanilla pudding mix to this recipe and the cookies were moist and chewy. YUMMY goodness!! My husband was oh so pleased!"
"0","5","I used the natural peanut butter for a more 'peanutty' taste. Delish!"
"0","4","I made the recipe as directed - with three changes. I didn't have unsalted peanut butter, so I used regular creamy peanut butter and omitted the salt. I also added a cup of unsalted dry-roasted peanuts. The cookies are delicious - but a little mild in the peanut butter taste. I will add more peanut butter the next time I make them (and keep the peanuts - they add a lovely texture). Also, it's very easy to over-cook these. After they were pressed on the pan, I placed it in the fridge for 15 mins. I then cooked them at 350 for 6 minutes. (My oven runs hot.) They were chewy and crispy on just they outermost edges. Don't wait for them to brown - you'll end up with a very hard and dry cookie. (The dogs loved those hard ones though.) Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","Great cookies! Just baked them and followed the recipe with the exception of one minor mistake that I didn't realize until after baking. I used 2 cups of smooth peanut butter, instead of 1 cup crunchy, only because my husband misread the recipe to me!! The dough was thicker and balled up nicely so I didn't think anything about it. He added some chocolate chips to some dough I gave him to bake and those turned out very tasty."
"0","5","Sorry I could not take a picture of my cookies. All gone! So, this is a great recipe!!"
"0","5","Yum! Didn't change a thing except only baked for 9 minutes. Keep the dough in the fridge in between batches and let the cookie sheets cool down before putting more dough in. Also don't flatten with the fork very much, just a tad. Beautiful tasty cookies!"
"0","5","I predict this will be a 5 star recipe. Haven't tried the recipe yet, but the flour issue sounds like an altitude problem. I love PB cookies and will try the recipe. As I live at a higher altitude, I will plan on adding the extra flour. Thx for the tip. Also thx for the suggestion of adding Vanilla. That's what I've been missing!"
"0","4","These were just ok. Followed the suggestions of adding more flour. They ended up tasting more like pb biscuits. We enjoyed them still. I just didn't find them to die for so will continue my dream pb cookie recipe search."
"0","5","After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 cup extra AP flour and maybe 1/4 cup extra peanut butter, and a smidge of vanilla. I also substituted in a cup of whole wheat flour, trying to trick myself into thinking these would be a healthy snack ;) Fanatstic cookies! Perfect texture, beautiful light color, nice form and thickness, and, of course, delicious! Folks...if any of your cookie recipies are spreading too thin, remember 1. use softened but not warm butter (never get it goopy in a microwave!) 2. don't over-mix the butter & sugar, just barely cream them together with a lower speed until evenly mixed, 3. don't spray your cookie pans, use parchment paper or tin foil and 4. refrigerate the dough before baking. Works every time!"
"0","4","I loved this finished recipe, but the dough was a little dry and tough to form into balls. However, the final product was awesome and my friends at school loved them!"
"0","5","Excellent PB cookie. This is a keeper. These are very easy to over bake. I took them out of the oven when the edges started to look a golden brown and the texture was light and crisp on the edges but not crumbly in the middle."
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. My only add is a teaspoonful of vanilla flavor. Of course, I added the chocolate kisses to the tops of the warm cookies. I try very hard to let these babies cool because their texture improves dramatically and the flavor deepens."
"0","5","Whenever I need a recipe I always come to this site, I love all the reviews and suggestions people make. I tried the pumpkin bread recipe on this site a couple years ago and did all the suggestions people made and it's is the best recipe I've ever tried, can't keep it around when I make it, very moist and delicious."
"0","5","Final result was awesome!! I increased the flour by 1/2 cup as suggested as for the peanut butter I used the 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter plus 2 TBS. Creamy peanut butter and 2 TBS. All natural p.b. I also didn't have butter on hand and for some reason I had lard( oh yeah I used it to make tamales lol!)so I subbed the lard for the butter. I accedently put 1 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 tsp.(which I would do again I love the salty sweet thing with these cookies) I also had to add 2 tbs. Cold water ( as the dough was a bit dry and crumbled when I tried to form my balls) I made large cookies 2 oz balls I dipped them in sugar and flattened with a fork I baked at 350° for 11 mins on top rack. Cooled them on a wire rack for 5 mins . These turned out better than I ever could have imagined. My mistakes and not having the right ingredients turned into a blessing from Jesus Christ himself. The rich and intense peanut flavor light and crisp with a soft chewy center. This is by far the best peanut butter cookie I have ever placed in my mouth better than any bakery or gourmet cookie shop. It was complete extasy from the moment it touched my tongue. I will definatley make this again exactly the same way!!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! I love the little design on the cookies! This batch made me about 8 dozen little cute cookies!!!!!! My mom loved them, my dad loved them and my little sis (Who absolutely hates peanut butter) loved them also!!"
"0","5","This by far the best recipe I have come across for Peanut Butter Cookies, and I have used A LOT!   Thank you!"
"0","5","just what I was looking for I made and everybody loved them .about to make them again I added chocolate chips to mine came out great:)"
"0","5","Noms! This is my go-to for special cookies... Cuz so much butter! :D"
"0","5","I make this for my husband when the guys get together. He NEVER brings any back. I have learned to keep a dozen at home if I want any."
"0","5","Wow, these are better than anything you can buy at a bakery. I use creamy peanut butter, and added peanut butter chips for fun. The first time I made them, I had no eggs, so I substituted a flax egg (3 TBS ground flaxseed and 1 TBS water mixed). They stayed soft and chewy for the whole week. I've kept with the flax because I think maybe it helped keep them soft--I could be wrong. Super addictive, so watch out. I find that chilling the dough for an hour and using a cookie baller worked really well. It made them into fluffy 3-bite balls. I don't press them down with a fork. I'm about to make batch number 5 today to give as a welcome gift to our new neighbors--they're perfect."
"0","5","I added another 1/2 cup of flour like another reader suggested & the cookies turned out great!!!"
"0","5","These were excellent - crunchy and not too sweet! I made them with almond butter."
"0","4","I loved this recipe as a fixer-up. Like many, I start with something else and touch it up afterwards to my liking. I always make my cookies in a muffin tin, it keeps them from getting too big and saves my calories. :) Oh and I also used salted butter and smooth peanut butter. My boyfriend raves about these now, he says they're as good as his mom's! I never get that!"
"0","4","Really yummy cookies. I added more flour/pb. Wonderful."
"0","5","Amazing! I did add a tsp of vanilla and a tad bit more flour. So Tasty!"
"0","4","These cookies were SCRUMPTIOUS!!!! Delicious! I followed the recipe 99%, but forgot to refrigerate the dough. They came out absolutely delicious, but a bit greasy. Not so greasy that I'll never make them again, but enough to notice. I will probably make these cookies again; as long as I have more time in the day (I doubled the recipe-48 cookies-and my oven doesn't keep temp consistently, and bakes unevenly) lol"
"0","5","I added 1/4 c more of flour as others suggested. Delish! The smaller the cookie the better as I like 'em crunchy. Very peanut buttery. I made 2 batches and added chocolate chips to the second and even better as I like a little variety."
"0","5","Love it! I used 2 cups of brown sugar and omitted the white sugar. delicious, I also dipped half the cookie in dark chocolate. Talk about heavenly!"
"0","5","We love these! Substituted 1/2 c. Coconut oil for 1/2 the butter. Also added 1/4 c oats. Love, love, love them!"
"0","5","Nice, perfectly round cookies. My cookies rarely turn out the way I want. These ones look amazing and taste just as good. I added a bag of mini chocolate chips."
"0","5","I often make cookies for the small office where I work. There are only 8 of us. Usually cookies take a few days to disappear. These were gone by 3:00pm the day I put them out.   They are light, crispy and crunchy with a perfect peanut flavor. There's nothing cakey or too dry about this cookie. I added chocolate chips because who doesn't love chocolate and peanut butter? This recipe is by far the best Peanut Butter Cookie recipe I've come across."
"0","4","OH MY GOODNESS! It's really great! Pros: It's really good and it lives up to its name. The peanuts can really be tasted and the texture's good. The servings really big too! :D Cons: I am a beginner too so it was a bit hard using the mixer, I think I over mixed it making it dry. I added another egg because my eggs were a bit small and half a glass of water because it was a bit dry. You also have to bake it 2-3 times before you get the hang of it, especially timing the cookies when their perfect. You need practice or experience to really get it perfect the first time but it's not impossible.  I followed other comments, so I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Fantastic.  Thank you for sharing the recipe! :D"
"0","5","I have used this recipe for my church- and all reviews have been positive!!"
"0","5","I made this recipe last night. I increased the flour to 2 3/4 cups and used 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter. I also baked them at 350 for 10 minutes and they were PERFECT!!!!"
"0","5","Great recipe. Next time I will cut back on the white sugar by half."
"0","5","These turned out great! I added extra peanut butter and flour,as suggested by the other reviewers, plus some peanut butter chips. I put the batter in the fridge overnight and I cooked them for about 9 min and 30 seconds in a 375 degree oven. I prefer my cookies a bit chewier but if you prefer a crispier cookie, I would probably add an extra minute or two in the oven. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly and came out perfect! I was worried when I read the other reviews after making the dough. But as it turns out, not a single change was needed. I think another reviewer might be spot on when he suggested you really do refrigerate the dough for a full hour. I did and had zero problems. Crisscrossed the top and all! Delish!!!"
"0","5","This is the best PB cookie recipe I've made. I added the 1/4 cup extra flour and pb along with the 1 tsp vanilla suggested by other reviewers. I didn't smash my cookies too much and baked them for 9 minutes at 350. They are so soft and good! Thank you!"
"0","5","cookies were amazing, though mine came out pretty flat......is that supposed to happen??"
"0","5","Made these with chocolate peanut butter and put Reese's Peanut Butter chips in. Yummy. They went really fast."
"0","5","These are by far the best peanut butter cookies. I used this recipe for the Hershey's kisses Version and they were perfect. Baked it only eight minutes."
"0","5","easy and so yummy"
"0","5","I just finished making these cookies for a church event I am going to. The cookies were perfect and so Delish!   I used smooth almond butter because I wanted to use up what I had in the pantry, and it tastes just as good as peanut butter. I used about 1&1/4 cup of the almond butter. I used 3 eggs and added 1/2 cup more flour & the consistancy was perfect. I used a stainless steel mixing bowl and put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes and the dough was easy to handle. I have a cookie scoop (like a small ice cream scoop)and the cookies are uniform in size that way, not to mention faster and easier to scoop up. I always dip my fork in flour before I make the criss cross design, then redip it for the next cookie. The fork never sticks to the cookies that way.    I have two large cookie sheets and only bake one sheet at a time. I line the sheets with heavy foil, dull side up, and let the cookies cool completely on the foil (after I slide it, cookies and all, off the pan) then I can reuse the cookie sheet. 12 minutes in my oven was just right. This recipe yielded 4 dozen & 8 cookies, about 3 & 1/4 inches across.  I had some chocolate kisses in the pantry so I unwrapped them while the cookies baked and when they came out of the oven I put a kiss in the middle of each hot cookie and pressed down a bit. They melted just at the bottom, enough to hold them in the center of the cookie after they cooled.   I will make these again with my grandchildren next week!"
"0","5","SUPER delish. I added 1/2 C flour and they were perfect. Also, I didn't have crunchy peanut butter and they are still amazing! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I've made this recipe several times now, and the cookies are delicious and always a hit. I've used both crunchy and creamy peanut butter and both work well. I do typically add an extra 1/4 - 1/2 cup peanut butter and I like to add peanut butter chips, too!"
"0","5","I used 'all-natural' peanut butter (the kind that is naturally oily) and suspected less than perfect, but the recipe turned out flawless somehow. The family loved it!"
"0","5","Added 1/4 more flour & 1/4 more peanut butter also added 1/4 teas of cinnamon very yummy"
"0","5","Oh Yeah! these are exactly what you want a peanut butter cookie to taste like. Didn't change a thing."
"0","5","I used smooth peanut butter and 3 cups of flour, everyone LOVED them!!"
"0","4","I agree...flour needs to be increased. I increased to total 3 cups. In doing so, the peanut butter must be increased as well. I used 2 cups. Other than that, this recipe is golden. Tastes great, bakes evenly, and does NOT last long so eat some while you can!!"
"0","5","Loved these cookies! tweaked it a bit. This is def a keeper!"
"0","1","These were the driest cookies I have ever made. The dough was ao dry it looked like flour! Way too much flour. I had to add 1/3 cup of Milk to even be able to make these in a ball! Dissapointed."
"0","4","So good! I love that everyone tweaks these recipes to make them their own. Here are my tweaks: First of all, I used all ORGANIC ingredients, that makes all the difference in the world. I added 1/2 tspn of vanilla extract, added butterscotch chips, used salted butter, 1 tspn of salt instead of a 1/2, added a dash of nutmeg, and substituted pure honey & real maple syrup for the white sugar. I almost didn't finish these cookies because I couldn't stop eating the batter! If I could name my version of this recipe, I would call it Salted-Honey Peanut Butter Cookies. :)"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the peanut butter. I was 'loose' with that and added approximately 1/2 c. more. I also added a full (exact) 1/2 c. of flour knowing I liked a dryer outside texture for my cookie.   I used natural peanut butter (the kind you stir because the oil separates); a 50/50 mix of white and wheat flour; salted butter since I had no unsalted in the house (I omitted adding any additional salt to offset its content); and powdered egg mix (placing the water in the moist batter and the powder in with the flour).  The result was a beautiful cookie in appearance, texture and taste."
"0","5","THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! I did what Natalie66 did and they are so amazing. I will keep this one in my book!!!!"
"0","5","I've never found an enjoyable homemade peanut butter cookie recipe before this one. Needless to say, I was very impressed. I took JENNIFERC77's advice and added the extra 1/2 cup of flour, peanut butter, and teaspoon vanilla but also included a 10 oz. bag of peanut butter chips. Good Lord, they were decadent."
"0","5","Tasty and simple! Made them exactly as per the recipe and had no troubles with flat cookies - maybe it depends on the kind of peanut butter you use?! Also, I just pressed them with the fork enough to make the criss-cross pattern - not actually 'flattening' them. Will try adding vanilla next time."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe - perfect texture!!! It's so hard to stop eating these cookies! I added a tsp of vanilla and more peanut butter (a bit more than 1/4 cup), and family and friends LOVE these cookies.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!"
"0","5","Add a chocolate kiss to the center to create another layer of goodness -- or just enjoy this really great PB cookie recipe on it's own. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup PB, and 1 tsp vanilla. Wonderful texture and taste!"
"0","5","I added reese's pieces and dropped on cookie sheet (no criss-crossing). Delicious!"
"0","4","First, I must tell on myself. I am a very seasoned baker, but like all I have my oops moments. I made this recipe to the exact measurement, except I forgot the brown sugar!! They weren't that bad, very light in color and flavor, but the kids loved them!! Once I discovered my mistake (two pans in) I added the brown sugar and they turned out great!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect! They came out crunchy outside and moist inside......needless to say PERFECT! I also made a batch with chocolate chips that were just as delicious. If you have problems with this recipe it may be your baking soda or that you are handling the dough for fortoo longand letting it get soft in your hands. Try putting them back in the fridge for bout 10 minutes once you have them rolled o to your cookie sheets, then straight to the oven from there!"
"0","5","We loved these cookies!!!!"
"0","3","I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies all spread out and came out too thin. They were not very flavorful either. I won't be making this again."
"0","5","My fiancé was bragging for days about these cookies that I made him. Even his boss couldn't eat enough of them! Really are quite delicious and simple to make. I used creamy PB and salted butter."
"0","5","I loved this recipe all I did was add some Butterscotch Chips to it. These cookies were chewy and delicious. :)"
"0","5","I made this recipe for my hubby. I followed it to a 'T' mostly, but I cut all ingredients in half for a half recipe. I also omitted the salt (I never cook or bake with any salt). I had no problems of the cookies 'melting'. They came out looking delicious!"
"0","5","I am making this recipe for the second time today and both times they have turned out amazing. This recipe makes 3 dozen cookies and the last time I made them, they lasted 2 days and then they were gone. This timed I added chocolate chips to make them kind of like a Reese's and they are amazing!"
"0","5","Hello Bakers: I too read the helpful reviews for this recipe and decided to add a twist to it!!!! I added 3/4 cup of coconut, 1 teaspoon of vanilla flavoring, extra 1/4 cup of flour and peanut butter. The consistency was perfect for rolling into perfect balls for baking. I sprayed my cookie sheet with non-stick spray for easy removal. My husband was asleep in his recliner and the aroma awakened him and he was my sampler. His response: These are great!!! This recipe is definitely a KEEPER! Thank You. Terri Woods"
"0","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made. The only think I did different was before putting on the pan I rolled them in sugar then put them on the pan and criss crossed them. Most excellent and I will be making them again and again. They are awesome!"
"0","5","Just made these last night and had added vanilla since it did not call for it as I've always added it to my PB Cookies and extra peanut butter (bit of a fan). It was not until after making them reading the reviews while baking to find out that a few others had made the recommendation. Thank you to those that did. Other than that these turned out really cook as dad made a comment about them being really good (prefers chocolate over PB). This says something in my world. Thank you for the recipe Shirley."
"0","3","Too crumbly...needs butter."
"0","4","As written, I tasted more butter than peanut butter. I upped the peanut butter by 1/4 cup and decreased the butter by 1/4 cup. I like the new flavor."
"0","5","I have struggled to find soft peanut butter cookies for years and FINALLY! These are just the right mix of crunch and soft. My oven cook time took 12 minutes and not ten. But everything else was perfect!"
"0","4","Good cookie with a rich wonderful taste but it flattens out way too much. Would be bester if it keep more of it height but all in all it's still worth making."
"0","4","While the cookies come out almost perfectly round and acceptably good, they really need more peanut butter. Either that or a few chocolate chips. Or both. Because they just have a hint of peanut butter, not an 'in your face' peanut butter that both of us like.   Note: The cookies came out perfect. And I didn't refrigerate them at all."
"0","5","yum! love the cookies"
"0","4","I loved this recipe. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it was not the best one that I've come across. I had to bake the cookies for about 13-15 minutes instead of the 10 otherwise the cookies were doughy and just fell apart. Other than that, the recipe was good and my friends enjoyed it (they were attracted by the delicious smell and begged to try some)."
"0","5","These are SO good, that my husband will make them! He wants them THAT bad! lol PS. sometimes we add chocolate chips too :)"
"0","5","Yummy, 10 min at 375 in a convection oven is about 30-45 seconds too long."
"0","4","I really liked these. Like the others, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and 1/2 cup of flour and they turned out great C:"
"0","5","This is my 'go to' recipe for peanut butter cookies. This recipe makes a PERFECT, classic peanut butter cookie. I did as other suggested and added more peanut butter and also added some M&M's. I always half the recipe and it makes enough for my little family of three :-)"
"0","5","Delicious! Didn't change anything. I had a bit of leftover chocolate butter cream in the fridge and made sandwiches with a few. Not for the faint of heart or will power."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe, only change was double peanut butter."
"0","2","Too much flour. Add some vanilla, cut the flour in half."
"0","5","VERY GOOD"
"0","4","i loved this recipe! all i did was decrease the baking time to 8 min. and i used a plastic fork to press the cookie down. they looked just like the picture."
"0","5","I loved these cookies. Like other reviewers I added vanilla (1/2 tsp since I made a half batch) and cooked the cookies at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. The cookies turned out both chewy and yummy."
"0","4","With the suggestions from other reviewers these cookies were perfect. Add the extra peanut butter and flour as suggested."
"0","5","Simple and perfect"
"0","4","Delicious cookies. I added vanilla to the batter but other than that they were great."
"0","5","Great, simple recipe! My eldest teen makes these with ease. I substitute Crisco for the butter and they come out light and crispy every time. Give each dough ball enough room to spread on your cookie sheet - these do expand quite a bit."
"0","4","These had great texture and good flavor. I would've liked a little more peanut butter flavor so next time I might add some more peanut butter. I followed the recipe minus putting the dough in the fridge and I added chocolate chips."
"0","5","These cookies are so tender. Awesome! Make sure you refrigerate the dough because it was hard to handle being room temp. These are the best! I baked them 9 minutes and used creamy peanut butter."
"0","4","These cookies are very, very good. I've tried making them with smooth pb and crunchy. Crunchy is the best."
"0","5","These are very good, they are chewy, soft and easy to half the recipe (which I did). I did not find it necessary to add additional flour and/or PB which would throw the additional ingredients out of proportion. I used JIF smooth peanut butter so the taste was mild. If you use a natural PB, the taste would be bolder."
"0","5","These were yummy and I don't even like peanut butter very much. I followed another reviewers advice and added more peanut butter and they still came out fantastic. I have made several batches of these things and they are always consumed quickly by friends at parties. Love these"
"0","5","These weren't as dense as the cookie batter I remember, but were excellent when baked. Make sure to really squash the fork into the cookie before baking or you will lose the indents that a classic peanut butter cookie must have. Will make this one again."
"0","3","They are ok."
"0","5","Love this I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I ran out of vanilla which I always put in baking even if the recipe does not call for it. So I added vanilla coffee flavoring this was so good. My hubby took them to the office and brought back an empty bowl. Awesome"
"0","5","We also added 1/4 C. of both peanut butter and flour. They are perfect! Remember not to over bake. We've also tried adding 1/2 c. chocolate chips. The whole family loved them."
"0","4","One of the best peanut butter cookie recipes. I did cut the cooking time down to 10 minutes and cooled on the cookie sheet for no more than 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack."
"0","5","The mixture was all dry and crumbly and I kept re-reading the recipe and realized i had only put in 1 stick (1/2 c.) of the butter... so I pulled it out of the fridge and blended in another stick of butter and the mixture was perfect consistency. These cookies are awesome!!!"
"0","5","Really yummy and easy to make. A little crumbly, so not great for packing, but they were perfect with milk on a snowy day!"
"0","5","Fantastic!! Added 1/2c more flour, 1/4c more PB, 1/2 tsp vanilla and even put a few choco chips in some of them!! Delicious!"
"0","5","Really good cookies, not too sweet. We have peanut allergies so substituted soynut butter for peanut butter and it worked great."
"0","2","These cookies were too thin and not peanutty enough. It was a like flat butter wafer. Not impressed."
"0","5","Great recipe... I used shortening instead of butter though. They were yummy!"
"0","5","I just finished making these cookies... They are great!!!! You do have to add 1/2 cup extra of Peant butter and of Flour, I added 1 teaspone of vanilla.... they are great.... My husband said he does not eat peanut butter cookies and ended up eating 4 :o)"
"0","4","Just made these today. Followed the advise of other reviews, and added 1/4 of cup more flour and used a whole jar of peanut butter (we LOVE pb). I also added 1 cup of peanut butter chips, and 1 cup of chocolate chip. Kids gobbled them up. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","I made these vegan by using 'no Egg' egg substitute and earth balance in place of the butter... Then I made them gluten free by using a 50/50 of almond and oat flours. Chewy, perfect!!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","very nice recipe, chewy and crunchy, you all have to try it"
"0","5","Perfect"
"0","5","This was my first time making them, they were a hit. Baked them for exactly 10 minutes, all our kids loved them. Great, simple recipe."
"0","4","I used salted butter and omitted the salt. I cooked them at 350 since my oven runs high and cooked them for 9-10 min. They came out a little on the thin side but they were still good."
"0","5","Love these cookies made sugar free even! I don't do sugar so I substituted with Splenda white and brown. Very easy to put into the stand mixer and let it go. I must admit that I don't wait an hour to let the dough chill in the fridge because when I want a cookie, I want a cookie. These hit the spot with perfect texture and very moist."
"0","5","I have been experimenting with Domino Light Sugar and Stevia blend. It equals twice the sweetness of sugar so I used 1/2c. and used the 1 c. brown sugar. I used the suggestions of other reviews and used 2-3/4 c. flour and 1-1/2 c. pb. I made 1 ounce balls, and they took 13 minutes. Woowie kazowee-they came out so good I could eat them till I get sick, because there is less sugar-right?"
"0","4","These cookies were super easy to make and they made wonderful cookies that everyone liked."
"0","5","I usually use creamy peanut butter rather than crunchy, and I generally add an extra 1/2 cup for a stronger peanut butter flavor. I also chill the dough for at least three hours, and I take just enough dough out of the fridge to shape *one* batch before it goes in the oven, so the remaining dough never gets too warm and soft (which happens very quickly, especially after you shape it with warm hands); I take the next bit of dough out of the fridge for shaping about two minutes before the first comes out of the oven. I prefer a chewier cookie, so I cook mine for 13-14 minutes at 300 F, and allow them to cool for several minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring them to a wooden cutting board (otherwise they are too soft). Another reviewer mentioned not to flatten them with a fork, and that they will seem underdone when you remove them from the oven. I *always* flatten them with a fork just a little bit, but they do spread a little so don't go crazy with it; I usually do only eight per cookie sheet if I'm using my smaller pan, just to be sure they don't touch, but I have never had an issue with excessive spread. I do agree that you will likely think they are underdone when you take them out. They will flatten, harden and even darken just a tiny bit as they cool. This recipe has a large yield so you can always do a couple of test cookies to get the timing perfect for your oven. :)"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I made those yesterday (only 1 dozen) and they came out perfectly chewy, sweet and peanut buttery. I had no butter so I used the same amount of vegetable oil, but the taste is still fantastic. Just note that if you use oil they'll need to set for a couple of hours or overnight in an open jar to get the proper texture and aroma. Five stars without hesitation!"
"0","4","These are very good, but VERY rich! I can barely make it through one cookie! They have a great flavor and were definitely easy to make."
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly, without making any changes, and the cookies turned out wonderfully! They were a little difficult to get off the spatula, and would fall apart if you tried too hard to get them to come off on their own. (I only have one cookie sheet, so I don't have time between batches to wait for the cookies to cool on the sheet) I found that using a second spatula to push the cookie off the first spatula used to get the cookie off the baking sheet worked well enough. After cooling for a few minutes on waxed paper they held together just fine. I store my cookies in air tight containers with a piece of bread to keep them soft. :)"
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for 2 years and it is scrumptious!"
"0","5","These cookies were great! I am a fan of thinner, crunchier cookies. I may add a little more peanut butter next time."
"0","5","These are perfect"
"0","1","My batter came out all crumbly and unmanageable. I tried to bake them and they got even worse. I thought that with it having such good reviews I must have done something wrong. So I looked over the recipe again. Nope, I did everything correctly. SO I looked up another recipe for peanut butter cookies and found out the problem: this recepie HAS NO LIQUID!!! I took out my milk and vanilla extract before starting everything and when they didn't call for it in the ingredient list I thought it was a little bizzar, but followed the directions. BIG MISTAKE! Just go with another recipe in my opinion."
"0","5","Phenomenal! I've been searching for the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe and this one rocks! I think refrigerating the dough and using baking powder makes all the difference! However, I never met a recipe I didn't tweak. I made a batch and a half, using a full 16.3-oz. jar of peanut butter and 4 cups of flour. I used a small cookie scoop and baked 7 1/2 minutes. The search is over!"
"0","5","Even though I revised the recipe I feel it deserved 5 stars. I added 1 ts. of vanilla, an additional 1/4 c. peanut butter & flour, as stated in other reviews. I only had salted butter so I omitted the salt. Excellent cookies. The best I have ever made."
"0","4","Yummy."
"0","5","I tried this mainly due to the positive reviews~ and I was NOT disappointed The cookies came out delicious and I followed the instructions exactly . I did add the Hershey Kiss at end for Christmas cookies. This recipe is definitely worth keeping :)"
"0","5","These cookies were absolutely delicious. I managed to get exactly 24 1-ounce cookies. I would be interested to know how these would turn with all natural peanut butter. I also used a silpat to bake them on which made them spread out a bit more. Overall Excellent! Thank you Shirley!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I made these for Christmas, so I put Hershey kisses in the middle. NOTE: I baked these for 8min and 50sec and they were PERFECT! WARNING: These cookies are extremely addicting! Enjoy! :)"
"0","4","the cookies were a little to thin but other than that they were great soft and chewy my family like it..."
"0","5","loved this recipe. the cookies came out perfect."
"0","4","Really good. I doubled the recipe and it came out great. They bake better when the dough is really cold. If the dough was not cold, the cookie tended to flatten out more and burn a little. But the flavor was great! House smells so wonderful."
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","4","A very good base recipe made excellent with the changes suggested by other reviewers. For myself, I used 2 cups of peanut butter, increased the flour to 3 cups and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Since I am not big on plain peanut butter cookies, I press the dough into mini muffin tins with paper cup liners, bake and then finish immediately by pressing Trader Joe's peanut butter cups into the center of the hot cookie dough. Yummy!"
"0","5","Bake on top row of oven Don't overbake Use cream extra cup of peanut butter"
"0","5","we doubled the recipe and ate them all within 2 days they were so good."
"0","4","These came out pretty good, but a little to cakey. Next time I will use less, or maybe sift the flour."
"0","5","Best PB Cookie recipe yet! Cream the butter, sugars, and pb very well to make them light and airy. Do not skip the cooling, at least 30 mins in fridge so cookies don't flatten. Remove from oven just before edges golden, trust me, they will be done enough. So delicious! I also rounded the pb and flour, and added a tsp vanilla."
"0","4","This worked well, a moist and flavorful peanut butter cookie, though they did spread a bit more than anticipated. Next time I'll probably halve the size of the cookie."
"0","5","Only change I made was to add a tiny bit of vanilla. Turned out very nice."
"0","5","These cookies turned out great!! I added chocolate chips and used a cookie scoop instead of rolling and then flattened them a little with a fork. I brought them into work and everyone loved them. I even had to share this recipe."
"0","5","easy, yummy, only had organic creamy peanut butter and they still turned out really well. will add a bit more flour next time. maybe even a bit of sugar on the top to make them look nice."
"0","5","Great recipe. Followed it exactly."
"0","5","THE BEST PB cookies!!!!!"
"0","5","Great Recipe! i used white and whole wheat flour, turned out great!"
"0","5","I absolutely loved these cookies! I prefer creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy so I swapped that. It tasted just like my grandmother's peanut butter cookies...mmm! I agree with someone else that the cookies seemed a little thin, but I'm not sure how to fix that so I left it alone and they were still delicious."
"0","5","I myself am not a huge PB fan but my sister is and I wanted to make her her favorite cookies. While she hasn't had them YET (it's 2AM and she's sleeping), I had not one, not two, but three of these delicious cookies!   I cut the recipe to yield a dozen cookies (but I actually got 2 dozen) using the 1tbs scooper. For the dozen cookies I used 3/4 C of chunky PB and used 1.5 C of flour (or 1C + two 1/4 cups). I also froze my baking pan for 5-10 min while I rolled the balls placed them in sugar. I also know some people have trouble with the cookies, being 'flat' if you make them less than 1/2' thick you'll get thin cookies. Also if they 'spread wide' it could be your butter or you have too much wet ingredients. Once you chill the dough it shouldn't spread too much, so what you put in the oven is what you'll come out with.  I have a convection oven, so if you have one lower the temp to 350°F and put the timer for 8 min. I actually opened the door for about 15-20 sec and left it in there for another min. I've never made PB cookies before so I wasn't sure how 'dark' they get. But my cookies came out PERFECT! I also let them rest on the cookie sheet for about 2-3 min then moved them to a plate.   I omitted putting vanilla like some posters recommended. I believe that vanilla is really strong and would take away from the PB taste. Plus you wouldn't need the vanilla if you put more PB like others suggest. Let the PB stand out! No need to 'enhance' the flavor :)"
"0","5","Love this recipe...easy to make and a crowd pleaser!! I only had enough brown sugar for 1/2 cup....but still delicious... Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!"
"0","4","Very good! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Soft and delicious!"
"0","5","awesome cookies electric oven bake 355 for 12 mins."
"0","5","Great recipe! Used natural peanut butter instead of crunchy. Nice and crispy (which I like), not chewy. Adding this to my list of cookies to make again!"
"0","3","not my cup of tea. turned out looking good though."
"0","5","My family and I loved them.They where one of the best cookies ever.The peanutbutter smell was very strong.They where so yyuummmyy!"
"0","4","I left the dough in the fridge overnight based on other reviews, so I did not have a runny cookie issue. However, these were a bizarre combination of crispy and chewy, and the flavor wasn't great, which suprised me since the dough was very good. However, after they sat for a couple of hours, they softened up and got rave reviews from my students."
"0","5","Delicious! The only changes I made was that I mixed everything by hand, as I didnt have a mixer with me. And I used Splenda instead of the white sugar- in an attempt to save myself a few calories. So good that my husband asked me to make another batch to bring to his office to schmooze his boss."
"0","5","try using crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy if u like a little crunch :)"
"0","3","They were too flat, I like a thicker cookie"
"0","5","I used whole wheat flour extra crunchy peanut butter and veg oil in place of butter cause thats what i had and took out of oven at 8 min. Came out very moist and good! Very moist! I used 2 cups flour to account for whole wheat one up veg oil everything else is the same."
"0","5","Steve likes"
"0","5","I added more peanut butter, maybe a 1/4 cup. I added 3/4 cup flour more and 2 cups of chocolate chips. I then spread it in a cookie sheet and baked until very lightly brown. Delicious! Very moist and awesome flavor."
"0","4","These are good but,I prefer a chewy cookie so I added two Tablespoons of milk to mine and they turned out awesome."
"0","5","I always read the reviews before trying a new recipe and can never figure why people tweak recipes before they've even tried them. This is a SUPER recipe as it stands...no additions needed. The only thing I can think that some would want to do is use CREAMY PB instead of Crunchy. That's it. They baked up to be a super combo of crisp on the edges and soft/chewy in the center. I LOVE these and don't really even care for PB! Maybe dip the balls into a bowl of white sugar. NOT needed but makes them pretty!"
"0","5","These stayed moist for as long as the cookies lasted (about 1 week). The dough was so sticky...and the cookies were flat. BUT - Hubby said the cookies were yummy and addictive :) I guess that's a good thing!"
"0","5","I have always bought the easy packaged cookies. Was in the mood one day for cookies and didn't feel like running out to purchase anything so found this and had all ingredients on hand. Oh hooray for mixing yourself. .. I will NEVER buy the junk in a tube again! This were so good they didn't even last the day in my house. I added chocolate chips to mine =)"
"0","5","A amazing recipe.... I have made this at least 6 times.... The only thing I changed was by using regular butter instead of unsalted butter!!!!:)"
"0","2","Followed recommendations and still turned out too thin. Good taste, just too thin."
"0","5","everyone loved these. I added a bag of peanut butter chips and rolled them in sugar before baking. Delicious"
"0","5","Thank you for sharing this great recipe!! Turned out perfect and really are the 'classic' version of peanut butter cookies.   We like our cookies a little less sweet - so I always skimp on the sugar and don't pack the brown sugar when I measure. Absolutely wonderful!!"
"0","3","Cooked them for less than noted. Dry and crackle easy. I like soft yet chewy. I'll try making again."
"0","4","I made a few adjustments to this recipe based on other reviews.  I cut the flour down by 1/4 c and I added vanila and 1/2 c more peanut butter.  I used a fresh ground peanut butter in a Honey Roasted flavor from my health food section of my grocery store (YUM).  I baked the cookies for 7 minutes. They are perfect!"
"0","5","This cookie was the best peanut butter cookie I ever made! I did add 1/4 c more peanut butter and tsp vanilla and they were perfect! Thanks everyone with the great suggestions to improve the flavor and chewiness. I will make them again!"
"0","5","love these cookies every time I make them they are gone the same day today I'm going to put chocolate chips in them"
"0","5","They were wonderful and disappeared really quickly. We also added extra PB and flour and dipped in sugar before baking."
"0","5","Phenomenal! I did add a bit more flour and peanut butter than the recipe called for, and added 1 tsp vanilla, after reading other users' comments. This is now, and forever will be, my new go-to. Thanks!"
"0","5","i made these for my dad although i don't like peanut butter cookies much he loved them,he shared them with the people at work and they said they were some of the best peanut butter cookies they've had :)"
"0","5","Wonderful! I just made them and suddenly I was at home in my Mom's kitchen of 50 years ago. I added raisins and left the recipe as was--yum!"
"0","5","I love this recipe I use only 2 cups of flower and 1 cup of shortening the oven temp I reduced it to 325 for 9 to 10 mminutes andlet them stand cooling for 5 minutes, they were perfect....."
"0","4","Through reading the reviews of others, I decided to modify the recipe. I increased the flour and peanut butter by 1/4 cups each. I used creamy peanut butter, also. I dislike crunchy very much. Next time I bake these, I will be dipping them in sugar before I bake. My husband loved them and his friends went crazy over them!"
"0","5","Really awesome cookies! I followed other reviews and added 1/2 cup more PB, 1/2 more floor and vanilla. I used organic crunchy peanut butter. The cookies came out perfect =)"
"0","5","Best one I've tried"
"0","4","So good! First to note, the recipe made 5 dozen cookies for me (when I measured with 1tbs measure). I altered the recipe as the others did, adding 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp vanilla. They turned out great! Also put a chunk of chocolate in the center just out of the oven and it worked well. The dough is a little dry and crumbly, so I'll have to work on that.... Overall, fantastic!"
"0","5","My husband LOVES these!"
"0","5","increased the flour by 1/2 cup along with increasing the peanut butter by 1/2 cup. also added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Fabulous cookie....my family loved them."
"0","1","I did not care for these."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I run a daycare and these cookies are truly a hit! I followed another advice and added 1/2 cup more PB and 1/2 cup more flour. Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe! Like others, I added an extra 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and dipped in sugar before baking at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until light brown. Perfect cookies!"
"0","2","Wanted this recipe to work but was not for me. There was no taste to the cookies. I made exactly as written. Maybe like others have said this would have been better with more peanut butter."
"0","5","These cookies are a family favourite!"
"0","5","Fantastic!"
"0","5","Excellant! The only change I made was to add about 1/2 cup chocolate chips."
"0","4","Although these cookies lacked a certain something, the texture was fantastic. I did add a bit of cinnamon as the other reviews advised and that happened to be the only real flavor that came through. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the texture was so great."
"0","5","These cookies were perfect just as the recipe is written. I used homemade peanut butter and even thumbprinted a few and topped with jelly. They were VERY popular with guests!"
"0","5","A fabulous recipe! I doubled it, assuming (like most) that this recipe would only make a few, but I easily have 50 good-sized cookies."
"0","5","your cookies look so go i wish i had some now they look so pretty and neatly shaped cant wait to make them thanks for sharing"
"0","5","The bottom line is this recipe made for some delicious cookies! The only change I made at first was to double this recipe. However, after the 1 hour chill time, the dough was very crumbly and I had trouble making dough balls. I threw the bowl on the mixer, added about 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, and the texture/consistency was much improved. I also sprinkled the dough with sugar just prior to baking. 10 minutes cooked these to perfection in my oven."
"0","5","I used salted butter and creamy peanut butter because that's what I had on hand. I quartered the recipe to only make one dozen.  I didn't chill them, because let's get real - some of us can't wait that long. They were just right to handle.  After I flattened them with a fork, I piled up a lot of sugar on top of each one and baked at 325 for 15 minutes because I like my cookies a little drier. They were perfect for my taste. Thanks!"
"0","5","I made these cookies this morning and they are delicious. I did make a couple changes like other suggested. I did 1 1/2 cups peanut butter , 3 cups flour and 1 tsp vanilla."
"0","1","came out way to thin."
"0","5","Fantastic Recipe! Added a bit more crunchy peanut butter and flour, and also added a teaspoon of vanilla, because of other comments' advice. (Thanks, guys!) I doubled the recipe and rolled them up and froze them. They freeze beautifully. Now, whenever I want a peanut butter cookie (which has been quite often), I just slice a bit of a cookie dough roll and put in on the tray. Then, when the oven's preheated, I roll each cookie into a ball and crisscross with a fork, and pop them into a 375 degrees (F) oven for 9 min. :)"
"0","5","These were a huge hit @ work! Prfect PB cookies!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious. Probably the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made."
"0","5","Made so many cookies :) Had fun eating all of them :) Great recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious simply put."
"0","5","Just like mom use to make! My mom use to make the best peanut butter cookies but we haven't been able to locate her recipe. This is the closest we've found and they turned out great. Did half the batch just as the recipe calls and half the batch with a chocolate button pressed in the middle prior to baking."
"0","5","I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter cookies, but these were awesome!!!! Only think I did different was add chochlate chips before putting them in the refigerator. Love the recipe, and I will make these again."
"0","5","My husband did a happy dance upon eating these."
"0","5","I followed the recipe to the letter and think they're perfect! Just popped a Hershey's kiss in each one when they came out of the oven."
"0","4","Even after refrigerating for an hour the dough was very sticky. To remedy, I rolled each ball in sugar. These cookies really spread out and become thin when cooked. To make them not so crispy I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes. This is a really good cookie. I do prefer mine a little thicker though."
"0","5","I changed the recipe up a little by using 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added a tsp of vanilla flavoring. the cookies turned out great =-)"
"0","4","Pretty good!"
"0","5","Perfect!"
"0","5","Love it! I added 1tsp vanilla to give some flavor. A good dessert and home made gifts for holidays! My family loves it! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"0","2","I did not like them. The cookies tasted flat. Like it was missing something. Not what I was looking for."
"0","5","Great cookie recipe. I used Splenda for the 1 cup of white sugar and changed the flour to 3 cups. I also added approx 1/2 cup choc chips to the last half of the batter before baking. So I had two kinds of cookies from one recipe ! A keeper !"
"0","5","Yummy, yummy, yummy! Followed the recipe exactly except I used a dark chocolate peanut butter and I rolled the top of the cookie in sugar. They did not last long."
"0","5","Made just as the recipe called for, they were excellent. My family's favorite."
"0","4","Just outstanding!!! I didn't bake for the full 10 minutes, because they come out softer this way."
"0","5","I didn't make any changes to the ingredients. I DID however change the size of the dough ball. I like my cookies BIG! So I rolled about about a 2'-3' ball, flatted with a sugar coated fork and baked for about 10 minutes. They are crispy on the top, and soft and chewy on the inside. . they are FABULOUS!!!  I didn't refrigerate my dough, and I also used country crock margarine instead of unsalted butter. Seriously, these cookies are amazing!"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome! My family loved it. I even added choc chips to the batter! These cookies didn't last long at all! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","This is a really great recipe for peanut butter cookies! Forgiving too, as I messed it up! I only had one egg, so for the other one I substitued 4 tbsp mayo, and increased the flour just a bit. Also added one tsp of vanilla. Rolled into almost golf-ball sized balls and flattened with a fork both ways, baked for 11 minutes. They are crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside...wonderful recipe!"
"0","4","These cookies are super! I did change up the recipe a bit. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, 3 cups flour and 2 cups of peanut butter. But, they turned out so soft! A little crunchy on the bottom, but that is my fault. Otherwise, they are really good."
"0","5","Perfect! This recipe made 70 cookies. I followed recommendations to add an extra half cup each of flour and peanut butter."
"0","4","Very good, although I sugar substitutes because my husband is diabetic. Turned out excellant!!"
"0","5","Perfect everything with this recipe! Even the 10 minute timing was perfect! I did roll the balls in sugar and then did the criss-cross pattern with a fork as I believe all PB cookies should have this distinctive mark!   Just remember... if the recipe calls for BUTTER use BUTTER not oleo or margarine. Using the other will make your cookies thin and spread out."
"0","4","This was good with changes suggested by others - I split the batch in half, then added 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup soy flour. I used smooth peanut butter because it was all I had and I also cooked at 165 for 8 minutes. Came out yummy!"
"0","4","I gave 4 stars because I haven't actually tried them yet but they look fantastic...has anyone tried these with almond butter? My son is allergic to peanuts. Would you have to add extra sugar? Thanks for your help!"
"0","5","Very tasty!"
"0","5","Peanut buttery, crumbly, decadent... everything you want in a classic peanut butter cookie. The only changes I made were using smooth peanut butter instead or crunchy, and dark brown sugar instead of brown and that was what I had on hand. Delicious. I will make these again."
"0","5","great recipe i did add more peanut butter about 1/4 cup came out perfect"
"0","3","I used the cookie recipe as a basis to making glutein free almond butter cookies. I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter ( we have a peanut allergy in the house) and rice flour for the reg flour (we are trying gluetin free for heath reasons) otherwise I did everything as stated. The flavor was good, but they are thin and crumbly as several people stated. There is also a slight grainy feel to the texture when eating. I am not sure what caused this at this time. Over all it was a pretty good cookie and the kids liked them. We will try it again with the suggestions that we found here. Thanks"
"0","5","My family loved these but i made a huge mistake. I used 1 cup of creamy peanut butter and 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter instead if butter and peanut butter. They were still great and I will probably continue to make them without the butter."
"0","5","These taste like they did when I was a kid!"
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly as it says, however I made half plain and half with semisweet chocolate chips. My family & friends loved them and so did I."
"0","5","these turned out great. i followed other readers' advice and added 1/2 cup flour and about a half a cup of peanut butter. i also added added a bit of brown sugar to the cookies before flattening them down with the fork. made exactly 24 baked for 10 minutes and they came out perfect! next time i want to add a little hershey's kiss to the center of each one. yum :)"
"0","2","My peanut butter lovin husband was not impressed. It may be that he likes soft cookies better! These were not soft and chewy."
"0","5","my new 'go to' peanut butter cookie recipe!! these turned out awesome!!"
"0","5","Best recipe I've ever found for PB Cookies. Very moist. I sometimes add chocolate chips for a change."
"0","5","First time making cookies from scratch and these were AWESOME. I did add some chocolate chips to mine cause I had them and they are wonderful. Even after 48 hours they are still soft and scrumptious. I would not use any other recipe other than this one."
"0","5","I will use this recipe every time I make peanut butter cookies now. Great peanuty flavor, and just slightly chewy if taken out of the oven at the perfect time. YUM!"
"0","5","Used half whole wheat flour, half unbleached white flour, and these turned out delicious!"
"0","5","Double yum! I baked at 350 and cooked about nine minutes; cookies were still soft when I took them off the sheet after two minutes of cooling but nice and brown on the bottoms. Added the vanilla per others and tweaked flour and peanut butter also as others suggested. In addition, I mixed in some Heath toffee bits, my 'go to' secret ingredient for many cookies. Easy and yummy, highly recommend."
"0","5","best pb cookies ever"
"0","5","not too sweet and not bland, its perfect because my family likes desserts that have less sugar"
"0","5","I used can't believe it's not butter and sugar in the raw instead of brown sugar, they were delicious! I also rolled them in sugar bf baking them!"
"0","5","Awesome cookies!!! Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","I loved these cookies! I added more peanut butter and used 1.5 cups of oat (and 1 cup of white) flour instead of all white. I used a bit of oil instead of butter. I also added nuttela, chocolate chunks, and cocoa powder to give it some new flavors! They turned out great!!! They taste like Reese cookies!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome!!! The hubby love them. I just baked a few and froze the rest of the dough. Now when we want peanut butter cookies, my husband or I can just slice some off and bake them. Thanks Shirley for the recipe for some great tasting cookies."
"0","5","The family loved the cookies. I added a small chunk of Lindt dark chocolate on top to 1/2 the batch. The girls enjoyed them but overall they said they really preferred them without chocolate. Imagine, my wife asking me to make a cookie without chocolate...go figure. Great cookie recipe."
"0","5","I thought this recipe was fantastic. I made it w/ half reg flour & half whole grain flour and used 1c applesauce in place of the butter & it turned out SO good! I did add 1/2c more of peanut butter and 1c more of flour, as others recommended. You can also put a hershey kiss in the middle after removing from the oven for a more fancy presentation:)"
"0","5","this is excellent!"
"0","5","Best peanut butter cookies EVER! Family loved them. They were even hiding cookies and saving them for later!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I will definitely use this again."
"0","2","not peanut-buttery enough, and way too much butter----you can taste the butter prominently."
"0","4","Originally I had rated these a 5 right out of the oven, but after a day or two I have noticed that the butter is way too much. With the peanut butter, they are almost like a shortbread cookie. I think the butter could be reduced in proportion with any extra PB you may add. Original review ---> Just came out of the oven and these are pretty good. I bake a lot but have never made peanut butter cookies before, so I used this as a guide. I would agree that you need to increase the PB by at least 1/3 cup to get a good peanut flavor. I also reduced the sugar by 1/4c each because these are already pretty fattening, esp. if you use sweetened PB. I did not use crunchy PB but I did add about 1c rolled oats and they are great! Cooked at 350 for 10 min, may reduce the next batch to 9 min since we like softer cookies."
"0","5","really good recipe"
"0","4","These ones are very good. I added walnuts , my husband says I always add the wrong nut. Do not try the peanut butterX recipe it is terrible!!!"
"0","5","Best PB cookie recipe I've ever tried, and there have been many over the years. I was never thrilled with the results, but finally the search is over for the perfect cookie. I did add 1/4 cup PB and 1/4 cup flour after reading some of the reviews and I only had salted butter so I left out the salt. Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","Yummy! Just like mom makes! Be sure to space them far enough not to join too much.(like I didn't) reduces the crispy edge:( But chewy as they ran together was still good! I made a double batch!"
"0","4","Ok as written. Cookies were a bit flat even with refrigerating the dough between batches. Will try the addition of 1/4 more flour and peanut butter next time as others have indicated. Still very tasty."
"0","5","This recipe is great! The edges are crispy and the middle it chewy. The best peanut butter cookie. :o)"
"0","5","Awesome recipe, i changed it to be diabetic friendly and used splenda and splenda brn suger substitute. Used the no sugar/ no salt peanut butter. Took a little bit longer to bake.. about 15-17 minutes but turned out awesome!! thanks"
"0","5","Awesome! Came out great!!"
"0","4","Awesome cookies! I didn't read the reviews until after I started making the batch so now I know what I need to tweak next time. I am just starting to cook so this was lots of fun for me. Thanks!"
"0","5","I also increased the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup more peanut butter. Baked at 350 for about 9 minutes they came out perfect."
"0","5","These really are classic. I added a 1/2 c peanut butter and flour as well as 1 tsp vanilla. Loved the idea of dipping half of each cookie in choc. almond bark."
"0","4","Oh so yum! I too, increased the peanut butter. However, I didn't add any extra flour. Also cut back white sugar by 1/4 cup. Added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Cookies were perfectly flavorful and chewy after baking at 350F for 12 mins! (I didn't refrigerate them) I also ended up with 36 cookies instead for 24... depends on how big/small you like them to be I guess."
"0","5","These cookies r great one thing I make sure to refrigerate over night after making the dough so they cook soft and chewy if not they come out flat and crispy"
"0","5","These were very good cookies! I used 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter, and about 1/2 cup of the creamy kind. I added a little vanilla (just because I do to almost everything). I rolled into balls and then rolled the top parts around in sugar before making the criss cross patern with fork. Don't flatten them too much or they will be thin and crispy. I also only baked them for about 8 minutes and they were perfectly soft. Great recipe; thank you!"
"0","5","Wow! Amazingly good! I used whole grain all natural flour and they came out great. My husband is a huge fan of peanut butter cookies and he just loved them. The best part about the recipe is that you can make a few changes and it still comes out great. Sometimes we don't have chunky peanut butter or we use all natural peanut butter. We sometimes use the splenda and brown sugar mix. It's just a great recipe."
"0","5","to my exp. i used self-rising flour over using all purpose, baking soda and baking powder...makes better thicker cookies and uses less ingredients. as well, i used vanilla (2 tsp.)"
"0","5","My husband thought these were great (he likes his cookies crispy). I used creamy peanut butter, and made a half batch. He ate about 8 of them in 2 hours..."
"0","5","These were exactly what I was looking for. I added 1/2 t. vanilla and, like other viewers suggested, I added an additional 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup flour. Also, I baked them for 8 minutes--don't overbake! They were soft and chewy. Reese's Pieces are a fun add-in too!"
"0","5","Used 2/3 c. sugar (mostly brown) and added a dash of vanilla. Delicious."
"0","5","These cookies were amazing. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and loved how they came out. I have no mixer, so mixed by hand (wooden spoon) and they were just great. They are a little dryish, and moist at the same time. I normally like gooey cookies better, but this rocked my world. Amazing with some vannilla ice cream or to eat with coffee!"
"0","4","the only thing i don't like about these cookies is,that you have to refrigerate them in an hour,it's not convenient when you're in a hurry,but they were great,nice recipe."
"0","5","I too added a 1/2c more flour and 1/2c more pb and 1tsp vanilla, I then added 1 and half cups of chocolate chips, instead of making regular cookies, I rolled them onto baking sheet and made bar cookies, they were wonderful!! I also baked them at 350 and adjusted bake time to 15 minutes."
"0","5","Perfect cookies every time.I sometimes make a batch with a hershey's kiss or reese's miniature peanut butter cup pressed into the center,otherwise I don't change a single thing.I've made them at least ten times and I can't see any reason to ever use another recipe for peanut butter cookies.Thanks:)"
"0","5","I followed some of the other suggestions, more flour, more peanut butter and some vanilla. They are soft and beautiful. I make then for a coworker and he thinks they are the best peanut butter cookies he has ever had! Thanks for this great recipe!"
"0","4","This is exactly the same recipe as Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book that I grew up with. One variation is to make round balls then push one hershey's kiss on top of each to slightly flatten before baking. Absolutely delicious. We called them peanut butter kisses."
"0","4","This was a good base recipe. I cut the sugar in half, added a 1/4 more peanut butter and flour (like other reviewers suggested). I only had one egg, and I used safflower oil to make up for the difference. I tried reducing the oven heat to 350, and the cookies took way to long to bake (my cookies were pretty big). Keep original baking instructions, or use your best judgement!"
"0","5","These were really good, I'll definitely make these again."
"0","4","Nice and moist, followed others suggestions of more flour and peanut butter"
"0","5","I cut this recipe in half because I didn't have enough peanut butter on hand...it came out perfect. I was thinking of taking these over to my friend's house to share, but I don't want to!"
"0","5","I made these cookies a few weeks ago, and my friends can't stop bugging me to make more! By far the best peanut butter recipe ever, and I too followed the increase in peanut butter and flour, they are delicious every time!"
"0","5","Very tasty! I also added an extra 1/4 cup flour and peanut butter as well as some vanilla. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup of each which made a less sweet but still delicious cookie!"
"0","4","I added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter and also another 3/4 cup of flour. I also lowered my temperature to 350 and baked approximately 10 minutes. They came out kinda of crunchy on the edges and nice and soft in the center, just like my family likes them."
"0","5","Although I read the tips from others I didnt change anything except using a mix of crunchy and smooth peanut butter and I added about an extra half cup. I also creamed the butters and sugars for a little longer than normal and added a splash of almond extract. The cookies came out perfect! Not thin or too crispy at all! A recipe I'll definitely use again. Thanks!!"
"0","5","Great recipe,one of the best cookies"
"0","5","I use 100% whole wheat flour - I think it tastes better (and slightly better for you too!)"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies ever, my husband hates peanut butter and still loved these thanks for the recipe! By the way I used regular penaut butter instead of crunchy."
"0","4","Delicious cookies! I used creamy PB and added more than the recipe called for as other reviews advised. The cookies came out a bit less chewy than I hoped but taste wonderful."
"0","5","I followed the recipe, and these taste just like I remember them as a kid!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe although I did follow others suggestions. I increased the flour to 2 3/4 c. and the crunchy peanut butter to 1 1/4 c. Other than that I followed the recipe. I chilled the dough for one hour. Instead of making cookies, I used 2 smaller sheet pans 14' x 10' and spread out the dough. I cooked for approx. 12-13 minutes each but you have to check after 10 minutes. I cut into small size bars. My husbands favorite cookie is peanut butter and he loved them. Thanks alot Shirley, Debra"
"0","5","My Grandma asked for 'real' peanut butter cookies for the holidays. She loves these so much that she's rationed herself by putting two cookies in a baggie and freezing them! I followed some of the suggested alterations, such as adding more peanut butter and adding vanilla extract. I also used smooth pb instead of chunky. Delicious!"
"0","5","Love this old fashioned recipe! I cooked them for about 8 minutes...perfect!! Also dip your fork in water before flattening the cookie...it will prevent the cookie from sticking to the fork."
"0","4","This a great basic peanut butter cookie recipe. There's so much you can do with it. I have some health-conscious people in my household, so I did make a few modifications. I subbed half the butter with applesauce and subbed the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. Based on other people's recommendations, I increased the amount of peaut butter by 1/2 cup and the amount of flour by 1/4 cup. I used a dark chocolate peanut butter, and since it was already sweetened, I reduced the 1 cup brown sugar to 3/4 cup and the 1 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup. They turned out great!"
"0","5","Oh wow...these are the best peanut butter cookies ever. Of course Pampered Chef's stoneware makes every batch better. I cut this in half and still got almost 3 dozen out of it. Great!"
"0","4","These cookies turned out very tasty. I do suggest to add about 3/4 of a cup extra peanut butter. The first batch I made did not taste peanut buttery enough so I tossed in some extra and they were delicious."
"0","5","Perfect recipe! My first time making Peanut Butter cookies and they turned out wonderful."
"0","5","Wonderful cookies. I used extra crunchy JIF. I had way more than 24 cookies if 1 serving is 1 cookie. Definitely a keeper."
"0","3","Good flavor but not chewy."
"0","5","Great cookies! We loved them!"
"0","4","I made 2 batches of the recipe. For the most part, the cookies were good. Only comment I have is that they were not peanut buttery enough. I even added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and still wasn't quite enough. Other that that, the recipe is good."
"0","4","the extra half cup of peanut butter and half cup of flour is ideal plus 1 teaspoon of vanilla is good"
"0","5","The only modification I made was omitting the criss-cross pattern; it didn't work for me. What did work was to roll the dough into balls, as instructed, then flatten them with a spatula before baking. One other note, I formed 2 inch balls instead of 1 inch, again, this worked for me since I love large, chewy cookies."
"0","5","these were delish. Very good. My sons-in-law loved them."
"0","3","I followed the recipe, but added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter as a reviewer had suggested, but still, the cookie was too crunchy/hard for my taste. If you like soft and chewy cookies, this recipe may not be for you!"
"0","5","I made the adjustments that some suggested and they came out amazing. So good!"
"0","5","These were great, they are my go to peanut butter cookie now. I took other reviewers suggestions and increased both the peanut butter and flour. I rolled these in granulated sugar before marking with a fork."
"0","4","Great recipe! I just made them for the first time (my first time ever attempting peanut butter cookies, in fact), and they turned out quite well. Like some other users, I added extra flour and peanut butter and reduced the cooking temperature to 350. Thanks! I'll definitely make them again. :)"
"0","4","They were amazing. I added a little more peanut butter and 1/4 tsp. of vanilla. Half way through the batch i added chocolate chips and found that it added more flavour. This recipie was really good, but not the best i've ever had. I will make it again : )"
"0","5","yummy!"
"0","5","these are so good !!!!"
"0","4","Pretty good, a little bit thicker than I wanted. But all in all a good recipe. Thanks!@"
"0","5","Delicious! I used these to make pb blossom cookies and it turned out fine for me. I followed the recipe as it was. Thanks!"
"0","4","these are really good but I wanted MORE of a peanut butter flavor....I suggest using the crunch peanut butter like suggested I used the 'smooth' and thought they were just good not 'great'. :)"
"0","5","Super easy and tasty. I refrigerated the cookie dough overnight and it baked up nicely the next morning. It was a fun activity w/my 3 yr old who liked to roll the cookie balls in the sugar."
"0","5","very easy to make, and good"
"0","5","These were very easy to make and made a great snack! Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"0","4","very easy. pretty good... LOTS OF PEANUT BUTTER FLAVOR!"
"0","3","I followed this recipe to the letter and, for me, the cookies came out thin and did not have quite enough peanut butter flavor."
"0","3","after reading all of the reviews I decided to split the recipee in half. Half I made with the recipee shown, and half I added a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of flower and 1/2 of peanut butter. the half that I added to tasted better but was very flakey and crumbled appart with the lightest touch. but the half I did nothing to was blan and very thin."
"0","5","These cookies are deeeelish! It was my first time baking peanut butter cookies, and certainly not my last... and I don't think I will be straying from this recipe. :) I cut this recipe in half due to on-hand ingredients, but still managed to get two dozen out of it (I must have made them smaller). I only had creamy peanut butter on hand (and I used about 1/4 c. more than listed for half the recipe), and I reduced the sugars to preference. These came out slightly crisp (not crunchy) on the outside but extremely soft on the inside.. perfect! Although, straight out of the oven, they were not *as* soft/creamy/melt in your mouth.. but I put in fridge overnight and then brought them back out in the morning and took to work.. and that seemed to set them very nicely. Major raves from even the pickiest eaters. :) I baked these on parchment lined baking sheets that I sprayed lightly with cooking oil spray. The recipe doesn't state ungreased or greased."
"0","5","I'm eating one of these as I review the recipe. We made the recipe, only using creamy peanut butter instead. Followed the rest of the ingredients exactly - no additions. We did reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked for 9 minutes. They didn't look done but as suggested in other reviews, we took them out and let them sit on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before removing to the cooling rack (we always put a paper towel on the cooling racks to catch excess butter) and cooled. Then we turn them over once we can handle them and allow to cool completely. They were great!!!! 8 minutes will give you gooey cookies. 9 minutes they are a little firmer and 10 minutes will give you firm but chewy cookies. My 17 yr old son is making these to take to a dinner tomorrow (Thanksgiving Day) and he wanted to make two types of cookies, and I suggested one be peanut butter. They have turned out great. My son says this is definitely a keeper. One note about the peanut butter, we had a 15 ounce jar and just put in about half the jar. Great job!"
"0","5","great recipe, i loved it. But does anyone have any idea how to make it chewy? mine turned out really crunchy."
"0","4","These were delicious cookies- but if you are wanting to make the peanut butter cookies with the chocolate kisses on top do not use this recipe as they come out too flat (even if you start with tight little balls)."
"0","5","These were perfect! I did make one change. I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter. The best pb cookies i've ever made. Perfect texture, perfect flavor. Yum.!"
"0","5","I made these cookies a couple of days ago and they are gone, gone , goone. My family loved them. I have searched for a really good basic recipe for years and tried many, and this is the best I've made. Thank you!"
"0","4","These cookies are fantastic! I followed other reviewers' comments and upped the peanut butter and flour and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I took them to work and got very good reviews (unusual as they're not a PB loving crowd!). I will be making these many times in the future. I have also used this recipe with great success in a cookie press - it was a bit stiff however and I think I'll leave out the extra flour for the press. Only four stars as I had to modify the recipe."
"0","5","this was a perfect recipe."
"0","5","I use 1-1/4c peanut butter, 2-3/4c flour, and egg substitute (vegan). These are wicked-good cookies and everyone who tries them loves them. I give them 5 stars even with the egg substitute but I bet they are even better with real eggs."
"0","5","I keep this in my kitchen at all times to make cookies whenever I want something sweet and quick. GREAT RECIPE"
"0","5","Perfect...used smooth instead of chunky cause thats what I had on hand....will definately try with chunky. Really yummy."
"0","5","My fiance loved them!! Easy to make and come out perfect every time!! Yummy!!"
"0","5","These were very yummy and easy to make. I will be making these again for sure."
"0","4","Really good cookies. Baked nicely as well. I will add more peanut butter next time, just because I like a stronger pb flavor"
"0","4","This recipe is pretty good for basic peanut butter cookies. They're best if you press a chocolate kiss in the middle of each cookie right when you take it out of the oven to make peanut butter blossoms. I also roll the balls of dough in sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet. Peanut butter blossoms are a family favorite for us, especially around the holidays."
"0","4","The cookies spread a lot so I recommend reducing the butter to 3/4c or increasing the flour to 3 cups. Otherwise, very tasty!"
"0","5","Loved this recipe! Yum Yum."
"0","5","Great cookies!"
"0","5","Excellent. Even added chocolate chips once for something different."
"0","4","these were some good peanut butter cookies. i actually halved this recipe so i increased the peanut butter and the flour by 1/4 cup. even though i only made half the recipe called for i still came out with 3 dozen cookies. i made half normally and half with dark chocolate hershey kisses pressed into the middle. make sure to refrigerate thoroughly before you bake these guys or else you can hardly shape them into balls."
"0","5","wonderful and simple to make, especially with the aid of a stand mixer. definitely increase the amount of peanut butter by 1/4-1/2 cup."
"0","5","This is the first time that I made peanut butter cookies and they turned out so good! I was very proud of myself, but I have Shirley to thank for the great recipe! I didn't have unsalted butter or baking powder, so I just used regular butter (cut the salt ingredient to 1/4 teaspoon) and no baking powder and they still turned out good. I have a tip - if you spray your fork with some PAM before pressing it in the cookie it won't stick and mess up the design."
"0","1","flat"
"0","5","If you cook it a couple more minutes, it is at least just as good. (2 out of 3 people said better)"
"0","5","These were terrific! I added 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter, but other than that went right by the recipe. They turned out just a bit crisp but still tender. I could'nt wait the hour in the frig so I did 20 minutes in the freezer and they turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","i made double the recipe and adding vnilla just felt right.lol. so i added 3 tsp of it. we got 5 dozen out of it and they are ggggreat! thanks!"
"0","5","The best peanut butter cookie recipe ever...I've been using this recipe for a long time and always get rave reviews! They melt in your mouth!"
"0","5","These cookies remind me of 'melt in your mouth' sugar cookies, but with peanut butter. We grade any new recipe I make and I got an A+ for these. LOVE them. I made them just as the recipe states. Made 3 1/2 dozen."
"0","4","MMM... yummy! I halved the recipe (there's only two of us) and added 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup peanut butter. They turned out lighter and fluffier than other pb cookies I've had and I loved them, still sweet enough for milk, but not heavy enough to make me sick. The half recipe made about 2 dozen cookies."
"0","5","Better than dad's recipe"
"0","5","I followed this recipe to the letter and they were delicious! The only difference is that I used smooth peanut butter (only because it's my preference). I made a double batch of these cookies and took them to a picnic and they were all gone in a couple of hours. Definitely a keeper! Oh, and the cookie dough is delicious!"
"0","4","I love all the recipes I get on here, and this was no exception. I had looked around for several other recipes and this was by far the best."
"0","5","I really enjoyed these cookies and so did my family. The only thing I changed was that I halved all the ingredients because I had a shortage of peanut butter on hand. I baked them at 190 degrees celcius for 9 minutes and they were perfect!! I didn't have the problem of the dough being too thin because I refigerated the dough for 90 minutes and between batches I put the dough back into the refrigerator."
"0","5","These turned out pretty good. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used regular sugar and the taste was still fantastic. Would make them again!"
"0","5","This recipe is so easy to make and has one of the best peanut butter flavors I have ever had."
"0","5","these are absolutely delicious!! my husband said they were the best peanut butter cookies he's ever eaten, and he is a PB cookie fanatic! wonderful!"
"0","5","Made cookies exactly as written, turned out great! They were perfect combination of crispy and chewy. Family all loved!"
"0","3","I used crisco instead of butter which, of course didn't spread AT ALL. Otherwise I think these would have been okay. They are lacking a bit in flavor."
"0","4","Yummy! Some alterations: - used half of the recipe - added chocolate chips - used egg whites instead - used a little bit of my left over Splenda in the white sugar mix - used almond butter instead of peanut butter - sifted flour twice (for no particular reason) - a dash of Benefiber - let batter sit in fridge for ~2 hours - rolled into tiny half dollar-sized balls (did not melt out very much, good size for me to eat though) - baked at 350F for 7 minutes This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","4","Had to make changes, so that's why I deducted a star. I added more flour and more Peanut Butter (about 1/4 each). I used extra crunchy Peanut Butter. They were great, but watch closely - they overcook easily. Also people who said they got 2 dozen cookies must have made some really big cookies. I got four dozen and I don't think the extra flour and Peanut Butter accounted for that."
"0","4","These were the bomb. I lessened the amount of baking powder and soda, and flour by a bit, and added a bit more peanut butter. I only put 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and they were pretty salty so maybe it depends on what pb you use. Overall though, they were sooo frickin good."
"0","5","followed advice and increased peanut butter and flour. excellent."
"0","4","These were actually pretty good. I did however made some slight changes. Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I added 1/4 of Brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I substitute half of the flour with whole wheat flour and used bread flour instead. I also added semi-chocolate chips on top for decorations. It turned out great! If your looking for chewy cookies don't go buy my recipe! it came out like shortbread cookies. Enjoy! =]"
"0","4","I followed the advice of others and added a half cup more of the peanut butter and flour. I made them for my boyfriend who very rarely compliments anything and he told me they were 'awesome'. I will definately keep this recipe!"
"0","3","Not very flavorful. Seemed to have more of a flour taste than peanut butter. Good texture"
"0","4","My fiance loved these, but I found they lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. Maybe I'll try adding the vanilla as others suggested next time, and will ad more peanut butter. They did come out nice and moist, and had a good consistency though. Update: I tried these with a tsp of vanilla and they were perfect... Upped my review from 3 to 4... they are a 5 for me with the vanilla but that's personal preference!"
"0","4","These were very good. I overbaked the first batch then began to take them out of the oven the second I saw the edges brown."
"0","5","Awesome! I followed the recipe as is and add a tsp of vanilla. They turned out perfect!"
"0","3","Though they've got a nice flavor, these are on the Dry 'n' Crumbly side. Used Butter Flavor Crisco, Added a Tsp vanilla, cut the sugars a bit and put in some Reese's Pieces."
"0","2","Dry, and fell apart in the oven. 375 is too high, and 10 minutes is too long. Stick with the recipe on the Jif jar."
"0","5","it's awsome"
"0","5","lovely and peanut buttery good with kisses on top. changes: 1/2 cup more PB 1 tsp vanilla let it sit in the fridge for an 1 before cooking"
"0","4","Made these for my BF and they turned out the perfect consistency and crispiness level. I added 1/2t of Vanilla and next time I will increase the peanut butter a bit....."
"0","5","Good cookies!"
"0","4","i liked this recipe i used the suggested increases added 1 1/2 cup macadamias and doubled the cookie size making 30 cookies"
"0","4","Pretty good recipe. I did add 1/4 c. more recipe, and 1/4 c. more flour according to other reviews, but I felt like it could have used even more peanut butter. Maybe it's because I used smooth PB instead of the crunchy. I prefer a little more softer, chewy cookie."
"0","5","Great cookies! Didn't add or change a thing! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies are great...although I haven't had them plain yet, I always put a miniature peanut butter cup in the middle. They are awesome that way!"
"0","5","very good,have to be sure not to bake too long as then the cookie is very crispy. I made a double batch and then froze half the cookie dough so I can have some fresh cookies when unexpected company comes...and it makes the house smell good!"
"0","5","Totally fell in love with these cookies! I've made other PB cookies which were more... adult. not so sweet and a lot more delicate. these were perfect for kids. i didn't put any any baking powder in as i wanted them to stay low. i also kept them in the oven for 10 minutes; they came out perfectly crunchy. As a true marker of deliciousness--the kids LOVED them."
"0","5","I didn't have butter on hand so substituted 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup shortening. They came out so delicate and delicious that I will substitute this for the butter in the future. Awesome and delicious"
"0","5","EXCELLENT COOKIES! NEXT TIME I AM GOING TO HAVE TO THE BUTTER AT ROOM TEMPERATURE."
"0","5","Fabulous. The perfect Peanut Butter cookie. I followed another reviewers advice and added 1/2 a cup of both peanut butter and flour and they turned out great. I froze the leftovers and they are even yummy straight from the freezer."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! They are more on the crunchy side, so if you want a chewy cookie, you may want to look elsewhere. I made these cookies with creamy rather than chunky peanut butter because that's all I had on hand, but they still turned out great. I will definitely be making these again soon."
"0","4","I made a half batch, since I only had a half a cup of (creamy) peanut butter. Used light brown sugar for all the sugar. Chilled the hour, rolled in sugar and pressed with fork. Baked 10 minutes. The 1' balls yielded 47 cookies. Not as peanut-buttery as some I've had, but a really nice texture (not at all crumbly), and pretty to look at. All in all, a very good cookie."
"0","4","I love these cookies, but made a couple tweaks. In my oven, I have to bake them 8 min. at 350 degrees (I've done them in a convection oven for 8 mins at 375 before, though). I flatten my cookies, since I like them crisper. I also put in a bag of toffee bits and a tsp of vanilla. I'll try adding a 1/4 c more flour and a 1/4 c more peanut butter, as suggested by others, to see what that does. Great base recipe. Thanks."
"0","4","Very good. I used reduced fat peanut butter, but increased to 1/2 cup along with 1/2 cup more flour and added vanilla extract as well. I also rolled dough ball in sugar and barely criss-crossed so the cookies did not flatten out."
"0","4","The cookies were very good. But I made my own little variation. However, I did use 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the cookies turned out pretty salty. Since peanut butter isn't exactly sweet and baking soda tastes kinda salty anyway I wouldn't recommend using any salt at all."
"0","5","Not only did I add 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, I also added 1 2/3 cup of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips that gave it a Ultimate Peanut Butter Taste!!!"
"0","4","I used the Jiffy honey and peanut butter peanut butter instead of chunky. I reduced the flour to 2 c. and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I also took them out at 11 min....tasted GREAT! I also added peanut butter m&m's to the top of each and it was awesome!"
"0","5","This Recipe was wonderful! I made the cookies on the larger side and cooked them for 12 minutes. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of flour and 3/4 cup of peanut butter chips. This made the cookies extra soft and sweet. I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","These were the best Peanut Butter Cookies I've ever made. Even my husband, who doesn't like peanut butter, loved them!"
"0","5","I baked these cookies for my daughter's class and they turned out fabulous. I am not a peanut butter cookie fan, but these were absolutely delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","My husband loved these cookies."
"0","5","Very good. I added 1/2 cup pecan chips and it made it have alot more depth"
"0","4","this recipe worked very well. my daughter had a project on sunflowers so she used sunflower seed butter instead of peanut butter. the cookies tasted really good! her teacher even asked for the recipe lol:)"
"0","5","These were the best peanut butter cookies I've tasted. Very easy to make. I did add some chocolate chips to some of them and my husband and daughter like them best. But I preferred it just the way the recipe called for."
"0","5","These cookies are just the way we like them crunchy on the outside and chewy towards the middle. Great Receipe!!!!!!!!!"
"0","4","I halved the recipe and the yield was about 20 cookies. I followed recipe as is except for the addition of 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The cookies had a good flavour and a pretty good consistency - they get a little crumbly after a day or so."
"0","5","Great cookies. Kids at school love them!"
"0","4","Be careful not to overcook these puppies otherwise they get hard as rocks."
"0","5","These came out delicious!!! I skipped the refrigeration part because I was too impatient. Thus, the dough was too sticky to roll into balls with my hands. Instead, I got two spoons and spooned the dough back and forth to make a ball. I actually only cooked these for 8.5 minutes so that they wouldn't be too crispy. They came out perfect, and we ate them until we had stomach aches."
"0","4","This is a really great recipe, I too, made a few changes to it. I used 1/2 cup more peanut butter, creamy. I also used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar only 1/2 cup white sugar. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Instead of unsalted butter I used salted butter, therefore I did not use any salt...Very Good Cookies!!! Thanks!"
"0","4","These were excellent! Very peanut buttery and a good texture. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they fell apart a bit after they sat in my cookie jar. I will definitely make them again though!"
"0","4","good recipe w/some tweaking...I added 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp vanilla and used 1 & 1/2 cup butter and 2 tbs oil. The cookie came out perfect! I like it a little crunchier."
"0","5","I made these cookies and followed the recipe exactly without any changes, they came out perfectly!! I liked the use of Crunchy P.B. instead of Creamy. I also tried Joey's PB cookie recipe on here and I think the Classic PB Cookie recipe is slightly better. I will definately keep this recipe to make again."
"0","5","The time and effort put into these cookies is worth it. They came out so delicious. This was a simple recipe to follow."
"0","5","These are the best peanut butter cookies! I added peanut butter chips for extra flavor, but I didn't really need to. This recipe is very peanut buttery. I really like the texture, they melt in your mouth, and one day later they're still soft!"
"0","5","My friends couldn't believe I made them :)"
"0","4","I had a late night craving for sweets so I decided to give this recipe a try. I halved the recipe for all the ingredients except the peanut butter. I left it at 1 cup. And I added chocolate chips. I didn't have time to let the batter refrigerate for an hour so I just baked them immediately. They were exactly what I was craving!"
"0","4","The texture of these cookies turned out great. They were very pretty but just okay taste wise. I used margarine instead of butter but now I wish I would have just used butter. These were okay but they definitely needed more of a peanut butter flavor to satisfy me."
"0","5","Fab recipe! Everyone who has tried them loves them - I love that if you don't overdo them, they have that lovely chewy centre!"
"0","5","I brought these to work and everyone loved them! They were very moist and just yummy!! A great and simple recipe for peanut butter cookies! mmmmmm...."
"0","5","delicious cookies made them for a baby shower and not one was left!!"
"0","4","Pretty yummy! I planned on making this as other reviews suggested, with 1/4 C more peanut butter & flour, however, I just barely had enough peanut butter to fill the recipe as written and I think the consistency was just fine, no problems! I did add 1 t vanilla which I think was needed for taste and look forward to adding more peanut butter next time around."
"0","4","After reading the other reviews, I added another 1/2 cup flower and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I was going to add another 1/2 cup peanut butter, but didn't have enough. I cooked the cookies for 9 minutes as other reveiwers and they came out perfect. I brought some to work and they got great reviews. Next time I will try with more peanut butter though."
"0","5","Yum, Yum, Yummy. I have made peanut putter cookies only once before and was not overly pleased with them. I used the reviews and made them a bit chewier by adding a little more flour and a littler more peanut butter. Yum. I also added a little bit of dark chocolate in the center which always makes a cookie better. I would absolutely make this recipe again - thank you for posting!"
"0","4","Great peanut butter cookie recipe. They didn't make my toes curl, but I'll be making them again anyway."
"0","5","Delicious!!! After having read the reviews I decided to add a 1/4 cup more peanut butter & 1 tsp of vanilla. I baked them for only 9 min as my oven is gas w/ convection feature. These cookies were the perfect crunchy with a softer center. I love a crunchier cookie type so these were terrific. Will be saving these to my recipe box for sure. I will aslo add for those who nibble on batter while baking... beware once you start you cant stop!"
"0","4","Great cookies! i used creamy peanut butter and rolled cookies in sugar before baking. Will make again!"
"0","5","This recipe is nice cuz I like my cookies soft so I baked til barely browned and my son likes them crunchy so I baked til a little browner and both came out great."
"0","5","ummm umm umm.. these were delicious. mI used crisco insteaad of butter and they turned out perfect. I also added 1/4 more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter because my family luves peanut butter and it was wonderful.Ohh and a splash of vanilla.  I also did what mom would do when we were kids and let us roll the balls of dough into sugar and the flatten them down with a fork. Momories are wonderful.I found it better to flatten them down once was better than twice making the cross.Why? well because the thinner they got the more likely they were to fall apart. So they came out just the right size. B.T.W this recipe makes a lot of cookies. I think maybe like 4 - 5 dozen depending on the size of balls you roll.  Thanks again."
"0","5","This recipe was fantastic! I went looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe because I had a can of mixed nuts that my kids picked all the good nuts out of leaving the peanuts and the toe looking nuts. I blended them up and used them in place of the peanut butter. I usually end up throwing the left over peanuts away, so this was a great way to use the leftovers. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla. I followed a previous reviewer who said to cook them for 9 min. I also discovered that if they I don't have time to refrigerate them, I just don't flatten them out with a fork. They spread on their own. I have to say, these will be my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe!"
"0","5","I followed what some said about adding more peanut butter and flour (1/2 Cup each). My twist to this, mostly because I'm a health nut and have these ingredients laying around my house, is:  Adams Natural Peanut Butter I didn't have baking powder so I just omitted that Raw Sugar instead of granulated Smart Balance Spread Whole Wheat Flour And I rolled the cookies in the sugar before baking  They came out AMAZING. Very moist with a rich flavor from the raw sugar...I'll never bake with granulated again!"
"0","5","Good cookie recipe. I also added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. It didn't seem necessary to refrigerate the dough at all. I found the baking time to be about 8 minutes. Next time I make this recipe, however, I'm going to try it without the additional flour; I didn't think it was necessary."
"0","5","Mmm Mmm Delicious! And so easy too!"
"0","5","Yum! I just had to make some peanut butter cookies the other night, and this was the first one that popped up. I read some of the reviews quickly and made a few alterations. I don't really care for crunchy cookies, so I used creamy peanut butter and added about 1/4 more flour and peanut butter to the mix. We're going on day 3 here and the cookies are still soft and yummy. I think they could be a bit sweeter, but if everyone likes them the way they are then I don't need to add more sugar!!"
"0","5","These are fabulous and so easy to make. Thank you."
"0","5","My family loves these cookies. I use margarine instead of butter, 1/4 to 1/2 c. extra peanut butter and roll in granulated sugar before baking. I don't flatten with a fork, instead the kids help me put a hershey kiss in the middle when the cookies are slightly cooled. For the adults we leave without. they spread while baking, but stay light and puffy. Perfect."
"0","5","A wonderful classic! It's super easy to whip up! This would be a good one for kids to make too since the dough is easy to work with and it's hard to mess up. My variations: I used margarine and I had only 3/4 cup of creamy PB to work with, but it doesn't seem to have suffered much for it. Crunchy would be good as well, but don't be scared to go with creamy! I skipped the hr of refrigeration and it was still very easy to make the balls of dough. Watch the time though... I expect this will take less than 10 mins for many people! I had my oven set to 350* and made my cookies larger and they were perfect at 11 mins."
"0","4","This is a good basic recipe. I added 1/4-1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1tsp more vanilla. Makes plenty."
"0","5","Peanutbutter cookies are favorites at this house. During a recent move I lost some of my old family recipes, and this was as close as I could come to my grammy's cookies. She added 'Honey Roasted Peanut Butter' (sometimes 'chunky honey roasted peanut butter'), and Peanut Butter chips. OH MY!!! They have a way of disappearing at this house."
"0","5","really good, and I don't even like peanut butter cookies, but these cookies made me change my mind."
"0","2","These cookies are to thin and have very little flavor"
"0","5","These are GREAT! It's the cookie my family always asks me to make over any other. I increased the PB & flour like suggested in other posts. Really enjoyed them!!!"
"0","5","I made these for our super bowl party and they were a hit. I must say when I do make them again (and I will) I will add a little more P.B. But over all they were GREAT !"
"0","4","This cookies were really good and great right out of the oven. They didn't stay soft though later though the flavor was still delicious!"
"0","5","AWESOME COOKIES!  Must be my oven, but I had to bake them for 16 minutes at 375. They weren't quite done after 10. Nobody else seemed to have this problem though, so I'm thinking it's my old oven. ;)  A++++++++++!"
"0","5","I am not much of a baker and therefore should have obeyed the instructions. But, I didn't and kept the cookies in the oven for 14-15 minutes because, for me, they didnt look done after 10min. So, what I got was a batch of cookies w/ almost burnt bottoms. I am giving 5 starts b/c even w/ burnt downsides, the cookies were tasty. Just think how good they must be when done right!"
"0","5","Great recipe. Really yummy cookie! Used a half and half mix of whole wheat pastry flour and unbleached white all purpose. I followed the suggestions to add 1/2 c. more flour and 1/2 c. more PB (Smuckers Natural Smooth) and this made just over 3.5 dozen. I did forget the suggestion to add a little vanilla, dagnabbit! Oh, well...next time, because there will be a next time as these are so good!"
"0","4","My husband and I are peanut butter 'nuts' so I tried this recipe. I added extra peanut butter (which it definitely needed)and also added peanut butter chips. They tasted good but be careful not to add too much extra flour as mine were a tad dry. Next time I think I will follow the regular flour amount."
"0","4","this recipe is really fantastic and yeah i think that the extra flour really did help though because me and my family like the cookies a little chewier. oo thank you."
"0","4","I made these cookies for a church meeting and they were all gone! I did as others suggested though and added 1/2 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. The cookies were not overly peanut-buttery, so I can imagine that without the added 1/2 cup, they would have been bland for my tasting."
"0","4","These cookies are not too bad. Not the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had but still pretty good. I used 1 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of 1 cup. I like alot of peanut butter. I followed the rest of the recipe as given."
"0","5","THESE ARE SOME GOSH-DARN GREAT COOKIES!"
"0","4","Very good cookies...as suggested, I used a bit more flour. I froze the dough in balls on a cookie sheet then put them in a ziploc till I was ready to bake them fresh for Christmas. Came out terrific!"
"0","5","Fantastic Cookies. Added 1/4 Cup peanut butter because I like my cookies extra peanut-buttery. Must Chill for 1 hour or cookies will come out too flat :)"
"0","5","i just doubled the recipie and it worked just fine for me. my boyfriend and i loved them. we rolled then in sugar and did the traditional cris cross pattern.  these cookies are just wonderful!"
"0","5","I added a little more flour and these were PERFECT. Perfect texture - chewy and yummy."
"0","5","These tasted really good--even my picky husband who always raves about his mom's cookies loved them. Oh--you DON'T need to flatten them before baking--I did and they spread too much."
"0","3","Maybe I did something terribly wrong, but these were the WORST cookies ever, texture-wise. I creamed the peanut butter with 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. coconut oil (which is solid at room temperature like butter), and it was blending beautifully. Next, I added the eggs as instructed, and blammo - my beautiful, smooth, oily mixture turned into a clay-like mass, like some science experiment turned very wrong. Undaunted, I continued with the recipe, adding the flours then baking... unfortunately, what I ended up with were these really bad-looking, dry as sand, crumbly, disastrous cookies (which tasted good, but fell apart into a million pieces when you pick them up). I am giving this recipe 3 stars only because I didn't follow the instructions *exactly*, substituting coconut oil for butter. Maybe that's what messed it up."
"0","5","AWESOME. These cookies came out incredibly well and so yummy. I followed the reviewer's comments. I also added a 1/2 cup more flour and a 1/2 cup more peanut butter. It made the cookie not too thin, just a little bit chewier, not to mention soft and not too dry. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I tried this tonight and it was perfect. Very peanutty. I followed the same advice as others with the additional peanut butter and flour. Very soft cookies. I'll definitely keep this as one of my favorites."
"0","5","I like anything that has the words 'Peanut' and 'Butter' in it. So this works for me"
"0","4","I read several reviews, then I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of peanut butter ( diddn't have crunchy) I've never made peanut butter cookies before...the dough was really crumbly and I couldn't get it to roll into a ball...so I wet it a bit with water...then it was a goopy mess...so I did my best and rolled them and smooshed them flat...then I added M&M eye's and nose and pretzel ears to make a Rudolf cookie. I cooked them at 350 for about 10-12 minutes--I made big cookies!! I love the flavor...just wish the dough wasn't so stressful. I gave 4 stars because the flavor was great and I probably messed up the consistency of the dough. Will make again...but maybe only 1/4 cup more flour. Thanks!"
"0","4","This is a very good cookie. Since I had to make changes, I gave it a 4. I, too, increased the peanut butter and flour by 1/4 c each. Might increase by ½c. each next time to see how they turn out. I used creamy all natural peanut butter and added some chopped peanuts, but no added peanuts would've been good, too. Also, I increased the size of the ball of dough to 1½ in. and they baked better and were a size we like. I put sugar on the first 2 batches, but would rather have them spread a little, so didn't sugar the rest. That's just a matter of taste."
"0","5","I added extra flour and peanut butter. I rolled them in green and red sprinkles so they'd look perfect for the holiday. They turned out great!"
"0","5","I added extra peanut butter and flour as recommened by other reviewers. This recipe turned out great."
"0","5","I loved these cookies. I also did the 1/4 more flour and peanut butter and they came out great. I made one batch and they were gone with in an hour. I do have 2 sister a brother my parents and my grandpa in the house lol but they were also. I also rolled them in sugar and they came out even better! GREAT REIPE!"
"0","4","These turned out delicious! Thanks!"
"0","5","These were perfect! My husband and his co-workers raved about them. Thanks!"
"0","5","awesome cookies"
"0","5","This is a winner in my house. As suggested by other reviewers I added 1/2 cup of both flour and peantbutter and 1tbs of Vann. I did not use chuncky PB but they are still off the wall. I am still working on the right oven Temp and time but they is always different with ovens. Giving 5 stars even thou I had to add. the Flavor is just right!!!"
"0","4","Love them. The only reason I gave them four and not five is because you have to make the changes to make them great."
"0","4","I made with Splenda white sugar and Splenda brown suger. Followed recipe and baking time. Came out very nice. After first batch, reduced baking time by 1 minute. May add a little more peanut butter next time."
"0","5","These cookies are fabulous just the way they are. I have made three batches this week. My family loves them."
"0","4","Followed recommendations of other reviewers and added 1/2 c. flour and a tsp of vanilla. Didn't have chunky PB so I added a couple handfuls of roasted peanuts we had on hand. Fluffy cookies with peanuts....yummy! Well received by the family."
"0","5","These are really good, I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and flour. Yummy! They were all gone within a day! **Feb 2, 2009 I made these again and they are still yummy! I only added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and they came out a little flat. They are definitely a delicate cookie to bake cause if its to long it gets hard but they still come out tasting great. These will not last long in my house soft or crunchy! I didn't put them in the fridge this time so maybe that's why it came out a little flat. I used a tbsp to make the balls and I got over 70 cookies."
"0","5","I followed everyone else's recommendation for the extra flour and peanut butter. Fabulous recipe...will definitely share with others!"
"0","5","These were great. I did take the others advice and use 3 cups of flour. And added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also used Reduced Fat creamy peanut butter since it is the only kind I buy. Everyone loved them."
"0","2","not sweet enough"
"0","4","I made these last night and they turned out great! I also followed a few others and added an extra 1/2 cup of fluor and 1/2 cup of peanut butter, baked at 375 for 9 minutes."
"0","4","The cookies were really good, but lacked the 'peanut butter punch' I normally expect."
"0","5","Super!!!!"
"0","5","For the longest time I was trying to find a recipe that would show up my sister's peanut butter cookie recipe...I found it!"
"0","5","My whole family loved these cookies! And when I added chocolate chips they were perfect."
"0","4","These cookies turned out light and fluffy, but nothing distinguished this recipe from other peanut butter cookie recipes. In fact, this one calls for twice the sugar and butter of another recipe I have used, and both batches taste almost identical (and the portions of the other ingredients were of an equal ratio)."
"0","5","Exactly what a peanut butter cookie should be. What a classic. I made it exactly as the recipe said and they turned out perfect."
"0","5","These are fantastic!! I use natural chunky peanut butter (no sugar added), and it's got a nice combination of salty/sweet, just how I like it."
"0","4","pretty good!"
"0","5","Oh My Gosh! YUMM-O! I used almond butter in place of chunky peanut butter and I had such rave reviews I think I could make a million if I sold them. I did bake about 1 minute longer than indicated...but that could be my oven, too. Thank you!"
"0","5","Delicious! Will keep this one in my recipe box. These are crispy and chewy all at the same time. Yummy!"
"0","5","Delicious!!! We use a little extra peanut butter but the recipes is great besides that!"
"0","5","Perfect way to make peanut butter cookies! Thank you for sharing this."
"0","5","Easy to make and tastes just like the ones mom made when I was little! The husband loved them and has asked me to make them on many occassions."
"0","4","Good but too sweet for my likeing.. next time i would ommit the white sugar"
"0","4","Good but not great. I had a really hard time playing around with the oven trying to get the temperature right. 375 is definitely too hot. They are tastey but missing something. I agree with other reviews that they need more peanut butter. Next time I will definitely add sugar on top and use salted butter. They are very pretty, though, and hold their shape well."
"0","5","I really liked these and they were easy to make. Everyone enjoyed them and they were all gone by the next day (I made them the night before)."
"0","5","I live in Holland and I was searching for a realy good cookie recipe. I tried this recipe and it was very tasty. My family loved the cookies. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","I used this recipie, and added chocolate chips. They are so good!! I will be using this recipe again!"
"0","4","They were very good, not as soft as I thought they'd turn out, my husband loved them though, I found doing what they asked to do with the fork makes them very thin and hence they turn out a bit crispy. So I flattened the next batch with my fingers, they were a bit thicker and tastier. They tasted really light, I will make again."
"0","4","Great recipe overall. A couple minor things: I measured the salt to the exact amount and the cookies taste a bit salty (at least to me, but everyone who's eaten them have loved them), and secondly, I think they could use a bit more peanut butter flavor, next time I will add more. I used a size 30 scoop, baked for 8 minutes at 375 and they turned out perfect. They're nice and soft :o)"
"0","2","Hardly peanutty in flavor at all, and too dry for my taste, even though I only baked them for 8 minutes. Disappointing..."
"0","4","Lack of peanutty taste...I used 1/4 c. more PB(creamy) & wasn't enuff still. I didn't have time to wait(sweet tooth & it's late)to refig. for an hour, then roll into balls. They went straight to pan from spoon and flattened with a fork dipped in sugar. Bake 8 min.! unless u like crunchy.Would make again if absolutely had to. Afterall, it hit the sweet spot for me tonight! *After letting the cookies sit overnight, the flavor was much better & more PB taste came thru...upgrade to 4 1/2 stars."
"0","5","So good, thanks! Great with a BIG glass of milk."
"0","5","I made these with creamy peanut butter and they worked great. Just make sure you don't over cook them."
"0","5","My mom made these and my brothers and I all enjoyed them .They also taste great right from the freezer."
"0","5","This is exactly how my Momma makes them. I live 6,000 miles from her and now I can create them in my own kitchen. Thank you. :) I asked her for the recipe but she's the type that doesn't write them down."
"0","4","Very good cookie. Recipe makes more than 2 dozen. Mrs. Sigg's are slightly better."
"0","5","I thought these cookies were great. I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. Everyone really enjoyed them. Also, I didn't have time to bake the whole batch of cookies at one time and put the rest of the dough in the refrigerator. A week later and the cookies still came out great! I will make these again and again!"
"0","4","nice cookies with beautiful color and shape, but lacking in the peanut butter flavor. i'm searching for a recipe like the ones my mom used, and this just wasn't it. i refridgerated them overnight and woke up early to bake them. i like the texture though!"

"0","5","Best Peanut Butter Cookie I ever made. Was very surprised by the size of the cookie, much larger than I expected.  I now add 2 cups chocolate chips to the mixture. Superb !"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I even, uh, forgot to add the baking soda and they still turned out great! Actually, I think that helped me - I live at about 5000 feet so things tend to rise too fast and then dry out...but forgetting baking soda altogether isn't a typical high-altitude adjustment. Yumm...I think I'm going to wander into the kitchen and have another!"
