"1216","5","My son-in-law is diabetic, so I reduced the butter to 3/4 stick of butter melted with 1/2 cup of Splenda sugar blend, and used Diet Mountain Dew. Wonderful!"
"1151","5","**UPDATE 9.1.14** you absolutely MUST try these with fresh peaches in place of the apples, it's almost a religious experience!! ORIGINAL RATING: Oh my goodness, even after all the stellar reviews i was NOT expecting these to be as insanely yummy as they were! Halved the recipe as it was just for the hub and me and used a large gala apple, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, and added a teaspoon of vanilla after the sugars had melted. Poured over the little bundles of joy and then poured 1/2 can diet ginger ale over everything. We didn't have any vanilla ice cream but DID fortunately have whipped cream, holy moly we were in heaven and ate four of them between us!!! Amazingly easy and one of the best desserts I've ever made, this is definitely company worthy. Thank you thank you thank you for submitting this!!!"
"792","5","I made this tonight they are incredible. I halved the recipe and made one change. I used 3/4 cup sugar(1/2 cup white, 1/4 cup brown). Will be making this again and again."
"477","5","I've made these apple dumplings for years and have received nothing but wonderful comments. The secret with the melted butter and sugar is to continue cooking it until it is well blended and thickens, stirring constantly. Then stir in the cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla."
"416","5","This recipe was a huge hit at the last family gathering. Both my Mother and my Grandmother asked me for the recipe! After a few trials I've found that the key is to 1) coat the apples in cinnamon and sugar before wrapping 2) Use 2 parts white to 1 part brown sugar in the sauce. simmer until it makes a thick, rich caramel and pulls away from the side of the pot. then add 1 tsp. vanilla along with the cinnamon. With these tweaks the dumplings were not soggy at all as some reviewers had mentioned. Thanks for the great post!"
"375","5","This is great! Since this is super fattening, I made some changes & couldn't tell any difference. I used reduced fat crescent rolls, cut the sugar to 1/2c. & 1/2 c. splenda & used diet mountain dew. I cut back the butter to 1 stick + 2 tblsp. Does anyone know what the fat grams & calories would be with these changes?"
"246","5","This recipe reminds me of the apple dumplings my Southern Granny made, absolutely delicious! For those that say they are soggy, that is the way old fashioned dumplings tasted, soft and gooey and syrupy on the bottom and slightly crisp on the top. These were perfect! Everyone who has tried them has loved them and I live in the state of New York, not a southern state! I did try cutting the sugar back to 1 cup and that worked for me but everyone loved the original sweetness. Thank you so much, Lindy, for the 'diabetic' recipe, I used only 1/2 cup of butter with 1 cup of splenda and diet Mountain Dew and it was great, only 4 Weight Watcher points compared to the 7 for the revised original recipe (with only 1 cup of sugar). I made mine with Northern Spy apples which may account for the extra 'sweetness' to my dish but I would give this dish 10 stars if I could. Definitely a comfort dish and, as my sister says, there is not an easier dessert dish out there and it is pretty enough to take somewhere. Thanks again!"
"175","5","I found this recipe last year and made it for Thanksgiving dinner with my husband's family. Everyone raved about it and made me promise to make it at Christmas. I now make it for a quick and easy dessert for any occasion. Everyone asks for the recipe. I made a few changes to mine though. I use 3-4 large Granny Smith apples, and quarter them. This makes bigger dumplings and each person gets more of the tart apple taste. Before I put the sugar/cinnamon/butter mixture or the Mt. Dew on, I bake the dumplings for 10-12 minutes to avoid having soggy dough. Then, I pour or spoon the sugar mixture over the top and pour just 10 oz. of Mt. Dew around the dumplings, not over the top, and bake for another 25-28 minutes, or until done. They come out firm, not soggy, and wonderfully crunchy on top from the sugar. People can't stop eating them!"
"175","3","This was good but, the crescent rolls just tasted like preservative maximum. It did not taste fresh, like pie dough. So I made them with pre-made pie dough, cut the circle in 8 pieces(triangle) added 2 apple slices, sprinkled the tops with alot of cinnamon and brown sugar, followed everything else and, they were so much better.You could cut back on the sugar too. They were plenty sweet!"
"162","5","Original review Oct. 2, 2009: I've been making this recipe since I first learned when I was a kid. I always use brown sugar and I wisk in the cinnamon and a little nutmeg in with the brown sugar. This is really awesome with cinnamon ice cream or fresh whipped cream. GREAT white trash party offering. EDITED REVIEW: I made this the other day using reduced fat crescent roll, half the amount of butter, half the amount of brown sugar Splenda in place of the sugar and Diet Canada Dry. Even using the lower fat ingredients, this was still freaking awesome. I ate one portion, the boys literally ate the rest in 15 minutes. My husband even remarked that it's better than it usually is!"
"131","5","MY GRANDMOTHER GIVE ME THIS RECIPE A LONG TIME AGO AND IT IS THE BEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD.ITS EASY AND DELICIOUS. JUST REMENBER TO PEEL THE APPLES"
"90","5","Have made this many times, it is so easy to make and so delicious to eat. My husband says this is one of the best desserts I've ever made. If you are fond of apple pie you will just devour this. You can also halve this recipe (use a square pan)with excellent results, too."
"81","5","This is great stuff. Easy and delicious. I usually halve the recipie and use a little more apple than called for. Great with vanilla ice cream!"
"65","5","My family loves this easy treat! We make it once a week! I hope you all enjoy it as well!"
"57","5","Wow - Where's this little recipe been all my life? I mean a dessert just doesn't get any easier or any tastier than this! I've been meaning to try this recipe for a while now and have FINALLY got around to trying it...OMG it's so delicious! Definitely not for those counting calories! I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and generous tsp. of vanilla. Who knew Mountain Dew would ever be an ingredient in this? I guess it's not for me to question, just for me to enjoy! These baked up beautifully and made the house smell wonderful. They were perfect with vanilla ice cream and a dollup of whipped cream and the side -YUM! Thanks for a great recipe docswife, one I'll be sure to make again!"
"56","4","My grandmother left us with a very similar recipe that has become a staple at family gatherings, and imho is a great improvement on this one (not that it isn't good), plus it cuts down on the calories and fat a bit. Instead of a can of mountain dew she would always use 7-up. Also, there is no need to use a cup of butter and 1.5 cups of sugar (which makes it waaay to sweet for me). Just 1/2 cup of each melted together is plenty."
"48","5","I made these the other day and they were divine! I made a few changes: I used 2 tsp of cinnammon, 1 1/2 cups of butter, and Sprite instead of Mt. Dew. I think it's important to mention that these taste way better if you pour the soda to the sides of the dumplings, not directly on them. This allows the cinnammon mixture to form a nice crust on top of the dumplings, otherwise I think they might come out soggy. These are best served hot and with vanilla ice cream. Yum!!"
"40","5","This was a hit at Thanksgiving this year! The only dessert to completely sell out! Having made them once before and wishing they were a little less sweet and soggy, I made a couple of changes and they came out perfectly.  I used 1 stick of butter instead of 2 I used 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup brown sugar I added vanilla to the mix I heated the sugar/butter until it started to caramelize before adding it to the dumplings I poured the mountain dew around the dumplings instead of on top of them"
"35","5","Let me preface this review by saying I'm no fan of pre-fab ingredients. Between all the stellar reviews and the use of an unconventional ingredient (soda) I had to try it. But because I'm diabetic, that necessitated a few changes. However, I'm happy to report that even in a more streamlined incarnation, it was no less spectacular, and I'm glad I didn't let the inclusion of a dairy-case roll dough put me off. I rolled the apples in a mixture of Splenda, some cinnamon and a few shakes of nutmeg. The sauce was made with half the butter, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 1-1/4 cup Splenda, fortified with 1 Tb honey, 1 Tb rum, and several shakes of freshly grated nutmeg. The honey and rum lent a lovely complexity of flavor. I only had Fresca on hand (well, it was either that or Coke Zero!) It's no exaggeration to say that there's no way you could tell this was a 'light version.' Whereas it's debatable to say that since I didn't make it exactly as the recipe states I'm not rating the recipe, it shows how flexible this recipe is, and how easily tailored it is. Because of medical necessity, I have to change recipes often. Some can be be adapted, some can't. This one rolls with the proverbial punches, and emerges a champ, the mark of a great recipe that can assume a place of honor in your baking repertoire."
"34","2","I did not have problems with sogginess at all but the flavor wasn't the greatest. The apples were tasteless-really needed to be rolled in cinnamon sugar beforehand. The Mountain Dew leaves an aftertaste. Just not good. Sorry:("
"28","5","I was very pleased with how this turned out and my husband loved it! I read all the reviews and, with a few changes, this recipe is to die for! I used 1 can of Grand’s instead of 2 cans of crescents and separated them into 16 pieces. I only used ¾ cup of real butter (1 and ½ sticks), ¾ c. brown sugar and ¾ c. white sugar and let that simmer on low until it thickened up a bit. Then after I removed it from the heat, I stirred in the cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla and ¼ tsp. of nutmeg. I used Diet Mt. Dew but, only about half a can and I sprinkled cinnamon red hot candies on top. The dumplings really puffed up and filled a 9 x 13 pan and were not soggy after baking for 40 minutes. The red hot candies melted into red polka dots on top of the slightly crispy tops of the dumplings and the whole house smelled wonderful! This is definitely a keeper and next time I may try sprinkling pecans on top, too."
"23","5","A friend of mine made this and it was simply awsome! I made them and forgot to add the soda to the liquid. Still great tasting and beautiful, just not as juicy. Will add the soda next time. Would give 10 stars if I could!!"
"21","5","These will make you slap yo' momma! Best and easiest recipe for apple dumplings ever. I lost this recipe years ago,and i'm so glad i found it again! Thanks"
"18","5","I love these! They are so easy and so good. If you look up The Pioneer Woman Cooks she has step by step instructions with pictures. She has some really great recipes!"
"17","5","Excellent! This is one of my favorite recipes when we're expecting guests because it looks and tastes great for very little effort. The Pioneer Woman shows step by step photos! The only difference is that she adds 1 tsp of vanilla and only uses 1 small can of Mountain Dew. I use reduced fat crescent rolls (doesn't make it low fat in the slightest) and I layer them in 4 rows of 4 in a 9X13 pyrex dish. I prepare them before company arrives and bake them while we're eating. When they're done I sit them on the counter & cover them with foil and leave them for about 30-60 min which lets the syrupy goodess thicken. It's very impressive served with plain ol' vanilla ice cream. Sooooooo good!"
"15","5","Awesome! Would be great for a diner party dessert. So easy! Will 1/2 next time for just me and my husband. I think I could have used 1/2 the butter and substituted splenda for sugar. Used a diet Mt Dew."
"14","5","Five stars"
"14","5","These are SO GOOD but SO BAD for you. Although, they were SO WORTH IT! Update: I have made this several times. This recipe requests more cinnamon than the one I have used in the past, which I like. I melt butter in the microwave and just add the sugar and cinnamon and stir. You don't have to melt the sugar in the mixture before you pour, let your oven do that work. I have also made this with peaches."
"14","1","I followed the recipe to a T and these were terrible. After all the fantastic reviews I couldn't wait to make these for a family get together and I was so disappointed! They were soggy. I may try them again and simply roll the dough covered apples in a sugar/cinnamon mixture and bake them without all the goop poured over them. If that doesn't work, I'll pitch this recipe."
"13","5","Mmmmmm.......This recipe was so good! Went perfectly with vanilla bean ice cream with some of the sauce drizzled on it (see my pic). I made some minor tweaks based on some of the reviews I read. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on apple slices before wrapping in dough. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 sticks butter. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp vanilla extract after butter and sugar thickened. Poured 1/2 can of Mountain Dew around the sides of the dumplings. Baked for about 30-35 mins. It was perfect! Not soggy and not too sweet at all as some reviewers stated. Will definitely make again :o)"
"13","5","So delicious and super easy to make!! So yummy with vanilla ice cream!"
"13","5","the hardest part was cutting up the apples... mmm super good and easy! great substitute when i'm in need of an apple pie fix. definitely will be keeping this one around. i must admit i made one small substitution, but it was for reasons of cost savings - i used Shasta Mountain Rush instead of Mountain Dew (half the price for a 2-liter bottle)."
"13","5","I make these a lot, but we call them Apple-Dews!! If you think the apple version is yummy, try them with fresh peaches!! Oh my goodness....compares to a peach cobbler...our favorite!! If you don't like the sogginess, what I do is gently flip these over in the pan once the tops are golden brown. This keeps the bottom from being so soggy and it also gives the tops a chance to bath in the soda mixture!! Very, very yummy!!"
"12","5","I thought this was an excellent recipe! Was better than expected. It was very sweet but I didn't think it was too sweet..definatley is personal preference. I tossed the apples with cin/sugar prior to rolling them in the dough. Also, I used 1 C sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar..let the butter and sugars thicken and pour over top. Pour soda around the dumplings vs on top-all suggestions made by other's that I wouldn't change. All in all was an easy, ooey gooey wonderful dessert!"
"12","5","All I can say is wow are these good and I dont like baked apple anything. I made these for my father for Thanksgiving dinner. We loved these and they are super simple and fast. Your family will think you were fussing all day. I will make these over and over again. Served with vanilla ice cream. A must try you wont be sorry."
"12","5","my daughter annette made these for thanksgiving and they were deliciouse !! We really didnt think they could be so good with all the mountain dew at the end ,we dont even like that soda... although you cant taste it but it sure made a great dessert..everyone loved it!! Definetly will be making again!"
"12","5","This is awesome! I was skeptical of the soda on it but it worked. We don't drink Mountain Dew, so I used Sprite instead. We halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Really, really great!"
"11","5","Absolutely delicious! I followed others' recommendations, and rolled the apple slices in cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg before wrapping with crescent roll dough. I used 2 parts white sugar to 1 part brown sugar and cooked the sauce longer to make it caramelly. I also added nutmeg (in addition to the cinnamon) to the sauce. I took about 48 of these to an event at church, and literally had dozens of requests for the recipe. The house smelled great while baking, the kids enjoyed helping, and this will definitely be one of my go-to recipes for company!"
"11","5","AMAZING! Used cream soda cause that's waht I had on hand. Used less than 1/2 the sugar. Turned out GREAT! Even made these the night before guests came... coverd in fridge... pulled back out & warmed on 300 in oven for 20-30 minutes or so. AMAZING!"
"11","3","Made these a couple of weeks ago and really felt it was only fair to reserve judgement until I compared with some others. I found these way too sweet. I think the combination of the 1.5 cups sugar and a can of sweet soda is just overkill"
"10","5","Excellent! I love that I could feed the whole family dessert with just two apples! I did use 1 c white and 1/2 c brown sugars."
"10","5","I have been using allrecipes for years and this is the first recipe I've commented on-- it was that good! After reading the reviews I only changed a few things to make them SUPERB!! I used 4 apples (I didn't have Granny Smith so I used Jonagold) and I quartered them. This makes for bigger dumplings per person. After wrapping them in the crescent dough I baked them for 10-12 minutes to avoid them getting soggy. THEN I poured the cinnamon/sugar mixture over the tops of the dumplings and the Sprite around the dumplings, but not on top. I baked them an additional 25-28 minutes until golden brown. These were AMAZING! I don't like apple pie so I wanted to try something different and I'm so glad I did!! I will be making these often! Everyone I served had seconds and thirds!!"
"10","5","OMG these are the greatest ever. I did follow a couple of suggestions from others like I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, change the sugar to 1 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar, I poured the soda around instead of on top and I sprinkled some chopped pecans over half the pan. This is a staple for me I prefer these over apple pie I am not a big fan of apple pie and neither is the BF but he really liked these...YAY. Thanks for sharing will be making when I be asked to bring a dessert this is it...Thanks again"
"10","4","Wow, these were great. I used less butter/sugar than called for and ginger ale as I had that on hand. Amazingly easy and really tasted great served with ice cream!"
"9","5","Made this last night and I just LOVED the buttery flavour, and could not stop eating - I had seconds for desert which I never do, but these Apple dumplings are heavenly . The only thing I would change next time I make these, is use 1/3 less sugar. Also I used 7up as I had no Mountain Dew. Who would have thought of pouring a can of soda over anything before baking? but it works beatifully. Thanks so much for posting this amazingliy easy recipe."
"9","5","Yum! Tasted like apple cinnamon rolls. I reduced the butter and sugar by half and used sparkling apple cider instead of Mt Doodoo. I dredged the apple slices in cinnamon before wrapping them in dough. Thanks for the delicious treat!"
"9","5","Oh my goodness - these are Amazing! Easy to make, not many ingredients, but oh the taste!!!! Changes: I only used one stick of butter, increased the cinnamon, used 3/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. white sugar. Try them, you'll like them!"
"9","5","Ok.. I'm not gonna lie...the Mountain Dew definitely piqued my interest, and was the main reason behind attempting this recipe. Boy am I glad that I did!!! If I could give this 10 stars I would! Oh my gosh, I was definitely not expecting these to be THIS GOOD. This recipe was incredibly easy and people thought that they were 'bakery' or 'restaurant' quality. Actually, it's my sister's 'new favorite dessert' lol. I halved the recipe, used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown, added 1 tsp. vanilla and and a pinch of nutmeg. I also cut down the baking time a little bit because I halved the recipe..I kind of just eye-balled them after 25 minutes and made sure they didn't burn. :~)"
"9","5","I LOVE this recipe! It turned out awesome. I followed the recipe as written for the most part. I continued to cook the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture on the stove until the sugar was melted. As written, is seemed as though you just melted the butter and then added the sugar and cinnamon. Nothing was stated about making sure the sugar was completely melted, but I went ahead and cooked it on top of the stove for about 3 minutes. I probably used only 4 ounces of Mountain Dew since I was halving the recipe and wanted to make sure they didn't turn out too soupy. I also just poured the Mountain Dew around the dumplings, not directly on top of them. The sugar and cinnamon mixture stayed on top of the dumplings and mixed with the Mountain Dew on the bottom of the baking dish to make a wonderful, thick sauce that was awesome! I served them warm and spooned some of the sauce on top of each. I absolutely love how simple and delicious this recipe is and you could easily do peaches or berries for a change if you like. It reminded me of a cobbler without the doughy-ness. It is now my new favorite recipe!"
"8","3","With my changes, I rate this 5-stars. I do NOT like crescent rolls, so I used Pillsbury ROLLED PIE CRUST instead (cut into eighths and rolled around 3 apple wedges). I usually use both Red and Green Golden Delicious apples. After peeling and cutting into wedges, I pour bottled lemon juice over the apples; fresh lemon juice can be used. I use 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, reduce the amount of butter by 1/2, and add a 1/2 teaspoon or so of good vanilla to the butter when melting it. I used GINGERALE instead of MD. I also add pecans or walnuts. This is one of my family's FAVORITE desserts. It is quick, but so very delicious - w/ changes. WONDERFUL!!!! I realize this is a whole new recipe, but I have to give credit to the original recipe from which I worked."
"8","5","Tried this recipe out on my Tuesday night guinea pigs and we all thought it was terrific. I looked at someone's picture (used a 13 x 9 plan and placed 6 on each side of the pan and put four vertically down the center). I made sure the tops were brown and were crispy on the top. Then we put two in each bowl, topped with some syrup and then added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. DELICIOUS!"
"8","5","So easy and so good! Made a 1/2 batch and came out great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
"8","5","The only change that I made was, I rolled the apples in a combination of suger and cinnamon before sealing them in the croissants. They are requested at all family functions! In the South, we make home made vanilla ice cream to go with them."
"8","1","I did the recipe just like it said, and it turned out horrible, extremely gooey on the bottom and not cooked, I wasted time and money making this. I will never make it again."
"7","5","Absolutely wonderful! I did change the sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. The trick to this recipe to keep it from sogging too much is to melt the butter then mix in the sugars...cook the butter and sugar mixture until its almost a paste...about 5 minute constantly stirring. Then add the cinnamon. I also baked for about 5-7 minutes longer to insure not too much sogginess. Absolutely wonderful!"
"7","5","These are amazing!! I didn't change much, but here is what I did change. First I halfed the recipe. Then when I went to get my Crescent Roll dough, I found one that said 'Big and Flaky' so I thought I'd try those. I used two apples, cut into quarters and they fit into the larger dough just fine! Since we don't drink Mountain Dew, I used what I had, most of a small can of Sprite. Lastly I sprinkled Demerara Sugar over the top after I finished the dish and right before I popped them into the oven. My hubby says these are the BEST Apple Dumplings he's ever had and so easy!! Thank you Docswife, great recipe."
"7","5","This is such a simple dessert that comes out so good! I do agree that it definitely needs more than 2 apples to the full recipe. The full recipe makes a lot, so halving it makes plenty for us. I make sure to cut the apple chunks pretty large to put in the crescent dough. I also roll the apples in cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle the rest over top of the dumplings after they are rolled up. When I make the sugar/butter sauce I spoon it over top of the dumplings and then drizzle the mountain dew in between. Using sprite, 7up, sierra mist, etc. would be fine to replace the mountain dew with. These are great by themselves or even better beside some vanilla ice cream! Such a great fast dessert to whip up at the last minute! Thanks for the recipe!"
"7","5","I have made this several times now just as written....my husband and boys love it.....Today I tried the advice to add vanilla and to cook the butter and sugar longer until thickened. I have to say with the mixture thicker it covered much more evenly and easily. Thanks love this recipe"
"7","4","We liked this a lot. Next time I'm going to use less butter and sugar though. I think using half a cup of butter is plenty. Also I only used 1 1/3 cup of sugar and this was still too much for us. I'm going to try 3/4 cup sugar with s stick of butter next time. I also never measure my cinnamon because you can never have too much with anything sugary."
"7","5","This is so easy I couldn't believe it! I took it to a family gathering and it was the first dessert gone! I used 1 cup brown sugar and only 1/2 cup white sugar as well as only 3/4 cup of butter... and I put a little of the sugar/butter mixture inside of the dumpling with the apple. YUM! This was a HIT, yay!"
"7","5","Hello my name is C.J. and i think this was a pretty good dessert. What i liked about this recipe was the Cinnamon flavor it had, it wasn't over powering or not enough you can barley taste it. I also liked that it was moist, soft, and fluffy and not dry. I cant think of something that i didn't like about the dish. I like my mom to make it again. :]"
"7","1","At first I thought I did something wrong because I only read the good reviews and based on the overall rating thought it would be great. Way too much butter and sugar and the Mountain Dew made it taste processed. It came out very gooey on the bottom and just tasted 'off'. It sounded weird but I was willing to try. I was glad though about the idea to use the crescent rolls with the apples and I will make my own recipe from that. I would not have thought to do that so thanks for that idea."
"7","5","My family went bonkers over this recipe! I don't care much for apple pie, myself, but this recipe is one I could eat just about every day. One of the THE best recipes I have tried!"
"6","5","This was surprisingly delicious!!Next time, I'm trying the 'lower' cal version, simply for the sake of my diet, otherwise the only change I made was add vanilla to sauce.. this is a keeper"
"6","1","Sorry to say, but we really didn't care for this recipe. The crescent rolls just seemed to add too much of a savory touch, and the flavors just didn't work together. I love apple dumplings but will stick to the homemade pastry and regular syrup. Thanks for the idea to try though."
"6","5","WOW!!!  I must confess I cheated on this a little bit...I had a jar of apple pie filling that I needed to use up. I rolled it up loosely in the dough and then I halved all of the other ingredients except the cinnamon since the pie filling was already sweet. I did not have mountain dew so I used 7 up instead. These were still awesome, everyone loved them...we will definitely make them again. YUM!"
"6","5","OH SO GOOD! I discovered a few tips: I used part brown sugar and found that it was best with dark brown sugar, and I used generic 7-up so that I didn't have the caffinee of Mountain Dew. Also, I rolled the apples in a little cinnamon & sugar before wrapping them. Although still tasty, it wasn't as good with light brown sugar & Fresca."
"6","4","This tasted great and was super easy to make. Dont worry if you can't 'seal up the apples in the dough completely, it'll still turn out great. We doubled the cinnamon. I was worries about the amount of liquid in the pan, but it turned out great. Would be great to take to a pot luck, and even re-heats well."
"6","4","I am rating the recipe as-is at 4 stars. My changes, which I prefer as some have mentioned: cut down sugar to 1 cup and split 1/2 white; 1/2 brown, I double the apples and crescent rolls (cutting triangles in 1/2 and using 1/2 for each apple slice), toss apple slices in a bit of cinnamon prior to rolling up, and cut down butter to 3/4 cup. I cook mine for about 10 mins prior to adding the soda (of which I use ginger ale since this is what we have at home) and use a jelly roll size pan. It is a very good dessert - a nice change for apple pie - and I will be making it this weekend for a friend's birthday party. Thank you!"
"6","1","I do not know why anyone would give this a 5 star rating. My friend made this for my family raving about how good it was. The flavor was unnatural and was overpoweringly rich."
"6","5","A little too sweet, cut down on sugar. Sub brown sugar. Friends asked for recipe!"
"6","5","I still can't believe how easy and how absolutely delish this dish is!!!!"
"6","5","Easy to make and the taste is so good!!! Real crowd pleaser, just add some ice cream and wait for the rave comments to begin."
"6","5","Very good....but very sweet! Next time I would definately cut down the butter to 3/4 C. and the sugar to 1 C."
"6","5","mistakenly bought garlic crescents & had to use grands biscuits instead .....I separated each biscuit & sealed the apples inside . Then I discovered I was out of cinnamon , so used a couple pinches of pumpkin pie spice . so it was 1 can Grands biscuits , 1 stick margarine , 1/4 cup each of brown & white sugars,probably 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice & 6 oz. Diet Mt. Dew , everything wrong but with AMAZING results !"
"6","5","Easy! I would never had tried this recipe due the Mt Dew plus the amount of sugar but the reviews made me! Glad I did! I used one stick of butter (plenty) and 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar (perfect sweetness) with Diet Mt Dew. The whole family loved these! Going into the oven there is ALOT of liquid---don't worry, coming out it has just a small amount of syrup in the bottom of the pan. Nice easy, quick apple dessert---thank you!!!"
"6","3","These were okay, but there's no way I'd ever call them the best dessert I've ever had. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and poured the Mt. Dew around the edges, then top with butter/sugar mixture. My dumplings browned nicely on top, but were soggy on the bottom - I'd cut the Mt. Dew in half if I were to make these again, but I won't be making them again - I prefer to get my calories from a better dessert."
"6","5","Made 1 1/2 recipes of this in a larger dish & it was GREAT. I added 1 Tbl of cinnamon to it - everything else was the same. AWESOME. Also - if you have the time, I think the 'sauce' stands up better if they're baked the night before, put in the fridge & then reheated (300 degrees for 30 minutes or so) the next morning. The sauce has time to soak up into the dumplings & it's HEAVEN. Also - I poured the Mtn Dew in FIRST and then put the cinnamon mixture over it. That left as much ooey gooey topping up there as possible - YUM."
"6","2","It tasted very processed and much like Mountain Dew and refrigerator biscuits, soggy and unnatural."
"5","4","Family liked this and it was quick and easy. Very very sweet even after cutting down the sugar. Edits: -1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown.(Still very sweet) -3/4 cup butter -1 t vanilla -soda around dumplings not over. -rolled apples in cinnamon sugar but will omit this next time. Definatly not needed.  Plan to squeeze a little lemon juice over apples wedges next time to enhance the tart flavor of the apples."
"5","5","After stumbling upon this recipe today, and reading over half of the comments. I decided to try this dish. Boy am I happy I did, this is truly an awesome dish. Did not follow the recipe exactly due to a lot of the comments. I used 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar. Instead of mountain dew, I used 8 ozs of 7 up, I may use the full 12 ozs next time. Not sure where the other reviewers went wrong with the dish being too soupy. Also,instead of using cinnamon, I used Apple pie spice, and some vanilla. This is truly a simple and delicious dish!! Try it you won't regret it."
"5","5","This is excellent, however I thought before I started there didn't seem to be enough apple (which I love) so I cored & split each apple in 4 pieces. I made half the recipe so I needed the 2 large apple. I also rolled the cresent out a little and it worked beautiful. Next time I will cut a litter butter and sugar and add some raisins. I think you can cheat a little and they will still be fabulous. I will make this many more times..... Thanks for this one."
"5","5","So delicious I made to take to work ...the first batch didn't make it because I ate them. very easy recipe and great flavor"
"5","5","What an unbelievable surprise! So easy...so delicious. My 86 year old father said these were the best he's apple dumplings he's ever had. I'm making them again this week for church pot luck!"
"5","5","OMG!! SO YUMMY!! I followed some of the suggestions decreased the butter to half a cup, the sugar to 1/2 cup of white and 1/4 of brown sugar, and only used 8 oz of mountain dew. I also added vanilla to the butter mixture. So good, will be making again and again!"
"5","4","This was so easy to make and it was really good. I too used half the butter and sugar and that was plenty. Will make again!"
"5","4","i've never made apple dumplings before but had some extra crescent dough so i decided to try them. I did 2 batches because pouring soda over them sounded strange. I did half with diet sprite (what i had) and half with no liquid. They were both very good but the ones without soda were much better. Also i cut way back on the butter and sugar. I used just enough to brush and sprinkle all the dumplings (~ 3T butter and 1/2 C sugar). They were definitely buttery and sweet enough and way less guilt!"
"5","5","Oh my!! This is some good stuff. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar. I think next time I will descrease this as this is really sweet. I also added a dash of vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture. Tossed my apples with sugar/cinnamon before wrapping. Quick to put together and couldn't wait to taste it out of the oven. These are delicious! I will be making these this fall with apples from my trees. I think you could also make this with layering dough on the bottom of the pan, apple slices and another layer of dough on the top for an even quicker way of putting it together."
"5","5","my picky boyfriend called this the 'best dessert he had ever had... ever' Except be CAREFUL the mountain dew can make a MESS of your oven... put the dish on top of foil!!"
"5","5","THESE WERE AWESOME. SO EASY AND DELICIOUS!! I CHANGED THE RECIPE BY USING HALF WHITE AND HALF BROWN SUGAR, A LITTLE LESS BUTTER AND ABOUT 6OZ OF SUNDROP B/C I DIDN'T HAVE MT. DEW. SERVED WARM WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM. MY BOYFRIEND THIS MAY BE HIS NEW FAVORITE DESSERT!"
"5","5","This is now my go to dessert. Used 3/4 splenda, 3/4 splenda brown sugar, 3/4 butter and diet mt dew. I fell in love with it."
"5","1","not good"
"5","5","Taste great with ice cream! Its a sweet and easy desert. I might cut back on the sugar next time though, its pretty sweet."
"5","5","If I could give these more than 5 stars, I sure would!! I have always shied away from making apple dumplings because I don't have much experience with pastry dough. I made these to take to a potluck dinner at my church and the pan was cleaned out! I had to make another batch the next day for my family because they complained that they didn't get enough of them at the dinner, lol!! I thank you, docswife, from the bottom of my heart for sharing this wonderful, easy recipe!!"
"5","5","I have been making this recipe for the past year and a half; even given the recipe to friends! The only changes I have made are adding more cinamon (about 1 1/2 Tbsp.), 3/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar, and 1 can Ginger Ale. Everyone loves these little gems and what a wonderful quick dessert to put together. I do stretch the crescent rolls alittle to make sure they fully cover the apple wedges."
"5","5","Something this easy shouldn't taste this wonderful, but it does. I thought this would be an easy recipe for my kids to do as they learn their way around the kitchen. (and it was-went together in a short amount of time too) I never expected such buttery, golden, sweet, goodness, to come out of my oven with so few ingredients, but we were all IMPRESSED. Easy, satisfying, comforting, delicious, and a stellar recipe."
"5","1","Based on the previous reviews and ratings, I thought this was going to be the very best. But deep down, I knew the recipe just didn't sound right. I made this recipe exactly as written. I was right...this is too good to be true. There is way too much dough wrapped around the small amount of apple. And, the citrus flavor of the soda is overwhelming. And, it's expensive and so not worth it. I'll stick with the old fashioned method."
"5","5","These are really great! Topping them with vanilla ice cream is a must. Whatever you do please do not use less mountain dew. The combination of the pop and the sugar/butter mixture creates a similar sauce that you would find on the inside of an apple pie. (Don't worry - it will thicken). You must spoon this mixture on top of your ice cream. I then top my ice cream with pecans. Crazy tasty!"
"5","5","Followed the directions exactly (well, I halved it) and it was AMAZING! Enough said! (Oh and yes, you must use Mountain Dew and not Sprite or anything else like that)."
"5","5","So, I was very skeptical about this recipe...I mean a whole can of mountain dew? This would surely make it 'soggy' like other reviewers have found. So instead, I used only about a quarter of the can. Enough to get bottom of the pan covered in MD. Then about 10-15 minutes after baking the dumplings, I removed the MD from the pan and continued to let it bake for another 10 min. Overall, this was VERY yummy with some vanilla ice cream on the side! I heard by brother yell, 'OH MY GOD!' after he had one bite!"
"5","5","Excellent receipe - try frozen peaches instead of apples and use nutmeg instead of cinnamon"
"5","5","These are awesome! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar..so tasty and soo simple!!"
"5","5","I use this recipe ALL the time. I always spent hours in the kitchen making apple dumplings now it is just a matter of minutes. Hubby loves them and I can't get enough. Recipe is perfect as it is but I do add about 1 cup of pecans on top just because I love them and add them to almost everythying!!"
"5","5","Ohmygosh! I made these yesterday & they are heavenly! I also did as one of the other reviewers suggested & poured the Mt Dew around the dumplings, butter/sugar mixture over top. I also used a mixture of half brown, half white sugar & added 2 tsp of pure vanilla. Who knew....me non-soda drinker would LOVE something so much made with Mt Dew!"
"5","5","I made these for my family for Thanksgiving and received compliments all around! Served with ice cream, these dumplings make a great dessert for any occasion. They are, of course, best right out of the oven; to prevent sogginess, I poured the excess liquid off after they had cooled a bit. I've also used half the butter and sugar on subsequent recipes and they taste just as good. Adding a tablespoon of brown sugar also seemed an improvement. Easy, tasty, a crowd pleaser!"
"5","5","I made these for a Labor Day potluck/cook-off and they were a hit! Everyone loved them so much it won. :) They're great served warm with vanilla ice cream like another reviewer had mentioned before. So good!"
"5","5","This was great! I halved the recipe and everything turned out fine. Next time I'll cut down on the butter (1/3 C for half batch) and reduce sugar to 1/2 C (for half batch). I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. This was great and so easy."
"5","5","The whole family loved this recipe..quick, easy,and oh so good!"
"4","4","IMPORTANT TIPS! I just made this tonight and let me tell you it is VERY liquidy. I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, and I would absolutely recommend using a bigger baking dish, even better if you have a TALL 9x13, I promise this will save your life! The liquid boiled over the sides and dripped into my oven causing smoke everywhere, and there was a lot of liquid left at the end. Please look at my picture to see. But don't let this steer you away, they taste really good. But a high baking dish is KEY. I took half the dumplings out of my pan and left half in so you can see."
"4","5","Omg.. I usually don't write reviews on recipes... but this one is worth writing about it deserves it. I have made this dessert 3 times in less than 2 weeks. EVERYBODY HAS LOVED IT!! I did make some tweaks, recommended by a different reviewer and this just came out tasting amazing every time. This recipe has now become one of my favorites and I will use for years to come. Try it its worth it!!!! tweaks I did were to coat the apples in a mixture of sugar and cinnamon before wrapping in dough, in the sauce I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added a tsp of vanilla extract. OMG ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!"
"4","2","Followed the recipe exactly. I found it weird why the recipe called for soaking the crescents in the sauce while baking b/c I knew it would end up soggy, but I decided to follow the recipe exactly. Not surprisingly, it was nasty semi-cooked dough on the bottom and tasty and flakey on top.   So... I would recommend skipping the sauce on the bottom and just drizzling it on top after the crescent had already been baked."
"4","5","We loved this recipe. Next time I'll try using Splenda . No one needs that much sugar. It's addictive recipe."
"4","5","I would have to say this recipe was AWESOME!!!! My family loves these and they have become one of our main desserts. I have done some extras on this recipe and it made it even better, After putting the apples inside the crescent rolls I then rolled them in cinnamon and sugar and instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar I put 2 cups of sugar and then I added vanilla to the sugar and butter mixture after it was done boiling, trust me it just made this recipe so much better of course not saying it wasnt already good, I then whipped up some heavy whipping cream and put that on top after they was done baking, so much better then cool whip!!"
"4","3","So, it seems like this might be good, but nothing worked for me on this one. The sugar did not melt, there was wayyyy too much butter, and the dough browned but remained doughy. There needed to be more apple in each dumpling to make it yummy, and not just a butter/sugar soaked doughball and there was nowhere near enough cinnamon for flavor. I was sad it didn't come out well, and since there are nearly 2000 positive reviews, though I followed the recipe, it just didn't work for me, and a huge waste of 2 sticks of butter (!). Bummer!"
"4","4","Made this yesterday for an impromptu playdate. I halved it in an 8x8 pan and used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew, and followed the rest of the directions to the letter. I stirred the sugar into the butter until it was mostly dissolved. They were beautiful, and tasty. In fact, they got better the longer they sat. The only thing that stops me from a 5-star rating is that the crescent rolls really do have that distinctive taste. And I think I would enjoy them more with my own pastry dough. Still, it would be very handy to have these on a camping trip. Few ingredients and kid friendly. :)"
"4","5","Tried this recipe for the first time, it was so easy to make! I consider myself a pretty good cook/baker - but this dessert was the best I've ever made. I pretty much followed the recipe - but did coat the apples in sugar/cinnamin prior to wrapping them. I used 1/2 cup of white suger and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added vanilla and nutmeg to it after hot. I used about 4 or 5 oz of mountain dew (pour on the side as others suggested - not on top). I cooked it about 10 minutes longer than it called for (I didn't want it to be soggy) and then last couple minutes in oven I did broil to finish browing the top. It does look like a lot of liquid before you bake it, but once finished it is a perfect consistancy. Everyone had seconds!"
"4","5","These WERE delicious... great crispy outer shell, warm, delicious center... but I just can't make them more than once a year due to the MOUNTAIN DEW. I really wish there was a substitute ingredient(s). But, for a special treat.... absolutely GREAT!!"
"4","5","This is AMAZING! I didn't have soda on hand, so I nixed that and used a mixture of Apple Juice and Lemon Juice. It was still beautiful! Would like to try it with soda next time to see how it tastes. The only bad thing about this dish is that it has wayy too many calories for something so addictive."
"4","5","My husband said this is by far one of the best desserts he has ever had."
"4","5","Excellent!! Read others reviews but tried it as is first. Next time would reduce the amount of sugar & butter by about 1/2. Definitely cook dumplings in oven 10-12 min. Like other recommended to prevent sogginess. Did use Mountain Dew but will try Gingerale next time."
"4","5","Being a diabetic, I substituted Splenda or Equal for sugar and used diet mountain dew... not one person noticed the difference. Anyone who has tasted this wonderful recipe has come back for more or asked for the recipe. I learned to keep the rolls cold until I was ready to use them. I also rolled the apple wedges in Splenda and cinnamon before I rolled it in the crescent rolls as it adds to flavor. thanks so much for posting this!"
"4","5","This is amazing. I screwed up, but it was totally me, not he recipe's fault. Thinking I was more clever than the average bear, I wanted more apple, so I cut them larger, expecting to need to bake it just a tad longer ... wroooong! So, I recommend not messing with it. (Though my curious brain can't help wondering how peaches might taste done this way. Thanks for sharing this really good and quick recipe.)"
"4","2","I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with half golden, crispy dumplings, half soggy and swimming in goo. I much preferred the non-drowned half and wonder what the point of the mountain dew is."
"4","5","The absolute, most delicious apple dumplings in existence! The mountain dew had me worried but apparently it's genius because it creates the most amazing dessert! I have made these dozens of times :) You won't be disappointed!"
"4","5","Made a 1/2 batch since it was just for the boyfriend and I, and baked in the giant sized muffin pan with each dumpling individual since some of the pictures looked like they got stuck together. Otherwise did everything else the same. Both changes were excellent, since baked individually they had a nice round shape (the featured photo must have been done that way). Served warm (half hour cool time) with whipped cream. Tastes like the baby of french toast, a cinnamon roll, and apple pie. So yummy!"
"4","5","I took other reviewers suggestions, as I was only making 1/2 the recipe I used 1 Granny Smith apple, after peeled and cored I put it in a plastic baggie and coated with cinammon sugar. I used brown and white sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla after the sauce was done. I poured the mountain dew in the pan instead of on top and my dumplings were very crispy on top. My husband absolutely loved these and said they were better than apple desserts in restaurants! Very easy to make and delicious, thanks for the recipe!"
"4","5","OMG I couldn't believe how easy and fantastic they turned out. My only deviation was I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the inside of the dough with apple as well. The Mountain Dew threw me especially when I poured it in. I thought there was no way all the liquid would soak up but it did and what was left was just yummy apple sauce to drizzle over dumplings when being served. Absolute winner !!!"
"4","5","Absolutely the most delicious apple dumpling I have ever eaten. I made the first batch exactly the way it was written and it was amazing, however the next batch I left out 1/2 cup of white sugar and replaced with 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, WOW AHHHMAZING! Highly recommend the brown sugar and maybe a 1/2 tsp extra of Cinnamon. Mmmm mmm!"
"4","5","The secret with the melted butter and sugar is to continue cooking it until it is well blended and thickens"
"4","5","Delicious! Used diet mountain dew and for the sugar used half regular sugar and half splenda."
"4","5","This is great! The only thing I change was I did half white sugar and half brown sugar. Next time I make these, I'll peel the skin frothe apples and maybe dice them a bit. DELICIOUS!"
"4","5","Ok, I was not sure if these would be good but I thought I would go ahead and give them a try. They are so good, the only change I made was I used 8 oz of light apple juice instead of mountain dew. We don't drink soda, the apple juice was a great substitute. When I make them again I am going to cut the sugar down to 1 cup, this recipe is a keeper."
"4","5","Oh my goodness!! This is sooo good!! I served with vanilla ice cream and it was wonderful!! Thanks for sharing."
"4","5","FANTASTC! Used Splenda Half & Half and Diet Mt Dew... cut the butter down to one stick... I have made it three times and it is a family favorite now!"
"4","5","O...M...G...I could not believe how amazing these were! I made this exactly as recipe was written and it was awesome. I will admit, at first, I was skeptical, but I tried it because everyone was raving about them. It was my first time making dumplings, and too me, after I added everything together, it looked like a big gloppy mess. So I crossed my fingers, as I made this Thanksgiving day with no test run, and put it in the oven. It looked and smelled fantastic when it came out, but the best part was the first bite. I was floored. So moist and delish, the apple inside was not mushy or chewy, but soft like butter. It was everyone's favorite dish at our Thanksgiving dinner this year, and several people begged for the recipe. Will definitely be going into my permanent recipe file of family favorites. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!"
"4","5","SOOOO Good! I even enjoyed the cold leftovers...like eating apple pie!"
"4","5","Oh my goodness, this is out of this world! I can't believe how delicious this is and how quick and easy it is to make! I made half a recipe using reduced fat crescent rolls, real butter, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and diet lemon lime soda. It is fantastic! I don't want to know how many calories there are in it because I am going to eat another one later, I don't care. You must try this. You won't be disappointed. Very company worthy and they look beautiful."
"4","5","I'll quote my boyfriend on this one and let you know exactly what his responce was to this recipe ... 'BAAANNNGGIINNN!'"
"4","5","I've made these 3 times now and they keep getting better! The only thing I changed was I spread butter on the crescent rolls and then place brown sugar on top of the butter, then add the apple slice. It seems to decrease the crescent roll flavor. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!"
"4","5","very simple and very good"
"4","5","You would never know that Mountain Dew is in these! We used half the sugar (and that was plenty sweet...almost too sweet!) and a little less Mountain Dew. We've made these a couple of times. Delicious!"
"4","5","Very yummy!!! Super simple! LOVE this recipe!! Thanks for sharing!!!!"
"4","3","Very easy and tasty excepting for too, too much sugar and butter. Next time I will decrease the sugar and butter by half."
"4","5","VERY yummy!!!! I followed the recipe exactly."
"4","5","We made these for dessert the other night and they were amazingly delicious. Fairly easy to put together and were a hit with everyone. Great Served with ice cream. These are my family's new version of apple pie!"
"4","5","Perfect as written. No changes."
"4","5","This is amazing! So easy, so delicious, and what a conversation piece at potlucks! The only change I made was to make this with 4 apples, using a quarter for each piece of dough. Leftovers (if you have any!) reheat well in the microwave. Thanks for the submission--it's one of my favorites!"
"4","5","I did as many suggested and cut the butter & sugar in half. (1/2 C butter, 1/2C white sugar & 1/4C brown sugar). I also added 1t vanilla to this mixture. Quick, easy & delicious!"
"4","5","Unbelievably delicious!!! It is so easy and my whole family loved them. The crust is so tender and the whole thing just melts in your mouth. Don't change a thing when you make them!!"
"4","5","My Husband thought these were great and I'll make these more often. My only change was to use 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. Great recipe. Will use it for my Bunco group."
"4","5","Unbelievable good!"
"4","5","Awesome and easy. Cut up and peel an extra apple and throw them in the juice for some more delight."
"4","5","Very good! They are great served warm with vanilla ice cream!"
"4","5","Oh My Goodness these are good! It is very hard to eat just one. My daughter just came in the room and asked me to hide them. She couldn't believe she just finished her 3rd dumpling. Followed the recipe with the exception of using 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and cooked the sugar/butter mixture for a few minutes until it thickened up a little. Also, poured the Mountain Dew around the dumplings instead of over them. This worked out well, giving the tops a chance to carmalize a little in the oven. This is a great recipe that we will enjoy often. Thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","This is a fantastic recipe!. The tip I would give is to let it sit for about 5 minutes before plating it and then when ready, serve with Ben and Jerry's (or any other brand of ) cinnamon ice cream (Cinnabon is what I used). Plate the dumpling, put the ice cream on ad drizzle some sauce over it all. It is a little slice of heaven. YUM!"
"4","5","wonderful and easy. made with splenda and diet mountain dew!"
"4","3","I'm surprised more people didn't write about how sopping they were from butter on the bottom. The overall taste was good, but they have WAY too much butter and that was unappetizing."
"4","1","These were not very good. The dough was mushy as was the apple filling. The sauce was good but a little too sweet."
"4","5","I love this apple dumpling recipe. When I make it, I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and it's still plenty sweet. Not as good with Sprite. Mountain Dew is the key! The recipe is always a hit and all my guests ask for the recipe. So easy too!"
"4","5","Sinfully easy and mouthwatering delicious! You won't be disappointed."
"4","5","I decided I HAD to make these today for father's day, which I did. MMMMMMMMMMM delicious!! I used Empire apples instead of the Gran. Smith. Just as good. Next time I think I will add a little bit of finely chopped walnut either inside or sprinkled on top. I made real whipped cream, (you know, the old fashion way with heavy cream beaten) for the top. Oh, it is soooooo good. Excuse me. I must go rest while the sugar coma wears off."
"4","5","The way I made these they are a 4 star recipe so I know if I had used the full fat ingredients, these would be more than a 5....a 7 or 8 at least and with a dollop of vanilla ice cream over one of these warm dumplings this for sure would be out of this world....but alas....since I choose to behave, here's what I did. I used reduced fat crescents, half real butter and half smart balance, splenda and diet mountain dew. Geesh, I'm so pathetically boring aren't I? Well even with those calorie saving measures these are so good. I can't imagine anyone wouldn't love this desert. Really treat yourself and your loved ones and fix these. Very easy to make also."
"4","4","Tasty quick little dumplings. I like the convience of the crescent rolls (used the reduced fat). I preferred them without any extra sauce as it was a bit grainy and took away from the flavor of the apple. If I make them again I'll probably halve the sauce part."
"4","5","What a great recipe for campers!! Simple ingredients, a breeze to make, and feeds a crowd easily. I served it with a dollop of Cool Whip and nobody believed I made it from scratch! Already friends are requesting I make it again."
"4","4","this was very good and very easy, halved the recipe and added more cinnamon and nutmeg. thanks for the post! 4 stars for taste, 5 stars for how easy it was."
"4","5","We all enjoyed these -will make again-THANKS!"
"4","5","I heard about this recipe from a friend who said these were fabluous and she was right! So easy and so good!!! Don't change a thing!!!"
"4","5","fantastic recipe and the best part is that it's so easy. We'll definately make these again."
"3","5","Excellent, I'm a diabetic so I had to modify the ingredients. I used Splenda for the sugar and diet Dew for the soda. I was truly shocked that this turned out so well after the modifications. My husband had no idea I had substituted those items and was truly in love with these from jump!"
"3","5","UPDATE 2/14/15: Followed adjustments by Canadiancook: 1) coat the apples in cinnamon and sugar before wrapping 2) Use 2 parts white to 1 part brown sugar in the sauce. simmer until it makes a thick, rich caramel and pulls away from the side of the pot. then add 1 tsp. vanilla along with the cinnamon. I only made half a batch for the husband and myself...the dish was not as 'soupy' as the first time I made it. I think boiling the sugar/butter mixture is the key. I found that using a cheaper crescent roll was not as good as Pillsbury brand; Pillsbury stretches nicely to cover the ends of the apples where the cheap brand did not. My Original Review: Easy and delicious...followed the recipe except for adding 1 tsp vanilla with the cinnamon to the butter/sugar mixture when it had thickened. Wow...RICH...but tasty! I would like to try it next time by reducing to: 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar."
"3","5","Loved it! This is easy and tastes yummy - though I did reduce to 1.5 sticks of butter, I probably could have done with 3/4 to 1 Cup of butter and less sugar!"
"3","5","My boyfriend is obsessed with this dish and it's so cheap and easy to make. I'm usually cooking for two so I cut the recipe down to 1 Granny Smith & 1 package of dough. The original recipe is very saucy so if you like it a little drier like I do, skip the Mountain Dew. I put a few pads of butter along with a sprinkling of brown and white sugar and cinnamon and pop it in the oven. I cut the sweetness by serving it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"3","2","I followed the recipe but they came out very mushy, like the dough was not cooked all the way. The taste was good though."
"3","2","I was disappointed in the outcome. With so many wonderful reviews it must have been something I did. The dough on the bottom was gummy and the sugar and butter separated leaving a thick layer of sugar underneath. It looked so promising."
"3","4","These were so good. The bottoms get a little gooey from the sauce but they have a wonderful flavor."
"3","5","Thoroughly enjoyed. Very easy."
"3","5","I like to drizzle caramel on top, after the apples cool down a bit, before I serve w/ ice cream. I also use reduced fat crescent rolls, cut the sugar down to 1 cup, and lessen the butter to about 3/4 stick. The Mountain Dew has plenty of sugar,too. There are never leftovers!"
"3","5","One was enough. I had two and though they were delicious going down, it felt like a sugar-bomb in my stomach. I might decrease the sugar next time."
"3","5","I like the traditional apple dumplings my mother used to make but I also like this version also. Initially I made the dumplings exactly as stated in the recipe. I now have modified it to suit my preferences & tastes. I like others cut down the sugar as I found it way too sweet. I don't have a large family so I half the recipe & I usen4 whole peeled & cored apples & use the Grand size crescents which is 4 large triangles which I shape around each apple. The only other change I make is that I put 1/2 tsp vanilla in with the sugar, cinnamon & butter."
"3","5","Delicious, quick and easy!!"
"3","4","Easy, fun and yummy, and the Mountain Dew gives it a very mild fruity overtone. They keep well (in the fridge) too; I just heated some up that were made two days ago, and they were fine and kept their texture well."
"3","5","I was a little nervous about this recipe...lol My family LOVED IT... I picked this one because it was so easy. Why bother making pie dough... I used siera mist since I did not have any mountain dew.. YUUUUUUUM"
"3","5","We have a new Christmas morning tradition with this recipe. I did exactly like printed. It would be good with a scoop of ice cream for dessert too."
"3","5","Halved the recipe, but followed directions exactly. This turned out really well - everyone enjoyed it. Had a great crunch on the top and the sauce worked well. Served with vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","I made this without the butter and cut the sugar to about 1/2 cup. I replaced the mountain dew with 7-up (that's what we had) and it still turned out really yummy."
"3","5","What a great recipe! I mixed 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar with 1 1/2 cups butter in a saucepan, cooked until smooth, removed from heat and added 1 tsp vanilla and the cinnamon. I rolled the apples in white sugar and cinnamon before wrapping in the crescent roll dough and poured the hot sugar/butter mixture over the dumplings in the baking dish. Then I poured the Mountain Dew over everything and baked for 35 minutes. Perfection! Not a soggy spot in the whole dish, just soft and moist on the bottom and crispy on top. Everyone loved them! My uncle swore they tasted just like the ones he used to have in grade school. Will definitely make again!"
"3","5","All I can say is OMG!!! Any recipe that still has 5 star average ratings with over 1,000 reviews, you KNOW it has to be out of this world delicious, and this is."
"3","5","This now one my families favorites desserts....I have to double it and once tripled the recipe to make sure everyone could have some. :0)"
"3","5","These are so unbelievably good!!!!! Just like many others, I was happy to see other very positive reviews but didn't really believe they'd be THIS good. And they are SO EASY TO MAKE! DELICIOUS! This will certainly be a permanent recipe in my all time favorites collection. A++++++"
"3","5","This is such a simple recipe, yet, an awesome treat! It was, by far, one of the best apple recipes I have ever tasted!"
"3","5","WOW - this is drop dead good...am currently making them again now."
"3","5","I did not change a thing on this recipe and it was awesome!!. Excellent Apple Dumplings. Do yourself a favor and don't make any changes to this recipe. It doesn't need any tweaking."
"3","5","This so unbelieveablely delicious. I also sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top of the cresent rolls after you pour the mountain dew in. When cooking the sugar mixture with the egg I also add almond extract. IT IS FABULOUS."
"3","5","These yummy treats are Amazing! They are so easy and fast to make it's incredible. I brought these to work and they were gone in no time. I saved one for my man and he ate the entire dumpling before I could even blink! Instead of using 1 1/2 cups of sugar I went with 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added one more step to mine; after I wedged the apples I sprinkled them with sugar and nutmeg for a little more flavor inside (not that anyone would even notice). Wonderful :)"
"3","5","Surprisingly delicious. And so simple!!"
"3","5","The Hubster kept saying 'Oh these are nasty!' as he gobbled them down. This is definitely going to be one of our family favorites from now on."
"3","5","Completely amazing! Tons of compliments when I made this for the first time this week! We used 1/2c white sugar, 1/4c brown sugar and only 1 1/2 sticks of butter. Worked perfectly when we had to double the recipe as well! Will DEFINITELY make again and again!!"
"3","5","Delicious! A new standby at our house for Thanksgiving and special occasions. It was out of this world good!"
"3","5","I fixed it and its absolutely delicious"
"3","5","Delicious! After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to use Ginger Ale (less sugar) and I halved the recipe. It served four adults with plenty of leftovers. An absolutely wonderful, easy dessert!"
"3","5","We made them last night. They were easy to make and everybody loved them! We used diet mountain dew, and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and added one teaspoon vanilla. Next time will use less sugar. Will try with 1/2 cup total.. will be sweet enough."
"3","5","OMG these are good. I used Splenda, Smart Balance butter, and low-fat dough to keep the damage to a minimum but it still came out amazing. Great recipe."
"3","4","You can half all of the fattening stuff (butter, sugar) and they're still delicious!!"
"3","5","I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was perfect. I’m amazed at how easy and tasty it is! Keep stirring the butter and sugar until it begins to look “foamy” and all one syrupy consistency. It will then drizzle nicely over the dumplings."
"3","5","This was SO good! Some reviewers mentioned that it was gooey at the bottom, very sweet, etc... That's what I like in a dessert! It was heavenly served warm over ice cream. I only used 1/2 cup of butter, used 1 cup of Splenda with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and had only 8 oz. of Mountain Dew. Very easy, and I'll definitely be using this recipe again!"
"3","5","I was skeptical at first, but these are amazing. I halved the recipe, and it's a good thing I did otherwise I would've eaten the whole 9x13 pan!"
"3","5","Very good. Easy and quick dessert. Served with a scoop of vanilla icecream."
"3","5","This was so delicious! I followed some of the suggestions that others have made and everyone who ate them LOVED them!"
"3","5","Made this recipe this last weekend and it was a major hit! Simple and easy to make. I did use diet Mt.dew instead of regular though because that's all I had on hand. Since I have some apples that are going to rot soon, I think I'm going to go ahead and roll the slices in the crescent rolls and freeze them to use later. Hopefully they'll be just as yummy! update: It's May, and apples aren't in season ,so subbed raspberries and bluberries for apples- still just as delicious!"
"3","4","These were ok. They were a little heavy for our liking. My little kids didn't eat them, a little shocking."
"3","2","I have only made this one time, and it did not turn out as I had hoped it would. I halved the recipe, and followed it exactly. I think that there is too much butter because that was all I seemed to taste when I tried them. If I made these again, I think I would greatly reduce the butter."
"3","5","Wow! I was very leery going into this, but I followed the recipe to a Tee and it came out amazing!!"
"3","5","Amazing! I served at dinner party and they got rave reviews. I only used 1/2c butter, 1c sugar, and 1c ginger ale and they were still plenty sweet/rich. Also had a few more apple slices than crescent rolls so I just tucked the apple slices in the pan with the rest. Yummy!"
"3","5","WOW! Super easy to make and tastes AMAZING!"
"3","5","Oh my, very very yummy. Took this to work and everyone loved it also. Second time I made it i cut the apples into quarters and used the big & flaky crescent rolls. Made it even better!"
"3","5","These are AMAZING! Wouldn't change a thing. I have passed this recipe on too many times to count."
"3","5","I made this recipe with some kid friends. They had a fabulous time using the cutter/corer and then popping the dough package and wrapping each apple slice in the dough. Everyone got a kick out of pouring the soda on top. We used 7up. Not only was it a great kid project but everyone, adults and kids, raved at how tasty it turned out! I got emails the next day asking for the recipe. I would make this over and over."
"3","5","I LOVE how simple this recipe is! I don't like the sugar substitute taste of 'diet' products, but we used diet Mountain Dew with reduced-fat dough and nobody could even tell the difference...even the men :)"
"3","5","Great recipe and so easy to make. I take 4 granny smith apples, peel and cut into quarters. I mix 1T sugar and 1/2 t cinnamon and toss the apples before wrapping them in the crescent roll I also substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for white sugar. Easy recipe to cut in half."
"3","5","Absolutely Delicious!!!! The sauce was a little sweet, so next time I will try 3/4 C. Sugar + 1/2 C. Brown Sugar & see how that goes. An easy, delicious dessert for any time!!! It is wonderful as is...I will just try to cut a bit of unnecessary sugar next time. try it-you will love it!!"
"3","5","this was a great recipe! Quick and delicious.....made very few changes and it came out great! Used 1 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar and added 1 tbsp vanilla extract. Add the vanilla after the sugar and butter has cooked together and the sugar has dissolved. Mixed 1/2 cup cream cheese with 3 tsp sugar and added a half teaspoon to each wedge before rolling! Did half with cream cheese and half without. The family enjoyed both but preferred the one with the cream cheese. Thank you for a wonederful and quick dessert."
"3","5","Fabulous!!!! Awesome!!!! I cut it in half because it is just me and my son..but wow...we will be making it again."
"3","4","Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very easy!"
"3","5","All I can say is....WOW! This is one of those desserts that I secretly eat from my children:)"
"3","5","Only one word can describe these.....YUM!! So easy and so full of flavour. Used 2 Gala apples and cut them into quarters since an 1/8 of an apple didn't seem like enough. 16 dumplings would have been way too much for our little family so I halfed everything else."
"3","4","These were yummy! I liked them better than my hubby did, but I would still make these again. Very easy!"
"3","2","I didn't know what to expect from this, but I didn't like this one."
"3","5","WoW These are so good it is almost to good I can not put them down! I went with 1 cup of sugar and a little under a cup of butter and used 2 teaspoons cinnamon. It is so unbelievably good. Thank you so much!"
"3","5","This was sensational. I took other reviewers advise and added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and it turned out amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone was asking for more. I will definitely be making this again."
"3","3","I love the idea of this recipe, and while I normally enjoy crescent rolls, their flavor overpowered everything else. It made for a strange aftertaste. I used Sprite, half brown sugar/half white sugar, increased the cinnamon, and added a dash of nutmeg. It was fragrant while baking and was beautiful and sticky golden-brown on top after I pulled it out of the oven, and I so wanted to love it. I'm sure I would have if not for the strange crescent roll taste-- the apples and glaze were quite good. I'll try it with premade pie dough like another user suggested."
"3","5","Wow, this was soooooo easy and delicious! I made it twice, first time I used the full amount of everything I melted the butter and than turned the temp down to about medium high and added half brown sugar half white sugar and let it blend well until the butter and sugars are goey and don't seperate I had to keep stirring it, than I added 1 tsp vanilla and the cinnamon. This was the perfect consistancy, I also used 7up which is what I had and it was great! Second time around I used 3/4 cup butter and 1 cup sugar (half brown half white) and I wasn't patient enough and melted the butter on HIGH so the butter seperated from the sugar and wouldn't go back together :) I also used Sprite, it's in the oven so I can't say how it will turn out but i'm sure it will be delicious...just make sure to melt the butter on medium high and add the sugar to that and wait until it's well blended before you add cinnamon and vanilla. But seriously with vanilla icecream this is OH MY GOD delicious and sooooo simple! Enjoy"
"3","4","These were surprisingly good. Took them to a family reunion and no leftovers to take home! I wish I could figure out a way to the outside a little crispier but they weren't terribly soggy, really. I certainly think they'd be better fresh from the oven with some ice cream! I used 3 apples, probably Golden Delicious. Cut them into six wedges instead of eight. Used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, & only about 4-6 oz of Sun Drop (soda machine was out of Mt. Dew). Beautifully golden brown after 25-30 minutes! Whole house smelled great!"
"3","5","I made these for my ladies Bible study last week and they were a huge hit. Who know this recipe would be that good, but it is!! I will be trying this recipe with peaches today and am looking forward to it. I made the recipe as is. Awesome and thanks for sharing."
"3","5","Delic!!! First time my boo ever had dumplings and he could only say, 'wow'. When I added the mt. dew, I put it around the dumplings rather than pouring it on top so not to remove the brown sugar. This allowed the tops of the dumplings to be crispy. GREAT RECIPE"
"3","5","What a surprise! Very good! The mountain dew was definitely the secret ingredient. Smelled heavenly. I had trouble figuring out the proper way to roll with the wrappers but regardless, it turned great. Thanks for the recipe."
"3","5","OMG! This was FANTASMIC! SUper easy!! You have to make it! I used diet Mountain Dew and substituted 1/2 cup of white for brown sugar. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS!"
"3","5","This was absolutley wonderful. I foolowed the recipe as written and my family raved about how good it was. My husband gave it 10 stars, and coming from him that is a compliment. Thanks for sharing..."
"3","5","WOW!! This was so easy & so delicious! I highly recommend!"
"3","1","I personally didnt like it. Too much fluid in the recipe makes this super soggy on the bottom. Needs more cinnamon too. My husband thought it was ok but def not as good as it should have been. Oh well, the search continues for an awesome apple dumplin recipe."
"3","4","These were great! Who would have ever thought to put Mountain Dew in Apple Dumplings? Very creative! Next time I make them I'll use only 1 cup of sugar, they were a little too sweet for my taste. I'll be making this quirky recipe again soon."
"3","5","I have made this recipe several times with excellent results. I follow the recipe as written except I add 1 tsp vanilla. I also have made it with fresh peaches, and delicious as well!"
"3","5","Best dessert ever! I made it with Mtn Dew the first time but only had 7up the second time. You can use any lemon-lime soda and the result will be the same...a beautiful carmelized dumpling. I sub brown sugar for white and stir the sugar/butter mixture until it gets nice and thick but not foamy. If you let it get too thick, it plops onto the cooking dish instead of covering the top of the dumplings. Stop stirring when it gets nice and thick but still syrupy, like in the photo by Shalaine_1. Yummy"
"3","5","Used Red Delicious apples and recipe turned out great. Next time I'll cut sugar in half, especially if served with vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","wow!"
"3","4","Amazing- loved them!"
"3","5","Everyone in my family agreed these were 5 stars. Even my hubby who only eats his mom's blue ribbon apple pie :-) Thanks for the super easy and wonderful recipe!! Oh... and I didn't have mountain dew, so I substituted sprite... worked great!"
"3","5","These are absolutely delicious! I used half brown/half white sugar and rolled the apples in the sugar cinnamon before rolling them in the crescent dough. Who knew that adding Mountain Dew would to this would make it soooo good. Topped it off with a little scoop of french vanilla and ooolaaalaaa. A nice sweet ending to Easter dinner. Thanks for the great recipe, a keeper for sure!"
"3","5","Never in a million years would I imagine this mix of ingredients could be so delicious. I made a half batch and my husband and I polished em off in one setting. Hubby proclaimed them to be the 'best dessert he has ever had' and neither of us even like Mountain Dew on it's own. I will definately be making these for a family get together in the near future!"
"3","5","Fantastic - first time followed directions exactly (might have had bigger chunks of apple than in recipe). Second time was out of mountain dew and tried coke- not so good. Stick to the recipe for a great smelling treat."
"3","5","Simple and amazingly delicious.....and IMPOSSIBLE to screw up!"
"3","5","Wow! This was a hit tonight and so easy to make. My kids helped roll and pinch the dumplings. We then put them into the pan, added the topping and carried the pan to our neighbors to bake there while we were enjoying dinner. Like others, I used 3/4 c. white and 3/4 c. brown sugar and only 3/4 c. butter so that the topping would be more like a syrup. They came out perfectly crispy on top after 35 minutes. Fantastic presentation while still in the pan or scooped out individually. They were perfect with real vanilla ice cream on the side. A+++"
"3","5","Wow! So easy to whip up and very delicious."
"3","3","my husband thought it was too much butter and I thought they were too sweet. SO with that being said I am convinced to try these again only reducing things. I ended up taking them to work for a pot luck, and still had 2 left at the end of the day. I will not be defeated tho. hee hee going to try again with less butter and less sugar. great idea, just needs some tweaking for our tastes. thanks for submitting the recipe!!"
"3","5","Absolutely amazing! I used one cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar as a previous user suggested. I also dipped the dumplings in brown sugar right after I coated them with the dough. This made the tops just a touch more crispy! Very delicious :)"
"3","5","I was skeptical because of the recipe including Mountain Dew, but they came out amazing! I halved the recipe. The leftovers dont hold well in the fridge though."
"3","5","Delicious, but very, very, very SWEET! (That's saying a lot, since I'm a sugarholic!) I will try diet soda or less sugar next time. Wonderful recipe, though; definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","These were perfect!! I used Diet Ginger Ale instead of the mtn dew and it still turned out perfectly. So very yummy!"
"3","5","These are the best & easiest to make. Years ago my sweet GM found this recipe and changed the way she made hers 'best thing since sliced bread' she said. She also used pears instead of the apples and we liked those even better!"
"3","5","This was probably one of the quickest most insanely delicious desserts I've had in ages. Halved recipe - perfect for 8x8 pan. Didn't put quite 6 oz of MDew in - probably about 4 1/2 oz, and used (as recommended by others) 1/2 c sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Topped with whipped cream, but vanilla icecream would have been SO much better. Thanks so much for the GREAT recipe!"
"3","5","So Yummy!"
"3","5","Simple, quick and tastes great! Used 1 cup white 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla to butter & sugar mixture before pouring over dumplings, used Diet Ginger Ale instead of Mountain Dew. Looked like a LOT of liquid, was afraid it was too much but the hubby has eaten all the syrup and we still have a few dumplings left! These are great served warm with Vanilla ice cream. I think I've gotten 2 out of the whole pan :) Will be making many more times, thanks for the great recipe!"
"3","5","This little thing is soo good!! easy and delicious! i did however only have sprite as i hate montian dew it was delicious, heck i dont even need apples just the dough and sryup, these are dangerous so i cant make too often as i'd eat the whole pan. 10 stars all the way."
"3","2","Mushy, the soda gave it a weird flavor. Not a fan."
"3","5","I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I have made this for my last three events and people are still asking for the recipe. I've even had some people ask for these dumplings instead of a Birthday cake or a Birthday present. You won't be sorry you tried it!!!!!!"
"3","5","Oh my! Very good. Used 1/4 brown, 1/2 cup white sugars. After melted, added in 1 tsp vanilla. Also, sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking."
"3","5","These things are so incredibly good!!! I was sceptical about something with Mountain Dew (well, actually, it was the generic store brand) and packaged rolls, but I was hankering for something sweet and I had all the ingredients on hand. I only made 1/2 a recipe, because I only had 2 small apples and one package of crescent rolls. Because they were small, I cut the apples into 1/4's instead of 1/8/'s. The 1/4's fit fine in each dough triangle. Make sure to pinch the dough so it is sealed completely, so they don't get soggy on the inside. A little stretching and pinching is all it took, not very difficult. Instead of 3/4 cup of sugar for the 1/2 recipe, I used 1/2 cup and they were plently sweet, with the just the right amount of gooey, rich, spicy sauce to spoon over the crispy-topped-perfect-dough-melting-apple little wonders. Also added 1/4 tsp. ground ginger and a pinch of ground cloves to the butter/sugar mixture. Wickedly good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream over their warm, wanton lusciousness..."
"3","5","Loved it! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 12 ounces of Ginger Ale instead of Mountain Dew. I served them with vanilla ice cream on top. So delicious."
"3","5","I used low fat rolls, Diet Mt. Dew and Splenda. I have made this three times, served to family and friends..... I have had requests for more. They are really good!!!"
"3","5","Made them for Thanksgiving and they were really enjoyed. The only things that I changed were suggested earlier, 1 1/2 sticks of butter and half brown sugar and half white. The next time I make them I will try using only 1 stick of butter though."
"3","5","Fantastic!. I thought the 2 sticks of butter sounded like an awful lot so I reduced it to 1 stick and they turned out great. Even better with a scoup of vanilla ice cream. Will definately make again and again. These are easy for kids to help also."
"3","5","I have had this recipe for a couple of years. Also made it with fresh peaches and was great too. I sprinkle my crescent rolls with cinnamon sugar mixture."
"3","5","Fantastic! I couldn't believe how easy this was. I made for Thanksgiving, and had pleas to make for Christmas. I added a little nutmeg to enhance the flavor. A new favorite in our household."
"3","5","WOW! These are absolutely amazing! I didn't have any Mountain Dew soda (bought it for this recipe and the kids got to it before I had a chance to make these) so I substituted cran-raspberry juice mixed with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Made again a few nights later and used a can of Sunkist mandarin orange soda. Both were wonderful. I guess I'll have to try it sometime using Mountain Dew:) CRAZY GOOD with vanilla ice cream!"
"3","5","Amazing, very fast and tasty .Thanks a lot!"
"3","5","I can't believe how easy these were to make, and SO good! Great when you realize last minute you need to bring a dessert somewhere!"
"3","5","Make these! No really, if you are reading this make them! I halved the recipe and hubby and I ate all 8 in one setting, after dinner. While they will smell delicious coming out, make yourself wait. Once they cool the sugar forms this dried layer on top and makes them taste even better. I think next time I will try the big rolls and stuff even more apple in."
"3","5","Delicious and simple! Keeping this one on hand :)"
"3","5","Very yummy. My husband loved it. However, it was too sweet (I never say that about desserts lol). Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar. But. . . we loved it."
"3","5","Totally awsome!!!!! Please beleive all these great reviews! Early last week my boss was telling me about how good these apple bundels were made with Mt. Dew! I thought these sound good and maybe I will try them sometime. On Friday I came across them here and on the way home from work I stopped to get the few things I did not have to make them. Firday night I made them and I just cannot beleive how good they are and how easy they are to make! I tried some with a scoop of Schwan's Autumn Treat icecream, pumpkin-cinnamon-pecan! OMG!!! You must try this!I will be making these alot! My ladies group will love these for our refreshments!"
"3","5","KEEPER! I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan. I did not have white sugar on hand, so I used light brown sugar instead. OMG! It tasted so amazing with the brown sugar I won't even be trying it with the white sugar. Be sure to add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the warm dumpling before eating. I am going to try this with peaches next. Mmmmm...."
"3","5","My family loved this. Trying to cut down on fat and calories I only used half cup of butter and 3/4 cup sugar. They were delicious and sweet."
"3","5","I absolutely loved this one... everyone has so far.. whats not to love. I just made a few adjustments. Made one roll of crescent rolls (low fat) used less butter and less sugar (used brown sugar) and used diet citrus soda.. still came out yummy. Thanks so much for the recipe. ;o)"
"3","5","Add me to the list of those who loved this recipe. I followed others advice to cut down on fat and sugar. I used lowfat crescents, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and only 1/2 cup better. I also cut apple into sixths. Terrific!"
"3","4","These were delicious! Truly tastes like apple pie. However, I only gave 4 stars because there is WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER. You could easily half the butter, sugar, cinnamon mixture and be just fine, as well as only using 1/2 can of soda. I will definitely make these again because they are so easy and taste sooo good!"
"3","5","Just as good as everyone suggests. I cut the sugar 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 1/2 sticks butter. Used whatever apples I had available and it turned out excellent. I made everything ahead of time except the soda and put in fridge. Added the Mountain dew right before I put in the stove. I suggest you serve warm with ice cream. YUMMY!!!"
"3","5","My family keeps 'begging' me to make these daily! THAT's how good they are. I AM NOT a baker; I break out in hives just thikning about the process. I cut sugar to 1/4 cup each of white & brown; cut butter to 1/4-1/2 C. I tripled cinnamon, 2 capfuls of vanilla & poured Mountain Dew...Makes house smell like Cinnabon heaven! I'm a baker now...haha SO SIMPLE!"
"3","1","These 'dumplings' turned out a bit strange. I thought the 'sauce' it was in was weird. I didn't have the gumption to eat it, so maybe my opinion is biased. I gave it a star because it has apples in it. That's the ONLY reason."
"3","4","This was a dessert that looked and tasted quite good - good enough for company. We did find it a bit sweet for our liking. When I make it again I will use half the sugar and butter and double the cinnamon."
"3","5","These are the absolute BEST! I always make mine using the recipe for Basic Flaky Pie Crust, never cresent roll dough. I roll out the dough, cut it in triangles, and roll my apple wedge up in it. Delicious!"
"3","5","I would never have thought to use mountain dew for any kind of recipe but it really was fabulous! The recipe is so simple and good. I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and the butter to one stick and I even think next time I may reduce sugar more since it is so sweet. I used fuji apples and topped with vanilla ice cream and it was so good! A definite keeper."
"3","5","wow, delicious!! It almost needed more apples, though. Next time I might throw some extra slices in with the syrup."
"3","5","yummy but a bit too sweey for us. will 1/2 sugar and butter next time."
"3","5","YUM is the word that comes to mind. I made these late last night for work today. While they would have probably been even better warm from the oven with whipped cream that was not a possibility. I popped them back into the oven at work on low for about 20 min. to warm them up then let everyone have at it! They were OUTSTANDING. Will definately make again to serve warm from the oven. I did cut back a bit on the sugar (1 cup) for the syrup and 1 stick of butter instead of a cup, added a dash of vanilla per another reveiwer and let it cook just a little longer to thicken it and I did toss my apples with a little sugar, cinnamon and teensy bit of flour before rolling up in crescent dough. Added just 3/4 of the mountain dew and my syrup came out rich and thick. Love this recipe!!!! Will make again and again."
"3","5","These were surprisingly delicious and simple! I used 1/2 cup of brown and white sugar and diet gingerale and baked for 35 minutes. They came out crispy and browned on the top and buttery on the bottom. A terrific recipe!"
"3","5","I have to admit I was a skeptic, but this recipe is amazing! It was such an easy dessert to make, but tasted like it took hours....not to mention it made the house smell delcious. I halved the reciple and followed the advice of other reviewers by adding a tsp of vanilla to the sugar mixture and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I didn't have mountain dew on hand so substituted ginger ale. I also left my apple unpeeled, but the apple was so soft inside you couldn't even tell. My hubby hasn't stopped talking about these dumplings! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"3","5","y-u-m-m-y!!! I coated the apples in 'apple pie spice' and added 1/2 a caramel with the apple before wrapping with the crescent roll dough. Took the advice of several other reviewers and cut the sugar amount using 3/4 c brown and 1/4 c white sugar. Dusted these with chopped pecans and served with vanilla ice cream. What an absolute treat, EVERYONE loved these. Docswife, you nailed this recipe. Thank you for sharing. It was out of this world good."
"3","4","This is what I used: fuji apples (hold up well when baking and are spicey-sweet so compliments the sugar in the recipe), reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/2c brown sugar, 1/3c granulated sugar, 5 Tbsp. butter, 8 Tbsp. Smart Balance, and diet Mt. Dew. I sprinkled the apple wedges with a little kosher salt and with cinnamon and freshly-ground nutmeg; then I rolled them up. They looked just like the picture. Served them warm with optional ice cream. I would have given them 5 stars because they are very tasty and easy to make, but I'm not sure how much I like the soggy bottom."
"3","5","These were awesome!! I would just quarter the apples next time, though. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for."
"3","5","Wonderful , quick and easy.Tasted so___good. Thanks for the great recipe."
"3","5","Excellent! For a less sweet, healthier, simpler version, try using the following alterations, and keeping the rest the same: .25 C butter instead of 1 C; omit sugar and increase soda by an extra 1/2 cup (16 oz - or 2 C - total). I have seen suggestions on other Web sites to use diet soda (Sprite is what I used - no caffeine!), but I am suspicious of how that might affect the taste. If you make the recipe this way, since it isn't quite so sweet, you might like to serve frozen vanilla yogurt with it. This provides healthy probiotics as well, if you use frozen yogurt with live and active cultures. Also, these alterations make the recipe more diverse - even suitable for a breakfast/brunch dish. It's not blatantly sweet enough to be only a dessert any more."
"3","5","This dessert is good beyond belief. You must get over any delusions you might have about making this healthier. Yes, it is loaded with butter and sugar - but oh, it is a marvelous thing. I added about a tsp of vanilla extract to the melted butter/sugar mixture. When you prepare it, the poor little apple rolls will look as if they are drowning in liquid. But have faith - let them bake. WOW - just WOW. This is sinfullly rich - but you absolutely must have it with vanilla ice cream for the complete experience. The crescent rolls bake up sort of crusty on the top, tender and gooey with the butter-dew sauce on the bottom. Thus the 'dumpling' effect. And you simply must use a spoon to slurp up all the saucy buttery goodness. Seriously - if you are wondering, 'Should I try this?' then all I can say is, 'Yes, you really should.' But if you don't, then that will just leave a few more apples and crescent rolls out there for me........joy on a plate."
"3","5","This recipe looks scary, but the result is sublimely delicious! When the dumplings were done, I poured out the excess liquid. Served with whipped cream on top. It was a huge hit."
"3","5","I made these last night for a New Years party because I had a bunch of leftover apples and didn't want them to go to waste. I am SOOOOOO happy I did!! This recipe is PHENOMENAL!!! I made my own variations to cut down on the calories. I used reduced-fat crescent rolls, only 1c sugar and Diet Mountain Dew. They were so gooey and delicious. However, next time I'll cut back even more. There was a lot of extra unnecessary juices so next time I'll use 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. sugar and only 8 oz of Dew. But all in all, this is very easy and surprisingly quick and the results are incredible!"
"3","5","Tried this last night for dessert with friends as we waited for 2010 to come in. The country dumplings were absolutely the best. Everyone enjoyed them and at the first bite remarked, 'this is really good.' I followed the advice of others and cut back on the sugar using 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white, and 1/2 cup plus 2 T of butter. Sixteen dumplings were a lot for just the 4 of us, so I'll cut the recipe in half when I make it again for my husband and me. Thanks for a great, easy to make dessert. Note: another recipe on this site called Mountain Apple Cobbler is the same except that it calls for 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon while this one calls for 1 teaspoon. I think the smaller amount is better."
"3","4","Very yummy but I would suggest adding more apples and a little less breading."
"3","5","One more thumbs-up review from me. And I agree with other posters; you can probably cut down on the amount of sugar/butter in the future with equally good results. Ultimately, all of the butter/sugar/soda mixture ends up in the pan and really just becomes a sauce that you can choose to serve with it or not. These were suprisingly light and very good. Great textures, flavors, and it seems to be a very forgiving recipe as well."
"3","5","I've made these over ten times now, and it's one of my favorite desserts. Super easy, delicious, and imaginative. LOVE it! Thanks for the great recipe."
"3","5","I made these for a friend's bday desert and they were a huge hit! I also topped each with french vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup! Yummy! I'll definately make again!"
"3","5","Okay, I was VERY skeptical that this could possibly be good, but had to try it because of all the great reviews. It was incredibly easy to put together(took about 5 minutes) and it was absolutely delicious!! My family raved about how good it was! This will be a regular last minute dessert at our house from now on. I think I will sprinkle it with chopped pecans next time for a little crunch."
"3","4","Way too much sugar unless your apples are very tart! If I make it again I'd cut the sugar back to 1 cup. Otherwise, I recommend the recipe."
"3","5","This is simply fabulous and easy to make! I am glad I decided to use the crescents instead of just buying pie crust, it makes all the difference :). I halved my Stayman Winesap apples which I sprinkled with brownsugar/white sugar + cinnamon before wrapping them up fully in crescent rolls. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (brown+ white sugar) and drizzle over all the apples than added the mountain dew. So wonderful, everyone loved them and wanted to know how to make them. Don't pass this gem up!"
"3","5","very yummy and easy to make. i usually like a vanila sauce with my dumplings but this reminds me of a caramel sauce."
"3","5","So EASY and so DELICIOUS! I used Cortland apples because I like them better and I also used five apples to make it more applely. I had my doubts that these would be good through the whole process especially when I poured a can of Mt. Dew on them but my GOODNESS they were WONDERFUL! Update: We used about seven apples and put the extra apples around the dumplings. The result: yummy baked apples in a delicious sauce with the best dumplings EVER. Wow! Whee!"
"3","5","This recipe is easy and delicious. The only change I made was to use diet Mountain Dew. One suggestion I have is to roll out the dough triangles to make them a bit wider. This made it much easier to wrap and encase the apple slice."
"3","5","This recipe was so easy to make, and absolutely delicious! I was skeptical about the Mountain Dew soda in the recipe, however it made these Country Apple Dumplings fantastic!... and I give it 5 stars!"
"3","5","I halved this recipe and it was gone in a flash! Hubby LOVED it! Said I could make it again any time, and since we just bought a bushel of fresh apples, it looks like we'll be having it again and again! I did use half brown, half white sugar as suggested in other reviews. I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was wonderful and rich."
"3","5","Couldn't have been any better!!! Flaky, soft on the inside, perfect mix of sweet and tart. Added a little bit of nutmeg and ginger for flavor. And to top it off, super easy!"
"3","5","I wanted to make this for my girls before school on those chilly fall mornings, but I also wanted it to be a healthy, filling breakfast. I used diet Mountain Dew and Splenda instead of sugar, used spray cooking oil in place of butter, but best of all...I put down a layer of shredded cheddar cheese on the crescent roll before placing the apple wedge to up the protein and calcium (I'm sure fat free cream cheese would work too). I'm sure it's not the same as the original recipe, but it's a school-morning variation and it was absolutely delicious! Best of all, I had the pan prepared the night before so I just popped it in the oven in the morning while they dressed."
"3","5","I have always made these, but with fresh peaches instead of apples. I will definitely try with the apples, especially when peaches are not in season. In either case, these are absolutely amazing and every time I make them the disappear before I know it! Everyone is always so shocked to hear that Mt. Dew is in this yummy dessert (I never tell them until after they eat them all up)!"
"3","5","These were sooooo good. I followed the recipe exactly only I used ginger ale except for the mountain dew, and half the amount. Also I found it a bit hard to get the dumplings off the pan without the apples falling out. I think maybe lining the baking sheet with wax paper or something would help. Absolutely yummy otherwise!"
"3","5","This was so great...made it for a football party and everyone asked for seconds, even after being so full from a day of snacking! Some slight changes based on past reviews: Used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, also used a can of canada dry instead of the mtn. dew. Added a teaspoon or so of vanilla to the sugar as it melted. Also, used reduced fat crescent rolls (with the butter in the sugar no one can tell.) When serving, scraped up some of the extra 'sauce' and poured it over the top for some added gooey goodness! Will be making again (and again!)"
"3","5","i am not a big fan of apple pie, but this is like a a cheater's way to making a better and easier/faster pie. it is mostly more crust and sauce than apples and really really sweet. so if you cut the butter and sugar by 1/3rd it would be a lot better. great by itself but better w/ vanilla ice cream"
"3","5","Note to self: cheap, working-mother friendly apple dumpling recipe is fast and amazing!"
"3","5","mmmmmm gooey and delicious!!! I will be making this again. Oh and if you are wondering whether you should cover it with tin foil or not DON'T!"
"3","2","Wow! I was sooo disappointed. I followed the recipie to a T and it was way too buttery! Sorry, not a keeper in my book!"
"3","5","This recipe is amazingly simple and delicious. When making this I use only one cup of sugar, half a can of mountain dew, and also add one teaspoon of vanilla. When you serve this make sure that you spoon some of the sauce over the top of your dumpling or even your ice cream. It's divine!"
"3","5","Absolutely delish! Can't hardly believe it, but the children loved it also! Will probably try the other types of soda (ginger ale or sprite) because of the caffeine. Try it, you will like it!"
"3","5","I loved this recipe! It was so easy and tastes delicious! My husband loved it and requests it weekly now! I did, however, make mine with reduced fat crescent rolls, splenda, and diet mt. dew, but it was still amazing. Its great with a touch of vanilla ice cream!"
"3","5","Husband of 63 yrs. says it is the best dessert I have ever made."
"3","5","I have a similar recipe, but with a few critical changes: First, I use whole apples, and I find that Jonathon or Macintosh work better...actually, if you can find them, Paula reds are the best! I peel the apples, slice in half & core. I also use the bigger crescent rolls, or if I can't find those, will use 1 1/2 rolls per apple, placing 2 halves in each roll. I use an equal combination of white and brown sugar, double the cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla. After pouring the Mountain Dew over the apples, I sprinkle each apple with some red-hot candies (little cinnamon candies found in the baking section of your grocery store), and sprinkle a little in the pan as well. after baking, I sprinkle the tops with a little dusting of powdered sugar. I get rave reviews from friends & family, and am always asked to bring these to potlucks!"
"3","5","Absolutely wonderful. We served this with a premium vanilla ice cream drizzled with a little caramel sauce."
"3","4","This Apple Dumpling recipe is the best! It is so easy, and very tasty. My girlfriend made this for a small gathering. I think it was a big hit with everyone!"
"3","5","Unbelievable!! Husband said it was the best thing I've ever made. Simple, simple, simple and oh so good!!!!!! I thought they would be soggy, but this is not the case at all."
"3","5","Veary good--used 1/2 the amount of butter and sugar."
"3","5","YUM! Loved them. I'm keeping this one in my recipe box.I was very worried about putting soda. I did use the tip to flip them over and drain some liquid. it gave it a nice crispy caramel bottom. I am making them again tonight."
"3","5","Who would think this would be so awesome! I didn't change a thing. I cut the apples ahead of time, and placed them in lemon water and stored in the fridge. The butter separates from the sugar a little bit, but I just spooned it over the dumplings and it worked fine. A lot of the sauce cooks away so don't be frightened (at the 20 minute mark, it looked like soup). Just make sure you have some ice cream to serve with them! I received rave reviews from my father (who is quite critical) and my husband (who doesn't lie about his food dislikes). When I saw them getting seconds, I knew it was a keeper! Thanks!"
"3","1","Just tie ropes to me and float me down Macy's holiday parade. This recipe has 10 times too much butter and sugar in it. It is sweeter than pancakes. Like chugging syrup from the bottle. I transferred the dumplings out of the baking pan right after removing them from the oven and siphoned off all the extra syrup. I have enough run-off to make another batch. This recipe is probably very good but I would like to taste something else besides buttery sugar."
"3","5","I love this recipe! This is an apple dumpling that is basically simmered in the sauce. SO yes, the bottom is going to be wet. But who cares? The dough is thoroughly cooked regardless. The bottom is soft and moist while the top is crisp and carmalized. I love to drizzle the extra sauce over the top of the dumpling. I serve with vanilla bean ice cream and....YUM! I already bought more ingredients so I can make it again!"
"3","5","I modified this recipe also by using splenda and diet mountain dew and it turned out great! I also sprinkled cinnamon on the apple slices before I rolled them in the crescent roll! Also I sprinkled a cup of crushed walnuts over top before I put it in the oven and it was awesome. I've already had people asking me for the recipe."
"3","2","I didn't read all the reviews before making these -- just sort of skimmed the first few. Now that I've made them, I realize that one before me indicated that these came out all soggy. That's exactly what happened to me; it was disgusting! I was able to save them by transferring them to another pan and flipping to the opposite side -- the side that was so wet. I baked them for another 15 minutes or so on that side. Then, because they were still a bit of a wet mess, I actually put them under the broiler for a few minutes. In the end, these tasted very good, but I don't know that they were worth all that effort. Something I would do in the future is to make the recipe as is minus the Mt.Dew."
"3","5","This was WONDERFUL. I could not believe something so easy could be so good. I only used 1 1/2 sticks of margarine and 1 cup of sugar and I did not change anything else. Next time I will try the reduced fat cresents. Thanks for the recipe"
"3","5","I can't believe how easy and tasty this was. I didn't change a thing, just served it with vanilla ice cream. Yum!"
"2","5","awesome. It's is a major hit."
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I made one slight alteration though; after skinning and slicing the apples, I put them in a bowl with 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon. I add water one tbsp at a time to make a pasty coating of the mixture over the apples before rolling them in the crescent roll dough. I served them warm with French vanilla ice cream. It made each dumpling like a miniature apple pie!"
"2","5","My boyfriend loves this desert.. I use strawberry ice cream or with chocolate ice cream.. I enjoyed this too. I am making it again tonight"
"2","5","Delicious :-)"
"2","5","Absolute heaven!!"
"2","5","A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. Even better the next day when reheated, so plan to make extras. :)"
"2","5","Excellent desert. I had so many comments on it I am very pleased with how it turned out and so easy. every one is shocked when I said there is mountain dew in it. Don't know why but it works"
"2","5","Delicious.... I made this tonight... Just used half the butter sugar combo and half the Mountain Dew.... Also coated apples with cinnamon sugar prior to wrapping crescent triangles...Top was golden brown at 35 mins.... Spread a thin layer of the butter mixture to the top.... It was crunchy on top.... Not too gooey at the bottom... Apples were so soft... I also used peaches... Both were very good...."
"2","5","excellent base. I followed the directions and then added more stuff. cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg. I also diced some pecans and added them to DICED apples. the redi-whipped loved these too. such a great way to wake your kids up with the smell of these in the house. truly outstanding, one of the best recipes on this site."
"2","4","Very good. Hubby is diabetic so I used trivia white and brown sugars as well as diet Mountain Dew. Worked like a charm. Hubby lapped it up."
"2","5","I did use two pieces of apple per roll(rolled in sugar/cinnamon) and added pecans, melted butter, sugar 3/4 cup brown, & 1/4 Spenda. Baked 10 mins then added soda. Used parchment paper for easy clean up. Really awesome just very sweet will reduce sugar by half next time and many times to come!! (see picture)"
"2","3","1 1/2 cups of sugar is TOO MUCH!!! 1 cup of butter is TOO MUCH."
"2","5","This recipe is delicious. I am always asked to make it for get-togethers! The first time I made it with a can of Mountain Dew. It was delicious but very mushy and the dough didn't seem to be cooked enough. Now I make it without the Mountain Dew and it's perfect. The sugar caramelizes on the bottom. Enjoy!  Also, I recommend putting the baking dish on a cookie sheet in case it bubbles over."
"2","4","I have made these a couple of times with thumbs up from family and friends. They are yummy though perhaps a bit too sweet as written."
"2","5","Absolutely spectacular. This was dessert for Memorial Day, 2014. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfectly. My oven bakes faster than most recipes, so the roll dough was done at about 25 minutes. If you are looking for an easy desert that will impress your friends and family with minor effort, this is it."
"2","5","Yummy! The only change I made was to coat the apples in cinnamon & sugar before rolling in the crescent rolls."
"2","5","I can't believe I'm just getting around to rating this. I find that the sauce amounts can be halved. The full amount of the sauce ingredients have the dumplings swimming. But this is very delicious."
"2","5","Wow! I pulled two apple dumpling recipes to try last night, this one and one made with buttermilk biscuits and orange juice. This one won, hands down! I used 1/2 cup white and brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Like others, I used a mini can of 7-up and poured it around the dumpings and not on them. The dumplings cooked perfectly, not soggy and really good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is a keeper!"
"2","5","This recipe never fails! My daughter is a college student, and she makes it all the time for her friends. I am not fond of normal apple dumplings, but this recipe has just enough apple flavor without the texture that I don't care like."
"2","5","Easy and quick...I have served it twice for guests and it truly gets rave reviews. This is a definite 'go to' dessert recipe for me!"
"2","5","Made these last night and they are AMAZING! Simple to make. Only substitution I made was to use Diet Sierra Mist instead of the Mt Dew."
"2","5","Surprisingly good. It is dumpling like. Easy to make and fun."
"2","5","This was awesome! I followed some the suggestions to cook the caramel mixture a little longer and add vanilla. Also used 7up instead of Mountain Dew and was sure to pour it around the dumplings instead of on them. Served it with old fashioned vanilla ice cream - for our first serving......2 hours later, we had our second serving without ice cream - BOTH were delicious."
"2","5","I had a blast with this recipe. I've been craving something like this and FINALLY SUCCESS! I wanted to follow the recipe EXACTLY as written but when reaching for the cinnamon I realized I had 'apple pie spice' so I used that instead. Also, I used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew just because I've never really been a fan of that soda. After serving it I did have to pour out some of the liquid. I was afraid it would make the leftovers soggy and mush. Day 2 it was just as good :)"
"2","5","Excellent! My mother tried these first and I have to say I didn't believe her when she told me how great these were. I will have to think twice before making another apple pie for a holiday. These are easier to make and better tasting. Everyone in the house loved them!"
"2","4","Have made this at least 10 times in the last few months. My family loves it. I've learned a couple of things. It really tastes better with just 1 cup of sugar. You get more flavor of the apple and cinnamon and not just way sweet. The other thing is when making a large amount for a crowd if you place them tight together the liquid/steam cannot escape and reduce down to a nice sauce. Also the dough will not 'cook'. You absolutely do not want to overcrowd the pan. All that said it's a really easy fun dish that will impress."
"2","5","Truly fantastic. Incredibly easy and quick to prepare. I made some of them with sprinkling cinnamon sugar on the apples before wrapping and some of them without. The ones with the cinnamon sugar on the apples were tastier but both were very good and a big hit! Thank you for a great recipe! Will most definitely be making these again! Update: Made these again this evening. I cut down on the soda this time, decreased the butter so the sugar/brown sugar mixture was a bit thicker. They were perfect...not soggy on the bottom at all. My daughter says, 'These are like a treat for the gods!'. So scrumptious."
"2","5","This recipe is a show stopper. I've made it a number of times recently. (I cut the butter and sugar in half, with no problem) EVERYONE asks for the recipe and is shocked at how easy it is. You can roll up the apples, place them in the baking dish and refrigerate them. Then when you are ready add the other ingredients and bake them."
"2","5","Let me just say that I am not the baking type. But I wanted to do something with my 12 year old son who had wanted me to make something with him. I had tasted apple dumplings for the first time about a month ago and fell in love with them. This one was not not like the one I had and reading the ingredients made me wonder how it would turn out, but my son wanted to try it and we did. One, my son hates anything apple but he LOVES these. We made them, they are simple and delicious. My boyfriend who just goes with the flow actually complimented me on these and said they were so gooooooood. lol. This is a recipe I will definitely be making again. Very popular in my house. Thanks so much for the recipe."
"2","5","WOW! These should be illegal! The only change I made was to add a little nutmeg with the cinnamon, simply because I like it with apples. These were addicting! To those who thought they were too sweet -don't choose a recipe that takes 1 1/2 cups of sugar and a can of soda! Make sure you use tart, cooking apples and they won't turn into 'applesauce'. I baked the dumplings the full 45 min. They were wonderful, old-fashioned, baked-in-syrup apple dumplings that were so much easier to make."
"2","5","Great, easy recipe. Be careful not to add too much mountain dew. My first batch came out a bit soupy:("
"2","5","I made this today and it is worth the stars. The recipe is very quick and easy to make; you can't mess this up. Just two comments in that I could not find 10 oz. crescent roll dough; the standard seems to be 8 oz. so I bought 3. When I make again I will cut back on some of the butter and probably use less sugar as well, I think it was a bit much. Otherwise it's excellent."
"2","4","I have made this twice. First exactly the way the recipe states and it came out perfect. BUT the crescent rolls just taste fake. So I made the second recipe altering two things. Instead of crescent rolls I used pie crust and I used brown sugar instead of white. Mmmm excellent. Thank you for the recipe!"
"2","5","HEAVEN!!!! Rich, Sweet, Sour, Crusty, Salty, Soft all at the same time. Made my eyes roll back in my head. Made my mouth water for hours after. This is one of the quickest, tastiest recipes i have found in a long time. Max 10 min prep. 35 min cook time. A scoop of vanilla ice cream. Drizzle the hot syrup from the pan over the ice cream and there ya go. Used fresh cooking apples from the front yard. Can't wait to make it again."
"2","4","I used the recipe as a template. The Mountain Dew was replaced with cane sugar sweetened lemon/lime soda from Whole Foods. The crescent roll dough was replaced with Trader Joe's crescent roll dough -- which is made without the preservatives and transfats. I cut back on the butter by 50% and used 1/2 cup butter. I used only 1 cup of sugar. This is a fantastic recipe which allows for minor changes. This recipe is also great with light brown sugar. Try this with cranberries added in along with the apple slices - WOW!!"
"2","5","SO EASY! My son saw this recipe advertised on his favorite dessert recipe and wanted to make this. I was a bit skeptical. This is such an easy recipe for the kids to make. I will likely play with the sauce next time, just to cut some calories and fat... We made half the recipes. We put an extra apple in between the crescent wrapped apples. There is so much sauce, we could have cut up a third."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe! Great one to have the kids or grandkids 'help' by rolling the apple slices in the dough. Made this for a football party and everyone loved it. Even the chocolaholic said it was delicious and he usually says that dessert is not worthwhile without chocolate! Just one alteration: I sprinkled on just a little course sugar in the last 5-10 minutes."
"2","5","I'm giving this 5 starts because I expected it to be sweet given the incredients and reviews. It was so hot and juicy, very yummy, but too sweet for me. Next time I will try cutting back the Mt. Dew and trying diet as someone else suggested. My teenagers loved it!"
"2","4","This came out really good. My bf and his family looked at me weird when I had the Mountain Dew out on the counter with the rest of the ingredients but, I assured them it was supposed to be good. Lol. Luckily, it worked out and we all thought it was delicious! Warm, rich, buttery, sweet, and just a little tart from the apples. It was even better when we paired it with cinnamon ice cream. Yum! I've made it twice already. The first time I used margarine instead of butter and I had way too much liquid in the pan but, the second time I used butter and it came out better. Still a little too much liquid though, maybe I'll use half of the sauce ingredients next time."
"2","5","I made this last night for 30 guests at the homeless shelter. Doubled the recipe and served warm in bowls with vanilla ice cream. The men loved it. This is a terrific recipe to make for a crowd, and I wouldn't hesitate to make it for a really large crowd as long as you have the oven space. Prep was really quick, only about 30 minutes for double recipe. The men at the homeless shelter are accustomed to having cookies for dessert, and a warm homemade dessert put smiles on their faces, especially since yesterday was our first cool fall day. Thank you for posting this recipe."
"2","5","only change was to sprinkle some cinnamon over the apple slices and I used cortland because that was what we picked at the orchard this weekend. Absolutely delicious!! A hit with everyone!"
"2","5","Wow this was amazing!! I followed the advice of others here and changed the sugar to 1c of white and 1/2c of brown sugar. I also made the apple wedges a bit bigger. I cooked the carmel mixture until it pulled away from sides of pan and then added the cinnamon and 1t. vanilla."
"2","5","Wow! These are great! After reading other reviews I made a few changes to try to make them a little healthier. Used 3 apples instead of two, only 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon. Rolled apple slices in cinnamon sugar mixture before wrapping them in cough then put the remaining cinnamon sugar mixture into the melted butter and poured it over the dumplings. Everyone LOVED them!!"
"2","5","Excellent! Nothing this easy should be this good."
"2","5","i cut down on the sugar since the mountain dew has so much too these are great i'm going to try with peaches"
"2","4","It was really good but if you didn't eat them right away they would stick to the plate."
"2","5","Wow! I feel like Paula Dean! So good and so easy. My husband and I love these dumplings."
"2","5","SOOOOO GOOOOOD. I now make these for any occasion where I need to bring a dessert. They are so simple to make, and so delicious! I substituted the Mountain Dew for ginger ale just because it's what I had on hand, and it was great. It might be a little scary when you pour all the liquid in--it looked like the dumplings would end up soggy. But everything kind of cooks down into a caramel-y sauce."
"2","5","Yum! The Mt. Dew kind of freaked me out, but I didn't taste it at all. I did like others suggested and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Also poured the Mt. Dew to the side rather than on top. Other than that, left everything the same. Mine came out crunchy on the top and soft on the bottom (like dumplings)! We enjoyed this so much. I served with vanilla ice cream, but honestly liked them better on their own. Next time I'll save my money and some of the calories and skip the ice cream!"
"2","4","This recipe was easy to make. I would make it again but maybe with a little less mountain dew or sugar to cut down on the sweetness."
"2","5","Wow. Wow. WOW. This is excellent with vanilla ice cream. My kids and husband enjoyed every scrumptious bite. I followed the recipe exactly. Nothing but rave reviews. I plan on making this for Father's Day even thought it seems more like a fall dessert."
"2","5","omgosh, this is awesome, i used pillsbury pie crust in place of the crecsent rolls taste more like the real thing. I cut the crust just like a pizza:)"
"2","5","YUM! I didn't make any changes to this. I just topped it with vanilla ice cream before serving."
"2","4","USE 1/2 BROWN 1/2 WHITE SUGAR. 1 STICK + 2PBS BUTTER. SPRINKLE APPLES WITH SUGAR CINNAMON BEFORE WRAPPING"
"2","5","Love, love, love these!!"
"2","5","What a wonderful, easy dish. Most definitely a crowd pleaser? Thanks!! And I did put my own little twist to the recipe"
"2","5","My neigbor gave me this recipe ...yummy! I made it with bananas and cream cheese. OMG to die for!"
"2","5","I cannot believe how delicious this is. I made it a day ahead and covered it in the refrigerator. Added mountain dew at the last minute and popped it in the oven when I served dinner. Topped with ice cream. Just goes to show you that the simple things can be the best!"
"2","5","these are amazing. DH said it was the best dessert I've ever made. I used brown sugar splenda mix and white splenda wtih reduced fat crescents. Only had diet ginger ale. Can't imagine what they would taste like full fat and sugar. I woke up this am thinking about them and had one cold for breakfast! Going to have to give the rest away before I eat them all!"
"2","5","I used less butter and diet Mountain Dew, and this was DELICIOUS!"
"2","5","I made these the other night for dessert and they were sooooo delicious that I ate some for breakfast the next morning! I couldn't stop eating them. Luckily, I only made 1/2 the recipe or I would have been in trouble. Definitely planning to make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","Made this for the family since I don't like apple desserts to keep me out of it...didn't work...fell in love with this dish!"
"2","5","Very good if you use fresh peaches instead of apples as well. Both are delicious"
"2","5","This is delicious but after making it as written, I decided to try it with some advice from the other viewers and it made it even better. Cook the sugar with the butter until it's dissolved and starts to thicken and then add you cinnamon (I used 1 1/2 tsp.) and add 1 tsp. of vanilla. The vanilla is a wonderful addition. Thanks for the 'so very easy and delicious' recipe!!"
"2","5","My goodness this was SO good! The mountain dew is werid, but it's a must. It almost gives the butter mixture a caramel taste. Don't skip that step."
"2","4","I just made this. The recipe and instructions are good but there were some things that were not to my taste. First off I thought they were WAY too sweet. With adding Mountain Dew I don't think all that sugar is necessary but that's just my preference. I will try this again sometime I will add less sugar and less mountain dew next time."
"2","5","Very good and easy! I halved the recipe and used part brown sugar and sugar and I used Sprite. Great with vanilla ice cream. This one's a keeper."
"2","4","I was skeptical of the mountain dew but it was delicious. The only change I would make would be to add less sugar."
"2","3","Tasty! Quick to make! However, next time I make them I will not use the soda. I just don't see a need for it. I also cut back on the sugar...used both white & brown, but cut back by 1/2 called for and it was plenty sweet...and I have a huge sweet tooth!"
"2","5","The only thing I changed was 2/3 brown sug/1/3 white. Added some nutmeg. This was fantastic. Made a 1/2 recipe and it cooked much faster, about 20 min."
"2","5","Awesome! I tweaked the recipe a little by adding some vanilla and substituting 1/2 cup of the sugar for brown sugar instead of all white."
"2","5","I used this recipe for our apple bake off --- it won first prize. I did as other suggested with the sugar (use half white sugar and half brown sugar). I also removed them from the baking dish when I removed them from the oven so that they did not get soggy! My kids love rolling them and the family is always asking for me to bring them to gatherings! GREAT RECIPE!!!"
"2","5","OMG!"
"2","5","Holy moly these were so good!!! I'm so glad I took them to a family get together and shared otherwise I would've been tempted to eat the whole pan myself!!! Everyone agreed these were awesome! I have kids so I put the apples in the food processor and added a little cinnamon/sugar/vanilla to that then made the rest according to the recipe."
"2","5","so easy to make! I made half of the recipe with 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar. Definitely soft and soggy on the bottom, but it's so good. next time i'll add vanilla like other reviewers suggested, and I definitely did not find these to be too sweet at all."
"2","5","Much better than I thought they would be!"
"2","5","I prepared for my Sunday family dinner today. My son and grandson ate with us. I did the variation with 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Used ginger ale instead of Mt. Dew. Very large Granny Smith apples. This was excellent. I would like to try Stevia as a sugar substitute, but I don't use Splenda or any other sugar substitutes so if any Stevia users our there that have a successful substitute please let me know. My family raved. So quick and easy."
"2","5","these are very good. the dough is dairy free and i used dairy free butter but other than that i did it exactly as written. you could use a diet soda to reduce sugar content as others have mentioned. i would recommend this recipe."
"2","3","I'm giving this three stars because even though they were good, this recipe needs a lot of changes for it to be great. I halved the recipe and only used 1/4cup butter and half a cup of brown sugar (which was plenty!!). I also used diet mountain dew and reduced fat crescent rolls. I tried a dumpling as soon as I took the pan from the oven and it was just sitting in liquid, which made it really soggy... the kind of soggy that makes you wonder if its actually cooked. So I put the rest of the dumplings back in the oven @ 400 degrees until the liquid bubbled for a few minutes and then I let them sit for about 10 minutes before I served them which gave the liquid time to set up and get absorbed by the crescent rolls & they were pretty good with whipped cream. Next time I make these (there will def be a next time, they're too easy to give up on!) Ill let my butter and sugar mixture thicken on the stove before I pour it over the rolls and ill bake it at 400 degrees instead of 350. I may add chopped pecans next time too."
"2","5","Can't say enough. Just made these and ran straight to the computer to rate this! You definitely don't need a full cup of butter and all that sugar. I would cut the butter and sugar mixture in half or down to 3/4 cup next time. I used brown sugar instead of white (personal preference). Cut your apple nice and thick or it will get lost in the dough. The quantities were exact on this otherwise and the Mountain Dew really creates a nice crust on top. Served hot out of the oven with a whipped cream recipe I also got from AR....DEVINE!"
"2","5","WOW!!! These are amazing! So simple and delicious. Will definitely make again....over and over. The only thing I would change next time is to possibly cut the apples into quarters instead of eighths. My apples were on the medium side and we would have liked a bit more on the inside of the dumpling. Thank you so much for the great recipe!"
"2","5","Tastes like fair food."
"2","5","These were AWESOME! I did tweek it a little though. I only wanted to make enough for my family of 4 to have for dessert, so I halved the recipe and since I only had small apples, I quartered them for the 8 dumplings. TI worked out perfectly! So easy and SOOOOO GOOD!"
"2","5","I served this treat with some vanilla ice cream. It was heavenly!!! My husband and I were laughing as we were eating... it was that good!!! The best part, it was quick and easy!!!! Bon Appetit!!!"
"2","5","Oh. My. God. As if this recipe needs one more review, I am writing one anyway. There are so many I haven't read them all to see if others did this, but the changes I will try next time will be half the butter, half the sugar (I used 50/50 white and brown) half the Mtn. Dew, and reduced fat crescents. I'll let you all know how it goes! I can't imagine they wouldn't still be amazing, and there will be less excess liquid in the pan after baking. Also, the only apples I had on hand were honeycrisp and though they are a bit expensive, they were great in this recipe as well!"
"2","5","this is an absolute 5 star recipe. I put my apple slices in a little lemon water so they would stay crisp and bright, then dried them off and rolled away! sooooo yummy!!! and easy!"
"2","5","WOW! Wonderful recipe. So easy and so delicious. I had to eat them cold because I was so busy, but I think they would be even more wonderful warm with some vanilla ice cream. UMMMM! Thanks for a great recipe. Only thing I did different, was that I sprinkled a cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar mixture on dough triangles before placing the apple wedge on them, then rolled them up and proceeded as directed. I don't know if it made much of a difference. The recipe is terrific as is."
"2","4","These were good, but SO rich (I even cut the sugar down to 1cup and the Mt Dew down to 8oz). I think next time I will try rolling out the dough a little bit so that I can fill each dumpling with more apple, cut back the butter to 3/4cup, and the sugar to 3/4cup."
"2","5","Yummy! I halved the recipe, just so we could try them and boy am i regretting that now! Being diabetic, I used Splenda instead of sugar.The only other changes was adding a splash of vanilla. We will definitely be making this again!"
"2","4","i love the taste, but the bottom was soggy and mushy. it was still good. i don't like the fact that they sit in mountain dew while they cook, making them mushy."
"2","5","A-MAZ-ING! You MUST try this recipe. It's always a major hit!!! I buy three apples and cut them into six for larger portions."
"2","5","Everyone loved this! I cannot believe how easy and delicious. I didn't change a thing and used real butter (vs. margarine). Thank you!!!!"
"2","5","AMAZING!! I was a little unsure about the mountain dew, but it was incredible!! I brought it to work for a potluck, and my dish was BY FAR the most desired. Not that the others weren't great... :) I'll be making this SUPER easy dish for many potlucks to come."
"2","5","Got this recipe from my father-in-law. It's absolutely a crowd-pleaser and really simple to make. Definitely recommend this."
"2","4","I had high hopes for this dessert. It was good but there was a lot leftover."
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I used 1/2 cup less sugar and added some nutmeg, alspice, and a wee bit of ginger and it was heavenly! Rave reviews from the friends! Thank you so much for the great recipe!"
"2","4","REALLY sweet, the kids liked it."
"2","5","Wow! I'm very impressed with this recipe! My whole family LOVED it and had clean plates. The only thing I recommend is to make your own pastry dough. I know it is time consuming, but is SO totaly better than store bought dough! I will definately make this many times!"
"2","5","OMG, these were so good! They were a big hit! I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as suggested by others. Also instead of vanilla, I used french vanilla and a scoop of ice cream!!! YUMMY!!!"
"2","1","Waaaay too sweet for me and my husband!"
"2","5","It tastes like apple pie with more filling & less crust. so if you aren't too crazy about regular pie crust, this is for you. The first time I made it, people were asking me for the recipe. It was that good & that easy."
"2","5","I did half the white sugar and added brown sugar in its place. Made for my MIL's birthday desert. Everyone loved them, and it was so easy!"
"2","5","Oh, my goodness, so so good! Didn't change a thing and they turned out so well. Awesome warm with ice cream on top."
"2","5","Wow is all I can say! So easy and oh my goodness, these are awesome! The sauce that this makes that they bake in is unreal! The only thing I may do different next time is sprinkle cinnamon on the apples when I cut them before I put them in the crescents. But this recipe as is is more than 5 stars good!"
"2","5","DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! Will probably reduce sugar to 1 cup and maybe go half brown sugar. Delicious as it is. I also will probably have more apples in the pan between dumplings. Great as it is. Impressive too. Update: Made again with 3/4 c. butter and 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Also used Diet Mt. Dew. So simple and delish."
"2","5","This recipe seemed a little odd to me, as I have never used Mt Dew to bake, HOWEVER--- These are absolutely amazing!!! I chose not to peel the apples and they still turned out perfect. I would not use any other apple besides Granny Smith, bc it gives them just the right amount of tartiness. It sits and travels well. I even added a scoop of vanilla ice cream before serving. YUMMY :)"
"2","5","Most likely the best apple dessert I have ever made! Only thing I changed was to use brown sugar and white sugar combo per other reviews. Baked to perfection at 35 min. I will be making again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","Wow, I did question this recipe because of the mountain dew and that my best friend gave me 'the look' when I put it together. But all 3 of my kids, my husband, And my friend coulnd't put the spoon down. :) served over french vanilla icecream and drizzled with caramel. AMAZING!!!"
"2","5","Wow these are amazing, melt in your mouth..yummy!! 10 STARS!"
"2","3","Made the apples so mushy, not my favorite."
"2","5","Ok so after reading a bunch of these reviews, here is my take.... 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar,3/4 c. light butter, 1tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg boil until thickened. I also added a bit of lemon juice to cut the sugar. . The lemon juice I feel made a big difference. Before pouring this mixture over the dumplings add 3/4 tsp. of vanilla. I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon before wrapping them and I only used 6 oz. of diet mountain dew, pouring it around the dumplings not on top. AWESOME!"
"2","5","These dumplings are wonderful and so easy! Exactly what a country apple dumpling should taste like! I thought Mountain Dew sounded strange but follow the recipe exactly. Only thing I did slightly different was pour the Mountain Dew around the dumplings so that I didn't make the sugar/cinnamon wash off the top of the dumplings. That may not make a difference by the end but that crust was so good! Definite keeper. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","These are amazing and I don't even really like apples :) Everyone wanted the recipe and they were so easy, thanks!"
"2","5","After reading other reviews, I only added 1 cup of sugar into the butter. I also added a 1/2tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of sugar and tossed it into the apples. Came out FANTASTIC! A Keeper!"
"2","5","My son says 'Extremely, Amazing!' My whole family enjoyed these! This is going to be on the Thanksgiving table with my cola ham! These end up being the perfect size serving, it's about as much as half a piece of pie. It's soft on the bottom and flaky on the top, the apple inside turns into this wonderful pure apple pie filling that you can cut through with a spoon. I used only half the butter, it was perfect! My son and I had so much fun making these, I can't wait to share the recipe."
"2","3","These are just ok. I made twice in two days because my daughter loved them. First time I used sugar, splenda, and splenda brown sugar because I ran out of sugar. And I used Mountain Dew. The second time I used all sugar and Sprite. The first batch with the mixtures of sugars was way better. I think it was the flavor of the brown sugar that made it better. Also, both batches I only used 1 stick of butter. 2 seemed to me like an awful lot. These are good fresh out of the oven, warm...but actually kind of gross after they cool the next day. They get very soggy."
"2","5","My son and I made these the other night and enjoyed them very much! We cut the sugar and butter down, and used a little more of the (CallofDuty cherry citrus) Mtn Dew so they were a rather vivid orange color but they were marvelous. We can't decide if we liked them better hot fresh and crunchy or leftover the next day when the sauce thickened up and the dough soaked up the buttery sugary goodness. Yep, we'll make these again! Thanks for sharing this tasty treat!"
"2","5","I love these ,they taste like camping with my grandparents."
"2","5","This was fantastic. Almost too easy for the great taste. My husband and I loved it and have already made it twice. Substituted splenda for sugar second time, don't recommend substituting, clumped and dumplings were too dry. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","4","Even though I made a little mistake, these are very good dumplings! My silly mistake was using 2 crescent dough triangles per dumpling..which yielded 8 instead of 16 lol. But despite this, they still came out great and I was pleased with the results.   I love ALL types of sweets and desserts so my intentions were not to alter this recipe in any way to cut back on fat, sugar, etc..BUT I must say these are a bit too sweet for me which is rare for me to say regarding desserts. I will be making these again the proper way but I will definitely find a way to cut back on the sugar just a little..they are very very sweet but delicious!"
"2","4","Really good!"
"2","5","HELLO, delicious! These are get-in-my-belly good. They certainly call for a lot of butter but, I followed the recipe and don't have any regrets. If you 'are what you eat', I will soon be an apple dumpling."
"2","5","These are so amazingly delicious. I wish I could give them 10 stars! You won't be disappointed."
"2","5","Super simple to make and tasted great! What a nice quick way to make something so tasty and satisfying with apples. I did cut down a bit on the calories by using diet soda, low fat crescent rolls and a little less sugar and it was great!"
"2","4","OK, tried this recipe, BUT, I only used 1 c. of sugar instead of the 1 1/2. That would be waaaaay too much. I cooked the butter, cinnamon & sugar until it thickened up a bit. I also only used 1c. of Mountain Dew, that was plenty. Don't know why it calls for soda at all, you can't taste it. You could probably use just water....or O.J., apple juice. All in all, it was good, nothing spectacular. I would prefer an apple crisp instead. I thought it would be special with the crescent rolls, but no, not really. I gave it 4 stars because it's too sweet."
"2","5","AMAZING.... I made these yesterday after picking a bushel of apples from a nearby orchard and my husband is asking me to make some more today AFTER I make some for my mother in law! I made it just as the recipe stated except I had to use Diet SunDrop soda since that is all I had on hand...."
"2","5","Big hit! Substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar, added a splash of vanilla after the sugar boiled good, and used some Schweppes ginger ale since we didn't have any mountain dew on hand."
"2","1","this came out like a goey non-palatable mess, not sure what happened but wont try again, bummer!"
"2","5","How could anything be easier or tastier? Everyone asked for the recipe. Only thing I did was to do 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and add a teaspoon of vanilla. Thank you for a 'keeper'!"
"2","5","So easy and delicious. It seems like a lot of liquid when you put it all in the pan (I was a little worried) but it turned out wonderfully!"
"2","5","I just made these and it is soooooo GOOD! I was running out of ways to use up the 25+ lbs of apples from picking, but I am so glad I found this one. I reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also used 1/2 cup of butter and 1.5 tsp of cinnamon. This is super fast and easy. I will try freezing the leftovers for breakfast on the go...."
"2","5","This is one my go-to recipes when we need to bring dessert somewhere. Shared many times over with family and friends."
"2","5","Very good! I was a bit hesitant about adding the Mountain Dew, but made a delicious caramel sauce. I also halved the recipe because there are just 2 of us."
"2","5","Simple stellar! I was a bit nervous about it because of the Mt. Dew, but WOW!!! I made them to surprise my grandma with something nice, and I was in turn surprised by their delectable-ness! Simple amazing! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"2","5","Amazing, theses are so good...we each ate 3! half way through cooking, i spooned up the liquid and poured it over the dumplings. This was amazing!"
"2","5","Apples are tender and everyone enjoyed them. I decided to use 1C sugar and 1/2C of brown sugar."
"2","5","This dish is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I made it tonight for my family and everyone went back for seconds! I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I wouldn't change a thing. The dumplings came out WONDERFUL; crispy on top and dumpling-like on the bottom. I will DEFINITELY be making this again and again!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! This is definitely a new favorite in my household. This was extremely simple to make and I followed the recipe exactly. Well, I did halve the portions to make only 8 dumplings."
"2","5","Awesome! I just made these for a Labor Day cookout this past weekend. They were easy, incredible, and will definitely be added to my list of favorites. Just make sure not to serve these to children if you would like them to sleep anytime in the following 3-4 hours after consumption."
"2","5","This recipe ruined my diet - one taste and I couldn't stop!! I would find myself thinking about these little things during the day - They are THAT good.   I didn't have Mountain Dew so I exchanged it for 7Up - Delicious!"
"2","5","FABULOUS!!! I took the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and decreased the butter to 1 stick plus 2 tbsp and 1/2 can of the soda. These are the best!"
"2","5","Really amazing! So easy and quick! Maybe a little on the sweet side for some taste but that can be adjusted. My family requests these on a regular basis :)"
"2","5","These little beauties are delicious and so easy to make. My family loved them! We ate them with vanilla ice cream! YUM!"
"2","4","very good....didn't last long"
"2","5","ooooh myyyyy gooodness! these were fantastic! i did follow one review and put 3/4 white and 1/4 brown sugar and then i didn't put in the cinnamon (i just forgot!) and they were soooo gooood! i really can't emphasize it enough how delicious these ended up being!"
"2","5","OMG - OUTSTANDING!! Yummy and EASY to make....it got 5 stars from 4 teenage boys!"
"2","5","I saw this dish and followed it exactly... it was great!!!! my family loved this!!!! Quick and easy ...thanks for sharing"
"2","1","Followed the recipe with no alterations. Way too sweet and a bad aftertaste."
"2","5","Oh my! I can't wait to make these again. And to make them with peaches. And rhubarb. I will reduce the sugar to one cup next time. I inadvertently bought biscuit dough instead of crescent rolls, but they turned out great anyway. I ate them plain and my husband enjoyed them with vanilla ice cream. A definite keeper!"
"2","5","It was DELICIOUS!! I am not a fan of fake sugars so instead of mountain dew i used apple juice in it's place... i also rolled the apple in cinnamon and sugar before wrapping them, but they are amazing! I should have waited until AFTER dinner to make these... ;)"
"2","5","So simple and so delicious! I made this for a family cookout and got rave reviews! The only thing that would have made it better would have been to serve it a' la mode!"
"2","5","Oh Mylanta! This recipe is soooooo delish and SO easy! It HAS to be one of my favorite desserts, EVER. It's like gooey, buttery pillows of heavenly goodness on your tastebuds. The only thing I changed was added a bit of vanilla to the butter mixture. You have GOT to try this recipe!"
"2","4","Wow! Very rich. I made the recipe exactly as stated, but the dish sat for a few hours until serving time. They lost the crispy top :( But, they were still pretty good. Next time I will bake closer to serving time."
"2","5","Uhm...my jaw dropped as soon as I sunk my teeth into this amazing dish brought down by the Heavens."
"2","5","This was a wow dessert served over Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. My kids loved it. I even surprised my hubby and my son with this as well. Neither are a cooked apple type of fellas, and both Were in heaven. Which was totally awesome to say. I have had others tell me of spin off's of this recipe on facebook when I told them I was making it. And thanks to xraybarb(= for recommending this recipe to me. It is a totally keeper. I didn't change anything. But I soo could when it comes to reduced fat products and sugar free replacements. But I totally would add a little more cinnamon because we love love cinnamon. But as is...it's really really good!!"
"2","5","This is an outstanding, quick and easy recipe. I tend to have all the ingredients on hand (except the Mountain Dew, but that's solved with a quick run to the corner 7/11) and can throw this together with short notice. I use the reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/2 the butter and brown sugar instead of granulated white. Also, I usually sprinkle the apples with a little Splenda and cinnamon before rolling them up. I've substituted fresh peaches for the apples and they turned out spectacular as well. Great recipe!!! Thanks!!!"
"2","5","Oh wow! These are so good and so easy. I am diabetic and unfortunately love sweets. I used splenda and it turned out wonderful. I could have eaten the whole pan by myself!"
"2","5","Excellent!! Definitely add the tsp of vanilla. I also used 7UP in place of Mountain Dew and added 1/2 tsp extra of cinnamon. Good stuff!"
"2","5","My father's friend made these and I just had to scour this website to find the recipe! I'm so glad, as these are like delicious bundles of heaven. Do not substitute the Mountain Dew for any other soda, however."
"2","5","These are great! Didn't make any changes. I would prefer them not to be so soggy, but that doesn't affect the taste. Everyone is so surprised to hear that one of the ingredients is Mountain Dew!"
"2","5","Simple and yummy! Of course you must serve warm with vanilla ice cream. I usually make half this recipe for my family, works out great."
"2","4","I thought this was fairly easy to make. I made it exactly as recipe stated, and it turned out beautiful, but was WAY too sweet! Next time I make it (yes, I'll make it again) I will cut sugar by at least half. My brother-in-law loved them!"
"2","5","WOW! I was very skeptical about this recipe. How could a recipe with these few ingredients be as good as everyone said? Well, it is! I am going to make this again and again. I always try the recipe the way it's written the first time. The only thing I might try different is a little lemon juice to balance the sugar. My picky daughter-in-law loved these too. I loved them warm, but my husband said they were even better the next day cold. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's the bomb!"
"2","4","These were good-- my hubby loved them, although I thought they were pretty buttery"
"2","5","Mmm Mmm Mmmm... Fabulous!! And so simple! I prepared the dish before dinner, popped it in the oven before we sat down to eat; it baked and I had time to clean up then served the dumplings with vanilla ice cream. It was a huge hit and for sure I'll do this again!"
"2","5","Let me start by saying I am a known Foodie and a long time Allrecipes member - Though this is the first review I have actually made. I went by the recipe exactly with the exception of only using 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Half way through cooking I added a little of apple crisp mix on top. It was amazing!! I usually love to bake and never eat anything I make. I ate two servings of this tonight. Not to mention how quick and easy it was to make! Wonderful for cooks of all levels!"
"2","5","This recipe has got to be one of my family's all-time favorites. It is quick and easy to make. I took this dish to a luncheon at church and needless to say I didn't have any leftovers to bring home! Several people also asked for the recipe so it's always fun to share recipes that are simple for working moms of the world. This dish will definitely go in my 'go to' file of delicious recipes!"
"2","5","Oh my! Can't believe how good this is..I'm home alone and may just eat them all myself! These are so good and so easy to make. I did half the recipe, and followed other suggestions to use part brown sugar and add vanilla...just wonderful..wish I could give it more than 5 stars."
"2","5","This recipe is amazing!! I made it for dessert last night and I'm still a beginner cook so I was nervous!! My boyfriend has had his step mom make these and couldn't think I could find a recipe that made them right using 7up but I did!!! The sauce is very good and would probably work for some home made cinnimin rolls too! The only difference was I used two apples (1 granny smith ; 1 gala apple) It was a tight squeeze but i put one slice of each type of apple in each. It was execelt. I think it was a great blend of a sweet apple and a sour one! NO LEFTOVERS   A+++++"
"2","5","Wow, wow, wow....I made it in no time....AND all I had was a little bit of 7-up and it worked with that too.....SO tasty."
"2","5","This is the most amazing dessert we have eaten, I have made it twice this week and loved it. I first used all white sugar and the second time I used half white and half brown sugar. Better with the brown sugar and needs more cinnamon. Still amazing. I love this better than apple pie and so easy to make."
"2","5","SO. DARN. GOOD. I had to restrain myself from eating half of the pan by myself. I want to make this for the next brunch type event I have to go to...though for dessert it's amazing with vanilla icecream alongside. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe."
"2","4","These are wonderful. And so easy. Great with ice cream !"
"2","5","I've used this recipe several times now and I've tried Sprite, Sierra Mist, and Mountain Dew. They DEFINITELY come out better with Mountain Dew! I get so many compliments on this recipe and many requests to bring it to functions that we attend."
"2","5","Fantastic!! Easy and absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe, and I even used Fresca, which is sugar free, and it came out perfect!!"
"2","5","THESE ARE SOOOOOOOO YUMMMMMMMMY!!!! Thank you, thank you and thank you, for sharing this recipe! I made them to the 'T' and my family can't stop talking about how amazingly delicious they are! These are fantastic! The best! BLUE RIBBON BEST!!!!!!!"
"2","4","This is simple and delicious! I halved the recipe and reduced the sugar and butter by 1/4 in the modified recipe....it was still plenty sweet and tasty! I also added 1tsp. of vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon, and pinch of all spice. The flavor was very good. Served it right of the oven with vanilla ice cream....yummy!"
"2","4","There are a lot of recipes on this site very similar to this one. Amounts of cinnamon, vanilla, etc. may change, and a couple others use crescent rolls others use biscuits, but they're all basically the same thing.  They're definitely easy, and pretty tasty. In my experience they weren't very good after the first day though. The dough got a little dry and crumbly. Despite this, my coworkers (who ate my leftovers the second day) have asked me several times to make them again."
"2","5","I made this for a potluck at work...they were huge hit! I had to give the recipe to everyone there!"
"2","4","Delish. A bit sweet...but yummy."
"2","2","These were okay. I was excited to try them because of the amazing reviews but they just weren't that great. I won't be making them again."
"2","5","So delicious and easy to prepare! My 7 year old made these for dessert with very little help from me."
"2","5","very easy to make and they are great, i've made it a few times, i cut back on the butter though"
"2","4","Very yummy on top. The ONLY thing is that the apple taste gets cooked out. My husband loved it and when I told him it was apple dumplings he said 'there's no apple in it' but I'll make it again because the tops were very donughty and crispy with baked on sugar! Maybe if there was more apple in the center the flavor would be better maintained?"
"2","5","I couldn't believe the ratings this got so I had to try it myself. Seriously ridiculously easy and ridiculously delicious. Deserved ten stars. I am a college student and this is a great dessert to make on a budget and it is a HUGE hit!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious- best surprisingly good recipe out there..."
"2","5","Beyond impressed!! I wasn't sure what to expect, but my family loved these!! I never would have thought to add so much liquid, but they came out golden brown and delicious!!"
"2","5","So easy for the beginner. Mine came out perfect! I halved the recipe. My kids think this is better than apple pie."
"2","5","This is literally the best treat that I have had! I did add apple pie spice and vanilla to the sauce! AMAZING!!!"
"2","5","Seriously one of the BEST desserts I've ever made!! It was definitely a crowd pleaser at my dinner party tonight. Followed recipe exactly!"
"2","4","this recipe is VERY fatty and i would recomend using half the butter and soda and you will still get practically the same result."
"2","5","This was a wonderful and easy desert. My hubby loved it. I made half the recipe, used 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, 4 oz mountain dew and it came out sweet. On the second day reheated it a warm oven that I had just baked lasagne in and it was just as good."
"2","5","So very good! Tips I found helpful: Definitely grease that pan, you don't want to leave one morsel of goodness stuck to this pan. The 'sauce' can be reduced to half and there was no taste difference in using diet soda. Did I say these were so very good? Everyone RAVED about these."
"2","5","A great big YUMMMMMMM!!! We absolutely loved these and they were so easy to make! I halved the recipe, but didn't change anything else and they came out perfect. I served them warm with vanilla ice cream.... OMG, to die for!!! :)"
"2","5","We did a twist on this. We did not have crescent rolls, but had biscuits. My son rolled out the biscuits and then we put in the apple and rolled it up to seal. No soda in the house, so we skipped that step and halved the butter/sugar/cinnamon. Pour it over the top and baked about 17-20 minutes. YUM!"
"2","5","I made these and they are as good as everyone said. I cut sugar to 3/4 cup and butter to 1 stick. I used the half splenda/half sugar mixture and diet Mountain Dew. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put dumplings in oven without sugar mixture or soda, baked them 12 minutes, took them out and added the sugar/butter mixture and the soda and put them back in the oven for the remaining time. They were not soggy at all - just delicious!"
"2","5","This is a simple recipe with ingredients most of us keep on hand. It has always been a pleaser for family and friends alike. Matched with whipped cream or vanilla icecream, it is unbeatable. Easy, inexpensive and always a pleaser."
"2","5","This was fantastic. My husband is normally a chocolate guy and he couldn't get enough of this recipe.It was great and we all loved it. The only thing that i changed was I used the butter crescents instead of the regular ones. Superb!"
"2","5","These were amazing. Easy to prepare and so yummy. I did take them immediately out of the pan to keep them from getting to soggy with the remaining juice. I poured the juice into a bowl and people were able to use that if they wanted more."
"2","5","so wonderful!!! i would try using less liquid next time! but still amazing"
"2","5","These were phenomenal. I made them for New Year's Eve and I was totally skeptical... The ingredients just seem so strange, but I would make these again in a heartbeat. Super easy with amazing results!"
"2","5","My husband said this is the best recipe I've made from this site to date!!!"
"2","5","These were so good!. My sister made them over Christmas, we used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew. They were creamy on the bottom and crunchy on top. Wow!"
"2","5","I used a little less butter and less sugar and it was still excellent! My husband says this is the best dessert ever made. I would have to agree."
"2","5","Just made this for Christmas breakfast. Yum! Easy, keeper for sure! I also only used 1 cup of sugar and 1 stick of butter. Perfect!"
"2","5","These are wonderful! I made the following changes; a teaspoon of vanilla and much less sugar b/c they were VERY sweet. I would use about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of sugar. I also used only about 8 oz of Mt Dew. Super YUMMY!"
"2","5","This dish was fantastic. Easy to make for a novice like me and got great reviews from whoever tasted it. There are many reviews complaining that the bottoms were mushy. These dumplings are halfway submerged in liquid the entire time they're cooking, so expect that the bottoms of the dumplings are not going to be crisp like the tops."
"2","5","Even with the reviews I was not sure that I was going to like this. Not a mountain dew fan, but followed the recipe. These were amazing, and didn't last long!!!! Will try sprite next time, try to stay away from the caffeine. Probably will try less sugar too, really don't think they need this much sugar, but a personal preference."
"2","5","These are beyond delicious!! Have made twice already! First try - used coke since that's all I had; still delicious! Second try - used Pie dough instead of Crescent Roll dough - not as good. Used Cherry Chocolate coke - good but I'll stick with the orig recipe! Thanks to whoever shared this origionally!"
"2","5","This recipe is so simple and SO yummy. Everywhere I bring this, people rave about it!! One thing to remember is that it is not so good the next day. It gets soggy. But the day you cook it-YUMMY!!!!!! Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you'll be in apple dumpling heaven!! Thanks for this recipe!!!"
"2","5","The first time I made these, the kids (4 teenagers) were skeptical, because of the mountain dew. It was wonderful, they loved them and ate them all in less than 15 minutes. They were so fast and easy to make. I thought they were a little to sweet for me and so the second time I made them, I used reduced fat crescents, 1/2 the butter and half the sugar, added a little vanilla and used the same amount of mountain dew. They were still incredible:)"
"2","5","You can even use Diet Soda, as well."
"2","5","5 stars is not nearly enough! It's not often that something simple to prepare is so good. Didn't have Mountain Dew so I used diet 7-up. Think next time I'll try orange juice."
"2","4","I reduced the sugar and butter by about 1/3 and used reduced fat cresent rolls and this was still plenty sweet and very good."
"2","5","All I can say is WOW!!!! This was so easy and was so good! Who thought of this?"
"2","5","Very good, but..not so good for you! Will make again, but will limit how often i make them. Ice cream is a must for these!"
"2","5","OMG...this is SOOOOO good. I am not a big sweets person and really never eat dessert, but even I can't resist this. Thank you so much for sharing, it is awesome!!!(Have made it 3 times in one week for family)"
"2","5","OMG!!! These are fantastic. I admit that I had my doubts even after reading all of the other reviews (due mainly to the Mountain Dew ingredient), but there are no adequete words to say how delicious these are. I actually burned my mouth on them cause I couldn't wait for them to cool properly before eating them!"
"2","5","My sister in law lives in northern Indiana and is the greatest cook! While visiting her last summer, she made this for us. OMG!!! This is the best! I couldn't wait to get the recipe and make it at home. To the other readers, tweak it anyway you want to. It's delicious and I don't think it can be ruined whatever you do to it... It's a winner!!!!! 5 plus stars!!!!"
"2","5","Delicious!! My husband was shocked that the 'secret ingredient' was a can of his favorite pop. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and added a little nutmeg and about a teaspoon of vanilla. So yummy, definitely going to make these again!"
"2","5","These were so good! My husband was skeptical when I got the Mountain Dew out, but he ended up loving the outcome! The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and to add a splash of vanilla to the saucepan after everything was melted and combined. The best part is that they are so easy to make and I usually have all the ingredients on hand."
"2","5","I first made 4 dumplings just as directed. I did not like the overly sweet (to much sugar) and tin taste the mountain dew made. So I reduced the sugar to (1/4c) brown sugar, butter to 1 stick and omitted the mountain dew. I also did not soak the dumplings in the butter mixture, while cooking . I brushed them 3 times with the butter mixture instead. Oh and I reduce the cooking time to 15-18 minutes. Because the first attempt the apples were mushy like applesauce. The new modified ones were the hit of the party. Crunchy and just sweet enough. Everyone Preferred them over the bakery made gouache cake at the party. Good Stuff ! Less is more!"
"2","4","Not bad for a quick and simple dessert. They keep well, and I enjoyed the flavor."
"2","5","Another hit! I have no idea what the the mountain dew did, if anything but I won't risk not using it again because they were so crisp and delicious. I couldn't fit all 16 apples slices in there, I think I wound up making 14, but my apples may have been too big. It was still plenty though."
"2","5","We LOVE these at our house! They are so good, easy, and inexpensive. My friends and I just did a big recipe exchange and this is the one I used. My Suggestions: -Use half brown sugar half white…mmm! -Use thicker pieces of apple (6 pcs per apple rather than 8) -I leave the skin on the apples. Family pref. -Eat them with Vanilla Bean ice cream and drizzle the extra sauce over the ice cream. -Double the batch because one is not enough!"
"2","5","AWESOME!!!! This was a really easy recipe to follow. My 2 daughters and I made this one night after dinner, and I can't believe how good it really is!! This will be a regular part of our 'dessert mix'"
"2","5","This was awesome. My family loved it! The only change I would make is to add more cinnamon for added flavor. Will definitely make again, especially for the holidays!"
"2","5","So easy and delicious!! I only used 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1 cup sugar, and about 10 oz Mountain Dew. Also I made some with apples and some with blackberries. 35 minutes later, everyone was raving!! Next time I will use a bit less sugar as the dumplings were a tad bit too sweet. Still very yummy and simple... perfect for having company!"
"2","5","THE BEST YET!!!!! ~ TRY THIS RECIPE WITH PEACHES YUM~YUM"
"2","5","WOW these are so so good and so so easy to make! I was a little worried about the Mountain Dew but I followed this recipe to a T. They were even good the next day! Thank you for sharing!"
"2","5","Holy cow this is good! given: I've never had a read apple dumpling before but my sweet tooth really liked it! Used that real sugar Sierra Mist instead and took someone else's advice to use brown sugar for a third of the sugar and came out fantastic. My very full husband started to take it away from me after one bite. Suddenly there was room!"
"2","5","These were delicious! And so easy. My family absolutely loved them!"
"2","5","I made a half recipe and I was making dinner at the same time a put them in forgetting to add the sauce and soda for about 15 minutes... added them to the already brown dumplings and they were great! Not soggy at all,perfect!"
"2","5","Absolutely 5 stars; so very good! I only had brown sugar, but it worked well. Ginger ale is a nice change too."
"2","5","I did this recipe, I'm from Latinameria, and we are not just to do apple desserts. We dont have Mountain Dew so I changed it to Canada Dry and It was delicious !!! Thank you for share this recipe !! amazing flavor and easy to do !! Regards, Vivi"
"2","5","My husband can't stop eating them and he doesn't like sweets. I cut the recipe in 1/2 for just he and I and it is just the right amount. As far as sugar amount I use 1/2 cup with 1/4 cup brown sugar."
"2","5","I just made these to go with our breakfast and oh my god - they were so delicious! I don't know exactly how the mountain dew plays into the taste, but I think these are even BETTER than apple pie. Going to put this in regular rotation for sure."
"2","5","Loved it. Next time I'm going to cut back the sugar, just to see if it's still as good. It changes consistency when it's cold, but it's still great, just different!"
"2","5","Used butter crescent rolls and macintosh apples. The butter flavored rolls were a great choice! Macintosh apples turned out a little softer than I assume granny smiths would have, but they were still delicious!"
"2","5","Very good, will make again and again. Too much butter and sugar though. I'd go 3/4c and 1 cup sugar."
"2","4","Very good for such simple ingredients. I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also added some pumpkin pie spice mix that included clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc."
"2","5","Incredible, easy to make and amazingly tasty! It went together quickly. I was skeptic when I poured the Mountain Dew over the dough. My husband loved them! We used apples from our dwarf apple tree in the back yard! I think next time I might cut down a bit on the butter."
"2","5","I have made this once before and it was as good as I remember. My family loves it and it is even better the second day. This is a keeper."
"2","5","OHHH MY GOODNESS. Like everyone else has already said, these are AMAZINGLY delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and will probably cut back on the sugar and butter next time as they are crazy-sweet so you can only eat about 2 at once, but they are still soooo good! Enjoy it with a glass of milk!"
"2","5","The best EASY Apple Dumpling recipe. I recently ate out at a chain resturant who had apple dumplings on their menu and all I can say is this recipe blows that resturant out of the water!!! Best Ever and no alterations needed at all to the recipe. Anywhere you take this dish everyone goes crazy over it and when you tell them the secret ingredient is Mountain Dew they are even more interested in getting the recipe from you."
"2","5","I never get tired to share this recipe with my friends. It is amazingly easy. I usually cut down on the amount of butter and sugar. I used part white and part brown sugar as well."
"2","5","Sweet Goodness! I call this 'Better than apple pie dumplings.' Because, unlike pie, every bite of this has exactly what you want; tender apple, cinnamony sauce and flakey crust. My family flipped for this dessert. I cut the recipe in half and swapped the sugar for 1/4 C white sugar, 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C splenda. I also used diet Mt. Dew. So wonderful!"
"2","5","GREAT!!! These are the best apple dumplings I have ever eaten. I didn't have Mt. Dew so I used Sprite and it was delicious. The sauce is the best!! This has got to be the easiest and quickest recipe I have ever made to be sooooo good. I did cut down on the sugar a little."
"2","5","Wow! Super simple and so tasty! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, but left everything else the same. These were great right out of the oven, served with some vanilla ice cream!"
"2","5","What a delicious dessert! Very, very easy too. The suggestions about adding additional spice and reducing the sugar was a good tip! Mine were not as pretty as the picture but my family did not seem to mind a bit."
"2","5","Easy and delicious, what more could you want. Only change I make is replacing the Mountain Dew with apple juice. Just my preference as I never buy the Dew."
"2","4","These were very good. I did modify based on other reviews so that is the reason for only 4 stars. I only used 1/2 c butter and used 3/4 c brown and 1/4 c white sugar. Next time around I may use even less sugar. Also only used about 1/2 the can of Mountain Dew. I made some with Sprite too but think that the Mt. Dew gives it a better flavor. Regarding the modifications I made, I am so glad I did. It would have been too sweet and also greasy, and as it was, midway into the baking I took some of the liquid out because it was swimming in it, even with the reduced amounts that I used. In the end they weren't soggy, but soft, but I wasn't expecting a hard crust like a pie anyway so it was fine. I put 2 in a bowl and put 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and it turned out real well. Will definitely make again with some additional tweaking!"
"2","5","This recipe was so simple and soooo good that even the most picky eater in my house went to town on them. The first time I followed the recipe exactly but the taste of the Mountain Dew was too strong. I tried them with Sprite and they were 'wonderful'. I am definitely serving these for my next party. Thank You for a 'Great recipe!"
"2","5","These were amazing! Yes gooey and sticky and flavorful. Exactly what apple dumplings should be."
"2","5","OUNTSTANDING!"
"2","5","Made half the recipe. Cut the butter down from 1/2 cup by about 2 taplespoons. Used about 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, a little of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Very easy and very good with vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","Easy and so, so, so good! Made just as the recipie says...it's desert, don't eat every day and enjoy! Served warm with french vanilla ice cream and have even made for company...everyone loved it. Yummy!"
"2","5","Ab Fab! Made a half batch 'cause I only had one roll of crescents. They were awesome! Thanks so much, docswife! Now they're going into regular rotation!"
"2","5","This was a winner according to my family. My husband and kids asked when I'm making it again, right after their first bite. I made some sugar free for me at the same time substituting Splenda for the sugar and Diet Mountain Dew for regular and they turned out amazing."
"2","5","So yummy! Be careful not to add too much soda."
"2","5","Everyone should try this!!!! Very easy and really worth it."
"2","5","surprisingly delicious! A wonderful fast apple pie like treat!"
"2","5","Delicious! Paired with vanilla ice cream, this is the PERFECT dessert"
"2","5","Gosh... I don't even like apples, but wanted a recipe that 'apple lovers' would like, and something I could prepare without much fuss. I had a serving of this along with my family, and I must say that it was delicious. Next time I'll chop a few walnuts for the topping, and maybe add a splash of Calvados too!!!! Vanilla ice cream and these dumplings would please anyone...."
"2","5","This recipe was amazing. I would recommend this to anyone. It was easy and the Mountain Dew really makes a nice sauce and brings out a crisp brown color."
"2","5","If you've never made this, you're in for a treat! My boyfriend (who hates warm fruit) couldn't get enough!"
"2","5","This is great especially if you need a sugar free option. Change the soft drink to a diet and sugar to splenda and it's delicious."
"2","5","Wow, these are DEEE lish! I don't really care for apple pie, but I went back for seconds with these. Thanks Pam! Super Easy and they smell SO good cooking....will make these again and again and again."
"2","5","Absolutely a Keeper!!! They went FAST!!!"
"2","5","Very good for the taste buds, but may not be for my heart! I ran out of cresent rolls so I sub. for those flaky biscuits that I had already and it turned out just fine! :)"
"2","5","So simple, so good. Absolutely a keeper. I will make this often I know!"
"2","5","I usually don't go for recipes that involve pre-made ingredients (like the dough & soda) but these are amazing. Every time I make these people go crazy for them and ask for the recipe."
"2","5","The only change I make on this is to use 3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup dark brown sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla added to melted butter. Now there are crescent sheets and I'll try that next as it seems easier than the triangles. EXCELLENT!"
"2","5","Normally with all my substitutions I wouldn't rate a recipe. This turned out so good, I just had to say what I did that worked out anyways. I calculated this for 24 servings. Which meant 1 1/2 c. butter. I had no butter. I subbed about 1/3 c. of shortening and the rest was orange juice. Needed 2 1/4 c. white sugar, only had 1 3/4 c. So I added about 1 TBsp. molasses and 2 tsp. vanilla extract. I was afraid of it not being flavorful enough without the butter. I also tossed my apple slices in cinnamon and sugar before wrapping them in the dough. And finally, I used almost a whole can of Sierra Mist because my hubby drank the last Mountain Dew. My daughter did most all the prep herself. These came out SO GOOD!! Even with all the subbing...so I had to review. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
"2","5","Spectacular. Soooo easy and delicious. Reminds me of apple strudel."
"2","5","I made this dish both ways, sugar free using Splenda and Diet Mountain Dew and the full on sugared version. I prefer the sugar free version as the other seemed almost too sweet for my taste, but my husband and friends LOVED it both ways! Next time I make the sugared recipe, I'll decrease the amount of sugar I use. It was really easy to make and quite inexpensive. This is a keeper! Thanks for posting it!"
"2","4","Oh, boy. These are ridiculously good. I would eat them all the time if I didn't know how fattening they are! I used only brown sugar because that's all I had in the house--will stick to that in the future because it was delicious. A little too sweet for my taste, so I'll cut back next time, but I have to say that these are wonderful. I'm going to experiment a bit to see if I can reduce the overall fat and remove the trans fats somehow (those crescent rolls are loaded)."
"2","5","If there were only the option of 10 stars this recipe would get them from me. I made these last night. Absolutely delicious. I a few to work and everyone was fighting over getting the last one. I had to promise to make them again next week. The only thing I would change is to reduce the butter to 1 stick and add a little more cinnamon. Other than that, they are perfect as written. Thanks docswife for this great recipe."
"2","5","I made this using Splenda and I had to make my own crescent dough, but it was worth it because they were delicious! My daughter and I really enjoyed them. My husband had some after dinner and he LOVED them. He asked where I bought them!! I didn't tell him I used Splenda until he ate them and he said he could eat them every day---huge compliment to the submitter of the recipe."
"2","5","These are fabulous. (I used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew and brown sugar instead of white sugar)"
"2","5","EVERYONE I have served this too has asked for this recipe! It is an absolute comfort desert. I cut the butter in half but did the rest just as it said. This will be added as a weekly 'gotta have desert tonight' recipe! SO EASY"
"2","5","Wow! Pretty darn yummy! I'm sure it would have been delicious the way the recipe is written but I always like to add my own to a recipe. I used a stick and a half of butter, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, added some nutmeg and vanilla. Didn't use but about a cup of the Mountain Dew. DELICIOUS!!! I tried one still warm and poured a tiny bit of evaporated milk on top. OMG! Very tasty and rich. It's now on the Thanksgiving dinner dessert menu! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","I agree with everyone else! Used baking Splenda and diet Mtn Dew to cut calories. Excellent and super easy!"
"2","4","Very good, but next time I think I would use pie crust dough as well."
"2","5","Wow--rare is the recipe that is truly easy and awesome at the same time. These dumplings pull it off. I made them exactly as the recipe says with two exceptions: added some vanilla and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. I used my favorite apples that I can only find at farmer's markets and apple farms: Mutsu (they're perfectly tangy but not tart like a Granny Smith--using Honeycrisp would be good too). These dumplings are really juicy when you first pull them from the oven but the sauce thickens up and ends up perfecto! They even reheat really well after time in the frig so don't be afraid to make the whole batch. Definitely company-worthy or perfect for just the family."
"2","5","OH MY GOSH!!! Excellent and super simple! I used the same suggestion as another reviewer and used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, cut down on the amount of butter, used diet dew and they turned out fabulous; my 6 year old just loved them! You could even use reduced fat crescent rolls too and I bet you wouldn't even know the difference. They tasted like a caramel roll. I think I will be making these as a dessert option for Thanksgiving."
"2","5","OMG, I cannot believe how good this recipe is! It is super simple to make and everyone I made this for loved it. The bag of apples I had weren't large so there wasn't quite enough apple in each one. I can't wait to make this again with with bigger apples. I just know that they will be perfect. :)"
"2","5","These were amazing! I can't wait to try them again! I am anxious to do some variations, (brown sugar, or even the 'diet' versions). Absolutly devine... and sooo easy! ***Ok, I have now made these several times, both just as written, and with Splenda Blend/Diet Mt. Dew, less butter... You cannot tell the difference!! I've also done it with 1/2 C brown sugar Spelnda Blend, and 1/2 C C White Splenda Blend, with wonderful results. This gives a rich caramel sauce. Seriously... these are to die for!"
"2","5","these were a big hit at work! I only used one cup of sugar and I made it half and half with brown and white sugar and I added nutmeg, vanilla and ginger to the melted butter and sugar. I was hesistant about the Mountain Dew but they were delicious. Will defintely add this one to the recipe box! Thanks for sharing. The biggest bonus was how easy they were to prepare. I'm going to experiment with different fillings, maybe ricotta cheese or canned pie filling...the possibilities seem endless!!"
"2","5","Amazing and easy. Made them sugar free with Splenda a little brown sugar and diet Mnt Dew. As others suggested I added some vanilla to the sugar mixture. Also used reduced fat crecent rolls. I will definately be making this over and over again."
"2","5","WOW!! I made many changes to lighten up the recipe and it worked well! I used reduced fat rolls and diet mt. dew. I halved the soda and butter and used 1/2 c. sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. Great with ice cream!!"
"2","5","I just made this dessert and it was absolutely FABULOOOUUUUSS!! Wow! And it was so easy to make! The only thing I did different was I used half brown sugar instead of all white sugar, used half margarine and half butter, and used 7 Up instead of Mountain Dew (because of the caffeine in Mountain Dew). This is definitely a keeper, and will be made over and over again. Thank you for a great recipe."
"2","5","This was incredibly inexpensive and easy! Perfect if you have a craving for apple pie or cobbler - the crescent roll dough is awesome after being baked in the glaze. I halfed the recipe in order to make 8 dumplings - Changes that I made: I used 1/3 cup of country crock instead of 1/2 cup of butter; and I used a little less white sugar (a little shy of 3/4 cup) and added about 1 Tbsp of brown sugar. Also, before I rolled the apples up, I splashed just a little lemon juice on them and a pinch of nutmeg. Boyfriend loves it! I will definately make these again, and next time I will make more and maybe experiment with other fruit such as pears or fresh peach."
"2","4","It was and is a good recipe,easy to make but I don't think that the next time I make them I will cook for 45 minutes,it seemed to come apart on me, I'll do less time next time."
"2","5","I saw this recipe this morning and knew immeidately it would be good. I'm the cook at a ladies' social club so I prepared it for their dessert today. There were no 'refusniks' and tHey nearly bum-rushed the kiitchen to find out how I did it! Dang! This is soooo easy and soooo good."
"2","5","O..M...G!!! made this sugar free and it was fabulous! I only used 1/2 cup regular Splenda plus 2 tsp Splenda brown sugar blend. Next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I'll cut the regular Splenda down even more. It was very sweet but not so much that we can't eat it :)"
"2","4","Super tasty - I made it with the adjustments that Joy listed - FYI Joy - according to my BodyBugg - it drops the calories to 280 and the fat down to 17g. So not a HUGE difference, but when you're counting calories - every one counts."
"2","5","Wow - these are so simple and absolutely delicious! My fiance loves these, and they are great hot out of the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","This is an excellent recipe and very simple and easy recipe. My grandson has made it at several family dinners and it was a hit everywhere. I have used it with 7up when I haven't had M.Dew and it is still wonderful."
"2","4","Simple quick to put together and they were wonderful with homemade ice cream!"
"2","4","i made them and and i added whipped cream to them and just about everyone want seconds"
"2","5","This was a HUGE hit in our home. This is the first time I tried Apple Dumplings and they came out perfect. I did use half white sugar half brown sugar and the sauce was delicious. Will be making as a regular dessert around here."
"2","5","My family said 'mmmmmm' after every single bite!"
"2","5","I was looking for an apple recipe to make for my daughter's 1st grade class. I decided I had better test it out first and it's a good thing I did! I can't imagine serving this oooey, gooey deliciousness to classroom full of rowdy 6 yr olds ;-) They were a little too messy for 1st graders but perfect for me! I'm afraid I'm allergic to them though... I can feel my butt swelling up with every yummy bite. My husband thought they were scrumptious and he took some to work so now I'm making multiple batches for their potluck dinner. Definitely a keeper."
"2","3","They were tasty but a bit soggy on the bottom."
"2","5","GREAT RECIPE - I would give it more stars if I could. This is so easy and what flavor. I used diet Mountain Dew. Can't wait to have company and make this agian. 10/31/09 Made these again today and as expected they were delicious. I served them with pumpkin ice cream. 3/7/10 Made them tonight, did not have Mountain Dew so I used Diet Sierra Mist, tasted just as good. 4/23/10 today when I made these I microwaved the butter for 30 secs. in a glass bowl until melted and then mixed in the sugar and cinnamon, much quicker than using a saucepan. Still my favorite dessert."
"2","5","Heaven's delight! I rolled the apples in cinnamon sugar. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and little over a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to butter and let thicken. I added a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon after sugar melted. I only used 1/4 can of mountain dew and poured partially over and around the dumplings. Served warm with icecream! Heavenly! I found the cracker barrel recipe and will use this recipe with their pecan streusal over the icecream. streusal:2/3 cup chopped toasted pecans, 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, 2/3 cup all purpose flour, 5 tbsp melted butter. Combine ingredients, mix with fork until it resembles moist crumbs. Can't wait to add the streusal!"
"2","5","These were yummy!!! I've made them twice; once with the original recipe and once with then 'low-fat' version, and my family couldn't tell the difference!! I've had several ask for this recipe!"
"2","5","These are delicious and the recipe needs no altering. Hard to believe they are crusty and not soggy."
"2","5","I've been making these for years and they are delicious, and so easy to do!! I highly recommend trying these warm with vanilla ice cream. YUM"
"2","5","these are extremely good and always a hit at any potluck dinner. I'm always asked for recipes. Even from the diabetics. Very simple to make and no clean-up if ya use disposable foil pans."
"2","5","Absolutely fantastic! To be honest, I tried to make this 'diet friendly' by using low-fat crescent rolls, splenda blend sugar, and diet soda... and I was expecting it to come out tasting icky.. but holy cow, it was so good! The diet went out the window and I ate 3 dumplings right away!"
"2","5","We did half this recipe, and it was simply perfect."
"2","5","Simple and taste wonderful. I could eat the whole pan : ) Thanks for the recipe!!!"
"2","5","Wow! WOW!! WOWWIE!! What an incredibly decadent taste explosion for your mouth! I followed the directions as is and before serving added a bit of whipped cream with a drizzle of butterscotch caramel"
"2","5","This was very easy to make and a hit at my Grandmothers birthday. It was a little too sweet so I think I will cut down on the sugar next time but, overall I was happy with the results."
"2","5","This is sinful! Everyone in my house gave this one a 'thumbs up', which is very unusual. I had it ready in about 5 minutes and it baked up in less than 30 in the convection oven. Thank you for this one - it's a keeper!"
"2","5","I vote these the best apple dumplings I've ever had. They just melt in your mouth. The girls loved helping me make them ' So simple'"
"2","5","Wonderful!!! I chose this dessert for Friday night's Easter celebration. I was actually planning to make this last weekend (my friends were supposed to come over for dinner, but their son got the flu so they didn't make it). Because I needed to use the apple I bought and my crescent roll dough was about to 'expire,' I decided to make this instead of the other dessert I had my eye on. Boy I am glad I did. This was the BOMB!!! Everyone RAVED about it. This is actually a pretty popular recipe - it is also featured in my Quick Cooking cookbook, but the ingredient proportions and preparation instructions are slightly different. Served warm out of the oven with vanilla bean ice cream made this TO DIE FOR. Thanks so much for sharing such a simple, yet impressive idea for apple dumplings :)"
"2","5","These were so easy. I read the reviews beforehand and decided on cutting out some of the liquid - they did not get soggy at all. Hubby said this was a keeper."
"2","5","This is a great recipe! It has a 'homemade' taste, even though it uses the storebought crescent rolls. Definitely a crowd-pleaser! I could eat the whole pan! I don't change a thing and they turn out great."
"2","3","It was 'okay' nothing quite like I have tasted, soggy on the bottom and crisp on top. Not my cup of tea, but overall very easy and quick"
"2","5","I didnt like the sound of mountain dew so I made 3 changes- I used 1 cup apple cider in place of the mountian dew- used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white- and used 2 tsps cinnamon. Rave reviews from all my food critics. Thanks for the original recipe-"
"2","4","This is probably a 4.5 star recipe, but I just can't punch it up to a five star! I had some left over puff pastry, so I used that and halved the recipe (with the exception of the spice and in that case I also used an apple pie spice mix given to me as a gift). I also only filled up the baking dish (a pie dish) to the top, which was only about a quarter of the soda, not a half. It turned out very well! Very delicious! I had to cook it a little longer (maybe the croissant dough bakes faster), but it turned out really well. I'll try a few others, but if I have some extra dough, I wouldn't hesitate to make this simple and yummy dessert!"
"2","4","Great recipe, gave it a 4 bc I made slight changes according to the reviews. I added vanilla/nutmeg to the sauce & I used ginger ale (didnt want to run to the store for a can of mt. dwew lol)& I poured the ginger ale 1st around the dumplings & then the butter sauce on top of them.I also chopped the apples & coated them w sugar/cinnamon.They smelled sooo good & tasted great!"
"2","5","Such an easy recipe! Due to a diabetic in the house I used Splenda (half white & half of the brown Splenda mix), low fat crescent rolls, diet Mtn Dew & we used sugar free Cool Whip as a topping. Hubby loves these - thanks!"
"2","5","AMAZING!! I too was skeptical about the MD soda, but this was EXCELLENT!!"
"2","5","One word: Trouble. You will definitely eat too many of these. These are so ridiculously good!! We have these at every family holiday party and have to give the recipe out each time. SO good with vanilla ice cream. We definitely cut back on the butter, and we generally use Diet Mountain Dew- works just fine. And we always top them with chopped pecans. This is one recipe you have to try!"
"2","5","One of the best recipes I've found on this site. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup plus 2T, and I also followed the suggestion to pour the Mountain Dew around the sides. In case you are wondering, this CAN be made in advance, refrigerated, and then reheated in the oven."
"2","5","* 5 STARS * this was so good:) i had to cut the recipe in half, cause i only had 1 can of crescent rolls at the time..but next time i make it, i will use 2 cans..all of it was gone by the time it even got cooled off:) can't wait to make & eat it again!!!"
"2","5","SO good! I love this recipe. Have made it several times, and have turned family and co-workers on to this and they all love it also.  UPDATE: Was craving this last night but didn't have Mt. Dew. Used juice from a jar of mandarin oranges instead. DELISH!"
"2","5","This is fantastic. The only changes I made was to use Splenda - both white and brown - instead of sugar and diet 7-Up because my husband is a diabetic. As others suggested cooked the butter/sugar mixture until it slightly thickened and sprinkled the apples with cinnamon before wrapping them. Oh, also sprinkled chopped pecans to the top before baking. Thanks for such an easy delicious recipe."
"2","5","This is awesome! I cook often for large groups and have made this a few times and it is always the first dessert to go and everyone loves it! I have had many ladies ask for the recipe. Don't change a thing in this recipe--it is perfect the way it is written!!! The only note I have when preparing is that mine ALWAYS takes a full 45 minutes to bake or it is too gooey! You won't be disappointed in this one!"
"2","5","I just loved this receipe..it sort of reminds me of what my grandma used to make when I was little girl. I added a few touches and took away a few. I hope this will help someone. I used a can of flaky biscuits instead of the crescent rolls. I rolled them out until they were the size of a small dessert plate. With only 1/2 cup of white sugar. A few dabs of vanilla flavor and the butter, I filled them with the apple mixture, about a tablespoon full, because the dough will not seal. I then formed the dough into turnover shape, sealing them with the forked edge. I then deep fried them instead of baking them, because they come out much more crunchy. Keep in mind the flame can not be more than medium because the sugar mixture will burn the outside while the dough isn't cooked in the middle. With the remainder of the butter, sugar and vanilla mixture, I spooned it over the vanilla ice cream. bon appetite."
"2","5","These were awesome! Next time I think I might add more apple in the middle. I also only used 3/4 cup sugar and lightly used Diet Mt. dew over top. The sweetness was perfect!"
"2","5","I loved this dessert! It's super easy to make and tastes fantastic. My only suggestions are 1 cup of sugar and half a can of Mt. Dew. This gave the dumplings just the right amount of sweet and the reduced liquid made the perfect amount and consistency of syrup."
"2","4","These were a hit! I did ajust the amout of sugar and butter. 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup butter. They turned out very yummy and had plenty of flavor & sweetness without the extra sugar & butter. I served them warm with vanilla ice cream & chopped nuts. Easy dessert!"
"2","4","Very good, thanks for the recipe! Easy to make, and actually tasted even better the nect day when I warmed them up in the microwave."
"2","5","these are fantastic! I made it for the first time for a New Years morning gathering... made me nervous at first to have SO much liquid in the pan but they are awesome!"
"2","5","Turned out FANTASTIC! I didn't have any citrus soda so I used Ginger ale. Had many requests for seconds and the recipe. Also, I cut the sugar to only 1 cup."
"2","4","good, quick dessert! thanks!!"
"2","5","Absolutely excellent! I made this for my mom and step father (the house food critic with a serious sweet tooth) and we all loved it. I converted the recipe to 20, and it was still very simple and fast. Mountain Dew- who would have thought?"
"2","5","I made this for my husband's birthday. It was easy to make and tasted great.His favorite dessert is apple dumplings and I think I've found a recipe that's simple to make yet tastes really good. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream."
"2","5","I am so impressed with this recipe. Simple, but elegant. My hat off to the cook! Want to look good at any function, make this. My presentation looks better than the photo shown. They fit snugly side by side in a colorful dish. Husband was shocked I did so well, even the second time. It is a no fail recipe."
"2","5","The BEST!!!! Absolutely delicious. This was a great hit with my family. A++++++"
"1","5","Unbelievable!!! So simple and the most delicious apple dessert ever !! I had it at a luncheon a friend hosted and everyone wanted the recipe including myself!! Couldn't wait to make it , and especially to eat it again!!!"
"1","5","Great tasting desert."
"1","4","This is a surprisingly good recipe. Except for using extra cinnamon and using diet pop and Splenda, I followed the recipe. The only problem I have is that I couldn't taste the apple much. Maybe I had too much pastry. My boyfriend thinks that it would be really good to add a little glaze on top when they come out of the oven. Sounds good to me. Thanks for sharing, docswife... I'll be making this again"
"1","5","We loved this and have made it twice-- easy, tasty way to make apple pie for desert even on a night you don't have much time. My family smells it cooking and comes out to the kitchen to see what's up!! Thanks for making a noncook look like I know what I am doing in the kitchen! I cut the recipe in half and only use one tube of crescent rolls. Plenty for a family of four with a small scoop of vanilla icecream placed on the side. Thank you."
"1","5","I tried the recipe but without the Mountain Dew and it tasted wonderful.. :)"
"1","5","I wasn't sure about this recipe when I saw the ingredients......but every one can't stop eating them. Really good recipe and very tasty....I serve with whipped cream no sugar added........don't be put off by ingredients and give it a try."
"1","5","Easy as can be and so good. According to Weight watchers it is a point per slice."
"1","5","My family loves this. But especially since I started using light brown sugar instead of white which adds a slight maple flavor and I use real butter. Also after I fix my butter and sugar to put on top, I add crushed pecans and that really makes it awesome!"
"1","5","Made these for a special dinner with good friends and we loved them! I took the advice of others and used 1 part brown sugar to 2 parts white sugar and cooked it until a little thick before pouring it over the bundles. (I think just white sugar would have been fine.) I also tossed the apple slices with cinnamon sugar and some nutmeg before wrapping them. YUM!"
"1","5","My husband begs me to make these every time we get apples from the store. After putting everything in the pan, I sprinkle a brown sugar and cinnamon mix on top. Just enough to give it a little crust. These never make it a week in my house without being eaten up."
"1","5","Made a half portion tonight! Super easy and happened to have everything on hand. :) Decided to make dessert on a whim, this is delicious!"
"1","5","This recipe deserves all its rave reviews! How simple and how delicious. I followed the advise of a fellow rater and halved the recipe and also used brown sugar and vanilla extract. I already had some ginger ale at home, so I figured I'd try that. Well, it worked beautifully! There's minimal prep time and the results are amazing!! I look forward to baking this dish for friends!"
"1","5","This is a great fall recipe. I altered this recipe a little....3/4 butter instead of 1 cup and exchange 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. I also added a little extra cinnamon. I used club soda instead of Mt. Dew (as I didn't want to run back to the store.) This recipe was so delicious! My 3 year old even rolled the crescent rolls an apples together! The recipe is fairly rich so one apple dumpling per person was plenty for us! I will definitely make this again!"
"1","4","Very easy! I left out 1/2 cup sugar and next time I make this I will try it with Coke for a more caramel flavor. Also I will use twice as many apples and only cut them in 1/4 instead of 1/8's."
"1","5","Totally AWESOME! ALL my family loves it!"
"1","5","This recipe is great. Instead of Mountain Dew, I used apple cider and some nutmeg.This recipe is a family favorite."
"1","5","To start with I tossed the apples in cinnamon/sugar to give them more flavor I reduced sugar to one cup and used brown and white sugar and only one cube of butter. I only used half a can of soda which I poured around the dumplings instead of over to avoid their getting soggy.  I brought them to a Ladies Luncheon today and the women all said they were amazing! This simple recipe is definitely a keeper."
"1","5","Excellent recipe!!! I put vanilla ice crem with it & oh my god, your in heaven. Deffinetly making this again. THANK YOU for sharing this.... Tim"
"1","5","OMGoodness perfect! A child could make these. The oohs and aaahs are neverending. And, none left so I won't be submitting a photo. Fabulous recipe."
"1","5","This was AMAZING as written and company worthy ! I used our guests as guinea pigs and everyone thought the dessert was delish! The recipe sounds kind of weird but we all giggled because it was really just so good. Will be making again! Oh and super quick and easy!"
"1","5","I love this recipe. Before I put the cinnamon sugar in the pan I toss the apples in it then I wrap the apples up."
"1","5","I dropped the 'F' bomb followed by the letter 'A' when I tasted these(way by myself); SO GOOD! But SWEET. I mean, really SWEET. I'll use something like SPLENDA as half of the sugar next time. I did use about 1/4 cup brown sugar instead all white and a drop of vanilla extract."
"1","5","I wrapped the apples with 2 or 3 raspberries. Yum!"
"1","5","Just had the first bite. Absolutely amazing! I only used 1 1/2 sticks butter, and Honeycrisp apples. I also put the apple slices in the sauce pan mixture of sugar, butter, and cinnamon so that the flavor went throughout the dough. I cooked it for 32 minutes, and they were golden brown. To make sure they weren't soggy on the bottom I poured the leftover sauce from the finished product into a bowl. This way people could pour the extra sauce on their own for extra flair. I then topped it off with some canned redi whip (though it doesn't need it!)  It's like eating miniature apple pies, and it's PERFECT for the fall! I cannot wait to share this with my family!"
"1","5","The recipe was EASY but the product was great!"
"1","5","-I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Thanks for the share!"
"1","5","AMAZING AND EASY"
"1","5","Very tasty. Will definitely cook again. Halved recipe and used brown and white sugar, rolled apples in sugar mixture prior to rolling in dough. Also used diet Mt. DEW......AWESOME. ..."
"1","5","These were amazing. I made no changes to the recipe or cooking instructions. Next time I will try with peaches...mmmm."
"1","4","great"
"1","5","Easy and delicious."
"1","5","Oh my goodness! This is great. I only used 1 cup sugar. I didn't have Mt Dew so I used cream soda. Spectacular!"
"1","4","Halve the butter and sugar and line the pan with foil for ease of cleanup. Yummy"
"1","5","This is the easiest dessert to make and the most superb 'Apple Dumplings I have ever had. When I was a kid my Mom would make her family's traditional recipe for apple dumplings - called 'apple grunt' and it was the worst tasting stuff any kid should ever have had to eat; which almost scared me away from this recipe.  My housemates and I had company for dinner and I made this recipe, with a few minor changes for dessert. It was the best darned apple dumplings my friends have ever had and I am going to send them a copy of the recipe with my edits, which I will post in my recipe box later. Bon Appetite my friends."
"1","5","Oh my goodness!! I just made these today after reading the reviews by others and I have to say, this is the best apple dessert my hubby and I have ever had! I'm not a baker, but love to cook and these are so easy, anyone can do this and be proud to share with family and friends. The only thing I'll do differently next time will be to peel the apple slices."
"1","5","I use1 cup sugar,1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cup mountain dew. I have played with this many times and it is very forgiving. I usually halve it so I won't eat so many and I prefer more apple in each. I have used low fat crescents and diet soda and it was fine. This is a keeper as you can make a small dessert with one apple if necessary and one crescent. It also works if the soda has gone flat"
"1","5","This is delicious and EVERYBODY likes it. My son-in-law asks me to make it every time they have dinner with us! I agree with others that there is a boat load of calories so I too made adjustments - and no one even noticed! I tend to think the apple wedge should be bigger than most apples yeild when you cut them in 8ths so I use 'chunks' that are about an inch and a half thick. SMaller chunks tend to disintegrate when baking leaving very little apple to taste! I use 1 and 1/3 sticks of butter and one cup of sugar AND I use diet Sundrop (cause that is my soda of choice for drinking, so I have it on hand)and I use 16 oz of the soda to make more sauce! I have found that 400 degrees browns the tops too much so I bake at 375 for 45-48 minutes and they are perfect. Not sure how many calories I save but any adjustment helps!"
"1","5","We use more fruit - 1/2 a small peach (our fave) or 1/4 a large apple), so you have to stretch the roll a bit, but the fruit doesn't have to be completely covered for this recipe to work. That gives it a little higher fruit-to-roll ratio, which we like. Also, any citrus soda works. Easy to make a half (or 1/4) recipe, so you don't eat everything all at once, which IS a SERIOUS temptation. Consider making 1/2 the can of crescent rolls for dinner and use the other half for dessert. YUM!"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful. Low cost , fast easy and beautiful. Perfect for a church social or even to take to someone special"
"1","5","These are absolutely delicious!! My family loved them. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla. I poured the mountain dew around the dumplings & not on top as I had read that others were saying they were soggy. They turned out perfect!!"
"1","5","Extremely good."
"1","1","I found it mushy and syrupy."
"1","5","This is a hit at every potluck. So easy and quick. I do double my apples when I make it."
"1","5","These by far were some of the easiest, tastiest treats I have ever made!"
"1","4","This was easy but I missed the flaky pastry. I'll stick with pie dough from now on."
"1","5","We made these last night, and I warmed one up with my coffee the next day."
"1","5","So very delicious. Served with vanilla bean ice cream on top. Excellent recipe and so easy to make. It's a MUST TRY!!"
"1","5","Don't forget to peel the apples! Truly awesome. Gooey, sticky, goodness!"
"1","5","WOW!"
"1","5","A great treat. Definitely best paired with Vanilla Ice Cream. I melted the butter and sugar for a few minutes and right before I took it off the heat I added teaspoon of vanilla. This was something I will make again."
"1","5","The family just loved these. My husband said not to change thing!!!"
"1","5","These are awesome! VERY hard to eat just one!"
"1","5","I love these! I also have made them many different ways: all brown sugar (works great), All splenda and diet mt dew (nobody noticed the difference!), reduced fat or not on crescent roll (tasty either way). The big difference I did notice is if you use non-brand name crescents they tend to be smaller and harder to wrap/close around the apple! (they rip easier) also not as puffy! (not a taste difference). We also took caramel sauce (Ice cream sauce) and put a drizzle on the crescent rolls before we wrapped/closed the aopple in them...YUMMY!!! I am going to try putting peanut butter in instead of the caramel this week! The only other thing I have done is use pumpkin pie spice and/or apple pie spice instead and/or with the ground cinnamon! will always be using all three!! About 1/2tsp each. depending on what you like, would not do any more then tbsp TOTAL. 3tsp=1tbsp It tends to get to be too much and lose the apple taste."
"1","5","M M M M M M!!! Super easy, super fast, and delicious! Tastes like a great apple pie. Made this for a group of men and they all wanted seconds! One said the best dessert they ever had! Would be absolute perfection with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side!"
"1","5","These are great. If you don't mind a few extra calories use the Pepperidge Farms Honey Flakey Croissants. They rise higher and are larger than the standard croissants. Super. You can also reduce the sugar and substitute a little maple syrup for a different taste. YUM!"
"1","5","I made these last night for a family event. I made 32 dumplings and all were gone with MANY compliments that it was the best thing there. People ate them with their dinner instead of waiting until dessert. I followed the recipe exact except for a couple small changes: I used 2 parts white sugar and 1 part brown sugar. I also did peel and sprinkle the apples with a little cinnamon and sugar before rolling them in the crescent roll. They were amazing and not soggy like some reviews stated. I will warn you that there is a lot of liquid in the pan when you take it out but that's normal and I took them from the oven and wrapped them up and we drove across town and served them about 1 hour after taking them from the oven and they tasted amazing and still not soggy (which I was worried about with them sitting for so long) I will absolutely be making these again!!!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe over and over again. Everytime I get rave reviews. Many of my co-workers request I made this and bring it in at least one a month. I just made three batches to bring to everyone for Christmas. The only change I made based on some other reviews is I use diet mountain dew to cut down on calories (also my in-laws brought some to my house by mistake one time, so this is a great way to use it up) and if I don't have cinnamon I use pumpkin pie spice. Either way with or without the changes it is delish everytime. Thank you docswife for submitting."
"1","5","It sounds bizzare, but this is the most delicious recipe for apple dumplings I have seen! Quick and easy. A crowd pleaser. I have made it twice for my family and it is a big hit. I may incorporate it into my catering menu as well!!"
"1","5","excellent and easy! this time I used 1/4 of a smallish macintosh apple in each crescent roll, mixed up the sugar and cinnamon and rolled each apple chunk in it before wrapping in the cresent roll, and decreased the sprite/soda to 8 ounces. the liquid that remains in the pan after cooking makes a lovely sauce for the dumplings! thanks again!!!!!"
"1","5","This has got to be the 'Best' recipe ever....I have made it several times for family and friends and my husband and son are always begging me to make it for them. Serve it warm with a scoop of 'homemade vanilla ice cream' and they will love it! It is so easy to make and to 'die for' yummy...you will love it!!!!"
"1","5","It is hard to describe exactly how amazing this recipe is, and the best part is that it's pretty much fool-proof. I made this recipe as written many times but have recently tweaked it a bit to my taste. As others suggested, I rolled the apple slices in the cinnamon and sugar before wrapping them in the crescent rolls. Also, I reduced the sugar a bit and made it 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar. Finally, I poured the melted butter mix over the dumplings, then poured the mountain dew around them -- this makes the bottom deliciously ooey-gooey and the top a wee bit crispy. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with the syrup drizzled on top, and you're guaranteed to have a crowd-pleaser!"
"1","5","I work at a hospital, and we made this recipe for our Joint Commission surveyors. It was such a hit! One of the doctors, a very subdued man who rarely compliments anything, declared that it was the best thing he had ever put in his mouth! After that, I made it for a pitch-in, and twice on Thanksgiving (2 different dinners), and each time, people have gone on and on about how great it is! Everyone wants the recipe, and they can't believe how easy it is! Honestly, if you knew what an awful cook I am, you'd understand how great this recipe is if even I can't screw it up! LOL! I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup (could probably still use less, it's very rich), sprinkled the cinnamon on top rather than mixing it in with the sugar/butter sauce, and I used an apple corer-slicer-peeler before I cut the apples into eighths (I'm way too lazy to slice, core, & peel apples by hand)."
"1","5","So easy, yet so good! I worried they might be too soggy based on some of the reviews, but that was not the case. We all loved it, including three picky children. I served them warm with ice cream. Perfect desert! I think this would be a great cooking opportunity to include my kids. They would love wrapping them in the crescent rolls. I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","HELP!! I just baked these beautiful dumplings but I don't plan to serve them until tomorrow. Do I leave them sitting in the pop and sugar/butter mixture in the cooking dish, or do I take them out so they don't get soggy? Please help!  PS They look amazing and I can't wait to sink my teeth into one!"
"1","5","This recipe was AWESOME!! Will definitely make again. Super easy. Serve with some vanilla ice cream- wow! All my kids loved it too ( ages 13,10,8). Keep recipe just as is"
"1","5","baked them yesterday, Good Grief Charlie Brown, are they ever yummy! Easy, quick and unbelievably so good. They rate a 10, thanks for sharing."
"1","5","I loved this recipe! However I just made a few changes, because it was very sweet, I cut down on the butter (1 1/2 cup) a bit and added sugar/cinnamon to the dough before I placed the apple in, used a little less sugar/cinnamon when I added it to the butter. Also used 1/4 bottle of cream soda to the top....it was GREAT!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! I increased this to 4 apples. After slicing them, I dipped them in some of the Dew and rolled them in a small amount of cinnamon & sugar. I then wrapped 2 slices in each triangle. This made a tight fit but well worth the extra apple flavor. I'd misread the butter as 1 stick rather than 1cup and cut that to 3/4 of a stick which I melted and mixed with 1/2 cup each of white and dark brown sugar and 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon. Poured this over the top and followed with only 3/4 cup of the Mountain Dew. The dumplings were beautifully browned at 35 minutes so I pulled them out. The bottoms of the dumplings were just starting to brown and were only slightly soft. Nice caramel/cinnamon/apple flavor. Husband said 'keep this recipe!' I think I will."
"1","5","A coworker shared this recipe with me several years ago. Since then it has become a family favorite. It's super easy and super delicious! In fact, my hubby has been craving this so I'm off to buy some crescent rolls. You can easily halve the butter and sugar and substitute lower-fat/sugar ingredients without negatively affecting the taste. I melt the butter in the baking pan, place the dumplings on top, sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mix on top, then pour the soda around the dumplings. Comes out perfect every time and the house smells HEAVENLY! So glad I was introduced to this recipe--it's a keeper for sure!"
"1","5","Amazing! Easy, inexpensive AND delicious! I used diet soda & Splenda & it was perfecto! Thanks for this great recipe!"
"1","5","We loved this recipe. I went to the mountains yesterday to get more apples so we could have it again. It was wonderful."
"1","4","This recipe won the National Boy Scout Dutchoven Cookoff a few years ago. Easy enough for any scout to assemble at a campout. Another Dutchoven recipe for Apple Dumplings is my favorite. It is a lot more intensive to make as you make a biscuit to put a whole apple in and molasses is used for the topping. This recipe with the crescent rolls and soda is very simple and good for simplicity sake. Hurray for the BSA Dutchoven Cookoffs."
"1","5","So yummy! I'm really glad I finally tried this recipe. I melted the butter in the microwave then mixed in the sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla. I used more cinnamon too, can't have too much when it's paired with apples!! Smells heavenly when baking and is awesome served with vanilla ice cream while still warm from the oven. FYI: I only had Sprite for the carbonated beverage so not sure how much of a difference that made, but I'm sure it's good either way."
"1","5","These were amazing, even my wife who doesn't like these type of treats thought they were great and made me promise to make them again soon. I made them exactly as directed, my only change was only making half the servings using an 8x8 baking dish. I was worried about the amount of liquid but it reduced to the perfect amount to top each dumpling."
"1","5","I cut the recipe in 1/2 but otherwise followed it to a T. Very good, not too sweet and sets up perfectly."
"1","5","I know we aren't supposed to change anything, but I went with some others were saying. First of all, I only made a half batch for my husband and myself. That was a good thing since we would have eaten the whole thing ourselves! Anyway, I used 1 can of Reduced Fat crescent rolls, 4 TBL of butter, 1/4 cup of sugar/stevia blend and local apples I had on hand cut into quarters instead of 1/8ths. PERFECT!! Not that I wouldn't have liked them with all of the butter and the sugar! Just trying to keep things a little lighter!"
"1","4","I loved this my great grandmother used to use Mt.Dew in her apple dumplings as well. I did however use 1/4 cup white and 1/4cup brown sugar instead of the called for amount of 1 1/2 cups sugar. I also cut the Mt.Dew to 4oz and sprinkled the dumplings with cinnamon and sugar before baking they came out just perfect crisp on top and not to soggy on bottom . My family loved these I will be making these again and again!"
"1","5","RUN! Run to the kitchen and start peeling apples!! This is the greatest, easiest and most delicious desert! Being fall, I threw a pinch of pumpkin pie spice in the sauce. I cut back a little on the butter and sugar, and used diet Squirt (a citrus soda like Mountain Dew) and used reduced fat crescent rolls. I'll tell you, I made the first batch using Stevia for Baking. Don't try this!' I had to dump and start over. The oil from the butter separated from the sugar and spices, and was all clumpy. You really must use at least mostly real sugar. Not only does this belong in my recipe box, it belongs glued to the top! I paired it with homemade vanilla honey ice cream from this site.... A-Ma-Zing!"
"1","5","Just tried it with real peaches! It was delicious! Next time I may reduce the creme soda : ) but  I really do enjoy the syrup once it has already cooked. I did not add the cinnamon, wasn't sure if it would work, and tell you what my husband loves it!"
"1","5","This was fabulous! I was surprised because I thought they would be soggy. But I did take another poster's suggestion and lightly rolled the apples in cinnamon and sugar prior to wrapping them. I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and the cinnamon and cooked them with the butter until the sauce was thickened and carmelly. Then added 1 tsp of vanilla before pouring over the dumplings. I made sure to completely coat the dumplings with the excess sauce. Then poured the Mtn Dew over all of it. One thing to keep in mind, I could only find crescent rolls in 8oz. packages, so I purchased regular schoolboy size Granny Smiths instead of the large...for fear I wouldn't be able the pinch the dough closed around the apple slices. It worked perfectly. My guests LOVED these!! I will definitely make them again...and again...and again!"
"1","5","Lots of butter but, it was so delish I added little more cinnamon but the next time i'm going to use allspice."
"1","5","This was great! All 5 of us that had it loved it. Mine were not soggy. I simmered the butter, sugar and cinnamon mixture for a long time until it was very thick which may be why it wasn't soggy. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla as some suggested but I am not sure it was needed. I used half white and 1/2 brown sugar. The apples from my tree are sweet so I only did a total of 1 cup of sugar. I also made the crescent roll dough from scratch from this site."
"1","5","I have made this many times. The only thing I do different is use apple cider instead of Mt Dew...the apple cider brings it to a whole new level....as the old saying goes......'Try it.....you'll like it.' :)"
"1","5","OMG this was mouth watering good. The apples were perfect. I added too much mountain dew but they were still delicious and easy."
"1","4","If I had made this as written I'd have given 2 stars. It really sounded too sweet and rich for how I like dessert. I winged it by using 4 big apples in 1/4 pieces, 1 stick of butter, and only 1 cup of sugar-1/2 brown and 1/2 white, and the whole 12 oz of ginger ale (what I had). I added lemon juice and cinnamon to the apple pieces. I worried about screwing it up, and did stir back in the thick sugar coating on the top of the dumplings into the sauce, but it was absolutely perfect! The crescent triangles (used low fat) didn't cover the apple quarters but was just the right amount of dough. It wasn't syrupy, but a good covering of sweet sticky sauce. I also wouldn't call it 'gummy' or soggy as did others. They were quite reminiscent of my grandmothers homemade dumplings, which were whole cored apples in pie dough. I'm sure this recipe is great made as it was, it simply would have been to rich and calories laden for me to make again. With the proportions listed I'll make it often! Thank you!"
"1","5","This was a huge hit at our church picnic. I doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough to go around. Everyone loved it and no one could guess the secret ingredient...mountain dew. I rolled the apples in cinnamon and suger before rolling them in the crescent rolls and I cooked the butter and sugar mixture until it was thick and caramel like. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white."
"1","5","Delicious! I couldn't find a single can of mountain dew so I bought the shoprite store brand lemon lime soda and it was delicious!"
"1","2","Sickening sweet, will find a less sweet recipe next time."
"1","5","i want to try it !!!"
"1","5","Anyone giving this less than 5 stars is crazy!! It's a crazy recipe too. I have shared it so many times now. People can't get over the fact that there is soda pop in the recipe. Oh well, it's the best and SO EASY to make."
"1","5","This has been in my RB for a long time. I halved the recipe (which fit nicely in an 8x8 pan) and baked the entire 45 minutes. I think some of the low reviews may be due to undertaking. They 'looked' done at 30 Minutes but I let them go the full time and am glad I did. Nice crispy tops, soft bottoms in a thick sauce with no artificial taste. I used diet squirt which worked fine, but next time I am going to use Trader Joe's flash pasteurized apple juice. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company. Also no need to peel the apples. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","When I first read the ingredients I really wasn't sure about these but thought I'd give them a try. They were a hit! Must eat when warm. I will use half an apple in each next time as I prefer more apple (personal taste). I even made a glaze for these with icing sugar and a little milk. Also I found the longer they sat in the pan the soaked up more of the 'syrup'. YUMMY! Will be making this again for sure... Maybe as a sugar-free options as others have mentioned."
"1","5","I make this every year, the whole family requests it at literally every holiday dinner. I usually do about 2 cups of sugar and I never measure the Mountain Dew- I just lightly pour it over each dumpling and a little in the sugary sauce but I don't think I use all that is called for."
"1","4","Delicious. Leftovers get moist/watery quickly in the refrigerator."
"1","5","I made this recipe exactly as it was written and I have to say that this recipe is absolutely fabulous! It was also much easier than it looks on presentation. One of those dishes that will impress with little effort. You must try this!"
"1","4","This was very good, but it makes me cringe with all the calories and fat. I think I will try and make this a little waistline friendly by cutting down on the butter and sugar and maybe using diet soda."
"1","5","I used diet mountain dew and it was fabulous, I have been using this over and over again since finding it. Leaves the top of the dumplings perfectly crisp and FABULOUS!"
"1","5","Oh my gosh!!!!! Absolutely divine!"
"1","5","This was so easy & delicious. This recipe is a definite keeper."
"1","5","Okay, this could not be easier or more delicious! I didn't have mountain dew on hand but I used a can of sprite and it was just amazing. And I admit I forgot to peel the apples, but the skin was totally soft once baked. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and even my pickiest daughter who swears she doesn't like apples had two helpings. I served the leftovers for breakfast the next day and they were fighting over the last one. Great recipe, it will be in my regular routine from now on!"
"1","5","The mountain dew really makes it better. No one who has tried this recipe doesnt like it!"
"1","5","Delicious! I live in UK so used Lilt can for Mountain Dew. Family loved it. Quick and easy to make."
"1","5","These are amazing!! I have made exactly as the recipe says (about 10 times now!) and have also done half white sugar and half brown sugar, both were equally delicious! We always use Fuji apples. Be sure to pour the 'syrup' on the tops of the crescents as you're pouring, they get a great crust while baking when you do this. Family favorite again and again!!"
"1","5","So easy! Such an impressive dish, guests will think you've spent hours preparing! Just like mom used to make - except easy and super fast to prepare! I doubled the apples in mine."
"1","5","This was soooo good and easy to make. If you have a problem with preservatives like some people complained, then I don't know why you are buying the pastry dough anyway. I thought it tasted great, and it was a perfect fast dessert. Thanks for the awesome recipe!"
"1","5","I like to take this to pot lucks and people always ask about it. So easy and so good."
"1","5","Very delicious!!! Although I didn't make the reicpe as stated to rate it a 5; I didn't have any sugar so I substituted the sugar with honey...using the same amount in the recipe. I also lowered the temperature from 350 to 325 so the honey wouldn't burn quickly. It turned out well, very sweet, buttery and delicious....so if I had used sugar it would still turned out sweet, buttery and delicious. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and poured the juices in the dish over the ice cream, too."
"1","5","Absolute family favorite. But I only used 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1tsp cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and a 1/2 of can of mountain dew. I coat the dumplings entirely with the sauce then pour in the mountain dew but not on the dumplings. This keeps the bottoms soft but not soggy, and the top turns out crisp."
"1","5","My mom who is 85 and has always made homemade apple pie told me about this, so as always, I check to see if it was on allrecipes. I dont't think we will make apple pie again. So sinfully yummy!"
"1","5","I made this with my canned aple pie filling. Yummo!!!"
"1","5","I made a batch of these last night. Eaten while hot, over a scoop of vanilla ice cream is just perfect. I think next time I will cut back on the sugar by 1/2 a cup, though."
"1","4","Very good! (Don't know why I was so surprised, after all the reviews I read.) I did cut back, without any noticeable issues. Used 1/2 cup butter, only 3/4 cup sugar, doubled the cinnamon, and put 1/8 tsp. ground ginger in as well. I think next time I would also add a little ground cloves and nutmeg, as I like them spicy! Didn't have Mountain Dew, but I had some grapefruit soda (Squirt or Shasta), and it worked fine. Family LOVED them! Still can taste the canned crescent dough flavor, but all in all, I would make these again."
"1","2","I followed the recipe exactly, no modifications and all I can say is: it is okay. Way too sweet and fake tasting for me and mine. Frankly it's a very expensive recipe that doesn't deliver. I won't be making it again."
"1","1","They were soggy, buttery and tasteless. I love apple desserts but this recipe is NOT a keeper. The mixture of soda and butter made a runny corn syrup like juice that just sat in the pan preventing the dough from rising, browning and crisping around the tiny portion of apple that didnt even cook!"
"1","5","I made this recipe with hoppin' john for New Years, and everyone loved it! I love sweets, especially gooey fruity ones, but found it just a little too buttery for me. The changes I made from reading the comments were to change the sugar to 1 cup white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar, I used 4 smaller apples cut into quarters, and increased the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp."
"1","5","Oh so easy and quite yummy! I used a 1/4 of apple instead of 1/8."
"1","5","These turned out great! I was devestated when i found out my brother had switched the cinnamon with cayanne though..."
"1","5","This is a great recipe, I did modify it a bit the last time I made it and it was phenominal!! I used a little less butter, splenda white and splenda brown sugar and sub'd out the mt dew for orange juice, added a teaspoon o vanilla extract then I arranged the crescent rolls stuffed with the apples in a greased 9x13 pan then arranged the leftover apple slices around the edges, sprinked with maple and brown sugar dry oatmeal then poured the mixture over the oatmeal and a little more in the bottom of the pan, it created a caramel sauce..ummm and baked for 30 minutes...you an also toss in some cranberries and or raisens..a great dessert!"
"1","5","This is such a good treat and real easy to make. I changed it to diet moutain dew and a lighter crescent as well as other lighter options just so it wasn't as terrible for you. I actually forgot to peel the apples and they turned out chewy, so make sure you do that! Still SO good though!"
"1","5","This recipe is great and so easy. My family LOVES it and my mother even wants me to make a dish for her to bring to someone's house like it's her own dish. I even took the advice of another review and made a diabetic version for my diabetic grandfather. I love this recipe"
"1","5","I'm not going to lie, when I first read the Mountain Dew thing it sounded a little weird. It was just my boyfriend and I so I only used 1 large apple (used golden delicious as my grocery store was actually out of granny smith). Used the low fat crescent rolls, and followed as directed (but obviously cut everything in half). The only change I made is since I was using 3/4c sugar I did like others and did 1/2 white and 1/4 brown. I then used an 8x8' casserole dish. Don't be concerned that the liquid goes up almost as high as the dumplings (I assumed I had done something wrong but then watched the video). Once they're done cooking and you throw them on a plate they crisp up. I just uses low fat Cool Whip on top and drizzled more of the sauce over them. My boyfriend who DOESN'T LIKE DESSERT said 'wow, thats different' and just sat there for a minute, then asked for more! Definitely a very cheap and very easy dessert I'll make many times again!"
"1","4","these are very good, made them exactly like written, Will be making this again soon and alot!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!! I made it a number of times and my family loved it.I made the croissant dough from scratch and served it warm with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Yummy and so easy to make -- thank you Dee for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","Great recipe. perfect with vanilla ice cream. Remember to roll apple wedges in sugar and cinnamon first and pour soda around not on the dumplings."
"1","3","Eh, they weren't that great. Not making again."
"1","4","Easy and very good! I rolled the apples in cinnamon sugar before rolling up in the dough. I used 1 stick of butter + 2 tablespoons and 1/2 c of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make the caramel sauce. Cooked the caramel sauce until thick and bubbly then poured it on top of the dumplings. It was plenty. Then I only used 10 oz of Mountain Dew and poured it on the sides/bottom (not on the dumplings). Served warm with vanilla ice cream - Yum!"
"1","4","This recipe was very good, but very sweet. I only ended up using about a cup of the sugar because that was all that I had. We had a couple leftover pieces, which I made the mistake of eating cold. They are much better warmed (not hot).  The second time I made these, they did not turn out at all... the soda, butter and sugar made a soupy mess and didn't absorb into the dough and make a caramel-like sauce like it did before. Still trying to figure out what I did wrong on that one."
"1","5","These are absolutely amazing!!! We made these tonight for a friend's birthday and they were such a huge hit that our friends asked for the recipe. I doubled the amount of cinnamon as we like cinnamon and we don't drink Mountain Dew so we used a can of generic lemon-lime soda and they were still fantastic. We will definitely make this one again!!!"
"1","5","Ok, I have to add my 'oh my gosh' to this...yummy, yummy!"
"1","5","Love this recipe. My Mom will skip other desserts waiting for me to make these. If I'm feeling guilty I just cut back on the sugar and Mountain Dew and still fantastic. New family tradition. Thanks docswife."
"1","5","These were amazing! Best dessert ever!"
"1","5","I didn't expect this to be as delicious as it was! I halved the butter and sugar, but it was still wonderful. I brought this to a potluck and got so many compliments (and recipe requests)."
"1","5","People loved it! So easy to make. Try it!"
"1","5","This recipe was a hit with everyone. I had college kids home for a couple of hours, well basically long enough to eat. I made soups, sandwiches, cornbread, salads and apple dumplings. As full as everyone was from dinner, they all managed to eat 2-3 of these. We served them warm with vanilla ice cream. I made a double batch of this so that I had pans to give away. No one guessed that the sauce ingredient was Mountain Dew™. I made 1 batch with regular MD and the second batch with diet. Both pans were equally good. Thanks docswife for sharing. This is a great fall recipe."
"1","4","These were pretty good, although I would probably cut down on the butter the next time I make these, and cut the apples into larger pieces. It didn't seem like there was enough apple for my taste."
"1","5","I hesitated because of the 'artificial' dough used in this and to be honest, the mountain dew???? But, OH MY, let me tell you, probably the easiest and one of the most delicious desserts ever. I now try and keep a roll of pilsbury and bottle of mountain dew on hand for surprise guests. Everyone devours this!!!"
"1","5","I was so skeptical when I put this in the oven. It looked awful- with clumps of the sugar mixture and the bright green of the Mtn Dew... BUT, it was delicious! There was lots of sauce left over and I wish I had some vanilla ice cream to pout it over!! I did replace about 1/3 of the white sugar with brown sugar and let the sugar/butter mixture boil while I rolled the apples up. I'll definitely make this again, but I think I'd be mortified to tell anyone what's in it!! It'll just be my little secret..."
"1","5","These were so good, served them with vanilla ice cream on the side!"
"1","5","MMMM! Writing this as I eat 2 of them! Very, very good, and easy to make. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I cut the butter to 1 stick, used 1/2 c Splenda and 1/4 c brown sugar, rolled the apples in a Splenda/cinnamon mix first, and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture, and used diet Mountain Dew. I'd definitely make these again."
"1","5","I was skeptical when I saw Mountain Dew as part of the recipe. But WOW. This is absolutely AMAZING! The only thing I changed on the recipe was to add a little bit of cinnamon/sugar inside of the croissant before I rolled the apple inside. If you aren't sure about this recipe, please give it a try. You will love it!"
"1","5","Dont change a Thing! these are easy to make and very tasty."
"1","5","OMG!! These were great!! I hardly changed it at all. I love cinnamon so I sprinkled a little inside each one, I also melted the sugar a little bit instead of just mixing it. Thats all I did. This was PERFECT!!!"
"1","5","Exceptional!!!!! Would'nt change a thing!!!!!"
"1","5","I pretty much only made these because I saw the sauce had Mountain Dew in it and I thought there was no way this could taste good. This recipe is amazing though. It's simple but so good. Make sure to spoon the sauce over the dumplings before serving!"
"1","5","I seriously just made these and everybody loved them!!!! This is better than in restaurants. Thank you so much for such a great, easy, and tasty apple dumpling recipe. I better get back out in the kitchen before those cavemen eat it all."
"1","5","I made these today. They were yummy. I could not stop eating these. I rolled my apples in brown and white sugar then rolled them in the pastry and I only used 8oz of the Mountain Dew. My husband loved them as well and I plan on taking them to my next church pot luck. Thank you"
"1","5","These were so good and so simple to put together. Perfect easy dessert for a cold winter night. I've also used peaches and pears. I usually use Ginger Ale as that's normally the kind of soda I have on hand. Whole family loves them!"
"1","5","AMAZING! Huge hit with the family....."
"1","5","Just cooked these last night and was suprised how nice the crust was on the outside. I served 2 per person with a scoop of icecream. The bottoms were soft but the dough was cooked. Great tasting. Everyone looved them and couldn't believe that the recipe called for a can of mountain dew. I am making them again for the 4th of July."
"1","5","Awesome! Will definitely make these again. Only thing I did differently was use the 1/2 Splenda/Sugar baking mix. I also used 9 x 15 pan to separate the dumplings after looking at the photos others posted. I wanted to be sure mine browned nicely. They looked beautiful and tasted great."
"1","5","Oh my god!!! So good everybody ate these all up,vanilla ice cream is a must."
"1","5","Followed recipe to a T! Final result was amazing! These are so easy to make and very very tasty! Already made them twice this week! :)"
"1","5","These were absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect with the Mountain Dew, neither my husband or myself actually likes it, but they turned out better than I had hoped. Not only are they tasty, but they're quick and inexpensive so I can't wait to make some for quests."
"1","5","Even after reading so many 5 star reviews, they still exceeded my expectations. Absolutely amazing."
"1","5","OMG...if i could give this more than 5 stars...I WOULD!!!...these are so yummy!!!!...EVERYONE loved these..and when i told them how i made them they were amazed!!!...Thanks!"
"1","5","I have used this recipe numerous times and always get rave reviews about the dumplings. I have always made them according to the recipe with no changes. However, due to time and space this time I melted the butter in the microwave then melted the sugar and cinnamon into the butter. Also, used Mountain Dew Code Red as I didn't have the original MD. OMG!!!! Fantastic! The Code Red gives the dumplings an extra layer of flavor being cherry. Will use both versions of this dumpling depending on what is in the fridge. You can't go wrong with this recipe. It rocks!!!"
"1","5","Made this recipe exactly as it says, only I cut it in half. Came out soooooo good! The only thing I think I will change is I will toss the apples in some cinnamon suger before rolling them in the rolls so that it's a tiny bit sweeter. Might add some extra apples too just cause they were so tasty! Great recipe thanks for sharing! :)"
"1","5","ABSOLUTE AMAZINGNESS! I did change some things though.... I didn't have any apples, so instead I used fresh strawberries to fill the crescent rolls. SO YUMMY! I halved the recipe.. a full stick of butter for the halved recipe seemed like a lot of extra calories, so I reduced it to half a stick of butter and half a cup of sugar. Instead of 8 triangles (one pack of crescent rolls) I made 4 rectangles to put the strawberries in!   This was SO tasty! I was surprised at how amazing it tasted! This will be my go to recipe for dessert! I can't wait to try it with the apples... I'm sure it will taste great with peaches, blueberries, etc! Thanks for sharing!!"
"1","5","Oh wow, these where delicious! I can not believe mt dew could make something so decedent especially since i hate mt dew. lol The one thing i did wrong is i did not keep stirring the sauce to incorporate the sugar/butter mixture enough. It said stir in and that is exactly what i did and did not read the reviews till later. But still came out yummy. Great job, will def be making again. I topped with vanilla bean ice cream. ohhh yumm"
"1","1","Really wanted to like this because of all the glowing reviews but just can't. Found the bottom to be slimy and just not worth the calories. Even the kids wouldn't eat any more. Next time will just put in the effort to make an apple pie."
"1","5","so easy, inexpensive yet yummy!"
"1","5","This is DELICIOUS! Something I'd expect to get on a cruise ship or fine dining restaurant. My husband took his first bite and went into a bliss! this is totally unhealthy but a good treat. I paired with Vanilla Ice Cream while it was warm and tasted delicious. This is a must make!!"
"1","5","awesome!"
"1","5","It is as easy to review this recipe as it is to make and can be summed up in one word......DEVINE!"
"1","5","This is the bomb! The best ever, and easy to make. The whole family loved it, the kids and grandkids insist on having these dumplings each time they come for dinner."
"1","4","Very good and very simple."
"1","5","So easy and SOOOOOO Good! I thought they might be too sweet but no they are perfect. I use the large cresents and I prefer the Braeburn apples they seem to stay more firm. I made them with the granny smith and they were still great. Thank you for this recipe!"
"1","5","This is the first time I have ever rated anything! These are soooo good! I made by the recipe... don t change! YUMMMMM"
"1","5","Great recipe - nice, easy, and tasty!"
"1","5","AMAZING! I was really skeptical when I read this recipe, but it was fabulous, so sweet and the apple ends up being so soft. The first time I made it I followed the recipe and we loved it. To save some calories/fat the next time I made them we used low fat cresents, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar and diet mountain dew. Still tasted just as great!"
"1","5","My family absolutely LOVES this recipe! And so easy to make!! A definite keeper!!"
"1","5","Amazing and so simple!"
"1","4","These were good, but 1 can of soda was too much for mine...they were soggy, but still good."
"1","5","Family loved these!! Even my son and husband loved them and they aren't really 'into' sweets! They had second helpings!!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS! Everybody is asking me to make more! Delicious, that's all I can say!!! Just delicious! And did I say DELICIOUS!"
"1","4","Made this for dessert last night. A very simple dish to make - one I will be able to do from memory quite easily in the future. I will def. make this again. Next time I may use part splenda to slim it down a bit. But it was sooo good. Everyone loved it. Thanks!"
"1","4","really easy. Pretty good. I don't love the biscuit taste so another dough might taste better."
"1","5","WOW. Made these for our church community meal and people just went crazy for them! This recipe is amazing ~ I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","1","My 2cents: The dough tasted like dinner rolls as was it's intended use. I followed this recipe accordingly, not substituting anything... and I felt like having mashed potatoes and corn with the rolls and getting some pie dough for the sweet stuff. 1 star for the sweet ingredients only.  Thank you just the same"
"1","5","These. Are. Amazing!! Wow, wow, wow! I thought there was too much liquid when I started pouring the Mountain Dew so I only used 1/2 can - made a nice sugary sauce kind of thing on the bottom of the pan. Also, I needed to cook them longer than the recipe states, but I had really big Granny Smiths.   I also made the Praline Caramel sauce (from this site) to go on top. The dumplings didn't *need* anything else but it was really dang tasty."
"1","5","I fixed this for a family cookout, and my brother's comment was, 'These are ridiculously tasty.'"
"1","5","This is a great aand easy recipe. Everyone loved it."
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful. Sharing with all my friends."
"1","5","These dumplings were a huge hit when I took them to our family's weekly covered dish! Everyone who managed to get one raved about how delicious they were. Next time I will be making two pans and taking vanilla ice cream to top them!"
"1","5","They're terribly delicious! Which you really don't want them to be because they're so obviously awful for your health! Decadent, simple, boyfriend and kids are head over heels for, and they'll even make them themselves. A++"
"1","5","Was really easy to make. I made sure my sugar mixture was at a rolling boil so it coats and stays on the dumplings. Can't wait to try it!!"
"1","5","This was so delicious! I am a huge apple pie fan and this is just like having a slice of apple pie. It was really great warm with a big 'ol scoop of vanilla ice cream!"
"1","4","I made this a little on the healthy side using splenda , can't believe its not butter and diet Mountain Dew and it came out great. I have family members with diabetes and this was a good treat, if I could have found wholewheat cresent rolls that your have been better."
"1","3","it was ok. it was a little too soggy for me. very sweet."
"1","5","Great stuff !"
"1","4","They are as yummy as they look. I made this for my husband and myself I don't know why I didn't cut the recipe in 1/2 since I Had So much left over. They seem to keep and reheat well though. I used 7 up didn't have any Mt. Dew on hand. I will make them again. Thanks."
"1","5","*Takes off Sunglasses* Mother of god, what a dish! I had little time to make a dessert for easter and saw the banner. It spent more time in the oven than it did on the dinner table. I will be making this again SOON! ;D"
"1","5","So incredibly easy! My family loved it warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Definitely a new family favorite."
"1","5","Oh emm gee! This is totally awesome. I thought it would come out runny, but the sauce thickens and it's just mouth watering!"
"1","5","Very nice. flavorful and decadent. Like apple pie on steroids!!"
"1","5","Its amazing how such simple ingredients can have this kind of outcome. These were really tasty. I halved the recipe but only used 1/2 a stick of butter (1/4 cup) and it came out great and crispy on the outside and a little gooey on the bottom. I used 7-up and poured it in the pan without pouring it over the dumplings. I would be making this again"
"1","5","Truly amazing! Usually recipes this good require so much work but this is one of the easiest desserts I've ever made. Like others, I added brown sugar. I used a mix of granny smith and gala apple slices because that's how I usually do my apple pies. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how to make the apples sweeter? I was thinking for next time I would pour some of the sauce inside the cresent roll so the apples can absorb the sugar."
"1","5","Very Yummy, my husband asked not to make them again because he ate them all :)"
"1","5","Yes I have been making this for most of our family get togethers for a long time. It's most requested by my Grandchildren. I did add while putting apple on the crescent roll , a few crasins, sometimes dried blueberries."
"1","5","Oh My Lord! These are good! We rolled alot more apple into the crescent rolls than the recipe calls for and added a little cinnamon before rolling & served it up with some vanilla icecream. Yum!"
"1","3","A little too sweet for our liking and that was with a reduction in the butter and sugar as indicated."
"1","4","I only used half the sugar mixture and used the brown sugar suggestions. These were great. Really, really sweet but a hit with everyone. Next time may cut down on the sugar even more as it was almost too sweet for some people."
"1","5","My review will sound like a broken record after all the others, but my family just could't believe how amazingly good these silly things are!! I've already made them twice in one week. A quick tip: do NOT buy generic crescent rolls. They were a mess to try to divide up. It's worth the time and effort to buy Pillsbury or something. Serve it warm with a little ice cream! YUM!"
"1","5","This is SO good! Only change I made was 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Delish!"
"1","5","These Dumplings were the hit of Easter Dinner! Yummy!!!!!!!"
"1","5","OMG... These are simply one of the easiest, most amazing treats that have come out of my oven!!!! Kudos to the creator!!! I served them warm with Vanilla Bean ice cream."
"1","5","WOW!!! I cant get over how delicious these were. I served them warm with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. This will now be a regular in our house. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Well, my husband of 19 years said that these dumplings were the best thing he's ever eaten in his entire life, and my son has requested these in place of birthday cake. The recipe deserves 5 stars as written."
"1","5","This had my entire family saying nothing but Mmmmmmmmm...silence....Mmmmmmmm.  I had to halve the recipe....these are VERY rich and go a long way in satisfying that dessert craving. We didn't even have to have ice-cream. Only thing I did differently was add a 1 tsp. vanilla to the sugar/butter mixture and instead of Mt. Dew added 1/2 can Sprite Zero....I think using non-sugar free soda helps caramelize the sauce making it a bit thicker....so be prepared to perhaps cook it a little longer as I had to."
"1","5","This is a keeper. I'm going to try with pears, bananas and yes even garlic. However for the original recipe you might consider cutting down on the sugar and butter."
"1","5","This recipe is so easy to follow and has great results. Replaced the Mountain Dew with an alcoholic beverage, Mike's Hard Limeade, and they were delicious. Sprinkled a tad more cinnamon on top and coarse granulated sugar before baking. Tasty and sticky ~ Mmmmmm"
"1","5","I've made this multiple times always sweet and delicous.I had no idea it would be so good even with the great reviews and its so simple. DO NOT USE THE BUTTERED CROISSANTS i was in a rush on day not noticing what i was doing that was a big mistake had to toss the whole batch, real bummer."
"1","5","I made these to go along with the 'Cinnamon Ice Cream' recipe on this website and they were great!!! These had the perfect amount of buttery, cinnamony apple goodness. They were inhaled!!"
"1","5","So easy and delicious! Leftovers make for a yummy breakfast the next day. Best when served with bluebell homemade vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","This is so good you can't stop eating them. My family and friends loved them. So easy to make."
"1","5","These were great & easy to make. They taste better the net day."
"1","5","The topping is crunchy, the apples soft and delicious. I used pink lady apples and cut the recipe in half, it makes 8 individual dumplings but you'll probably end up eating two! Enjoy! It's like cheating at apple pie :)"
"1","5","This is AMAZING! Everyone RAVED about these! I followed others advice about using part brown sugar and rolling the apples in cinnamon sugar before rollingh them in the dough. They came our PERFECT!"
"1","5","who would have thought??!! yummy, scrumptious and easy!"
"1","5","very good. my son wanted these instead of a birthday cake!!!"
"1","5","There aren't enough stars for this one. I decided I just had to have this for my birthday. Made half a batch as there were only four of us. Used half brown sugar and half white. Topped with whipped cream. O=O=O so good."
"1","5","These were amazing. Who would've thunk it? I went into this recipe with no expectations since it was so odd but the results were an empty pan within minutes."
"1","5","These were awesome and costs very little to make a whole lot. Will definitely make them again for company!"
"1","5","i halved it and it was very good. make it again. great with ice cream"
"1","5","All I can say is...these are as good if not better than what everyone says....my husband & I both just ate half the pan (9x13) together & we both have stomach aches! Yum though!"
"1","5","This an outstanding recipe. I added a little whipped cream and strawberries on the side. My husband went nuts for this. Not only good, but, inexpensive.  Reviewed by: Claire Jacobs"
"1","5","Whole family loved it!!! Next time I will not use as much sugar/butter - I don't think it is neccessary!"
"1","5","Wowzers. I was craving something apple and man did this hit the spot. And easy to make. Only regret is that I forgot to buy vanilla ice cream to go with the sweet apple goodness! I even used reduced fat crescents and diet pop and less sugar.. Still incredibly amazing."
"1","5","Perfection! Make these now! They will instantly make you happy! If you don't give these five stars then you shouldn't be rating things."
"1","5","First dessert I've ever baked! Effin delicious."
"1","5","So great! Might sound a little weird with the Mountian Dew, but it was excellent! With vanilla ice cream! I couldn't have asked for anything better! I highly reccomend!"
"1","5","Just like everyone says, these are FANTASTIC!!"
"1","5","This was excellent! My whole family loved them. I fixed the recipe exactly as posted. Although other people who reviewed did not like the way it sat in Mountain Dew, we loved it because the bottom was soft and sweet. Perfect the way it is, a definite keeper!!!"
"1","5","This recipe was more delicious than I had anticipated. it was flaky on top and had a pudding-like bottom. I added vanilla to the butter sauce before pouring over the dumplings....DELICIOUS!!!"
"1","5","I actually already had this recipe from a friend. These are a big hit every time I have brought them."
"1","5","This recipe is simple and delicious! We always run out of it, so I would recommend doubling the recipe!"
"1","5","These are so easy to make and they are AWESOME!"
"1","5","Tried this recipe on a whim......and boy were we surprised with the great taste. As you can tell by the pictures, add some cool whip or ice cream on the side!"
"1","5","Wow! This was great and soo easy! Even my picky mom loved it! I used Ginger Ale instead of Mountain Dew and added cinnamon to my apples."
"1","5","These are simply delightful. Made them for a few friends and everyone had seconds. It is delicious by itself, but vanilla ice cream would made the best compliment."
"1","5","These. Were. Awesome!!!"
"1","5","Sinfully wonderful! Took these into work and everyone hit the roof!"
"1","5","These are awesome for a quick and easy dessert,great with ice cream."
"1","5","Super fun and easy for baking with the kids. They were unbelievably good."
"1","4","Great recipe!!! Very easy and delicious!! Made a few changes...cut my apples in about thirds, used about 1/4 cup butter, and 1/3 cup sugar (1 1/2 cups of sugar just seemed like way too much for my tastes). Also, used only about 8 to 10 oz of mountain dew."
"1","5","Not friendly so much to the waste line but so good it's worth it. Modifications can be made so it's not so much sugar and butter, but if your not shy go for it. Great with some icecream on top while they are still warm"
"1","3","Not bad. Not as good as I expected, but it was really easy to make and tasted pretty good for the amount of time involved."
"1","5","so easy ...family loves them..."
"1","5","All I can say is yummie. They were such a big hit I am making a double batch for Thanksgiving dinner."
"1","5","I did like a lot of people and used 3/4c brown sugar and 3/4c white sugar. I also only used about 10oz of Mountain Dew. These were jaw dropping, must-have-seconds delicious! Served with vanilla bean and everyone at the party wanted the recipe."
"1","5","Super Simple and Super Yummy!!! Enjoyed sooooo much!!!!"
"1","5","I would give this more stars if I could. My family fought over these. I made a couple extra and warmed them up for breakfast the next morning with a cup of coffee. These are slap your mamma good."
"1","5","My family loved this recipe. I didn't have Mt. dew so I used a half cup of egg nog. I also used half brown and half white sugar. (i missed out on the citrus part but the the egg nog gave it a an extra winter holiday taste plus my family loves anything with egg nog. Overall Loved the recipe!!!!! Thanks..."
"1","5","So amazing. The only thing I did different, after reading all of the reviews is use 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. So easy- I made an apple pie a few weeks ago and honesty.. these were so much better and took so little time! My family loves them!! Oh, and don't be freaked out by the Mountain Dew.. it sounds weird, but you would never know it's in the recipe!!"
"1","5","This is by far my most favorite dessert EVER. When I make it, my family goes goo goo gah gah for it!They don't believe that there is mountain dew in it. You can't taste it, it just gives the dumplings the extra sweet zing to make them perfect!"
"1","1","I'm glad so many people liked this, but I have to confess, my family and I did not. I followed the recipe exactly, so I am rating the actual recipe listed. Although I thought it would ne an interesting combination, I didn't at all care for the flavor of butter and Mountain Dew together...though I like them both separately. The texture was fine...just didn't like the taste."
"1","5","So easy. So delicious."
"1","5","This recipe gets my first review on this site, it was so good! It's so FANTASTIC I only shared it with my friends who live in a different state so I can impress my local friends here. We had a big group coming over for dinner and I wanted an easy impressive dessert that was easy to dish up individually. I read through the reviews, took a chance and stretched the high calorie topping by making 24 dumplings (I used a jelly roll pan but I bet would fit on 13X9 dish). I also used 1/2cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar with the 1 cup of melted butter, added tsp of cinnamon and vanilla to sugar mxture. I spooned over the dumplings and used 12 oz of mountain dew. It was incredible! The topping did not need to be increased for the added dumplings. Next time I will try the reduced fat rolls and the diet dew because I will definitely be making this again!"
"1","5","Amazing and super easy! Just as written! Hubby and father-in-law loved!! Thank u!!"
"1","5","Amazing as is!!"
"1","5","excellent!! I didn't have any crossant's but i had cinnamon roll's i thought why not so i wrapped each apple in the roll and omitted the cinnamon great"
"1","3","Very good!!! A little bit too sugary for everyone else in my family, but wonderful to me!!!!"
"1","5","We loved this. It is so easy to make and tastes really good! I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar and smart balance. The tops were nice and crispy after 35 min off cook time. Plop some vanilla ice cream in there and its even better. I may never make an apple pie again!"
"1","5","These are AMAZING! I'm not even a dessert eater, but I can't resist these. The only changes I made were I use turbinado sugar (raw sugar) instead of white and added a t of vanilla extract. Yum! My neighbors loved them as well! You can do fresh pears too!"
"1","5","Deserves 10 stars. I made these exactly as the original recipe and I wouldn't dream of changing anything! They are the perfect size after a meal. I served them with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, a little curl of whipped cream on top of the dumpling & sprinkled it with cinnamon. The crescent dough is light and flaky...better than any traditional dumpling I've ever had...and they're so much easier to make! Thanks for this recipe!"
"1","5","Very yummy! Next time I will add less mountain dew though."
"1","5","These are simply amazing!"
"1","5","THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!! I WILL MAKE IT FOR THANKSGVING!"
"1","5","All I can say is OMG !! Although very sweet... They were simple to make and really good !!!"
"1","5","I made 1/2 the recipe for Ladies Night--I wasn't sure if anyone would like them. I should have made the whole recipe because they were a HIT!! Everyone loved them!! I thought they would be too sweet but it was just right. The soda really added a 'twang' to the dessert...Thanks so much! I can't wait to make them again!!"
"1","5","These are sensational! Excellent, the whole family raved about them! I didn't change a thing, perfect as is. Quick and easy dessert."
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was not as good as I has hoped. The top was nice and crispy but the bottom was very soggy. The sauce was flavorless. I would have liked more apple flavor and less sugar."
"1","5","I did make a couple of changes - brown sugar instead of white and I also sprinkled cinnamon directly onto the apples before rolling them into the crescents. I usually only make half of the recipe at a time, too. Still, absolutely amazing and in the past week and a half I've made these three times. My husband can NOT get enough of them!"
"1","5","AMAZING!!!! I was concerned about the Mt.Dew but it was amazing and so easy!"
"1","4","I made this but did a lil twist. I used carmel apple sheets and wrapped the apple bit in it. I think next time I will dice the apples as I've read in another review. The apple piece with skin in came out all at once? I also don't know how well I liked the sauce, may use less soda as it was runny! But definatley great warm with ice cream and carmel sauce drizzled on top!"
"1","5","Instead of the Mountain Dew, I use a 1/2 cup of orange juice and pour over dumplings. Also I decreased the butter to 2 Tbsp. I used 1 can of crescent rolls; divided it into 4 rectangles;peeled and cored 2 apples ,cut them in half, and put each half onto a rectangle,pinching seams well. I decreased the sugar to a half cup and mixed 2 tbsp. cinnamon with it, then covered pan with foil and baked at 400 degrees for 35 min. Absolutely easy and Delish!"
"1","1","Complete waste of time and ingredients. Too sweet, terrible flavor. I can usually change something to make a recipe better but there's no helping this one."
"1","5","Awesome!! I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. It tasted like a monkey ball cake but was so much easier and faster to prepare. Definitely a keeper and it will probably replace our annual Christmas monkey ball cake. I think I will probably add a second apple next time, which I will chop and sprinkle on top. I may also add pecans to it."
"1","5","I have made a lot of recipes from this site and this is definitely one of the top 5!! This was amazing! I was hesitant of adding the soda (I used Sprite) because it, of course, sounds so odd, but WOW this was wonderful! I made it for 3 people who devoured it (as well as myself) and we are now changing one of our traditional Christmas desserts to this. I also halved the recipe and used part white / part brown sugar and added vanilla. Thanks so much for a great recipe!!"
"1","3","They were good, I followed others advice and added brown sugar and vanilla and also poured the soda around the sides. They definitely did not need an hour to cook, more like 25 minutes. I recommend letting them sit for a least 5 minutes after cooking to let the sauce thicken a bit."
"1","4","My husbnad and I really enjoyed this. We made it exactly as it was and the only thing I found that kept it from being a 5 star was it had too much liquid. (I understand dumplings are soft and this much just made them too soft. Had to dump out all remaining liquid to be able to put leftovers in the fridge without them turning completly into mush. Were very good the next day heated up too!) Will make again just reduce amt of soda!"
"1","5","Just made this tonight and it was fabulous! Put some vanilla ice cream on top and it's heavenly. So easy, too! A definite keeper."
"1","4","This was great! I enjoyed it a lot and will definitely make it again!"
"1","5","Yum!! This was so easy, yet so good! When we were dating, DH & I would split an apple dumping for dessert. This brought back memories ;) The change I made was 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, a dash (1/4 tsp) of nutmeg, and 1 tsp of vanilla as others have said."
"1","5","Excellent... I used half of the sugar and butter and ginger ale, and it came out unbelieveable. I made it in the morning...it was great just out of the oven. Then we ate it after dinner. great heated and cold. the had it again the next morning, cold, and it still taste great."
"1","5","These are so easy to make and taste delicious and look pretty! I will definitely make these again and they are company worthy too! Thanks docswife for sharing!"
"1","5","Wow!!!! These did not disappoint. They are incredible. I like that the recipe makes 16. It is the perfect dessert to throw together for company or bring to a potluck. They are small but so sweet that just one with a little scoop of ice cream makes a perfect dessert. I did only use 1/2 of the butter, sugar and cinnamon and used @10 oz. of Mountain Dew (had a 20 oz. bottle). That worked great and was just enough for my taste. This one is a definite keeper in my opinion. Thanks for submitting it!"
"1","5","This was so yummy! Don't know exacty what the Mountain Dew did...but it was wonderful! I had the smaller granny smith apples and just cut them into 1/4 instead, and they turned out great! Wouldn't change a thing. Nice portion size too....not to big or small...just the right size for a sweet treat!"
"1","5","Easy. Use half the butter and half the sugar and diet soda"
"1","5","I made this last night for 3 guys watching the baseball game. They gobbled them all up and asked that I make them again for this Monday night football game. They saved me two and they were delicious. I used 1C. white sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar. I also used diet Mountain Dew. Thanks for the yummy recipe. Will definitely be making again, sounds like this weekend."
"1","5","Simple but amazing in taste!"
"1","5","All I can say is OMG!!!!! This was truly a great dessert!!! I followed it exactly except I added a little bit more cinnamon."
"1","5","Great dessert or to bring to somebody"
"1","4","This is delicious, but I gave it 4 stars because I was worried about all the extra calories. Did seem very sweet and the next time I make this I will decrease the amount of sugar to one cup and the butter to 3/4 cup, also will use diet soda as some have already done. Not a fan of so much sugar even though it tastes good."
"1","5","Husband Loves them !!! Super easy and sooo good! thanks"
"1","5","Even though I read everyone's review, I am shocked by how absolutely delicious this is. YUM!"
"1","5","AWESOME....... I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar and added tsp of vanilla. Wonderful with some vanilla ice cream. DELICIOUS!!!"
"1","4","I followed some of the tweaks that people submitted. I used half light brown sugar, half white sugar, and I used Bundaberg ginger beer instead of Mountain Dew. I personally wasn't flat-on-the-floor amazed, but they were definitely scrumptious! Though I must say, everyone in my Sunday school group was a little more impressed. And so I say bravo! A success!"
"1","5","This is the best easiest recipe ever! I did split the sugar in half ( half white half brown sugar), I also added vanilla. Make these, everyone will love them!"
"1","5","My husband I can make these any time I want to. He asked if we had more of the bread things. I tossed the apples with a little sugar, cinnamon & nutmeg and used ginger ale. Awesome!"
"1","5","Wonderful!"
"1","5","I've been getting requests for this recipe since the first time I made it. It's wonderful and easy and a hoot to make with the grandkids :)"
"1","5","It literally took 5 mins to assemble, it baked during dinner and was piping hot for dessert. Everyone raved about how wonderful it was!   I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. Several ate it alone and others had vanilla ice cream- but Everyone loved it!! Thanks for the simple and wonderful recipe :)"
"1","5","Holy COW! Talk about delicious and super easy, a combination that is rare!"
"1","5","These are wonderful, and could not be easier, but I found that if you let them sit a while, the juice will thicken a bit and soak in making them even tastier. These are even good the next day unreheated!"
"1","5","SOOOO GOOOOD!!!!!"
"1","5","Everyone LOVES these. They are so easy to make."
"1","5","Scrumptious! I halved the recipe, but otherwise left the recipe exactly the same. Will definitely be an easy go-to dessert."
"1","5","Oh my goodness... these were absolutely wonderful!!!! My whole family loved them!"
"1","5","Rave Reviews at dinner with friends. Took uncooked dish with sugar, cinnamon and butter (3/4 cup instead of whole cup) in tupperware and can of Mountain Dew (only used 3/4 of can) My host's house smelled wonderful as we ate dinner and it baked. Served with Vanilla ice cream. Yummy!"
"1","5","Yum! I used ginger ale and it was great!"
"1","5","YUMMY!! Surprisingly easy to make and my hubby loved them. I was afraid they may be too soggy, but they were great. Crispy on top and dumpling like on bottom....awesome!! This will be one of 'my' specialties...thank you very much :)))"
"1","5","If you don't find these dumpling to be more than delicious, the I have to say ......you have no taste buds. I've made these several times already and these things don't last long. I've made these for church functions and I never have any left. Very easy to make, tastes like eating miniature apple pies."
"1","5","omg! these are easy to make, and so delicious!!! my fiances family loved them. Deffinatly make extras, they are guaranteed to be eaten!"
"1","5","It was a little too sweet for my taste, but my harshest critic (my son) loved it! And no he doesn't go for anything sweet...in fact, he's not a big fan cookies/cakes. But he loved these and hailed me the best cook in the world for making them!"
"1","5","The best apple dumplings I have ever had! Hands down! I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture. I also used Best Life Butter b/c my son has food allegies. They were still FANTASTIC! Great Recipe!"
"1","5","When I saw this recipe called for Mt. Dew I had to try it. I had never made apple dumplings before this recipe and I will never look for a new one. These are amazing and very simple. I was nervous because I thought the bottoms looked very mushy when I took them out of the oven, but they tasted wonderful."
"1","5","esy to make turns out delicious. Ny husband and kids went wild over this simple to make dish."
"1","5","I have never had apple dumplings, but these are amazing! I could eat a million of them!"
"1","5","This was a HIT! My family gushed over these. I used two 8oz cans of mountain dew and thought the bottoms where a little too soft so I might go a little lighter next time."
"1","5","these are the best apple dumplings that i have ever had. and they are so easy to make. enjoy."
"1","5","I was skeptical of the mountain dew but tried this following the recipe precisely which is very simple and am glad I did. These dumplings are very tasty and my family loved them. Perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Delicious! And so so easy! These were super simple and easy to make, I made them last night for my family and the pans been scraped clean! Will definately make again and again, thanks!"
"1","5","I made these tonight. Didn't change a thing, and they were absolutely fabulous! The caramel sauce is so tasty and pairs so well with the tartness of the apples. And it passed the toughest test of all - the hubby test! Anything apple is his favorite, and he has high standards!  I love how easy this recipe is to make and eat!"
"1","5","Everyone loved these!! My new signature dessert!!"
"1","5","Sooooo good! My husband's a chef so I love to find a recipe that impresses him. This one really did the trick. I'll be making it again soon and this time with ice cream to go with it. Thanks for an easy but delicious treat."
"1","3","it was pretty good, but I wasnt liking the soggy texture"
"1","5","Sooooo easy, and so good! I used half the sugar which was plenty. I also used ginger ale once (+ a few drops of lemon), and couldn't taste the difference.  I would suggest serving with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! mmmmm :)"
"1","5","I just made this last night and it was great and deserves 5 stars!! The next time I make it, and I will make it again and again, I may try some of the modifications that others wrote. However the original recipe is just fantastic! 7/13/12 update. I have made this a few more times and made this adjustment to step 3. Put butter, sugar and cinnamon in a small saucepan and place on medium high. Once butter and sugar is melted pour in Mountain Dew and reduce liquid by half. Pour over the apple dumplings. This made more of a caramel sauce that was fantastic!"
"1","5","Incredible! This is one recipe that I can honestl;y say does not require ANY tweaking! It tasted like I spent hours on these puppies, when it only took about 5-10 minutes of 'real work'...I served the dumplings on top of a couple scoops of real vanilla ice cream...yummy! Can't wait to make again!"
"1","4","These were certainly good considering the ease of preparing them. They weren't an over the top 'wow' for me, as I was expecting from some of the reviews. I did not like that I could detect the taste of the crescent rolls so predominately. They would definitely be better served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Thanks for posting this easy, fun recipe!"
"1","5","Just made these yesterday and they were delicious. Followed the advice of others and used 3/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar and cut down on the butter to about 3/4 cup. I accidentally bought diet Mountain Dew but they were still so good! I also mixed the butter and sugar and cooked them until thickened as suggested, then added the cinnamon and vanilla. Very easy to make, and will definitely make them again!"
"1","1","My aunt gave me this recipe over twenty years ago and we have always loved it. I have reduced the butter and sugar the last few years, getting older and fatter, now I use about half of what the original recipe calls for. I also discovered that even better than mountain dew is using squirt or your local grapefruit soda. I also leave the skin on the apples, my family likes it that way."
"1","5","Works great for rhubarb, too! I was actually looking for something to do with rhubarb and this recipe was featured on the home page. Substituted a pinky-length stalk of rhubarb in place of an apple slice - was good, but not fruity enough. The Boyfriend came home with a smile and two more tubes of crescent rolls and this time I worked 3 lengths of rhubarb into the bundle - KILLER! Did a couple of apple dumplings as well - He says they taste like McDonald's apple pies...but we prefer the rhubarb....will make these again and again."
"1","5","one word AMAZING! so easy and yummy!!"
"1","1","This sounded simple so i thought i'd give it a try. It turned out looking very nice, but the only thing that was good was the apple. Too much butter and sugar, and the mountain dew made a gooey soup, making the bread soggy. Really, all i tasted was butter and sugar. So I just took out the apples and ate them without the bread. Next time i will adjust it by using much less butter and sugar, and no soda."
"1","5","SoOoOooo darn delicious :)"
"1","5","This recipe is so simple and delicious!! I halved it and almost ate the whole thing myself!! I replaced 1/2 white sugar with the brown and added cinnamin, sugar and nutmeg to the apples before rolling in dough. I can't wait to make this for the holiday's or a dinner party. Makes the house smell so good!! Try this recipe! You won't regret it!!"
"1","5","These are SO delicious! I too was skeptical because of the ease of the recipe but these are a total home run! I made sure to cook the sauce until it began to thicken and substituted about a half cup of brown sugar for the white. I also rolled the apples in the opposite direction that the recipe recommends: I started with the thick end and rolled to the pointed end, it was more aesthetically pleasing. Lastly I did my best to wrap the dough around the apple with the curve to make them look like true croissants. I served them with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled it all with caramel sauce. They looked SO fancy, no one would know how totally easy they are!"
"1","5","Great recipe! I used 3 large green apples and rolled them in cinnamon and prior to wrapping them in the crescent roll. I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, I also added 1 tablespoon vanilla to the butter sugar mixture. Also I melted the 1 cup of butter in the microwave and then added the sugar and mixed it until it had just come together as suggested by other reviews. I placed my dumplings four in a row and used only about a quarter of the bottle of mnt. dew. My final suggestion is after baking your dumplings let them sit for at least 30 minutes so that the syrup can thicken even more and they wont be so runny. This is a very simple recipe that seems very high end I highly recommend it! Great for holidays or entertaining!"
"1","5","This was so simple to make and delicious! I changed it a little - I did 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. This is a new family favorite!"
"1","5","These were ridiculously easy to make and turned out more delicious than a lot of more complex desserts I've made. I tossed my apple slices with cinnamon sugar before rolling them and then sprinkled a little more over the dumplings after pouring the melted butter mixture and soda over the top and before popping them in the oven. Turned out gorgeous with the perfect combination of soft, gooey and crunchy textures."
"1","5","OMG! I have used this site for a few years now and never left a comment till today. Seriously it is so good! I have a picky boyfriend and he even loved it....I warmed up the leftovers the next day with vanilla ice cream for his parents and it was still delicious! Careful with the mountain dew though, too much may make it soggy."
"1","5","This is the best thing ever! I didn't change anything with the recipe.....this proves that when you mix butter and sugar together, it's always going to be magical!"
"1","5","Wow this is really really good!!! I did cut the sugar done to 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. However, i think i will cut it down to 3/4 cup white and 1/4 brown next time. It is super sweet but really good.. I also only used 3/4 cup of butter.... This is a recipe that i will use over and over again... A great one for company!!!"
"1","5","This was great made as written my whole family loved it!"
"1","5","I have used this recipes many times. The last couple of times I have sprinkles a cup of dried cranberries over the top before adding the sugar mixture and soda. They sort of cook down in between the dumplings. Absolutely great!!!"
"1","5","Very easy and good!! No one will ever know that you use Mt. Dew in the recipe unless you tell them."
"1","5","I used half brown sugar, half white....delicious!!"
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe! Many rave reviews from my family. I used diet pop and it was delicious!"
"1","5","I've made these twice now as written and it is THE most delicious, satisfying dessert ever!! Last time I halved the recipe and used diet mountain dew. I think I could easily cut back on the amount of butter by a few tablespoons though. These are such a crowd pleaser and much faster than making an apple pie!"
"1","5","Like reviewers I used less sugar and butter. It turned out fabulous. Both my husband and I had two!"
"1","5","This was unbelievably outstanding"
"1","5","Easy peasy and super sweet and delicious. Big hit with the in laws!"
"1","3","These were just okay, but were very creative way to use crescent rolls. However, I did not like how the bottom of the 'dumplings' were soggy. I even cut back a little on the liquid."
"1","5","My family went crazy over these! They didn't last a night! They are absolutely irresistible! They are supper easy to make and go great with some homemade vanilla ice cream. Thank you for sharing!"
"1","5","Wonderful!!! I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the sugar, butter, cinnamon mix. Next time I will lessen the sugar as I did think it was too sweet. However it was wonderful!!!"
"1","5","These were unbelievably good and easy. The kids loved helping!"
"1","5","These are AMAZING! They probably bring me 1 step closer to a heart attack each time I eat them, but they are wonderful. I've made them quite a few times and I use Ginger Ale. They are great served warm with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","These were so tasty. My family just loved them! They had a soft crunch on the outside, and a gooey, warm, delicious filling. Definitely a keeper."
"1","5","This was unbelievable. And easy. I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and it was still delicious. Recommend. 35 minutes was enough. Watch carefully."
"1","5","These are so easy to make, and my husband and I really enjoyed them. They are delicious! When they sit for awhile and aren't hot anymore they taste just like fantastic apple pie. I didn't have Mountain Dew so I used Seven UP. Worked great! Thanks for the recipe. Will use again for sure..."
"1","5","I use half white suga n half brown. Makes the top more like a carmel coating less like apple pie."
"1","5","What can be said but PERFECTION! Amazing and so easy, served warm with some vanilla ice cream and a sprig of mint and its perfect for company"
"1","5","This has got to be one of my new found favorite desserts! SUPER easy and just melts in your mouth. Feels like I gain a pound with every bite but it is worth the extra trip to the gym!"
"1","5","So good and simple..I've shared this recipe with family members and they all loved them."
"1","5","Hands down, best recipe!! They are soooooo good."
"1","4","Easy and good!"
"1","5","Awesomely-Buttery-Deliciousness!! These are easy to make and taste great. I've made them at least 3 times already. I've shared the recipe with several friends, all of whom LOVE them. The only suggestion that I would make is to use 1/2 of the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and soda-only because I had alot of liquid left over the first time I made it. When using 1/2 the liquid is thicker, more like a syrup, and is more than enough."
"1","5","I don't know what evil genius thought of this recipe but it is unbelievable! I prepared it as directed and it was so delicious but very sweet so I may try some of the reduced fat/sugar/butter suggestions made by other reviewers next time."
"1","5","All I can say is super yummy!!!"
"1","5","easily five stars. i put the mountain dew on first, then the butter/sugar/cinnamon mix. it was EXCELLENT."
"1","5","Wow! The family thought these were great. I was like what's up with the Mountain Dew...but it was a fantastic recipe. Next time I will trim down my apples (used Lg. Granny Smith apples) and I will toss the apples in sugar/cinnamon mixture before rolling into crescent. I also will try half white, half brown sugar next time with cinnamon."
"1","5","This is one of the best dessert recipes ever. Simple but so so good!!!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness these were good! My sister-in-law had the recipe for these and we had never heard of them before. She made them last night and wow. They were so simple, but delicious. The nice thing is is that they are small, so if you just want a small dessert, these are perfect. Of course, we all had more than one!"
"1","5","yummy yummy !!! I added about a tsp of vanilla extract and I used honey crisp apples instead of granny smith because that's what I bought when I was at the apple farm. Delish!!!"
"1","5","These were outstanding ! Easier and tastier than apple pie. Great re-heated, too."
"1","5","These are sooooooo yummy! My boyfriend, whose favorite dessert is apple pie, said these were better than apple pie!! There ya have it- I'll be making these again for sure :) I did subsitute some of the white sugar with brown sugar though- soooo yummy!"
"1","5","Absolutely fabulous....we loved them!!!!"
"1","5","crazy delish! i cant believe that it tastes so good"
"1","5","These were so EASY and SO GOOD! Thanks for sharing! I even liked them cold from the fridge the next day. I will make sure I always have these ingredients on hand for a quick, but wonderful dessert. (I may turn them over halway through the baking time next time I make them, as suggested by another reviewer.)   Also, I should mention that I used reduced fat crescent rolls, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. It was great! I wasn't sure whether or not I should cook the butter/sugar until the sugar dissolves, but since the recipe didn't say to, I didn't. It turned out wonderful without that extra step."
"1","5","Delicious! I halved the recipe for our family of 5. Using review tips, I cut back on the butter and sugar, just melted the butter in microwave & poured it over dumplings, then sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top, poured Sprite between dumplings. 20 minutes, flipped then 5 minutes more. They were perfect!"
"1","5","What a GREAT dessert! However, I did change the recipe a little: I halved everything and used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar. the only thing that wasn't to my liking was the skin on the apples. Next time I'll peel them as well."
"1","5","One of the best recipes I have had the pleasure of making.WONDERFUL!"
"1","5","SO GOOD!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe last night. It was amazing! I halved the recipe, used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and I added half a teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg to the butter mixture. I used a square 8x8 pan, and I was a little nervous that there was way too much liquid between the butter and the half can of Mountain Dew. But, after baking for 45 minutes the liquid reduced a lot and after cooling for a bit it was more syrupy. They taste wonderful, but I may try cutting back on the butter, sugar and soda next time to try and save calories. They were pretty sweet as I made them."
"1","5","I made these tonight and making them thought there is no way these are going to turn out or be good for that matter but oh my goodness they are delicious!! Husband eats anything and never really goes on and on about something but these he LOVES!! They were a big hit!!"
"1","5","WOW- NUFF SAID"
"1","5","This is the most amazing, melt in your mouth dessert I've ever made. I took them to a neighborhood barbecue and they were the first dessert gone, everyone loved them and had to have the recipe! If I could give this recipe more than a 5 star rating, I would!"
"1","4","Good but think I will use less butter and maybe more cinnamon & sugar."
"1","5","Rave reviews from friends, but I do agree with many other reviewers that you can cut back on amount of butter and sugar. I used 3/4 C and 1 C respectively. In addition, I used 4 apples and quartered them."
"1","5","excellent and soooo easy. good good reviews from my tasters. 2nd time i made them, I cut the butter in half and thinned out the sauce with a little water. Also used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew since that's what I had. Excellent."
"1","4","I had no idea what to expect with these. My husband and I enjoyed them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I do wish the sauce was thicker and more like caramel. Next time I might add some caramel on top! It was a nice change up for dessert."
"1","5","Very Good, made exactly as written exept I divided the sugars between white & brown. Both husband and I thought this was a great quick dessert. I think next time I will try diet Mountain Dew."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Halved the recipe and used Diet Mtn Dew, but otherwise cooked as directed."
"1","4","Easy and delicious! Best warm. Used less sugar and butter and still wonderful"
"1","5","OMG!!! These were the best dumplings I have ever eaten. I used to work in a resturant called the Dumplin Haus where I thought they had the best. This recipe beats them hands down. I did use 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Other than that everything the same. Can't wait to eat another one, yum!!!"
"1","5","Made this for a friend's BBQ. Doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup white suger and 1/2 cup light brown sugar for each half. Added about 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 Tbsp of cinnamon after the butter/sugar mixture began to thicken. I also used 1 stick plus 2 Tbsp butter, reduced fat crescent rolls and diet Mt. Dew. It looked like the might come out soupy due to all the Mt. Dew but it baked in perfect. They came out great and I had people asking for the recipe!"
"1","5","I'll add my double-thumbs up to the list. I made them with reduced fat crescents and sprite. These are really good. The kids love them. I cut the recipe in half."
"1","5","This was a quick way to have a warm apple dessert. Simple and great tasting! I didn't know what to expect from the soda, but it all works to make a delicious treat!"
"1","5","Wow. Just wow. I halved the recipe but made mine as little open-faced pies using a large muffin pan. I pressed the dough in, put in apples and the added both liquids to each compartment. It made 6. Very, very good!"
"1","5","This was great, I used Grand biscuits, a can of Sprite, and 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar. It turned out great but next time I'll use more apple per biscuit roll."
"1","5","Recipes like this one intrigue me because the reviews are so great, but at the same time I don't want/like to eat foods high in fat and sugar and caffeine. Plus I was skeptical. I decided to reduce butter to 1/2 cup, reduce sugar to 3/8 cup, used 12 oz Sierra Mist (it has no caffeine), and I used reduced fat crescent roll dough. And it was wonderful! Yummy and so easy to make! And definitely sweet enough, even with a fourth of the sugar originally called for!"
"1","4","fantastic but hubby thought the bottom was 2 sougy not sure if i should cut back on the soda or not."
"1","5","Made this using 1-1/2 cups butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon & 9 oz Mountain Dew. I literally licked the plate it was so delish! Thank you for the recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","These are amazingly good! Just as everyone says...followed recipe exactly and added a tsp of vanilla to the syrup mixture...took these to a New Year's Eve party and they were gone within minutes!!"
"1","4","These were great, but way too sweet & buttery for my taste. Next time I would use reduced fat rolls, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, and diet mountain due. Would also cut the apple into 4's instead of 8 so there is more apple and less dough per bite. Delicious!"
"1","5","OMG! SOOOOOOOOO YUMMY!!!"
"1","5","Had this at a football party last week-end. I thought I died, and went to Heaven.......and I'm not even an 'apple' kind to person. Breyer's Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is a MUST to go with it while the dumplings are still warm. YUM!!!!!"
"1","5","I had to try it just because of the Mountain Dew. Unbelievable and so easy to make."
"1","5","Totally Awesome! Easy to make and great taste and texture. Unbelievable! Every I told to try them loved them. So try 'em!!!"
"1","5","AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! next time ill do less sugar and butter on top, or maybe just smear the tops of the dough with butter and sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon on top and slightly drizzle the soda... but they were amazing as is!!!!! (just for my own personal taste they would be better less sweet from the sugar and soda.) A MUST TRY FOR SURE!!!!!!"
"1","5","I made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it! I used Gingerale instead of Mountain Dew because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again soon!"
"1","5","Excellent!! And, I used Diet Canada Dry as the soda, because we are watching our sugar (and, more truthfully, that's all we had on hand) and they still turned out beautifully."
"1","5","Amazing! My family loved them so much!"
"1","5","OH. MY. GOD. Awesome. I also cut the recipe in half for just the hubby and I and that was plenty for the 2 of us."
"1","5","My mother found this recipe a while back and we request it over and over again now! So delicious and yummy!!! I just finished the one little one I forced myself to save from Christmas and had to come see if the recipe was on here:) Everyone should try this it can't be beat and so easy!"
"1","5","Great recipe! Just made this for a Christmas potluck and it got rave reviews. I tweaked it a bit, adding chopped pecans in with the apples, and added some vanilla and a generous amount of Bailey's (3/4 cup) into the butter/sugar mixture. I also used ginger ale instead of Mt. Dew, and it was a real crowd-pleaser. I'll definitely add this to the permanent collection."
"1","5","Made them as is....they were fantastic"
"1","5","If you are not a sugar-holic, I recommend using half the sugar for a lighter enhanced treat."
"1","5","These really were excellent. I used half a recipe of feather bisuits instead of the canned rolls. It was a great way to use up apples that weren't at their best."
"1","5","This is SO easy and has been a HUGE hit with my whole family. Even my Husband (who doesn't really like dessert) cannot resist it."
"1","2","Well, I made these last week and I can say that I did not care for them. I followed the directions to the tee...and needless to say they came out perfect on top but very doughy on bottom and very soggy...I am not a soggy type of person, but if that is the recipe you are looking for then this is the one. The taste of the ingredients was good but I did not like the texture."
"1","5","WOW, I can't believe these ingredients( mountain dew ????) make such a fabulous dessert, and so easily !! I made it once and that was the beginning . Everyone who tastes it wants the recipe and those who dont bake, want me to make it again..Thank you so much !!!"
"1","5","So good, I added 1 tsp vanilla as some reviewers stated and only had ginger ale on hand...still a wonderful family dessert!"
"1","4","Recipe is fairly easy to make and tastes pretty good for a quick version of apple dumplings. I took other's advice and modified recipe as follows; used 3 Gala apples and sliced the wedges larger, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and used sierra mist in place of mountain dew. Also used reduced fat crescent rolls. I added the soda to the bottom on the pan not on top of the dumplings to keep them from getting soggy."
"1","5","OMG....best dumplings we've ever had! Used Fuji apples, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Cut butter in half. Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!"
"1","5","Divine!!! I, too, was skeptical about the mountain dew, but it really adds a nice touch. I added orange juice once when I didn't have mountain dew, and I didn't really like how it came out at all. This recipe is perfect as it is. Perfect with some vanilla ice cream! Never lasts long and everyone always raves about it!"
"1","5","SSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good! And so easy! This is going to be a my new fall back for company, or anytime i'm needing something sweet!"
"1","5","WONDERFUL!!! We loved them!!"
"1","3","These cook really fast. I left them in for only 25 minutes and they were pretty burned. The next day, everything had hardened and I couldn't even get them out of the pan let alone eat them. I can't give a better rating until I've gotten them to turn out right."
"1","5","This is the easiest recipe ever! My family went crazy over these because they are so so good. I baked mine for 40mins and followed recipe as written...absolutely fantastic. Already emailed recipe to the rest of my family living out of state. Thanks DocsWife for such an easy, homey,yummy treat."
"1","5","easy to make and very good"
"1","5","I took this dessert to a Church Potluck and every one wanted the recipe. It was so good. Everybody loved it. I was skeptical about the Mt. Dew, but oh my, it was to die for. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","really good"
"1","5","I very rarely review, but this was the most amazing and outstanding recipe I feel that I MUST contribute. Crispty where they need to be crispty, buttery where they need softness and surprisingly so, they were not overly sweet. Really fantastic!"
"1","5","We loved this--and sooo easy to make. My only suggestion/preference was to cut the apples into larger slices and I'm glad we did that as it was more robust and zesty. Also, I accidentally picked up one roll of Crescent Rounds and they were much easier to work with."
"1","5","OH. MY!!!! Had I been able to give this recipe 5+ stars, I would! I made this last night for my family - halved the recipe since there are only four of us and it was oh so delicious! Side note: don't stress much about your sugar dissolving fully into the melted butter. If it doesn't, it still forms a nice crust on top of the dumplings. I could have easily reduced the amount of butter down from 3/4 cup to around 1/2 cup (but if you do so, be sure to also reduce the amount of sugar ). I also used apple pie spice instead of using plain cinnamon. Diet Mtn. Dew worked just as well as regular without the added sugar. Yummy!! Highly recommend!"
"1","5","Amazing!!! So easy to make and everyone loved them. I will definitely make again."
"1","5","Absolutly fabulous"
"1","5","every time i make this people want the recipe.It is so yummy."
"1","5","Easy and Deliousious :)"
"1","5","Delicious and easy, but i found it to be time consuming."
"1","5","O.k. we were skeptical....but boy were we proven wrong. This was AWESOME! A Sweeter apple would have worked too. We agreed with a previous post that stirring up the sugar/butter combo for awhile makes a delicious deeper caramel sauce. Just try and see who gets the last piece!!"
"1","5","Amazing - Janet made these for Cromer Thanksgiving, 2010. Awesome!"
"1","5","Very easy to make and yummy to eat."
"1","5","Oops hubby bought a 24 oz mtn dew and stopped me 3 oz short of pouring it all in, will they turn out ok? more cooking time? **Update - yep they turned out awesome!* Will be making these again for sure!!"
"1","5","I made this for my coworkers for a pot luck. One of my coworkers said he had to restrain himself from coming over and kissing me on the mouth. I would give this 10 stars. One change, I used 7 up instead of mountain dew. Cheers!"
"1","5","Easy and awesome!"
"1","5","Amazing!! Who knew these simle ingrediants could make such an delicious dessert. We brought this to a dinner party last night and by the end of the night there was nothing left in the dish. They were devoured. I would definatley make these again and again. Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe."
"1","3","These had good flavor but weren't quit what I was expecting. I'm not sure how to put my finger on what didn't really do it for me; it may have been the pre-made dough."
"1","5","This is amazing exactly the way it is. I read the reviews and tried it for my bookclub and it was an instant hit. I served with Breyers Vanilla ice cream and they went nuts. I've already been asked to pass on the recipe. A MA ZING!"
"1","5","Made in Seattle at Lara's. Served with tiny scoopes of vanilla ice cream. Mint leaves"
"1","5","LOVE IT!!!! I was a bit worried making these. If you are in doubt, bake up these little bundle of heaven, and you won't be disapointed. I halfed the recipe. 1/2 c. butter, 3/4 c. sugar (1/2c. white sugar & 1/4 c. brown sugar), 1 tsp. vanilla. Serve with ice cream. Husband wanted to know where I bought them at. He couldn't believe I baked them!"
"1","5","Dee-licious!! So easy and yummy with a little vanilla ice cream on top."
"1","5","This was better than expected!! Very easy too."
"1","5","These have been a family favorite for years, great stuff."
"1","5","My grandma gave me this recipe years ago & I've been making it ever since. It is delish! You could sub Sprite for the mt. dew but I don't. Perfect cold weather dessert! We've even had leftovers for breakfast the next day."
"1","5","Pleasantly surprised! I cannot stand to drink Mountain Dew, but this recipe is absolutely amazing! Needless to say I was very skeptical, but with the high rating, I just had to give it a try. I didn't alter the recipe and it was wonderful. Served them right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. Mmm."
"1","5","Wow! Yummy! Sooo good! Thank you for the recipie!"
"1","5","I took a batch of these to my stamp club meeting tonight and they went over exceptionally well. I even goofed and used only a cup of sugar, but they still came out tasting terrific. This one's most definitely a keeper."
"1","5","OMG!! Best thing I ever ate in my life! I took the recommendation of another reviewer and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added vanilla and nutmeg also. The trick is to let the butter, sugar mixture simmer until it thickens, that way it wont be soupy."
"1","5","EASY AND DELICIOUS! You could easily get away with using less sugar and butter, but this is excellent just as the recipe says to make it!!"
"1","5","Made these for a dinner party. Had to make the crescent roll dough from scratch as we can't buy pre-made here & chose to use a mix of brown/white sugar with a tsp of vanilla to intensify the flavour but they got high praise from a professional pastry chef who tried them. Next time will try lemonade instead of mountain dew but that's just personal preference. Very good."
"1","5","The hubs and kids love this recipe!! I make these at least once a week. Very good, full of flavor!!"
"1","5","Wowzers, Couldn't believe how yummy these were. Despite being horribly fattening. you have to treat yourself every now & then. My family loved it as well. Yummy treat!"
"1","5","I made this for our chucrh pot luck... I won third place out 12 ... and I made it for the first time like one hr. befored I left my house..it was a hit!"
"1","5","These were a HUGE hit! Easily one of the best desserts I've ever tasted much less made!"
"1","5","I tried this and loved it, but made a few changes. I used double the apples because I like apples and felt it needed more than one wedge. Then used only 2/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter and melted that together with some cinnamon and apple pie spice. This was a little thick but with the soda it made it very nice. This made it plenty sweet for my family. The Mountain Dew really did pull the rest of the dish together. This is a keeper."
"1","5","Ohhhh my goodness...I can't even express how amazing these are. I made them, and immediately passed it on to everyone I know because I felt bad for anyone who didn't have the recipe. The only tiny thing I did was use Cortland apples (it was all I had laying around) and I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the sugar/butter mixture. Mmmm-mmm-mmm!"
"1","5","So good and so yummy! Everyone I've made it for LOVES it!"
"1","1","These were absolutely delicious! I made them on Saturday and by Sunday evening they were all gone, and it's just myself and my husband! I passed along the recipe to my mother who called the next day raving as well! She, however, used ginger ale in place of the mountain dew. A BIG thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
"1","5","Fantastic dessert. The family loved it!"
"1","5","These were yummy! but I did use some brown sugar instead of all white sugar. Made sense to me to make them a bit more caramel flavored. Will definitely make again!"
"1","4","I felt that the earliest baking time was too long."
"1","4","These are awesome but not 5 stars. Definitely halve the butter, sugar and mountain dew and I think it would lessen the chance of the soggy bottom. They really are yummy though."
"1","5","i would give this recipe 100 stars if i could...best desert ive ever had..and ive had alot! followed derictions to a t...perfect everytime....and ive made them alot of times...cant say enough ,how delish...."
"1","5","Absolutely awesome! My boyfriend is a picky eater - and he ate half the pan!"
"1","5","I have just made this dish and OMG it's wonderful"
"1","5","Easy and great!!"
"1","5","great hot with ice cream or cold!"
"1","5","I was a little hesitant about the Mtn. Dew, but these were absolutely delicious. I halved the butter and sugar based on other reviews and used the apples from my neighbors tree, which are not Granny Smith. I will definitely make these again. I have shared the recipe with several people already."
"1","4","These tasted great! I put the butter, sugar and cinnamon on the stove and walked away from it to peel the apples, OOPS!, but when I looked, the sugar had caramelized and it was rich and golden, luckily not burned. I would make the caramel again instead of just melting the sugar and butter, but I'd watch it the next time. I poured it over the wrapped apples and poured golden ginger ale on. I dislike Mountain Dew. When I make it again, though, I would use less butter, as it was pooled around the dumplings as they came out of the oven. Served to my company, another AR member, with a little ice cream on the side. YUM!"
"1","5","These were fantastic!!!! Warm and soft on the inside yet crispy and delicious on the outside! Yummy, yummy, yummy fall treat!!"
"1","5","Great for a dumpling, a little soggy on the bottom for my taste but everyone else who ate them (and they ate ALL of them) raved over this recipe. Thank you for the admission and I love how simple and easy it is to make!"
"1","5","It is so delicious until I'm speechless! definitely will make this often!!"
"1","5","Excellent flavor! I only used 1 stick of butter and it turned out fabulous. No need for a full cup. Next time I will use less Mt. Dew. I think there was still too much juice in the bottom of the pan when it was finished cooking. It didn't thicken up like I had expected but I think if I only use 1/2 a can, it would be perfect."
"1","5","My family loved these, and I'm going to make somemore and take them to a Halloween party!"
"1","5","Outstanding. Making this for Thanksgiving instead of apple pie. So much easier and yummier."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! My family loved these."
"1","5","Completely amazing. My family members were blown away and thought these were super fancy."
"1","5","Who knew!? So good and so easy. The only thing I changed was using Honey Crisp apples instead of Granny smith because that's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Freaking awesome!"
"1","5","Awesome!!! A big hit in our neighborhood! I didn't change a thing."
"1","5","Country apply dumplings are OUTSTANDING!!! I don't mean to yell, but they are wonderful. I made 16 of them and they were all gone before the weekend was up. They taste like individual apple cobblers... so yummy! I didn't change anything! They are magnificent!"
"1","5","Unbelievable!!! Loved it and had a great time making it with my 5 year old. Next time I MAY cut back on the butter a bit as it seemed just a tad too indulgent..but it really was mouth wateringly perfect!!!"
"1","5","So easy and so delicious! As soon as I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it. Apples are great this time of year. It was almost like having my own little apple pie! Great!!!"
"1","5","These were fantastic! I wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","These are ridiculously good & so easy to make. Serve them with vanilla ice cream. Yum!"
"1","5","I call these Peach enchiladas and use fresh peaches...I also use brown sugar instead of white!"
"1","5","These are incredible - I made a pan last night for the family as a trial and then made a pan to take in to work. Everyone LOVED it! I did make one change, however, based on other suggestions - I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. Oh, and I also used a very heaping teaspoon of cinnamon! Excellent, easy recipe! THANKS!!!"
"1","5","These were just awesome! What a surprise. I have made these both with apples, and with bananas and nutella--both are excellent!"
"1","5","I have been making this recipe for a couple years and it's amazing! Truly incredible for a brunch or dessert. Only thing I've changed is adding a splash of vanilla to the sugar/butter mix. This is a must try recipe. Thnanks for posting it here!"
"1","4","Was skeptical after viewing the recipe as very easy. I halved the recipe as it was just for a small group. YUMMY.....many compliments and no one believed it was baked with mountain dew. I used a mixture of brown and white sugar and doubled the cinnamon. Will definately bake again."
"1","4","The taste is great..I..like others used 1 cup splenda and diet MT dew and used 3/4 cup of butter. Next time I will cut my butter to 1/2 cup and my sugar to 1/2 cup splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I will also try a bit of vanilla in it the next time."
"1","5","Hubby says 5 stars and I say 5 stars! That makes it a 10 star recipe in our house. We liked this better than old fashioned apple dumplings and will be having this often. Thank you!"
"1","5","These are awesome! I used 3/4 c. sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar and only 1 stick of butter to cut down on the sweetness. Perfect, will make these often."
"1","5","All I can say is WOW these are AWESOME! I did have to cut the butter, sugar and cinnamon down to 3/4 of what the recipe calls for, and it still was sweet. The pan did not last very long. Serve warm with some vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","My family and friends loved these!!!...Will be making often"
"1","5","I was afraid there was too much liquid in the pan when I put them in the oven, but VOILA! this baked quite a dish!! will make again...and again...and again....and"
"1","5","Made these for a group of Friends and they were a HUGE HIT!!!! so simple and easy to make!! basically stuff you always keep on hand too"
"1","5","WoW!!! So easy and so yummy!! I made it with Sprite b/c that was what we had at home. There was lots of sauce so if you want to cut back on butter and sugar I'm sure you could. I served ours warm with vanilla ice cream and the whole family was impressed :)"
"1","5","Wow! I had high hopes for this recipe and was not disappointed. My husband demolished 2 of them, turned to me and said they were the best thing he'd ever eaten. I only made half a recipe but next time will definitely have to make the whole one because the two of us could have eaten all 8 dumplings in one sitting. Even our baby cockatiel had to be put back in his cage because he kept running down our arms to get to the bowl. He's never done that before."
"1","5","OH MY MY MY! Talk about delicious and simple (except fighting the crescant dough sometimes). I used 3 gala apples, cut into 8ths cause that is what i had, 3 tubes crescants, 1/2 c. sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamin, 1 1/2 c. fastco brand i can't believe its not butter, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 c. fastco brand hillbilly holler soda (store brand mountain dew); poured melted butter sugar with cinnamin and vanilla on 1st, than pop, greased 15 by 10 glass cassarole pan, three rows of 8 fit perfect, 350* oven 40 minutes, turned out perfect!!!!"
"1","5","This is a new family favorite. My daughter and I couldn't believe how good this was. We actually like it better than apple pie. I will be making this again and again. It is so easy and so delicious. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","Wow! Thank you so much for this recipe. I don't bake and my kids picked a bunch of apples and I had to do something with them before they spoiled. My family loved it. I did not have a mountain dew so I used sprite instead and it was fantastic."
"1","5","I have been making this recipe for years. Great take in dish. Can easily be cut in half with small sodas. I have used any clear soda available, with wonderful results. I substite brown sugar for the white, I like the color better. I also add a dash of nutmeg or mace, whatever you would use in apple pie. Enjoy!"
"1","5","Have made with fresh apples, and peaches. Great both times. The sauce turns nice and thick."
"1","5","This recipe is always a crowd pleaser!!! It is great served with vanilla icecream and whipped topping. I also add a teaspoon of vanilla and a little Apple Pie seasoning to my butter mixture!"
"1","5","I have been making this for years and it is so good!!! Don't be skeptical of the mountain dew. I was too, until I made it."
"1","4","Surprised at the ingredients. Quick and good"
"1","5","'Oh my Goodness is right. Wow To me these were better than an apple pie any day. Made the apple dumplings, served with ice cream and topped with fruit. Will be making the dumplings often."
"1","5","This was a great recipe! I cut it in half and still turned out great. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream. I would definitely again. I think that peaches would work great also."
"1","5","Absolutely amazing!!! So Yummy!! I made a few small modifications as others had suggested...I used only 1 cup sugar (3/4 white sugar 1/4 brown sugar) and 3/4 cup butter.....my entrire family loved this. I will make this again and again!!! (And I think when I serve it I will sprink e it with icing sugar and serve with vanilla ice cream). Wow."
"1","3","Not a knock out taste in my opinion. The crescent rolls became like sponges and were soggy, just soaked up too much liquid."
"1","5","***** 5 stars Any clear and some soda will do. Even a cup of water will work. Suecc"
"1","5","I can't say anything else about these that hasn't already been said!! My favorite dessert served warm with some vanilla ice cream...YUM!"
"1","5","This was so easy to make. I took the advice of previous reviews and added a splash of vanilla. Next time I will make half since one serving is plenty and this recipes makes 16 servings....too tempting to have around."
"1","5","LOVED this recipe! The dumplings were soooo buttery and delicious! Instant favorite!"
"1","5","I've actually been using this recipe for years!!! It truly is an amazing apple dumpling recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This recipe was amazing. My husband and daughter absolutely loved it! I just wish it was a little healthier, but will definitely make again on a special occasion!"
"1","5","We loved these, even my DH who hates apple pie!"
"1","5","I only added 1/2 cup of the white sugar and they tasted great. All my kids ate them. will definitely make again."
"1","5","Oh yum! These are excellent. I even used all light/low-fat ingredients: diet soda, reduced fat crescents, Smart Balance butter, and Splenda sugar blend. Perfect with a scoop of ice cream."
"1","5","These were a big hit at my house. I was hesitant on making them at first because of the use of Mt. Dew, but it worked and they are really yummy! I've recommended this recipe to a few people."
"1","4","Very good. I use a quarter of an apple per crescent roll dough instead of an eighth, and used Sprite Zero instead of mountain dew. It was too buttery for my liking, so next time I will use less butter. Great basic recipe, and super easy! Will make again."
"1","5","This is now my go-to dessert when people come over. It's easy and mostly hands off - I put it together while dinner is cooking, it bakes while we eat and is ready to go by the time we are done. Excellent with vanilla ice cream.  I do make a few small changes: use half the butter (the sauce seems greasy when you use a whole cup), use 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white sugar, and add 1 t vanilla. This gets rave reviews every time."
"1","5","I used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar. It was plenty sweet. And I used apple juice instead of the Mountain Dew as it in so high in caffeine. These are just as good the next day if you reheat them in the microwave.."
"1","5","These were really great and simple to make. Will definitely make again. I added a little vanilla to the liquid mixture. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Everytime I make these they are gone in minutes! Great with ice cream and a must in Sept. in Washington State! So very good and EASY!"
"1","5","These were fantastic. We used the 50% larger crescent rolls to make it easier to cover the apples. If you do it that way, you'll need 3 cans since there are fewer in the pack. We also did the 1 1/2 cups sugar half and half with brown sugar cause I love brown sugar. I'm sure it would have been great just as written though. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","Very easy and very good!!Didn't change a thing!!! Awesome!!"
"1","5","So Easy, But So Yummy! My husband says they are the best things he has ever eaten. Made them exactly by the recipe and they really are wonderful!"
"1","5","THESE ARE SOOO GOOD!!!! I looked at the other reviews and decided to do 1 cup of white and 1/2 brown sugar. I almost omitted the Mountain Dew because I don't like the actual drink but wanted to stay true to the recipe. I'm glad I used it! Helps with the citris taste and helps the sugar cook down to a glaze.I served them right out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","My mother is a HUGE HUGE fan of Apple Dumplings. When I found this recipe she insisted I make it. Absolutley the closest to a restaurant we use to eat at (Furrs Cafeteria). I will add next time I will simmer the apples to soften and let them cool then roll in the dough and cook. We're not fond of firm apple desserts... A Keeper..."
"1","5","Best Dessert EVER! Very easy and tastes SOOO good! I have to make two pans or there is not enough to satisfy the masses. These are even great reheated."
"1","5","I also halved this and put it in a 9 x 9 pan. The only thing I did differently was to dip the apple wedges into the melted butter and then into the cinnamon sugar before rolling them up in the crescent dough. I mixed up what was left and poured that over the top. I have to say that these were wonderful. I'm having my sister over for dinner tomorrow night and I'm making these again! Very nice recipe."
"1","5","Seriously yummy and sooooo easy... ive been getting requests to make this over and over!"
"1","5","Delicious, fast and easy to make. Used Fresca as I didn't have Mountain Dew, threw raisins on top and took the advice of others and used white and brown sugar. Served warm with cinnamon ice cream. This is an easy dish for potluck or party. I will definitely make again!"
"1","5","This is SO good! Its so easy that its gotta be a sin! Served this hot with ice cream and a little whip cream..AMAZING! My husband couldn't stop saying 'WOW!' I made it exactly as written. I don't think I'll change a thing the next time I make it!"
"1","5","This is easy and yummy. I confess that I cut the butter and sugar and only used 3/4 of the Mountain Dew (I had a few sips:) It was one sweet treat!"
"1","5","This is one of the best and simplest recipes ever!!Its great in the morning or anytime. When you make these for company you look like quite the cook!!! Usually at about 30 minutes into baking I take them out and pour sauce over them to prevent them from getting too brown. The last 2 times I made them I used brown sugar instead, and it seems to thicken/carmelize the sauce better. But either way they are 5 stars!!!!"
"1","5","Huge hit in my home this morning! Easy to make on a busy morning and even the kids loved it. Made only 1 change and that was 1/2 brown sugar /white sugar."
"1","5","This is absolutely amazing!!! Even my picky husband who will not touch fruit loved this so much he called us the new 'Apple Dumpling Gang'. A friend of mine gave this to me; she is a dietician so she gave it as listed in the diabetic version, and it was still scrumptious!!! This is the easiest dessert you'll make, especially for the flavor factor - it is scrumptidillyicious!!!!"
"1","5","all i can is WOW!!! they were all gone in seconds ;) i made half the amount and did a few changes though like some other reviewers, i mixed 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, added 1 tsp of vanilla to the sugar, i didnt add the cinammon i just sprinkled it on top of the dumplings :)"
"1","4","My husband loves these - and so do my kids. They are really a unique dessert. Very sweet - depending on the apple (I didn't always use Granny Smith), I think it's possible to cut back a bit on the sugar. But, I've made this twice - it's great for apple season."
"1","4","I made these and did not follow the recipe; they were ok but it was probably my fault they weren't better... I'll try them again when I have the Mt.Dew. Canned lemonade was not good! I didn't care for the soggy bottoms either!"
"1","5","I make this every Christmas morning and it's always a hit! The pan is empty almost as soon as I pull them out of the oven! EXCELLENT!"
"1","5","really good! dont skimp on the butter n sugar like i tried the 2nd time i made this.. it tasted awful!"
"1","4","I made these for a potluck and they were the hit of the evening. People were making a point of taking me aside to tell me how amazing they thought the desert was. They are really sweet though. I like my deserts, but these are quite sweet. The second batch I cut 1/2 cup of sugar and they were better. Next time I'd try something less sweet than Mountain Dew."
"1","3","These were just ok. A friend gave me this recipe and raved about it. I personally thought they were too sweet and I eat cupcakes for breakfast. I wish I had ice cream. I think that would have cut the sweetness and made these better in my eyes. Worth trying once, but I think I'll look for another recipe."
"1","5","MMM warm buttery goodness! Nothing else needs to be said."
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! Easy to make and beyond tasty. I did use 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar. Have also used diet mountain dew and can't taste the difference. One thing that I also do is to coat the apple slices in more cinnamon & some splenda. This adds so much more flavor without extra calories. Have made this at least 10 times in a couple of months! thanks"
"1","5","So easy and so good!"
"1","5","Instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving desert I made these. They were incredibly delicious. I used half the sugar and butter that the recipe called for and they turned out perfect!!!"
"1","2","I was a little apprehensive after reading this recipe, but it seemed too easy to turn down. The top turned out nice and crispy, but the bottom... My husband made a joke about eating snails, and his description wasn't off. It tasted great- the consistency was awful."
"1","5","Wow, what a find!! These are amazing. We divided them and placed each into a paper muffin liner, and took them to a potluck. Everyone who was lucky enough to get one raved!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness, this is soooo decadent!! I'll make this again but I think the next time I will try to cut down on the butter and sugar.....or lose five pounds first. :0) My Family loved it too."
"1","5","I made this for a church potluck it was the 1st desert to dissapear, everyone raved about them! I didnt have mountain dew I had Gingerale and did the other half as apple cider 6 OZ each. I also sprinkled pecans on the them, they came out fantastic!"
"1","5","Holy Cow! So Good! Easy to make and a huge hit! Not for those on a diet, but you won't regret it!"
"1","5","so yummy. I couldn't believe how easy these were to make. I found the dumplings to be very rich and indulgent with all the butter that is used, so I only allowed myself to have one or two, and ended up giving the rest away."
"1","5","Yes the recipes sounds a little weird but is actually really great! I followed the changes that other people suggested and cut back the sugar and used brown sugar. I also used gingerale instead of Mt. Dew. They taste great with a wonderful sauce. Have passed this recipe on to my friends."
"1","5","These were absolutely delicious and so easy to make! Taste like they take a lot more time than they actually do! Will definitely make again."
"1","5","Wow...just made these...ate one and having a tough time not eating the whole panful.....halved the recipe .....will cut back on the sugar a bit.....now have 5 more cans of Mountain Dew left, so will be making these very often."
"1","5","Okay so I have made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe and yes the dumplings were covered about 1/2 way up with the butter and soda mixture (and it was a lot of soda) but they cooked up fine and as expected the tops were beautiful golden brown and the bottoms were not so golden but they were not doughy at all they were cooked through. On the second batch I used the 'bigger' crescent rolls and about 3 apple wedges per roll, I also drizzled the apples with caramel and added chopped pecans to each dumpling. I cut out the soda completely and drizzled orange juice over each one. The end result- WONDERFUL! I took a spoon and spooned the thick gooey glaze from the pan over them served them warm with vanilla bean ice cream, what more can I say. They were good the first time but with the changes they were superb."
"1","5","Wow! I read this recipe, and like most, thought that Mountain Dew and apple dumplings did not work together. I was wrong...I tried this recipe the other night and it was delicious. I added a teaspoon vanilla to the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture and they were excellent! I would recommend anyone to try this recipe as a quick treat, partnered with a little vanilla ice cream. The kids, the husband and the mother-in-law loved it!!!"
"1","5","I made a double recipe of this for a dinner at our church and everyone was asking for the recipe! In half the dumplings I put a small amount of cream cheese (I used about 4oz of cream cheese spread out in 16 dumplings) and they was also a hit."
"1","5","I have never seen a recipe of the day get over 2 pages of reviews in 1 day, so I knew I had to try the recipe. Like most I added brown sugar. When I first put them in the pan I was worried that I had done something wrong. The only thing that I did wrong was not trying this sooner. I would give it more stars if I could. This is a keeper for sure."
"1","2","I supposed this is good if you don't have time to make pie crust - but just no comparison to REAL apple dumplings - sorry."
"1","4","Good but almost too sweet. Next time I will probably lower the sugar. Easy to make."
"1","5","I was a little skeptical about the mountain dew.. but it turned out great! The kids even liked it. Easy and delicious. My son loved them so much he asked to bring one to his teacher the next day!"
"1","5","This is one of the best apple desserts I have ever made. You don't taste the Mountain Dew, it just combines with the other ingredients to make a delicious sauce. I love cinnamon-sugar so I sprinkled some on the inside of each crescent roll before I rolled it up. So simple, you could make it anytime, but special enough to serve guests as well. Excellent served warm with vanilla ice cream. Thanks so much for this recipe, I will make it often."
"1","4","I rated this dessert 4 stars, but it could definitely be 5 stars with a few tweaks. I cut the recipe in half because I was making this for my husband and kids. I also used Lobo apples because that's what I had on hand. I messed this up a little bit in that I melted the butter in the microwave and added the sugar and cinnamon, but it would have worked out much better if I'd done it on the stovetop and melted the sugar (with a touch of water) and then added the butter. I also wish that I'd used half an apple for each. As it was, I used 1/4 apple per crescent roll, but it would have been tastier with 1/2 an apple; I also wish that I had used more than 1/2 can of Mountain Dew. Anyway - the end result was very, very good (perhaps a bit too sweet for us, so maybe less sugar next time) but I will defintely make this again."
"1","5","These were a huge hit. I had to use a different type of baking apple which was a bit softer than a granny smith. Next time i'll make sure I get granny smith apples because i did think the apple kind of disappeared inside because it was a softer apple. I used gingerale instead of mountain dew - i imagine using mountain dew would make it even sweeter but i thought it was sweet enough already. Overall a great recipe and i will make it again & again!"
"1","5","These were absolutely wonderful! I have made several times and get rave reviews! Plus it is so easy to make. Will definitely make again! I have also cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 baking dish."
"1","5","These were so good! The ingredient list seems improbable, but we were pleasantly surprised with how great they really were. I would probably cut back a little on the sugar next time -- just my personal preference -- but the rest of the family had no complaints. Served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and they were in heaven. Definitely will make these again. UPDATE: Have made these several times, always cut sugar by 1/4 to 1/2, and even used 3/4 c. butter, still very good - actually, we liked them better!"
"1","5","What a great recipe! Quick, easy, and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! Yum!"
"1","5","This is the best! So easy and soooooo Good!"
"1","5","So very good and so very easy to make! These were a hit in our home. Thanks!"
"1","5","This is soooooo good! What a delicious dessert for the fall season. Will make it all the time!!!"
"1","5","All I can say is WOW!! Taste is absolutely wonderful. Takes LESS THAN 20 minutes to make!! I could not believe how good it was. I didnt think it was too sweet, apple dumplings are suppost to be sweet. My three kids, my husband and I all loved them!!"
"1","5","YUM!! I changed half of the white sugar to brown, as some of the reviews suggested. My friends were licking their plates and asking for more!"
"1","5","Easy & Tasty! I used diet Mountain Dew. I will make this again."
"1","5","Just like everyone else said. These are magnificent no matter if you use diet, cut the sugar or even the butter. It's almost like they can't be ruined. Delicious.I cut butter and sugar by 1/3 each and used brown sugar instead of white. Used diet cherry 7up cuz that's what I had in fridge.Perfect texture, great pie flavor and presentation was a nice fallish golden brown. A keeper!"
"1","5","All I can say is OMG these are insanely delicious. I only used 1 apple lol as it was all I had but after reading this recipe for wks I had to try them. Actually 1 apple was fine for me and my daughter in a little baking dish. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and I used Ginger Ale as I didn't have any Mt Dew. They smelt wonderful in the oven they puffed up so nice with all that cinnamon sugar goo on top and juicy apple pieces inside the pastry. Wow I ate allmost the whole dish myself. I sent my daughter over for vanilla icecream they were absolutely delicious served warm what a wonderful new fall treat heck any time of treat for me now thank you to whoever posted this easy and wonderful recipe I don't like complicated recipes with lots of ingrediants this one is perfect for that apple pie craving and don't forget the ice cream and a drizzle of the brown sugar carmel on top omg amazing... Tammy"
"1","5","Nothing this easy to make should taste this good! I have to admit that I first tried this recipe for the 'no way that could work' factor -- Mt. Dew as a baking ingredient? -- but it does. These are better then the apple dumplings in the bakery! Thank you for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Oh My Gosh I made it for my husband, but it looked so good, when it came out of the oven, and smelled fantastic. I just had to try it. I almost licked the plate clean it was that good. I can hardly wait for him to try it when he gets home. Thanks for posting will definetly be making this again, and again."
"1","4","I haven't ever made or had apple dumplings,but when I saw that these were made with Mt.Dew I just had to try them.Followed the recipe,but added a touch more cinnamon than what was called for,and I'm glad I did.My daughter and I both felt like it still needed a bit more,so next time I'll use 2 tablespoons.And I will also cut back on the liquid b/c when after cooling down it never thickened up.I thought they were much better tasting after they had cooled to room temperature. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","WOW!!! I literally closed my eyes as I savored the first bite of this delicious dessert. I served it hot and with vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!! We were all blown away! It was so rich and buttery! Next time, I'll probably cut the sugar, butter, and dew in half and I'm sure it will be just as good but with half the fat. Will MOST DEFINETELY make again and again!! FANTASTIC RECIPE!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","Really easy to make and it was really good, I used diet Mountain Dew and it worked well, will certainly make these again!!"
"1","5","OMG These are so good the whole pan was gone in like 15 minutes LOL! Even my wife who hates dumplings Loved these little bites of heaven i think you could reduce the butter and it would still be really great to make these a little less sinfull but you have got to try these if you have never tryed them they are so simple to make!"
"1","5","It's hard to imagine a recipe that EVERYONE loves & rates 5 start--until you try this one!!! These dumplings were incredible & I still can't believe how simple they were to make! All the fortunate 'testers' loved them--requested more and/or the recipe. One person is even planning to make them for a fund-raiser at the Apple Festival! As suggested, I reduced sugar & butter, used Granny Smith apples. Thanks docswife for a delicious, simple fall treat!"
"1","5","These are the best, and so very easy to make. I made half the recipe and it worked out fine. It's a good thing I didn't make the full recipe, because they were so good, I'm sure we would have devoured them in one sitting."
"1","5","How in the world can crescent dough end up tasting like pie crust? Well, I don't know how but it did. I used 7-Up instead of Mountain Dew and they were still awesome. I would consider cutting back a 1/4 - 1/2 c. on the sugar, just because they were almost too sweet for me!"
"1","5","OMG! These were the bomb! I used Sierra Mist instead. I didn't have any Mt. Dew. Next time I'm going to spinkle the crescent rolls with cinnamon sugar before I roll up the apple slice. I served them hot over a scoop of vanilla ice cream. To make them truly sinful squirt caramel topping on top!"
"1","5","THESE ARE GREAT! The Mtn. Dew had me skeptical, but once I tried the finished product, I could not have been happier! It was easy to make, tasty, and something different from the normal apple crisp I always make. I loved it loved it loved it! Also, substituted macoun apples for the granny smith, still came out great."
"1","5","My husband who is not the greatest baker made this recipe with no problems. he forgot to peel the apples first and it still was an excellent dessert. This will definitely be a staple for dinner parties...thanks for sharing."
"1","5","Simple, delicious, ooey, gooey, tasty, and all other adjectives that describe, something that is easy to fix, and tastes great. Good warm with vanilla ice cream. Good cold, good room temperature. Just good. Oh, did I say they were good? Well they are."
"1","5","Sooooo goooood. I used 1/2 cup of white and brown sugar and about 8 oz. of mountain dew. I poured the soda in the pan around the dumplings and poured the butter and sugar mixture over the top. I also sprinkled the tops of the dumplings with a little cinnamon. Absolutely fabulous!!!! Five stars for the base of this recipe!"
"1","5","These were awesome. I did use half brown sugar and Diet Mountain Dew. I am sure they would be great no matter what. The Original Crescent Rolls were better than the Buttery, but both were still good."
"1","5","Hubby took one bite and said these were like 'mini apple pies'. I used 1/4c. brown sugar and 1/2c. white sugar, stirring until the mixture thickened a bit. Served with vanilla frozen yogurt."
"1","5","This was delicious! Even substituting reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/2 cup Splenda, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and diet Mtn. Dew. I did use real butter, but only one stick instead of two. I think two would have made the sauce a little too greasy. This is excellent served with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. Thanks docswife for a great recipe!"
"1","4","This was a vry simple recipe to prepare and was quite tasty. I definitely recommend a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Also, I found that I needed to bake the dumplings a bit longer since they were still crunchy after 30 minutes."
"1","5","Perhaps one of the best recipes I have found in a long time and now a permanent part of 'favorites' section. I made the recipe exactly as written. My entire family loved and asked for more! Served hot with vanilla ice cream. YUM!"
"1","5","Made two batches, first was the normal way which from friends reactions was awesome, then another using splenda, diet dew and promise, low-fat crescent rolls with using pam to grease the pan and it also was really really good and about 1/4th the calories and fat. We'll make again as was really easy to do, Only suggestion I can make to add is use smaller apples as the larger wedges will not be completely covered by the dough when rolling up but for us that was just fine."
"1","5","Oh my goodness! This is absolutely delicious! And it is pretty to serve! The only changes I made were I used diet Mountain Dew, and reduced the sugar a little, using equal parts white sugar and brown sugar. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream on top and drizzled some of the syrup from the baking pan onto the ice cream. This is a keeper! I have never reviewed a recipe before, even though I use Allrecipes often but this one I had to write a review for because it is out-of-this-world wonderful!"
"1","5","Wow! These were incredible! The apples nearly dissolved into the pastry. I didn't change a thing. Will definitely make again!"
"1","5","These were not the best things I have ever eaten but I am going to go ahead and give them five stars because they were pretty good and they were VERY easy to make!"
"1","5","Completely Awesome! Who knew putting mountain dew on dumplings would be so good!? I was confused, but the other reviews were so favorable, so I had to try it. I did cut my apple slices into halves and used 3 halves in each roll, since I used 3 smaller apples than what the recipe called for. Best served warm with vanilla ice cream of course!"
"1","5","Absolutely fantastic with ice cream (Dreyers apple pie ice cream was super) and deserves more than 5 stars for ease. Looking forward to making it for company...definitely good enough."
"1","5","These were wonderful. My taste-testers didn't have enough thumbs to point up. I used diet 7-up, which tasted fine, but I think that in the future I will remove the cooked dumplings and thicken the sauce a bit before serving. What I especially liked that although some of the dough ripped a little, it didn't matter."
"1","5","This is very good and can easily be made lower calorie with the use of 1/2 Splenda and sugar, reduced fat Crescent Rolls and with Diet Mountain Dew. Some of the larger pieces of apple were still a little 'al dente,' but I'm not sure that's a real problem. It may have browned quicker than the apples could cook. This is easy recipe which will get rave reviews and will appear to have been a lot more work than it really was! Who knew you could cook with Mountain Dew?!"
"1","5","I thought this recipe was very, very good, and very, very easy. I made this to take to a brunch today, and everyone raved over it. Several ladies asked for the recipe. The only changes I made was cutting the apples in 1/6ths instead of 1/8ths, and adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the butter/sugar/cinnamon after I took it off the stove. I also made a diabetic version, using Splenda and 1 1/2 Tbsps. of 'real' sugar, and diet Mountain Dew. It was very good, also. The simplicity of this dish compared to the flavor rates it ***** in my book!"
"1","4","pretty good. i halved the sugar and it is still really too sweet for my taste. i think i'd use about 1/2 cup next time. i also used 1/2 cup of butter and it was plenty buttery. the thing that i don't love about it, is that i could taste the soda in it. i'm not a soda drinker, so i didn't like that. if i made this again, i'd leave out the soda and pour apple juice or something else over it instead."
"1","5","Looks very impressive. Beautiful brown crust. Got rave reviews. Great recipe!!!"
"1","5","There's not much I can add based on the great feedback of reviewers. I have to watch the fat for father in law, so modified as follows: Used one apple and one can reduced fat crescent rolls. Melted 1/4 stick lower fat butter. Added only 1/4 c regular sugar and have a packet of Truvia natuaral sweetner. I added two ounces of the six diet Mountain Dew to the sugar to create a thinner syrup. Poured over the bundles then added the rest of the Dew. Baked for the full amount of time, and just sampled after lunch. Father in Law and hubby both ate two, and this was after they finished huge turkey burgers. Can't wait to share this super easy recipe with my always-busy daughter!"
"1","5","the best thing i've ever put in my mouth! OMG. i didnt want it to end, i was getting depressed when i was almost finished!!!! i did cut the apples into a little bit smaller wedges, and put about 3 in each roll. heavenly...."
"1","5","Oh my goodness!! These are beyond good, in my husbands words 'Simply Excellent'!!! So easy to make and just delicious."
"1","5","wow. these are amazing! A little sweet, i would cut the sugar just a little bit next time but otherwise, they were amazing!"
"1","5","This was AMAZING. I made some changes to make it healthier and lower in sugar- I used reduced fat crescent rolls, substituted Splenda for the sugar, and used Diet Mountain Dew. You couldn't tell, they were delicious. Thank you for the recipe, I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","This was a BIG hit at my neighborhood Octoberfest party. Despite lots of other fantastic foods/desserts, not a bit of this was leftover--a winner! Everyone asked for recipe. I added a tsp of vanilla and as other reviewers, used a mixture of white/brown sugar. Not sure why Mountain Dew--but it works. Yummy!!"
"1","5","Made for dessert last night and hubby loved it. Taste like a mini apple pie. Good company dish."
"1","5","Fantastic!!! This recipe definitely lives up to all the positive reviews. Like many others, I used half brown and half white sugar and added vanilla to the sugars."
"1","5","I would typically choose most any other dessert over a fruit one, but man, oh man, this was so good. You could probably cut back on the sugar, but it was just right with a scoop of ice cream!"
"1","4","Wow! these were great! I only gave 4 starts because I did make some minor changes. I cut the recipe in half because it's just my husband and I, I used canned biscuits instead of croissants, I did like a few others suggested and used 1/2 white sugar 1/4 brown I also added nutmeg with the cinnamon and it was perfect!! My husband loved them! I will definitely make these again!!"
"1","5","If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!! i JUST made these, they put me in HEAVEN!!! I now nominate myself to prepare Thanksgiving dessert ;)"
"1","5","These are fantastic! My Boys Scout sons have been making these in a dutch oven for years."
"1","5","These are the easiest and best tasting apple dumplings! My grandma gave me this reciepe years ago, and I had forgot what all went into them, except the Mt.dew or Mello Yello! They are really good hot with vanilla ice cream on top! The perfect fall treat!!!"
"1","5","All I can say is, 'Holy !' This is just so easy and so wonderful. I made it for my family, but now I want to make it for someone else!!! Thank you SO much!"
"1","5","delicious! The only thing I did differently was, instead of mountain dew, I used this mexican lime soda called jarritos because the store didnt have mountain dew. But, I tasted it and it tasted very similar to mountain dew, if not, it tasted better. Also, I did cut down the recipe, but not by half. I just cut it down by about a quarter. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 and, instead of 1 cup of butter, I used 3/4 cups and it came out perfect. Serve it with whipped cream and its delicious!"
"1","5","SO good. It's weird that Mt. Dew was in the recipe, but somehow it works! We ate two of them for one dessert and were sufficiently STUFFED! Great recipe for guests - mine loved them!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious. I also added a tsp. of vanilla. Other than that, no changes needed."
"1","5","What a surprise, these were absolutely wonderful. Not sure what the Mountain Dew does, but it works. Will use some brown sugar next time."
"1","5","the best dessert I have ever made!!"
"1","4","After reading the previous reviews I made some changes by cutting the soda in half and using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. My family raved over the results and we actually made them twice in the same week. They reheat nicely and go well with vanilla ice cream."
"1","4","These were good, but next time I will probably only use half of the butter. I thought they were way too greasy from the butter."
"1","4","Few ingredients, easy and tasty my kind of treat! Followed recipe exactly and enjoyed."
"1","5","YUMMY! Easy to take to a get together. Great with cool whip!"
"1","5","OMG! These are so simple and the flavors are so complex. I must take these home to mom, the ultimate baker. Even my son said he didn't want any, but when I got him to try just a little, he said they were awesome and he looks forward to eating some in the morning for breakfast."
"1","5","This is awesome!! I followed the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing, unless I wanted to cut the calories some. It is a fun dish to make with your little ones too. We all thought it was even better next day! I will be making this often!"
"1","5","I was a little skeptical about this but it turned out lovely! I only made 1/2 the recipe and wish I'd mmade the full one! I used 1/2 C. of splenda and 2 T. of splenda brown sugar and added a little vanilla also, I think I could use a little less splenda next time. The sauce was so good, you really wanted to pick up the bowl and lick it. It was even better the next day."
"1","5","Simple quick and delicious. Serve with or without ice cream for a delicious, if not healthy, desert."
"1","4","Very easy and pretty good taste-wise. I could've used something crunchy with it. Maybe some pecans. Also, the bottoms ended up pretty squishy while the tops were hard. That was mostly okay though, because it added some contrast. The apples turned into mushy applesauce."
"1","5","I made this recipe as is and it was very good. Great easy desert. My hubby is begging for it again!"
"1","5","These not only are delish but they look like you spend a whole lot of time on them. My family gobbled them up in no time!"
"1","5","These were wonderful! I don't normally make things that aren't 'homemade', but my kids wanted me to make these and they said they were better than all other desserts..."
"1","5","Fantastic with splenda, sugar reductions, and the original recipe! I LOOOOVE this!"
"1","5","Sooo easy and quick! Taste great too!"
"1","5","This is an awsome recipe and it is just as good if you substitute nectarines for apples."
"1","5","Zowie these are good!! Hubby was beside himself with pleasure! Way too good considering how quick, easy and cheap they are! Followed the recipe exactly but now feel a little guilty in light of the fat/calorie content. Will try reducing those next time."
"1","4","My family liked these very much. I did use only 1 cup of sugar."
"1","4","This was good, I used ginger ale, I don't know if it made any difference."
"1","5","I'll chime in like so many other reviewers - my husband LOVED them! (I couldn't have any due to an allergy.)"
"1","5","Oh. My. Gosh. These are heavenly. I have made them three times in the last two weeks and no one in my family can get enough of them! The only thing I change was to use 7Up instead of the Mountain Dew since that was what I had on hand."
"1","5","Easy, quick, and absolutely delicious! Didn't use as much Mt. Dew as the recipe calls for, and they still turned out great. The only negative is I've probably gained 20 lbs from eating them today! :) YUM!!"
"1","4","These were actually really good. I was skeptical of the mountain dew, but they turned out great!"
"1","5","These are a SUPER simple solution to last minute guests. They are way more tasty than you would imagine, too."
"1","5","I've seen these a couple of times with the others pictures. And there pictures looked so good. A picture tells a thousand words. These are great. I used a 1/2 c. of splenda, and 1 c. of brown suger.[not packed]. Did the rest the way as written. Was worried about the Mountain Dew, I don't know;they were great. A wounderful quick dessert or anytime. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","these are soooooooo gooooooooooooood!"
"1","5","outstanding"
"1","5","Definitely a keeper recipe. So easy and delicious! I love how the butter and Mt. Dew caramelize together -- it's like a wonderful hybrid of a Cinnabon and apple pie. I followed directions to a T, next time I will add vanilla."
"1","5","These were easy and delicious! I used 2 medium-sized Granny Smith apples but only 1 can of crescent dough - so they were a little more apple and slightly less dumpling. There was still PLENTY of gooey dumpling and my husband LOVED them. I surprised him with them last week (apple anything is his favorite) and the whole pan was gone in one evening!"
"1","4","I really thought I was going to love these, but for me they were just OK. Way too sweet, not enough tartness (and I used a really nice and tart Granny Smith). Maybe a tsp or so of lemon juice would help?"
"1","5","This recipe is super! I did like other reviewers and reduced the butter to 3/4, although next time I will reduce to 1/2. I also did half sugar and half brown sugar. I had no problem with the amount of liquid, and I just poured the Mt. Dew right on top! I couldn't tell from the recipe or other reviewers if it was good to eat hot or cold. A lot of people mentioned ice cream, so we ate it hot with ice cream. It was good - but the next day, eating it cold was super fabulous! The liquid makes a perfect syrup, and not in a butter fat gel type of way. This is a keeper!"
"1","4","Very tasty, however recipe as written made way too much liquid. Dumplings came out soggy and mushy on the bottoms. Will halve the recipe for the sauce in the future."
"1","5","OMG!!! These are so awesome!!! I have never had apple dumplings, but I think I will be making them alot from now on!"
"1","5","This one is great and EASY!!! perfect with vanilla ice-cream.  NOTE: You can make it with Diet MD and Splenda and it is GREAT - sauce isn't as thick, but still very yummy!"
"1","5","Yum! I used Sprite instead and poured around edges instead of over the top."
"1","5","Oh my gosh. So delicious and sinfully rich. Per suggestions I used half brown and half regular sugar and added some vanilla. I also halved the recipe.   I served it with ice cream. This was fantastic and so easy to make. Only needed three servings for my two kids and me, so we have three left over (based on the 1/2 recipe). I'm wondering if the leftovers will make it until tomorrow night!"
"1","5","I had this today prepared by my Grandmother but she used 7 up instead of Mt. Dew and it was outstanding. This has to be one of the best tasting deserts I have ever eaten."
"1","5","I have been making these ever since my best friend gave her recipe to me. This is the easiest way to impress company!! :)Super easy and delicious! My husbands favorite dessert."
"1","5","You have to try this! We're not big apple fans, but my Mother in Law dropped off a bag of apples at out house. My husband was digging into it right out of the oven! My kids loved it too. We served it with Vanilla ice cream and some chopped, toasted pecans sprinkled on top. Yum, yum!!"
"1","5","I made this recipe one day last week and the entire pan was gone in minutes. All three of my 'boys' loved them! I did use 1/2 the butter (and used light), substituted equal for the sugar, and used Diet Mountain Dew, just because we watch our sugar and fat intake, but no one complained! I made another batch 2 days ago and they were gone just a quick! Very easy to make and DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","I make these all the time. They are amazing. Haven't met a person that doesn't like them. Great recipe."
"1","5","This is so easy and Yummy. I cut the recipe in half and it worked just as well. I reduce the amount of sugar and butter alos and it is still wonderful."
"1","5","Wow! Made this recipe as written except used lemon lime soda instead of mountain dew. My Georgia raised man LOVED it...couldn't believe it was crescent rolls! Wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","This was absolutely unbelievably good. I followed the suggestions of others and poured the butter, sugar cinn. mixture on top and the mt. dew around the dumplings. I served this to an over night guest and had to fight her to keep her from taking all the leftovers home with her! I was wary of the addition of mt.dew, but was so very pleased with the outcome. Next time I'll probably cut the sugar a bit, but, as is, this recipe is one of the best I've tried from this website."
"1","5","I have one of the few husbands around that does not really care for apple pie. When he tasted these dumplings, he became an apple lover. Said I can make these anytime. Since he is diabetic, I did use both white and brown sugar Splenda. Will try diet 7-Up next time to cut sugar further. Added a little apple pie spice and nutmeg to the syrup. Scattered chopped pecans on top and think I will put these in the syrup next time. Give it five stars from my husband and me!!"
"1","5","These smelled so good when they came out of the oven! I was hoping they would taste just like they smelled. They tasted BETTER! I was afraid my dough-phobic husband wouldn't like them. Unlike me, he doesn't like anything doughy and with all the liquid, I was afraid he may not like these. My husband thinks this is the best dessert I've ever made! Yippee! I found a gold mine! And it was so easy..."
"1","5","Made these last night and they were the hit of dinner. People could not get enough. Thanks for a great recipe"
"1","5","The best!! i'm still licking my fingers...."
"1","5","My hubby couldn't eat these fast enough! He loved them. Kept looking for more. Made exactly as written...FABULOUS!"
"1","5","These taste like mini apple pies, they're awesome. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and used sprite vs Mt. Dew. I didn't think it was too sugary, so not sure why some people are halving the sugar. Next time I'd like to take one person's advice and coat the apple slices with sugar and cinnamon before wrapping them in the dough."
"1","4","This is a simple and very tasty recipe. Glad that I read some of the others suggestions, such as cutting back on the sugar. I used half brown half white sugar, cut the apples in slices and tossed with small amount of cinnamon and sugar before wrapping. I had no trouble wrapping the apple slices, and liked the texture of the apples this way. I used a diet fresca. I will make this again. Thanks!"
"1","5","These are the best! I have made these several times but reduced the amount of sugar and soda each time because it just didn't need that much. I used some Sprite the last time and I loved the flavor of that better than Dew. I have made this with different types of apples and it is always good, but the Granny Smith tastes the best."
"1","5","What a delicious and easy treat. We did alter the recipe slightly for our diet by using 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 can diet mountian dew. We also rolled the apples in cinnamon before wrapping them in the dough."
"1","4","I'll admit, I just used this recipe as a base; I rolled apples (with cinnamon) in crescent rolls, poured melted butter on top and sprinkled more cinnamon and sugar. Came out perfect for the use (classroom apple party). Maybe I'll try the sauce sometime, but I don't think it's necessary, they were a great treat without!"
"1","5","I needed a recipe for an apple desert contest at work so I tried this for the first time and won 1st place!!! Everyone loved it. Much better served out of the oven though (mine were cold but still good). There were a little gooey on the bottom but I just put them on a sheet of tin foil and let them firm up a bit and they were perfect. Thanks!!"
"1","5","This has got to be the most delicious apple desert I have ever eaten! I followed the reciped exactly except that I used small Gala apples and I used 1/2 apple per crescent roll. It worked out great & had lots of apple inside. It was great with icecream but also wonderful all by itself and a big hit with everybody. Yum!"
"1","5","MMMM! These dumplings are delicious! We only had butter pecan ice cream to serve on top which turned out to be even better than vanilla. I also used canned biscuits rather than crescent rolls. A+"
"1","4","I also halfed the surgar, butter, and mt. dew and used extra large biscuit dough...it was so good... this one is a keeper!"
"1","5","These were so good!!!! They are so simple to make, I made them for my family and they were licking the bowls. I did cut down the butter and sugar as suggested in other reviews and they came out perfect. I will definately make them again."
"1","5","I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a hit with everyone. It is easy and simple. Not for those who are watching their waistline."
"1","4","I really liked these and made some of the changes others have suggested. I did think they were a little sweet. I am making them again, this time with less sugar."
"1","5","this was very good..  I didnt remove the liquid and thought it was just fine... yes it made it a little soggy on the bottom but was nice to spoon it to the top of it when serving leftovers."
"1","5","My husband loved it!! So easy to make."
"1","5","Classmate and I made these last night for fun. Wow-turned out pretty darn good...probably just very fattening! We cut out 1/2 cup of sugar and used Sierra Mist (b/c we didnt' have Mt. Dew). Turned out wonderful, I will mkae this again and try to make it lowfat."
"1","5","I made this as part of a Thankgiving Dinner (Cornish Hens) and this was the biggest hit, just a perfect dessert. Served with a scoop of ice cream, YUM."
"1","5","the family thought this was not going to taste right because of the mt dew, but after tasting it they thought it was a real winner."
"1","2","I think that it tasted ok. The cresent rolls made it taste a little 'fake' per say. Also, I halved the recipe and did everything to a T and the dish would turn out rock hard if I left it in the pan to long or it would stick to the plate that I had it sitting on. But if you ate it right away then it was soggy. I made it more than once and everytime I made it the same things kept happening. Not a favorite."
"1","5","Easy, rich and very good. Would cut back on butter, sugar and maybe the Mt Dew by small amount. Keeper recipe."
"1","5","Excellent! Fast and easy. I made this recipe on a dare from a Mt Dew drinker. Everyone wanted the recipe. A keeper!!!"
"1","5","Thanks for the recipe! Overall, this was very tasty and easy to make. I had to use Gala apples, and I think the large Granny Smith is probably a better choice. I also cut down on the sugar and used part Splenda. With the low-fat crescent rolls, this is a healthier alternative."
"1","5","I agree with all the other reviews, simply a warm, wonderful dessert. This was so great and fast- my husbans said these were memorable."
"1","5","This turned out really good! It was really easy and I'll definitely make them again."
"1","5","This is by far the best recipe I have ever made. To cut back on calories I use Diet Mt. Dew. I have to make these at least twice a month. 10 stars if I could."
"1","5","These were pretty darn tasty! I just wish I would have had some vanilla ice cream on hand. Great recipe!"
"1","5","Great recipe! I had heard of this and my neighbor convinced me to try it, and my entire family is glad she did! Thanks for sharing the recipe! YUM!"
"1","5","The most wonderful dessert I ever had in my mouth! And the smell while it was cooking was to die for!"
"0","5","Mountain dew and apples? YESSS!!!! This dessert was AMAZING! I did cut it in half because we don't eat a lot of sweet stuff. I also made a small change as suggested and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I will be making this for many years to come. It's so simple and so cheap."
"0","5","Wonderful. Will reduce butter next time and bake 10 minutes before adding any liquid to them so they are not so soggy, per other reviews. Definitely a keeper recipe!"
"0","5","I actually completely forgot the butter and had just coated the dumplings in sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Then just put enough Mountain Dew (used diet) to rest at the bottom of the pan. The result? Still amazing, and I imagine less fattening, haha."
"0","5","Amazing!! Delicious!! I didn't have Mt Dew so used ginger ale. Soo good!!"
"0","5","I make this regularly for family dinners, but I use Spenda white and brown sugar and Diet Mountain Dew to reduce sugar. Still excellent over Carb-Smart Vanilla Ice Cream."
"0","5","Only used 1 cup of sugar and added chopped walnuts to cinnamon, butter,sugar mix."
"0","5","I will always use this recipe"
"0","5","Butter and sugar can be cut in half and these are still amazing"
"0","5","This is one of the easiest and delicious desserts you can make. I cut the butter in half, used unpeeled nectarines and not apples, and ginger ale instead of Mountain Dew. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","no changes needed, FABULOUS and very easy!"
"0","5","Love it"
"0","5","This has to be one of the best desserts I've ever made. I followed the advice of many of the previous reviewers and reduced the butter/sugar, cinnamon syrup, however next time I will use the entire amounts listed. The sauce that results really helps make the dish. One difference - I made my dumplings larger with more filling to make each dumpling a nice single serving. This dish reheats beautifully. What a wonderful recipe that I will be sure to make frequently. I wholeheartedly encourage you to make the recipe as is, THEN decide if you want to change anything for the next time."
"0","5","NOTES:  3 Granny Smith apples 1 stick butter Sugar - 3/4 cup white + 1/4 cup brown Step 3 - Blend butter and sugar well, then add cinnamon Pour Mountain Dew AROUND dumplings. Serve with ice cream"
"0","4","Made 64 of these for a potluck for international college students--a taste of America. They devoured them--even took some home! Would probably spread the sugar mix more over the dumplings and maybe a little less soda but they were still good."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. I really don't like cooked apples but this recipe is an exception. It's quick and easy. I've made it several times and everyone that's eaten it has loved it. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Awesome! I cooked the butter/sugar mixture for about 5 minutes until it turned thick and caramelized. I also poured the Mountain Dew in between the dumplings instead of over them. They were amazing."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I halved the recipe and followed one reviewer's suggestion and sprinkled the apple slices with sugar before I enclosed them in the crescent rolls. So delicious! Perfect topper to end my July 4th!"
"0","4","Good and simple. Used 7up."
"0","5","Delicious.... A big hit... Everyone loved it. Will make again, the only thing I would change is cutting down on the sugar.. Other than that, it was amaZing. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Awesome as is!"
"0","5","Ohmygoodness. This is just fantastic!!! I made the recipe on Friday night...and then again on Saturday. So easy, so cheap and so good! Reduced sugar to 1 cup and added a splash of vanilla. So stinkin' good!"
"0","5","Very tasty!"
"0","5","I have made these three times and they turned out great every time. Just a lot of sugar so we only make them on occasion. Sooooo good!"
"0","4","Very good and easy to make."
"0","5","absolutely delicious and if you're careful they aren't to messy."
"0","5","It's delicious, meltingly-sweet in the way a lot of really good apple desserts tend to be. My roomies loved this dish, and it's good to be microwaved over and over. In the future, though, I might have to cut down on the overall amount I make. This is a good dish, but I get sick of sweets if I have them all the time."
"0","5","Made for Easter and followed recipe and it was all gone!!!"
"0","5","I loved these. I used ginger ale instead of mountain dew because I do not like mountain dew."
"0","5","This is the best thing I've ever made. And I've made some pretty badass desserts......"
"0","5","My grandmother made this dish for Christmas and I had never tried them. Well let me to you. I made it at home and it was amazing and easy. Definitely recommend this dessert for something quick and easy."
"0","5","This recipe was incredibly easy and I have to say they were pure heaven. Everyone in my family loved them and it looks like I will be making them again VERY soon for an event. I have to say the reheat very well but are best served fresh and hot"
"0","5","Great recipe delicious!!!!!!!"
"0","3","Waaaayyyyyy to sweet. My family liked the basic flavor but next time I will cut some of the sugar out."
"0","5","Made this for our New Year party and it was a hit! Everyone was asking for the recipe. Only thing I did differently was add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the melted butter and reduced the sugar to one cup ??"
"0","5","I have made these several times and every time they are served I hear awes and ooohhhs want more. Serve warm/hot with ice cream is the best.   My only advice is not to use Diet Mountain Dew it doesn't work."
"0","5","Excellent, I use splenda sweetener and Diet Mountain Dew. I do not like regular sugar and this recipe is still excellent......."
"0","5","Great recipe, made it just the way it was posted, would not change a thing"
"0","5","Yummy!!!"
"0","5","I made these for work and everyone LOVED them! They were very easy to put together. I was concerned that there was too much liquid once I poured the mtn dew over it, but it ended up creating a great sauce tobspoon over the final product. I will definitelybbe making these again!"
"0","5","This recipe was my first baking experience of all time and it turned out fantastic. I like the idea of adding a tsp of Vanilla and will do that today as I'm making it again."
"0","5","This recipe was so easy and affordable to make. I served it hot with vanilla ice cream and my family LOVED it!"
"0","5","Made it today for our family get together. Everyone loved it. Given the amount of sugar in it,I will try the Splenda and diet mt. Dew suggestion next time."
"0","5","Yummy recipe!"
"0","5","I made these with small Gala apples as it was all I had on hand. Followed rest of recipe.   I thought my boyfriend was going to dump me for the dumplings! He went on and on after several servings. They were really wonderful."
"0","5","Yummy"
"0","5","This recipe is just plain naughty!! lol I've made it several times and it is SO GOOD!! Definitely a keeper recipe!"
"0","5","These are so easy and so delicious. I made them for a family reunion and everyone has been BEGGING me to make them again!"
"0","5","I've made this several times and my guest are always amazed how simple the recipe is to make. And every dumpling is always gone. I sometimes add a few drops of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg to the recipe to add a little extra taste and aroma while baking."
"0","5","I made this for a Thanksgiving gathering and it was gone in a flash! People were hunting me down to tell me how much they loved it. Definitely a keeper and I will be making it again."
"0","5","These were amazing! For the best taste, serve them hot! Also good with whipped cream or ice cream!"
"0","5","Amazingly delicious dessert for not a lot of effort. Appreciated the comments for coating the apple in cinnamon sugar before wrapping in pastry; using 2 parts white sugar to 1 part brown; and the tip to let the butter and sugars simmer until it pulls from the sides of the pan before adding cinnamon and vanilla. Next time I plan on using ginger beer in place of Mountain Dew!"
"0","5","Great! I reduced sugar to 1/2c white and 1/4c light brown, used 1/2tsp apple pie spice instead of cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. I only used 4oz Mt. Dew and poured around the dumplings. Also left the skins on and used Crisp apples which I first coated in the sugar mix. Delicious."
"0","5","This recipe is wonderful. I made it exactly as written except cut in half, in a square baking dish. It's important to not put this in a baking dish that's too large, it needs to cook in the sauce. And vanilla ice cream on top is a must!!! My husband said it was very 'gourmet'. :)"
"0","4","These were really good but very sweet. I will def make again but will omit the soda."
"0","4","I made this following the recipe exactly, but I found it to be way too sweet. Was great with vanilla ice cream and non of the syrup. Will make it again this cutting back on the sugar"
"0","5","BEST EVER -- My husband works in an office of foodies and I'm making this for his holiday potluck. Based on other reviews, I used half brown sugar, and ginger ale because I always have some on hand. We have a prolific apple tree that bears huge Harrelsons so I cut large apple wedges, six per apple. It's hard to tell when these are done but next time I'll stick with 35 minutes at 375. Also definitely adding some chopped pecans."
"0","5","I have made this many times in the past. I made it yesterday for work, everyone loved it. And one even ask for the recipie, so she could make it for Thanksgiving. That made me very proud. I will make it more often."
"0","4","Since it was just for two of us I halved the recipe as others have done. The only changes that I made were to use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the sauce. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on the apples before wrapping them. They were very easy to make, smelled heavenly while baking, and my husband thought they were amazing. To me they were a touch too rich and sweet for my taste. I will definitely make them again, but next time I will try cutting back a little on the sugar.....maybe using Splenda in the place of the white sugar. I think that serving it with vanilla ice cream or whipping cream would probably also help cut the sweetness."
"0","5","SERIOUSLY delicious!!! I'm going to turn into an apple dumpling, I can't stop making them OR eating them!"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome, I have passed in all around my family, and it has been a huge hit with everyone that has tried it."
"0","5","Fast and easy. Made mini dumplings by cutting crescent rolls in half. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I tried this with lots of variations. I used three pkg. of rolls, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 cups butter, winter apples, and one can of Squirt. It still has way too much butter for our taste buds, but was extremely good. I only bought the rolls to try this, so next time I will make a dough, cut down on the butter even more, but I will be making this again especially when company is here. This would be a great project for kids to help with, wrapping up those apples and using soda pop."
"0","4","I love this because it's so fast and delicious. I halved the recipe and then halved the sauce. I sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the crescent triangles before rolling as well, then I brush the rolls with the butter mixture and pour the rest over. I have used lemon-lime soda, but since I have stopped drinking pop, I use orange juice and I like it better. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","So delicious! I made it to a T except added extra cinnamon. It was pretty simple too! My family loved including the little ones. Next time, will make for company."
"0","5","This was a huge hit at our house. Will be making again very soon!"
"0","5","Wow so easy and good. I added vanilla and used part brown sugar as several folks suggested."
"0","4","These are awesome, but it needs more apple. When I make it again, I'm going to use a quarter of an apple in each. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Easy, quick and delicious!"
"0","5","Incredible. I used half white sugar half dark brown because i was running low. A family hit! We will make this again!"
"0","2","I followed the exact recipe. It was overwhelmingly sweet and soggy:( I had to pour at least a cup of the syrup off after it was baked. I think I would follow the modifications others made and decrease the sugar and butter. (I like sweet-but this is just too much) I don't know why I had so much liquid left either?"
"0","5","This recipe was fantastic! Simple, easy and great! I used two tsp of the sugar/cinnamon (adding a 1/2 tsp of salt) to flavor the cut apples before rolling. Don't have Mountain Dew so used Goose Island Spicy Ginger Ale--yummy!"
"0","4","I tried this using Splenda instead of sugar (and diet 7Up because that's what we had) and the Splenda seized up when I added it to the butter. This tastes really good, but would like a suggestion as to handle the Splenda issue. I am diabetic and would like to make this again. Thanks for any solutions."
"0","5","I've made this recipe (and others like it) several times and everyone always loves them! They are the first thing to go and everyone is surprised to learn they contain Mountain Dew. Will be adding this into the fall dessert rotation."
"0","5","This turned out Great !!. I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter, as it seemed like it would be too rich and sweet . It was just right ."
"0","5","I only had gala apples on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My husband says I should try the recipe with pears, and I think I want to try it with peaches as well. The outside crust is a little crispy, while the rest is totally gooey from the butter and Mountain Dew. This would be great served with vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","This was awesome! Next time I'm going to make it lighter."
"0","5","wow! never made dumplings before and these were sooooooooooooo good! All we were missing was some ice cream"
"0","5","This recipe is insanely delicious and very easy to make....made this last night. awesome warm out of the oven and cold. I did reduce the sugar and soda and it came out just right. Plan on making this more now since the cooler weather has arrived."
"0","4","Oh ya. These are super yummy. Ive made them 3 times already. I still think Mountain Dew is freaky, so I substitute the juice of a fresh lemon instead. Served with ice cream this is a perfect delicious quick dessert."
"0","4","I made the original recipe and it was terrific. I then made a another batch using diet mountain dew and a sugar substitute. It was just as good and cut 120 calories per dumpling. If you use margarine in lieu of butter another 30 calories will be cut per dumpling. Haven't tried using margarine."
"0","5","Wow this was great, I'm saving this one!"
"0","3","It was too sweet and too soupy."
"0","5","Turned out great! People were raving over these...."
"0","1","I'm not sure where this recipe goes wrong, but the taste reminded me of nothing that is 'country.' I was hesitant to make these with so many 'processed' ingredients and an overdose of sugar. The end result was just bad. I'll stick to my tried and true old fashioned dumplings with brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and butter filling. Brush the pastry with milk, sprinkle with a bit of cinnamon sugar, and bake."
"0","5","So delicious!! Served with vanilla bean ice cream."
"0","5","A friend gave me this recipe a few years back. It is fabulous!! We cook this on a regular basis when we are camping and use a dutch oven over the fire....the aroma makes all the other campers drool with envy (we do share IF there is any left!) This recipe is perfect as is...after all, it's dessert. Thanks to Christina B for the suggestion to use peaches! Next camping trip, we will be trying this."

"0","5","Amazing!"
"0","5","The Apple Dumplings are to DIE for! This recipe reminds me so much of Apple Pie, but the mini version of it. Since I didn't have cinnamon ice cream, I served the apple dumplings with vanilla ice cream. It was a HUGE hit in my household, so I would like to try the pie crust for the Apple Dumplings instead of using cresent dough. Hopefully, it'll taste good!! :-)"
"0","5","wonderful and quick."
"0","5","Delicious sweet breakfast treat! Easy to make, and if Mt. Dew isn't on hand you can substitute with 7-up or Sprite. Today I'm trying with fresh peaches. They are about to go into the oven. That sounded like a fun summer alternative to the apples."
"0","4","great recipe, my 14 yr. old grandson found this & wanted to try it for sunday dessert. everyone loved it."
"0","2","unimpressed. I love the simplicity of the recipe, and will keep looking with a similar use of crescent rolls. However, we didn't care for the texture. I wasn't looking for something restaurant qualty, I was looking for an easy weeknight fix. Perhaps it would have turned out different with different ratios of ingredients."
"0","5","Love this recipe, quick and easy dessert that surprises people when they hear the 'secret' ingredient! I cut the Mountain Dew down just a bit, don't like it quite so syrupy. I have friend who uses peaches and Dr Pepper, can't wait to try that!"
"0","5","Made these tonight and my family LOVED it !!!"
"0","5","This is truly excellent and so easy to make! I did reduce the amount of butter and sugar by 1/4-1/2 -- I didn't measure it exactly because as the recipe makes clear the combination of butter, sugar, and cinnamon goes on top of the rolls. The modification made it considerably less sweet; the actual recipe produces a cloying end product so if you're being careful"
"0","5","Love these! Someone commented that the hardest part was peeling the apples. I'd rate that as second hardest. For me the hardest part is not eating half the dish by myself! LOL"
"0","5","This is by far, the best apple dumpling recipe I've ever tried! Made it last night, and we loved it!! I recommend not changing a thing!!!"
"0","5","this recipe is a miracle when i have a taste for something sweet all i have to do this whip this up and its so simple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! the first time I tried it I was nervous of how it would taste but it is so good. The apple just melts in your mouth. It is so good and so easy to make when you have company"
"0","5","They were awesome. I took Canadiancook's advice and did the following:1) coat the apples in cinnamon and sugar before wrapping 2) Use 2 parts white to 1 part brown sugar in the sauce. simmer until it makes a thick, rich caramel and pulls away from the side of the pot. then add 1 tsp. vanilla along with the cinnamon. With these tweaks the dumplings were not soggy at all."
"0","5","One word AMAZING!! I used only a half a cup of sugar. Next I'm going to try it with ginger ale. These were such a simple treat."
"0","5","I made this for my family for Easter and it was a huge hit! I bought yellow delicious apples though because of family preference. Other than that i followed the recipe as it was written and it was a huge hit in my house. My husband has requested that I make him this every sunday! Thank you for the great recipe. It will now be a family one in our house!"
"0","5","This was an awesome recipe. I did not have mountain dew so I used sprite. This was so good with Vanilla Ice Cream. Tastes like a mini apple pie."
"0","5","This was absolutely wonderful! I followed other reviews and added cinnamon/sugar to the apples before putting them in the crescent roll and boiled the sugar butter mixture til golden brown then added some additional cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. Surprisingly delicious."
"0","5","This is just such a good and easy recipe. Everyone that I have fixed it for loved the fact that it was like a little apple pie with every bite."
"0","5","This is the best overall recipe I have ever tried!!! There's no way to explain how great it is until you try it.....! The only things I changed was I used diet Mt. Dew and half the sugar and butter. I have used Splenda also. I think everybody needs to try the original recipe first though just so you get the full effect"
"0","5","Made these for my husband's birthday. They were a hit!"
"0","5","FANTASTIC!!!!!!"
"0","1","I'm sorry, but this just was not good. Way too much butter and sugar and the roll dough tasted as expected....out of a can. With just a little effort, you can make a flour dough that you drop into boiling sauce with apples and it is 10 times better. So if you are the type of cook that appreciates home-baked desserts, I would stay away from this one."
"0","5","These are so good. We had fun making them and they tasted great!!! Will make again!"
"0","5","These are amazingly good! I made just as stated and served warm with a scoop of vanilla icecream. So good! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","These were really good, but WAY too sweet! I'll make them again, but I will reduce the sugar to about half what's called for!"
"0","5","i am a pre-k teacher and love to find child friendly recipies',this IS IT!!! lots of sugar & butter but really yummy,the kids loved making and eating them.i wanted to have ice cream with but decided not to so as not to take away from the new experience. could be company dessert for us grown-ups !!!!!"
"0","5","This is a very easy recipe, with basic ingredients, and was a huge hit with my family. Served with cinnamon swirled ice cream....delicious! This has become the favorite dessert at my house and requested all the time."
"0","5","So easy! So yummy! I coated the apple wedges in cinnamon & sugar before rolling in the crescent dough. The few left over were eaten with our breakfast coffee. Amazing!"
"0","4","I made this on a whim, and it was great! The only flaw to this was that it was very soupy when I pulled it from the oven. I used 12 oz. of Sprite instead of Mountain Dew (I had it left from another recipe that called for it). Next time, I think I will cut it down to 6 oz or less. Overall, it was a good dessert that I look forward to trying again."
"0","5","Came out perfectly without any alterations. My guests all raved and asked for the recipe!"
"0","3","I made this while my sister was in town and thought it was just ok. Very easy to make, but it could use a little help. If I make this again, I would add additional seasonings to the cinnamon/sugar (nutmeg and cardamom) & dice up additional apples to put in the bottom of the pan to create a nice apple sauce to spoon over the dumplings. I would also top with candied pecans or almonds to give a bit more texture."
"0","5","This was great and simple to make!!!!"
"0","5","Wow! Super rich and yummy!!"
"0","5","Love it! Love it! Love it! But everyone is making it too complicated. Let the oven heat do it all. Rub the baking dish with butter before placing the wrapped dumplings in their spots. Melt remaining butter and pour over, sprinkle cinnamon and sugar over, pour sprite over, bake.........PERFERCT!!"
"0","5","So yummy and oh so easy. Such a treat for a cold winter evening or anytime."
"0","5","OMG, heavenly!!! I only used 8 ozs of Mountain Dew because I was scared it would get too soggy. With the 8 ozs, it sure wasn't soggy. I added about two tablespoons of honey to help make up some of the difference in the lost liquid. It gave the entire dessert a very heavenly delicate hint of honey. After cooking, I put some in a bowl with Cool Whip and just a little bit of milk. Wish there was a dessert I could compare it to, but there's nothing out there. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. Everyone I've ever made this for just raves about it and always ask for the recipe. I do reduce the amount of butter to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1 cup. Still good."
"0","5","Terrific. Made my husband happy and it is a nice change from apple pie."
"0","5","this recipe is a huge hit at our house and my son loves them with Vanilla Icecream. Not much to change and they are so easy to make."
"0","5","These are delicious! They are fool proof and are always a hit!"
"0","5","This is ridiculously delicious! I have made it three times in one week!"
"0","4","Great, but instead I used Squirt. That was better and also, I used red delicious. That turned out better then expected. Hope this works out for you :D"
"0","5","It was a big hit. I did things a bit different also. I cut the apple wedges smaller which left some leftover apple pieces. Just before adding the Mountain Due and putting it into the oven, I chopped the remaining apple pieces and sprinkled over the top. This gave the sauce the same apple flavor. As suggested in another post, I also added nutmeg and a generous teaspoon of vanilla I served it with ice cream that night; the next morning my co-workers enjoyed it with their coffee. I made a double recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is fabulous! Everyone I have served it to loved it. My husband wants me to fix this every few days, but can't because he is diabetic. I, like the others, have used 1/2 splenda in place of 1/2 the sugar and diet 7up in place of the mountain due. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
"0","1","The dumplings float in the liquid, so the bottom of the crescent rolls were gooey. The apples weren't cooked and the odd raw and gooey crescent rolls with the crunchy apples made a very unpleasant combination in my mouth.  My two boys, who *live* for cinnamon rolls, were very excited to see the ingredients sitting on the counter, especially the Mountain Dew, which is usually not allowed. They couldn't wait to try these. Whenever I try a new recipe, I always tell them 'Tell me the truth, or you'll get it again!' They were very quiet while eating them and didn't go back for seconds! That told me all I needed to know."
"0","5","I too made some adjustments to the recipe. I cooked down the butter, sugar & cinnamon until it had an amber, caramel color. It was like hot molten lava but clung to and covered the crescent covered apple slices. I poured the mountain dew around NOT on the dumplings. I had halved the recipe which calls for 12 oz of Mountain Dew - I used 8 oz. There was still way too much sauce after baking which tends to make the bottom crust soggy, so next time, I'll only use 1/2 cup of mountain dew. With vanilla ice cream on the side it's delicious!!!"
"0","5","Easy to make, tasty, only 45 min."
"0","2","Wayyyy to much sugar and butter. Why so much? I recommend greatly reducing the amount (and I live off junk food). The bottoms are soggy as well and I don't even taste the mountain dew. I won't be makin these again.   I recommend moving them from the pan right away."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! The only thing that I changed was increasing the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons. Make sure that the crescent rolls are pinched evenly and that the folds aren't thick."
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I do have a couple of personal preferences: I peel my apples and I substitute brown sugar for the white. Simple, yummy comfort!"
"0","5","Great,I will keep making these,really good and easy to make..."
"0","5","Very good. I use parker house roll dough and Ginger Ale."
"0","5","This recipe was so GOOD, I had to come back here and sing it's praises! I made the recipe EXACTLY as suggested and took it out of the oven at 30 minutes (350 degrees). Thanks for sharing! This will definitely become one of my staples!"
"0","5","This is a fabulous recipe - very very easy and so incredibly delicious. It's become my first and favorite dessert to serve my friends and family. I like to dust the apples in a bit of sugar and cinnamon before rolling up in the dough - just gives it a bit more cinnamony sweetness."
"0","5","I used pears and ginger ale, all else the same. Awesome!"
"0","4","I tried this recipe it was wonderful. I used allspice as well as cinnamon and i used less sugar. Also, pressed raisins into dough before apples. I used good size chunks of apple and thought that it would be too big but once cooked it was fine. I did cook it longer than quoted and basted it with the sauce once near the end. Next time I would use less sugar and butter. I am going to try the 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda.I never had apple dumplings before so had nothing to compare. my husband suggested them for Xmas dessert because he loved this."
"0","5","I just made this for the first time last week for Thanksgiving. I was really scared/skeptical because of the mountain dew and store bough crescent rolls. I did substitute with sprite and cut the sugar and butter in half (my family does not like overly sweet desserts), and baked the crescents without the butter sugar mixture and sprite for the first 10-12 minutes, as recommended by other users to keep the dumplings from being too sweet or soggy. Then made sure to pour the sprite in the cracks and not directly over the dumplings. The whole family was surprised at how good it was! We will definitely make this again and again!"
"0","5","Holy Moly these are sooo good! :) I used what I had in the fruit bowl, granny smith and jonathan style, lined them up side by side and couldn't taste/see a difference much. It's all good! I would recommend to not freak out with all the liquid in the pan before baking, it gets all soaked up just fine during baking! Give this a try..your family will love and doubt there will be leftovers!!"
"0","5","Ok, so I was amazed. The way it is written is perfect. The flavor is awesome. The only thing I am going to work on is getting the bottom not to be so wet and doughy. Maybe next time I will try turning them after half the baking time. But a great recipe. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Oh my, so simple to make, and way more yummy then I expected!"
"0","5","This is such a simple recipe to prepare, but anyone you serve it to will be impressed. I topped mine with a little fresh, lightly sweetened whipped cream."
"0","3","Toooo sweet!!!"
"0","5","OMG this was a hit - I did it with Ginger Ale instead and it was delicious!!!!!"
"0","4","This recipe was pretty good. I had very high expectations considering all of the reviews, and it didn't 100% blow me out of the water. still good though, and very easy."
"0","5","I made these dumplings exactly according to the recipe and, WOW!!! They met AND exceeded any expectations! I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar because I love the taste of apples and brown sugar. The Mountain Dew really ads a lot. Nice thing is you can substitute splenda and diet Mountain Dew if you can't eat sugar. I took these to work and had to have copies of the recipe made. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!! Thanx for these little bundles of joy! :-)"
"0","5","This recipe is AMAZING!!!!! I thought about it and decided to try it on my fellow football 'team' I used 3 cans of crescent rolls and between the 6 of us, there was only 3 left over!!!! We served them with vanilla ice cream, but I would serve with cinnamon ice cream, too!! Oh, I did a LOT more cinnamon than what the recipe called for! AWESOME, TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! Next time I will try it with Splenda and Diet Mt, Dew. I'm diabetic and I want something I can eat, too!!! Will let you know about the lower sugar recipe later!"
"0","5","Didn't use as much butter & def not as much mtn dew. I made more of a sauce. Everybody enjoyed the dumplings. Will make again."
"0","1","BE WARNED: The bottoms are extremely soggy and uncooked. That said the taste is great but needs more APPLE! use 1/4slice (not 1/8 too small) Followed the recipe exactly and maybe its just how dumplings are but the bottoms were all soggy(maybe that's normal first time making :) and not thoroughly cooked(i don't want to eat raw dough). was expecting them to be more crispy like the tops were. the mnt dew seems too of been too much, the taste was good(minus the soggy wet uncooked bottoms). idea1:don't pour sugar mix over dumplings pour that in pan and place dumpling on top only use 1/4 can mntdew just to glaze them, don't let them sit in liquid= soggy bottoms. Idea2: with a brush paint the sugary mixture over the dumplings and place in pan, eliminate mnt dew all together. gunna try these methods again and see how it goes."
"0","5","Excellent! The only two changes I made was: 1) I used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew (can't stand that stuff! lol). And 2), because I used a slightly sweeter apple than the granny smith's called for, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and the butter to 3/4 cup accordingly. They turned out absolutely scrumptious. Can't wait to make again!!"
"0","5","I was looking for something easy to make. This sounded yummy. I was curious about the Mt Dew too. I made them last night. So good. My GS apples were on the small side so I used three apples and put two pieces in each triangle. I also added a handful of craisins on top. After 40 mins the bottoms were still a bit doughy so I added an extra few mins of baking time. Delicious."
"0","5","I made it for my husband and he loved it. I can't wait to make it again."
"0","5","My boy friend loves it. and hes a huge sweets fan."
"0","5","I made these exactly as printed except I used spiced apple cider instead of the can of pop. Turned out really good."
"0","5","This recipe is mouth watering and easy to make, Will be making it for company and my family many times over."
"0","5","Ridiculous!"
"0","4","Excellent! These were so delicious! I think you can easily get away with using less butter, especially if you're going to use a sugar/splenda blend (in which case I would suggest halving the butter).  As it was, I used a sugar/splenda blend, so there was about half of the quantity of sugar, but I kept the butter the same, so in the end there was just a pool of melted butter that the dumplings were practically floating in. It didn't affect their deliciousness in the slightest, but I will definitely reduce the amount of butter used next time.  And there WILL be a next time!"
"0","5","Just made this last night. And o my word.... Was this desert absolutely amazing. I thought is would be good because all of the reviews but so much better than i ever imagined. Not only was is easy to make they were rich and mouth watering. The only thing that i did differently was to toss the apples in some cinnamon sugar before rolling. I will make this without a doubt many many more times and I can't wait to eat them again."
"0","5","Raving reviews! So glad I tried it."
"0","5","Awesome recipe!! I am a member of allrecipes and this is the first recipe I have tried. My sister actually turned me on to this website. he and I are gourmet cooks and we both love to bake as well. We grew up helping our mother on the kitchen. I read a few reviews before making it and followed a few of them before making it. I also halved the recipe, combined equal parts of white and brown sugar, added a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1 tsp. of vanilla, diet sierra mist instead of Mountain Dew, flipped them half way through baking, baked them for 45 min. Oh, I forgot, I also combined the peeled apples with 3/4 of the sugar mixture and added the rest to the butter. Thank-you Cheryl, my sister, for turning me on to this website. I love and miss you and am so sorry I moved so far away from you!!!"
"0","4","Wow! Talk about a sugar high! But oh, so yummy!"
"0","5","I was weary about a recipe with mountain dew as i love the soda. I was pleasantly surprised. This was an awesome recipe that I'd definitely make again. This recipe is for 8 servings. Most families would be fine with 1/2 a batch."
"0","5","YUMMY!!! This is definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Incredible! I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on the apples before rolling them up. For the sauce I used half a stick of butter, a quarter cup of agave nectar, a tablespoon of brown sugar, the cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. It cut back on the fat and cholesterol but still packed a delicious punch. Used a Safeway brand grapefruit soda. So simple and rewarding. Loved the crispy top and the slightly 'soggy' bottom. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","I made this last night for dinner; we had a guest and I always like a homebaked dessert. I halved the recipe however used a HUGE granny smith apple. I estimated the amount of Mountain Dew soda and possibly used less than called for because the sauce was thick; perfect served over all natural vanilla ice cream. Given the simplicity and the presentation this is a winner all around. Nothing tasted 'off' about this recipe in the least."
"0","5","Okay here is the get go... I made it... I made some adjustments. I mixed some vanilla sugar and cinnamon together and coated the apples. I did what many have done, used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I doubled the cinnamon. I used throw back Mountain Dew. It turned out AWESOME! Took this over to some good friends and everyone ate it all up! I will make this again!!! Served with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","These are very addicting! Tried them with brown sugar. I liked them better that way. More caramel tasting."
"0","5","This is definitely a keeper! I have made this many times and have used 3/4 cup each white cane sugar and light brown sugar. I have also used a can of Sprite, rather than Mountain Dew. This ALWAYS gets rave reviews at breakfast and for dessert. Ice cream makes it totally irresistible!"
"0","5","Made this in a dutch oven and it was heavenly"
"0","5","This is amazing!! I haven't altered the recipe at all besides cutting the serving size in half and it is delicious as is. My family loves them."
"0","5","Followed this to a tee and it was amazing!!"
"0","5","Amazing! My mom made these last week and used a can of Sprite, and they tasted just as good as the ones made with Mountain Dew."
"0","5","This is such an odd recipe but because of the reviews I couldn't quite pass it up. The end result was a ridiculously delish dessert. My boyfriend who does not like apple pie even raved about it."
"0","5","Omg! My colleague brought this in to work and although typically I don't like apple deserts I gave it a try and immediately asked for the recipe! Can't wait to try this and add some of my own touches!"
"0","5","I just made these. I knew they were going to be good based on the reviews, but I didn't think they would be this good. These are going on the Thanksgiving menu!"
"0","2","I would have enjoyed this better if the apple didn't turn to applesauce after baking. :("
"0","5","Amazing!! My husband said it was the best thing I have ever made!"
"0","5","This was one of the best recipes I have ever made! I served it at a dinner party with a small scoop of French Vanilla ice cream and it was a hit!"
"0","5","These were dee-licious!! Only thing I did different was use pastry dough instead of crescent rolls. The pastry dough gives these little bundles of joy a nice crunchy texture on the outside. Next time I may cut back on the sugar as others suggested as these were definitely on the sweeter side."
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe. So easy and so delicious. Every time I make it, people rave and ask for the recipe. This is one of my family's very favorites."
"0","5","This has got to be the easiest most tasty apple dumplings I ever made. WARNING....Once you make these dunplings you will never roll out another dought for dumplings again. Perfect for sunday lunch or a quick dessert for a plain old Tuesday. THANK YOU so much for a recipe box keeper. I agree with the other reviews, Granny Smith is the only way to go."
"0","5","I couldn't ignore all the accolades for this dish. It is true! I used 1/2 cup Splenda and diet 7-Up and my husband absolutely loved them. He could have easily eaten several of them if I had not put the rest in the refrigerator. Definitely will be a year round dessert for us."
"0","5","I've tried this recipe with Bartlett pears also and it is also very good remember--you half this recipe!"
"0","5","These are awesome everyone loved them!!!!!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely delicious. My kids and grandkids loved them. Will be making more soon."
"0","5","These were so good! I had a big bag of red apples that needed to used up so I decided to make this and I'm so glad I did. I brought some to a dinner party and they loved them as well. I'm not a big sweet eater but I really liked these. I will for sure make these again."
"0","5","Love this! I make the recipe as is except use a combination of white and brown sugar instead of just using white sugar."
"0","5","Instead of MT Dew, I substituted lemon juice and water, I also melted down some butterscotch chips with the butter, etc. They were delicious and I'm taking some with me for my son to taste on Thanksgiving."
"0","5","You would not believe how wonderful this dish is. However I did not have the baking dish that was called for so I used a shallow baking sheet and cooked the dumplings at a lower temperature (about 250 degrees) and occasionally basted them with the sauce at the bottom of the pan. Extremely delicious results."
"0","5","I've made this my favorite recipe. I've made this many times and given to friends. EVERYONE loves it and ask for the recipe. It's just Tooooooo good.!"
"0","5","I made this dessert for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Loved them."
"0","5","This is the best recipe for dumplings. Very Yummmmy!"
"0","5","Great, quick & easy! Loved loved it!"
"0","5","This is a great dish!! I used three large apples!! That was the only change I made, to get more apple!! Family loved it!!"
"0","5","OMG!! This so delicious and easy. You must try this for yourself. I did follow the advice of others and added 1 tsp vanilla and extra cinnamon. Served warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream, delish !!"
"0","5","Oh my goodness! This is so delicious- I do not even want to look at the calories! I used gala apples (my fav), so I cut the butter by 1/2 cup & cut the butter by 6 tbsp. Also added a splash of vanilla to the butter/sugar sauce---HEAVEN!"
"0","5","These are unbelievably good. Tried it with pears as well. People thought I spent hours preparing this dessert. Thumbs up!"
"0","5","I love this recipes! so easy and so good"
"0","5","I tried out this recipe and it was absolutely delicious! My son and his wife loved it too!"
"0","4","I'm decreasing the sugar next time, but other than that, these were great! Going to try these with pears."
"0","5","Delicious and easy to make! Halved the recipe and took the suggestions of others. Used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar. Added 1/2 tsp vanilla after sugars had melted. Will make again!"
"0","5","O.M.G!! Just finished making this recipe and I and my family LOVE it!! Definitely a keeper!!"
"0","5","I love this but was alot better with diced apples vs. a wedge of an apple"
"0","5","AMAZING! I have made these a few times for friends and family. They all love it and so do I."
"0","5","Great recipe. The only changes I made was to use 1/2 cup of butter and coat the apple slices in sugar and cinnamon and the result was great. The kids had fun wrapping the apples in the pasty and pouring the lemonade around it. The sauce was a little thick, maybe because I 1/2 the butter so I added hot water to it and the result was very yummy. Also we do not have tinned pastry in NZ so I used frozen pre rolled puff pastry."
"0","5","Wow!"
"0","4","This is delicious however I did only put half the sugar and 1/2 cup butter and it was great."
"0","5","Scrumptious ! Scrumptious ! Scrumptious !"
"0","5","I didn't have mountain dew so I used a key lime sparkling water...turned out delicious!"
"0","4","I have made the recipe with half the ingredients, it turned out pretty good, I am giving it 4 stars because when I melted the butter and added sugar and cinnamon, it got lumpy on the bottom of the pot and the butter was floating and not mixing properly. I think its because I used powdered sugar?? could be. And when I put my sauce on the dumplings I could hardly add quarter of a can of Mountain Dew, the pan was over flowing with the sauce, I used puff pastry rolls, and baked it for 35 min only. Was really good but we still had a lot more extra sauce left in the pan...Next time I would double the dumplings but use the same amount of sauce."
"0","5","I add a small pat of cream cheese in with the apple slice...extra fattening, but sooooooooooo good! Served with ice cream it is very hard to limit to one serving!!!"
"0","5","My families favorite dessert! So easy, yet so fattening!"
"0","5","I can't believe how awesome these were. I thought, 'Mountain Dew? Really?' But WOW. These are addicting and are an absolutely perfect comfort dish in the fall."
"0","5","This was an excellent recipe quick and easy. I've made apple dumplings but from scratch. This a lot less work plus they were just delicious. Next time I make these I will double the batch as they were gobbled up as quickly as they came out of the oven. I served them with French Vanilla ice cream really a big hit. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
"0","5","O.K. I doubted the mountain dew. Once these dumplings were done in the oven the mountain dew sauce was the bomb diggity. I made a home made cinnamon ice cream to accompany the dumpling. I used a a battery operated ice cream maker from Target."
"0","5","Just had it last night, OMG! Also great with coffee this morning."
"0","5","Loved it!!! Perfect end to a long day... it was a tad bit too sweet. Very easy and fun to make."
"0","4","This is a new dish for our family and a keeper for sure. We used Trader Joe's crescent roll dough, Reed's Extra Ginger Brew soda, a peeler/corer/slicer gadget to prep the apples, and reduced the butter/sugar mixture a little. Just a terrific easy little dish. My toddler son helped me wrap up the apples (sampling along the way). These dumplings just melt in your mouth. A bit sweeter than my preference so I'll probably go with half the sugar/butter next time."
"0","5","Great recipe, however, I reduced the sugar to 1 C and it was still TOO much sugar! With the mountain dew and 1 1/2 C sugar, it's overkill."
"0","5","Magically delicious!!!! Will definitely make again, and I didn't change anything. I was unsure about adding the MT Dew but glad I did. Everyone was impressed!"
"0","5","I served this at my bridge get together. Everyone asked for the recipe. I did take the advice of one reviewer and used a prepared pastry crust and cut way back on the sugar. I also used diet soda. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It's a keeper!! Next time, I am going to try this dish using crescent rolls just to make a comparison."
"0","5","So very good and easy! This is a go-to at our house now!!"
"0","5","This was delicious my family devoured them and this has become a family favorite we eat them warm with vanillia ice cream whip cream and my husband even puts sliced strawberries on his!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Oh Wow!! This was the best dessert I have ever made! I was shocked at how delicious these were."
"0","5","My mother and I saw this recipe and we HAD to try it. We instantly fell in love with them and make them for all of our family gatherings and they are a huge hit! The only downside is that I can only have so many before I start to feel ill. But they are still amazing!"
"0","3","I'm not as enamored of these as every other reviewer seems to be. My main issue is that the taste of the crescent rolls takes over; there's just not enough apple. Perhaps next time I would use larger apple pieces (cutting the apple into 6 vs. 8 pieces). I used only one cup sugar (half brown, half white), and it was PLENTY sweet. Surprisingly, even though I hate Mt. Dew and was skeptical, it just gave the caramel a sort of syrupy flavor; I couldn't taste the dew. My dumplings didn't seem soggy, and we ate them with ice cream. The teenagers loved them."
"0","1","I don't know what went wrong but these were horrible."
"0","5","Making this recipe for the 3rd time in 2 weeks, but today I'm trying peaches instead of apples!! Sounds YUMMY to me!!"
"0","2","I chose this receipe because it has 5 stars and 1837 review. How bad can it be? I was dissapointed. Way too much butter and sugar to start with. I cut the butter down to half cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup. Also - there seemed to be an after taste that I didnt like. I removed all the dough and apples from the pan, drained off the soda and rebaked the dough. Still too much mushy dough. I doubt I will try it again."
"0","5","Absolutely perfect as written!"
"0","5","Amazing. The recipe was easy to half and laid out prettily in an 8x8 pan. I peeled the apple. Really good. I didn't need ice cream or whipped cream. I liked it as is. I hope it reheats well."
"0","5","This works WONDERFULLY ! with peaches too !!!! I've also used 7-UP and pie dough."
"0","5","I have made this 4 times now. No changes and ever time I have had at least 3 people each time ask me for the recipe. I'm usually a from scratch kind of guy but these are PERFECT just the way they are. This is my go to party recipe."
"0","5","Made this last night for dessert and was very pleased with the outcome. I read through many reviews to make the best decision using other's experiences. I did lightly coat the cut apples in sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg prior to rolling in dough. I want to add that I think it's important to seal the dough without having any leaks. This may be why the dough became soggy and undercooked for others.I made half the recipe as written. My apple corer cuts the apple into 8 equal wedges, however, I cut each one in half again and used two for each triangle. This allowed the apples to cook perfectly. I also used Pillsbury brand crescent dough since I have tried substituting cheaper brands in the past when buying pie crust and there is a big difference in the final product. I made sure the butter mixture was poured over each dumpling. It was kind of thick and never creamy thin like the video but that may be because I used a mix of white and brown sugar as others suggested. The end product was delicious regardless and the top was nice and crunchy. I used Shoprite lemon/lime because you can buy it by the can and it's the same as using Sprite (make sure not to pour it directly on top of the dumplings). I cooked it for approximately 45 min. and served with vanilla ice cream. It was a keeper and I will definitely make this again."
"0","4","Super easy and delicious dessert!"
"0","5","I love to cook but my talent just is not there. This is a recipe I couldn't even destroyed. I have a family member who's a diabetic and switch to splendid n diet pop and they still asked me to make it again and a double batch"
"0","5","This recipe is mind blowing! Not only easy ingredients but VERY customizable. We like to add Rum extract to the sauce mixture for example YUM!!"
"0","5","These were sooo easy and the family just loved them! I will definitely keep this recipe."
"0","5","Awesome!"
"0","5","This was AWESOME!! I did add sugar and cinnamon to my apples before rolling them in the cresent roll. I followed the rest of the recipe as it was written."
"0","5","wounderfull"
"0","5","One of the best desserts ever made! I am going to try to reduce the sugar intake and butter next time, as many have suggested! Serve warm with vanilla ice cream! So good!"
"0","5","omg , is so good crispy , sweet ..... really easy , economic . love it , ill like to try with pear too ."
"0","5","Everyone in my family loved it! I used Diet Mt. Dew and it turned out great. I have a 5 and 3 year old and they helped dip the apples in the sugar and cinnamon mixture and they wrapped the crescent roll around it. A lot if fun for the entire family."
"0","5","great recipe. i cut the sugar down to 1 cup and still thought it was sweet. will also plan on maybe putting some cinnamon on teh apples vbefore the roll up but....i still thought i was an awesome recipe :)"
"0","5","Scrumdiddlyumptious!!!"
"0","4","This was really delicious! I was very skeptical about the soda, but of course it turned into a delicious syrup. I like that this recipe really lends itself to modifications, because I definately made some based on what I had. I only had one can of crescent rolls, and black cherry fresca on hand. I am sure that if I had followed the recipe to the letter it would've been even better. I halved the ingredients as well, and I cut each crescent triangle in half in a 8x8 pan. It turned out to be the perfect amount for our family, and the small macintosh apples I used didn't turn to mush like I feared they would. Also this was not soggy, the consistensy was what I expected. Great Recipe, easy to make... thank you!"
"0","5","Had a picnic last summer and made a triple batch. Gone in 5 minutes. My grandkids asked for seconds and thirds. Put a scoup of vanilla ice cream in the dish and covered with the dumplings. Yummy. Have experimented since and cut down the butter and used diet soda and splenda. Still yummy with less guilt and the kids never noticed."
"0","5","Easy and fabulous! Got rave reviews!"
"0","5","So easy and so yummy, who would have thought."
"0","5","Amazing.....I see why 1800 people loved it. Very easy to make and I got rave reviews from a friend who doesn't even like apple pie."
"0","5","I made dumplings earlier last fall. They tasted wonderful, but were difficult to make compared to this recipe. This recipe is easy peasy and is delicious. I only made 1/2 of the recipe because it is just dh and myself but since they are so easy to make I won't mind making again. Great dessert for company!"
"0","5","OMG!!! This recipe was wonderful & easy!!! I will definitely be making this again. My family just loved it!! -- AJ"
"0","5","I made this for dessert last night...oh yum! I didn't have any Mountain Dew so used a can of Diet Sprite and used a mixture of white and brown sugar. Will make this again so easy and good!"
"0","5","So yummy. I thought a war was going to start on who got the last one. One of my new favorite desserts."
"0","2","These were just waaaay too sweet, and ten minutes after coming out of the oven, they got super soggy. Will not be making this again."
"0","5","This is one of the best receipt I have made in a long time. So yummy!!! Love love love it. Great job!"
"0","5","This was sooooo easy and really good !!! Loved it !"
"0","5","These are so so gooooood!!!! My Whole family loves them!!!! I make a few changes now and then to reduce the fat and nobody knows the diff! they are just too awesome!!! and a little scoop of vanilla ice cream or some whip cream!!! so so yummy!!!!"
"0","5","words cannot explain the great taste of these. I will definetly make them again"
"0","5","Delicious and easy! Thank you!"
"0","3","I guess I'm the odd one out on this recipe. The bottom of the dumplings were soggy and I didn't care for that."
"0","5","Oh so yummy!"
"0","5","I made this recipe last night for Sunday dinner. It was a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe right now. I made only two small adjustments. I used about 1/2 cup less sugar and I used sprite instead of Mountain Dew. This will a family favorite for years to come.Thanks for the great dessert!!"
"0","5","I used Sierra Mist because I had at home. Love it! I removed the dumplings right after baking. No sogginess!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe to a tee and they turned out wonderful!! The only modification I will make next time is to slice the apples a little thinner to have two smaller slices per dumpling. My parents just loved them and were surprised about the Mountain Dew! They were golden, sweet, and delicious! I will definitely make them again!!"
"0","5","Delish!! I tried it first with Gala apples and it was great! The second time I used Grannys and I liked the little bit of tartness. I also used diet Dew, not that it helped in the calorie count with all of the other ingredients but it made me feel like I was trying to be better."
"0","5","Really delicious and easy to make!"
"0","5","The best recipe. I thought it would be kind of fake tasting with the crescents but not!! They are always gobbled up and people can't believe the mountain dew!"
"0","5","Very Easy; Fantastic!"
"0","5","The best apple desert I have ever had! Fantastic recipe!"
"0","5","Oh so good. Very dangerous though. It's impossible to eat just one."
"0","5","Soooo delicious!"
"0","5","This recipe was easy and absolutely scrumptious!  I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream when I served them and my husband loved it. Can't go wrong with this one.  Donna"
"0","5","I've used this recipe 3 times now. I was looking for something REALLY simple after a 2-year hiatus from cooking after having little use of my left arm after a total shoulder replacement due to a very bad car accident. I couldn't be happier with the outcome (as well as friends, family & neighbors with whom I shared). The first time I didn't have enough sugar, so I added pure raw cane sugar. It turned out wonderful. Since then I now use sweet cream unsalted butter (that's all I had at the time), and equal parts white sugar, pure raw cane, and brown sugar to make the 1 and 1/2 cups, and add a teaspoon of vanilla or rum extract. Using the unsalted butter I noticed the dumplings plump up more. Tonight, I had a 16 oz. bottle of Mountain Dew, and threw caution to the wind and used the whole bottle instead of the 12 oz. suggested. Bottom line, this recipe is delicious, easy, and easily tweaked to individual tastes without risking taste."
"0","5","I made this, it took me maybe 15 minutes to put it together. LOVED IT! I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and lightly boiled it down in my melted butter making a caramel consistency. I also mixed my apples in sugar and cinnamon. Next time I won't use the whole can of soda as it was a little watery at the bottom..maybe i'll try half a can. There are only 3 of us so i'll half it next time also. Its not as good the second day, the crunch cinnamon topping (think cin toast crunchy) becomes soft a couple of hours later. Half would be perfect for a family of 4! We had icecream, but my hubby who has a huge sweet tooth said he didnt want the icecream that it was perfect without it! I only used 3 medium apples for the full batch, and i had trouble closing the dough around that, so I'm not sure how others are just quartering thier apples unless they are really tiny ones. ENJOY this is a once a week kind of dessert :) I can imagine this being really good with fresh peaches or even cherries. YUM!"
"0","5","They are INCREDIBLE!!! This is one of my kids favorite desserts! Add a scope of vanilla gelato ice and Wow... I have a been making them now for about a year, and I have gotten nothing but wonderful comments. Not only are they good, but they are also fast and easy to make>"
"0","5","I don't like apples but this recipe is delicious. My husband agrees. When I make it I make a double recipe. One for me and one for my grandson. He takes it and shares it with his friends at his home and the kids at the college. I have made it several times. It's very easy and sooooo very good. Thanks for the recipes.  Joyce"
"0","5","this is soooooo good"
"0","5","Absolutely amazing. Mine weren't quite as pretty as the picture, but they were an instant family favorite!"
"0","5","This was so yummy - a hit with this family!! It went together quick & easy. I was so surprised at how good these were, given the few ingredients. It will be one of my pot-luck & Christmas morning go-to recipes for a long time to come. I didn't change anything about this recipe and was so glad I tried it as it was. I don't think any recipe rating is accurate if you modify it then try to rate it."
"0","5","I made this and they came out great! I sprinkles some powdered suger to make it look better and also tried making peach dumplings with peaches and Nehi peach soda. Those turned out great as well, but were a little soggy."
"0","5","SIMPLY NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THESE ARE. MY HUSBAND BEGS FOR ME TO MAKE THESE~ ENOUGH SAID."
"0","5","i can't believe I haven't rated or reviewed thos before now. This is one of my DH's favourite desserts, especially when served with homemade ice cream. It's an excellent recipe and so easy to make. It also works very well with ginger ale and Splenda may be used instead of sugar"
"0","5","This is easy and phenomenally delicious . I make these for our family Sunday meal and everyone loves them."
"0","5","My sister visited and this was super easy for us to bake together and super yummy! Also used fresh apples picked ourselves from the orchard. I will def be making this recipe again! Nice home cooked desert made in a jip! My sister loved it just as much as I did."
"0","3","Nice and easy recipe, but too sweet for my family. I did use 1 packet of regular croissants and one low fat and you couldn't tell the difference."
"0","5","I was looking for a easy recipe to make with my two young granddaughters. Whenever we try out a new recipe together, they are sure to let me know if it is a keeper or not. This one is a definite keeper! Thanks so much for sharing."
"0","5","These are awesome! Every single person that tasted one loved them!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS"
"0","5","This recipe is great! Every time that I make these I get great feedback. Too make these even more delicious I add the butter/sugar/cinnamon mix inside the dumpling with the apples. When it bakes it caramelizes the apples and it turns it into melt in your mouth goodness."
"0","5","I let the apples sit in a 50/50 mix of Mtn Dew/Dr Pepper for about 15 minutes while I mixed the wet ingredients. I also added vanilla-butter emulsion & tarragon (a rarely used but WONDERFUL addition to sweet recipes!) to the wet mix & lightly sprinkled some nutmeg directly on the crescent roll before I rolled the apples. I also split the sugar mix at 3/4c lite brown sugar & 1/4c white sugar. They came out SPECTACULAR!!! :o)"
"0","5","Excellent! Huge reward for little effort! I only cut down on butter and sugar. It was a big hit and so tasty!"
"0","5","Who knew something this easy would taste so great! I will be making this again!"
"0","4","I really liked this. I made some changes and next time I will make more. I used 3/4 cup of butter, next time I will use 1/2 cup. I will roll the apples in some of the cinnamon and sugar before rolling them in the dough. I only used 1/2 a can of Mountain Dew, that seemed to work out pretty good. Also I will use less sugar next time. I used a little brown sugar splenda (what I had left) and light brown sugar not packed combined 3/4 cup and 3/4 cup white sugar."
"0","5","I have made this recipe several times. I changed a few things though. I don't use the citrus soda at all and I don't pour anything over the outside. I roll each apple slice in butter, brown sugar, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Then wrap the dough around each slice and bake for only 20 minutes. This turns out perfectly with no mess."
"0","5","My sister-in-law made this and it was a big hit. I thought I'd give it a shot since it seemed so easy. Since I was in a hurry I thought I'd try to do it without referring back to the recipe since I'd read it several times. I did two things wrong. First, I DID core the apples but I forgot to peel them. Next, I added a tablespoon of cinnamon instead of a teaspoon. I figured all of this out AFTER I reviewed the video again. I was making these for my coworkers and I THOUGHT that they were going to be a disaster and just so I would show up with what I promised, I made a half size batch the right way. Well, After the first batch was done I decided to give em a taste test before trashing them. My mistakes turned out pretty tasty and the apple peel gave it a slight bit of tangy. I was so glad that I didn't have to chunk them in the trash. I might reduce the sugar the next time but other than that, I did pretty good even with the faux pas. The first batch also had a crisper crust than hers did. Not sure why but I liked the crunch. Maybe it was the extra cinnamon."
"0","5","I used 1/2 cup splenda instead of sugar and 1 can of spire zero. Rave reviews."
"0","5","Upon the advice of several reviews, I incorporated some vanilla and brown sugar into my mixture and used Diet Mt. Dew as that is what I had on hand. I usually don't enjoy cooked apples, however this was fantastic! Pair with some vanilla ice cream and you will not be disappointed!"
"0","5","I cut the amount of butter in half and followed everything else exactly and still came out amazing! Will try cutting butter down even more next time and see how that works...."
"0","5","Easy to make and very delicious-entire family loved it!"
"0","5","WOW.... so easy and absolutely AMAZING!!! I did have to use more than a wedge of the crescent dough on mine... maybe my apples were larger. But easy enough to do that!"
"0","4","These were surprisingly awesome !! Kinda lika a mix between a apple cobbler and a mini apple pie . Super easy and fast . My only complaint would be that it has a tad bit to much sugar so next time I would use diet MD and a little less sugar."
"0","5","This was a wonderful dessert. Not overly powering with apples or sweetness. I used 7-up and it was great. Agree with the other reviews to pour soda on the side to keep the dumplings crisp on top. Anxious to serve this for a party!"
"0","5","Everyone loved this! I had small Jonathan apples (about the size of a clementine). I peeled, cored and halved them. I used a half for each crescent triangle. I used a can of Ginger Ale since that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Outstanding. Hubby said, 'put this in the rotation AND don't forget to serve it at Thanksgiving'!"
"0","5","wow! amazing how mountain dew can make such a lovely dessert. I tried the recipe almost as a joke, because i used to have a major addiction to mountain dew (hard habit to quit) but i can cook with it right? well now ive got an addiction to cooking with mountain dew! ha!"
"0","5","This was eaten up. I did have to substitute orange juice for the mountain dew. Teenagers found my stash. Was still really good."
"0","5","These were sooooo good, melted in your mouth, not to sugary, just the right consisterncy. Thank you so much, will be making it over and over and over."
"0","5","Okay, I can be a bit of a food snob. That said, I LOVE these dumplings. So do my boys (12 & 15), who were mostly raised on food cooked from scratch. They don't even like most pre-made cereal, though they will eat Grape Nuts (yuck). They eat homemade bread and prefer for me to make their hamburger buns. Naturally, I was reluctant to try this recipe. Cresent roll dough? Um, no. Mountain Dew? That. Is. Just. Wrong. Still, it had a 5-star rating with almost 1700 reviews! Had to try it. Made it at a friend's house, who also drinks that soda in large quantities. I did reduce the sugar and butter by 1/4, though. I coated the apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture, too. The first time, I also only put in about 1/2 can of soda. It looked too wet. Toward the end of cooking time, I realized that I should have used the entire can. It was still great. The 2nd time, I made it for my boys, who aren't fruit pie eaters. My friend gave me a couple of cans of soda to take home. I added about 1/8 teaspoon of salt to the sugar mixture and used 4 apples, cutting each into 4 sections. After melting the remaining sugar into the butter, I also stirred in about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. My boys devoured these dumplings, including every last drop of sauce. I just made my 3rd batch this morning. I made sure to use original cresent dough each time. This was an amazingly tasty and easy dish. My 12 yo son asked me to make it for Thanksgiving. I think I'll let him do it with ginger ale. Try this recipe!"
"0","5","It was delish!! I did read the reviews & changed it a pinch: .1-cup white sugar, 1/2-cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp Cinnamon....and.... dipped the apples in (BEFORE ADDING BUTTER) that mixture first b4 wrapping in the crescent dough. AND I added a little less soda & a little Moscato wine.... snicker!! But it was DELISH!!!!!!!! Thank you for this recipe!!! Sincerely, Donna Collins, Panama City, FL"
"0","5","This recipe is delicious 'as is'! No change necessary!"
"0","5","This is amazing! It is so quick and easy I have no reason to ever make an apple pie again. I served this warm with french vanilla ice cream and spooned a little warm sauce over it. It was a huge hit!"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful, will definitely make this again!"
"0","3","I thought I followed the recipe to a t... maybe I didn't. These turned out like mush. I think maybe if I hadn't poured the soda over them maybe that would've helped?"
"0","5","I was a little skeptical at first, but who knew. It was the most delicious apple dumplings tasted to date. Not only was it great, it was simple to make. Thanks to the tips posted, I cooked the sugar in butter before adding to the apples to avoid soggy crust. I too used brown & white sugar. I've already gotten request for this recipe."
"0","5","I made this tonight and it was wonderful! Instead of 1.5 cups sugar I used 1/2 cup of splenda/brown sugar blend and 1/2 cup of white sugar. It was plenty sweet. I probably could have used less. Served it with vanilla ice cream...yummmy!!!"
"0","5","These are incredible! My family gobbled them up and I have since passed along the recipe to multiple people who have all loved it."
"0","5","Fantastic!! We loved this recipe. So easy and tasty. I cut the recipe in half for my husband and I."
"0","4","Super great, but with modifications. 1) one roll of crescent dough is enough. 2) keep the amount of apple the same, the ratio in the recipe didn't give enough apple per dumpling, in my opinion; 3) more cinnamon. Roll out the dough and sprinkle cinnamin, a bit of brown sugar and a dab of butter, this should make up about half of the butter in the recipe. I think that pouring a bunch of liquid over the rolls do make them soggy. Not entirely unappetizing to me, but not pretty enough for a party."
"0","4","These are pretty yummy. Not healthy at all but if you need a quick dessert for drop by company, this will do just fine probably!"
"0","4","This is an awesome apple dumpling short cut!! I usually make my mom's recipe with pie crust dough, whole apples, etc. But this is amazing."
"0","5","This recipe was awesome! I brought it into my office for everyone to enjoy and they loved it. My husband wants me to make it for home! It was extremely easy and definitely a keeper! Great recipe that I will be making over and over again!"
"0","5","One of the best desserts we've ever had! So easy, too. I used Diet Mt. Dew and half the butter. Yummmmmmmy!"
"0","5","Wonderful, I added extra apple and chopped some plumbs I had into the pan around the dumplings and it turned out great! Also I didn't have Mt Dew so I used cherry coke and that worked well too!"
"0","5","Very easy to make & divine with french vanilla ice cream. The original recipe is yummy but I've since tweeked it to about 1 tablespoon of butter & just enough soda to cover the bottom of the pan. I've used a small amount of apple juice instead on Mt. Dew in a pinch, didn't notice a difference."
"0","4","I will only give it 4 stars because it is way too sweet even for my husband who has a sweet tooth. The recipe is very easy to make and the apple dumplings taste very delicious. Will make it again with only 1/2 cup of sugar."
"0","5","Never would I believe that a baked good with a can of Dew poured over the top would be one of the best things I ever ate! Yum, yum, yum, yum! Don't forget the ice cream!"
"0","5","I make this recipe twice a month for my family. I ommitted the sugar and Mountain Dew, we're not crazy about the extra sweetness. We're looking for the rich fruit favor and crisp crust of the rolls. All-in-all it rseally a great recipe and I would recommend everyone preparing it at least during the holidays."
"0","5","I have made these as is and they are fantastic. I have also made them with 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda and they are very good also."
"0","5","These were so easy to make and delicious! Thank You!!"
"0","5","So simple and easy to make. I made this for dessert to go along with a roasted turkey and all the trimmings...they were fighting over the last two! Excellent!"
"0","5","Awesome!!!"
"0","5","Wonderful. Baked these for 40 minutes, the apples were nice and tender.  Perfect if eaten soon after they are done. Refrigerated for a night and the moisture makes them too soggy."
"0","5","This recipe is so insanely good! Followed the recipe to the T. Would not change anything at all!"
"0","5","So easy... and delicious..the only thing I did different was I used half and half brown and white sugar..instead of all white..."
"0","5","A friend made these and they were fantastic. Really good hot with ice cream.!!"
"0","5","YES YES YES!!!! So simple and so delicious!!!!! I will be making this again and again. Recipe is simple to follow."
"0","5","100 stars if I could. The best warm dessert ever. I did follow other reviewers and made sure not to use the buttery crescent rolls. It was a hit by all!"
"0","5","OMG!!!!!! Wonderful!!!"
"0","5","sooo amazing, melt in your mouth good and super easy to make"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe. The dough was soggy and overly sweet, the apples had no flavor and the syrup was actually too buttery. Will never make this again"
"0","5","Oh my goodness! Amazing! I just made these with my 8 year old daughter and it was fun and easy. We ate them fresh out of the oven and they were delicious. I can't wait to make these again and again! Thanks for a perfect recipe!!!"
"0","5","Holy Moly this was the most delicious dessert I've had in a LONG TIME! I can't wait to make these again. Although, I do feel that the butter and sugar were a little much. Next time I might cut the sugar and butter in half. Also, I used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew. Believe it or not, the local 7-11 didn't have Mountain Dew. Even with the Sprite this turned out perfect! I sprinkled the crescent dough with cinnamon before rolling up the apples and I also added some vanilla extract to the sugar/butter mix. This was absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","I was a little skeptical but I did try this recipe with only a few changes. After I cut up my apples I sprinkled them with brown sugar & cinnamon. I used 3/4 c of white sugar and 1/4 c of brown sugar and dissolved into the butter, this was Excellent & very EASY! Thank you my whole family loved them even my picky husband. Oh & I seen someone commented about it not tasting right bc of the crescent rolls, I believe if you are using Original & not Butter crescent rolls it is absolutley PERFECT! Thanksa Again! :)"
"0","5","I was skeptical because of the Mtn. Dew .... but seriously AMAZING. I followed the recipe as is --- soooooo good!!!!"
"0","5","These were fabulous! So easy! Thanks for posting."
"0","5","I did not think these would turn out so delicious. I put whipped cream on top but it would have tasted so much better with ice cream. I will definitely make these again, a great fall dessert!"
"0","4","This was very simple and very good, my husband was surprised how delicious they came out! Thank you"
"0","5","These were absolutely wonderful. We used fresh apples that were picked off the tree the same day and we think it really made the difference! Too good for words. Just sat there and stared at each other marveling at how good this came out. Mountain Dew, who knew?!"
"0","5","Awesome, easy, and delish! Thank you."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!"
"0","5","These are without a doubt the best apple dumlings that we have ever tasted. They are so easy, no changes needed, except we use a 'healthier montain dew', don't like the dyes and all. Thank you so much!!"
"0","5","I Love this its simple and easy to make and taste great..I add less white sugar and more brown sugar.."
"0","5","I made this for my Bible Study dinner. It was a hit:)!"
"0","5","awesome and quick. letting it cool after it comes out of the oven allows the sauce to thicken which is much better. Great the next day too"
"0","5","This is a great dish, dont pass it by"
"0","5","I tryed recipe very good !!!!!!! .I cut recipe in half,still 5 star. Thank,you lnicholscake@yahoo.com"

"0","5","Everyone loves them."
"0","5","My family LOVES these dumplings. I make them for the holidays and special dinners. The only change I make to the recipe is less butter."
"0","5","Absoulutely delicious and so easy! I would give it more stars if I could!"
"0","5","this recipe is phenomenal!!! When I poured all of that liquid over the top, I thought for sure the dumplings would be all soggy and doughy. But they weren't! What they do is kind of float to the top so they are crispy almost all the way around.   I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","~Simply delicious!~ I'd give it more stars if I could!!"
"0","5","Love this recipe. Very easy to put together and just delicious.   I did cut back on the white sugar and turned the dumplings 1/2 way through baking. I also used a little bit more apples in the dumpling. Wonderful!!!  Thank you docswife for such a great recipe."
"0","4","This was good, but I did not think it was better than any other I have made. You have to like crescent rolls to like this dish and I am not a huge fan of canned crescent rolls. The mountain dew was a sweet suprise and it did make a very good sauce. Overall it was good, I just did not like the crescent rolls."
"0","4","Made them for guests who came over. Everyone loved them. Will make them again, but will cut the butter, sugar and cinnamon in 1/2 next time. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","This was by far one of the best desserts I have ever had. My hubby (who is not a dessert person) took one bite and said 'oh my goodness, that is amazing!' My girls loved it too. I will definitely make this again."
"0","4","these are very good! I love sweet stuff but next time I will decrease the sugar and butter by half. I also will make the apple pieces larger-either quartered or halfs for a more apple flavor. Mine turned out very crisp on the top and a little soggy on the bottom but I think that is the way apple Dumplings are suppose to be. I definitely will make again :)"
"0","5","What can I say that everyone else hasn't already said, very good! My husband told me he commanded me to never make these for anyone else, he wanted to keep them all every time I make them, we're not sharing with company! LOL..."
"0","5","These are so simple and sooooo good. People never believe how easy they are to make! Very sweet."
"0","5","Just finished making these. Tried one and think I have gone to heaven!! Sooo yummy! Thanks for a great quick recipe that will be wonderful in the early fall."
"0","5","These are amazing. I made them and added vanilla ice cream. The reaction from my friends and family was beautiful. I watched my sisters and mother moan as they bit in. I was begged for this recipe. It's so easy but comes out tasting like heaven. Thanks for sharing it!"
"0","5","Fantastic! We made the recipe as directed the first time. This is also great with other white sodas (we tried Hansen's Mandarine Lime soda.) We also tried with 1/2 can soda, 1/2 c butter, 1 tbsp cinnamon, a little ginger, and 1 c sugar and it turned out just as great."
"0","5","These are fantastic! I thought they would be soggy but they had the right amount of crisp. Served with ice cream, these were amazing!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS! Easy! Yummy!"
"0","5","This is a wonderful desert or brunch item. I cut a 8 oz package of cream cheese into small chunks and put one chunk on top of the apple before I roll the dough over it. Delicious!"
"0","5","A little taste of heaven! I was not sure how they would come out especially after seeing mountain dew as one of the ingredients but they went far beyond my expectations. They were super easy to make and a BIG HIT for my family."
"0","4","Loved it! I added cinnamon sugar to the apples before wrapping as suggested by others. Top with vanilla ice cream and you're set!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","Hands down the best dessert I have ever made!"
"0","5","easy for something that could take along time. I simple replacement for pie in the summertime!"
"0","5","Absolutely declicious. I made this exactly as listed, except I did add 1 tsp vanilla flavoring to butter mixture and I served it with vanilla icecream. It was a big hit with my family and friends."
"0","5","Amazing!! Everyone loves it when I make them. They are perfect any time of the year!"
"0","5","Made this for company dessert and served with vanilla ice cream, they 'loved it'. Will definitely make this again."
"0","1","These did not turn out as I hoped. I may consider making these again without the soda."
"0","5","delicious and easy!! thankyou!! :))))"
"0","5","Always a hit, and very easy to make. Making it low fat doesn't seem to compromise the taste much, either - sometimes I use margarine, diet mountain dew, and reduced fat crescent rolls. My toughest critics can't tell."
"0","5","I was half afraid while making this because of all the sugar. I used half the butter/sugar mix, two teaspoons of sugar, and used three apples cut into six slices each (two slices left to eat plain) and it was the best thing since color TV! It was sweet even using the reduced measurements."
"0","5","This recipe is amazing. I have never made something so easy that tasted so good. I made mine with half regular crescent dough and half reduced fat and couldn't tell the difference in taste. I also changed it and did 1 cup of regular white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. And I used diet Mountain Dew because it's what I had on hand. These were beyond delicious. I've already recommended them to friends and family. This will be my go to dessert for parties, holidays, etc."
"0","5","This recipe is simple and OH SO tasty! Big hit with everyone who has tasted it!!"
"0","5","Way to easy to be this amazingly good!"
"0","5","FANTABULOUS!!! Have made this twice for my family they liked it so much. Super easy and next time I'll use the low cal dough and diet soda. Used 3/4 cup brown sugar second time around. Delicioso!"
"0","5","WOW!!! I had my doubts when I read the ingredients/directions but i read all the reviews so i thought what the heck I'll try it. I couldn't beleave how good it was. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was to die for. I'm looking forward to making it again at the next family gathering."
"0","5","I bought some fresh peaches from a farmer's market today and used them instead of apples. Absolutely amazing! I split each crescent into two smaller triangles and wrapped each peach slice. I melted one stick of butter and whisked about 3/4 cup of brown sugar, a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla. I only used about half of the mountain dew. I baked the wrapped peaches for about 8 minutes while I melted the butter and sugar, then poured that and the soda over the top. Vanilla ice cream made it perfect!"
"0","5","I just made these for a fourth of July BBQ and they were a big hit, so delicious!"
"0","3","I changed the recipe as follows: I used a quarter of an apple for each crescent roll. I used half brown/half white sugar, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 9pz of the mountain dew instead of 12oz. I added 1 1/2 cups toasted chopped walnuts to butter/sugar mixture. It became a much richer more carmel type of dessert. Great alone or with vanilla ice-cream. I reheated in microwave for 20 seconds if I took them from fridge and 1 minute if frozen."
"0","5","These were delicious. I made these a couple of weeks ago and they were a big hit. I'm making a double batch today for the 4th of July."
"0","5","Dynamite!"
"0","5","Love..love..love this recipe"
"0","5","I made this and took it to our usual restaurant for the staff to try...they almost ran me over to get the recipe. They are absolutely wonderful."
"0","5","I made this for my wife and I an it was fantastic, then I warmed it up several more times throughout the week for family and everyone loved it!"
"0","5","Super easy (great to do with your kids) and SO good!"
"0","5","I made these apple dumplings for my kids and mother-in-law and they absolutely loved it. Now every holiday or event, I always have requests to make it. Outstanding recipe!"
"0","5","Who needs apple pie when you can make these wonderful dumplings in about 45 minutes? I have made these many times and they never last long. I didn't change a thing, great with whipped cream or ice cream."
"0","5","OMG- IT WAS GREAT! SERIOUSLY- no joke!! I was a little hesitant about the mountain dew but it was wonderful. I change the recipe to serve 8 & added a lil more cinnamon & before it was done-added cinnamon & a little brown sugar to the top of each dumpling. BUT OVERALL- awesome!!! I PLAN TO MAKE THIS FOR THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR 2012 & FOR MY HUSBAND WHEN I LAND THE RIGHT GUY!! IT WILL SURELY PLEASE HIM!!! LOL :)"
"0","5","These were quite good. I can recommend this recipe highly even though it is odd. The dumplings are better warm with ice cream. I divided the recipe in half and it came out good."
"0","2","WILL TRY AGAIN  DUMPLINGS WERE SOGGY  AND COULD HAVE USED MORE APPLES  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED"
"0","5","Best apple dumplings ever!!!!"
"0","5","I found this recipe a month ago and have since made it 8 times. My family LOVES it and so do I. I adjusted the butter down to 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cups butter) and 3/4 can of mountain dew. These are just ridiculously good. Its nearly 1am and I'm waiting on a batch to come out before I head to bed if that says anything :)"
"0","5","This recipe is WONDERFUL. So very esay and the best thing since sliced bread. (haha) This is one of those recipes I should have never discovered. I will be making it all the time."
"0","5","As others have said these were suprisingly really good. I knew they would be good but even the next day cold they were still awesome."
"0","4","Outstanding simple recipe!!! Warning;DO NOT torture yourself as I did by having no vanilla ice cream on hand!!! I used puff pastry and they turned out great! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","5","How can something so simple be so delicious ?!? My Mother (Bless her soul) made the BEST apple dumplings and of course they were made from scratch. Even though these are not that 'pure', they brought back fond memories...they are a close 2nd to perfection! Would give more stars if I could."
"0","5","I just made these with cherries and they were the bomb!!!!! (awesome) and the apples were as well. Great and simple recipe. I used less sugar."
"0","5","These were AMAZING. Everyone loved them when I made them, super easy to make and yummy!"
"0","5","This is a keeper. VERY tasty!"
"0","5","So so delicious! I only used 3/4 cup sugar and diet mountain dew and it was still plenty sweet to me. The crescent dough only comes in 8 oz. cans but still worked well."
"0","3","I used less butter and sugar, it was still good but not fantastic like the reviews would suggest."
"0","5","Like other reviewers, I was skeptical about the soda, but these are deliscious!"
"0","5","Excellent and easy to make."
"0","5","These were amazing. I made them for a group of teenagers and they all loved them! I did cut the butter and sugar down as suggested. I used 3/4 c. butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar kept the cinnamon the same. I used about 3/4 can of mountain dew as well."
"0","5","This is VERY good! I've made it several times and it's always wonderful!"
"0","5","Tasty & easy! I've been looking for a dish that I could bring to family gatherings and NOW I've found it. Country Apple Dumplings always gets rave reviews from family members when I make it."
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely amazing!!!! Amazeballs amazingly good!! It is sooo simple and easy to make. I was soooo skeptical about the Mountain Dew soda in this recipe but I should'nt have been. I followed the recipe exact as written except i used a ll brown sugar in witht he white sugar... This is a real keeper !!"
"0","5","This is so good!!! I did was add the teaspoon of vanilla, and 3/4 brown sugar 3/4 white sugar. I used diet mountain dew. VERY GOOD!!!"
"0","5","Excellent! Made with a little less sugar and butter but WOW! These are great! I would highly recommend!"
"0","5","These are so, so, so good and so, so, so easy. OMG I don't usually care for granny smith apples but now I'm a big fan. Can't wait to make them again. You know they're good when the family fights over who ate the last one!!"
"0","5","Best ever!!!"
"0","5","My family LOVED this recipe! I'm normally not very good at baking things, but this was SO easy! I can't wait to bring this to someone's house for all the raves I am anticipating!!!"
"0","5","I made this recipes two days in a row, thebkids loved them and my husband want me to make some for his co-workers."
"0","5","Sooo good!! I didn't have all the butter required on hand so I cut back on the sugar to accomodate, I added the cinnamon and let the mixture simmer for a little while so it got a bit thick. I spread that over the dumplings and poured the Mountain Dew on top of everything. The result was a nicely caramelized, crispy top and soft and sweet bottom. Love!"
"0","4","I used about 1/4 of the Mountain Dew and was sure to avoid pouring over the top of crescent rolls as others suggested. Came out wonderful and the kids LOVED it. It was very rich, so next time I'll try reducing the sugar and butter by half."
"0","4","Very good, but really rich."
"0","5","I made mine with 1/2c Splenda blended sugar, 1/3c Brown sugar, & Smart balance butter. I'm sure if you follow the recipe to the tee...they would be SINFULLY delicious! Thanks for posting the recipe. I'll definitely be making this again and again. Super simple!"
"0","5","These are the B.O.M.B. bomb!!! I also added a few pecans (finely chopped) and cream cheese. Will be making these again and again. Thanks docswife for the wonderful recipe."
"0","5","Super easy and delish! I made it a tad more diabetic friendly - cut the butter down to 3/4 (I used 'I Can't Believe it's Not Butter), sugar down to 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar Splenda, followed other's suggestions to let sugar and butter thicken slightly and then add vanilla and cinnamon, and used a diet lemon lime soda. Love this recipe!"
"0","5","Very easy - very good! Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","good and easy"
"0","5","Very Good!! I definitely will cut down on the sugar and butter and mountain dew next time. This is a must make for sure!!"
"0","5","This is so so so good, I thought it was seird adding soda but i did it anyway and it was amazing, but instead of mountain dew i add ginger ale. this is a must try for you guys that are hesitan tto try this."
"0","5","Very very good!! Looks beautiful and easy to make....like that it doesn't require alot of ingredients or time...."
"0","5","The crescent roll packages are actually 8 ounces, not 10. Delicious recipe!"
"0","5","Only had one can cresent rolls so made buisquick biscuits and rolled out to triangles-tasted great! I also used diet sprite instead of Mtn Dew!! definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","OMG!! This was so good!! Even those who don't care for apples loved it!! Also it is a great recipe that the kids can help with. Am planning to take this to the christmas party this year and my family has requested that I make it again. Only change was that I did not have Mountain Dew so I used Ginger Ale"
"0","5","Delish! I didn't have Granny smith & used Harelson instead. They didn't hold their shape, next time it's Granny Smith. Also, tried to save sugar by using only 1/2 can of soda... Mistake! The sauce is so rich & yummy, with 1/2 of the soda, I only got 1/2 of the sauce. There was barely enough to go over ice cream. I Did cut down the butter to 1/2 c plus 2 tbsp as others suggested. The presentation & flavor are company worthy! I WILL make this again & stick with the changes I noted."
"0","4","very good and easy. made it twice. First time followed recipe exactly. 2nd time I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup splenda. 1 stick of butter great"
"0","5","Wow! Love these as is! Next time will reduce the sugar (maybe apple juice instead of mtn dew?) and just one stick of butter instead of 2? Only because we wanted to eat way more than is healthy! :)"
"0","5","This was a hit for a family of 2 boys that are very picky eaters!!!!  Wonderful!!! We will be using this recipe for upcoming occasions!!!"
"0","5","Yummy. I always love apple desserts. I drizzled a little caramel over the top just before taking out of the oven. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you'll fall in love."
"0","5","I made these for my parents and they LOVE them! I only had 1 stick of butter, so I didn't use as much butter and I used 1/2c brown sugar and 1 cup white sugarr. Also, all ll I had was Sprite, but they still turned out scrumptious! Thanks for this awesome recipe! Perfect for fall."
"0","4","This recipe was good. I messed it up though-but it ended up being for the best. I put the dumplings alone in the oven before putting them in the sauce... Cooked them about halfway through and then dunked em in the wet mixture (mountain dew included) and put them back in. The wet mixture was WAY too much. Anyways, I made my own custom recipe a little and put a teaspoon of cream cheese on top of the apple wedge before rolling it in the dough. Turned out great! I don't think I would have liked it as much otherwise."
"0","5","Super easy, super delicious"
"0","5","these were absolutely awesome!!use the recipe the first time, then u can substitute..."
"0","5","OMG! Try it with peaches also. Very Good! Everyone loves it."
"0","2","Just ok. I found the dough-to-apple ratio to be too heavy on the dough side. It got soggy and didn't have the crisp pie-crust texture to offset the mushy apple insides. To me it seemed that the soda only added novelty, not actual flavor."
"0","4","I read the postive and negatives and adjusted the recipe. I made the recipe the same amount, but dispersed the sugar sauce over three batches. I spooned the sauce on to each dumpling to cover it and then only put enought soda in to cover the bottom. Very good!"
"0","5","This is a super easy recipe and is delicious as is, I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"0","5","Fantastic! I cut the size of the recipe to 4 servings, and subbed Sierra Mist for Mountain Dew (because I had it already). Absolutely delicious recipe!"
"0","5","Everything they say is TRUE! I forgot and used diet Mt. Dew, and it didn't even matter! I'm going to make it a second time in two weeks, using diet Mt. Dew and less sugar as someone else suggested. Yum!!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious. When making I was skeptical bc there was so much liquid in the pan. My thought was that the bottom would be soggy and the topdry, but this was not the case. I also thought they wouldnt taste very good if left overnight, but they were great the next day. Yes, it is very sugary and you could use much less sugar if youd like. I would highly recommend this as a quick dessert. So easy you could make enough to feed everyone for the holidays."
"0","5","Awesome!!! I have an apple corer/slicer/peeler, so divided apples after putting them through the little apple peeler. Used 5 medium apples and licked the pan!!"
"0","5","for a diff taste try cranberry sierra mist. my kids loved it !"
"0","5","so easy to make and the family enjoyed"
"0","5","Amazingly good! I had my doubts... with the canned dough and pop, but Shazam! It was amazing. I used ginger ale, as we didn't have any Mt. Dew. I also used half the butter and sugar. We will have this again. I'd actually serve it to company."
"0","5","This is insanely good! I cut back by using one can of crescent rolls, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup 'sugar in the raw', 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and maybe a 1/4 cup of diet ginger ale (instead of mountain dew). Served it with vanilla ice cream….yummmmmm!"
"0","5","AMAZING...thats it, amazing"
"0","5","This recipe is excellent!!! I made a triple batch and it was amazing! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Will make again :)"
"0","4","I thought these were really good - next time I make them I will cut down the amount of sugar and butter - it was a bit much."
"0","4","tasty!"
"0","5","Exceptional taste and fun to make! I baked a double batch of these, and they were gone in a day. I only had 1 can of ginger ale, which worked very well. I enjoy baking yeast breads, so I made the dough from scratch using a simple recipe of 4c flour, 1 pkg (.25 oz) yeast, 1 Tbsp sugar and 1.5c warm water, allowing 20 minutes to rise before rolling out and cutting into crescent shapes. Will definitely make these again."
"0","5","Turned out great, only thing is the butter and sugar prolly could of been half that. It was a bit much, but very good! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","One of my favorite recipes. I've made this many times."
"0","5","Sooo good! Made this for a girls night and all of my friends loved it (and had fun guessing what was in it)!"
"0","5","WOW! My husband made these and they have become one of our favorites. He makes them just as the recipe is written. What a wonderful and easy way to make apple dumplings. What a great recipe. YUM!"
"0","4","This is a great and easy recipe, though I found that it probably didn't need all of the butter and sugar it called for. Will make again."
"0","4","This is a great recipe! Really easy, and it tastes delicious"
"0","5","Just like all the other reviews state, this is amazing. Not only is it super easy, but the taste is incredible!!! I'm (honestly) not a very good cook and even I could pull this off. . my family was very impressed."
"0","5","Delicious! My Mom has a recipe for Apple Dumplings that takes hours to make. This is close in taste and takes only a fraction of the time. Will make again!!!"
"0","5","One of my favorite desserts of all time and SO easy to make!! YUM! Thank you DocsWife!!"
"0","5","Wow!!!! I took this dish to the 131st Masonic Picnic. It's one of the oldest ongoing traditions in NC. It was inhaled!!! Yummy! It received lots of compliments and requests for the recipe. Tastes like an heirloom recipe. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","OMG you will NOT believe how freakin' good this is. Three in a bowl with a scoop of ice cream (even chocolate would work)...and you've got a HUGE chunk of heaven in that there bowl. Wow. Don't change a THING about the recipe...no kidding, IT'S PERFECT JUST AS IT'S WRITTEN."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious!"
"0","5","Yummy! I have to say that I could have eaten a whole pan of this myself. I would highly recommend this to any baker - quick, easy and DELICIOUS. I used the 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup of butter plus 1 tsp vanilla alterations that others suggested as well as alittle cinnamon on the apples before I wrapped them. Outstanding."
"0","5","Made these and took into work yesterday. One of my coworkers was moaning as she ate it. Great recipe! So easy and delish!"
"0","5","I have made these several times and they are delicious! My family prefers them with peaches instead of apples. You will never make peach cobbler again!"
"0","5","At first I wondered about a simple recipe getting such high ratings, but WOW! It is well worth the wait. I set it out on the table and if you were slow getting to your piece, then you missed out!"
"0","5","This smells delicious! I used the flat/sheet of crescent rolls for the top and bottom and made this cobbler style. Yum!"
"0","5","These are GREAT!!! I added the tsp. of vanilla like someone suggested and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar & butter mixture. I also put a little bit of cinnamon & nutmeg on the apples before wrapping them in the crescent rolls, but I think this recipe would be amazing with no revisions too! I was skeptical especially while pouring on the mountain dew, but they were soooo soooo GOOD and very simple to make!!"
"0","4","Loved how the tart/firm apple contrasted with the sweet sauce. These were a little TOO sweet though. We found that the pastry doesn't need to completely cover the apple. Next time I'll cut down the sugar as mentioned and cut a bigger apple slice. And... anything with cinnamon and apples HAS to be topped with chopped pecans. The nuts gave these a great crunch and extra flavor. Mmm."
"0","5","These are delicious! Husband & in-laws loved them!!"
"0","5","These are very good and were gobbled up quickly."
"0","5","These turned out fabulous-especially w/Blue Bell vanilla ice cream! Yum Yum"
"0","5","My family loved these! Thank you for sharing the recipe :)"
"0","5","I halved the recipe (thank goodness because we ate ALL OF THEM!!) and I used diet soda.  These were really great. We were amazed. I was wary because it looked like it was going to be a soupy mess when I put in the oven but they came out beautiful and delicious. My husband and I ate the entire pan."
"0","5","My husband was a bit skeptical when I took out the Mountain Dew, but they turned out to be amazing! So easy and so quick to put together. And with a bit of French Vanilla Ice Cream on to...to die for!  Definitely making them again and again."
"0","5","THANKSGIVING DESSERT 2011 So good! I would have never guessed that Mountain Dew was an ingredient to this delightful pocket of yumminess! Next time, I would like to add some sugar and spice to the apple filling."
"0","5","Amazing! Followed recipe exactly."
"0","5","Super fast and easy. Everybody loves them!"
"0","5","I had family coming over and I needed a quick dessert that would be easy to make especially since I had already spent hours cooking and I am 9 months pregnant! I found this one and it was perfect!! I read the directions to my daughter and she did it all by herself and she is only 9! Instead of doing a lot of sugar though we sprinkled cinamon sugar on top once all the liquids had been put on. Also, the only other thing would be the amount of butter was a lot. In the future I will just brush them with butter, but it was great!! We put vanilla ice cream on top and everyone loved it!! This recipe was a lifesaver!"
"0","5","These are so simple and they taste amazing!!! Rave reviews from my kids!I'm going to try them with peaches next! YUM"
"0","5","Just got done making these. They are great!! Hubby approved so that definitely means this recipe is a keeper!!"
"0","5","Apples and Cinnamon..yum!! What a wonderful treat this was! I am glad I found this recipe. I used grands biscuits and granny smiths apples. Easy to prepare and entire house smelled of cinnamony apples goodness. Make sure you stir the sugar and butter and cinnamon well before pouring over dumplings. Topped it off with vanilla ice cream while still warm."
"0","5","WOW! WOW! WOW! SO good! Even my super picky can't ever be pleased husband described them as 'perfect'! I'm not sure I've ever heard him say that before. Absolutely wonderful!"
"0","5","The one thing I changed, instead of cressent rolls I used cinnamon rolls, then I didn't need to add the cinnamon.This is the best recipe. I love that it is so simple, I can fix it up right before a meal and it is done in time for dessert."
"0","5","Made these for the teachers at my son's preschool for teacher appreciation week and they were a huge hit"
"0","5","I love apples and welcome any chance I get to use them in a recipe. This was a great dish and easy to make."
"0","5","These were a huge hit! Very tender, a slight citrus kick from the soda, and wonderful flavor overall. The overall opinion is they are at their best with vanilla ice cream on top!"
"0","5","In a word - OUTSTANDING!"
"0","5","This was absolutely awesome! I cut back a little on the butter and it worked out fine. I was surprised that they didn't get too soggy they came out just perfect! Who knew apply dumplings with mt dew would turn out so good!"
"0","5","I just couldn't believe how easy and absolutely delicious this was. I have given the recipe out to several of my friends and they all love it. This is definetly a keeper"
"0","5","All I can say is, 'Wow'! I made the 'diabetic' version with Splenda Blend and diet Mountain Dew. It was a hit. This recipe will be a regular for me. Thanks!"
"0","5","Amazing! Used 7 up instead... coated apples w brown sugar n cinnamon before wrapping... also cut sugar in half & it was still sweet enough for my family.... thanks for sharing this lovely recipe!!"
"0","5","A huge hit! Not recommended for diabetics though, as the recipe is listed here, lol. The only change I made was doing 3/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown. YUM!!!"
"0","5","AMAZING!!!! My husband said better than peach cobbler...and tha is his FaVORITE of ALL TIME!!! I served it with the Rum Sauce too......FANTABULIOUS!!! NEW FAVE!!!!"
"0","5","These go great with a la mode!"
"0","4","These were great! A little mushy on the bottom but with the crispiness on top I would say it balanced it out great! I kind of liked them even better cold the next day with my coffee! I followed the suggestions of others by cutting down on the butter and sugar - and used diet soda. Still plenty sweet and delicious!"
"0","4","Good, easy"
"0","5","So good!"
"0","5","Thank you for sharing..this recipe was really easy and very yummy!!!!!"
"0","3","These were okay.. they were swimming in the sauce though and way too sweet for my taste. I made them once months ago and never made them again if that says anything. I'd rather do a fruit cobbler any day- much easier and faster."
"0","5","They were fantastic, my husband keeps asking for more."
"0","5","I loved it! It was quick and easy. I made it for my Husband, I normal don't like apples but this was great!"
"0","5","I would give 10 stars if available. Easy and fantastic."
"0","4","Left out the Mountain dew because I misplaced it but it tasted great anyway! (Besides I am not a soda drinker so it was for the best.) Next time will try the full recipe just to try it! Simple and delicious - what more could you ask for?"
"0","5","I just finished making this recipe, and it is totally awesome!! I wondered why it had such stellar reviews, now I know. Thanks for a great recipe. It's a real ''keeper'"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","This recipe is fabulous and so easy. I followed the directions exactly, but was afraid the bottoms wouldn't get done. The bottoms weren't crispy like the tops but that's what makes them perfect. I have made them twice since last Friday and there are none to be found. Thanks docswife."
"0","5","I found this recipe by accident and asked two of my high school youths to bring a can of Mountain Dew each to the youth fellowship meeting at my home. They didn't know why they were bringing it. I made the dumplings and poured the pop over it and the kids in the youth group all thought I was crazy. As it turned out, they went crazy for these dumplings after tasting them! They now request them all the time for their snack after the bible study, except now they can make them for themselves! Super Yummy"
"0","5","These were incredibly easy to make. I did add a tsp of vanilla to the butter and sugar as one user suggested and they turned out great. This is one recipe I know I'll use over and over again."
"0","5","these are wonderful. Used Diet Mtn. Dew, Still great. Ty for recipe"
"0","5","My brother made this for Christmas dessert. A delicious and easy recipe! I will be making it soon."

"0","5","These are so good & so easy to make, had many requests for the recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is certainly a winner!! YUMMY!!"
"0","5","These are ridiculously good! Made them for a brunch at work and they were devoured. Had to give out the recipe to several coworkers. Have had to make them multiple times since. Followed the recipe exactly!"
"0","5","YUMMMMMMM!!!!!! Made it just as the recipe calls for and they were SO GOOD. Will be making these again!"
"0","5","So good! I sliced the apples thinner then instructed as the crescent roll wouldn't cover the large slices. Will make again and again!"
"0","4","These taste really good, but the bottoms of the crescent rolls are so soggy."
"0","5","SO GOOD! I couldn't stop eating them! Top it off with some ice cream right out of the oven."
"0","5","Delicious!!!!!"
"0","5","Agree with all the other comments, they're delicious. And so simple I made these with nieces and nephews as an after school treat, everyone was able to assist from 5 and up!"
"0","5","Excellent! I didn't have any white sugar so I used brown sugar, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out really great. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","This dessert is 'crazy good'!!! Crazy, because it's so easy to put together and tastes amazing! Such a simple idea, yet nice enough for company. I served it with vanilla ice cream. Awesome!"
"0","5","I've made this recipe for years after receiving it from a friend. It is now one of my most requested dishes at our large Thanksgiving gathering. Much easier than old fashioned apple dumplings."
"0","5","This is an awesome recipe and have been making it for some time. My husband requests this as his birthday cake! I use Diet MD to cut some of the calories and the results are as great."
"0","5","awesome taste and easy to make"
"0","5","GREAT!! I'm not a dessert person and I even liked it!!! I made 8 servings and they were all gone! I like Gala apples and I leave the skin on. You have to make this recipe!!"
"0","5","Oh MY GOODNESS! OH MY GODNESS! These are heaven on earth!"
"0","5","This was excellent!! My kids loved it!!!"
"0","5","I made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them! I was so surprised at just how good they were. Like others I used 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar. Melted the butter, added sugars and cinnamon and then cooked down into a thick syrup. Spooned over dumplings, that had been sitting in fridge for 3 hours, added Mountain Dew and then baked for about 40 minutes. May try to bake without the sauce once to get a crisper dumpling for those who like that but I love the chewy and crispy textures together. Wonderful recipe that is oh so easy!!!"
"0","5","So easy and tastes fantastic! Restaurant quality dessert!"
"0","5","Use slightly less sugar and butter. Try 1 1/2 sticks of butter and 1/2 each of white and brown sugar"
"0","5","Oh my goodness, these were amazing!!! I made them exactly how the recipe called (except i used diet mountain dew because its all i had). Everyone was asking for the recipe and couldnt believe how easy and delicious theu were. I took mine out of the pan right away though, there was alot of liquid in the 9x13 pan and i did t want them to get soggy. So that would be my only tip! Enjoy!"
"0","3","very good for canned bread, but the problem I found was the apple was just a small bit. The taste was fine... nothing exciting."
"0","5","OMG These are fantastic! I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and it was perfect. So quick and easy, and better than freshed baked apple pie in my opinion. Thanks so much for this recipe. I will be making this often."
"0","5","I have to tell you I wasn't sure about this at first with the mountain dew in there but this IS AWESOME!! My friends have renamed it the Apple Deliousness. The only thing I did/do differently; is that I use the 8 count cresant rolls instead of the 10oz rolls."
"0","5","Halved the recipe. It was excellent and easy. Will be making again soon."
"0","4","Four stars for being tasty and relatively easy to make, although (I'm guessing due to the pre-prepared dough and Mt.Dew?) these had a kind of processed or not-homemade flavor to them (think 'boxed cake'). Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Despite the odd ingredients, I tried this recipes because of the reviews. Boy was I surprised! Before I could even sit down to try it myself, my husband and father-in-law were back for seconds! I made two minor changes of sprinkling the apples with cinnamon before wrapping them, and doing half white and half brown sugar. It does not state in the recipe anywhere, but this dessert is best served WARM and vanilla ice cream is PERFECT with it! Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","SO easy and SOOOOO Yummy!!! Very addictive! Don't be scared about the Mountain Dew! It turns out wonderful. I used about 1 1/4 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough for everyone."
"0","5","OMG these were SO good! And SOOOO easy!! I would give them 10 stars if I could. I followed the instructions exactly, except I added a touch of vanilla. I will make thse often, its a great recipe!!"
"0","5","Wow, this is awesome! I used reduced fat rolls and diet Mt. Dew. Still a little sweet. I may use a tad less sugar next time. It's still great, a keeper for me. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","These were so easy and delicious! Hit the spot!"
"0","5","This is the best recipe! We have made this recipe many times just the way it is and we have experimented with sugar/butter amounts and ginger ale/mt. dew. (Personally, love the ginger ale in it!) All of them turned out great! The latest creation was using peaches. We quartered them and it was SOOOOOOO yummy! Thanks so much for a great recipe!"
"0","5","This is a great and delicious recipe! Really easy, it's great for beginners like me. I made this for me and all my roomates and they loved it! The only changes I made was using Smart Start butter and a little less Mountain Dew."
"0","5","Loved it! Added pecans on top."
"0","5","I used Grand biscuits in place of crescent rolls, Splenda in place of sugar, and Diet Mountain Dew to reduce some of the calories and this turned out fabulous!! I flattened the biscuits with my manual pasta maker and followed the rest of the recipe directions."
"0","5","Delicious and easy! I was just cooking for me so I reduced the amounts, and I pretty much just guesstimated. So this recipe is very forgiving. I used Diet Mountain Dew and reduced fat crescent rolls. And I put way more apple in each dumpling than directed."
"0","4","Easy and very good. Only complaint is that it was way too buttery. I would cut back on the butter next time."
"0","5","So easy and absolutely fail-proof. What an awesome recipe!!"
"0","5","Oh My God ~ my cranky hubby who never likes anything thought these were excellent. I made these EXACTLY like the recipe stated and they were absolutely magnificent."
"0","5","Yumy, yum, yum. My family loves these. Only thing I do differently is cut the butter in half and sprinkle a little more cinnamon on the top before baking."
"0","5","Can't believe how good this is... and very simple to make!"
"0","5","This is a real stand out recipe. I was very skeptical, but made this for a 4th of July party and despite my inept skills it turned out wonderful."
"0","4","These dumplings are sinful and addictive. I cut cut the sugar as some suggested to 3/4 cups of sugar, 1 stick of butter and 8oz of soda and it still came out perfect. I can't wait to make them again for guest."
"0","5","Easy!!!! And the kids loved it!!"
"0","5","Easy and super yummy!! Followed the directions exactly and turned out great!"
"0","4","This turned out great! The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 sugar 1/2 brown sugar. I didn't have enough regular sugar. When I make this again exactly like the recipe states I will give it 5 stars. Thanks for a great recipe"
"0","5","My grandson (12yr) made this last night... he added a little grated nutmeg, used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and half the amount of butter. It was terriffic served with a little vanilla ice cream... He was pretty impressed with himself and I have to say, it looked easy to make and impressive to eat..."
"0","5","These are fantastic. I made them for a Christmas gathering and everyone wanted the recipe. I loved telling them that there was Mountain Dew in it. No one could believe it. Awesome for so little work. Followed recipe exactly!"
"0","5","I have to admit I was a skeptic. these are so easy and sooooo good!!!"
"0","5","This is soooo YUMMY!!! Add a scoop of ice cream and mmm heavenly!!"
"0","4","This was good and sweet. My husband loved them with ice cream."
"0","5","Made these several times and absolutely incredible every time. TONS of raves! Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Just make it as is and yuuummm...."
"0","4","VERY good recipe..I will definitely make these again..the change I will make will be LESS butter! It comes out (on the bottom) way too soggy!!"
"0","5","It's so easy to make! Every time I make them, people ask me for the recipe. My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves to help me make them and serve them with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Exceptionally easy and yummy. I followed the recipe, except sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the apples and added a touch of freshly grated lemon peel, before rolling them in the dough. I used brown sugar in the sauce, as other cooks had suggested, and will be making this dish again!"
"0","5","These were so delicious and extremely easy to make. My dad, who is very picky, really liked these! My only tiny bit of advice would be to cut the sugar to 1 cup because the Mountain Dew adds the extra sugar. But overall they were wonderful."
"0","5","I don't like apple desserts but this was a good one! By far the best apple dessert out there!"
"0","5","I was really skeptical about this recipe and after I put it together and looked at it, I thought it was not going to be good, but seriously it was delicious. I cut back on the butter and sugar and added a tad vanilla and it was perfect. Served with Vanilla icecream. Yum!"
"0","5","I loved them, hubby and kid thought they were ok, but I think they were great...and easy. I only had chocolate chip ice cream, and while it was good plain, it was soooo much better with the ice cream (plain vanilla would be better)."
"0","3","These were flavorful & looked great with a touch of powdered sugar on top. I will add vanilla next time put more apple in the dough & cut back on the sugar & butter as others suggested. The bottoms came out SOGGY, NOT GOOD! I will try this recipe again & flip the dumplings after the first side is browned or bake dry first and then add in the liquids later. Hopefully that will take care of that issue."
"0","5","How SINFUL are these!! Oh my God, these have got to be one of the greatest desserts ever found. I used Sprite since I didn't have Mountain Dew - they came out terrific. Thank you, thank you for a recipe that sent my guests over the top."
"0","5","Love it! Do not change a thing!"
"0","5","Easy and Delicious! I am not very good at baking sweets, but I felt like a professional baker after I tasted these."
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely delicious. I have made this recipe for several years now. It's a great dessert, brunch treat, and has been a hit at several covered dishes. The only thing my recipe called for that is different is using ginger ale instead of citrus soda. It's also great with a scoop of vanilla icecream. Enjoy!"
"0","5","These were awesome. Who knew?"
"0","5","Followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers. I used: 3/4 cup butter. 1 cup white sugar. 1/4 cup brown sugar. 1 tsp vanilla. I didn't have any ice cream but I'm going to run out tomorrow and get some. :)"
"0","5","Normally this isn't my type of dessert... I'm a chocolate girl. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by these. I served them warm with vanilla ice cream and they were a hit."
"0","5","AMAZING! don't change a thing! So easy to make and a huge hit at all dinner parties!!!! I double the recipe every time I make it and treat the neighbors! Everyone dies for the recipe!!!"
"0","5","Sinfully delicious! Betcha you can't eat just one. I halved the recipe when I made these as a 'test run'. The only thing I might change is maybe use a little less mountain dew as it seemed mine were swimming in it. A great company dessert! Simple to make on a short notice and already have ingredients in the house just in case."
"0","5","These were really good! I didn't have any mountain dew so I used sprite, but it probably tastes the same either way."
"0","5","Don't even think about considering another apple dumpling recipe. This one is quick, easy, and most of all, delicious!! My entire family has declared this their favorite dessert. I follow the recipe exactly, and it always comes out perfect."
"0","5","Easy and so yummy!!! Followed directions and came out perfect. I also used non-stick metal pan worked great."
"0","5","We really enjoyed this yummy dessert warm from the oven with creamy vanilla ice cream. What a treat! I'm sure to make this one again and again."
"0","5","I have made this numerous times. I always use store bought pie dough cut into eight. I have also used sprite as the soda and it comes out fantastic each time. I always serve it with vanilla ice cream and everyone loves it...."
"0","5","Did not have soda, but did have a lemon; squeezed a lemon and used the zest, added 4 oz water to the butter/sugar mixture. Used 2 small granny smiths, cut in quarters, and a sloppy half-measure of the other ingredients. A forgiving, delicious recipe--this is in my forever repertoire. Thank you!"
"0","5","This is one the best recipes I have come across. It is so simpe and it taste so good."
"0","5","This is so good that the men in our group go home and make it themselves!! Now that's saying something."
"0","3","Too much butter, too much sugar, not enough apple"
"0","5","What an awesome and easy recipe. Will be making this again soon!"
"0","5","Absolutely AMAZING!!!!! There are no other words. Just treat yourself and make these!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT - Steve loved!!!"
"0","4","Taddy made these and they were very good!"
"0","5","I've had this at a friend's house and it is to DIE for!!! So rich and yummy. I am going to try it for dessert tonight with some of the lower sugar suggestions others have made. Can't wait!!"
"0","5","Sooooo Yummy! Followed the recipe and it was delicious!"
"0","5","Could not believe how good these where---using Mountian Dew & Cresent Rolls?!?! Wow, what a surprise....sooooo easy too. Don't forget a scoop of vanilla icecream."
"0","5","Outstanding! These are just so good......the only changes I made were: 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, reduced fat crescent rolls and a little less butter. Perfect."
"0","5","Simply delicious. Everyone raved about them. And so easy. Thanks"
"0","3","I followed the directions exactly..... The tops turned out great and they tasted good, but the bottoms were very mushy... All that liquid just prevented the bottoms from cooking throughly... I'm unsure how to fix that problem. I didn't even want to reheat them the next day... Sorry."
"0","5","Soooo easy and good. Take to a potluck."
"0","4","We liked very much. I think I will try cutting down on the sugar next time and I might try to bake a little longer. Only the fault of my oven, not the recipe. Will make again."
"0","4","This sounded so different that I had to try it. They were easy to make and delicious. I didn't change a thing."
"0","2","I made this exactly as the recipe listed. It was ok in my opinion."
"0","5","Tried this with peach slices and Diet Mountain Dew and oh my goodness...they were SO good! We really, really loved this recipe!"
"0","5","Two words...amazingly delicious"
"0","5","My 10 year old son and I made these outrageous dumplings tonite with the following changes: 1 large Fuji, 1 container crescent dough, then for the sauce we melted 1/3 c butter, added 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown to that. Once thickened, we added 3/4 t cinnamon and 1 t vanilla. Poured sauce over the apple bundles we had placed in a Pam sprayed 8 x 8 dish, then poured half a can of diet sprite over all, baked as directed and served w/vanilla ice cream. Thank you so much for posting this! My son says HE LOVES COOKING now, and I enjoyed the time with him!"
"0","5","This recipe is excellent."
"0","5","This is my 2nd time making this dessert. All I can say is AWESOME! I impressed alot of important people in my life....My parents, My husband....and My wonderful children ages 14, 10 and 5."
"0","5","These dumplings are our new Christmas tradition!"
"0","5","yummmmm. i was not prepared for how good these were. my boyfriend loved them. sooo easy. you have to try these!"
"0","5","Wow! I've made this five times since Thanksgiving and my friends and family cannot get enough. I've had sooo many requests for the recipe. They are EXCELLENT!!!"
"0","5","Amazing recipe, so easy and delicious!!!"
"0","5","These were amazing, so simple yet so delicious. The only change I made was to cut the white sugar to a ½ cup and added a ½ cup of brown sugar."
"0","4","great dumplings. does not reheat well"
"0","4","These were very good, very easy, but almost too sweet for our taste. I may make them again, but not something I definitely will make again."
"0","5","easy directions didn't change anything this was great and super easy"
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic! My husband and I love it!"
"0","5","Delicious. Surprised my boyfriend, he didn't think he would like the texture."
"0","5","Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone fell in love with it. It was wonderful with vanilla ice cream and it was so easy to make. The only change I made was add a half cup of brown sugar to one cup of granulated sugar."
"0","5","Looks like I spent all day in the kitchen, but the recipe is super easy! I even made it in our RV on a camping trip. Delicious!"
"0","5","OMG! This was without a doubt the BEST dessert I have ever eaten and I usually don't say that unless there is chocolate involved! I made these for Thanksgiving, followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions. My son gave one to every person who came by the house that day! Did not have ice cream to go with them but they really didn't need it. All I can say is WOW!"
"0","5","This was so easy to make and everyone LOVED them!!"
"0","5","To die for!! To make these more figure friendly, I use low fat crescent rolls, diet mountain dew and Somersweet instead of sugar. (Somersweet is a delicious product put out by Suzanne Somers that I often bake with. It is virtually calorie free, natural and bakes well.) I also like to dice up the apples."
"0","5","My husband stated these were 'possibly the best thing I have ever made.' I substituted brown sugar for 1/3 of the white and added 1 tsp of vanilla after the sugar melted. I think that next time I will let the syrup thicken a little more before pouring over the dumplings and use only 8-10 oz of mountain dew (diet) since there was a little too much liquid in the pan."
"0","5","Great! Do not change a thing."
"0","5","This is absolutely......delicioso! !! Yum...yum Muy rico. Easy to make and wonderful to taste.....wow.. I wanted to try it before ....... making it for Thanksgiving ......also we are going to the mountains on Christmas Week, this will definitely be the dessert for one of the menus......"
"0","5","This was absolutly sinful!!! My entire family loved this recipe. It was even better once it had cooled off. I will make this over and over again."
"0","5","Soooo good. My husband doesn't even like sweets and he finished all the dumplings within a few days. Planning on making them for my famiy for Thanksgiving with some ice cream...can't wait!!!"
"0","5","When I first saw the recipe I thought, that's just crazy and then I made them and thought, that's just the most delicious apple dish I had ever eaten. Have given the recipe to everyone who has ever eaten it at our home. Yummy yummy."
"0","5","So easy and so delicious. This is a great recipe for a quick dessert."
"0","3","They turned out better than anticipated, but still nothing like the real thing..."
"0","5","If you like crescent rolls and apple pie, this is a delicious & easy dessert for groups. It's sweet, but the apples stay crisp without getting mushy. Telling people that the secret ingredient is MD is kinda fun, but we were wondering if the caffeine affects people. I made 4x the recipe to fill a 9x13 pan (I had a few extra apple slices that I threw on top, and which baked nicely in the sauce.) Definitely let it sit for ~10 min after it bakes to let all the liquid soak into the dumplings."
"0","4","I have made this same recipe with peaches in the last, and liked it better that way. This is still a great recipe, and my family loved it."
"0","5","Made this recipe this morning. Yummy. Except for using Honeycrisp apples, I followed the recipe to a 'T' . These were very good, and easy. I will definately make these again. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","One of the moms brought these to a football banquet. I tried them even though I normally do not like apple desserts and immediately knew I had to have the recipe. Try serving them warm with natural vanilla ice cream and caramel topping. To Die For!!"
"0","5","These were absolutely delicious. I used a little less butter and sugar. Can't wait to make again."
"0","5","One word, YUM"
"0","5","wouldnt have believed it except someone fed them to me! have been addicted ever since, made them 4x in the first week after trying them! really really good and easy!!"
"0","5","This was so good. I halved the recipe. I used diet mountain dew and also used 1/2 sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar."
"0","5","Delicious! I halved the recipe and cut the butter in half again and only used 1/2 cup of sugar. It was plenty sweet. It's a keeper."
"0","5","these were so awesome! I used 1/2 c. white sugar, 2-3 tbsp brown sugar, and 1/8 c. splenda to make a half a batch. They disappeared fast!!! I will make them again. DON'T MISS OUT-- MAKE THESE SOON!"
"0","3","Sweeter than I like. And flavor was too simple for me - if that makes sense. Easy enough that little ones would enjoy making and eating."
"0","5","I have made this several times and it is great every time. Simple and delicious. I use Gala apples as they are the favorite around my house, and I halve the recipe. We always serve it hot with vanilla ice cream. So good!!!"
"0","5","Oh my god these are sooooo good!! I was a little worried about adding the Mountain Dew but don't be these are so wonderful! I did halve recipes since its just me and my husband and I added a little more cinnamon. But even my hubby who isn't a fan of apples loved it!"
"0","5","THESE WENT OVER REALLY WELL. MADE A LOT SO I GAVE SOME AWAY."
"0","5","So easy to make and even easier to get rid of!"
"0","5","awesome! I mixed white sugar & brown sugar. These were delicious & super easy!"
"0","4","This was incredibly good, and even easier to make. It took me like 5 minutes to prep it and throw it in the oven. Only four stars because it is so unhealthy (but hey, it is dessert...!) and because the crescent dough wasn't quite as flaky and yummy as homemade dough. The only changes I made were to use medium size apples quartered, instead large apples cut into eight pieces, so there was a little more apple to dough ratio. I may add a dash of vanilla next time, but it's probably not needed-was plenty good without!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicous. There was a lot of liquid left over which I drained from the dish. I will be making this again. My three-year old enjoyed helping me roll the apple wedges in the dough. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Fantastic served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! My daughter and niece put this together and thought it was super easy. We all loved it!"
"0","5","D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S !!! My whole family devoured this dessert. Easy as pie, and so so so good. Next time I'm going to use a little less butter, so I won't feel as bad about eating it But a very nice treat desert that was super easy to make."
"0","5","FANTASTIC recipe! VERY easy but yet a recipe that you could definitely serve to guests. This recipe will definitely be made over and over again in our house!"
"0","5","yum...very good...very rich...."
"0","5","This was excellent! Everyone always begs for the recipe. Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","This was really good. I only made half a recipe...big mistake as they were all eaten (mostly my my Dad) that night. My Dad loved these, he was even bragging to his friends about how good they were, something he hardly ever does. I make these for him all the time now."
"0","5","I'll admit I only tried this recipe out of curiosity, but everybody LOVED it so much that I made it three times in one month for guests! Everyone asks for the recipe. I did two things differently. The 10 oz. can of crescent rolls contains the rolls that are bigger and flakier than the originals, and come 6 in a tube instead of 8. They worked much better than the smaller size rolls. I just chopped up the remaining apple wedges and sprinkled them around the dish. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and cooked it til thick, then spread it on top of the dumplings before pouring the soda on top. It was just like thick, buttery caramel after it baked. You really have to try this recipe if you're skeptical like I was!"
"0","5","I was looking for an apple dumpling recipe and I just had to give this one a try. I am so glad I did! I cut the recipe in half, used 1/2 cup sugar, and 6 oz. of Sprite. My family LOVED them. A perfect 'comfort' dessert. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","These will cause an instantaneous heart attack and sugar overload but they *are* delicious."
"0","4","Really good! I just need to perfect my technique and baking time I guess, the tops were a little done and the bottoms a little soggy, but they were STILL really tasty. I will definitely make this again."
"0","4","LOTS of sugar! I even cut back a little based on other reviews. They tasted good though :)"
"0","5","I was surprised how good these were! I followed the recipe exactly and they were delish. Next time i will half the recipe as it's just me and my husband and we ate them all in 2 days. Will definately make again."
"0","5","Delicious. I made them the first time with regular size crescent rolls; then the second time bought the jumbo crescent rolls which made 12 and fit just right in the 9x13 pan. Same cooking time and other ingredients. Truly fabulous."
"0","5","I made these with my granddaughter the other day and we had great fun. She loved making them and loved eating them even better! Everyone was impressed that she helped make them. Definitely a fun grandchild project."
"0","5","Absolutely amazing recipe. I read most of the reviews and thought the recipe couldn’t live up to the hype but I was wrong. Easy and delicious! Serve warm with vanilla ice cream and even the most critical guest will be raving. Thank you docswife."
"0","5","These are amazing. Of course, what wouldn't be amazing with a cup of butter? I suspect that you could cut down on the butter and sugar in this recipe and still get a great result. I will try that next time. I also used 7-up instead of mountain dew and I believe it didn't change the outcome of the recipe. This will be my go to recipe for apple dumplings from now on, without a doubt!"
"0","5","These dumplings are fabulous! I have made them twice this weekend. I can't get enough. The first time I couldn't find Mountain Dew so I used 7up and they were just as tasty. Love them!"
"0","5","Delicious and easy. Don't change a thing!"
"0","4","Made this for the first time this evening and the hub and I both really liked it. I followed some of the suggestions and used reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also used a Jonagold instead of a Granny Smith apple. Next time I might cut the apples into 4ths rather than 8ths. We'll see... Either way they're really yummy and VERY simple to make."
"0","5","Very good. If you let it cook to long or get put it on the top rack the sauce gets sticky. Will make this again!! a keeper!"
"0","5","Easy & scrumptious!"
"0","5","I too changed up the recipe a little bit. There are only two of us so I made 4 dumplings. First of all, I had some pie crust dough left over so I used that, which we liked much better because it was flaky instead of doughy. I also used half stick of butter, 1/4 cup splenda for baking and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also used sweeter apples which we also liked better. Like another reviewer, I mixed everything together, including the soda (I used sprite) and poured it over the dumplings. YUM!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe to a T and all I can say is DELICIOUS!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","A quick & delicious dessert to make"
"0","5","I served this wonderful dessert along with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. My husband took a bite and said, 'WOW..This is the best dessert you've made in a long time!' This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","Very good. Easy to make with the children. I mixed the Mountain dew into the sugar and butter. Worked great sauce thickened up as it cooked. All around delicious. Will make again."
"0","2","I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. The top was nice and crispy and the inside wonderfully warm. It was a little too much dough for the amount of apple used. My biggest disappointment was the bottom. I expected gooey but the bottom was slippery and disgusting...almost as if they dough was only slightly cooked. I've considered trying again and actually cooking them for 10 minutes or so BEFORE pouring the mixture over it. Maybe using a little less liquid as well. If I do attempt this I'll edit my review."
"0","5","Absolutely superb! This recipe was so easy to make. It's delicious with vanilla bean ice cream."
"0","5","Loved this recipe. So yummy! I used a mixture of brown and white sugar. Thanks docswife."
"0","5","SO easy and tasty. Yum yum!"
"0","5","Holy cow, amazing! followed the recipe exactly, wouldn't change anything."
"0","5","I used half an apple and rolled the crescents a little thinner. Wanted more apple taste. Cut the butter and sugar in half to reduce calories. Topped with unsweetened fresh whipped cream. A definite keeper.Yum! Thanks"
"0","3","Don't know what I did wrong :("
"0","5","I got this recipe a few years back from the Pioneer Woman's website. It is sooo sweet but so good!"
"0","5","This is an amazingly simple and tastey apple recipe!! My husband is an apple fanatic and he loved it. Served it hot with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream!! Perfection..."
"0","4","These were good, not exactly what I was expecting, but good. The next day is when we thought the dumplings tasted the best."
"0","5","oh my gosh what a great surprise this was. I was not sure because of the mt.dew but it was AWESOME!!!!!"
"0","5","Very good. I cut butter and sugar in half and added about a tablespoon of cinnamon. They were plenty sweet and rich. Will make again and again!"
"0","5","This recipe was awesome. My husband who is a very picky eater, raved about this one. Thanks!"
"0","4","everyone loves this one"
"0","4","A little expensive. Easier to use bisquick & roll/cut, wrap. Don't use as much butter!"
"0","5","Amazing!!! These were delicious and so easy. They were so quick to prepare and tasted great. I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and a shake of cinammon. You could probably even use a little less butter. Thanks so much for such a quick, easy, tasty recipe."
"0","5","These are so amazing! Even after all the great reviews I was still skeptical about the mountain dew, but you can't even taste it. All you have is a wonderful sweet syrup that tastes heavenly! We devoured them in a day!"
"0","5","I really liked these dumplings! They were super easy and really good. Next time, I will probably use less butter in the sauce. But overall, they were a hit at my fall party."
"0","5","If I could give this more than five stars I would! Oh my....this is a new family favorite. Thanks!"
"0","5","So sinfully yummy! I used sprite instead of mountain dew and was great!"
"0","4","I made this recipe exactly as written and also using brown sugar (half recipe of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, and vanilla). I preferred the version with brown sugar, thus only 4 stars since it's not the exact recipe. I think the brown sugar takes the extreme sweetness of the white sugar only version down a notch. But this recipe still rocked -- super easy to make and is ridiculously good for such little effort!!!"
"0","5","Just made these. They are phenomenal and could not be easier. I used low fat, store brand crescent rolls that I had on hand and used two 8x8 pans since I couldn't find my big one. Really awesome and the house smells great. Thanks for the recipe. :-)"
"0","5","Heavenly! I immediately wolfed down three of these and I usually don't eat dessert. I have to beat people back from the oven because it smells wonderful when its cooking. This recipe is now included in our football sunday menu. Thank you!"
"0","5","OMW....these are the best! All of my dinner guests wanted the recipe!!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe! Didn't make any modifications to the recipe and it turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Delicious! I used Splenda Sugar Blend, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, and Diet Mt. Dew. **According to my Weight Watcher calculations,this is a 5 point treat!**"
"0","5","Awesome! I made these today and they are great!! Very easy to make too. I think next time I will reduce the butter a little; however, my husband loved them just as they are! Will be added to my collection!!"
"0","5","My mom has been bragging up this recipe for the last 2 falls. Finally, decided to try it myself. Took to husband's school in the am, by the time school got out had 3 requests for the recipe. Plus, the Mountain Dew part made those who originally passed on them, decide to try it & they loved it too. NOT FOR THE DIETERS!"
"0","5","This is a dangerous, dangerous recipe. Way too delicious and way too easy."
"0","5","You HAVE to make this dessert!! They are unbelievable! I only used one apple and one can of reduced-fat crescent rolls (BTW, I used one of the things that core the apple and cut it into 8 pieces in one motion. You still have to peel it but so easy!!). Like others, I reduced the sugars: 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/8 cup brown sugar and about 1/3 cup butter (eyeballed it). Not sure it even matters, as long as you get a nice, syrupy sauce to pour over the dumplings. In fact, I had to use Fresca (peach, no less) to pour over since it was the only soda in the house! Came out FABULOUS! I had to put the rest away after hubby and I had two each for fear we would eat them all lol!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! I made this recipe, and was VERY skeptical about the Mt. Dew, but it was fantastic. My kids devoured it, as did I."
"0","5","My family and I loved these so much! My daughter was extatic becuase I never let her have Mountain Dew to drink! We ALL went back for seconds! This is a fantasic recipe: easy, inexpensive ingredients and so so delicious!"
"0","5","Holy moly, are these good! I found this recipe, and forwarded it to a friend in the office who likes to cook. I haven't made them yet, but he made them last night and brought me one today. I cannot believe how delicious these are for such a simple recipe. I can't wait to make them myself!"
"0","5","'Wow!' That is all my husband could say over and over. This was easy, quick and so very delicious! Yum!"
"0","5","This has got to be one of the best things I have ever tasted....heavenly! Not to mention easy and quick to make! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Really good - I think in the future I will try and cut the sugar and the butter. Really easy to make and very tasty! Oh, I used diet mountain dew - it was good."
"0","5","I could never imagine myself making apple dumplings as I thought it was quite time consuming! This is the BEST! They all went! Even better the next day! Thank you for a delicious and QUICK recipe!"
"0","5","These were so good .I followed the recipe to a t...the best apple dumplings i ever had,or made,you have got to make these.You will not be sorry.im sure not!!!"
"0","5","How Wonderful!!! I used honeycrisp apples. that was the only difference.. they're amazing!! i served them with vanilla ice cream and some of the warm syrup.. omg YUM!!!! thanks for the easy and great recipe!"
"0","5","This was AWESOME!! Very easy to make. My dad was licking the pan clean!!! Yum!"
"0","5","Wow! What an awesome recipe! It was wonderful and this is the only way I will make apple dumplings from now on. It was so easy and delicious. Thanks docswife!"
"0","5","I'll agree that these were very tasty, but I'm wondering how other people fit 16 of these in one 9X13 pan? I ended up splitting them over two pans. Came out good, even better with a spoonful of vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","I halved the recipe, added pecans and (because I absolutely hate Mountain Dew) I used Ginger Ale. I think the soda part of this recipe can be subbed with just about any drink. Was super EASY and very tasty served warm with a big ol' scoop of vanilla bean ice cream."
"0","5","So tasty! Easy to make and a hit with everyone! Served with a scoop of ice cream and they were perfect!"
"0","5","This was so yummy and easy! I'm not a fan of mountain dew at all so I was hesitant to try this recipe but I'm glad I did! Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","Absolutely the best ever, Super easy and the reviews say it all."
"0","5","I made this for me and my husband tonight for dessert and it was a piece of heaven on a plate !!! I did follow some of the adjustments from other viewers and went with half of the recipe and I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I also made a vanilla sauce to drizzle over the top: 1 can sweetened condensed milk 1 packet dry vanilla pudding mix 3/4 cup milk 1/2 tsp nutmeg mix well untl all ingredients are well blended warm on low-med heat Drizzle over top....delicious! Great recipe!!"
"0","5","These are so good, i used sprite instead of mountain dew because i didn't have any, and the were fantastic. These are even better the next day, I also cut the butter in half. Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","Amazing taste! My husband and I loved them! They were even good first thing the next morning as a quick breakfast left over from dessert the night before!"
"0","4","Incredible! I, too, was skeptical about pouring Mountain Dew over these. Aside from the dietary concerns it raised (which I thankfully chose to ignore), I thought it would be way too runny, and would wash off all the sugar/butter goodness I had just poured over it. Neither of these was the case. The dumplings came out beautifully golden brown with a thick syrup to serve over them. Definitely needs a vanilla ice cream accompaniment. My only suggestion (like everyone else): cut down on the sugar! They were overpoweringly sweet. I would say 3/4-1 cup of sugar total (3/4ths white, 1/4th brown) would offset the tartness of the Granny Smiths nicely. Yum! Thanks, docswife!"
"0","5","I was skeptical about pouring Mt. Dew on a dessert recipe before baking. Don't be skeptical, just try it! You will be glad you did. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup organic white sugar. This was AMAZING with a bit of vanilla ice cream on top. I had two of them for dessert last night, wow what a treat this is."
"0","5","I made a couple of small changes. I only used 1 cup of sugar, and I forgot to add the soda at all. Still, this recipe was amazing. We found it to be just right - not too sweet, and full of delicious flavor. I will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","Delicious! Best apple dumplings I've ever tasted and so easy. I only used 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I also used Sprite since that's what I had and used low-fat crescents. Will definitely make again and good dish for company since it makes individual servings."
"0","5","Wow! These are really good! Very easy and delicious!"
"0","5","Excellent. I 1/2ed the recipe and used Diet mountain dew and 1/4c brown sugar, 1/4 splenda, and 1/4 c white sugar. Also added the tsp vanilla like some other users suggested."
"0","5","love it love it love it - did not change a thing"
"0","5","Mmmmm...."
"0","5","Simple enough for my 5 year old and I to make together, and yummy too! Thank you!"
"0","5","I was a little skeptical with all that suger and a can of soda. OH MY GOD!!! was I wrong, these are great.."
"0","5","They were perfect alone but add vanilla ice cream and wow!!!"
"0","5","OMG, you're not kidding. These are to die for. Calories-schmalories, if you're looking for a comfort food this is it. I used a cup of sugar, but kept everything else the same. Next time, I'll do half white and half brown sugar. I used mountain dew, as it is what I had on hand, and baked for just 35 minutes until they were a dark golden brown. YUMMY. Thank you to docswife. I wasn't an apple-pie-type-desset fan, until now."
"0","5","Amazing! These were absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I tried the half white sugar and one fourth brown and it turned out great! I will definitely be making these again soon."
"0","3","I found that the recipe amount of butter and sugar to be way too much. I suggest using about half as much. Also, I baked mine for about 45 minutes to make them extra golden brown. Otherwise, a nice tasty treat."
"0","5","Great trade off! Very easy recipe for the spectacular results. Everyone I served them to loved them! Tasted like apple pie!"
"0","5","We just moved into a new house, and so I've been trying to give my family some good filling meals without having to unpack every dish in the kitchen (the cabinets are about to be painted). This was PERFECT, so easy and very cheap! There's only three of us, and two small granny smith apples and one can of 'big and flaky' crescent rolls yielded six big dumplings. I eyeballed the sugar and cinnamon, but I did use half white and half brown sugar like the other reviews suggested. I was skeptical about the mountain dew, but this tasted just like a real country apple cobbler. It was just the pick me up my family needed after moving in!!!"
"0","5","this is the best dessert i have ever made. so easy ... my in-laws were impressed and the kids thought it was great! i used 1/2 can soda and 1/2 c + 2 Tbs butter...perfect amount of goo on the bottom but not really 'liquid'"
"0","4","My granddaughter is learning to cook (she's 11) and thought this would be something she could do. We prepared with 3/4 cup of butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar. She rolled the apples in cinnamon sugar before wrapping in low fat crescent rolls. I was skeptical of the MD but it seemed to work fine. They were crisp and tasty. My only problem was after eating one about 10 minutes later I could still taste the MD in my mouth. I will make this again and try ginger ale or maybe Sprite."
"0","5","Followed other reviews and made 1/2 the sauce and used half and can of Diet MD, pouring just around the edges. This was better that homemade apple pie! My husband actually told me to give most of it away as he would probably eat it all!!!!!! This is a keeper!"
"0","5","It is the simplicity that makes this recipe awesome. I dont like Mountain Dew but I couldnt tell that it was there. If you dont like buttery flavor this recipe is not for you. It is perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some salted pecans on top!"
"0","5","Easy and very tasty. I cut the recipe in half because there were just two of us but wished that I hadn't!!! Used the full amount of cinnamon. The store didn't have crescent rolls so I used the dinner rolls which was a long strip of dough coiled up. I uncoiled and then wrapped the piece of apple like a snail from end to end ...and pinched each end. Fabulous! My husband is my toughest critic....he loved it!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I had to use sprite. There is a lot of liquid left when done cooking."
"0","5","absolutly AMAZING!!! This stuff taste like something you would get from the Cracker Barel soooooo good!"
"0","5","this was AWESOME!!! i was skeptical with the Mt. Dew, but YUM-0!!"
"0","5","This is sooo good. 5 star worthy! I cut the recipe in half; used low fat crescent rolls, diet Mt. Dew and followed the suggestion of another rater to use 1/2c. white sugar and 1/4c. brown sugar. I loved the crusty tops and the soft apple inside."
"0","5","Its all true. I couldn't believe something with crescent rolls and mountain dew could be that great...but it is! Don't waste it on the little kids though - they just want the ice cream."
"0","5","I has some overly ripe golden delicious apples in my fruit bowl and some flat Mountain Dew in my fridge so this recipe was perfect. Easy to make, smells delicious while it's cooking and tastes fantastic. Excellent with or without vanilla ice cream. I will be making this again soon!"
"0","5","SOOOO Delicious!!! Entire family raved."
"0","5","Amazing flavor! These disappear FAST!"
"0","5","Very simple and easy to make. I have taken this to several pot luck dinners this year and each time, everyone loves it. I've been asked more the recipe more times than I can count. I freeze sliced apples to use all year long and these work perfectly in this dish. I just unthaw the apples and place several slices in the rolls. This is a must try recipe."
"0","5","Fantastic and super easy. Everyone asked for the recipe and my husband brought home more crescent rolls and apples to make more the next day."
"0","5","I have made this a couple of times now and it is so easy and delicious! I do cut down on the sugar and have used diet soda once and it is still wonderful. Favorite apple to use is golden delicious. It's awsome with ice cream even though my hubby eats it plain and still loves it."
"0","5","I tried these for the first time just to see how it would go. I tested it on my mom and several others. They love them and is all they want me to make! These are wonderful and everybody loves them!"
"0","4","Totally incredible. I halved it. Addictive, really good."
"0","5","This was so easy and really delicious. My 4 year old and I had a great time making them."
"0","5","These were so great and easy to make. I took them out of the 'juice' just before they were finished and finished baking them on a cookie sheet so that they wouldn't be to so soggy. These will definitely be made again."
"0","5","We loved this...so easy to make! Yummy! :-)"
"0","4","Very good. Tried once as written; since then we've cut back the butter (by half) and sugar (to one cup) - it was too - oily I guess - for our tastes with the full cup of butter. Must be my northern upbringing, lol."
"0","5","Thanks god for Mountain dew, But I did add tsp. of vanilla a nd 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, And sliced some apples on top. Boy was I in heaven with some ice cream."
"0","5","Who knew Mountain Dew would taste so good in a dessert!  I made this for a group of friends over the weekend and everyone cleaned their plates! I followed the recipe exactly, with the only minor exception being that I poured the Mountain Dew in first AROUND the dumplings and then poured the butter/cinnamon sugar on top (as suggested by another reviewer). Perfect results!  This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing =)"
"0","5","I have made this a few times and it is absolutely fabulous!!"
"0","5","Yummy, easy dessert! Great served with whipped cream."
"0","5","These were so good I am left craving more."
"0","5","This was yummy! I was a little skeptical when there seemed to be alot of liquid but the baking takes care of some of it and the rest will thicken after it cools.  I cut the sugar back some and left 1/4 of mt dew in the can. I think I could have used all of it but the amount of liquid at first really scared me.  Will make again but I bet it would taste even better with homemade crescents. Ofcourse I'll be trying it with a recipe from here. :)"
"0","5","THIS RECIPE IS SO EASY AND SO GOOD. I VE MADE THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND IT IS A HIT EVERY TIME.. NO CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE TO THIS RECIPE IT IS PERFECT!!! IF U HAVENT TRIED THIS YET U NEED TO.."
"0","5","Very easy and nummy. I already had the pre-sliced apples...didn't have Mt. Dew so used 7up. Cut recipe in half but we could have easily ate more!  Good recipe for the kids to make to help out!"
"0","5","I have made another recipe or two of apple dumplings from this site - while Grandma's is GREAT, making your own crust and peeling sooooo many apples and have larger than life dumplings isn't worth all the trouble when compared to this deliciously easy apple dumpling. I have halved the recipe quite easily and I have friends that request this dessert when they stop over (sometimes unexpected) so I just keep the ingredients on hand. Always impressive and everyone raves about this dessert. I have used Sprite, 7-up and Mountain Dew (whatever is in the house) and it always comes out great (without too much difference in taste)."
"0","5","This was FABULOUS! I can't believe how easy it was and it tasted like it took hours to make! Everyone at our New Year's party loved it! Its definitely going in my recipe box:)"
"0","5","This is a really yummy dessert for cold nights or holidays. I did make some changes. I didn't have enough butter so I used 1 stick of butter and 1 of margarine. I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cups and used smaller apples. I think the butter/margarine and sugar changes cut down on the richness of the original recipe. I was surprised how simple this was to make. It tasted like apple pie!"
"0","5","I was also surprised how good this was even after reading all the positive ratings. I did cut the sugar some according to the reviews; but this was delicious!! So versatile, too. Great anywhere from breakfast to a dessert with a scoop of ice cream. My 2nd batch is now in the oven. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","This is a fantastic recipe - I replaced half the sugar with Splenda, and used I Can't Believe it's not Butter instead of real butter. I will be making this regularly - it was a huge hit!!!"
"0","5","These are delicious. I halved the recipe and it was just enough for my family. I think next time I might try reducing the amt of Mt. Dew since the sauce was pretty running in the end. Will certainly keep on my favorite list."
"0","5","So easy to make that even my sister can make scrumptous apple dumplings! My sister could burn water. LOL Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","I love these apple dumplings...can't get enough of them!!"
"0","5","These are so good! I halved the recipe and used fresh pears instead of apples. My husband said it was one of the best desserts he's ever had. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","4","A little too sweet, but really tasty. A little one will satisfy the sweet tooth. Very good for a quick dessert!"
"0","5","IT CAME OUT PERFECT AND TASTES WONDERFUL. I HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY IT WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM ON TOP WHILE THE DUMPLINGS ARE STILL WARM. THIS EQUALS SIN IN A BOWL. YUMMY!"
"0","5","Talk about melt in your mouth!!! And it's very easy to make. I plan on trying a few variations with this recipe. Wish me luck."
"0","4","Very sugary but still very good"
"0","5","I brought these to Bible study and everyone loved them. They're nowhere near healthy, but they were a hit."
"0","5","YUM! I followed some previous suggestions ansd used 1 c splenda, 1 T brown sugar and diet soda. I topped it with light ice cream...what a hit! Everyone loved it, even my father who HATES anything diet."
"0","5","I've made this about 12 times since Christmas, the 1st time I tried it. Every single time I get RAVES over it. Make sure you sort of stir the liquid around once or twice while it's cooking. It helps the 'sauce' to be thicker. Also, it's just not the same without vanilla ice cream served with it. YUMMY!!!!!!"
"0","5","Delicious!!!! Many Raves everytime I make them."
"0","5","This is the Best, the easiest, most delicious!"
"0","4","I'm just learning my way around the kitchen and wanted to find an easy dessert recipe. This was just perfect. I wasn't certain what kind of flavor the Mountain Dew would add, but it came out great anyway. I plan to make the recipe more personalized. I now have an easy dish to bring to the company pot luck!"
"0","4","I have made this numerous times for my son by request but we all enjoy this recipe."
"0","5","my family could not get enough of this dish."
"0","5","I've made this several times and it is fantastic! I usually halve the recipe, but still use 2 apples (quartered). I thought the Mountain Dew would make the dumplings soggy, but the sauce thickens. These are great warm with ice cream---like an apple butterscotch sundae!"
"0","5","This is a big A+!!! I served this to company and they all went crazy over it! I made a regular one like the recipe and I made another one for diabetics, using Splenda in place of the sugar and diet Mt. Dew. It turned out pretty good too- not as rich, but still good.I will be emabarrassed to give out the recipe because it is so easy!"
