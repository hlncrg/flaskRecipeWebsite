"1333","5","WOW!  I made this two times - once exactly according to recipe, and second with a few alterations.  The recipe version was fantastic, and I did not think it was too sweet. It was very rich, and I thought there was a strong cool whip flavor, and not enough chocolate. Nonetheless, it was delicious and everyone agreed.  The second time I followed some suggestions here, and the dessert won me first place in a contest this weekend! I mixed the pudding and water, and in a separate bowl whipped 1/2 pint heavy cream and 3 tbsp sugar, then folded in the cream with the pudding/water. I also did use the french vanilla cool whip in place of the plain (12 oz). So, I layered brownies, caramel, heath toffee bits, chocolate whipped cream, and french vanilla cool whip. Repeat!  It was PHENOMENAL. I had so many requests for the recipe, and I saw numerous people going back for 2nds and 3rds. It was a major hit, and will be a staple dessert dish for me!  Thank you!!"
"516","5","This review is a little late but this recipe is EXCELLENT! I made it first for a fake thanksgiving a week early with family that was going out of town, it was very good, but I don't like whipped topping and I found it had entirely too much of that. So i made it again for Thanksgiving the next week and it was soooo amazing! But I made a few adjustments... in the brownie layer I addred about half a bottle of caramel topping (as you would use on ice cream) in the brownie pan before it went into the oven. (really good...) then in the pudding layer, instead of folding in the whipped topping, i bought half a pint of heavy whipping cream and whipped that for about 10 minutes myself and then folded that into the pudding. It made such an incredible difference. The pudding tasted so mych richer, like custard, instead of fluffy like whipped topping. I also added bailey's in the pudding and cut strawberries, chocolate chunks - per my husband's request, and toffee bits, which made it look so pretty. But you can add pretty much anything you want and it still tastes EXCELLENT! EVERYONE who tried it loved it and my mother-in-law asked for the recipe, along with everyone else. Always nice to confirm that her son didn't make a mistake marrying me:-) YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS DESSERT, YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"352","5","This is now known among our friends as 'The Dessert'. Before every party, I'm asked if I'm bringing 'The Dessert'. It is so good! I use the brownie mixes that have some sort of chunk in them (ie. triple chocolate chunk brownies, chocolate peanut butter cup). I also whip up one cup of heavy whipping cream and add that to the condensed milk/water/pudding mix instead of using cool whip. I think this helps to make sure the sweetness isn't overdone. And for the cool whip layer, I use French Vanilla flavor instead of plain, because it gives the whole dish more flavor. You have GOT to try this, and try it my way because like I said, it's getting quite a cult following!"
"314","2","I had great expectations for this recipe which has such high reviews. I wasn't impressed with the 'synthetic' taste of instant pudding and cool whip. It was too sweet and had a syrupy, filmy mouthfeel. I think it would be worthwhile to use cooked pudding, cooled of course, and real whipped cream which can be prepared simply by beating 1 cup of cream with 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla."
"164","5","This is an easy, delicious, and pretty dessert. If you opt to use a trifle bowl as opposed to a regular glass bowl, you might want to third the brownies and pudding mix instead of half them for the layers. Trifle bowls are tall, and you will run out of brownies for more than two layers. Also, I topped this with mini chocolate chips instead of shaved chocolate. A lot easier."
"154","4","This was an excellent and attractive dessert! I used fudgy brownie mix (be sure not to use the mix you pour the chocolate syrup in yourself or the brownies will be too gooey for the trifle). I gave it four stars because I didn't use the 8oz frozen whipped topping in the pudding mixture. As other reviews advised, I whipped 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream and folded that in the pudding mixture instead. I think it's better this way to avoid the dessert being TOO SWEET! This is a great recipe, and I will definitely make again...but I'll be making it my way."
"97","5","So tasty and so easy to make! I brought this to a neighborhood holiday party and everyone loved it.  I refrigerated the pudding after I mixed it with the water, condensed milk and cool whip. It thickened it up and made it easy to spread into a nice layer. (Also made for yummy clean-up with a spoon for my 5 year old!) And instead of cutting the brownies into 1 inch squares, I wound up crumbling them with my hands to provide smaller bite-size pieces. I also garnished the top with fresh raspberries. It was delicious!  I wonder how it would be if you substituted some Bailey's for the water? ;) I'll bet strong coffee would also be good in place of the water. I think I'll try some variations in the future."
"82","5","I needed a quick, easy dessert that would please a large group of people, each with their own picky tastes. Who wouldn't love this? They all did. :) This is a safe and pretty dessert. Pleases just about everybody, and is fool proof to make. I topped this with Heath Bars."
"75","5","Very good dessert. Light and easy to prepare. The next time I will try choclate cake instead of brownie mix. I think I will like the texture of the cake part better. My family loved it."
"71","5","This was absolutely delicious! I substituted bailey's irish cream liquer for 1/4 cup of the water. Yum!!!"
"26","5","WOW!!! I made this recipe with using some recommendations from other reviewers. Used heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip in pudding mixture and added toffee pieces on top of brownie layer. topped with pieces of crumbled brownie. presented so well and was so rich and tasty! everyone loved it at memorial day party i brought it too!!! (UPDATE: for easier cutting of the brownies, i inverted brownies out of pan onto cookie sheet after about five minutes out of oven and cut into one inch squares with a pizza cutter! so much easier)"
"25","5","I have been making a version of this for YEARS, and every time there is a get-together, I am asked to bring this. If you make the mousse first, and let set up in the fridge for a few hours or overnight, it whips up and becomes a lot creamier. Then I layer it with brownies, whipped cream, a jar of Mrs. Richardson's caramel topping, and chopped pecans. You end up with a turtle trifle that is to DIE for!"
"24","5","Yum. Made this for a family BBQ dessert and it was fabulous. Will definately be making again, especially when I need to impress. It turned out EXACTLY like the picture...thanks a bunch."
"23","5","I have made this dessert at lease 5 times and it still is one of our favorites!! I follow the recipe exactley as stated. The only thing I change is the decoration on the top (according to the holiday/event) Make & enjoy!!"
"20","5","First of all, the Ingredient changes I made are as follows: I bought Smucker's Caramel Sundae Syrup, Heath Toffee Bits, heavy whipping cream, and I also used the French Vanilla Cool Whip in place of the plain (12 oz), and deleted the 8oz Cool Whip. Everything else was the same. I baked a regular brownie package in a 7x11 dish to make the brow nies come out thinner for layering. Then in a separate bowl I whipped 1 cup of heavy cream until stiff peaks. I mixed the pudding, water, and condensed milk thoroughly in another bowl then folded in the cream with the pudding/water mix. In a triffle bowl I layered brownies (just cut & crumbled to make them fit), caramel, chocolate whipped cream, french vanilla cool whip, and then Heath toffee bits; Repeat! This was a MAJOR hit with everyone...especially the kids!! I'm adding this one to the recipe box...EASY & DELISH!"
"18","5","It was a very good recipe. Very easy just plan 9 hrs before you serve it. All said though ,It was very VERY sweet. So sweet that half was definitely left on the plate from even my most chocolate chocolate lovers. The Espresso of desserts Id say! next time I will make real thin brownie layers. (mine were very thick and had walnuts)I might even try to make more of a mousse instead of the pudding and condensed milk so the sweet will be more balanced. We didnt have coffee with it,but every one did mention that 'its a coffee desert'. We made it for a birthday cake and it was a little much but it is a very unique recipe and if your having a very special occasion at night drinking coffee Id say it would be a real winner. Remember only small portions a little goes a long way. Im talking no more than a 3 x 4 inch pile or slice or what ever you want to call it. Thanks for the recipe its opened up a new avenue in desserts"
"16","3","I made this for my mom's birthday. She is the ultimate chocoholic and has an almost insatiable sweet tooth. As I usually do when I make a recipe here, I asked the family how they would rate this...with a mouthful of trifle, my mom mumbled '15!' and my kids agreed. So why did I only give it 3 stars? Because what I ended up with was quite different from the recipe thanks to the comments here. First, I used real whipping cream instead of cool whip. I used only 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk plus 1-2/3 cups milk to prepare the pudding and folded in UNSWEETENED whipped cream. For the rest of the cream, I lightly sweetened it and added a generous amount of vanilla. I layered the trifle as directed except that I added a layer of crushed oreo cookie crumbs between the first mousse/cream layer. It was RICH but not overpoweringly sweet and sickly. I left the remaining trifle with my mom and she's a happy camper."
"14","1","It was MUCH too sweet for our taste. I think making your own whipped cream and leaving out the sweetended condensed milk would make a big difference."
"14","5","When I made this recipe, i used fat free brownie mix, fat free cool whip, fat free & sugar free pudding and low fat condensed milk and it was FANTASTIC! you'd never know it was lo-fat."
"13","5","I've made this a few times and it is def a crowd pleaser. Of course I change it around each time and the one that got the most reviews is- I use homemade brownie layer, Hershey's chocolate mouse layer (recipe from this sight), and last fresh whipped cream (2cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip in chilled bowl with chilled wisk or paddles) and WOW talk about rich, sweet and delicious! You really have to be a chocolate lover for this. I've made with the pudding layer and cool whip and it is still very very tasty. But nothing beats fresh whipped cream. Next time I'll toss in cherries or strawberries for a fruity taste. Thanks"
"12","5","For Halloween, I used some finely crushed Oreo cookies on top to look like dirt, some Milano cookies for headstones, and cut-out sugar cookies dipped in white chocolate for ghosts. I finished it off with a brown/purple/orange mixture of sprinkles. It was a big hit! I like to call this 'Chocolate Graveyard Trifle.' =)"
"12","5","Yummy, good for a quick chocolate fix.....I chilled mine while we ate dinner, it didnt need to chill for 8 hours."
"11","5","This was so yummy! I can see why awards were won on this recipe. I followed the suggestions of Roxanne323 and did the following.   1. Prepare brownie mix according to package directions and cool completely. Cut into 1 inch squares. 2. In a large bowl, combine pudding mix and water, and in a separate bowl whipped 1/2 pint heavy cream and 3 tbsp sugar, then fold in the 8 oz container frozen whipped topping with the pudding/water. Because I the french vanilla cool whip was discontinued, I found another recipe for Vanilla Chantilly Cream. Whip on high in a mixer 4 c of heavy whipping cream, 4 tbsps sugar, 2 tsps vanilla until soft peaks form.  3. In a large bowl or glass serving dish, layer brownies, caramel, heath toffee bits, chocolate whipped cream, and french vanilla cool whip. Repeat. Then on top sprinkled a few more toffee bits. Yum was this good."
"10","5","I've made this a few times; each time I'm the hit of the party! Ha! Brownies must be cold or it gets a little soupy, learned that the hard way. Yum!"
"10","5","This was DELICIOUS! I added caramel in the layering to satisfy ALL of my cravings Very easy and very yummy!"
"9","4","Really yummy! I made a couple substitutions. I actually used all whipped cream since I couldnt find the whipped topping with any bad stuff in it. I didnt use that much whip cream. I also didnt have time to make it with brownie so I used chocolate pound cake. I topped it with strawberries. It was delicious-very decadent though!"
"9","5","I make this recipe all the time to take to gatherings, with a few changes. After the brownies have baked, I drizzle them with apox. 1/4 cup kahlua, and instead of chocolate on top, I sprinkle with chopped toffee candy bars like skor or heath."
"9","5","This dessert is always requested at our family get togethers. I always make it with chocolate cake. It tastes better if you make it a day before, which makes it so convenient. I make mine with skor or heath bars (which I unwrap and place in a ziplock and freeze for 20 min, to make chopping them up easy). You can't go wrong with this dessert, and it is a good basic to add variations according to your family and friends likings. ***I recently made this again with the following variation: Chocolate Creme de Menthe Trifle. Instead of Heath Bars, I bought a bag of chopped Andes (found in baking aisle) and put them over the whipped cream layers. Then I bought a box of Andes and put the whole pieces of Andes in a arrangement on top (so the guests would know what type of trifle it was). It was delicious! For Christmas I will be making a Peppermint one. There are so many options!"
"9","4","This is a real attention-getter! I tried using real whipping cream for the layers, but I should have used two instead of only one. It didn't have the height that cool whip provides. I found it interesting that the pudding layer changed consistency and became whipped rather than blah when refrigerated for awhile. Next time I will try putting fruit between the layers...I bet it will be fabulous!"
"9","5","This was wonderful and gone w/i minutes but I found it to be a little too sweet. I may try a previous reviewer's suggestion and use heavy cream rather than Cool Whip."
"9","5","Talk about a choholic's dream! Most of my chocolate lovers couldn't get enough. Some of my guests who aren't into chocolate thought it was a bit sweet and too rich. I even added my favorite raspberry sauce from this site between the layers. I felt that the tartness would cut the sweetness of the chocolate. Also I cut the whipped cream in half. Thanks for sharing, Wayne. This is a keeper!"
"9","4","This is a easy & delicious recipe. BUT it's even better (to us) if you (1)layer brownies, (2)chocolate pudding mix (made according to pkg directions), (3) then Heath toffee bits, (4) then Cool Whip, and repeat! Top with shaved chocolate! YUMMY!!"
"8","4","I made a few alterations as I read all the reviews and chose to do it the way the very first review appears after the recipe. I whipped up a batch of heavy whip cream and mixed it with the chocolate pudding, which by the way 1/2 cup of water to pudding makes it waaayy too sticky and hard to mix, so the next batch I added 1 whole cup of milk. Anyway, I did it like this: brownie, caramel, choc pudding/cream, cool whip, choc pudding/cream, then layered whip cream on top. I didn't continue with the cool whip cause to me cool whips nasty and I just couldn't bring myself to top it off with it so real whip cream I did. It tasted really good and I am glad the way it turned out. Next time and there will be a next time, I am going to use chocolate mousse, (theres a great recipe on allrecipes, amazing, its my go to for mousse always!) and white chocolate mousse, and keep the whip cream and the caramel."
"8","5","I have been making this recipe for years. It is always a crowd pleaser. Definately best made the night before. I also have substituted Irish Cream and pepermint liquour for water when taking to adult only affairs."
"8","5","I made this for book club and my family. I got rave reviews! I used a homemade brownie recipe which people said made a difference. I also mixed the pudding with 1/2 c. water, condensed milk (fat free), and then 1/2 c. milk. It still tasted great without as much sugar. Whipped topping was also fat free. Very rich and delicious!"
"8","4","leave out the condensed milk and add some skor bits in between the layers and sprinkled over the top. add some kahlua liquor into the whipped topping for an extra kick."
"7","1","I made this to take to a party. Before I took it, I decided to taste it and was glad I did! This is way too sweet... and I love chocolate . I would be embarassed to have taken this to a party and had people eat it because it didn't taste good at all. I would suggest to leave out the brownies and replace with pound cake."
"7","5","Such a fun recipe to assemble & so delish! Few tips: Prepare at least 24 hours before serving. 48 hours combined the flavors as if it was a devine dessert from the finest restaurant. Since it is a rich dessert you will find it will stretch further than the 12 servings. Because of ease and awesome flavors you won't want to pass this up at your next gathering. (Used bagged toffee bits instead of chocolate curls)"
"7","4","VERY GOOD WITH SOME CHANGES.I OMITTED THE CONDENSED MILK AND COOL WHIP FELT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SWEET. MADE THE CHOCOLATE PUDDING ACCORDING TO THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS WITH REGULAR MILK. WHIPPED SOME HEAVY CREAM WITH A LITTLE POWDER SUGAR USED THAT INSTAED OF THE COOL WHIP . ALSO DRIZZELED CHOCOLATE SYRUP IN BETWEEN THE LAYERS. THIS WAS REALLY GOOD WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SWEETNESS"
"7","5","Delicious! This was an instant hit. Everyone wants the recipe."
"7","5","I made this for a New Year's Eve party and every last bit was eaten! We are chocoholics here and could not get enough. I did make adjustments. I followed reviewer's [Christina] tip and mixed up heavy whipped cream (about 3 minutes in my Kenmore mixer) and added that to the pudding mix. It tasted sooo good that I doubled the pudding. The next time I make it, I will add less whipped topping. It was too much for us....and probably make an additional batch of chocolate pudding since that was to die for. Thanks for the recipe."
"7","5","I prepared this trifle to take to my parent's house on Christmas. Everyone in my family couldn't believe how gorgeous it was! And the taste...something that tastes this good should be illegal!! Everyone was commenting on how delicious it was and most of it was gone in just a few minutes! I will definitely be making this again!!"
"7","5","Awesome dessert! I was in a hurry and put Heath Butter Brickles bits in the center and on top (instead of shaved chocolate)and it was terrific."
"7","5","This is an excellent chocolate recipe! I added a layer of strawberry cool-whip in the middle and 'kicked-it-up' a notch. It was a refreshing addition to the chocolate."
"6","5","Added butterscotch sundae topping and toffee bits over the brownie layer. Used whipping cream instead of whipped topping, and for pudding layer added a cup of milk instead of half cup of water. So good!!"
"6","5","Beat 1/2 c whipping cream till soft peaks formed and folded that into the chocolate pudding instead of cool whip, thanks to the advice of many other reviewers. Also drizzled a little caramel ice cream topping in between chocolate mousse layer and cool whip layer. I thought everyone at the party that I took this to were going to lick their bowls! Took the tiny bit that was left over to a couple of the girls at work and their eyes rolled back in their heads at the first bite. I used a fudgy brownie mix with chocolate chunks in it. The combination of that, the amazing chocolate mousse, caramel, and cool whip were enough. I think any other additions of candy bars, toffee, etc. would have been too many flavors competing with each other. I did garnish the top with chocolate curls and received many compliments about how pretty this was. This is my new go to dessert for anything to which I have to bring a dish and want to impress. Made the brownies and put the mixer bowl and beaters for the cream in freezer the night before, threw this together in about 20 minutes the next morning."
"6","4","I make this (I call it Brownie trifle). I don't use the sweetened condensed milk at all just mix in some cream or cool whip with the pudding.Sometimes I add strawberries over the brownies, drizzle them with Hershey's syrup, then layer on the pudding etc.. OR mix some strong coffee into the pudding and drizzle brownies with either chocolate or caramel syrup.....YUM!!!!!!!!"
"6","5","I made this last year for a Progressive Dinner Party. It was the first dish that everyone dug into. It was delicious! Even better the next day."
"6","5","Made this recipe with Thanksgiving dinner and I must say this was the most delicious dessert I've ever made! My boyfriend says it's perfectly balanced, sweet but not too sweet. You can't go wrong making this for your next party. I made substitutions as follows. Instead of the 8 oz cool whip mixed into the chocolate pudding mixture I used a 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream that I whipped up with a beater until it got fluffy. I added pecan bits and heath toffee bits ontop of the cool whip layer. I also added a light drizzle of caramel ice cream topping ontop of the bottom brownie layer. I think the brownies you select make a big difference in flavor. I used one that had big chunks of chocolate and baked up really fudgy. I decorated it with extra pecan bits, rasberries and blackberries and Ghiradellis milk chocolate/dark chocolate bar shavings. Would even taste great with some sliced bananas. Serve with coffee, espresso or a latte to top it off with the perfect compliment. I will be making this many times more in the future and my man will love me more for it. :)"
"6","4","It's good but I definately think that you should use homeade whipped cream with the pudding (I just used heavy cream with no sugar) I also added frozen raspberries over the brownie mix so when they dethawed they added a really rich taste to the dish. The tartness of the raspberries helped with the richness of the dish."
"6","5","UPDATE: I have whipped up this yummy trifle five times since Thanksgiving. Such a simple dessert that has people begging me for this recipe. I plan on making it again this weekend...with Andes mints!!!Incredible! I brought this dessert to a party and it was gone in a flash! Everyone was in heaven eating the chocolate trifle. I should have made two trifles!!! I did change two things (as suggested by other reviewers) - used french vanilla cool whip and whipped 1/2 pint of heavy cream."
"6","5","After reading the reviews of others, I made the following changes. I used a cup of whipping cream (whipped) instead of the frozen whipped topping in the pudding mixure and also added some Bailey's to the pudding mixture. Instead of plain whipped topping, I substituted french vanilla whipped topping. I also added strawberries and raspberry sauce over the brownie layers. I know I changed it quite a bit, but when I took it to my pot-luck dinner, it disappeared fast!"
"6","5","This trifle is wonderful! It's quick and easy and the presentation is beautiful! I have made differnt variations of this recipe, and have found triple chocolate cake mix as a substitute for the brownies to be the best. I also enjoyed chocolate cake with vanilla pudding and bananas. The possibilities are endless. I'm thinking of experimenting with a pumpkin version of this recipe. All my family really enjoyed it, and is always eaten quite quickly! Overall, a wonderful dessert fit for entertaining!"
"6","5","I made this for my family on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. It actually caused fights between the adults and children over who got to lick the bowl. I've been asked to make it for every holiday to come now. As a little change to add some color and flavor I added a layer of fresh strawberries and bananas which worked perfectly."
"6","5","This was a easy and simple wonderful delight. I have made this several times for my cheerleaders, co-workers, and my husband's co-workers. The review is always the same 'that really taste good'. Tip: Make sure you brownie are soft and chewy. OO.. it's so good."
"6","2","Seems as though am in the minority with this dessert. I found the trifle to be too sweet, with overpowering whip cream, as well time consuming. I made home baked brownies, should have stopped there."
"6","5","This is one recipe that I consistently use! I usually sprinkle chocolate chips over the whipped topping layers instead of shaving chocolate on top. Recently, I made this and added 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter to the pudding/water/condensed milk mix and then using 48 small (or 24 large) coarsely chopped peanut butter cups sprinkled over the whipped topping layers. Very rich but extra yummy!"
"6","5","Looked beautiful, tasted absolutely delicious. I used my own homemade brownies, and used Mr. Goodbar on top of each of the whipped cream layers. I took this to a large get-together, and people were lining up for it while they were still eating their food. Not a spoonful left...I saw that someone actually scraped the trifle glass with a spoon to get whatever scraps were left. :)"
"6","5","I made a slight adjustment to this recipe. I though the brownies would be a little too dense, so I used Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Cake (also on this site) instead. While the cake turned out more dense than I anticipated, it was fabulous. Additionally, I used fresh whipped cream instead of cool-whip and felt this helped this recipe not be a 'sugar-bomb'. It went over swimmingly at my party and I'll definately make it again. UPDATE: This has officially become a 'forever' recipe. Everytime I've made it, I gotten nothing but rave reviews and people begging me to make it again."
"6","5","This is very easy to make and even easier to eat. I add a can of cherry or strawberry pie filling to middle layer. Everytime I make it it goes FAST!"
"5","5","I have made this recipe for 4 parties and am always asked for the recipe."
"5","5","I got rave reviews at 2 different parties."
"5","5","OH MY GOODNESS! This was so GOOD! I did use heavy cream as advised by the other reviewers. However, I used the whole pint and added some hershey's syrup. That in and of itself was absolute killer - I licked the bowl and the beaters!!! I made it for Christmas. I ended up having to hide what was left. My finicky husband has already requested it for our family reunion in August."
"5","2","I was looking forward to making this for Christmas, but I just found it to be waaaay too sweet. The sweetened condensed milk in the pudding mix was unpleasant."
"5","4","Thank you!- this was great, but I used cinnamon nutmeg cupcakes instead of the brownie mix. Everyone liked it very much."
"5","5","This was a huge hit at my housewarming party. I used fat-free everything (the pudding, sweetened-condensed milk, 'No-Pudge' brand brownies, and homemade whipped cream from FF half & half and a little sugar and vanilla - so much better than gross Cool Whip). Then since I saved so many calories that way I felt no guilt in swapping out the water with Kahlua! It's all about balance, right? This turned out SO GOOD! :)"
"5","5","I am now famous for this recipe. I made it for my friends 10 year anniversary party...& it is now requested at all my parties. the only thing that did diffrently was I added a layer of fresh strawberries between the chocolate & whip topping. Delish!!!!"
"5","5","Very rich and sweet so a small serving is all most can really handle. I topped the brownies in the second layer with some dulce de leche sauce which made it even sweeter. Not a good idea and I won't do that next time. I would love to try this with a nice, dark cake mix like devils food instead of the brownies.This would make it more like a trifle. I will also be putting a layer of cherry pie filling in between so it is more like a Black forest version."
"5","5","For all of those who don't like the too sweetness of this recipe, I've been making this for years and I use chocolate cake instead of brownies and chocolate pudding made the regular way with milk. It always gets raves and requests for the recipe. I like using real whipped cream and toffee bits. Yum!"
"5","5","Ok, so I made this a little different. I used turtle brownies, the Ghiradelli ones. Then I used chocolate chips and chocolate syrup and added them to the layers. Instead of using any sweetened condensed milk, I just made the pudding as normal. I ran out of time before our Young Marrieds Christmas Party at Church, so i had to do it quick. Everyone was like, 'WHO MADE THIS?!?' and stole some of it up until the end. I will always be known as the killer dessert maker at our potlucks! LOL."
"5","5","Very Good and oh so rich! I used Fat free ingrediants and you could never tell. Its a real crowd pleaser great for a potluck and easy to make. Taste better if you let it sit in fridge overnight"
"5","5","Used real whipped cream, caramel sauce, and heath bar chunks. This is SO good! Even better 2 days later after the brownie has had a chance to absorb more caramel and cream."
"5","5","I made this recipe and the changes I made were as follows: I added one teas. of almond extract to the water, used whipped cream instead of cool whip in the chocolate pudding mixture and I used french vanilla cool whip instead of plain. I also put a couple of crushed heath bars on top. Next time I'm going to add either bananas or strawberries as an additional layer. Everyone wanted the recipe. YUMMY!"
"5","5","This is a very rich, but delicious recipe. I added Heath bits in between the layers and on top."
"5","5","This trifle was incredible! The pudding mixture was like a mousse and was delicious! My family loved it and because of the presentation (I made it the centerpiece for our family dinner) my husband is now going to let me get the nice trifle bowl that I wanted to purchase originally! Provided, of course, I make this more frequently! :)"
"5","4","Too sweet as is...but is great with changes. I prepared the pudding as the package directs (no condensed milk) then added unsweetened whipping cream and for the whip cream layer, I used very lightly sweetened whipping cream. Added crushed skor bar to the whip cream layers and on top. I always get asked for the recipe on this one....and never any leftovers."
"5","5","I have made this numerous times and it has had rave reviews every time. My son requests it instead of cake for his birthday. I do modify it somewhat, though - I use a turtle brownie mix and add extra caramel topping to the brownie layers. I buy the 'no mess' bottle of caramel ice cream topping and squirt some on top of the brownies after adding it to the bowl. I also use only about 1/4 of a can of the sweetened condensed milk, since I think it is too sweet if you use the whole can. Wonderful recipe, and looks good, too!"
"5","5","I've made this three times and have gotten rave reviews. It's very simple to make, delicious, and looks nice! 5 stars all the way! This is something I think I will always make quite often."
"5","5","This gets points for taste and ease in making it. I added about 3 oz. of cream cheese to the whip cream layer and used heavy whipping cream. It was marvelous. I made it the night before and it held up great. I will make it again."
"5","3","I like this OK. My guests, however, always seem to rave about it, and it's easy to do."
"5","5","I made this for a food contest at work (category = chocolate) and won! As others suggested, I also used heavy whipping cream (beat in my Kitchen Aid mixer for about 5 min.) instead of Cool Whip. When making the pudding, I used 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. milk plus the sweetened, condensed milk, and about a cup of the whipping cream. I added a layer of strawberries in the middle and also a layer of caramel topping towards the top. I put smashed Heath bars and chocolate shavings on top. Next time I will put a layer of smashed Heath within and will try the suggestion of caramel in the brownie pan."
"5","5","I make this in a 13x9 pan with just three layers and cut into squares - it's wonderful!"
"5","5","Oh my goodness!! I made this for Christmas and it was a huge hit. I think if my guests didn't have manners they would have licked the bowl!! It was very easy to make. I followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and only used 16 oz of Cool Whip - that was plenty! Will make again and again!"
"5","5","I made this for a family get together and then took what was left (not much) to a second party. Everyone raved about it at both places!"
"5","5","ABSOLUTELY YUMMY!!! All of my guests loved it! I followed the recipe exactly! It was so happy to have leftovers! I will make again!"
"4","5","Delicious recipe! I did not use the brownie mix instead I made the Absolutely Best Brownies recipe here on AR. Also made my own whipped cream topping and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top of trifle. There were no leftovers :) Thanks Wayne for sharing your recipe!"
"4","5","I made this for Mother's day for my mom and my mother-in-law and they both LOVED it!! I did add a couple things. I added a layer caramel topping on the brownies and topped whole trifle with raspberries very yummy!! :) I also made the brownies gooey instead of cakey!"
"4","5","I made this by making the pudding per the instructions on the box. I left out the water and condensed milk. It was delicious. I topped it with Heath Bar bits found in the baking aisle. I served it at Easter and it was gone in an hour. I'm not a big sweet lover - but I loved this! One other note: I tore the brownies in smaller pieces - easier to eat than a one inch square. Next time I'm going to add a little Bailey's."
"4","4","Though I found this recipe to be a bit too sweet, it was a hit at one of our holiday meals this year. Next time I will use more brownie and overcook it a bit and less cool whip. I topped it with chunks of snickers. At a dinner where the hostess apparently asked everyone to bring dessert, this was the number one choice for everyone."
"4","5","This was fabulous! It was such a big hit, all of it was eaten, which was surprising judging how decadent it was. First suggestion: Add rosewater to your whipped cream. You can't actually 'taste' the rosewater, but you can definitely smell it...and taste is 90% smell. It is traditional to add rosewater to the whipping cream in a trifle. Second suggestion: Use real whipping cream (SUPER stiff peaks). The difference is surprising. Cool-whip and real whipping cream is to the savory comparison of 'Miracle whip' versus 'real mayo.' A world of difference there, if you know what I mean."
"4","5","This is a great recipe with additional ideas from others along the way! Another idea thrown into the mix is to soak the brownies in 1 cup of kahlua before layering (for adults of course)...mmmmm"
"4","5","Another great potluck hit in my office! I made it exactly as directed this time for my office but I can't wait to try the suggestions from ROXANNE323 Reviewed on Jun. 10, 2007. There is no doubt it will be a smash as well!"
"4","5","I was lucky enough to find a seasonal box of instant 'Turtle' jello pudding in my pantry! The carmel/pecan flavor in this choc. pudding gave this recipe a nice variation. The only thing I changed was I added skim milk vs. water. A must for chocolate lovers everywhere!!"
"4","5","I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. I am not a big fan of pudding based desserts, but this one was very good. I really think the denseness of the brownies is what sets this dessert off. I think next time I will also add a layer of chopped nuts and perhaps brownies with chunks of chocolate in them. A very pretty, tasty and easy dessert. I plan on making it again soon."
"4","3","I made this trile to serve to guests last night and the end result was just ok - although I did change the recipe based on other reviews. I used cooked pudding and omitted the condensed milk as a result. I also used 'real' whipped cream as opposed to cool whip and ended up folder some of it into the pudding to lighten it a bit. The only other change I made was to sprinkle toffee bits and mini chocolate chips between the layers and on top. The end result was very rick and quite dense (although the whipped cream did lighten it somewhat). I may try again, but will replace the brownies with a less dense chocolate cake mix."
"4","5","Super easy and quite a crowd pleaser!"
"4","5","Made this today for our monthly 'First Sunday Family Dinner', my duty was dessert....And this was a hit! But because I bake for a living, I made a few modifications. I used chocolate fudge cake(instead of brownie) and I topped it off with a nice thick drizzles of caramel and taosted (makes a difference) pecans all over the top. FABULOUS!!! P.S. It didnt take eight hours to set, we ate it after 2hrs."
"4","5","Rave reviews received for this one from all young and old. I substituted oreo cookies for the brownies. Delicious!"
"4","5","I am on weight watchers, so thought I would change this into a healther version. I used 95% fat free Cool Whip, Lite Sweetened Condensed milk, fat free chocolate pudding, and Betty Crocker Low Fat Fudge Brownies and added Skor bits to each layer. This made it not so sweet, it tasted silky with a nice toffee crunch.  = 12 points for 1 Cup serving,  = 6 points for 1/2 Cup serving."
"4","5","We tried this trifle and it turned out perfect. We didn't change the recipe, just added toasted slivered almonds and mini chocolate chips as an additional layer. It turned out perfect. I will upload a picture."
"4","5","This dessert is very rich but delicious! I used real whipped cream instead of whipped topping as I don't really like the taste of Cool Whip. I added Skor toffee bits and used the chocolate chunk brownie mix as recommended by other reviewers. I topped with chocolate shavings but next time I might try rasberries. I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe - it was a devoured by everyone who tried it!"
"4","5","I wanted to use the french vanilla whipped cream as others suggusted, buy my grocer didn't have it. So I whipped my own using one cup heaving whipping cream, 1tbsp sugar, and 1tsp vanilla. My first time making homemade whip. crm. Added it to the pudding mix, used reg. store bought whip crm for the other layer. I drizzled on a little caramel over the brownies, and added crushed toffee chips. YUMMY, huge success at my in-laws for christmas."
"4","3","This recipe sounded so good. I made it for my husband who usually loves my chocolate trifle made with devils good cake, choc pudding and cool whip with crushed Heath bar on top. Well, our whole family agreed that this recipe was WAY too sweet. My kids didn't even want to finish theirs. I think I'll stick to my usual trifle recipe."
"4","5","by far, the best dessert ever! Thank you Wayne!"
"4","4","This is good. Not the best dessert I have ever had but good. Disappears fast. I would love to try a different pudding then chocolate-- maybe a mocha flavored-- or would like to try flavoring with the chocolate like mint to add more flavor."
"4","4","Have made this a couple times now, it was enjoyed each time. I generally use real whipped cream instead of cool whip, and sometimes add strawberries. Endless variations on this recipe."
"4","5","This has to be one of the most sinfully delicious desserts I have ever had! It was SOOOO good, and my guests were just raving about it all night long. The only minor changes I made, I added caramel topping on top of the brownie layers. I used cool whip for the pudding mixture, but then I also whipped a pint of fresh whipping cream and didn't add any sugar to it. That was used instead of cool whip on top of the pudding mixture. I also sprinkled the top with heath bar bits. This was DELICIOUS!!! Thank you for an outstanding recipe!"
"4","5","I used low fat brownies, fat free cool whip and condensed milk. It was great. Pam"
"4","5","Wow. I was very skeptical of this recipe due to the instant jello and the 'very Sweet' reviews. However, let me just say, people @ my dinner party kept asking me where I purchased such a delicacy! It was SCRUMPTIOUS! Following the advice of other reviewers, I made my own whipped topping/cream out of 24 oz. heavy cream + 1/2 c. powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. If you don't want it to be too rich, don't add the sugar and vanilla to the whipped heavy cream that you fold into the jello mixture! This keeps the flavor very light and tasty. Other than doubling the amount of brownies (because who doesn't love good brownies,) I stayed true to the recipe. Overall it was such a hit that I think I'm going to make it for every big event that comes along in the next,.... oh say.... FOREVER!"
"4","2","I have to agree with Paula's review below. The recipe sounded like it had a lot of potential and I was extremely excited to try it, but I also didn't like the feel or taste of the pudding mix. The final product also ended up tasting too dry. I had some a day later with some ice cream and that helped. I think the recipe might be better with cake pieces and real pudding."
"4","5","This was DIVINE. I took a couple suggestions on this. I subbed the 8 oz. of whipped cream for the handmade stuff, whisking heavy cream, 2 Tbsp sugar and a tad of mexican vanilla together. This gave the chocolate pudding wonderful flavor. I also left out about 1/4 cup of the water and used irish cream liquer in its place and sprinkled heath bits over the brownies when I layered everything up. EXCELLENT substitutions if you want more depth to your already decadent dish and very pretty!!"
"4","5","Made this for my sisters first baby shower. Everyone devoured it first thing. I thought it was very good (after licking what was left on the spoon and scraping the empty trifle dish) Very simple recipe just be sure to remember that it needs to sit in the fridge as stated!!!"
"4","1","This was sickeningly sweet. I won't make this again."
"4","5","AMAZING"
"4","5","This is my FAVORITE dessert !! I used a Heath bar broken into pieces and then put toasted almonds on top and is was a HUGE hit at all my parties."
"4","5","This will forever be my chocolate trifle go to..."
"4","5","I made this for a huge meeting at the office. Wow, everyone who tried it loved it. My hubby made me bring home the left overs and we have been eating it and almost gone. It was awesome."
"4","5","One word. Yummy."
"4","5","This was such a hit at my sister's bridal shower and my friend's baby shower! I made some changes - To keep the cake non-dairy/parve - I mixed the instant chocolate pudding powder with 2 cups of soy milk instead of the water and condensed milk. I topped the cake with chopped cookies and peanut chews. This is always a big hit for a crowd!"
"4","5","I have made this recipe over and over for potlucks, reunions, etc over the past 5 years. As written the trifle is wonderful, but very sweet. I cut the sweetness by using homemade whipped cream for the layer mixed with the pudding. I sometimes modify this recipe by adding a 4th layer of fresh fruit such as strawberries or raspberries. My favorite is to add caramel sauce over the brownie layer and toffee chips and pecans over the whipped cream layer for a turtle trifle!"
"4","5","This gets Five Stars for the simplicity and 4 for taste. It was perfect for my family reunion; gobbled down immediately - looks so nice with chocolate shavings on top."
"4","5","I served this on Mother's Day for all the mom's and everyone loved it. It was so easy to make that I think this will be one the recipes I use anytime we have a family gathering. It was a hit! Thanks!"
"4","5","I added strawberries to this and OH BOY! It was fantastic. I don't think I would have liked it as much without the strawberries though. I also used whipping cream....soooo good! This is definitely for chocolate lovers!"
"4","1","This was not good at all. Too much whipped cream and not really chocolaty. My family was very disappointed.  Southern Charm Memphis, TN"
"4","5","Excellent and so easy! Took this to a church event and it was the first thing gone. I used french vanilla cool whip instead of plain, and on the top of each layer drizzled some caramel sauce and sprinkled with Heath bar bits instead of shaving chocolate. Also, I was in a time crunch when I made it, so instead of making my own brownies, I bought a sheet of pre-made Pillsbury chocolate-chunk brownies that I found at Sam's and diced them up -- they were perfect and saved me a ton of time. I couldn't believe how good this was and how extravagant it seemed. I made it the night before and let it sit...although I worried it would get mushy, it was absolutely perfect. People asked me for the recipe after taking just one bite. This is definitely one that I will make again and again!"
"4","5","This is soooo delicious and easy to make. I double the brownie recipe to fill my dish and follow the rest of the recipe exactly. My neighbor calls it the Chocolate Trifecta! I never have any leftovers."
"4","5","Soooo Delicious! My only change was to add 1/2 cup strong ice coffee instead of water to the pudding mixture. It was gobbled up in minutes. Both impressive looking and tasting, how can you go wrong?"
"4","5","This is a really easy, very impressive dessert.  Following other suggestions, I used a pint of whipping cream and 3T of sugar added into the pudding mix, water, and condensed milk mixture, instead of Cool Whip. I also use French Vanilla Cool Whip for the 12 oz. that you layer. My layers were brownie, caramel, pudding, Heath, whipped topping, repeat, then put caramel and Heath on top.  I have made it three times so far. The second time, I was in a hurry, and only refrigerated it about four hours and it wasn't as good. Definitely refrigerate it overnight!"
"4","5","I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was great! I did change some things like most people did. I also used a half pint of whipping cream instead of cool whip. I also crumbled up a Hersheys bar and put it on top of the brownies,and used the chunk brownies.I used strawberry whip cream instead of the regular.Next time i will use 2 boxes of brownies everyone loved it ,just said it needed more chocolate and suggested more brownies,but this is a great recipe and you can do so many things with it!"
"4","5","Great, Wonderful Recipe!!! Supper Easy and Fast. I keep the ingredants on hand always for a fast last minute dessert."
"4","3","Wow, this was EXTREMELY sweet. I couldn't eat it anymore so I sent it to work with my husband and everyone there LOVED it...so I guess it's just a matter of your taste!"
"4","5","This one hardly needs another great review, but my guests really gobbled it up. Be sure to use a glass bowl because it shows off beautifully."
"4","5","This dessert was absolutely amazing. I followed some suggestions and added caramel on the brownies when layering, as well as making my own cool whip (pt whipping cream, 1/3 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla) for one of the layers as opposed to container cool whip. My daughter has determined this will be her birthday dessert, and several guests at a small get together asked for the recipe after it was totally devoured. GREAT RECIPE!!!!"
"4","5","SORRY ABOUT PREVIOUS REVIEW. ANYWAY. JUST WANTED TO TELL EVERYONE THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECIPE. THE ONLY THING THAT I CHANGED IS THE BROWNIE MIX. INSTEAD OF USING BROWNIES, I USED CHOCOLATE CAKE. AND YOU COULD USE WHATEVER KIND OF CHOCOLATE CAKE YOU WANT. TALK ABOUT PEOPLE BEGGING FOR YOUR RECIPE. THIS IS THE ONE RECIPE THAT EVERYONE IS ALWAYS ASKING ME HOW TO MAKE."
"4","5","OMG!!! If you like a rich desert you must try this! I made it for family a couple of days ago and was immediately asked to bring it for Father's Day! I also changed it up a little bit after reading some of the suggestions. I poured a little caramel over each layer of brownie and used Heath Topping on top of both layers of whipped cream. I thought the original whipped cream that was called for in the recipe with the pudding and sweetened condensed milk worked just great! I will definitely be making this many more times in the future- it is my new favorite desert!"
"4","5","Made this recipe the first time exactly according to the directions and it was really good. BUT, the second time I made it using the suggestions I received from reading the reviews: 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream, whipped (in place of the 8 oz. coolwhip), french vanilla coolwhip (in place of the 12 oz. coolwhip)and chocolate peanut butter brownie mix(instead of regular brownie mix) - also, used a grater to shave the chocolate for the top ... These suggestions turned a great dessert into a simply fabulous dessert... brought the dish to work and got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe ....yummy!"
"4","4","as written, this recipe gets 4 stars. with a few modifications as suggested by past reviews it is a 5 star recipe. i replaced some of the whipped topping with heavy whipping cream, i added a layer of strawberries, and drizzled caramel over the brownie layers. i made two for mother's day, one for my family and one for my boyfriend's family... both trifle dishes came back empty and everyone loved it! will definitely make again."
"4","5","This was really good! I used the turtle brownie mix instead of the regular and I used squeeze caramel between. I brought it to work and everyone wanted to recipe!"
"4","5","This dessert has become my trademark dish to bring to holiday gatherings. I change it up a little depending on the event. Christimas time I put candy cane pieces on top, etc."
"4","5","We found too sweet the first time, but since then, I've added ~1T. instant coffee (dissolved in the tiniest bit of hot water) and crushed Heath bars on top. Gives a deeper, but less sweet, taste. Now everyone raves."
"4","5","Simply the best! The brownies really make the recipe. I always use more cool whip than suggested...so yummy! Everywhere I bring this trifle it disappears!!! And I ALWAYS get requests for the recipe!"
"4","5","This recipe is awsome. I made it for a party and people couldn't beleive it was homemade. I added crushed oreas between the layers and decorated with oreo cookies."
"4","5","I made this for 80 people for a church function, and everyone loved it!! It is awesome!!"
"4","5","WOW! This was a hit at Easter dinner this year. All the kids went back for seconds, the adults could only handle one helping -- it is VERY sweet! But it was SO easy to put together, and what a pretty presentation it makes in the bowl. I bought already prepared Brownie Bites from Costco so that made the recipe even easier to assemble!"
"4","5","I added the 8 oz. package of cream cheese per the advice of previous posts. It is wonderful! I am serving it tomorrow for Easter and can't wait to see what everyone thinks! Definitely for chocolate lovers like myself!"
"4","4","I can only rate this on ease ... I never got any! Excellent for a potluck since it was so easy to throw together.  Update! YUM! This time around I used kahlua instead of water and not as much whipped cream in the cream only layer. I also crumbled the brownies instead of cubing them. Next time, I will use even less whipped cream - that was just too sweet. I wouldn't change the pudding-whipped cream layer at all (except for the kahlua substitution)."
"4","5","You should be ashamed of yourself for serving this at a church function. Something this SINFULLY good shoudn't be anywhere near a church!!"
"4","4","This wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It got great reviews from my family, but it wasn't spectacular. It tasted like topped brownies, not like a sophisticated dessert. This is something I might make again for my family, but I wouldn't take it to work or a party."
"4","5","This is a great tasting desert that is easy to make. It also makes a great presentation which I feel is important. It looks as appetizing as it tastes. I have been searching for something unique to bring to family gatherings and this is it! I can't wait to debut it at the next party! I will make this again and again."
"4","5","I LOVE THIS! What more can I say? This is a perfect, quick desert for any event you have coming up...or just because you want something rich!"
"4","5","This dessert is delicious. Every time I make it I just hope that no one really likes it so that I can take home the leftovers for myself! But that Never happens. Whenever I am invited to a function that requires that I bring something, the host always requests that I make this chocolate trifle. I am more than happy to prepare it, it's easy to make and even tastes great the next day after being refrigerated over night. It's awesome. THANKS!"
"4","4","I really enjoyed this recipe, I love chocolate! I really liked the brownies and the pudding together. And it is really easy to make."
"4","4","This was a good trifle. It was very sweet so a little went a long way in portion size. I followed the recipe exactly this time but next time I might jazz it up with some crushed Heath bars or another candy in the layers. I also used a trifle bowl and made three layers with the brownies and cream."
"4","5","This was a big hit with company and was pretty in the glass dish as well...will make this one again for sure."
"4","5","This recipe was a big hit in my family and has now become a family favorite. Everyone took the recipe home with them..I added some heath bits to kick it up even another notch..This definitely is a keeper.. Thanks !"
"4","5","This was scrumptious, but I changed it so much it's not really the same recipe anymore. I wanted a Brownie Cheesecake Trifle so this is what I did: used cheesecake flavored pudding, 8 oz softened cream cheese, half the can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 an 8 oz tub of whipped cream...beat well. I also used turtle brownies. I put the cream cheese mix on top of both layers of brownies and then topped with a layer of whipped cream and milk chocolate chips. Everyone raved over how good it was. Thanks for a great recipe that can be adjusted to just about anything! Fabulous."
"4","5","So good! Gooey chocolatey goodness!"
"4","5","This is an excellent dessert for a large crowd. Everybody from oldest to youngest loved it. Very easy to put together, absolutely a great dessert!!!"
"3","5","Dreamy! This dessert is good! Wow! I made my own home made whip cream (don't eat cool whip) will be making again. Thank you for sharing."
"3","5","This is very yummy... hits right in the chocolate spot! I have also made it with a chocolate cake mix baked up and cut into chunks when I didn't have a brownie mix or didn't feel like baking them from scratch. But the brownie is better than the cake."
"3","5","I make a more 'adult' version. Use chocolate or devils food cake mix. Bake cake according to directions (a sheet cake is fine). Crumble up cake and drizzle with Kahlua. Make chocolate instant pudding according to directions. Layer cake, pudding and cool whip in trifle bowl. On top layer of cool whip, decorate be drizzling chocolate syrup and sprinkle with Heath bar crumbles (found in baking aisle). This is YUMMY! Use as much Kahlua or as little as you want. If serving to the under -21 crowd you can drizzle with some coffee instead."
"3","5","Made this over the weekend for a large family dinner and everyone loved it. I did change it a bit: instead of using cool whip with the pudding, I mixed a half pint of whipping cream for 10 minutes with the Kitchen Aid mixer and folded that in. I used vanilla Jello pudding instead of chocolate pudding to contrast the chocolate in the brownies, and then I mistakenly forgot to put in the sweetened condensed milk but it was so delicious! The pudding and cream tasted just like the French pastries I had in France! I didn't put candy on top but brought a bowl of crushed butterfingers (couldn't find Heath bar which would have been perfect) so people could sprinkle them on if they wanted. I used a trifle bowl so I did 3 layers rather than 2. I baked the brownies in a 9x13 glass Pyrex so it felt like I had more to cut up for the recipe. Will make this again just the way I did it here!"
"3","5","This dessert is amazing! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used heavy whipping cream instead of Cool Whip with the pudding to cut down the sweetness. I also added Heath bits between the two layers and fresh strawberries on top."
"3","5","What a beautiful presentation this made for the table on Easter. Everyone really enjoyed this dessert and it was gone in no time. Only change I did per other reviews was to make the pudding per the package directions. This dish is so easy to make and it tastes great......"
"3","5","I stuck pretty closely to this recipe except crushed some heath bars for a topping. i used a fudgy brownie mix. if you like chocolate (which i do!) then this is the dessert for you! My mom makes a version of this she calls death by chocolate with additional ingredients of kaluha over the brownies. It is divine."
"3","5","This was very good, and very rich! It was so easy to make, too!"
"3","5","This was absolutely delicious!! I made it for our family Christmas gathering and it was a big hit. I did do a few things differently - I used real whipping cream and added vanilla extract to get the french vanilla flavor. I used cook and serve pudding instead of instant. And I added strawberries and kiwis. It was excellent!"
"3","5","I made this for a church luncheon and the gals told me I was evil! It was a hit. Very rich and delicious! I used some of the suggestions about using whipping cream and I actually had some Heath toffee bits that I sprinkled over each layer. In my pantry, I had the brownie cookie bar mix and it was so wonderful - I chopped them into very small squares to layer in the trifle."
"3","5","Sooooo Very Very Very Good--if you love chocolate!!"
"3","5","Very good dessert. I omitted the condensed milk."
"3","5","I made this for Easter (the night before). I took the advice of others and tweaked it a bit. I used Triple Chunk Brownie mix and Chocolate Fudge Jello. I made my own whipped cream instead of the frozen in a tub. I put a layer of Hershey's Caramel syrup over both brownie layers along with Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips. I also used the chips on top instead of the shaved candy bar. I also added a bit of vanilla to the pudding mix. This was very rich but OH, SO DELICIOUS!! I plan to make this for our next neighborhood get-together!"
"3","5","Wow! I have made this several times and got top dollar at our church bake auctions. My daughter used this for her cake at her last birthday and everyone loved it. Everyone is always asking for the recipe. I have made it exactly as described, but I prefer a little less of a sweet overload. In the mouse mixture, instead of cool whip I fold in some unsweetened whipping cream. Yum, Yum, Yum!"
"3","4","Clearly a lot of people have made this, but here's my 2 cents. Very sweet and the brownies from a mix taste metallic to me... so not my fave but it's a crowd pleaser. I used REAL whipped cream (why not? just as cheap, not as sweet, better for you!) and next time I'll make real brownies to improve the taste."
"3","1","Extremely too sweet. It had the flavor of those fancy pastries you get at a grocery store bakery. Just a fake, sweet, extremely rich flavor. I had another version for a chocolate trifle but thought I would try this for a change. I definitely like mine better. The difference is that you make the pudding according to the directions and pour this over the brownies. You also add chopped candy bars to the layers. I use either Heath bars or Resses' Cups. Anyway, I will not make this version again."
"3","5","I added heath topping YUM"
"3","3","Good enough, but not great."
"3","5","I love this recipe! No only is it delicious and everyone likes it, but it's also a pretty dessert! Very easy to make and can be made the day before, which makes it convenient for holidays when there is so much food to prepare."
"3","5","SOO SWEET a little bit goes a long way!"
"3","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and was told that it was a MUST for Christmas as well. I used my own homemade whipped cream as suggested on here. I also used a larger box of pudding than called for in the recipe. On the brownie layer, I drizzled chocolate syrup and caramel topping. Fantastic Recipe! Even my pickiest family members loved it!"
"3","5","very tasty! the second time i made it, however, i made my own pudding (old english cream pie filling by janell on this site) and my own brownies. and for a different twist on the whipped topping, i used the alcohol infused whipped cream! Dont pass this one up!"
"3","5","Very good! It was a hit at Christmas dinner. People were asking for seconds!"
"3","5","Don't need to change a thing - this recipe is a winner!!"
"3","5","I use the brownie bites from Safeway which saves time. My daughter loves this stuff!"
"3","4","This was a big hit at my holiday party. Several people asked for the recipe and requested that I make it again next year. I only gave it 4 stars however because I thought it was a bit too sweet (even though I used real whipped cream instead of whipped topping). Maybe if I add strawberries next time (a little tart to mello the sweet), I might like it better."
"3","5","AMAZING!! I make this (tripled!) EVERY Christmas and family holidays... it goes by quickly, little kids look amazed at the towering dessert, and it's delish!! LOVE IT!! Many thanks to the author!"
"3","4","This was good. Super sweet but delicious. Eaten in moderation, it's fantastic."
"3","5","This is sooooo good. I used my favorite brownie recipe from scratch and made my own whip cream. It might be a little more work but definitely worth the effort."
"3","4","My family loved it!"
"3","5","Nobody ever dislikes a triffle."
"3","5","This is a fantastic dessert recipe. I made it exactly as shown in the recipe and it came out wonderful. I am making again for Thanksgiving dessert. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"3","5","All I can say is that this is a huge hit whenever I make it and with whoever I make it for. I always add lots of toffee candy bar bits to it because I love them and love the crunch they provide. Other than that, I make just as written. Phenomenal and easy dessert that holds up even a few days later!"
"3","5","This recipe was delicious (but I tweeked it a bit)! I added heavy whipping cream with 2 tbs of sugar to the pudding mixture instead of cool whip. I also sprinkled Hershey's chocolate syrup on the brownie layer with Reeses ice cream toppings (sprinkles) between each layer. My coworkers went crazy over it! This dessert makes a beautiful presentation & was very rich! I loved every bite!"
"3","5","This looked and tasted amazing..Made the night before. Made it just like the recipie..no alterations. Everyone love it."
"3","5","OMG this was sooooo good. As other reviews, I added fresh whipped cream with the chocolate mixture as well as drizzled caramel topping on top of the brownies and some crumbles of Butterfinger candies bars. On the top just drizzled a little caramel and Butterfinger candies . It turned out great and everyone loved it."
"3","5","This is also great with chocolate cake instead of brownies."
"3","4","Fabulous!! First time I made this I followed the recipe and it was entirely too sweet. The second time I made it I followed the suggestions of other reviewers. I made a fudgey brownie and for the chocolate pudding layer I used half a pint of heavy whipping cream. I whipped the cream and added the chocolate fudge pudding mix and water to it. I also layered crushed oreos between the chocolate whipped cream and the regular whipped cream. In my opinon the oreos were what made it in the end. If you make this it MUST be made a day in advance!"
"3","5","OH MY GOD. I wanted to make a trifle, because I'd never had, and I had a Pampered Chef trifle dish to try, etc etc. I saw this recipe and decided to make and serve it at a little dinner party we were having last Saturday. First of all, it looked SO PRETTY in the dish. Second... IT TASTED AWESOME! Third....IT WAS EASY. Fourth...EVERYONE LOVED IT. All in all, I will be making this wonderful yummy dessert again and again. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!"
"3","5","I added a drizzle of coffee caramel sauce (by Stonewall kitchen) and a light sprinkling of crumbled Heathbar (two bars total used) on top of the brownie layer. Also took the suggestion of using whipped heavy cream in with the pudding mix. So, brownie layer, coffee caramel sauce, heathbar, chocolate pudding, cool whip, and repeat. Topped it with a sprinkling of heathbar for decoration."
"3","5","yuuum everyone loved it.....I ended up using 18 ounces of whipped topping for the layers....the result was amazing after setting for 24 hours in a refrigerater the longer it sets in there the better it is."
"3","5","I make this frequently. I always get asked for the recipe! I do what some others do, I use real whipped cream with the pudding and condensed milk...SO MUCH BETTER that way!!"
"3","4","I'm sure this would have been good as is, but with changes was GREAT! I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 1 pint of heavy cream, whipped with 5-6 tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also drizzled caramel ice cream topping over the brownie layers and topped the whipped topping layers with toffee bits. Make sure it sits overnight. It is very sweet and rich, so some may prefer it after a light meal only. My GF said it was 10 stars :)"
"3","5","WONDERFUL! I made this for a function, and it was completely gone. I used 'Extra Creamy Cool Whip' and it made it thick and rich. Yum!"
"3","5","I thought this recipe was wonderful!!! It was the 1st thing gone at a family reunion.I put carmel and toffee bits between each layer.I use fudge pudding flavor and french vanilla cool whip as another stated and it was wonderful.I also use a bigger package of brownies to make sure I had enough and I am glad I did cause it was just right.Thanks for a great recipe!!!!"
"3","5","Wow! I just had to write about this dish. I made this for dessert when I had my family/in-laws over for dinner,It was my first time making chocolate trifle and we were not disappointed. It was very easy to make and is a family favorite. Some reviews say this is to sweet but I say wash it down with a little milk and you be good to go. Thank you for the fantastic recipe."
"3","5","I make this for a community dinner the Grange puts on once a year. This is perfect when asked to bring a desert for 20 people. I assemble individual ones in clear solid plastic cups (7-8oz), and they look wonderful. Kids love this desert. Whipped topping, pudding, and brownies....yum."
"3","5","Awesome!! Even better if you add toffee chips and chopped pecans to brownie mix and mini chocolate chips to pudding mix. Then top final layer of whipped topping w/ toffee chips and chocolate syrup!!!"
"3","5","By far...the BEST DESSERT I have ever had!!!! Every time I make this...we never have any leftover. I followed the suggestion from another user and in the pudding layer, instead of folding in the whipped topping, I bought half a pint of heavy whipping cream and whipped that for about 10 minutes myself and then folded that into the pudding. I have trouble finding it...but vanilla flavored cool whip is the best on this! I am not a huge fan of vanilla flavored foods...but it is just the right amount on this rich chocolate treat! I have also used brownies with peanut butter chips in them and that was a big hit too! So yummy!!!"
"3","4","This recipe was delicious! I changed a few things, I used chocolate mouse (Martha Stewart recipe) instead of chocolate pudding, and it added to the fluffy and lightness of the trifle. I also used Martha's fudge brownie recipe."
"3","5","If you like things that taste rich...you will love this dish! Thank you for sharing."
"3","1","I did not care for this. It is over sweet and tastes completely artificial. I substituted real whipped cream and cut the sugar drastically and it didn't help. Only one person at Thanksgiving could finish his serving."
"3","5","I love this recipe! I had a trifle bowl for years, but had never used it. This recipe gave me an excuse to put it to good use. I added a couple of tweaks when I made the recipe. I followed the suggestions made by the top reviewer. I made my own whipped cream and added Bailey's Irish Cream to it for extra flavor. I also added cherry pie filling to the layers for the extra pop of color. I will definitely make this one again for a special occasion."
"3","4","Good concept but definitely needs some tweaking. I followed the exact recipe the first time I made it (except I used Oreo pudding instead of chocolate) and I agree with others that this dessert is WAY too sweet (sickeningly sweet). HOWEVER it is absolutely necessary to let it sit overnight -- this drastically changes the taste and makes it way better. Still, I changed it up a bit the 2nd time: 1. I got rid of the whipped topping altogether. 2. To balance out the sweetness, I used real whipped cream and a moist chocolate cake instead of brownies. I also reduced the condensed milk to half the amount and used regular milk for the other half. I wouldn't advise omitting the condensed milk entirely, because that's what gives the pudding a more firm/silky texture, but definitely leave the whipped topping out. I liked it much better this way."
"3","5","This was a huge hit, everyone loves it!"
"3","5","My husband said this was the best desert I'd made in a long time!!! I didn't use the sweetened condensed milk, I used skim milk only. I also used 4 Reeses cups and chopped them up, I put some in the middle and some on top. It was really good, and even better the next day! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe."
"3","5","This is a lovely dessert!! It was excellent. Used low fat sweetened condensed milk, angel food cake, low fat brownies, fat free pudding, 95% fat free whipped topping, chopped pecans and skor bits. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"3","5","Such a good recipe. Very, very rich!"
"3","5","I have made a variation of this several times and I am always asked to make this. Try sprinkling Kahlua over the brownie layers. Also, use white chocolate pudding mix and combine with the cool whip to combine the pudding and cool whip layer. Freezing the Heath bars and crushing them is much easier, or just use a package of Skor bits. Yum...great recipe, very very easy!!"
"3","5","This was amazingly good! I used fat free Cool Whip. I didn't use any sweetened condensed milk. This was perfect! It tasted like chocolate mousse with brownies!"
"3","4","For me this was a three star dessert because it tasted like brownies with whipped cream and thick chocolate custard. It was also too rich for me and made me feel a little sick. Hubby on the other hand loved it LOVED IT loved it. He kept repeating 'this is good, this is goooood' lol. He gave 4 1/2 stars, but the man rarely ever gives a 4. It tasted a hundred times better the next day - like all trifles do - the flavours had a chance to meld together. So, all up I'm giving this 4 stars and I will try to enhance the recipe for a Christmas dessert. UPDATE: I made a chocolate cake for a party and the bottom half stuck to the pan, perfectly cooked even though I greased it. I used the cake cut up in chunks in this recipe. Dh said as he was eating it, 'Thank goodness for stuff ups.' I used chocolate custard, 1/2 tin cond. milk, and whipped cream for the chocolate layer. Cake, chocolate cream, chopped macadamias, whipped cream, crumbled violet crumble bar and repeat until all finished. So, if you mess a cake up and it's still cooked, try this recipe. Oh yeah, don't eat until it sits in the fridge for 2-3 days. Perrrffection!!!!"
"3","5","Highly Recommended! I added raspberries (see photo) and it just made it perfect. I used fat free/sugar free instant pudding too. My boxes weren't the same measurements as the ingredients list states but I used 2 boxes and it came out good. Simple recipe and it looks like it took forever!"
"3","5","Amazing! It is very sweet, but it is still awesome. I have made it twice now and the second time I made it with real whipped cream to cut down on some of the sweetness. Also I put strawberries on top and its delicious that way."
"3","5","Excellent!!!! Followed the recommodations of others. French Vanilla cool whip and a jar of carmel sauce drizzled between layers."
"3","3","I'm giving this three stars, but it really depends on your audience. I made it with the heath topping/caramel/real whip cream for mousse and vanilla cool whip for a work party. It seems to be something that the older crowd liked--I got huge compliments on it from them. The younger crowd was scared of it I think, and honestly, it tasted like chocolate pudding and whipped cream--not that 'wow!' really. Also, the heath bits looked sort of like peanuts to some people so they didn't try it, beware of that if you go that route."
"3","5","This is super easy to make, really delicious, and a real crowd pleaser! I made a few adjustments: 1) fat-free cool whip, 2) fat-free condensed milk, and 3) sliced strawberries instead of candy. Its a great method and I can't wait to try other variations!"
"3","5","I just made this for a baby shower at work. The bowl was completely empty in about 10 minutes! I used the suggestions of others... (whipping cream, caramel, sliced strawberries, mini chocolate chips and French vanilla cool whip) and it was absolutely perfect. I was able to make three layers instead of two and it filled the bowl right up to the top. The way everyone is talking about it I'm sure I will be making this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","We are chocolate lovers so we thought this was great! Sometimes I add toffee bits or add walnuts to the brownies for a little crunch. My next plan is to try making with blonde brownies with butterscotch chips and using a butterscotch pudding."
"3","5","Very rich and delicious.   I threw in a layer of crushed candy canes and served it around Christmas time."
"3","5","This review is a little late, but I've been making this since last year for christmas!! It is one of the easiest desserts to make ever!!! I'm always the desingnated one for dessert!!! I have people begging me for this recipe!!! I follow it exactly but did try the vanilla whip cream but really didn't care to much for it and I also LOVE putting caramel and chocolate suyrup in the layers to give it an extra kick!! Works like a charm everytime!! Will be making this for years!!!"
"3","5","I am asked to bring this to every family get-together for my Husband's family. I follow the recipe but add frozen strawberries. I let the strawberries defrost and then put them on top of the plain cool whip layers, except the top. I usually put about 4 strawberries in the middle on the top and then put M&M's around the edge. It looks pretty and tastes sooooo good!"
"3","5","This recipe was super simple and fabulous! I whipped my own cream to fold into the pudding mixture as per other reviewers suggestions. I also used french vanilla whipped topping as well. To break up the monotany of chocolate, I cut in 2 bananas to each layer for a total of 4 bananas. Perfectly delicious!"
"3","1","This recipe is a DISASTER!!! Do NOT make it. I followed other reviewers opinions by making my own whipped cream and I ended up with a chocolate paste. It has yet to be eaten so there is a chance I will update my review. This recipe is extremely time consumig to make and in my opinion shouldn't even be on this website."
"3","5","I have smoked pumpkin pie every Thanksgiving with this recipe. Just about made my sister-in-law cry when no one wanted her lowfat pumpkin pie. Made it exactly to recipe, making sure to use a 9x13 pan so that there was enough brownie chunks for multiple layers. The only change I made was to use mini chocolate chips instead of the shaved chocolate. Even a novice like myself can bring this dessert and get everyone talking!!"
"3","2","This was okay, but it didn't really impress me. I can see how children might like this but it wasn't great. If your idea of a great dessert is Jello Pudding mix with cool whip then you would like this, but you could save yourself some energy and just make the pudding and cool whip."
"3","5","I followed this recipe exactly and the result was amazing. It's pretty fool proof and looks nice enough to impress your guests. I was a little concerned when I mixed together the pudding, water, and condensed milk because there were tiny little lumps in the mixture but, in the end, I didn't even notice them. The only problem I had was with shaving the candy bar before it melted all over me. Maybe it would help to regrigerate it slightly before shaving but not so long as to make it brittle. I'm going to make this next time I have guests over."
"3","5","SO good! I like to drizzle caramel and chocolate sauce on top of the whipped cream layers and then I sprinkle with a good amount of the Heath Bar chips on top. Yum!"
"3","5","What a wonderful recipe! When I make this I add chopped pecans and heath bits on top of the whipped topping. It is also great with homemade whipped cream in place of the whipped topping as many others have stated."
"3","5","This was excellent. Quite messy but well worth it. Next time I would probably make a point of using the low fat/sugar free versions of the main ingredients. I thought it was quite rich and could be taken down a notch by using 'healthier' ingredients."
"3","5","Great recipe. I prefer to make this a day ahead. The chocolate pudding mixture seems mousse-like after it has been refrigerated for a day. It would probably be good with french vanilla flavored cool whip too."
"3","5","This is AMAZING!! Everyone LOVED it! I took someone's advice and drizzled some warm caramel over the brownies when layering it and I used Heath bar (all smashed up)over the cool whip layer to give it some more texture. It was SOOOO yummy, I have been asked for the recipe 3 times in a week!"
"3","5","Wonderful! This was the most popular dessert at my baby shower. I used the Betty Crocker brand of brownie mix, which is my personal favorite. Sooo delish!"
"3","5","A huge holiday hit! Everyone called it sinful and went on and on!  I followed some of the advice of the other reviews and made my own whipped cream using 1/2 pint of whipping cream and 3 TBS of sugar. I then folded that (instead of the cool whip) into the pudding mixture.  A couple layers of toffee chips added a bit of crunch and extra flavor! I also added an extra egg into the brownie mixture to make it more cake like and extremely moist! People didn't stop talking about it!!!  Great recipe!"
"3","5","This was super rich, but I followed some of the advice of others, and instead of folding cool whip into the pudding mixture, I whipped 1/2 a pint heavy cream for 10 minutes and then folded into the pudding mixture. I also drizzled caramel (the kind for ice cream) over the brownies as I was layering and topped the dish off with heath toffee pieces. This was a fun and yummy recipe...thanks for sharing it."
"3","4","Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. What could be better? Oh, it's EASY. YUM. Thanks!"
"3","5","I made this for a family gathering this weekend and it was a huge hit! I used 3 eggs for the brownies to make it softer and added cut up kit kat bars on top of the cool whip layers. For the topping I added additional kit kat pieces and shaved milk chocolate Hershy bars. This is now a new family fav. Thank You!!"
"3","5","I made this for a dinner party. It was soooo good! However, in my opinion, a critical change is using a bag of Heath toffee peices (1/2 layered on top of the first whip cream layer and the rest on the very top) instead of the chocolate curls. As the dish sits in the fridge, some of the toffee moistens into the most yummy caramel, while other pieces stay crunchy. It is a wonderful addition to all the chocolate and whip cream layers. Try it! I promise you'll love it this way!"
"3","3","This is a good recipe, but not my favorite. It was a little too sweet. I served to 4 guests, and they didn't go for seconds. The sweetened condensed milk is a bit much. I think making my own whipped cream with heavy whipping cream will lighten the dessert. Brownies were good, but for a lighter dessert I might use chocolate cake instead next time. Good for some, but I'll be doing lots of modifications."
"3","5","THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!! EVERYBODY LOVED IT...SCRAPPED THE BOWL...I READ SOME OTHER COMMENTS THAT WERE LEFT AND MADE A FEW SUBSTITUTIONS AS WELL...AND WOULDNT CHANGE A THING. MY FIRST LAYER WAS HALF THE BROWNIES AS STATED, BUT I COOKED THE BROWNIES IN A PAN LINED WITH CARMEL & ALSO FOLDED THE CARMEL ON TOP OF THE BROWIES, SECOND LAYER WAS HALF THE CHOC PUDDING MIX AS STATED AGAIN I MIXED THE PUDDING MIX WITH THE COND. MILK AND ETRA CREAMY WHIPPED TOPPING, THEN THE NEXT LAYER WITH THE WHIPED TOPPING I LAYERED IT WITH TOFFEE AND CARMEL SWIRLS...REPEATED THE LAYERS AND ON THE TOP LAYER I DECORATED IT WITH THE TOFFEE CHIPS, CARMEL SWIRLS AND MINI PEANUT BUTTER CUPS....YUMMMMMM : ) AND AS IF IT WASNT GOOD ENOUGH...NEXT TIME I MIGHT ADD ONE LAYER IN THE MIDDLE OF MARSHMELLOW FLUFF...JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BECAUSE THE WAY I DID IT WAS WONDERFUL IN ITS SELF."
"3","5","OK, so I didn't think this was great at first, but the taste is definetly in the wait!! I made this 2 days ahead of time, and it tasted just OK on the day I served it. BUT, after sitting for 5 days, this was AWESOME!!! Like others, I just followed the directions on the pudding box and used real whipped cream with vanilla and a tad bit of sugar whipped in. Impressive and easy dessert. I would double this recipe next time and fill the trifle bowl ALL the way up (my Pampered Chef trifle bowl only got 2/3's of the way filled up--which is fine if you don't want seconds!)."
"3","5","This recipe is amazing! I took it to a church potluck dinner and came home with an empty dish! I will definitely make this recipe again!"
"3","5","When I first made this review, I had only tasted it after it sat for 24 hours and thought it okay. THEN I tried it again after more than 36 hours and it made quite a difference! Next time, I will make changes as others have suggested, such as caramel sauce in between the layers, maybe some fruit - something to add some pizazz to it. My family seemed to like it, but there was a lot left (hmmm, maybe cause there were lots of desserts to choose from?) I will definitely make it again - thanks for the recipe."
"3","5","This is the best dessert ever!!! I used crushed Heath bar and drizzled carmel over the brownie layers. YUM!"
"3","4","i made this recipe in my trifle bowl and i put a layer of crushed heath bars at the top of each layer. i definately will make again, but the next time, i am going to put a layer of hot fudge in the layering as well. thanks for a great recipe."
"3","4","This was okay - nothing special. It tasted exactly like the combination of prepackaged ingredients it is, and I prefer a more homemade flavor. Still, if you like chocolate pudding and cool whip, perhaps this is for you."
"3","5","Excellent! I used Ghirridelli (sp?) brownie mix. I love the 'mousse' which is a nice switch from the boring puddings that most trifles call for in their recipes; however, I think the recipe needed something to break up the richness of the dessert so I added a few layers of fresh raspberries and omitted the candybar...perfection! Thank you so much!"
"3","5","Loved this! We made it with sugar-free pudding and Lite Cool Whip. We also topped it with Heath bar bits. So good. One tip: be sure your whipped topping is nice and cold or it will runn everywhere (still tastes good, though!)."
"3","4","Idiot proof dessert that will win over the most picky eater"
"3","5","This is a chocolate lovers dream - this is amazing. I served this at a dinner party last night and everyone loved it."
"3","5","This recipe was amazing.....I was looking for something different for our Christmas dinner and I found this and tried it. I can't even explain how much everyone raved about this dessert. One person told me that I should make it and sell it by the plate. I now have a new favorite and most requested dessert for every holiday and function. Thank you!!!"
"3","5","I made this two days in a row for different parties and the response was phenomenal. Many people asked for the recipe to make on their own. When I made it, though, I followed the ideas of others and used heavy whip instead of cool whip and added strawberries on top of the cool whip layer above the chocolate layer. The strawberries mixed well with the chocolate and gave it some texture."
"3","5","Very good, but very rich. A little goes a long way!!! My 6 and 11 year lod made this with a little help from me for a Christmas Eve family get-to-gether and it was a hit. They put crushed candycanes on top."
"3","5","Awesome recipe, the only thing is that one brownie mix package is not nearly enough to complete this recipe.   I guess I had a really large bowl that I used, because I had to basically double this recipe to fill the bowl. I used one brownie mix package, and one white case mix package, two packages each of vanilla pudding and chocolate pudding. Then layered, cake & brownies, vanilla pudding, chocolate pudding, whipping cream, and repeated those layers twice more."
"3","5","This was my first time making this type of dessert. the family loved it. they said it reminded them of a chocolate mousse type pie. It wasn't too sweet. Very nice presentation. Even though I arrived for dinner late, it was mostly gone when I left. The other desserts had only been barely touched! As one reviewer once said 'Nothing says good,than gone!!!!"
"3","5","Really good, and so pretty."
"3","5","super easy and a huge hit!"
"3","5","Excellent!"
"3","5","It IS too sweet. But I still love it! Maybe we could use UNsweetened condensed milk and then add a little sugar, but not too much. Then it would be just as easy, but we could control how sweet it is a little bit more."
"3","5","I made this for a lady's birthday at work and it was amazing! I'll definitely make it again. Something this delicious shouldn't be so easy to make!"
"3","5","This recipe is soooo delicious. I loved it and my husband made sure he let's me know that he loved it just as much as i did. I used the BEST BROWNIES recipe from this site, and didn't have any condensed milk, nor do they have instant chocolate pudding where i am. So i used regular ready made chocolate pudding (dark) and chocolate cookie pudding (light). I layered it this way. 1. brownies. 2. dark pudding 3.light pudding. 4. dark pudding. 5 brownies. 6 whipped cream. 7. chocolate chip morsels.  This is definately a keeper. I love the idea. Next time i will try it with fresh strawberries somewhere in between."
"3","5","i followed everyone else's example and used heavy cream rather than cool whip. tasted excellent and looked beautiful."
"3","5","If I could rate this a 10 I would, the bowl will be empty after you put it out. I've been making this for years but a little different version. A few less items then the original recipe calls for and you may have them in your pantry. I use 2 cans of already prepapred pudding or 8 - 9 little handipacks of pudding and just one 8oz tub of whipped topping and pan of brownies. Chop up a chocolate bar and add between layers of brownie and pudding. Shave chocolate on last later of whipped topping. Any way you make this you won't be disappointed."
"3","5","Very yummy! My husband doesn't like these kind of desserts, and he loved this! I added chopped oreos in both layers. I made it for a gathering of 6 adults and it was almost entirely gone by the end of the night!"
"3","5","This is an awesome dessert. I have been making it regularly for over a year now!! I always get rave reviews and everyone wants the recipe.  I made this for Halloween and colored the white cool whip orange and layered crushed oreos between the orange cool whip and second brownie layer and then put crushed oreos on top. Added some Milano cookies cut in 1/2 with 'RIP' written on them as headstones, and added some gummy worms for a very cute Halloween dessert. You absolutely can't go wrong with this recipe!!"
"3","5","This is a wonderful dessert. I took this to a potluck at work and was devoured in now time. Everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I did different was layered crushed heath bars or score candy bars with the choc. pudding and some on top. This gave a little crunch to go along with the soft brownies. This is a very sweet dessert so a little goes along way on your plate. But so good!!!!! Thanks for the recipe Wayne!"
"3","5","Awesome Recipe. I took it to the in-laws Christmas eve. Everybody loved it. Very Pretty dessert. Easy to make.Keeps well for a couple days Thank you Wayne"
"3","5","Can I just first of all say that my husband loves this recipe more than he loves me. Seriously, if we were getting divorced, he would give me all his assets just to have this recipe. He raves about it all over town to his friends, but his friends never get any because he eats it all before they can get any. This is really a great recipe."
"3","5","WOW WOW WOW! The only suggestion I have for this recipe is that it could use a little crunch. The next time I make it, I think I'll top it with chopped nuts."
"3","5","WOW!!! This is really amazing! I used heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip for the chocolate mixture so it wasn't so sweet and it was perfect! I sliced some strawberries that were about to go bad and put them in the layers. Oh boy is it ever good! Next time I might try layering caramel in stead of fruit. (BTW, I added no sugar to the heavy cream when I whipped it :)"
"3","4","This was really good! Very rich!"
"3","5","I made this for Christmas and it was a big hit. Nobody found it too sweet. I used a chocolate fudge brownie mix and baked them in a 9x13 pan. Cut them into 1 inch squares and put double layers of brownies in the trifle. It was very very yummy."
"3","5","What a pretty dessert! I used white chocolate pudding and 1/2 cup of strong, brewed coffee in place of the water. I also sprinkled toffee bits on the whipped topping layers. Served it to the non-pumpkin pie eating crowd at Thanksgiving...I caught the pumpkin-eaters enjoying it too!"
"3","4","This was a great dessert, but rich! I made the mistake of substituting whipped topping for the real whipped cream and you could tell the difference - still good though."
"3","5","Made this for my family's big Christmas Eve get together. Used Ghirardelli boxed brownie mix, which is the best, used half the amount of sweetened condensed milk and the other half whole milk, made my own whipped cream instead of cool whip. Put chopped nuts on top. Sooo good!"
"3","5","This is the best dessert. Took it to church and they actually licked the bowl clean. Gave the recipe to my cousin as a 'secret family recipe' and again it won great raves. Easy to make and tastes great!!"
"3","4","I followed the suggestions to use 1/2 pint whipping cream in the chocolate pudding mixture, but I still used frozen whipped topping for the layer. I also added a can of cherry pie filling on top of the cool whip layer so I had four layers instead of three, that way it tasted good and it looked great in the trifle bowl! Overall this deseret tasted good but it is really heavy and sweet for me. A few bites is all you need. My husband (a chocaholic) loved it and begged me to make it again."
"3","5","This was PERFECT. Once a month I cook dinner for your staff at our church youth group. There are about 30 youth workers. It was so fun to see ALL of them SAVORING this dessert. Some asked that I make this every month. I made this the night before. I was lucky enough to have leftovers and rewarded my self durning nap time. Thanks for this recipe it has won me many friends."
"3","5","I have made this recipie to bring to cookouts twice in the past month. I have gotten rave reviews at both parties. They love the moose-like mixture it really makes the dish. The only thing I added was a straight pudding layer and only because my trifle bowl was to big. Thanks for this recipie I will use over and over!"
"3","4","I thought this was very good but some of my guests for dinner thought it was too sweet. I used a trifle dish and made three layers instead of the two. I wish I would have left it as two because it seemed like every time I took a scoop out for someone it was all cream, not brownie."
"3","5","I followed the advice of others and used real whipped cream. I also added a block of low-fat cream cheese to the pudding mixture. I gave this to my best friend for her birthday as she is a choc-o-holic. She was thrilled and declared that she was not going to share!"
"3","5","This recipe was so yummy and easy! I undercooked the brownies slightly to add to their chewiness and richness. The only thing I might add for cruch is a some broken up heath or skor bars. Or maybe even some nuts. It is a keeper - great for parties!"
"3","5","This is a very attractive and easy to make desert. I and my guests did however find it a trifle (no pun intended, ha) sweet. I think I will try the suggestions from Christina the next time I make. All in all it was delicious!!"
"3","5","This has to be the most awesome dessert recipe I have ever made! It is just perfect the way it is! I bought the new Allrecipes.com cookbook and found this recipe in it. When I seen the photo of this trifle, I knew I had to make it! Well, my husband and I just love it. I made it last night and just between the 2 of us, 1/2 of the bowl is already gone! I plan on making this for our church Christmas Party this Saturday and cannot wait for everyone to try it! If this trifle were the only thing I was to ever make from that cookbook, then I have to say the cookbook is worth every single penny just for this recipe! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!"
"3","5","Very light and extremely delicious!!! I would add more brownies and less cool whip"
"3","5","I made this trifle form Thanksgiving yesterday, but prepared it the night before. I was such a hit. There was also 2 pumpkin pies, 2 apple pies, pumpkin bars and a cheesecake. The trifle was completely gone (people were scraping the sides of the bowl) and the other stuff barely got touched. Great Recipe! I will DEFINITELY make it again."
"3","5","This tasted as good as it looked, and it was easier than I had imagined. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","Yum! I went the extra mile when making this lovely dessert for dinner guests and whipped my own cream rather than using whipped topping. Hope you're not counting calories!"
"3","5","So rich and delicious! A little bit is plenty!"
"3","3","The finished product tasted great. When making this, I found the pudding layer  to be very runny. When I layered it in the trifle bowl, it sunk down and covered the brownies so it looked like I only had 2 layers instead of 3. Because the brownies  and the pudding become sort of 1 layer, I had to buy more cool whip for the top  so it would reach near the top of the trifle bowl. Also beware of the melting factor. If you leave this out of the refrigerator for too long the pudding layer becomes  all runny again. As long as it stays cold, the trifle stays in a firm state."
"2","5","Always a big hit at the holidays!"
"2","5","This was amazing, I made it for a party but had to make some last minute improvises. I thought I had chocolate pudding but was wrong. I had vanilla. So I folded in vanilla with nutella and if you are using heath bar which was suggested by a reviewer.. The nutella paired perfectly and added this needed element to it.. This is an amazing recipe!!"
"2","5","try making it in single serving cups... it makes more. and is still good."
"2","5","Great idea but I used whipped cream with vanilla and made my own chocolate mousse"
"2","4","this is a wow every time i make it for others. over the years, it's become too sweet for me. but i'll continue to serve it."
"2","3","I was asked to make a trifle, and everyone liked it. So it's a crowed pleaser. Personally, all the packaged and boxed ingredients made me think of something I would eat at a school cafeteria. Overly sweet and one-note. Still, others liked it."
"2","5","The 'next' generation is responsible for cooking for our large family Christmas get-together, so my daughter chose this recipe. Her only change was using pre-made deli brownies (iced), using 'lite' whipped topping (it's actually a bit richer than the regular), and adding about 2 tablespoons of instant coffee granules to the chocolate mixture. It was fantastic! And it feeds a LOT of people! Perfect recipe for beginner cooks and a hit dessert!"
"2","3","Reading other reviews, I decided to use 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream instead of the 8 oz. frozen whipped cream and it was still too sweet."
"2","4","If you like chocolate it is wonderful but the second layer could have cherry pie filling then the cream then chocolate cake again then more cream topped with maraschino cherries strategically placed."
"2","4","I have a similar recipe for this trifle which includes one layer of strawberry preserves, 1 layer of devils food cake (cooked and cubed)  the chocolate pudding, and cool whip. Then I began a second layer of each."
"2","5","Divine"
"2","5","I made this recipe once but changed it. Instead of putting whipped topping in the chocolate mixture, I put a half a pint of heavy cream and beat it for a minute or until it gets thicker. It is WAY too sweet when you make it with the whipped topping."
"2","2","Ok, I don't believe I am going to say this....but this was WAY too much chocolate!! Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible and I can see how other people absolutely loved it but it was just too much for me (and even my kids!) and it was definitely too sweet."
"2","5","I made this for a party and it was a hit, everyone wanted more, next time i will make double or triple so there is enough."
"2","3","Most of those who rated this high tweaked the recipe so the overall rating is misleading. I made this exactly as per recipe and found it too sweet. It could have all been changed with omitting the condensed milk and just making the pudding as the box directions. I can guarantee it would have made 5 stars otherwise in my book!"
"2","5","Fantastic!!"
"2","5","Any time I have to bring a dessert, I bring this and it always is the first thing to completely get eaten!"
"2","5","Awesome trifle. I substituted real whipping cream for cool whip - much better."
"2","5","This recipe does not need a review to know it is good. How can you go wrong with layers of Brownies, Chocolate Pudding and Whipped Topping??? It is every bit as good as you would imagine, no surprises at all. The kids raved about it and protested when it was gone."
"2","5","I followed the advice of Roxanne323 and added heavy cream in place of cool whip. I also doubled the ingredients because there was a lot of people I was serving. It was a major hit, so easy to make and DELICIOUS!!"
"2","5","Delicious! I skipped the water and condensed milk and made pudding as directed, after folding in the cool whip it created a chocolate mousse layer. Yummy! Also layered caramel and crushed heath bar. A huge hit at parties!"
"2","5","This is amazing! I had a couple modifications that other reviewers suggested. I added caramel sauce and chopped butterfinger pieces after the whipped cream layer. I also made my own whipped cream using a recipe from this site to mix with the pudding, and then used french vanilla cool whip to layer. Still very rich, but delicious. Everyone loved it. Doesn't last long even though it makes a ton! Only problem with this dessert is that its a little expensive--but well worth it!!"
"2","5","Very good. Very rich."
"2","5","Yum. Made this at Birthdays, Thanksgiving and Christmas...Never any leftovers. Nice and Simple. I use a little more Cool Whip in the mixture...takes it right over the edge. Love it!"
"2","4","4 Stars as writted, excellent Dessert. After tasting the original recipe, I decided to make a couple changes the next time I made it. I added Caramel on top of the brownies, and put Toffee chips on top of the cool whip layers, this turned an already wonderful creation into what my family and friends refer to as Death by Chocolate. Even my godson brought in the makings for a home ec class for a project. everyone loved it."
"2","5","Fabulous! I had never made a trifle before, but I had to make desserts for a crowd and wanted to bring something that looked fantastic. I followed the recipe, but I used a store-bought fudgy brownie and cut it into small squares. I also crumbled Oreo cookies over the first three layers for added texture. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again."
"2","4","At first I was giving this 3 stars because I wasnt't all that impressed with it. I only had it in the refrigerator about 6 hrs before we ate it. I had it again today and it definitely got better after it sat. Im still not in love with it, however. I followed it to a T because I don't like to alter recipes often until I try the original version first. My husband and I found this very rich and sweet. If I do make it again, I will use homemade whipped cream, since many reviewers have done this and feel its better that way and I might omit the condensed milk and use regular milk, since it was so sweet. I may also add some caramel to break up the monotony of all the chocolate, which is odd since I am a huge chocolate lover."
"2","4","I made this dessert for a family bbq this past weekend and it was a hit. It was a last minute decision to make this Trifle, and becasue I was pressed for time I used a couple packages of Two-Bite Brownies instead of the brownie mix. Following the advice of many other reviews I drizzled each brownie layer with caramel syrup and used real whipped cream for pudding mixture. I used a crushed up Skor bar for the top. I will make this again for sure, next time I will try it with homemade brownies."
"2","4","Very good and very easy to make. I think next time I will try doing whipped cream as other reviewers suggested, just to see the difference. This recipe is definitely a crowd pleaser as written."
"2","5","I made this for Easter and everyone raved about how good it was!! I didn't change anything in the recipe and it came out great :)"
"2","5","Easy and Awesome!"
"2","5","This has become a holiday staple for my family. Year after year, everyone requests the 'pretty chocolate thing in the dish'. It is so easy to make. The desert itself is so rich and delectable."
"2","5","This dessert was so easy to make and was a very popular dish at my last gathering."
"2","5","This was very, very good. I made it for several potlucks and family get-togethers and I always bring the bowl home empty....The only minor substitute I used was to use mini chocolate chips as my garnish instead of shaving a chocolate bar. Awesome dessert!"
"2","4","I made this for Christmas with a few changes. Instead of fake whipped topping, I used real light whipped cream in the can and left off the top layer until serving. I also poured a little hazelnut liqueur over the brownies as I layered and used chocolate pudding that was already mixed up in containers for ease of prep. This was so easy, it turned out fabulous!"
"2","5","My family and in-laws loved this dessert! I did what others said and mixed the pudding with whipping cream rather than cool whip. It was wonderful! I will definitely make this again!"
"2","3","I definitely agree that it was very 'processed' tasting, like another cook said. But I guess, what should I expect? Lol! Anyway, if you're used to processed foods, I'm sure it's fantastic. For those who aren't, I would at least advise homemade whipped cream (REALLY easy) and pudding."
"2","4","Very simple to make and a crowd pleaser."
"2","5","I didn't have brownies so I did it with chocolate cake. It was delish!!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe except for making my own whipped cream (as many others suggested). I also added some fresh rasberries to the top! It is a very 'classy' dessert that is perfect for any occasion!"
"2","5","This was a big hit at a potluck party. It is very sweet, but it seems most people like it that way."
"2","3","I omitted condensed milk, used a tablespoon of caramel topping spread over the cake before cutting, and subbed heavy whipping cream for cool whip. Used Heath chips as suggested. However, the serving size was ENORMOUS..i could not even fit half a cake in my trifle despite multiple layers. Best for a big party, and even then, it's so filling it still may not get finished. I like the flavor but in a house with only six people, i know it will get wasted :(( Ingredient cost: cake mix 1.79, 3 eggs 0.60, caramel topping 2.09 jar (0.20 in recipe), pudding 0.65, heavy cream 1.89, heath chips 2.49 (0.50 in recipe). Total cost: $5.63 for recipe/$8.91 for full size ingredients."
"2","5","I made this this for a chruch gathering. everyone loved it! i now bring it in all the time! its really good."
"2","4","wonderful! the entire family loved it...a new favorite! makes a big batch, perfect to have for guests or take to a party..."
"2","5","First time I've ever made a trifle and it turned out amazing! It was the only desert touched at our family Christmas. I added fresh raspberries on top and people really liked that tartness to break up the sweet. I also used Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 20oz brownies and not one person could tell the difference. They said the brownies were perfect!"
"2","5","My family LOVED it! We used instant chocolate fudge pudding mix and chopped Heath bar bits on top. Yummy!"
"2","4","Made for Christmas dessert fellowship for our Sunday school class. Very good, a bit rich. Next time I will make without sweetened condensed milk to cut down on the super sweetness."
"2","5","This is the best. I have people asking for it over and over."
"2","5","I took this trifle to a church potluck, and like many of you had lots of rave reviews. I did make a few tweaks. To save time, I purchased brownies from the bakery department at my grocery store. I followed the suggestions for adding freshly whipped cream to the pudding mix and layered with plain whipped cream. But, to add a holiday twist I sprinkled crushed peppermint sticks on the plain whipped cream and toffee bits on the chocolate whipped cream layer."
"2","5","Simply amazing! I have made this many times and always get compliments and am always asked for the recipe. delicious!"
"2","3","I made a double batch of this recipe, using Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate brownie mix from Costco. Even after 2 days, the brownie didn't soak up moisture from the pudding and whipped cream. The pudding was too sweet and the brownie was too dry... perhaps chocolate cake would have worked better."
"2","5","This was super easy - and the dish was practically licked clean! A huge hit."
"2","2","A bit too sweet and artificial tasting for me. Husband didn't care for it, either. I had leftovers I eventually threw away."
"2","5","Hosted party then found my husband eating it for breakfast the next morning ~ everyone loved it. Few adjustments: Mixed pudding, water & sweetened condensed milk then in separate bowl whipped 1/2 pt heavy cream... then folded in the cream w/the pudding mixture. Layered brownies, caramel syrup, heath toffee bits, choc. whipped cream, then cool whip & repeated. Options: substitue baileys for water... add strawberries to toffee layer??"
"2","5","After making the One Bowl Brownie recipe from this site and attempting to broil some marshmallows on top of it in the oven and starting an oven fire which nearly amounted to an apartment fire, I had to find a way to salvage the brownies when voila!---I came upon this wonderful recipe. It was quick, easy, and you can really add anything to it that you want. I topped mine with chopped almond rocca sitting around which gave it the perfect crunch. I could practically eat the chocolate pudding on its own =). Next time, I will drizzle caramel on top of the brownies (which I completely forgot to do the first time). What a happy ending to a horrible brownie story!"
"2","5","My family LOVED this recipe. It didn't last more than a day and everyone is already begging me to make it again. The only thing I will change next time, is that I will crumble the brownies instead of cutting them into squares."
"2","5","This has been a family favorite for years! To break up the sweetness of the chocolate, I had a thick layer of fresh sliced strawberries in between the two layers. It not only tastes amazing but looks beautiful with a layer of red in the center. I also sprinkle the top with the heath bar pieces sold in the Chocolate chip section of the grocery store. Great Recipe!"
"2","4","I made this to bring to a cookout and it was a huge hit! A lot of other reviewers found the pudding mix too sweet, but I have a huge sweet tooth and thought it was fine. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wasn't a huge fan of using brownies. I've made trifles before and usually use chocolate cake, which I prefer. The edges of the brownies were a bit tough compared to the rest of the textures. Edges could be cut off, but then there wouldnt be enough brownie for the dessert and 2 boxes would probably need to be used. Other than that, delish!"
"2","5","This is a delicious recipe. I did refrigerate the pudding mixture before layering to make it less runny, which makes the layers look neater. I also included sliced strawberries and toffee chips on top of the pudding layer. It was absolutely yummy!"
"2","5","This was FANTASTIC! it looks pretty too! I did take somebodys advice and instead of putting cool whip in with the pudding i whipped 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream and used that instead. it was really creamy and i could tell it made a difference. my boyfriend doesnt even really like sweets, but he LOVED this. this will be a regular."
"2","4","This is soooo good. It is awfully sweet thou, 1/2 cup serving per person is good I'd say. Next time I'll use sugar free puddings & cool whip. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","4","I hate when people review a recipe based on the alterations they made to it. I made this exactly as written and while it was SUPER sweet for me, I got rave reviews! I think if I make it again, I wouldn't make the pudding with the evaporated milk or might try making my own whipped cream."
"2","5","awesome!"
"2","5","I make this for small group events all the time. Everyone loves it and request it by name. I had to buy a second trifle dish. I changed the recipe and I don't use sweetened condensed milk. I follow the instant pudding mix directions and use real milk. I often sprinkle heath bar on top, or m &ms depending on the season."
"2","5","This recipe is so delicious. I have tried it with pudding and also with whipped cream. Both ways it was very good. I cannot wait to make it again."
"2","5","My husband LOVES this!! I use real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip as the flavor is so much better Also, use a good quality brownie mix, or make your own. I made this several times over the summer and it is always a hit. How can you go wrong with Brownies, chocolate and cream?!?!"
"2","5","All I can say is amazing... I drooled over it when I first tasted it and then decided to make it for a school function. It was a HUGE hit to say the least..."
"2","5","I used someone elses suggestion of layering brownies, carmel, heath toffey bits, pudding mixture, and whipped cream. It was very good. I mixed the pudding and water, then whipped in 1/2 pint heavy cream instead of stiring in whipped cream. I have a large trifle bowl, so I had to use 2 boxes of pudding and 1 pint of heavy cream. It was gone so quickly I didn't even get any, but everyone enjoyed it very much."
"2","5","Yummy recipe. I accidentally bought a chocolate cake mix instead of brownies and still came out great."
"2","5","This recipe is fantastic for chocolate lovers! I did as several others had suggested and added caramel topping. Yum! I could eat just the chocolate layer straight out of the bowl, but its worth it to put the whole dessert together!"
"2","5","How can you not give this five stars?"
"2","5","When I want to impress someone I make this dessert! I use brownies with chocolate chunks in them already for more chocolate, and I chop up strawberries (fresh or frozen) and put them in there!"
"2","5","So Good! I also used the vanilla cool whip, and subbed Irish cream for water. Rich chocolately and fantastic! Super easy to make."
"2","5","Wow! This was really yummy and so very easy. The only thing I changed was I made homemade whipped cream instead of using cool whip. Thanks!"
"2","5","Heaven for sure...I added Heath Bar Crunch to the recipe...Everyone I have served it to asked for the recipe"
"2","2","Way too sweet!! This looks pretty, but isn't very good. The only thing that made the taste was the brownies. I am so surprised that so many rave about this recipe. Maybe if you made it with a mousse instead of pudding & sweetened condensed milk. If you want to try this at all, don't add any sweetened condensed milk!"
"2","5","This is a great and easy recipe! I did change a few things, as per other's suggestions (and some of my own). First, instead of using brownies, I used leftover 'Too much chocolate cake' (a recipe from this site). Then I had frozen raspberries that I had picked over the summer. I put those in a bowl with some sugar. As the berries unthawed it created a raspberry syrup. I drizzled this syrup over each layer of cake. For the pudding mixture, I made my own whipped cream to add in instead of the cool whip. I beat 1 cup of heavy cream, 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar, and a splash of vanilla (and then folded it in). For the cool whip layers, I used french vanilla. Then, right before I served it, I strategically placed the raspberries on top. Not only did it taste great, but it looked amazing too!"
"2","5","Mmm! This was such a decadent recipe that was easy to prepare. Followed the directions pretty straight forward. The only thing I changed was I used fresh whipped cream instead of whipped topping; not a fan of cool whip. I decided to use Heath bars between the layers for an added crunch."
"2","5","Made this for a family who just came home with a new baby. BIG BIG hit and I had to send her the recipe. I'd make this over and over again with my Pampered Chef trifle bowl, it can also be very pretty to serve"
"2","5","yummy fudgy goodness!!!"
"2","5","I followed all the reviewers suggestions and it still came out too sweet and sticky. I made the pudding with the sweetened condensed milk and regular milk first, then blended it with whipped heavy cream. I also used caramel over the brownies and toffee bits and french vanilla cool whip. Next time I will SKIP the caramel and reduce the condensed milk by half and use regular cool whip. Sorry but the toffee bits have to stay... Then it will be just right! Otherwise what a beautiful dish!"
"2","5","This was excellent! The only changes that I made was to make home made brownies. I made brooks best bombshell brownies from this site and to use real whip cream not the artificial stuff. I did not add sugar to the whip cream that I folded into to pudding because of the sugar in the pudding mix and the sweetened condensed milk. It was perfect. Not to sweet My guest loved it and ate it up and took doggy bags."
"2","1","did not like the recipe at all..I did everything that it said and for some reason the mixture cam out really thin.. not sure why but I was very upset.. not sure what everyone else did but this is not the best recipe that I have ever had."
"2","5","Yumm! Great recipe thanks!"
"2","5","Need to rename this 'A diabetic coma waiting to happen! *LOL* As with others I 'trifled' with this recipe. (Do you think that is where the term originated?) I did make my own whipped cream to mix with the pudding as suggested, drizzled the brownie layer with caramel topping, and layered Heath toffee bits between the chocolate and white cream layer. I did intend to buy the French vanila whipped topping, but my store didn't carry it. So here is my own twist on this recipe! I added praline liqueur to the Cool Whip and beat it. Oh my, it was PERFECT with the caramel and toffee. To a 16 oz container I only added 6 'bottle cap' fulls, so no one is going to leave in a stupor as a result of the alcohol. Cool Whip never tasted so good!"
"2","5","Amazing!!! Made for X-Mas Eve & everyone loved it! Some said that it was the best they ever had. Followed other suggestions and used french vanilla cool whip and choc cool whip instead of the reg flavor. Crushed up 2 to 3 Heath bars and put in between layers. Added a great crunch! Could put 4 to 5 reg sized bars depending on preference to the taste of Heath. Would definately make again!"
"2","5","After tasting the pudding mixture, I decided I wanted more chocolate flavor, so I whipped up another box of chocolate pudding in a seperate bowl using only 1 cup of milk and folded it into the pudding mixture. I think next time, I will add the caramel and toffee bits as another reviewer suggested. But I think 2 boxes of pudding with extra milk definitely improves it. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!"
"2","5","I have made this so many times and it continues to be my most requested item. You can play with the ingredients a little - add drizzled caramel in between layers, add chopped toffee bits or mini chocolate morsels - whatever you have on hand. Delicious!"
"2","4","Super easy to make and tasted great - lots of compliments at our holiday party!"
"2","5","We just made this dessert for a Christmas dinner, and no one could get enough! a few minor revisions: we used real whipping cream like many others suggested as well as toffee pieces on top of both pudding mixture layers, and we also added a small layer of raspberries... we can't wait to make this again soon! thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","We just had our x-mas party with a bunch of friends of ours and it was a big hit!!! I even heard someone say that it was like eating a piece of heaven. I did change it up a little. I did follow some of the suggestion here. Thanks for a great recipe will do this one again."
"2","5","Awesome bowl of delicousness!! I forgot to buy a chocolate bar...or I ate it on the way home! Instead of chocolate shavings, I used those heath bar chips that I always have on hand! ;) Other than that...made it just like the recipe...LOVED it! So did my kids, of course, and my dinner guests!"
"2","5","I had some left over home made chocolate cake and I took it to work today and it was a huge hit. I followed as per recipe, no modifications necessary. I just crumbled a pack of oreo cookies on top with 3 cherries. I'm all about pesentation. Everybody says it was wonderful. I don't know who said this was sweet but 17 people can't be wrong. I will defintely make this again in the very near future because I still have some more chocolate cake in the fridge. I think will make a one for my sister.  THIS WAS MAGNIFICENT ! Need I saw more."
"2","5","This was a big hit at a employer cook off competition, and won 1st place for deserts.. :) Thank you!"
"2","5","This recipe is great!! I made this recipe for my coworkers and I had no complaints about the sweetness. There is no need to make your own whipped topping--the ready made brand is just fine. I made the recipe as written with just a few tweaks. Instead of a whole can of condensed milk I added about 2/3. Also, I added mini chocolate chips after the first layer of whipped topping and heath bar bits on the top layer. Other than that I followed the written recipe and it was perfect!"
"2","5","OMG! This was so good and so easy to make! I made it for a kids/moms playdate and was asked to make it next time too!"
"2","5","Wonderful! I made it for a family dinner and there were no leftovers! I used 1 large hersey's symphony bar (chopped) instead of the plain chocolate, and added on top of each pudding layer."
"2","5","this was great! i almost had to fight my boyfriend for the last bowl. cut up some mini snickers bars and put it on the brownie layer. also followed some of the reviews and didn't use as much whipped cream. will defiantly make again!"
"2","5","OMG is all I have to say... This was sinfully delicious. if you are a chocolate lover this will do the trick."
"2","5","I used 1/2C of coffee instead of water in the pudding, and whipped 1/2 pint of cream to mix into the pudding mixture. Used a chunk brownie mix, and this turned out decadent! It had about 10 hours in the fridge before serving, but it was better the following day. I suggest making it a day ahead. Also, it was very sweet, I couldn't imagine making the whole thing with cool whip. Next time I make this I'll mix in real whipped cream with cool whip for the white layer to take the sugary edge off. Great recipe, it's a keeper with those modifications."
"2","3","a little sweet"
"2","5","This was fantastic and yet so simple to make. The only thing I changed was I made my own brownies instead of a mix. This was gobbled up fast!"
"2","5","I decided to make this for a work potluck. My husband (who is the choc. lover of us) made me promise to bring some home. Well I had to fight just to get a bowl saved for him. IT was wonderful and so easy to make. Thank you for a great trifle recipe."
"2","5","I made this for a dinner party i had... a friend with generally good manners literally licked the plate! although a little too sweet for me, at the next party I went too, someone asked me if I had brought 'that dessert'. Pretty easy to make. I used the godiva chunky brownie mix."
"2","5","Oh- SO GOOD! I brought it to a group dinner and everyone was fighting over it. I have been asked to bring it to the next dinner already! It would have been perfect exactly according to the recipe, but I added just a few things for my own personal taste. I used brownies with chocolate chips in them, I crumbled the brownie rather than cut into squares, on top of the layer of brownies I drizzled a little caramel sauce, then on the top of the last layer of whipped cream I added crumbled Heath bar pieces. YUM!"
"2","4","Good but a little too rich for my tastes."
"2","5","Delicious ! Followed recipe exactly except that I made the brownies from the Best Brownie recipe from this site. Was just as good if not better the next day. Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
"2","5","Very, very good. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and made real pudding instead of instant and also made real whipped cream. I also made 2 batches of turtle brownies. This turned out great! Everyone loved it."
"2","5","This dessert is AWESOME. I made it for a family party. I don't cook much but found it on this site. It is so easy and so delicious. Everyone loved it and was going back for 2nd's (including me!). It was kind of like French Silk Pie with brownies. I used mini chocolate chips on top instead of shavings. It was easier and looked as nice. Highly recommended!!"
"2","3","I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I even used real whipped cream and it still wasn't that great. I am not a big fan of jello pudding so that may be the problem. The jello just made it taste fakey, if that makes any sense."
"2","3","This was WAY too sweet for us, but I think it could be excellent with a few changes. Next time I'll try either using fresh whipped cream instead of the whipped topping, or use regular milk in the pudding mix instead of condensed milk (skip the water). It needs something to cut the sugar! My husband loved it, though!"
"2","5","A friend of mine made this for a dessert for a birthday party and it was excellent."
"2","5","This only gets five stars with my adjustments. I made the chocolate stuff exactly the way the recipe said with cool whip, instant pudding and condensed milk and thats exactly how it tasted, very artificial. So I threw it in the garbage. Then I made my own home made chocolate pudding from scratch [canadian living recipe very easy] and covered the brownies with that and then real whip cream. I also used scor bits and it was excellent. I did not mix any of the whip cream in the pudding. I tried it with a small amount and the pudding was better all by itself with cream on top. This in not low calorie for sure but good."
"2","5","Everyone loved this. I left out the sweetened condensed milk COMPLETELY...that would be too sweet. So, I just made the pudding as directed on the box (w/ 2 cups milk) and then mixed in the Cool Whip as directed. I actually ended up not having enough Cool Whip to do 2 layers of the plain Cool Whip - so you may need more. Oh, and I used Ghirardelli brownie mix; make sure you make chewy brownies, the cakey kinds would be too crumby and fall apart."
"2","4","Can't eat more than just a tiny bit of it, but it's fantastic and easy!"
"2","5","I made this recipe for a family get together and even those who generally don't eat dessert gobbled this up. I made just a few changes, 1st I used fat free Eagle brand milk and since I hate cool whip I subbed real whipping cream. I didn't add any sugar to the cream when I beat it and I am so glad that I didn't because it would have been tooo sweet! It was the perfect balance. I also drizzled Hershey's syrup over the brownie layers which I undercooked by just a few minutes. They were gooey and delicious. My DH has added this to his list of favorite recipes."
"2","5","What a wonderful and easy dessert recipe! I made it for a family gathering and it was a show stopper. I have made this twice, the first time I made it as described except that I added some vanilla extract to the coolwhip to make it taste a little more homemade. The second time I made it using bannana pudding mix. Yummy!"
"2","5","This was a hit. I took others advice and used heavy cream that I whipped to mix in with the pudding. I also added a couple of 'rows' of strawberries which was great. I couldn't find toffee chips, so I ground up Skor bars and that worked great, Oreo cookies gound up would be good too. I did layer carmel over the brownies, but not before they baked, I'll try that next time. I used a chunk brownie mix and forgot to put the first layer of actual cool whip so it didn't look as nice as it could, but this isn't really meant to look pretty as the main feature is it tastes AWESOME! Took to a church function and everybody was asking for the recipe. I made the night before and it sat in the fridge for almost 20 hours and was great. Need a heavy spool to serve it with. It's not pretty but the taste is killer!"
"2","5","okay, this recipe took some work to get it the way i wanted but in the end it was well worth it. I am always reluctant to made trifles as i don't like cool whip or instant pudding. After reading many reviews from people who had used real whipped cream instead of cool whip i decided to try it and also used cooked pudding. The whipping cream does not need sugar added as the sweet milk and pudding is plenty sweet.I made caramel sauce to pour over the brownies as suggested by others. I'm sure the real cream and pudding will separate before too long but no worries as this trifle is so good i'm sure it won't last long!"
"2","5","Oh my gosh, this is heavy, but SOOO good! I used homemade brownies (Best Brownies on allrecipes.com...my all-time favorite recipe!) I agree with the reviewer who stated to put something chunky into the brownies (I used cooking reeces pb cups...chocolate chunks would work well too). I also used light everything (milk and cool whip), but like others have suggested, I made my own whipped cream using whipping cream for the middle layer. This is good!! Hubby and I both really enjoyed it!"
"2","4","this was so easy, my husband and little boys made this for me. next time I will just make the pudding straight and fold in the cool whip because I think the sweetened condensed milk was way too sweet, probably would be great with just half a can of sweetened condensed milk. overall a very yummy recipe. we added some crushed oreos inbetween the pudding layer and the cool whip layer, extra yum"
"2","5","So easy and delicious."
"2","5","I made this for a memorial wake for a friend of mine and the it was the first thing gone off the dessert table! I used regular Cool Whip to mix with the chocolate pudding and milk, and I used Cool Whip Lite for the layers between. I also used a dark chocolate brownie mix from Duncan Hines. I think those two changes made it a touch less sweet but it was still plenty sweet enough! Sprinkled semi-sweet mini chocolate chips on top and it was beautiful and delicious! Definitely going into my regular dessert for company rotation!"
"2","5","I made this chocolate trifle for a party last weekend. Everybody loved it! I made the brownies from the scratch. I also follow some people advice to only use 1/3 cup of sweet condensed milk instead of the whole can. I also made my own whip cream because the prepared one in the store is too sweet. The bottom line is everybody love it! It's chocolate but yet it's not too sweet. I believe if you follow the original recipe, it might have been way too sweet for me."
"2","5","FABULOUS! I borrowed a few other ideas. I made my own whipped cream to add to the chocolate pudding mixture. I used 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream and put it in my mixer on high until I thought the consistency was sufficient. I also used the french vanilla whipped topping for the middle and top of the trifle. I made this for Easter and everybody RAVED about it!"
"2","5","Loved it! I made it for a party, everyone was so impressed! It was gone, instantly."
"2","5","I followed others and used whip cream. I also add a layer of fresh raspberries after the cream layer and also on top around the edge on the last cream layer. In addition, I add coffee liquer on each brownie piece ~2cups for one trifle bowl...do I need to say more?"
"2","5","This trifle is delicious. We all loved it. The perfect 'need a chocolate fix desert'"
"2","5","I first made this delicious dessert last spring for my daughter, her prom date and several other couples going to prom (we hosted a progressive dinner and I made desserts). It was such a big hit. It looked fantastic in the trifle bowl and tasted out of this world! I have made it a couple times since then for get togethers and receive so many compliments on it. I do use the brownie mix with chocolate chunks! For special occasions this is definitely a great treat!!!"
"2","5","This is truly death by chocolate. Everyone loved this when I made it for a family gathering. I drizzled caramel topping lightly over each layer of the brownie's before finishing the layers. Then on top, I sliced strawberries and placed them on top with the chocolate shavings, and then drizzled a little more caramel for the finishing touches. I also used the brownies with the walnuts in them."
"2","5","Amazing Recipe!! The one thing that I add, because of the peanut butter lovers in my house, is alternating layers between brownies and crushed Reese's Peanut Butter cups."
"2","5","This is hands down the Best Chocolate Trifle. We added Butterfinger candy bar pieces on the top for a nice finished look. We made it in individual dessert dishes, looked beautiful and tasted fantastic! Thanks for the great and versatile recipe."
"2","2","I gave this recipe 2 stars mostly because it is so quick and easy to make. But it is incredibly thick and heavy. Also, I like a more traditional trifle that has a spongier cake that can absorb the flavors."
"2","5","This was an excellent recipe! I too whipped 1/2 pint of whipping cream with 3 Tblsp of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla. I then added this to the sweetened condensed/pudding mixture. I also spooned caramel sauce over the brownies, added chocolate chunks and heath bar. This was rich but delicious! Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","I love this trifle cuz it's CHOCOLATE!!!! When I made it, I used chocolate candy pieces suchs as m&m's, snicker bites, kit kats, oreos, hershey's milk chocolate bars. I layered it first the cake, candy, mousse and whipped cream and continued to layered it til I reached to the top. The toplayer was chocolate mousse and all the extra candies and oreos. It was the best I had ever made."
"2","5","I made this for a bachelorette party and everyone loved it. The next day the groom, best man, and minister split the leftovers. I added 2 Tb. instant coffee granules to the brownie batter, which gave the dessert a deeper flavor to compliment the sweetness. On top I shaved milk & dark chocolate for an eye-pleasing presentation."
"2","5","Excellent dessert recipe; it's so easy & delicious! I've made it for 3 functions so far & every single time I'm asked for the recipe & everyone raves about it! I've made it with both regular milk & with the sweetened condensed milk & also with bought Cool Whip & homemade cool whip; the substitutions made no difference, they still came out great! My only tip is to have some extra Cool Whip on hand; because the mouth of my bowl is much wider than the base, I find out that I use a bit more. Great Recipe!!!"
"2","5","WOW. Thanks for the recipe as good as it looks."
"2","3","I used Ghiradelli Brownie mix. After breaking up the pieces I poured some caramel topping over them. I used a 5 oz package of cooked pudding for the pudding layer. To give it a deeper chocolate flavor, I added a tablespoon of chocolate powder to it and after I took it off the heat I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of butter. I cut the pudding with home make whipped cream and also used home made whipped cream for the 'white' layer instead of using cool whip. I used a vegetable peeler to shave a chocolate bar on the topmost layer for garnish. These alterations to the pudding layer are a must to give the pudding a richer more developed flavor.  WARNING: You have to use an actual trifle bowl. Do not make the mistake I made and use a large salad bowl that looks like a trifle bowl but holds much more volume. I had to double the recipe to try to reach the top of the bowl and the kitchen now looks like a cyclone hit it.  I don't know how this dessert is going to be received so I will update this review tomorrow morning. Fingers crossed.  UPDATE: This will satisfy the undeveloped palates of children and adore-anything-chocolate lovers. It is NOT amazing by any means. It tastes like pudding with brownies and whipped cream. If you are aiming to impress more erudite palates, look elsewhere."
"2","5","This is so rich and wonderful. However, I think I'm going to double the recipe next time so it makes better layers."
"2","5","This is really good for what it is, but make sure you read the changes people suggested because that'll reduce the fake-ness (i.e. use real whipping cream in place of some of the cool whip). I made this for my chocoholic dad for father's day. My dad absolutely loved the mousse part and it was easy to do--great results for not a lot of work."
"2","5","This was awesome! Very sweet but that's what dessert is all about. I loved the chewy brownies. I added skor bits on top and carmel syrup to the layers. Everyone loved it! Wonderful!"
"2","5","I made this last night for a scrapbooking party, and by the time I left, it was the ONLY dessert completely gone. Everyone just raved over it! The only thing I changed was that I mixed up a pint of whipping cream, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/3 cup sugar and used that in place of all the Cool Whip. I think it might have been too sweet with Cool Whip. It was a BIG hit, so I will definitely be making it again! Next time I'm going to add some chopped pecans for crunch."
"2","5","This dessert is sooooo good and definately deserving of all the high reviews. I actually used mint chocolate pudding (it was what I had) but will try with half chocolate/ half cheesecake next time....you really can't go wrong with this; however, I did have to make a few changes. First I folded whipping cream into the pudding instead of whipped topping. Then, for the whipped topping I folded in 8 ounces softened cream cheese, about 6 ounces powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (mixed together)into the topping before spreading. I did this because I wanted to avoid a strong cool whip taste (a common complaint of other reviews). The finished product was fantastic! Just make sure you serve this to a large group because it's very tempting to eat it all yourself."
"2","5","Good with toffee bits sprinkled over the creamy layers. You can also sprinkle the brownie with a bit of kahlua."
"2","4","This recipe was very easy to make! It's definitely the perfect dessert to feed a crowd!"
"2","5","This was amazing! I made it with whipping cream instead of cool whip and I used homemade brownies. I also topped it with raspberries. It was almost too pretty to eat! Lots of compliments. SO GOOD!"
"2","5","This was fabulous! Extremely rich - Definitely add some fruit (yummy strawberries!) and I followed suggestions on here and used real whipping cream. Great for potlucks!"
"2","5","Awesome dessert!"
"2","5","This was gone in minutes! And I was asked to make it again twice w/in 2 weeks. I also like to make it w/ variations of candy bars & fruit like strawberries or bananas."
"2","5","This is an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things. I added extra layers of cheesecake pudding which was mixed with a little cool whip. I also sprinkled Heath Toffee Bits on top of cheesecake pudding layer and on top of finished product. This is even better the next day."
"2","5","When I first came across this recipe, it really didnt sound like anything to special to me...but my boyfriend really wanted me to make it so I gave in.. and boy was i wrong.. this dessert was AWESOME!   I porued half a bottle of caramel over the first brownie layer and topped the whole thing off with some crushed heath bar and it was perfect! Also, it tastes MUCH better the next day (the brownies soften up) so if you are making it for a special occasion I reccomend that you do it a day ahead of time...Im sure I will be making this one again!"
"2","4","This is definitely NOT for people watching their weight! (me). You only need a small portion because it is so sweet - and this is coming from a sweets lover! It's very delicious but I'm positive I could feel my waist expanding with every spoonful."
"2","5","This recipe was hands-down the best dessert my office has ever had! The presentation was great and the comments that I received included 'down right ridiculous'! I added a layer of strawberries on the first layer of cool-whip and crushed heath bar on top. Thank you!"
"2","5","YUM!!! Made it as directed and it was fabulous!!!! Best to make it a day ahead. I made mid-morning and served it for dessert after supper, but it was better the next day (breakfast, hehe)"
"2","5","Very good! I used a half pint of whipping cream, whipped, instead of cool whip in the pudding layer. I do recommend letting it chill for 8 hours like the recipe states. I tried some after only a couple hours and it was much better the longer it chilled. Also, I found that grating the chocolate bar on top was kind of a hassle, so next time I will probably just use mini chocolate chips or sprinkles or something."
"2","5","This is to-die-for. Talk about RICH! Chocolate lovers go ga-ga over this recipe - I get asked for it when I make it for guests. I love everything about it and wouldn't change a thing!"
"2","5","WOW!!!!!!! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST DESSERT EVER!!"
"2","5","Oh my goodness. This was awesome. I made this for a birthday party at work....It was gone in a matter of minutes. I made a few changes based on previous comments. I replaced the water with Kahlua and replaced the sweeten condensed milk with regular milk. I'm a big fan of homemade whipped cream, so I used that also.  Great idea. Thank you!!!!"
"2","4","Would definitely make again, but just a little too sweet. Also, make sure you make good, moist, chewy brownies for this dish. thanks for the recipe"
"2","3","Way way way too ridiculously rich and sweet for most of mine and my families tastes. The real sweet tooth of the family enjoyed it though. After reading over the other reviews I decided to use heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip and still found it too sweet for my taste. As stated by another reviewer, it's nothing special and does just taste like a bunch of pre-packaged ingredients. Will definitely not be making it again.  --Edit: Wow sort of surprising but I have changed my mind about this desert after letting it sit in the fridge for almost 2 days. The flavors seem to have mellowed some and now blend together much better and I do actually enjoy it. Still will not go into my regular rotation but it was an enjoyable desert after allowing it to sit for quite a while."
"2","5","Fantastic!!! I added Baileys to the whipcream/pudding mix and cut the brownies into squares. You HAVE to refrigerate it for a very long time--it was ok the first night, but delicious the next day. Heaven."
"2","4","It was really good I made it for a party and the next day 4 people called to ask for the recipe. I used brownie bites rather that make my own brownines. I refrigerated it for only 2 hours and it tasted great. But next time I think I will use real whipping cream for the layering part, I am not a big fan of whipped topping."
"2","4","This was good but I could only eat a little bit, it was very sweet/rich...and I'm a chocoholic!! I would use a simple brownie with it (not one that has anything added to it, will just make it too sweet if you do). The presentation was very nice."
"2","5","So easy, quick and delicious!!! I ran out of time around the holidays and made up a recipe of this sinfully rich dessert to take to a party. As a result of my procrastination, I modified it a little - I used whipped cream in place of the frozen whipped topping (I didn't have time to wait for it to defrost - something to keep in mind for next time). Since I didn't have time to bake brownies, I cut up one and a half bags of store bought 'two bite brownies'. I also added some skor baking bits between the whipped cream and brownie layers, and on top. I did replace the sweetened condensed milk with whole and skim milk after reading some of the suggestions on this site. It was still so good!! I got many compliments on this recipe."
"2","5","THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! MADE IT FOR MY NEW YEAR'S DINNER, AND IT WAS A HIT!!!DIDN'T CHANGE A THING!"
"2","5","Fabulous recipe. I got many compliments. I changed it slightly. I used Lite Coolwhip and sugarfree pudding instead. I also added sliced bananas to the side of the bowl in the coolwhip layers. I will save this recipe. Thanks"
"2","4","I made this dessert as the finishing touch of our nontraditional Christmas dinner. It was a little too sweet for our taste. Even my three daughters thought is was pretty rich and they are little chocoholics. I think that this is a great base recipe and will add layers of fresh strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries (or maybe all three!) to try to balance the overwhelming richness of this dessert the next time I make it. Thank you for the great recipe!!!!"
"2","5","This trifle is great! Very easy and always a crowd pleaser."
"2","4","It would have been way too sweet for us if I had followed the recipe, so I followed the review advice, thank you everyone. In the pudding mix I replaced the cool-whip with whipped heavy cream unsweetened (since the sweetened condensed milk is sweet enough) and added a tablespoon of instant coffee to the water. Taste it, if you need more sugar add. I also used whipped heavy cream slightly sweetened with powdered sugar for the whipped cream layers and added a sprinkle of crushed Heath/Scor bar on top. Letting it set up makes it better. You can play with this one!"
"2","5","Excellent dessert! Don't change a thing! Received rave reviews from my Christmas guests."
"2","5","I just won a dessert contest with this trifle ... I have made it many times and everyone always loves it. Not only is this delicious, but it's easy too!"
"2","4","This recipe was a big hit! i made some thick and creamy custard to use instead of the cream though and topped with cherries."
"2","4","very delicious but almost a little too rich with the condensed milk. also it's best when all of it is served immediately (once the brownies become soggy it's not as good)"
"2","5","This recipe is awesome. I have had it with both cake and brownies. If you love chocolate this is the one for you. This is both easy to prepare and impressive looking. I like using 2-3 broken-up toffee bars instead of the plain chocolate. But I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe. It's a no-brainer"
"2","5","This was fantastic! It always gets rave reviews at my husband's work. I make it the night before so that it can set up overnight. I like to use a Hershey's Symphony bar, chopped up, for the candy. Beware..this is a very rich dessert. Keep the serving sizes small!"
"2","5","Yep, I took this to a church function and had many requests for the recipe. I do not know how it tasted because it was gone before I had a chance to try it! I followed the recipe but used toffee chocolates pieces instead of a chocolate bar. Makes a pretty presentation in a trifle dish. Definitely a keeper."
"2","5","I was a little worried that this would be too sweet, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. My son said that it was awesome! This was simple to make and it also makes an impressive presentation. Definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","This is such an impressive dessert, it looks great and tastes wonderful! I use the Best Browinies recipe from this site in this recipe."
"2","5","This was great! My husband said it was the best dessert I have ever made. I also made it for a Bunco party and there was none left. I did add Heath Bar crumbles on top of the pudding layers and then on top of the entire trifle. It is a sin!!!"
"2","5","Fantastic recipe...it's the hit of the party! If you like chocolate and cool whip this is the desert for you!"
"2","5","My coworkers were very impressed with the presentation. I was impressed with how easy it was to make and how yummy it turned out. Thanks. Will definately make again and again."
"2","5","Really tasty and easy to make. It looks impressive. After reading the reviews, I did add 4 ounces of cream cheese to the pudding mixture to cut the sweetness. Next time I'll add the entire block (8 oz.) b/c the condensed milk makes this an incredibly sweet dessert."
"2","3","Good for chocolate lovers. I used Girahdeli brownie mix which I think put it over the top. I also made my own whipped cream. I probably would not make it again."
"2","1","Yuck! I used 4 oz. LESS whip cream than the recipe called for and it was still so sickly sweet with whip cream that we had to throw away the entire bowl. What a dissapointment!"
"2","4","Was yummy and our guests liked it. I think it was way too sweet, though (and I used unsweetened real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip). Next time I'd leave out the sweetened condensed milk and just make the chocolate layer out of whipped cream and melted chocolate (or maybe homemade pudding--not as sweet)."
"2","5","I made this for Christmas exactly as recipe states. My teenage boy cousins called this the dessert from heaven and my husband told me that I can make this anytime. Definately a keeper! I made this again but used fresh whipped cream. I didn't think it was possible to make this dessert any better, but OMG! It made the filling taste like a french silk, and it was divine!"
"2","5","I've been using this site for a while, but this is my first review. I made this for Christmas, and I must say to call it a hit is an understatement. I didn't change a thing about the recipe, and I did find it VERY sweet, but it was great for the chocoholic in me! I also noticed that after sitting in the fridge for another day or two, the sweet factor kinda wore off. Two words..simply delicious!"
"2","5","PERFECT !!!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","Fantastic, I used 6 heath bars and crushed them, put about three in the middle over the whipped topping and then the other 3 over the top. Everyone loved this! brought to a family reunion and should have tripled it! It was gone in 5 minutes!"
"2","5","hit with my guests, definitely a keeper. I used the suggestion of using whipping cream instead of the 8oz cool whip. Much better with the heavy whipping cream! I also would suggestions using a 9x9 pan or larger as I used a 8x8 pan and ran out of brownies. Very rich."
"2","5","I made this for Labor Day. I could have sworn I saw finger swirls left around the edges of the bowl. It was delicious!"
"2","4","Excellent recipie, I gave it 4 stars because I changed it around a bit. I added carmel to the brownies before they went in the oven. To keep it from being too sweet, I only used half of the sweetened condenced milk and used skim milk for the rest. For the same reason I did not use the cool whip for the pudding. I whipped 1/2 pint of heavy wipping cream to make my own cream and added that to the pudding. I also added heath bar topping to each pudding layer. This recipie was great this way. Next time it I will double the pudding, it definitly could have used more of it."
"2","3","I hate to be the party pooper, but I wasnt thrilled. It was good but VERY sweet and I used a boxed brownie which didnt absorb the pudding and cream and get all mucky like a traditional trifle would. It might be better with chocolate cake substituted for the brownie. Otherwise, it was just a brownie with pudding and cream on your plate."
"2","1","Far too sweet and rich for our family."
"2","4","Lovely presentation, definitely got the OOHS and AAHS people raved about but for me, it was WAY too sweet...next time I will make a homemade chocolate mousse for the layers and definitely heed the other reviewers and add something for texture..I opted for the crushed health bars and topped with chopped hazelnuts..that was yummy!!! Just overall too sweet."
"2","4","This was good but VERY rich! Even the hard core chocolate lovers in my family thought it was too rich. I drizzled carmel over the brownies before baking. I wish I wouldn't have. The carmalized topping made the brownies too hard. It definately pays to let it sit for 8 hours; which I didn't since I ran out of time."
"2","5","The first time I made this was for a Labor Day BBQ and it was delicious. I did use vanilla pudding instead of chocolate and added fresh strawberries to the layers. Today I'm making it for a book group and adding fresh rasberries instead. I also discovered this recipe gets a lot better with age. Thanks Wayne for a wonderful dessert."
"2","5","Awesome awesome awesome! I took this to a gathering last night and everyone raved about it - and I mean raved!"
"2","5","It was awesome! The brownies stayed nice and moist! One thing I did was I made the trifle into individual cups, ice tea glasses worked perfectly!"
"2","5","Truly heavenly! I used no-fat sweetened condensed milk and nofat whipped topping and it was excellent. Have plenty of milk to drink with this rich, delicious dessert!"
"2","5","I made this dessert for a house Christmas get-together and it was a huge hit. Everyone absolutley loved. I shaved just the chocolate part (not the green part)of Andes candies mints over the top of the whole thing and it worked out great. It added a little mint flavor that kept everyone guessing. I will make again and again!"
"2","5","I've made this numerous times and it always turns out wonderfully! I tried it using regular milk instead of sweetened condensed milk in the pudding and it wasn't as good. This recipe is wonderful! Yum..."
"2","5","I made this for a family Christmas Eve gathering and everyone just loved it! As my 5-year-old son said, it's yummerific. I sprinkled 2 crused Skor bars overtop of each whipped cream layer. I will make this again and again."
"2","5","I just made this for a birthday party at work and it was fabulous!! Everyone raved about it. I used dark chocolate brownies which cut down on the sweetness a bit. Also, I got almost twice the amount of servings out of it - it was so sweet that people didn't take as much. Definitely a winner!!"
"2","4","Very, very rich. Almost too sweet for us to enjoy. I may use low fat condensed milk & low fat whip cream next time to reduce sweetness. Thanks!"
"2","5","Very rich but very good!!! I used my own brownie recipe and used only half of the condensed milk called for replacing it with evaporated milk. I also used whipping cream to control the amount of sweetness in it. Overall a very indulging dessert!"
"2","5","One word - Yummylicious!!! I brought this to a BBQ served in a gigantic brandy glass (I sometimes use it for floating candles or flowers) and the reviews were nothing but positive. Brownies, pudding, candy - how can you go wrong?? Only thing different I did - used only half the condensed milk as the pudding and brownie mixes are sweet enough. Also cut down on whipped topping coz the hubby does not like it too much. I topped it with Terry's Chocolate Orange which I grated/chopped. Did I say yummylicious??!!?? 5 star for taste.. 4 star for ease as you do need to take time to put this altogether. Thanks!"
"2","5","Great dessert! Took to a family gathering and everyone raved about it. Did not make any changes to recipe . . . followed just as is and was fantastic!! Thank you!!"
"2","5","This was very delicious. Next time I make this I will use brownies with walnuts. Thanks for the recipe it was a hit."
"2","5","OMG! This was just the best. I did take the advise of other reviews and used Turtle Brownie Mix, real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip and added chopped pecans and carmel sauce - to make a Turtle Trifle. It filled up my whole trifle bowl and everybody enjoyed! No leftovers!"
"2","4","Awesome! I would add more brownies next time, and I also used mini chocolate chips instead of the chocolate shavings."
"2","5","Very scrumptious. I used a Turtle brownie mix and put some broken up caramel cruch bar ontop, and it turned out great."
"2","5","took to a party and it was all gone.....everyone was asking for the recipe. I will definitely make it again."
"2","5","I made this in fifty minutes (including brownie cooke time) for a cookout that evening. Everyone loved it!!! I had virtually no leftovers. Very rich, but so very much worth it. I forgot to buy a candy bar to add to the top, so I just sprinkled some chocolate chips on top. That looked great!"
"2","4","I made this for my daughter's bridal shower. Very rich but everyone loved it. I did use the crushed Heath bar on the top at my daughter's request."
"2","5","This was great! Every bite was eaten and my family has asked for it again."
"2","5","AWESOME! I usually prepare a fancy complicated dessert but had to try this. Rave reviews all around!!!! Made the brownies early in the day, assembled trifle at night and served next night. Even better the following day! No separation as others reported, maybe they used regular pudding or wrong milk. I blended milk,water and milk with hand held mixer.I probably used less in each coolwhip layer and added smashed Heath bar crumbs atop pudding layer. DO NOT LOSE THIS ONE!!!"
"2","5","VERY GOOD! This dessert is so fun and easy to prepare. My husband loves it and keeps a spoon in the dish for quick bites! Good dessert to bring to get togethers. I will make this one again! THANK YOU!!!"
"2","5","This is an absolute favorite among family gatherings. They always ask me to make this and it's ALWAYS the first to go. Definately a keeper!"
"2","5","This was great! Rich, yes, but great! Instead of messing with the chocolate shavings, I just sprinkled chocolate chips on top. Thanks!"
"2","3","I am generally a huge chocolate fan, but this recipe was almost too chocolaty for me. If I ever make it again, I might try adding a layer of homemade raspberry sauce to cut the sweetness a little. Or maybe add a butterscotch or caramel layer for a change of pace. It does look beautiful, however."
"2","5","yummy yummy yummmy...for chocolate lovers only!"
"2","5","A great recipe! I keep brownies in the freezer and all other ingredients on hand just in case I need to whip up this trifle. Delicious!"
"2","4","Very good and very easy!"
"2","5","this is a fantastic recipe and very easy to make."
"2","5","I took this to our monthly church 'potluck' and it was a hit! Had to do some creative substituting with ingredients I had on hand, and it still turned out great. Will definitly make this again. Thanks Wayne"
"2","5","This is soooo fantastic. Took it to the NASCAR kickoff race today and there wasn't a bite left! I added a layer of toffee bits to the middle and it was a nice touch. I made it the night before and took it the next day. It let the ingredients mesh together well. I had 3 people ask me for the recipe in the first 15 minutes! This one is a keeper!!!!"
"2","5","This is MARVELOUS! My company raved over it - it's beautiful and delicious. The only slight change I made was the addition of chopped pecans in the brownies. Thank you for sharing this keeper!"
"1","4","I followed the recipe exactly. It was wayyyy to sweet. It's a great simple dessert to make for last minute parties. Next time I will add toffee bits and I will use heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip layer to minimize the sweetness. The pudding/cool whip/condensed milk/water layer was pretty good and came out a bit mousse like! I let that portion cool for a bit before layering."
"1","5","I loved this- used the suggestion of making real whipped cream to add to the pudding mixture and vanilla cool whip. Everyone loved this. I also used milk instead of water and increased it to 3/4 cup. Next time I will actually probably use a little more milk. The pudding started to thicken a little too quickly as I layered it, but I did extra layers. Will definitely make this again."
"1","5","Made it with real whip instead, and added white chocolate chips and fresh strawberries to the top. If you don't have a trifle bowl, like me, try using wide mouth mason jars instead for personal-sized portions!"
"1","5","Great dessert for chocolate lovers!"
"1","5","Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.."
"1","5","I made this on a whim for a dinner party for which I was assigned the dessert. It was very pretty and very rich and chocolatey! Delicious! I made home made brownies which made it even better!!!!! Great recipe!"
"1","5","This was gone by the time I ran inside to use the bathroom and came back! I honestly never seen something devoured so quickly. Sinfully delicious!"
"1","5","OMG BEST DESSERT EVER! Made this for my school and family on Thanksgiving. People went insane over it! This is a HUGE hit with kids, I should know. The layers do get a little tedious though if you're making many individuals. Its so worth it! Be sure not to use a spongy or cake-like brownie mix. Fudgy is the best effect. Also, if you dont like going skimpy on the layers, make sure to get extra of everything. I had to start putting REALLY thin layers towards the end due to running out of ingrediants. But overall, AMAZING :D"
"1","5","This was so easy and so delicious. My 9 year old was making a family dinner and we picked this recipe for her dessert. She followed the instructions to a 't' with little help from me and it was a huge hit! We'll be making this again for sure!"
"1","3","I'm a dessert LOVER but found this dessert to be far too sweet."
"1","5","I make this quite often and everyone LOVES it! I substitute real sweetened whipped cream instead of Cool Whip and put crushed skor bar on top. It is deicious"
"1","4","This is a lovely desert and so easy to make! I will make this again with one change. I will use a dark chocolate mouse in lieu of the pudding and condensed milk."
"1","5","When I made this my friends and family gobbled it all up. There was none left!"
"1","4","Easy to make, attractive and tasty. I used leftover chocolate cake rather than making brownies, which made it even easier. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","4","Really liked this recipe. Added extra candy bar bits to the middle cool whip layer. Made a wonderful dessert for our BBQ. Thanks!"
"1","1","The pudding mix is so runny I don't dare pour it on the brownies for fear they'll turn soggy and mushy! It's also a very pale brown, not at all like chocolate pudding."
"1","5","I made this Trifle as one of two desserts for Easter dinner. I thought I made too much but it was all gone in a flash. Everyone remarked how good it was and swore there was chocolate mousse in it. For me, the best part was that I could make it the day before the dinner. I did add crushed Heath Bars to each layer to add some crunch."
"1","4","So good! I took others advice and made my own whipping cream so I could control the sweetness. Turned out perfect!! Mmm"
"1","5","A winner with my audience!!!!"
"1","5","My family loved..especially the older crowd who need a little softer food."
"1","5","This sounded so good, but I don't do sugar. After reading some reviews, I figured I could leave out the condensed milk, and use Pillsbury Sugar Free Brownie Mix, Jell-O Sugar Free Chocolate Pudding Mix, Smuckers S.F. Caramel Topping, pecans, and real whipping cream, all of which I had on hand. I brought it to a church lunch today where there were about 8 desserts and a sugar-free cake. My sugar free chocolate turtle trifle was completely gone before 95% of the other desserts were touched. I know most of those people didn't need sugar free, but ate it anyway. The pastor had two helpings. If I'd have known, I would have warned him about the side effects of Splenda. Bet he had quite a lot of intestinal discomfort this afternoon and evening. I'll make it regular and sugar free for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Yum."
"1","5","Delicious. I use heath bar instead of regular chocolate bar, and instead of cool whip I use real whipped cream."
"1","5","This is so easy and delicious. I almost double the brownie recipe though. People always ask for this recipe and there are never left overs...GREAT recipe!"
"1","4","This was very good for a sweet tooth. It could get a little too sweet if eaten in big portions ( at least for me), but preparing these in little glass cups and having them was yummy. :) This is a keeper."
"1","5","This was a hit at my family reunion the only thing I would change in my of the pudding mixture. I would double it."
"1","5","Every time I make this dessert, it disappears. I love this recipe."
"1","5","Literally the BEST trifle recipe out there. I have used this in so many ways, it's unbelievable! It's so easy to adapt to whatever you're in the mood for."
"1","5","So good! I followed other reviewers suggestions about using heavy cream in place of cool whip for the pudding mixtures. I made a box cake mix, instead of brownies. While the cake was still hot, I poked holes in the cake and poured a cup of coffee over it. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the cool whip before using it. There was nothing left of this dessert!"
"1","5","Sweet and rich but delicious!"
"1","5","I added Oreos instead of the chocolate candy bar. And adding the sweetened condensed milk made things almost unbearably sweet. I added a little to the whipped topping but that made it sort of like marshmallow topping."
"1","5","In a word....Delicious!  Will def put this recipe on my 'must have' list!"
"1","5","I used my GF's brownie recipe which makes the brownie turn out very fudgey, and might I say perfect for this recipe. So, so good! I found myself eating the rest of this at 3 in the morning straight from the trifle dish! Thanks!"
"1","5","This truly a decadent dessert. Perfect for potlucks and group gatherings."
"1","5","Perfect as is. I make this quite often and I NEVER bring home leftovers."
"1","5","Made this for a birthday party and went home with an empty trifle bowl! I made the following changes: used a 6.4 oz (whatever the large size instant pudding mis is) box of instant pudding per the instructions on the box since I read the reviews that it was too sweet with the condensed milk and water; added strawberries which helped cut the sweetness. I couldn't find vanilla cool whip as suggested in reviews but regualr cool whip was just fine. I also made three layers and added a heath bar to the first two layers. Next time I will leave out the heath and add bananas instead."
"1","5","Outstanding!! I took the advice of others and used the chocolate chunk brownies, the french vanilla cool whip. I also used the whipping cream mixed with the whipped topping. So good!"
"1","4","This was an awesome dessert. I fixed it for the family on Valentines Night and everyone loved it. It only refrigerated 4 hours but tasted fine....of course, much better the second day. If you have a small family like us (4 people), then this is way too much dessert -- however, we have been snacking on it for three days now and it tastes better than ever. Or you could cut the recipe in half  After reading all the reviews, i definitely did NOT add the sweet condensed milk, and it tasted fine -- very sweet and delicious.  I am sure I will make it again."
"1","4","Very good. Took this to a Super Bowl party and got rave reviews. Only thing I changed was to add toffee bits and carmel sauce to the layers. I don't have a trifle bowl so I used a medium sized glass mixing bowl and had plenty with this recipe as is. Very tasty."
"1","3","In my opinion, way too much chocolate. Kind of disappointing, and don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate! But this was too much. And the brownies didn't mix in well enough. Will not make again."
"1","3","I was disappointed with this dessert. Maybe it's just that I can't handle it, but I really felt that it was far too rich and sweet. If I ever make it again, I would use regular milk instead of the sweetened condensed milk and instead of the brownies would bake a lighter less dense chocolate cake. Otherwise, I think it could be perfect!"
"1","5","Very good. Everyone looks forward to this at Christmas. Feeds a lot."
"1","4","Very easy to put together. Instead of using the condensed milk, I made the pudding according to package directions to try & cut the sweetness. I also added a layer of smashed up Heath Bars."
"1","5","This is my first time making a trifle. I needed a desert for a Christmas dinner function I was attending and a work colleague suggested a trifle. I got this recipe online and made it.  I reduced the sweetened condensed milk to only 2 tablespoons (because all the ingredients were already sweet). I also added some blackberries and a few blueberries on top. The trifle was a big hit at the dinner. Everyone loved it. My son suggested that I make this my signature desert, since I didn't have one.  I think I will. Thanks 'allrecipes.com', for saving my day."
"1","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and it was such a hit that I was TOLD that I was making it again for Christmas. I added fresh cut strawberries to the garnish the top and it was beautiful!"
"1","4","This was a great recipe! It was a little too sweet because I made the pudding with sweetened condensed milk instead of cool whip. Next time I will make the pudding with 1 1/2 cups of whole milk. I also added chocolate chip cookies and colored the Cool Whip red and green for Christmas. I also put Christmas sprinkles on top. This recipe was great for Gluten Free people. I used GF brownie and cookie mix."
"1","5","I made this recipe recently for a Christmas party and, like many of the reviews, it was a huge success and very simple to make. The dinner table was very quiet as everyone was busy eating the dessert. :) I would definitely recommend making 1-2 days before.  A couple of changes I made that really seemed to make a difference included: added a couple of tablespoons of kahlua to the brownies. I used a double chocolate chunk brownie mix and added it to the very bottom layer. For the layer following the chocolate pudding/mousse layer, I used a large box of oreo cookies which I crushed (by putting them in a large ziploc bag and then pounded with a hammer--great stress reliever!). I also added a layer of strawberries to cut the sweetness, which everyone LOVED, especially since the trifle itself is very very sweet and rich. The strawberries, as well as decorative cupcake picks (with reindeer, stars, birds, etc) were used to top the trifle and to add a Christmasy touch.   Very fun to make. I was very pleased."
"1","5","I followed the adjustments as per Roxanne323 with the heavy cream whipped with sugar till thick and creamy. It was great except I didnt think it needed the caramel at all. It was already sweet enough and definately better made the day before!"
"1","2","This just had no wow factor. It was OK but I wouldn't go to the bother of making it again. I made all the components from scratch as our grandson has nut allergies and I hoped this would hit our daughter's chocolate tooth but it wasn't chocolatey enough and not worth all the calories. It did look pretty."
"1","2","Too sweet!!! I followed the suggestion regarding the heavy cream, but just wasn't that impressed. I think it might be better if you just add regular pudding without mixing it with heavy cream."
"1","5","So easy and DELICIOUS!! Tastes great if you make it a day or two in advance."
"1","5","My mother-in-law makes this and it is the best. This is the exact recipe except she uses heath bar on top. Personally I think the shaved chocolate bar would be better since I don't really like heath but either way would be good."
"1","5","This was really delicious and incredibly rich! The sweetened condensed milk adds a nice flavor to the pudding mixture. I used crushed Butterfinger candy bars between the two sets of layers and also as a garnish on top, and it was a huge hit."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. I used chocolate cake instead of brownies and wasn't as rich. I also alternated strawberries and rasberries on top for garnish. (around rim of dish) Looked amazing and fruit balances out sugar. I also sprinkled crushed Heath bar on top."
"1","5","Easy, delicious and attractive dessert....made better with a few changes! First, i prefer to use 2 boxes of the double chocolate ghirardelli brownies (yummy). It is easier to combine pudding and water first before adding condensed milk. Use heavy whipping cream rather then cool whip"
"1","1","I was excited to try this but I never got past the pudding stage, made the way the recipe stated, I just had a goopy weird substance that did not resemble anything I could put in a trifle and was so sweet it was nauseating. I tried this because of the high reviews- thought I'd share my disappointing experience."
"1","5","Yum, yum, yum. I followed the review below regarding the heavy cream and vanilla whipped cream. It was delicious! Just remember to mix the condensed milk wiht the jello and water. The instruction didn't seem clear to me. The BEST after about 8 hours in the fridge!"
"1","5","Made it for a BBQ and everyone loved it. Wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","YUM!!"
"1","5","To. Die. For. Easiest thing in the world. You can either bake the brownies yourself, or buy a few packages of the Two Bite brownies to throw it together quickly. Either way it's awesome. I have yet to find someone that doesn't like it."
"1","5","Delish! I made this for a ladies night at my house & was very dissppointed to have so little left over!!! Everyone loved it! This is also a no fail recipe, it would be really difficult to mess this up."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe!! My husbands coworkers always ask for the chocolate deliciousness."
"1","5","So many things you could do with this. Adding your own spin to it is what's fun! I love making trifles and this is a good one to start with for sure!"
"1","5","Can't go wrong with this. You can make it less unhealthy (but not healthier, lol) by using fat free whipped cream and pudding mix. I prefer using real whipped cream (pint of heavy whipping cream + sugar + beat in chilled bowl with beater until forms peaks. I don't think it'll take a full pint - I start with a cup of liquid."
"1","5","Made this for a get together over the weekend and my daughter said it was the best dessert I've made yet...and I bake a lot."
"1","5","YUM!!! This is a family favorite.There is always an empty dish when I serve this!"
"1","5","My family loves this and very easy to make"
"1","5","very good and looks pretty too"
"1","3","Alan/Shelby liked it...  Used dark chocolate pudding and crumbled graham crackers"
"1","5","Made it as a Valentin'e Day dessert for my boyfriend. Turned out perfect on the first try. Followed other user's suggestions by whipping heavy cream and adding to chocolate pudding. Soooo good!"
"1","5","amazing!"
"1","5","I added in a layer of milk chocolate chips on the top of each layer to give it another texture. This is easy and delicious!"
"1","5","AMAZING! this was so good and everyone LOVED it!!!"
"1","5","Really Yummy & super easy! My guests were impressed!"
"1","5","Followed recipe as stated. Decadent without being too rich. I usually use chocolate pudding without anything mixed in, so this was different for my family and they really liked it. :)"
"1","4","Very yummy recipe. I make a version of this recipe with a prepared Devil's Food Cake Mix, Chocolate Mousse, and Cool Whip."
"1","5","3 Words to describe this dish ... YUM * YUMMY * YUM-Ooooo !!!"
"1","5","Try using Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies from this site. These are out of the world good. For chocolate shavings on top. I put a Hershey's chocolate cand bar in the freezer and then use my cheese grater. Works great. If you want curls - use the cheese grater when the candy bar is at room temp."
"1","3","I saw this recipe and got so excited... I love sweets! However, when I made this for a family BBQ, it was even too sweet for my sugar-loving family. Maybe it would have been better if I had added something else to balance out the sweetness... like strawberries. A little of this goes a long way!"
"1","4","This was definitely good but to me it was just a little too sweet!! Could only handle a small amount!!"
"1","5","I have made this several times, is always a success. Many requests to make it again. Would recommend using a Skor candy bar, and add it to the middle layer as well as the top for garnish."
"1","4","This was very good. I served it to company and it was well received. I made the recipe exactly as the recipe stated. Next time I will try some of the other suggestions, but don't hesitate to make as stated!"
"1","5","my mom and aunts have been making this dessert for years. A couple great variations to this is to use chocolate cake instead of brownie mix and also to mix through the chocolate pudding, chopped up Heath bar. That adds an amazing crunch. Amazing old tradition in my family"
"1","4","VERY easy to make and should be made the day before so it's ideal for parties (that way you won't be stressing last minute). Pretty tasty and it was a big hit with my guests. I've already made it twice!"
"1","5","Awesome!! Very good recipe."
"1","5","I changed the recipe up a little bit, and my layers were as follows. Brownies, homemade chocolate mousse, crunched up kit kat bars, cool whip. Another layer of the same, and then topped it with raspberries and chocolate shavings. It was definitely a hit. I was afraid that it was going to be too rich and too sweet, and while it was a heavenly dessert, it wasn't too rich. Everyone LOVED it, and told me not to make it again, but only because it was so loaded with calories! Turned out really good, was def a hit :) Try it!!!"
"1","5","We offered this on a buffet with fruit pieces on the side to add as wanted. It was such a huge hit, we ran out of strawberries and banana!"
"1","5","I'm so surprised at the number of people just catching on to the 'trifle thing'. I've done these for years, because they are sooo versitile. You can use up stale cake, cake or pies that flop, left over fruits, any pudding or jello. Nuts ,candy,liquores. Endless as your imagination!! Always a hit with any age group."
"1","5","Excellent dessert!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! This always gets devoured at parties. My only hint is to always use Betty Crocker brownies and make them extra thick (I use two boxes and serve the leftovers separately)...out of all the ones I make, these brownies are an overwhelming favorite. I use chocolate chips on top to save time. The mousse is to die for and I've made it separately with red raspberries and whipped topping for a parfait like dessert too! Thanks for posting this delicious dessert!"
"1","5","Awesome! This went so fast at my pampered chef party this weekend. Everyone raved! There were several kids too who just loved this :) I did follow a few tips from previous reviews (although I am sure the original would have been fine too). I don't love cool whip, but I do agree that it holds up better in this type of recipe. I used 8oz heavy cream whipped and folded that into the chocolate mixture. I used a tsp of vanilla in the cool whip layers (my store didnt have the french vanilla) and I thought that was a major improvement to the overall flavor. I used store brand chunk brownie mix and cut them into very small pieces, then layered with caramel sauce, then chopped heath bar, then the chocolate, then the coolwhip and repeat. I topped with additional chopped heath bar. It looked beautiful and tasted great. I will definitely make this again and again :)"
"1","5","Super Yummy.... I took the advice from another comment to make it all with REAL whipping Cream and Cooked Pudding. I also used Triple Chocolate Brownie mix that I purchased from Costco (Super delicious). For those of you that can't ignore that Chocolate craving ... This recipe is PERFECT."
"1","5","Really good. Many flavors."
"1","4","This was delicious! It came out wonderful and very sweet."
"1","5","Wow this is good!!! i made this yesterday and it is already all gone. this is a keeper. thanks for posting."
"1","5","I made this for a church gathering and it was a HUGE hit!"
"1","5","This is absolutely terrific! Took it to a party and it was a huge hit! I am sure I will make this often!"
"1","5","Great and super easy. The only change I made was to add Heath bits to every layer and top. It's really rich. I may try this again using sugar free pudding, low fat condensed milk and lite cool whip to make it a little less sinful to eat!"
"1","5","This is dangerously delicious."
"1","3","Very appetizing presentation! Simple to put together. The pudding with the sweetened condensed milk is genius (I've already thought of half a dozen other ways to use that component elsewhere)! Don't let my three-star rating fool you, our family ate the whole thing in one sitting! My hubs and I just felt like it really needed something to really connect all the different layers. This is super-rich already, so maybe this would put it over the top, but next time we make this (and we will!), we're going to try drizzling Hershey's syrup over the brownie layer before adding the mouse layer. Ya, I know, more chocolate, but the layers just didn't meld together the way we thought they would. We're hoping the syrup will act as a cohesive element between the layers. Then again, maybe we're overthinking. Anyway, this was worth making, especially if you REALLY like chocolate, and REALLY like rich desserts."
"1","5","This is one of the best chocolate desserts I have ever eaten! And I love chocolate. It was so easy to prepare and I was able to make it a day ahead of time as it is better if it sits all day or night."
"1","1","I hated this. Made it exactly as the recipe specified. Too sweet and hated the texture of the chocolate mixture."
"1","5","I made this for my fiance and he LOVED it. It was absolutely amazing. He's been requesting it constantly since the first time I made it. I changed a few things (as per other people's suggestions) and used heavy cream to fold into the pudding rather than coolwhip. I also added heath toffee bits and layered in the following way: brownie, caramel sauce, heath bits, pudding mix, coolwhip, browni, caramel sauce, pudding mix, cool whip--then topped with crumbled brownie and toffee bits. it was AMAZING. tastes better the next day! This is best if prepared a day ahead and allowed ample time to chill"
"1","5","I followed this recipe with the addition of caramel on top of the cake layers and then a final drizzel on the top with the chocolate curls. My husband took it to work for a co-worker's birthday almost a year ago and they are still talking about it!"
"1","5","very good my family loved it"
"1","5","I love this dessert! I have made it a few times, each using a different combination of ingredients. The latest was cheesecake pudding, cherry pie filling, and angel food cake with the cool whip and condensed milk from the original recipe. It was a huge hit. When making the original recipe, I added some crushed up heath bar in between the layers. It gave it a nice crunch. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I will continue to make with different combinations of pudding and cake."
"1","5","I followed the suggestion to use cool whip with the pudding mix, water (actually, I used brewed coffee instead of water), and condensed milk, and whipped cream instead of cool whip as a layer in the trifle. Yum! It's really fun to make, too."
"1","5","delicious and easy"
"1","5","I have made this probably 10 times now for Christmas and Thanksgiving family dinners. I always get rave reviews, requests for the recipe, and an empty dish when I make this. You can put almost anything on top to dress it up: brownie crumbs, chocolate-covered strawberries, crunched up butterfingers...whatever you have on hand."
"1","5","Everyone I make this for can't get enough. It's ridiculously rich so will feed more than you think it will. Thank you kindly!"
"1","5","This is a KEEPER! So delicious and rich. I can't eat a lot of this at one time which makes it all the better. I completely flubbed this recipe and it still turned out incredible. Instead of mixing the pudding, water, and sweetened milk together...I made the pudding per the package directions. Since there was no turning back I mixed in the sweetened milk and whipped topping to my already prepared pudding. It turned out fabulous. What a delicious and delectable treat - thank you for this recipe!"
"1","4","Easy and good but definitely not the best trifle I've ever had"
"1","3","Extremely easy to make, good for a kids birthday party, or a make ahead dessert-however i did not think it was anything very special, and it was a little to sweet."
"1","5","made this on the fly for my daughters varsity soccer potluck. All the girls raved. Very easy. I used store bought brownies to save time. Also added caramel and heath bar bits as another reviewer suggested."
"1","5","Oh SO rich, I've also made this adding NOT ONLY the brownies, but broken up soft chocolate chip cookies TOO...mmm. My mom and I wondered if, instead of chocolate, the new Jello brand pumpkin spice pudding would make a good fall dessert such as this, maybe with Nilla wafers or graham crackers instead of brownies??? :)"
"1","5","AMAZING! I was very impressed with this recipe and will be making it many, many more times. I made it exactly as directed and still wouldn't change anything, although next time I may add some strawberries for fun."
"1","5","BEST ever. Normally I have NO luck with stuff like this - it turned out perfectly. I am definately an amateur cook - so if I could do this - anyone can. We had a small dinner party and they LOVED it, raved about it and asked for the recipe. This NEVER happens to me, I was delighted AND it's super easy too. Totally awesome. Thanks for this amazing recipe. My hubby is still bragging about it. One last thing - it looked soooo amazing in my bowl I bought just for this dessert. Totally worth it. Thank-you, thank-you."
"1","5","This was very good! I have a family of three so I made two smaller dishes - one is frozen. I did not use a 3.9 pudding mix, instead I went for the larger size of 5 oz. just to give it more chocolate flavoring. The brownies I baked and then sent directly into the fridge and they were nice and cakey for us! I will definately be making this again!"
"1","5","At every family dinner get together I challenge myself by including something new. It's a kind of an addictive adrenaline rush for me. Not always such a wise idea but so far I haven't had any grand flops. I splurged, treating myself to a long wanted trifle bowl, to best present this dessert's layers. I did follow directions as written, only subbing real whipped cream. As the bowl was tall I was able to add 1 more layer, sprinkling a scant teaspoon of Skor toffee bits on each. It was fun decorating the top with shaved chocolate, coloured sugar, a pinch of toffee bits and thin strips of candied orange peel. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sugary-Orange-Peel/Detail.aspxAt This trifle caused quite a stir as we took first bites. I was treated to 'awesome, OMG too good, fabulous'. Everyone loved it and they all left with a copy of the recipe. I couldn't have asked for better results."
"1","5","Every time I make this dish, I never have any leftovers!! I just Reese's peanut butter cups on top and I think it adds the perfect touch to this delicious dessert!!"
"1","5","This is absolutely fabulous! I've made it several times. And it's really easy. It's now a favorite that I can bring to parties and such."
"1","5","I made this for a family gathering and had NO leftovers. I've made it 2x now once with cool whip and once with homemade whip cream. Homemade was way too rich and sweet and for me to say that is really something. I think I'll try the vanilla cool whip but so far the cool whip was the best"
"1","1","This trifle is far too sweet, I hardley tasted the chocolate. I may make it again but replace it with a different chocolate cream recipe and use whipped cream over the whipped topping."
"1","4","I wish it would say what SIZE trifle bowl. I have two."
"1","4","This was very good, but I think I took away from the overall flavor by trying to go light. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and lite Cool Whip. It was still good, but not as good as I wanted it to be. Next time I'm going to skip the 'light' and add a little peanut butter to the SCM before I add it to the pudding mix."
"1","5","I have made this several times. I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Everyone loved it. The second time I heated half of a jar of raspberry jam on the stove with a couple of tablespoons of water to thin it out. Once the raspberry sauce was through I poured it over the baked brownies. I followed the rest of the recipe the same except instead of using a candy bar I saved chocolate on top of the trifle. It turned out great and once again everyone loved it."
"1","5","This recipe is to die for. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. The second time I made it, I added nuts and summer berries. The third time, I added caramel sundae topping and toffee bits. Each time was splendid and each time the dessert was gobbled up in a flash!!"
"1","5","Very easy to make and went along way due to being very rich.Followed directions as written except added caramel sauce as reviewer suggested (Had on hand). Will make again"
"1","5","Made half the recipe by using an 8*8 brownie mix and making the pudding according to the box. It filled 6 individual trifle dishes. Topped each dish with a cherry... a great presentation for Daddy's birthday."
"1","5","Made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit with a huge WOW factor! The pudding mixed with the sweetened condensed milk tastes like a yummy mouse! Next time, I am going to throw some heath bar, other candy bar, or chocolate chips into the brownie mix before they cook for some added texture. I highly recommend refrigerating overnight before eating. Oh, this keeps well in the fridge for nearly a week if you don't eat it all the first try :)"
"1","5","Wow! I followed Roxanne's advice and used toffee chips and made my own whipped cream and then used french vanilla cool whip. It was amazing... I took it to work and it disappeared."
"1","5","Everybody like it.I thought it was a little to sweet.Was very easy to make."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! I've made this several times and every time got rave reviews. I didn't use the entire can of sweetened condensed milk the second time, as the first time I think it was a tad on the sweet side. Both kids and adults have loved this when I've brought it places. Super easy and looks & tastes great!"
"1","4","Good reviews at work, but a little too rich/sweet for most people, including myself."
"1","5","It was so good I didn't have a chance to taste it. Served for Mothers's Day. In- laws & his side of family definitely impressed. I read reviews and added Heath toffee bars. (Had a problem crushing them up. Broke apart w/ hammer by placing candies in several plastic baggies.)"
"1","5","I made this for a work baby shower and had to bring 20 copies to work the next day for all the people who wanted the recipe! Great presentation and delicious."
"1","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I made a few modifications. Instead of cool whip added to the pudding, I used one pint of heavy whipping cream and mixed until I had a nice, thick consistency. Since it wasn't quite chocolatey enough for me after adding the whipping cream, I added 3 tablespoons of dark (unsweetened) cocoa."
"1","5","Won my husband's work dessert contest with this one....everyone loves it and it looks amazing."
"1","5","If you take the other user's suggestions, this is a 5 star recipe. If you make it exactly as the recipe states, it's probably a 4 star recipe."
"1","5","One of my favortie 'No Fail' recipes, you just cant mess it up because it is all good! Really good variations out there, I love raspberries in this chocolate one!"
"1","5","Delicious! I used 1/2 pint whipping cream with 3 Tbls sugar to fold into pudding mix as others suggested. I also used 1/2 regular brownies and 1/2 blonde brownies and layer of caramel sauce over the brownies. The rest of the recipe as stated and everyone loved it."
"1","4","Very good but too rich for me. I would like this better with chocolate pudding as-is, without the condensed milk. Beautiful presentation and very easy."
"1","5","This was my first trifle. It was very good. I used one bowl chocolate cake III from this site and I used real whipping cream and mousse (1st time too). I shredded dark chocolate on the layers and top. This was very easy and very good."
"1","5","So easy to make, but so delicious!"
"1","4","This was DELICIOUS, I only gave it a four because I made some adjustments, I used french vanilla whipcream and chocolate whip cream to do layers with including the chocolate pudding. I added fresh cut strawberries which I thought gave it some texture, definitely is important to let sit so the ingredients can marry, so delicious I will make this again!!!"
"1","5","This trifle was a major hit at my birthday party today! All of the guests left with the recipe. It tasted and looked great!!! Thanks for a delicious recipe!"
"1","5","Gorgeous and incredibly easy. Tasted like heaven. I did add a layer of caramel sauce and it was superb. Might try drizzling the brownie layer nextime with some liquer to soften it a bit more."
"1","5","Good recipe - easy to customize. I took this to a family function and it was a big hit."
"1","5","A little too much coolwhip. Chocolate filling could be a little creamier"
"1","5","This recipe is a good basic recipe and you can adjust it to your preference. I made chocolate pudding as the recipe called for on the box except I used half of the milk and half of half and half cream. Condensed milk was too sweet when I made it the last time. I then added a layer of thawed raspberries and everyone cleaned their plates!! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Its really easy to make."
"1","5","This was incredibly easy to prepare, and the outcome was beautiful and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and did not add any special twists this time, but next time I might consider spicing it up a bit with chocolate chips or something of that sort. Great recipe - super easy - will use this one again!"
"1","3","Had high expectations, but it was WAY too sweet. And I love chocolate!"
"1","5","Made this for Christmas~HUGE hit! Huge"
"1","5","I love this recipe. This is my go to receipe for a last minute pot luck at work. The only thing I do different is substituate the brownies for canned cherry pie filling. Just me, but I think the brownies make it a little too heavy. Other than that, dont mess with perfection."
"1","5","Absolutely FANTASTIC. Made my own whipped cream and topped each whipped cream layer with heath bar chunks--I loved the extra crunch. Made again and topped the brownie layer with half a jar of caramel sauce BEFORE baking, per another user's review. I think next time I would add the caramel sauce AFTER baking, but other than that it was absolutely delicious--mom and fiance are still begging for another one!"
"1","5","Thank You! My mom has been making this for years. I like to have an actual recipe to keep in my book so I was very excited when I saw this. My mom does not mix the whipped topping and pudding but it really makes a difference."
"1","5","I made this back to back for a couple of different parties. First time, I followed previous suggestion and used chunky brownies, toffee chips, caramel, french vanilla coolwhip and whipping cream...it was awesome!! Second time, I used regular cool whip since I couldn't find the vanilla. Also, didn't let it setup as long. I noticed the difference - wasn't as good. But I got lots of requests for the recipe both times. I'll definitely make it again"
"1","5","I made this for one of my desserts for x-mas. Out standing! Everyone that ate it loved it. I used 'Cool Whip' because I like it. And instead of the water I made chocolate milk with half and half. I wanted it to be kid friendly. The adults loved it just as much as the kids. Great recipe."
"1","5","If I could give more than 5 stars I would! This dessert is so delicious! It was a huge hit for Christmas and even my husband (who isn't a chocolate lover) absolutely LOVED this dessert!"
"1","4","This was pretty good. I doubled the recipe, used real whipped cream for the white whipped cream layer (Dream whip to mix in with the chocolate) and omitted one can of condensed milk. I also added a layer of cherries jubilee between the brownie and chocolate layer. It definitely makes way more than 12 servings though - a single recipe is probably enough for 16 people."
"1","5","This is seriously one of the best recipes at Allrecipes! People fawn over this stuff: You will absolutely not go wrong with this dish. It's gorgeous on the table and in your belly.  My only suggestion is to skip the cool whip and go with real hand-whipped cream, for the pudding layer and the whip cream layer. But that's just me, I'm not a cool whip fan. Drizzling caramel sauce over the brownie layer and on the top makes it yummier and prettier.  Thanks for this recipe, it's honestly my favorite!"
"1","5","It was easy and turned out beautifully, I used the heavy whipping cream with a little sugar to mix with the pudding and I used fudge pudding and french vanilla cool whip like some of the reviews suggested. I will be making this again for sure"
"1","4","Great for a company party, and sure to be liked by most. My only complaint is that it was really dense, but not in a way that made it desirable. I mean that it was sort of syrupy, the chocolate pudding to be more specific. I will definitely be making homemade pudding next time, or lightening it up with homemade whipped cream, which I also recommend for this recipe. Overall, I think most people will enjoy this, just not really my thing!"
"1","5","VERY YUMMY! Changes I made: used low fat brownie mix (I can't tell), used Andes Mints after each layer they sell in chocolate chip type bags for the holiday twist. VERY GOOD!!"
"1","5","Absolutely fantastic. This is very, very good."
"1","5","OMG that is all I got to say,we could not stay out of this dessert.So so good"
"1","5","Per other reviewers, I omitted the sweetened condensed milk and used regular milk in it's place. I added 2 teaspoons instant coffee granules to the chocolate pudding. Also divided mixture into thirds for pretty layers. To the top layer of cool whip, I added 1/2 cup toffee bits, chocolate sprinkles, and red and green colored sugar for a festive look for a recent girl's night out. It was a hit, and the kids got to eat the leftovers...will keep for a special dessert. Thanks for the post!"
"1","5","This trifle is fabulous. However,I did change it alittle. Instead of coolwhip, I used 1 pint of whipping cream and 3T sugar in the condensed milk/water/pudding mix mixture. I also added health bar toffe bits and caramel sauce on top of the brownie lawyer. This is one dessert that never had leftovers."
"1","5","This was so good and so easy to make! I needed more cool whip for the layers, though. I used almost 2x what the recipe called for. I let it set for about 6 hours before it was served and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","Yesterday, I auditioned this recipe for my family to see if it was worthy to share at an upcoming church pot-luck. It was a huge hit with my husband and kids! I made one minor adjustment out of necessity. I only had one 8oz container of cool whip, so I whipped some heavy cream with sugar, strawberry extract, and a few drops of red food coloring. This was used in place of the white cool whip layer (the cool whip I had was folded it into the pudding mixture per recipe instructions). It not only looked beautiful, but it tasted amazing! I can't wait to make this again. Great recipe!"
"1","5","THis was very easy to make and a hit at our family gathering."
"1","5","I made this for a party and it was a hit! Everyone was raving over it! Super easy too. I substituted devil's food cake for brownies."
"1","4","One or two bites is all you really need! If you're looking for a chocolate overload/diabetic coma- this is it. I didn't use a trifle bowl, instead I used 10 wine glasses. The majority of people who tried it were blown away by how rich it was and agreed that next time we only need a shot glass. I used whipping cream in the pudding/custard instead of whipped topping. I think next time I will not use the condensed milk as it made the pudding very, very thick! Trifles are usually very light and fluffy, this was not. I was a little impatient and I tried some the night before... it was gross! I let it sit overnight (w/ my fingers crossed!) & the next day the flavours were well blended. It was delicious! I wouldn't really call this a trifle, due to the fact that the only 2 things in common are the layering & a need for refrigeration. This is more like a chocolate mousse cake, but yummy regardless. I'll make this again for a Girl's night where tons of chocolate is appreciated, but other than that it's not something I'd make very often. I prefer fresh tasting trifles!"
"1","5","The BEST dessert on earth! Everytime I bring this to a gathering I make new friends! haha So easy and beautiful in a trifle bowl!"
"1","5","I have made this several times and always never have any left."
"1","5","Thanks for the great recipe! I made this and brought it to work for a co-workers b-day. She loved it. I used the Betty Crocker box fudge brownies, and I followed the recipe to a T! I will try to make my own whipped cream next time, but I like how super easy it was."
"1","5","I made this recipe for a church gathering. It was very easy to make. The taste was delicious. Also, I made it prior to going to sleep the night before and ate it for lunch the next day. I was afraid that the brownies would be soggy, but it was amazing. I think making it before I went to sleep saved a lot of stress the next day."
"1","4","Good, easy, and rich!"
"1","5","Instead of using a brownie mix, I used the recipe for the Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake with Caramel Sauce I found on the site."
"1","5","This was great. I added crushed heath bits on the top. Everybody loved it. Will definately make this again!!!!"
"1","4","My family really enjoyed this."
"1","5","Very rich, very delicious, very pretty!"
"1","5","Easy to make, beautiful, and very yummy. Took it to a work function and it was gobbled up. Even people that usually avoid desserts had some (and sent me e-mails about it). Thank you!"
"1","5","After reading the rave reviews of this recipe I couldn't help but try it out at my sister-in-law's bridal shower. It was a total hit, even with the guests who didn't typically like chocolate. I personally found it to be a bit too sweet for my liking but everyone else loved it! Next time I might try it with a cake mix as another reviewer suggested."
"1","5","Delicious! I made the original recipe as posted, everyone loved it! I made the same recipe but layered cherry pie filling and used cheesecake pudding in place of vanilla, I also added chopped walnuts to the layers, it turned out like a black forest trifle. Love it! Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","This is the ultimate indulgence!!!! It is a huge hit and is the most often requested dessert in my family. It is very rich though and a small portion is very filling. I would give it more 'stars' if I could!"
"1","5","LOVED IT. Always gets several great comments when I take it to family events."
"1","4","This recipe was very good, and my daughter loved it, but it was far too rich for me and my boyfriend. But that is just personal taste, the recipe itself is great. Perfect recipe for an eye pleasing, impressive dessert and so easy!"
"1","2","Didn't care for it too much, too sweet"
"1","5","This recipe got rave reviews at a potluck. I used a low-fat brownie mix, fat-free Sweetened Condensed milk and Cool Whip Lite and it still tasted great! Used another reviewers suggestion and topped w/ mini chocolate chips. I didn't own a Trifle dish but found one at Walmart for $6.97."
"1","4","I made a similar recipe from Kraft for my boss's birthday and it was a huge hit! Instead of candy it had fresh raspberries and it substituted vanilla flavored whipped topping."
"1","5","Love, love, love this trifle. Since I'm a choco-holic, I add chopped up Oreo cookies too!"
"1","5","Loved it! But be sure to add bananas-it makes it SO much better."
"1","5","Husband, who is one big giant sweet tooth, said this is the best dessert I have ever made and quite possibly the best he has ever tasted! I modified it according to other reviews. Added the Heath Bar Toffee bits and folded the pudding mixture in with the heavy whipping cream (that I had whipped in my kitchenaid mixer until stiff.) WOW was this good."
"1","4","This was yummy! I didn't have condensed milk so I used fat free half and half for the pudding. I layered this in individual glasses for my guests. There were rave reviews... and no left-overs."
"1","4","Try this recipe with peanut butter cups or heath bar to change it up a little. I also used a chocolate chip brownie mix as well as a regular brownie mix to change it up a little."
"1","5","I've made this several times and it is absolutely delicious! Friends raved and gobbled it up! My husband requested it for his bday. The only change I made was putting Heath toffee chips on the top instead of the choc candy bar. Yes it is sweet, but what do you expect from a chocolate dessert?!"
"1","5","So delicious and easy-it's hard not to eat too much! Looks beautiful in my trifle bowl too."
"1","5","Prepared this for a bridal shower and everyone loved it. I got a lot of compliments on it just for it's appearance."
"1","5","this chocolate trifle was reallly good and i made some adjustments as well. i used dark chocolate pudding and dark chocolate shavings on top. i also baked the brownies 1 or 2 days before, because they always taste better a few days old! i used regular cool whip and i feel like whipping heavy cream might taste better, but if you refrigerate it overnight will it get 'watered down'? oh, the last change i made was sprinkle oreo crumbs on top of the brownies before adding on the cool whip. YUMMMMMY :)"
"1","5","Wow! That is all my family and friends had to say. I have never made one of these dishes and for Father's Day I wanted something fun and new. I followed the recipe mostly. I did change up the pudding mix and instead of using cool whip, I used 8oz of heavy whip cream (like other's suggested). I also was trying to find the french vanilla cool whip instead of just plain old coll whip, but the store I went to was out. I compromised and used the plain old cool whip but I added in about 4Tablespoons of French Vanilla Instant Pudding Mix. Strange I know, but it worked. :) I also drizzled caramel over the brownies, before putting the pudding layer on. And the shaves off the candy bar...small ingredient, but REALLY put the finishing touch on it. :) Thanks to everyone's suggestions, we LOVED it and I am sure I will make it again. Thanks!"
"1","4","Probably a 4 1/2! I take off 1/2 as it is VERY rich. You can't eat a lot of it. Next time will definitely 1/2 the sw. con. milk as otheres suggested. Used the lg pudding boxes, used whip cream in w/ the pudding and doubled the amount of Cool Whip layer. Doubled the recipe, which filled my largest glass bowl, and medium glass bowl (probably not necessary to do for a BBQ/potluck--but maybe for a large church one) Still have the full medium bowl left!"
"1","3","The mousse substance was more like flubber vs a smooth mouse (still yummy though!). I will have to try some alterations to see if I can get it smoother."
"1","5","Yum! I used little 8 oz clear cups to make individual portions.  Thanks for this simple recipe."
"1","5","I have made this dessert countless times! It is an extremely easy dessert. I've shared this at potlucks, birthdays, family dinners, etc. Everyone loves it and can not seem to get enough! I like to use the Ghiradhelli Brownie Mix with this...it makes it EXTRA yummy! I've made this recipe exactly as it says and I think it's perfect!"
"1","2","I was really looking forward to eating this after reading all the reviews and drooling over the picture. I was unimpressed. It had way too much cool whip. Would have been better if the chocolate pudding was made regularly insetad of with the cool whip and stuff. I ended up throwing most of this out, which says a lot since I'm a pregnant chocoholic!"
"1","5","was pretty and very good. I used a chocolate cake from this site instead of brownies. It was to die for. YUM."
"1","5","I would give this 10 stars if possible, it is that good. I made a change to the recipe that I think was crucial to it's success. I whipped heavy whipping cream and only sweetened it very slightly, instead of using Cool Whip. I think this helped the dessert not to be sickly sweet. I also used chopped Heath Toffee bits on top for extra crunch."
"1","5","I've made this several times, and there are never leftovers--everyone asks for the recipe. I did make few alterations suggested by previous reviews. I used french vanilla cool whip instead, only 1/2 can of condensed sweetened milk and whipped 1/2 pint of whipping cream with ~3 tbls. of sugar and added to pudding mixture. I've also used crushed malted balls between layers and used as a garnish on top. Great dessert!!!"
"1","5","This was so easy to make and was really good,everybody liked it,even my mum who wasn't sure about eating chocolate trifle.I do not understand how any one could find this to rich,it might be because in England we have different food products?I will be making again and again."
"1","5","I made this and it was wonderful. It was exactly what we were looking for to end our BBQ. It was a bit sweet so I think I will try the whipping cream idea instead of cool whip."
"1","5","I made this for my sister in law's birthday dinner. Instead of using a big serving bowl, I made individual trifles in stemmed wine glasses. I remember that I added an extra layer... maybe of a candybar or something. They were a huge hit and made a creative alternative to birthday cake!"
"1","5","This was exactly what I was looking for to end a fun dinner party.As a variation I made individual ones in deep red wine goblets and truly, what a hit!"
"1","5","Yum! This trifle turned out delicious and beautiful! I followed the suggestion of others and used 1/2 pint of whipping cream mixed with 3 Tbsp of sugar instead of the 8 oz cool whip. The chocolate mixture was thick and wonderful! I also used a peanut butter cup brownie mix and everyone kept asking what tasted so good in the brownies. I garnished with mini chocolate chips and Oreo crumbs I had left over from another dessert I was making."
"1","5","This dessert is simple and delicious. I made it for a Christmas eve dinner and everyone loved it! It looks great too!"
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly, except I buy an extra 12oz cool whip because I like more for the topping. I like to change it up a bit and add carmel or fudge sauce on top of the browines and sprinkle toffee chips...YUM"
"1","4","I thought this was just pretty good but everyone else seemed to love it. To me, it tasted like a brownie with whipped cream on top. (Note: I had a cold when I made this so my taste may have been a bit off!) I put Heath bar bits on top of the brownie layer and I liked the crunch and extra flavor that it added. I also put a few strawberries on top and more health bar bits. I will probably make this again just because it is something different and has a very nice presentation."
"1","5","This was very easy to make although it does take a long time. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","I made this as one of the desserts for Easter this year and it was the first one they dug into and the first one to be finished off. Everyone raved about it! Its very simple and I will be making this again. I had to borrow my mother-in-law's trifle dish but I'll be buying my own soon so I can make this all the time. THANK YOU!"
"1","5","words cannot describe this dessert. i was shocked how absolutely perfect it was. i'm not a fan of whipped topping, so i replaced the chocolate/whipped topping layer with a counterfeit chocolate mousse (pint heavy whipping cream, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 box instant chocolate pudding) and used vanilla whipped topping for the whipped topping layer instead of plain. i added a layer of caramel sauce between the brownie and mousse, but i'm not sure that added to it. this dessert is easy, delicious, and so worth the time."
"1","5","Two words...OUTSTADING, OUTSTANDING! However, we make fresh whipped cream, and more than what the recipe calls for."
"1","5","This is amazing! My family loves this recipe even my husband who isn't a sweet fan. It would be perfect for a party, because it make A LOT!!!"
"1","5","Made this for my birthday party and holy cow! I couldn't believe all of the rave reviews it got. I actually served it with the brownies still a little warm and a bit gooey (that's how we like them) and crumbled some additional brownie bits on top (didn't have any chocolate shavings). People absolutely loved it!"
"1","5","Great recipe, everyone loved it!"
"1","5","DELISH!"
"1","5","WOW! WONDERFUL!!! I added carmel to the top of brownies before baking and toffee bits between each layer and it was PERFECT!!! I also used French Vanilla Cool Whip and Heavy whipping cream as suggested by previous reviews."
"1","5","Elegant-delicious-quick-easy. Absolutely wonderful recipe. I was looking for something using brownies, but something a bit different. This was perfect. I did make my own homemade brownies instead of the boxed (which would have been just as good). The pudding mix I used was a small box of sugar free chocolate fudge (maybe it cut down on the overall sweetness because I didn't find this overly sweet as some reviews suggested). I was really surprised how the pudding mixture turned out with texture and taste. This is great for the chocolate-fanatic. Worked out fantastically. For sure this will be made again and again for various events and get-togethers. Although I think the original recipe is great as-is, I may take some of the suggestions on this site and change it up a bit- I especially like the caramel addition idea or cherry for a black forrest dessert. I did use just a large glass bowl since I didn't have a trifle bowl. Had a bit left over but not bad. I think as well as I enjoyed this recipe, I may have to buy a trifle dish to use for future makings of this dessert. I highly recommend this recipe."
"1","5","Amazing! The pudding layer in this recipe has a great texture...very rich and creamy. Will try next time white white chocolate brownies and strawberry pudding."
"1","5","I made this for a family gathering yesterday and it was a hit. My husband says this is now his all time favorite dessert. I have been famous for my great cheesecakes, but my family is telling me that this is now my signature dessert. Theonly changes I made to this recipe were ready-made brownies from the supermarket, crushed heath bars on top of the brownie layer and mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top. This is an easy recipie with a great presentation. This dish will make you look like a gourmet chef."
"1","5","This recipe is heavenly and decadent! My family loves it, and so has everyone else that I have made this for."
"1","5","Made this for christmas eve. Looks and tastes like it took a lot of trouble. So easy! What a great presentation; oohs and ahhs all around."
"1","5","This is a beautiful dessert. Followed others' suggestions and used a half pint of whipped cream in place of Cool Whip in the pudding layer. Topped it with halved strawberries for Valentines Day (looked like red hearts and gave GREAT flavor) The toffee chips sprinkled over the brownie layer stayed crunchy overnight under the chocolate mousse later. The chocolate mousse is SO thick! Fabulous! The first dessert killed at our huge potluck. *** one addition - I used cheap brownie mix and put lots of chocolate chips in it. This added another texture of chocolate - VERY important to yumminess. Baked chocolate chips are SO much better than sprinkling uncooked ones. Drizzled Dulce de Leche over the diced brownie layers - Absolutely awesome. And Noone thought it was too sweet. (also used two boxes of brownies - could have used a little more chocolate mousse - may double that next time)"
"1","5","I have made this recipe several times and it is wonderful everytime. My husband loves this."
"1","5","My family and friends love this recipe. I added a layer of rasperries as the middle layer. This made a very nice dessert for Valentines day."
"1","5","This was an awesome dessert! I made it in an 8x8 pan the first time, but had leftover pudding stuff and brownies. I made it a second time for a birthday 'cake,' but I made it in a 9x13 pan and all of the ingredients fit perfectly! Both times I only made three layers instad of six."
"1","5","This was delicious, and I will definitely make it again, but with a few changes. There was not enough pudding to cover the brownies, so I will use two packages next time. I also added some fresh sliced strawberries to the cool whip. Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","Made exactly as written. Everyone loves it and is so easy to prepare!"
"1","5","This was awesome! I did use whipping cream instead of whipped cream in the pudding. And I used vanilla wipped cream in for the whipped cream layer. I also let it refrigerate for 12 hours. I cannot say enough about these! SOOO GOOD!"
"1","5","This is a frequently requested recipe among my friends. Instead of boxed brownies, I use my favorite brownie recipes from this site 'dump bars'. YUM!"
"1","2","I made this for Christmas lunch dessert. It was waaaaay too rich. I don't know who can eat more than 2 brownies in a sitting let alone pile it with the cream and sauces! Just felt ill. I don't think I'll be making it again..."
"1","3","I've been making my own version of this recipe for years and thought I would give this one a try given it's high rating. My family thought this was much to sweet with the condensed milk added. I make it with fresh whipped cream, cooked chocolate pudding and Skor Candy bars. If I'm serving adults, I soak a bit of coffee liquor over the cake and for children I use chocolate syrup. At my family's request, I will stick to my stick to my original recipe."
"1","5","I have made this recipe twice, first I followed the recipe to the t, it was great but very, very sweet. The 2nd time I made some adjustments, used whipped cream w/ 3 Tb sugar in the condesnsed milk and puding mix; also used some of the whipped cream and mixed with the cool whip to reduce the sweetness and added a layer of crumbled heath bar on top of cool whip layers. It was fantastic!!! Definately a keeper..."
"1","5","I made this for Christmas using some of the suggestions made - added caramel sauce, used whipping cream in the pudding mixture, and used French Vanilla cool whip vs. regular. Also added the Heath bar chips. YUM!!!!"
"1","4","This is definitely for those with a sweet tooth! I did make my own whipped cream as I have never seen frozen whipped topping in South Africa. I made my own brownies as well using the 'Chewiest Brownies' from this site and it was good. I added strawberries. I think next time I would double the strawberries and add another whipped cream layer to dry and balance the sweetness from the brownies and the chocolate pudding layer. Very good though."
"1","5","i made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit! it does taste better the next day. i am definitely going to make this for christmas...my family loved it."
"1","5","This was sooo good! I made it for a dessert contest at work & won first place. Definately a keeper!"
"1","5","This is superb! One of my coworkers named this 'Heaven In A Dixie', as people ran out of plates and were eating it out of paper cups :-) I only made two changes... #1, I make two batches of boxed brownies in 8x8 pans- this gives me thicker. chewier brownie chunks. I also trim off a very thin layer of the brownie edges to makes sure each brownie chunk is soft, not at all crispy... #2, I have made this recipe both using cool whip as instructed, or by making my own homemade whipped cream instead. It's suprisingly easy after you've done it a couple times, and it tones down the sweetness a tiny bit (which seems to be more universally appealing among the crowds I've served it to). I always get requests for the recipe, and I happily pass it along! Thank you so much for sharing! This has become my widely requested pot luck staple!!!"
"1","5","To die for! I whipped heavy whipping cream to mix with the chocolate pudding and replaced the plain Cool Whip with French Vanilla Cool Whip. I have to take the recipe with me everywhere I go! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","I use a fudge brownie recipe that I have instead of a mix and I usually make more pudding than what the recipe calls for, but its still a great combination!"
"1","5","I had to double the recipe to get to the top of my trifle bowl. I figured I would have tons of leftovers but people were licking the bowl! I used fat free cool whip (couldn't find the vanilla this year) and low fat sweetened condensed milk to lessen the sweetness. I whip up 1/2 pt of heavy whipping cream and add that to the condensed milk/water/pudding mix instead of using cool whip. I also added skor bar bits and caramel sauce to every layer. It was a hit!"
"1","5","WOW I made this for a Christmas gathering this weekend. Most of my family ate this dessert before food!!! Everyone raved about this dessert. I made it just like instructions said. I will make a few adjustments next time (ex: caramel, whipping cream and more brownies) but I will be asked to bring this from now on!!!"
"1","5","This is just insanely good! I made the brownies very soft-set so they were all gooey. After reading other reviews, I used heavy whipping cream in the chocolate mousse and the French vanilla Cool Whip. I could eat this entire trifle in one sitting!!!! Mmm, mmmm good!!"
"1","5","I took this recipe to a potluck and it was a huge success. It is delicious, beautiful, and super easy to make. I didn't alter anything and it was wonderful. Definitely will go in my recipe box."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. It was super simple. I am making it for our Christmas family get together. It will be a wonderful and different addition to all the pies."
"1","5","This is a hit every time I make it! It's so easy. Even though it says you should let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours - you don't have to if you're in a pinch. People will still go crazy for it the instant you're finished making it! Great recipe, Wayne!"
"1","2","My family thought this recipe was so-so. Too much cool whip. It was nothing special. I will not make again."
"1","5","Great i usedheavy wihping cream instead of cool whip itt is a thanksgiving desert =)"
"1","5","Very rich and delicious. Got rave reviews by everyone who ate it and was the first dessert gone!"
"1","5","Oh, my goodness!!! This is an extremely wonderful dessert. I took it to my church small group meeting and it was a hit. Lot's of ooohhhs and aaahhhs."
"1","5","Everytime I make this it disappears before I get any!!!!"
"1","4","I needed a dessert in a hurry for a gathering I was having and was able to throw this together in 10 minutes using brownies from the bakery section of the grocery store. Total life saver being pressed for time. I've also done this with my own whipping cream and I think it's well worth the time for the improved taste!"
"1","5","Amazing! I followed the comments from Roxanne323 dated 6/10/07, and this was a huge hit at a school mixer. Just remember to remove your cool whip from the freezer and place it in your fridge at least 4 hours before planning to use it. I forgot and had to wait for it to thaw enough to spread. As a result the dish was served 4 hours after it was made instead of the 8 hours the recipe called for. Still tasted great (consider the ingredients!) Excellent dessert."
"1","5","This recipe is a definite keeper! My family devoured it at my mom's birthday party, and I got nothing but rave reviews. I did, however, do a few things different. I used a 16oz cool whip in the chocolate filling and a 12oz to make the whipped topping layer. I also added a layer of hot fudge sundae topping with toasted pecans. I drizzled the top with more fudge and pecans for a perfect finish. It's very rich, but well worth the calories. Thanks for this recipe! Oh, I forgot to mention that I also doubled the amount of brownies since I making it for a large group!"
"1","5","I made this trifle using some of the variations recommended in other reviews and literally had coworkers licking the bowl. Made it 2 weeks ago and had people asking for it again already this weekend. My changes:  1. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk. 2. Light cool whip. 3. Whipped my own whipping cream to mix with the chocolate pudding. 4. And used apple sauce in the brownies.  Very good!"
"1","5","This is an absolute standard in our house and my teenage daughter HAS to make it a couple of times a month just for her friends. Make sure you follow the recipe and don't just automatically make the pudding with milk (been there done that). We use more coolwhip (my son prefers the vanilla flavor cool whip) as we find the amount suggested doesn't cover enough to make definition between the layers."
"1","4","I made this dessert for a gathering with my family. I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate, because all that chocolate seemed like a little too much. It was unfortunately a little to sweet for my liking. I would maybe suggest using cake instead of the brownies next time to cut the sweetness. Overall great recipe and idea."
"1","5","OUTSTANDING!!! My new favorite trifle, replacing a Death by Chocolate trifle! I used one container Vanilla Cool-Whip and one regular (mostly for the top/white color.) Added choc chips to brownie batter and barely cooked them all the way to keep sinfully moist. Called it 'Trailer Trash Trifle' and made it in a 16 cup Pyrex measuring cup/bowl for a Redneck/White Trash costume party we went to - was devoured quickly!"
"1","5","THIS RECIPE IS SERIOUSLY TO DIE FOR!! MY FAMILY LOVED IT!! IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE AND IT TASTED LIKE CHOCOLATE PARADISE! :) YUMMY!!"
"1","4","Everyone really liked this, though it is very rich! I didn't bother cutting the brownies into 1' pieces, just crumbled them all over for the layers. I let it sit overnight, and it was great."
"1","5","Believe it or not, I've made this but not tasted it. I dropped it off at my care group after I had signed up to bring the dessert but couldn't make the study. My friend returned the trifle bowl the next day at church. She said it was so good that there were only chocolate streaks left on the bowl. For that...I give it 5 stars."
"1","5","Sinful. WONDERFUL! Died and gone to heaven lol"
"1","3","I had high expectations for this dessert because of all the rave reviews it had received, but found it didn't live up to the hype. I liked it, but found it a bit too dry and too sweet, without enough variety of flavours. All in all, I prefer a traditional English trifle.  Update: I found this is much yummier served warm with ice cream. One minute in the microwave does the trick. That way, it tastes more like a chocolate pudding."
"1","5","You can never go wrong with this recipe, when I am in a crunch I go to the local farmers market and buy the brownies pre-made. then just put everything together. Its a very easy dessert with very little work."
"1","5","I used this recipe as a base for a fruit-and-chocolate trifle. I added a layer of strawberries and raspberries as well as a white chocolate pudding layer. I took reviewers' advice and used heavy whipping cream instead of cool-whip. I made 'Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake' from this site instead of brownies--my friends were impressed and ate the entire thing by the end of the night!"
"1","3","This was good, but a little boring. It tasted like chocolate whipcream on top of brownies. I was looking for something a little more sinful!"
"1","5","Oh my gosh. Soooooo yummy! I used only half the sweetened condensed milk and made my own whipped cream for the middle and topping. I sprinkled crushed Heath bars over both of the pudding mixture layers and on top. Took to a friends house for a bbq and it was a huge hit."
"1","4","This was good. To make it even faster i used the two bite brownies that you can by in the groceery store. It made it good for the kids to get involved as well. They had fun."
"1","5","This is wonderful! I added instant coffee to the pudding mix, and I used extra creamy Cool Whip. I also didn't fold in as much as the recipe called for. Next time I'm going to blend in whipped sour cream into the Cool Whip for the non-chocolate layers. I'm afraid that may be too much, though. This is really good, but really sweet."
"1","5","I tasted the pudding while I was making this trifle and thought it might be too sweet, but when it was all put together and refrigerated, it was just right. I used leftover (week-old) brownies and you couldn't tell at all -- there was no leftover trifle!"
"1","5","My mom used to make something she called 'Death by Chocolate' and this is the closest to it I could find. I added Heath pieces on top which not only added to the beauty of the dessert, but went really well with the chocolately flavors!"
"1","5","This trifle is heaven. I made it for work once and people have never forgotten it. I like to sprinkle mini M&M's on top. It is truly delicious."
"1","5","I've made this twice and got rave reviews both times. To make it extra sinful, I doubled the recipe for Deep Dish Brownies on this site (4 eggs and no baking powder) instead of using a box brownie mix. A decadent treat and pretty, too!"
"1","5","This dessert was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except used fat-free Cool Whip,low-fat sweetened condensed milk and fat-free, sugar-free pudding mix. Also, I used 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce to make the brownies. If you didn't know, I guarantee you wouldn't have guessed. It was absolutely sinful. The one caveat, however, is make sure you have a nice handful of folks to serve, as it makes A LOT! I made the mistake of making this recipe this evening for our small family of 4 and we will probably be eating off this for the next week! FYI, my husband did say it was a bit too much chocolate for his taste. What does he know, anyway, LOL??"
"1","5","I made a DIET FRIENDLY version of this dish and it was fantastic! I also made a quick version. I bought the chocolate muffins that are made by weight watchers instead of making my own brownies. The fat-free instant pudding and the light cool-whip are just as good as the full-fat versions, so that was a no brainer substitution for me! The thing I love the most about this recipe is how easy it is to customize! I did strawberry slices instead of the chocolate shavings and put a layer of the strawberries in the middle too. Chocolate and strawberries... always a big hit! I can't wait for more events so I can share this with people! I also want to try cherries with the chocolate, and maybe sometime switch up the chocolate pudding for another flavor...maybe a key lime pie version!! FUN!"
"1","5","This is the second time I made this and everyone loved it-again. You can't go wrong with this combo. Topped it off with Heath bits instead of chocolate. Great."
"1","5","Let me start by saying that I did not have high hopes for this recipe...my daughter wanted to try it and I'm not a chocolate pudding fan myself, but I agreed to make it. So glad I did! It's a wonderfully delicious and easy dessert. I used a box mix for the brownie and slightly undercooked it so it would be more fudgy..crumbled them up and layered the brownie crumbles, then drizzled caramel sauce over the brownies, then the chocolate layer (made with the pudding mix, water, swt.condensed milk, and whipping cream that was whipped with just a spoonful of powdered sugar), then half of only an 8oz container of Cool Whip, then sliced fresh strawberries, then repeated. Made it the night before and everyone raved! I like that the chocolate layer doesn't taste like pudding...it's more whipped in texture too. We will make this again..soon!!!"
"1","5","This was yummy! I made it for a work party and it didn't last very long. I used a glass bowl since that is all I had. I went out and bought a trifle bowl to make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","What ever you do, MAKE THIS RECIPE.. I got so many requests for the recipe. I used brownies from the bakery at costco and it was just divine. Not too sweet, Just perfect."
"1","5","This was sooo good. I plan on making this dessert any time there is a large group of folks to feed. I added some vanilla extract to the whipped topping layer so it wouldn't be quite so plain. Next time I plan on adding in some chunks of toffee."
"1","5","This was so good! I took the chocolate trifle to a potlutck that I had for class, and everyone loved it."
"1","5","Mmmm! I was looking forward to leftovers, but I never got the chance! Everyone at the party loved this dessert!"
"1","4","extremely rich and tasty!"
"1","5","Fabulous!!!"
"1","4","It tastes just like you would expect...sweet and rich."
"1","5","yummy"
"1","5","This was so easy and very, very good!!! I used extra creamy whipped cream and for the topping I used a Heath bar and a Kit Kat bar! Everyone loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","This was very easy and OHHH SOOOO good! Everyone loved it! I added the caramel in the layers, but don't think I will do that next time."
"1","5","YUM! It's a winner!!! I'm not a big chocolate fan but this was fantastic. I'd like to try it once using a chocolate cake instead of the brownie for a little 'lighter' version."
"1","5","This was sinfully delicious!!!!"
"1","5","This recipe was wonderful! So good in fact that it's new name, accoding to friends is, 'Yummy Good Stuff'. I made it for a get-together last weekend and everyone ate it up in no time. Something fun to try is dipping pretzels into the trifle. It makes it taste like chocolate covered pretzels. Overall, I wouldn't change a thing and would reccomend this to everyone."
"1","5","INCREDIBLE!! Very rich and yummy! I made it for a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe! There was hardly any left to take home to my husband! It was a big hit and I will be making this again and again!"
"1","5","Made this twice within one week - got rave reviews at both picnics. Used Ghirardelli chocolate brownies (has 3 types of chocolate chunks in them) and sliced strawberries the first time and blueberries the second. Definitely needs some type of fruit - looks so pretty in the trifle. Also took the advice to use heavy whipping cream in the moose instead of cool whip. Excellent!!!"
"1","5","At Christmas I add a layer of canned cherry pie filling mixed with a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract stirred into the cherries. This is the last layer before the whipped topping. You can alternate this with the other layers if you have a big enough trifle dish. If you do it that way you'll need 2 cans of pie filling. Half of a can just isn't quiet enough to make a layer. I also add a sprinkling of toasted almonds along with the shaved chocolate on top of the whipped topping. Beautiful and delicious! Reminiscent of a Black Forrest cake."
"1","5","Yummy, will definitely make it again! Next time, I'd make more brownies. It was a great hit at the church's Easter potluck."
"1","4","Very tasty. Everyone at the party loved it. I found it a bit dry and wish the flavors had melded together a bit more."
"1","4","Seemed to go over well, I was so/so on the whole trifle, LOVED the chocolate mousse layer, was a keeper"
"1","5","This has become my favorite desert -- very chocolaty.... and very yummy!!! My whole family loved it..."
"1","5","Definately a keeper - I have made it twice this week - very easy to put together and every loves it. Sweetend Condensed Milk has never let me down in a recipe! Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","I've made this for two parties now, and I have a feeling if I don't for the next, I will have some upset guests. Everyone loved this trifle! No one needs to know how easy it was to put together! The only thing I change is that I double batched the brownies. My trifle bowl might be a bit larger. Great recipe!"
"1","5","Do not make unless you want a very sweet dessert. We love it, my son requested it for his birthday cake this year."
"1","5","I took this to the teacher's lounge for a birthday and it got great compliments! It's a really nice change instead of a cake!"
"1","5","I've made a trifle recipe similar to this in the past but was intrigued by the sweetened condensed milk. I only used half the can after reading some of the reviews about it being too sweet and I also replaced the water with strongly brewed coffee (from another reviewer). It was awesome. My son refused to lick the spoon because of the coffee but that just means I got to lick it for a change."
"1","5","WOW GOOD STUFF!!! I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it. Thank-you."
"1","5","Great dish for a crowd. My extend family loves it."
"1","5","I have made this several times and it was a big hit each time. I have made it with Oreo pudding and also with chocolate mousse and they were both delicious."
"1","5","Followed as written except cut the cool whip part down to 8 oz. Lots of oohs and ahhs, very easy. One recommendation - make sure you stir the cool whip before layering it so it spreads easier."
"1","5","Very impressive-looking dessert and easy to make. I served this for the extended family Christmas dinner and got lots of compliments and oohs and ahhs. A keeper for sure. I followed the recipe exactly and added some crushed Almond Roca to the top. No one thought it too sweet."
"1","5","Yummy! I've made this for several parties and everyone has loved it. It makes for a wonderful presentation. I used the Ghiradelli turtle brownie mix."
"1","5","my son's says it's the best dessert i ever made. i added chopped up peppermint patty to the top"
"1","5","This is sooooo yummy!! Instead of the Eagle brand milk & water we just use milk. Also, try it with a package of crushed Heath bar (find with the chocolate chips)... This is the easiest dessert!!! It will definitely cure a sweet craving!!!!"
"1","5","Ohmigosh, this was a slice of heaven! I made this for Christmas Eve and it was sweet but perfect! I didn't change a thing!"
"1","5","Easy to make and a crowd favorite!!!"
"1","5","We're going on 3 years of making this dessert during the holidays! Since the first holiday family and friends have raved about it! A+++"
"1","5","Great Recipe! I made it for a cookout and it had a beautiful presentation not to mention the bowl was scraped clean. Thumbs Up!!!"
"1","5","My new favorite dessert. It looks great with little work."
"1","5","I made this for the family and everyone raved about it. Fantastic and Super Easy!"
"1","5","Richer than Bill Gates. SO GOOD! I used sugar free pudding and cool whip. I also added crushed oreos between layers. This recipe is heavenly, but have a full glass of milk waiting!"
"1","4","Very Yummy! I DOUBLED this recipe for a large church get together and it was gone! I used 1 1/4 cans of sweetened condensed milk so it wouldn't be too sweet, then used regular milk to get it the consistency that I wanted it. It was delish!"
"1","5","Delicious and attractive!! I used sweetened whipping cream instead of the cool whip. I will definitely be making this again."
"1","5","I made this with sugar-free, fat-free pudding and sugar-free, fat-free frozen whipped topping, to cut down on some of the bad stuff. It lost a little in the way of texture, but was still very good. I will definitely make this again."
"1","3","Made us all feel a little ill. I don't know. Too sweet maybe (thought I'd never say such a thing)"
"1","5","This trifle is insanely delicious, following the recipe exactly as written. I've taken this to several parties over the years, and have been asked for the recipe by many, each and every time. So so good. Yum."
"1","2","I really wanted to like this one and it looked beautiful, but it's basically just a big mound of whipped topping with some brownies. Not the most tasty recipe - very pretty though."
"1","5","This is easy and produces such an impressive looking dessert. My kids have made it for their classmates, and it was gobbled right up."
"1","4","This recipe has a very nice presentation in a trifle dish."
"1","5","This is the easiest and most delicious trifle I have tasted in years!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved it. I made it for my boyfriend and I on Valentine's day. The perfect little sweet treat. Don't change a thing!!!"
"1","4","I really enjoyed this although next time I will use less Whipped topping."
"1","5","This dessert is AWESOME! Based on prior reviews regarding sweetness, the only change I made was adding 8oz of cream cheese to the pudding layer. This dessert was well received and was gone FAST! I would make again."
"1","3","This was good but not sure i would make it again..easy to make and kinda tastes that way if that makes sense..like a fast food kind of dessert"
"1","5","This recipe is one of our favorites. I use fresh whipped cream so it is less sweet and I used homemade brownies."
"1","3","this was ok"
"1","5","Very rich. I doubled the brownies and used french vanilla cool whip. Looks very impressive!"
"1","5","This was GREAT! It was easy to make. Made it for a party and it was gone fast. Thanks for recipe..will make again."
"1","5","This is a very rich and yummy dessert. The members of my book club loved it! I sprinkled the top with mini chocolate chips and chopped nuts."
"1","5","AMAZING i doubbled the brownies i used dunken hines brownie mix they are very chewy and i also sliced and dried fresh strawberries i put them between the two creams and i kinda stuck them around the glass bowl it looked really pretty and i chushed a score bar on top"
"1","5","Excellent recipe, we all loved it! If you like your brownies real fudgy like we do, make sure to cut them into very small bites because they get pretty firm. Fantastic....Thanks."
"1","5","YUM! To address the sweetness problem, I used angel food cake instead of brownies. It was just perfect!"
"1","5","Delicious! My family loved the trifle and it was gone in a flash! I cooked my brownies for the least amount of time so that they were nice and gooey, this probably helped the pudding flavor soak in.I also added chopped milk chocolate Hershey's to the pudding. Yum! I think, as with every trifle, it tastes best after sitting for a day or so. This trifle is very rich, so only the brave hearted sugar addicts should eat it (like me, ha!) Five Star trifle that is a snap to make!"
"1","5","I've made this trifle many times now and it NEVER disappoints!!!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe. I have made this several times and everyone loves it. I have also used white chocolate pudding with this recipe,and came out just as good!"
"1","5","MMMMmmm good."
"1","5","This is devine. Made it the first time for a graduation party it was gone in minutes! Next party~ I made two!"
"1","5","This was so easy to make and the presentation was great, too! Everyone at work asked for the recipe."
"1","5","This is a fabulous recipe! I also shredded the chocolate part of andes mints to the top to give it a minty kick. My Thanksgiving guests went crazy over it! There were no leftovers! It was wicked good!!!!!! I am making it again for a company event next week!"
"1","5","I've made this recipe 3 times now and it is always a huge hit. If I'm feeling like having something a little less rich, I simply replace the brownie mix with regular chocolate cake mix. Either way, it always goes very quickly"
"1","5","I wish I could say this was good, but I can't. I made this for a family get-together and it was GONE before I got to try any of it!!! Everyone raved and I have been asked to make it again. Maybe I will get some next time! :)"
"1","5","If you want to be the star of any company or group gathering, make this dessert. I made this for a church function and got rave reviews. It was interesting how many thought I made an icecream dessert. It had the appearance of creamy soft-serve icecream but tasted like a chocolate dream. I called this dessert, 'Heaven in a bowl'."
"1","5","This was simple to make & so pretty. I tokk it to a work party and brought home an empty bowl! Yum-yum!!"
"1","5","This was fabulous! I served it at a BBQ and the bowl was nearly licked clean! It was easy and delicious, and I will make it again!"
"1","4","Easy and Yummy! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","This is a beautiful dessert. Everyone enjoyed it. It is very very very very sweet.A little goes along way with this dessert. I would make this again for a special occasion but not on an every day basis. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","Just gorgeous looking. I too used fresh whip instead of frozen. What an eye-pleaser! Next time I would underbake the brownies, as especially the brownies at the side of the pan got quite crunchy and I think it'd be just fine to leave them soft or gooey."
"1","5","this KILLS at slumber parties!!!"
"1","5","I had some of this leftover the day that I went to pick fresh strawberries and instead of putting the strawberries over a yellow cake that I made for my bf, who isn't very into chocolate, we ended up splitting the leftovers with sliced strawberries on top. I would recommend not sugaring them though, as it would be too sweet and the trifle doesn't need any more moisture. Would be great with fresh strawberries layered in as well. Overall, great recipe, don't be afraid to experiment with it- Definitely worth buying a trifle bowl for!"
"1","3","I am the world's biggest chocoholic and sweet freak but this was too rich even for me. I think it would probably be less rich if next time I cut the condensed milk in half.Overall,it was an ok dessert."
"1","4","This was very good but so rich. After I tasted it I ended up serving it over Vanilla Bean ice cream to cut the richness a bit."
"1","5","Awesome. Sweet but a great ending to a special meal."
"1","5","This was so easy and a real hit. I had to copy the recipe for my mother in law. Thanks!"
"1","5","This trifle was a huge hit. I've made it twice so far and both times I came home with an empty bowl. It is excellent."
"1","5","Made this with homemade brownies and real whipping cream and it was decadent. Have used crushed Heath bars and chopped snickers bars, both are excellent. Beautiful dessert!"
"1","5","Brilliant recipe.. I used fudge brownie mix.. Only problem I had was that I had to defrost the Cool Whip completely to spread well. My guests loved it and my kids finished it!! Easy to do."
"1","5","This is the most awesome chocolate dessert! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","What can I say about this recipe other than I made it twice in one week, once was for a dinner party with friends and the next for a work holiday party and both times it went within 1/2 hr. I put skor bar througout each layer of the trifle!! I also used boxed brownie mix with hershey bar pieces in the mix!! Fabulous!"
"1","5","I got a cool trifle bowl for a wedding present and wanted to use it. This is the most awsome dessert! It is so good. I took it to school and it was gone in an hour. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","This recipe was such a great hit at Thanksgiving that everyone made me promise to make it again at Christmas. It is fabulous!!"
"1","5","OOOOOMMMMMGGGGGG... This was Heavenly!   The brownies definatly make this 100 times better then the traditional Trifle that most people make w/ cake mix.   I read the reviews and although this is very rich I must have the biggest sweet tooth ever b/c I didn't think this was too sweet at all. The only things I did differently was to get dark chocolate pudding mix and I made the fudge type brownies according to the brownie directions and I used toffee pieces and carmel sauce to just add that extra 'zing' to the dessert. This is a very rich dessert so alittle goes a long way and since your not eating as much it's definatly better to make for a larger gathering! But every single person who tried this for Thanksgiving loved it and told me I must make it again for Christmas. This is definatly a Keeper! THANKS!!!!"
"1","5","Sooooo rich and soooooo good! We LOVED it!"
"1","5","We loved this recipe. I made it for a cookout and everyone said it was wonderful. My husband cleaned up the leftovers that night."
"1","5","super easy!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!!!"
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for many years now. I follow it exactly as written for my guests and then make one using gluten free ingredients for myself;)I have been asked again to make it for Thanksgiving this year. It is by far the most popular dessert at the dinner!"
"1","5","AWESOME! I brought this in to my office (about 20 people), and didn't announce that it was in the refrigerator until 10:00 AM....it was gone by 11:00 AM...."
"1","5","To die for! If you are craving chocolate, you will not be disappointed with this recipe!"
"1","5","Brownies...whipped cream...chocolate pudding...candy bars.... How can you go wrong??? A WINNER, and a GREAT dessert for a crowd..."
"1","5","very rich and delicious!!!!"
"1","5","This dessert was great! I needed to bring a dessert to a company potluck, but had very little time to spare. This was a big hit and took me about 5-10 minutes of actual prep time."
"1","4","I guess you have to be a choco-holic to like this one. My husband and I thought it was too much and too rich. I'd rather use my trifle bowl for colorful fruit desserts."
"1","5","This was a great dessert! I made it for Easter dinner and there was none left. I thought there wasn't going to be enough but it was very rich."
"1","5","This is the best recipie for any time! I made 3 desserts at Thanksgiving & this one was the favorite! In fact, I've made it several times since & it never lasted more than 2 days, it's so good! Easy to make too! It's now the favorite in my household!"
"1","3","It was really easy to make, and great for a last minute desert. However, i found it a bit too sweet, and the pudding layer becomes quite runny."
"1","5","It takes patience to wait, but oh my... it's well worth it! This is a family favorite"
"1","5","Easy and fabulous! I didn't change a thing and the family was literally fighting over it and the dish was empty in no time. My only complaint is that it didn't layer nicely, the pudding layer seeped through the brownies so it looked messy in the trifle bowl. No matter, it was great."
"1","5","This dessert has a NICE presentation when served in a nice glass bowl or trifle dish. After you start scooping it is a huge glob of gooieness though! I used double chocolate brownies and added one layer of strawberries in the middle. Next time I will you use a little less whip cream. So easy to prepare. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","This dessert was SO very very good! The only problem I had was it was sort of messy putting together, other than that it was super easy and just really good. My husband couldn't get enough of it! I would make this again in a second!"
"1","5","My brownie-lover friend loved it. My picky husband loved it too, and he said he could eat the whole bowl himself. Great for people who like brownies and chocolate."
"1","4","Everyone loved it! It's extremely sweet and a little goes a long way. I think I will make this for Thanksgiving. MMMMMMMMM"
"1","5","Perfect. My family and our guests went nuts over this one. It looks pretty, too, until you serve it. Once it's removed from the bowl, it becomes a mixed blob of colors on the plate. But don't let that stop you from making this. It tastes SO good. It's really, really rich -- so if rich chocolaty desserts aren't your thing, stay away from this one -- or serve yourself just a tiny bit."
"1","5","So easy to make - next time I might add a little kalhua or Bailey's to the chocolate pudding mixture!!!"
"1","5","This recipe was delicious! I prepared it for a family get together, and it received rave reviews (especially from my 4 year old). I added the crushed toffee bars as a layer, too."
"1","5","Put this delicious concoction in your prettiest bowl, and don't forget the chocolate shavings on top. They'll think you spent hours on this. Delicious, fool-proof, and heavily requested! A sure hit!"
"1","5","The recipe was easy to make and tasted great!"
"1","5","YUMMY!!!! We added a layer of fresh raspberries to the recipe. Our whole family loved it!"
"1","5","I can't say enough about this recipe! My niece made it for us, and the next day I was at her house picking up the leftovers...bowl & all! It's the best"
"1","5","I made this for a baby shower - it was a hit!! I've had several people ask for the recipe since then. Even though I had plenty of food, and everyone said they were stuffed by the time dessert was served, there was barely a brownie left at the end of the shower!"
"1","3","This is a impressive, and easy recipie to make.  Defiantly a crowd pleaser!"
"1","5","Yum, yum, yum! This is not only beautiful to look at, it is delicious. I served this to guests and they loved it."
"1","3","My husband and I consider this to be a fair recipe. It was easy to prepare, but it's not the best we've ever tasted, not the worst either. As far as kid friendly, none of our grandchildren we're here to give their opinion. I would rather prepare something that takes time with a great taste, as to prepare something that's easy and so, so. I doubt if I'll make it again."
"1","5","Very delicious! I would recommend doubling the recipe for a large crowd...it goes quick! I also added chopped walnuts to my brownie mix and topped it off with cherries! Try making it with fat free products...just as good!"
"1","5","I made this at Christmas and everyone loved it. I put in a layer of heath bar pieces and it made it even better! Next time, I'll add more pudding."
"1","4","This is really yummy! My coworkers went nuts over it!"
"1","5","This trifle was a big hit! It was easy to assemble and looked like I really fussed. I've had several requests for the recipe already. I am going to make it again for a family gathering this weekend and I'm sure they are going to love it!"
"1","5","Instant hit!!!!"
"1","5","EXCELLENT!!!! I made this recipe using my own brownie recipe and sprinkled orange flavoured shaved chocolate over top. This gave it a nice orange flavouring. Served it to guests on night and it was so good they took some home."
"1","5","Absolutely fabulous!"
"0","4","Recipe was very easy to make but turned out very sweet. If I make it again, I would mix one box of chocolate and one box of vanilla instant pudding (following instructions on boxes for making). I would skip altogether the water, sweetened condensed milk and the 8 oz Cool Whip. This hopefully cuts down on the sweetness."
"0","5","use parve milk when making it kosher. use parve whip cream too."
"0","5","Everyone loved this. I made for 1 of many Christmas desserts and will be making again. My only substitution was the candy. I used Andes Mint Crumbles. Fantastic!"
"0","5","This was a great dessert. I used fat free cheesecake pudding instead of chocolate. Whole family loved it."
"0","5","Super easy and a big hit! Thanks!"
"0","5","Fabulous recipe! Very impressive to take to friends. I made the following changes. 1 cup of heavy cream and 3 tbsp whipped together and added to chocolate pudding mixture instead of cool whip and chopped Reese's peanut butter cups instead of chocolate bars added to each layer. My guests couldn't quit raving about this!!"
"0","5","Omg very addicting dessert. Only change I will make next time is doubling everything but the brownie mix and shaved chocolate as I want thicker layers."
"0","5","I'm not a big sweet eater but this was absolutely delicious! So good that I had 2 helpings. A little on the rich side but I will definitely be making it again. Unlike some of the other reviews, I didn't tweak anything. It's amazing just as is!!!!"
"0","5","I showed this recipe to my friend who is a pastry chef, and she suggested one little simple change that will put it over the top. Instead of using 1/2 cup of water, she suggested using cold coffee. She said it will bring out the chocolate flavor and add richness. Next time I make this I am going to try that. Even as the recipe is written, it is 5 star delicious!"
"0","5","This is a regular request for birthday desserts in my family. It is a hit every time I take it somewhere. I am always asked for the recipe. I never take leftovers home with me which makes my family sad."
"0","4","I made this recipe with a Halloween twist for a small get together with friends. I followed the recommendations of users and whipped 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream until fluffy; this was folded into the water/pudding/condensed milk - this layer becomes thick and almost custard-like and contrasted nicely with the whipped cream layers. As I was concerned about the 'processed taste' of cool whip, I whipped a second 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream for the whipped cream layers. These were whipped in divided doses (two 1/4 pints). The first batch was whipped with 1 tbsp powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and orange food colouring. The second was whipped with 1 tsp powdered sugar, as I didn't want this layer to be overwhelmingly sweet. I didn't have a trifle dish, so I layered the trifle into a deep glass bowl. It may have been due to the size of the bowl (although it was only medium sized), I was wishing I had more of all the layers; I was forced to carefully ration and spread each layer, because I didn't have enough. Next time, I will ensure to increase the recipe (or at least the pudding abdominal whipped topping layers) by 50-100% to avoid this mishap (unless making a smaller trifle). Nevertheless, I made it work. I layered brownie with few dispersed candy corns, pudding mix, orange vanilla flavoured sweet cream, brownie & candy corns, pudding mix, plain whipped cream, topped with a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder and candy corn.   This is a delicious but very heavy dessert"
"0","5","I have made this recipe with instant pudding mix and Cool Whip, but it is way better if you make homemade whipped cream and homemade chocolate custard. Add layers of raspberries to make it truly brilliant; I gave it 5 stars if you make it the way I recommend. Otherwise, it tastes, well, like Cool whip and instant pudding, if you like those flavors."
"0","5","My coworkers loved this so much when I brought this on top of the banana trifle I normally bring. It's even better when I added a homemade caramel sauce on top of the brownies.  Warning though, it's very rich, but EXTREMELY delicious!"
"0","5","Awesome! Great reviews!"
"0","5","I brought this dessert in a trifle bowl to an event, and it got rave reviews. I was short on time, so used 2 pkgs of Two Bite Brownies for the brownies, and I used Mousse instead of the pudding. It would delicious! I didn't want to totally double the recipe, but needed alot, so used more cool whip than the recipe called more. You could use alot of different variations, like Heath Bar on the top and so forth, but it's definitely a keeper."
"0","5","I think my chocolate pudding was too much but overall. IT WAS GREAT!"
"0","5","Thank you for this recipe!"
"0","5","Fairly easy to make it looks great just put in fridge will post when i taste it thanks"
"0","3","It is good, but very rich! I might try it again another time with angel food cake instead of brownie...that might lighten it up a little."
"0","4","really, really good. Quick and easy, but hoping to adapt it with more whole foods and less boxed ingredients for next time."
"0","4","Was soo good. On the rich side but good"
"0","5","Everyone loved this!"
"0","5","I have made this several times now and EVERYONE loves it. I use regular milk instead of sweetened condensed milk and dark chocolate chips instead of a crushed candy bar b/c it is VERY sweet. It's a delight though and now my go to trifle!!!"
"0","4","Really easy. I used a bit less whipped topping, and chopped a Heath candy bar on top. Very rich, but tasty!"
"0","5","I used caramel brownies. OMG yum"
"0","4","If you have a sweet tooth in the family this is a great recipe. Beware its super rich so a little goes a long way!"
"0","5","This recipe was for sure a complete, total hit with my family. I made this dessert for Christmas, and I put a FAKE poinsetta flower on the top for decoration. It definetly got that 'ohh ahh' reaction. I used heath peices of candy and everyone LOVED it. I baked brownies with chocolate chip peices inside so there was an extra crunch factor. I am saving this recipe for another time =)"
"0","4","This was very good and easy to make. I used Ghiradelli brownies dark choco, so yummy!!!!"
"0","5","This is my boyfriend's absolute favorite!! I made it using chocolate fudge brownies and chocolate fudge pudding- power couple for sure. So easy to make, impressive looking, and delicious!"
"0","5","I did make my brownies from scratch. I also made my whipped cream for the second layer, but I did get lazy and use Cool Whip for the Cool Whip layer. I think it was delicious like that, but next time I think I will make my own whipped cream for the Cool Whip layer as well. It's just so much better than way! This desert is amazing!"
"0","5","I've made this twice, with variations, and it was wonderful. The first time I used toffee bits instead of a candy bar. The second time I decided to make a Christmas variation. I used sugar cookies instead of brownies, and I added a few drops of mint flavoring to the pudding mixture. Instead of a candy bar, I used crushed candy canes and chocolate chips. I sprinkled crushed candy canes on top. Pretty and gorgeous!"
"0","2","This was SO rich. Might be good if it had something to break up the richness"
"0","5","This was amazing!"
"0","5","This was a HUGE hit. We used the fudge version of the brownies, and kit kats for our chocolate bar. It was a great Christmas Day dessert after our awesome meal!"
"0","2","We had several brownies left over from Holiday function so my daughter and her best friend made this. Even they thought it tasted 'store bought'. It was all fake chocolate and cool whip flavor. I do not recommend this recipe. There are wonderful true trifle recipes on this sight. Take the time to make one of those."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","4","Taste-wise a 5. Way too rich for for some of my guests but overall a big hit. It makes a ton. I used fun sized Butterfingers."
"0","4","It was a hit at the party, but I felt it was too sweet. I think some sort of cream cheesy layer would cut the sweetness well. It was beautiful though."
"0","5","I tried this and it was delicious. I did make some changes I used heavy whipping cream and half and half instead of condensed milk. Also I added strawberries and used Ghirardelli Brownies as the base."
"0","4","I made the pudding following the directions on the box minus a half cup of milk then substituted the other half cup with a half cup of sour cream, it's less sweet without the condensed milk and also I added 1tsp coffee crystals in the brownie mix. WONDERFUL"
"0","5","Very good."
"0","4","This was an easy, tasty dessert that also looked great! I substituted layers of strawberries for the 12 oz of whipped cream - so mine was brownies, the pudding layer, strawberries/blueberries as the layers and was really happy with it!"
"0","5","I made this trifle according to the recipe after reading all of the wonderful variations. The recipe as listed is AMAZING! I do look forward to trying the different variations as well."
"0","3","I tried to follow the recipe as it was and the pudding mixture was gooey and clumpy. I ended up using another recipe to make chocolate mousse and used that in place of the pudding mixture and it was really good."
"0","5","I fixed this for Valentines Day and my BF loved it. It really isn't too sweet and much better after being in the fridge a day or two. I will be making this again. I did use skor candy bars chopped - already in the bag and I also drizzled the caramel topping over the brownie chunks. It was very good. Make sure you have lots of people to share it with otherwise you will eat more of it than you want! Thank you for sharing the recipe."
"0","5","Excellent. Light and delicious."
"0","4","I agree with others in that this recipe 'needed something' to make it complete, otherwise it would have just been a chocolate cool whip treat with a little brownie on top. Of course I didn't have the fancy ingredients that other reviewers had recommended but also I am always accommodating the needs of a little one that has peanut allergies so instead I made a quick fix and it was good. Fix #1 - I only mixed half of the cool whip called for into the pudding mixture to cut down on the fluffiness; Fix #2 - I layered as follows Brownie, pudding mixture, brownie, pudding mixture and cool whip on top. I would have added a third layer of a rich fudgy syrup over the brownie but we had to serve it on the side again to accommodate food allergies. This way it tasted more like a rich gooey brownie treat with a little cool whip on top. The contrast between the cool whip and brownie wasn't as harsh this way. Yes, I know, not true to original recipe but this worked for us."
"0","5","This was soooo good. I took it to a cook out and everyone loved it. There was none left!!"
"0","3","It's better if you use a cake mix instead, and Thankyou Brand pudding.I drizzle about 1/2 cup of Irish Cream on the cake layers before I put the pudding layer on and then sprinkle crushed Heath Candy bars on top of each layer of Cool Whip. The cake isn't as heavy as the brownie is, so you can eat a lot more of it."
"0","5","A definite crowd pleaser. Plan to leave the leftovers (if there are any) with your host, and possibly the recipe too!"
"0","5","Quick, easy and delicious! I sprinkle toffee bits to top layer."
"0","5","Just added some fresh sliced strawberries, lots of 'em, to each layer - gorgeous and delish addition!"
"0","5","LOVE THIS RECIPE! Once you make it, be prepared to make it AGAIN and AGAIN! I've made this trifle at least 20 times - it's requested at each and every church function. Ignore suggestions to modify the recipe, as it's just perfect as written (and extremely easy to make). Looks almost too pretty to eat in a trifle bowl, especially with melted milk chocolate drizzled on top! :)"
"0","5","Wow! This was really wonderful! Very rich and delicious! I did save a few calories by using sugar-free pudding and light whipped topping. Also didn't have the chocolate bar for garnish so used Oreo cookie crumbles instead which worked very well. Will certainly make again!"
"0","5","I made this for a family dinner and it was a HUGE success! I have three adult sons, two daughter-in-laws, husband and myself and we STILL had half leftover. It is RICH and DELICIOUS for not a lot of effort. I followed ROXANNE'S modifications because they sounded GREAT! It was! Thanks for the terrific recipe!"
"0","5","i made this for christmas! People loved it. i took some advice like using the heavy whipping cream and awesome! also i used vanilla flavored cool whip instead of regular and it was good but i didnt like it so much it added more sugary taste. overall everyone love it but note to self use regular cool whip:) but if you have a sweet tooth then definately use vanilla!"
"0","5","i made this for my family it didnt last one hour before it was gone..so i took it to our next party same thing it didnt last...it is soooo good."
"0","4","This was good!! The only set back is that the brownie pieces were a bit too hard for my grandmother. I also added caramel sauce (drizzled heavily)and crushed heath bar pieces on top of each whip topping layer. DELICIOUS!!!!!"
"0","4","A success! However, my family and I found it a tad too sweet. Perhaps, next time, I might replace the brownies with something else! Worth a try, even just once!"
"0","5","I followed many people's advice and did not add cool whip to the pudding but instead whipped heavy whipping cream. I also added a layer of raspberries on top. I did put a very small layer of cool whip between the pudding/cream mixture and the raspberries for color variation."
"0","5","I have been told not to make this again by my husband, because he couldn't stop eating it :) I followed other's suggestions of using whipping cream with the pudding mix, toffee bits, caramel, and french vanilla cool whip. I also used homemade brownies, but it would have good with a good boxed brownie too. Since there's no fruit, it didn't get soggy the next day, and in fact was just as good for at least 3 days after making (that's as long as it lasted around here). I'll be making this easy, delicious recipe again soon!"
"0","5","This has become the replacement for my birthday cakes in our house (my OWN birthdays, that is). The one change I make, which another user here mentioned, is to replace one layer of the whipped topping with the French Vanilla flavored topping. I'd also suggest that you use/make brownies that are 'cakey' enough to be able to soak a lot of the pudding and cream. And a brownie with chocolate chips or chunks in it is nice, because having them in some of your bites makes for a nice contrast in textures.  Also, make the day before and let it sit in the fridge to give the brownies a chance to soak up more of the creams and pudding."
"0","5","This is really good! I doubled the recipe to make a huge amount for a cookout. The only thing I did different was use real whipping cream, and used brownies with nuts in them. Make sure to make it a day ahead so the pudding can set up. Will be making this again!"
"0","4","This was good but very vey sweet."
"0","5","This is an easy dessert and big hit with everyone. I used angel food cake in place of the brownies. It made it very light dessert and not too sweet. It was a perfect end to Thanksgiving dinner."
"0","5","I've made this several times and it is always a hit! I like to substitute the candy for chocolate chip-chunks, delish!"
"0","5","I make one of these every Thanksgiving and/or Christmas & everyone absolutely loves it! My family pretty much demands that I make one. It is delicious!!"
"0","5","This was super easy recipe and tasted great!"
"0","5","I make this for nearly every event that I need to bring a dessert. If I venture out and make something different, I disappoint the crowd. I mix it up a little and add different candy toppings. Sometimes peanut butter cups other times Snickers. The only problem is there is never enough:)"
"0","5","Love it!"
"0","5","YUM YUM YUM!!! I have made this dish about 5 times already...so delish!! My husband requests this all time time and he doesn't have as much of a sweet tooth as I do so I was surprised he raved about it so much. I added some fresh cut strawberries which gives it a great flavor and really gives a beautiful presentation. I also took the advice of another reviewer and made fresh whipped cream in lieu of the prepackaged. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I added seasonal cool whip."
"0","5","Ive always made mine with vanilla pudding, and crushed up butterfingers as the candy bar. Ive never had leftovers taking it to any function!!!!"
"0","5","My daughter and friend insisted that I give this dessert 5 stars. My husband called it decadent and it was an all around big hit! The preparation was easy enough for anyone to make :O)"
"0","5","One of the best I have made. It was gone in a snap. So easy and you really can't mess it up."
"0","5","Add some crushed heath bars on top of the cool whip layer."
"0","5","Had this for dessert at super bowl party - it was a huge hit. I had never made a trifle before, so was a little worried. I did use the french vanilla cool whip and think it was a good choice. Will definitely be making this for office parties."
"0","5","It's a hit everywhere I take it"
"0","3","delicious, but i will defineletly skip out on the condensed milk next time, it is already sooo sweet"
"0","5","This was a HUGE hit this Thanksgiving! Something new to the dessert table. The kids loved it. I will make this an usually go to dessert. Thanks"
"0","5","This recipe is excellent! Family favorite, great for big dinners/potlucks."
"0","3","I made this for my book club ladies, following the suggestion to use chocolate pudding (not instant) and wgipping cream. also used Baileys. next time I will not include the condensed milk, it was too rich for most of us."
"0","5","supreme!!!! i didn't use cool whip i whipped my own cream... i made the brownies from scratch and since i couldn't find the pudding mix, i made cornstarch pudding also from allrecipes... i made the brownies a day before and cut them into cubes while it was still warm, covered with plastic wrap and left them on the counter. layered it in the morning, and used mars chocolate bar since they are my favorite!!! everyone loved it!!!! i made it for my husbands surprise birthday party and it was the highlight of the evening!!!"
"0","5","excellent and a great party dish. I throw heath bar bits in between the layers for extra flavor."
"0","5","What a fun and time-saving recipe! Followed some of the user recommendations to tweak a bit: Used store-bought brownies (one package iced, one package uniced), used cheesecake pudding instead of chocolate, used homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip, excluded sweetened condensed milk and candy, drizzled caramel sauce on each layer of whipped cream. Folks could not get enough of it! Next time I will add graham crackers or graham cracker crumbs to it - super yum!"
"0","5","I have made this several times now, everyone just loves it. My mother isn't a big chocolate eater and she loved it. I have made it exactly by the recipe and a few times differently. Once I used chocolate chips in the layers and another time I used a container of Chocolate cool whip instead of the regular mixed in with the chocolate pudding. Loved it that way! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","So easy yet so elegant looking. I served it at a party and no one would be the first to dig into it because they didn't want to ruin it. After I scooped a big dollop out, it was gone...fast!"
"0","5","This was a hit at church supper. Easy to prepare, but very pretty and delicious."
"0","2","I decided that I don't like desserts with Cool Whip and this one has a LOT. Others did like it though."
"0","5","5 stars says it all, this is a great, easy recipe and feeds many!"
"0","5","Made this several times and everyone has loved it! I end up having to make two for family functions and have shared the recipe more times than I can count. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","This is the BEST recipe for chocolate trifles!! I've been using this recipe for years and it is ALWAYS a hit at gatherings."
"0","5","I used King Arthur's Brownie mix (for those of us with allergies). It was AWESOME! Even my picky husband, who doens't like dessert, except silk pie, liked it. I did add vanilla to the one cool whip. I sprinkled with Enjoy Life chocolate chips. Will make again!"
"0","5","This recipe was so easy and so awesome! I didn't have a candy bar on hand (after my Husband ate it) so I used mini chocolate chips on top and added them to my brownies to make them extra fudgy. This recipe is very filling so we are eating it in small portions even though it makes alot!"
"0","5","My mother-in-law made this for my birthday dessert. Wow! It was amazing. I am definitely going to make this myself."
"0","5","THE best trifle recipe ever. I've had countless people fall in love with this dish."
"0","5","Fantastic! Made according to reviews and have been asked for the recipe several times."
"0","5","Delicious! Made it exactly as written. Even the grown ups came back for seconds."
"0","4","Yummy!!! We have weekly dinners with all my brothers and sisters and I made this a few months back and every one enjoyed. Not our fav Trifel but a yummy change!!"
"0","5","This was great! I made double chocolate brownies from scratch for the recipe, but I think what made it really good was the chocolate pudding mixture, which I followed exactly but mixed in a block of cream cheese...it was amazing! I also drizzled caramel sundae syrup over the brownie peices, as suggested by another reviewer. Oh, and I also used the extra creamy cool whip which made it nice and rich. Thanks for the recipe; I will definitely make it again!"
"0","5","this was amazing"
"0","5","Oh my goodness, this is awesome. Perfect for serving a large crowd. This was one of the desserts I made for my daughter's engagement party and it was a definate hit."
"0","5","I found this recipe on here several years ago and have been making it ever since. The first time I made it my hubby fell in love, as did I. I have made this for several family functions and everyone raved over this. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and this tasted wonderful!! It looks just as good as it tastes! I will def. be making this many more times in the future!"
"0","3","very good reciepe"
"0","5","I made this with ROXANNE323's suggestions, and it is very good. I mixed up the whipping cream/pudding and put it in a covered container because I didn't want to make the whole trifle just yet, but I wanted one for myself. Everything is in its respective container if I want to make more mini-trifles or one bigger trifle. Keeping the ingredients on hand would be a good way to ensure a quick dessert if needed. I'm having mine right now, and it's a very indulgent but oh-so-worth-it snack. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"0","5","This rocks!"
"0","5","I made this with the versions of the Baileys and the whipping cream instead of the fozen whipped topping. It was a MAJOR hit!"
"0","5","Easy. No Fuss. My 'Go-To' Chocolate parfait recipe!"
"0","5","This is absolutely divine! I have made this twice for two different parties and recieved huge praise! The first time I made it, I added strawberries on the top of each cool whip layer, which was delcious, but my strawberries started going bad the next day, so I don't think we were able to finish the leftovers. The 2nd time I made it, I added chocolate syrup and caramel sauce on top of the brownie layers and then on top for decoration! That was absolutely amazing!!! I highly suggest giving it a try!"
"0","5","This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious! Thank you!"
"0","4","I have made this recipe now several times and every time it is a huge hit! I have also made alterations and use real whip cream and sugar. Because I love short cuts I do use Two Bite Brownies instead of making them - Yum!! I too add Skor bits but also put in some Butterscotch syrup as it adds a lovely texture to the trifle. Last alteration, I dress it up with fresh strawberries when in season! Great recipe to play with and make your own - thanks for the base!!!"
"0","4","Great dessert! It has everything I love (chocolate and, pudding, and whipped cream) rolled into one! To make this recipe 5 stars, I'd take the advice of some of the other reviews and replace the cool whip layer with actual homemade whipped cream (made from heavy whipping cream and some sugar). The flavor made a huge difference...much more sophisticated. As a twist, I also made this with a layer of sliced strawberries and I really enjoyed it. The only thing about adding fresh fruit, however, is that the leftovers don't refridgerate as well."
"0","5","Every year, my grandma makes this for Christmas. And I LOVE it! It's so chocolaty and sweet and creamy and yummy. It's a little rich, so i try to not to eat too much but it's hard not to eat a whole lot because this is soooo good!!!!! :)"
"0","5","Super easy to make and a big hit. Looks very impressive."
"0","5","Everyone loves this for special occasions. It is easy to make and very eyecatching. I like the fact that it can be made ahead. I make it the day before serving.Yummy!"
"0","5","Wow! This is a great recipe. I did follow the advice of others and make my own whipped cream. I also make my brownies with Milkways, so drizzled a bit more caramel sauce over the brownie layer. It is defiantely rich, but soooo worth it. Rave reviews from all my friends. One of my new favorite recipes for guests and family."
"0","5","I rarely do reviews, but I had to rave about this one! This is incredibly yummy and even tasted better the next day. I had never mixed dry pudding mix w/ sweetened condensed milk...sensational! Next time, I'm going to add Heath bits to the layers for an extra crunch! :)"
"0","5","If you love chocolate or know someone who does, this recipe is great!"
"0","5","This became an instant favorite in our house. I always have people ask for the recipie when I make this and my kids ask me to make it all the time!"
"0","5","Everyone loved it! I did add carmel to it and it made it that much more delicious. Good recipe to take to a BBQ."
"0","5","this really was delicious!"
"0","5","I made this for a Memorial Day family outing and it was a HUGE hit!! I made my own whipped cream but Cool Whip would be easier. it is VERY rich but so worth it!! I also added some Chocolate Toffee chips as a layer also."
"0","4","many others loved it.. i found it good but not great..."
"0","3","Not that good."
"0","5","Excellent! I added Heath Crunch bits and caramel over the brownie layers. A ring of walnuts to the outter top layer and in the center A huge heep of finely shaved chocolate. Took this to a block party where it was a sensation! Also used all fat free sugar free ingredients if available for a slightly lower calorie count."
"0","5","Very rich, but very delicious. I used carmel syrup and heath bits instead of candy bars. I would like to try it with a little less carmel and possiblly vanilla pudding to make it a a little less chocolatey, but it is excellent as is too."
"0","5","AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! we made this the day before easter and had it after easter dinner. some wimps couldnt handle the sugar but us real dessert lovers couldnt get enough! this is a keeper!"
"0","4","This is easy to make and very delicious. But it is extremely rich."
"0","5","Oh my gosh, this is pure heaven in a bowl! And very very versatile! Make as as is... OR... replace brownies with angel food cake or pound cake, use vanilla, cheesecake, or lemon pudding instead of chocolate, and add berries!"
"0","5","YUM!!!!! This was a huge hit at Easter!"
"0","4","This recipe is very rich, but very good! I followed other's advice and added the toffee pieces and the caramel. I also made my own whipped cream for one of the layers. Everyone loved this and I have shared the recipe with numerous people. It's definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","I made this for Valentines Day and it was really good. You have to like chocolate and whip cream to like this."
"0","3","This was okay. I won't make it again though. To me there was too much pudding / whip cream and it left an icky film in my mouth after eating. :-( And I can't believe I'm saying this, but this was even too sweet for me!"
"0","5","So easy, and so awesome !! Too make it even easier I used 2 store-bought marble pound cakes. I also used a 16 oz size whipped cream. (instead of 12) You can never have too much Cool Whip! YUM..."
"0","5","Loved this trifle"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! This was such a hit when I made it that I am getting request to bring it to other events/gatherings."
"0","5","This was delicious!! Although, we layered ours a little differently. The first 2 layers were the same but then we combined 2 (8 oz) frozen whipped toppings for the 3rd layer because we couldn't find the 12oz. Then we followed that with the other half of the pudding mix and then the rest of the brownies. Everyone raved about it!!"
"0","5","AMAZING!! So Delicious. I couldn't find the vanilla cool whip, and so I decided to use homemade whipped cream for both the cool whips called for. I do not regret it! It actually sat in my fridge for 3 days before we ate it (tempting me the whole time!) and when we finally ate it, I couldn't believe how thick and mousse-like the chocolate pudding and whipped cream were. I think letting it sit a long time contributed to that. We loved it!"
"0","5","This was amazing! I don't like Cool Whip so I made my own whipped cream. I would definitely make this again."
"0","3","The type brownies probably make a huge difference, but, this just wasn't that good. The mixture was not as creamy as I had hoped either."
"0","4","This scored in at a 4.5 by my hubbie. Made this for a dish to pass at a super bowl party and went over well. I used reduced fat brownie mix, fat free cool whip, fat-free sweetened condensed milk. I drizzled a little bit of carmel topping on the layers of brownie (a little will go along way) and crushed up a few heath candy bars and sprinkled them on the brownie layer for extra crunch. This is very rich but definitely hits the spot for chocolate lovers! It filled up my trifle bowl to the top."
"0","5","Great dessert! It was one of the desserts i made for christmas and everyone one loved it and was hogging it to theirselves!I didnt even get to taste it!"
"0","5","My friend makes requests for this trifle. I made it for dinner and everyone asked if they could take some home. I like to make it the day before, the brownies soak up more moisture and melt in your mouth."
"0","4","good but awfully rich..."
"0","5","My trifle bowl got a workout over the holidays because I made this 3 times in 2 weeks for different crowds and everyone loved it. It turned out perfectly every time. I used 1/2 pint whipping cream mixed with the pudding instead of another Cool Whip llike someone suggested. Rich and delicious!!"
"0","5","I have made a lot of truffles in the past couple of years but this one is my favorite. I made it just as the recipe called except I added a little bit of milk in the jello mixture and also added a layer of canned cherries. So good!!! I took it to my parents on Christmas day for the dessert and everyone just loved it."
"0","5","I made this recipe yesterday for New Year's Day dinner. OMG...it was the biggest hit! I used the Bits of Brickle on top of the Cool Whip for a little crunch. It is absolutely decadent!! Everybody loved it! I will make this over and over again. It would be wonderful with crushed Oreo's on top, drizzled with hot fudge, caramel. You are only limited by your imagination and taste. It is awesome just the way it is! Thank you so much to the person who sent in this recipe!!! What a winner! I'm not a dessert person, but this one got me!"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! Super easy! Took this to our family Christmas party! Such a beautiful display! Looked just like the picture! Next time I will add some nuts or use a brownie mix w/nuts. Fantastic! Thanks!"
"0","5","This was just awsome! It makes a lovely presentation and is easy to make. Rave reviews from many at a Christmas party. Thanks"
"0","5","I made the recipe exactly as it said. I didn't even get to try it because it went so fast! I couldn't believe how quickly it disapeared. Nobody could believe how simple the recipe was. I will be making this again."
"0","5","Great dessert! I made individual trifles and added strawberries. They were a huge hit! Im making this again for a Holiday party tomorrow but in a trifle bowl this time instead of the individuals. I also decided to double up on all the ingredients since I found there wasnt a whole lot last time. This is so easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser!"
"0","4","This tasted very good, but you have to be a chocolate lover! I made my own brownies for the recipe and they were fudgy brownies so it was all very chocolaty! My family members liked it though."
"0","5","Sooo rich! Had it for Thanksgiving as a change of pace and oh my it was perfect! It goes a long way too! Only change was that I used dark chocolate brownies because that is what I had on hand."
"0","5","This is so easy and so delicious! I ended up doubling the chocolate pudding mixture and used 2 containers of whipped topping in order to fill up my bowl with the layers. I put a Hersey bar in the freezer for a couple of hours then shaved it with a knife then sprinkled the shavings over the top. I will definitely be making this over and over again! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I loved this! I didn't use sweetened condensed milk, i just mixed some real milk and the whipped topping until it was pretty thick. This made the dessert not so overpowering. Not to sweet."
"0","5","Very rich, but delicious! I made my own whipped cream (unsweetened) the second time I made it. I have made it several times and everyone always loves it."
"0","3","Too sweet. The condensed milk is what makes it too sweet in my opinion. Next time if I make it I will use the pudding mix with regular milk and add the whipped cream."
"0","4","Quick and easy recipe. I bought a bag of the 2-bite brownies rather than having to make them. i also added chocolate pudding."
"0","3","I made used wipped cream instead of cool whip. I served this to guests and they all loved it along with my husband. It was a bit to sweet for me."
"0","5","Wow. As is, was great!!"
"0","5","Fantastic. Won the Our church dessert contest with this recipe. It is hard to believe their are people who did not like this recipe. Its easy and very tasty. Different tastes for different folks I guess, but in my opinion this dessert was GREAT!"
"0","5","Made just as directed 3 times - and got rave reviews every single time! It is sinful!"
"0","5","I just realized that I had not yet reviewed this recipe! It is very sweet but very good. I didn't have a trifle bowl so I made it in my cake plate/punch bowl combo because I couldn't find another glass bowl that would give the same visual appearance of the layered presentation. I topped it with crushed heath bars for a little added flavor and crunch. It turned out beautifully and everyone really enjoyed this."
"0","4","My husband and I enjoyed this dessert. I followed directions to the exact ingredients. It wasn't too sweet for us. Next time I do think I'll make my own whipping for the pudding mixture and use vanilla cool whip as suggested by others."
"0","5","I made this dessert twice and the bowl came back to me empty both times! Took all the suggestions from Roxanne323. Definitely a dessert I am now known for in the neighborhood. Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","Excellent recipe for chocolate lovers! Brought it to a Labor Day BBQ....it was a big hit!"
"0","5","Made this for a Brownie lover for labor day cook out, it was so pretty I was taking pictures on the camera phone and sending it out..anyway followed all of the directions but added a layer of strawberries into the rotation, which was a mouth watering with all the chocolate. Broke the brownie up in bite size..and instead of toffee or candy bar used mini chocolate chips, SO pretty, SO good!"
"0","5","Made it for my son's 3rd birthday cake and made it at Christmas it was a HUGE HIT!"
"0","5","Made this for a family dinner. Everyone loved it. There was absolutely none left."
"0","5","Big hit at Christmas party"
"0","5","Fabulous topped with strawberries! A great summer dessert!"
"0","3","I did not like the taste of the condensed milk in this trifle at all. I added heavy cream to try to mellow it out. I prefer the Death by Chocolate recipe from this site more, which is almost the same thing as this trifle only way way [in my opinion]. I only tried this one because it had more ratings so I thought it must be better. But I'll be sticking with that one from now on"
"0","5","Unfailing crowd pleaser, every time. Add toffee bits and caramel sauce to make it even more decadent."
"0","5","This is a very rich desert but can be altered a little to make a wonderful summer cookout finisher! I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, light cool whip for the layers and topped with blue berries- I totally left out the chocolate candy because the brownies make this desert rich enough! This a total crowd pleaser!!! Enjoy :)"
"0","5","I get huge compliments for every event I have made this for. Thank you so much for sharing!"
"0","5","My super-picky 14yr old stepdaughter swears that she hates Cool Whip, but she couldn't get enough of this recipe. I made this for the 4th and I am still getting asked for the recipe! :)"
"0","5","Awesome recipe, however, I altered it a bit. I baked the brownies in paper liners in muffin tins. When I removed them, I pressed down the center of each brownie cupcake w/the back of a spoon, making a well. When the brownies cooled, I added the chocolate mousse recipe and added the cool whip on top. Everyone loved them! Debbi"
"0","5","Delicious! This was the first Trifle that I made, super easy. The bowl was scrapped clean. I made my whip cream from scratch which made it extra sweet!"
"0","5","I always get rave reviews for this!"
"0","5","Big hit!!!"
"0","5","This is a great dessert for a big gathering - it makes a lot. The women loved it and wanted the recipe. It is easy to prepare. I did not allow enough refidgerater time and so I put it in the freezer for an hour to speed up the set-up process. It worked great!"
"0","5","Great! I made this for My husbands birthday! He said this was the best desert he has ever had! Try it you will love it!"
"0","5","I have made many trifles in my life....but this is THE BEST! The mousse filling is decadent. If you are looking for healthy, you may want to skip over this, but is you are looking for something sinfully delicious...make it!"
"0","5","Wow. This was amazing. Everyone loved it! Thanks for submitting!"
"0","5","I am making this today for the second time in a week. My family loves it! I followed the advise of a few others and used real whipping cream with my pudding for that layer. It's a new favorite!"
"0","5","Amazing and soo easy!"
"0","5","I substituted mint irish cream liquor (Aldi's brand!) for the water. Heavenly! Will be adding this one into my church/family function dessert rotation!"
"0","5","This was Heaven in a bowl!!!!!!!!!!! I used fresh strawberries to layer also. Can't go wrong with Chocolate and Strawberries! It looked so beautiful in the bowl!! Very good."
"0","5","Outstanding! It's a recipe that looks great and tastes great too. I've made this five or six times and everyone loves it - there's never any left."
"0","5","I made this trifle for my husband to take to a work party. Everyone thought the dish was so pretty and tasted wonderful! I made brownies using the MMMMM...Brownies recipe from this site. I also made the Thick Chocolate Pudding recipe from this site. I topped with a coarsly broken Symphony Toffee & Nut Candy Bar. Making everything from scratch was time consuming, but it tastes so good! I'll be making this trifle again. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","One word - awesome!"
"0","5","I've made this recipe many times and the result was always a clean trifle bowl. I couldn't say enough positive things about this dessert! So easy, yet a masterpiece. Not only is it beautiful, but you can add your favorite toppings, like caramel or hot fudge (drizzled lightly over the top of the brownie layer), toffee bits on top, or even some delicious berries. Try it, you won't regret it!"
"0","4","A chocolate lover's dream! I made minor changes - I used a little less Cool Whip in the layers to make it fit in my serving dish, and I also crumbled up the brownies instead of cutting them into squares. Delicious!"
"0","5","I made this today for Easter dinner dessert. Everybody loved it and my husband couldn't have enough or been prouder (his family). The only changes I made to the recipe is I used mint chocolate pudding and sprinkled Heath toffee pieces between the pudding layer and whipped cream. Came out great and only one serving left in the bowl. Thanks for a great recipe and one so easy to make!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and makes a wonderful display!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! Made this for a dinner party, everyone loved it! Very easy!"
"0","5","I've made this several times for big parties and it's always completely gone!!! When I bake the brownies (with walnuts..yum), I add an extra egg so it's more cake-like and I add heavy whipping cream to the pudding rather than Cool Whip. I add toffee bits to the layers. It's a beautiful, fun and easy dish!"
"0","5","Very good!!! I'd pour the coffee over the cake next time to make the cake more moist (instead I put instant coffee into the pudding mix- good flavour). It almost needed more pudding.....or less cake...good with 1 Skor crushed up onto each whipped cream layer."
"0","5","Lets see... sinful...rich... it's like spoiling yourself after a hard day. One of the best desserts I have ever had, and the best dessert I have ever made."
"0","5","Rich but very good!!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. I keep getting asked to bring it for family potlucks. It's a big hit."
"0","4","Better make sure you have insulin on hand. This one will test your sweet tooth"
"0","4","Delicious, but a bit sweet and I like sweet desserts! Next time I make it I will try it with chocolate cake instead of brownies."
"0","5","This dessert was fabulous. I used real whipping cream and made my own, sweetening with 1 c. confectioners sugar and 1 t. vanilla in place of the tub of cool whip. I added freshed sliced strawberries between the layers since they are in season right now and the splash of color made for such beautiful presentation. This recipe is absolutely decadent and chocolate lovers will go crazy over this one. Be prepared to share the recipe."
"0","5","This is the BEST! Everyone LOVES it! Great for paties or...anything!"
"0","5","cant mess it up!"
"0","5","Great recipe to play with! I made 'Quick and Easy brownies' and 'Hasty Chocolate pudding' from allrecipes to go in my trifle. I layered cubed brownies, caramel sundae sauce, choc pudding, chopped up Mars bars, and real whipped cream. It was beautiful and delicious! Everyone was AMAZED!"
"0","5","This is my husbands favorite dessert! It is so easy and is always a big hit. I like to open a bag of choc. covered toffee chips to sprinkle on top. Delicious!"
"0","5","I've made it twice in the past three weeks. It's been a hit each time!"
"0","5","My family loves this trifle. I get asked to make it at family gatherings each and every time. It is super simple to make."
"0","5","I made this using fat free sweetened condensed mild and lite Cool Whip and everyone still loved it."
"0","4","This trifle is really easy to make and is very tasty. It was almost too sweet for my taste but everyone else raved about it."
"0","4","it was cool i didn't use all the whippped cream in the pudding because it was taking away from the flavor, also i added a little milk to the pudding because it was so thick. i will make this again"
"0","5","chocolate heaven. so delicious. i did make my own whipped cream to replace cool whip, and sprinkled heath bar over any cool whip layer and drizzled caramel on top. without the heath, or the caramel, it would've been way too 'meh'..but WITH those ingredients, it was pefect! people went back for FOURTHS!"
"0","5","This was excellent. Bewar:, this is very rich, very chocolatey. But very good. I did add caramel over the brownies and added chocolate toffee pieces for crunch. It looks nice to when presented in a trifle bowl."
"0","5","I'm not that experienced of a cook, even I made this turn out great and actually made heads turn at the party I took it too. Plus it tastes excellent!!!!"
"0","5","This is great! I make it with devils food cake and after the cake cools I poke holes in it and pour in 1/4 cup of amoretto liqeur. Also, I make the whipped cream from scratch. On top of each layer of whipped cream I sprinkle crumbled up bits of Heath bar, so it ends with the heath bar topping on top."
"0","5","This was awesome! It only gets better as it sits. I was a little worried cause I overbaked my brownies but the got softer with the pudding and cool whip...yummy!!"
"0","5","Oh my goodness, I love this! I made mine only 1 layer of each in a large pan. The family loved it!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe! I did not have a brownie mix so I used a chocolate fudge cake mix instead. I just crumbed the warm cake into a bowl and used it in the layers. It is even better after it has been in the refrigerator over night!! Yummy!!"
"0","5","Divine, heavenly, and other out of this world descriptions. This is so good. It makes a lot, so I have to wait until I need to take a dessert somewhere to make it again. My husband and I do not need to eat this by ourselves, and trust me we would! I used a brownie mix with chocolate chunks and I used French Vanilla flavored cool whip in the layers. Enjoy"
"0","5","Looks great, simple to make, and tastes outstanding"
"0","5","I made this recipe for the first time for thanksgiving. It was AMAZING! My family loved it and so did I. It looks great and tastes even better. It went so fast i made another."
"0","5","Easy and delicious! Great dessert for the chocolate lover!"
"0","5","There is a friend at work that gave me a recipe really similar to this one except she cruples peanut butter cups in one of the layers. It's so good!"
"0","5","With this many delicious ingredients, how can you go wrong? I've made it several times and it's always fantastic."
"0","5","No other way to say it, this is the best trifle I have ever had. I used sliced strawberries instead of the candy, and it was truly amazing, and not time-consuming at all! Thanks!"
"0","5","YUMMY"
"0","5","The family always asks me to bring this dessert to holidays. It's so good but so rich. It also looks really pretty in the trifle bowl and has great presentation. Also, it really easy to make!"
"0","5","Everyone loved this. It was gone by the time we left on Christmas Eve. It was a little sweet for my taste, but it's a crowd pleaser.  I used French Vanilla Cool Whip, real whipping cream, toffee bits and caramel.  For the chocolate curls, I used mini hershey's bars, a little bit warmer than room temp and shaved the curls off with the carrot peeler. Gorgeous!!! Thanks, this was fun to make. Less annoying than baking myriads of cookies."
"0","5","Another hit from Allrecipes! I took this to a holiday party and it was gone in no time. Looks lovely and based on the reviews, I too made my own whipped cream in lieu of Cool Whip (I don't like the taste of Cool Whip). I also used store bought pudding instead of instant. But everyone loved it! Topped with sliced strawberries!"
"0","5","awesome recipe, everyone likes it, huge bowl so make for a big crowd!"
"0","5","This is the best!! I made it for Christmas and it was a big hit!!! It was very easy to make. I wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","5","I LOVE THIS DESSERT! I have made this a couple times now and everyone loves it! I will continue to make it over and over. I need to make this with my new favorite brownies by Ghirardelli."
"0","5","This was my first attempt at a trifle. I'm not a dessert maker, but I had so much fun making this. I added strawberries to the edge of the brownie layer - it looked even prettier and they tasted great. Next time I'll add more. I followed other suggestions and used real cream in the pudding layer. However, next time I'll beat it longer because it was a little runny. Tasted great, but thicker would have been prettier."
"0","5","this dessert is perfectly yummy!"
"0","5","I made this twice over the holidays and each time I left with a empty bowl! Definitely recommend!"
"0","5","This recipe was very good. I drizzled the brownies in kahluah and added crushed heath bars to the layers, which definitly enhanced the trifle. It was quite heavy and I think I may use chocolate cake insead of brownie next time, but overall, very good"
"0","5","ABSOLUTELY THE BEST! I MADE THIS FOR THE SECOND TIME NOW. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCORDING TO THE MOST HELPFUL REVIEW, AND WHIPPED MY OWN CREAM. I HAD NO POWDERED SUGAR, SO I DISOLVED A COUPLE TSP. IN 1/4C. HOT WATER. IT WHIPPED UP WITH IT JUST FINE.  I'D RECOMMEND NOT MIXING THE PUDDING W/ WATER UNTIL JUST RIGHT BEFORE YOU MIX THE WHIPPING CREAM & PUDDING TOGETHER. I ALSO ADDED STRAWBERRIES TO THE LAYER, AND DID A HOLIDAY TWIST BY ADDING SOME MINT CHIPS AS SNOWFLAKES, W/ A STRAWBERRY FLOWER IN THE MIDDLE, AS I SAW IN A PICTURE. WONDERFUL. MIXING THE PUDDING & WHIPPING CREAM FOR THE ONE LAYER MADE IT TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE MOOSE!"
"0","5","What can I say other then this is a grat dessert.I keep using this recipe over and over again."
"0","5","Great basic recipe! Beautiful and so easy to 'dress up'. I added a touch of peppermint extract to the Cool Whip and topped it with chunks of peppermint bark for a more festive holiday treat. This will definitely end up as a regular in my recipe box."
"0","5","We first found this recipe on Mother's day 2006. Everyone raved. Have since made it one of our favorites and always have someone ask for the recipe when I bring it. This truly is a great recipe you will love. I have made it with fresh berries instead of chocolate bars and that is just as heavenly."
"0","4","As is, this dessert is MUCH too sweet and way too processed whipped cream. I made it for my hubby, and he loved it. I think this would definitely be a 5 star if I make again following suggestions here to make my own whipped creme with less sugar. It'll also taste less processed. Overall a good recipe though."
"0","5","This was SO YUMMY and soooo easy! I made it the day before Thanksgiving and covered it. I also used real whipping cream instead of cool whip. It was gone in 5 minutes of me putting it out!"
"0","5","My first impression and my company's was not 5 stars, actually I was disappointed bec I planned on impressing company based on the reviews. I discovered the next day that you have to let it sit in the frige for awhile and let the flavors settle into one and another. Make in the a.m. to serve in the evening is fine. Then, pure heaven!"
"0","5","Delicious and easy!! Could have doubled for my trifle bowl but still was amazing even half full. Thanks."
"0","5","great idea and simple! I peronalized it with fresh whip cream, caramel, and toffee. My 4 year old daughter helped the whole way and had a blast making it. Was a hit with all the teenagers and kids at thanksgiving!"
"0","5","Rated by my 8 year old son"
"0","4","This recipe was a huuuuuge hit at Thanksgiving. I ended up doubling the recipe and used vanilla pudding for one of the layers instead of the chocolate. Personally, I thought this was too sweet. However, my guests all loved it. For Christmas I will modify this recipe by using only 1/2 can of condensed milk and regular milk for the other half, and make my own heavy whipping cream instead of the cool whip. I also added chocolate pieces with caramel drizzle inside. I will also omit this since it was too sweet."
"0","5","I love making this! its so fun and easy to make and it turns out amazing! This recipe is so easy to Present because it always turns out looking nice! Great recipe its definitly a five star!!"
"0","5","This was delicious!! I made it for a mom's night out cookout and it disappeared!"
"0","5","You must be doing something wrong if this doesn't turn out perfect! This recipe is so simple and delicious. I made it for a work function and now I have people ask me to make it for their birthdays. They tell me it is their new favorite. I will be taking it to Thanksgiving dinner...where it has been requested the last 3 years!"
"0","5","I always make this for family togethers, and they hate me because it's soooo good! they can't get enough!"
"0","5","I haven't made this yet but tomorrow is the big day. I hope it is as good as it looks.... :)"
"0","5","You won't go wrong with this recipe! It is delicious and very easy to make :)"
"0","5","Great dessert. Very easy to make. It does make a lot though. Followed the recipe but made the following additions: drizzled the brownies with some Grand Marnier and added some orange sections on top of each brownie layer."
"0","5","Yummy! A hit with every age group. Warning it makes a lot! You will need a lot of people to help eat it."
"0","5","I didn't love the recipe as written - it was too sweet for me - and thats saying a lot. The next time i made it, I used unsweetened real whipped cream to mix in the pudding - and it was way better. I also through in some strawberries."
"0","5","This is amazing! I have made this for more than a dozen parties, and it is raved about every time. The only problem with it is that it is just sooooooo rich and yummy! When I want to impress I make it in a trifle dish. When I just want a quick and easy dessert, I bake the brownies in a 9X12 and then add the 2 layers on top. Simple and delicious!"
"0","5","I made this for a pool side barbeque and it was gone within minutes. Everyone loved it and now I make it every time I'm asked to bring a dessert."
"0","5","So Yummy! I made one change...I added toffee bits to the brownie mix and them alos layered them in on top of the whipped topping. I got SO MANY compliments on this amazingly easy dessert!"
"0","5","Ridiculously good and so easy! Instead of shaved chocolate I put some strawberries on top, and my guests loved it and said it would be better with even MORE strawberries!"
"0","4","This is a great recipe to make for parties. I used dark brownie mix and whipped my own whipped cream omitting any extra sugar because reviews said it was too sweet. And I added fresh raspberries in the layer. Mmmm"
"0","5","Very good and very easy. It is a great dish to make with kids!"
"0","5","Not sure how it tasted since I don't like Chocolate but it looked AMAZING. The people I made it for loved it. The only thing I did different was add some chocolate chip cookies (they were broken bits that were in the freezer) to the layers with the brownies and then used full cookies to line the top of the dish like I saw on the recipe for Chocolate Chip Trifle on this site. Very easy and looks impressive!"
"0","3","This is way to sugary."
"0","4","This was pretty good but I thought with all of the great reviews, I would have liked it more. I usually just layer the chocolate cake, prepared sugar free chocolate pudding, cool whip and toffee bits and my husband said that he likes my version better. I did make my own whipped cream for the mousse layer so between that and the condensed milk, it added a ton of calories. I think I'll stick to my version."
"0","4","This was very good. As others suggested, I used skim milk in place of the condenced milk. I also used devils food pudding instead of regular chocolate. I made this for a bridal shower and the left overs were eaten by my husband (who doesnt love chocolate) within an hour of bringing it home. Would definately make again!"
"0","5","GREAT RECIPE."
"0","5","Very Very Very Yummy! I made this recipe twice...First, I followed it exactly to the instructions and it was good and I recieved many compliments. However, I did 'tweak' it a bit and it made it super duper easy. I baked the brownies as specified...for the filling I used the pre-made chocolate pudding cups (that you find in the refridgerator section of the supermarket) and cool whip chocolate & creamy varieties. I layer the brownies, then the pudding, then the chocolate cool whip then the creamy variety and repeat."
"0","4","very good"
"0","5","Another keeper!!! My sister called and said she needed some brownies for a going away gathering at work. I thought ok brownies, but let me boost it up a notch. So I decided to go with this recipe. It was an office hit, she called and said the trifle bowl was empty, and it was terrific!!! I used the Duncan Hines chewy fudge brownies. Maybe next time I'll be able to try it personally :("
"0","5","I've made this a few times and every time it is gone in minutes. Everyone seems to enjoy this sweet trifle. In addition to the shaved chocolate, I have placed squares of chocolate on top.Makes a nice presentation."
"0","5","We love this trifle, but we always use choc. cake instead of the brownies, just a preference. Love the sweetened condensed milk with the pudding! Update: only had about 1/3 can sweetened condensed milk after using it in a different recipe, so added 1/3 cup caramel ice cream topping and 1/2 cup whipping cream! Turned out just as good, if not better!! Also, if I don't have chocolate pudding I will use cheesecake or white chocolate and add a couple teaspoons of cocoa powder to it."
"0","5","This recipe was awesome! Its easy and so good! Everyone in our family loved it! We followed the advice of some reviewers and only used half a cup of the sweet milk and made home made whip cream for the pudding. We also used 1/4 of baileys instead of water and used vanilla cool whip. Sooooo good! We will be making this a lot!"
"0","5","Wonderful strawberries on the side soo good"
"0","5","My family CANNOT resist this! It disappears every time I make it! Thank you!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice now and did it differently both times. The first time I followed the directions precisely and it turned out very good. The second time I added my own touch to it by using homemade whipped cream rather than store bought as well as toasting pecans and adding them in between the layers with mini choc. chips. This version is to die for! My guests absolutely loved it. I think the little bit that was left over was even better the second day, too! (I also used fat free sw. cond. milk and couldn't taste a difference)"
"0","5","I made this desert for a family gathering and EVERYONE loved it! I did make a couple changes though. Instead of putting chocolate shavings on top i put crushed oreos and i also added some in between the layers, and instead of making one big thing, i bought miniature cups and made individual ones. They were gone within an hour and i had several requests to make them again!"
"0","5","I make this all the time and everyone *loves* it!!! I make the pudding with low fat milk per the instructions on the box and top it with chopped reeces peanut butter cups - Yummy!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic! I used chunky chocolate brownies and Heath topping which added some nice crunch. My chocolate layer came out a little thinner than I would have liked, but the taste was phenomenal. It was very rich, though so goes a long way. It was so easy to make, and looked great. I will definitely be making this one again!!"
"0","5","I was responsible for making a dessert for my womens group that meets once a month. EVERYONE asked for the recipe. Made it exactly as described. Very rich and very easy to make. Next time I will do what others suggested by using heavy whipping cream. If you love chocolate, you'll love this."
"0","5","This is an easy dessert that everyone will love. I used about 1 1/4 cup of heavy cream wipped into the pudding mixture instead of the whipped cream the recipe called for. Once the browines came out of the oven i coverd them in Chocolate fudge ice cream topping, while it cooled. I also took carmel and drizzled over the top of each browine layer and took one heath bar and crumbled it and put half on each browine layer. It was awsome, the heath bar gave it a good crunch every now and then."
"0","4","I found this way too sweet, even with the following changes: 1) added just 1/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk to the pudding mixture, and substituted a 1/2 pint unsweetened whipped cream for the whipped topping (in the pudding mixture), and 2)substituted a 1/2 pint of lightly sweetened vanilla-extract-flavored whipped cream (for the whipped topping) in between the layers. I used a broken up Skor bar on top which added a nice touch. My family loved it, but, again, I found it to be too sweet. I think that next time I'll use my own not-so-sweet brownie recipe."
"0","5","This is addicting and incredibly rich!! You cannot have much of this at once!! Every time I make this everyone loves it and they always come back for seconds and thirds! This is also very simple and makes a great presentation in a trifle bowl!"
"0","5","Very, very good. We love this. Thanks!"
"0","5","Awesome, used whipping cream like others suggested, added toffee bits---delish!! I made two for the 4th of July, not a bite left over....."
"0","5","For a divorced middle-agged man, this is great! I took it to a Church function, and it was a big hit. I added strawberries and did the whipping cream as suggested, and the ladies kept saying that chocolate and strawberries were going to get me a woman real quick! I don't know about that, but I do know I am going to keep this recipe on hand."
"0","5","10 stars. Everyone loved it. I used heavy whipping cream in place of cool whip, since the cream tastes so much better and richer.  I will be making this many, many times."
"0","5","this is a REALLY great recipe.  well, you see, i do this volunteer program with some of my classmates at a nursing home. so we did this international day thing. i had to do the country of england. they said to bring in trifle, so i used this recipe. it turned out delicious. in fact, it was so yummy that all of my classmates wanted to eat all of it! i bet they would have, but i had to save some for the residents.  great great GREAT recipe! five stars!"
"0","5","Anytime I make this desert, everyone LOVES it! They can't get enough and it's gone in a flash! Definitly a winner! Yum!"
"0","5","YUMMY dessert. this ones a keeper"
"0","5","I made this recipe for the 4th of July holiday and it turned out delicious. My kids begged me to let them eat the whole thing in one sitting and my guests have emailed me requesting 'my' recipe. I added some toffee and chocolate bits to the turtle brownie mix I used and whipped some heavy cream as others suggested. It was really good and not too sweet. It's a really flexible and easy recipe too so thumbs up from me and for me!!!"
"0","5","so simple but always a hit! Delicious!"
"0","5","I've made this many times now. Everyone raves about it and I get lots of requests for the recipe. It's one of my favorite desserts"
"0","5","You cannot beat this for presentation and taste. It is a family favorite, and I had to stop 'saving' it for special occasions only, as we all love it."
"0","5","awesome, I am going to make a peanutbutter filling to go over the brownies and then continue with the layers, I will be making this a lot."
"0","5","This recipe gets 5 stars from this chocolate lover! I did add toffee bits and everyone was pretty much licking the bowl! Can't wait to make it again!"
"0","5","Made this for a cookout this summer and it turned out great!! I did cheat though to save time and dishes and bought already made brownies unfrosted from the grocery store bakery."
"0","5","fast, easy, and YUMMY!!!!"
"0","5","Three words.....To die for!!!!!"
"0","4","Do not use sweetened condensed milk with the pudding, because it would be wayyyyy too sweet. I would follow the instant pudding recipe from the pudding box. If you don't like too much cool whip, you can use heavy whipping cream to the pudding, but do not use all 8 oz of it, cause then it's going to turn into mousse (unless that's what you want). I would definitely make this dessert again, but with a few alternations."
"0","5","This is awesome and very easy! I usually add english toffee pieces on top and it turns out great!"
"0","5","This dish was fantastic - a huge hit at our party, we had 15 people so it's a good dessert to make for a crowd. I did have some problems - my pudding didn't set (waited 20 mins) and only set when it was put together and left in the fridge for a few hours....not a big deal except I didn't get the distict layers of brownie, whip cream and pudding - the pudding sunk into the brownie. Also I decided to use real whip cream to cut the sweetness and only added a little of real vanilla while whipping. For a crowd of 15 I doubled the recipe - such a GREAT dessert!!  UPDATE - The second time I made it I used even more brownie and let the pudding set longer before assembling the dish....so yummy!!!"
"0","5","This is the first thing I made from this website and all I can say It is wonderful. I made it for a baby shower and everybody went on and on about it. I think the only one that was upset was the grandma of the mom to be because she made homemade apple pie and not one piece was taken out of either of them. A+++ thanks for a great recipe"
"0","4","Very good but also very rich. Only for those who are chocolate diehards."
"0","5","Everyone loved this! I used Banana Angel Delight instead of instant chocolate pudding mix as I'm in the UK (and Banana was the only flavour I had at the time) and folded in whipped fresh cream to that instead of coolwhip, layering with the whipped cream too. I then crumbled a Cadbury's Flake bar over the top - mmm. If I used Banana Angel Delight again I would also layer in some sliced banana on top of the brownie too. Will definately use this recipe again as it is so easy to make - just a shame you have to leave it in the fridge so long before eating!"
"0","4","I used the suggestions about the heavy whipping cream and caramel. I don't think I used enough caramel because the taste was not very noticable. I made a double recipe for a party and I also made individual cups of the trifle. It was like those mud cups for kids only the adult version. It was a little more time consuming but created less of a mess and the cups were easily disposed. Great combo with the brownie! I will probably make this again"
"0","5","I was a bit hesitant to make this since I'm not a fan of instant pudding and Cool Whip. However, I needed a quick and simple recipe so I went for it... FABULOUS! I used a brownie mix with mini Hershey's kisses and it was delightful. Very rich, a small portion will definitely satisfy a sweet tooth!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe!! Everyone loves it and it is so easy!! A++++ winner at my house and everywhere else I go. Everyone wants the recipe. I recommend using the chocolate chunk brownie mix that makes it perfect!"
"0","5","YUMMY!!! Everyone loved it. They were following me out the door at the BBQ. Trying to scoop it on their plate before we went home with the leftovers. How funny but so true! You could do so many variations with this one. Great recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is always requested among my family and co-workers. I make a more simplified version. I use a layer of brownies, a layer of regular chocolate pudding (prepared with a little less milk for a richer pudding) and a layer of crushed Skor candy bars then repeat those three layers again then top with cool whip. For the cook on the go I will substitute the crushed candy bars with the toffee chips and use triple chunk brownie mix for the added chocolate which is left out if you do not use the Skor candy bars. This is for the chocolate lover. We call this dish Chocolate Goop."
"0","5","WOW! This is absolutely delicious! But next time, I am going to omit the sweetened milk as it was little too sweet for our taste. I also only used 16 oz. of whipped topping."
"0","5","This was wonderful and the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it gets!! I did go by the view reccomendations to use heavy cream, instead of whipping cream, in the mouse. I also added the carmel and used bitter sweet chocolate to the top for garnish (which was a nice contrast to the really sweet brownies) I highly recommend this and I will be making it again, and again, and again!"
"0","3","talk about chocolatey!! This is a great recipe if you're PMS-ing, but I think this recipe is way TOO RICH and chocolatey for a normal day!!"
"0","5","The best dessert ever!! I use a mix of homemade whipped cream and cool whip, also had toffee bits and carmel on the brownie layer-perfect!!"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! I added caramel on top of the brownie layer and used French Vanilla Cool Whip as previously suggested. Rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Thank you!"
"0","5","For any chocolate lovers, this dessert is pure perfection! I added my own little touch by layering in german chocolate cake and caramel also."
"0","4","Addicting, but really not worth the calories. Yes it tastes good, but I would have been better off just eating the brownies alone for a chocolate fix, with the amount of fat in this recipe. Also, I tried the modification someone mentioned where they used heavy cream in the chocolate mixture and left out the evaporated milk and cool whip. I would not recommend this. First of all, you end up mixing the pudding mix just with a 1/2 cup water, when it normally requires 2 cups of milk, so you start with a very pasty chocolate thing, to which you add your whipped cream. Although the chocolate mixture had a good overall taste, it was very heavy, and there was much less of it than there would have been had I made it with evaporated milk and cool whip."
"0","5","IF YOU NEED TO CUT THE PREP TIME IN HALF READ THIS REVIEW!!!  This recipe is absolutely yummy! If you are tight on time, I used Little Debbie Fudge Brownies instead of making my own and it was delicious! I also drizzle caramel on top of the brownie layer and on top. Instead of shaving my own chocolate, I just used chocolate sprinkles. It really cuts down on the time to bake your own brownies and shave the chocolate. Hope this review helps! :)"
"0","5","so easy, and exceptionally tasty! i've made it plenty of times using the recipe as is, but have also prepared it adding just a touch of mint flavor to the pudding mix, a few crushed up andes candies in the layers and then curled andes candies shaving to the top for a little taste twist!"
"0","5","Great! Don't be fooled...this is a very rich dessert. It's great that it can be prepared ahead and looks amazing. When my guests looked the refrigerator, they asked if we could have dessert first!"
"0","5","Wow! Easy to make and SOOO good! Quite decadent, but great for special occassions for the chocolate lovers in my life! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome. I made it for an Easter dessert and the entire thing got eaten. It is also a very pretty looking dessert."
"0","5","A go to dessert when I need to make something fast and easy. Everyone loves it and it looks beautiful."
"0","4","When I first tasted this I thought it was just so so. And too sweet like some others. However, my company thought it was very good. The next day I ate some and thought it was really pretty good. I think the next time I make it I will still whip my cream fresh but not add the 3 TBLS. of sugar. Thanks."
"0","5","Pretty easy and a beautiful dish! It looks like you spent hours on it. It was a hit at my daughter's birthday party and thanksgiving!"
"0","5","I have to make this for EVERY family get together now. It's incredible."
"0","5","Yum, made this for a small group mothers day church event and it was amaizing. I used a turtle recipe brownie mix for the brownies and used heavy whipping cream instead of the whipped topping in the pudding layer. I also used French Vanilla whipped topping and got a bag of Heath Bar peices and used that as a 4th layer and a garnish. I made cookies and a carrot cake from scatch and this trifle was hands down everyones favorite."
"0","5","I really liked this recipe. I wanted a chilled dessert for our Mother's Day lunch and this was great! I did a few modifications though. First off, I added a layer of graham crackers to the bottom of the dish. Also, I pretty much lightened everything up. I used a lower-fat brownie mix, low calorie/sugar free pudding mixes, and fat free sweetened condensed milk and didn't think it tasted 'lightened' at all! Also, I used fat free milk instead of water for the pudding. Next, instead of making both layers chocolate flavored pudding, I mixed a chocolate layer and white chocolate layer separately, using only half of the ingredients called for for each mixture. Also, instead of chocolate shavings on top, I crumbled about 3 graham crackers into fine crumbs and sprinkled that on the top. Just a few alterations but they were good. Can't say how the original would taste as this was my first try. It is a keeper though!"
"0","5","Everyone loved it!"
"0","4","made this for my dad's 70th b-day party. the kids devoured it. i didn't really care for it."
"0","5","A huge hit at a monthly gathering I attend. You can never have too much chocolate."
"0","4","Very good. It was very rich. I used whipping cream instead of Cool Whip."
"0","5","Out of this world! I did as others have suggested and used a little caramel sauce on the brownie bits. Also used homemade whipped cream in between the layers as well as the crumbled heath topping. Crazy rich and yummy!"
"0","5","This is soooo yummy! The first time I made it, I follow the directions to a T. The second time I made it, I changed it up a bit. For the brownie layer, I used store-bought brownie bites cut into chunks, drizzled caramel syrup over the top, and chopped up Reeces cups. To the pudding layer, I added heavy cream (about a cup) and reduced some of the cool whip. Both ways were delicious! I can't wait to make this again! It's very easy to make, beautiful, and easy to modify to suit your tastes!"
"0","5","My bible study group loved it! I used Dark choclate brownie mix and drizzled caramel on the brownie layer after it was in the trifle bowl. I used crushed toffee for the candy bits."
"0","5","OH MY!! Can you say DELICIOUS!?!?! My whole family and our guest loved this. I also used french vanilla cool whip in place of the original. Will definitely be made again in our household and for church gatherings. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Yum Yum! This was a very delicious dessert. Will make it again."
"0","4","Everyone loved the presentation and it got lots of compliments, I only gave it 4 stars just b/c I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be based on the other reviews. It was good, but not amazing.  I did what many other reviewers suggested and that was to use 1/2 pint whipping cream w/ 3 T sugar as a substitute for the cool whip in the chocolate mousse layer, I think this was a good idea b/c otherwise it really would have just tasted like brownies w/ cool whip. I also used the triple chunk brownie mix. Will make again."
"0","5","All I can say is simply amazing! Was a hit with the entire family and there was none left! I will definitely make again!"
"0","5","I made this for a party and everyone there loved it. By the end of the evening it was all gone. I made the recipe exactly as it was written and I loved it. It was really simply as well. I only chilled it for about 6 hours though instead of eight, but it still came out great."
"0","5","FANTASTIC!! As suggested, I whipped my own topping (half pint of cream with 3 T. sugar)and folded it into the pudding and used french vanilla cool-whip for the cool-whip layer. I also added half a jar of caramel topping to the brownies before I cooked them. It was more than a hit! I was requested to make a double batch the next time I bring it. Even though it is rich, they couldn't get a big enough piece. I plan to exchange the french vanilla cool-whip layer for homemade whipped topping in the future."
"0","4","This is a great recipe to cure a chocolate craving! Its not my usual preference for deserts, but I can't deny its pretty delicious."
"0","5","I love this recipe! Everywhere I take it and serve it, people rave over it!! So easy!!! I would give it ten stars if possible!!"

"0","4","Topped with Raspberry's this is a very pretty dish, tasty and easy to make."
"0","5","So I totally cheated on this - I have a full time job with extensive travel and no time to bake.  I took the jist of the recipe and suggestions, came up with:   1-22oz container of pre-made Chocolate Pudding (I used 'Missys' brand) 1-container of French Vanilla Cool whip 1 pkg of Hersheys Raspberry creme filled baking chips 1 pkg fresh raspberries 1 9x9 pan of brownies from the bakery section of the supermarket  Prep:  -Thaw cool whip -divide brownies in 1/2 and break into pieces -Divide the cool whip in 1/2, Fold 1/2 the cool whip to the full container of pudding in a bowl.  Then assemble:  Line bottom of a nice crystal bowl with 1/2 brownie pieces  Put the topping/pudding mixture on top of brownie layer   Top that layer with 2/3 the raspberries and 2/3 of the raspberry hershey chips.  Place the remaining crumbled 1/2 of brownies on that layer  Place the remaining cool whip on that layer and garnish with remaining chips and raspberries.  Cover and fridge overnight.  Then step back and accept gracious compliments. I also suggest you lie and say you made it from scratch, cuz it sure tastes like you did. The pudding tastes like chocolate mousse and the fresh raspberries and the raspberry filled chips add contrast and texture.  I tried it first with toffee bits and caramel sauce and whipped the heavy cream, but the whipped cream didnt matter since the quality of the prepackaged pudding I used is much better than instant and quite frankly, it was a little too cream rich for my s"
"0","5","Exceptional. I even Made it Twice. Once in a Wine glasses, then followed by the Triffle bowl. My Family Loved it."
"0","5","this is so good it should be called death by chocolate trifle."
"0","5","This is really good. I sometimes omit the brownies and have used oreo's, chocolate wafer cookies, etc. And it is just as good. I have also used just strawberries or raspberries in place of the brownies. You can add, omit and play around with this recipe and every time it tastes like a million bucks! It's also really easy too and everyone thinks you went to a lot of trouble."
"0","5","This was so yummy...followed recipe and just added heath bits on top of cool whip. It was a big hit with kids and adults!"
"0","5","Wow, no wonder everyone rates this dessert with 5 stars. I would have given it a higher rating if I could. Didn't change a thing and the trifle was a big hit at the party."
"0","5","This was SOOO good. I made it at one of my friend's houses with a brownie recipe on this website (I can't remember which one though) and it was delicious. I will definitely make it again. =)"
"0","5","This recipe is so good and it is so easy to make. The hardest part is the brownies and that is no trouble at all."
"0","3","I made this to take to a Super Bowl party and it was half eaten within 15 minutes of being made! There were 10 people there, multiple desserts and we came home with a tiny bit left. Everyone seemed to like it, but I was a little disappointed. The changes I made were to add 4 ounces cream cheese to the chocolate layer and use an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip instead of 12 ounce. It turned out SO sweet though and even after the leftovers sat in the fridge for a day, the chocolate pudding and Cool Whip layers are difficult to tell apart. While a lot of people liked it a lot, next time I'm going to make something different."
"0","4","I made the chocolate pudding from scratch since i don't like packaged mixes. Also layered a couple of ripe bananas i had on hand. Very rich and filling!"
"0","5","Yumm! I used chocolate cool whip in the pudding mixture which made it richer and fr. vanilla cool whip for the rest. Everyone loved it and it only took about 10 minutes to assemble."
"0","5","This came out perfect... so easy and quick. Looks impressive. Will certainly make again!"
"0","5","Added the french vanilla to the whipping cream, carmel and toffee bits as suggested by other readers. This was really good but it was almost too rich (if that is possible). I'd like to lighten up the whipping cream and pudding layer next time."
"0","5","everyone loves this!"
"0","5","This recipe is so YUMMY!!!! I did make a few changes this time around.....I used the store bought 2 bite brownies instead of making my own.I also sliced up some fresh strawberries,sprinkled them with sugar and let them sit to bring out their juices and then layered them in the trifle as well.Also instead of using the condensed milk I mixed the chocolate pudding with some of the whipped topping .Oh so Yummy!!!! Enjoy!!!!!"
"0","5","WOW!!! I made this for the family for Christmas and it was one of about 15 desserts - this is the one they all went for seconds!! After reading the reviews, I did a little tweaking and added caramel and heath bits. Very easy to make and the presentation makes it look like you spent all day on it......Will be making again!!!!"
"0","5","This is an awesome dessert; although I have to say that it was a little bit too sweet for my taste. I opted for the whipping cream w/3 Tbs sugar as one reviewer suggested. Next time I think I'll omit the sugar altogether and cut back on the sweetened condensed milk by about 1/4 cup. Definitely recommend and it was so easy to make, not to mention you can make ahead of time. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","I made this last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! Some people complained about it being too sweet, but I thought it was perfect! It is also very easy to make. I had 5 dishes to make that Thanksgiving and this one was by far the easiest and most delicious. This chocolate trifle tastes so good it should be a sin!"
"0","5","This was awesome, but very rich! I used whipping cream to mix with the pudding, and also used a container of french vanilla cool whip for layering.Also, I crushed up Heath toffee bars and added that to the mix. Next time, I think I will try it with peanut butter cups!"
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic and super easy to make. I added the toffee bits and caramel. Gooey and amazing!"
"0","5","I had a New Year's Day Drop In, and this was most delightful, I did adjust according to one of the other reviews. Otherwise IT WAS GREAT AND SO SINFUL."
"0","5","This is a very good and versital recipe. You can also add cherry or strawberry pie filling as a layer. Everyone in my family loves this one!"
"0","5","I used Kozy Shack chocolate pudding, negating the need for the condensed milk, some of the whipped topping and the pudding mix. An easy shortcut that helped cut the sweetness a tad. Also added strawberries and topped with Andes mint pieces."
"0","5","everyone thought this was really good - the one drawback is that you can only eat so much of it. i followed some of the suggestions - i added bailey's cream and used real cream instead of cool whip. if i had used the cool whip maybe it wouldnt have been as rich as it was. however, if you are a chocoholic, this recipe is for you."

"0","5","Probably ne of the best desserts I have ever made. Super easy to make and delicious. I make this all the time for parties. :D"
"0","5","This trifle was my first such endeavor. It was absolutely delicious. I did add some caramel sauce over the brownie layer. I will probably continue to explore different variations, although this recipe was great just the way it is!"
"0","5","This dessert is a favorite of my family and friends. Based on other reviewers, I have made a couple of alterations to the recipe. First, I use triple chunk brownies and drizzle about 1/2 bottle of caramel ice cream topping on the batter before baking. Second, I use mini chocolate chips and sliced strawberries between layers and on top for decoration."
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe! I have made it many times and everyone always requests the recipe."
"0","5","I love this and have made it three times with rave reviews every time. I took another reviewer's advice and changed one cup of the Cool Whip to whipped cream and used a Triple Chunk Brownie Mix by Betty Crocker."
"0","5","My family thanks you from the depths of our stomachs!! We fell in love on the first bite... I added my own modifications... chocolate chips to the brownies... chocolate cool whip... extra pudding. This is a definite do again!!"
"0","5","This was wonderful. I talked my sister into making it for Christmas Eve. Everyone loved it and devoured all of it!"
"0","5","I'm not a big fan of chocolate like my husband and daughter are but I made this for them for Christmas dessert. IT WAS WONDERFUL!!!! Like others suggested, I used whipping cream with 3Tbls sugar instead of frozen whip cream. I also used brownies with walnuts. I can't wait to take it to the office and share with co-workers. Thanks for sharing. Will make again and again. Susan H."
"0","5","Fabulous dessert for Bunco , holidays , anytime. I have always put heath bars chopped and sprinkled over the brownies and I also pour cappucino over brownies before the next layer. Decadent and delicious !"
"0","4","Ok, so its Christmas Day and I am exhausted. I needed to make yet another dessert for a gathering tomorrow. You can't go wrong with leftover pound cake & brownies. I diced up both, layered it with chocolate pudding, cool whip and chopped up Reese's PB cups. I ended up calling it my 'I Can't Possibly Bake Another Thing Trifle'. Thanks for the idea."
"0","4","The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but a not as light. I made a modified version for a Christmas Eve party and it was a hit. For the pudding layer I skipped the condensed sweetened milk and instead combined the pudding mix with about 1 1/2 cups of milk then let it thicken in the fridge. I whipped 8 oz of heavy cream and folded it into the pudding. I substituted cream whipped with about a tablespoon of sugar for the cool whip layer. In the middle of the layers I drizzled about 1/4 cup of caramel sauce. For the top I used a chopped Heath bar instead of shaved chocolate. Yummy!"
"0","3","I took other reviewers' advise and modified the original recipe, using vanilla flavored cool whip, chocolate chunk brownies, and whipping up heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip to lessen the sweetness. What a disappointment - it wasn't nearly as good as what people said. WAY too sweet. The brownies were hard, I think if I were to make it again, I would use regular brownies instead of the chocolate chunk ones, the chocolate pieces were rock hard. Maybe my mistake was modifing the original recipe, I may try again, this time following the recipe to a tee. There are far better desserts out there."
"0","5","I make this for the hoildays and it is very good. I like to make things home made so I make the browie home made."
"0","5","I'm not the best cook, as my name implies, but this trifle was SUPER easy and SO good, everyone wanted the recipe. It also makes a nice presentation. Since I brought it for a holiday party, I added currants on top with the chocolate curls. You could vary this recipe in many ways, but this basic recipe is FAB! PS-Do use real whipping cream, it makes a difference."
"0","4","I made this recipe with some of the suggestions of other reviewers included. I used the 12 oz french vanilla coolwhip in place of the regular coolwhip, and I whipped 1 cup of heavy cream in place of the 8 oz. cool whip. It was very good, but very, very, very sweet. Although I refrigerated for 8 hrs before serving, the brownies were still chewy. The following day they had softed up more and the flavors had blended better. Next time I will make a day ahead of time and will substitute softer chocolate cake for the chewy brownie texture."
"0","5","It tastes just as good as it looks. Very Easy & Yummy. My 10 year old daughter & I made it for my daughter's softball christmas party potluck and it was one of the first desserts to go. A keeper."

"0","5","I made this desert for the first time a couple weeks ago for the office, everyone just loved it. I got compliments on how wonderful it was and also how beautiful it looked. And of course I was asked for the recipe. I made it just as directed with the exception of adding strawberries between the 2 brownie layers. I am making it again as we speak for a birthday at the office. Very easy too make, I highly recommend it!"
"0","5","Made this for a dinner party and followed the recipe exactly. For chocolate lovers this is absolutely perfect. If you use cool whip it does keep that flavor. I think I'll try the fresh cream next time because I enjoy that more. But it definately is a keeper!"
"0","5","I love this recipe its fool proof! I didn't have condensed milk so I made my own and turned out fine. I also topped with Andes mint pieces it gives a holiday flavor."
"0","5","Love it!!! So easy, looks beautiful, I layer strawberries in between....Fabulous!"
"0","4","Very easy to prepare, tastes great but very sweet! Great dessert to have with a crowd when a little goes a long way."

"0","5","Very easy to make. The first time I made it, I had only bought 2 8-oz tubs of Cool Whip (didn't read the recipe throughly enough), but it still worked out. Everyone loved it, and I have made it a few more times since."

"0","5","Fantastic, Easy & YUMMY!!!! Well worth trying. I made this for my co-workers & what a hit it was.  Sue"
"0","4","I gave this recipe 4 stars b/c of the ease in preparation. I thought the chocolate pudding mixture was a bit too sweet though. I would follow the suggestion of another reviewer and add more whipped topping to the pudding to tame down the sweetness."
"0","5","Excellent! Many people asked for the recipe. I did use Roxanne 323 modifications (third review down)."
"0","5","I slightly modified the recipe by adding mini chocolate chips to the pudding for some different texture and a layer of bananas. Both were great additions, along with chocolate syrup drizzled over the banana layer. I also served in 8 mini trifle bowls which worked out really nice as I was able to use the desert for 2 different occasions that week. Great recipe by itself or modified."

"0","5","This was absloutely awesome!! I made a few changes- I used chocolate pudding with carmel bits, and got half way through preparing the pudding the way it says on the box before I realized I was not supposed to do that!! :-) It was completely fine, though, I just folded in the whipped cream and it turned out amazing! Everyone at my party loved it.  Thanks for sharing!"
"0","3","Toooo Sweet. And yes, there is such a thing, this is even too sweet after using my own homemade whipped cream which is ALOT less sweet then store bought."
"0","5","WOW! This was amazing. This was the first trifle that I had made so I was a little nervous. It was soooo easy. I made the brownies the day before to cut down on the prep time. I also undercooked them by about 2 minutes so that they were really fudgy. I made this for a family function and can't even tell you how many compliments that I got. There was hardly any left, but it was even better the next day!"
"0","5","Great recipe! My whole family raved about it. Next time I will try it with carmel topping poured over the brownies to moisten them up a little bit. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I didn't make any changes and this was WONDERFUL!!!!! You should definatly try this dessert."

"0","4","Thank you for the recipe! Everyone at my party thought it looked beautiful and tasted great! I followed the recipe exactly and added strawberries as decoration. Maybe next time instead of baking brownies I will subsitute it was two-bite brownies. What a party hit!"
"0","5","SOOO yummy and easy to make. I made this for my boyfriend for our anniversary. Used chocolate bits to make a heart on the top and sprinkled some cocoa powder on top too. =) we both loved it!"
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","This trifle was so good. My husband craves it all the time now. I did what alot of other people suggested and whipped the pudding mix with heavy cream. I tried it once with the extra chocolate chips for crunch but that just made it way too sweet. I use 2 packages of strwberries and the Heath bits. This trifle is absolutly to die for."
"0","5","O M G!!!!!! ok i made this tonight for my family and oh boy was it a hit.it was the best thing i have ever made,and i make a lot!I think i could bribe my family to do anything i want with this desert.Its a 10 star for sure.I did not change a thing it came out GRRREAT!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Made this for a church dinner last night. Everyone LOVED it. I made the variations as others suggested; home made whip cream, 3 chopped heath bars & carmel sauce for each layer. No leftovers & everyone asked for the recipe."
"0","4","The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, but it was WAY to sweet for us (though all of the kids gobbled it right up!). So the next time I made it I cut out the sweetened condensed milk and used milk with a little bit of coffee added which cut the sweetness right down. I also added coffee to my brownie mix (I was always told that it brings out the chocolate flavor, can't guarantee it but I listen to my mother's advice about cooking). This also gives a great presentation on the desert table. Thanks for the recipe, we'll be keeping this one!"
"0","5","This is sooo good, and easy to make! I left out the sweetened con. milk and just made the pudding as directed on the box... it was definitely sweet enough! It's a versatile recipe too... I've added strawberries... toffee, try anything that sounds good!!!"

"0","5","Absolutely delicious! My friend and her family requested it twice already. I added strawberries as a layer. Very yummy! Will make again and again!!"
"0","5","Loved it. Almost completely gone. If you're like me and you read 'refrigerate 8 hours) about 3 hours before your event, I refrigerated the pudding mix alone and it came out perfect...no worries."

"0","5","This dessert is great! I made it for a wedding shower and it went fast. I also received requests for the recipe. I did cut out some of the condensed milk and increased the regular milk in the pudding. I also added toffee chips on top of the pudding layers and to the top of the dish.  I chose a brownie mix that came with a pouch of chocolate syrup, which made the brownie moister."
"0","4","This was a yummy dish...the next time i make it i think i will double the pudding mixture and not add as much cool whip....the cool whip kinda over took the flavor of the dish"
"0","5","This was delicious but I did add the toffee bits, caramel sauce, and nuts. Took it to work and every last bite was gone. I prefer cooked pudding to the instant but when mixed with cool whip, it's hard to tell the difference."

"0","5","Very quick and easy, for a trifle, which is usually neither. Yummy!"
"0","5","Very yummy! Easy to make and tastes great. I added/changed some of the ingredients (added cherry pie filling and used Rolo pieces instead of Skor) but loved the base recipe."
"0","5","I made this for a potluck my husband and I attended last night, and it was a huge hit. I didn't have time to bake brownies (nor did I want to turn on the oven in this heat) so I bought a chocolate loaf from the bakery. I only wish I would have had more time to let it sit and get 'gooey' :). I threw in some raspberries for contrasting flavor, and it was great."

"0","5","This is great I made it for a Church Couples Valentine Party everyone loved most of the men asked for seconds."
"0","5","I made this last night. i did the heavy whipping cream thing in with the pudding instead of the whip topping, as per suggestions here. I also made double choc chip cookies and crumbled them up with the brownie layers. The cookies are my favourite part because it's something to chew on. It definitely works with it.  Very indulgent dessert."

"0","5","This recipe was amazing. I made it for my mother's birthday and it was a hit! The pudding/sweetened condensed milk mixture is soooo delicious. Instead of using a boxed brownie mix, I homemade them. I will definately make this again."
"0","5","If you want to save time try substituting the ready made frozen chocolate cakes (like McCain's)in place of the brownies. I buy 2 and scrape the icing off, then cut into cubes. Of course not as good as the original but an acceptable substitute when you're in a hurry!"
"0","5","I got rave reviews from the whole extended family, but it sure was time consuming to make...."
"0","5","I don't really like chocolate so this wasn't my favorite (though it was very good as far as chocolate deserts go) but everyone else loved it!! Of the 3 different trifles we made this one was gone first."

"0","5","Just fabulous. Everyone loved it. We did not have condensed milk so used packet directions for the pudding. Would do again.....Not for dieters!"
"0","5","This is super sweet but usually a big hit. A nice addition is alternating oreo cookies with the brownies in layers. They get very soft over time, and it is delicious."
"0","5","THIS WAS VERY GOOD ALTHOUGH I JUST MADE THE CHOCOLATE PUDDING ACCORDING TO THE BOX DIRECTIONS AND MIXED IN THE WHIP CREAM AND LEFT OUT THE CONDENSED MILK AND WATER"
"0","5","This is the easiest dessert to make, and everyone loved it!!"
"0","5","Made this for St Patricks potluck at work. Only change I made was adding green food coloring to the whipped cream to keep in the st patricks theme. This recipe got great reviews.....Excellent!"
"0","5","this is a delious and easy dessert that my family and friends enjoy. all you have to do is make sure you give yourself enough time to allow it to refigerate before serving. in a pinch, i've served it after only refigerating a few hours and it was still very very good!"
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe!!"
"0","5","This was a hit at our couples night! It was so good - all the ladies were asking for the recipe!"
"0","4","This is too sweet, even for a college chocoholic. it also started to get syrupy in the fridge. im trying to freeze it now,see if that helps it. if i did make this next time, i would cut back on the evaporated milk. still tasty though!"
"0","5","How can this NOT be good?! With a Betty Crocker classic brownie mix, this is simple and quick. Allow time for cooling, however. We used regular whipped cream with sugar and vanilla due to the NASTY ingredients in 'frozen whipped topping'--read the label! It is a rich dessert. Hubby felt it was a bit over the top--definitely not a refreshing dessert, but rather indulging! Yum!"
"0","5","I also layered Health bar bits and sugar free cherry pie filling when I made the dessert. I used sugar-free or low fat everything, and it turned out great. The chocolate mouse layer made with the sweetened condensed milk was a bit too sweet for me, so I would probably use less and make up the difference with regular milk. I'll definitely make this again. Good for large groups, it makes a lot!"
"0","5","I made this for New Year's Eve and it was a huge hit. It is a delicious trifle that gets better as the flavors mature. I substituted coffee for the water in the brownie mix and used real whipped cream. I 'eyeballed' how much whipped cream I put in the layers and ended up using a little too much whipped cream. Other than that, it was delicious and everyone loved it."
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","5","This is a favorite at our annual Christmas Party. It's great to have something that is so easy to whip up in bulk, yet tastes and looks like something you slaved over! Every year we run out!"
"0","5","This was a good recipe! I made some major changes to make it a Banana Turtle Trifle for my husband for Valentines day. I used half banana and half chocolate pudding mix. I left out the chocolate bar for topping and put some chocolate chunks in the brownie mix instead. When I layered it I added toasted pecans, caramel sauce, and bananas. My husband loved it!! I was able to use all sugar free items as well!"
"0","5","I made this for Christmas dinner dessert. It got rave reviews. I made homemade brownie rather than using the mix. Other than that, I did not change a thing."
"0","5","Love it!! Was gone in minutes at a family reunion. So good and easy to make-very easy on the wallet,too."
"0","5","Loved this and so did everyone else. Wonderful!"

"0","4","This is a very good, rich dessert. This makes a lot which is great for bigger groups. You don't need alot to enjoy this dessert."
"0","5","Very rich, but wonderful. My brother requests this recipe everytime I bake!"
"0","5","On of our favorites. I generally do not like desserts with frozen whipped topping (Cool Whip) in them. They seem too commercial, but this one is wonderful."
"0","4","I seem to be the only one in my family that doesn't care for this. Way too rich for my liking but it was devoured by everyone else."
"0","5","Oh my God!! This is always a crowd pleaser and the perfect finish at any party. I really enjoy making it and the shaved chocolate on top gives it a professional look. You won't be disappointed."

"0","5","I made it as is for a baby shower last Sunday, and I was asked 7 times for the recipe. A little goes a long way with this recipe! Thanks!"
"0","5","I barely have to wash the dish when I take this to a dinner!"
"0","5","This is a favorite among family and friends. The recipe is perfect as is, and is so much easier than it looks!"
"0","5","This was great, super easy and tasted wonderful...and it looks pretty too. I bought some milk chocolate chip chunks and scattered them over the top. I also used a little less than the whole can of condensed milk per the advice of other users."
"0","5","Wow! This thing was the first thing gone at my potluck yesterday, and everyone raved about it! Thank you thank you thank you! =)"
"0","5","I made this for my husband's birthday (Superbowl Sunday) and it lasted less than 24 hours. Yes, it is sweet, but I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe!!"

"0","5","I made several desserts for Thanksgiving this year and this one was the first to go! This is a keeper."
"0","5","Wow! I made this up for Thanksgiving, and once I set it on the table, people started eyeing it. It was the first desert to get dug into, and everyone really liked it. Unfortunately, it was very, very rich, and I quickly found out that I couldn't eat very much of it without getting sick! It's good and I'll make it again, but I'll be sure to watch how much I'm eating."
"0","5","Thank you for sharing this great recipe! This was the hit of the family pot luck. It was so easy and fast. I didn't have the time to bake the brownies, so I bought the brownie bites from Albertson's. Delicious!"
"0","5","Incredibly good and easy! You won't regret making this.."
"0","5","Delicious and easy to make!"
"0","5","Very good! A great chocolate fix!"
"0","5","Made this for a office birthday party a couple months ago, everyone gave complimetns. They still request encores. This is easy to make and delicious to eat. Also, it makes a great presentation in a triple of inverted glass cake dish."
"0","5","OUT OF 3 DESSERTS I FIXED THIS WAS THE FIRST TO GO...I CHOPPED UP REESES PEANUT BUTTER CUPS TO SPRINKLE IN TOP. YUMMY!!!!!"
"0","5","great--much better using the brownies rather than cake as some call for. we used heath bars and also poured about a cup and a half of coffe over the brownies---wonderful!"
"0","5","This one is a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly and took it to a church dinner. The trifle dish wash scraped clean! I took it to a dinner at my kids' school the next week and came home with another empty bowl. I plan to make it again for a party. This rich dessert is super easy to prepare and looks very impressive in a trifle bowl. I couldn't get the chocolate curls to look as nice as I wanted. I may try chocolate sprinkles or mini chocolate trips if I'm in a rush. I definitely recommend this on for potlucks!"
"0","5","I wish I could rate this recipe 100 times. It is sooooooo good!!!!!"
"0","4","Very yummy, and great for chocolate lovers. Thanks for the recipe."

"0","4","Very good recipe. Makes quite alot, maybe next time I will cut the recipe in half and try to lighten it up because it's very heavy."
"0","5","Oh my gosh this was SO GOOD! I made it for a progressive dinner, and after debating over many recipes for trifles, I decided on this one. I had never made a trifle before, and it was so beautiful and easy! Everyone raved about it and wants the recipe!! The chocolate mixture turns into a mousse, and its so light and delicious. I was very impressed, thanks for a great recipe! I'm sure I will use it again!"
"0","5","Very good and easy to make. My 13 yr old daughter, Brittany made this dessert for a dinner we had and she didnt layer it , as she is new to cooking, it was very sweet, but still really good. I think it would have been less sweet if she had layered it properley :)"
"0","4","I made this EXACTLY as the recipe stated and it was fabulous. I'm sure that the addition of Heath bits and caramel would be great. But, I made it as stated and it was wonderful. I let it sit in the fridge for about 5 hours and it was really good."
"0","5","easy and delicious. my husband really likes it and that takes a lot!"
"0","5","I had made something very similar to this before without the sweetened condensed milk, but I believe I like this recipe better. It was not too sweet to me at all, as some reviewers thought it was too sweet so I was a little skeptical...it was very yummy! I did add some bits of brickle on top of the pudding layer for some crunch and used 4 cups whipping cream whipped with 1 cup powdered sugar in place of the cool whip. I would definitely make again!"
"0","5","This was great. I used real whipped cream instead of cool whip and it was a hit. Made it for my sisters birthday. Everyone raved."
"0","5","I brought this to a party and everyone loved it!! I added heath bar candy bits between the pudding and cool whip for a crunch. Yum!!"
"0","5","This was very good! Very chocolaty!"
"0","5","Very rich, but quick & easy & great for a crowd!"
"0","5","I made this for a Church Function- EVERYBODY loved it! Big Hit!!!!! So easy to make! I did however bake the brownies too long, but it still worked! Instead of using shaved chocolate on top, I crumbled a toffee bar and mixed in a couple of pieces between layers and on the top. Looks great in the trifle dish..This is one of my favorite recipes, will definetly keep this one!"
"0","5","Great dessert! Very rich, so small portions go along way. I added Skor candy bar broken into pieces. I also used cheesecake pudding inplace of the chocolate. My family thought that I should cut back on the whipping cream and double the brownies. Thanks!"
"0","5","This is so delicious!! I used oreo cookie crumbs instead of candy. Only because I forgot to get it at the store. It was a big hit at my party!!"
"0","5","This was the best recipe! It tasted like you spent hours in the kitchen but it really didn't take long at all. I took it to a church dinner. Someone had taken a spoon and gotten EVERY drop off of the sides of the trifle bowl! Thanks for such a great recipe."
"0","5","A little too sweet, but it was still a hit"
"0","5","Totally awsome!!! 10 ******. It is so easy to make and sooo good."

My fiancé and son are not huge chocolate fan but they both wanted to dive right into this. This is a definite winner with me! Will make it again and again!!"
"0","5","Very sweet! We needed lots of good strong black coffee! I made this recipe again with chocolate pound cake instead of brownies and lightly sweetened whipped cream instead of whipped topping. Much less sweet and a different texture. My family likes both!"
"0","5","Wonderful - Easy to make - I have many rave comments."
"0","5","Wow!!! What a fantastic recipe!!! I made this for a Christmas party and this got eaten before all the other desserts were practically touched. The only things I did differently were I used a 1/2 pint of whipping cream in place of the cool whip in the chocolate layer. I also added strawberries and crushed Skore bars between the cool whip layers. It was not too sweet at all. SOOOO GOOD. I have been requested to make this every year from now on."
"0","5","I made this several times and the family loves it! It's so east to make yet delicious!"

"0","5","This is the best! I serve it at get togethers and church gatherings. It is quickly gone, and I should probably make two it's so easy to make. I have even gotten around the having to make it the night before. If it's a little soft, no one seems to mind!!"
"0","5","This is awesome for chocolate lovers!"
"0","5","I have made this dessert for two get togethers this summer and it was a hit both times. Didn't get to bring any home with me! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It's so easy to make! Wouldn't change a thing. Quick, easy, and delicious!"
"0","4","very good and very rich"
"0","5","The presentation of this dessert is outstanding! Easy and delicious! I think like others said, crunch would be good and easy to incorperate. LOVED IT!!"
"0","5","This is soo yummy! It is always a hit!"
"0","5","This was a HUGE hit at the Teacher's back to school luncheon for my son's school. I have to make another one because so many of them didn't get any! It is already rich, but I added Heath bits on top of the chocolate layer and diced almonds on top of the whipped cream. I topped it with a few of each. I can't wait to make this again!"
"0","5","Follow CHRISTINAI's suggestion! I did, and this is the most popular recipe I've ever made!!! Make sure you add strawberries; it is a little too sweet without them."
"0","5","This is a great recipe for a chocolate trifle. I used my homemade whipped cream instead of cool whip. I took it to a family gathering, and everyone loved it."
"0","5","A huge at my office! This just became my number one most requested recipe, and all I have to do is refer people to allrecipes.com."
"0","5","Excellent! Everyone loved it! (I thought I'd be clever and put M&M's on top instead of the chocolate -- bad idea. The colors all ran together and made a rather unattractive mess. Next time, I'll stick to something that won't bleed!)"
"0","5","This is a must-try recipe for the chocolate lover. It is absolutely delicious. It is also very rich and it makes a lot - a great dessert for a large group."
"0","5","Fabulous recipe! I very rarely give 5 stars but this recipe deserves it. I did NOT think that it was too sweet at all as some others said. I did, however, use whipping cream instead of already made frozen whipped cream. I will make this again and again."
"0","5","So good, received lots of compliments. Used fudge-like brownies."
"0","5","Yummy! Very good at potlucks!"
"0","5","Very, very good! I just took this to a church get together, and it was a hit! Everyone loved it!

I will definately be making this again!"
"0","5","Decadent and easy. I added heath bar bits inside."
"0","5","Too rich? Serve it over ice cream to cut the richness? Don't quite get that. Anyway Wayne, the delicious RICH ingredients speak for themselves, which is exactly why most of us decided to make this delicious and wonderful dessert to begin with! Loved by all, including this rare sweet eater!"
"0","5","This is a very pretty desert. I always get asked for the recipe. Thanks!"
"0","5","People freak out over this one, it is ALWAYS a hit and there is no way to mess it up! It's even better on the second day!"
"0","5","This turned out looking as good as the picture. I did follow some other suggestions like making my own whipped cream so it wasn't as sweet. It is very sweet and best served to a large group of people since small servings are best. I was very impressed and loved the different options it opened up. I did layer and top the trifle with crushed chocolate toffee pieces as well. It tasted as good 2 days later. LOVED IT!!!!!"
"0","5","I have made this twice. Both times I ran out of the whipped topping so I suggest making at least another 80z more whipped topping. The other layers are enough to make a good 3 layers. This is a chocolate lovers dream dessert and so easy to make. I usually top with sliced almonds or nut topping in addition to the shaved chocolate."
"0","5","Brought this to a church luncheon and it was a big hit. Very rich so most people took small portions. I used crushed heath bar between layers and also made three layers instead of two."
"0","3","This was just okay. It tasted like the different parts just stacked together... I didn't really feel like the layers particularly added anything to each other. It was beautiful, though. I did serve it at a dinner party, and we were all so excited because it was so pretty, but then it kind of disappointed. Maybe our expectations were too high, but we did not have the out-of-the-ball park experience that other reviewers experienced."
"0","5","This dessert was excellent! I decided to layer the crushed cookie in with every layer and it turned out great. I will definatley make this again."
