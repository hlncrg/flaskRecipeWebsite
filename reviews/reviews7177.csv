"3056","5","Yum!!!! I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon swirl bread, left out the raisins, added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, used gourmet whipping cream instead of milk and topped it with a vanilla sauce recipe I found on this site. WOW! This made a dessert you'd pay a lot for in a restaurant. My husband and I loved it. And it was so easy! I'll make this a lot. Anyone who even remotely likes bread pudding will love this for it's ease and it's taste."
"2386","5","I started using this recipe nearly THREE years ago, and figured it was time to say so. I've read some of the reviews, and if this helps, I've tweaked a little, too. I don't usually like to share my secrets, but this one's free: keep the egg quantity, use half and half instead of milk; turbinado sugar adds a warmer flavor than white. Add some extra bread (a couple slices worth of ANY kind - I love the varying textures and colors), cram it with walnuts and 1/4 teaspoon of black walnut extract; use nutmeg instead of cinnamon with the black walnut flavor, ground ginger without. Exotic. I've topped this bread with thinly sliced pears in a pinwheel design (nicer flavor and softer texture than apples) and sprinkled the tiniest bit of brown sugar over them before baking. Warm with whipped cream is best, still it's a great start to any day as breakfast. Thanks, Ellen. I've been appreciating you for a while and would give you 10 stars if I could!"
"1804","5","This recipe is SO delicious and SO easy to make (no scalded milk or water baths here - yippee!). The first time I made it I used 4 eggs like the recipe calls for, but I thought it was way too 'eggy' (it almost made a layer of scrambled eggs on the bottom of the pan!)... so the second time I made it with only 3 eggs and it was PERFECT! Both times I made it with cheap store-brand white bread and it was absolutely delicious, so you don't need to use an expensive bread to get good results. I topped each serving with a dollop of homemade whipped topping (whip 1/2 pint of whipping cream together with 3 tablespoons powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla)... and then I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of that. It was truly 'TO DIE FOR'!! Thanks so much for this easy and delicious recipe, Ellen! :)"
"689","5","This bread pudding is the best I have ever tasted. My husband loves bread pudding and is never satisfied with what I make. I made your bread pudding and he was raving. He almost ate half of the pan. My grandson was here at the time and he kept wanting more. I finally had to put a stop to both of them But honestly it is the best - even the restaurant can't touch it. Thanks for a great recipe. This is a desert that is ready in 45 minutes and is perfection. Thank you, thank you, Sondra Whealton"
"550","3","Good, but way too much sugar (cut down to about 1/2 cup) and cinnamon. Also needed to add more bread (used 9 slices) because after nearly an hour of baking the center was still uncooked, cold, and soggy."
"402","5","This is a great, easy recipie! I doubled the recipie, changed the milk into heavy whipping cream, and instead of useing french bread or raisins I used petridge farm raisin swirl bread. I also recomend cutting off all crust from the bread, it makes it taste stale. But with these simple changes it's great!! Great recipie!"
"286","5","I really liked this recipe! I had some left over french bread which I wasn't sure what to do with and figured a pudding would be nice... It sure was! I used one egg less (they were big and I didn't want it to be to 'eggy' anyway). I also used brown sugar intead of white sugar and added nutmeg to the whole. Oh and I didn't use any raisins. I really recommend it... I'm thinking of making it for my family when they come over next weekend."
"244","5","My family and I love this recipe. Even my wife who never used to like breadpudding loved it. My little trick was instead of raisins I thinly sliced a granny smith apple and used it in it's place."
"171","3","This recipe is fairly tasty but has a custard-like consistency, which I do not care for. I even added 3 extra slices of bread. The sides and top, which got a little drier and crispier, were quite tasty though."
"145","5","So Good! I used leftover, homemade egg bread...it turned out fabulous! As good as my grandma's, and that's saying alot! :)"
"112","5","Yummy! Fluffy & Light. I made mine with leftover Hawaiian Sweet Bread dinner rolls, and used all 4 eggs. I whipped up the eggs & milk mixture until it was FROTHY and then let the bread soak in the mixture for a good 2 hours. When I baked it it PUFFED UP really nicely, and was crispy on the outside and wonderfully creamy on the inside. A WINNER!"
"108","5","YES! Great for dessert AND breakfast! Ellen fine tuned this recipe for her family ... this is how I fine tuned it for ours. We use more bread, add a slice of multi-grain or anything stale (like that 1 leftover hamburger bun), take off some of the crust on the bread but just cube it and fill the pan 3/4 full. Use less raisins, 1/4 cup that have been plumped in hot water, layer them with the bread and melted butter. 1/2 t. cinnamon is plenty for our tastes and don't forget the vanilla. We use 3 eggs and 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups milk. (Fresher bread uses less milk... staler bread needs more). This does not make a too eggy bread pudding. If you are eating this by itself use the 3/4 cup sugar. If you are topping it with a sweet sauce (we like melted vanilla ice cream .... sort of a creme onglaise -spelling ??? sorry) or serving it for breakfast with maple syrup then cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. This is soooo easy and you just can't stay out of it! Thank you Ellen. And thank you Allrecipes.com ... what a great web site. LOVE IT!"
"65","4","I've been using this base recipe for almost 2 yrs now and I keep coming back to it. 4 stars because the ratio of ingredients is a bit off, but with a few minor adjustments, it's perfect for my family. It's also great the next day as an on-the-go breakfast too. {INGREDIENTS} 8 bread, 4 eggs, 2 butter, 1 milk, 1/2 brown sugar (just remember that it halves each time for each ingredient). For aromatics, a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla, plus a dash of nutmeg and ginger powder round it out for me. {MIXTURE} It's quite eggy and I love it eggy and custardy, so I keep it at 4 eggs. It's quite liquidy, so I reduced the original amount of milk so it isn't in the oven too long (I add an extra 1/4 cup of milk sometimes only to wet any dry bread so it doesn't burn. It's also a bonus that you don't need scalded milk for this recipe). Be sure to fully dissolve the sugar in the liquid mixture or else you'll have sweet spots in the pudding. {BAKING} The pan size, baking temp & time are perfect for the new ratio (for my oven at least). {BREAD} It works wonderfully with white bread or leftover hamburger/hot dog buns (I like the taste of sesame seeds in the pudding too). French bread takes a bit more time to soak up the liquids. My favourite so far has been challah bread. Next on the list to try is croissants. Try & experiment with this recipe - it's easy to doctor up to your oven and tastes. :)"
"61","5","I have been making this for years but never bothered to measure anything. I am so glad to see someone took the time to measure & share the recipe. It's a great way to use up all your stale bread! I do everything the same only I use extra bread and make it in a 9x13' pan (I have a large family). Over the years I have played around with this & sometimes I've added pecans & apples, fresh blueberries, or cran-raisins. I've even swirled strawberry preserves through it. I often bake it with a simple crumb topping on it too. But my kids favorite way to eat it is to add maple syrup over it & they have it for breakfast. Just pour over a generous amount of your favorite maple syrup over the bread pudding right when it comes out of the pan. Let it sit for a few minutes so it soaks down into the bread. YUM! It tastes amazing! My thanks to Ellen for sharing this recipe that I've enjoyed for years with everyone!"
"47","3","Very good. It needed one less egg."
"38","5","I took this to a Thanksgiving pot-luck party last year in Taiwan and fortunately I made extra because the pudding disappeared before I could even get to it! Everyone was raving about it. I used wheat bread since I am not a fan of white bread and I cooked it a little longer since it was still a little soft in the middle. I also added walnuts."
"37","5","This was amazing. It came out so fluffy and moist. I went off of what a couple of other reviews had said and I only used 3 eggs. I also used cinnamon swirl bread, added another tablespoon of melted butter, and i added craisins to the mix. Turned out lovely! I also had to keep it in the oven a bit longer (maybe 10-20 mins) because I have never made this before and I didn't know exactly how cooked the center needed to be. It bled a little too much of the liquid when i went poking around. Turned out lovely and I will definitely be making this again. :)"
"35","4","We loved this bread pudding. I have made maybe 6 recipes for this and nothing came out like the good old fashion bread pudding. My husband said 'here we go again' LOL But he ate a lot and loved it too. I made a sauce that uses brandy. I used a round glass bowl to put it in the oven and it was just as good. It was so good even the second day. Thanks for sharing..."
"28","4","I changed this up a bit and it was delicious! I cubed 2 small apples and sauted in butter until soft. Used 1/4 cup of melted butter and poured over the bread. Mixed 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 cup evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cups of milk (didn't have cream), nutmeg, cinamon, raisins, chopped walnuts, added the cooled apples and the rest of the ingridients, poured over the bread, mixed well and baked. The house smelled delicious and we ate it with Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream!!!!"
"28","4","I don't really care for bread pudding, but I this as a special treat for my uncle when he visited. Everyone loved this and was so impressed that it wasn't the usual soggy bread pudding. The one thing I did change was I used Challah bread instead of white bread. DELICIOUS!!"
"26","5","Great taste! Not too egg-y...not too mushy...not too dry. Next time I am going to use whole wheat bread for a nummy and healthy breakfast treat."
"26","5","So tastey and SO easy! Thanks for sharing!"
"25","5","THIS IS IT!!! When I was a child my friends mother made THE best bread pudding. I have been searching and tasting bread pudding and nothing came close. THIS IS IT!! I'm so happy!! In my case it's all about consistency. I used 6 stale french rolls. broke them in 1/2' cubes. Did not use butter or margarine. Used only 3 eggs (can't stand eggy). Used 2 small boxes of raisins. I mixed everything together in a large bowl to a nasty looking mush but after it was baked it was PERFECT!! Not to custardy, not too bready a perfect combination of the two. I do not like it when you can separate or tell there are cubes of bread, i like the bread pudding dense and this was!! THANKS A TON!!!"
"25","2","I used French bread. And the pudding didn't infuse into the bread as much as i would have liked. I followed other suggestions and only put in 4 eggs. my personal preference is soggy bread pudding and this by far was stiff and the mixture did not infuse into the bread i used very well. The flavor was too bland for me as i prefer my pudding sweet and cinnamony, like horchata. I might try to repeat this recipe maybe with a different bread. But the first try i didn't like it much. (i love the bread pudding at the bellagio buffet in las vegas)"
"23","5","I made it two times already. It is great!!! The best I ever have. Since I'm on diet, I use fat free milk, fat free butter. It is still great. Thank you for sharing."
"22","5","Surprisingly quick and easy to make, with AWESOME result!! :) I took it to a potluck today and got LOTS of compliments. Note: I doubled the recipe and baked it for 55 minutes in the oven because the center part didn't look 'done' after 45 minutes."
"20","5","IN 2 WEEKS, I MADE THIS RECIPE FIVE TIMES SO MY ENTIRE FAMILY CAN TASTE IT. I MADE IT WITH WHEAT, WHITE, BUT THE BEST IS FRENCH BREAD. I BREAK APART ALMOST A HALF A LOAF AND THE CONSISTENCY IS PERFECT USING THE SAME MEASUREMENTS FOR THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS. BEFORE BAKING, I SPRINKLE BROWN SUGAR ON TOP. THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST, THANKS!"
"19","5","I absolutley LOVE this recipe! My family inhales it, that is if I don't eat all first! Here's a little something that my family likes to have added...whiskey sauce or lemon sauce! Thanks for a perfect recipe!!!"
"18","5","Used homemade white bread and substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon then sprinkled nutmeg on top. Only found one tiny spot that was eggy. Superb!"
"18","5","I have never tried making bread pudding, but I have always loved to eat it! I was amazed how simple it is to make. My husband loves this recipe and I make a batch of this every weekend and keep it in the fridge throughout the week to grab in the morning as a quick breakfast."
"18","5","Awesome bread pudding! I used old french bread which was hard as rock so I was a bit worried the pudding would turn out to be too hard. Well, I used 3 cups of milk and only 3 eggs, and it turned out great. People loved it and I submitted a photo too. Because I used a lot of bread and milk, I was able to cut them like bars. Will bake again!"
"18","4","Nice recipe Ellen! I loved the simplicity and the endless possibilities to make changes by adding pecans or walnuts...dress it up for the holidays with cherries and caramel. Thanks so much for sharing it with our families. Happy holidays!"
"16","5","thanks Ellen for posting this recipe....don't even have to change anything. This recipe is sooooo yummy."
"16","5","Having made this over a dozen times, I consider this the ultimate in comfort food. I've tried this recipe using an egg substitute, less sugar, different spices, nuts and fruits -- all variations yield perfect results. Try sprinkling a br.sugar/nutmeg/pecan mixture on top prior to baking - it makes a nice crunchy 'crust'. Knowing I have this recipe on file gives me reason to freeze bread when it goes stale...... Thanks!"
"15","3","I like a heavier, bread pudding and this was not it. It was too 'custardy' for my taste. Maybe it would be better with a thicker french bread - I used the Pepperidge Farm cinnamon bread."
"15","5","Amazing recipe! I've passed out many copies! So easy and so delicious."
"14","5","This recipe is pretty much like mother's exact I couldn't remember the measurements of hers. The only thing I did different was to use a half stick of butter, 2 cups of evaporated milk instead of whole milk and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also cooked mine in a waterbath because my family likes a custardy type of bread pudding. Based on others, I used 9 slices of bread and one less egg. Lastly, I added about 1/4 tsp of salt as I do with all desserts. Salt brings out the flavor of whatever you are cooking whether it is sweet or savory in my opinion."
"14","5","I used slices from a loaf of supermarket sourdough bread and got excellent results. The taste, texture and aroma were all great."
"14","5","This is the ultimate comfort food!! It was so delicious that I made it with different breads with excellent results. Thanks for sharing this one!!"
"14","4","I love bread pudding, and this was my first attempt at making it myself. It was very easy to make and very quick. I didn't have stale bread so I put the bread in the oven until it was toasted. It wasn't as firm as I would have liked, but it was still delicious. My boyfriend had never had bread pudding, and he loved it. Next time he wants me to put raisins in it, and I think I'll add more butter because I love a buttery bread pudding."
"14","5","Yummy! This recipe was quick and easy to make and turned out great. I had a real vanilla bean in my cupboard that a friend gave me for Christmas, so I opened it up, scraped out some of the vanilla bean bits and added them to the recipes. It was so good, my husband and I ate most of it in one sitting!"
"13","5","We loved your recipe! A favorite resort restaurant we love is famous for their cinnamon bun bread pudding. After another reviewer said they tried a specialty bread, I made your recipe using Pepperidge Farms Cinnamon Swirl Bread. Since it is fairly thin, I added two slices. Came out great and my hubby was thrilled. Thanks for sharing."
"12","5","Outstanding! Phenomenal! ...and any other superlative you care to use. I had some Belgian Molasses Bread (another Allrecipes treat) left over, and crumbled it up to use in this. As much as I liked that bread, it was amazing in this! I used all Splenda, as I'm diabetic, and cut back the eggs to 3, based on other reviews. Added a generous dash of allspice and cloves to the cinnamon, and substituted fat-free half and half for 1 cup of the milk, using skim for the rest. Dotted the top with only 1 Tb butter (to cut calories) - no need to pre-melt it. Baked it for 55 minutes. At 45, there was still some liquid at the very bottom, so popped it back in for another 10 minutes. We just loved the juxtaposition of the crunchy crust against the creamy interior. No one could tell it was made completely free of added sugar, and very low fat, making it almost guilt-free. As a bonus, it's high in protein and calcium. Not many desserts can make that claim. Fabulous enough for company, served warm with either a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of real, lightly sweetened, vanilla-laced whipped cream."
"12","5","fantastic! very simple, very satisfying.. Smelled fantastic, and was absolutley devoured by my kids, they fought over the last spoonfull! I wish I had doubled it. If you're ever adding cinnamon and sugar to a recipe, blend the cinnamon in to the sugar before combining with wet ingredients. My high school home-ec teacher told us that, and it really prevents the cinnamon from seperating & clumping up in a batter. : )"
"12","5","This recipe is 'the BEST!' and a beautiful presentation. I calculated for 18 because I wanted to use a 9X13 pan then followed ingredients and baking time to the letter-EXCEPT-I exchanged plumped cranberries for raisins AND drizzled a simple sauce over all while still warm in the pan. I highly recommend the addition of sauce, it made this an absolute PERFECT dessert. Bread Pudding Sauce Ingredients: 1 cup whole milk 2 Tbsp. butter 1/3 cup granulated white sugar 1 tsp. vanilla 1 Tbsp. flour dash of salt Directions: Mix everything together and bring to a boil for 3 - 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Set aside for 5 minutes, then pour on warm bread pudding."
"12","5","Made this twice in 1 week.It was that good. Second time around, i used 3 eggs instead of 4,doubled the cinnamon, and added 2 more slices of bread.It was much better and had a better texture. Definitely a keeper."
"12","5","Wonderful and easy. I also used the vanilla sauce recipe also on allrecipes.com to top it and my husband can't stop pulling out bread to see if I'll get the hint to make it again.  I too used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. Wonderful. Just as good as a restaurant.  ETA: I've made this now at least 24 times and I now usually just use raisin cinnamin bread for times sake and it still turns out wonderful."
"12","5","This was an excellent recipe, light and creamy....however I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet for our taste. I used currants instead of raisins because they are smaller which I prefer. Great warm or cold."
"12","5","Absolutely wonderful! I made this for my husbands family at Christmas and everyone raved about it! Some people declined dessert (because they were already so full) but when they heard everyone raving about it they changed their mind, and were glad they did. I think this will become a tradition in our family. I made this according to the directions submitted by another reviewer ~ Amy Lampert. Thanks Amy!"
"12","5","This is great-tasting recipe & really easy to make! I used leftover homemade bread and mixed some heavy cream in with the milk & the results were fantastic. I will definitely make this recipe again!!!"
"12","5","The best bread pudding recipe I've ever tried. I used apple struedel bread. It was fantastic."
"11","1","This seemed super-eggy and overly moist to me. I followed the recipe as it was rather than the suggestions of other posters to cut back on the eggs."
"11","4","Yum,yum,yum!!! I used a good, crusty, day-old Italian bread and it came out just right.... we will definitely have this again in our house!"
"11","5","my husband loves bread pudding, he's almost a critic and he loved it."
"11","5","it was great, quick and easy"
"11","5","I tried making this with yellow and pink bread (Portuguese sweet bread). The colors made for a pretty as well as tasty bread pudding. EVERYONE loved it. One friend said it's even better than the one made by a famous local chef here (Hawaii). Thanks to Ellen for sharing her recipe! :o)"
"10","5","Oh my, oh my! We just finished eating this and I think my husband's eyes may have actually rolled into the back of his head! I thought he was going to lick the bowl! I used the vanilla sauce recipe from another recipe, but this was deeeelicious!"
"10","4","I love this recipe :)...I've used left over bread (sourdough and beer bread) when making this and it has turned out great each time. I made the recipe as directed the first time, but also found that it seemed to create a layer of 'scrambled eggs'...made it with 3 eggs and it was really yummy! Thanks for sharing"
"10","5","My grandfather who isn't doing too good requested bread pudding for the 4th of July like his mother used to make... I had no clue how to make it. I came upon this recipe and made it jumping in feet first. It was rather simple, but not knowing what the texture is suppose to be, i was unsure if it was right. My grandfather gave the approval tonight as he poured the milk over his second helping. Thanks for the recipe and bring a bit of his past back to him in these hard times."
"10","5","Craving bread pudding, there were a zillion recipes, but so many were overwhelming (hot water bath, etc.) I was so excited to find this one which was so easy and got great reviews. It was perfect! Exactly what I wanted."
"10","4","I've made this recipe several times with different results. It seems the bread choice is the key - shepherd's or french bread was too soggy, but with good flavor. Cinnamon raisin bagels are my favorite...reminds me of french toast!"
"10","5","This was the first bread pudding I made. It turned out great and was even better the next day! Thanks so much for sharing."
"10","4","Very good even if i don't know exactly how it should taste.... I like it! Expecially the crusty top. I used only egg whites (i had some to use up before expiring date) and simple italian bread. I added raisin and i think they add a nice touch. Would you please tell me how should it be inside? Wet? thank you."
"10","5","I keep this recipe out at all times, so I can whip up a batch when the mood strikes. (And it frequently does!)"
"9","4","Great taste, but needs a few adjustments to make it worthy of five stars, IMO. First of all, 4 eggs is too much. I absolutely hate it when things become 'eggy' and 4 eggs creates that problem; 3 is better. Also, you will need more bread, I used about 9 slices of cinnamon bread. there's not much too it if you don't add some raisins or other 'fixins'. I used 1 cup of cranberries, 1 small diced apple, and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. With these changes, you will have a fantastic, comforting bread pudding. thanks for the recipe!"
"9","5","I love this recipe. I have made it so many times now. I always double it and omit one egg. I sometimes add chocolate or butterscotch chips sub almond or maple extract for the vanilla toss in some nuts it's all good!"
"9","5","My family was introduced to the awesomeness of bread pudding when we ate at Planet Hollywood (they use STRONG rum sauce). This recipe is really easy and tastes awesome! I read all the reviews, then made 2 pans of it so I could experiment a little. The 1st pan I used italian bread, 3 eggs instead of 4, substituted choc chips instead of raisins, and no cinnamon. To go with it I made the vanilla sauce recipe from this site.  The 2nd pan I used french & italian bread, 3 eggs instead of 4, half & half instead of milk, no raisins, and the rum sauce recipe from this site.  We decided we liked the 2nd pan better, with rum sauce. I didnt notice a difference in taste with half & half vs milk, next time Im going to use skim milk. Thank you very much for this recipe I will def make it again!"
"9","5","I used to think 'bread pudding - yuk' till I made this for family members. Very easy - very good! I didn't count the bread slices, just overfilled a round ceramic dish and followed the rest of the recipe. It looked SO nice I sent in a picture! Give it a try! Smells great cooking too!"
"9","5","My husband loves bread pudding and everyone has complemented me on this recipe. I sue this recipe and another for a butter sauce on top and it is a true hit with everyone. Thanks!!!"
"9","5","This was excellent. We tore it up at my house.....next time I'll double the recipe because it really is scrumptious and oh so simple. Thanks for the recipe Ellen...this one is definitely a keeper."
"9","5","This was very simple to do and it tasted great. We had it at out Thanksgiving this year and it was a wonderful follow up to our dinner. It might be good if you make it with cinnamon bread too."
"9","5","An excellent, easy to make recipe that turns out perfect every time. It's also great warm or cold!"
"8","5","Amazing! Made it for the family and everyone loved it. Really easy to make, the only changes I made were I only used a half a cup of sugar which I thought was enough. Definitely recommend."
"8","5","Very easy, simple recipe. Just a little tip for using up leftover goodies: Just throw 'em in here! Leftover muffins, banana cream pie, apple pie, etc. It's a great way to use up leftovers (if you ever actually happen to have any) and will add an extra YUM!"
"8","5","I had never had bread pudding before I made this. This was fantastic! Absolutely delectable. Those that tried it, and had had bread pudding before said this was perfect. I used 7 slices of fresh, slightly toasted bread, a 9in, round pie dish, and 4 eggs. I also added 1/4c of brown sugar. I didn't eat it with sauce but my mom used a sauce from a maple butter blondie recipe from this site, added whipped cream, and said it was exactly like the dish she gets at a restaurant. So wonderful! Thank you **Update: I've made this with gluten free bread and it was just as tasty! It may need to be cooked a bit longer than called for if you prefer a firmer pudding, however."
"8","5","OMG! This smelled so amazing when it was baking! The taste was to die for! I followed the advice of other reviews and added 3 eggs only 1/2c white sugar, added 1/2c brn sugar and 1/2tsp.nutmeg. I sprinkled the top with brn sugar and chopped pecans. After i made the first one i made 2 more immediately for gifts!"
"8","5","An easy and super yummy recipe! I followed the recommendations of using 3 eggs and adding 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, using 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar, and sprinkled brown sugar on the top before baking..turned out great, especially when eaten cold =)"
"8","3","I added 1/16 tsp. nutmeg, increased butter to 3 tbsp., used 1/2 milk & 1/2 heavy cream, decreased cinnamon to 1/2 a tsp since I used cinnamon bread from bread machine(removed crusts), added 1/4 cup brown sugar, and omitted the raisens. Was way too wet and dense and rich for me. I'll use 1 less egg and only 1/2 cup cream & 2 tbsp. of butter, decrease the brown sugar to 1/8 of a cup & add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg next time."
"8","5","DELICIOUS! I made a few minor modifications so mine was perhpas much sweeter than it might otherwise have been. Added 1/2 c. butterscoth topping, handful of walnuts, handful of botterscotch chips, 1 extra slice of bread, and instead of 2 c. milk, added 1 c. milk + 1 c. cream. Also a dab bit more butter. Exquisite!"
"8","5","This is excellent and easy to make and just like I remembered mom making it. :D (Also, it had less butter than most recipies, so it's a bit healthier.)"
"7","5","I've made this one a few times now. Superb! didn't change a thing"
"7","5","The only thing I did different was I 'grilled' the bread first. We had the grill going today and once the food was done, I threw on 6 slices of white bread and charred them. Proceeded with the recipe as written. Very delicious! I'm pretty sure I've paid $8/serving for a very similar bread pudding in a restaurant before."
"7","5","Ok so I had to join just so I could leave a review on how amazing this recipe is! Delicious and simple!! I used cinnamon raisin bread, French bread and a little left over kings hawaiian bread, a touch of raisins and the best part sprinkled some cinnamon pecans on top. I also used 1 cup heavy cream in place of 1 cup of milk. What bread pudding would be complete with out rum sauce?! ( 1/2 cup butter, one egg beaten, 1C sugar, 2tsp vanilla stir on med heat tell sugar is dissolved add 1/3C dark rum) AHmazing!! My mother inlaw said it was orgasmic! Hehe I can't wait to make this again and again!"
"7","5","Believe it of not, I used old hot dog and hamburger buns that were reaching the expire date...and this turned out wonderful! I gave some to my boss (who has a real sweet tooth) and he loved it! I had him try to guess what type of bread it was and he never figured it out LOL What a treat and super easy to make! This was my first attempt at bread pudding and I will definitely make this one again."
"7","3","Tasted like a big french toast! Ive had better, Ive had worse..."
"7","4","This is a wonderful Bread Pudding! Everyone that tried it loved it and my MIL asked for the recipe (never happens!). I followed other review and used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl Bread. I'm not sure if I purchased the correct bread because the slices were thin and using only 6 slices with 4 eggs and 2 cups of milk was just not enough bread. I used nine slices and I will do the same next time except back the eggs down to 3. It was just a little too eggy for me. I included the raisins and thought it a great addition. The amount of cinnamon and vanilla were perfect for us. I will make this often with the little tweaks mentioned. Thanks for sharing!"
"7","5","A+++++ ...I have made bread pudding for years, and lost my recipe book with all my favorite recipes a while back during a move. I'm slowly remaking it, with lots of searching. I remembered the ingredients, but not the measurements...so I've been looking all over and narrowing it down to my final choice. And this is it! I didn't change a thing in this recipe. I did have to double it to make a 9x13 pan, like you have to do. An 8x8 pan just isn't enough, LOL! I accidentally added too much cinnamon because I was on the phone and not paying attention, lol...but it turned out delicious anyway. My fiance' likes it, so that means its good! He's already ate over half the pan since this morning! Thanks so much for this recipe, Ellen, it's already been added to my new recipe book."
"7","5","This is the best tasting and easiest to make!!I did alter a bit like everyone else,I used only 2 eggs.I did use 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.I also added a 1/2 tsp almond extract and sprinkled the top w/brown sugar.It looked so wonderful when it came out the oven and tasted so yummy!!!!Definately a keeper!!!"
"7","5","As suggested by many: *Only used 3 eggs *Used 8 slices of bread *Added chopped pecans and brown sugar as a topping. Custardy when warm but if you cool it in the refrigerator it gets firmer and can be sliced. Very good!!"
"7","5","Oh my goodness! I just cooked this recipe and tried it for the first time a few minutes ago! It is soo unbelievably easy and simply delicious. I followed everyone's suggestions and I used 3 eggs, 1/2 c. white sugar, and 1/4 c up dark brown. I haven't tested it with my family, but I know they will love it as much as me."
"7","5","Here's a recap of all the reviews:wonderful! No leftovers! Recommendations I followed: omit one egg, double the recipe, add more cinnamon, soak raisins on hot water, use cinnamon bread, make the brown sugar sauce. I used Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Spice Blend and golden raisins. I'm still searching for a cream sauce to complement the sugar sauce - like they served in a restaurant that used croissants in their bread pudding. The day after, I toasted squares of the bread pudding on my stoneware bar pan and then served them with drizzled brown sugar sauce and cool whip for brunch. Wow! Incredible dish..."
"6","5","We loved this recipe. The only thing I changed is after it was done I sprinkled sugar on top and put it in the oven on broil for a few minutes to give it a hard sugar crust on top. Yum. and for all of the negative reviews I read, I have one question... 'Why are you making bread pudding and placing negative reviews for a recipe... when you don't like bread pudding?'"
"6","5","This is my first review! It was very, vary good! The recipe is amazing following it to a tee. Maybe, just maybe, because I'll be scared it won't be as good but, next time I will try using cinnamon bread and adding a little pecans. I hate it when people rate a recipe either good or bad when they make changes, they're not rating THE recipe they're rating their own recipe!"
"6","5","FABULOUSE RECIPE!!! This was my first time making Bread Pudding ever.... We usually enjoy my brother in laws. Had leftover hamburger and hotdog buns so it was time :) My husband told me 'Mine is better than his brothers!!' I did add nutmeg also. Thank You for this 'keeper' recipe"
"6","5","This was great as-written. I used some left over honey whole wheat bread and some apricot bits. This was gobbled up quickly and everyone was happy."
"6","5","This was excellent. I cut 6 slices of a bakery cinnamon burst bread (more dense) that we hadn't finished by the end of a week. I only used 3 eggs like someone else suggested and I let it sit about 15-20 minutes before baking. I kept pushing down the bread into the milky mixture. I then made a hot vanilla sauce for over it. It was to die for!!!"
"6","5","This is absolutely delicious! Definitely the best bread pudding I've ever had. I used half&half instead of the milk, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar. Served with rum sauce...yummy! Can't wait to have an excuse to make this again! Will definitely become a 'go-to' dessert recipe. Thanks"
"6","5","I'm giving this 4-stars but the Hubster gives it a 5. I think it has 1 too many eggs, so I will make that change next time. He thought the amount of egg was perfect. I used chocolate chips instead of raisins (which is what I like to do anytime a recipe calls for raisins!), sprinkled nutmeg on top and it was superb! Very good blend of flavors and makes for a beautiful bread pudding. I used several pieces of leftover french and italian bread loaves I've been saving in the freezer for just this purpose. Thanks for the great recipe! Will be making this often. :)"
"6","5","This is a really good, simple recipe. I used about 8 slices of cinnamon raisin bread and half and half. I used splender rather than regular sugar."
"6","5","Quick, easy and delicious. We do not usually eat dessert, but an enexpected dinner guest prompted me to figure out something I could do with what I had on hand. It turned out beautifully. We may be eating dessert more often now!"
"6","5","Great recipe! I used pepperidge farm cinnamon swirl bread and it was delicious. I also made a sauce I found from another bread pudding recipe to accompany it, and the sauce absolutely made the dessert! Here is the recipe: While pudding cools, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a large saucepan. While stirring, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and stir 3 minutes more. Spoon over warm bread pudding."
"6","5","This was great! I doubled the recipe and didn't change a thing. Not too runny and not too dry...excellent! The flavor was perfect too! Thanks."
"6","5","I'm absolutely THRILLED with this recipe. I imagine it'll be made frequently in my house. Thank you!"
"6","5","I have used this recipe many times. and really love it. I usually use 8 slices of bread,instead of 6, and sometimes add 1/2 cup of chopped Walnuts. YUMMY ..... Its a great addition. This recipe is only as limited as your imagination"
"6","5","I made this for my Dad who is going through chemotherapy. We are trying to put some weight back on him and I made it with heavy cream instead of milk and added two more tablespoons of butter. He ate half of it with his fingers before he even got it home! It was wonderful and so rich. I know most people want to cut back on calories, but for an indulgence try it this way. I used a mixture of french bread and yeast rolls."
"6","5","Very good recipe. I followed a few of the suggestions of other reviewers: 8 slices bread, 3 tablespoons butter, 4 eggs, 2 cups milk, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.   Wonderful dessert; my husband, a very picky eater, loved this recipe and said it was 'perfect'.   Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!"
"6","5","used cinnamon loaf from Trader Joes, wonderful!"
"6","5","This is the best bread pudding recipe I've tried. It was so easy and very moist! All I had on hand was wheat bread, and it still turned out great! I will definitely be making it again soon."
"6","4","Just made it, but rather than using a pan, I used a muffin/cupcake pan for easy serving. Everyone else in the house thought it was great, despite the fact that I had forgotten the other 2/4 cups of sugar I had meant to put in (oops, haha..). Anyway, sweetness aside, I thought the pudding went past being moist, and went straight to being wet. I would definitely reduce the amount of eggs to 3 next time I make it, and omit 1/4th cups of milk. I love cinnamon, and I would reccomend adding 1/2 of a teaspoon into the milk and egg mixture if you feel the same way. I think 1/2 of a teaspoon of nutmeg would probably add some depth to the flavor, and make it what I would consider a perfect bread pudding."
"6","5","Try this with a rum sauce...vary the breads used (cinnamon swirl, raisin, donuts, pastries, etc). Wonderful!!"
"5","5","I've made this twice now, and it is wonderful. Today I substituted half and half for the milk, frozen huckleberries for the raisins, and I added a handful of walnuts to the top. I like more cinnamon, so I doubled the amount called for. Just before baking, I lightly sprinkled the top with organic cane sugar. Lastly, I made a sauce of 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup heavy cream, and 1/8 cup whiskey. I brought this to a boil, let it cool slightly, and then spooned the sauce over individual servings of the bread pudding. Incredible!"
"5","5","Love bread pudding! If I'd known its this easy to make bread pudding I would of made it a long time ago. It was super good, even my picky eater son liked it. I think my bread slices were too thin though, so mine turned out to be bread pudding on the top and flan on the bottom. But I love flan too, so I'm not complaining...lol Next time I'll use thicker bread."
"5","5","This recipe is awesome! After reading the reviews, I used a french baguette & added 1/4c. milk extra to make it less eggy and used splenda brown sugar instead of regular sugar to make is sugar free. Topped it off with a scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream while still warm.. HEAVEN!!! I had to control myself to keep from going back for seconds. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"5","5","I was able to make some changes and reduce this to 75 calories per serving. :) I used fat free milk, I can't believe it's not butter (light), an apple instead of raisins and 18 packets of Splenda instead of sugar. It was delicious. You can top it with light whip cream and still be under 100 calories!!!"
"5","5","This is a fantastic basic bread pudding recipe. Because it is so simple and basic, it is easy to personalize with your own twists without worrying about it not being tasty! My twists this time were... * I used whipping cream instead of milk because I had it on hand and other people were planning on helping me consume the decadent dessert! I've also used all evaporated milk - yum! * I melted butter with cinnamon, nutmeg, and dark brown sugar, added chopped gala apples, and let cook for about 10 minutes. I poured this on top of the bread instead of just melted butter. * instead of the regular sugar, I used dark brown sugar for the molasses flavor. This also rendered a slightly less intense sweetness yet more natural sweetness that was fantastic with the apples. * my audience was not a fan of raisins, so I left them out. I've included them in other versions after soaking them in liqueur. This is a fun way of pizzazzing the recipe..."
"5","5","I used a loaf of french bread and made it exactly as the recipe stated (doubled it), and cooked it maybe 10 minutes longer (just because I like it a little crisper) and it turned out perfect!"
"5","5","Highly recommend this recipe.UPDATE***Made this evening with what I had. French bread cut in small pieces, used 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2, 1 cup evaporated canned milk, 4 eggs,2 tsp. vanilla extract and SPLENDA BROWN SUGAR (3/4 CUP) AND extra cinnamon. ( did egg whites in mixer til triple, then I added egg yolks, sugar, all milk including 1/2 & 1/2 I did drizzle about 4 TBSP. melted butter on top of bread mixture and a small amount of 1/2 &1/2 also on top of bread mixture in pan before baking. DELICIOUS. SO happy with this bread pudding. Thanks for sharing."
"5","3","This was a pretty good recipe but not the best I ever made either. Good for when you want to make a quick bread pudding!"
"5","5","So yummy and easy! It was a big hit at our Labor Day BBQ. Doubled the recipe for a 9X13 pan and reduced eggs as other suggested. Love the fact that you don't have to bake in a water bath. A definite keeper!"
"5","5","My son loves bread pudding so I tried this a couple of weeks ago and it was not that great. Tried again yesterday and it was the best bread pudding - reminded me of my Mom's bread pudding when I was a child. Did not change anything in the recipe except added a little more cinnamon."
"5","5","Made several times. Ensure good mixture of the eggs so it isn't like french bread."
"5","5","This was very easy to make, and resulted in a lovely bread pudding. I was out of vanilla, so I substituted brandy instead - the result was great!"
"5","5","I made this with a few additions: added 1 small can fruit cocktail and changed white sugar to brown, and only 1/2 cup. For milk, used 1 small can sweetened condensed milk and added it to reg. milk to make the 2 cups required. Served with cool whip topping and family went crazy!!!!!!!!! Good use for stale bread.....Thanks Ellenmarie!"
"5","5","I made this tonight and after 3 servings (by myself) I had to put it away! It was so easy using items on hand and delicious!! This one is a keeper!"
"5","5","I used a 3 day old french baguette that I hadn't gotten to - it worked great and made for a very pretty finished product. I used extra bread and a deeper dish, so I upped the eggs to 6, and added an extra 1/2 cup of skim milk. It came out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe. Don't be afraid to use stale/very dry bread - it turns out great!"
"5","5","This is a keeper. I used all 4 eggs, skim milk, reduced sugar to 1/2 c, and added 2 squares of chopped semisweet chocolate. A cooking time of 45 minutes was right on for me. I used half a loaf of old Italian bread with the crusts on - and when I say old, I mean OLD! It was totally dried out and rock hard, and the bread pudding STILL came out moist and delicious."
"5","4","The flavor is outstanding. But it was very 'wet,' whereas I prefer a drier bread pudding. I picked some off the top but couldn't really eat a bowl of it because it was so custardy. I would definitely try this again, but maybe add an extra egg and decrease the milk a bit."
"5","5","I have made this recipe several times over the past couple of weeks. I have found that hard French bread works the best for this recipe. Like other reviewers I only use 3 eggs and I add 1\2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I mix up all the ingredients and put the bread in the bowl so that it absorbs all of the liquid. Once absorbed I pour into the baking dish and bake for an hour. I have tried this recipe using regular slice bread and I found that 6 slices is not enough, it is better to use as much bread as possible to soak up the mixture or you will have an egg/custard type outcome. I also made this recipe using sour dough and it still came out great, even tough I went overboard with the amount of bread used. Overall, my family LOVES IT!"
"5","5","Before I made this recipe, I didn't know if even liked bread pudding, so it was an experiment. I had almost a whole loaf of day-old Italian bread that was getting pretty stale. I didn't want to waste it so I found this recipe. I used the exact ingredients and amounts (including all 4 eggs) with two exceptions. First, I used a heaping half cup of sugar, not 3/4 cup to cut it down just a smidgen. I also used about 2/3 of a loaf of Italian bread. I cut it into thick, 1 inch slices, then into 1x1 cubes. I used golden raisins and also threw in a small handful of craisins. Beause of the extra bread, I had to let it soak in the egg/milk mixture for a few minutes and push it all down well with a fork to get all of the bread saturated. It turned out great - not soggy, wet or eggy. I prefer it warm, so I've been reheating the leftovers in the microwave. Yum!"
"5","4","A good traditional bread pudding - according to my british inlaws (they even turned a blind eye to the bits of egg white that didn't mix!). The only thing I changed was to cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, as suggested by other reviewers. Wish I had used the full amount though. We all agreed the pudding wasn't sweet enough (I had to bring the sugar pot to the table) and it needed more spices. Would try this recipe again."
"5","5","I didn't have high expectations from this basic recipe, I just wanted to see if I could make a decent pudding, after tasting this dessert for the first time last month. I was so wrong! It was easy, quick, economical, and most of all delicious! We were pleasantly surprised. I may use 1 less egg the next time, and only 1/2 cup sugar. Thanks for sharing!"
"5","5","WOW!!!! Everyone LOVED and DEVOURED this when I made it. I was never a fan of Bread Pudding until I tried this one. It is truly DELICIOUS!!! I took the advice of a few others on this site and made the following changes: Used Half and Half instead of Milk, Used Peppridge Farm Raisin Swirl Bread and omitted the raisins. Added 1/4 cup of Brown Sugar. Used Turbinado sugar in place of the granulated sugar. I served this with the Vanilla Sauce recipe I found on this site. I did NOT reduce the amount of eggs, I increased the number of slices of bread to about 12 and used a 7 X 11 inch glass pan instead of the 8 X 8. Give it a try, it is FABULOUS!!!"
"5","5","This is the best recipe for bread pudding. I doubled the recipe using whole wheat french bread and added an extra 2 eggs + 1 cup milk to keep it moist."
"5","5","I made this easy recipe last night and it was delicious!! The house smelled wonderful, my husband could hardly wait for it to cook. He's from the south and his whole family cooks the 'old' southern way and he said this was the best bread pudding he had ever had. Believe me, that was a GREAT compliment. With this recipe, you can't go wrong! I'd give it a 5++++ if I could!"
"5","5","Easily the best bread pudding I've ever had and a ridiculously easy recipe too! I doubled this recipe and made a point to use fluffy white country bread from a loaf from the bakery counter at my supermarket, I cut the bread into squares. The kind of bread you use makes a huge differnece, the fluffier, the better because fluffy bread is much better at absorbing the egg and milk mix thoroughly. thicker and denser breads won't work as well. Depending on how rich you like your bread pudding, you could use either 3% homogenized milk or for a low fat option, use skim milk.  Here in Quebec, warm bread pudding is fantastic with fresh maple syrup, you could top this with just about anything, fresh whipped cream, sliced berries etc.  This recipes offers such an excellent base that there's plenty of room to experiment and try out your own preferences."
"5","5","I left the raisins out because my boyfriend isn't a fan, and it came out smelling and tasting delicious! Great breakfast recipe!"
"5","3","I think the secret of a good bread pudding is to let the pudding mellow out in the fridge for a few hours or even overnight so it is not wet but yummy and custardy. A keeper! UPDATE...We downgraded from 5 stars to 3 stars since this is not so good leftover, next morning. It lost the custardy luciousness and was just so-so."
"5","5","Very delicious bread pudding. I changed a couple of things per other people's comments. I just used 3 eggs instead of 4. I also used a whole loaf of cinnamon bread and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It came out really good and tastes even better cold for breakfast. I like this bread pudding recipe because it is not runny or too much egg taste."
"5","5","I made this with banana bread, substituting chocolate chips for the raisins. It helps to let it set about 30 mins before putting it in the oven so the bread soaks up the egg mixture."
"5","3","I just made this after reading all the reviews and I was a bit disappointed. Perhaps it's because I used day old italian bread from the restaurant but the bread was crunchy on top and on the bottom it seemed like scrambled eggs! After some hesitation, I tasted it and found that it was still edible but it looked horrible. Was I supposed to let the mixture soak into the bread before baking?"
"5","5","Holy-square-dish of deliciousness! YUM! I used a smallish french baguette (about 12 1-inch slices) and 1/4 cup white sugar plus 1/4 brown sugar. Did I mention how scrumptious it was? And it was so easy to make!"
"5","5","This is very good bread pudding, however I like it best when still warm from the oven (don't like it once it's been refrigerated). I double the recipe. The original recipe says it serves 12 - not the way we eat it!! I let it sit about 10 minutes before putting in the oven to let mixture soak into bread. I sprinkle some brown sugar on the top too. I REST a piece of foil on top for first 20 minutes and sometimes at the end to prevent over-browning."
"5","5","WOW!!! I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan and used the Pannetone bread I bought for the holiday!!! Following other 'advice' I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar (remember this was a double recipe) and sprinkled just a few raisins (since there were currants and orange chunks in the pannetone). I also added a handful of tollhouse choc chips for an added flare (it is the holidays, you know). Wonderful recipe!!!!!!! Happy Holidays to everyone!!!"
"5","5","I had a poor loaf of stale french bread that I didn't want to go to waste, so I decided to make bread pudding. I only had about a half cup of milk so I used half and half, heavy cream and about 1/8 cup of Amaretto to make it to 2 cups. I used less eggs like everyone recommended and since I used Amaretto, which is pretty sweet I added less sugar and threw in some slivered almonds and golden raisins. It took a little longer in the oven but came out absolutely amazing, the Amaretto gives it a such sweet punch."
"5","4","I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used 3 eggs (instead of 4) and sprinkled about 1/2 c. brown sugar over top before baking. I chose to bake mine with wheat bread (it's all I had), but I think it would be better with white. I'm going to tweak the recipe a bit on my own, but I can work with this one."
"5","5","I made this bread for my mom for Mother's Day because Bread Pudding is her favorite dessert. I had never made bread pudding before but I thought this recipe sounded easy and good. It was just that! It was so easy and it was VERY Good my mom said that it was the best she has ever had (and she wasn't just saying it because I made it for her). I used 3 eggs and used 1/2cup sugar and 1/2 cup brn sugar I also spinkled some cinnamon on the top and added some nuts. I had a recipe for a burbon topping which came from better homes and garden baking cookbook and that was a GREAT topping for it. My husband wasn't sure about bread pudding but after said that was very good I was suprised and now I get to make some more for us! Thanks for the great recipe I will share it with everyone!!!"
"5","5","Good recipe, great with a few changes. I used cinnamon raisin bread, added peaches. I also made it with 3 eggs as another reviewer suggested. My family and friends raved, and want more."
"5","5","This recipe is fantastic. I was another person who never liked bread pudding growing up, but recently gave it another try with this recipe as I had some stale bread that needed used up. I wouldn't suggest reducing the amount of eggs/sugar like a few other people have, as mine turned out perfect. The only suggestion that I agree with is dividing the sugar into 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown, and perhaps upping the cinnamon a little. Otherwise, the texture and flavor were great."
"5","5","I've made this recipe several times, and it is delicious! I double it and use a 9x13 pan. I have discovered that different types of bread may affect the outcome, 'wet' or 'dry', but it's always good, no matter which kind I use!"
"5","5","Mmmmm... Springy, soft and moist, almost like french toast. Glad I took the advice of the previous reviewers and decreased the eggs to just three or it would have been too 'eggy,' since you can already taste it. I think next time though I might decrease the milk to 1 3/4 cup or 1 1/2 cup and add a *little* more cinnamon, some bits of apples and perhaps a some honey. Other than that, it did come out rather yummy and who knew bread pudding could be so easy to make! Oh and by the way I used Sara Lee honey white bread and since I don't have any square baking pans, I used a cake pan (lol) ...delicious! Will make it for Christmas."
"5","5","This bread pudding recipe is my favorite by far. I've made this multiple times, and it always turns out great! Sometimes, I've used cinnamon-raisin bread, and it tastes even better. I've also used vanilla soy milk and it tastes declicious!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"5","5","This was excellent, the only thing I changed was using 1/2 & 1/2 and only 1/2 the amount of cinnamon called for. Otherwise, it was the PERFECT texture and taste! Thank you SOOO much Ellen, finally a bread pudding recipe my old southern mother-in-law said was good, twice!!"
"5","5","I had never made bread pudding before, so I searched through dozens of recipes before finding this easy-to-make recipe. I halfed the ingredients because I only needed to feed two people. It turned out fabulous! Thanks to the person who submitted this great recipe. :)"
"4","5","Excellent even when made exclusively with whole wheat crusts and heels! I have a child who decided to never eat a crust again when he turned four (he's now six). After leaving them on for months and watching the waste, I finally started cutting off the crusts and putting them in the freezer. Now, I regularly use them in this recipe. I love that the heels and crusts my son refuses to touch normally are turned into something he loves! All four of us love it, in fact. And no wasted crusts and heels. When I'm ready to make it, I take the crusts and heels out of the freezer in the morning and let them thaw. In the afternoon, I put them in the oven for a bit. Then I break it up and use it. I try to stick to the recipe as written, but it is very forgiving. I often use three eggs instead of four. I have never used the raisins. Often we pour milk on our portions before eating. It's deliciously sweet and yummy as written. So much so, that I might cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup. Not because it's too sweet but just to experiment with how 'healthy' I can make it and still make it lovable. Thank you for an awesome, versatile, simple recipe!"
"4","4","After making Italian Bread Bowls from this site, I had some leftover chunks of white bread. This was the perfect recipe for the leftovers. After reading the ingredients list I made some alterations according to my preference. The bread pudding turned out great. This will be so good reheated gently for breakfast, with a steaming cup of bitter coffee. I used an 8' Pyrex pan and almost 4.5 cups of bread (exactly 4 might have been even better), 3 eggs instead of 4, subbed 1/4 cups of the milk with half-and-half, used 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup light brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and used about 1/3 cup dates and 1/3 cup sultana raisins."
"4","5","Very impressive! So delicious. This is my first time making bread pudding and I don't remember if I ever actually tasted it before. I was skeptical as to how it would turn out since bread soaked in milk didn't seem all that appealing to me. But, since I had a whole baguette of french bread, I decided to give bread pudding a try. It was either that, or throw the baguette away since I couldn't think of anything else to make. I used 3/4 of the baguette and will use the rest to make more bread pudding since it turned out so well.   I followed the original recipe and made the pudding in a 9x13 pan. I'm not sure how many slices of french bread I used since I just tore off chunks until I had enough to fill the pan. I used a bit less sugar - 1.25 cups instead of 1.5 cups. I used the 8 eggs as recommended in the recipe (since I doubled the recipe), 4 cups of milk, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and since I didn't have ground cinnamon I added a couple dashes of nutmeg. It took longer than 45 min to cook, but that's ok! It turned out amazing. It was crispy, but not too much so - on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. It was a bit too sweet, I will decrease the sugar to 1 cup next time.   I'm not sure what other reviewers were talking about when they complained that it was too soggy... I let it cool before digging in and the inside firmed up from soggyish to moist within 5-10 min of cooling. I omitted the raisins since I didn't have any on hand. So easy to make!"
"4","4","I love this recipe, and it's really easy to 'tweak' to alternate specifications. I've found it's great with nuts in addition to or instead of raisins. If you don't like a custard-y texture, halve the eggs. Also, you can easily triple the bread and only double the other ingredients. As I said, it's a really easy recipe to play around with!"
"4","5","Delicious. Made with regular ol' white bread. Added 2 slices extra. Doubled the vanilla. Sprinkled sugar on the top before baking. Baked for 40 min, then broiled for 5 min to give it a crunchy top. Omitted raisins. This is a keeper."
"4","4","I made too much banana bread and decided to use this recipe with the extras. I added blueberries and used 3 eggs and it turned out amazing! Super delicious. I will definitely be making this again."
"4","5","Yum! I added only three eggs, not four, substituted 1 cup of regular milk for rice milk, and didn't have white sugar so i substituted it for brown. I also decide to use some leftover pancakes instead of bread and it turned out amazingly! I was very impressed and would definitely recommend this recipe. Raisins absolutely make this dish, even though they are written as optional."
"4","5","Soooo good! I used wheat loaf bread and brown sugar instead of white as I didn't have any. Turned out excellent."
"4","4","I normally don't like bread pudding but my husband does so I searched for a recipe and found this one. Here's what I did: Used half a loaf of stale French bread from the deli which was maybe 10-12 slices. Omitted raisins, used 3 tablespoons butter instead of 2, 3 eggs instead of 4 (per several reviews), used half n half instead of milk. Then I added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I put the pan in the fridge for a couple hours since I wasn't ready to bake it. I think that was key because it really soaked up the liquid. I baked it for 55 minutes for a less custardy pudding. My husband and I both enjoyed this very much but I think next time I make it I will up the sugar to one cup. It just wasn't sweet enough and I'm not one to like overly sweet desserts. I will try 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I'm also going to cut back on the nutmeg to 1/8 tsp and maybe sprinkle chopped pecans over the top before I bake it. I think I will also cut the baking time by 5 minutes since it was just on the verge of becoming dry. If I remember, I'll come back and do an update."
"4","5","Fantastic, easy, delicious. I substituted with almond milk (1 and 2/3 cups) and put in the optional raisins. So wonderfully easy! Hope you love it as much as my family does. Also, I added just a splash of almond extract. Loved the aroma while it cooked and you could taste it too!"
"4","4","This is a great recipe. I replace the raisins with dried cranberries and add orange zest and juice."
"4","5","This is delicious! Made it just a bit bigger in a 9X13 pan since I had so many dinner rolls left over. Just added 4 tables spoons of butter, a half cup of milk and 1 egg more than recipe for this size. When still warm served with heavy cream. YUMMMM"
"4","5","This was good. My husband says it's the best bread pudding i've made. We found it to be not TOO sweet. I didn't use raisins because I didn't have any, and I used another reviewers suggestion of adding a 1/4 cup of brown sugar (which I wouldn't have added if I used raisins). This cooked about an hour which was perfect (we are at a high elevation). Super easy recipe which turned out delicious! EDIT: August 2015. Substitute 1/4 cup of brown sugar for regular sugar."
"4","5","Yum-o! So good, but I did make a few changes like the other reviewers said: I used raisin swirl bread, and if it wasn't day old I popped it on a cookie sheet in the oven until firm. Also, I used anywhere from 9-12 pieces of bread. 12 if the pieces are small, like the raisin break usually is. I use golden raisins as a topping and instead of milk I use pure half-half. A little note: whisk the eggs good!!! If you don't you'll get globs of egg and it's gross. Also: Serve with fresh whipped cream!"
"4","5","The best Bread Pudding ever! My family loves Bread Pudding so I have to double the recipe or listen to them complain when it’s gone too quickly. I've made this recipe several times; sometimes as written and sometimes with a few tweaks to match my current mood. Tweaks I’ve made: about a ½ cup less of the milk, sugar ½ white ½ brown. Add a ¼ tsp nutmeg per recipe (so ½ tsp for a double batch). Also, I like it dense so I don’t really count the bread, just tear it up until the pan (13x9) is about ½ way to the top, gently but closely compacted. The milk mixture just covers the bread after using a fork to gently push anything sticking out down. I do live at about 6000 feet so I do have to modify baking time and temp slightly. High Altitude changes: pre-heat oven to 370. After putting the dish into the oven, drop the temp back down to 350 and back 45 to 50 minutes."
"4","5","This is SOOOO good! I didn't change a thing, except I used the vanilla sauce recipe from this site on top of the bread pudding (and did not add raisins). My family requests this ALL THE TIME..I think it's the best bread pudding I've ever had!"
"4","5","This is the recipe that I make most often, especially for guests, because it's so easy to put together and I always get rave reviews! I add bits of chocolate instead of raisins, and serve it with vanilla ice-cream. It tastes just as good with fresh bread as it does with day-old bread. Incredible!"
"4","4","Yummy, 1tsp cinnamon is a bit much, could cut back a little on the sugar too. It looked too soupy so I added 1 more slice of bread. Overall good. Will try again with the alterations and see how it compares."
"4","5","I smashed some ripened bananas in the egg/milk mixture and it was delicious! Thank you!"
"4","5","I love recipes that allow room for creativity such as this one. I used the insides of artisan rolls (which were very large and dense), some sliced Italain bread, and for good measure half a blueberry muffin. I used an oval ceramic dish for baking and all of the ingredients were a perfect fit. Added roasted pecans in with the raisins and used  splenda-brown and white. For the milk I used skimmed, and it was just PERFECT. The only complaint I have was that some of the raisins weren't pushed under the milk/bread mixture enough and they burned. MY fault...just be sure you push them way down in the mixture."
"4","5","Excellent. Used leftover cornbread and 1 C frozen blueberries. We had guests for dinner and served this for dessert...everyone raved over it. Definitely a keeper!"
"4","5","Yummy! I cut the recipe in half for 2 people and still had leftovers. Used up some large pieces of light rye bread. Replaced the chocolate chipits with 1/4 cup butterscotch chipits (the baking smell was awesome). Also replaced the sugar with a reduced amount of honey. Used two ripe bananas. I found that it took a while for the egg mixture to set (I used the water bath - no tea towel) so I took my souffle pan out of the bath after an hour and baked it directly on the oven rack for ~ 15 minutes more."
"4","5","This was great! I like the custard style it makes. The only thing I did differently was add 2 slices of bread as someone else had suggested. I used plain store brand bread."
"4","5","This recipe is the same one we use in our family. The only change is I toast the slices of bread and spread the butter on before I cut them into cubes. Raisens really add to this pudding"
"4","5","I used whole wheat cinnamon raisin bread that I was going to throw away - so glad I didn't! First time I made this recipe, I didn't let the bread dry out and ended with what resembled flan on the bottom (liquid didn't soak). Second time, I left the bread on the baking dish for a day or so, which soaked up the liquid. Added some walnuts to the mix on a whim, which tasted great. Thanks for an easy recipe."
"4","4","Very good. Had 2 leftover italian breads. Doubled receipe. Only used 6 eggs. One little box of raisins. Extra cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. 1/2/n 1/2 for one cup and 3 cups lowfat milk. Friends said very good and hubby and daughter enjoyed it too!"
"4","5","I am not a bread pudding fan, but this was fantastic. I used one less egg than the recipe called for and a little more bread (I used leftover french bread), just so there wasn't any liquid in the bottom. I also put a few pats of butter on top and sprinkled with sugar. Delish!"
"4","5","this is the best bread pudding i've done so far! i read some reviews and decided to use 3 egss instead to avoid the pudding being soggy.it turned out perfect texture.i added some toasted chopped walnuts to give it some crunch n nutty flavor. This recipe is superdooper easy n yummie!!definitely making it again n again..."
"4","4","Pretty good! I kept pretty close to the original recipe, making a few changes based on the suggestions of other reviews. I used day-old French bread (cutting off some of the crust) cut into cubes. I added a pinch of nutmeg and a little vanilla to the milk & egg mixture. I let the bread soak in the liquid for nearly 2 hours before baking. The bread pudding looked lovely coming out of the oven. The top was a nice, toasty brown. It also smelled heavenly. The bottom half of the pudding was moist and like a custard. The top was a little more dry, but the combination worked pretty well. I think that next time, I will use some half-and-half or heavy cream in place of some of the milk. I'm also going to try using Brioche, as I think that texture will work well for bread pudding. This is a good base recipe that leaves room for experimentation."
"4","4","This was my first time to have or make bread pudding, and it was a pretty good experience. It reminded me a lot of the overnight french toast, as it has similiar ingredients. I halved the recipe and would have rather used an 8x8 pan than the loaf pan I went with. After an hour, it was still slightly gooey in the middle. I used an extra 2 slices of bread and used one less egg than required. My toddler loved this with the modifications!"
"4","5","This is one of the best bread pudding recipes here on the site. I have tried several, but keep coming back to this one because of its simplicity. I have used differant breads and then tried something differant. I had made a batch of homemade cinnamon rolls and had so many left over that I thought of using them in this recipe. All I changed was lowering the sugar to 1/3 cup because of so much sugar already in the cinnamon rolls. I made sure to add the raisins of course and my goodness, what a wonderful sweet surprise! Thank you so much for this recipe, Ellenmarie!"
"4","5","This is it, the ultimate bread pudding recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was VERY sweet. I saw some reviewers say they added 1/2 cup of brown sugar...that would have been WAY too sweet for my family and we're junk food junkies!"
"4","5","Very good bread pudding, I use golden raisens and sprinkle the top with cinamin sugar just before putting it in the over. Beautiful dessert!"
"4","5","I've made this wonderful recipe several times and especially love it this time of year. I keep bread ends (white, whole wheat, rolls, whatever) in a bag in the freezer until I have enough. This is one of our family's favorites. Inexpensive too."
"4","5","Used left over sourdough french bread.  Also used canned coconut milk instead of regular milk. Turned out very good.  Also made a sauce to pour over it. Sauce : butter, coconut milk, coconut rum, kaluhua, sugar, vanilla. Cooked it till it reduced and thickened a bit."
"4","5","I'm changing this to five stars, when I first made it I didn't use the butter and it as dry, but after making it again (and adding bananas) with butter it was WONDERFUL!"
"4","5","My boyfriend who loves to eat [and never cooked before] loved making this bread pudding! The flavor was perfect! We substituted Splenda for the sugar. Awesome recipe!"
"4","5","I doubled this reciped and made it with chopped apples and topped it with pecans. This goes perfect with the vanilla sauce from this site."
"4","4","I used a cinnamon apple bread, and because it was fresh (not day old) I baked it on a low temperature to dry it out. I soaked my raisins overnight in whiskey - that certainly added a nice flavor to the bread. As another reviewer mentioned, my batch turned out too eggy, so next time I'll try only three eggs. Otherwise, the dish turned out nicely and tasted even better the next day."
"4","5","this recipe was easy and yummy. i took the advice of an earlier review and used 3 eggs instead of 4 and it was perfect! i covered it with a vanilla sauce recipe submitted by Diane. it disappeared quickly and i've been told i have to make it for christmas also."
"4","4","DO NOT USE SPLENDA!! It would have been pretty good if I had not used splenda. For some reason it just had an awful aftertaste. When I do make it again, I will probably add more cinnamon or even just put in 2 teaspoons on pumpkin pie spice. I may try to use pumpkin bread next time and see how that turns out."
"4","5","This was soooo good!!! I used only 3 eggs and added 1/4 cup of light brown sugar. I also added semi-sweet morsels. My husband loved it!! Super easy!!! I will make this again."
"4","5","This was awesome. I followed Amy's adjustments and also added some chocolate chips. Huge hit!"
"4","5","Wonderful! This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! I topped the dish off by drizzling a vanilla glaze over the entire top. If interested, look up 'vanilla glaze' on this site and try it! Fair warning though, if using the 'vanilla glaze' recipe from this website, make sure to use more milk than the recipe calls for; it was a typo on the submitter's part. The two make a fantastic pair!!!"
"4","5","Delicious. I love using thick Texas Toast or cubed french bread. I also double the vanilla and add extra cinnamon."
"4","5","My husband and I fought over the last piece, it's that good. We go to Disney all the time and this reminds me of the bread pudding at the Polynesian's Ohana... yummmmmm..... excellent. I made it just like the first reviewer with brown sugar and vanilla sauce and pepperidge farm bread :::sigh::: sheer bliss!"
"4","5","Like many others, used 3 eggs, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and sprinkled on a little nutmeg ..... What an awesome recipe... definite keeper .. we love it !!"
"4","5","1 less egg, 2c of milk and 2c of 1/2 and 1/2, a little extra butter and hint of nutmeg......added two lg banannas helped to keep pudding nice and moist with just a hint of extra flavor!"
"4","5","i made this with the amish white bread featured on this site and put instant chai in the milk! yummalicious!"
"4","5","I just tried this and was delighted with the results. I had about 1/2 of a loaf of regular white bread I needed to get rid of, and decided to try my hand at this. I went ahead and used 12 pieces instead of the 6, keeping the regular amount of milk and eggs. I also let the bread/milk mixture soak for ten mins before baking, and added nutmeg and allspice instead of the cinnamon. I boiled the raisins for about 2 mins before adding them, and made a mix of 1/4 c brown sugar, and the 3/4 c white sugar and put it on top instead of mixing it in.  I chilled it until cold, and it tastes wonderful; not eggy at all, creamy and smooth."
"4","5","This was my first time making and trying bread pudding and I was 100% satisfied! This recipe was very simple and delicious! I took the advice of previous posters and used cinnamon raisin bread and omitted the extra raisins. I also used 8 slices rather than 6 and did not find the dish 'eggy' at all. I can't wait to make this one again!"
"4","5","I am always asked for the recipe when I make this. Try substituting some/all of the raisins for dates!"
"4","5","I've made this recipe twice. The second time I added a little bit of oat and wheat bran to add some fiber to make a better breakfast food, and left out 1/3 cup sugar.  Delicious as a dessert sans modifications, and a lovely way to start the day. Mmmmm."
"4","5","This is a delicious, warm, spiced comfort food. I find myself eating the pudding for breakfast, lunch and dessert. I've never even tasted bread pudding before! I used 3 eggs and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the base recipe. I sprinkled 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup chopped pecans on top. Served with a little heavy cream it is Perfect!"
"4","1","Not good. Very eggy.Sorry wont make it again."
"4","5","Yep, is that good, just as everyone is saying. Last night, even though the weather was very hot, I felt the urge to eat something conforting, this hit just the spot, easy to do, and very satisfying. And, if you notice, is very low in calories, too!.  Because I was going for a bread pudding similar to the one we eat at our fave joint, I halved the teaspoon of cinnamon in half and added half a lemon zest, I also mixed half cup of the sugar with milk and added the rest (quarter cup) in brown sugar on the top. I made it with skim milk and it didn't seem to change the custardly texture a bit. I added the raisins, but I used about a quarter cup, only. Oh and I used three eggs, just as almost every reviewer.  We had it warm with cream drizzled with honey and it was scrumptious, I had it this morning cold with milk and it was delicious as well.  Wonderful!."
"4","1","I was very disappointed with this recipe. The only change I made was to substitute half of the milk with cream. While the texture was OK (give it a little time to set or it will be very mushy) the taste was very bland. I was expecting a cinnamony and sweet bread pudding...what I got was bland french toast."
"4","5","Bread pudding is my mom's favorite desert. Her b-day was this past Friday and she came in too town Saturday to celebrate her b-day and mother's day. I tried this recipe rather than making her a b-day cake and it was a hit. She loved it and it was my first attempt at making it. She just called me and said hey don't forget to email me that recipe so I can make some because I just finished the last of what you sent me back with...Thank you so much...My kids and everyone loves this..didn't change a thing...Pamela"
"4","4","This was very good. I made warm custard and poured it over it. It did seem to take a little longer to cook than the directions stated."
"4","5","I brought this to my supper club dinner, and everyone complimented it. I incorporated some suggestions from other reviews. I used 2 cups half & half (instead of milk), 3 eggs, 1/2 C white sugar plus 1/2 C brown (instead of all white), and I added a dash of nutmeg. Oh--I made half with raisins, and half without, as some people seem to have strong preferences one way or the other. I would definitely make this again. It was totally yummy!"
"4","5","Excellent! BF loved it - even though he didn't know what it was (bread pudding isn't a big thing here in Holland). I added walnuts along with bits of apple that had been lightly fried in a bit of butter & cinnamon. I also followed the suggestions re: using 3 eggs and brown/white sugar combo. Can't wait to make this again."
"4","5","Really Good! I added a chopped apple and a dash of nutmeg, but followed recipe exactly besides those changes. Mine seemed to need an extra 15 min in the oven, but baked perfectly with the extra time. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"4","5","Yummy! I made it with splenda and splenda brown sugar...it tasted the same! also used 1% milk, and added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I served it with creme anglaise which tasted like a vanilla creme brulee.... perfection!!"
"4","5","Well, guys, that’s it! I was looking for some recipe to use old bread or buns and I found it!!!! Very easy to make. Taste good. I would not describe its taste as a great, but among bread puddings this is a winner so far. I have kept the recipe.  Following recommendations of previous users, I added 3 eggs only; baked for 50 min. Also, I am not a huge fan of cinnamon, so instead of full tsp, I put ½. Instead of bread I used 8 hot dog old buns. I did not want my pudding creamy. It turned very moist and tender, but in the same time spongy! I love its consistency! However, next time I am going to make several changes: instead of 2 cups of milk, I’m going to add 1 cup of milk & 1 cup of sour cream or cream. Also I am very interested in experimenting with blueberries, bananas or apples. I’ll probably try all three one by one."
"4","5","WOW this is the best recipe!I did as others suggested I used three eggs instead of 4. I also did the suggestion of 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I too also added more Cinnamon and soaked the rasins. I baked for 50 minutes and it came out perfect! FANTASTIC!!  I doubled it so I could make it in the 9x13 it came out as follows: 12slices of bread, 6 egss, 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tsp Cinnamon. where the changes.  Will make this many many more times!"
"4","4","I don't come from a 'bread pudding' background at all but I really enjoyed the taste of this recipe. I found the texture a little mushy and will reduce the number of eggs to 3 the next time I make it. Also, the raisins were dried out and a bit scorched so I would either nix them next time or buy a different kind of raisin. Other than that, my whole family really enjoyed the flavour and it's going to be on our table for Christmas breakfast!"
"4","1","This was okay, but I have definitely had better bread pudding! I think this recipe had too much cinnamon and something else was missing. Also, this was done in 30 minutes, and actually starting to burn around the edges--not 45 minutes as the recipe says."
"4","5","Fantastic recipe! I used day-old French bread which worked perfectly - it soaked up the mixture very well. My husband, who is quite particular about his bread pudding, ate close to the entire dish in one sitting."
"4","5","This is a wonderful and delicious bread pudding. It made up in no time at all and was eaten in no time at all. Highly recommend. ThankYou!"
"4","3","A little too sweet for our taste."
"3","5","Excellent bread pudding! I use Challah bread and omit the raisins since I don't like them. I also let it sit in the fridge a couple hours before baking so the bread really soaks up the custard. This adds to the cooking time, but as long as you look for the spring back, it will be excellent."
"3","5","Custard lovers will love this! French toast lovers will love this! But if you don't fall into that category or if you must have that bread pudding that grandma made or you had on that trip to Ireland in '75 you will scratch your head and wonder what all of us are raving on about. I love the eggy custard side and the crunch topping of sweet bread. If you look up WikiCookbook, this exact recipe is there. So, naysayers, post your own recipe of lumpy, dry bread-pudding that drops like a brick. You won't find that here. That said, you will also have a raisin/no raisin camp. I do not spoil my sweet breakfast with raisins, unless they are soaked in rum and put on with a sauce. I have made this recipe 4 times since finding it last month and the kids come out of the woodwork when the aroma hits. I DO ADD NUTMEG! Like eggnog! Once I was rushed and forgot the sugar. That first bite hit me and I laughed and drizzled on REAL maple syrup. That pan was gobbled up in seconds. I use 2% milkfat milk and find no loss in texture. One time I did not have enough milk and used half 'n' half for the remainder and found no difference, so stick with the less caloric version, it is fantastic."
"3","5","I tweaked the recipe instead of 2 cups of milk I added one: an one cup of sweetened condensed milk a little more cinnamon an only 3 eggs...it was BOMB"
"3","5","If you like a creamier texture, I highly recommend letting the bread soak up the mixture for a half hour before putting it in the oven."
"3","5","we serve with english custard poured over the top, try it, absolutly delicious :))))"
"3","5","I have been making this recipe for years and it's still the best bread pudding recipe I have ever found! There is only one thing I tweak you could say... I make sure that all the bread is soggy with the egg and milk mixture. In order to do that, I add more milk until all the bread is soaked. You don't have to add anything else, just more milk. The cooking time is longer when you do this, but you will know it's done when the top springs back as the recipe says. My whole family LOVES it!"
"3","5","I make this whenever I have leftover bread. Delicious! Sometimes we top with caramel sauce and whipped cream. Sometimes we eat it as is. Great, simple recipe!"
"3","5","This is a wonderful basic recipe! I have made this several times as is and with some personal additions. One of my families favorites is to gradually incorporate milk into 1/3 c of dutch-processed cocoa, then add it to the eggs & sugar mixture. Pour over bread. Fold in 1/3-1/2 c of dark chocolate morsels. Sprinkle with coconut and pecan pieces and bake. Voila! (I have added a photo of this creation)"
"3","4","question..if I double the recipe how much longer does it need to bake?"
"3","5","I've never made bread pudding before, and I was getting nervous reading those 'hot milk' recipes because I heating milk seems scary to me (don't ask, I'm frightened of strange things). Finding this recipe was a miracle in my opinion. I followed the recipe exactly except I added some chopped walnuts and more raisins than called for. It was easy to compile and bake and I can tell it's a good recipe to have in your arsenal because clearly it is open to improvisation.  Oh and absolutely delicious to eat!"
"3","5","In an effort to make it a little healthier, I use skim milk and cut the white sugar back to a half cup. I love this for dessert and for breakfast. Good cold but better slightly warmed."
"3","5","Last night was the 1st time I made bread pudding and I used this recipe as my guide. I changed a couple things, used 3 xtra slices of bread (sliced potato bread), only 3 eggs, half and half instead of milk and brown sugar instead of white. It turned out great! We topped it with vanilla ice cream and carmel sauce. My son who is a very picky eater loved it. I would suggest doubling the recipe if you want leftovers! I will definitely be making this for family gatherings!"
"3","5","This is very good, however I made some small changes. I used 8 slices of left over thick whole wheat bread (with the crust removed) which I broke into a large mixing bowl. I used 3 eggs instead of the 4 and I used 1 can of evaporated milk and toped it up with 2% to make the 2 cups. I also used 2/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. After mixing the eggs, sugar, milk, cinnamon and vanilla in one bowl I poured it over the bread and tossed it lightly ensuring that all bread and raisins were coated well with the egg mixture. I also allowed the bread to soak in the large bowl before pouring it into a 9' x 9' baking pan which I had sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Although the instructions say to bake for 45 minutes I found it was done after 30 - 35 minutes. This pudding was great served warm with a topping of Vanilla Yogurt. After cooling I divided the leftover bread pudding into single serving dishes and froze it."
"3","4","If you like breadier bread pudding, use older/staler bread. If you like creamier bread pudding, use newer/softer bread. The stale bread will hold its shape nicely but still get soft and the fresh bread will dissolve into the pudding mix while maintaining the bread flavor and crust on top. I also was confused by how runny it was in the middle when I took it out of the oven, but when I put it in the fridge overnight it firmed up perfectly."
"3","5","Delicious!!!! Made this according to directions (except the cooking time). Before cooking, I did read a few reviews, thats why I added 15 minutes more. So good. Now I can make it anytime. When I do my weekly market run, I always look for the stores bakery 'day old' section. I have used dinner rolls, ciabbata bread, Italian bread, and any other I could find that I thought would be good for this recipe. I cube the bread and freeze it so I have it available on a moments notice. Thanks everyone for sharing your own ideas on this recipe."
"3","5","I didn't change a thing. GREAT recipe!!!! Thank you for sharing!!!"
"3","5","Very yummy this was my first time making bread pudding but my sister was craving it and bugging me to make it for her. I read most of the reviews saying it was to sweet. so I just added like 2 or 3 more slices of bread and it came out just right not to sweet and not to savory we ate it with ice cream on top and it was amazing thank you for this recipe"
"3","5","Great recipe. I used leftover hot dog buns, brown sugar and dried cherries instead of raisins. My husband loved this. Next time I will probably use less sugar and maybe try apple pieces and chopped walnuts. Very easy and inexpensive dessert to make."
"3","5","I made this recently with a vanilla sauce, and my mom was over the moon! Haha. She won't leave me alone now. She just constantly wants bread pudding xD"
"3","5","This is a great recipe! I read the reviews and used double the bread because I had thin sliced sandwich bread and I did not want it to be too eggy. I added pecans and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I also made a sweet butter cream sauce to drizzle over the bread after baking. It was great! Thanks so much for sharing."
"3","4","Good, but too sweet. I would use only 1/2 cup of sugar. Also adding some banana or nuts makes this recipe even more interesting"
"3","4","I used more bread (8 slices instead of 6) and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg with the cinnamon. Also I added a pinch of salt. The liquid part seems to mix up more uniformly if the eggs are beaten with the sugar and spices, then the vanilla and milk added and beaten again. The sugar forms a nice crunchy crust on the top of the pudding and the pudding itself puffs up nicely, higher than the pan. It works much better than an otherwise similar BH&G recipe that called for much less sugar and bread."
"3","4","I love it with much more bread than provided in the recipe."
"3","5","This was exceptional just as it is! Perfect! Company went crazy and it was served warm with a little whipped topping...YUM!! Will be a staple in our home as I always seem to have too much stale bread. Incidently I made it the first time with whole wheat because that was what I had...awesome!!"
"3","5","I made this recipe this morning. It was exceptional! I used 9 slices of pepperidge farm cinnamon swirl bread, 3 eggs, used nutmeg and cinnamon, half and half, and added about 3 tbsp of brown sugar. I also used a vanilla sauce which really made it a little too sweet. It still was really good!"
"3","4","This is really good. The only thing is it's a bit eggy for my taste, so next time I think I will use one less egg. I made a caramel sauce to go with it. I will be making this one again."
"3","5","So simple and so easy. Texture is great. This has substance. I used brown sugar and cream. Topped with a hot bourbon butter sauce. Bread pudding is my husband's favorite. I made this for his birthday and he loved it. This is a keeper."
"3","5","Wonderful! I did leave out the raisins, cut the sugar a bit, and added freshly ground nutmeg. I also topped it with a vanilla bean Creme Anglaise....making it again for the second time in a week!"
"3","5","Great bread pudding recipe!! I doubled it for a super bowl party, and its tastes great. I kept the ingredients and measurements as written and came out yum. Baked for the 45 min as directed. Will make a whiskey sauce to pour over."
"3","4","This was my first attempt at bread pudding. I try to make foods as healthly as possible, so here is what I did, used 7 slices organic wheat bread slices, 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, 1 1/2c skim milk and 1/2c fat free half and half, 1/3c sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, cooked for about 50 min, topped with some whipped cream and came out perfect. My husband, who loves his sweets, said it's a keeper!!"
"3","3","Delicious with modifications. Based on other reviews i omited 1 of the eggs and added 3 more slices of bread. I don't know the technical reason why, but it will definately turn out better if you used dry, stale bread and let it soak in the custard mixture for at least an hour before baking. The other 2 changes i made were to use rum extract and instead of drizzling bread with melted butter, i dotted small pieces of butter on top before baking. I did cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and found that it was a mistake, although if you plan to use a sweet topping, that might be the way to go."
"3","5","Being the first time I've ever made bread pudding- this was by far, the easiest and the healthiest I've found with having all the ingredients in my kitchen. I did, however, alter the recipe a little- I used 1 cup Vanilla Soy milk/1 cup Half & Half- i also followed the other's suggestions of only using 3 eggs instead of 4. Addtions I added: sliced apples and a splash of nutmeg. DELISH!!!"
"3","5","Wow! What an incredible Bread Pudding this was. I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of white bread along with the optional ½ Cup of raisins and then made the “Caramel Sauce” from this site as a topping. The next day heated up, it was just as incredible!!"
"3","5","This recipe is absolutely delicious I have made it 3 times in a week. My family loves it warm with home made caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream."
"3","5","This is getting 5 star do to the fact that it is so easy and yet so good. Doubled the recipe keep one for myself and one for people at work. I used cinnamon and raisin bread instead of white bread turned out great."
"3","5","Delicious! I used Apple Cinnamon bread that I had let go stale. Also, instead of raisins I used apples I had sauteed in a little butter and dark rum."
"3","1","THis wasn't so good don't know why there is so much hype about it, I thought it was ok because I am a carb freak so it tasted like bread soaked in milk and sugar, nothing special, however my husband and children did not like it at all"
"3","4","I make bread pudding every year on Christmas Eve and have tried a few different recipes, with the recipe from The Golden Nugget hotel & casino buffet being our family tradition (we have a typed copy on the hotel's stationary...I think someone in the family requested it years back and they actually gave it out!). This bread pudding recipe is WAY easier (no water bath!), a bit healthier (if that can be believed for a dessert such as bread pudding), requires less eggs, and makes a smaller batch. Its every bit as good as I remember the Golden Nugget recipe to be. I DID SUB the milk for half & half (I think that's just a general rule for bread pudding!). Two things, though: I bake using Le Creuset, which cooks very evenly and does an amazing job. I just recently made the switch from corning ware and generic glass casseroles and WOW! what a difference. I also have a convection oven, so that might come into play as well. Its possible that these two factors baked this recipe amazingly well- looked perfect, crowned nicely and cooled into a dense dessert that was cooked all the way through with zero burning or crusty edges. I will use this recipe from now on! A TIP: after sprinkling raisins and pouring the liquid mixture over the bread pieces, poke the raisins down with a knife so they aren't sitting right on top. They can burn if left on top! I rate this 4 stars, because I truly believe that half and half really makes a bread pudding shine, and originally this recipe called for milk."
"3","5","I''ve been using this recipe for a couple years now. I love bread pudding and this is one of the best. I use challah raisin bread I make using my father inlaws recipe - pretty standard. I cut up enough small squares to fill my round 1.6Lt corningware to a heaping pile.I don't use the butter, not sure why its there? I use fresh ground nutmeg/cinnamon and only about 1/4C to 1/2C sugar. I don't like sweet - but its more then just savory with 1/4-1/2C sugar. The key is not nessecarily having day old bread - whats important in my opinion is once the liquids on the bread I place a slightly smaller pot with a can for weight in it on the bread/liquid and place it in the refridgerator overnight ideally. It compacts the liquid into the bread and makes for awesome texture! For a twist..when I don't add raisins in the bread I grate /chop some chocolate chunks into the mix of cut bread before adding the liquid! Come on now! Any guests I try it on are blown away and even the non believers in bread pudding - continuely ask for more. Cheers"
"3","5","Amazing and so very easy....I used a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Raisin bread and used fat free half and half instead of milk.....delicious warmed with a lil maple syrup on it....thanks!"
"3","5","Made this with leftover banana muffins that were too heavy and unsweet to be enticing (tried too hard to make them healthy for my 1-year-old). I hadn't used any sugar aside from the bananas when I made them, so the sweetness of the pudding made them lovely. I used brown sugar and cut it down to 1/2 cup which was just right, and used 8 egg whites (only because I had them leftover after using all the yolks in another recipe). Added extra butter to make up for the fat lost from the yolks, because, hey, why not enjoy your food? ;) It's a great recipe and I'm sure is just as yummy with regular bread, but the banana bread was a fun change!"
"3","5","Wonderful recipe. It is really sweet, so be forewarned that you may want to scale back the sugar a bit. I prefer it sweet so I left the recipe as is. Usually, I tweak a recipe to my liking, but this one was perfect. My family of 7 completely agreed!  Tip: 6 slices of bread is equal to approximately 5 1/3 oz. of bread."
"3","4","This is a great recipe! I had never had bread pudding but I had some delicious buttery rolls I purchased at Kroger that were about to get hard and unappetizing. I went on the search for a bread pudding recipe and I think this is the one I will stick with! I did make a few adjustments: I only added 3 eggs, 4 seemed to be a bit much. With only 3 the texture is to die for. My mom, who's grandmother used to make her bread pudding nearly every time her bread grew old, told me the texture was spot on. I also added a generous sprinkle of cinnamon sugar to the top before baking. Thanks again for the great recipe!"
"3","5","This is so yummy. Made this a few times now and everybody loves it. We eat it with Vanilla Custard on top. So super yummy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"3","5","My mom LOVES breading pudding but didn't have a recipe so i decided to try this recipe. It's super easy. My constantly uses this recipe. ITS GREAT!"
"3","5","I love bread pudding and this was my first time ever making it. i LOVE that it has more of a custard consistency than some of the bread puddings i have had. It tasted AMAZING, however i did have to cook it for closer to an hour rather than 45 minutes. Still, this will be THE bread pudding recipe i use from now on!"
"3","5","Oh, so good. I love bread pudding and this was a perfect recipe to satisfy my craving. Used cinnamon raisin bread and skipped the raisins. Used a rum sauce recipe I found on the site...delicious!"
"3","5","Good results with common pantry ingredients (no heavy whipping cream required). Used 3 eggs but may try with 4 eggs next time, edges were a little crusty."
"3","5","This was so easy and delicious, but I made several changes based on other reviewers' suggestions. I used 10 slices of a loaf of regular wheat bread with the crusts cut off. I also used only 1/2 cup of sugar and 3 eggs. I left out raisins and used original almond milk instead of regular because that's all we drink, and it came out great. Everyone loved it.   It would probably look a lot more impressive if you used day-old french bread instead."
"3","5","Wow!!! This is by far the best recipe for bread pudding. I was worried if it would turn out right and I just let it cool and cut a piece and wanted to hug the person who posted this. The only changes I made was 3 eggs instead of 4, and 8 pieces of bread instead of 6. It taste like my mother's bread pudding. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!"
"3","5","Amazing recipe!!! I absolutely love it. This is my first bread pudding and I really don't think you can do this wrong. I had leftover biscuits instead of bread and used canned milk because I didn't have enough regular. This will be my go-to recipe for bread pudding!!! Thank you!! :)"
"3","3","This was kind of dry - and really dense. I was slightly disappointed, but may try again with some modifications."
"3","5","Awesome! This bread pudding was so good and easy to make. Great recipe, I also tried it using only 2 eggs because I was short of them and it still turned out quite good!"
"3","5","Delicious & easy!! In my kitchenaid, I whisked eggs, melted butter, milk, 1/2 c of white sugar, 1/4 c of brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla. Then I added to the whisked ingredients, broken pieces of fresh pepperidge farm white sandwich (9 slices) bread, chopped pecans & raisins, then poured into a greased glass baking dish. My pudding did not look as pretty as photo number one, but is 3/4 gone in less than a day. Looks like a sheet cake, because everything was whisked. My husband asked that I keep this recipe. I thought that I'd be able to freeze some for another time, but he's been picking at it all day. Thank you for such a great recipe!"
"3","2","tasted like french toast, the texture was off"
"3","5","I cut the eggs to 3 hoping for the really thick texture I love for bread pudding and it turned out great. Also cut the sugar to 1/4 C so we could add raw honey on top after cooking as we are eating raw local honey to get rid of seasonal allergies which also seems to be working. I hear the honey loses it's antiallergy properties at 160 degrees so we didn't want to bake it. Added 1/4 C walnuts on top before baking too. Loved it cold with half and half over it."
"3","4","I made this recipe for Easter and it was a hit. I used only 3 eggs as others suggested and found that to be sufficient. I did have to bake a little longer than the 45 min. suggested. I will be making this again."
"3","5","My family has made this for years for Easter and Christmas, but the prep (and clean up!) is a little faster: melt butter in microwave in 9X13 microwave-safe baking. Coat all sides of bread with melted butter. Make cinnamon and brown sugar 'sandwiches' with the bread. Mix together eggs, milk, and vanilla and pour over bread. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Prior to baking, let sit out for 20-30 mins. Bake at 350 for 50 mins. For breakfast we omit the raisins. For dinner dessert we add the raisins."
"3","5","I followed exactly as written, and it turned out beautifully! My FIL, who at first refused to even try it because he 'hated bread pudding' kept saying how good it was, and told me I could make it again any time. A definite hit!"
"3","5","Easy and yummy!"
"3","5","So easy and so very good!"
"3","5","This was a great recipe for bread pudding. Being a diabetic, I cut the carbs down by using skim milk and artificial sweetener and it was still quite good. For bread I used homemade buttermilk bread. I did add raisins but they would have cut the cards down a great deal more."
"3","5","make it all the time! love it!"
"3","3","I like to dip my bread in the egg mixture like as if I was going to make french toast then place the soaked up coated bread into the pan. You may need to add more eggs because the bread soaks up the mixture like a sponge and you need to cover up the bread before baking."
"3","4","good recipe"
"3","5","very good. used 3 extra large eggs instead of 4, and used a day old very buttery brioche loaf, so omitted the butter."
"3","5","EASY and AMAZING! My husband craves this now. (Just don't forget the sugar like I did the first time... but that just means it's like baked french toast and a little maple syrup fixes the problem.) This was so much easier than most bread pudding recipes I've found. I don't change a thing. I do only put raisins in one half, though because not everyone likes raisins."
"3","5","I love this recipe. It's very simple and it made a great bread pudding! It was my first time making bread pudding and it turned out delicious. It was quick and easy, which made my life so much easier. I didn't have old bread, so I put the slices on a cookie tray and put them in a 200 degrees oven for about 20 minutes. It definitely hardened them up enough for the pudding. I also used 2 extra slices of bread since the white loaf I bought was sliced into thin slices. I also lowered the amount of sugar to about 1/2 cup because my family isn't into overly sweet desserts. The aroma that came out of the oven when I went to pull the pudding out was lovely and the pudding tasted just as great. I'll definitely make this again!"
"3","5","I made this to surprise my mom yesterday because it is one of her favorite desserts and we all LOVED it! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream on top... everyone wanted seconds and then some!  The only thing I changed was I used Splenda because mom is diabetic and I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on top - next time I will for sure double the recipe!  It tasted better then the restuarant!! Thank you for sharing!"
"3","5","My Father-in-Law really liked this! We will certainly keep the recipe to use in the future. I must add that in addition to being good, it makes the whole house smell great. Also a great presentation- I will upload a photo!"
"3","5","Great recipe, I added Tia Maria liqueur for a butterscotch flavor."
"3","5","Easy Easy! I'm not much of a baker and I can make this and have it turn out beautifully! It's versatile too! Add raisins, nuts, and caramel. Or add Cranberries, blueberries and raspberries. Anything is good in this recipe."
"3","4","Fabulous foundation! I added Amaretto in an attempt to get rid of it, worked out fabulously."
"3","5","I was trying to use up some bread and this recipe was rated well, but I was leery. I've tried many bread pudding recipes in the past and they never really delivered the texture and taste I was looking for. Hallelujah this one did. I made some changes due to the other reviewers (thanks guys) and the ingredients I had on hand. First, I doubled the recipe since I had a lot of bread. Second I used half oatmeal bread (a bakery loaf that was kind of dry) and whole wheat cinnamon bread on the top and bottom (that was very moist.) I used a couple of extra slices of bread and decreased the eggs after doubling by 1. I subbed the sugar out to splenda brown and only used 3/4 c for the entire recipe, in other words not doubling it. Then I used 1.5 c of 1/2% milk, 1 c. half n half, and 1.5 c of creme brulee coffee creamer. I added a few turns of ground nutmeg from my nutmeg mill, and decreased the cinnamon and vanilla to 1 tsp because of the cinnamon bread and the creme brulee flavor. (I never use raisins in anything, who wants a bunch of shriveled up grapes in their food?) Oh, I'm a butter fanatic so I increased the butter by a Tbsp or so. I sprayed pam on foil and covered it while baking. This was excellent plain, but I had some blueberries and raspberries so I barely heated them with a bit of lemon juice and just a couple of tsp of sugar as a sauce and topped it with cool whip. I got rave reviews from all 5 of my family members. Everyone liked it whether it was topped or plain."
"3","5","Great base recipe. Just for fun I've made it in some variations. #1: Fold in 1/2 to 1 cup of chocolate chips and some walnut extract. Omit the raisins and sprinkle chopped walnuts over the top before baking. #2: Fold in 1/2 to 1 cup of white chocolate chips, dried cranberries instead of the raisins and either some orange zest or orange extract. Excellent and economical way to use up stale bread when you don't want any more french toast! I've even used stale plain croissants."
"3","5","This was delicious. I used only 3 eggs which was more than enough & the smell while baking was fantastic. It puffed up so much but did fall down after awhile which didn't affect the taste at all."
"3","5","This was a great starter recipe for bread pudding. I wanted to put my own spin on this dish, so I tried two different batches. One had butternut squaush, golden raisins, pecans, and pumpkin spice-out of this world! The other one had bananas and chocolate chunks-delicious! I used sub rolls and cut down a bit on the sugar,milk, and egg mixture. I also let it soak overnight in the fridge. This was so easy and I think you could try so many different ingredients to create yummy bread pudding. I will definitely be using this recipe again!!!"
"3","5","This bread pudding was so easy to make and so tasty! perfect consistency! I used half and half instead of milk, 3 eggs (they were big) 9 slices of bread and a little extra cinnamon. thanks for the recipe!"
"3","4","I was glad i cut back on the sugar about 25%. I also left a little out to sprinkle on the top along with some cinnamon. It added some great texture once finished baking. I also added chopped pecans & walnuts to the top & then drizzled a whiskey rum sauce over the top. With the sauce, i could have cut the sugar almost in half. here's one recipe i found for sauce... Whiskey Sauce: 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup whole milk 1/2 cup granulated white sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch 3/4 cup bourbon or other whiskey Pinch salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter In a 1-quart saucepan set over medium heat, combine the cream, milk, and sugar. Place the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the bourbon in a small mixing bowl and whisk to blend and make a slurry. Pour the slurry into the cream mixture and bring to a boil. Once the sauce begins to boil, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat, add the salt, and stir in the butter and the remaining 1/2 cup of bourbon. Serve warm."
"3","5","I made this pudding last night and I must say it was right on the ball. I hate deviating from a recipe and giving a good rating but there had to have been a baseline. I made the following changes I used a 9' x 13' casserole baking dish. Since I doubled the recipe I used 2 less eggs, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon mixed spice, I used the bread crust and ends. Great way to get the kids to eat them and also used 2 packets of whole milk powder to make the 4 cups of needed millk."
"3","5","Awesome!!! I have not changed a thing... perfect as is - I have used left over frozen french toast sticks when I had them. Yummy!!"
"3","5","This was my first time making bread pudding. I used ciabatta bread that we had left over from dinner last night (a nice crusty Italian bread). The only changes I made were to add 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon and I left the mixture 'soak' for about 15 minutes before putting in the oven, to make sure the bread was nice and soggy. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","Just finished eating a piece of this bread pudding - yum! It was perfectly delicious. I used some leftover 12 grain crusted bread. I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and used more bread than called for and let the pudding sit and soak for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. I also used 2/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup white. I added some thinly sliced ripe pear to the pudding, which added nice flavour and texture. Overall, a very easy recipe that I imagine I will make again. Considering the success of the pear-addition, I will probably try it with other fruit as well as I enjoy this added twist."
"3","4","This was really good! I made some whole wheat bread that didn't really turn out - kind of dense and flavorless, so instead of throwing it out, I decided to make bread pudding! I omitted the raisins (we don't like them) but otherwise used the recipe as stated. I didn't measure the bread, just cut up cubes to fill the pan. The only thing I did differently was to let it sit for about an hour before cooking to let the bread soak up the liquid. Probably would have been great to make ahead the night before since this bread was so dense. Turned out great and I had 2 helpings!"
"3","4","This is a pretty good base recipe. I found it a bit eggy for my taste. Next time I plan on adding less egg, more vanilla, and perhaps a dash of nutmeg."
"3","5","I followed the recipe exactly, cook time and all. I think the confusion lies with the type of bread. I used a day old loaf I had made for Sunday dinner and I cut 6 thick slices to use for the bread pudding. I would guess that generic store bread is too thin and not dense enough to hold up to this recipe."
"3","5","This bread pudding was a big hit at the bbq! I used criasins instead of raisins and added walnuts. Also reduced the eggs to 3 and used left over whole wheat french bread. This was simple & easy! Even better if served warm with a scoop of ice cream!"
"3","5","Ohh..my..goddness! I can't believe how good this is! I added an extra bit of butter to the bread, as well as 3 extra slices cubed. I just used Save A Lot Lady Kay white bread from my freezer. Also I took the advice of other reviews and reduced the eggs to 3. I left out the raisins also. I topped this with the Cream Anglais II sauce also listed on this website. Very Very good, I will be making this again and often!"
"3","5","I made this with a batch of pumpkin spice muffins that turned out too dry. Oh. My. Goodness! The heavens opened up and choirs of angels sang it was so good! This is a great basic recipe that I know I can easily adapt to what's on hand. Thanks!!"
"3","5","I did the recipe as followed but added a couple of twists.....doubled the bread, (no butter) used raisin bread, cubed, but only used the regular amount of liquid. did a strusel topping using 1 stick of butter 1/2 cup flour/3/4 to 1 cup of brown sugar/ sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg/crumbed together. used 8 x 8 glass pan and baked for 1 hr at 350. It was divine~"
"3","4","I'm currently living in another country that doesn't have the same quality of ingredients as the US. Shelf stable milk vs fresh milk. Better eggs. Denser bread. An egg bread or cinnamon bread is more dense, even regular white bread is probably more dense in the US than here in the D.R. The way I made this, the recipe fed 3 adults and 2 children, with no leftovers, instead of 12 servings. Perhaps better, denser ingredients would up the serving size. Still pretty good considering, I'll definitely make this when I go back to the States."
"3","5","I've been making this recipe for awhile and have found a couple of variations that my family really loves. 1) Replace the vanilla with rum extract and skip the cinnamon. Then you've got Rum 'n Raisin bread pudding. 2) At Christmas I skip the raisins, replace the milk with egg nog and swap out the cinnamon for nutmeg. Egg nog fans absolutely LOVE it."
"3","5","This is the end-all, be-all of bread pudding recipes. Made two of them within two days, something this good doesn't last long. A couple of notes: As mentioned by another reviewer, I used King's Hawaiian rolls (all 12 in the package); used half & half instead of milk; baked in a round casserole dish for about 50 minutes. Perfection! Also, I didn't worry about spritzing the bread with the melted butter - I just beat all ingredients to frothy, threw in the bread and raisins, and let it soak for about 10 minutes. Yummy! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with us Ellenmarie. Also note: the bread was an excellent choice, but next time I'll try sourdough - there is a restaurant here in Vegas that makes sourdough bread pudding...to die for!"
"3","5","'I think it's a 5 star bread pudding'"
"3","5","this was so good. I used left over french bread!"
"3","5","Great with butterscotch chips!"
"3","4","It was good, just not great."
"3","5","FANTASTIC! What made this though for me was the bread I chose...I used just over half of a round loaf of Cinnamon Chip Challah Bread from The Great Harvest Bread Co and it was absolutely phenomenal! Because it was a cinnamon bread I did leave out the cinnamon called for in the recipe. MmMmM I loved this! It would be great at Thanksgiving or Christmas, too :)"
"3","5","I really like this recipe, it is quick and easy and one batch is never enough.."
"3","4","I substituted sugar for Splenda, next time I will reduce the amount. Overall it was very tasty."
"3","5","I eyeballed the amount of bread, filling my pan to the brim. I ran out of raisins, so used dried cranberries instead. We really loved this pudding, not too sweet, not soggy at all, just perfect! Forgot mine in the oven XD but resulted into a delicious crispy topping in contrast to the tender filling. Also used lard instead of butter. Next time I'll try adding ground almonds along with the raisins. Thank you!"
"3","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"3","5","This was my first time making bread pudding. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out excellent. I wasn't sure on what kind of bread to use, so I just used regular white bread. I will make this one again and again."
"3","5","I have been looking for a really good Old Fashion type bread pudding , this one is great, even my picky daughter loved it."
"3","5","Absolutely delicious. Made it with cinnamon swirl bread (Franz brand)used 9 slices instead of six since some people said it was too soft. It came out perfect and incredibly scrumptous. I will definately make this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe."
"3","5","This is a great recipe!!. I made a few changes the second time I made it and the people kept asking me for seconds and raving about it. I did not use sugar. I use 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of condensed milk. I replaced the raisins for 1/2 of pecans and 1/2 of trail mix with chocolate. I topped it with caramel sauce and OH MY WORLD!! this was heavenly. Absolutely divine."
"3","4","Very good and very easy. I used some cubed leftover apple pie bread that was getting stale but kept everything else the same other than I baked in a deeper dish. I served it with vanilla sauce from this site, and it was a hit with the entire family."
"3","5","Came out great, loved it. I really loved the texture of not too dry but not too mushy!"
"3","5","very good.Instead of raisins I added chocolate chipsand used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar.Also after 30 mins of baking I poured vanilla sauce (recipe from this site:mix 1/2 cup sugar,1 tbsp corn flour,then add 1/2 c water, boil for 1 minute.remove from heat then add 2 tbsp butter & 1 tsp vanilla)on top."
"3","5","Amazing and simple! Just like my mom use to make. Tip: I buy the day old bread at the bakery, it's always on sale and then I can use the fancy raisin bread! I also add the brown sugar sauce (found on this site)and what a dessert!"
"3","5","This was the best Bread Pudding I've ever had! I'd eat it every day if I could! Haha!"
"3","4","This is pretty simple and good bread pudding. I love the buttery taste due to drizzling it on the bread before baking. To me that's what really makes this recipe good! The only thing I am not too thrilled about is that it is a custardy bread pudding. I like mine to be a little more firm but that's strictly personal preference. I used raisin bagels which were pretty yummy."
"3","5","VERY TASTY! FIRST TIME EVER TO TRY BREAD PUDDING. EASY RECIPE, MY HUSBAND CAN EVEN MAKE IT ON HIS OWN. ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS TO BUTTER THE DISH FIRST....SCOOPS OUT EASIER AND HELPS WITH CLEANING THE PAN."
"3","5","Great Recipe!! I used Texas Toast instead of smaller slices."
"3","4","this makes a very good pudding that's best the day you make it in my opinion. I made it once with French bread, and then again with a brown sugar cinnamon bread. Both times I used evaporated milk, reduced the sugar and used Splenda brown sugar. Both batches were good, but the French bread made a lighter pudding and it was much better. I also drizzled a butter rum glaze on top...very good."
"3","5","OMG, what an awesome recipe. It's in the oven, as we speak, for one of my Thanksgiving desserts. I've made it twice now and I wouldn't change a thing. This is the best recipe I have found. Just like my mother's. Thank you for submitting a winner in my house. Happy Turkey Day!!!"
"3","5","Easy and great for breakfast reheated the next day. I substitute soy milk for cow's milk and you can't tell the difference."
"3","5","This was outstanding...and so easy! I did read all the reviews, and added nutmeg, and a little brown sugar and cinnamon on top. I was brave and took it to a dinner party without having made it before, and the host said it was the best bread pudding he has ever had! Would be even better with a sauce, but is definitely rich enough without it, especially after a big meal. Will continue to make again and again, varying it just a little for fun...but excellent basic recipe!"
"3","5","I followed Kysha B.'s suggestion to add brown sugar (didn't use any white sugar) & chocolate chips. The family LOVED this!! I was looking for some way to use bread I had slightly overcooked making it too hard to use as buns & came across the suggestion to use leftover bread to make bread pudding. This truly saved the day for me. Thanks for the great recipe, and Kysha B. for their suggestion on additions. :)"
"3","5","So simple and yet delicious! Iused egg bread. Remember to soak bread fully My top layer was a little dry Otherwise beautiful"
"3","5","I am pretty sure that I haven't had bread pudding, but it sounded different and delicious so I tried it. I used about 8 slices of challah because it is a very moist, egg-y bread. I added about 1 tsp of almond extract and dusted the top with nutmeg with superb results. In the future I think I will toy with it a bit adding pears or apples."
"3","5","Very good and easy! I followed a previous poster's advice and only added 3 eggs. It came out perfectly, not too sweet like other recipes I've tried."
"3","5","WOW!! This is so good, and so easy to make!! I put it on some vanilla icecream right when itcame out of the oven, and it's a little bit of heaven. I'm going to make it again next week!!"
"3","5","This is the best bread pudding ever!! My dad loves bread pudding and I made like 5 different recipes and he loved this one. Thank you a lot for this recipe!! :)"
"3","5","So easy and delicious! I used Sarah Lee's low cal bread and used 7 slices. I think 8 would be better as it was a little wet for me (they are small slices). I used light soy milk, and omega-3 eggs, changed the raisins to fresh blackberries. I also used 1/2 splenda, and you couldn't even tell, so I may use all splenda next time. For those counting calories, it came out to 105 per serving at 12 servings. I am quite sure this is equally delicious as written, but part of the reason I rate it so high, is that it is so easily changed to suit different tastes and diet needs."
"3","5","This went over sooo well with the dinner party that I held. The only thing I would do differently is to make sure there aren't too many raisins right on top bc they don't taste good if they get a little too done, though they're wonderful warm!"
"3","5","I thought this came out great. It was just like the one my mom used to make. It's so good slightly warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"3","5","This is just a killer bread pudding. You will love it. Check out the other reviews, all are great ideas."
"3","5","I used cranberries instead of raisins which made it perfect."
"3","5","perfect recipe. I used cinnamon bread and added golden raisins. Served it with a butter whiskey sauce and vanilla ice cream."
"3","4","Wow I just made this today. I love bread pudding and have not found one that really excites me till now. This is soooo good, the aroma of it baking makes you impatient to taste it. I also followed other reviews and used 1/4 Cup brown sugar and 1/2 Cup white sugar and some nutmeg. Was not to sweet at all or soupy, just perfect, but I had a dab of whip cream on top, yum. This is a keeper."
"3","5","I put 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 3/4 cup, and added a few chocolate chips, it was the best I have had in along time. Who needs raisins???"
"3","5","This is the first recipe I have used from all recipes and I love it!!!! I joined so that I could leave this review. This is the 1st time I ever made bread pudding and it is very easy and sooo good!!!! It is my mother's favorite dessert but nobody we know makes it, now I do and she is so delighted. She loved it!!! And that says a lot because she's tried them all!!! Thanks!!!!!****************************************"
"3","5","I made this with splenda. It turned out perfect!"
"3","5","This was the best bread pudding we have ever had. I also used only 3 eggs then doubled the recipe. I used half br. sugar and half white sugar and sprinkled a little cinnamon, br sugar, and nutmeg on the top. For those that said it was a little 'eggy' don't use regular store bought white bread. I don't think it soaks up the egg and milk mixture enough. I personally like to use italian bread (from the bakery section) and let it sit for 10 mins before it goes into the oven."
"3","5","OMG!!! What an AWESOME recipe!!! My whole family of 11 LOVES it!!! I have made this a number of times~ Each time I have to double it but it's worth it~ Yesterday I made it with a can of coconut milk and now it's gone~ I was asked to make some more today! Mahalo for sharing!!!"
"3","4","excellent flavor, altho I prefer a more custardy bread pudding - still looking for the PERFECT recipe for my taste! I used other suggestions, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown, also 3 eggs - I also baked with cover on, to save the raisins from burning - mmm!"
"3","4","Great recipe! Quick and easy. I used egg nog instead of milk as a variation and regular bread...turned out great. My husband enjoyed it with vanilla frozen yogurt."
"3","4","Very easy and very good. I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan. I followed other reviewers advice and used less egg (3/batch). I also used heavy whipping cream and milk, 3/4 to 1 cup turbinado sugar, and sprinkled raisins sauteed in creme anglaise for garnish. Served it with creme anglaise on the side - fantastic!"
"3","5","Easy to make and the family loved it! SO good the next day with coffee. Thanks for the great recipe."
"3","4","Delicious! It was a big hit at my family breakfast party today. This recipe made me look good :-)"
"3","3","Okay. It pretty much tasted like french toast. I will continue to look for another recipe."
"3","5","Delicious! I used a bit more cinnamon and vanilla, 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup milk, some nutmeg and used a little more bread. Very good! This one's a keeper."
"3","5","Sooooo good warm with vanilla custard or scoop of ice cream. My husband actually found this and made this himself and it will definitely be a keeper in our house!!! Hubby says thanks!"
"3","4","This was a very good base recipe.  I made several changes. I soaked the raisins in warmed rum (used microwave to warm rum) for about 20 minutes. I added both raisins and rum to the mixture but DID NOT cut back on the liquid as most of the rum was absorbed by the raisins. I used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites instead of the called for 3 eggs. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg along with the cinn."
"3","5","This recipe is fabulous. I was swayed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, so I made it last night with yeast rolls (we had three dozen to get rid of!), with raisins, and a little extra spray butter and Vanilla butter nut extract. It was gone by the time I woke up! Fabulous."
"3","5","Bread Pudding worth registering just to review. 5 Stars."
"3","5","Awesome! This will be the third year in a row that I make it for our traditional Christmas Brunch. I usually soak the raisins in warmed-up rum, and use half the amount of raisins listed. Have the ingredients prepped the night before and it takes no time to put together."
"3","5","I've never rated or made a review about a recipe until now......this bread pudding is delicious and super easy!! A heavy, whole grain bread works really well and makes it a little more healty too. I made the Carnation caramel sauce (very easy as well) with it and drizzled it over the top. Everyone loved it. Tip: If you don't have any 'day old' bread around the house, look in the day-old bread area when getting groceries(if your grocer has one). Use any bread that you like in there--works great. Will definately make this many more times!"
"3","5","Absolutely wonderful with chocolate chips instead of raisins."
"3","4","One more review can't hurt--right? I made this recipe as is, except I used day-old croissants instead of bread. Very nice! My favorite thing about this recipe was that the custard wasn't too 'eggy'. Nothing worse than a bite of bread pudding with a texture of scrambled eggs. blech! This recipe was lovely, however. Creamy bits, crispy bits--mmmmmm"
"3","5","oh my gosh!! i work in an assisted living residence, and i made this bread pudding for a lunch dessert; they went nuts over this bread pudding. I have made bread pudding before with allspice and cloves and cinnamon and it was way to spicy, i like this recipe. I made rum sauce to pour over the top and i had no leftovers!! thanks"
"3","1","I thought this turned out horrible! I had thought I made the recipe wrong, but I looked at it and confirmed I did everything right. It tasted like scrambled eggs with raisins and mushy bread. WAY too many eggs. I will keep looking for another good bread pudding recipe."
"3","5","This turned out delicious! I 'doctored' it to make it even healthier. I used Whole Wheat bread, Splenda, and egg substitute. I also soaked my raisins in Jim Beam to prevent them from burning and getting hard... worked like a charm and added a great tasting subtle kick to this recipe."
"3","5","ohh yummy! I used 4 large homemade dinner rolls. 3 eggs per other reviews. extra cinn. and nutmeg. The special touch was a homemade caramel sauce that I drizzled over the bread with the butter and on top when it was done. verry good stuff!"
"3","5","This is so yummy!! I took the advice from everyone else and only used 3 eggs and I also added a bit more vanilla. The bread I used was just plain old white bread from the store that I already had, it turned out fabulous!"
"3","5","Really easy recipe! I used 3 eggs like everyone else, and i used half & half instead of milk- very tasty. I made it twice; once with challah and once with french, - challah is definitely the winner! if you are going to use chocolate chips instead of raisins like i did, make sure you don't put too much cinnamon- b/c it tastes off. great recipe!"
"3","4","Great recepie , great taste and very easy to make! the whole pan was gone within 4 hours! of course most of it was me..... Hahah.   Overall I would definetely say this recpie was great it was so straight forward and easy to make but with a resturant taste to amaze you  I would definetely say to give this one a try. its easy , you cant make a mistake and even if you dont like it ( which i doubt will happen) it hardly takes any effort for a fantastic tasy dessert everyone will love!"
"3","5","THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE!! EVERYONE LOVES IT AND I HAVE GIVEN THE RECIPE OUT TO MANY FRIENDS."
"3","4","This is easy bread pudding--no water bath! I used very stale French bread, and let it soak in the custard for about half an hour, pressing it lightly into the liquid every so often. This recipe isn't too sweet, so the finished pudding could use a sauce or ice cream. But the taste and texture are good. I used all the eggs the recipe called for, because I don't like dry bread pudding. I doubled the recipe, but next time I will try baking in a slightly smaller dish--this was a little flatter than I'd like. My grandmother used to top her bread pudding with a meringue. Maybe I'll try that next time. Overall, a good, fast, and easy recipe."
"3","5","Delicious! Easy to make. Next time I will make some custard sauce to top it with. mmm..."
"3","5","Delicious!! This is a wonderfully simply recipe that turns out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly. But I did make the Brown Sugar Sauce from the Berry and Brown Sugar Sauce recipe on this site, poured it on top before serving and it finished it off perfectly! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"3","3","I made this with white bread from the bread machine. It came out too dry. I like my bread pudding to be moist, and this one was not. Maybe it would have been better with different bread. I'll try a different recipe next time."
"3","5","I had never made bread pudding before. In fact, I only had it once. My husband said it was better then his grandmothers.   I soaked my rasins in rum for about an hour before I added them to the bread and they made a wonderful surprise in this dessert. It was quick, easy and tasty!"
"3","5","This is the best bread pudding recipe on this site. My dad's favorite! It couldn't be easier."
"3","5","I love bread pudding (order it in my favorite restaurant quite frequently), but this was my first attempt at making it at home. It came out perfect... I wouldn't change a thing. I had a late night craving and had it done in less than an hour. I was out of vanilla, so I added a quarter cup of brown sugar for some richness. Next time I'll add the vanilla AND the brown sugar. This one is a keeper."
"3","3","This was okay - I think I like mine a little more creamy... But I will make again I am sure. Thanks for sharing!"
"3","3","This tasted great the next day warmed in the microwave with alittle milk drizzled on top."
"3","5","This was very easy to fix and great. My family loved it. Thanks"
"3","5","so good! I'd encourage anyone to give it a try. My daughters made this for a school project and they didn't need me. thanks to the original author for sharing Liz"
"2","5","I added granola walnuts and 3 types of bread that I dried out for 4 days in tray....I added an egg and it turned out incredible not sure if I mentioned I put brown sugar on the top and in it I would make a crumble for the top with butter flour and brown sugar a little cinnamon and maybe a little oats adding last 20 mins or so until brown and bubbly....Tonight I made it with 3 different breads and buttermilk with a little regular milk (so it wouldn't be to thick. I also did brown sugar in place of white and 1/4 cup of white sugar and extra egg and nutmeg along with cinnamon (on top of what is called for) sprinkled on the top last but not least dates and I added granola as well and oat bran...."
"2","5","If I could rate more than 5, I would!! I used old dry raisin bread so it would not be mushy, then topped it off with a mixture of powdered sugar, a touch of whiskey and a touch of Kahlua, whisked this to a smooth texture, made about 1/4 cup, pourded over hot pudding, and OH MY! Thank you for this amazing recipe!"
"2","4","After my son's 8th Grade graduation party, I had a lot of rolls and buns leftover, so I decided to make this. It turned out great and I'm not a very good cook! My husband and my kids enjoyed it. Though next time I will tweak it a bit for our family's taste, it still turned out wonderful!"
"2","4","i used Honey Wheat Kroger brand bread. It turned out great, but The next time I make it I will mix a little bit of sugar & cinnamon together & sprinkle on top. My husband & boys love it!!"
"2","5","I made this for breakfast this morning and my 4 boys ate it all up immediately. I added 3 extra slices of bread and a bit more melted butter & cinnamon. I will definitely be keeping this recipe for the future. Was super easy to make and delicious!"
"2","5","Yum! Per advice of other reviews cut eggs to 3. Had some raisin walnut bread as well as some baguette-so didn't add raisins. This recipe is perfect-I made a 9x9 on Sunday (for myself for Mother's Day-treat yo self) and it'sTuesday, and per my hubbies request, there is another pan in oven!"
"2","5","I made it. I loved it. I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","This is wonderful pudding, it is even better after it has sat a day or two. It firms up and can eat it like cake. YUMMY..... I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, only used 6 eggs, sprinkled some chopped walnuts, and dried cherries, raisens and dried cranberries over the bread and then added the milk and egg mixture. I used sliced loaf bread....Delicious!  Another one is in the oven now."
"2","5","I used chocolate chips and sweetener instead of sugar and sultanas/raisins"
"2","5","This recipe was great. I did adjust slightly by adding a little more bread, a little more cinnamon and some nutmeg, then right before putting in the oven i drizzled some reduced fat sweetened condensed milk over the top. I baked this in a disposable shallow pasta pan and while in the oven it puffed up right above the rim and then once i took it out it deflated to half the height. When I served this warm I drizzled a little more of the milk on top. Will definitely continue to use this recipe."
"2","5","I really like this recipe since it is easy and tasty, though I did make few tweaks. I used:  ~ 9 slices of raisin bread  ~ 3 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted  ~ 3 eggs, beaten  ~ 2 cups milk  ~ 3/4 cup brown sugar  ~ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  ~ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  I also put it in the oven for 35 minutes. It came out golden and with a perfect consistency"
"2","5","I just made this recipe,...almost as written, and I love it. The only change I made was to use up some 'heavy twisted rolls' that I realized I wouldn't be using for anything else except to grind up for bread crumbs. My only slight deviation from the recipe was to let the bread / milk and egg mixture stand for about 10 minutes to soak, before I put it in the oven. Also, even though this mixture fit very well into an 8x8' square dish, it took much longer to cook than the 45 min recommended. My total cooking time was 1 hour, 5 minutes. I watched this closely, and my cooking time came out perfectly. Also, for the 'nay sayers' out there that complained that this tasted like 'French Toast' Well DUH!! If you make your French toast with sugar, cinnamon and vanilla,...what did you think it would taste like. I don't make my 'French toast' that sweet, so for me, this was an absolutely delicious dessert, that I will make even more decadent with a drizzle of homemade caramel sauce. Thank you for the recipe."
"2","5","Delicious and sooooooo moist. I took the advice of others on this page and only used 3 eggs. It came out soooooooo good. My grandmother is 94 and she is known all around for her home cooking. She is also a huge critic of food. Im 39 yrs old and i cook every now and then (im blessed because i dont have to cook because i come from a long line of cooks). Anyway, she always has something negative to say about my food. She says to add something or its too much of something. HOWEVER, this time she said this dish was perfect. I almost fell out of the door. I will definitely keep this recipe in my favs and do it again next week for Easter and for Mother's day and years to come!"
"2","5","This was absolutely terrific! I chose to hold the raisins, cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and add 2 Tbs maple syrup to the sauce. Great served with vanilla ice cream topping!!"
"2","5","Oh my goodness. This is my go to bread pudding recipe from now on!!! The first time (last night) that I made this the only ingredients that I 'tweaked' was using 3 eggs instead of 4. THAT WAS THE PERFECT THING TO DO. As well, I added 3 more pieces of bread, as others suggested. However, i kept thinking about what 'HEALTHY CHEF' said in that review about using less sugar. But, i used the 3/4 cup sugar that the recipe calls for. Everything was great, except it WAS too sweet. I made it again today, and used 1/2 cup sugar as 'HEALTHY CHEF' suggested. i also added a little extra cinnamon (my personal choice). And with these tweaks, it is absolutely PERFECT FOR ME!!! RECAP OF MY TWEAKS: 3 eggs, instead of 4, 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup, and 3 extra slices of bread. The reviews really help to make a recipe perfect for one's own personal liking. I am so glad i found this recipe!!! Thank you so much for sharing. :) Judy1121"
"2","5","AWESOME!!! I made mine with stale pumpkin spiced bread and it was DELISH!!! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. My daughter and boyfriend loved this but my son didn't... I think it was the texture he didn't like... I will for make this again as I always have all the ingredients on hand"
"2","5","I followed the basics of this recipe. Here are the changes I made. Instead of white bread ,I used 12 Hawaiian Rolls, I get a 24 pack of them at Costco for 4.99. I have 12 to serve with dinner and 12 for a great desert. Split the rolls in half, let them dry out. I used 1 extra egg too ,and cooked it in a 9×13 throw away tin. My husband loved it, he enjoyed the sweetness of the Hawaiian Rolls. Mission Accomplished, 1 Happy Hubby"
"2","4","This is a great recipe. The only addition I would make-add nutmeg(about 1/4 tsp."
"2","5","I saved all the 'crust slice' of the bagged breads I bought and throw in the lonely hamburger/hot dog buns from last bbq. It was perfect. Everybody loved it, nobody could tell and I was the happiest because it costed nothing. Oh, and the recipe is super delicious. (I did put 1cup of raisins)"
"2","5","I love this recipe. It's simple and fast and a good way to use up bread that's on it's way out. I make 'as is' and my family loves it. I do leave out the raisins."
"2","5","Excellent!!! I made this recipe with Stollen Bread from Zehnder's Bakery in Frankenmuth."
"2","4","N U M."
"2","5","I adore bread pudding and this was a great recipe! I used stale glazed donuts for the bread and used one cup of cinnamon vanilla coffee creamer and one cup 1% milk. It turned out fabulous!"
"2","5","Was looking for a way to use up a bunch of extra hot dog buns from a BBQ and came across this recipe- turned out great! One trick I used was to pop the torn up buns into the oven for 5 minutes to crisp them up a bit which made for great texture in the end. Also, I threw in dried cranberries instead of raisins which worked nicely."
"2","5","Excellent. I'm in Moldova now and wanted to bring something to a friend's house for dessert. We're both hypoglycemic, so finding something delicious is often a challenge. I made this with Swerve, a great sugar substitute and used day-old french bread, plus, I didn't use as much sugar-subsitute, as I like things less sweet. Couldn't be more pleased. Add some fresh whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon - fantastic. Very easy to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"2","5","This recipe is AMAZING, AMAZING, AND EVEN MORE AMAZING!!!!! I only had to make two simple changes: use one less egg, and leave out the raisins. After baking, I topped it with caramel sauce. We gobbled this up! I was scraping it off the edge of the pan just to get one last bite! It was nice and cinnamony, just the way I like it!"
"2","5","Added blueberries. Delicious!"
"2","5","I made this recipe last weekend for friends and everyone absolutely loved it! I substituted the raisins for glazed pecans and I used a french baguette instead of sliced bread. We ate it with a bit of vanilla ice cream to cut down the sweetness of the glazed pecans. I really loved the way the french baguette gave it a crispier texture on top- it stayed gooey underneath like traditional bread pudding. I'll definitely be making this recipe again soon (and probably doubling it!)"
"2","5","I use Kings Hawaiian Bread Rolls. This adds a certain sweetness that you just can't find anywhere else! My husband does not like bread pudding, but with the Hawaiian Bread he will eat it! Yummm"
"2","5","This is got to be the best, my husband always wanted bread pudding I personally hated bread pudding, so I made this recipe and it is heavenly, I have become a bread pudding lover along with my husband. Easy to make , I do however use heavy whipping cream. Thanks for this wonderful Bread Pudding Recipe. I used blueberries in stead of rasins. Oh so good"
"2","5","Very good recipe! Everyone LOVED it! To those who feel it's too eggy, use 8 large egg yolks and 1/4 cup cold water instead of 4 large whole eggs. The egg whites are what cause the sulfurous eggy taste. You can use the leftover egg whites to make an Angel Food cake, chocolate chip meringues, or an egg white omelet; or just freeze them for a future recipe. Thanks for sharing, ELLENMARIE, this one is a keeper!"
"2","5","I make this according to instruction and my family can't get enough of it, even those of us who generally don't like bread pudding, like me. I've made it plain, with raisins, and with craisins; they've loved it each time. In fact, I don't think we've had one cool completely. I generally make the recipe 1.5 times over and use a Pyrex 9x13 glass pan. Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe!"
"2","5","Make sure you use a hearty bread. I bought day-old rolls and broke them up. Also, I pretty much filled the pan to the top with the rolls before saturating them. My only other adjustment was to take the sugar down to a 1/2 cup. That seemed plenty; I didn't want this to be overly sweet.  Awesome recipe!"
"2","5","Perfect JUST THE WAY IT IS! This was easy and really, really good!"
"2","5","GRRREAT recipe, and so, so easy! I love bread pudding, but rarely do I get a batch that isn't too dry...this one's methodology pretty much guarantees a nice, pudding-like result. Don't reduce the milk at all unless you like drier pudding--this doubled really easily and is easy to customize, too. Like other users have suggested, it tastes great with a specialty bread--I used a combo of King's Hawaiian soft dinner rolls and some leftover Pillsbury snowflake rolls. To go along with the sweet/Hawaiian flavors, I also added about a half cup of canned pineapple tidbits as well as the raisins. I didn't have whipping cream or a heavier cream like some users suggested, but I made the milk be half whole milk and then half evaporated milk to make it a bit creamier and sweeter. I made it in a covered casserole dish and it turned out amazing--couldn't stop eating it--definitely the best recipe I've ever tried!"
"2","4","Excellent base for bread pudding. With these changes it was outstanding:   Cube 8 slices of bread-- I used light whole wheat.  In one bowl, beat together: 4 eggs, 2 cups milk, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinammon, 1/4 cup half and half, 1 tablespoon of rum, and 1 teaspoon of orange extract (if you don't have orange extract, almond extract is a great alternative.)  Set aside.  Butter a glass pan and toss the bread cubes in evenly. Then drizzle 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the bread.   Take the milk mixture and pour evenly over the bread. Let it soak up the mixture for a minute or two, and press down lightly if pieces are still dry.  On top, I thinly sliced two bananas-- they caramelized in the heat and added INCREDIBLE flavor and sweetness (and healthy fiber!) ENJOY!"
"2","5","It was very easy to make, first time doing a bread pudding. Absolutely delicious, melted in your mouth. I soaked my raisins in a little rum before for about 20 miins, added a nice dimension. Thanks so much for sharing :) Blessings from Sunny Jamaica - ERM"
"2","5","Yummy! Quick and easy. A nice option for old bread. I followed the recipe as written and it was very tasty. Then I made it a few more times and adapted (like adding nuts, using nutmeg or brown sugar, etc.) Those adaptations worked well too. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","3","Read several reviews that this was 'too eggy', we found it wasn't eggy at all - it was completely dry!! I even added extra milk (bread was a few days old). I have fond memories of used making bread pudding as a child with my great aunt. Unfortunately this one didn't live up!"
"2","5","Amazing! This was my first time making bread pudding and the results were scrumptious! I made a few adjustments to this recipe for my own taste preferences, and added 10 minutes to the baking time. Thank you for a simple and wonderful recipe."
"2","5","Love it!!! I always double it and cook it about 20 min more. Cover it with foil 30 min in just to make sure it does not burn, have not tested it without doing this. I have been using one french bread loaf (on the larger side) .89 cents in the day old section at the grocery store. I sprinkle it with quite a bit of cinnamon before adding the liquid to keep it on top of the bread. I use less sugar (half brown) but top it with whipped cream cheese mixed with a little bit of powdered sugar. Just skipping it around, not too heavy. My daughter loves it and it is a good way to get some egg and milk in her while still feeling like she is having a sweet treat. Have also topped it with many kinds of fruit. Anything goes. Nuts. Yes. I just timed my prep time and it was actually about 13 min. Not rushing. Not 30 min like the recipe says. Kids also like to break the bread into little pieces."
"2","5","Made this from crusts and bread butts! Still delicious! My family loved it! Will make again. Super easy and delicious."
"2","5","Yes I tried this recipe an it turned out wonderful..I didn't add raisins as I do not care for them but the bread turned out awesome..thank you so much for sharing it with us all...Dottie"
"2","5","Perfect bread pudding!"
"2","5","This bread pudding is great and really easy to make. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert, and I have tried so many different kinds over the years, but the old fashioned way is still my favorite. The first time I made this I stuck to the recipe exactly, and I have made it several times since without making any changes. It's just that good!"
"2","5","Luv it! But suggests cinnamon sprinkle on top"
"2","5","This is a great recipe. I replaced the sugar with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, used frozen cranberries instead of raisins, halved the cinnamon, and added some clove and orange zest. It was amazing. I will use this as my baseline recipe for bread pudding. I recommend using brioche, ripping it up and letting it go really, really stale; almost like croutons. It solves the eggy issues."
"2","5","My family and I love this recipe. It was so easy to make! I modified the recipe by cutting the sugar in half. Since the reviews were so good, I decided to make a huge batch (see pic) and used 2 loaves (had to quadruple the recipe. Great recipe!"
"2","5","Update: I've been playing with this recipe for several months now and have settled on the following modifications. I use four eggs, replace 3/4 cup of the milk (we drink skim) with half and half. I do not add the cinnamon to the actual custard part, but on top of the casserole, I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to 3/4 cup of brown sugar and sprinkle that on top. It forms a nice crust as it bakes. On top of the brown sugar mixture, I add a handful of chocolate chips and then sprinkle the whole casserole with salt (the salt really makes the flavor of the chocolate pop). To further gild the lily, i dot the whole thing with 9 very thin slices of butter and bake according to the recipe's specifications."
"2","4","Very simple and extremely good; completely redeemed myself for the 'sweet crouton tragedy of 2012' that I thought I'd never live down."
"2","5","change recipe instead of raisins I added dried cranberries and chopped almonds and instead of vanilla extract I added almond.Reduced sugar to 1/3 of a cup.really good!"
"2","5","I used 9 slices of bread, 1/2 cup sugar,3 eggs, low fat evaporated milk and a bit of grated nutmeg (my small changes) and it came out fabulous. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it....he was not sharing. When I eventually tasted it, I could not believe how great it tasted. I am very pleased with this recipe. It is so easy to make."
"2","5","Excellent recipe!!!"
"2","5","I was in the mood for pumpkin bread pudding. I used nine slices of bread, added a can of pumpkin puree and used 1 cup milk/1 cup half and half. i used pumpkin spice and cinnamon for the seasonings. It was absolutely spectacular. Thanks for a great base recipe."
"2","5","tastes delicious. added raisins, walnuts, and apple. only used 3eggs. the best part of recipe is that I had everything in my pantry. A quick easy to make or last minute dessert"
"2","5","My first try at bread pudding and it came out GREAT! This went VERY fast at Thanksgiving. The only chance I had to try it was the little cube I sampled after taking it out of the oven. lol! My family loved it. I will admit that I usually read through the reviews to see what others have tried, so I technically did not make this one as written. I used French bread that I let sit out for maybe 6 days. It got good and crusty. I used milk, but I think I did also use cream. Next time, I will use cream and not milk. Everything else I did from the original recipe. I like fruit desserts, so for the glaze, I reduced some frozen berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries), Triple sec, and strawberry jam. It complimented the bread pudding quite nicely and gave it a nice fall color. Next time, I will leave out the jam. I loved this and plan to make it again soon."
"2","5","I have made it twice. I am getting better with practice. I took an idea from another review and cut up apples sauteed them in butter and brown sugar and also added 1/2 cup pecans. Also the last 10 min, I brushed melted butter and brown sugar on top to give it a nice golden look. It was delicious."
"2","5","This recipe was a HUGE hit at a family dinner. I served it with homemade Irish Cream Ice Cream! The only change I made was that I used croissants instead of white bread. The whole dish turned out beautifully!"
"2","5","This was so easy to make and it came out great. Thanx for sharing :)"
"2","5","Delicious even without vanilla (I forgot!) Used stale Italian bread from Costco's bakery. Upped the butter to 1/2 stick (melted in the milk in microwave). Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup -- already plenty sweet to me. Added a chopped gala apple that had been sitting in my fridge for ages. Done in only 1/2 hour on the convection bake setting in my oven. Will make this again and again."
"2","4","Someone suggested subbing raisin bread for regular old bread and it was really good. I did feel like something was missing without the liquor that needed replacing."
"2","5","Amazing pudding!!! I tried my hand at baking bread which was a total disaster. I used the hard tough bread for making this pudding n it was simply awesome!!"
"2","5","Perfect!"
"2","4","I MADE IT & IT WAS DELICIOUS TO ME"
"2","5","Just the way mom used to make it, My boys could not get enough of this pudding!"
"2","5","this was GREAT ! i used white bread and instead of raisins i used a half a bag of dole mixed berries (strawberries,rasberries,blueberries)and substituded splenda for most of the sugar. It is so good i could eat the whole dish now. also doubled it in 2 seprate baking dishes to bring one into my neighbor!I have tried a few recipies before for this and this one was the easiest!"
"2","5","I have never been able to successfully make bread pudding until I tried this recipe. It is very quick and easy to whip up using whatever leftover bakery bread. I sometimes add less sugar and a drizzle of cream on top before I bake but always add the raisins. Thank you for the recipe. I will be passing this one down!"
"2","5","This recipe is great on it's own, but is also an excellent base recipe which you can use to create all kinds of fun variations. I can't wait to make it again!"
"2","5","Just made this using very stale raisin bread. Used 2% milk & 4 tablespoons butter. Used more bread and let it soak up the milk for about an hour. I used brown sugar and it was very good. Would like to try it with maple syrup. Very quick, easy & yummy."
"2","5","This was the first bread pudding I'd ever made, and it was so easy and delicious. I used 3 eggs, as suggested by others, and added about a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also sliced some peaches and put them on top with a bit of brown sugar. Delicious!"
"2","5","Cut the sugar in half, but I was using sweetened cinnamon-crunch bagels. A half-tsp of nutmeg was a good addition. Very yummy!"
"2","5","Love this easy recipe. I also added in a bit of ginger and nutmeg, along with some fresh peaches I had on hand. Served warm with vanilla ice cream and it was a hit with the hubs and kids! Will definitely make again."
"2","5","This tastes like French toast but better. It is so plump and moist, I make it for Christmas Day breakfast."
"2","5","I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and I also added 1 tsp nutmeg, because I like it better than just the straight taste of Cinnamon in most baked breads. Was Excellent."
"2","5","I left out the raisins and added a teaspoon of nutmeg. It was delicious. This is a great way to get rid of old bread before it goes bad."
"2","4","I used 3 left-over cinnamon raisin bagels... awesome! Just made note to use slightly less sugar next time and add a little salt."
"2","5","Great Bread pudding. I also added a few items to make it a little different. I added 1/4 c of dried cranberries and 1/2 c of coconut.It was a hit. Next time I will add a few walnuts as well. I used French bread instead of the reg day old bread. Perfect way of getting rid of bread but still having a wonderful dessert. My husband is a big fan of bread pudding.Took it to a card party everyone loved it."
"2","5","i love this recipe. I fell in love with bread pudding while I was living in Texas and when I moved out to Mississippi I couldn't find a place that made good bread pudding. I found this recipe and absolutely love it. I do use a little more bread than the recipe calls for (I generally use 7 or 8). I like my bread puddings a little on the thicker side. This is an easy recipe and it is definitely a keeper."
"2","5","This recipe is delicious as always! made it with chocolate chips! you can also replace it with cut almonds or raisins ! mmmm! always lovin it ! the recipe dont need a sauce ! it's already too nice!"
"2","5","Easy to make and got rave reviews from everyone at our St. Patrick's Day party. It has been requested for Easter too!"
"2","5","Although I have not tasted this yet, it looks and smells awesome as it bakes. I used a light thick bread called challah bread and added more cinnamon than the recipe calls for and some chinese five spice. I also let my bread sit in the egg mixture for about 10-15 mins and baked it first with aluminum foil on the top for 25 mins then without the foil for 25 extra mins to get it crispy ion the top."
"2","5","Yummy- used stale bread and cut off crusts. Also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. Used 1 cup 1% milk and the 1 cup half and half."
"2","5","ABSOLUTELY Delicious!!! I used thick bread and doubled the recipe. I also replaced the raisins with chocolate chips. Got rave reviews with my MOPS group. Thanks : )"
"2","5","I made this with day-old banana bread, left out the raisins, and added tons of grated fresh coconut and little pineapple pieces. It was unreal!   Thank you for the recipe- I had never made bread pudding before and this was a snap."
"2","5","Awsome! I made this with multigrain bread and brown sugar. I buy and expensive all natural multigrain bread and it only lasts for a couple of days. This was a great way to use the leftover bread. We can't wait to make it again next week!"
"2","5","Very easy to make. I did substitute an 'egg--beater' product for the eggs and Splenda for the sugar. It was delicious and the consistency was perfect. Topped with a low fat whip cream. Made it for the 12 servings, 5 of us ate the whole dessert. Everyone asked for the recipe."
"2","5","The only thing I changed was using 1/2 cup brown sugar with 1/4 cup white sugar.....great bread pudding!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe. This is exactly how I like bread pudding to taste. Have made it many times."
"2","4","I had many cubes of leftover breads in the freezer.....from loaves made in my bread machine. Whenever I make a fresh loaf.....I cube what is left from the last and store it for croutons. My friend suggested I make break pudding from them, so, voila! Found this recipe and used it.It was simple and tastes yummy. I used nonfat milk and followed the recipe pretty exactly and it was yummy and not too sweet, just right. I ate way too much of it but there was plenty to go around still!"
"2","5","AWESOME recipe...folowed it exactly as written except used small dinner buns & everyone loved it!!! Not to sweet either...definitely a keeper!!!"
"2","4","This is a great basic recipe. Variations to consider: apple cinnamon, coconut, peach, and even cranberry. If I want it as a dessert I made a heavy cream sauce to go with it from another pudding recipe."
"2","5","OMG I would not be able to say thanks enough for a srumchuse bread pudding. My oh my can't wait to make it for my son-in law when I head for arizona. there is not enough stars to for this super recipe"
"2","5","I made this as written except I used dried cranberries in place of raisins. It was delicious and I will definately be making this again the next time I have an excess of bread on hand(I like to freeze the ends of the bread until I have enough for bread pudding- works great!). Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","I tried this recipe for the first time last month and it was a great success. My Father-in-law stated, 'Don't throw this recipe away!' I, too, double the recipe. This is the best bread pudding recipe I have ever taken."
"2","5","AMAZING! I always assumed I didn't like bread pudding but this was simply the best ever! I used cinnamon bread as another person suggested. YUMMY. Followed the rest to a T! Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious and so easy. I only used 1/4 c. sugar and that was just right for me. I can't imagine using more."
"2","5","The best seems like the original recipe of bread pudding. Some said put a shot of brandy in it but I dont need it. Its perfect as it is!"
"2","5","YUMMY - double recipe and it turned out great. No changes needed. I did not include raisins and still was great. Great recipe for first timer - just make sure you mix eggs throughly before adding to milk and then mix milk/eggs/spices thoroughly. I used a wisk."
"2","5","I had some honey whole wheat bread getting old and used it in this recipe. Turned out so yummy! Only change I made was instead of raisins which I didn't have, I added some leftover chopped pecans. They was a nice addition!"
"2","4","Good basic recipe, I had to play around with it a couple times. The first time I made it it was almost like scrambled eggs through out the pudding, and it stuck to the bottom of the dish. So the next time I made it I used only 3 eggs and a couple extra pieces of bread, also spreading a thin layer of butter on the bottom as well as drizzling over the bread helped it from sticking so much. It was much better and less 'eggy'. I also like to add more (1/2-1 cup) milk or cream to the mixture before baking, I find it does dry out a bit while in the oven and I like mine creamy. I added thin slices of apple on top and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking. Perfect for breakfast or dessert!"
"2","5","I used 9 slices of cinnamon swirl bread cut into one inch pieces and a half cup of sugar. Those were the only alterations I made and this was wonderful. A little 'eggy' but still really good."
"2","5","oh this was soo yummy. Wasn't are if my boyfriend would like it and at first don't think he did but then after a couple bites he said I could make it again if I'd like. Lol. I made it without the raisins and drizzled caramel on top of it."
"2","5","awesome"
"2","5","wonderful just like my mom use to make with left over bread crusts."
"2","5","I made this with left over home-made bread that had gone hard. All I'd mention is that since you layer the bread, it's useful to add the raisins at that stage so you get them throughout the layers if you like. This was fantastic. I will use this recipe for bread and butter pudding in the future. No changes necessary."
"2","5","Real good just the right amout of sugar. Next time I'll add more butter. I used whole wheat bread homemade but next time I might try another kind."
"2","5","Very solid recipe. Really customizable. I've tried it a few a times without any changes. Super tasty and easy to make. I like using Hawaiian sweet bread as my main bread. A few time I've carmelized some bananas with brown sugar and added it as well."
"2","3","better the next day. Needed something extra. Tasted way better with ice cream."
"2","5","This is a great base recipe, and I have made it as written or with a few alterations. I have tried splitting the sugar between white sugar and brown sugar, and splitting milk and cream.   After I bake it, I pour a warm praline sauce over the top and let is soak in before I cut it."
"2","5","I absolutely love bread pudding and am very picky about it. This recipe was wonderful. I used stale, sliced wheat bread (8 pieces), with 1 cup H&H + 1 cup whipping cream. I topped it with a brandy sauce I found on another site. Everyone loved it but I don't think it would serve 12 people. It didn't in my house."
"2","3","Tasted too much like soggy french toast :( Won't be making this again"
"2","3","While my family enjoyed it very much, I made a few changes to the original recipe. I used Peppridge Farm Brown Sugar swirl bread and no raisins. I also made a vanilla sauce to pour over it while it was still warm. I would've preferred a more 'pudding ' texture, but the bread absorbed it all while baking. It was a great recipe to build off of!"
"2","5","this recipe is awesome! I topped it with a whiskey sauce...absolutely awesome!"
"2","5","First timer to this recipe and it was a HIT! I doubled the amount with a few twist of my own based on other reviews. I used 12 slices of bread and left it out over night; 4 tablespoons butter to drizzle over it; 8 eggs; 2 cups half/half and 2 cups milk; 1 cup sugar; handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips; 2 tsp of cinnamon; 2 tsp of vanilla; 1 tsp of nutmeg. I used a bigger pan and it took nearly 55 mins to bake. It came out perfect, fluffy, and just enough sweetness. Made some fresh whipped cream and everyone wanted seconds!"
"2","5","If I make bread pudding again, I'll use this recipe. However, I think I'll use a cinnamon swirl bread or something similar. I used leftover wheat biscuits and a few whole wheat bagels. For me, it wasn't sweet enough-- but perhaps that's just the nature of bread pudding and the fact that I used wheat bread. I used a vanilla sauce from the 'Best Bread Pudding with Vanilla Sauce' recipe on this site and it turned out well. I think the proportions of this recipe are spot on. For people who think it's too 'eggy' with 4 eggs, you're not using enough bread. The recipe calls for 6 slices, but I think those were 6 big slices. You want the bread to almost come to the top of the pan. I would have liked for the raisins to be distributed throughout rather than sprinkled on top, so I would consider mixing them up with the bread-- although that might run the risk of them sinking to the bottom. I added some nutmeg, ground ginger, and imitation rum extract (or you could use real rum) to the egg mixture, and I doubled the amount of butter that I poured over the bread. I used brown sugar instead of white and skim milk instead of whole."
"2","5","This recipe turned out great. I had to make a few changes. I used leftover dinner rolls from Thanksgiving and added some pecans and some cooked filling from an extra pumpkin pie. I love a recipe like this that I can change."
"2","4","So good! will DEFINITELY make again! THEE best bread pudding I have ever made- wasn't dry like the ones I've had in the past! so good!"
"2","5","Exellent Recipe... I ended up using Challah (Jewish) Bread and it was amazing. It created a nice semi crunchy top with the sweet underside. It's even better the next day after being in the fridge with some coffee. (also I left the bread soak up the mixture for a bit before baking and the raisins plumped up too)"
"2","4","As recommended by other reviewers, I used 3 eggs and the texture and consistency was perfect. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, but still found it a little sweet for my taste. I omitted the cinnamon, but threw in a pinch of allspice which gave it just enough flavor. All in all, this was a good recipe and easy to make. I will definitely be making it again."
"2","5","very good 'basic'. You could change this up so many ways. Thanks Ellen!"
"2","4","Pretty darn good. The custard was light and fluffy and the cooking time was right on. I did reduce the sugar to about 2/3 cup because I don't like mine too sweet, but overall pretty tasty."
"2","4","Very yummy & relatively fast too compared to other recipes. The only addition I made was to spread a little cream cheese on some of the chunks of bread before I put them in the pan. Next time I might try Phil. cheesecake cream cheese spread. It's only calories, right? :)"
"2","5","This recipe produced bread pudding as good as I have ever had. It reminds me of Mom's. I travel all over trying the local bread pudding when I can. The best I found was on the Gulf Coast. It was not any better than this."
"2","5","this is wonderful to serve to surprise dinner guests. I added candied pecans and served it with vanilla bean ice cream while it was piping hot! Wonderful on a cool evening."
"2","5","I really like this recipe as written. It is easy and I always have ingredients on hand. I love this for breakfast too! Thanks for sharing..it is delicious!"
"2","5","I made this delicious recipe with with gluten-free bread, lactose-free milk for my allergic family members. I also used dried peaches that I had on hand from the last peach tree harvest. It was super yummy and easy to make!"
"2","5","Made exactly to the recipe with one exception. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. Turned out perfect. Will make again. So easy but special enough for guests."
"2","5","This recipe was perfect!!!! Sooo tasty...i didnt have to tweek anything!!!! But i used hamburger buns instead, only because thats what i had in my kitchen."
"2","5","This recipe was so easy and came out as good as my mom's complicated hot water bath, doing crazy things with eggs recipe. I toasted my bread beforehand, added a pinch of nutmeg, and everyone raved."
"2","5","Exactly like what my grandma made! My great-uncle who lives with us and is 100 years old loves it. This is the only recipe I use for bread pudding. Thanks so much. He likes a little cream, milk, or whipped cream on it and leftovers need to be reheated slightly in the micro."
"2","4","This recipe is great; however, there is one thing. If you use the cheap white bread, you will need a few more slices. The more expensive and higher quality bread is thicker and bigger, so you'll need a few more slices to compensate. I put between 8 and 9 slices and it seemed to be perfect. There was a tad of egg mixture not absorbed, but when the bread gets warm and wet it expands so it should be fine. I put a bit of liquid flavored coffee creamer and I put just under a cup of sugar. I used 1/3 brown and just under 2/3 of white and a little extra vanilla extract. The smell was amazing, the flavored liquid really helped because the bread just drinks it up. I didn't have any whip cream, but I sprinkled some powdered sugar and cinnamon mixture over it."
"2","5","I gave this 5 stars because I don't even like bread pudding but loved this! I grabbed some old half priced croissants from my local food stores discount bakery section and used 6 large croissants in place of the regular bread. I omitted the butter because the croissants were full of them. I also added 1/3 cup of toasted pecans. I cut up the croissants into 1in cubes and let them sit on the counter for a while to become a little more stale. Another tip I picked up from a reviewer is to let the bread cubes sit in the egg mixture for about 15 minutes to soak it all up. It was great. My husband has been begging me for bread pudding for years now and he said this is the best he has ever had in his life. Definately yum-yums!"
"2","5","This is a wonderful, quick to prepare, bread pudding. I did use only 3 eggs, the night before baking this, I soaked 1/2 cup dried cranberries in a 1/2 cup rum. After pouring the melted butter over all the bread (I used fresh sourdough) I spread the cranberries over the top then poured the milk-egg mixture evenly over all. Also I used rum extract instead of vanilla. Everybody at the 'coffee group' requested the recipe!"
"2","5","This bread pudding is delicious and so easy to make. We love it when it comes out of the oven, but it is still good warmed up the next day (if it stays around that long). I used day-old hot dog and hamburger buns instead of the day-old bread and the bread pudding was still delicious."
"2","5","Awesome!! As good as my late mom used to make. And so easy! I didn't use the cinammon because I dislike the taste. I used ground cloves instead and it was Awesome. Will definetly make again."
"2","3","As written the recipe is good but 4 eggs are too much. I think 3 are plenty enough. After 45 mins of baking, the top was dark brown and bottom was soupy. Fot the second batch I added 2 extra slices of bread, 1/2 cup raisins soaked in 1/2 cup coconut rum which I heated together in microwave to plump up, and about 1/2 cup chocolate chips. We preferred the second."
"2","5","I love this recipe! I like to substitute 2 oz. of the milk with good-quality bourbon (Bulleit or Woodford Reserve). Bonus points if you soak the raisins in a bit of bourbon, too. Would also work with Cointreau or Grand Marnier."
"2","5","I didn't have any raisins so I used craisins instead. I also used a bit of almond oil instead of the vanilla. Tasted really good!"
"2","4","I used light vanilla soymilk and ommitted the vanilla extract. I found the crust to be too hard. Also the pudding was WAY too sweet, I'll cut back next time. I will also try to use more bread and one less egg this was very eggy."
"2","5","It is awesome!!!! Very gooood recipe!! A must try!"
"2","5","I love this recipe! It is so easy and pretty quick to make on a busy weekend morning. I make a few modifications to the recipe however with whole grain wheat bread, smart balance buttery spread instead of butter, and using skim milk (or 2% milk with 1/4 a cup swapped for water when I don't have skim). This stuff is super good! And with the exception of the 3/4 cup of sugar, pretty nutritious too :)"
"2","5","Terrific recipe. Had a baby shower and I made crust free sandwiches.So I made this with just crusts and it was lovely. I can't wait to make this with some actual bread. The variations for this bread could be endless."
"2","5","I have made this delightful dessert on 2 separate ocassions for 40+ residents at a senior living center. It is so good that I have placed it on our regular menu rotation. Thanks for sharing."
"2","1","Needs more bread, cinnamon, and vanilla."
"2","5","This recipe is so easy and so good. I used the vanilla sauce on it for a Christmas morning breakfast or easy dessert."
"2","5","Great dessert! I used flax seed bread and an extra tablespoon of butter and it was perfect. Next time I will use a little less sugar and bake it in smaller container. It's so good it'll never stretch to more than 9 servings. Whipped cream makes it that much better."
"2","5","OMG this tastes just like Old Country Buffet's without the sauce. If I could figure out the sauce it would be perfect. This turned out so great. To help with the problem with the raisins I put them in pan first and then put the bread on top. I used 3 slices of white and 3 slices of wheat. This was awesome and I almost ate the whole pan..."
"2","4","I made this exactly as in recipe and it was Very good. I will be making this again."
"2","4","Very yummy bread pudding.. I think a little less bread or a little more of the milk mixture would have been a better balance, but I will definately make it again. I paired it with a rum sauce that was just amazing!"
"2","5","this will be made many many times by me in the years to come. So easy and yummy, and I can do variations with what I mix in. Love it!"
"2","5","This recipe is awesome! Every time I make it, my kids get VERY excited! I have made it several times with different kinds of bread, but the best I have found is either a french bread type or an Italian Pugilese(sp?). I have tried it with Shepard's bread and it just wasn't as good as the other types. I think that the recipe is perfect the way it is, however I have started to add some brown sugar and chocolate chips on the top just before baking.....it's really delicious!! Thank you so much Ellenmarie for posting this recipe!"
"2","5","I substituted the bread with one croissant, one bear claw with almond paste, one honey glazed cinnamon roll and two slices of Trader Joe's cinnamon swirl bread. I cut the sugar to 1/2 c, the cinnamon to 1/2 t and the raisins to a sprinkling. It was DELICIOUS! I think I might opt for another almond paste filled item - those surprise bites were nice."
"2","4","This was my first time doing bread pudding. And this recipe was excellent. My family love it. My boyfriend only said he preferred to have caramel sauce over it. But that is just a preference of his own."
"2","5","wonderful,wonderful recepie :)"
"2","1","I chose to give it only one star because when I baked this recipe. It never really cooked. So, I kept giving it a 'few more' minutes. I followed the recipe as is. When I took it out of the oven and let it cool, it deflated! It was embarrassing when I showed it to my family."
"2","5","So delicious and so easy to make!!!! My kids loved it!"
"2","5","Amazing Bread Pudding recipe. I omit the raisins because I hate them. The pudding comes out perfect every time. Had company tonight and they just raved. But don't worry, I told them I'm just a pro at following a good recipe ;)"
"2","5","This is the first bread pudding recipe I have tried, my family loved it! I did use the vanilla sauce recipe on this site instead of the topping that was suggested. I would make it again in a heart beat!"
"2","3","I made it with sweet bread and used brown sugar.. it was still boring and d Bland.. very disappointing.. it has the potential.. just missing something and i cant figure out what it needs.."
"2","4","I doubled the recipe and decreased the sugar to 1 cup. It is very sweet. Added more cinnamon and nutmeg. Very good bread pudding. It is very custard-y."
"2","5","great bread pudding.... a little on the eggy side but thats what makes it taste good.... a little custard like... very good... i made with what ever old bread I had laying around (which happened to be multigrain) and still it tasted very good"
"2","5","This pudding was VERY moist. Great flavor. I used 4 leftover hot dog rolls."
"2","5","I would give this 10 stars if I could"
"2","4","I've made this twice now. First time with 1% milk and wheat bread, turned out rather dry. Second time with whole milk and french bread, obviously much better the second time around. A good basic bread pudding recipe"
"2","4","Very good. No rasins added. Used canned milk."
"2","5","This is going to be a regular in our house. I used whole wheat bread and cut back the sugar to 2/3. I threw some frozen berries instead of raisins in one tray and made the other one as directed. Both were great. Will try to reduce the sugar more just because I have little kids."
"2","5","A GREAT basic bread pudding! I used leftover sweet pumpernickel rolls and golden raisins, and WOW! So good."
"2","4","Good recipe, simple and tasty, a bit too eggy for my liking, but a little more vanilla solves that. Yum!"
"2","5","OMG, I THOUGHT that I had eaten bread pudding before, but this one blows them all out of the park! I had bought an artisan baguette from my favorite bakery and it didn't get eaten over the holidays, so I decided to make a bread pudding so as not to waste it. I looked online and found this recipe. I didn't have any raisins left and added currents instead. I also added an additional egg and a splash more liquid as the baguette seemed like more bread than the recipe called for. I also substituted 1/2 cup of half and half for 1/2 cup of the milk (like it didn't have enough calories before!). The baguette was so stale.....read 'dry and hard'..... that I let it sit for nearly an hour to soften and soak up some liquid before baking. BTW, it also smells divine while baking and is really impressive when removed from the oven, as it puffs up and has a great presentation. This recipe is now added to my notebook to be used many, many times again in the future!"
"2","5","Yummy in my Tummy! My hubs is not much of a sweet eater and he had 3 servings! I'll definitely make it again! I made a few modifications per suggestions: -About 9 slices of Pepperidge Farm Raisin bread, crust removed, cut into small pieces instead of day-old bread -16 oz heavy whipping cream instead of milk -1/2 cup Splenda baking instead of sugar -Baked for 50 minutes"
"2","5","This is so good! I've made it many times exactly as the recipe is written and it's perfect. This time I had lots of leftover eggnog from Christmas so I used that in place of milk. I cut the sugar in half and omitted the vanilla (I actually forgot it - oops!). It was delicous made with the eggnog! I've also found that my grocery store sells their own brand of cinnamon swirl bread very inexpensively so I use that each time as well."
"2","5","I love bread pudding and had some old, dry Italian bread I wanted to use up so I was happy to come across this recipe. I made my own version after reading some of the reviews and using what I had on hand. I decided on Southern Comfort Eggnog using 1/2 loaf of bread (crust on), 1 c. milk, 1 c. egg nog, 3 eggs (due to the egg nog), 1/4 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar (didn't want too sweet), nutmeg for the cinnamon and Southern Comfort for the vanilla. I did the butter but not the raisins (not a big fan). I did sprinkle a little white sugar on top before baking and let everything set for about 20 minutes to soak up, baked for about an hour. YUM-O! Top came out nice and crisp with just enough pudding at the bottom. Will definitely make again."
"2","5","I used half & half instead of milk and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Arranged thinly sliced pears sprinkled with cinammon in a pinwheel formation on top--added a nice fruity flavor; will probably cover the whole top with pears next time. A little on the eggy side, but overall delicious!"
"2","5","use this recipe and make my very first bread pudding. turned out great. Family loved it!"
"2","5","I made this last night on a whim! I didnt like bread pudding until I made this! My hubby had never had bread pudding and he loved it too! I added raisens and craisens."
"2","5","I used challah bread, it was perfect!"
"2","5","Delicious! I like the idea of bread pudding but have tried many bland bread puddings and decided to make one myself. This recipe was great! Super easy and my kids loved it. Just enough flavor with the cinnamon and vanilla and thickness from the eggs."
"2","5","THE BEST! I have made this many times and I have found what works best!! Top shelf ingredients!! I use Greenlees 'best cinnamon bread' w/ or w/out raisins, at least 2 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste and turbinado vanilla sugar! I use approx 1/2 cup of turdinado sugar in the recipe and then the rest I dust the top with when baking! It makes a good crunch on the top! I cook until browned usually about 30 mins. I also top with a run sauce submitted by KDA949 found on this site. Make sauce when pudding is done and cooling and serve hot!! 100 stars!!!!!"
"2","5","Very easy and quite yummy. I followed the recipe pretty precisely. I ran out of raisins so I used 1/2 dried cherries. I would spray the 8 inch square pan with non-stick spray since everything was totally stuck."
"2","5","5 star I changed the raisins to Chocolate chips.It was moist and had just enough chocolate for my addiction."
"2","4","Delicious! But I used one less egg and added some nutmeg. It made a large, very sweet mixture so next time I'll probably use a little less sugar and more bread. Another tip is to use a wider baking pan rather than a deeper one to fit all your ingredients. You'll end up with more of the crusty topping that tastes oh-so-good. Also, my pudding puffed up so much in the oven that I thought it was going to overflow. But once I took it out, it sank again. So all was good."
"2","5","Wow! I never would have imaged that the best bread pudding I've ever had would be bread pudding I made myself! The only deviation from the recipe was that I added 8 pieces of bread instead of 6. I just used cheap, grocery store white bread, but the result was amazing! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!"
"2","5","Wow, this was really good bread pudding! I had 7 slices of regular white bread I had in the fridge, so I just used the rest. After reading some reviews about it being watery I decided to add the raisins, because I knew they would soak up extra liquid and they also displayed well on the photo with them. I used 1 small 1.5 oz packaged serving box for the raisins. And, then I baked it in a round cake pan sprayed with cooking spray. It both looked and tasted delicious! I may save this again for a Christmas breakfast."
"2","5","My oh My... Absolutely wonderful! I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown other than that I didn't change a thing. Easy to make and takes terrific. Will make again and again. Thank you for sharing!"
"2","5","I am in love with this recipe. It is very simple and always yields wonderful results, even if you play with the ingredients. I have found that old dinner rolls and hot dog buns create the best texture. Have also subbed the sugar for 1/2c splenda w/ 1/4 c brown sugar & half egg substitute. Thank you EllenMarie."
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I had read the reviews saying 4 eggs might be too much, but it was perfect in my case. I used 4 smallish pieces of cinnamon raisin bread and one cinnamon raisin bagel. Added a bit more cinnamon and vanilla (maybe 1.5 teaspoons each). Perfection. I will definitely try the vanilla sauce next time (out of cornstarch)"
"2","2","A massively sweet bread pudding. I understand that some like the custard texture, but I actually prefer more of a bread note in my bread pudding."
"2","5","This is the best bead puddding ever. It has the wonderful egg custard taste I love. I will be using this recipe a lot. I used french bread and a little more cinnamon and forgot the vanilla. It was still great. Thanks for a great recipe."
"2","5","This is awesome! I put mine into a large pie plate and it turned out delicious! Great just the way it's written!"
"2","5","This recipe is incredible. I used half of a leftover (and stale) french bread loaf, skipped the raisins, added walnuts, and sprinked raw sugar on top. It was absolutely FANTASTIC. Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
"2","4","This was a wonderful, and very customizable recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used one less slice of bread (Italian, store-bought), and I sprinkled the top of the pudding with cinnamon sugar before I put it in the oven. I think next time I will use a denser bread and add some fruit to it (not really a fan of raisins), but as it was, it came out very nicely and yummy. I baked it for a little longer to get the top to be a little crispier, and think that extension of the time by 10-15 minutes would be a good idea overall. All in all, a wonderful and useful recipe that people can make to their own tastes. Thank you."
"2","5","I used 3 eggs, 1 & 3/4 c milk and 1/4 brown and 1/4 white sugar, plus another teaspoon of white sugar. I cut up a small apple, and added fresh grated nutmeg to the top before placing in the oven. Honestly, it was so good, I could have eaten it all myself (& I don't eat much!) A+"
"2","5","I've been trying out different recipes for years and have been searching for the perfect recipe and here it is!! I just read over the 1st three comments and was sold on this recipe so I tried it out after reading the reviews. I used French bread from the grocery store and also took Chef Eeyore's advice on his/her review and used 3 instead of 4 eggs and it turned out beautifully. Thank you for the suggestion! I also sprinkled more cinnamon evenly over the top, which I love!"
"2","5","Yummy! Used Cinnamon Swirl bread and omitted the raisins. Thank you for sharing EllenMarie =)"
"2","5","Simple, easy, and cheap! What more could you ask for! Also good with sliced almonds with almond extract instead of vanilla!"
"2","4","This was my first time making bread pudding and I thought it came out really well. I used 7 slices of sour dough bread and 3 eggs. I would definitely recommend this."
"2","5","I found this recipe for my 80-year-old dad to make. It was DELICIOUS!!! He said he threw an extra handful of raisins on top before putting it in the oven. He also said he had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes, for a total of 60 minutes. Everyone wants the recipe now!"
"2","5","This is one of those recipes that I really could eat the entire pan all by myself. I did change just a little bit because of ingredients that I already had in the house. I had about 7 slices of raisin bread leftover, so I used that. Just to make sure that it was rich enough, I through in a little mini chocolate chips. After mixing everything together, I sprinkled the top with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. Absolutely delicious - it is so hard to keep myself from finishing it off right now!"
"2","5","This is like Grandmas bread pudding. I added a little nutmeg to mine and hit the target, just like grandmas. Bread pudding is supose to be custard-like and the sides and top are supose to be a little drier and crispier."
"2","5","OMG... I took one bite and thought, 'This is like the best french-toast I've ever had!' When I did this I didn't use raisins, but that's only because I didn't have any. I fallowed the directions, with a addition or two. After I added the egg mixture over the bread, I covered the pan in foil and placed it in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. I took it from the fridge, then pulled back the foil to make sure all the bread was well soaked in the mixture. I put the foil back in place and baked it for 25 minutes... I removed it from the oven and took of the foil, before putting it back in. I baked it for another 30 minutes, so 55 minutes all together. Once it was done, I set it aside and let it cool, but just enough to slice. It was wonderful surved with a little whiped-cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top. ;-)"
"2","5","Great recipe! I made with Cinnabon cinnamon bread and it was to die for. This has perfect texture, not too dry nor too soggy and a nice sugar crunch on top. I will be making this again and again."
"2","2","I was really looking forward to trying this recipe out and came away disappointed. I followed the recipe as written and it turned into a dense, blandish french toast. I used sweet challah, so this shouldn't be the reason. It's edible but I won't make it again."
"2","5","I was looking for a recipe to copy the rasberry bread pudding at my local bakery. I decided to try this one as a base because it got great reviews and was easy. I left out the cinnamon and stirred in a few dollops of rasberry jam. It turned out great. Not quite as good as the bakery because I'm sure they don't use jam for their rasberry mixture, but a very worthy copy, satisfied my craving for much much less! Oh and I did add a couple extra pieces of bread because it seemed too soupy."
"2","5","Best ever, I used cinnamon swirl bread, used whipping cream instead of milk, doubled the butter by accident, only used 3 eggs b/c thats all i had and topped it an altered version of the vanilla sauce recipe from this site. Vanilla sauce as follows: 2 tblsp cornstarch & 1 cup sugar in saucepan, whisk in 1 cup water, boil, stirring constantly for 1 minute remove from heat; then add 1/4 cup melted butter and 2 tsp. vanilla. If your a bread pudding lover like myself you will love this recipe, if your a hater like my husband, you still might love this recipe, he said it was very very good!"
"2","5","I have made this recipe using the exact recipe and it was amazing. I do not like bread pudding, but this one I do. The second time I made it I used some left over Romanian Cozonac bread left over from Easter (anything blessed must be used not thrown away) I used 1 less egg in the recipe and only 1/2 cup of sugar as the bread itself is sweet. WOW. It was amazing! I put a warm maple sauce over top and voila a wonderful dessert. Thanks for a great recipe!. I have posted my picture."
"2","5","This turned out really good! Unfortunately the first time I made it, I forgot to add the sugar... duh!... We ate it anyway, just put a little pancake syrup on top. This time I made it right... without forgetting the sugar! LOL! It is sooo yummy! I am not really big on bread pudding, but I wanted to give it a fair shot anyway. I am glad I did. I will make this again! Yum!"
"2","5","I made this without raisins and heavy creme instead of milk. I also used Cinnamon Bread by Cinnabon (similar to Pepperidge Farm's) and regular white bread. I made it for a guy I liked whose favorite dessert is bread pudding."
"2","5","Really excellent dish! Definitely a keeper. I adjusted as per other reviews: 3 eggs instead of 4, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used 1/4 cup golden raisins and 1/4 dried cranberries simply because my children love them. Last modification was that I used oatty nut bread rather than white (hey, a little fiber couldn't hurt) simply because it was all I had on hand, even though my husband made fun of me for that substitution. I served it with the vanilla sauce found on this site and everyone LOVED it. Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"2","5","This is so easy to modify for my heathy lifestyle! I used whole wheat bread, PAM butter flavored cooking spray, and evaporated skimmed milk. I'm a big fan of maple syrup, but rather than replacing the sugar with it, I reduced the sugar (brown) to 1/2 cup so I can top the bread pudding with maple syrup before eating. It was a delicious recipe before; now it is perfect in every way!"
"2","4","I used cut up leftover finger rolls, decreased to 3 eggs and 1-1/2 cups of milk, and 1/2 cup sugar. Delicious!"
"2","5","WONDERFUL recipe! This was the easiest bread pudding I ever made. I used left-over dinner rolls and only 2 eggs as it was all I had on hand. I allowed the bread mixture to soak for about 15 minutes before baking. The baking time was perfect. I will surely be using this recipe again. Thank you ELLENMARIE for sharing!"
"2","1","I made this yesterday. i will never make this again. this tasted like pancakes half-way cooked. Blah =("
"2","5","Super easy and very delicious. I opted to use both brown and white sugar, added the raisins and half a cup of pecan pieces, and it was fabulous. I'd never made bread pudding before, but I'll definitely make it again."
"2","5","Very good and easy to make."
"2","5","Have used this recipe faithfully for 2 years now. Is always a big hit with everyone! Kids don't like raisins though so I substituted for lightly cinn/sugared apple slices. Yum!!"
"2","4","AAAAaaaaaamazing! I made it last Thanksgiving. It was so amazing!"
"2","5","I've tried other bread pudding recipes but this is the best. I used French bread and it came out great. All enjoyed."
"2","5","Just divine! And so easy to make. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Served with a drizzle of real maple syrup (not the fake stuff). My family loved it!"
"2","5","Boy is this recipe a keeper! I made this bread pudding last weekend and it has been demanded again by my family. WOW this was good!! The only thing I changed was I added 1/4 cup of Irish Cream and substituted a 1/2 cup of heavy cream for 1/2 cup of milk and increased the bread a little. Several of my dinner guest for this Sunday have already placed orders for bread pudding to go."
"2","5","This was my first attempt at bread pudding. My husband who loves bread pudding said it was the best. He really liked it. I used the cinnamon swirl bread that they sell at Costco that I toasted in the toaster and instead of milk I used half and half since I had it on hand. I also took other reviewer's suggestions and did half brown sugar and half white sugar. It was not soggy at all, which is what my husband like about it. He likes the cruchy outter edges the best, but even so the middle was not soggy so that why we liked it. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream."
"2","5","Mmmm, this was really good. It's simple and appears to be very versatile. I used half-cup of brown sugar, soaked the raisins in freshly squeezed orange juice the night before, and added some marachino cherries I had. It was absolutely delicious. My husband was so delighted and we already have plans to serve it at our next dinner party. I might try making it with bananas and some chopped walnuts next time as the recipe lends itself to flexibility. Delicious!"
"2","5","I sprinkled in some frozen blueberries before baking."
"2","5","I made this for my brother-in-law with rum sauce a few years ago and he still raves about it. This is one of his all time favorite desserts."
"2","5","Made it for lunch and everyone loved it. My husband had 2 helpings! He told me not to make it at first but when it came out from the oven, even he couldn't resist ;p Thanks for such a beautiful recipe. Simply made it because of the good reviews it has. I'm not a big fan of bread pudding but undoubtedly, it was great! Used brown sugar instead of white. I didn't have raisins so I went without any toppings."
"2","5","For one thing, it sure didn't turn out like the picture. It was no where near ugly and I should suppose it was mine to blame, not the recipe. I ended up using two extra slices of bread (sandwich bread) and it turned out perfect. Like others have said, it wasn't a 'Wower.' It definitely tasted good, it just wasn't so lovely that I'd have to make it all the time-- extremely easy to make."
"2","5","I have been do dissapointed by recipes in the past and this is fabulous and easy! This is my new bread pudding recipe. I had leftover rolls and made 2 batches: one with raisins and one with chocolate chips. They're both already half gone!"
"2","5","I love this recipe! I have made it many times both as written and with modifications. Right now, I'm trying to lose weight so I eliminated the butter and used Splenda in place of the sugar. It still tasted GREAT! I also only use 3 eggs, because with 4 eggs it was a bit too eggy for me. My husband and 15 month also love it!"
"2","5","Since I found this recipe I have made it MANY times! All the liquid gets absorbed by the bread so there is no runny, slimy custard to have to worry about. My kids, who are 3 & 2, LOVE IT! Even my 68-year-old father loves it. (My mother never even knew he liked bread pudding after almost 40 years of marriage.) I normally double this and don't change a thing. Comes out perfect every time! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Spec-Freaking-Tacular... Thats all I have to say"
"2","4","AWSOME recipe, but ya MUST use the watter bath otherwise it will fall lol i made this mistake."
"2","5","I have had such a good time with this recipe! I have added sliced apples, dried blueberries, cranberries, and sliced almonds (when you add fruit you have to decrease the milk a bit because it gets soggy if you don't). I have used blueberry strudel, whole grain, and wonder bread. It is just plain great every time. I love it!"
"2","4","Very good, try with golden raisins"
"2","5","OH MY GOSH! EXCELLENT! Perfect baking time too! I've already had two servings and had to stop myself otherwise it'll be gone before the kids wake from their nap :) My daughter loved helping tear the bread up and mixing the eggs/milk. I added more cinnamon & vanilla than called for, and some nutmeg too, but that's just preference. So good!"
"2","4","Just made this, yummo! I'm not a big bread pudding fan either. I did use 8 pieces of bread and put 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of raisins. My husband wants me to put raisins in next time, my son wants extra chocolate chips next time, so now I will have to do a half and half or two seperate pans, LOL Since I'm the cook, I will use maybe 1 or 2 more pieces of bread, just to firm it up, the texture of this recipe is the way it should be, but I like it firmer, kudos to the person who made this up! Easy and delish!"
"2","5","This was so easy and turned out perfect. I might have used a bit more bread since I was using leftover crusty loaf bread. I knew with so many great reviews it had to be good."
"2","4","yummy! i used one less egg like the other reviewers recommended - so next time I think I would try four to make it more custardy. I would also cut the crusts off the bread - I used whole wheat bread so the crust was pretty hard."
"2","5","Easy, easy, easy! So simple and so good. Can be eaten for dessert or breakfast."
"2","4","I had never made or even tasted bread pudding, but a co-worker of mine said that she loved it growing up, so I thought it was worth a try. I chose this recipe because of all the great reviews & I already had all the ingredients in the house. I was very impressed! Very yummy...reminded me of French Toast. I did add an extra slice of bread, but I think I would like it better with even more (it seemed a little mushy). But hey, I really have nothing to compare it to! Overall, great, easy recipe."
"2","4","Made this for co workers and they loved it. I added some apples and nuts to mine since they love apples. There was none left by the end of our shift."
"2","5","Using this recipe, I made bread pudding today for the first time ever. After reading the other reviews, I froze the leftover pumpkin bread from Christmas breakfast, 1 Bob Evans roll and a few baguette slices from Christmas dinner, and used them instead of the sliced bread. It is a great way to use up extra bread of any kind.  I used the four eggs, all brown sugar, half skim milk & half heavy cream, and added extra vanilla & cinnamon. After the baking, I put it under the LO broiler for about a minute, because I like a crunchy top. Wow! My husband who has always told me he doesn't like bread pudding, loved it and even had seconds. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","I've made this before with bread and it was great. Ever have leftover waffles or pancakes, and you don't know what to do with them? I just made this with waffles. It works, and it's pretty good."
"2","5","Excellent as it is. Like all who play in the kitchen, I too 'slant' the recipe for the occasion. A bit of Liqueur a table spoon or so in the bread mixture - experiment: brandy is popular, but Kahlua is also very good. I agree too with either half and half instead of milk for richness; have used evaporated milk - very good as well. But this is an excellent dessert with things you already have on hand."
"2","5","This is really good, except for one thing. I make our bread, and so on Mon. I made the bread, and Tues. made this recipe. I did not change anything, it came out a slight bit dry. I'm thinking it's result of homemade bread. Store bread doesn't soak up quite as much moisture as homemade does. For that reason, I will make this several more times, and I will increase the amt of milk first. From 2 C. to 2 1/2 C. If that doesn't quite do it I will add 1 more egg.  I'll keep you all updated on it. It really is worth figuring out the ratios for me. It's delicious. Thanks."
"2","5","The only change I made was to use two potato hot dog buns and three slices of sliced Italian bread. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a 'T'. It's fantastic - totally reminds me of how my mom made it when I was a kid. I will no longer search for another bread pudding recipe."
"2","4","Very good recipe. No 'WOW' factor, but very good. I used sourdough bread. I will make again, but I might play around w/some additional ingredients, like chocolate chips or something. Thanks for the recipe, Ellen."
"2","5","This is one of the easiest bread pudding recipes I've ever seen, so I gave it a try. I'm glad I did! Soooooo delicious, and so easy! I added more cinnamon and vanilla (because I love cinnamon and vanilla), but other than that I made it as written. I tried it fresh from the oven and chilled, but I like warm better, so I just warm up leftovers in the microwave. I think I'll use this bread pudding recipe from now on."
"2","5","This is the best recipe! I made 72 servings for a large dinner. Omitted the raisins, used 3 parts half and half 1 part milk, half cane sugar/half white sugar. I served it with whipped topping. Everyone raved over it. My mother said it was better than so-and-so's recipe, which is an honor! Better than restaurant quality. I cannot say enough! Did I mention this was the first time I made bread pudding?"
"2","5","My kids loved this. I used 4 hotdog buns that I had leftover and it worked perfect."
"2","5","This recipe for Bread Pudding is the best. It taste awesome!!!!!!"
"2","5","This bread pudding was awesome! It was exactly like how bread pudding should be. Super moist and perfectly sweet, amazing."
"2","5","made this a few hours ago, waited for a couple more hours before serving, for it to set and completely cool down. it was chowed down by my roommates in no time. they kept raving about how good it was. i used plain white bread, half & half in place of milk and no raisins. served it with creme anglaise II (found the recipe here)- perfect accompaniment! to me the pudding tastes better at room temperature rather than just out of the oven - would recommend making a few hours or a day before serving."
"2","5","Wow! Just like Grandma's and so easy. Instead of the bread slices, I used 4 cinnamon/raisin bagels. We have a pot luck dinner at our church every Wednesday night and I made this for one of them. It was gone before any other desserts. I had to make copies of the recipe for 7 of the ladies. Now when I go in the door on Wednesday nights they all look to see what I have brought."
"2","5","Perfect and so authentic! I used this bread pudding with rum sauce also found on this web site."
"2","5","For 13x9 pan, I used double the bread (day old monkey bread from the bakery), 5 eggs, 3 cups milk, 1/2 c br. sugar, 1/2c white sugar, tsp or so cinnamon, dash of allspice, tsp vanilla, & some raisins. Melted double the butter poured over bread in greased pan. Mixed milk mixture good and poured over all and really pressed the bread in good, so all was moist. Baked at 350 for 1 hour. Made a glaze out of powdered sugar, margarine, milk & vanilla. Poured over while the pudding was hot. Oh man....AWESOME! Hubby went NUTS for this!"
"2","5","So easy to make, my 3 year old helped. The kids love to eat it. I know this will be something I make again."
"2","5","Tried this recipe today, loved it! Easy to follow and turned out great! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"2","5","THIS WAS GOOD,MADE A FEW CHANGES......USED RAISIN BREAD I BAKED,HALF AND HALF CREAM,TOPPED BREAD PUDDING WITH COCONUT AND CHOPPED PECANS BAKED 40 MINS,SERVED WITH A WARM VANILLA SAUCE."
"2","4","I just made this last night for my boyfriends office breakfast meeting. It got rave reviews at the office. A couple of people asked him for the recipe. I made the bread pudding with sliced french bread and golden raisins. I used half and half instead of milk. Paired it with a butter rum sauce (rum, vanilla, butter and sugar) so goooood!"
"2","5","My #1 most favorite desert. The only thing I modified was I grated some lemon zest and sprinkle in the egg mixture and I used california golden raisins. While the pudding is baking, you could smell the lovely assence of lemon. It makes the whole house smells like Gramdma has been baking all day. I got a vanilla sauce recipe from this site too and I also added lemon zest to the sauce recipe. Cut back on the sugar for the sauce, if not it would be too sweet. My guests loved it. A+ for this recipe. Yummo!"
"2","5","Came out Perfect!!! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","I made 'cinimmon raisin bread I' to use with this recipe. Instead of raisins, I used craisins in the bread and didn't put any additional craisins in the bread pudding. I also used half and half instead of milk for extra richness. I had never made bread pudding before and it came out great! Tasted like a piece of french toast!"
"2","5","I won't lie... I honestly ate the entire dish of this. It was amazing."
"2","5","I used half and half (4 egg), only 2/3c sugar, 6T butter (I think 4T would be better), only 1/3c raisins (I wish I used 1/2c), 1T rum. Wonderful even I forgot the cinnamon! Thanks."
"2","5","This bread pudding was so easy to make & absolutely delicious! I had it with vanilla sauce & also tried it with some milk poured on it. Great both ways! I'll definitely be making this again soon."
"2","5","Fantastic!! I agree with using 3 eggs instead of four. I used stale raisin bread, about 13 slices (its a small loaf). I topped it with a simple rum sauce: 1 c powered sugar, 4 tbsp rum, and 1/4 c butter. I plan to make it for my dad, it was his childhood favorite dessert."
"2","4","Easy recipe that produces a great, delicious end to a meal! Must admit I was nervous just because I’ve never made this before…but I’m happy to report it was simple and delicious! Here were my modifications: I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 glass pan (heat 325’). I had made cinnamon-raisin bread, so I used that, not adding any extra raisins. I used 7 large eggs and whole milk (creamy, but not as heavy as whipping cream of half & half). Doubled cinnamon because I love it! And I used a vanilla bean instead of the extract. Served with vanilla bean ice cream and was an after-dinner delight!"
"2","5","Pat, a great cook for Ameritech in Saginaw, MI, made the BEST bread pudding! This is it! She always told us it was easy!  I used cinnamon bread, and it was a little on the sweet side for me, next batch will only have 1/2 cup sugar; but I'm making it again tomorrow!  I looked at, at least, 40 different recipes from different web sites, and based on recommendations chose this 'perfect' recipe."
"2","5","Fabulous recipe!!! I used lots of day old croissants and added freshly ground nutmeg and allspice. I made sure to soak the torn croissants first. It first looked flat and boring...then voila! It rose like you wouldn't believe!! So fancy!! I made a recipe and a half. Using 6 eggs and a little over a cup of sugar and 3 cups of whole milk. This was in NO WAY eggy at all! It was perfect. It's been added to my recipe file for good. By the way, don't forget to butter your dish and I used my pyrex glass casserole rectangular dish for this. It was gorgeous!!!!  Thanks for making our family happier and possibly heavier too!"
"2","5","I'd never made, nor eaten, for that matter--bread pudding. I love rice pudding so I thought I'd give this a try. Didn't want to make too much so I cut the recipe down to 4 servings, using 2 glass custard cups with 1 slice wheat bread per cup. Used 1 large egg, omitted the raisins and used Splenda to sweeten. Put the glass custard cups on a metal sheet and baked for 35 min. It rose up like a souffle. Topped it with whipped cream and ate while still hot. YUM! Made a wonderful dessert for my 10 year old and I. Tasted rich and fattening without actually being high in calories. Super easy and quick to prepare, and a great treat for a cold rainy afternoon. Will make again for sure!"
"2","5","I have made alot of changes to this recipe so it's my 'base' real good though. Thanks for it! :-)"
"2","5","Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I made this last night. This took so little time to put together. By the time it was finished baking, supper was ready. Highly reccommend this recipe."
"2","5","OMG!!!! This is the easiest and YUMMIEST bread pudding I have ever made!!! Awesome as a snack or even as a weekend breakfast! Just perfect as it is and I used cheap fresh white sliced bread! I beat the egg/milk mixture until it was nice and frothy and it came out fabulous!!!! - Will make often!!!"
"2","5","i had loaves after loaves of french bread. this was the perfect recipe for them. no changes! it was delicious! everyone loved it."
"2","5","This recipe is simple and the results are amazing. Everyone who tried it loved it!"
"2","5","GOOOOD! I USED THE HEELS OF WHEAT BREAD. ADDED 1/4 CUP BROWN SUGAR AND CHOPPED PECANS."
"2","4","Really good, I just used regular white bread from the store and doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan. Don't skip the raisins, they really add to the flavor of this. A hit at our house!"
"2","4","Great recipe! Thanks! I made a few revisions and I got SO many requests that I started selling it!!!! To double the recipe, I use a rolls, sliced bread or croissants to fill a casserole dish...7 eggs, 3 1/2 cups of milk, 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. 1 tbsp nutmeg, 1tbsp cinn and 1 tbsp vanilla. I also soak a cup of raisins in RUM for a few hours and I mash one ripe banana. Mix all together ALL together and let sit in fridge overnight or at least a few hours. Bake slowly at 325 until middle is no longer wet. Top with a vanilla rum sauce made with butter, confectioner's sugar and a little milk! YUMMY TUMMY!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","I used 8 pieces of croissant but found that the custard mix not enough to soak them. So altogether made the custard mix with 6 eggs, 3C milk and 1C sugar. Threw in some toasted walnuts, choc chips and dried cranberries. Excluded the cinnamon though. Served with vanilla ice cream. Excellent! Children commented that it tasted just like the ones at a deli here."
"2","4","Taste great just like I would except from a good bread pudding. I add less sugar like other review has suggested and it tastes perfect. The only problem I had was the raisin burned on me, although the pudding itself is perfect. I also only baked for 40mins"
"2","4","My opinion is that it was good, not great. HOWEVER; my coworkers...in the food science industry, thought it was really good, so don't let my opinion sway too much. I am still looking for a good sauce to accompany this...."
"2","5","This was a very easy recipe that both my husband and I loved. He's a very picky eater and he ate every bite! I'll definitely use this recipe again and again. Thanks!"
"2","5","This is so good, and I cannot believe how easy. I made it for my Mother-in-law who was visiting for the first time in 7 years ( huge brownie points were scored ). We didn't have any raisins so I used dried cherries, and it was a major hit !"
"2","5","I love this recipe! I've reviewed it before, but wanted to add that I just made it with dried cranberries (instead of raisins). Excellent!!! I highly recommend it."
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I used evaporated skim milk and added fresh blueberries. YUM"
"2","5","I had never had Bread Pudding but after reading the reviews I decided to try it. My husband and I love it and I have made it several times. It is so easy to make. Just recently I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and peaches and it was awesome. Thank you so much."
"2","5","LOVED IT! I had an untouched loaf of French bread that was like a giant crouton, doubled the recipe, sprinkled on some wheat germ, reduced the sugar a little, and added nutmeg. It was a wonderful BREAKFAST!"
"2","5","Absolutely THE BEST!! I used 2 day old homemade cinnamon rolls (made from the Tasty Bun recipe on this site), added nuts and flaked coconut then drizzled my own vanilla glaze over the top. I had two pieces before it even cooled!"
"2","5","I've made this recipe many times. It has turned out to be our favorite bread pudding recipe because of the ease to make and it can be made with cheap white bread and still tastes great."
"2","5","I'm very picky about my bread pudding since it was a traditional recipe my Grandmother whipped up...she would be proud. Great job!"
"2","5","I made this for Mother's Day. It turned out great. I used Peppridge Farms cin. swirl bread, omitted the raisins, cut down on the white sugar, added brown. I ended up adding more bread since it seemes soupy. Everyone loved it."
"2","5","Wooooowww! So good, this was my first time trying bread pudding, the smell alone was enough to make me go crazy for the first bite! I used cinnamon swirl bread, and added dashes of nutmeg in as well. It was marvelous! Make sure you add a little brown sugar for a little extra taste!! My dad, who ate almost the whole pan, STONGLY recommends"
"2","4","This was very good. The perfect way to use up some bread that would have otherwise gone to waste at our house."
"2","5","This is very tasty. An old family tradition is to soak raisins in rum before using them in cakes and cookies. This further enhances the flavor of the pudding and makes it a perfect match for a light rum sauce or rum and raisin ice cream. Try it!"
"2","4","I have made this recipe twice. I have doubled it both times because I have a large family. It has really good flavor. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it ended up a bit dry. The only part that was moist was the center. The second time, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar. It ended up really moist, almost too moist. I do plan on making this again and I will use half brown and half white sugar. I also let it sit for about 30 minutes to soak up some of the liquid. I would like to have it sit over night, but I forget to. :)"
"2","5","Loved it. And I don't like bread pudding - neither does my husband - and we gobbled it up. Soooo good. I had some leftover cinnamon rolls (I know, what kind of person has leftover cinnamon rolls?), so I used six of those with 3 slices store bought whole wheat bread. I also added about a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the mixture. I agree with a previous post that I would probably drop an egg from the recipe next time.  Thank you so much for sharing! It was delicious and I will be sharing this with family and friends. YUM."
"2","4","I am not a huge fan of bread pudding. I made it for my mom and grandma. They enjoyed it. I added nutmeg like so many had suggested. I also found a vanilla sauce on this site to go with it."
"2","5","Excellent! Wonderful texture and flavor, not too sweet. My only objection is the servings, I made a double batch and it sure won’t serve 12 in this house. Thanks Ellen this is just what I was looking for. Definitely a keeper."
"2","5","Good ol' fashioned Brit food. This is better than what my Nan makes! Very traditional and yummy!"
"2","5","This was so quick and easy. It came out great!! We used 1/2 c. of white sugar and 1/2 c. of brown sugar and didn't use rasins (we didn't have any) and it was wonderful!"
"2","5","Wow! I searched out this recipe to use up some stale whole wheat buns and came out with a delicious dessert! I love that all of the ingredients are ones that I usually have on hand. The only changes I made to the recipe were to use whole wheat bread and only 1/2C of sugar (with the raisins it was sweet enough). My husband and two young kids raved about this. I will definitely make this again!"
"2","5","This recipe is just so simple to make and my husband just loved it!! I replaced the rasins with chopped up bannanas and served it warm with vanilla ice cream; topping it off with a drizzle of chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. It was well worth the indulgence = ) !!"
"2","5","Deeeelicious (eating it right now!) I've made this a few times and have found the melted butter/margarine unnecessary and I cut down on the egg. I omit raisins and by doing all of this, the excellent flavor is all still there!!"
"2","5","I made this receipe for a dinner at our Clubhouse and it was a hit. I did cut down on the amount of eggs. Made it for 220 people in 8 pans of 30 cuts each. It was excellent and got tons of great reviews from people that didn't even like Bread Pudding till this. Would make it again anytime. My family also loves it and they never had Bread Pudding before either."
"2","5","This is a great recipe. I don't think I have ever had bread pudding with 'just bread'. I have always had it made with leftover doughnuts, cake, cinnamon rolls etc. Freeze those leftover bread products and when you have enough, make this! I made it with cinnamon rolls and it was excellent. Because of the sugar on the cinnamon rolls, I cut it down by half and didn't add additional cinnamon. I am feeding a crowd this weekend and will surely have doughnuts from Saturtday leftover, therefore Sunday morning we will have this bread pudding! Once a freind of mine had some lemon cake left and used it (minus the icing) along with doughnuts and it was delicous."
"2","5","Following the recipe as is yielded a mushy bread pudding (not exactly what I like) but I'm sure a little tweaking by reducing an egg or some milk or adding more bread will do the trick next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe, as it is a good base to work with."
"2","5","oh my this was delish!!(and way easy!) I took the advice of one review and made with whipping cream, 1/4 c brown sugar and cinnamon swirl bread. It was so yummy I had to have seconds. Thanks for an amazing recipe. Will be making many times!!"
"2","5","So good! I put dried cherries in it, very easy to make."
"2","5","I made it with crasins, in a cast iron skillet. Everyone LOVED it!"
"2","5","Used leftover *A Number One Egg Bread* from this site from Christmas dinner. Absolutely brilliant! Didn't add raisins...don't care for them in my bread pudding. Great hot or cold."
"2","5","I used french bread and cut it into cubes. The crust was so good! I used a little more vanilla, also. It is amazing! The best I have ever tasted."
"2","5","Fantastic recipe! I made some adjustments, double the recipe, use 4 teaspoons of imitation vanilla extract, seedless Jewish rye bread, a lightly greased 11x15 pyrex baking dish, & after pouring the wet ingredients over the bread - press down lightly and let soak for 30-45 minutes before baking for 45-55 minutes @ 350 or until firm. My customers love it!"
"2","5","EXCELLENT. The Best Bread Pudding I ever tasted. I have made it several times and I can still say it is Wonderful. Debbie/Ira"
"2","2","This was like eating soggy french toast. It felt weird in my mouth but tasted very familiar. I have never had bread pudding before and I don't think I will try it again. This was very wet the first morning. Two days later I heated some up and it was a drier and sturdier consistency which I enjoyed better. But, no, I will not make this again. It probably is not a reflection on the recipe as much as a taste preference."
"2","5","Loved it. Used 4 eggs, but 8 slices of bread. Will absolutly make again."
"2","5","This was awesome it did not last very long next time I'm doubling this it was so good. I did use cinnamon swirl day old bread and cooked it about 15 minutes longer because it seemrd to googy. thanks for sharing this."
"2","5","Hands Down...THE BEST!!! If you are making this dish for an event I would recommend that you hide it from yourself as soon as it's out of the oven. Yes, it's that good."
"2","5","This is like one of the best comfort foods I've had! Not just best tasting but was sooo easy to make. As suggested by the other reviewers, I also cut down on the sugar and sprinkled brown sugar on the top. I am not big on raisins, so I opted that one out. Will try with nuts next time. The only thing different I did was to bake this in a waterbath, like how my mom bakes her bread pudding. My mom loved this one so much that she took a huge portion to work...!"
"2","5","This was a terrific bread pudding. I like to use homemade white bread for this one...it holds up well to the milk/egg mixture."
"2","5","Very delicious. My family ate it in one night. I used three eggs last time and I'm going to use two this time to get rid of the slightly eggy taste, but other than that they were extremely tasty."
"2","5","This was good...tasted like a warm cinnamon roll. I like my bread pudding cold as well, so I made this to take camping with us. When I ate it warm it was great but the next day some of the 'juice' had seperated a bit and was at the bottom, and that was a turn off to me so it was thrown out. Maybe I need to bake longer next time?? I dont know, but it was great warm!!"
"2","5","My whole family LOVED this dessert!"
"2","4","I just made this recipe this morning for breakfast and thought it was pretty good. I was surprised at how much it fell when I took it out of the oven, but since I have no prior experience at making bread pudding I don't know if that was supposed to happen or a mistake on my part. I didn't think it was a 5 star recipe, but I'll keep it around :)"
"2","5","My first ever attempt at bread pudding. I just took the casserole out of the oven. My house smells soooo gooood! I used 3 eggs,1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla ext, 1/2 tsp almond ext and sprinkled brown sugar and crushed pecans on top, then sprayed with margerine spray."
"2","4","Pretty good! I added a bit of maple syrup and it tasted very much like french toast. :)"
"2","5","I made this recipe using day old challah bread and it turned out perfectly! It wasn't too moist or too dry and just sweet enough. Loved it and will make it again."
"2","5","I can't believe I actually made something this good and pretty to look at. Really great dessert and so incredibly easy. Love this one!"
"2","5","Super Easy Recipe. Thanks for helping me use up my old bread! Tried this recipe twice and everyone enjoyed it."
"2","5","Love this recipe. Made bread pudding the first time for an office potluck. I use raisin-cinnamon swirl bread instead of white bread. No need to add raisins. I also lessen the sugar as the bread was sweet already. Made vanilla syrup with 1 carton heavy cream, 1 stick butter and 1 tsp vanilla. Dee-licious. Would make again."
"2","5","LOVED this recipe. I substituted 1/2 Sara Lee Brown Sugar Swirl bread and 1/2 day old french bread. Also I added Butterscotch Chips and Golden Raisins. Served with a Boiled Burbon/Butter/Brown Sugar Sauce. PURE DELIGHT!"
"2","5","FINALLY! A delicious use for all the stuff (milk, bread, eggs) that usually goes stale in my house before hubby and I can eat it all. No more wasted hamburger buns!   We could eat this for breakfast, for dessert, or (what the heck) even supper.  This time I had no brown sugar to try it that way, but did have a Granny Smith apple I chopped instead of the raisins. I tossed in a shake of Pumpkin Pie Spice too. An excellent recipe."
"2","5","This is was so good! I used Pepperidge Farm brown sugar swirl bread (I ended up using about 9 slices), used only 3 eggs, subbed cream for milk, and topped it with a vanilla sauce (1/2 C. cream, 1C. sugar, 1 stick butter, 1 tsp. vanilla brought to a simmer for about 5 minutes). My mom said it rivaled the bread puddings she's had in New Orleans."
"2","5","I loved this bread pudding. I made some changes as suggested by other reviewer. Used 3 eggs, 1/2 cup white + 1/4 brown sugar, 1 cup milk + 1 cup heavy cream and added 2 medium finely chopped bananas. It was a hit! I made the pudding with day old french loaf."
"2","5","Am giving this a 4 as is, but I think adding nutmeg bumps it up to 5! Only used 3 eggs, added the nutmeg, and baked for 50 minutes. (Was just a little short on the vanilla extract, and made up the difference with almond extract.)"
"2","5","Excellent! I added a dash of nutmeg for flavor. Would probably also be good with a bit of lemon peel."
"2","5","This bread pudding is really easy to make and it also tasted very good. I used the Sara Lee Soft & Smooth Classic White bread and followed the recipe the way it is. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
"2","5","This recipe was so easy and very yummy. My husband loved it and said not to change a thing. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"2","4","I used a couple of suggestions and some flair of my own and it came out delicious! I used 3 eggs, 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 cup whipping cream , 1 cup low fat milk, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a mixture of raisin bread and pannetone. I drizzeled the melteded butter on top after adding the egg mixture. I also added a little brown sugar, 1/4 cup choc chips and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts to give it a nice topping. I think next time I will try different bread (maybe chocolate cherry bread)."
"2","5","I would give this more stars If I could. My first attempt at making bread pudding - now I'm hooked. I improvised with what I had - used 6 slices of french toast bread (the thick kind), cut down the sugar to 1/4 c white and 1/4 c brown (to compensate for the sweeter bread), and used orange flavored cranberries instead of raisens. This will be dessert for our Christmas Eve dinner from now on. mmmmmmmm Thanks."
"2","4","I charred the top so it wasn't spectacular. As the recipe says, make sure ALL the bread is covered well so that it wont get too crispy. Otherwise it was good, especially with some custard on top."
"2","4","This recipe was really good. I used cinnamon raison bread so I skipped both the cinnamon and raisons in the recipe. I also substituted brown sugar for some of the white as previous reviewers had suggested. I will definitely try this again, maybe with a few more modifications."
"2","5","This made a wonderful breakfast dish - using the original recipe! I am having guests over the holidays and plan to serve this on morning. If I was going to use this as a dessert, I would follow the other suggestions - less egg, nutmeg, more cinnamin, part brown sugar."
"2","5","I had a full loaf of stale bread and figured I would try to use it. I have a thing about soggy bread, but tried it anyway. A pleasant surprise, really would not have known it was bread if I hadn't made it and the flavors were great. Family enjoyed this very much, even the kids.Thanks"
"2","5","This is a keeper of a recipe! I used 4 small eggs as people seemed to recommend 3 and instead of raisins, as I didnt have any, I mixed in 3 small overripe bananas into the egg mixture. It came up a treat! I also made pouring custard (with brandy of course! :) go on top and YUMMO! Will definitely make again! Thanx!!"
"2","5","I made this to feed 450 people last weekend and it turned out great! I have to say that the organization I catered for was mostly people 50 and older, and I had alot of them come to me afterwords and tell me it tasted like something their mother or grandmother made back in the day. Good job on the recipe!"
"2","4","This was a very good recipe. I made a few modifications: I used three eggs as suggested by others who've made this, I added pinches of nutmeg and cloves, and I let the bread soak in the egg mixture for about twenty minutes before baking it. It came out very sweet, so next time I'll cut back to 2/3 cup or so of sugar instead of the 3/4 cup. Overall it had a very good texture and flavor. It's not a very eggy recipe as I made it, which is what I prefer."
"2","4","I just tried this recipe, it was good! But something was missing...came out crunchy on top and soggy on the bottom. Like others, I HIGHLY recommend not using more than 3 eggs and cutting down on the sugar [I used 2/3 cup sugar]. Also, substituting 1 cup heavy cream for 1 cup milk is a great idea! Make sure to soak the raisins in milk or some liquor of choice. May be next time I will let the mixture soak for a good half hour before baking."
"2","5","An all around great recipe! A wonderful way to use up your bread scraps. I even put left over pancakes in it and it was YUMMY!"
"2","5","This is a very good recipe. I used half & half instead of milk, crosssaints in place of the bread & pecans in place of the raisins. Be prepared to smell the most delicious aroma while this is baking. While it was still warm, I made an icing up of 2 Tbsp butter, 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and a couple Tbsp of milk and poured it over the pudding. My DH really likes it!"
"2","5","BEST Bread pudding I ever tasted. First time I ever made it. I Doubled the recipe and took the following advice: Used 15 slices of bread, 5 eggs, 2 cups egg nog, 2 cups milk, 1 cup of sugar. I also put the bread in the Oven 250 degrees for 10 minutes since I didn't have any stale bread. It took approx 55-60 min. Came out perfect. Thanks everyone for this pefect recipe. Hope this helps you achieve the perfection I enjoyed."
"2","5","This recipe was very good and easy. I added a custard sauce made with 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup butter. Bring to a boil for 5 mins, then I added 2 tbs. brandy. Yummy!"
"2","5","I love bread pudding and this is by far the best one I have tasted. My son who dosen't like rasins even likes it...Only things I changed were, I toasted bread until dry/slightly brown instead of day old, warmed the milk and added a little nutmeg. It only took me 25 minutes to cook for it to be done in a 350 oven"
"2","5","Very, very good. I used stale Texas Toast, and my family devoured it. I ate it with rhubarb sauce, and liked it better than lemon sauce, but the rest of the family stuck with good ol' lemon sauce. This tastes just like my Grandma's recipe."
"2","5","YUMMY! I used my own home made whole wheat bread that was getting a bit hard in the fridge. I used a little extra cinnamon and some nutmeg and that worked really well. Also, I doubled the recipe BUT only used five eggs and everyone thought it was perfect. I must recommend 'Carnation Carmel Sauce' from a recipe on this site...it was AWESOME, even using fat-free sweetened condensed milk. It is a winning combo for sure, especially if you need to win over any older folks in your life, this dessert seems to be one of those old-fashioned ones that is comforting and delicious!"
"2","5","This was very good. I used whole wheat bread, and non-fat milk, and it still tasted good. I also used three eggs, and soaked the raisins in brandy for extra flavor."
"2","5","This is THE bread pudding recipe I will use from now on. As suggested, I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and it came out great. I didn't want rocky little raisins in my pudding, and since I was making this for breakfast, I soaked the raisins in Kahlua over night and then strained and added them to the recipe the next morning. I also used the Kahlua instead of the vanilla extract. Yum!"
"2","5","We've been fixing an 8x8 pan a week of this receipe. If you want to 'kick it up a notch', throw in a shot of Jack Daniels to the mixture before you pour it onto the bread. Let it set for about 15 minutes, then place it in the oven. Outstanding!!!!"
"2","5","I took the advise of others, and used less eggs than the recipe called for. I also substituted 1/2 the milk for eggnog....and then used 1/2 the eggs. I also added a touch of nutmeg. WOW!! This was great. My kids and hubby devoured it. The family has raved about this all weeek long. I will be making another batch, while eggnog is still easy to find, during the holidays!"
"2","5","This turned out GREAT! I've never made bread pudding before and this was so easy. I needed to use up some whipping cream and eggnog so I used 2 parts milk, 1 part cream and 1 part eggnog. I also did what many others did and reduced the eggs to 3. I used Texas Toast bread and it turned out super. The crust of the bread turns out little bit firmer and chewier which adds great texture and has great taste!! I will make this again. YUMMY!!"
"2","5","Excellent! I also reduced the eggs to 3 and found the texture and flavor to be perfect. Fast and easy."
"2","5","Big hit with the whole family."
"2","5","So easy and so delicious! My grandson said it tastes like french toast and I agree it sort of does. I had some French Vanilla Cool Whip and served it on top, mmmmmm good."
"2","5","This recipe is great. First time every making bread pudding. This is easy and delicious. I will be using it a lot. Thank you."
"2","5","My husband loves bread pudding, especially if it tastes just like his grandmother used to make. This one fit the bill. Very Good."
"2","5","Yummmmm....."
"2","5","Really easy--no water bath or scalded milk. I added some freshly ground nutmeg and served it with vanilla ice cream. I will make this again and again. Thanks so much for the recipe."
"2","5","I made this with a leftover loaf of challah- next time I'll increase the amount of the egg/ milk mixture because the bread soaked up so much. My husband suggested soaking it with bourbon- couldn't hurt!"
"2","5","My husband is a BIG bread pudding fan and he said this was the best he'd ever had. He poured a bit of honey on it but he pours honey on everything. If he liked it, I know it is a great recipe to keep. GOOD RECIPE!"
"2","5","This bread pudding was awesome! Was very simple to make, the kids loved it, and didn't need any kind of carmel sauce or anything for it."
"2","5","I am by no means a chef, and I decided to journey into the realm of bread puddings by following this recipe. It was very easy, very tasty and a hit to all that tried it. Kudos!"
"2","5","This was the first bread pudding recipe I've ever tried, and I adored it! It was so simple and delicious, even in the hands of an amateur cook such as myself. I would recommend it to anyone!"
"2","5","Everyone loved it. Very quick and easy and baked up just right - not too runny and not too dry."
"2","5","There's no point looking for another bread pudding recipe...the easiest and tastiest is this one here!"
"2","5","THIS WAS DEEELICIOUS!! I USED SOME LEFT OVER CINNAMON ROLLS AND CINNAMON RAISIN BREAD. I ALSO MADE A CARMEL SAUCE AND SERVED IT ALL WARM FOR EASTER BRUNCH. WHAT A HIT!! I WILL DEFINITELY SERVE THIS AGAIN. IT WAS YUMMY!!"
"2","3","This is really wonderful...my husband loves french toast and this is just like a big french toast. It was so good. I will definately make this again!! YUM!!!!"
"2","5","I think this recipe is just wonderful, I have been looking for just this recipe, for along time!"
"2","5","Great recipe. Have allergies to dairy products and substituted soy milk for milk and used fleischmans margarine and was still awesome, prefer 3 eggs instead of 4 as other reviewers suggested. Prefer to eat it cold the next day but doesn't usually last until then."
"2","4","This was the first time I made Bread Pudding. I thought it was a little on the sweet side and will decrease the sugar next time. Will probably make again."
"2","5","This is a very easy, tasty recipe. I recommend soaking the bread in the custard for 15 minutes before baking the pudding."
"2","5","Superb!! The kids demanded a second batch. Our oven just quit, so I made it in a crockpot. 2 hrs on high followed by 15 min. with the lid off turned just fine. Thanks for a great recipe."
"2","5","What a delightful recipe. Very easy and quick. I would recommend using one less egg. I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon. I highly recommend this. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","3","A little dry."
"2","5","This was very simple to make and everyone loved it. I did not have day-old bread, so used the bread I had and placed it on a cookie sheet in the oven at 250 degrees for about 10 minutes so that it would dry out a little. It turned out perfect. I also used half white and half multi-grain."
"2","5","ABSOLUTELY YUMMY.. ESPECIALLY WITH BRANDY HARD SAUCE"
"2","5","Great recipe. My family loves bread pudding, and this one was definately a hit."
"2","5","This is the bread pudding recipe I've been looking for my whole life. I top with a little butter and sprinkling of brown sugar."
"2","3","Too much cinnamon"
"2","5","My dad insists this is just like the bread pudding his grandma used to make!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious and very easy to make."
"2","5","This recipe is wonderful...comes very close to the one my mom use to make when I was little. After my mom passed away I searched through her recipes and was not able to find it. Now my children can enjoy the same kind of dessert I grew up with...Thank you!!!"
"2","5","I love this recipes. Even better than the ones that call for a water bath. Even my 4 and 2 year old love it. I like to make a brandy sauce to go with it. Sometimes I add a little orage peel just for zest."
"2","5","This was my first time making bread pudding. It turned out quite successfully - two of my housemates who had never had bread pudding loved it!  I did, however, make a few modifications. -added a pinch of nutmeg -1 tbsp brown sugar -2 finely diced apples (makes a crispier top) -sprinkled the top w/icing sugar before baking"
"1","5","OMG THIS IS SO GOOD!!!! I just tried this recipe today, and in 10 minutes more than half of it is already gone! I used a 9-inch square pan and white sliced bread. I loved it!"
"1","5","The best bread pudding recipe. Sometimes, I will add blueberries to it. Always delicious and simple to make. Everyone always loves it!"
"1","5","I like bread pudding very much but never thought about making this myself. I followed your recipe to the T (minus the vanilla, I didn't have any) and it was perfect. I drizzled mine with a can of sweetened milk....yummy! I will make this again. Thank you so much for sharing!"
"1","4","This is an awesome recipe. It's delicious, but I used 1/2 cup of sugar and instead of raisins, I used berries too. Chocolate sprinkles go really well with it too."
"1","5","Great as is, easy to make. Even better with Lemon Sauce drizzled over the top."
"1","5","What a great recipe. My mother loved it. I used a whole loaf of bread so I doubled the recipe. The raisins were a great addition."
"1","5","I have been craving bread pudding for a while and instead of going and buying the commercial one, I decided to try making it myself hoping to get a delicious, simple and quick recipe, and I have found it here. So 5 stars for being nice, simple and effective. It came out of the oven about 15 minutes ago. I just had a nice warm slice and it tastes great. Luckily I reduced the sugar to a little less than 1/2 cup but I still found it to be slightly too sweet but not that bad. I also added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and definitely getting that flavor there. Oh, and I reduced the milk to 1 cup because for 6 slices of bread I thought 2 cups would have made the bread pudding bread gravy. It still came out light and fluffy. I guess I have to wait and see if the result is still good when it gets cold. All in all , will try again and add my twists to it as I go along."
"1","5","Loved this!"
"1","5","Great recipe and moist! My husband doesn't like bread pudding or raisins. I changed it to use diced apples and diced canned peach slices, a tiny bit of cinnamon and brown sugar on top prior and then used only 1/2 c brown sugar instead of white. (I sometimes use a combo of the canned peach juice for almost a cup, add buttermilk for a bit and regular milk. Other times a combo of a half cup buttermilk and the rest 2% milk or half and half cream) It's nice! My husband actually eats this!"
"1","5","I made this using homemade sourdough bread and dried cherries. Instant hit with my family, who had never had bread pudding before!"
"1","5","To be honest, I do not care for bread pudding, that being said..I LOVE THIS RECIPE. Thank you EllenMarie. Mine looks just like the photo, and tastes amazing. I took the advice of others and used 8 slices of bread, and 3 eggs and doubled the rest of the recipe as written. 9x13 pan. Last night we had it for dessert using sugar free vanilla instant pudding for the topping. This morning, our breakfast of scrambled eggs, bread pudding with sugar free syrup, will be delightful. Never would have believed it."
"1","5","Fabulous recipe! I'm glad I read all the reviews first because six slices of bread would not have been enough. I used a baguette that had dried out in its paper bag and became as hard as a rock and let the pieces soak for a good while in the milk/egg mix. In the meantime, made a preparation of butter, brown sugar, slices of granny smith apples and chopped walnuts and put it all on the base of the dutch oven pan before placing the bread pudding recipe on top (I added a pinch of nutmeg to the recipe). Baked 45 minutes at 350. End result? Heaven. It's sooooooo good! And next time, will make sure to have whipping cream on hand so it can be served with that. I called this variation 'Upside Down Apple Bread Pudding'."
"1","5","Bread pudding is Even Better if you use leftover Home made Bread!! It has a completely different texture! Also, try using chopped (canned) peaches in place of the raisins. To die for? No; To Kill For!!"
"1","3","Taste very nice"
"1","5","Great recipe! I used my homemade cranberry walnut bread otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was light and fluffy. I topped it with a vanilla sauce which I found on this sight. We will definitely have this again. Thank you for sharing."
"1","5","I used this recipe to make bread pudding for the very first time, and it was incredible! I used day old cinnamon raisin bread from the grocery store bakery, and only 2/3 cup of sugar. The rest of the ingredients stayed the same. Big-time was 45 minutes, and it was not eggy like some of the other reviews."
"1","5","This recipe is perfect as is, but is easily adaptable."
"1","5","this was easy and delicious."
"1","5","I made this pudding today.. Wow it was really good. thank you for sharing."
"1","5","Just like my Mom used to make. Yum!"
"1","5","I made recipe for the first time tonight and it was also my first time making bread pudding ever, and it turned out great! I doubled the recipe and used almond milk and heaping teaspoons of cinnamon with a dash of nutmeg. I had a loaf of stale homemade bread that didn't rise properly and I hated to waste it so I chopped it up and in it went! I also used half white and brown sugar with a tiny sprinkle of brown sugar on top. This was tasty and will be a go to recipe from here on out when I have a craving for something sweet and hearty. My picky 4 year old enjoyed it and called it raisin pie!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe. I do use one less egg and find that this recipe is truly the best with french bread and not a cheap loaf of bread as others have suggested."
"1","3","This bread pudding was pretty good considering how easy it was to make. Patience is the key. I took my bread pudding out to early because it bounced back when I lightly tapped it. It was all watery on the inside. I recommend to wait the full 45 minutes and then check it with the tapping test rather than checking it early.  Also, you have to eat the bread pudding right when it comes out of the oven. It becomes disgusting if it has cooled down.  This recipe recommends milk as an addition to the bread pudding. I prefer maple syrup. It gives the pudding a sweet flavor. Overall, this pudding was extremely easy to make. The steps were simple and novice. The problems occur after you put the pudding in the oven. Just remember.... - be patient -eat it warm -add maple syrup if you have a sweet tooth!"
"1","5","This turned out really great! Unlike others, I didn't think it tasted good while it was hot, but once it had been in the fridge overnight… yum!"
"1","5","I didn't have any raisins & saw where another review used cinnamon swirl bread. I used the sunmaid Raisin-Cinnamon swirl bread & left out the raisins. I also substituted 1/3 of the milk with creme brulee coffee creamer. My family LOVED it!!!!"
"1","5","Sub'd slightly overripe blueberries for r aisons, bc that's what i had. Added a little salt just bc. Easy and delicious!"
"1","5","I make this all the time. I love it. I do leave out raisins..just not for me. Then I like to top it with a little caramel sauce. I did read one of the reviews where they topped with brown sugar and that sounds yummy too. I also never measure the exact bread and know I add more than called for."
"1","5","I just tried this recipe loved it... So simple and quick to make.... Perfect!!!!"
"1","5","I used French bread (which I've never used for bread pudding), and it was excellent, giving it a nice crunch here and there. I halved the recipe and used only 1 egg (saw that some were mentioning too eggy) and it worked fine. I also used non-dairy creamer in place of the milk, turbinado sugar, yellow raisins and a touch of nutmeg. Cooking times were spot on. Also made a rum sauce from this site for it, and it was so decadent. Thanks ELLENMARIE for a great recipe!"
"1","5","Loved this!! So easy and so good!"
"1","5","Great base to start from....I didn't use sliced bread, I had a baguette from Panera I needed to use up, but this gave me the starting point on ingredients and time. I love bread pudding for its versatility....start with the basics and make it your own!! This time I couldn't find my raisins (I have teenage boys putting away my groceries) so I used a package of orange flavored dried cranberries and almonds for salads I had on hand... added almond extract and switched up part of the sugar for dark brown(my newest addiction)......yum! Thanks for a great starting poi!!"
"1","5","Loved this. So easy. Didn't change a thing. Hadn't had this since I was a kid till I found this receipe. Brought back memories"
"1","5","love it as is!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe as written--was worried it would be too eggy (I am very sensitive to eggy bread pudding) but it turned out great. Family loved it--I was told to ' add it to our collection'. Big hit. I wanted a recipe that didn't need a water bath --this was fantastic and so easy."
"1","5","This recipe is very versatile. I used one cup of milk and one cup of egg nog and only half a cup of sugar. Since I used a whole loaf of French bread, I upped the butter to four table spoons. It was delicious!"
"1","5","Easy to make and absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","I just made this and OMG it's so deLicious! I topped it off with Whip Cream. Thank you for the recipe!"
"1","5","WoW!!!! Bread pudding is my favorite dessert and this recipe with the adjustment from another poster using pepperidge farm cinnamon bread and brown sugar was absolutely the best!!! Don't hesitate to make this recipe."
"1","5","I made this recipe today. I didn't use any tricks. It doesn't need it. The resident Queen of everything, thought it was so good , that I have now been promoted from court jester to head butler."
"1","5","My Family loved it...Walmart had Italian fresh baked bread on sale for $1 and that is what I used...Family dollar also has a dried berry mix (goldedn raisins, cherries, and cranberries) and I used that in addition to just plain raisins (I have made it with just raisins as well and it isn't much of a difference in taste"
"1","4","modifications: doubled recipe  used 5 bagels = 8+ cups used 10 eggs + 1/2 c pureed pumpkin + 1/2 C EGGNOG mixture of brown and coconut sugar instead of white sugar coconut oil instead of butter added 2 T chopped candied ginger added 1.5 t nutmeg + 1 t cardamon baked 25 minutes longer"
"1","5","This is a great recipe! Here are the slight changes I made: I only used 3 eggs. Since I'm not a big fan of raisins, I used cranberries instead and rather than pouring the mixture over the bread, I thoroughly mixed the bread into the mixture and then poured everything into the baking dish. DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks ELLENMARIE :)"
"1","5","Love it! I use 8 croissants and i add 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, bake for 45 mins & it's perfect for me, i think the extra bread makes it a little more firm. Also, i just baked one tonight and i did everything the same except i blended 2 bananas in the blender and added that to the milk mixture, tastes like banana bread :-)"
"1","5","I've made this recipe a few times now and it's always a hit. I have followed it using wheat bread, french bread, and whatever else I've had on hand. I have used 2%, whole milk, and heavy cream. I have included raisins, nuts, apples and pears on different occasions. I'm not the most accurate measurer so there's lots of wiggle room because I'm sure I haven't done the exact same thing twice. No matter what I've done everyone asks for the recipe. I do add a little nutmeg and sometimes mix brown sugar with white. I also sprinkle brown sugar on top. I mix everything one day and bake it the next. I think that may make a difference. Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"1","5","This is the first time that the bread pudding came out Great ! Instead of raisins I used chocolate chips and marshmallows and topped it with fresh made ice cream  It did seem a little sweet maybe a little less sugar"
"1","1","Turned out quite good!!"
"1","5","In the UK we call this Bread and Butter pudding. The only difference is that we butter each piece of bread and cut in triangles before arranging in the dish. Delish!!!"
"1","4","I love it!! I always toast my bread first with butter each side of course. Add a pinch of salt. My favorite is cheese bread pudding which I mix cubes of cheese into it, and when its ready, i eat it with condensed milk& shredded cheese! All cant go wrong with lot of cheese!"
"1","5","Best if served with corn syrup or honey."
"1","5","Tomorrow is my moms 50th birthday, so I had to do a little more than usual to surprise her. It just came out of the oven and it looks perfect! It was sooo easy to make, and I did it like snap. I am definitely saving the recipe!"
"1","5","I've been using this recipe for several years - but, like others add a special 'twist'. I have a bread machine, and make a loaf of 'Vanilla Sour Cream Bread', double the recipe, using the whole loaf. I'm not fond of raisins, but do add other fruit - usually chopped apples and cranberries. It freezes well, makes a wonderful breakfast, and is a hit with everyone that has tried it. I've also made it with peaches, I think it would be good with any favorite fruit, we just like the combination of apples and cranberries - especially since I have several apple trees, and usually have frozen or canned apples available."
"1","5","Easy and delicious! I used honey/oatmeal bread made from this site and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Served with vanilla ice cream! It was done perfectly in 45 minutes as the recipe states. I scaled down the size just a bit, using 3 eggs, 1 1/2c of milk and 4 thick slices of bread (I was only needing to serve 2 adults and 1 toddler)."
"1","4","Very good recipe, did not add raisins, otherwise made as written, with homemade hamburger rolls. Delicious!"
"1","5","Very good and easy! I used 2% milk because that is what I had on hand. I cut sugar to 1/2 cup. I made a simple caramel sauce to pour over. I think I could eat the whole pan :) oops--also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg."
"1","5","Used 3 eggs instead of 4 and added about a tablespoon and a half of cream cheese to the bread. Instead of raisins, 1/3 cup of dried cranberries and 1/3 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Turned out perfectly at 45 min. YUM."
"1","5","So good! I used stale french bread, and an end slice of 12 grain sandwich bread. The grain bread added some dimension visually as well as taste and texture. I left raisins out this time, but will add them next time, or I might try it with a raisin swirl bread of some sorts. I also added some brown sugar- tasted like french toast!"
"1","5","Great recipe but I have always toasted the bread first and then added butter to the toast and rubbed cinnamon on the toast and cut the toast into four squares and placed on the bottom of the dish ..added the rains on top and then all the other ingredients ...This is my mother's recipe...I. Also put the sugar on the toast ,just rubbed in with the cinnamon"
"1","5","This was great! I also added more bread to the recipe to soak up all of the mixture as other reviews had said it was too 'eggy'. I also added an easy touch to the end of the recipe. I just took some vanilla frosting and drizzled over the finished product. I did not have time to make a home made vanilla drizzle, but this worked just fine! Cannot wait to make again!"
"1","4","Tasty. I used 2 different types of leftover white buns and some multigrain bread that I pulled out of the freezer. I soaked the raisins in 1/4 cup of Amaretto until the raisins plumped up. Used half and half cream, Used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar (no white sugar), perhaps next time I'll a bit of maple syrup. Used 2 large and 2 small eggs. Doubled cinnamon and added nutmeg. Added chopped pecans. Let casserole stand for 30+ mins before baking to allow the liquids to absorb. For me, 1/2 cup of brown sugar is plenty since the 1/4 cup of Amaretto is sweet. Next time I will use 4 large eggs and some extra milk/cream since the mixed bread out of the freezer is pretty dry. Did not use melted butter on top since using half and half cream... One downfall was the top didn't brown and crisp up."
"1","5","The most inexpensive recipe EVER!!! And extremely easy to do! The only adjustment I made was the reduction of the sugar to taste. My suggestion is to refrigerate the pudding for a few hours, the result is to die for. Enjoyyyyyy"
"1","4","Really yummy recipe! I've never had bread pudding before, and I've definitely never made it, so I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out. I'm pleased with the result! I need to buy a new 8x8, so I increased the recipe by 50% to fit in an 11x8. I tried some after 50 minutes of cooking, and it was creamy and custardy (or soggy, depending on viewpoint) in the middle. I put it in for another 10 minutes, and it tasted much more cooked--quite a bit more eggy in the middle. I liked both ways, but for food safety purposes, a little longer is better for us. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a very sweet recipe--definitely good for dessert; not as awesome for breakfast. I see why so many people put apples on it; that would add some tartness for balance."
"1","5","A very easy recipe. This only took 10~15min to prepare. I didnt have raisins, so i used cramberries. But raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries also taste great in it. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1, and I sprinkled a little Pero Powder on top. 1/4 tsp of nutmeg also made a great compliment. This recipe came out great overall, and it made a great breakfast with scrambled eggs and a glass of milk:)"
"1","5","Very good. I didn't have milk, so I substituted a 14 oz can of coconut milk. My boyfriend and I ate the entire pan in one day. He had never had bread pudding before and he liked it. I thought it was yum. I used regular wheat bread and extra margarine. It was nicely buttery."
"1","5","This was the best bread pudding I have had in a long time. It had the right consistency. Had a nice crunchy outside and a tender inside. I made a Caramel Rum Sauce to go over it. I also served with slices of mango and blueberries, and a whipped cream. My family loved it!!!!"
"1","5","Versitile recipe. Sometimes I fond a sweet bread on the 'day old' shelf. This is a cost saver. I have used Coffee-Mate Italian Sweet Cream creamer to add another layer of flavor. this creamer also lessens egginess."
"1","5","Excellent recipe its a hit every time at hm and when Im  Invited to my friends home. I do add a extra on raisens Cinnamon & vanilla for added taste!"
"1","5","I cannot bake anything for nuts...but I did this and received feedback as awesome..thank you"
"1","5","What a dream of a dessert! I had this whipped up and in the oven in less than 10 minutes - is it the most decadent bread pudding I've ever eaten? No. But it's SO versatile and SO easy I simply had to give it 5 stars. Used homemade bread cut very thick (Texas toast style), 1 34 cups milk, 3 eggs as other suggested, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and about 1/8th cup of brown sugar which (for us) gave it the perfect sweetness. I also used the raisins (which I love) but I think next time I'll add in some peaches or berries. This is a recipe box must have for those spur of the moment guests. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"1","5","This recipe is awesome. I used half & half cream instead of milk, and also added about 1/2 cup of crushed pecans...will make again"
"1","5","I loved it. Check out my picture of it with strawberries added under Nick.fantozzi@gmail.com"
"1","5","soo good!"
"1","5","Made this pretty much according to the recipe except I doubled the recipe. I used a can of coconut milk and some almond milk as I do not drink regular cows milk. I added walnuts to the bread cubes. It was delicious. Thenks Ellen for a great recipe."
"1","5","I found this recipe three years ago and used it to start a Christmas tradition with my son. We didn't have a lot of money, so it was perfect! Stale bread, milk, eggs? I have all that! And, it was something an 18 month old could do. We make it every year now, and even my husband (who wasn't entirely sold on the dessert-as-breakfast sweetness) is now asking for it. The only changes I usually make are to add a little extra cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg. :) Thanks for such a fabulous recipe!"
"1","5","Very good, albeit I cut the sugar back some!  As most of the loaf bread that I bake is lean, whole-grain; I have taken to cooking extra waffles when the grand-kids are here to add them to the frozen bread scraps in the 'for bread pudding' container in the freezer.   IMHO, this pudding is best when about 1/4 waffles, 1/4 dark (not rye), and 1/2 whole-wheat, oat, multi-grain, etc.  FWIIW, I tend to make a dbl recipe & cook a 325* until internal temperature reaches 200* on an instant read thermometer."
"1","4","Yummmm! Great with maple syrup. Candied pecans would be a great touch"
"1","5","This is such a good, basic recipe. Great served hot with ice cream. I made it with whole wheat bread and it was delicious."
"1","5","I omitted the butter, added an extra egg, plus I used 8 pieces of bread instead of 6, and 2 1/2 cups milk. I substituted the vanilla for 1tsp orange extract & 1 tsp Grand Marier. Then I added 1/2 cup cocoa powder along with everything else in the recipe. I poured that over the bread and then sprinkled 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Wham! Orange chocolate bread pudding! It don't get any better! Loved loved loved it."
"1","5","This was very good.For variety I used chocolate milk"
"1","4","I would bake about 50 mins to an hr bc it was soggier in the middle than I would have liked."
"1","4","Good and easy. A bit too sweet, but that can be fixed."
"1","4","Made this with only one adjustment... I used half & half instead of milk. It came out very good!"
"1","4","I made this with a leftover baguette, and followed the suggestions of others to only use three eggs and 1/2 cup of sugar. I really loved how the bread on top crisped up, but the bread underneath was creamy and sweet, like a bread pudding should be. Delicious!"
"1","5","My family destroyed it before I even got dinner started! (Note to self - hide it next time) my only change was went half brown sugar for flavour. Thank you for this great recipe!"
"1","5","I made this and it was the best bread pudding i ever made"
"1","5","This recipe is easy, and extremely tasty. The crisped top really sends this dish over the top. The first attempt my wife made included the addition of nutmeg. It went really well. Thank you for this recipe. We will be using this recipe forever."
"1","5","I made this recipe today exactly like it was given except I didn't have any raisins, It was really good and so easy!! I will definitively make it again! Thank you for sharing :)"
"1","5","I have been making this for over 60 yrs but we sprinkle top with brown sugar for some crunch. I mix the milk with heavy cream or what ever I have ,It gets 5 star"
"1","5","Its delishhhhh !!!"
"1","5","I wanted to make this because the recipe is simple and had a lot of positive feedback. I read a couple of the reviews so I decided to follow some of the suggestions (used 9 bread slices instead of just 6 and used only 3 eggs). Someone also commented that it is too sweet and had too much cinnamon so I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white and cut the cinnamon down to 3/4 tsp. Also, I cut the crusts off the bread, cut the bread slices into triangles and layered them on the 8x8 pan. I also included the crusts on the sides since I wasn't using day-old/stale bread, I figured it wouldn't matter. The result was a nice, soft, moist, delicious pudding, not too eggy or custard-y. It is not too sweet due to the brown sugar substitution. The pudding can be served with a scoop of ice cream, creme Anglaise or even some maple syrup if you want to make it sweeter. I will definitely make this again, I'll probably try the recipe as is to compare the taste with this tweaked version."
"1","5","Never made bread pudding before and this was fast and easy. I used Splenda instead of sugar. Added craisins and a little orange zest. Yummy!"
"1","5","everytime I make this I use this as a base recipe. I add different things each time. bananas, chocolate chips, apples, molasses. .. whatever works :) I do add more bread though. 10-12"
"1","5","I love his recipe. My tip is to sprinkle coconut on top to add that crispy look! So yummy. I don't measure.......just sprinkle!"
"1","4","This is a great recipe. I made a few changes like 3 tbs of butter 1/4 of brown sugar and 1/2 cup sugar. I also used heavy whipping cream and to top it all off I made a mascarpone and salted Carmel drizzle to go on top"
"1","5","A local hamburger joint has delicious homemade rolls that are perfect for bread pudding. ( I think they are potato bread) to use 4 of their rolls-20 oz of bread- I adjusted recipe from 12 to 18, did 1/2 cup sugar in custard and poured 1/2 cup honey over bread cubes. I also like using pie spice instead of cinn."
"1","5","Very good. I wouldn't mess with the sugar unless you are using a very rich topping or bread with sugar already in it."
"1","5","I love this recipe just as it is. I also love that I can tweak it according to what I have laying around the pantry!"
"1","5","this was a great and easy recipe"
"1","5","Best recipe on this site! My changes...used one cup of milk and one cup of half & half. Also sprinkled some brown sugar on top for a little crunch. All the measurements were perfect for me. Can't wait to make this again. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","This recipe has great bones...it will work with whatever you have on hand. I had some leftover cranberry orange bread, eggnog, and chopped white chocolate. It was fabulous!"
"1","5","I absolutely love this version of bread pudding! So easy to make & no crazy ingredients needed. Everything is in the kitchen already. Big Plus there! I used a loaf of chocolate chip Panettone bread & it was divine! I almost ate the entire dish myself!"
"1","5","Need a quick, easy, inexpensive dessert? This one will do it. Topped mine with lemon curd. Another recipe worth keeping."
"1","5","Ok Guys...This really is an excellent dessert. I did listen to a few of the reviews and made my own changes. So here ya go:  1. Omitted Raisins 2. Used 8 slices of bread rather than 6 3. used a cup of half & half and a cup of whole milk 4. 2 Teaspoons of Vanilla 5. in addition to Cinnamon...1/4 teaspoon nutmeg  I didn't want to take the time to make the vanilla sauce, which looks great. So, I mixed half & half, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and enough powdered sugar to make it a thick glaze....it was delicious"
"1","5","I did everything wrong and it still came out great. I forgot to leave the bread out overnight (I used 6 slices of italian bread - the kind for sandwiches)so I lightly toasted it. I only had skim milk so I used that - I only used 3 eggs because someone said it tasted eggy with 4 and I forgot the raisins. I was shocked when I tasted it and it was delicious. Thank you so much for a great recipe."
"1","5","Great recipe! I did do some changes for some left over raisin bread. Skipped the sugar, raisins and cinnamon and substituted Baileys Caramel Creamer for the milk. Heaven in a bowl!"
"1","5","I used gluten free bread, traded dried cranberries for the raisins and used agave instead of sugar. Also almond extract vs vanilla. Awesome! Thanks Ellen."
"1","5","Made this with all our leftover ends, for some reason we have taken to sticking the ends of our loaves into a bag and saving them in the freezer... Could it be for bread pudding?... Anyway, we do not do white bread so the ends can be pretty grainy and of course are crusty. I've been trying different recipes and yay! I've finally found the keeper recipe! I doubled it and I found it needed to bake a bit longer. I did take a tip from a whole grain bread pudding recipe and put the cut up bread into a 325 degree oven for 7-10 minutes before hand then let it cool. I think this really knocked down the chew factor that has bothered me before. Have tried this adding in a couple peeled grated apples and really liked it that way."
"1","5","I loved this recipe, very easy and delicious!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe but substituted 'craisins' for the raisins and diced up a Gala apple with the bread. So delicious! May husband wants me to make more soon! Thanks for this great recipe."
"1","4","Yummy and easy recipe. I used a store baked cinnamon apple loaf bread which was a little dry. I did't change anything else. Hubby loved it and said this is the best dessert in a long time."
"1","4","I've been trying to find a recipe to match my old one, and finally succeeded! I used one less egg, and 3 whole bakery hoagie rolls. I mixed it all together in the bowl of liquid to get a fairly uniform bread mush, with just a little liquid left unsoaked, then poured it in the pan to bake. Perfect."
"1","5","Absolutely delicous. We have been looking for a good bread pudding recipe forever in the nursing home that I work in. Budget hours do not always allow alot of time for a long drawn out recipe to prepare. This one is easy, and taste is absolutely wonderful. Minimal steps. Only thing we do different is add some brown sugar to the top of it right after it comes out of the oven. Just sprinkle it over the top."
"1","5","I tried this recipe for the first time a few weeks ago. It's very easy to make and was a hit with the entire family. My husband said he never liked bread pudding before this one. Now he asks for it at least once a week."
"1","5","This is the best bread pudding ever! I have used this recipe 4 times over the past 2 weeks and now I double it because my family and I love it so much!"
"1","5","This recipe is a great base for bread pudding - and I read some reviews and experimented from there. Specifically, I used 1/2 C white sugar and then a bit more than 1/4 C brown sugar. I used 1/4 C raisins and 1/2 C cherry-flavored craisins, I ground some dried ginger into the milk mix, and I used 'Cinnamon Plus' which is a mixture of cinnamon, cloves, etc., to give the dish a bit more depth. I didn't measure the bread - I just threw it in the dish until it felt 'right' (whatever that is). Then I baked it for a full hour. AWESOME!"
"1","5","I used 8 slices of bread and cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup,3/4 cup of sugar was way too sweet,and with 8 slices of bread it soaks up all the liquid for a firmer pudding.I ate the whole pan in 2 days,there goes my diet"
"1","5","I tried this recipe with some homemade white bread that was getting a bit dry. I altered the recipe a little by cutting back the sugar to 1/2 cup, using 3 eggs instead of 4, and I added chopped walnuts and dried blueberries. I also improvised a vanilla sauce for a topping. I baked it in a 9X13 pan, but next time I will use the recommended pan size. I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes or so to keep it nice and moist, then I removed the foil to finish the baking and brown it up.  Wow, this was delicious! Everyone loved it, and the taste reminded me of a yummy, gooey cinnamon roll. I will make this again."
"1","5","Great recipe!. I make it mixing Challah and sandwich bread (both a few days old, and use half and half instead of milk. If you want to give it a New Orleans 'adult' twist, serve it with warm Whiskey sauce on top.(recipe from this site). Yummy!"
"1","5","First time that I made a bread pudding that turned out right! ONLY because of YOUR RECIPE!! 1 I substituted heavy whip cream...okay that was a bit outdated for milk. 2. My bread already had raisins in it. 3. I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. 4. Reduced the sugar to about 1/2 a cup. 5. I used 3 eggs instead of 4. For the finale I made a raspberry vodka sauce to top it off. A glass of milk and I was set!"
"1","5","It's so easy. I hv tried & everyone liked."
"1","5","So good!!! I used leftover hamburger and hot dog buns and substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. Delicious! Easy to make too. I took a bite while it was still warm, and though it was moist, it was yummy! After letting it sit in the warm pan for another 20min or so, it was just perfect. Can't wait to try it with croissants, wheat bread, and whatever bread is left around the house! Definite keeper!"
"1","5","Wonderful!"
"1","5","i tried this morning, and it's very good. i serve it with creme anglais.. very good!!"
"1","5","The bomb! So delicious warm or cold and no sauce needed! I cleaned out my freezer and used a smorgasboard of different breads--hot dog buns, white sandwich bread, whole wheat bread, french bread, a brioche roll (you get the idea). I tore them all into bite-sized pieces to fill a sheet cake sized pan. Doubled everything except the sugar, used about 3/4 c white sugar and a HEAPING 1/4+ c brown sugar. (Brown sugar has a richer, caramel-y flavor.) Added a couple tablespoons minced crystallized ginger and craisins. Substituted almond milk since we don't do dairy and oh my goodness, so delicious! I read a lot of people felt you needed to use half and half and none of us thought this needed any improvement, and really, why add the fat when it's not necessary? Took about 55 minutes to cook. This will be such a yummy breakfast for my son when school starts--a really nice change of pace. Nutrition content can be upped by using all whole wheat bread and adding in some oat bran and flaxseed meal. But for a summer breakfast or snack---perfection! You could easily play with this for variety...chocolate chips, perhaps some pumpkin puree mixed in w/the eggs and milk, different flavorings (Grand Marnier and orange zest come to mind), etc."
"1","5","We loved it. I altered it for my family ... Added more bread and 1 1/2 of the egg mixture, use whipping cream instead of milk and extra raisins cause we love them!!"
"1","5","Excellent! You may want to lift it up just a bit with 1 tsp. of cardamom.  God bless all."
"1","5","Just made this pudding. Used 1/2 sugar and left out raisins, didn't have any. It was great with vanilla ice cream. Judy K."
"1","5","Wow! I have never made bread pudding before and followed this recipe exactly. This is absolutely amazing! Per another reviewers suggestion, I topped it with a vanilla sauce found on this website. Out of this world!"
"1","5","Loved it! Didn't have raisins, so added some dried cherries and used a leftover cinnamon roll with the bread. My husband thought it was great!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe many times and it's perfect every time. Sometimes I use leftover hot dog or hamburger buns. I tried it with light brown sugar instead of white sugar last night and everyone loved it as much as the original recipe."
"1","1","I went directly by the directions. I've never had bread pudding nor have I made it before today. I'm not a novice so I started to spray the pan in prep of baking, but since the directions didn't state to do this nor did the video tip, I didn't. I thought since neither stated to do so, the butter I drizzled must be the reason. I had to blast it to get it out of the pan."
"1","5","I made this recipe using 2 cups blueberries and 2 Tablespoons vanilla extract. Delicious. I will make this again using different fresh or frozen fruit."
"1","1","This recipe should not even get one star. I tried it out and it was a mass of soaked bread floating in sickly sweet milk. It was a waste of ingredients. Especially the eggs, which I had just bought. I did not change the quantities"
"1","4","My husband asked if I could make some bread pudding. yea right, well I followed this recipe. I did use evaporated milk and lowered the sugar. Mine got pretty crusty though..don't know if I did something wrong. My husband is pretty hard to please...But it was just great he said. He had his with a little cool whip. Thanks for making it so easy to please. Will serve it at Easter to family."
"1","5","I just made this and it is great! I think next time I'll try some brown sugar, maybe 1/4 c. brown and 1/2 c. regular sugar."
"1","5","This was an awesome recipe and I would have loved to make it this way...but my family doesn't like raisins. So, we doubled the recipe, used a bit less sugar as stated in other comments, left out the raisins, used 1/2 the cinnamon and added about 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg...it was awesome!!!!!"
"1","5","I make this all of the time and it is the best! It's easy to use and easy to substitute if you don't like a particular taste."
"1","5","Excellent bread pudding, best one i have ever made"
"1","4","great recipe. i used chocolate chips instead of raisins and used half white sugar and half brown sugar - delicious"
"1","5","Very good! Tastes even better the next day!"
"1","5","Recipe was quick and easy to make and turned out great"
"1","5","I used 3/4 loaf of French bread that was several days old. I increased the melted butter just because I like butter. This was just wonderful. I loved how EASY it is. I think I will add just a pinch of salt next time to bring out the sweet. I thought the ratio of eggs and sugar were perfect. I did use half and half as some suggested for all of the milk. It was really, really good. They ate it all in one evening."
"1","4","Made the recipe with 3 eggs as most posters had mentioned and the two sugars. Made it in a bundt pan for more crispy parts.   It turned out really good."
"1","5","Made this (on the spur of the moment) for dinner Christmas Eve; YUM! Warm, sweet, cinnamony... If this isn't Christmas on a plate, I don't know what is!  We used a demi-loaf of French bread -- fresh, not day-old. My daughter did the assembling, and I think she left out the butter, but we didn't miss it at all. Also added a bit of freshly grated nutmeg, and sprinkled some pecan pieces on top. Used a 9x9 pan and checked it after 30 minutes; baked a total of 35 minutes.   It's quite tasty without any sauce, but topping it with a vanilla or Kahlua cream sauce knocks it into one of the best desserts ever!"
"1","5","EXCELLENT and supper simple! I didn't have raisins, so I used cranberries. Perfect! I can easily see using various fruits, dried, fresh or even preserves. Next time I might cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup if I want to make a syrup or hard sauce! My husband LOVED it!!!! I will make this again!"
"1","5","made this but with eggnog instead of milk and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon- also sprinkled spices over bread too before pouring mixture on. It was UNBELIEVABLY good! made it with the nursing home residents i work with and they went nuts over it. I also added 50% more on all ingredients and made it in a 9x12 pan. Didn't use the raisins, but i'm thinking of making it with dried cranberries sometime"
"1","5","I had 6 dozen left over hot dog buns from an event, so I went in search of a recipe to use them up. This was _perfect_. I made 3 batches of the bread pudding for the marching band students as a snack before a competition. It was a HUGE hit and they ask for it again and again. I made the recipe 100% as is and it is excellent. I have also used it as a base for many other combinations; a handful of blueberries, or chocolate chips."
"1","5","This will be my go-to bread pudding recipe from now on. It's easy, it's consistent, and it's heavenly, both in flavor and texture. I always use raisins because I love them (golden raisins are my favorites). My tweaks are very minor: I use large-ish cubes of sourdough baguette with the crusts cut off, and more bread than the recipe calls for (I eyeball it); I use half-and-half if I have it instead of milk; I double the cinnamon and vanilla because I like the intensity they bring; finally, and most importantly, I let the liquid soak into the bread for an hour or so before I bake it, and I cover it for the first 20 minutes or so. This is all me, but the recipe as is is just delightful."
"1","5","I just baked it for Sunday dessert for my family and I love every bite of it. The taste of cinnamon and the raisins together is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! gonna be a regular dessert at my house...yum yum yum"
"1","3","I was hoping for a bread pudding with more of a custard texture and found this recipe did not fit the bill. The children did not like it and I found it mediocre. Hubby on the other hand devoured most of the pan himself! My search for a custard like bread pudding continues..."
"1","5","Delicious! I left out one egg and used fat-free milk and light brown sugar and it came out great!! :)"
"1","5","IT WAS SOO YUMMYY!! i just made this for myself and my housemates and it was delicious. i added fresh berries in the pudding and nuts on top, i also baked it for 55 minutes.   A little tip: Dont add fruit or raisins on the top. i did and though they looked alright, the insides were all burnt.  SO add any fruit or raisin safely tucked inside the pudding. otherwise a brilliant recipe thankyou so much for sharing will be making this one again !!!"
"1","5","I doubled and made with loaf of hard french bread. Took a bit longer to cook, but yummy!"
"1","5","my mother made this -EASY and everyone loved it!"
"1","5","I used pumpkin bread instead of white bread. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnimon, I cut the sugar, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda. Drizzled a caramel sauce over the top after it came out of the oven and had cooled slightly."
"1","5","WONDERFUL. I used left-over cinnamon rolls. (The refrigerator kind that comes in a roll) Instead of 2 cups of milk I used 1 3/4 cups half and half and 1/4 cup spiced rum. I left out the raisins because my family doesn't like them, but personally I think they would have taken it to an even more delicious level."
"1","5","We don't even like bread pudding, but I had a lot of bread to get rid of. My family loved it. I used wheat bread, skim milk, and a little bit of mini chocolate chips in place of the raisins. I served it with frozen yogurt."
"1","5","THIS IS THE BEST BREAD PUDDING EVER! MY FAMILY LOVES IT AND I EVEN SERVE IT FOR GUESTS - THEY ALWAYS ASK FOR THE RECIPE...WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BREAD PUDDING COULD BE THIS GOOD?  I ADDED RAISINS AND DRIED CRANBERRIES - ABOUT 1/2 CUP IN TOTAL AND SUBSTITUTED WHITE WITH BROWN SUGAR - SAME QUANTITIES I ALSO USE RAISIN/CRANBERRY FOCACCIA BREAD - AND LET THE ENTIRE THING REST FOR BIT BEFORE I BAKE - MAKING SURE THAT THE EGG MIXTURE IS WELL ABSORBED IN THE BREAD - VERY YUMMY!"
"1","5","Easy and very good. I will make this one again."
"1","5","Delish. Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced eggs to 3, used bakery cinnamon raisin bread, pecans on top, coarsely chopped.  Whip heavy cream. Yum! Thank you."
"1","5","Great recipe. I tried it for the first time today but doubled the amount for my family. Added some condensed milk after it was baked and it was gone in 1/2 an hour."
"1","5","I used it as a 'french toast casserole' except I used several types of day old bread. Wow! This is the best bread pudding recipe I've used. Yields delectable results! I made several modifications based on the reviews I read -- used 3 eggs instead of 4, omitted the raisins, used brown sugar instead of the white sugar and used 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 heavy whipping cream! Delicious! Also, instead of the vanilla extract, I used Nielsen-Massey vanilla bean paste. Highly recommend this recipe. Your family/guests will thoroughly enjoy it!"
"1","5","So easy to make and delicious!! I used Amy's advice and substituted with the pepridge farm raisin bread and heavy cream. My family is hooked!"
"1","5","My MIL is dominican and I thought she made the best bread pudding ever...until.....this one!! lol My husband made one batch with Craisins instead of raisins. Oh...my....gosh!! Excellent! So good, in fact, we made another dish the next day (since the first one was gone in one night :-) ) but this time we used crushed walnuts for a bottom layer crust, shredded coconut, and vanilla flavored granola! Again, another WOW!! We did have my MIL taste the first batch and she was pretty impressed to say the least."
"1","5","good recipe for comfort good. bury the raisins if you don't they tend to burn on the top unless you cover"
"1","5","We just love this recipe, I make it at least once a month. It's a good way to use your stale bread."
"1","4","Good recipe, I think. I had never had bread pudding prior to this recipe; I have wanted to try forever, but I was disappointed. I do not like bread pudding, I think. But my family did...I doubled recipe for a 9x13, and it was completely eaten. It did take a couple of days, so I know it wasn't a favorite, but to be honest it must have been good. Thank you, ellenmarie, for the recipe. :)"
"1","5","Delicious. Doubled recipe for a 9x13 pan, used hald milk and half heavy cream. Dotted the top with butter."
"1","5","Excellent way to use up some stale French bread!! We even liked the leftovers cold for breakfast. Mmmm"
"1","5","My husband doesn't care for bread pudding, so I call this 'French toast casserole' and serve it for breakfast. I cut the sugar down by about half and drizzle the bread pudding with a little maple syrup."
"1","5","Great Recipe! it was ready in 30 minutes. and its so yummy! Can be cooled and eaten with ice cream!"
"1","5","really great recipe. i used 9 slices of bakery white bread with 2 1/2 cup of milk , pinch of nutmeg with 3 eggs. turned out great... will make this again."
"1","4","Really good recipe. Instead of regular milk I used coconut milk that you get in the half gallons."
"1","4","I used thick French toast bread. Half and half instead of milk. Really simple and well received by my friends at our monthly potluck."
"1","5","This is the most fantastic bread pudding recipe EVER! And believe me I've tried many! Try it with evaporated milk! Makes it even richer and smoother!"
"1","4","This is a tasty recipe. I used white and wheat breads, and made a bit more of the sauce for it. chilled and topped with whipped cream. Very good."
"1","5","this was the best bread pudding i ever had thanks for the recipe i will continue to make it....."
"1","4","I used this recipe but modified it a bit. I made homemade honey & sunflower seed bread last week. One loaf went stale so I was looking for a way to do something with it so it didn't go to waste.   I did not add the raisins since I already had sunflower seeds in my bread. Overall I wish I had added more cinnamon and brown sugar on top. But everyone loved how it turned out."
"1","5","This was my first time making bread pudding. This recipe is super easy to follow and the pudding turned out great. I customized it with some chopped walnuts and cranberries, and used turbinado instead of regular sugar. For the next go, am contemplating using agave nectar instead, and soy milk instead of regular."
"1","4","Made exactly as written; everyone thought it was too sweet. Next time, will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. Thank you for posting."
"1","5","This was delicious! I used a crostini and added 1/4 cup of heavy cream and some nutmeg. I also used a vanilla sauce recipe I got from this site. I took it to a potluck and it was a hit! Thanks!"
"1","5","What a delicious recipe, it's creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. I love making this with challah bread. You can also try with french bread. Awsome!"
"1","4","My bf loved it! I used day old cuban bread-that was hard as a rock, and goat's milk. It turned out moist, and just the right texture! I wish I could give it 4.5 stars (still didn't get me to liking the dish-so I'll keep searching for a good one). My bf thought it would be delicious served with bananas in caramel (foster). Just an idea-may try next time!"
"1","5","easiest bread pudding recipe EVER! This was my first time making bread pudding and it turned out GREAT! Even the family food skeptics came back for more :) Based on some of the reviews, I used half-and-half instead of the milk, brown sugar and white sugar, and a healthy dash of nutmeg, allspice, and ginger along w/ the cinnamon. With a little vanilla glaze it tasted like an eggy cinnamon roll - yummmm!"
"1","1","I did not care for this"
"1","1","Not my cup of tea..."
"1","5","Easy and YUMMY! I think I will leave the raisins out next time, just personal preference. Thanks for the recipe Ellenmarie!"
"1","5","This is a super recipe and can be modified easily to whatever bread or bread pudding. I think I used too much bread and ended up with a bread pudding that had little pudding. But the result was delicious and worth it even though it was not exactly what I was going for. It is so easy I plan to use it in its different modified forms to achieve either a more bread or bread pudding."
"1","5","awesome! Used day old french bread, doubled the recipe and added golden raisins! SO GOOD!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe!"
"1","5","This recipe is the simplest and my first attempt at bread pudding, and I don't even like bread pudding! This is now my family recipe. On its own I give it five stars for ease, taste, ingredients available in every kitchen etc. Thank you again Ellenmarie for an enduring and reliable recipe :-) even after all these years, which is what recipes are all about, isn't it?"
"1","5","By far the best bread pudding EVERRR! To take this recipe even farther out of this world, add some maple syrup to the milk mixture! I make this once a week, sometimes even twice."
"1","5","love your recipe, quick and easy to make. I like to drizzle maple syrup over the top when I remove it from the oven."
"1","5","I steamed some frozen mixed vegetables and used them in place of canned but other then that I followed the recipe and it was DELICIOUS plus so easy to make, so this one is definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","excellent"
"1","1","Is was way too soggy. And it tasted like french toast."
"1","5","Great recipe, I did change a couple things. I decreased the sugar, used Chalah bread and added a cut up Granny Smith. My husband is not a huge fan of desserts, but every time I make this he barely shares! Thanks for the dessert that he will actually eat!"
"1","4","I made this recipe 2 days ago and it was awesome. Today I made it again but this time I added cubed cooking apples. It was even better! I'm planning to add bananas to the next batch! Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe :)"
"1","4","Far too much cinnamon IMO! Next time I will reduce it by half or less. And if you are doubling the recipe, don't double the cinnamon. Just too strong and overpowering. But, I doubled the vanilla. I reduced the heat and baked the pudding at 300 degrees for a half hour longer than recommended. A lovely pudding overall."
"1","5","Doubled in a 9x13. Fantastic with Amaretto sauce and ice cream."
"1","5","Taste great!"
"1","5","Really good - easy too! I followed this recipe exactly, except I used slices of french bread (probably 10-12 pieces since they are small)"
"1","5","AWESOME recipe. I didn't have white sugar so I used light brown and I threw in a couple leftover glazed donuts just because they were sitting there. PERFECT and Oh so easy."
"1","5","I'm a Chef in an assisted living center for 177 residents. the response I got was outstanding. Everyone loved this bread pudding. I don't ever eat it but this was so good, I found myself eating it all day long"
"1","5","I thought this was fabulous and kicked it up with day-old french bread (included 2 pieces of white bread as well)...I mixed the raisins into the cut up bread to keep them moist and added only a few on top for decoration purposes...Hit at my house and great to serve for brunch!"
"1","5","Wow! This recipe is amazing! THANK YOU! Taste, texture, sweetness, all balanced perfectly. ONE COMPLAINT...not enough, I doubled the recipe. AWESOME!"
"1","5","Best bread pudding I have ever eat."
"1","5","This is the best bread pudding EVER!!!! Loved IT. It had all the elements one looks for.......Crispy, pudding, sweet..........the best."
"1","5","Yummy! Great recipe as written."
"1","5","Added a vanilla pod and some walnuts and as suggested by a previous reviewer, used older french bread :)"
"1","5","very good recipe - was concerned about it having a custard like texture but it did not come out that way. i would def cut down on the amount of sugar the next time. i changed it a bit by adding a few slices of whole wheat raisin bread and i used whole wheat bread and brown sugar. i also added allspice and nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. Yummy!!"
"1","5","Very Yummy!   I used Challah bread and 1/4 brown sugar in addition to the regular sugar. Added a little less milk and put the bread into foil or paper cupcake liners. Baked for approx 35 mins. I made a white topping that consists of 2c powder sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp butter, softened and 4 tbsp milk. Mix with hand mixer till blended thoroughly. Drizzle on top of warm pudding. I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It was like heaven. :)"
"1","5","Made this for Christmas Eve dinner, whole family loved it even those who thought they didn't like bread pudding. My brother said it is up there with my grandmother's cheesecake which is an huge compliment coming from him. I doubled the recipes in a 9x13 pyrex. I used a whole loaf of 'Greenlee's Best Cinnamon Bread' did not add raisins. I used only 3 eggs instead of 4. I also added 1/4 tsp. of almond extract and a dash of nutmeg. 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar."
"1","5","I love this stuff and its so easy! My boyfriend asks for it a lot. He likes it with warm maple syrup on top. And, I must admit, it's pretty good that way! By the way, I use Splenda instead of sugar, and we top it off with sugar free maple syrup - can't taste the difference! We'll be having this Christmas morning, along with cheesy scrambled eggs and hot coffee. Yumm"
"1","5","Wonderful bread pudding! Improvised a hot bourbon sauce to pour on top, and substituted walnuts for the raisins. Used sour dough bread as well! Unbelievable!"
"1","5","I made this with a 1lb loaf of bread from my bread machine, so I wasn't sure how the proportions would work. I doubled the liquid portion (using a 9x13) and while pouring, it looked like too much so I withheld some of the liquid. Turned out perfectly and I think next time, I will use all of the liquid to maybe give it more custard."
"1","5","I wanted to make something quick and easy. I used wheat bread, wheat english muffins (which I don't normally eat) and skim milk. I wasn't sure if I would eat it or not. It came out GREAT!! A huge hit in our house. I am going to try dried cranberries instead of raisins for the holidays. I would suggest letting the bread soak for a little while to make sure you don't have a thin egg layer on the bottom. Enjoy!"
"1","5","Wow, this was so good! I just made it tonight because I had a loaf of stale sourdough bread and I couldn't bear to keep looking at it. This recipe is great, and I added some cranberries I had in the fridge instead of raisins and only added three eggs instead of the four. What a nice, delicious surprise for dessert! Yummy -"
"1","5","This was awesome!! I realize after it was done that I forgot to add the butter, but you couldn't tell. I also added some chopped pecans to it. Turned out so good."
"1","5","This was soooooo good the nuts added a great flavor and change from the norm, thanks for the recipe"
"1","5","I made this bread pudding today! And it has turned out to be one of the best desserts ever! My mother quickly jot down the recipe in her cook book so she doesn't forget! I added grounded walnuts w the raisins as well. Great recipe! Thanks a bunch!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe, I added walnuts."
"1","5","Excellent altought without raisins."
"1","5","Tastes great and easy. I doubled it and used 1 1/4 cups of sugar (instead of 1 1/2) and it was still too sweet. I can't imagine how much sweeter it would've been with a vanilla sauce too. I used french bread and it was too mushy so next time maybe I'll try letting the bread dry out a little bit first. Will use this recipe again."
"1","5","This recipe is beyond delicious! I doubled the recipe and used wheat bread. After doubling, the recipe called for 2 tsp of vanilla. I split that and did 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp rum extract. Also, right before it was done, I sprinkled with brown sugar and turned on the broiler. It adds a delicious crunch! What an awesome recipe."
"1","5","Very Good! I subbed 1 cup of the milk with some cinnamon sugar cookie coffee creamer and it came out fantastic. Very nice flavor."
"1","5","This a great tasting and incredibly fast and easy recipe! I left out about 1/2 cup of milk and added some condensed milk, as per my boyfriends request. A few minutes after taking it out of the oven, I found my boyfriend (whom I guess thinks he's the next top chef) pouring more condensed milk all over the top. It was very decadent, but very delicious!"
"1","5","Very flexible recipe. I used this as a guide when making bread pudding last night. I used day old baguette ripped into small chunks, reduced the eggs to 3, reduced the sugar to 1 cup, increased the cinnamon and vanilla (easily doubled or tripled it!) and topped with very thin slices of apple. AMAZING."
"1","3","I made this recipe as it is written, and thought that while it was a good base, it could use a little tweaking. Firstly, it was a bit too sweet. Next time I plan to reduce the amount of sugar, but add more flavoring to the batter with spices. Then, instead of the raisins, making a topping (perhaps with cherries) that can be a little sweet and complement the bread."
"1","5","Simple yet effective way to use leftover bread. Love it."
"1","5","This turned out great! Loved it."
"1","5","Great, fantastic. The best basic Bread Pudding recipe!  I sometimes add grated apple to this for a bit of a change."
"1","3","Overall, I think this is a very good recipe and the flavor and texture were great, but I had to rate it down based on the overwhelming sweetness. It was so sweet, I ate three bites and couldn't continue, and no one I served it to finished their portion either. I will make it again and cut the sugar down to about 1/2 cup and hopefully that will bump this up to a 5 star recipe for me. As is, it's a 3."
"1","4","This is delicious and easy! I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I threw in some bananas that needed used as well. Soooo good! We had it for dessert and will have it for breakfast too."
"1","4","This was so EASY and YUMMY! I had never made bread pudding before, but remembered that my husband said he liked it after I had a bunch of sandwich crust left over from a party. This recipe looked easiest without scalded milk or water baths so I tried it. I had a taste hot out of the oven and couldn't believe how yummy it was! Mmm!"
"1","5","You can use cornbread instead for a cornbread pudding that's AMAZING. This recipe is so easy and simple, I LOVE IT!!"
"1","5","Yum, yum, yum! Wanting a slightly healthier version than the usual, I used whole wheat bread, and a can of evaporated fat-free milk with enough 1% milk added to equal 2 cups. Based on previous reviews, I added sliced almonds along with the raisins, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and made it brown sugar, used nutmeg instead of cinnamon and added some ground ginger. Soooo good!"
"1","5","I have been looking for a good bread pudding recipe because I have never made it but my mom always did. This is the best and likely the easiest. I made it by using dried cherries instead of raisins and adding one very thinly sliced macintosh apple. WHAT a FLAVOR!!!! It is delicious. So simple and so good. Who would think old bread could taste so wonderful!!!!"
"1","5","Have been searching for a good bread pudding and I think this is it. Used sandwich bread and after baking according to directions, turned oven off and left bread pudding in oven to continue baking. Was wonderful. Made rum sauce for the top."
"1","5","This is by far my favorite bread pudding recipe on this site. I think the secret is the melted butter over the bread rather than in the egg mixture. It always results in a lovely, almost caramelized top. I reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup and sometimes substitute the vanilla for rum. I have also added a mashed overripe banana to the egg mixture and reduced the egg by one and that worked well too. I usually use whole wheat bread, and often leftover heels, which works well with the more custardy texture that other reviewers have noticed. I can imagine that if you used really light white bread it might end up a bit soggy. A great versatile, fail safe bread pudding!"
"1","5","im not one to completely measure on things. but i used 4 eggs, 1 larger can of the cream of coconut(in the mixed alcohol drink section of grocery store bc its pre-sweetened and tastes sooo goood. and then about 1/4 cup skim milk, 3/4 cup mixed white and dark brown sugar, mini chocolate chips, some cocoa powder (not sure of exact measurement but i not too much or too little, about a tsp. of vanilla, about a tsp. of cinnamon and about a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice mix. plus i used about 4 slices of wonder white bread, about 4 wonder bread hamburger buns and 2 mini martins potato bread burger buns. about 2 tbsp melted butter, added across the top before baking a generous amount of finely chopped macadamia nuts, and drizzled some kahlua on top then baked for the same amount of time and temp. it came out FABULOUS!!!"
"1","5","Great easy recipe , used 2 cups of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of sweet condensed milk along with 1 1/2 cups of regular milk , added raisins and sundried cranberries. Topped with a little shreded coconut and brown sugar. Came out Excellent! Ylafarga"
"1","4","I have 5 in my family. Three people enjoyed it, and two thought it was okay. I wasn't a big fan."
"1","5","My family and friends loved it! I used French bread, egg substitute, and 1/2 heavy cream with 1/2 0.5% milk."
"1","5","absolute BEST!"
"1","5","First let me say that I love, love, love bread pudding. This recipe was awesome and gave me exactly what I was looking for. I read through the reviews before choosing this recipe and seen that some of the cooks said to add more bread and less egg....well I added 1 extra slice of bread and made 1 batch with 4 egg and 1 with 3...it was great both ways. Wonderful recipe and will now be a part of my collection."
"1","5","So easy, so delicious. I made ahead of time, then popped in oven once dinner was served. The house filled with amazing bread pudding aroma as we dined!"
"1","5","My family LOVES this recipe! So simple and so YUMMY! I never thought I'd like bread pudding because I always assumed all bread pudding was made with raisins and I honestly don't care for raisins! Now, after I have tried this recipe and substituted dried cranberries for the raisins this is one of my favorite 'go to' desserts! I have made this several times and always double it and make it in a 9x13 pan. I have tried it using 12 slices and using 14 slices and our family prefers the consistency and texture of it with 12 slices. I also use 6 eggs instead of the called for 8 eggs for a dbl. batch, like many reviews have suggested. I usually sprinkle some pecan pieces on top with the cranberries and serve this with the vanilla sauce recipe also from this site! It doesn't get any better than this!"
"1","5","I added some maple syrup since I didn't have any cinnamon and wanted some extra flavor. Yum! All I had was store-bought whole wheat bread, and it turned out great. Will definitely make again!"
"1","5","Now my go-to recipe for bread pudding."
"1","4","I would've given this 5 stars if I had followed the recipe exactly. I took the advice of others though and reduced the eggs to 3. I also used 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup milk and 1/4c brown sugar, 1/2cup white sugar. The taste of this is phenomenol. My first ever experience with bread pudding and it won't be my last :)"
"1","4","i replaced about 1/2 cup sugar with applesauce and it was delicious!"
"1","5","Delicious, I doubled the recipe using a 9x13 pyrex and used 3/4 granulated sugar and 3/4 brown sugar. Definitely a keeper."
"1","5","giving a 5 star rating, this was excellent bread pudding, followed recipe, didn't change a thing, amount of eggs, perfect, key to bread pudding is letting it rest, so the bread can soak up the liquid, good flavor, got thumbs up from mom, who is picky when it comes to bread pudding."
"1","5","this is an excellent recipe! I just did some adjustment by reducing the cinnamon, more milk, 3 tbs of butter and more breads, it was awesome! Sometimes i replace the raisins with dry dates cut into small pieces."
"1","5","I edited the recipe.  -I had loads and loads of stale bread (hotdog/hamburger buns) and old wheat bread. So I had to increase the recipe to 36 servings. -Instead of using a forth cup of butter, I used a half cup and two tablespoons. [increased] -I used two 12 oz cans of evaporated milk (by the advice of my grama). [decreased] -Two cups of sugar [decreased] -Two tablespoons of cinnamon [increased] -One tablespoon of nutmeg [added] -3 tablespoons of honey [added] --Cooked in a 9x13 glass pan and a small casserole dish for 45 minutes. Took it out of the oven and mixed it and returned it to oven for an extra 20 minutes. Voila! Perfect bread pudding."
"1","5","I never had bread pudding before this recipe, but wanted to use up some really good stale organic muffins and some miscellaneous bagels. I believe I ended up with a cinnamon raisin and a blueberry bagel and about 2 blueberry muffins. I only used three eggs and added a dash of nutmeg and a couple handfuls of wheat germ. I also squirted in about a tablespoon of clover honey into the batter and used half white sugar and half brown. I also threw in a handful of tiny wild blueberries to clean out my freezer. I whipped the egg, sweetners, milk, spices together with my standing kitchenaid mixer before pouring on top of the breads. Then I sprinkled brown sugar on top. I also baked it for about 55 minutes. It really turned out well! It is absolutely perfect!!! And since I used skim milk, blueberries, wheat germ, and omega-3 eggs, it's actually quite healthy too. I didnt use a sauce, as it was moist and sweet enough standing alone. I tried the recipe using chocolate chips, and even though I'm an avid chocoholic, the blueberries tasted far better. Great Recipe!!!!"
"1","5","I have made this recipie several times and each time it comes out great. It is a great way to use up the bread that has not been eaten. Most times we have lots of the end pieces and I try to put them on the bottom or the middle so they can get good and moist. For appearances I put the center pretty chinks on top. I have even used rolls and biscuits, mixed with sliced bread. Definetly a keeper!"
"1","4","I don't usually eat bread pudding but I decided to make it for my other half. I used 3 eggs, slightly beaten and the egg batter mixed with half n half milk seemed more than enough to cover bread. I also sliced pear paper thin and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top. I did not make any sauce for topping because my BF doesn't like whipping cream. All in all was a tasy bread pudding but without the topping. thanks for this recipe!"
"1","5","Quick, easy and VERY yummy!"
"1","5","Thank you so much! This was my first dessert, let alone bread pudding. I pulled it off perfectly. :)"
"1","5","loved it! I used enough bread cubes to fill a 13 x 9, used 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 tsp. nutmeg (thanks to Christie's suggestion). I served it with strawberries and whip cream. Yumm!"
"1","4","DEVINE !!!!"
"1","5","Great classic bread pudding! Minor changes: used heavy cream, croissant (needed to use from freezer), & did a white sugar/light brown sugar mixture."
"1","5","Fantastic! Made it exactly like the recipe says and it is wonderful! Thank you!"
"1","4","Good recipe, although I prefer my mom's & grandmother's. I found this to be very similar to a baked french toast."
"1","5","I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of the day old bread. Still added the cinnamon. Love this stuff!"
"1","5","I added extra cinnamon cause we like a lot of cinnamon. It turned out so well, very tasty."
"1","5","I've loved and wanted to try making bread pudding since I had my first taste at Pappadeaux's years ago. This bread pudding is fabulous! My husband and agree it tastes just like Pappadeaux's. I did like some other people and used 8 slices of Sunmaid cinnamon raisin bread and used 3 eggs instead of 4. I actually forgot about it while in the oven so it cooked about 10 min longer but it came out perfect. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for bread pudding..no need to try anything else. Now I just need to find the right bourbon sauce to go with it. Ice cream will do for now :-)"
"1","5","Simple and delicious! Thanks for the post."
"1","5","Made this bread pudding for the 1st time it was awesome. I had ran out of regular milk and only had evaporated milk on hand, so I subsituted that for the milk. I also added 2 packages of the vanilla jell-o singles. Outcome, we couldn't stop eating it. The recipe is great, I just tweaked it a bit, but it was good... ;)"
"1","5","So quick and easy! I never thought I liked bread pudding until last year and I had to see if I could duplicate it! This recipe was perfect! I have to have the raisins and think I might try some walnut pieces too next time. Thank you!"
"1","5","Make this DEE-LICIOUS bread pudding and sit back while the raves flow forth. I made this pudding with cinnamon swirl bread and even my guests from Korea and Taiwan wanted seconds + take-aways. I had doubled the recipe and still had no leftovers! Thank you, EllenMarie!"
"1","5","I made this twice this week. My family loved it. This was an old fashioned dessert."
"1","4","The whole family loved it, even the grouchy grandpa. The only change that I would make next time is to mix the raisins in with the bread rather than just on top! Definitely will make again! It was really quick and delicious!"
"1","5","Simply delicious!"
"1","4","love how easy the recipe is.Delicious. Didn't change anything since it was my 1st atempt. Next time, will add the rum sauce."
"1","5","Very good and very simple to prepare!"
"1","5","Really good! I did not add the raisins and added a little nutmeg. I also added a caramel sauce to it which was really good!"
"1","5","this is wonderful!!!! huge hit, serve with a warm bourbon sauce......."
"1","5","Absolutely fantastic. The batch I made (Doubled the recipe!) was gone in a day. The only thing I'm going to do different next time is maybe add more spices- it was slightly too bready for my taste and I could hardly taste the cinnamon. Otherwise it's some of the best bread pudding I've ever eaten."
"1","5","We loved it!! The kids too! They even wanted to eat it for breakfast!! I will use this again for sure!! Thank you so much EllenMarie!!!"
"1","5","I had two bags of very stale blueberry bagels and tried this recipe to avoid throwing them out. It was AWESOME! I followed the recipe but used two whole bagels and topped them with about 1/2 C frozen blueberries. Will definitely make this again and again!!!  Back for more. I made this again using old hot dog buns, cut into 3/4' chunks. Doubled the recipe and baked in 13x9 pan for about an hour. Fabulous!"
"1","5","This recipe was a big hit in my family! I used 8 slices of bread and I baked it for 1 hour. I topped it with a vanilla glaze frosting. Yummy!"
"1","5","This turned out great! I added raisins, so I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. I served with some warm custard. I wouldn't hesitate to make this for company!"
"1","5","I love it! It wasn't to sweet! Nice adult desert!"
"1","5","Fabulous! I used leftover Panettone bread from Christmas (Italian sweet bread with raisins and fruit pieces) equal to about 8 slices of bread. Didn't have to add any more fruit or raisins. Used 3 eggs instead of 4 and 1 cup of half & half and one cup of skim milk. !/3cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white (just because the bread is already sweet). Cooked it for 1 hr. I love it!"
"1","5","Thank you for this! It was a hit and my husband, who has much culinary expertise, told me if he had know that I could make bread pudding, he would be asking for it more often! I did use a combination of french bread and Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin Swirl bread. I also added the vanilla cream sauce from this site as another user suggested (YUM!) I did double the recipe (for our pot luck with our neighbors) which allowed me to cover a 9X11 pan. With 8 adults and 10 kids, there wasn't a bite left! The only thing I might try differently is to add rum somewhere in the recipe. Thank you for this! It was great and so easy to make!"
"1","5","Yummy! I used some old not so yummy multi-grain rolls in this and it turned out great. A very good way to not waste old bread."
"1","5","I love this recipe! I followed the directions exactly and it was awesome! I made it twice in one week!"
"1","5","great pudding. requires more bread than specified, but a very nice taste"
"1","5","I made this with Irish Creme and it was great!"
"1","5","If you substutute Pepperidge Fram cinnamon swirl bread for the plain bread it kicks it up a notch and a half. Mmmmmm."
"1","2","Made this and just did not like it. Flavor more resembled an eggy cinnamon toast crunch rather than bread pudding. Not sure whats missing but something surely is."
"1","5","Put some rum in it! Very good base recipe, customize to your taste. Loved it with Blueberries and rum."
"1","5","The flavor of this bread pudding was delicious! I served it with a bit of caramel ice cream topping...YUM! This was the first time I made it, so I only changed the quantity to fit the pan I was baking it in and had to adjust the baking time (I seem to need to do that with my oven all the time). I needed an additional 15 minutes to consider it done. I'm keeping this recipe! Thanks!"
"1","5","I used this recipe with cranberry orange bread from Thanksgiving- left out the raisins and used brown sugar instead. Sprinkled with chopped Pecans. It was excellent! I know it isn't really a fair rating since I made substantial changes, but it was a great recipe to start with."
"1","5","This is So Easy and My Favorite!!"
"1","5","loved this recipe. delicious and so easy. i used more bread than called for..... probably around 10 slices of plain old sandwich bread. it was a bit dried out and tough, but i didn't want to throw it out. i cut off the crust and didn't really measure the raisins....... but i know it was more than 1/2 c. i put too much and will measure next time:). i used golden raisins and i think that it would have been a bit bland without them. i will try adding walnuts next time. i think it would be a nice addition. but even without, i would make it again. great way to use up old bread."
"1","5","Fantastic. The entire pan was gone before I could blink! I used leftover rolls."
"1","5","Yes yes yes. This is an excellent recipe. I used 4 left over hamburger buns and 4 slices of grainy ww bread. Other mods per other reviewers: only 3 eggs, 1/4 c brown and 1/4 c white sugar, added a few shakes of ginger. Served warm with fresh whipped cream. Perfect. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","1 word: AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly. I was a little hesitant at first about my bread of choice because I only had sour dough on hand, but it was SO good! This is the best bread pudding I've ever had."
"1","5","OMG!! Soooo good. I used 3 cinnamon raisin bagels and soaked it for about an hour and a half stirring and smoshing occassionally. I also added raisins. My husband loved it, I loved it, and it was awesome the next day with warm milk at the bottom of the dish."
"1","5","Great recipe for my favorie comfor food...bread pudding. I like to soak the raisins in rum for about 30 minutes to let the flavor soak in. I've also used croissants in this. Wonderful!"
"1","5","This recipe was so quick and simple, with an easy clean up...and turned out GREAT! I'm about to have a second helping :) It's also a fun recipe to play with. I added a layer of sliced bananas on top of the bread, and sprinkled it with a little nutmeg. My fiance and I both really enjoyed it!"
"1","5","The beauty of the recipe (besides the taste) is that it's easy to make! I used fresh cheap white bread and it still turned out great (seven slices instead of six). I skipped the raisins, used 3 eggs, and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown."
"1","5","Excellent! my husband is Cuban so I added a caramel sauce to it, he loved it. Thank you Ellen."
"1","5","I changed this recipe a little, I used Pepperage Farms Brown sugar cinnamon bread and i used 1/4 C of dark brown sugar and 1/2 C of Granulated sugar. and no raisins. I also threw in a shake of Pumpkin Pie Spice. This was probably the best i have ever had!! It was so tasty i HIGHLY reccomend it to all to try!!"
"1","5","made with raison bread and I almost ate the whole thing myself very very good"
"1","5","I LOVE THIS BREAD PUDDING.I MAKE AN ORANGE SAUCE TO PUT ON TOP AFTER BAKING."
"1","5","This is absolutely delicious! I used cinnamon raisin bread instead and ommitted the extra raisins and cinnamon. I also used splenda instead of sugar but it turned out great! Thank you."
"1","5","If you are using this as a breakfast, I'd recommend cutting down on the sugar. The kids loved it, but WOW. Too sweet for breakfast! Delicious though!"
"1","5","I made this yesterday and this was awesome! After reading the reviews I picked up some of the tips which was (1) use half n half instead of milk (2) use Torbinado Brown sugar instead of white sugar, (3) added nutmeg. I also used an entire loaf of Pepperidge farm raisin cinnamon twirl with the edges cut off. I followed the recipe to the letter and this was a hit. I also used the Creme Anglaise sauce found here. I tell you this was sooo good that I was shocked. I'm not a cook at all and this was quick and easy to make. The next time I think I will try it with an egg bread or a french loaf."
"1","5","My first time ever making Bread Pudding! This was so so good and simple! I will be making this again!"
"1","5","This recipe is so quick and easy. I omitted the raisins (don't like them), and the dish still turned out wonderfully! Simple, thick, comforting, sweet... everything you need from bread pudding."
"1","5","Delicious, comforting, and so good. I topped off with homemade caramel sauce. A wonderful dish to make for the holidays or anytime it's cold outside!!"
"1","5","Pretty good, I omitted one egg and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Serve hot with caramel sauce and vanilla icecream....yumm!!"
"1","5","Super easy recipe! We like to use challah bread and heavy cream! AWESOME!!!"
"1","5","Delicious! AND super easy to make. It's a keeper. The only comment - I don't think it makes 12 servings - if so - they're very small servings - will leave you wanting more. Thanks for sharing this, though! Loved it!"
"1","4","Good, quick, and easy. I used three eggs and half a cup of sugar, but this recipe is a great starting point for embellishments - I will be making this again soon!"
"1","5","I've made several different recipes from here and this is my husband's favorite!! And it's so simple and easy!"
"1","5","This recipe is SO simple to make and can easily be adjusted to suite individual tastes. To amp up the nutrition & fiber I used week old whole wheat hot dog buns. To lower the sugar & calories I used 1/2 cup Turbinado sugar instead of 3/4 cup white sugar. I didn't have raisins so I used dried cranberries. The pudding is Fantastic!! The rich flavor of the Turbinado really enhances the whole wheat, and the tartness of the cranberries is a nice touch. Even with reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup the dish is plenty sweet, next time I'll try lowering the Tubinado to 1/3 cup."
"1","4","The only thing I would do different next time would be to add less vanilla (1/2 tsp.) when adding raisins because the raisins add a sweet flavor as well. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","Good recipe!! I did use more cinnamon and used half & half in place of the milk, this made it more custardy mmmmm....."
"1","4","A great and easy recipe. Because we don't like overly sweet desserts, I cut the sugar to 1/2 C. I also used Cinnamon Swirl Bread so I omitted the raisins and cut back the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. I let this sit for about an hour before baking so the egg mixture would be absorbed into the bread. Worked great - nice and creamy. Served it with a little Boston vanilla bean ice cream - yummy!"
"1","3","Fairly tasty! I added nutmeg, a dash of cloves and some slivered almonds."
"1","4","Too wet and mushy, but if you cover with foil and bake an extra 15 minutes it comes out perfect."
"1","5","I ran out of bread and one egg, so I subsidized some bread with rice crispies (funny choice, i know) and one of the eggs with some apple sauce. Delicious. I actually think that I will always use some applesauce, because it gives it a little bit more flavor. but I bet the recipe would be good as it is. thanks a lot!"
"1","5","Don't change a thing"
"1","5","I used leftover hotdog buns and heavy cream. Delicious!"
"1","4","Definitely a wonderful basic recipe--you can't go wrong with it. Easy to adapt to your own tastes. Thanks for a starting point!"
"1","5","This was an easy recipe. I added sweetened condensed milk to give it a little spin of my own. Oh and I used hotdog buns that were going to go bad. Using what is in the kitchen."
"1","5","Wow this was good and so easy! I upped the bread and kept everything else the same. Didn't use raisins because I don't like them. I used regular white bread (but it was GF). I made mine the night before and let it soak in the fridge all night. In the morning, I took it out and let it come up to room temp before baking. This really let the bread get good and soaked in the mixture before baking. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","This receipe was unbelieaveble. I loved every piece i had. it was so moist."
"1","4","made this for the first time and thought it came out great! I did alter the recipe a bit. Like others, I omitted the raisins, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup using 1/4c. brown sugar and 1/4c. white. I used 1 round kaiser roll and 4 slices of white bread, used two small fresh peaches cut into slices and arranged on top. before placing in oven, I sprinkled less than 1tsp. of sugar on top. for the other ingredients, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. consistency was good and not overly eggy. I gave it 4 stars because I think that this recipe is a good base to play around with other flavors ie.. extract flavors, liquors, etc.."
"1","5","Delicious and SO easy to make! Based on other reviews I used 1.5 cups milk, added nutmeg, and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar. I found this was sufficiently sweet, but I've definitely had much sweeter bread pudding and would have also enjoyed the full 3/4 cup. I did use wheat bread, though, so perhaps it just needed a little more sugar to hold up against the flavor of the wheat. I can't really comment on the amount of liquid being appropriate because I used homemade bread that was cut into four thick pieces, not store bought sliced bread. Although, this ratio seems to be a personal preference. Some like a lot of pudding, some like it a little on the drier side. Highly recommend! Simple dessert that is sure to please."
"1","4","My family loved this. Maybe a little eggy, but the flavor was good. One little change--I made it with Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread, which is always tasty :D"
"1","5","Absolutely great! I really dislike it when someone rates a recipe then go on to say how they changed it. Well - unfortunately this review will fall into that category because of what I had on hand. I had a loaf of Rasin Maid Cinnamon Swirl Raisin Bread in the freezer I wanted to use. I doubled the recipe so used one, 1 lb. loaf. Then based on reviews from others I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It was still plenty sweet. The rest of the recipe I left alone - I made the recommended allrecipes vanilla sauce to go with it - not good. Very runny and just not that tasty.Instead we had it with some whipped cream. I think next time I will make a rum sauce. The single recipe says it is for 12. I doubled the recipe and 8 of us left very little in the dish. I really love bread pudding and was apprehensive that this simple recipe could be a success. It was fantastic!"
"1","4","As most all reviews found this recipe to be exceptional, I would suggest altering it only if you found it too sweet or lacking that extra 'something'. I cut my sugar down to 3/4 c, including 1/4 cup brown sugar. (I planned to serve it with maple syrup - to go with the breakfast I was serving for 'dinner'.) I also added 1/4 t each, salt and baking powder. Adding the salt helped to round out the flavor and the baking powder allowed it to rise/expand so it wouldn't be so dense. I also cut back on the eggs to 3 (mainly as I needed enough for the omelets I was fixing for dinner!) The end result was very good, and will make it again, but I used wheat bread this time, and think it would be preferable with a white product - rolls, bread, etc."
"1","4","This recipe was great! I cut it down to 3 eggs and baked it a little longer to make sure it wasn't soupy and it was perfect! It did seem like there was a little bit too much sugar and I will probably cut it down to 1/2 cup next time. I will definitely make this again!"
"1","5","Wow. I just finished baking the bread pudding, I followed the recipe to a T except I added maraschino cherries instead of raisins. It was awesome."
"1","5","Wonderful recipe!!! I didn,t change a thing and my family loved it."
"1","3","This was okay but too thick and dry for me. I think it needs more milk and one less egg."
"1","5","Wow. Really good. I am not a big bread pudding fan, but this is great. I used stale bread that I had made a few days earlier and took another reader's suggestion and used some expiring heavy whipping cream. I used the four eggs and cut down the sugar slightly (to 2/3 cup--half white sugar, half brown). I also stirred in a few shakes of sea salt. Added the raisins. Will definitely make this again when I have bread to use up!"
"1","5","made exactly as directed and my family gobbled it up right away. A winner indeed!"
"1","5","I didn't change a thing. Amazing. Best I've ever had! My husband, who doesn't like bread pudding, couldn't get enough!"
"1","5","This came out wonderfully! I had leftover Irish soda bread which was very dry to begin with. I can see where using plain white bread might result in the pudding being too egg-y or custard-y, however with a drier bread it is perfect. Instead of guessing at 6 slices I just crumbled up the bread until it reasonably filled an 8x8 pan. I then followed the recipe as written, omitting the raisins as the bread already had raisins in it. It was not too egg-y at all, baked up beautifully and was perfect topped with the 'Hard Sauce for Cake' recipe from this site. My husband and small, rather picky children all loved it! Thank you!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe...it's so simple to make and taste great....I omitted the raisins since i don't like them and served it warm with vanilla ice cream...awesome"
"1","5","Made this recipe w/o any changes. I used a Sweet Italian Bread, doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and it was GREAT!!! So easy to prepare. I also cut the bread the night before and let it set until I made the recipe late the next morning. THANKS FOR SHARING!!"
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe. It tastes like a whole bunch of french toast stuck together. I only added 2/3 of a cup of sugar as I don't like things to be too sweet. I will definitely make it again."
"1","4","This recipe was so easy! I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of the white bread and used 3 eggs instead of 4. It turned out perfect...the cook time for my oven was about an hour and half to get it cooked all the way through. Yummy tho. Topped with homemade vanilla ice cream!"
"1","5","yummie folowed recipe came out perfect.will make again .thank you for sharing"
"1","5","Very good -- grandsons love it as did both hubby and myself."
"1","5","This is delicious! I add a little extra vanilla, and sprinkle cinnamon on top, but that's just to my taste. I made this for Christmas, and everyone has been asking me to make it almost every week since. This one is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","Made this using soy milk and doubled up the amount of raisins. Also used Tortano (potato bread) for another infused flavour."
"1","5","I made this with leftover semi hard pumkin muffins (from this site also) instead of bread. Absolutely yummy everyone loved it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
"1","4","I followed the directions and also added raisins which were optional. The only thing I did differently was add two extra slices of bread and 1cup of sugar (instead of 3/4 cup). Overall it tasted really really nice, but it was just a tad too mushy for my liking. Next time I will add a little bit of salt to the recipie, and either cut down on the liquid or add more bread to cut down on the mushiness."
"1","4","I cut 8 slices of white bread into small bite size. Other than hiding raisins in between bread pieces instead of sprinkling on top, I followed recipe to T. Also, I sprinkled some brown sugar on top of bread before baking. I got a beautifully puffed up pudding in the oven while baking and it tasted superb! I may try adding some apple slice or some thinly sliced bananas like others on my next adventure and the possibilities are endless!!"
"1","5","Delish. I love it every time I make it. :)"
"1","4","I loved the recipe. I used left over dinner rolls. I thought there was too much milk so I only used one cup of soy milk and 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar to cut out some of the calories. I also used cranberries, pecans, and pumpkin flavoring to give it a holiday flair. Made a great holiday brunch treat."
"1","5","This was my first attempt at a bread pudding. This was a nice easy recipe that turned out great."
"1","5","I have searched different bread pudding recipes from the internet, compared, and i found this is the one, because of the great rating from other users. This is my first try on baking bread pudding, and it turn out great! My friends like it. The thing i modify in the recipe is i reduced the white sugar into half cup, and also i only used 3 eggs instead of 4, coz i don't want to be too eggy. It turns out just nice for me, not too sweet. I didnt make any sauce topping, coz lazy...the pudding itself already taste yummy. Or u can top with condensed milk, also nice. Thx for the recipe, i will keep this!!!"
"1","4","what a GREAT quick rich dessert!! could imagine this for breakfast even with maple syrup over it. added a pinch of nutmeg and omitted the raisins. also used up some french bread 'innerds' that i had ripped out to make a sub sandwich that was hiding in the back of my freezer. will make this again!"
"1","5","I did this recipe, only I used DONUTS!!!! SOOO Good!!! YUM"
"1","5","This is my husband's favorite dish in my cooking repetoire. I have to make it for him at least once a month, and I usually use egg substitute, yogurt butter, Splenda and skim milk to make it a bit healthier for us. I'd recommend this recipe to ANYONE, regardless of cooking skill! :-D"
"1","5","VERY GOOD! Hubby loved it so thanks, ellenmarie, for a tasty dessert that is a breeze to make!"
"1","5","I had some cinnamon crasin bread that didn't rise so I chopped it in large chunks and made this pudding. I did add some half and half and used turbino sugar instead of white. WOW! Delicious! Thank you for posting! Easy too! I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","This bread pudding was very easy to throw together and delicious! What a great way to use old bread. I actually used a couple stale plain hamburger buns which worked great."
"1","4","I used 9 slices of white bread as per recommendations and kept the eggs as is. The first day it didn't seem dense enough in consistency but tasted perfect after left overnight. I agree that it would taste better without the edges of the bread but I left mine on b/c I didn't want to waste them. I used skim milk and it tasted great. I also used turbinado sugar instead of white. The cinnamon is key. Also be sure you press the bread down so it is all soaked but don't let the liquid puddle on top of the bread - it will taste eggy like that."
"1","3","it`s only good when I have a left over bread. I used whole wheat bread ,1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cp white sugar, 3 eggs, chopped pecans and 8 slices. I just I think it needs more cinnamon like more 1/2 tsb."
"1","5","either needs a couple more slices of bread or less milk. Only did three eggs and added nutmeg and cardamon"
"1","5","Since I discovered this recipe I've used it over and over again and it always turns out perfect! This morning I decided to add berries to it at the last minute, opened the oven and tossed them over the top 10 minutes into the baking. It turned out just as good!!!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!!! This was very very easy to make and came out perfect! I left out the raisins simply because I didnt have any on hand but definitely didnt miss them in the finished product. I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and added a bit of brown sugar in to the egg mixture! YUMMY! Will definitely make again and again!"
"1","4","I am only giving this 4 stars because it was a little to eggy in the middle. I used left over home made bread from my machine and thought that 7 pieces of that would be plenty to absorb the egg. Apparently, it wasn't! I also used a full tablespoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. We're huge cinnamon and vanilla fans so I also upped the vanilla to a full tablespoon! Lucky for me, I had a mixed bag of golden raisins, dried blueberries, and dried cranberries. I threw in 1/2c. of that and it was beautiful!! We ate around the middle and now, about 15 minutes after baking it, it's all gone! This a keeper for me! Next time I'll just use 3 eggs instead of 4! Super tasty, super quick, and a super good way of killing those cravings after dinner! YUM-O!!"
"1","5","I have to say this is one of the best recipes for bread pudding I have ever tasted! I follow the recipe exactly, using cheep store brand bread, I save up the ends of every loaf and freeze them until I have enough to make this recipe. The only thing I change is I add an extra dash or two of cinnamon as well as extra vanilla, but that is my personal taste. If I want to mix it up a little bit I make different variations using different dried fruits. Dried cranberries are one of my favorite add ins!"
"1","5","I just finished making 2 pans of this for breakfast. I didn't have any day old bread(or any bread at all haha) but we made a HUGE batch of belgium waffles yesterday, and I tore up those to use! It was so yummy, everyone, even the picky ones loved it. I will definitaly be making this again...Oh, and I used some almond extract mixed with vanilla, and it was so good! Added a nice flavor."
"1","5","Love super easy, super tasty recipes like this. I used three day old french bread...delicious!"
"1","5","This was excellent for my first run...real easy to make and not complicated. In addition to the cinnamon in the recipe, I also sprinkled cinnamon on top before cooking and added extra flavor to it. This in my family's opinion better served cold for all the flavors to merge together."
"1","5","My mom's favorite dessert. I followed this recipe and served it to her and she was ecstatic. She always asks me to make it for her on special occassions."
"1","5","AMAAAZING!! this was my first time making bread pudding and no one in my family has ever had it before but they loooved it! everyone cleaned their bowls and asked for seconds! it was sooo simple and easy...i used half heavy cream and half milk. i also used half dark brown sugar and half white sugar. I added a pinch of nutmeg and the whole thing tasted GREAT!!!"
"1","4","I didn't care for the buttery taste. I might mix it up with the egg/milk mixture instead of drizzling it on top. I added almonds with the raisins. My son loved it."
"1","5","So simple and so yummy. A nice warm treat of comfort thanks for sharing this one! I used some leftover hamburger and hot dog buns and it came out perfect."
"1","4","my first attempt at making bread pudding. used a whole [small] loaf of honey wheat bread, 1 cup of egg beaters [equivalent to 4 eggs], 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, and the rest as posted. the consistency was great, more solid than bread puddings i've had before, but it definitely wasn't very sweet. i'm glad someone said they put the vanilla sauce [from this site] on top of it because it wouldn't have been as good. that being said, i just ate half the pan by myself! :]"
"1","4","Really good! Left out the raisins and added extra spices. Also threw in another slice of bread and upped the milk by 2 tablespoons. Will make again."
"1","5","Delicious and easy. I used hamburger buns left over from a cookout."
"1","4","Pretty good - definitely add nutmeg if you like it, it made the flavor much better. A bit watery for my taste but a great way to use up a crusty loaf of french bread!"
"1","5","Excellent bread pudding, don't change a thing"
"1","3","Way too eggy, just add more bread."
"1","5","I used King's Hawaiian Bread. DElish!"
"1","5","What can I say! Very good as is! Thank you!"
"1","5","I have tried a few different bread pudding recipes and this is my favorite. It is very simple and has a richer flavor than some, which makes it taste like a fancier dessert, in my opinion. I am making it tomorrow using a batch of bread that got stuck in my bread machine and came out in pieces."
"1","5","Wonderful! I followed Christie's advice & used turbinado sugar. I also substituted half & half for 1 cup of the milk, and 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg & ginger for 1/2 of the cinnamon. It was fantastic!"
"1","4","It was a great recipe! I will make again"
"1","5","This recipe was wonderful and super easy to follow! It bakes up so beautifully too. I added a bit of almond extract (just a scant capful), black walnuts and craisins. Yummy! Even froze those three extra pieces (after all, other than a couple other small pieces, I ate the rest of the 8x8' pan!) individually for that day I come home and need a 'hit' of something good, sweet and a taste of home! Thanks for sharing this recipe. My mom (a Southern woman herself) actually asked ME for the recipe and said she has been looking for a good recipe. Thanks again!"
"1","5","So good! Followed exactly! ****UDATE**** I don't know if others have mentioned this, but I like to toast store-bought, pre-sliced bread in the pan in the oven after I have broken it up- that way it gets more of a 'day-old' texture, and then soaks up more of the egg-milk mixture :)"
"1","5","This bread pudding was sooooo yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful."
"1","5","I looove this recipe!! It's our family favorite!! Added some macadamia nuts, raisins and chocolate to make it extra delicious,but if you do that be sure and double the recipe cause it will be gone fast!"
"1","5","I love this simple yet great tasting recipe!"
"1","4","i used 8 slices of bread as 4 of my slices were from a small loaf. i 'buttered' the slices of bread instead of drizzling. i used 3 jumbo eggs as that was the the size we had on hand. i also used brown sugar instead of white. i poured the wet mixture over the bread pcs but i think in the future i will mix the bread pieces into the wet mixture and let it sit to soak. overall on the first try the recipe turned out pretty good. a good way to use up our left over bread. i'll be making this again!"
"1","5","WOW! This was awesome. My mom used to make Bread Pudding once in a while when I was young. I thought it was the best thing ever. This is every bit as good as hers. I did double the butter to 4 Tablespoons, used Egg Bread, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the egg mixture. Also, I topped it with a warm homemade Custard Sauce. Although my wife and girls aren't crazy about Bread Pudding, I don't mind making this and eating it all by myself. BTW, it's great cold for breakfast."
"1","3","this bread pudding recipe is ok. the first time i made it following the recipe exactly - there were too many eggs and very sweet. the second time i made it, i used less eggs, brown sugar and more bread. i also added some nutmeg. much better after adjustments."
"1","5","My husband is a big fan of bread pudding and I never made it before. This recipe was so easy and sooooo good! I used egg hotdog buns, all 8 of them and doubled the recipe- definitely needs the glaze frosting- big hit with my whole family."
"1","5","My family and I loved this incredibly easy and quick recipe! I made it exactly to the recipe, except I left out the raisins. Delicious and I liked the consistency. And I swear, the bread pudding was almost better the next day. I will most definitely make this recipe again!"
"1","5","Great Recipie. I used left over whole grain bread, skim milk and added dried apricots along with the raisins to make it a bit healthier. YUMMY!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe today. I did change a few things...I used Capt. John Derst dinner rolls, almond extract and added pecans along with raisins. And I also used a 9-in. pie pan. (It didn't take the entire 45 min. to bake...about 35 minutes.) It turned out beautifully and it was delicious! I'll be making this again and again. By the way, this is my first time ever making or eating bread pudding. :)"
"1","4","This just finished cooking literally a minute ago and the smell in the kitchen was so good, we couldn't wait to eat it- so we're standing over a hot pan eating it, trying not to burn our mouths lol.  It's really good, but I made some changes- used 12 lightly toasted slices of cinnamon swirl raisin bread, only 3 eggs, 1/2c milk and 1.5 cups flavored coffee mate (the caramel apple and cinnamon bun flavors), 1/4c white and 1/4c brown sugar, left out the vanilla and used a splash of rum extract and a dash of nutmeg.   The texture is great (not too soggy or dry), and it did puff and get nice and golden...I also sprinkled a bit of sugar on top before baking. I'm sure it would be great with ice cream or a sauce, but I don't think it'll last long enough to see."
"1","3","This was okay, but tasted more like a French Toast recipe than a bread pudding recipe. It was also a bit too sweet for my likings, but my daughter didn't think it was too sweet. Might make it again, but for a breakfast main or side dish."
"1","5","My husband who is picky rated this one a positive 5. He said it was the best bread pudding he has had. I did not change anything on this recipe. Thank you it was awesome!!!!"
"1","4","This was easy and good. Three eggs was fine. If you don't have the patience for 'day old' bread, toast it on 'extra light'."
"1","5","Wonderful and easy recipe. I was able to throw this together on Christmas morning in about 10 minutes. I will drizzle this with a powdered sugar glaze next time per my husbands request but it is great as is and was gone in no time."
"1","5","We loved this recipe I have made it 2 times in 2 days. I went with some of the others suggestions of using brown sugar instead of white. I also used 8 pieces of bread and cooked it for 50 minutes."
"1","5","Made this for the boyfriend and he said he'd rate it with 5 stars! Next time I'll try it with the lemon sauce!"
"1","5","I made this for my coworkers and it was a hit! Many of them said it was 'the best bread pudding I've EVER had'!"
"1","4","I made this tonite using egg bread. Like other reviewers, I used only 3 eggs and 1/2 cup sugar. It was plenty sweet for me. And even with 3 eggs, it was quite moist. This was so easy that I can totally see making this frequently. By the way, I used nonfat milk and it tasted great."
"1","5","everyone loved it."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe and very easy to prepare. Make sure to make more than you need because it tastes even better the next day."
"1","5","This was my first attempt and bread pudding and it turned out great!"
"1","5","I was a bit scared since it didn't look like the picture at all but tasty none the less."
"1","5","I altered this recipe some to fit my tastes and took a few hints from some of the reviewers recommendations. I used a whole loaf of home made Cinnamon Brioche bread, reduced the egg count to three whole eggs and one egg white, replaced the white sugar with brown, baked till almost done then sprinkled with craisins and golden raisins along with 4 extra tbs of butter. By adding extra bread I think it took down the sweetness a notch or two so after removing from the oven I drizzled an icing of 1/4 cup confectioners sugar 3 tbs heavy cream and a splash of vanilla. It turned out great!! BIG hit at Thanksgiving!"
"1","5","No left overs, I guess that says it all! The plus is how simple it is to make."
"1","5","I use this recipe all the time, except instead of raisens I use choc. chips. I get rave reviews"
"1","5","What a terrific recipe! I'd never tried bread pudding before, and this couldn't be easier, more economical, or yummier. I used 3 eggs simply because that's all I had on hand, threw in some chocolate chips and cherries, and it was to die for. I did let it sit overnight so the bread really soaked up the liquid; I was using heels of homemade wheat bread and didn't want the consistancy to be too coarse. You can throw in whatever nuts/fruits/candy you have on hand, you substitute flavored creamers for some of the milk, can top it with whipped cream, ice cream, sauces, yogurt -- the possibilities are endless. This one's going right to the front of my recipe book."
"1","5","Try adding white chocolate chips (for added sweetness) and dried cranberries (for tart). Perfect combination, and the bread pudding comes out warm, gooey, with a little tart...delicious. (About a handful of each)"
"1","3","Decent, but too eggy, and if you're planning on eating it with something else, like custard or ice cream, it's way too sweet. In future I would reduce the eggs to maybe 3, and the sugar to 1/2 cup or even less depending on whether you add raisins or not (because remember, they add their own sweetness)."
"1","5","this was great! i didn't use sugar i used honey and some maple syrup. almost used whole wheat breds...my family loved it! (even my 2 and 4 yr old!)"
"1","5","AWESOME!!!! Follwed it to the T and everyone LOVED it! THANK YOU!!"
"1","4","Used raisin cinnamon swirl bread, 3 eggs instead of 4, 1/4 white sugar, 1/4 brown sugar, and 2 cups table cream instead of milk. With those changes, this recipe would be a perfect 5. Thanks!"
"1","5","GREAT recipe. Thank you for sharing. I did make the recipe as written the first time and it was great. I would say to be safe I used my mixer to 'scramble' the eggs before adding to ingredients and you have to let the bread SOAK for at least 20 minutes to absorb the liquid. If you don't it will take longer to cook and won't rise. My second time I did do a few things different. I used real cream instead of milk, I tossed the cubes in butter. It took a bit more butter but worth it. I used cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. And I used regular white bread along with a loaf of cinnamon and raisin swirl bread. I tripled the recipe and shared everyone LOVED it. I did add raisins (soaked them first to plump) and served with a lemon sauce. Thank you so much for sharing this I had searched high and low for a good bread pudding recipe and finally!!! found one. I made sure to try as written first before I made my adjustments. I think it isn't fair to rate unless you try as written first. Thanks again!!! This is a keeper!!"
"1","5","This was good. I used Splenda and egg subsitute. Served for brunch. I don't think it would have been sweet enough to be a dessert as is though."
"1","3","This was my first time baking bread pudding and it turned out well, but certainly could be better if i had served it with vanilla ice cream."
"1","5","Oh. My. Word.  This is absolutely divine! I am a bread pudding lover, and while I usually only eat it at our local buffet place, I decided to take the plunge and try and make some myself.  It was surprisingly simple to make; the prep took no time at all!  I did have to make a couple of modifications, because I was out of a few key ingredients. I didn't have eggs, so I substituted with mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons per egg, or 3/4 cup for the entire recipe. I also realized I only had 1 cup of milk left, so I used that and 1 cup of coconut milk. I also added some brown sugar in addition to the white sugar because the coconut milk was unsweetened, and I just love the taste of brown sugar!  I used regular, slightly stale, white bread, and let it cook about 7 minutes longer.  I am WOWED! It's absolutely delicious, and blows our buffet place out of the water!!"
"1","5","Very good recipe! I used plain wheat bread while making this and it still turned out well. Next time I make it I plan on using a bread more suited for this recipe, though."
"1","3","Prepared as directed and it rose nicely and looked great (and poofy) just out of oven but then quickly fell flat. Husband (the bread pudding eater in the house) said it tasted 'ok' but he thought it should be higher/thicker. He remembers grandma's as being more deep dish (like what this looked like coming out of oven). So no, the recipe wasn't bad, just not what we are looking for. Very easy to mix and cooking time was exact."
"1","5","really, really good. i only made 1/2 the recipe and used stale hot dog buns...we all loved it and want more, so now i'm making this again."
"1","5","YUMMY! I used 8 slices of pepperidge farms cinnamon raisin bread, 2 C eggnog, rather than milk and sprinkled with nutmeg before baking. Turned out perfect. The flavor was wonderful! I served it with whipped cream. Next time I think I might try some kind of sauce with it. Lots of great sauce recipes on this sight. Vanilla, bourbon, wihskey...possibilities are endless. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","It was good - although I confess I've never had good bread pudding before so I really had nothing to compare this to.   I basically just wanted to use up my old oroweat oatnut bread, and so I used that bread and since I didn't have milk, I used 2 cups of nonfat plain yogurt instead. I also added about 2/3 C of crushed cereal to bulk up the recipe since I only had 5 pieces of bread.  Also, I only used 3 eggs  I cooked it for 2 hours in my crockpot on high as well.  It turned out well! No soupiness or anything, with a slight kick from the yogurt. not too sweet or anything at all."
"1","3","not decedant enough for my tastes"
"1","5","Wow, what an awesome way to use up old bread. Very very good."
"1","5","I had never made bread pudding before, so I wanted to try an easy recipe and went for this one. It was great, I made it for Easter and everyone loved it."
"1","4","I made it on Sunday and I'm still eating it. Still good! I added some frozen blackberries from last summer. I do think that you need to be aware of the type of bread you are using. I used 8 pieces of French Toast bread, and the bread was still swimming in the milk and egg. It took longer to cook than the recipe said. I would suggest having some extra bread on hand in case it is too soupy. However, it still tastes great even days afterwards. I will make this again."
"1","5","I had never had bread pudding before when my husband was craving it and told me his mom made it when he was a little boy. I made this and was pleasantly surprised to discover that I LOVE bread pudding!"
"1","5","Very good recipe. Simple, no water bath, and it converts to a much larger number of servings (I did 72 in a full sheet cake pan) without missing a beat. I used old hot dog buns and cinnamon raisin bagels instead of bread. Also I didn't have cinnamon handy, so instead substituted half allspice and half ground coriander which gave it a subtle twist. Definately making this again!"
"1","5","This came out moist and delicious. I used the recipe exactly except added 1/4 cup chocolate chips along w/ the raisins. After it baked, I topped it with a vanilla sauce: Heat up 1 cup milk, 1/4 sugar, 1 tblsp. cornstarch, 1 egg yolk, and a tsp. of vanilla. I also topped it with french vanilla ice cream. Yum!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious recipe. I made it yesterday and everyone loved it so today I'm making another pan of it. It appears that you can add a variety of yummy stuff according to your family's tastes. Yesterday I added blueberries and small diced banana pieces instead of raisins as I had none. Hubby bought some raisins to try that with little apple pieces today. I have a feeling that my family will be requesting this one alot. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","1","I only used 3 eggs after reading some of the reviews and instead of raisins, used currants. It wasn't too sweet that way. Topped w/ heavy whipped cream. Everyone loved it and had 2nds."
"1","5","Absolutely prefect. My husband can eat the whole dish in one sitting because 'its that good.' Is really to make and tastes delicious."
"1","5","I made this w/ a really hearty wheat bread so I thought it was a little lacking in sweetness but all my guests loved it! I served it w/ FF cool whip which I thought was yummy!"
"1","5","i made this for a friend's birthday. i've never had bread pudding before, but she said it was great. for not having any comparisons, i thought it was wonderful. i did take the suggestion and made it with 3 eggs instead of 4. i think 4 would make it too eggy. delicious recipe, can't wait to make it again!"
"1","5","Yes, it is good. Had whipped cream and homemade applesauce with it."
"1","5","I made this for my British friend and she loved it!"
"1","5","Yowza! This recipe is so awesome! I made this last night and think that this is THE best bread pudding that I have ever had... and my fiance agrees! I made it with 8 slices of cinnamon raisin bread from the grocery store because the 6 slices seemed too thin. Since I bought the bread the same day, I just put the bread on my cooling rack for about 2 hours; this worked out great! I also made a pecan prailine sauce to add on top. I think that the prailines really made the sauce! DELICIOUS!!! I can't wait to make this for the rest of my family."
"1","4","I thought this was very good and quite easy to make. I used a combination of one cinnamon raisin bagel and six slices of buttermilk wheat bread. My husband doesn't like raisins (and I love them), so I just sprinkled raisins over half the bread."
"1","5","A perfect use for left over stale bread. I followed the recipe and didn't find that it was too 'eggy' My husband, who doesn't eat dessert, ate most of it! Definitely a good sign."
"1","4","This recipe is really good. It gets better everytime I make it. It comes out moist and my kids love it. I also make a vanilla sauce to go over it which enhances the flavor even more."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! Very forgiving too. I used a 6 day old loaf of french bread and eyeballed the amount of bread/egg mixture to use since I was using an odd shaped small caserole dish and smaller amount of bread than the recipe called for. I used about half the egg mixture. I also added a teaspoon of salt. I set my timer for 45 mins and checked the internal temp (which was 177 - perfect for custards) and pulled it out of the oven. Tasted fabulous! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"1","4","Dan's Recipe ... Top with cream cheese frosting."
"1","5","This recipe is really easy and the pudding tastes so good. Next time, I'll put in nuts and chocolate chips instead of raisins. Thanks for sharing a simple but great recipe."
"1","4","This was good bread pudding. I used fresh cranberries instead of raisins and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar."
"1","4","This was very yummy! My husband loved the texture and ate all of it!! i think it needed some kinda vanilla rum sauce as a topper but it was the best i hve ever made."
"1","5","My Picky spouse even loved this! This is AWESOME!! You don't even need to buy the expensive fancy bread to make this one taste good, I just used what I had at the time which was store brand white leftover from Thanksgiving, and it was great! I didn't add any raisins though, which I will next time. Still was wonderful though."
"1","5","I am not much of a dessert maker but, I made this for Thanksgiving for our family gathering of 30. I made a batch for 48 and there was only enough left to divide up into small bowls for them to take home! I made it exactly to the directions and they went crazy over it! Thank You, Darwin"
"1","5","This was amazing. I did the three eggs but next time I'm going for the four egger. I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a scoop of homemade whipped cream, and I doused it with a thin caramel sauce. It was really really good. It's a keeper recipe!  -Janene"
"1","5","Soooo good, can eat it everyday."
"1","4","Definitely a great starter recipe! I think the next time I make it, I will add different “goodies” and maybe some type of hard sauce to go along with it. Thank, Ellen!"
"1","5","This is a tried and true recipe. Whenever I have some leftover bread, I make this simple bread pudding! I love it and so does my family. I omit the melted butter though. And on occasion I'll add thinly sliced apples or dried cranberries. It's very versatile!"
"1","4","This recipe rocked!! I used 7 pieces of bread instead of 6 and I made a warm vanilla sauce to put over the individual cut pieces. My boys LOVED it!!!"
"1","3","Just ok. As previously noted it was bread pudding....."
"1","5","Very delicious!!! My family loved it. This one is a winner, it will go into my recipe colection!"
"1","5","I used 7 slices of lightly toasted bread, and I cut down just a little on the milk. This recipe is awfully moist, but pretty good. I added more cinnamon and vanilla as well. I recommend not pouring in enough liquid to cover the bread almost entirely; rather, I squished down the bread the second time I made it. But also, I found that I just like the top parts kind of crunchy. This is very much like an oven-baked, soft French toast. :)"
"1","5","Delicious! Like other reviewers, I used just 3 eggs. I also added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and used all brown sugar. It was rich and delicious - perfect comfort food and a great way to use up old bread. I found that it took a little longer in the oven than the recipe suggested (10 mins extra). Thanks for this awesome recipe - easy and impressive!"
"1","5","Very good and easy too. Tastes like my mothers recipe. I used whole milk to make it nice and creamy. I also let the milk soak into the bread for a half hour before baking. Will definately keep this in my recipe box."
"1","5","very very easy to make and so good"
"1","5","Love it, didn't have raisens used chocolate chips- delish."
"1","4","This is a very good recipe. I will make this again. The baking time was too short though. I had to double the time. It came out wonderful & tasty."
"1","5","I have never liked bread pudding but my in-laws were coming for the weekend and Iwanted somthing for dessert that was easy. They werent sure at first and tasted it carefully. There were just a little leftovers which Isaved for the evening. Thanks alot!"
"1","4","I really don't have anything to compare this to since I've not made Bread Pudding before, but I really liked it. My husband even went back for a second helping.  I was just looking for some way to use some leftover bread I had in the frig. This worked great! Used wheat bread with no raisens."
"1","5","Great, added fresh chopped pears and one more slice of bread with great results."
"1","5","I'm going to have to agree with the majority of the folks out there who think this is an amazing recipe... It clearly is not only easy, but absolutely delicious. I make it for my father as a treat and he eats in in two sittings! Thanks much, Ellen!"
"1","4","This was one great pudding cake. Make sure to put rum sauce on it."
"1","5","This was a realy simple, mild desert. My 8y/o daughter chose it over chocolate cake! Added blueberrys, and a bit more liquid because the french loaf I used was crazy dry."
"1","5","delish lasted a day and a half. I added a chopped apple, used 1 cup heavy whippping cream and 1/2 cup brown sugar."
"1","5","This turned out awesome!!!"
"1","5","What a great way to use leftover french bread. I also used brown sugar in lieu of white and omitted the raisins. Yum-Yum."
"1","5","Followed some reviewers and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and used 3 eggs instead of 4. I ate a huge piece right out of the oven.Definitely a 5 star recipe!"
"1","5","I have used this recipe several times and it's perfect every time! The only difference is I use day old donuts and it has been a hit! I have added sliced apples, cranberries and even chocolate not matter how I change it, it still is awesome!!!"
"1","4","This was delicious! I used about 2/3rds of a stale french bread loaf, added 2T coconut creme flavored coffee creamer, flaked coconut and brown sugar in place of the white. Baked in a water bath for 45 min. and it was perfect!"
"1","5","I've made this bread pudding many times, and my husband and I love it! My husband doesn't like raisins, so I don't put them in. It's a great recipe, because it can easily be modified and still tastes great. I've used hamburger buns, brown sugar, or only three eggs, and it still tastes wonderful."
"1","5","I may not appreciate bread pudding but I made it for a good friend. She enjoyed it thoroughly and so did her husband and maid. Great recipe! Cheers!"
"1","4","Well, firstly I used challah bread for this bread pudding (a recipe from this site). I half-ed the recipe since it's only me eating it. A little too much liquid from that though even after baking for 45 mins it was still too gooey for me. But I stuck it in the fridge and the day after its perfect when warmed up. Next time, I will probably use less sugar (especially since the challah is sweet on it's own) and let the bread soak before putting it in the oven. I soaked it only for 10 mins. All in all, I enjoyed this recipe. It would be excellent with French Vanilla ice cream! Also, following the instructions on the site, I used less of an egg, more cinnamon and more vanilla. Thanks for the perfect cold-weather dessert!"
"1","5","I made this twice in the past two weeks. GREAT recipe, everyone loved it!"
"1","5","I was looking for a way to use up a baguette of French bread and this was perfect! Very quick and easy to make. I followed the suggestions to use brown sugar as well, and topped it with some whipping cream mixed with powdered sugar."
"1","5","I will be making this again and again! I didn't have day-old bread handy, so I used 3 butter croissants that I had in the fridge. This worked out perfectly and saved me from having to drizzle butter over it. I took the recommendations from others and used 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I made this last night for dessert, and we had it time morning with coffee. It was good cold, but even better heated for 10 seconds. My husband has never had bread pudding before and was hesitant to try it, but he loved it! Easy and delicious! Next time, I will try to use 1.5 cups milk and 1/2 cup half and half. 2 cups of low-fat milk (what we normally have) made the pudding a little more running than I'd prefer, but it dried up by the morning."
"1","5","Delicious--could not believe how easy it was to put together. An impressive dessert. I will be making it again and again."
"1","5","Super easy and delicious! I love it when I don't even have to buy any ingredients to make a recipe!"
"1","4","This is a really good recipe, I also served it with the vanilla sauce and half and half."
"1","5","This recipe is so easy and yummy. Next time I will grease the pan first. Definitely add raisins! I used golden raisins and they kind of 'plumped up' and tasted delicious."
"1","5","Delicious, and so easy! I used day-old French bread torn into small pieces. As others suggested, I cut the number of eggs down to 3, but left everything else the same. A perfect treat for a cold night!"
"1","4","This was a very good recipe. I used the new pillsbury french loaf bread (in freezer section) and it was so rich. I ate mine warm with french vanilla ice cream on top with caramel drizzled over it."
"1","5","Perfect for a winter day!  We were snowed in for Valentine's Day and made heart-shaped sandwiches for lunch . . . I used the leftover bread and crusts to make this bread pudding.  Because I wanted to use the crusts, I weighed six sliced of bread and used an equal amount of crusts (about 10 oz.) The bread was Trader Joe's white 100% whole wheat bread. I changed nothing else about the recipe - other than using golden raisins instead of black because that is what I had.  It was perfect!"
"1","5","I made this last night for the first time and my family insisted I make it again tonight. I used a vanilla sauce recipe from this site also. It was better than our favorite restaurant bread pudding and, also, better than my mother-in-law's (God rest her soul). I have a feeling I'll be making this for a very long time and often...Thanks!"
"1","5","As per other reviewers, I only used three eggs and it turned out gloriously. Perfect comfort food! Thanks for a great , easy recipe."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious. I made it with 1 cup skim milk & 1 cup fat free evaporated milk, and used egg substitute and splenda for baking. Served it with breakfast and it was gone quickly. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","I made this for my sister, Christmas Dinner because she loves bread pudding. She said it was awsome the best she ever had. Everyone eles liked it too what they got of it, she took it home."
"1","5","I LOVE bread pudding and have tried so many recipes, but nothing came close to the one sold in cafes. Until I found this recipe!  I didn't have enough milk, so I used 250 ml of whipping cream, which made it even yummier ;D  150 gr of sugar is too much for me, so I used around 80-90 gr.  This one is definitely a keeper and I'm going to bake it again. Thanks a lot Ellen for sharing this fabulous recipe!"
"1","5","This is a fabulous, easy and rewarding recipe. I have not altered it in any way and am very happy with the results every time."
"1","5","Loved this recipe! The cinnamon is a must along with the raisins. My pudding did take longer to bake but I think that was because my oven is slow. I took this dessert to lunch at a friends house and it was a big hit. Thank you for posting it."
"1","5","This recipe was great, a perfect accompaniment to a great comfort cooked meal. The raisins are an absolute must. It looked like a lot, but was just right. Even the leftovers were very comforting."
"1","5","Made it with Challa bread I made myself, added a lot of nutmeg and didn't use all the suger in the recipe. It came out great. As all bread puddings, a good custard would make it perferct."
"1","5","I MADE IT ABIT DIFFERENT I USED CINNAMON / RAISIN BREAD AND ADDED A BIT OF RUM EXTRACT. I SERVIED IT WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM.  MY FAMILY LOVED IT, BUT MY BIGGEST SURPRISED WAS THAT A VERY DEAR 80 YR OLD FRIEND JUST LOVED IT."
"1","3","Nice recipe, although I have had better bread puddings before. A little too gooey."
"1","4","Very good, though perhaps i should have added more cinnamon - i doubled the recipe and sort of eyeballed the cinnamon. i used 3 cups of milk and one large can sweetened condensed milk, and 6 eggs, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. got rave reviews. thanks so much!"
"1","5","This is the first time I made this recipe and thought it was wonderfull Very tasty and moist,will be making it again,soon..............."
"1","5","wow! i have never had bread pudding before but i wanted to do something with my leftover challah pieces. I took it out of the oven about 10 minutes ago and I've already eaten half! I made it in a small round aluminum pan (no cleanup!) and sprinkled brown sugar on top (yum!). I also cut out one egg as the reviews suggested. Thank you so much! I will definitely be making this again."
"1","5","Came out perfect as directed and was a big hit at work, thanks!!"
"1","5","I made it like it says...but, I used Hawaiian bread...man, it rocks !! It's my new favorite recipe !!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Great comfort food. I doubled it so I can have it for breakfast for a few days as well. I used half raisins and half craisins. And sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking, but other than that I followed recipe. I just used maple syrup to top it, just like my nana used to. Best comfort food ever."
"1","5","My girl friend from college came to visit from NY and mentioned her favorite thing in the world is bread pudding (and is quite picky with her bread pudding). I had never made bread pudding before and was quite worried about it, but this was extremely easy and came out extraordinary. Best of all, my bestfriend loved it! I added brown sugar on top, which gave it a great touch!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe. I hate raisins so i used choc. chips instead. I also used italian bread and a few slices of wheat for some color. It is now one of our favorite desserts."
"1","5","very good!"
"1","5","This was the first time I have ever made and never really cared much for other bread pudding I have tried in the past. This recipe rocks. I love it and so did everyone else. I never realized that bread pudding could be so good. I also had all of the ingredients ready on hand."
"1","5","very easy- i made it with a loaf of banana bread that stuck to the pan. the whole household loved it and they are asking when i am going to make it again!"
"1","5","YUM!! I made this using the Challah bread recipe from this site! I followed the advice of some others and sprinkled it with brown sugar before baking! My family loved it, not one complaint! It's my husband's new favorite dessert! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","I made this recipe using some leftover store-bought marble cake and added a couple slices of Pepperidge Farm French Vanilla bread. I tossed in a handful of mini-chocolate chips instead of raisins, used one cup of skim milk and one cup of half-and-half, and omitted the sugar entirely. The bread pudding was mildly sweet, tasted like french toast, and was a hit with my family. With raisins instead of chocolate, you could even reheat it for breakfast in place of french toast."
"1","5","MY HUSBAND AND NINE YEAR OLD SON LOVED IT !! I MADE THREE DISHES OF IT IN THREE WEEKS, THEY DEMAND FOR MORE MORE, MORE, THANK YOU ALLRECIPES AND ELLEN WARFIELD."
"1","5","I have made this many times and it is VERY GOOD. We are working on concocting the perfect rum sauce topping still though. In other news,...Ok so get this: I made Martian Cookies (zucchini chocolate chip cookies) but because I tried to make them healthy and made lots of substitutions, they were pretty undesirable, cakey and looked like roadkill. So, I decided to throw them into this bread pudding as my 'bread' and this was a success. My modifications were as follows.... approximately 15 Martian Cookies (torn into small chunks) plus 4 slices wheat bread, omitted raisins, and sprinkled chocolate chips on top. Maybe in the future you will think to recycle/reincarnate your baking 'mistakes' in this recipe as I did!"
"1","5","What a wonderful recipe!! I actually didn't have whole milk, so i substituded skim instead.. and doubled the recipe also.. it came out fantastic..! I served this for a brunch for a crowd, and they couldn't stop raving about it!"
"1","5","I made this bread pudding 6/7/06.It is quite possibly the best bread pudding I have ever made.It tastes great also."
"1","3","came out soggy but probably bc I used the wrong kind of bread and added frozen berries (too much liquid?). Will try again--hopefully it'll come out better!"
"1","4","I liked this recipe. I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon but a fantastic recipe will definitely make it again."
"1","5","I thought it tasted great! The kids were able to help. I made a topping of 2 tablespoons butter,1/2cup brown sugar and a few tablespoons of maple sysrup. Heat in microwave till melted.mix and pour on top of bread pudding. This would make a really good breakfast dish."
"1","5","This was my first attempt at making bread pudding and it was GREAT! I brought it to work for a potluck and everyone loved it. Thanks for the delicious recipe!"
"1","4","This was just ok. The flavor was great but the texture was not what I was looking for. It was a bit too grainy and eggy for me. It could have been my prepration too! 4 stars because it did taste good."
"1","5","SO good! This recipe is so easy, my 5-year old daughter bascially made it on her own (with a little assistance!) and it was delicious! We doubled the cinnamon and the vanilla and used a little extra bread and it was perfect! We also only put raisins in half of the recipe since not everyone in our family is a raisin fan. My husband is NOT a bread pudding fan but agreed to try it since my daughter had so proudly made it... HE LOVED IT and even had seconds! This recipe is excellent!!"
"1","5","not being much of a domestic goddess, i found this recipe delightfully idiot-proof! its so simple and it turns out gorgeous every single time~ i followed all the tips, from reducing the eggs to 3, to adding nutmeg. thnx to this recipe my puddings are making waves in my college. the boys just luv it. lol."
"1","5","GREAT instead of white bread i used day old banana bread and followed it to a T it was about a half of a loaf. My church raved about it."
"1","5","I really like this recipe. It is easy and always turn out fine. I like it with a bit of whipped cream on the top."
"1","5","This bread pudding is easy to make and tastes great. I added a little extra cinnamon and used 1 cup of half & half and 1 cup of regular milk. I would highly recommend this recipe!Thanks Ellen!"
"1","5","Great recipe - my kids loved it! Tastes a lot like french toast."
"1","4","i tried making bread pudding many years back and it turned out so soggy that i decided i didnt like bread pudding. as i searched through this site for recipes the other day, i came across this recipe and decided to give it a go. i'm glad i did as it was quite yummy although it was a tad on the drier side, contrary to what some had written here. will put in a bit more milk next time i make it. otherwise, it's"
"1","5","Excellent bread pudding! I have a sweet tooth so I made it with oatmeal molasses bread(on this site). I added raisins and half the sugar required and it came out extra sweet and delicious. Thanks:)"
"1","5","It's a very good recipe, but it really matters what kind of bread you use. The first time I made this, I used bakery baked uncut white bread and the pudding turned out perfect!! I also reduced it to 3 eggs. Tonight I made it again, but I used prepacked, sliced french bread and my pudding was a bit soggy. Still tasted pretty good, but it wasn't as the first time. Next time I will experiment using apples too. I just love apples. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"
"1","4","Good, but a little sweet. I have made it a few times and can't seem to get the baking time right either...will probably try making it once more before I give up on it."
"1","5","Simply the best I have found! Everyone in the family loves this recipe. For a bit of added flavor and family request I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans!"
"1","5","We infused yellow custard into bread 1/2 way thru the baking process - so so good!!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the raisins and instead sprinkled a few walnuts over the bread as others had suggested. Very yummy and very easy! My Book Club loved it."
"1","5","Oh. My. Gosh. This is delicious. I just baked it for the first time. Don't change a thing -- this recipe is perfect!"
"1","5","This is still my favorite as is or dressed up so many different ways! ;-) I rated this first time 10/21/2005..I love it!"
"1","4","Good starter recipe, definately needs 'doctoring.' I used some left over pumpking bread from a loaf I made in my bread machine several days ago. It was dried out so it crumbled easily. I used 4 eggs and followed the recipe except added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts and omitted the raisins. It is very good, but next time I'll use more cinnamon, it still needs a 'kick', was a little bland even with the pumpkin bread. Will make again."
"1","3","This recipe was pretty good, but not really what I was looking for. Could be a little sweeter. And like I read in some other reviews, it sort of reminds me of french toast."
"1","5","Thia recipe was wonderful. My husband and I added apples instead of raisins. This recipes is tuly a treat.   We topped the pudding with a sweet rum sauce also available through Allrecipes.com. I would recommend this pudding for after dinner or any occasion.  You have GOT to try this recipe."
"1","4","My husband is the bread pudding lover, and very picky about how he likes it. This recipe he liked, he did say it was just a little bland so next time I will add a bit more sugar, and half again the liquid ingredence. This is a great basic recipe that can be tweaked to fit your personal taste."
"1","5","Very easy and good bread pudding recipe. I will use this one again."
"1","5","This is the same recipe that has been handed down for generations in my family. I did change it just a tad -- 3 eggs, as others suggested, and I added 1/4 cup caramel applesauce and 4 TBS caramel sauce. I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar, and increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. I omited the raisins as my kids won't eat anything with them. I baked it in a large caserole dish seated in a pan of hot water. Turned out moist and with a custard like texture. Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","YUM! As suggested by other reviewers: I used 9 slices of bread (crusts removed), 3 eggs, 1 cup milk/1 cup cream, and had soaked the raisins in water for few mins before using them. I saved half the raisins to place on top of the mixture to decorate. Served it hot with vanilla ice-cream!"
"1","5","Thanks, Ellen!! I had a ton of left over bread from a picnic, and had no idea what to do with it. I checked my fave 'allrecipes.com', and found this recipe. Like others, I used half white sugar, half brown sugar, and added a small dash of allspice. I brought the results into the office as I had to triple the recipe to use up all the bread I had. This was my first attempt at bread pudding, and I received the ultimate compliment today: one of my co-workers said it was as good as his grandmother's recipe!! He has now joined allrecipes.com himself! This recipe well deserves the many accolades it has received!"
"1","5","This was a hit tonight, I only changed 2 things, adding 2 mashed frozen bananas in place of 1/2c of milk and 1/2c brown sugar with 1/2c white sugar. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and yum!."
"1","5","okay just made it and have to tell you!! Put a can of sliced peaches in it in light syrup. But drain the syrup off. It will be too runny. Also only use 3 eggs and just a little under a cup of sugar or even 3/4 sup would be fine. I sued challah bread with raisins already in it and it was fantastic that way. The peaches make it fancy and tastes sooo good. Would be awesome with rum sauce on top too. Also, cook it a longer time and it will be less runny. ALso, drain off excess if it is runny when you take it out of the oven or push the top down and it will soak up excess. Good and will make again in future when I want another bread pudding fix."
"1","5","This is delicious! I only used 4 eggs, I find that 7 is way too much egg taste. I also made some quick changes to the recipe. I soaked mixed raisins (golden, red) in brandy before I added them to the mix. I also made a mild brandy vanilla custard that I poured over the bread pudding when I served it. Very yummy!"
"1","5","This recipe is awesome. I doubled it because I was serving 8 people. Everyone raved. My sister even had 3 helpings. I think the key is day old bread that I sliced into thick peices and tore apart."
"1","5","This was SO easy and just delicious. It makes a wonderful dessert or breakfast, and my daughter loved 'helping' me pull the bread into pieces and sprinkle on the raisins. This is by far the best new recipe I've come across in a while."
"1","5","This recipe was great. I added apples to the top and let it set in the fridge over night to let the custard soak the bread before baking. It was out of this world with vanilla ice cream and rum sauce."
"1","5","This is absolutely the best bread pudding I have ever had. I was planning to give some to the neighbors, but we devoured it. I used 3 eggs and a little extra cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Soaked the raisins in rum for a few hours, sprinkled brown sugar on top. Thank you for such a great recipe. The neighbors are waiting for their share, so I'll have to make double or triple."
"1","5","absolutley the best bread pudding I've ever made. I doubled the recipe but only used 7 eggs. I used a low fat marj instead of butter and sprayed a 9x13 pan with pam. I also used a regular loaf of raisin bread.( all but 3 slices) I will make again thanks"
"1","5","This is a great recipe--although I had to add more cinnamon than stated. . .I could hardly taste it. Also great to add apple to it!"
"1","3","It had a good taste to it, but I found it to be too 'eggy.' I will definitely try this recipe again with some alterations."
"1","3","The pudding was too eggy and not as creamy as I would've wanted. No one in the family ate it more than just for a taste. Won't make it again."
"1","5","This is great. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. and used eggnog for half of the milk. will make again."
"1","5","Bread pudding has always been a favorite of mine, and this is the best I've ever tasted. I make it every chance I get, let it sit over night to settle, and my the end of the next day it's gone and I want to make more."
"1","5","I made this bread pudding for Thankldgiving and my family absolutely loved it. I had never made bread pudding before, but this will become a staple dessert in my house. I used egg nog instead of milk. Everyone wanted my recipe!"
"1","5","Best bread pudding Ive ever had. I just used the new bread that has cinnamon and raisens by Thomas's (English Muffin Makers) and it was sensational."
"1","5","I used chocolate chip muffins that didn't come out well...this kept me from throwing them out. Whole family liked it!"
"1","5","This is beyond good, this was excellent, even as written. Of course I had to play with it. I only used 3 eggs, then used 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar which were plenty as I served it warm with a caramel sauce. Totally awesome. I did make one mistake though. Both times I just made an 8 inch sqaure pan...next time it will be a 9X13."
"1","5","Yummy! Very easy to make and taste great! Best of all, these are all ingredients that are always on hand, so it can be made practically anytime!"
"1","5","I baked this for my boyfriends family and they loved it (fewf!). I doubled everything in the recipe except for the raisins- a whole cup would have been too much! Awesome and easy to make!"
"1","5","WOW is all I can say about this recipe. Its simple and its really really good with lots of options for customizing it. I added brown sugar sprinkle on top before baking and also sprinkled top with some walnuts. (not many) I was out of vanilla so used 1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring instead. Look forward to make it time and time again with my stale bread :) I used a loaf of very good bread that we didnt get to in time. Thanks!!!"
"1","5","this was great and so easy! i used cinnamon raisin bread and let the egg/bread mixture sit for a 1/2 hour to let the mixture soak up in the bread. yummy!"
"1","5","This pudding is awesome...My family loves it...I sometimes add a couple of chopped up apples to it as well..."
"1","5","Yummm! It was a hit! I did follow others suggestions and used 3 eggs. I also let it cook quite a bit longer (I am not wild about the texture of bread pudding). Cooking longer made a nice cruchy top that tasted fabulous. I used yogurt covered raisins for fun (make sure if you cook it longer you nestle the raisins in the bread to insure they don't get burnt.) Recommend with carmel sauce drizzled on top."
"1","4","My family enjoyed this, they said it was better than average. I soaked a 1/2 cup of raisins in 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier to soften them up. I used the 4 eggs the recipe called for, 2 cups of half and half and I used six day-old finger rolls. The consistency was just right. Served it warm with vanilla bean ice cream."
"1","4","Very yummy. This was my first taste of bread pudding, and I gave it four stars because it's not quite as yummy as some other deserts to me, but still very good. I added a bit more butter than it said to add to the buttery flavor. The funny thing is, I cooked it like it said and ate some, and was going to put it back in for another ten minutes to firm it up some. But then i forgot about it and left it in for half an hour. But somehow when i took it out, it was the perfect texture. It wasn't burned or anything, just firm and crispy on top, it tasted wonderful! I will make this recipe again!"
"1","5","A very good bread pudding recipe - and easy. I used canned evaporated milk and it gave it a very rich flavor. Very versatile, just add what you want to it and pop it in the oven. Yummy warm or after it's cooled!"
"1","5","Fabulous. Used 2 large croissants instead of bread and it made it even better! Delicious warm at night, cold for breakfast. Will make again!"
"1","5","I made this for a group of friends and it was a huge hit. They didn't even know they liked bread pudding. I opted against the raisins and put in chocolate chips instead. It was fabulous! Will definitely make this one again! So quick and easy."
"1","5","Very easy to make, and excellent to eat! I followed the recipe as stated, and it turned out great! Definitely a keeper. I did use 2 day old honey-buttermilk bread that I made in my bread machine, but the crusts off."
"1","4","My first time making AND eating this dessert. It was quite nice, although very bready (duh)and it was much better with ice cream! I'd try it again if I have vanilla ice cream nearby! Very easy to make!"
"1","4","I tried this with 3 old cinnamon raisin bagels--yum! Added an extra 1/2 cup milk though, the bagels soaked it up quick. I did have a lot of extra butter floating on top."
"1","5","This was great, my 4 year-old helped me make it, that's how simple it is and the taste is anything but! Real good!"
"1","5","This recipe rules! I'm not a raisin fan so I put in chocolate chips instead. I also usually 1 1/2 times the recipe (9 slices of bread, etc)and it fits perfectly in a square pan. To top it off I make a vanilla sauce also from the website."
"1","5","Easy and yummy!"
"1","5","My whole family loved this recipe! I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and increased the butter to 1/4 cup and decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon (next time I will put in the full teaspoon). I also sprinkled chopped apple on top instead of the raisins. I will definately make this recipe again."
"1","4","I did alot of changes to this recipe. I put popeyes biscuts 6, nutmeg and cinniman and i melted a half a stick in the batter and that was it. But other words I enjoyed it"
"1","5","I only had bread pudding once in my life. My grandma made some. I hadn't had any since I was little so I came across this recipe and it really is easy. Also fun for my son to help me make. My son loves it and so do I. We will make it again and again. :)"
"1","4","**** because we really didn't know what to expect, my husband or myself had never eaten bread pudding before- my hubby is really picky about textures and he went back for seconds-- he really liked the taste- and asked if i would make it again- so i was really suprised- YUMMY- great taste// i will probably stick with this recipe and not bother trying others-"
"1","5","This is the best Bread Pudding I have tasted I have made it for my father-in-law and he cant wait for more."
"1","5","This is as good as Grandma's!!!!!"
"1","5","I used day-old homemade biscuits. Also I added just a pinch of nutmeg and a few golden raisins. Very easy/fast, and tasted delicious."
"1","5","LOVED THIS BREAD PUDDING. VERY EASY AND DELICIOUS. WOULD LIKE TO FIND A LOW CALORIE VANILLA SAUCE FOR THE TOP BUT IT IS GOOD WITHOUT.I USED RAISIN BREAD."
"1","5","Very good and not too sweet. I tried it with a loaf of french bread. Tasty..."
"1","4","This was a wonderfully quick and scruptious desert, I am pleased to agree with everyone else who raved about this recipe!! Great one to try anytime, why wait for an occasion! And a great way to use up that lefteover bread at the end of the week! I chose to put the loaf ends on the top layer which gave it a more crunchy texture on top! Thankx Ellen..."
"1","5","This is amazing bread pudding. I used half and half cream and it was way too good for my waist-line!"
"1","5","I adore bread pudding - it is the ultimate comfort food! This is a great, easy recipe that is wonderful warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! Yum!"
"1","5","Wonderful!! Very easy too, I am the only one in the house who likes bread pudding, so needless to say I am going to need some extra workout days because of this one! Good recipe though, I will keep it on the fridge now!"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe. Even better cold when refrigerated overnight. mmmmmm I also tried it with some caramel sauce drizzled on top. Yum."
"1","5","It has been a while since I made bread pudding and was really glad, after it was done, that i found this recipe here. It was absolutely great!! I even had a couple of people who tried it to be 'nice' really enjoy it. Thank you for sharing it with us.  Allen"
"1","5","My husband loved this, it is one of his top desserts. I think it should be served with a carmel sauce."
"1","5","this has got to be one of the best and easiest to make. i have made it twice now and had to give it to my daughter so she could make it for her husband. he loved it and reminded him of home."
"1","5","Wonderful! Used cinnamon raisen bread but followed the rest of the recipe. Next time I think I'll use one less egg also. It's great cold too! If you like bread pudding, this is definitely the one to try!"
"1","4","This was good bread pudding. The first time I made it it was very mushy, so the next time I added more bread. I did not use raisins and I used one less egg as suggested."
"1","5","Wonderful. I used cinnamon bread and omitted the nutmeg and doubled the recipe, thank goodness. This recipe is so easy. I added a thin icing while it was still warm. This is a keeper."
"1","5","Everyone loved it and it tasted great. I think I would cook it a little longer as it was a little soggy (might have been my bread). My husband asked 'where's the sauce'. So I'll have to keep looking for that. We will make this again soon!"
"1","5","WOW!!! What can I say that has not been said yet? This recipe is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Bread Pudding is one of my absolutely favorite desserts, and I almost ate the entire pan in one evening!!! I think it tastes good with some chocolate whipped cream of some maple syrup drizzled on top. I recommend that you add the raisins. We used stale Irish Soda Bread, and it was fantastic!!! This seems like such a basic recipe, but it is wonderful!!! The only changes we would make next time will be to use one less egg (it might have just been us, but it was somewhat eggy, but still excellent) and 1 cup sugar. Thanks for the awesome recipe! My mom even loved it, and she has refused to use any recipe other than her grandmother's for the past many years. I highly recommend you try this!!! NUMMY!!! I think I am going to go finish off the FEW leftovers right now... that is, if somebody hasn't eaten them all already. ;o)"
"1","5","TASTES JUST LIKE ONE BIG DELICIOUS FRENCH TOAST! this turned out beautifully. everyone loved it with milk poured on top. i added extra cinnamon since i love cinnamon. and i didn't have day-old or stale bread so i just popped slices of pullman bread into the oven to make them slightly hard and crunchy like the texture of stale bread. great pudding! great recipe!"
"1","4","Was pretty good, with a nice cinnamon taste. I used day old french bread, half and half, omitted an egg and increased the vanilla and cinnamon as mentioned by other readers. Was nice and custardy too. I served it with vanilla cream sauce that I took from another bread pudding recipe here, but that was not so good, too buttery. I guess i should try with a brown sugar sauce next time. Any recipes for a good sauce to serve with this?"
"1","5","I had to join, just so I could rate this recipe.  I used stale french bread (6 slices), skim milk, egg substitute, and currants instead of raisins. It held its own beautifully. Thank you!!"
"1","5","This is a great bread pudding recipe. I made a the small batch and it came out perfect. I put a pinch of fresh nutmeg in it also. I love it cold too."
"1","5","It was a really good recipe. I used one less egg, warmed the milk, added more cinnamon and vanilla, used 1/2 the raisins (soaked them in a little bit of hot water) and added some walnuts (I probably won't do that again). The taste was great, but it was a little bit dry. I think I'll use a little more milk next time. Will definitely be making this again and will probably use cinnamon raisin bread.*****I had to add to this review because I just made this recipe again and it came out fabulous! I added 1/4 cup of raisins and half a peeled and diced apple. Before I added the apple, I mixed the diced apple with a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon sugar. I really scalded the milk and used a 1/4 cup of milk more than the recipe called for. I used potato bread for the bread and added Cool Whip on top of the pudding. The end result was so yummy and now I know why so many people have tried and reviewed this recipe with such great results."
"1","5","very yummy and easy. this disappears quickly!"
"1","5","A great recipe. YUMMY!"
"1","5","This recipe is fabulous. My husband took one bite and said 'oh my god'. I have never gotten that kind of reaction to my cooking before. I used cinammon raisin bread, 3 eggs, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also made a sauce for it but no one used it--it was perfect as is. Thanks Ellen!!!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Tastes me back to my childhood and remembering warm bread pudding fresh from the oven. My mama always enhanced it with warm cinnamon sauce! Mmmmmm good!!!"
"1","5","This is the best bread pusdding I've ever had. I really dislike bread pudding that is too dry and this turned out very moist and yummy."
"1","5","I tried this bread pudding recipe last night. We thought it was real easy to prepare and it tasted really good. As soon as I get off the computer I am going to warm up some for a midnight snack."
"1","5","I wanted to make this for my husband and baby because I thought they might like it. I do not like bread pudding. Something about mushy wet bread does not appeal to me. But suprise surprise when I saw how much eveyone else was enjoying it I took a small taste and ended up with a big helping myself! In my opinion, any recipe that can make you like something that you usually don't is really GREAT. Thanks Ellen."
"1","5","This recipe is sooooo good! Yum :) Very easy to make."
"1","5","This bread pudding was wonderful. I got nothing but praise when people ate it. Just like my Gram used to make. THANKS!"
"1","5","very good! especially with the brown sugar sauce suggested by someone else!! I also use 1 less egg and a bit more vanilla and cinnamon. Very delicious!"
"1","5","I made it for company and everyone loved it! I read the other reviews first of course, and ommitted 1 eqq, added more cinnamin and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I had to give out copies of the recipe!"
"1","5","I made this for my friend recently who happens to love bread pudding and she raved about how good it was. Very yummy recipe!"
"1","4","I served this bread pudding at a gathering of 150 people. I got plenty of raves. It's easy to prepare and excellent in taste. I added crushed pineapples to the top before baking and spoon- drizzled caramel sauce after baking. Just to jazz it up. However,it was great just the way she recommended."
"1","5","This was great, I omitted one egg and it was not so eggie ( is that a word?). I made it for my husbands cousin and he said it was so good he wanted to climb into the baking dish, to get closer to it. Your family has good taste. Lynne"
"1","5","I personally don't eat bread pudding, I learned to make it because my dad loves it. He thinks it's great and so do the girls at the office. I have used this recipe for over a year now and have gotten rave reviews. I add a few craisins to the recipe and everythingelse is the same."
"1","5","Overall, very yummy. I would, however, use a larger baking dish to ensure there will be more crusty bread than soggy. I served it with the brown sugar sauce submitted by Brenda Moore. Definately will make again."
"1","4","Overall, pretty good but not the best I've every had. Too eggy, and not enough cinnamon. Should satisfy the simple palate."
"1","5","I made this for my grandfather and he loves it."
"1","5","My husband tells me this is the best bread pudding recipe he has ever had. He is a great lover of bread pudding. I modified this recipe a bit by substituting soy milk for cows milk and margarine for butter because my son has a milk allergy. Even with these substitutions, it is a great recipe. I like it best after it has been refrigerated for a day or so."
"1","5","Great recipe if your watching your budget, easy to prepare, and very tasty. It was gone in no time !"
"1","5","Wonderful recipe! I substituted banana bread for the plain bread... then topped with chopped pecans, and served with a homemade brown sugar sauce. This turned out INCREDIBLE. I imagine it'd be just as good with any quickbread (cranberry, blueberry, etc.)."
"1","5","I used this recipe originally then altered it a bit to suit my familys taste. This is by far the best Bread Pudding Recipe I've tried! Its quick, easy and inexpensive to make! Mrs. D. M. Rainwater"
"1","5","I have been looking for this recipe for years! There are alot of bread pudding recipes out there, but I finally found the one I was looking for! It is awsome, and there are so many variations you can invent for it! Thanks a bunch!"
"1","5","My husband wanted me to make bread pudding and your recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I had all the ingredients on hand which helped. Even the kids who said 'Yerk' when they saw it, asked for seconds!!I served it with a drizzle of maple syrup as a treat..."
"1","5","Excellent results and Oh! so easy.... Will definitely make it again."
"1","5","WOW!!!! This was delicious. Husband said it was a 'keeper' recipe and that says something coming from him. Thanks."
"1","5","This was the first time I ever made bread pudding. I took it to work and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!"
"1","4","I've only had bread pudding a few times and found this one a bit on the mushy side. I prefer bread pudding to be drier but my husband liked it."
"1","5","Bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts and this recipe was excellent. Although, I substituted light cream for the milk."
"1","5","'This has to be the best breadpudding ever' It was soooo enjoyed by husband, kids, and myself!!!"
"1","5","Excellent taste and texture. I will have to double it next time I made this.(which will be real soon)!"
"1","5","Delicious and very easy to make! I recommend soaking the raisins in hot water to soften them first before adding them to the recipe."
"1","5","Would give it ten stars if I could! I ommitted the raisins and used raisin bread to make the prep easier. I also found that buttering the pan first helps get it out of a glass baking dish."
"0","5","I used almond milk as well as chunks of day-old pretzel bread and breakstick bread, and it came out really yummy."
"0","4","I added half the sugar approximately at 1/4 cup of white sugar and only 1 cup of milk, I also added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and nutmeg and a table spoon of cocoa. A slight hint of honey. I also topped it with a dash of cinnamon and some vanilla and it came out so soft and it smells absolutely amazing! And I topped it with confectioners sugar and it couldn't look more dazzling. Oo also added syrup after i took it out ofthe oven and out a wjole layer over it (this is optional obviously)"
"0","5","I read some of the reviews saying it was too sweet (probably the combo of sugar and raisins) so I cut down the sugar to 1/2 a cup and kept the raisins. I didn't want it to be too eggy so I did add an extra slice of bread. I love vanilla so I added 2 tsps instead of the one they asked for and I added 1 tsp of Nutmeg and a pinch of Corriander. It was absolutely delicious. My parents, who are big fans of bread pudding and eat it any chance they get, said that this was the best one that they ever had."
"0","5","Just made this doubled the recipe used hamburger buns (10 whole buns) for the double recipe it was awesome the recipe is the perfect balance of ingredients also had to cook for an hour instead of 45 minutes made it again on 9/15/15 used 12 full hamburger buns, 3 cups of milk and 6 eggs for the double recipe it was excellent baked for 50 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered"
"0","5","Very good, almost as good as my husbands. Very easy to make, wonderful served warm with french vanilla ice cream."
"0","4","Super easy recipe and very tasty."
"0","5","Easy recipe to follow.can't wait to see how it turned out"
"0","5","Delish ! I used a bit more cinnamon . Definitely will make again !"
"0","5","I love bread pudding and this is the first time I have made it. Followed this recipe and only reduced the amount of sugar by maybe 2 heaping tablespoons. The reason being is that the bread I used had a thin layer of icing. I bought this homemade bread in the Bahamas (raisin/cinnamon) and put it in the freezer on the boat I was traveling on. This was my daily recipe from allrecipes so thawed the bread in the fridge and used it for the bread ingredient. I sliced the 6 slices called for a little thicker then a normal slice of bread and it was the perfect amount. This recipe by far is one of the best bread pudding dishes I have ever had. By evening half of the bread pudding was gone. :-) Can't wait to make this again. By the way, I still added raisins because the bread didn't have that many. Next time I will use supermarket raisin/cinnamon or make another trip to the Bahamas and stock up. :-) Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","We used vanilla soy milk instead of milk and added a little extra cinnamon"
"0","5","good"
"0","5","yummy and super easy! my sister in law doesn't like raisins, so I left them out and doubled the cinnamon. The only bread I had on hand was 'fake bread' sandwich bread.... it has very little texture because of it. but it was still a nice addition to my day. I will definitely try this again, but will try it with challah or a baguette."
"0","5","I made this exactly as written and my family loved it. I cut the sugar to a 1/2 cup and my family still loved it. I changed it to 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup splenda and they still loved it. This is an amazing recipe as-is and a nigh impossible to screw up base for variations. Next weekend I'm dropping the cinnamon, going back to 3/4 cups sugar, and adding frozen raspberries. I bet my family will love it."
"0","5","I added chopped apples and used apple pie spice"
"0","5","I have used this recipe several times my Husband and mother love it. sometimes i add dried cranberries as well as raisins. we love it thank you"
"0","5","This is the best bread pudding recipe! Everybody that tried it loves it. The best thing is.....its easy to make."
"0","5","Loved it! Just like everyone else, I added my own touches!"
"0","5","A-mazing! I've made this recipe several times so far and it's so good that I have to double it! I bake it in a 9x13 glass Pyrex and the only change I make is added more bread. I really don't keep count of how many slices but I add enough so it doesn't look soupy. As its baking, it rises so beautifully, almost like a soufflé! Thank you for sharing this recipe Ellen!"
"0","5","I have never made bread pudding before and I enjoyed playing with this recipe. I used 4 pieces of Texas toast bread and a 6-sided pie pan. I used chopped dates instead of raisins. One of the other reviews mentioned adding some powdered ginger and nutmeg to the recipe, so I added 1/4 tsp of powdered ginger, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I didn't have much heavy whipping cream in the fridge, so I added the 1/2 cup I had left to 1 1/2 cups of milk. I also sprinkled chopped pecans and brown sugar over the top before baking. This baked wonderfully!"
"0","5","Great recipe and easy to make! I used challah bread with raisins in it and added blue berries as well. Turned out great."
"0","5","This is my first bread pudding and it's awesome as is!"
"0","5","I made this with egg hot dog buns that were going stale. I substituted half & half for the milk and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. allspice and it came out perfect! No water bath needed!"
"0","5","I tried it and loved it, kids don't like raisins (I do) so made it with same amount of chopped apples and it was really good."
"0","5","People request that I make this for almost every pot luck at work! I never have any leftovers. Amazing when served warm with vanilla custard on top!!"
"0","5","My #1"
"0","5","I love bread pudding but am not really a baker. Turned out great and was delicious."
"0","5","This is a family favorites for ours."
"0","1","Terrible! I used regular bread. Don't know why it us still watery"
"0","4","I added an apple also."
"0","4","very good, super simple and requested by everyone. Definitely a recipe to have on hand anytime you need to make something yummy."
"0","4","Great recipe! I used bread that was dried out and crusty (trader joe's rustic loaves and ciabata). I altered a bit by soaking the extremely hard bread in milk. I also doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 dish to bake in. It was my first time making bread pudding."
"0","5","Just made this pudding with out the raisins and it was so nice. It taste just like a ciniman donut!! Yummo"
"0","5","I have made this for years. I put a vanilla sauce over all."
"0","3","This is a good recipe. It is beautiful and brown in the oven but I do have a problem with the bread falling after taking it out of the oven. Does anyone else have that problem? What am I doing wrong? Thanks!"
"0","5","The perfect recipe for bread pudding! It is so amazing, my husband is officially addicted. It is so simple, yet so good. All the flavors marry nicely. I love eating it warm with vanilla bean ice cream. I suggest that everyone add the raisins because they complement the dish well. Will definitely be making this again soon, especially for gatherings."
"0","4","A little too sweet for me, but kids loved it. Granddaughter said -- it tastes like French toast but only better."
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! I took some of the suggestions and added a few of my own. I substituted white sugar with organic cane sugar, and the raisins with pecans and black walnuts. I also used two types of bread and added extra slices. After I sprinkled the top with brown sugar I covered the top with more of the egg, milk, cinnamon, vanilla mixture. I also added nutmeg. Then I baked it in my large round cast iron pan. Tasted like a cinnamon roll with nuts."
"0","4","I used 5 slices of Udi's GF bread but that was a bit much since they are large slices. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and it was still on the sweet side. I like bread pudding a little more custard-like so will use less bread should I use this recipe again."
"0","5","loved this recipe as is (although I will try Christie's changes next time - different seasonings and with walnuts, ,etc), but do yourself a big favor and don't add in the optional raisins. yuck!"
"0","3","We thought it tasted a bit plain."
"0","3","I don't know but I feel it's missing something, some boldness in the taste. Maybe I need more bread or a different kind of bread instead of this cheap supermarket one."
"0","5","Very simple and the best bread pudding"
"0","5","Super easy recipe! and Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","I used cinnamon raisin breakfast bread instead of plain - oh my, it took the recipe to the next level. Also used cranberries for near-Christmas dinners. Kids love helping with this one too."
"0","5","Soo good! This was my first attempt at this dessert. And my entire family loved it. I read in one review that it was much too sweet so I cut the sugar by a tiny bit. Also, it cooked faster than the recipe said it would by five minutes so check it earlier. I am glad I gave it a try."
"0","5","Made a few changes and it was delicious.....family loved it . I used Panatone bread ( with currants) and estimated the 6 slices; used 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar; and half and half instead of milk. This was the first time I've ever made a bread pudding.....so easy ! Moist,crispy on top and flavorful."
"0","3","Made it with out the raisins and turned out alright. I'll probably try making it again sometime with the raisins and see how it is."
"0","5","I made Bread pudding for the first time following this recipe. It came out pretty good it being my first. Thank you for sharing your recipe."
"0","5","Very nice. Super easy and not too sweet."
"0","5","I have prepared this recipe many times and it always comes out great. I did experiment a bit during the holidays using spiced or caramel eggnog instead of milk or a mixture of the two, and cranberries instead of raisins. I was pleasantly surprised!"
"0","5","My husband LOVED this recipe!!!! His only want was for me to double the cinnamon next batch. He ate half of a double batch when it came out of the oven!!!"
"0","5","Oh wow this is really good! After reading the other comments I did add more bread (I used regular loaf bread) plus I added pecans and apple slices! It was DELISH!"
"0","5","I made this and the family loved it. I also doubled it and made in 9x11 pan too. It is very good with milk over the top. I didn't add the raisins as we don't care for them, but I am sure it is wonderful with raisins for those who do like them. Thanks for the recipe!!!!"
"0","5","Very good... I followed these directions and my Bread pudding came out good for my 1st time!"
"0","5","Followed the ingredient directions but I listened to one of the reviews and mixed everything together before putting into the baking dish. This is fantastic. Will be making this again for sure."
"0","5","Everyone loves and is worth making, but would still like some kind of liqueur on it."
"0","5","I have been making this for a few years now around the holidays. Everyone loves it! I also use the vanilla sauce but will have to try the rum sauce sometime. Donuts would be a great option as well. However, my favorite so far is using cranberry orange bread (when I can find it) which I add craisins to. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","perfect for a quick breakfast casserole!!"
"0","5","Ok...l fallow this recipe because it was the first popping out on the web...and it was awesome. I m in italy so l used pandoro instead of bread no raisins but sliced apples and a crumble with butter brown sugar and pecans over the top."
"0","5","Delicious! First time making bread pudding and I nailed it! My daughter helped me so we had one to many raisins but it was still delicious. I added nutmeg and used milk instead of half and half. The outside was crunchy and the middle was spongy. I also served it with a vanilla pudding bourbon sauce so good!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","This was a fantastic way to use up stale bread. I also didn't find it overly sweet which was nice. I used dry currants instead of raisins. I think next time I'll try apples and nuts!"
"0","4","I made it just as written except I added some cranberries instead of raisins and served it with maple syrup. I used a leftover home made Vasilipita bread. It came out beautifully. Definitely a dish to make more often especially for a big crowd that likes sweets. Unfortunately my family is not into bread pudding because they find it too sweet. I tried it a second time with left over dinner buns and 1 cup of frozen (defrosted) blueberries and it turned out even better but once agai a bit too sweet."
"0","5","Was delicious. Matters what kind of bread you use... mine had nuts and grains in it which made it have more texture than perhaps I wanted. I would also use more cinnamon the next time, but I do like my food rather flavourful."
"0","5","This is a very easy bread pudding to make. Have made it several times. Can vary the bread to anything you have. Have used what hamburger buns, white and whole wheat bread as well as buns that are dry."
"0","5","Wonderful comfort food. This recipe brings back memories of Sunday supper at my grandmother's house, as a kid!   The recipe is simple and suitable for just about any skill level.  For interesting flavor and texture, try using a whole grain bread."
"0","4","This was a great base recipe thank you for sharing! I did however substitute a few thing's.  I used a can of condensed milk rather than granulated sugar, I used white chocolate chips instead of raisins & I drizzled raspberry sauce over it. Very yummy! I'll need to try it as is too though. Thanks again ;)"
"0","4","love this recipe !! first time I made bread pudding and it came out great I didn't measure the sugar though I jus threw some in bt It was less than 3/4 cup and I added a little pinch of salt and some Appleton (Jamaican rum )"
"0","4","I made this for an older couple who were having their Amish family members visit them. They loved it! I made a triple batch so we could have some to 'test' at home. We will make this again. I used cinnamon swirl bread and half and half. Yummy!"
"0","4","I made this on Christmas day to go with the cookies. I liked it very much! I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","This is an amazing recipe for a quick bread pudding! I omitted the raisins for my husband, and I used 2-3 day old cinnamon rolls and 2-3 day old pound cake for the 'bread-like' ingredients in this dessert!!! It came out fantastic!! My husband couldn't stop eating it!! He had 3 helpings!!! Thanks for sharing!??"
"0","5","This was my first try with bread pudding, and this is a great recipe. I used Cinnamon Raisin bread (9 slices), 4 eggs, 2 cups whole milk and the other ingredients. I topped it off with a warm bourbon sauce. Delicious!"
"0","5","I have made this bread pudding several times using coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk.. no need for sugar here. It is a simple, delicious recipe that we will enjoy for many years. My young kids don't like the raisins so I make half/half. Enjoy!"
"0","5","I don't like Raisins so I used 2 ripened bananas... (love bananas) EVERYONE LOVED LOVED IT !!!!!! Instead of pouring the liquid over the bread I tore the bread up in the liquid... then poured in the baking dish.... Took a little more baking time... 10 MIN... but it turned out great ..... :)"
"0","5","I used this as a start but made some changes, I used 1 can of sweet condensed milk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Replaced the raisins with heath bar chips. And made a cinnamon rum glaze. It was great!"
"0","4","The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a T and found it to be of an egg-y flavor so next time I only used 3 eggs instead of 4, added more raisins (a fav in our family) added some shakes of the cinnamon sugar and added some orange extract and it came out perfect!"
"0","5","This was so easy. Smelled amazing while baking. Tastes devine."
"0","5","It was actually very good, it taste just the way we do our French toast , very good."
"0","5","I loved this! The only thing that I did differently was add a little rum extract. It totally changed the flavor!"
"0","5","I tweaked the recipe after reading other reviews. I used raisen bread and cinnamon bread. I used half and half instead of milk. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Teaspoon extra cinnamon. I less egg. Cooked 10 minutes longer. The old man LOVES it!!!! My first time making it!!!! :)"
"0","5","Made this with Kings Hawaiian bread. Used half and half. It was a huge hit. We used condensed milk for our sauce. Kids said it was new Thanksgiving tradition."
"0","5","This recipe was amazing!!! I couldn't stop myself from eating seconds!!!"
"0","5","I made this bread pudding today and my family love it. I used a few more slices of bread. Really simple,easy to make. I love it!!!"
"0","4","Delicious and easy. I'll cook for about 10 more minutes next time...a little too mushy in the middle. Also I used about half of the raisins."
"0","5","I don't like raisins so I used dried cranberries instead. Otherwise, followed the recipe as is. Delicious! Just like my Scottish grandmother used to make!"
"0","5","Love this recipe. It's easy to make and versitle. I've made it a number of times and have added to the basic recipe. I've used scones, rather than bread; added chopped pears, or berries; changed the sugar to brown; and used different extracts. Each variation was successful and was eaten up quickly!"
"0","3","This was okay, but I don't think I would make it again. I think french toast might taste better, and I do like bread pudding!"
"0","5","I altered this recipe a little. I took old Italian bread with crust, sliced it, put slices in glass square dish. I used brown sugar versus white and almond milk versus regular. I added raisins, drizzled the melted butter, sprinkled the cinnamon then covered with the milk, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla mixture. Once covered let sit a couple minutes then cut the bread in quarters, baked for 45 minutes, came out lite and fluffy. Absolutely delicious. Definitely will make again."
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for a while. Its always delicious.  Variations I enjoy: cinamon rolls instead of bread. Glazed donuts instead of bread. Very sweet."
"0","4","I use raisin bread,butter it then cut it into cubes. I also use diluted carnation milk. Nice flavour. When done, drizzle with butterscotch ice cream topping."
"0","5","This bread pudding turned out fabulous! Followed all ingredients and baking instructions, but the only thing that I changed was using a whole loaf of Trader Joes cinnamon raisin challah bread. Using the whole loaf was perfect for the amount of wet mixture of this recipe. I made it for a party and everyone raved how good it was! Now I'm making it again for a Friendsgiving meal! I've already got requests to make two!!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe. I think the secret is to use good bread. I used sourdough from Winco's bakery and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. Also make Lemon Sauce I to go with it and they both are keepers! Thanks for sharing a great recipe."
"0","5","This is the one and only bread pudding recipe you should ever use! I have made it so many times. Adjust the sweetness to your liking. I personally prefer it less sweet. I go with 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup sugar. If I want more sweet, I pour maple syrup on top. I have had it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. It's wonderful with ice cream."
"0","5","Recipe is perfect. I used Panettone for my bread! WOW, pure perfection!"
"0","5","First time makin bread pudding and it came out fantastic. I used heavy cream and added a tblsp more of irish butter. Also used organic sugar, spice islands pure vanilla extract, saigon cinnamon and 2 extra slices of pepperidge farms rasin cinn swirl bread instead of adding rasins. Decadence. My wife and 84 year old mother were amazed. Thanks for a great recipe ellenmarie and for all the review ideas to change it up a bit."
"0","5","Delicious! My youngest won't eat eggs, but she was clueless that she consumed a whole egg for breakfast along with 1 1/2 pieces of whole wheat bread, 1/2 cup of milk and some raisins. Can't find a breakfast much more balanced and nutritious than this was. I will definitely be making this again and probably doubling it if the girls have friends here for sleepovers."
"0","5","Has anyone tried to use Splenda and 40 calorie bread with this recipe?"
"0","4","Really good, and super easy. It was a tad too sweet for us, so now I'll be making it with 1/2 cup sugar. Nice dessert."
"0","5","This is the recipe I use. The only small change I make is that I add MORE eggs because we like the custard it makes. I see where people say they love the recipe, but then they add and/or subtract a variety of ingredients, which makes it an entirely different recipe altogether. My parents always made bread pudding like this with day old bread from the store. Yesterday I found Italian loaves for $1.00 each in WalMart. Great for making this yummy dessert. I serve it with a bit of vanilla ice cream on top."
"0","5","I made this tonight for the first time ever. I love the way my mother made bread pudding. Of course I altered the recipe a little.  Less milk, eggs and sugar. I mixed white and brown sugar. Natural brown sugar. I used Essence Melange instead of vanilla for flavor. I added nutmeg and cinnamon. To top the pudding I garnish with peaches. It smells really good! Thanks"
"0","5","Amazing recipe! Everyone love it. I used whipping cream instead of milk."
"0","4","My children love it! Will share this recipe with frens..."
"0","5","I just mixed together a very similar bread pudding and am waiting for it to soak for a couple of hours before baking. Couldn't help myself, but I had to add 1 Tbls of rum to the two cups of milk before mixing up the ingredients. Bread pudding rocks!"
"0","5","Wonderful! I used French bread that I had on hand. I didn't have raisins so I added dried cranberries and walnuts instead. I used almond milk because lactose into"
"0","5","This came out awesome!!!! I added coconut flakes for additional flavor. Now my family keeps bringing me stale bread as a hint to make more."
"0","5","This was nice and easy, to do with my daughter!"
"0","5","Excellent but since I cut up whatever bread I have - my ratio of bread to eggs and milk is : 8 cups of bread to 4 cups of milk and 4 eggs. Delicious!"
"0","5","I use kaiser rolls from the store deli. Usually 4 is just enough. I love this so much better than French toast!"
"0","4","I Liked it a lot but couldn't love it because it had an eggy taste. Other than that it was good. I did a raisin and apple bread pudding, it was easy enough to make so for those reasons I gave it 4 stars."
"0","5","Yum yum yummy! I'm a fan of bread pudding and this is really good bread pudding. Super easy to make-and doesn't even need a sauce or whip cream to enjoy. I added a little extra vanilla and cinnamon but then I always do that. A keeper for sure!"
"0","5","AMAZING MUAH ??"
"0","5","Easy to make and delicious to eat."
"0","5","Loved it!! Doubled it and not sorry I did! I use less cinnamon and I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar and nutmeg on top (cuz my mom used to!) other than that I kept to the recipe which was very close to my mothers old recipe. Next time I will try the turbinado sugar as someone else suggested. I wish I could capture the scent in my house!!!"
"0","4","Delicious! One of my favorite desserts :)"
"0","5","This turned out delicious! I used unsweetened Almond Milk, Milk Chocolate Raisinets and Truvia sweetener with sugar. At first I thought I used too much sweetener as I did not follow the conversion chart but using 3/4 cup Truvia and sugar was perfect for us. The sweetness was probably just right because the Almond milk was unsweetened. This was easy to make so I will make some more in the future! --MaitaSantiago"
"0","5","This recipe turned out very good. I can't wait to try the leftovers tonight!"
"0","5","Delicious. I used French bread and added chocolate chips instead of raisins."
"0","5","Loved it. This was terrific. I made this recipe this afternoon and there are only two pieces left. My brother says he will finish the rest tonight. What a great and easy recipe. I used craisins and dried cherries instead of regular raisins. Still so good just as it is."
"0","5","I used week old croissants and it was great. Not too eggy."
"0","5","Tastes delish. B^D"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! Only changes I made was subbing milk for half and half, and using 9 slices of your standard sandwich white bread instead of six. Awesome recipe."
"0","5","Love it. They easy recipe's, also quick and dont take much time to make. Also the slow cooker recipes are great too."
"0","3","I agree with the others who said it was way too eggy. I tend to prefer a firm, sweet bread pudding that holds together well and can be cut evenly, so I will be trying other recipes to find what I'm looking for. I agree also with those who say that this recipe is bland, but only if served fresh from the oven - I find that it tastes best and has a better texture if cooled well before serving."
"0","5","Used Kings Hawaiian Sweet bread cubed and added some apples and nutmeg. My family loved it so much they were left complaining that I didn't make enough. Also used heavy cream instead of the milk."
"0","5","We multiply this by 1.5 and cook it in the slowcooker. It's becoming a staple and we keep a bag of bread ends in the freezer for making this recipe. I'm going to experiment with cutting down the sugar and replacing at least some of it with stevia."
"0","5","This recipe is easy, easy, easy, and the results come out perfectly each time."
"0","5","very good, next time I will add nuts and cocounts"
"0","5","I love this recipe!!!!!! It's superb!"
"0","5","When my granddaughter spends the night, the next morning she always asks to make pancakes or waffles from allrecipes. Last weekend we made Megan's classic waffles. We had leftovers; usually I put them in the fridge to warm in the microwave the next day or two. This time I decided to try using them in this bread pudding recipe. Very delicious indeed!"
"0","4","Really good, add more bread to make a dryer texture."
"0","5","Made it last Christmas and it was a hit!!! Delicious! The only recipe i will use!"
"0","5","I used jimmy johns day old bread that you can get from any jimmy johns for 50 cents... My fiancé and friends absolutely LOVED it!"
"0","5","I made a healthy low-fat version. It was a great hit with my husband."
"0","5","I made this gluten free by using 3 Schar hot dog buns. Holy cow was it good. It tasted exactly like I was hoping it would!!"
"0","2","I cut back on the eggs and made it. I tried it right out of the oven and I thought it was a bit too mushy. Maybe it's better when cooled? I'll have to see, but I'm baking it for another 10 min just to get rid of that moisture. Still, I don't think I'd make this again..."
"0","5","Exactly like the pudding my mother use to make! I doubled the recipe and omitted the raisins because the hubby doesn't like them. I noticed that one reviewer mentioned there was too much egg. I though I was going to have that problem as well but I just let the bread rest and soak up the egg mixture for about 5 minutes. It came out perfect!!!! It was a hit with my family! Thank you so much for sharing!"
"0","3","I have made many bread pudding recipes before this one was ok for me. I just think there was too much egg for me, I added 1/4 cup pure maple syrup instead of white sugar. The flavor was great but the texture was spongy and too egg like for me. the I used 8 slices of bread instead of 6. I will try this recipe again but with 3 eggs instead of 4."
"0","5","Very easy and yummy. Close to grandma's bread pudding. I used whole wheat bread and was just as good. A hit! Thanks!"
"0","5","Excellent bread pudding! Definitely will use this recipe again!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! It tastes really good and is easy to make. You can also put more in it like chocolate. Thank You!"
"0","5","Yummy! I hadn't tried bread pudding before and I love it!! Great recipe."
"0","5","Delish! I added a sprinkling of cloves and nutmeg to it with yummy results! I might try walnuts or chocolate chips next! Oh the possibilities..."
"0","5","Found this recipe very easy to make and loved it"
"0","5","great, great, great! My spouse always complained that my bread pudding was never like Mom's -- not anymore! got rave reviews from all! Thanks for a wonderful recipe that will be a family favorite forever."
"0","3","Too sweet! I squeezes two lemon over the top after tasting it. This cut some of the sweetness."
"0","5","I eyeballed all the ingredients but pretty much followed the recipe as it was written. The only change was I added a dried out McIntosh apple I had lying around just to get rid of it. This recipe is so freaking easy and delicious. I am DEFINITELY going to make it again."
"0","5","Awesome recipe. Exactly what I was craving. Only changes I made were: no raisins, added half TBSP of coconut oil, one cup half&half & one cup milk (instead of two cups milk), pinch of nutmeg, and sprinkled about a TBSP o brown sugar on top before I put it in the oven. Came out glorious!"
"0","4","Nice -- but even better if you add things to it, like...   - 2 Tbsp grated coconut (unsweetened); - 2/3 cups chopped walnuts; - a good handful of dry raisins (fat, golden ones are best!);  - 3 chopped sweet apples.  Like others on this board, I have used brown sugar - a little less than what was asked for in the recipe, because of the dry raisins which are already quite sweet.  Oh... and I have served it with 6% natural yoghurt!  If you have a sweet tooth, you can even top the yoghurt with a little maple syrup!!!"
"0","4","Very nice, served with Birds Custard! Changes: 1/2 heavy whipping cream, 1/2 milk. 2 teaspoons vanilla & 3 eggs."
"0","5","I followed the recipe almost exactly. I just added one small chopped apple, and a bit of nutmeg. Also topped with chopped pecans. I had to bake about 10 minutes longer. Also added a vanilla sauce...yum. I'd save this is a wonderful recipe - made as is with no extras, but easy to add your own touches without affecting the integrity of the recipe. Thanks! This is going in my recipe file! (Oh yeah, my bread was still fresh and soft, so I just toasted it lightly first. Seemed to work well.)"
"0","5","I've made this with stale homemade bread, croissant and baguette (separately, not mixed together). It's delicious every time! I tried it without sultanas but they give a nice texture and add so much to the flavour so I always use them now. I eat it with a drizzle of maple syrup. Just perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","I didn't have my regular recipe handy decided to try something new and so glad I did. This bread pudding was so easy to make and tasted great. I used left over bun and rolls to make it. I did leave out the raisins since I'm the only one who likes them."
"0","5","Made it exactly as written and its wonderful..qalthough I did double it and used a 9 x 12. It took a little longer to bake, but GREAT!!!"
"0","5","Easy, great recepe. I took leftovers to eat at work (drizzled with honey)Mmmmm. Mine looked great as it came out the oven but then fell flat,(must admit I used 3 eggs) still - its the taste that counts and this is a Fab recepe, Thank you!!"
"0","4","Only alterations I made was I used french bread and kept the raisins out. But I found it to be very tasty and simple"
"0","5","Excellent! Didn't change anything and turned out great-"
"0","5","As another Reviewer did, I used the heels of a loaf of wheat bread, and some stale burger buns I have on hand; I used half cranberries, and half golden raisins, added a splash of grade 'B' maple syrup, and followed the directions. It smelled wonderful coming out of the oven, and will be dessert for tonight's dinner. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper, and will be used often for potlucks, and to put stale/misc bread bits to good use."
"0","5","I loved this recipe! Works as a breakfast and a dessert! I did cut down on the eggs though; 4 is a little much."
"0","5","I make this recipe all the time add extra raisins & it's delicious. Carolyn Swinimer"
"0","4","Loved this recipe! Think I added more bread than suggested and added a few pecans. Served warm with a butterscotch sauce. Very tasty."
"0","5","I used Sara Lee 100% multi-grain bread that was getting a little dried out, 7 slices is what I had left so I used it all. Used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with pumpkin spice liquid coffee creamer. OMG it was fabulous! Served with Cool Whip, we gobbled it down warm last night, but it was equally good cold out of the frig at lunchtime today. It's a keeper!"
"0","5","Used up the marked down cinnamon twist bread from the store. Added a handful of raisins (which really, really were a great addition) to the top. Made great, tasty leftovers too. Delicious to the end!"
"0","4","This was nice. I added walnuts and thinly sliced apples as well as nutmeg. Baked for almost an hr."
"0","5","Made this and it is so good, made it with cinnamon bread that had raisins in it. Used less sugar and was great. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","5","Good recipie"
"0","4","Looks great; I usually use Challah bread, but if you cd t find it or it's too costly, find a good dense bread or egg-like bread. And to help with keeping it moist, the bread pudding pan should be put in a water bath in the oven."
"0","4","when I make bread pudding I use a cinnamon swirl bread made by a local store and I add small diced up apples in mine ( and some over the very top and I use a raw sugar instead of white and I also sprinkle a little over the very top at the end so it has a little sweet glitter when its done! and I love the tops, they are the best part.. I also use 1 c milk and 1 cup of half and half instead of all milk. it makes it richer tasting and a thicker pudding. I also use just plain cream or half and half poured over it, it wont make it as soggy as jsut pouring milk over it will and god its good. I make it every winter with the apples off our trees. I have tried granny smiths as they add in a nice tartness with the sweetness or a ny cook cooking apple will work."
"0","5","The bread pudding can be vastly improved by peeling and coring a Granny Smith apple, and grating it over the bread after step 2. Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup, and replace 1 cup of milk with 1 cup half-and-half."
"0","5","Delicious! I used CRAISINS instead of raisins and it was so yummmmmy! Have made this several times .... it is just as good with raisins or craisins and I will try apple next time!"
"0","4","Pretty darn good. I used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup milk. Instead of all white sugar, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. It could probably stand to use a few more slices of bread."
"0","5","My family LOVED this recipe! I made it for breakfast one day and the whole pan was almost eaten! I used THREE eggs and used SEVEN slices of Cinnamon Swirl Bread. I used only a little bit of vanilla. But other than that, my family loved it very much! Thank you Allrecipes!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe, and healthy too! I used some ginger bread I had that was going to go stale. Added some salt, extra ginger, and nutmeg. Turned out amazing!!! I definitely recommend for making something new from older muffins/breads, etc."
"0","5","Great recipe! Made it with soy milk! Added crystallized mango too! ;)"
"0","5","I've made this twice, once as written and then once in large muffin tins so that I could keep track of servings and calories. When I used the tins, I made a smaller batch (1 small Draeger bagette, 3 eggs, 1c skim milk, 3T sugar, splash vanilla, dash cinnamon). 125 kC. Bottom line, excellent and very forgiving recipe. Definitely a keeper and great way to use up day old bread/ bagette. Thanks!"
"0","5","Simply delicious. I used leftover homemade bread and craisens. Even my toddler loved it, that's a strong endorsement!"
"0","5","This was my first bread pudding ever. It came out perfectly! The only change I made was a bit more bread. I had the ends of 2 loaves of bread and used probably about 8 more slices to full my 8x8 pan. I also used half and half as another reviewer suggested. I was delicious. My husband said he's going to be saving the stale bread from now on!"
"0","5","I added a fresh apple syrup and brown sugar on top for a good hard top."
"0","5","Loved this recipe. I will definitely be making this again soon. Must be served warm in my opinion so if it cools down too much, pop it back in the oven."
"0","5","easy to make - i used dried cranberries instead of the raisins this time."
"0","5","So easy and delicious and the family loves it! Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"0","4","liked it, I used brown sugar and reduce it for about 1/2 cup and add 10pcs mashed ripe banana. what a success, thank you."
"0","5","Great recipe and I made it almost exactly as described. Instead of regular bread I used cinnamon raisin French toast bread."
"0","3","This was ok but only if you add vanilla icing..."
"0","5","This recipe was easy and delicious! My only thought was I did something wrong, it says 30 mins prep time and my prep was about 5 mins. I'm not complaining about it though. It was yummy!"
"0","5","wonderfully yummy basic recipe!!! I added pomegranate and chocolate chips (and will add toasted pecans next time) and it was exactly what I was looking for."
"0","5","i made this today for breakfast and my family LOVED it thanks!"
"0","5","I love this recipe!!! It is extremely easy to make and really difficult to screw up. I've made it a dozen time with different beads and perfect every time. I'm not a fan of raisins so I typically omit them but I have tried this with apples, banana, peaches abs even white chocolate chips. Amazing every time!"
"0","5","Delish!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just use some good judgment on the eggs and sugar. If the bread is dry, then 4 eggs. Like it sweet, use all of the sugar. Recipes is solid and GREAT the way it is. Thanks."
"0","5","I was looking for a recipe for bread pudding that did not need whiskey or rum, but using ingredients I had at home, on hand. This was a DELIGHTFUL surprise. I will double this recipe next time, and probably add extra raisins, because I love them.  My mother in law and my mom both adored it too.  Here's how I changed it, and it still worked out perfectly: I used a combination of store brand honey whole wheat bread (6 slices) and 3 Hawaiian rolls (all a couple days old). I wanted a little extra bread b/c I didn't want it too eggy (as some previous reviewers mentioned.) I used a cup of whipping cream (b/c I had a small carton I wasn't going to use and I hated to see it go to waste) and a cup of 1% milk. I added a little extra cinnamon.   It was delicious, custard-y, sweet, good the day after, good cold or hot or warm. I would never think of pouring milk over this, but I would consider a scoop of vanilla ice cream over this warmed. It would be good as breakfast, or dessert.  Thanks for the original recipe!"
"0","5","I have made this bread pudding few times in the last half year. Everyone loves it every time I make it and it is absolutely easy recipe to follow, not requiring too many ingredients! Also a good way to get rid of old bread in the freezer. I use less sugar and butter plus wheat bread to make it a little healthier! :)"
"0","5","Easy and delicious. I used a sweet holiday bread with dried fruit and raisins in it, halved the sugar. It was so good I'm making it again tonight."
"0","5","I love this recipe. It is a great way to use up dry raisin bread. Make sure to press the bread down into the pan and if necessary add more bread cubes. Mine comes out perfet every time"
"0","5","I made this bread pudding recipe with sweet Hawaii rolls and crasins. It was great"
"0","5","I decided to try something new for Christmas dinner's dessert. I made 1-1/2 batch and added chopped pecans. Delicious! Everyone loved it. Great with a scoop of ice cream."
"0","5","Loved this...used pecans in place of raisins and it was just solo amazing"
"0","5","this was a great dessert. I made it for a play group and it was eaten all up. i would def make it again"
"0","5","I have been making this delicious breakfast/dessert substituting eggnog for the milk. This allows you to back off the sugar, and reduce the number of eggs to three, if you wish. It is definitely best made with a loaf of crusty bread, as opposed to a 2/3 of a loaf of regular bread. I substituted craisins last time I tried it, and next time will sprinkle a little grated orange zest on top for some added zing. Yummy!"
"0","5","The only thing wrong with the recipe is the prep time. It really only takes about 5 minutes, I had to wait longer for the oven to preheat than it took to prepare this. I was looking for an easy recipe for bread pudding, something I could make with a soft hero roll and whatever else I had on hand. I used the adjust recipe feature to downsize since I only had one roll. It worked perfectly, amazing results. I look forward to making it again."
"0","5","I can't cook worth ANYTHING. But this was so easy.. & it tastes wonderful!"
"0","5","it was really good!"
"0","5","Just made this tonight. I did, however, use banana bread and peanut butter banana bread I made a couple days ago instead of regular bread. I also made a vanilla sauce with mine. It was delicious! I can't wait to make this again with another bread! It was my first time making bread pudding too and it couldn't have been easier!"
"0","3","This was just okay for me. It was a bit mushy and the final product had flecks of 'scrambled' eggs in it. I used day old partial loaf of french bread. The amount of liquid in the recipe was just way too much. Read the reviews because several give great tips to combat these problems. I did not have a chance to read through them before I made this."
"0","4","I found it a bit too sweet for me. But i hv to thank u for the recipe :) easy n tasty"
"0","5","First attempt at bread pudding.... Loved it! Made some changes: used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, reduced eggs to three, added about 1/4 cup cinnamon cream rum (Chila 'Orchata), and added two overripe bananas while blending liquids until frothy. I was nervous using rock hard French bread, but a five minute soak prior to pushing down and baking made it super moist. Wasn't sure about the almond milk either, but it was delicious! Will make it again and again!"
"0","5","Made this today. Used cinnamon raisin swirl bread. Eliminated the cinnamon and cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup. Not only was this soooo easy, but it is fantastic. Shared some with my neighbor who thinks I'm the best cook...thanks to you guys!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe n it was excellent."
"0","5","YUMMY!! I used Pumpkin Swirl bread from Natures Own. I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for the Cinnamon and it was awesome. I have not made Bread Pudding before and this was so easy and tasty."
"0","5","Yummy"
"0","4","I used 3 eggs so it wasn't too eggy, and substituted 1/4 c of white sugar for brown sugar. Also added a touch of nutmeg and allspice. Yum!"
"0","5","Easiest to make and best tasting I've had!!"
"0","5","This was a very easy recipe, and it is also super delicious. I used only a half cup of sugar, and I topped it with maple syrup. Yum!"
"0","4","Made this recipe just yesterday and am eating leftovers for breakfast today! First time making bread pudding and it was great, although I did tweak it a bit so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I followed other reviews and used only 3 eggs as I really don't like eggy desserts, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown, used 8 slices of whole wheat bread (cut off most of the crust), 1% milk, and added a pinch of nutmeg and left out raisins as I didn't have any. Turned out delicious, like a pan full of cinnamon buns. It is sweet, but that works for me. Definitely will make again, with these adjustments - which are just personal preferences really."
"0","5","I used donuts instead but omitted the sugar - otherwise will be too sweet."
"0","5","Served this to a group of 50 people and had nothing but RAVE reviews. People who don't even like bread pudding absolutely loved this and begged for the recipe. Go figure,... plain old bread pudding! For reference, we did this with mostly whole grain bread and added some chopped nuts and chocolate chips before throwing it in the oven. Fantastic, easy, economical,...what more can you ask for?"
"0","5","Awesome!!! I used the recommendations from the other 'chefs'- heavy cream, fewer eggs. I used fresh raisin bread from Harris Teeter. Final result...EXCELLENT! I never thought I would be able to make a bread pudding to rival my grandmother's recipe."
"0","5","Very good. I made this with sliced apples on top rather than raisins, and 8 slices of bread. :)"
"0","5","mmmmmm really tasty. we loveed it. thanks for sharing."
"0","5","I just used what I had in the kitchen and substituted the milk with sour cream while adding 1/4 cup brown sugar. You could probably substitute almost any dairy for the milk and it would still turn out. Great taste and really simple. Will be making this again."
"0","5","So yummy! Instead of raisins I sprinkled chocolate chips over the top.and used Portuguese sweet rolls."
"0","4","This recipe was sooo simple!! I took half of the dry ingredients and tossed with bread before I put into pan. I also split the sugar to half brown and half white. One last alteration I used 1c milk, 1c 1/2 & 1/2. This recipes was perfect!!"
"0","5","Came out perfectly. The mister said of it, 'I could eat the whole pan'. I like any recipe that will get me that kind of response."
"0","5","My 11 year old granddaughter did this recipe today. My 7 year old granddaughter came in and took a bite and said this is delicious. Let's make it again. Neither of my granddaughters had tried bread pudding. I did it with cream instead of milk. And even though I didn't raisin, the bread pudding will be gone tonight. Especially at my granddaughter home that took 3/4 of it home. GREAT RECIPE"
"0","5","I make honey-Challah (with a splash of vanilla) in loaf pans, JUST to MAKE bread pudding (and French toast). Decrust, cube, and let go dry a few days, in the fridge. Top quality REAL cinnamon is a baking gotta-have! I use '5% oil Vietnamese'. I'm macerating this week's batch's white raisins in brandy.  The SAUCE is... pear-poaching liquid (leftover from LAST week's pear-almond tart) gently cooked down to a medium-brown syrup, then getting the surplus raisin-macerating brandy stirred in, to cool."
"0","5","We enjoyed this! Next time, I'll probably make it in a more shallow pan so that more of the bread has the crispy crunch of the exterior. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding more vanilla and cinnamon. Delicious!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe at my Mother-n-laws in WVA during a visit. I followed the recipe ingredients but heated the milk, butter,sugar, cinnamon, vanilla & raisins and let it set while I broke up the bread. I also used some stale glazed donuts. The raisins were plump by the time I was ready to add the mixture. It baked up beautifully. I opened a can of sweetened evaporated milk and poured it over the baked bread. Of this is optional as it is sweet..but delious!!! Everyone wanted the recipe!! :-)"
"0","5","Simplest is bestest. :)"
"0","5","This bread pudding is amazing! I left out the raisins and used peanut butter chips and chocolate chips instead... Plus my son has an egg allergy so I substituted the 1/4 banana for each egg and it turned out fantastic! Even better than the original recipe because it gave the dish a hint of fruity flavor :-)"
"0","5","This was simply delicious. Best bread pudding I have made. I followed other's suggestions and only used 3 eggs instead of 4. Baked in exactly 45 min. I made this for my Ecuadorian family that is not used to eating non-Ecuadorian food and they all loved it. I'm making it again tonight for my immediate family since last night everyone just got a small piece."
"0","5","I'm not a good cook, the recipe was easy to do and my family love it."
"0","4","Bread pudding may seem pedestrian but it really is handy on those 'stale-old bread days'. Yes, I think Cinnamon and vanilla are the best but I like to use lime or lemon rind when I have them. Hmmmmm! aroma is delicious. Further, there's the satisfaction, nothing is going to waste."
"0","5","The absolute best! I made 2 square pans with a double recipe and did NOT need to increase the baking time. I did watch the video and it helped. I saw how simple this is to put together and made it without a hitch. Used a whisk and not my electric mixer. Came out de-lish!"
"0","5","I liked it so much! Thank you ELLENMARIE! I used 300 g of white bread and 200 g of crushed gingerbread. Because of sweet gingerbread I decided to reduce the amount of sugar, so I used only 1 tbsp of it. Also I used only 3 eggs. Immediately after baking it's quite moist, but the next day with mascarpone and maple syrup it's just a paradise pleasure!"
"0","3","Bland"
"0","5","This was a great recipe. this was the first time I ever made bread pudding and it came out perfect. My kids loved it and I have made it twice since then. I did however only use 1-1/2 cups of milk and because I love raisins I used 1-cup of them."
"0","5","This was easy to make and it was delicious!!!! I cut the recipe in half because i'm the only one eating it,,, BUT next time, I'm making the whole recipe!!!!! I didn't change one ingredient,,, perfect the way it is!!"
"0","5","Recipe is great! I used whole wheat bread and brown sugar instead of white sugar. It was a we had it for dessert with some vanilla ice cream on top."
"0","5","made this last week and had too make some changes as I didn't have vanilla. I used maple flavouring and chopped apple, added three more slices of challah bread. My husband wanted me to make it again during the week as he ate it in three days"
"0","5","This recipe was delicious. I followed almost everything except I used pepperidge farm cinnamon raisin bread. I do agree that the bottom was a bit custard like, but I liked it. Next time I will take other reviewers suggestions and use three eggs instead of four. Definitely making this again."
"0","5","Yummmmo!! Very easy and delicious treat! This recipe is really easy to make, specially when you need a last minute hearty dessert or a nice 'comfort food' dessert in a cozy night :). Thank You Ellen Marie!! I used the left over of a homemade pear cake that it was dipped in orange liquor. Followed the recipe and substituted the sugar with organic agave. It was absolutely delicious!!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe! I added a 1/2 cup of pecans and it was so yummy."
"0","4","Great tasting bread pudding which my kids loved however it took over an hour baking time to get the pudding to set."
"0","5","My family loved this recipe it was quick and easy to prepare I gave it a 5 stars."
"0","4","tried this recipe for 6 servings with 4 bread and 2 eggs, 1/4 cup of sugar blahblahblah. So what I wanted to say is, it turned out very eggy and a tat too sweet. So probably one important thing to take note of is the egg to bread ratio. if you are interested in the 6 servings recipe, maybe try 5 bread and 2 eggs. the bread pudding will be more airy and fluffy instead of extremely moist and dense:D"
"0","5","Love this recipe. I did cut the sugar by just a bit. I doubled the recipe but only used 1 1/4 cup of sugar. I also love cinnamon so instead of the 2 tsp needed for a double recipe I used 4 tsp. I did cook it a bit longer as well. For a double recipe 60 minutes is about right. I took a 9x13 pan to church and there was nothing left and we are a small church. Oh, I did not use the raisins."
"0","5","I made this recipe and it is awesome. I did make a few changes. I used stale french bread and old doughnuts left from breakfast at work (1 cake, 2 vanilla cream filled doughnuts). I also added a pinch of nutmeg and used half & half cream instead of milk. Once I had blended the eggs, milk, vanilla and spices I pour it over the bread in a large bowl and stirred all the ingredients together. I then poured the ingredients into a 9x9 brownie pan."
"0","5","I tried this and it was excellent! I used 3 more slices of bread, used Sun maid raisin swirl bread and heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I also added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg . I used turbinado sugar instead of white and served it warm with warm vanilla sauce I found on this site. Yummy!,"
"0","4","Yummy! I used about 10 Kings Hawaiian Dinner Rolls, half/half instead of the milk and left out the raisins. I baked it in an 8x11 glass pan and made one-half of the bread as per the recipe and on the other half I sprinkled it with shredded coconut and chopped walnuts. It was so yummy that I could have probably eaten the whole pan by myself. I read other reviews where the said that it either tasted egg-y or like french toast and I did not have either of those issues, but I did try it right out of the oven and the texture was definitely off, so my suggestion is to let it sit, so that the flavors can meld; it was so much better after it cooled."
"0","5","omg i just made this using fresh brioche from the shop because i didnt have any stale bread. and it worked perfectly!!! the only changes i made was i only use 3 eggs and reduce the milk by 1 1/2 cup as it was plenty. i used 1/2 c sugar and sprinkle the top with brown sugar to give that crispy sugary top.... loving it.... thank you :)"
"0","4","the taste was great, but next time ill reduce the milk to 1 1/2 cup, and reduce the eggs to 3 since the bread was soggy-ish on the inside and overcooked on the outside even though i used 8 pieces of bread.***UPDATE*** I refrigerated the pudding and it tastes MUCH better this way with vanilla sauce poured on top. However, i will still reduce the egg and milk next time to avoid overcooking the pudding, which i had to do this time."
"0","5","Wonderful and easy! Even I didn't mess it up. Anyone can do this...and not waste bread! I added a glaze made from confectioner's sugar, milk and vanilla for added sweetness."
"0","5","Thank You for this wonderful recipe. It was simple, well guided step by step and delicious. I did reduce the sugar about 1/4 cup from the original given measurement, but this is to your personal preference. I ran out of raisins, instead i sprinkle some cubed green apple. Taste great too. Happy trying !!!"
"0","4","Good recipe, but I made the following changes and it turned out quite tasty. Used chocolate milk instead of regular. Added about 1/2-3/4 cup chocolate chips, appx. 1/4 cup butterscotch chips, 1/4-1/2 cup crushed walnuts. No raisins. sprinkled brown sugar on top. When it was done, we ate it with whipped cream. Yum!"
"0","5","This was fantastic and so easy to make. I actually used whole wheat bread and splenda instead of sugar. It was delicious! Thanks for posting the recipe."
"0","5","I used cinnamon raisin bagels,it turned out great!!!!!"
"0","5","Great basic bread pudding! Love that it uses basic ingredients one normally has on hand and is so easy to make. I tweaked a bit. Had some coconut milk I needed to use up so used a cup of that in place of all milk. added coconut extract in addition to the vanilla. Finally, I used only half the sugar and then replaced the other half with organic raw agave. Delicious and with half the sugar hit!"
"0","5","This recipe is so simple to make and delicious. I added a half teaspoon of nutmeg. It was a little too sweet for my taste with the raisins. Next time I will cut back a little on the sugar. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Love it. is just like my mom made it. I even topped it with warm Birds custard pudding like she did"
"0","5","This was VERY easy to make, and sooo delicious! Since i was out of raisins and nuts  I sprinkled sugar crystals over the top. I also used half brown sugar and half white. Even the picky toddler of the house gobbled his piece up and wanted more! I give this 2 thumbs up!"
"0","4","Great recipe to start as a base. I tripled the amount of bread and used four times more milk and doubled everything else."
"0","5","Very good... I cannot wait to make a few variations... This time I added carmel sauce... this is going to be a downfall!"
"0","5","This turned out great! I doubled the butter and substituted dried blueberries instead of raisins! Will be making this again!"
"0","4","This is a great way to use up leftover stale bread. I served it warm with whipped cream and included the raisins."
"0","5","excellent recipe@very easy to make,everybody loved it"
"0","5","~~thank you for sharing your recipe. i made this today and it was a big hit! i'm now looking for cookie recipes."
"0","5","This bread pudding is fantastic, a big hit with everyone in the family, even the kids who usually cringe at the idea of bread pudding. I actually doubled the recipe with no problems, except for the sugar, I felt that was plenty. The results were wonderful, this is a keeper of a recipe!!"
"0","5","Absolutely yummy! Great warm with vanilla ice-cream! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","This recipe is very good, and real easy to make."
"0","5","*****This is a great and quick recipe. I did alter it with some left over bananas and walnuts. I threw in some blueberries. The smell and look was perfect. Love it! Highly recommend."
"0","5","I just tried this recipe and followed exactly like the recipe called for. Had to bake for 55 min but other than that---GREAT and so simple to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"0","4","I used a coffee creamer. York with mint, didn't like it in my coffee, used 2 cups and 3 eggs also 6 large slices of sourdough bread. Turned out well."
"0","5","So easy! Instead if raisins, I used dried cranberry or dried blueberry. Good with that too. Also tried it with semi sweet choc chips. Very yummy..."
"0","5","This is simple, easy, and delicious! A co-worker of mine works part-time at Panera, and he brings in day-old bread pretty often. I take whatever looks like a plain, white bread and use it to make this treat for the office!"
"0","4","It's my first time making bread pudding and I must say that I'll keep on preparing it using this wonderful recipe. I made few changes to bring in some flavor and it tasted sublime. I'm not a huge fan of raisins so what I did is I cut a few dried apricots into small pieces and added just a few raisins. Also I used white bread and whole wheat brown bread and as for the sugar I used white sugar and brown sugar (I also sprinkled some on top). It was seriously 'yummyful'"
"0","5","Wonderful. My family asks for this all the time, though they make me leave out the raisins - and I double the cinnamon and vanilla! So great, even cold, even the next day in the mirowave."
"0","5","Fantastic, I used Panatonni bread with raisins in and fresh nutmeg and brown sugar, I'm going to make this again, my husband loved it, so easy and great receipe"
"0","5","I've only made this once but it was great. Everyone really enjoyed it. I did use the cinnamon raisin bread instead of regular bread."
"0","4","My husband loves this. I did not add rainis. But I did mash some banana. Almost like banana bread."
"0","5","came out perfect and yummy. now i have to find a vanilla custard to top it with"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious; quick and easy....great recipe!"
"0","4","Pretty good, family liked it. I would add a bit more spices. It had to bake longer than expected."
"0","5","I have been looking for a good bread pudding recipe for quite some time. I read this last Friday and decided to try it the next day - because it looked so simple and recieved rave reviews. I was not disaapointed.  The ratio of milk to eggs is the key to its success. I baked it for 55 mins instead of the suggested 45. As for ingredients, you can play around wiht them as much as you want. I'm already planning bread pudding for next weekend. Toasted coconut and very well drained crushed pineapple - instead of raisins & cinnamon."
"0","5","This is some what like the recipe I have. My family loves bread pudding. who would think something so simple is so goooooood."
"0","5","Very Yummy! I did make some adjustments and normally I try to follow the recipe to the T. However, I had left over hamburger buns that needed to be used up, so I doubled the recipe using a 9x13 pan which was perfect. I used 13 buns and 7 eggs b/c another review stated that it was a little too 'eggy'. I also used the blueberry flavored cranberries b/c I didn't have raisens on hand. All in all it was very good. Definetley will make again and try other add ins. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!"
"0","5","Super easy and tasty! The recipe is flexible to have it more 'eggy' add a little more liquid mixture or less for a drier version. I added a little nutmeg because I like it with cinnamon. It was awesome and made the house smell wonderful! A great way to use heels of bread so not to waste :) I think I will try adding some apple slices on top for another option next time or even cranberries!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! I love sweet bread pudding and this one is it! I use an iced fritter bread from my local bakery to make it even better! The only thing I changed was the amount of bread used. I use enough bread to soak up all the egg mixture, which tends to be well over the small loaf of bread from the bakery!"
"0","5","This was perfect. My wife has never liked bread pudding (hates raisins) but she raved about this one. I recently started baking bread and this worked great with the older 1 day and 2 day old leftover loaves. I think I'll try adding some brown sugar next time to make up for the missing raisins. My kids loved it, too!"
"0","5","I love this receipe. I tried it for the first time and my husband actually said it was good. I beat the eggs one at a time like they recommended it too and it made it fluffier. We ate the whole thing in 2 days."
"0","5","I have never made bread pudding, but the number of positive reviews sold me on this recipe. I used 1/3 cup of sugar, and 1 and 3/4 milk, and 1/4 cup of butterscotch schnapps that I had on hand. Delicious!"
"0","4","Added extra raisins and some dried cranberries, used Eggnog instead of milk, and it turned out great."
"0","5","Perfect bread pudding! It was so light and fluffy and got rave reviews from my family.  I used 3 eggs per the other reviews (they were small ones which made me nervous, but it turned out great), and also 1/2 cup of sugar. I used french loaf with the crusts cut off and cause i didn't have enough, i used a bit of hawaiian king bread. I soaked some raisins in whiskey, and sprinkled those on top. Everything else was per the recipe exactly. I did let the break pudding hang out in the fridge for about four hours before cooking. I also made a whiskey sauce to pour on top from the 'bread pudding with whiskey sauce' recipe. It was really awesome. Highly recommended. Pretty awesome."
"0","5","This recipe is great and very easy to make .my family loves it I'm so glad I found it .Its a keeper!!"
"0","5","this turned out rather tasty! the only thing i tweaked was cutting down the sugar to 1/2 cup since i don't like my desserts to be super sweet. i used golden raisins since i'm a fan, and i used day old sourdough bread which worked really well. next time i'm going to add some rum to the liquid mix =)"
"0","5","So very easy to make and it was wonderful! Substituted low sugar, dried cranberries for the raisins and made a bourbon sauce to pour over it. The leftovers (there's only 2 of us!)heated up well in the microwave."
"0","5","First time making it, made double batch with 7 eggs, used Almond/Coconut milk. I used home made bread that uses coconut oil, and has a light coconut flavor. I put raisins in, next time I'll try adding shredded coconut. It's a bit sweet, next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup (for single batch). Otherwise it turned out great!"
"0","5","Super easy and delicious. I've made it twice now. Once with raisins and another time without. Both times were pure heaven. I used low-fat milk but added 4TBS melted butter, and 1/2 cup sugar."
"0","5","What a simple and delicious recipe! I first made this when I had a loaf of pumpkin bread that was less than fresh and didn't want to waste it. It was so good! I can't wait to make it for my Mom when she visits. She is a huge bread pudding fan."
"0","5","Delicious"
"0","5","I used old challah rolls from thanksgiving, I added 1/2 teaspoon of maple syrup extract and rum flavoring extract. It was wonderful. I ate it with apple pie topping. This is a really good recipe."
"0","5","EXCELLENT version. Made this twice already. YUMMY"
"0","5","only thing I changed in this recipe was that I used Hawaiian bread, it was delicious."
"0","5","I love this and make it all the time! It is best bread pudding I have had anywhere."
"0","4","Liked the recipe, just added more liquid and nutmeg to mine and didn't add the raisins. They enjoyed it very much..."
"0","5","This is easily, one of the best (and easiest!) bread pudding recipes I've ever tried. Even better, it's one of the few things my husband asks me to make on a regular basis."
"0","5","This is my new favorite bread pudding recipe! The first time I made it, it was a bit too sweet. I have put in as little as 1/4 c. of sugar, and it still tastes amazing!"
"0","5","Great recipe. Will be making this one again. Thank you!"
"0","5","Came out awesome! I made minor changes. I doubled all ingredients, used 8 - 10 cups of cubed bread, about 3 1/2 cups milk, added 1/2 cup brown sugar, dash of clove & nutmeg, cooked rasins and walnuts in water and meyers rum. Drizzled a litte rum at the end over saturated bread and sprinkled cinnamon sugar mixture over the top. Came out awesome and next time may add fruit as some have suggested. Will make again."
"0","5","Prep time was only 5 minutes. Made double recipe. A+++ rating"
"0","5","The best i have ever made!!!! I put a powdered sugar glaze on this. My family eats it up like crazy!!!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I cut out the cinnamon and for the bread I used the 'Amish White Bread' recipe from this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/amish-white-bread/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=amish white bread&e8=Quick Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe) My 3 yr old loved it! Yummy!!"
"0","5","Wonderful Recipe just as it is !! I made a second batch adding some peaches along with the raisins, yum!"
"0","5","This was so easy to make! And my family LOVED it! I drizzled powdered sugar icing over it before serving it and OMG amazing lol"
"0","5","This was outstanding!  I used Panera's loaf bread so I just estimated the amount of bread, about 3 days old, and whole milk. The dish was great warm but became even more spectacular after a couple days in the refrigerator and the flavors had set.   The first time I had only regular sliced bread and it was good but not great. I used almond extract and it was a bit weird. This is not a recipe you need to change!"
"0","5","Just made this. I didn't have raisins so I used dried cranberries. I used a half of a two day old baguette. Absolutely delicious! I can't believe I've never made bread pudding before. It's so nice!"
"0","5","Used this recipe to turn a days-old baguette into a delicious bread pudding. Used only 1/2 cup of sugar, left out the raisins, used half nutmeg and half cinnamon. Delicious with cream and honey, or with yoghurt!"
"0","5","Absolutely incredible! This recipe is excellent for ingredient experimentation, since the main ingredients go so well with other additions. My current favorite variation is to mix in coconut flakes and chopped walnuts, then add dollops of poppyseed filling right before it goes in the oven ( be warned - you might not get any if other people find out you're making it this way)."
"0","5","This turned out awesome! I used home-made bread that I made the previous day, and added a little pureed pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. It was devine."
"0","5","This recipe was absolutely right on target. I had a loaf of panettone bread from Xmas past and the expiration date indicated it was still good, so rather than throwing it away I decided to use it in this recipe for the bread. I also used 1/2 cup of sugar (since the panettone is a sweet bread) and changed that further by using 2T of Splenda Blend with 2T of Splenda Brown Sugar (Splenda takes 1/2 of regular sugar). I soaked the raisins in boiling water before adding (they were on the dry side and wanted them moist). Everything else was the same. It was the perfect comfort food!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe, it was just like my grandmother's. I wanted to try something different, so instead of raisins I used frozen strawberries and cut them into pieces. My husband and 2yr old loved it! I will be trying with many more fruit!"
"0","5","I used blackberries and omitted the cinnamon for this -- also substituted half light cream with the milk. Phenomenal!"
"0","5","A hit at my house. This is an awesome recipe easy and so good."
"0","5","This is now my favorite bread pudding recipe. I followed someone's advice and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I used up some leftover french bread to make this. I served it with Byrd's custard sauce."
"0","5","Excellent! Made this for the folks last night for dessert. I used a tad more raisins than the recipe called for, but my mother-in-law, who doesn't like raisins, ate it anyway! My father-in-law said to keep this recipe handy. Next time I might chocolate chips or fruit or both!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe a few times now and LOVE it! I used chocolate chips instead of raisins since that's what I had in the house. It is delicious hot or cold if you have any leftovers."
"0","5","The pudding turned out nice .added a few cinnamon chips. jst thought of trying some thing different.it turned out lovely.had it with orange caramel sauce ."
"0","5","Spectacular. No other words to describe this amazing simple recipe. This will be the only bread pudding recipe I ever make."
"0","5","This was really delicious! I made the following changes: 3 eggs, 1% milk, 1/4c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar. I also used Challah. It was soo yummy!"
"0","5","Just a great, simple and versatile recipe. Use whatever bread or fruit you have available. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Super easy recipe with fantastic results! The texture was perfect and a great way to use up my homemade bread before it went bad. I left out the raisins and made a vanilla whipped cream and the second time I used dried cranberries instead of raisins...both times delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"0","5","This makes a wonderfully sweet and creamy bread pudding. I used 4 cups of bread cubes from a crusty baguette. I also added 1 tsp. nutmeg and lightly sprinkled about 1/2 tsp. of sugar on top before baking. Really yummy."
"0","5","Yummy this was the easiest I've ever tryed, I did just like they said except I added a little brown sugar and sprinkled some on the top. My husband who doesn't like bread pudding even liked it he went in for seconds."
"0","1","It smelled of Eggs and I felt I was eating a sweet omelet :( Sorry but I am not gonna make it again"
"0","5","This is a great recipe! I've never made this before and added the raisins. Super-yummy! Not a huge fan of raisins so I think I'll keep them out but it's great either way. The measurements for the spices is dead-on!"
"0","5","Delicious! Making it more often. Very Nice texture"
"0","5","This is so good and very easy to make. I had never made this before because I thought this was a complicated dish to make. I was shocked how very easy this was and so delicious. I will definitely be making this again."
"0","5","Who knew bread pudding was so easy to make! This recipe was simple and delicious. My husband is very picky about bread pudding and he loved it! I used a sauce from anotehr recipe and together they were amazing."
"0","5","I have been making this recipe forever. I have this exact same recipe that I got from my Betty Crocker cookbook from the 1950's. It is my fav of all time."
"0","2","I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. I used some of the best bread, but was completely underwhelmed with the custard. I followed the directions. Maybe using cream instead of milk, or maybe adding some more spice and little more sugar would have made this better. I won't be using this recipe again."
"0","4","Yum! This was really tasty and a great way to help use up some of my chickens eggs. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for my family."
"0","5","Perfect! Taste just like what Mom made when I was growing up. I just shredded some dinner rolls I had left over. I also used part sugar, part Stevia and it tasted great!"
"0","5","Excellent! I used plain old white bread (even the heels) that I would normally have thrown away. I used 2% milk and only 3 eggs. I forgot about the suggestion of brown sugar, so I decided to sprinkle some on the top before baking (not sure if this did anything) We topped it with Cool Whip; it was very good and rich tasting! Will definitely make again!"
"0","4","It was nice and all but need a little more sweetened, over great recipe"
"0","4","Straightforward and easy recipe. Added 1/4cup of brown sugar and used 3 eggs instead of four as other people suggested. Easy and tasty!"
"0","5","Turned out amazing !!!!!!"
"0","5","I used a loaf of cranberry walnut sourdough to make this with and instead of raisins added dried cranberries. It was very good!"
"0","5","Phenomenal!!!! I like a lot of spices, so I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and a little freshly grated ginger. Also, I used leftover homemade challah, it was awesome! And SOO simple!"
"0","4","I doubled this recipe for 9x13 dish but used whipping cream instead of milk and Pepperidge Farm Cinnimon bread. I'm not sure if it was the whipping cream but this recipe came out more like bread cake than pudding. Is it supposed to be like a cake? I will make this again and add more cream. Othwerwise, this was simply delicious!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it was absolutely wonderful. I do agree with some other reviewers with the amount of sugar and so the next time I will probably cut back a little but besides that it was scrumptious. The texture was tender and it was truly tasty. The best bread pudding recipe I have tried and it will remain the go to recipe for me. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This was my first time ever making bread pudding. It came out perfect! For those of you that had trouble with the consistency, I think it's because the recipe doesn't specify whether to use thick or thin slices. I used very thick slices of bread, and the ratio of custard to bread was perfect. If you use thin slices, it will be too eggy. Also, I think stale bread would work best, as noted in the recipe, but I used soft bread and it turned out great too. I probably won't use raisins next time, but all in all this is definitely a keeper! I couldn't stop eating it!"
"0","5","I usually make rice pudding instead of bread pudding, but after making this recipe I might never go back! Love the custard-y consistency, perfect amount of sweetness for me--really delicious. I skipped the melted butter, added a dash of nutmeg, and cooked 10 minutes longer than recommended. Yum."
"0","5","Delicious! Made this tonight with a loaf of cranberry/pumpkin seed bread I bought off the discount shelf last night. So good! I've never made bread pudding before. This was incredibly easy."
"0","5","I just made this recipe for the first time. It was so good it is now in my 'all time favorite recipe' box! The only change I made was to use a polish bread with currents, similar to a challah bread. Wonderful taste and so easy! Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","I have now done it twice. I use Challa Bread. It makes it so fluffy and delicious. You have to use only 4-5 slices depending how thick you cut it."
"0","5","I used half a loaf of french bread from Safeway and substituted the raisins for chocolate chips and it became a dessert. It was so hard to stay away from and I am sure I could have eaten the whole pan! So so yummy!!"
"0","4","This was good!! I've used this recipe a few times now, and I just made it again. This time I used only one cup of milk, and it got crunchy on top--- the way I like it!! It also took about 20 minutes shorter to be done... I don't know why it calls for so much milk!  I'll experiment a little more with bread pudding. Not one recipe fits all, but this is a good base to work from. I added chopped apple to mine."
"0","3","great for bread pudding, but nobody except me seemed to like bread pudding n the house"
"0","5","Great recipe. I however did provide a bit of a change to as many others did. I made the bread pudding as directed (minus the raisins) then sprinkled on top proir to baking one cup of pecans and two peeled, cored and chopped granny smith apples. I increased the baking time by 20 minutes and it came out perfect. I served it warm with a home made carmel sauce and boy did I get raves from all my guests!!"
"0","5","Just finished hoovering this pudding. Awesome!! Made only 1 change, reduced sugar a little less than 1/2 cup. I followed the rest to the dot. Thank you Ellenmarie!!"
"0","4","This dish is awesome. I didn't have day old bread, so cubed up a loaf of Italian bread and toasted it very lightly in the oven. This was probably unnecessary though since the bread was very crusty. I loved it, but I think I will play around adding some other flavors to it to give it that five star potential."
"0","5","Possitively divine! Very easy to make. It was especially scrumptous because I used Spice Island Pure Vanilla Extract. I also added raisin for my raisin-loving husband."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. I had a dozen leftover pumpkin spice muffins and used that instead of bread. I used three eggs (per other reviews). It turned out moist and very flavorful. I will definitely use this recipe again."
"0","5","Very yummy! Did not use day-old bread, but it's perfect for using up all those heels we always have left over. :-)"
"0","4","Very easy recipe with simple ingredients I already had in my kitchen. I followed the recipe exactly and the pudding came out perfect. The bread I used was pretty dense and the slices were pretty large. I drizzled half and half on the finished product just before serving. Delicious!"
"0","5","This was so easy and just what I need as I didn't have heavy cream. I substituted half and half for the milk and challah bread for regular bread. Just came out of the oven and had a quick bite. It was yummy! Just needs a sauce to elevate it to the next level and a dollop of whipped cream."
"0","5","This recipe is so easy and delicious. Thanks :)"
"0","5","I made this for breakfast and it was SO good and easy enough that I didn't mind putting it together when I rolled out of bed. A great way to use up leftover bread. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","Yum yum. I made this exactly as the recipe said (I like to do that the first time I make it and then tweak it if need be) It was delicious. As per my families request,I made it again tonight. Great recipe."
"0","5","Great!"
"0","5","Tried it first time today ,tasted so good .Didn't have raisins so added chopped dates and almonds."
"0","4","Easy and delicious! I accidentally put 1-1/2 cups raw sugar in this and it wasn't too sweet."
"0","5","WOW this was so good! I doubled and used a whole loaf of french bread in a 9x13 pan - it had to stay in the over a bit longer when doubled. So good cold or warm! Thank you for this recipe! I am making it again this week!"
"0","4","Glad I chose this recipe. So quick and easy to put together! Good taste, not too sweet. I added a handful of raisins and chopped walnuts. The extra crunch was nice."
"0","5","delish"
"0","5","LOVED this recipe! It is definitely a custard texture, but we enjoyed that aspect. I only made a few changes: Used 10 bread slices (instead of 6), 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream and 1 cp whole milk (instead of just milk), 1/2 cp brown sugar, 1/4 cp white sugar (instead of all white sugar). And then I use the remaining 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream to make whipped topping for the pudding. Yum!"
"0","5","This was delicious! I was looking for a way to use up some old bread and leftover french toast from breakfast. My son and I filled up half the pan with leftover cinnamon bread and half the pan with leftover french toast. Both came out very tasty. We also used light 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk (b/c we had a leftover container from making ice cream the week before.) No topping necessary with this yummy recipe!"
"0","5","This is so easy to make and so delicious!!! I added almonds to it also. This will be my go-to dessert!"
"0","4","I like this recipe for it's simplicty. This is how I make French toast. All the wet and seasoning in the blender and let the good times rock. I'm trying less sugar and stale jelly donuts for bloody bread pudding. I'll let you know!"
"0","5","welcome to memory lane taste just like my mom recipe love-it thanks"
"0","5","Delicious!!!! I did use a water bath to bake it. I also used raisin bread too with a handful of pecans thrown in. Lastly, topped it off with a vanilla rum sauce."
"0","5","LOVE IT! Very easy to make and very yummy to eat =)"
"0","5","Very good & easy - especially if you find a sauce of your liking to put on top of a serving."
"0","5","Best Bread Pudding EVER!!!"
"0","5","So delicious and not soggy! I used cinnabon cinnamon bread and plumped the raisians before adding them. Family gobbled it up!"
"0","5","Changed up just a bit. Used half and half not milk added black walnuts, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and ginger and I used Ciabatta bread. This was delicious!! My husband lovvveeedddd it. We had this as desert with a little double vanilla ice-cream and whipped cream as topper. This was a very easy recipe to add your own flavor to. Enjoy"
"0","5","One of the best braead puddings I have made in a verey long time, my husband would only eat his mother's bread pudding that she taught me to make years ago before she passed away, but he said he really loves this, so I think I will bhe making this one from now on Thanks"
"0","5","Excellent and easy! My husband was so happy he ate three helpings, and he isn't even a dessert person. I do have a dairy intolerent child, so I substituted the milk with vanilla almond milk. (butter doesn't seem to affect him) It was delicious and creamy."
"0","4","This is a great recipe to keep on hand for when you have some old bread to use up. I used brown sugar instead of white but didn't change anything else."
"0","4","Excellent and easy dessert.. Doubled the recipe and my family had it gone before bedtime.."
"0","5","This was the first time I had ever made bread pudding and it was SO DELICIOUS!!!! I used Cinnabon Bread from the store like some others had suggested and it was amazing!! Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream and you are in heaven!!!!!"
"0","5","I love this recipe it is so easy and my family loves it!!!"
"0","5","very good and old fashion"
"0","4","Good"
"0","3","I tried this recipe. I give it 3 stars. It tasted good but for some reason the eggs got scrambled up inside the pudding. I don't know why"
"0","5","So simple and easy to make!"
"0","5","I can't even begin to describe how delicious this recipe is! I prepared this recipe, however changed butter to I Can't believe it's not butter (Lite), used Sara Lee 45 calorie 100% multi grain bread slices, 1% Lowfat milk and it was still delicious. Did I say 'Delicious'? OMG! My husband and loved it. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","SO GOOD! I was craving bread pudding that night and i use whatever ingredient i can find in the pantry. Surprisingly i find the taste to be better the next day when i had refrigerated overnight. =)"
"0","5","LOVED it! I took the advice of some others and used only 3 eggs. I omitted the raisins and used a caramel sauce from another bread pudding recipe on this site. So good and would recommend it to everyone! :)"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! A perfect treat on a cold winter night."
"0","4","Great recipe! Like others suggested I used only 3 eggs and kept it in the oven for about 10 minutes more."
"0","4","I made this to take to a friend's house for dinner, and it was a big hit! Super easy, and made with ingredients that most of us have in our pantry every day!"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","This turned out beautifully, I served this with a simple whiskey sauce, very good, thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","i left out the raisins and use only 3 eggs because i read the reviews that told me so and it happen to be a good decision! the pudding is not 'eggy' and my family love it!"
"0","4","i feel sad that i had to vote it a 4 star n not 5. only because of one thing: eggs. just like other reviews sate, it curdles at the bottom almost like sweet soggy scrambled eggs. next time ill just cut the egg measurement in half. other than that flaw, amazing taste! oh n i drizzled the top with sweet condensed milk. a delicious warm treat!"
"0","5","Delicious! My husband used to have this as a kid and has always wanted me to make it. Well i tried it tonight and he was blown away. He said it was even better than he remembered :) I can't believe how easy it was. We had it warm with whipped cream. So yummy. I think we now have a new family favorite."
"0","5","AMAZING!!! I used homemade day old white bread and made a homemade caramel rum sauce to go on top. I also added some nutmeg for flavor. This is THE BEST!!"
"0","5","This is a very easy recipe. I used a smaller bowl and had leftover milk/egg binder, so naturally I made a second bowl! We didn't have any leftover bread, so I used other leftovers from the holidays: three slices of apple pie, two servings of spice cake and one cinnamon-raisin bagel. Also I used almond extract instead of vanilla. It turned out delicious!"
"0","5","My 89 year old mom loves bread pudding. I baked some cream puffs the other day and hadn't stuffed them yet and thought I'd try the recipe using them. It just came out of the oven and I scooped out a serving for mom - she loves it! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"0","5","Loved it! I used yeast rolls left from Christmas, raisins soaked in Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum, and just 3 eggs from my hens. Topped it off with left over cream cheese frosting from my Carrot Cake! Yum!"
"0","5","Easy! I used cinnamon bread and since I hadn't left it out overnight I popped it in the oven for a few minutes to get it a bit hard like old bread.. Then I omitted the raisins and added a cup of walnuts... YUMMY everyone loved it, topped with a Simple sause I found online of milk sugar vanilla butter and flour... Easy elegant yummy recipe!"
"0","5","This was delicious! I had leftover homemade bread from Christmas Eve. I used that and substitued heavy cream for half the milk just because I had some to use up. I used dried cherries also and soaked the bread in the custard for 20 minutes before baking. It came out perfect and I topped it with some fresh whipped cream. Even the kids thought it was good - will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","I made this this morning for breakfast with my 4yr old daughter. It was super easy to make and it was delicious! I just added a little nutmeg for our own taste."
"0","5","WONDERFUL! Tastes better than moms. :-)"
"0","5","mmm~ this bread pudding was ridiculously good! and it was sooo easy to make! :-) i used 3 eggs and a little less than 2 cups of milk. awesome recipe! thanks ellenmarie!"
"0","4","Very good and very simple! I used cinnamon swirl bread. Next time I will add raisins. It was a hit with the family on Thanksgiving!"
"0","5","Simple! I had to double it for a 9x13 for the family. Used half white bread and half wheat bread. I cut the crusts off, added fresh ground nutmeg, and cut back 1 egg... the rest was the same. Awesome!"
"0","5","I used dinner rolls (about 10), 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the white and 1 cup of heavy cream in place of one of the cups of milk. Very, very good!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! It is so simple that you think it couldnt be so great , but it is! I made a rum vanilla sauce for the top but it really didn't need it!"
"0","5","I have made this at least a dozen times. I always have the ingredients on hand and it takes only a minute to throw together. I usually add raisins. It is company worthy if served with homemade caramel or butterscotch rum sauce."
"0","4","I thought this was very good. I sprinkled extra cinnamon prior to putting it in the oven. I think it will be even better with a cinnamon bread next time. I would serve this the first day. The second day wasn't as good. I also thought better warmed and would be good with a vanilla bean ice cream or whipped topping (while warm of course)"
"0","5","Excellent recipe, we use this with our youth group. They tear up left over hotdog buns and we add pecans on top. Always a loved dessert at fundraisers. Of course we always add frosting. yummmm!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and delicious! Everyone loved it.!"
"0","5","Wow! This was great - just like the bread pudding at my favorite restaurant without the 45min drive. Everyone loved this. I made 2 batches and they all went and everyone wanted the recipe. I used cinnamon raisin bread, skipped the additional raisins, and topped with a caramel rum sauce I found. So easy and so good!"
"0","4","Great starter recipe! I got pretty close to the measurements, I think. And it tasted almost exactly like pumpkin pie! I used homemaade bread that I diced into pieces and dried out in the oven at 200 degrees for forty minutes, then I mixed it all together and let it sit for a couple hours. Delish!"
"0","5","I scaled this recipe down to 3 serving and baked it in an individual crock. It was delicious and just the right size for 2 people."
"0","4","This recipe was good, but it needed some nuts. Perhaps some almonds and/or walnuts!!"
"0","5","I used this recipe as a guide and it was delish! I used Pepperidge Farm Cranberry Swirl Bread and I heated up the milk and melted some chocolate into it. I also used Ideal sweetener in place of sugar, but that didn't change the taste. I just wanted less sugar since I added the chocolate. It was amazing!!!!!! I will be making this again, and soon!!!! Possibly with chocolate milk!"
"0","5","by far the best of all the best i`ve tried in this site!"
"0","5","Fabulous! My husband loved this...and I ended up making a second batch the same week! Thank you!"
"0","5","this came out AMAZING! I used 3 different types of bread (white, cinnamon, and cinnamon raisin) and I could eat the whole tray myself! Only thing I did differently from the recipe provided was I used 3 eggs instead of 4 since so many of the reviews i read suggested it was too eggy. Thank you for this recipe!! Next time I make it I'm gonna sprinkle coconut on top and add some chocolate chips =D"
"0","4","As written, this recipe gets 3 stars. It's simply not flavorful enough. I substituted the raisins for blueberries with GREAT results--the blueberries leaked their juice all over for some great blueberry-vanilla flavor. This recipe works great with soy milk, too!"
"0","4","very good"
"0","4","So yummy!"
"0","5","My family all loved this pudding! My picky 17 year old even had two helpings! The only thing I changed was I used half milk and half cream (I didn't have half and half as someone had suggested). We topped it with whipped cream, but it was wonderful without it. I also used craisins in place of the raisins. Yummy bread pudding."
"0","3","While this is a good basic recipe for bread pudding, I found it to be bland and definitely in need of a little something extra. I made a sauce out fo butter, brown sugar and Drambuie to spoon over the top, and they certainly did the trick, especially with some bananas sauteed in it, and my roommate enjoyed it a lot with ice cream. I just really wasn't bowled over."
"0","5","Amazing! I made this today and added some raspberry jam for extra flavour and used whole wheat bread and it was delicous! I will be making it again soon :)"
"0","5","Yum! Reminds me of my grandaunt's bread pudding."
"0","4","This is very good and easy! I sprinkled raisins on only half of the bread, which pleases everyone in my household."
"0","5","this is the easiest bread pudding ever. i make my own bread with the bridgeford frozen dough and use that in the pudding. its really good!"
"0","5","Great recipe! My husband is from Southern Virginia, I'm from the westcoast. We don't make bread pudding there. I made this for the first time from this recipe. It worked out great, cept I took the others advise and sprinkled cinnamon on top of the bread, and extra nutmeg and added sprinkled brown sugar on top. Excellent!!!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe...I am eating it right now ...LOVE IT :)"
"0","5","Yummy! This was the easiest recipe I could find and everyone liked it...thumbs up!"
"0","4","I was pretty impressed with this recipe. It might not have been all that I had hoped, but it was still good. It did make my tummy hurt, though! It was really simple to make, I'm only 15, and even my mama liked it (she doesn't like soggy stuff) I recommend using the vanilla sauce recipe from this site too, like Amy Lampert suggested. It was very satisfying and filling. You should make it too (: -Amanda"
"0","4","I did enjoy this bread pudding a lot and it was a very convenient way of getting rid of my bread. However, I think it needed a little less egg and a bit more flavor. Overall, though, it was tasty."
"0","5","This bread pudding is awesome! I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar and instead of raisins, I used peeled apple slices. I also used 3 eggs instead of 4. Easy to make (my 5 year old helped me!) and delicious--Simply awesome!"
"0","5","We devoured it. Added mashed peaches."
"0","5","My kids loved it so much we had to make another! I added nutmeg and more cinnamon. I would recommend this to anyone."
"0","5","I doubled this in a 13x9 pan, and used good-quality hamburger buns instead of regular sliced bread. I also subbed half-and-half for the milk, and used brown sugar as part of the sugar. I used the equivalent of 7 egg substitutes instead of 8. I also added pecans, which were a yummy touch. Longest part of the prep? Tearing up the bread! Such an easy recipe, and it's getting raves at my office! I'll definitely make this again."
"0","5","I did'nt change anything...it is marvellous in it's own way or if desired add anything one's prefer....it is really good"
"0","5","super yummy! Like someone else suggested i topped it with the vanilla sauce they have in this site and it was delish. Didnt add raisins instead I added walnuts!"
"0","4","I came across this recipe by accident and realized I had everything I needed to make it so I went with it! I did make a couple changes: used 3 eggs (even then, it was a little eggy), substituted brown sugar for some of the regular sugar, and I didn't have raisins so I threw in some pieces of chopped peaches. Also topped with some chopped pecans. It was good and so simple, but I think next time I may even try just two eggs and top the bread pudding with sugar so the top gets crusty. Thanks for a good starter recipe!!"
"0","5","This was my first experience making & eating bread pudding. I took 1 egg out, added an extra slice of bread, and soaked bread for at least 3min. Perfect consistency!! I also tried this with french bread using 2/3 of a baguette."
"0","5","So Yummy! My mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother have been making a variation of this for years. My tweaks: I agreed with one reviewer who said that 4 eggs was too eggy, so i cut the eggs down to 3. I also increased the bread by a few slices, added diced peaches (from a can, but fresh would be even better), and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Also this time, i used our grocery store's white-chocolate-walnut artisan bread. It was fantastic!"
"0","5","Great recipe. However, I made some adjustments to make it super! I tripled the recipe, reduced the sugar to 2 cups, substituted 1.5 cups of milk for 1 cup Baileys Irish Cream and 1/2 cup rum and added 1 can tinned fruit (liquid excluded). Look out!!!"
"0","5","Best Bread Pudding recipe I've found."
"0","5","This recipe comes out looking and smelling as great as it tastes. I had never made bread pudding before and it was incredibly easy to make. I made this for a Memorial day potluck with some friends. I made a double batch and there was non left. Got great reviews from everyone and even a recipe request. It seems it really doesn't matter what bread you use. I used about 13 or 14 leftover dinner rolls and this still came out great. Also, I used a mix of part brown sugar and white sugar. Finally, As suggested by other reviews, I topped it with the vanilla sauce recipe on this site. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","The only thing I changed is I substituted 1 cup of milk for 1 cup of French Vanilla Coffee creamer and omitted the vanilla extract. I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. Awesome! Just like Grandma use to make!"
"0","5","Perfect. A very delicious recipe from which many, many variations are possible. (there was egg on the bottom, but I liked it)"
"0","5","I doubled this recipe and used a package of 8ct-hamburger buns as my bread. They were getting old. This had to be the best bread pudding I have ever made and eaten. I Will definitely being using this recipe again! I didn't use raisins because I don't like them. I may try adding craisins or dried cherries next time. YUMMM"
"0","5","Tried it on a wintry morning and it was perfection."
"0","5","made this for my mother and brother they love bread pudding. i made it took a bite to check the tast mmmmmm good i dont even like bread pudding i went in the fridge the day after to eat some and my brother had eaten the entire dish"
"0","4","I doubled the recipe and used 5 eggs instead of 8 eggs. I also used a little extra bread and used only brown sugar. It came out a little dry on the edges, so I used the vanilla sauce that was posted earlier to soften up the edges: 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a large saucepan and bring to a boil."
"0","5","Amazing! Made it for work with some leftover raisin bread, followed the recipe to the tee...however didnt use all of the liquid over the bread! It was perfect...and gone in minutes!! Will make again, since i already have requests!"
"0","5","I made it in a pie pan and it fit perfectly, and was easy to transport! I also used 1 cup powdered sugar instead of 3/4 cup granular, because powdered was all I had, and it ended up fine. Next time I might add a bit of nutmeg, but otherwise a fantastic recipe as-is. Anyone whose results were too eggy probably didn't mix enough."
"0","5","Used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon swirl bread, otherwise followed the directions. Was very good!"
"0","5","I made this pudding over a week ago my girl and my co workers loved it. I changed the recipe little by taking out the raisins and added semi sweet chocolate chips and walnuts. I also added 2 tbsp of apple butter an a extra tsp of vanilla. Just wonderful!!!!!!"
"0","5","Delish! I doubled the recipe and added a couple more tablespoons of butter. I also omitted the raisins and added chopped walnuts instead. As a final touch, I served it with the brown-sugar yogurt sauce (on the side) suggested with the pumpkin bread pudding recipe on this site. My husband said this was the best bread pudding I've made yet!"
"0","5","I replace vanilla with Vanilla ice-cream, i didn't put the cinnamon as my family member doesn't like it much! It turns out great and very easy to do it!"
"0","4","I used the leftover homemade bread (Amish White Bread recipe from this site) I had on hand for this recipe. I used a bit of brown sugar as well just because it's a personal preference. Very, very tasty. I think I may increase some of the liquid and let it soak for a bit before baking since I like a really gooey bread pudding. Thanks for sharing. :)"
"0","5","This bread pudding is so easy and sooo good! I have made it several times both with and without raisins. I'd love to try making this with apple!"
"0","5","So simple, yet it smells so good and is so delicious!! Didn't have milk, so substituted 1 c heavy cream and 1/2 c water. Thought brown sugar would be good, so cut white sugar down to 1/2 c and used 1/4 c brown. Added cinnamon and vanilla to taste (I like it strong). I wasn't sure exactly how thick or how large the surface area of the slices called for in the recipe were, so I had to go by feel. I used home-made bread, and just cut them into bits about as big as my cat would be able to eat, and added them and the raisins to the bowl of wet ingredients in step #3. Worked the egg mix into the bread until it was well absorbed, then poured it into my pan. There was still a bit of liquid not absorbed. This was fine. I just smushed the bread down as much as I could, and baked it. Came out wonderful. Will be making again, and eating with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","FANTASTIC! I took the advice of other reviewers and made it with cinnamon bread. I also used 3 eggs rather than 4 and opted not to use raisins. As a topping, I made caramel sauce and served with vanilla ice cream. SO awesome! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!"
"0","5","My family loved this. I doubled it as suggested and used all of the eggs. I added pecans and 1/4 cup brown sugar, as well as a tsp of nutmeg. Topped it with white chocolate sauce (6 oz white choc chips melted then slowly added 8 oz of heated whipping cream, while stiring on the stove) and it was awesome. It is definately a favorite!"
"0","5","so good and so easy!! i used leftover cinnamon rolls and a few slices of wheat bread and omitted the sugar and it was amazing! thank you. i love bread pudding and now i can make my own so easily"
"0","5","This was easy and fantastic! Leaving the bread airing out on a baking sheet for an hour dries it out like day old bread. I also had only 3 eggs, but it worked out fine. I added pecans and golden raisins and cooked an additional 20 minutes at 325 because it was a little soggy when I first took it out. It was a little sweet, next time I'll probably reduce amount of sugar and milk. But I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","Add a bit of fresh ground nutmeg and sprinkle with brown sugar before baking. I also sub Splenda for most of the white sugar, leaving some white sugar to interact with the vanilla. Excellent recipe!"
"0","5","This was sooo delicious, I cut down on sugar just a tad, used 3 eggs and used craisens."
"0","4","I followed the recipe exactly though I did minus one egg as advised from other reviewers...it swelled up to form a beautiful dome but then it totally deflated :( and the taste was just alright...nothing spectacular. It looked absolutely beautiful though...1 star's for that :)"
"0","5","Love it, will make this again."
"0","5","Tasty, I doubled the recipe yet still put in only 4 eggs and had it cold with vanilla custard on top."
"0","5","So easy to make. My whole family loves it."
"0","5","I used 4 croissants instead of the bread and it turned out spectacular! Croissants were not old, so I left them uncovered on the counter for a few hours before using. Also, I let the mixture soak though in the refridgerator for an hr before baking."
"0","5","This recipe was perfect! I was able to use up some extra bread bowls that were no longer fresh. After baking I drizzled about 1/3 cup caramel topping that I had on hand. DELICIOUS!!!"
"0","5","Oh my gosh this is so good.. I put some whip cream on top and it was gone in no time."
"0","5","Thanks for this recipie! I added to my blog!It came out very yummy!"
"0","5","terrific! Used Cinn swirl bread and whipping cream instead of milk. Great recipe! Used my grandmother's recipe for vanilla sauce with this."
"0","5","This is the best bread pudding I have ever eaten. I filled a 9 quart casserole dish with dry sourdough bread chunks and followed the recipe for the liquid ingredients. I did have to bake it for about an hour and a half before the egg set. For the last 15 minutes of baking, I put the lid on the dish, and the eggs cooked much faster. Next time, I will put the lid on as soon as the bread on top gets crunchy."
"0","5","REALLY yummy! I did as some of the other reviewers did and omitted one egg. Otherwise made it exactly =) Wonderful texture and flavor. Would be even better with some kind of sauce, but it doesn't require it!"
"0","5","Great, easy recipe. I made it for Christmas morning breakfast and had rave reviews. I followed the recipe, just added an extra slice of bread and walnuts (I put them in with the raisins) and used half and half instead of milk as some others suggested. Thanks for sharing, loved it and will definitely make again."
"0","5","I used challah bread and used a dried cranberry/raisen/goldens mix but otherwise followed the directions to a t. It was perfect - not eggy or runny as some other reviewers have stated. I made a whiskey sauce to go with it and it was awesome."
"0","3","It was way too sweet and soggy; 3/4 c sugar and 4 eggs for 6 measly bread slices are a definite overkill. I used 3 eggs instead of 4 because I was out, and the pudding stayed soggy and jelly-like after baking for more than 45 minutes. I can only imagine what kind of gooey monster I would've created I would have created if I had used 4 eggs. Next time, I will use 1/2 c sugar, leave out the raisin, and 8-9 bread slices for 3 eggs."
"0","5","I used leftover poundcake for it and served it with maple syrup with rave reviews. No raisins but great texture."
"0","3","Not my cup of tea, but for eggs lovers this is probably a great recipe. It came out too 'eggy' for my taste, even using 3 eggs instead of 4."
"0","4","I just tried this recipe and WOW, it's YUMMO!! Used mostly honey wheat bread because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great. Only thing I'll change next time is I'll omit an egg, but still delicious! Had sugar free caramel ice cream topping in the cabinet and drizzled that over while still warm... YUM YUM YUM!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is easy yet delicious. Instead of using 6 slices of bread, I used 5 large croissants. It turned out airy and buttery. My family is not crazy for ground cinnamon, so I omitted that. I served it with Creme Anglaise: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Creme-Anglaise-II/Detail.aspx and it was a hit. Will definitely be making this more often."
"0","4","This was really good...I halved the recipe and used evaporated milk in place of regular milk because I was out...I also used about half brown sugar for the sugar and just one extra slice of bread...it turned out great :)"
"0","4","Very delicious! I love the soft pudding consistency and I made a brown sugar sauce to top it. Yummy!!!"
"0","5","The best bread pudding I've made yet! I added dried blueberries instead of raisins. I don't see why you couldn't use fresh fruit - I think it would taste even better."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I used 6 slices of day old sourdough bread, crust and all. I followed all the directions, and it rose in the oven to make a beautiful, delicious dessert that was even better cold the next morning for breakfast!"
"0","5","i have used different kinds of bread for this and i love them all. but most recently i made a pumpkin bread the day before just to cut it up to use in this recipe! SO GOOD!!!"
"0","4","I have to admit that I didn't follow the directions exactly and took the advice of some of the reviewers. I used less eggs and more bread (leftover wheat I had on hand), bought found it to be too dry. I will use the right amount of eggs next time as I like my bread pudding to be eggier. I also added a copious amount of cinnamon, walnuts and raisins, a dash of nutmeg and cloves, and topped it with warm vanilla sauce. My daycare kids loved it, so I will probably be making this again...only changing some things."
"0","5","Delicious! I used homemade sourdough bread, 6 slices was a bit heavy, next time I'll reduce it to 5."
"0","4","Tried this with whole wheat bread and still good but will try it with white bread next time-it will likely be a five-star. The butter sauce is SO YUMMY!"
"0","5","I added a spiced rum glaze to this. Amazing! Though, I would suggest the glaze, it made it that much more tasty."
"0","5","I rate this recipe 5 stars because it is easy and if you happen to have leftover french bread like I did, this makes a flavorable way to use the bread and have a small pan of delicious bread pudding. This one is a keeper. Nothing fancy but delicious!"
"0","5","This is a super easy and yummy recipe!"
"0","4","I use this all the time to use up any old bread I have in the house. It always tastes good no matter what bread I use."
"0","4","It was a bit soupier than I would prefer and I'd even added more bread than initially called for. Next time I'll try doubling the bread and nothing else. As another reviewer suggested, I'll cut back maybe on an egg too because kind of reminded me of french toast. Regardless with a few tweaks, I'll definitely make this recipe again. Everyone ate the heck out of it!"
"0","5","used more bread, 1/2c white & 1/4c brn sugar, and 1c milk & 1c half and half, everything else was just like the recipe and it was amazing. my whole fam. loves it! THX!!!"
"0","5","So yummy! My husband just loves it! About to try it out with my in-laws. Cheers"
"0","5","Excellent!! I used cinnamon swirl bread from Peppridge farms and it came out PERFECT! The girls at work could not stop eating it all day!! I will keep this and use it over and over!!!"
"0","5","I've tried this recipe one time. Since I'm on a diet I didn't taste it, but took it to a church potluck. My God! everyone loved it! I cut off the crust as suggested, used potatoe bread and also added some crumbled shortbread cookies to the recipes. Everyone said they believe the crumbled shortbread cookies really made the difference. Try it!"
"0","5","Yum!! This was so good. I will make this again and again. The whole family loved this."
"0","2","very bland and dry."
"0","5","Fantastic! I made this as the recipe is but without raisins since I didn't have any and still it was delicious. The best tasting bread pudding I've ever had."
"0","5","Very simple used 3 eggs as other reviews suggested left out the butter and raisins and this was really good will make often."
"0","5","Just like grandma used to make"
"0","5","This is a very delicious recipe, and very simple. I like to pop it in the oven just after dinner when my in-laws visit so that by the time we're ready for dessert, this lovely creation is piping hot. I like to add a handful of chocolate chips, preferably Ghiardeli dark or semi-sweet. A little goes a long way. Also, once I did not use vanilla because we were out, and it made no difference that we could tell. Now I just skip it."
"0","4","A good, but very basic bread pudding recipe. I through some blueberries in with it for a kick. I think recipes with brown sugar have a better overall flavor. But it is very good."
"0","5","Loved this recipe and it was a huge success at Father's Day dinner. The only thing I changed was I used half-n-half instead of milk. Much creamier. Thank you!!!"
"0","5","I made as described, but cut the eggs to 3, and substituted stale banana muffins for half of the bread. Also, I diced up an apple instead of raisins. Pretty terrific!"
"0","5","I forgot to add the raisins, but it still turned out very good. I added two extra slices of bread."
"0","5","I made two, using raisin bread, rye bread and some breakfast rolls. I but both in round pyrex dishes. I added frozen chopped mango and raspberry jam to one. Delish!"
"0","5","Tasted good and very easy to make. I will be making this again."
"0","5","Very good pudding. I used day old cinnamon buns(to use them up) and the result was very tasty & I like the texture of this pudding."
"0","5","This was so good and simple to make. My three-year-old daughter and I made it together with what we had at home. So easy and very tasty. It came out looking gorgeous and we topped it with a sprinkling of caramel sauce."
"0","5","Stunning... forgot the pudding in the oven and still it turned out well. Thanks"
"0","5","My husband says this is perfect. I like mine a little more custardy, but this is great. I made no changes and I like not having to heat the milk, etc first. I had fresh bread so I dried it out in the oven and it worked great. Thanks!"
"0","5","OMG! This was sooo good. I just had my whole family over for lunch and wanted to put together a simple easy dessert, but the results appeared as if I slaved over it! Everybody was raving about this. I took one of the reviewer's advice to reduce the amount of eggs to 3 instead. I doubled the entire receipe and put in a 13 x 8 pan, and it was awesome. Thanks Ellen Marie!!!"
"0","4","Great recipe, but I think it does need the 4th egg and all the sugar. I used golden raisins, which really added a nice touch. Next time I may make with heavy cream instead of milk. Definitely my husband's favorite."
"0","5","I make this all the time with all different kinds of bread--whatever's leftover. The only change I make is to reduce the sugar by about half."
"0","4","Ok, this was the first time I have made and eaten Bread Pudding. I did make a few minor changes as I was out of white sugar ~ I used brown and raw instead. I also added chopped pecans along with the raisins. I took the advice of others and used french bread and supplemented with regular white bread. Over all it turned out great, but didn't wow me. Maybe I'm missing something.... I do think this is a good Bread Pudding recipe though."
"0","5","Yummi, it reminds me of my grandma's pudding.. I actually made it in my Flavorwave Oven, and it turned out amazing. It's my first ever dessert :-) I love it with vanilla ice cream!"
"0","5","My husband loves bread pudding. I have tried several recipes and never been too crazy about them. Then, one church potluck I stumbled upon this recipe. It is true comfort food. I have made it exactly to the recipe, just altering to bread on hand and it always turns out great. I even have an older gentleman with Parkinson's who asked me for the recipe and now eats it weekly. Think of it- it has lots of nourishment!"
"0","3","This recipe was ok. I used 2 1/2 white rolls and it worked just the same. I cut the sugar to about 1/2 cup and it was no sweet enough for me. Next time I would also try to 3 eggs instead of 4. At times it felt like I was eating sweet scrambled eggs"
"0","5","I used to make bread pudding, which I used to steam instead of baking this is the first time I baked the pudding and it tasted excellent my husband loved it very much."
"0","4","We thought this was very good. I added a teaspon of nutmeg and used a loaf of french bread (had to use 1 1/2 portions of the egg mixture to accomodate the french bread). My brother said 'it tastes like french toast,' and when I thought about it, the ingredients are the same, minus the sugar!"
"0","5","i never used to like bread pudding, i wouldnt even eat my greatgramdma's. after i tried this recipe i LOVED it! its is so creamy and pudding like! its custardy and sweet with all the cinnamon! i have been baking for years, and this is by far the best."
"0","5","I used to be a waitress and this is just like the bread pudding we had there - it was awesome! We had it last night for dessert and again this morning for breakfast...Yumm!"
"0","5","This was delicious! I chose this recipe because of all the reviews. I added 1/2 cup of applesauce, used egg whites only, 1/2 with sugar and 1/2 with Splenda. I also used Smart Balance margarine to cut back on fat. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","WOW! I have been searching for a recipe for bread Pudding for awhile now. My husband LOVES it, i'm not a fan! I choose this recipe from reading the review about someones hubby loving it.. Well, I must say...He said IT WAS BETTER THAN HIS MOMS! You know it's good when he says that! I actually enjoyed it also! I did bake it a little longer to give the top more of a browish/crispy coat. I also sprinkled cin/sugar on the top.. YUMMMMM!"
"0","4","I made this for breakfast for my family,it turned out really good, but I did have to add a few more slices of bread to soak up the mixture. Next time I make it, I think I'll just use 1/2 cup of sugar, since we all thought it was just a tad too sweet. Overall though, good recipe, thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious! It was moist, had a nice crisp top, was rich and satisfying, and tasted even better the second day! This is my new go-to bread pudding recipe."
"0","5","Bread pudding. It’s likely that if you’ve never given it a taste, the name doesn’t do much for your salivary glands. Although this was not my first time having bread pudding, my first experience with the dish involved somewhat of a leap of faith. Hesitant bread pudding eaters: if you’re feeling a little adventurous and looking to take such a leap, try this recipe! Your faith will be rewarded! :) When I made the recipe, I did it exactly as stated, adding the optional raisins and using Sara Lee “45 Calories & Delightful” wheat bread. Though I had my doubts about using low-calorie wheat bread, the dish was still wonderfully delicious. Of course, I think a nice, fattening, thick cinnamon-flavored bread or any kind of dessert-like bread would be even better. Who would have thought that a dessert made out of bread could taste so good?!"
"0","5","This is easy and fast. I use it all the time."
"0","5","First thanks for the help. Guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. I made this wonderful pudding with homemade sourdough bread and Splenda. Shared it with my neighbors, it is so good."
"0","5","Yummm. Really easy, I added golden raisins."
"0","5","Very simple recipe, all ingredients are on hand, and it tastes great. I made some rum sauce to go on this and served it to rave reviews."
"0","5","I bought Panettone (Italian sweet bread with candied fruits) at a discount store for $1.00 and thought I'd use it for this recipe. Yummo! Because Panettone has a lot of fat, and some sugar in it, I decided I would change the recipe a bit so it wouldn't be so fattening. I used fat free half and half instead of the milk, 1/2 cup sugar, two whole eggs and two egg whites. I didn't add the melted butter. Everything else in the recipe I kept the same. I recommend using the Panettone, especially for x-mas. You will be very impressed and so will your guests."
"0","5","Loved it!"
"0","4","my mom grew up eating bread pudding and shes picky about eating it now because it just isnt the same but she loved it!"
"0","5","Cheap and cheerful, staples right from your pantry. Super easy recipe to follow. Use any bread available and add anything, in lieu of raisins, chocolate, fruit, nuts etc... to make it your own. I used croissants, chocolate, almonds and cherries."
"0","5","I made cinnamon swirl bread and I had a loaf left over from two days ago, so I cut it up and use it. I did make a double batch of this recipe and it all fit into a 9X13 pan. SO GOOD!!! Thanks :)"
"0","5","Mmmmmmmmmm. So easy and soooo tasty."
"0","4","First time I tried was a little too sweet. After reducing the amount of sugar. It works perfectly."
"0","4","I thought this was really good and a great way to use left over bread. This had an awesome taste, and it wasn't too eggy, though I used only 3 eggs. My only complaint is that it was hard to find a good sauce to top this with. It is very good on its own though."
"0","1","tried several times but still don't like it... it's not the recipe's fault - i'm just not into bread puddings."
"0","3","Sorry, I wasn't a big fan of this one. It was to 'eggy' for me."
"0","2","I didn't care for it. We ended up throwing it away instead of eating it. I will give it credit, though, because it was a very easy-to-follow recipe and the measurements and cooking times were perfectly accurate."
"0","4","Very good flavor, but I think I should have used a better quality bread. The texture wasn't quite what I'm used to at restaurants. I used 3 eggs, more milk, only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, craisins instead of raisins, 2 tsp of vanilla and added ground ginger. I will attempt to make again with a better bread and less milk."
"0","5","Oh boy, is this ever GREAT! I used the cinnamon swirl bread and no additional raisins. Since my bread was fresh, I toasted it lightly for about 1 minute and then let it set out for about 2 – 3 hours. It baked perfectly in 45 minutes. I topped it with the vanilla sauce recipe from this site. THANK YOU!!"
"0","5","Very good. I liked because it stayed moist."
"0","4","A little eggy. I should have listened to other reviewers and cut down."
"0","4","A bit cripsy. Creamy and not too sweet. Everyone really loved this. Great on a cold, wintery night with ice cream or applesauce."
"0","5","This was very nice as I made it: Halved the recipe but used probably about double the bread product (in this case yeast-risen baked donuts that didn't go over very well), and a mere 2T of white sugar. I used powdered milk to get the 1c whole required and baked in a 1 1/2qt dish. Thick, plenty sweet, not too eggy, satisfying."
"0","5","I adjusted this to what I actually had in the kitchen. I used cranberry & apples. Also, used muffins along with bread. Very good, even warmed up in the microwave days later!"
"0","5","Wow! Absolutely delicious! Didn't change a thing and the whole family loved this bread pudding, including my finicky 3 year old. Easy, delicious, satisfying. Two thumbs up!"
"0","3","Too sweet."
"0","4","Very yummy and easy."
"0","4","A very simple, no-frills bread pudding. I made it with 1/2 a french bread loaf that was hard as a rock, omitted the raisins, and subbed some cream in place of milk. Came out very good, my husband loved it."
"0","5","I used seven grain bread. Doubled the batch and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. Everyone enjoyed this. Will be making again soon."
"0","5","I don't like bread pudding but this is very yummy and very simple. I added a cup of sugar as my husband likes things sweet and free handed the vanilla and cinnamon. Mine took a little longer to bake about an hour. I kept checking it like you would a cake. Will definetly use this recipe again."
"0","5","Delicious and easy! The only change I made was the bread; I used 9 slices of a cinnamon raisin loaf and it came out absolutely perfect. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again and again."
"0","4","This was my first time every making or tasting bread pudding. It was very yummy, and made my condo smell great! After the 45 minutes, I took it out and sprinkled some extra cinnamon/sugar mixture on top and baked for another 10 minutes or so. I think next time I will use an extra slice or two of bread. Overall, great recipe!"
"0","3","it was my first time baking bread pudding. i followed the recipe and bake without bain marie as the recipe didnt type for it. it turn out to be shrink at the end and the taste was so-so. overall, its one of the easiest and quick to make."
"0","4","I made this recipe last night because I couldn't wait to try it and see how it would come out!! I was nervous after reading some neg reviews about how it was dry and eggy and then soggy and uncooked, but this actually turned out great! The only reason why I gave this recipe 4 stars is because it didn't have a great height like I would have liked for it to have it was like 1/2 an inch thick, but maybe that is because I used hamburger and hotdog bun bread lol. I did only use 3 eggs instead of 4, I used imitation vanilla extract, and I only used 1 cup of milk and then another cup of strawberry yogurt since thats all that I had. This was great and my boyfriend loves it as well. I will make again thanks :)"
"0","4","This was good but not five star. I think the bread needs to be mixed with the milk mixture before being placed in the baking dish. Some of my bread did not have a chance to soak up the milk mixture even though I tried to mix it up after I poured it in the baking dish. This made soem of the bread come out a bit dry. Good flavor though. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This recipe is excellent and very easy to make. We switched brown sugar for the white and that gives a richer flavour and of course more raisins !!!"
"0","5","Sometimes simple is best. This is the easiest recipe. No fuss or frills, just excellent old fashioned bread pudding taste."
"0","4","I lowered the sugar a bit and it was still very sweet. Pretty good, but once I had chocolate bread pudding, I can now never go back to the regular kind."
"0","5","The only thing I changed was I added 8 slices of bread instead of 6. This is my husbands favorite bread pudding!"
"0","5","My husband's exact word was 'Nummers!' He said this might be better than his grandma's...pretty impressive! I made mine with 3 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and I didn't have raisins (which I don't like anyway) so I added some milk chocolate chips and it tasted really good! I wish I would have put in a little bit more. Will definitely make again. Now I won't have to throw out my old bread."
"0","5","This is so easy and fast and great. I am in love with this. This is my new Favorite. I cooked it with raisens. And used wheat bread. It was great."
"0","5","I made this over the weekend and my family loved it!! I used Pepperidge Farm's cinnamon swirl bread & only used 3 eggs instead of 4. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream - Delicious!! A little goes a long way - very rich."
"0","4","I don't think that my bread was dry/stale enough so it ended up cooking a little longer. Flavor was good, texture, not so much."
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe! i make it all the time without the raisins. i also top it with a hot vanilla sauce, cinnamon, and poor some cream on around it. very good!  I make this with a deliscious vanilla sauce VANILLA SAUCE:   1/2 c. sugar 1/2 c. brown sugar 1/2 c. whipping cream 1/2 c. butter 1 tsp. vanilla In saucepan combine 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, whipping cream and 1/2 cup butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil, 5-8 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Serve sauce over warm pudding."
"0","5","Added chocolate chips instead of the raisons and was really good. I also made a rum sauce to put over it and I couldn't stop eating it. Very moist and tasty. A keeper."
"0","5","easy and good!"
"0","4","So delicious and easy. I used 3/4 loaf of Challah bread and 3 eggs, it turned out great."
"0","5","This was soooo good. I only used 3 eggs, doubled the cinnamon and sprinkled pecans, nutmeg and coconut on top. It came out perfect. My husband said it was the best bread pudding he's ever had!"
"0","5","I had sooooo many awesome comments on this! Excellent! To add more creaminess to it I added vanilla frosting on top when it was hot so it would melt into it."
"0","5","This recipe is fabulous. It takes just minutes to put together and pop into the oven. My husband brings it to work and the GUYS all ask for the recipe - they say it's the best they've ever had. I agree that it is delicious and the ease of preparation makes it a 'Keeper'!"
"0","5","This recipe looks wonderful im so going to try it it!"
"0","5","really good! really easy and fast! Didn't feed 12, only 3 and we ate seconds I have made this several times and it was a hit"
"0","5","I just wanted to say thanks for posting this recipe. I have made it about 5 times and my picky family always asks me to make it again. It is easy and turns out perfect every time."
"0","5","My family loves it. Easy recipe."
"0","5","Easy to make and absolutely the best homemade bread pudding I've had. I made few changes, except for the eggs (used 2 whole and 2 whites of large eggs). Delicious! 10/21/11. Have made several times and it never fails me. My latest version includes a few pecans and chocolate chips. Yum!"
"0","5","This is a great, easy recipe. I followed one of the other reviewers tips and added the brown sugar, cinnamon bread, and substituted milk with whipping cream. 4 eggs is too eggy, 3 medium sized eggs is perfect (do not use large, too much egg). Tastes great warm and topped with vanilla icecream."
"0","5","simple ez dessert very tasty! thank you!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I hadn't made bread pudding in years and could not find the recipe I used before. It's a good thing I found this one- I knew 700+ people couldn't be wrong. . My husband said it was the best he'd ever had! Cut down to 3 eggs & added a little nutmeg. It's a keeper!"
"0","5","This pudding is glorious just as the recipe is written, and has become a staple in my kitchen. I've also made it with many variations: only three eggs, used brown sugar for some of the white sugar, added chopped apples and a sprinkle of nutmeg, made it with stale hamburger buns or even donuts...the possibilities are endless with a great, forgiving recipe like this. My butt may end up getting huge but I will be happy. Thanks for a family favorite!!"
"0","5","Great and easy recipe, I would recommend this recipe to anyone, one of this websites pride I guess."
"0","4","Though this was probably one of the best bread pudding recipes, I discovered that my family and I don't really care for bread pudding. I had made several amendments to the recipe: I didn't have raisins, so I sprinkled dried cranberries over half of my baking dish (I left the other side without, because my brother dislikes dried cranberries). Also, I decreased the quantity to 8 servings, which called for 2 3/4 eggs - I only used 2 eggs, because I didn't want it to be too 'eggy'. In addition to the vanilla extract, I added 1/8 tsp coconut extract. Also, I allowed the bread to soak in the egg-milk mixture for about 7 minutes before baking. The concluding dish was good - maybe not my favourite dessert, but still yummy."
"0","5","Delicious!! I made this for dessert on Christmas day and everyone loved it - I had many requests for the recipe. And the best part was it was very easy to make."
"0","4","This was my first time making bread pudding so I was a bit wary as to how it was going to turn out, but it turned out really well! I doubled the recipe and made two, each in a 8' pie pan. I added apples to one and bananas to the other. Each pie pan fit about 3 big dinner rolls cubed. The one with apples I added some nutmeg, and I didn't really like it. But the one with bananas I omitted the nutmeg and also put less vanilla and I found that I liked the flavor of that one a lot more. Overall though it was super easy, and really tasty. I will be using this whenever I have stale bread now, thanks!"
"0","5","Perfection. I used whole wheat bread, and added dates instead of raisins. Next time i will try another variety of bread, but whole wheat came out quite good. I sprinkled sugar on top and put it under the broiler after the suggested baking time just to caramelize the sugar for slightly crunchy crust. Delicious. Will make again and again!"
"0","4","A little mushy, but tasted great. My four year old told me that he really liked the 'new cake' i made! He would never have eaten it if he knew it was bread pudding. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","Very good. Try soaking the raisins in your favorite liquor. I used bourbon and it gave a grownup touch to this nursery standard."
"0","5","This was great. We all loved it. I used Pillsbury cinnamon swirl bread. I will definitely make this again."
"0","4","My family enjoyed this recipe, I added the praline sauce to it from the Cajun Bread Pudding Recipe I had to cook it longer than it called for. My boys said it tasted a lot like French Toast to them. Would make again."
"0","5","Simply wonderful! I tried it using store bought fruitcake that really bland. The neat thing about this recipe is it's versatility."
"0","5","I had a cake I'd made that turned out horrible but I didn't want to just toss it out so I cut the frosting of the top and cut the cake into cubes. I put it in a 375 oven for about an hour and then turned off the oven and let the cubes just sit in there for another few hours until they were totally dry and toasted. Then I used this recipe just like it was written except I made an irish cream sauce and poured that over the top and drained off the excess. Let it sit for awhile, tried it, and thought it was disgusting. I thought I'd give it another day in the fridge and it sat in the fridge for three days actually and when I finally went back and was ready to throw it out...holy cow, YUM YUM YUM!! The flavors had all mixed and the texture was just right. I probably won't go through all the hassle again but I salvaged a bad cake!"
"0","5","So good and easy. The guests were really impressed, and it only took me a few minutes. I used raisin bread, and sprinkled extra cinnamon on top before baking. Delish!"
"0","5","My family loved it.. thanks"
"0","4","This was pretty good! I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and there wasn't a eggy bottom, which was great! It Baked up nice and thick. I think next time I will add more cinnamon."
"0","5","I made this for my card group and they raved about it. I have to double this because they wanted doggie bag's. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I used Sourdough French bread and it was spectacular. Topped it with Whiskey Sauce and my guest were torn between Bread Pudding and Chocolate Mocha Cheesecake. What a tough life!! Thanks"
"0","4","I used a pumpkin bread and a vanilla sauce recipe from this site and cooked the pudding for about thirty-five minutes. I found that it was a little dry without the vanilla sauce, but it was close to perfect after adding all of the vanilla sauce and draining off the excess."
"0","5","My wife made this for me for a midnight snack and I devoured it! The whole house smells so good when she bakes for me. ALMOST as good as clone of cinnabon. I would give 11 stars to Clone if I could."
"0","5","This recipe is superb! So easy to make even children can do it.Brought this to a halloween get together and all my friends were asking me the recipe. They all enjoyed eating and i had to make another one now because my husband was asking for more!"
"0","4","ohhh this turned out so well...i wanted to use 3 eggs instead of four but decided to just stick to the recipe and change it later on...and it came out well not too eggy at all (but i did use 2 large eggs and 2 small eggs)thanks for posting will make again..and i especially loved the crust.!"
"0","5","This recipe was great. My mom asked for traditional bread pudding on her 65th birthday and she LOVED this one. I only had whole wheat bread available, but it turned out well even with the whole wheat bread."
"0","5","Quick, easy and delicious recipe. I have been making this bread pudding for years, it has become a family favorite. I also find that when there are no sweets left in the house, this is a super easy dessert to make and I usually have all the ingredients on hand."
"0","4","It was bread pudding..."
"0","4","this is a great recipe to experiment with, i did it with 2 loaves of sourdough bread, 6 eggs, 2 cups of sugar, 2tbs of cinnimon and 2 cups milk, in a blender with a couple cans of peaches and then poure apple pie filling over the top, i used what was on hand, it was fun!"
"0","5","yummy! like french toast in a pan if i had to compare it to something. put some whipped cream and more cinnamon on top and i loved it. i am going to eat it for breakfast tommorrow with some powdered sugar and a little syrup. yummy!!!"
"0","4","My first attempt at making bread pudding--I put peaches on top and extra cinnimon spinkled on top of peaches, really good brunch item. A bit soggy and whole milk may be substituted with non-fat milk."
"0","4","Mine came out slightly custardy on the bottom, but I did use cubed stale French bread, so maybe it didn't absorb the liquid as well. VERY YUMMY though, easy to eat way too much. :)"
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe, i have made it alot of times (for alot of different occasions) and it always seems to please everyone"
"0","5","Very simple and tastes great. Easy to make with what I had around the kitchen"
"0","5","Wow! Delicious! I added the vanilla glaze as another reviewer suggested. I used heels from some whole wheat bread I had and some hot dog buns that we had and it was still unbelievable! I also added 1/4 c of brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar. Soooooo good."
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. I made it as the recipe states, and got rave reviews from my family."
"0","5","My Family loves it, what more can I say."
"0","5","This recipe is great!!! So wonderful that I made it twice in a week! The 2nd time I made it I added applesauce on top as it goes perfectly well with the cinnamon that already existed in the recipe...it's a MUST TRY recipe...Thanks!"
"0","5","Also used cinnamon swirl bread. Turned out great."
"0","5","This recipie was so easy to follow and very good. It was a quick desert to make after dinner!"
"0","5","I dislike bread pudding but made it for family members. They loved it.  Used apples and some strawberries. Also added some liquer to the liquid to give it a more grown up taste."
"0","5","Easy to make and so delicious! I only used 3 eggs (so as to cut back on the egg-y flavor others mentioned) and it was perfect. I also tried adding a bit of rum (probably about a shot glass full) but no one could taste it. Ate it hot out of the oven with a dollop of vanilla ice cream."
"0","4","I've made this recipe several times now and every time it comes out yummy! I've experimented a little and here are my favourite changes: no butter; use packed brown sugar instead of white for a bit of caramel flavour; use multi grain bread with lots of seeds and whole grains; serve with 2% milk"
"0","5","My husband and I have been looking for a bread pudding recipe since we tried it for the first time on a cruise in January. Wow...this recipe is very, very easy and more importantly, it taste GREAT. We were out of raisins and regular bread, so we used what we had, which was cinnamon raisin bagels and added a little brown sugar. We served it warm topped with cool-whip.   We will definitely make this dish again!!!!"
"0","5","This is AMAZING!!! I used the left over bread i had made over the weekend in this recipe. The bread I had was still really fresh so i cubed it up and put it in a 400 degree oven for 10-15 till a little dry then let cool and added to mixture. The mixture was so moist and creamy.. My goodness this is a kepper :)"
"0","5","Wonderful! I had my in-laws over for dinner and served this for dessert. It was a hit. My father-in-law never gives compliments and he went back for seconds and said it was good. My husband begged me to make it again and so I have. Excellent. THANK YOU!"
"0","5","Love this recipe. So easy and it tastes as good as any bread pudding I've ever had."
"0","5","Excellent! I omitted one egg and used cinnamon raisin bread. If you are making this for your family, I would double the recipe. This is a keeper, it was gone in 2 days!"
"0","5","Super easy!! Super delicious!! Only thing different I did was add 2 xtra slices of bread. Will definitely make again & again. Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","5","did not use a lot of sugar, and it was raw brown sugar, and the raisins. loved it had it for breakfasts and desserts!!!"
"0","4","Never had bread pudding this was very good. Next time I would leave out the raisins as I did not like them at all. Other than that very delish!"
"0","4","This was an easy recipe to throw togehter before company coming over. It was a hit and my husband is asking me to make it again already."
"0","5","delicious!"
"0","4","I have never tasted bread pudding and my husband kept asking me to make it. Finally, I found this recipe and gave it a try. I'm glad that I did because I loved it! I used 3 egg twist rolls, omitted the raisins and threw in extra cinnamon. It's a keeper!! Thanks so much."
"0","5","My first time making bread pudding and my boyfriend loved it. Finished half of it by himself. I added raisins and thinly sliced apple in mine and springkle brown sugar on top before baking. Turned out great. Will definately make it again."
"0","5","simply awesome"
"0","4","Very good, though I found it a bit eggy. I don't like raisins, so I sprinked chopped dried apricots on top and it was very good--I'm sure any dried fruit would give it a unique flavor."
"0","5","Yum, I loved this! I used stale pumkin yeast bread from this site, which tasted good. I also added a bit of nutmeg and used only three eggs. I loved it!"
"0","2","While it was tasty, it tasted just like soggy french toast. My family members agree."
"0","4","Yum!"
"0","5","I am an accident prone cook and this recipe was easy for me and came out perfect! I used a little more than half a loaf of french bread and followed the advice from previous reviews and only used 3 eggs. I used 1/2 cup white suger and 1/2 cup brown suger, also sprinkling brown suger on top prior to baking. Turned out delicious!"
"0","5","I Love Bread Pudding! and this is VERY GOOD! Followed the recipe to the T but i also added about a half a cup of my Carnation Vanilla Coffee Creamed for a richer flavor! ;) I also love a custard sauce, to pour over it, makes it even better, but I made an instant vanilla pudding to serve with it this time! Very good! Thank's for sharing Ellen!"
"0","5","This was so Awesome and Easy! My boyfriend begs me for this. I found that it did taste better with fresher bread though... Loved IT!"
"0","5","Fantastic and super easy! I used a pull apart loaf made of apples, raisins, and walnuts from Great Harvest Bread as the base. It was sitting in the fridge and no one was eating, but when I turned it into bread pudding -- it was a goner! I used brown sugar, 3 eggs, and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top and my picky eater daughter couldn't resist it and wants some for breakfast. I served it with vanilla cream sauce from a mix from of all places, Ikea. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Wow, I can't believe something sooo good is so easy to make! My family raved about it. The only thing I changed was using 8 slices bread and no raisins (I dont like them). It was so yummy, like a thick rich flan - even better when cold! Thanks!"
"0","5","For someone who never liked bread pudding I must say, this recipe has changed my tune. It is so easy and so good...Serve with whipped cream. I only used 3 eggs at other reviewers suggestion and it was perfection."
"0","5","Very nice, easy - made up beautifully with stale bagels"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome! I followed many reviewer's sugestions, and added only three eggs. I also dusted the pudding with some brown sugar and chopped walnuts before baking. It is soooo easy to make and so delicious, it is definitely one recipe I intend to keep."
"0","5","We made a double batch and overestimated the amount of bread we needed. The batter really looked like too much for 12 pieces of bread, but it would have been perfect. Great recipe."
"0","5","Delicious and so easy!! Can't wait to try it with other breads!!"
"0","5","Wow. This is so good and so addicting. This was the first time I've tried bread pudding and it definetly won't be the last. Great way to use up your bread that's getting kinda stale. I used both wheat and white bread. Thought 3 eggs along with the brown sugar sprinkled on top of the bread was a great suggestion by the other reviewers. Will make again soon."
"0","5","This is a lovely recipe! I left out the raisins and added brown sugar to the top as suggested and the result was wonderful! Even my husband who is a real food critic loved it! Definately a keeper!"
"0","5","Very Good!"
"0","5","Excellent bread pudding base. I used an egg bread that was too dry to eat, some raisins and a quarter cup of chocolate chips. Will make it with brown sugar next time."
"0","5","This recipe is so good and easy! I took the advice of some of the others and used only 3 eggs and more vanilla. Also, plain white bread that I already had. Loved it!"
"0","5","i reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and added chocolate chips in it..yummmm...im glad i didnt put the whole sugar in it. because 1/2 c is just the right amount for me."
"0","5","I have never had bread pudding but my husband loves it. I found this recipe and tried it. I have to say it was delicious and my husband asked me when i was going to make it again. It is a great recipe,Thank you for sharing. LatishaZoerner"
"0","5","We loved this recipe. I used a homemade cinnamon swirl loaf of bread. It was a hit here with everyone."
"0","4","this was so good.I used biscuits becouse I had them and need to throw them away.I also used apple.Which made it really sweet."
"0","5","So easy, so good. I always have to throw away bread. Now I don't, because I know that I will make this bread pudding. Thank you for this wonderful recipe I want be wasteful with bread anymore. Wouldn't change anything."
"0","5","Fabulous and easy recipie. Thanks for sharing it! I like to make is appear a little more wholesome by adding some sliced apple over the top layer. Serve with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","I Love Bread Pudding and this is So Good and So Easy.WOW !!"
"0","5","I changed this just a little. Since I am not a big apple fan, I omitted the apples and added 1/4 c. sweetened coconut, 2 C. bananas and 1/2 c. drained crushed pineapple. It was great! Even the younger family member ate it."
"0","5","This tasted great. I let it sit for 20 min before putting in the oven but this was wonderful :)"
"0","5","Positively tremendous. This was the first bread pudding that I had made. I used a round loaf from the bakery section of my grocer and it was fantastic. I added a dash of nutmeg for a spicier taste. Will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","I think this is a great recipe! I used a leftover sweet bread and reduced the sugar by half to accomodate the given sweetness of the bread. My family loved it!"
"0","5","My family loved this recipe. Easy to make. It will be a family favorite for many years to come."
"0","4","Needed a little bit of a sweeter kick, but besides that it was wonderful! Very moist and lovely texture, the ultamite comfort food."
"0","5","Could not believe how good it was. Wasn't soggy. Loved the cinnanom."
"0","4","Yummy yummy! The pudding alone was sooo good."
"0","5","So easy to make! It's a nice simple bread pudding, which is just what I was looking for! I didn't alter it in any way."
"0","4","I think this recipe was great. Tasted a bit like french toast but that was OK by me. It could use some added spices--nutmeg would add a kick. Overall, delicious!"
"0","5","Lost our family recipe and this is it.Thanks so much."
"0","5","Perfect! Delicious! Everyone loved it."
"0","4","I liked this a lot, and so did my family. I served it with the Brown Sugar sauce suggested by another user, and that was a very good complement to the dish. However, it kinda tasted a bit too much like french toast to me. I used skim milk, splenda, slightly stale leftover homemade Challah (Challah I), and only 3 eggs. Good, but not as good as the puddings i've had in restaurants.Must find their secrets.....Try this cold, too....you won't be disappointed!"
"0","5","I used French Toast slice (from the freezer section) and only 3 eggs as suggested by previous users...This was perfect! Thanks."
"0","5","MMMM wonderful recipe. My father never did any cooking but when I was about 8 years old my dad made bread pudding.. And only one time also. He said his father used to make it for them. That was a real treat for them. That was back in the 1930's.. SO finding this ..so easy and quick recipe that even tasted like my dad's was just great.. Thank you Ellen Warfield..."
"0","4","Very good. Some chocolate chips turn this into wonderfully sweet dessert but cut sugar down a bit."
"0","5","very good breakfast or dessert. very easy and all ingredients are on hand. great way to use up stale bread."
"0","5","This recipe was great. I used 3 eggs as others suggested and I also used half and half instead of milk and lowered sugar to 1/2 cup since I made a sweet sauce to be poured on top. I also added a dash of amarreto to compliment an amarreto sauce I made to go along with it. Yum. The flavor and texture was great. This is a keeper. Oh and I didn't use the raisins because I don't like them."
"0","4","I used multi grain bread.I expected more custard like pudding but its kind of dry.I used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of sugar as suggested by previous reviewers.overall it was okay.myself and my husband are sugar freaks so the pudding dissapeared in a day"
"0","2","VERY wet. If you reduce the recipe (except the amount of bread used) by a third, the texture is MUCH BETTER"
"0","5","Yum! I used 3 eggs as suggested by many reviewers and it came out great."
"0","3","This bread puddding is a good basic recipe but it is not something I would make for company. I made a test batch a couple days before making it for a dinner I was hosting and I'm glad I did because I think I will be looking for a different recipe. This is not bad but not great."
"0","5","Easy to make and tastes great with light Cool Whip!"
"0","5","This recipe is great and so easy to make!!!! I used 3 eggs as suggested by others, plus exact amounts of the ingredients listed in the recipe. Next time,(and there WILL be a next time)I will use a bit less sugar. This is definitely the recipe for bread pudding lovers."
"0","5","I made this and it was very good. I did use 3 eggs as some suggested but I think next time I might use the 4 eggs and try a little vanilla pudding in with it. everyone liked this."
"0","4","Do NOT make the same mistake I did! I added nutmeg, but too much of it (1 tsp). It was soooo nutmeg-y, ewww. Otherwise it probably would have been good.   I also added a handful of chopped pecans & 1/2 cup choc chips, and let the mixture soak for 20 mins or so before baking."
"0","5","This is now a household staple.  Simple... quick... easy... delicious...  My kids love it for breakfast with syrup instead of french toast. For me, it is my 11 pm comfort food. Thanks Ellen!"
"0","4","This is a quick and easy recipe to make. It is not too sweet and my Japanese guests loved it."
"0","5","Outstanding. This is a never-fail recipe that I have now made many times. (I use skim milk, and it's still very rich.) You can prepare all the ingredients in advance, and then just assemble them and put the dish in the oven when you're ready to serve dessert. The last time I made this, I added a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels--for the benefit of a chocolate-loving guest. It was great. I've found that beating the eggs before combining them makes the pudding rise higher. And I'd suggest serving it with hard sauce for an added touch. I've had guests ask for the recipe, and everyone says this is the best bread pudding they've ever had. Thanks very much, Ellen."
"0","5","this was great!!"
"0","5","excellent bread pudding...I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and some nutmeg for some added flavor. The texture was great, and the recipe was extremely easy. We used leftover hamburger buns after I bought too much for a cookout. My daughter loved making it as well as eating it. My husband does not like bread pudding, but tried this one and served himself a bowl."
"0","5","My first attempt at making bread pudding; I don't really like bread pudding. My husband said it was the best he had ever had."
"0","5","very good..not very heavy..very moist.i used 1 cup milk and 3 eggs and 1/2tsp ground cinnamon,instead..so that it wont taste so cinnamonly and a pinch of nutmeg all over the pudding before baking it and i used brown bread(for a change)and it taste better that using white bread.besides its fat less,calories less than bread pudding I recipe.and I really enjoy it"
"0","5","Great bread pudding! I used 8 slices of raisin bread, 3 eggs and sprinkled brown sugar on top. I will make this one often. Enjoyed by all."
"0","3","This was a decent bread pudding but it wasn't a knock out. I used egg bread with raisins and added extra eggs and milk as it seemed a little dry."
"0","5","awesome! made this today for the first time.. it was a huge hit! everone loved it.. even my mom!! who rated it a 1(she thinks 1 star is the best)LOL! this recipe is a keeper."
"0","5","Perfect recipe that fulfilled my bread and butter pudding craving (a throw back to one of our most popular desserts at my English boarding school ):p I used about 8-9 slices of bread and it wasnt too eggy at all - served with hot custard it was simply heavenly :)"
"0","5","i love it and my family love it too  we have it in the morning with cafe"
"0","4","This was pretty good. I used others recommendations and used a cinnamon swirl bread and used 3 eggs instead of 4. It was good but I did not think it was great. My husband liked it though."
"0","5","I have been searching high and low for a good recipe for bread pudding, this was absolutely the best, just like my grandmother used to make. I did have to cook it a little longer, I used 7 eggs like some suggested, and a bit more bread but this is the best bread pudding ever."
"0","5","After reading the reviews, I went ahead and doubled the recipe but I used 7 eggs like someone else suggested. I also used a cinnamon bread loaf and it came out fabulous. What a great recipe, very moist and came out sort of like french toast. My friend who has never had bread pudding before loved it and now wants the recipe. Thank you!"
"0","5","this recipe is very good. my first time making bread pudding and it turned out excellent. i baked them in individual foil tins and i used a bit less sugar and more vanilla for my taste. also i used leftover whole wheat bread."
"0","2","Very egg-y and sweet. Definately more of a breakfast dish than a dessert...Tastes like french toast. Won't make again."
"0","5","Love this recipe. I make it for my wife's pot luck breakfasts and she always brings home an empty dish. Use a fresh cinnamon bread for a nice taste."
"0","4","Really good and easy to make. My whole family loved it."
"0","5","I made this for the first time, and it turned out pretty tasty! I added a bit more vanilla and cinnamon than the recipe asked for and used half & half instead of just milk...I would say that those adjustments made it even better."
"0","5","This recipe is easy, quick and very, very good. I served this with Carmel sauce New Year's Eve and everybody loved it!!"
"0","5","Five star for simplicity and taste. My husband, not being a fan of bread pudding, even said, 'it is excellent!' It is so easy to make and I usually have all the ingredients needed. Followed the recipe to the word and it turned out just wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe."
"0","5","I made this recipe two times in one day. All my visitors on Christmas loved it. I do too, and the leftovers are for my daily breakfast with green tea."
"0","5","I made bread pudding for the first time this Christmas for my family. I don't know ate more of it, me or them. This is THE BEST bread pudding I have ever eaten. I can't wait to make it again. I won't be long that is for sure. I wouldn't change a thing, that is for sure. Thumbs way up!!!"
"0","5","Very yummy and very very easy!"
"0","4","I baked this bread pudding last weekend and everyone loved it. It's so easy to make and I'm definitely going to make it again. Thanks Ellen."
"0","5","I tried this yesterday - it was QUICK, EASY and everybody enjoyed it. Didn't last long!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! This is the best bread pudding I've ever had."
"0","5","My dad loves this! He says it is just like the bread pudding my grandmother used to make. Thanks!"
"0","5","This recipe is excellent! I doubled the recipe, used 6 eggs and a loaf and a half of apple cider bread with raisins. It was a hit at Thanksgiving! Thanks Ellen!"
"0","4","it was fantastic and really easy to make! thank you for the recipe!"
"0","4","Pretty good, although a bit soggy in texture."
"0","5","I made this recipe for my dad who really loves bread pudding at Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit! People who didn't even like bread pudding enjoyed the 'custard' taste. I will definitely make this again!!"
"0","5","Yummy! I made this for Thanksgiving and received rave reviews. I wasn't quite sure if it was 'right' as I've never had bread pudding, but those who had gobbled it up. Great recipe to use and then customize to your family's tastes. I doubled the recipe - used 5 eggs total, 2 cups milk/2 cups cream, a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg. Cooked 1 hour. Thanks!"
"0","4","I made mine chocolate. I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. And I added 1/4 c. cocoa. It was raves all around."
"0","5","A big hit with my friends, didn't last long at all. I used more cinnamon than what was called for."
"0","4","My husband loved it........ a little bit too much bread though, otherwise great!"
"0","5","My family also loves bread pudding very much. I too doubled mine and everyone was so very pleased. I will be using this time and time again. Thank you Ellen."
"0","4","Very good bread pudding. We had this with porkchops and some over roasted vegetables and made for a wonderful fall meal. Highly recommended."
"0","5","Excellente...if you follow these modifications: you'll need about 5 1/2 cups packed broken peices of bread, omit the butter, 3 cups milk, add abotu 1/8 tsp almond extract, and 3/4 tsp nutmeg. I also added 1 medium apple, cored, peeled, and chopped, and made a streusal topping of about 1/4 c. butter, and maybe 1/2 c. each of brown sugar and flour...play around with the flour and brown sugar until you have a cookie dough consistency. Oh, and another must, pour the batter into your pan, and then put that pan in another pan filled with water...it may sound like a pain, but it is worth it, believe me! If you will make the little changes, you'll have yourself a divinely simply scrumptious bread pudding !!! You might also have a hand cramp from all the writing you will be doing, as everyone will be asking for the recipe! :)"
"0","5","this recipe is wonderful; however i made a few slight changes: added 1/4 brown sugar, increased the teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon to a tablespoon of each. there is also a whiskey sauce topping that goes well with this recipe (see below):  whiskey sauce* 1 cup whiskey 1 pound butter 2 cups white sugar  *my family has always substituted 1 cup of dark rum for the 1 cup of whiskey."
"0","5","This turned out great. I used 4 eggs, and my bread wasn't too hard. It was a bit sweet, I will cut down on the sugar next time. It's great alone or with ice cream. This is a keeper!"
"0","5","yum! i added lemon zest and sprinkled brown sugar on top. and like the others, i only used 3 eggs. the lemon zest gave it an extra kick! it was gone within minutes!! yum yum!!"
"0","5","This recipe is GREAT! My fiance wanted bread pudding last week. I have never made it, never eaten it, nor had I ever heard of it. I found this recipe tried it and we love it. I used only 3 eggs and sprinkled with brown sugar. I love to eat it with ice-colded milk. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"0","4","Great recipe! I made it as written (without raisins because we don't like them) and really enjoyed it but next time (and there will definately be a next time) I'll make a brown sugar sauce to pour over top. Yummy! Thanks Ellen."
"0","4","Delicious!!! My husband finished it in two days!!"
"0","5","Fabulous and easy. I used 3 eggs and 1/2 c of sugar, as recommended by other reviewers. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top. Was delicious with vanilla ice cream."
"0","5","Used old baguette, 3 eggs and 1/2 cup sugar as recommended by other reviewers. Sprinkled the top with a little brown sugar before baking. Turned out excellent! Will defenitely make this one again! Excellent with vanilla ice cream and sprinkled with powdered sugar! Yummy! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","4","This was so easy and so delicious I ended up making another dish of it and it still didn't last 24 hours in my house."
"0","5","This stuff is just GOOD. Not too sweet but just sweet enough to satisfy a craving. If you don't have 'day old' bread then let some bread sit out for a while until it dries out a bit."
"0","5","This was really easy to make and tasted great! I used 3 eggs, like some other reviewers recommended, 1/2 cup sugar, and left out the raisins and cinnamon. Served hot topped with caramel sauce - delicious!!"
"0","5","Yumm! I used 7 slices of a very rich buttermilk/egg bread, crusts trimmed. Like most others, I only used 3 eggs. Instead of milk, I used 1 C powdered milk with 2 cups of water (a little thicker then the normal consistency for reconsituted powdered milk). I made a this into a blueberry/ginger/fuzzy-navel concotion, adding 1 tablespoon of peach schnapps, 1 teaspoon of orange extract,1/2 t ground ginger and 1 1/2 C blueberries. It came out wonderfully--rich, creamy and smooth. I omitted the raisons and the extra butter, as the bread I used is so rich. Furthermore, I poured the mix into 6 texas size muffin pans, lightly buttered...baked for 25 minutes at 350"
"0","5","Using the 3 eggs also, I have made this bread pudding twice in 2 days. First for a BBQ yesterday, where my family raved and my husband did not get a chance to taste it, so I made it again today. What a great, easy recipe. Thanks!!!"
"0","4","This was one of the best bread pudding I've ever made. I used white and wheat bread, and I left out the rasins and cinnamon, cuz my family isn't a big fan of them. I also cut down the amt of sugar to 1/2 cup, and the sweetness was just right for us. I agree with other reviewers that the bread pudding was a lil too eggy, next time I'll reduce it to 3 eggs. I'll also use less bread or make more of the egg mixture, cuz I like bread puddings with more custards. Overall, this recipe is worth making."
"0","5","This is the best bread pudding recipe I have ever made. I decrease the eggs to 3 as others suggested and increase the sugar to 1 cup. I also sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top before baking. When I make this within 2 days it is all gone. You won't be disappointed."
"0","4","my dad absoulutely loves it!!!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe for the first time (in competition with my friend's favourite version served by the Mirage in Las Vegas). I used only 3 eggs as suggested by earlier reviewers and I added a touch taught to me by my mother over 50 years ago. I spread the bread with jam before breaking it into pieces. The pudding won rave reviews from my sophisticated and knowledgeable guests. Almost as good as the Mirage!!!"
"0","5","This is the first time I've had bread pudding. I served it warm with ice cream. It was excellent!"
"0","5","I used left over italian bread and it was great. Better then store bought!"
"0","4","This was a good recipe. I will follow others' suggestions and use only 3 eggs next time as it was a bit 'eggy.' Overall this was a good comfort-food recipe."
"0","4","This is a simple yet delicious recipe. I always have extra bread, and I make the bread pudding all the time now. I eat it for breakfast or dessert. Thanks for this great recipe! Oh, BTW, I use a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar, but it's still very good."
"0","5","This is a recipe that I have been looking for! It is so easy and delicious. I didn't have enough milk so I used part whole milk and part evaporated. I think it gave it a more rich flavor. Also three eggs are plenty. Thanks Ellen!"
"0","4","very good! served with a bit of caramel sauce drizzled on top!"
"0","5","This is awesome, nice subtle flavour and came out perfect. Totally reminded me of my mom's bread pudding. I only used 3 eggs, lactaid milk and splenda instead of the sugar. I did add the raisins, but next time I will stir them into the mix as the ones on top burned so I had hard, little, blackened raisins on top that I picked off. Can't wait to have for dessert tonight with a nice cup of tea. I would also like to try it with chocolate chips, but it is virtually perfect the way it is. A great way to use up those pesky loaf ends."
"0","5","Great recipe...remember this from when my mom used to make it....very very good. So easy too! Also used only 3 eggs and came out perfect. Do not like raisins so did not add any. Will make again and again...thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious yet easy! I used 3 eggs as well...much better texture. Also used chocolate chips for my chocoholic family which turned out great! Added more cinnamon too with a hint of nutmeg."
"0","4","This had a nice, sweet flavor. I used 3 eggs like everyone suggested and it turned out great!"
"0","5","Hubby and I loved it! Used 3 eggs as suggested,  and used 1/2 c. white and 1/4 c. brown sugar. Perfect with our morning coffee!!!"
"0","5","If you love bread pudding thats so easy to make then this recipe is for you. I also used 3 eggs and instead of raisins used sultanas. The next time I used a can of pie apples instead of sultanas. It tasted even better cold the next day with some thick cream. Thanks for the recipe Ellen."
"0","5","yummmmy!! easy to make too :)"
"0","5","I prepared this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved the taste due to the simplicity of it. Not over spiced and definitly creamy custard. Reminds me of the puddings my grand mother made in the 60's when she was 60+ yrs old."
"0","4","I took the advice of other reviewers and used 3 eggs. I wasn't crazy about the dish--it reminded me of mushy french toast. However, my husband and older daughter ate the entire pan in one sitting. So, I will make this again."
"0","4","i ues this recipe as my standard...doubling the recipe and putting it in a 9x13 pan. tonight i used 4 huge cinnamon buns in the recipe instead of bread and reduced the sugar to half. it turned out beautifully!! i also added ginger and nutmeg to taste. what a great bread pudding!!!!!"
"0","5","I just tried this recipe and I loved it...It is absolutely wonderful. I was looking for an easy dessert to make with dinner tonight and this was it. I didn't have day old bread...so I just lightly toasted 6 slices of wheat...and it was soooo good. This is definately a new favorite!"
"0","5","I love bread pudding. This is very easy to make and very good. I will make it again and again."
"0","4","Never had bread pudding so wasn't exactly sure of the right texture, but even so, it was good to eat"
"0","5","This recipe is bloody fantastic! I made for my grandparents who usually don't like sweets, but between the three of us, we finished it all in one sitting! I would not change anything about the recipe except for adding more raisin, but that is my personal opinion. Great for a potluck or gathering but make sure to serve it hot! I use the family bread from Saint Germain and consistently get great results."
"0","5","YUM - this is so good, my son and I may finish it before the rest of the kids get home! Will definitely make this again (maybe right now so the rest of the fam wont know 2 of us gobbled up one batch already!) :-)"
"0","4","This is pretty good, but a little dry. It turns out better when you add at least 1/4 cup of butter. Otherwise, though, this is a really good, simple recipe."
"0","5","Great Recipe!"
"0","5","This is the BEST BREAD PUDDING recipe. I have made it several times, Had guest for Dinner they loved it & wanted the Recipe. I served it with a Whiskey sauce, Yumm ."
"0","5","We enjoyed this receipe so much, it's become a ritual for me. Every week I empty my bread box and use the left over buns & bread loave ends to make this bread pudding. I've subsituted Egg Beaters for the eggs to keep it low Chol, and the taste is great. It's quick (the original receipe says 30 min to prepare - think I've got it down to 10 min!), it's tasty warm or cold and it's a great way to clear out the left over bread I would usually end up tossing. It's a keeper in our house. Thanks Ellen!"
"0","4","Went down very well, the kids liked it, I loved it. Comes out with a tasty crust on top and is very filling, served the 4 of us with some left over!"
"0","4","This recipe is very, very quick and easy. I have never had bread pudding before and have nothing to compare it with, but I thought it was pretty tasty. I used only 2 eggs instead of the 4 recommended in the recipe. I also added 2 teaspoons of cocoa & used 2% milk. There is also scope for a lot of variations in this recipe depending on what you have at home in the fridge."
"0","5","I was not a bread pudding fan until I came across this recipe. WOW!! It is so perfect. My kids even eat it and ask for seconds! The only thing I do different is leave out the rasins."

"0","4","VERY GOOD"
"0","4","I'm not a fan of bread puddings because of the mushy texture I have tasted in the past, but I wanted to give it another try. This was very easy and came out quite tasty. Even my kids who are extremely fussy eaters liked this."
"0","5","I changed the recipe to fit 13x9 pan and discovered it is similar to my own,which is best I have tried so far. I use 2 less eggs for large batch and also warm milk and add a couple teas. cocoa powder. My family doesn't like raisins. I tried Emeril's bread pudding and this recipe is much better than his!"
"0","5","This was excellent bread pudding. I've followed numerous different recipes in the past, but this was definitely one of the best. I uses a little less sugar than was called for, & used cinnamon chips in place of the cinnamon called for. You could really taste the difference, so this is the way to go if you are a cinnamon lover. I also added some nutmeg. Was good hot or cold."
"0","5","finally, a 'healthy' treat :)"
"0","5","I have tried other bread pudding recipes and didnt care for them....but saw this recipe and thought I would try one more time. I am sure glad I did! It is so good! It tastes like french toast only better. I used cinnamon raisin bread and we poured maple syrup on it ...Wow!! Thank-you!"
"0","5","WONDERFUL!!! This recipe is the quickest, and easiest. These ingredients are always in the pantry. I served it for New Years, and the whole extended family loved it. One member of the family works in a 5 star resort, and likes it better than the resorts bread pudding !!!!"
"0","5","This is easy and excellent dish. Comfort food!! Yum"

"0","5","this is a GREAT recipe, i would recommend it to anyone, even young children could make this as it is so quick and easy. i even printed this out and straight away made it on the same day. i will be using this recipe heaps of times. it's great. overall, i'm VERY pleased with it!"
"0","5","Excellent! It got rave reviews at Christmas dinner. I doubled the recipe and used sweet Hawaiian bread (no crusts), half cup raisins, half cup chocolate chips. I tore the bread cubes and mixed up the egg-sugar-milk mixture before dinner. While we were eating, I put it all together and put it in the oven. (So quick they didn't even notice I was gone). I served it with caramel topping and whipped cream. Absolutely wonderful."
"0","5","This stuff is soooooo easy. ADD a little nutmeg and you have a flavor similar to pumpkin pie!!!yummy. Me 2 year old loved tearing the bread up. thanks."
"0","5","My husband just loves bread pudding and he is always asking me to make some. I decided to try something different for a change so I went in your website.  There were so many to choose from, but this one sounded the easiest and  probably not too sweet. This is the best bread pudding my husband and I have  ever tasted. Thank you Ellen for submitting it so I could find it."

"0","5","This was the best!! Made it for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. Thanks a bunch."
"0","5","I used potatoe bread and that is what probably made the pudding incredibly moist. I also omitted one egg and added more vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by others and topped with the brown sugar sauce.........AWESOME!"
"0","5","This is the first time I've ever made bread pudding and my husband said it was probably the best he's ever had. :) Naturally, I love this recipe.

"0","5","I was looking for a bread pudding recipe after I came back from Belize-the one Miss Rita made for us was simply divine! This particular recipe stood out because it seemed simple enough to make. Low and behold, it tasted equally as wonderful!! (Even with Italian sandwich bread, which was all I had when I first made it...) It is best warm or right out of the oven but can be eaten cold as a snack."
"0","5","I couldn't believe how easy and fast this was to make, my husband and I absolutly love it, it's usually gone within a day....thank you so much."
"0","4","This was my first attempt at bread pudding. I used 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white. This was easy to prepare and perfect to satisfy one of my last pregnancy cravings. I might try more brown and less white sugar next time. I also used the one less egg as I read in previous posts. You just have to try it!"
"0","5","Delicious & very easy! I fixed this great pudding and went right with the recipe, except I only added 1/4 cup raisins. The next time I make it I will put the 1/2 cup it calls for. Thanks, Ellen, for a bread pudding that reminds me of my grandmother's recipe!"

"0","5","This bread pudding recipe is the best I've tried. Really it should be called French Toast pudding because that's what it tastes exactly like. I used one less egg and 2 tsp cinnamon sugar. My hubby loved it so much. I'm sure to repeat this again. Even yummier with the brown sugar sauce recipe. Thanx. - Steph"
"0","5","I agree with the majority of the reviews I read before making this DELICIOUS bread pudding by eliminating one egg and adding more cinnamon and vanilla extract. I was surprised my 1 1/2 year old loved it! I will definitely make this again! Thank you!"

The second time, I used a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin Swirl (I used almost the whole loaf -- they're thin slices)and it came out great. Thanks so much -- my toddler likes it too."

"0","5","My partner considers himself a bread pudding expert and rates this very highly. I am not a big bread pudding fan so it's a big yawn for me, although I appreciate how easy it is to make. I've prepared it three times now and make the following changes: one less egg; more sugar (at least a quarter more cup); half and half instead of milk. Oh, and NO RAISINS--he hates them."

I had never made bread pudding before--it turned out perfectly.(I even used non-fat milk) I served it warm, with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of warmed chocolate syrup and a few chocolate chips. (This is how I've had it in restaurants.) It was amazing. My husband was in heaven. I am so happy to have added it to my slowly growing recipe collection."
