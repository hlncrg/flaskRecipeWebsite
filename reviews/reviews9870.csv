"11730","3","I would like to spare some people the trouble of figuring out why these cookies didn't come out right. I read some reviews before I started and some people mentioned that there cookies were hard and the batter was crumbly. I can tell you why. MAKE SURE THE BUTTER IS COMPLETELY SOFTENED. I made 2 batches of cookies for a bake sale. When I started I thought my butter was soft (and it was). The mix became hard and brittle. The cookies after they cooled were hard. I was disappointed but had to make another batch as I promised. When I made the second batch the butter had been sitting the whole time and was super soft. The texture of that batter was completely different and those cookies were soft even after they had cooled. THE TRICK IS THE BUTTER. Don't start until it's like mush. My son tasted the first batch and said I don't like them. I had him taste the second batch and he thought those were good. I used two teaspoons of vanilla instead of one to give it a little more flavor. Also, you really only need about a teaspoon of batter for each cookie...they really expand while baking. Another reviewer mentioned that the secret to great sugar cookies is to use margarine which I did. Hope this helps some of you from making the same mistake I did! This is a good recipe however I gave it three stars because I realize I don't really care for sugar cookies..too plain for my taste."
"3673","5","YUM...the easiest and the best-tasting sugar cookie recipe i've tried. I like the fact that you don't have to refrigerate the dough for hours before actually baking. Because of that, you can't cut them into shapes. But if you're happy with just round cookies, then this is the recipe for you. ALSO, if you like soft cookies, make sure you take them out in 8 minutes, even though they won't be a golden brown. Ten minutes and they turn crunchy after they've cooled. Make them tonight - they're SO easy and most everyone should have the ingredients in their pantry."
"2574","5","I know this will sound melodramatic, but I've been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe my whole life. I had accepted the fact that I would never find it when I tried this recipe. The cookies baked up crispy and buttery, just the right amount of sweetness, chewy for days. Just writing this review makes me want to go to the kitchen and bake up another batch! I make cookies for other people every year, and wanted something different for myself, and thought that I'd just give it a try. I will use this recipe forever and pass it down to my kids... grandkids... you get the picture! :-)"
"811","5","great cookies! soft and velvety dough, which is especially easy to work with if you chill it for an hour or two before shaping into balls. but be sure to place them apart because they spread a lot. the result is a delicious buttery cookie, crispy on the outside and chewy within. very yummy! i pressed a little chocolate heart into each cookie when they are still hot from the oven, very pretty too. don't look any further for the perfect sugar cookie!"
"483","5","I wish I could give these cookies a 10! I absolutely love these and made over 12 dozen over the holidays. I had to make so many because they all disappeared faster than I could bake them. I would strictly follow the 8-minute baking rule with these as long as they're about the size of a tablespoon. Just be careful not to make them too big. I used a cookie dough scooper making sure it wasn't overstuffed. They may seem too soft to be done, but when they dry, they're so chewy and yummy! I also rolled them in sugar before baking. Delicious!!"
"465","5","Just like the other reviews said, these cookies were perfect! Not too sweet, not too plain. I do suggest adding a little extra vanilla-I thought it needed a deeper flavor. For kids, they were perfect with icing. Don't cook them too long! If it seems they need another 2 min.,go ahead and take them out. They will firm up once out of the oven. I WILL be making this again!"
"312","5","OH MY GOSH!! This is WONDERFUL a recipe!!! I tried it because I saw the review from a lady who had been seaching for the perfect sugar cookie recipe, because I have been, too. AND THIS IS IT!! I just made a batch, and it was soooooo easy and good, I can't believe it! I scooped them out with a little cookie scoop I have, dipped them in green and red colored sugar, and presto--instant Christmas cookies for my get together tonight! I love it! Thank you, Stephanie, thank you thank you!"
"285","4","We used this recipe to make a huge pan cookie to layer it with fruit and a cream cheese frosting to make a cookie pastry. Everyone kept commenting that this was much better than other suger cookie recipes we have used in the past. The pastry was completely devoured in a few minutes. It was nice and soft with just enough crunch to hold it together. Yum Yum!"
"251","4","The name of this recipe says it all...it's so easy and VERY good! After making another sugar cookie recipe (which turned out disasterous) I decided to try this one. I was even able to make shapes out of these! They turned out very tasty and my husband loved them! Thanks!"
"228","5","I made this recipe 1st for Christmas and it was a big hit...I made it again for Valentine's Day at work (i used heart shape cookie cutters and red sugar on top) and again they were a huge hit...someone said that they reminded them of their grandmothers. I absolutely love this recipe...i'm going to add a spoonful of lemon extract next time to see if that gives it a little zing...but trust me, they are great as is!!"
"115","5","Hoooly mooooly, what a cookie. Tender, buttery and pretty. Perfect. Soft though, not crispy/crunchy (except for the outside which is). So you take these perfect, easy sugar cookies and add the zest of one good-sized lime and a teaspoon of pure lime oil, then dust them with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and, well...I can't stop eating them. Just an excellent cookie - with or without the lime (or lemon, or orange, or...)"
"92","5","Whenever I use a allrecipes recipes, I always read the low ratings to see what their issues are then look at the most helpful reviews to figure out how to rectify whatever other peoples issue are. Many of the low ratings stated that they're dough turned out hard, like sand...crumbly, etc.  One thing the poster did not do is say that the butter needed to be at room temperature. It's really important that the butter is soft. That changes the whole texture of the dough and creates wonderful, soft, buttery, and sweet sugar cookies. Also, as another poster stated, I'd suggest cooking for 8 to 8.5 minutes, then letting them sit on the on the cookie sheet for another minute or 2. This is a great recipe!!"
"87","5","Oh, MY!!!! These are addictive! The best recipe of its type on this site. I used an extra egg, as suggested by an earlier reviewer, and I used a scoop to ensure uniform size. Dropped the scoops into a small bowl of sugar, and rolled them around. Although the dough was soft, with the sugar adhering to it, you could easily pick up the balls and put on the baking sheet. A hint for quick (as in NO) baking clean-up: line your cookie sheets with foil, shiny side DOWN. No grease. Just place dough on the foil. Allow to cool about 10-15 minutes, or until close to room temperature, then use a spatula to transfer to a rack. They release easily. Ten minutes yield a barely colored cookie that is chewy and delicate. An additional 2 minutes makes for a golden color and a little more crunch. They look like the cookies you bake from the Pillsbury slice-and-bake rolls that you find in the dairy case at the grocery store, but with a far superior flavor. Nothing better than a cup of tea and a few of these! I just made a batch this afternoon, and only 8 are left. Everyone in this family absolutely loves them. Thank you for a superb, versatile recipe!"
"44","5","Easiest sugar cookies ever and they tasted so good! This recipe deserves 10 starts! I was having a pregnant 'gotta have cookies NOW' moment so I looked in the kitchen and found everything I needed except for the salted butter and all purpose flour. I used self rising and omitted the baking soda and baking powder. I added a few dashes of salt (maybe 1/2 a tsp) to the UNsalted butter. * NOTE - If using self rising flour (which does contain some baking soda and powder) and salted butter I wouldn't even bother adding salt to the recipe. I formed little balls, rolled them in sugar and sprinkles, put them in the freezer on a plate for about 10-15 minutes, heated the oven and popped them in half frozen. They were done in about 8 or 9 minutes but watch them closely. Don't make the mistake and overcook them. When you take them out they will look very pale but that's because most of the ingredients are light in color. When the bottom looks barely darker than the top of the cookie they are done! They will come out VERY soft but will harden up some after you take them out of the oven. I didn't have a wire rack to cool the cookies on so I let them cool on a plate. And I would also recommend that you freeze them for at least 10 minutes if you plan on baking them immediately and if you do freeze them to save for later make sure you thaw them halfway before baking. If your cookie gets too flat when it bakes it's probably because they weren't cool/firm enough before baking. Happy baking!"
"40","5","I never made cookies from scratch before, but I wanted to try. These looked easy to make, and they were! One thing I did different was add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. The cookies turned out sweet and yummy. But a little too sweet to add any frosting or colored sugar things. If I ever make these again, I will cut down the sugar because I want to decorate them! Also, I heard they expanded a lot, so I really used a teaspoon, but they turned out WAY too small. I made the balls a bit bigger, and they were still kind of small but I was afraid of making them bigger. But they still tasted delicious!"
"38","1","I’m very sad that my first review is going to be incredibly negative. These were awful. I read the reviews and let the butter get completely soft, it was sitting on the top of the stove with the oven on and was partially melted. The 'dough' was a crumbly mess and I could barely shape it into balls. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and they did not spread. Instead I had clumps of tasteless dough that were very brittle. I’ve made many other cookie recipes and never had a problem. There is no way this recipe is correct, there has to be more wet ingredients to bond the dough…and how does a cookie recipe not have salt? This recipe was a big waste of ingredients."
"33","5","Even though I read over and over that this was not a good recipe for cut-outs, I decided that I liked the recipe and would try it anyway. The result was the best sugar cookie I have ever made! I made the dough as written and then let it chill in the fridge for 5-6 hrs. I let it warm to room temp. and kneaded it for a while. Perfect consistency to make cut-outs. I only baked these for about 7 minutes. I love these because they stay chewy and don't get rock hard like the others. I am very excited about this recipe and will use it for all my holidays cookies. I used 'Luscious Buttercream Frosting' from this site as suggested by another reviewer and it was fabulous."
"31","3","The dough wasn't really dough, it was more crumb like. It took a lot of manipulating to make a ball stay together. The cookies did come out beautifully at 8 minutes... soo good I didn't even care that the dough was a little difficult to work with! I had such high hopes thinking I'd finally found a fantastic sugar cookie recipe. Well, I just ate one and all I could taste was flour. I will probably try it again with less flour. Maybe 2 1/4 instead."
"28","5","Haven't we heard the wisdom all our lives that the simple things are often the best? We have countless cookie recipes, but none can make the simple sugar cookie go pale. I haven't tried this one, but with all the comments favoring it, I think I might. Fish is another good example of the wisdom of simplicity. Many scrumptious recipes for fish and shellfish exist, but it's hard to beat simply applying some butter and sauteeing it or baking it JUST until tender, then splashing it with lemon or lime juice. Nothing can bring out the sweet, delicate flavor of seafood better than that. My tuna salad is simplicity itself: mix drained tuna with lemon or lime juice, then enough mayo till it holds together. Maybe chopped celery for crunch. So many recipes on these boards seem to be trying to be as unique and unheard of (and therefore, somehow, glamorous) as possible. Yet the only embellishment I'd consider for a sugar cookie is to substitute some of the butter with cream cheese. The aroma and taste do what glamor never could!"
"26","5","ok, I realized last min that my grandson's football game was just over an hour away; since it's fall in MN I wanted to bring (homemade) cocoa and what would go better than sugar cookies to dip in the cocoa? So, I needed a recipe that was FAST as well as delish so I searched AllRecipes and found this!!! Boy am I glad I did! What a hit! All the ingredients were simple and in my pantry BUT don't let the simplicity fool you - this recipe makes the most fantastic cookies!!! EVERYONE raved about them! I did (by accident) add more vanilla (maybe 1.5 tsp instead of the 1 tsp) than called for - but I'm sure if I hadn't, they'd still be as delicious! I had QUICKLY skimmed some reviews that said they tasted too much of baking powder - or was it soda? Anyway, all I can say is WHAT??? Then, 1 or 2 others said something about making sure the butter was at room temp or the cookies wouldn't taste good???-- hmm, I pulled my butter from the FREEZER, micked it to soften it, and even though some of the butter was still slightly frozen or hard, well-- I just used my mixer to blend the sugar and butter and maybe I did mix it a little longer than if the butter had been room temp, but despite those uncertainties, they turned out F A N T A S T I C!!!! I'm not a fan of sugar cookies, but when I tasted one later that evening, well, I guess I could see why they went so fast and everyone liked them! DO NOT HESITATE TO MAKE THESE, THEY ARE GREAT!!!"
"26","4","These are great-crisp outside, chewy inside. They were too bland until I rolled them in sugar before baking. I had two five-year-old helpers and this is definitely a kid-friendly cookie recipe! No mess!!!"
"21","3","I wanted to make cut out cookies with my kids like in the picture, so I convinced myself that the people who put the bad reviews must have done something wrong since it has gotten several good reviews also....well I tried to make these last night and the batter was SO super sticky like other reviewers wrote, so I put it in the fridge until this morning and it was still a sticky mess. There was no way I could roll the dough in my hand to make a ball or with the roller to make the cut outs, so I just got a spoon and dropped small amounts onto a cookie sheet. Some that were too big were still raw in the middle at 8 min. cooking time, so I mostly had to cook them 12 minutes. I made another batch of dough this morning so I could give it a second chance and still way too sticky. I'm not an experienced baker so I didn't know a trick to fix that....I did try to add water and that would help for a few seconds, but then back to sticking. Like another reviewer wrote, these are ok if you AREN'T going to make cut outs. Those who did really need to share their secret!!! Overall these are easy to make and the taste is Ok, but I'll keep looking for another recipe that I can make cut outs with. The picture really shouldn't show cut outs for this recipe, because if you follow it as it's written, the dough is way too sticky for cut outs."
"20","5","This dough was so incredibly easy to work with. I did refrigerate it, but only for about 45 minutes, and only out of necessity since I squeezed the dough-making in after dinner, threw it in the fridge, put the kiddos to bed, then back downstairs to do the baking! Only tweak I made was using an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Made two dozen sugar cookies, flattening with a sugar-coated drinking glass, then made one dozen as Snickerdoodles (rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar), and the last dozen as Christmas thumbprints (rolled in green or red sugar, and will add frosting or icing later). Three kinds of cookies from one batch, all wonderfully textured and sweet - this one's definitely a keeper!"
"20","1","this recipe is missing something the dough is way to dry..."
"19","5","This is a great recipe - my kids LOVE this! My son described them as 'heavenly.' Only thing I did different is add an extra egg, as other reviewers suggested. The first batch I only used one - and they were a tad dry. Second batch I used two and they turned out perfect! Thanks!"
"18","4","I love this recipe. It's really easy to make. I made 2 different batches--one with the butter that the recipe called for and the other with margarine and noticed that the cookie dough that I made with butter seemed a lot more dry and crumbly than the margarine made dough. Perhaps this is what other reviewers experienced? I noticed that the margarine batch was a lot more soft than the butter batch. This recipe is also very good even if you substitute the sugar with splenda. This recipe really is 'easy'!"
"18","1","These turned out to be the worst cookies I have ever made. The dough is too sticky and they stucj to the pan. I followed both batches exactly from the recipe and they both failed."
"15","5","Here's the deal. THESE COOKIES ARE PERFECT. If they don't come out right, you did something wrong. I am a novice in the kitchen and I didn't screw them up.. I read the review that said the dough was crumbly, SHE DIDN'T MIX THE DOUGH LONG ENOUGH. I can't imagine how many people threw the dough out thinking they had made the same mistake. About half way through mixing after I added the flour I thought, 'OMG, look at the dough, it's 'crumbly,' just like that review said..shoot!' But I continued to mix it and it came together fine in another minute or too. These cookies are so fast, I can't imagine she was that impatient. Anyhow, cream butter and sugar WELL, as always. I use a hand mixer, it was the right thing for this dough. Use it until the butter/sugar mixture becomes a butter consistency again. When doing the flour, it will get crumbly, but soon after, it will come together perfectly. Easy to handle and ball up without refrigeration. Oh and, as another said, 8 MIN IS SPOT ON. They may not look done, but they are! I have tried a dozen sugar cookie recipes, and my search is over!! THANK, THANK, THANK YOU!! :)"
"15","5","My family loved these cookies! They were simple to make with ingredients that you usually have on hand. I don't know what some of the other reviewers were talking about but they were not too 'floury' nor did they spread out too much. All I can say is they must have done something wrong because these cookies are light and slightly crisp or soft and chewy depending on cooking time. I experimented with cooking times after reading other reviews; I first tried 8 minutes and they came out soft and chewy then I tried 9 and 10 and they were crispy. My family preferred the crispy ones. I too added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the dough, I then pressed the cookie slightly down with the back of the spoon and sprinkled sugar on top. YUM!! I will absolutely be making theses again!"
"14","3","The cookies came out okay, but they taste more like flour cookies than sugar cookies. I would caution the use of this recipe.  signed, my.ken.ja"
"14","1","This was a real whatever cookie. Not much taste, texture was lacking, but yeah, it was easy if thats what you're looking for. I tried this recipe because of the overwhelming positive reviewals, but after trying it, I can't fathom why it's so popular. I'll keep looking."
"14","5","Stephanie, this is the sugar cookie I remember from when I was very young. I was never able to find the same taste anywhere. I can't even remember where I had the cookie, but not even my mother was able to duplicate it! This is excellent- no added flavors other than vanilla to detract from the excellent taste. Many thanks for sharing this!!"
"13","5","This is one of the BEST Sugar Cookie recipe I have found yet!!!  I made 3 batches for my family on Christmas Eve and by mid Christmas day they were GONE! I then had to make a batch for my husband to take to work with him, and I am making some for friends today.   I did not get 48 cookies per batch out of this recipe. I tend to make BIG cookies, so I only got around 12-14 per batch.  The recipe says you can roll into balls.. NOPE. The mixture was to sticky to do that, and I did not want to add more flour, so I dropped by tablespoonfulls onto the pan and sprinkled with red and green sugar. The cooking time is right if you want a nice chewy cookie, if not around 12 minutes for a crispy one.   This recipe is a keeper. We enjoyed them very much!!!"
"13","4","Cookies have much better flavor if you add 1/4 tsp salt to dough."
"13","1","I followed the ingredients to a 'T' and I always set out my ingredients ahead of time (just like on the cooking shows) and I was really excited after reading the reviews, but it was all for naught. I have never made such a tasteless, dry very plain looking cookie! They crumbled and tasted like sand in your mouth. I always triple check ingredients and even made it a second time, same thing! and they stayed in the scoop shape that I used from pampered chef and never even flattened out. I certainly cannot reccomend this to anyone and I wish mine looked like the ones in the picture. Dry, crumbly, disasters. Even tea and coffee did not help these! Sorry but I was not impressed at all."
"12","1","I tried making these with my class and they didn't turn out at all. After baking them for the written time and they were still in balls, we decided to flatten them down. We tried adding milk to the recipe to add moisture and that seems to work better. I would never make these cookies again."
"11","5","Swap out 1/2 cup of the flour for 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and you have the BEST chocolate cookies!"
"11","1","Unfortunately this recipe was not very easy to use the cookie cutters in, maybe I did something wrong, but I won't use this recipe again, sorry."
"11","5","This recipe was so easy. I usually do not have any success with rolled out recipes but was successful with these. I baked for 3 minutes,then flatten out to put colored sugar on them and continued baking for 6 more minutes."
"10","4","Delicious! I give 4 stars only because we had to add a little milk (not in the recipe) to make the dough doughy. Other than that....delicioso!"
"10","5","UPDATE!!! These cookies aren't really meant for rolling out! They're PERFECT as proper, normal cookies rolled into a ball, dropped on a cookie sheet and baked! If you want rolled out cookies so you can make christmas shaped cookies and the like, use the best rolled sugar cookies recipe."
"10","1","Long story short, I just could not get these cookies to work. Came out brittle and tasteless every time."
"10","5","This recipe makes the perfect dough for cutout cookies. I compared this recipe with the 'soft christmas cookie' recipe on this site, and found that this recipe is better for making both drop cookies and cutout cookies. The dough is easy to work with, and it makes tasty cookies. GREAT RECIPE!"
"10","5","I made this recipe just this morning so that it would be ready for a party I'm going to tonight at my uncle's house. The dough was so easy to make and it didn't take long to back them either. I sprinkled cinammon on some of the cookies, sprinkles on others, and just left some plain. The cinammon and sprinkles give them just a little different flavor, but even without them the cookies are melt in your mouth good. I'd recommend these for a mother/daughter or grandmother/granddaughter project. They are great!"
"9","4","These cookies were delicious! I made over 300 for the dads at my church for Father's Day and got so many compliments! The only thing I did differently was that I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. They are amazing plain as well as with frosting. They turned out great, and I now have my go-to sugar cookie recipe. Thanks for the recipe!"
"9","5","Amazing cookies! I have easy tips for you to make them even more amazing! First of all I put a teaspoon and a half of vanilla exstract rather than 1 teaspoon only. I used margarine instead of butter and I melted it for 10 seconds in the microwave. I know it's nice and healthy to use half the whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour, but it makes it super crumbly! Just put all purpose. I reccomend rolling the dough before making into teaspoon sized balls and cooking. Thanks sooooo much for reading my review! It's helpful for my friends.   Calista"
"9","5","These are great and simple to make! If I am planning to roll them out and cut into shapes, I refrigerate the cutouts prior to baking. That way the cookies don't spread out and lose their shape."
"9","5","Great Recipe! I have many suggestions though, as many people have complained, the cookie dough gets crumbly. So, my advise is put the sticks of butter in the microwave for 2 minutes or until completely liquid. It gives the cookie great texture. I also found that 1 tsp. vanilla is to mild while 2 tsp. is too much, so do 1.5 tsp of vanilla for good flavor. Also, grease the bottom of the cookie sheet for an easy off the oven. Leave on the cookie sheet for minute before you put them on to the cooling rack. Also put less sugar. Will use this again. Everyone should allready have ingredients in pantry... MAKE THEM 2NIGHT!!!!!"
"9","5","These are SO good! I have been looking for a sugar cookie recipe like this for years, and finally found one. My husband devoured them within a day. Just a note, I used 2 eggs instead of one and cooked them for 6-7 mins and they came out perfect! P.S. I also rolled them in a cinnamon/sugar combo before baking them! thanks"
"9","1","I made these on Christmas Eve. Not fit for Santa or the reindeer."
"8","5","These turned out great. I melted the butter in the microwave before mixing with sugar. The only thing I will do different next time is reduce the amount a butter. The cookies were a little more buttery tasting than I would like..... but still GREAT cookies"
"8","4","I double the amount of vanilla and soften the butter for 2 hours before (until it is literally room temperature). Also, I mix these entirely by hand (no electric mixers). They come out ROCKING AWESOME with those changes!"
"8","5","I think the secret with these cookies is to make sure the butter is well softened and then cream the butter and sugar together thoroughly before adding the rest of the ingredients. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and increased the vanilla by 1 tsp. They are good rolled into balls and then dipped into cinnamon and sugar."
"8","1","It's too dry. We waited until the butter was basically mush to start making them like some of the other reviews had suggested, but it's just too dry, and at the end of cooking time they were still round balls. It just needs more liquid!!!"
"8","5","I loved the cookies we just made them tonight as cut outs. I did make two changes to them and that was to add 1/4 cup more sugar and 2 TBLS of Vanilla. I put them into the fridge for two hours rolled them out and made really cute christmas trees! My whole family loved them this is my new sugar cookie recipe for now on. Thank you so much and to be honest with you I dont know what people are talking about saying they are to dry, crumble, thin ect... They turned out just like the one I buy from the bakery! A+++++++ And my boys had so much fun making them."
"8","5","This recipe is great, and you actually can cut them into shapes, I did with great success. Place a handful of dough in between two sheets of wax paper and roll. If you don't put the wax paper on top, the dough will separate. I found it easiest to remove the shapes and the excess dough with a pie server. The pointed tip helps to get the shapes out easier. It's a little tricky rolling the dough without the paper moving, but it does work well."
"8","5","Definitely a winner! This is an excellent example of its basic type. It's fattier and more sweet than some sugar cookies and, in my opinion, reminds one of snickerdoodles in taste somewhat, although not exactly. The cookie holds its shape well and turns a nice golden color, browning eveningly for the most part. However, left in the oven too long, they will scorh on the bottom even if cooked on parchment paper atop an airbake cookie sheet. Cooked to golden brown, they are just right--forming a nice crackle-type top and coming out crisp and flavorful. Using teaspoon-sized dough balls is best since this is a rich cookie. A person could halve the amount of sugar for this recipe without harming the taste or texture. I used only 1/4c less sugar and the cookie was still ultra-sweet. I was making them for an 87-year old who loves roll n' cut sugar cookies and likes everything sweet. He loved these!"
"8","1","This Recipe was Awful the dough was very crumbly, it a lot like sand! They where also hard to cook, they where either to soft or to hard. I followed this recipe just as it says and they still turned out like hard rocks, total !"
"8","5","These are excellent cookies. I found that after adding all the flour mixture the dough was a bit crumbly and wouldn't hold together enough to be rolled. So I just wet my hand with some water and puller it together...Just a tinsy bit. Oh and don't make your cookies too big. A one inch ball both ways is perfect and will give you a perfectly sized cookie. I rolled them in a suger cinnamon mix. Gives them a crunch and glittery outer and a chewy soft inside. Perfect cookies! 5 stars all around for me."
"8","5","I only baked half of the recipe because I wasn't sure how good they would turn out. I'm not exactly the best baker. My family and friends finished them so fast, i barely had enough for myself. They are so good and not too sweet, not to mention soft and chewey."
"7","5","My wife usually does all of the baking in our house. This time I wanted to try the baking myself. In looking for recipes this one seemed simple and everyone seemed to love it. With that glowing review, how could I go wrong? They were right. I made these for a bake sale and they were the number one hit. Before I got started, I looked at other suggestions and took them into consideration. Soft butter was important, but I did not have time for it to sit out. About 35 seconds in the microwave solved that problem. For a little more flavor I added 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1 and finally, my cookies needed 15 min at 375. They were still pale after only 10 min. I used a tablespoon scoop and rolled them into small balls. Once on the cookie sheet, a flattened them a little and added sugar crystal sprinkles. Once they came out, I let them sit for 1 min and then transferred them to a cooling rack. WOW."
"7","4","i followed Rolanda's tips on making sure the butter is creamy soft and using 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of 1. THE COOKIES WERE AWESOME! they were sweet! although they did get pretty hard after they cooled, all you need to do is pop it in the microwave and warm it up again to get that warm chewy straight out of the oven texture :)"
"7","5","Seriously...resist the temptation to bake these to golden! They will be crispy through and through instead of crispy out and chewy inside. If you roll the dough into balls and roll them in sugar (which I did, and highly recommend!), you can bake as-is, unflattened, until the cookies look puffy and are done according to a toothpick. Pull them out, and as they cool, they'll deflate and have those beautiful cracks that magically appear. Magnificent looking, great tasting, just watch that bake time!"
"7","1","followed to a T and they never flattened out...stayed little balls..and started burning on the bottoms b/c the rest was too thick to cook. And dry!"
"7","1","VERY DISAPPOINTED! We made these cookies the night before a pot luck for dessert and they were terrible, no flavor, and didn'nt taste like your average sugar cookie, we made sure butter was softened and they still came out bad, USE ANOTHER RECIPE!"
"7","5","These cookies are the best sugar cookies I have ever have! Just make sure you put them in the oven for only 8 minutes that's it. Even if they look done take them out!"
"7","5","Ok- These cookies are ADDICTING!!! I have never in my life found such an easy to make, delicious cookie. The tray is usually gone before they are cooled. One thing.. I add 1/2tsp more of vanilla and bake for 8 minutes. THESE ARE GREAT!!!! So quick and easy!"
"7","5","Soo yummmy!Decided to make these for Valentines day, so I put a small amount of red food coloring in the dough so they dough turned pink and cut them with a heart shaped cookie cutter! Since I have never made a sugar cookie dough from scratch i was extremely pleased and plan on making more before tuesday and decorating the next batch with a yummy frosting!"
"7","5","I had to make 240 cookies for family gifts. I was looking for a regular sugar cookie recipe that wouldn't call for 50 cups of anything. All the ones i could find had weird stuff like lemon or nutmeg. I just wanted old fashioned regular sugar cookies. Thanks to this recipe i got the flavor i wanted, saved money on supplies and didn't spend three days baking."
"6","5","Just finished these. So easy and delicious"
"6","5","Very easy, very delicious. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the letter and brought a few dozen to school. I came home with none. Tonight, I added just a little bit extra flour, threw in some red food dye (for Valentine's Day) and rolled them in sugar before baking. Thanks for a quality recipe - it's the first one I've saved! (p.s they taste great, Happy Valentine's! or Joyeuse Saint Valentin, I learned that in French today, hehe)"
"6","5","After tasting 'a few' of these cookies, my 26-year-old son begged me to wrap them up and hide them before he ate the entire batch. I followed the recipe exactly and sprinkled colored sugar on them immediately after they came out of the oven."
"6","4","These are great easy little cookies but I agree totally with those who had to add an egg or reduce the flour. They stay very balled up as they are. The addition of the egg helps them to spread more like other sugar cookies. I sugared these with a rainbow of colors for our VBS and I know the kids will love them!"
"6","5","Let me tell ya.... I have NEVER been a success at rolled sugar cookies. I actually cannot even make them to be edible. These ROCK! I followed the recipe exactly. Love them. Shame on you people who 'substitute' ingredients, then give a two star review. These are great."
"6","5","I loved these cookies! They were soft and delicious! I used very soft butter and I rolled them into balls and dipped the half that would be facing up on the cookie sheet in green and red sugar crystals for christmas (I tried rolling the whole ball in them, and it came out burned on the bottom), and they spread perfectly and came out great. I thought they tasted better then the cut outs I made the year before, and looked just as festive. They all spread to pretty much the same size and shape the way I made them too (I posted a picture of how they came out if you look for the one posted by me). I will definitely keep using this recipe!"
"6","3","I did not care for this recipe. Sorry to everyone who likes this recipe, I understand everyone has their own opinion. I always taste my dough before I eat my cookies, and not even the dough tasted good!! I decided to cream together a little more butter and a little bit of brown sugar to add flavor. It was a touch better but still tasted like a clump of flour. To anyone who enjoys cookies fresh from a good bakery - I am the granddaughter of one of the best German bakers I know ."
"6","5","They taste AMAZING! For all the people who claim their dough is crumbly, even if they think their butter is soft, I ALWAYS melt my butter to almost all liquid in the microwave because our butter stays in the fridge. Do about 30 seconds first, see how melted it is, and keeping going at about 15-20 second incriments until at least half of it is liquid. If you want to let it cool first so it blends with the sugar better, go ahead. :)"
"6","5","Made at 4am in the morning. It definitely took me 1 hour plus before I finished baking about 20 cookies...but was worth the wait!! I used margarine- so cheap but turned out great! And let them sit on the countertop for 4 hours to turn soft. Accidentally read wrong and used 2 tablespoons of vanilla instead of 1 teaspoon! I was wondering why I finshed the bottle of vanilla essence! Yikes..but suddenly everything smelt wonderful and turned the batter a pretty shade of light brown.The first batch was light colored and soft -maybe not totally cooked? The later batches I allowed to sit in the oven longer..so they got crispier, one batch got burnt around the edges but turned out the family favourite....it turned out the crispiest- like a Famous Amos's cookie crispy texture. All very sweet even though I followed the recipe- I guess thats why they're called Sugar Cookies, right? But next time, I'll lessen the sugar a little. I also prefer the cookies softer rather than crispy..so next time, I'll take them out before it hits 10 minutes, they won't be so golden brown though. Great recipe! I've received requests for this recipe:)"
"6","4","This was a great recipe! I took the advise of others and added an extra egg, an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and a 1/2 tsp of salt. I used a cookie scoop and rolled them in sugar before placing on cookie sheet. Then I flattened them out with a fork and baked for 11 minutes. They are perfect - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!"
"6","5","Extremely quick, easy and delicious. I whip these up when I'm in the mood for something sweet. I'm making them again right now. Definitely a keeper."
"6","5","AWESOME cookies!! I've been looking for the perfect 'Sugar Cookie' recipe and this one is by far it. Plus it's easy and quick. My husband added more vanilla extract but other than that the recipe needed no alterations. YUMMY!!! :)"
"6","1","I already have a sugar cookie recipe that I use every year but I like to try new things every once in a while and these cookies were not good at all. I always use recipes based on reviews, I don't know where these reviews are coming from? The dough was dry, the cookies did not look like the picture and I even tried pressing them down, and the taste was dry and bland. I bake a lot and I followed the recipe exactly."
"6","3","Taste was great but shapes didn't withstand cooking; came out in shapesless blobs. Recipe is still worth a try, but stick to circles or pressed-down balls. Don't bother taking the time to use intricate cookie cutters as they will be lost during baking."
"6","1","When I made them they came out hard. I don't know why?"
"6","4","A really good simple cookie. Not overly sweet. I put a Hershey kiss on each one when they came out of the oven."
"6","5","YUMMY!!! I rolled these in sugar to give them a little color when I put them in christmas cookie gifts. Everyone loved these! I made the dough about 2 weeks early and froze it before making them and the cookies came out just fine."
"5","5","OMGoodness!!! I think I am the worst baker in the world (although I am a terrific cook). I can't seem to get it right when making dough products from scratch. My granddaughter and I have tried on numerous occasions to make cookies and we (or I) have failed every time. I tried this recipe based on the reviews it got. I cannot believe I got it right the very first time!!!!!!! Sooooooooooo easy and simple to do. The cookies were moist, the texture just right and they tasted so good. I am now confident to add to this recipe and take it to a new level. I give it a 10+ To all you non bakers out there this is a great recipe to build your confidence!"
"5","5","This is so easy to make when your trashed. My wife passed out an hour ago and me and my buddies got a sweat tooth so I googled easy bake cookies. This was the only one that didn't cost shipping and handling haha. But seriously these cookies are good. Ohh-rah!!!"
"5","5","Delicious. Also added a dash of almond to half of the batch to make an easy almond cookie!"
"5","5","This recipe truly is very easy. Cookies bake up nice and evenly and spread just the right amount. Great texture and 'bite.'"
"5","5","These came out sooooo delicious,,almost cakey...I did have to mix margarine with my butter due to not having enought butter .. and i only used two cups of flour and i took them out a lil earlier so they wouldn't become too hard. they perfectly soft . Defiantly making these sometime soon :D"
"5","5","Such a simple and wonderful recipe. I actually ran out of regular sugar so I used 2 cups of white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar. They were scarfed almost as soon as they were pulled out of the oven. I also added some confection sugar to the top. All were pleased!"
"5","5","So easy and good. I did double the vanilla as others suggested, used margarine and made sure it was well softenend, and added 1/4 teaspoon salt and nutmeg."
"5","4","Did as suggested and let the butter get soft, they came out perfect on my first batch. My new favorite sugar cookie recipe and my kids can't get enough."
"5","5","These are really easy easy and delicious! I sprinkled sugar on them after baking them while they were still warm, they were soft and tasted soo good. Sugar cookies are my fave and I always had to buy them because they never turned out well for me, until now :) thanks for sharing."
"5","2","I followed this recipe to a T, AND it all just stuck to my beautiful cookie sheet, even though they looked perfectly done. They were tasteless, and the batter was not like real sugar cookie batter at all, can't even make shapes or use a cookie press"
"5","5","Excellent cookies! Crispy outside with a soft center. We really enjoyed making and eating them!"
"5","5","I made these cookies almost a week ago. I just ate the last two and they were still soft and chewy. I am making them again today for a bake sale this weekend. This will be my go to recipe for sure! I did think about what others said, I made sure the butter was very soft and added a bit more vanilla."
"5","4","My son had to have a recipe to make cookies for his whole class. This was a quick and easy recipe for a novice 15yo cook. A few days later, I made a batch for the family.  We could only get about 42 cookies out of it instead of the 48, but this will be an easy recipe to tweak with toppings or candies for the holidays."
"5","5","Loved these... Quick and tasty... My boyfriend, who doesn't like cookies, devoured these."
"5","5","These are good and so easy to make. Made them Easter Sugar Cookies."
"5","5","I don't know why anyone would pick another sugar cookie recipe. These were so easy and turned out perfect."
"5","1","I tried this recipe and and the dough was dry and flaky."
"5","5","These were great and super easy to make. I took the advice of another user and made sure the butter was softened before. Yummy!"
"5","5","These are amazing! I followed other peoples advice and added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and that made a HUGE difference. They were very tasty. Also when I was rolling out the dough,(I made these into cut out cookies)I used powdered sugar rather than flour. That made them pleasantly sweeter without tons of extra sugar. The consistancy seemed weird when I was blending everything together..as if it needed a little bit of milk or something. But I decided not to add anything, I just stuck the dough in the fridge for about 20 minutes and then rolled it out and it was fine! I rolled it out pretty thin and put them in for about 7 minutes at 375."
"5","5","My son and I just made these, and I had to write a review...they are delicious!! We used cut outs and they came out great. We did not change a thing, and we did not chill the dough. We just floured up the counter and the rolling pin...yummy!!"
"5","5","So simple to make and so yummy! I tried about 5 different recipes for sugar cookies recently and almost gave up. I followed the recipe exactly but I do recommend pressing on the small balls of dough slightly with a spatula before putting in the oven."
"5","5","These sugar cookies are awesome. My best advice is to pull them out of the oven right when they start to crack on top, but don't wait for them to turn yellow or darker (if you want you can let them turn very light yellow around the edges, but I think even this makes the cookie a bit too hard and crispy). They will continue to cook once you pull them out. If you pull them out at this crucial time, when they are starting to crack, they will be a bit crispy on the outside, and very soft and chewy and delicious on the inside. Great and easy cookie!"
"5","5","Oh, my god! These were some of the best sugar cookies I ever made! They were nice and crispy golden on the outside, but chewy and melty on the inside (not as in raw, as in FLUFFY!) I will definitely make these again! Thank you very much!"
"5","5","these are delicious. my bf loved them!!!! I followed the directions exactly except I added a tiny bit more sugar & butter since he likes that buttery flavor/txtr. They were NOT eggy AT ALL!"
"5","5","These were amazing cookies. I make four batches (a lot of cookies) for my college dorm, and also to send to friends at school. I made a batch with butterscotch morsels and another with mini chocolate chips, but the favorite by far was the original recipe. I got marriage proposals on the basis of the cookies alone! A special tip: before putting them in the oven, sprinkle more sugar over the top of each cookie. It adds a sweet little crust to the top, as well as a slight shiny glitter."
"5","5","Oh my! They are so easy and so good! I like the fact that you don't need to chill the dough, roll them out or cut them into shapes. For the mom on the go these cookies are fantastic and my husband loves them!"
"5","5","Easy and tasty. Great for a drop cookie."
"5","5","THE BEST!!! (tip: don't use an electric mixer and add 2 tablespoons water)"
"5","5","OH MY GOODNESS!! THE BEST COOKIES I'VE EVER MADE. MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. i added an extra egg, a 1/2 tsp more vanilla, and rolled them in cinnamon sugar and they came out perfect. also, bake for just 6 minutes. my family ate them up faster than i could bake! definetely a keeper!"
"5","1","i probably will not ever use this recipe again. when i finished mixing everything the dough looked and felt like sand. i tried to roll it into ball but they kind of fell apart. so i put them in the pan anyways and they ended up like rocks."
"5","5","These were the BEST sugar cookies I have ever tasted! I LOVE sugar cookies and I could never find the right recipe! My daughter had to bring in a snack for everyone for school and so I made these! They were gone really fast! THEY are perfect! Also I added my own icing that I make homeade and it tasted EVEN BETTER! All you do is mix milk and confectionary sugar and it comes out great especially to top off these cookies! YUM=)"
"5","1","Didn't really care for them at all. Little flavor. But they were definately easy to make."
"5","1","Took me a few tries to get them to come out how I wanted in the oven...but overall they were perfect. :)  But then another time I made them...three hours later they were hard as rocks..."
"5","5","This is the third year I have made these cookies for the holidays! Every year they are wonderful. I have rolled them in cinnamon and sugar, colored sugars for the holidays, and have also topped them with Hershey's Kisses and made them into thumbprint cookies with jam. I have not had any variation turn out poorly. I do change up the sugar measurement. however. Instead of 1 1/2 cups white sugar, I use 1 cup white sugar and a 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar. These cookies are simple and great!"
"5","5","These are great and I make them all the time. They are only too crispy if you overcook them. If not, very chewy and delicious. I often make them ahead of time and freeze the uncooked dough balls. When we are craving homemade cookies, it's so nice to just pull them out of the freezer, and pop them in the oven. Great, easy recipie. Thank you Stephanie."
"5","5","The best, easiest cookies for holiday or anytime. Even my 2 yr old son can help with these! And my husband can't be left alone with the finished product or there will be non left for anyone else."
"5","5","Wow! These were great. I made them with my daughter and even though the dough looked really crumbly it rolled up into balls pretty easily and baked up beautifully. We'll definitely be making these again."
"5","4","I'm 15 years old and found this recipe incredibly easy to follow. I found myself short of 1/2 cup of butter so I substituted it for 2tsp. milk, 1/4cup half and half and 2tsp veggie oil. The cookies came out great, taste good and had a good consistency when I went to cut them with cookie cutters!! Great!"
"5","5","This is Plato's Ideal Sugar Cookie!Fantastic texture and just sweet enough.It looked like there was going to be way too much flour, but it turned out right. I added a little ginger, and sprinkled some cinnamon on top And I got a dozen more cookies than the recipe was supposed to make, which is good, since these are 12-at-a-sitting cookies."
"5","5","This is a very flexible recipe. I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup water instead of 1 cup butter to reduce the fat content. They still taste great!"
"5","5","I really loved this recipe easy, quick and delicious. Seems like the cookies were better the next day.   Polly76"
"5","5","as a chef, i love teaching my 4 year old in the kitchen. this is real nice to show the numbers and ingredients for him to learn. of course he loves eating and making a mess! chef kev."
"5","4","I found these sugar cookies to be soft,chewey and easy to work with. They tasted yummy as well."
"4","4","I measured the exact ingredients and I took the advice of others to double the vanilla. I also already had softened butter laid out, because I use it like that regularly. But the batter still ended up crumbly. So, I used about 3 Tbsp of milk and that fixed it up. Even though it doesn't require me to put the dough in the fridge, I've rolled it up into a log and placed it in there with plastic wrap to bake later. :) the dough itself is yummy to taste, so I'm sure the cookies will be lovely. I plan to bake for 8 minutes because somebody wrote that it comes out soft if you take it out early. EDIT: So I made a batch, and put placed them in as balls. They didn't flatten out much. Maybe in my next batch I'll flatten them out more. But they taste good."
"4","5","my go to cookies. i cut the butter down this time to 1 and a half sticks just to personal taste. i also melt the butter and cream in sugar before adding. you can use almond extract for cookies that taste (better) than the Chinese carryout cookies."
"4","2","The batter tasted like flour, but good. the batter was all crumbly."
"4","5","These cookies are amazing!!! I am thankful that I read the reviews before making them though. I made the recipe as listed but it was crumbly so I took the advice of others and added another egg and another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. The dough was perfect after that and so were the cookies!!"
"4","4","These were so easy and very good. I melted the butter completely in the microwave, and instead of teaspoon sized cookies for 8 minutes, I did large balls for 12. Wow, fantastic texture. When I took them out of the pan they were still fluffy (and not browned). They flattened when they cooled, and wow: crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Re. flavor, well, they're sugar cookies, so there's no super distinctive flavor, but they're killer with frosting. Next time I think I'll add a tad bit of lemon extract for zing or more vanilla extract."
"4","5","I LOVE this recipe! I actually just used it to make a fruit pizza. The only thing that surprised me was how much it expanded. The first time I tried making a fruit pizza crust with it, it expanded all over my oven. Then, I put tin foil under the pizza pan and made raised edges with the foil to try to keep it from overflowing and it worked! The crust was the perfect shape and size and SUPER EASY!"
"4","5","I made these cookies last night and these came out soooo perfect. My family enjoyed them. It is such an easy recipe. Definitely be aware of the servings, my batch made 61 teaspoon size balls. I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and baked them for 10 minutes and they came out perfectly shaped and golden. Yum, yum! This will definitely be a go to for things such as teachers gifts during the holidays since it makes so many."
"4","5","I made these last night and they were awesome! The process is as easy as it gets and is really a good base for a chocolate chip cookie. I tend to like my cookies very soft and not crunchy in the least. The only change I made was that I used Country Crock instead of butter because I tend to use Country Crock solely in place of butter and it still turned out fantastic! Right now I am pregnant and cannot use chocolate (for annoying reasons of aversions) but when I get home from the hospital I am going to be making these again. Maybe add peanut butter in one batch and brown sugar with chocolate chips in another. There is no real limit on these cookies! Make them, you won't be disappointed!"
"4","5","REALLY easy recipe and the cookies are delicious! I second the review of others in that you should pull the cookies at exactly 8 minutes and then let them sit for 2 before moving them to a cooling rack. They are scrumptous!"
"4","1","These cookies are very dry and do not have enough sugar in them. They had no flavor at all. I would not recommend these cookies to anyone!"
"4","5","These were the most simple cookies to make and very good. However, I experimented with different butters ~ one of which was Country Crock vs. real butter and they came out really well. Today I'm going to be making them again, and this time using real butter w/salt to see if their's a difference in flavor and texture.   My youngest daughter and her friends just love them and I can't keep enough on hand. Great to recipe to get the little one introduced to baking cookies (even middle school kids would love to make these in Home Economics) Another thing too, in between batches its best to leave the dough in the fridge as it becomes sorta 'sticky' if you don't. If you do roll cookies, its best to leave the scraps in the fridge for the next time you roll / cut out the cookies. If the dough is left out, it becomes 'sticky' and impossible to work with. Just do NOT go crazy with the flour as the dough will take on the 'flour' taste. Blah! Happy baking everyone and hope my review helps!!!"
"4","5","These turned out well! I rolled them in green and red sugars for Christmas :)"
"4","3","Of course I read the reviews AFTER I made these and saw that everyone else had the same issue I had with the butter. We ended up adding melted butter and they came out ok. I added red food coloring to a batch and green to the other batch to be festive. The next day they were pretty hard so I'm not sure if its the way I stored them, the extra butter or what. I may try another sugar cookie recipe next time."
"4","4","I made this for my daughter's school Christmas party. This is the perfect sugar cookie consistency and taste-wise. I had some issues with them being an appropriate size for the kids to decorate. If you drop them by spoonfuls they will be too small. I rolled about 2 tablespoons into balls and then pressed gently to flatten a bit and they were the perfect size. 1 batch only made 20 cookies or so. Definitely a keeper recipe!!!"
"4","5","These cookies turned out fabulous! The edges were crispy, but the center was nice and chewy, and lacked the typical flour taste of 'sugar' cookies. One note though, you have to leave the butter out until it is COMPLETELY room temp, otherwise they turn out kinda grainy. Oh, and double the recipe, otherwise you may not get any."
"4","4","Super yummy the same night. Were kinda hard the next day. So easy to make my 4 yr old did most of it. He thought they were great."
"4","5","I thought this recipe was great I did make it my own by using margine instead of butter and adding brown suger. I used 1 cup white and the half cup I used brown suger. 2 tsp. of vanilia like some others have added. My whole family loves them. I can barely get all of them done cooking before my family devours them."
"4","5","Amazing! They just got out of the oven an look perfect! I am making them for my ss class tomorrow. Did you know that in the colonial days they had sugar cookies? Amazing! Well these turned out perfect. And will be delicious too! Used three fourths of a teaspoon vanilla and a fourth of a teaspoon almond extract because I like the combination. You could definitely use a traspoon of almond or a taspoon of vanilla or half and half too! Thanks so much for the recipe"
"4","5","FAB! Sent them in a package to my military man and they were still soft after a few days : ) In my opinion, they actually tasted better the day(s) after I made them. Left them in for exactly 8 minutes and perfectly soft. Paired them with the Sugar Cookie Frosting on here (with butter instead of shortening) and they were even better."
"4","4","Amazing cookies but following the recipe exactly yields a too crumbly cookie mixture. MELT the butter first. I added 1/2 stick butter & 1 tsp vanilla to the original recipe for richer cookies."
"4","4","I am a very young baker i am 14 and bake all the time. I am always looking for great recipes for my family and I. This is one of the best so far. The cookies were great lasted all of a day in my house.....then again nothing last longer then 24 hours. Overall they were very good!"
"4","5","Very good cookies......and it makes a lot of them!"
"4","4","I made one batch and found it to be very buttery and a bit too sweet for my taste. The second batch I only added one stick of butter and substituted the remaining butter with 1/4 C peanut butter and 1/4 C mushed banana. I also added only 1 C sugar. They came out OK, slight hints of PB and banana but they definitely need additional sweetness."
"4","5","Great recipe! The texture is my ideal cookie, crisp on the outside, chewy inside. The only thing I may change is to add a bit more sugar. They are already sweet, but I just like a very sweet sugar cookie. I read some of the reviews and people said their dough was crumbly or dry. If this is the case, your butter was probably not fully softened. Make sure it is room temperature, and if it still seems crumbly, just get your hands into the dough and work it a bit. The heat from your hands will help it soften up a bit. Happy Baking!"
"4","5","Super easy and delicious! Didn't change a thing! Who needs the hassle of rolling out cookies when this recipe makes the cutest drop cookies? Yum!"
"4","5","this is by far the best sugar cookie recipe i have ever made. super simple and VERY tasty. I even used this sugar cookie recipe when i made snicker-doodles. all i did was roll the pieces of dough in some sugar and cinnamon and PRESTO! super yummy snicker-doodles. LOVE THIS RECIPE saved it in my personal recipe book."
"4","5","These were so good! I made these for Valentines Day and added some red food coloring to them. I also took the advice of another person and made sure the butter was REALLY soft. I've never made a cookie from scratch that came out this good!"
"4","5","my children loved them but i would add 3 more eggs and some more vanilla to it"
"4","5","Delicious! I have made w/ butter and Smart Balance baking sticks. Cookies were delicious both ways. Cooked about 10 minutes or so on a baking stone (used a cookie scoop, so my cookies were a little on the large side). Cookies were crispy outside and chewy inside. Perfect texture! I used a little extra vanilla and swapped some of the white sugar for brown (just a personal preference). Thanks for a great & easy recipe!"
"4","5","I am a very amateur baker and these cookies taste like cookies from the mall! I am so happy. I did read the reviews and slightly(not all the way at all) melted my butter and added extra vanilla."
"4","5","Best sugar cookie recipe ever! If you follow the recipe with no changes youll have a perfect, fluffy and decadent cookie. Will make again!"
"4","5","This is a great, easy recipe! They do flatten out more than I expected, but my husband actually preferred that. I used vanilla, orange extract and orange juice in a batch and they were heavenly. I added a couple of tablespoons extra flour to compensate for the extra liquid. I will be making another batch tonight with a new flavor!"
"4","5","Great basic sugar cookie! I reduced the flour by 1/4 c and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla for flavor. I rolled these in a little sugar and put the pan in the freezer for 30 min before placing them in the oven for a little over 8 min. I'm a little confused by the size of cookie that the recipe suggests - 1 tsp is SO tiny! Mine were about 4x that and they were normal sized cookies! The cookies were crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle!"
"4","5","I was looking for a recipe that was just like the sugar cookies I loved when I was young and this recipe hit it right on the mark. This cookie is sweet, so I like to top them with sprinkles. P.S. The trick too making the perfect cookie is in the creaming process. The butter and sugar should be creamed so well that it turns a very light color and have a very smooth and fluffy texture. This is what makes these cookies so chewy and velvety. The extra time it takes to really cream the butter and sugar is so worth it!"
"4","5","These cookies were great! I took another reviewer's advice and made sure that the butter was thoroughly softened before mixing it with the sugar. What I did was take the butter out of the fridge, cut it up into slices, placed the slices in a bowl, and stuck the bowl in the microwave for a few seconds. The cookies came out perfectly - soft, warm, and not crumbly at all. I don't think there is anything you need to add or subtract! They were even in the fridge for a while, and I put them in a toaster oven for a minute or two... they came out just like new! I would like to try them with sprinkles on top. The family says that they are 'Santa's favorite cookies.'"
"4","4","This is a very good sugar cookie recipe...I did make a few changes. As a lot of people have mentioned the dough was dry (I even let my butter sit out for over an hour to make sure it was super soft) so I added an extra egg and the dough was the perfect consistency! I also added approximately a tsp of salt and doubled the vanilla....amazing sugar cookies!!!"
"4","5","Amazing! Honestly I've tried 3 other recipes from this site and these are the BEST! I had a extra 'splash' of vanilla... not on purpose and I would probably do it again LoL..."
"4","1","This recipe didn't work for me. It did not form into dough at all, just crumbs. I tried again following the recipe to a 't' and same result. I wasted the ingredients twice."
"4","5","A little bit on the sweet side but a great recipe. I made balls then I cup the shapes I wanted right out of the oven. The cutest pumpkins ever!"
"4","4","If you use a zest of a small lemon it makes these are amazing! I liked the cookie although it did not turn out quite like the recipe."
"4","1","I bake regularly and am an avid cook. These cookies were incredibly frustrating. Though I followed the recipe to the letter, the first batch turned out dry and crumbly (much to my 6 year old son's dismay - we were doing this together). So I immediately made a second batch (with soft butter again) and the thought it was moderately moister, it was not enough for them to cook properly. I added some milk and an extra tsp of vanilla and got the consistency I was looking for but still not a good cookie. I was so excited to read the great reviews but I am wondering what I am missing here..."
"4","3","Pretty good for a sugar cookie recipe. Very run of the mill though, I used this because I needed to make a very simple cookie and I actually couldn't remember how to make sugar cookies because it has been so long! They were good but I just don't think sugar cookies are exciting enough to make regularly"
"4","5","These are by far and away the best sugar cookies I have ever made and I have A LOT of sugar cookies! This is the recipe for the perfect sugar cookie, no need to look any further! Thanks Stephanie!"
"4","4","These didn't rise as much as I'd like but they were still pretty dang awesome. I'd say use at least a Tablespoon of dough per cookie just because the bigger ones I made turned out a little bit better, a little thicker and softer/chewier rather than crunchier."
"4","5","My daughter decided to bake and sale cookies to raise funds at her school for a children's hospital. In her preorder, she got orders for more than 40 dozen sugar cookies. Not being a big fan of the whole rolled sugar cookie process and considering the quantity of cookies we had to make, I looked for something quick and easy...well THIS RECIPE IS IT! AND THEY TASTE GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly, but in double batches 5x over! Thanks Stephanie for a great recipe and for making this cookie bake so much easier for me!!"
"4","5","This is the best basic sugar cookie I've eve made. I've made this recipe exactly as is at least 5 times over several years, and modified it several other times, substituting some of the white sugar for molasses/honey/cane sugar/brown sugar to create different flavours. I find the secret to this recipe is to use REAL butter, not margarine. I made the recipe with margarine once, and the cookies were oily, thin and crispy. They tasted all right, but butter yields a far superior dense yet puffy cookie with a rich texture."
"4","5","I made these for an Easter Potluck and they were a hit. Before baking, I rolled each ball in colored sugar, placed the ball on the baking tray, slightly flattened the ball and added more colored sugar. The initial roll in sugar had little effect, but the additional sugar baked on as a thin, colorful, sugary crust. A tray full of pastel yum!"
"4","3","so after thinking there was an unnecessary amount of reviews for a sugar cookie we have decided to add our 2 cents... we added another egg to make the the dough less crumbly, i would also suggest melting the butter first because molesting it with my hands obviously wasn't enough."
"4","4","After reading many of the reviews for these cookies, I was expecting some sort of monstrously difficult cookie making challenge! So many people said they ended up with extra crumbly or extra sticky dough. I must say I'm a bit puzzled as to how this tragedy befell these folks, as this recipe was so super easy. The only things I did differently from the recipe stated above were: I added 1 tsp salt since I used unsalted butter, I added an extra tsp of vanilla, and I rolled half of my cookies in granulated sugar and the other half in raw sugar. They came out lovely! They have a nice crackly top, they're nice and chewy in the center, and they have a pleasantly mild flavor. I'd totally make them again."
"4","4","these cookies were delish, well with my own little twist. after reading most of the reviews i read that the batter will become very crumbly so i was extreamly cautious well baking. After stirring the {sticky} mixture i carefully poured the dry mixture in a little bit at a time. I probably used all the dry but 1/4 cup of it. While mixing it i got the result of CRUMBLY!! so then i procedded to put about another tablespoon of vanilla (if not a little bit less) and contines to mix. and VOILA! the dough was wonderful! be careful though, directions say DO NOT GREASE PAN, {i did} ooops. They slid around a bit, but overall they were fabulous. After getting them out of the oven i sprinkle some MINI chocolate chips in the middle adding the perfect touch. Now, me not being a cook, this iss greatttt!(: so rememeber. 1. use more vanilla 2. dont use all dry mix (leave about 1/4 cup out, if not a little bit more) 3. DO NOT GREASE PAN(; 4. Add your own touch 5. delish cookies(: gotta go, second batch just got done. --thenotsocook"
"4","5","Normally I don't like sugar cookies, but I made these for a neighbor, and they are delicious!! The only alteration i made was upping the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. These have definitely changed my opinion of sugar cookies."
"4","4","Great tasting, but the first batch I put in the oven came out quite hard. I suggest putting them in 6-7 minutes rather than the 8-10. They come out soft and chewy and delicious!"
"4","5","I'm a HUGE cookie baker and I've been trying to find a sugar cookie recipe that was simple and tasty and this recipe fits the billH!!BUT HERE'S THE DEAL!!! This recipe is already super quick so save yourself some time and MELT THE BUTTER!!! I know the recipes says softened but they didn't mean softened like regular cookie recipes believe me just pop the butter in the microwave until its completely melted and these will be perfect everytime. I personally thought they were too sweet the last time I made them so the second time I made them I cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and bumped the vanilla up to 1 1/2 teaspoons and they came out absolutely PERFECT!!!!!"
"4","5","After reading the numerous positive reviews I decided to make these cookies. They turned out so good! I followed some advice of other reviews and let the butter soften before I used it. I also doubled the vanilla. The mixture was crumbly and not holding well so I added an extra egg in and that fixed the problem. I was going to let the dough chill in the fridge for a little bit but I wasn't able to finish making the cookies so it was in there for about 18 hours or so. I took it out and rolled it and cut little circles out. The dough was a little difficult to work with at first because it had been in the fridge for so long. After a while it became easier to work with. I got around 33 cookies or so. The cookies do expand so don't make them too big and make sure you spread them out. After they cooled I tried them and they were sooo good. I'll be using this recipe a lot."
"4","5","I followed the recipe, except I added an additional 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I dropped 1/2 of the dough by spoonfuls & the other 1/2 I rolled & flattened with a sugared glass. Both were excellent! Next time I'm going to make a raisin filling & bake it in 9x13 - cookie crust top & bottom & cut in squares."
"4","5","This is by far, the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever had!! I have looked to ends of the internet searching for a great sugar cookie recipe, and all have failed. They always came out too thin, crunchy, or just plain bland. Too many other recipes call for stuff I just didn't have on hand, like sour cream, cream cheese or cream of tarter. These came out amazing!! I have given this recipe out to 3 people within a matter of hours after baking them. I took another user's advice and used 2 eggs and 2 tsp of vanilla, GREAT advice. Also you don't have to roll these out, or refrigerate! Just drop by teaspoon onto cookie sheet and sprinkle with sugar. Who ever came up with this, is a cookie genius in my book!!!"
"4","4","Good Cookies! I found that they cook best at 9-10 Minutes. They are crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. I made them with my little cousin, great recipe to work with kids. I had about two batches. About 2 cms apart is good. Although the cookies are a tad plain, and I can taste the butter."
"4","5","YUM! Just made these with my daughter. Quick, easy, delicious. I had everything on hand. I checked them at 8 minutes and they seemed very pale, so I took them out at ten. Next time I will take them out at 8 minutes. Otherwise, very good. Thanks for sharing!"
"4","5","Husband and son LOVE these! Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup Crisco sticks, along with 2 teaspoons of vanilla and they were great. Also turned the oven down to 350 and baked for 9 minutes...really nice texture. Also, I rolled them in sugar and slightly flatten with the bottom of a glass..."
"4","5","These are awesome!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did lower the oven temp to 350 and baked for exactly 8 minutes. I also rolled the cookies in sugar before baking them. They didn't look 'done' but they were perfect. If you wait until they start to turn golden brown they will probably turn out hard. And you have to make sure that the butter is room temperature and very soft or you will have problems with the texture and how the cookie bakes. Mine stayed nice and soft and my husband couldn't stop eating them, they whole batch was gone in a day and a half!! My search for a great sugar cookie recipe ends here. We also topped them with the sugar cookie frosting recipe from this site....yumm!!!"
"4","5","These were super easy to make, I highly recommend this recipe. I rolled the cookies in some sugar before I put them on the baking sheet to make them extra sugary. You can also sprinkle a little cinnamon with the sugar to make some snickerdoodle cookies, so its a two in one recipe!"
"4","5","These were the easiest cookies I've ever made! I used 2 tsp of vanilla like some other reviews suggested, and baked them for exactly 8 minutes. Very good, and they stay soft even after cooling. I will definitely make these again."
"4","5","These cookies are really great! Slightly chewy and very tender and sweet. Exactly what a sugar cookie should be. The dough does look crumbly, use your hands not a spoon or scoop to shape onto cookie sheet. Shape into balls, I did a little larger cookie and flattened them just a bit before putting into the oven. Also, take them out when the edges are just barely browning. If you overbake sugar cookies they will be hard. The only changes I made was increase the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons, and I added about 1/8 teaspoon of salt to balance out the sugar a little. Very easy and very tasty cookie!"
"4","5","These cookies turned out amazing! I have finally found the PERFECT easy sugar cookie recipe. Yay! I was really worried about how they would turn out though, because the dough was really crumbly at first. I found out that you have to mix the dough with your hand(s) to make it smoother. Before popping them into the oven, I rolled them in some sugar just to give them an extra 'layer'. They were sooo good!"
"4","5","Really really good! I finally found a sugar cookie recipe that tastes good- and that I don't have to roll! Every other sugar cookie recipe I have tried takes forever and always tastes like flour, but not this one! I altered it a little bit by adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla and I used my 2 teaspoon cookie scoop to make each cookie the same size and I rolled them in sugar before placing them on the rack. I also followed the 8 minute rule, then left them on the rack for exactly 2 minutes. Even if the top doesn't look done in the oven, the bottom is perfectly golden. I can't wait to make them with colored sugars for the holidays! Thanks!"
"4","1","Not sure why these have so many raves. I made them as posted and they were too greasy. I think too much butter was used. If I baked for 8 minutes they were softer and not hard on the bottom but if I went one more minute they were crispier, less buttery - but not good. :( This is a bad."
"4","5","These were soooo easy!! I read some other reviews and heard there might be an issue with the temperature of the butter so I decided to put the butter in the microwave. Well, I went a little overboard and it ended up completely melting. Not to worry though since my cookies still turned out great. I cooked for about 9 minutes, let cool, then brushed with a light frosting of powdered sugar, butter and milk. I topped them off with red sprinkles and they were perfect."
"4","5","I may have already reviewed this, but I would like to add. My family loves this recipe! I cannot make enough of them! to those who find the dough crumbly or hard to roll, don't be afraid to get your hands dirty and work the dough, after adding the flour, I do it the old-fashioned way, mixing by hand. It comes out very workable for rolling to cut out or making into balls. By the by the last batch I made (for my peanut's Halloween party) made almost 7 dozen!"
"4","5","I messed up (mid-mixing I accidently, and unbeknownst to me, clicked on another sugar cookie recipe & ended up adding 1/2C sour cream to THIS recipe as a result), so I can really only rate this on taste, not texture/consistency. These taste amazing! Really good; I didn't find them over-poweringly buttery at all, as some previous reviewers had mentioned. I'm looking forward to trying them again, w/just the ingredients THIS recipe calls for....(and I'll def be using this as a base for my future fruit pizzas!)."
"4","5","Perfect! I was hunting for a recipe that only needed one egg, because that is all we had. What I found is the best sugar cookie recipe I ever tried! I rolled them into balls and then my kids rolled them into different things before we baked them: sugar, sprinkles, cinnamon, mini chocolate chips.  One little tip, I thought it mixed better by hand, with a wooden spoon, than with a mixer."
"4","5","This was very quick & easy, and they taste great. I used a mix of unbleached white and whole wheat flour (2:1), because that's what I keep in my flour bin, and they're still soft and chewy. I used my small cookie scoop and they came out perfectly round. I baked up the first pan right when I mixed them up, and refrigerated the rest until the next morning. Both batches came out great - the refrigerated ones spread out a bit less, and needed one extra minute to bake."
"4","2","These cookies are too dry.... I tried them a different way, but there was no hope for them. It needs only like 2 cups of flour instead of 2 3/4.....and the cookies were just too dry."
"4","5","oh my goodness!!!! thank you so much for this recipe! these are the best sugar cookies i have ever had in my life! and my boyfriend loves them! what i did is made teaspoon size balls, rolled them in cinnamon sugar and they were even more delicious! these cookies rock!!!!!"
"4","2","Not sure why I didn't follow my instincts after reading the reviews and find a different recipe. This just didn't work for christmas cut-outs. The cookies spread out and lost their shape and for all the work of trying to get them unsticky for rolling, they just don't taste all that fabulous. Looks like there are many sugar cookie recipes on this site. My advice is to keep looking. Good luck!"
"4","4","This Recipe was awesome. It is easy and turned out amazing. I made a pinwheel cookie from these. I chilled the dough for about an hour and then rolled it out on a floured surface, spread melted butter with a pastry brush over the rolled out dough. I sprinkled cinnamon and white sugar over the butter, rolled the dough up like a carpet and chilled the dough overnight. I sliced the rolls in the morning and baked for 9 min. They were a huge hit! The only trouble I had was rolling the dough out on the counter, I added a bit of water to the dough and it fixed the problem right away. I'm making these cookies again for Christmas."
"4","1","These cookies are horrible! First off the dough is a pain to deal with! Second, if you leave them in for 15 seconds over 8 mins they turn to rock. Third, they are sugar cookies and if you stay with this recipes, you'll wind up with rock sugar cookies! Stay away from this recipe by all means!!!!!"
"4","5","Don't let their plain and simple disguise fool you. These cookies are very very good. I doubled the vanilla and added 1/8 teaspoon salt because I thought it probably needed it. Great recipe to go to when you want something simple and very fast!"
"4","5","Wonderful recipe. So simple to follow my 12 year old niece managed to make these by herself (except for the actual baking). Other than adjusting baking temp to 350 (my oven runs a little high), recipe is perfect. Even when adding a little too much flour, cookies were delicious."
"4","4","Very easy recipe. Way too much flour. I did add 2 eggs and a little water to moisten dough. Overall, they were very good. Kids and husband loved them!"
"4","5","Was in the mood for a really good sugar cookie and decided to try this recipe. Went through as many of the comments as I could, and decided to make these cookies using additional ingredients like a few people suggested. I used an extra 1/2 cup sugar, extra 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 extra egg. I am so impressed with how flavorful these cookies are. These cookies are EXCELLENT! I was afraid I would have to use icing like I normally do with other sugar cookies, but these are awesome just the way they are. I'm so happy I chose this recipe, it is going to be the one I use from now on. Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a quick, easy, great tasting sugar cookie recipe."
"4","5","This recipe is AWESOME for drop sugar cookies. I hate rolling out the dough and cutting them out. I strongly recommend adding an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla for flavor. While I was making them, my boyfriend kept picking at the batter and said how tasty it was. Before baking I sprinkled a mix of cinnamon and sugar over the cookie and flattened it a bit. They turned out great-- plus I made them twice as big. We LOVE them and next time I'll try doubling the recipe, because these won't last long!!"
"4","1","The batter was lumpy and crumbled easily. The dry ingredients entirely over-powered the wet ingredients, and the consistency of the batter was non-existant. The cookies came out with a taste that was vaguely reminiscent of cornbread."
"4","5","These cookies are great!! Easy recipe too. I'm eating one as I type this. :) I also mixed some food coloring and sugar to put it on some of the cookies before I baked them. I had a craving for something sweet and decided to make these cookies. I recommend this recipe if you want something quick, easy, and GREAT!!"
"4","5","These cookies really are great! Ever get a random craving for homemade sugar cookies, but don't feel like waiting hours before you can even cook them? Then this recipe is perfect for you! Most people have the ingredients right in their kitchen. I have batch number 3 in the oven right now. If you like your cookies to be a bit sweeter, then once the dough is in balls on the sheet, very slightly flatten them (Just to where the tops are fairly flat instead of round) and sprinkle sugar on top before baking. Delicious! And, as any kind of cookie, they're best served warm with a cold glass of milk. ;)"
"4","1","NEVER EAT THESE"
"4","4","They were for a valentine's day bakesale so I decided to make them much flatter, heart shapes and sprinkled with granular sugar. The batter was a bit too simple so my mum added some lemon zest and a pinch of salt. The result: Delicious, simple cookies, although they spread alot so keep a bit of space between each cookie, and if you're shaping them, take the poofy-ness into calculation. If you want them chewy, keep them round, if you want them crunchy/crispy, flatten them on the pan."
"4","5","These cookies tasted great and were easy to make. However, don't leave them out for long as they get hard quickly. To combat the hard cookies we just popped them into the microwave for 10 seconds and they tasted like they just came out of the oven! Will make again for sure."
"4","5","These cookies were soooooo good! They have very basic ingredients and are a snap to make! They're really buttery and can be used tons of different ways. I rolled them around in green and red sprinkles for Christmas and they were a hit!!"
"4","5","These made for a really good sugar cookie. I took the suggestions of some other reviews and added double the amount of vanilla. Also I added melted caramel, chocolate and pecans on top and made them into turtle sugar cookies. They came out wonderful!"
"4","5","This was the Best and easiest Sugar cookie recipe I have every found! Thank You. We even chilled it for a hour and used cookie cutters!"
"4","4","These cookies were good, but not great. They were a bit too sweet for my taste; but I took them to work and everyone loved them."
"4","5","these were so easy to make and everyone loved them! i wish i found this recipe earlier so we could of had them at Thanksgiving."
"4","5","I really wanted to make cookies today but didn't have many ingredients. I had to make half the recipe and used 2/4 of powdered sugar and 1/4 of regular sugar because that's all I had! Also I used pastry flour. I didn't have baking soda either so I just added a pinch of salt along with the baking powder. I also used an egg like many recommended. I didn't use cinnamon but I made a quick icing to put on the cookies and it was delicious!  Well despite all the change of ingredients, these cookies turned out to be some of the best sugar cookies I have tried. What I love most about them is how easy they are to make and how quickly they can be ready! I was able to use small cookie cutters even to make a variety of shapes.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I am so glad I found such an easy butter/sugar cookies. They are so soft which is always difficult to achieve for me! Next time I'll make sure to have all my ingredients though to see if they can be even better!"
"4","5","Everyone should try these cookies. They are absolutely fabulous! My four sons ate them up within minutes of taking the last pan out of the oven. They actually told me that these are even better then the best chocolate chip cookies they have had. I almost fell over! The only change I made was I added an extra egg and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. I also dipped the tops into cinnamon sugar before baking, and baked them for 7 minutes. They literally melt in your mouth! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"4","5","WOW!!! These cookies turned out EXCELLENT!!! I added approx. 3 extra tbsp. of softened butter into my batch b/c the mixture seemed a bit dry, and I mixed a 12 oz. bag of plain M&M's into the batch. These tasted identical to a certain cookie chain's sugar butter w/M&M's."
"4","5","Wow! I can't believe it! Finally, I have found a sugar cookie recipe. I love these cookies. They are easy to make, you don't have to refrigerate or roll the dough... perfect! I too, like others, added the extra egg. Baked at 375 for 10 minutes. I'm not a fan of super sweet desserts but, if you are, I might recommend adding a little more sugar to the recipe. These are fantastic!"
"4","5","Made these tonight and ate 6 myself already! This was a delicious and easy to make recipe! I did use an extra egg, and rolled half the batch in cinnamon sugar...The dough was pretty soft, I think if I chilled it it would be perfect for cookie cutters...Overall, this cookie was just delicious, better than any bakery sugar cookie! It will be on the holiday cookie rotation for sure!"
"4","5","oh my goodness these cookies are awesome! Add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract(or orange) to make them taste better!This is the best sugar cookie recipe EVER~~~ My mom also loves them i will use this recipe in the future for sure. These are a MUST BAKE! LOL!but make sure u eat them fast, because they get hard quick!"
"4","4","Per my husband's request, I needed a quick-n-easy cookie for him to take on a business trip. To the original ingredients I added 1/4 tsp almond extract and a dash of cinnamon. After mixing the dough, it looked dry, but allowing it to rest for a few minutes made it easier to roll. I made larger cookies by using a rounded Tbsp of dough, then rolled in sugar before baking -- 9 min. baking and 3 min. cooling on the sheet was perfect for this size. A big thanks from my husband (and me, too)!"
"4","5","These are actually very good cookies. I have made them twice and the flavor is good. What is surprising is everytime I make them, the dough is crumbly. I have to add just a bit of milk. From now on, if I use strictly butter I will add another egg. If I do half/half butter-crisco, it will probably be okay. If you find that you too, have crumbly dough, try some milk. I think an extra egg was left out of the initial ingredients. You don't want to add egg at the end though."
"4","5","Yum, these came out perfectly and I followed the recipe exactly! I rolled out the dough and made heart shaped cookies for Valentine's Day."
"4","4","These were great rolled in colored sugar, but not so good with the cookie cutters. They spread out too much and the dough is difficult to work with."
"4","5","THANKS Stephanie for this wonderful recipe! I have searched a long time for a great sugar cookie recipe and thanks to you I now have one. They taste like Golden Corrals sugar cookies. Definitely a keeper! Crisp on the outside and chewey on the inside. Quick & Easy!"
"4","5","This was my first try at making Holiday cutout cookies. My plan is to give away the cookies as Christmas presents along with some other home-made sweets. I read all the reviews and made the following adjustments. Added 1 tsp. almond extract. I doubled the recipe and mixed it with a Bosch Kitchen machine w/ cookie whips. It resembled pie dough. I rolled it on a lightly floured pastry cloth with a pastry sock on my rolling pin. I left them slightly undercooked, approx 8 min. @ 340 degrees. THESE TURNED OUT PERFECT!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe. ALL TIME FAMILY FAVORITE!!!"
"4","5","these are great! i didn't find them too dry at all! When you mix up the dough it looks a little dry but the trick is to make sure you knead the dough in your hands so the butter comes through. I rolled them into balls. Dipped them in a bowl of sugar and cinnamon. Placed them on my cookie sheet. Then I made a design in the top by making two fork dents of them. I've added this recipe to my collection to use again! yummmm!"
"4","5","Best and easiest sugar cookie I've tried on this site so far. Delicious light flavor, and not too sweet. I used margarine instead of butter and they turned out fine. Rolled in sugar before baking, and they turned out cracked and beautiful. Wonderful recipe :)"
"4","1","I used Splenda instead of sugar. I don't know if it was that, or the recipe, but they just weren't very good. Tasteless and a little dry. I'm sorry! I really wanted to like it!"
"4","5","So easy, so perfect. I do flatten them out because they dont spread very well. When I try to 'eat healthy' I don't make these because it is physically impossible to eat just one or two. Sooo addicting."
"4","5","I rolled mine in colored sugar for Christmas and cinnamon and sugar for other occasions. Everyone loves them and they were so easy. I did need to melt the butter slightly to get it to mix well, however."
"4","5","I made these to be taken to a party at work. The only problem was that I didn't have any of the cookies to take home with me! I'll definitely make them again. They're easy to make and taste great. They've got a terrific texture with a slightly chewy center and crispy outer edges. These cookies are delicious and easy, the perfect combination!"
"4","5","Wow, I was surprised at the ease of making these cookies. My husband has not stopped raving about them. This is definately a keeper of a recipe. Yummy"
"4","5","THANKS FOR THE GREAT AND EASY SUGER COOKIE RECIPE. MY KIDS LIVED IT. THE MIX WAS EASY AND DEFINENTLY KID PROOF."
"4","5","The best sugar cookie recipe I have ever found! People love them & always ask when will I be making more!"
"4","5","The perfect cookie! Not too sweet, crisp around the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. Good with icing or plain. I also made them with a dash of lemon juice and an extra dash of vanilla. Buttery good!"
"3","2","These cookies aren't bad but they weren't that good either, just not the right texture for me"
"3","5","Best cookies I've ever made"
"3","5","After reading all the reviews, I decided to use 2 eggs and used 2 tsps of vanilla and they came out perfect! They were soft and chewy!"
"3","5","Easy-peasy recipe! Make sure to beat the butter and sugar mixture until light and fluffy. I use large eggs. If you use medium sized, perhaps add an extra. I like to fold in the dry mixture by hand. I had no need to refrigerate the dough. Rolled them into balls, rolled some in coloured sugar, some in crushed candy canes, some in cinnamon and sugar, and some plain. The dough balls also freeze easily in a cookie sheet. Once frozen, pop into a freezer bag for use anytime!"
"3","4","Pretty good recipe. I thought they were slightly bland, however. I put an extra bit of vanilla in my second and third batches. Also, I used a vegetable oil spread instead of butter the third go round just because it's what I had on hand. My oh my what a difference. Soft, chewy, and flavorful! The other reviewers were spot on. Make sure your butter is completely soft, and don't overcook. I actually thought mine were going to be way too raw but they finished cooking after I took them out and set perfectly. Huge hit at a baby shower and house party!"
"3","1","I am so angry that I made this recipe, and I blame allrecipe.com. Let me explain. I searched for 'sugar cookie' on the website and I sorted by rating. 'Easy sugar cookies' comes up at the top of the list, while 'chewy sugar cookies' comes up several pages later. So I made the 'easy sugar cookies' by mistake, They are dry and lack flavor."
"3","4","I followed the recipe exactly and mine came our PERFECT! Chewy, crispy edges and wonderful taste."
"3","5","The best sugar cookie recipe ever. This is for sure a keeper."
"3","5","Made these as per recipe several times already. I do prefer with 2 tsp of vanilla."
"3","3","I like this recipe i just add my own little twist to it"
"3","5","Delicious and incredibly versatile. I messed up with creaming the butter and sugar together so it didn't come together properly. I added a bit of water and turned it into a giant cookie that came out great."
"3","5","Easy and delicious! I made them on a flute. The my boys loved them."
"3","5","I've tried making hundreds of sugar cookie batches before, and they have never turned out right. But these cookies are AMAZING!!! When they were baking it looked like they weren't cooking at all, but when I took them out after ten minuets they browned and crisped. I have never found a receptive so pleasing and I would defiantly recommend it. The only down side is the batter was the tiniest bit dry as I was adding the flour in so I put in about 4 tablespoons if milk to soften it a little. Otherwise, this is an outstanding recipe!!!"
"3","1","Save your time and don't make these cookies I know I am younge and it might seem i would mess up, but I didn't. I made these by the recipe and I took it out of the oven at * min and it tastes like some type of sweet popcorn. Then when it cooled down it turned dry and hard as heck and it wasn't even burned. This is the second time I spent my time making these and it turned out bad."
"3","5","I have tried this recipe several times and especially over the holidays and it's tried and true and always comes out perfect. This is the best sugar cookie ever, and you can't go wrong. I've tried it without vanilla, using self rising flour and it always comes out perfect and with great flavor. If you have unsalted softened butter, flour an egg and of course sugar, you can make sugar cookies. HAPPY BAKING"
"3","1","I made sure the butter and egg was room temp and this recipe is still inedible. Too much flour I think."
"3","1","I am extremely disappointed. Usually, when there are recipes with this many stars they are good... this was awful. I made it per the instructions and it was so crumbly I couldn't even shape them into cookies to bake them. I read some of the reviews, and one pointed out the need for the butter to be extremely softened. I tried again with butter as softened as possible before it becomes melted. The 'dough' was still extremely crumbly. I tried baking them anyway, they stayed in the balls and were not at all cookie like. My advice, use a different recipe!"
"3","5","Very Yummy and the recipe makes enough to share with the neighbors. The only thing I did different was rolled out the dough and made cut-out cookies. Turned out great. Thank you for sharing the recipe"
"3","5","I tried this recipe and was a little discouraged with the negative reviews, but they came out delicious! They were a little thin, but that was because I only added a little bit less flour than as listed. I followed advice from a review stating that in order to make perfect, chewy, and soft cookies, the secret to that is making sure the butter is super soft before creaming them. I am eating one now with a glass of milk, and I can tell you that this recipe is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever eaten. My whole family loves them! They are extraordinarily mouth-watering!"
"3","5","These are so easy to make just make sure your butter is completely soften. I used margarine and worked well."
"3","5","Great! With the modifications I made, that is. The dough was really hard and crumbly, but I added a second egg and everything was great. I also added half a teaspoon of almond extract and salt and sprinkled sugar sprinkles over the dough when I put it on the tray. Delicious!"
"3","3","I made this recipe, and like others, I had to tweak it to make it work. The cookies taste good, but I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of the 1 teaspoon called for in the recipe. As I was mixing them, they were as dry as the Sahara Desert, so I added 1/4 cup of milk until the dough was of the correct consistency. The dryness was NOT due to the butter being too hard or cold either, because I had left my butter out on my counter for a full day before I used it. I also cut down the flour by 1/4 cup. The other thing I had to do was to bake them for only 7 1/2 minutes in my oven. I don't know if my oven runs hot or not, but the first batch that went into the oven was too brown for me. I prefer a less brown, softer cookie. When I made all of those changes, the cookies turned out good and they taste fine, but because of that, I can only give this 3 stars. Too many changes and it isn't even the same recipe anymore. I would make them again, but only with my changes and with frosting on them."
"3","5","I love this recipe. I have made it countless times and each time it was no less than perfect. The last time I made it, the mixture became quite dry. So I added about 1/4 cup of milk to it. When I was done baking, the cookies were the most delicious I have ever tasted. I love this recipe so much, sometimes I add homemade cream cheese frosting on top and it tastes great! The cookies are also awesome to bring to bake sales and are awesome as a desert. I highly recommend this recipe to anybody, they're super easy to cook!"
"3","3","Have to say I was not happy with this recipe. The taste is great and what I was looking for but they did not spread and become thin as I wanted them to. So I ended up with slightly flatter balls. Anyway, I will still continue my search for a sugar cookie that I like."
"3","5","Oh my goodness! This is a great recipe! It's easy to make, and they are absolutely delicious! Definetly going in my top 5 list! I just love the crunch on the outside and the gooey cookie on the inside. I do recommend pressing the dough down before you bake them, or they will stay risen in a ball kind of"
"3","5","I just tried this recipe and LOVED IT! Many people reviewed this recipe with harsh comments on the cookies being very hard.. HOWEVER, there's a solution to your problem. Make sure your butter is completely softened, or your cookies won't turn out! Another thing, which I discovered while reading someone else's review before I made my cookies is 8 minutes is all you need if you're eyeing the soft cookies, and 10 minutes is too much - your cookies will turn out too crispy. Oh, and the reason you can't use cookie cutters is because you have to refrigerate the dough before using cookie cutters. That being said, hope your cookies turn out better! (:"
"3","4","I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe that didn't require chilling first. I read the reviews on this recipe and decided to give it a shot The only reason this recipe does not get five stars is because I altered oven temp and cooking time. Others had said cookies were hard and fell apart. I baked mine at 350 for 12 minutes and oh my goodness these are now my favorite cookies! I rolled mine into a ball and rolled them into homemade colored sugar and they are wonderful! My family can't keep their hands off of them!"
"3","5","They were delicious!"
"3","5","I LOVE this recipe. I have searched high and low for a good simple drop sugar cookie recipe. I have a few pieces of advice about it though. It's worth the small amount of extra care though, never fear!  1. MAKE SURE to use stick form of butter of butter or margerine, and make sure it's COMPLETELY SOFTENED. Seems silly to specify but you really gotta make sure. Otherwise the dough doesn't come out right.  2. I always add a hearty pinch of coarse salt. It sets off the sweetness of this recipe and makes it not such a cloying flavor. It's absolutely delicious.  3. Always slightly undercook this cookie. They come out perfectly right before or right as the browning starts to happen. When they cool, they stay perfectly soft and light. You might have a different preference but I find it tastes the best this way.  I think I am going to go make some more right now!"
"3","5","So like everyone says make sure your butter is very soft, leave it out for the night before or something so there is no question. First off I adjusted to recipe to make 50 cookies (this site will do it for you). And instead of one teaspoon of vanilla I used two teaspoons. Also my husband and I are not big icing fans so I also rolled my little teaspoon rounded sugar cookie balls in sugar, let's just say those cookies were gone in two days by three ppl, over 50 cookies by 3 ppl! My husband said they were so good he could eat himself sick! And very easy recipe, I have never made sugar cookies or any cookie from scratch by myself and they turned out wonderful! One last hint: if you have a mixer to mix the dry ingredients into the butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla cream it will make it much easier on you and your arm;) Good Luck, you shouldn't need it, to those who are looking to make this recipe! N Thank You so much to the person who posted it!"
"3","5","I really love this recipe. It's so easy and fast, every ingredient I already had in my kitchen. You can even pop the dough in the refrigerator for an hour and roll it out to make cut-outs. The only thing I suggest is for electric ovens (which is what I use) I'd bake for 5-7 minutes, not exceeding 7 minutes. Since the temperature is at 375 degrees Fahrenheit, my first batch burned when left in for 8 minutes, so I decreased it to 7 when the dough is fresh, and they came out nice and chewy. If you want to make cut-outs, I'd suggest baking them for 5 minutes and not exceeding that at best, my first batch burned at 7 minutes, so my presumption is because they're flatter when they go in, they bake for less time. All in all excellent recipe, the young ones love them! Happy Holidays all!"
"3","5","I made this to make colorful pinwheel cookies for my daughter's school. It was very easy to make. Yes, making sure the butter is soft is a good idea, but that is a good idea for any recipe that calls for you to cream butter, just makes it easier. As for the reviewers that found the recipe 'crumbly' - yes, it is crumbly if you don't work the dough. All you need to do is put on some gloves (or use bare, washed hands) and work the dough together. The butter in the recipe will work its way through and the dough is VERY easy to work with but it has to be properly mixed. Taste was great - I too added a little extra vanilla but that is based on personal preference. Definitely will be using again, as I'm already making my second batch of the day!"
"3","5","I loved this recipe! It is SO easy and the dough doesn't need to chill. I sometimes add colored sprinkles on the dough and then bake them. The cookies have a nice sugary crunch. SO delicious! :)"
"3","5","I used two eggs instead of one. It was my first time making sugar cookies and they seemed really dry. They're really good with two. If your batter seems really dry add another egg. More than two will ruin it though. The most eggs you should use is TWO and only two."
"3","5","This recipe is exactly what it says it is. It deserves 4 or 5 stars. I am not the kind of person who gives a recipe 1 star because i did not follow directions or because 'i do not like sugar cookies' if your's did not turn out it is because you did something wrong. you can NOT use splenda in this, you can NOT use cookie cutters. this is not a roll out dough. this is a great and easy sugar cookie recipe. these are so delicious! they are so easy my husband made them! People... if you are going to change the recipe, do not leave a review."
"3","5","This recipe is a keeper! I only made a couple changes to it. I mixed the flour in a little at a time. I stopped when the dough started to feel stiff enough. I had little less than 1/4 cup flour left over. Instead of using the full amount of white sugar I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract instead of one.  Also I didn't find that these cookies spread much. I only put 6 cookies on each cookie sheet I put in the oven. I do think that I could have squeezed 8 in without any trouble at all.  I'm sure my husband will be grinning from ear to ear when he gets home this evening...:o)"
"3","4","A few things you have to change when baking these:  1) Bake at 350, not 375, or they will burn! 2) Bake for only 8 minutes, and cool for only 1 minute on the tray before moving to a cooling rack. 3) Double the egg, or you will get sand instead of dough 4) Double the Vanilla Extract for more taste 5) Roll the cookies in sugar and bake them as balls to stop them from spreading too thin (Place 1 1/2in. apart on the cookie sheet)  If you follow these tips, and the recipe, they turn out absolutely delightful, no complaints! Great for frosting and decorating too :)"
"3","5","I had to make 200 of these for my church. finished in four hours. super easy and you know all great cooks must taste the finished product lol. loved loved loved them!"
"3","1","The only reason I gave it 1 star is because it actually turned into scones and was edible. I followed the ingredients and directions to the tee. These cookies actually did not spread out instead they rose and turned into scones. :("
"3","1","The batter came out crumbly and the cookies came out hard. I baked them for 8-10 minutes as directed"
"3","3","Delicious dough, but I would not recommend these cookies for rolled out/cookie cutter cookies. I popped the batter into the freezer to make it easier to work with, and still after nearly an hour, the dough was barely workable. The only way I was able to make cutouts that remained in the cutter or that I was easily able to carry over to my baking tray was if I left the dough rather thick. This backlashed on me, and caused enormous cookies (not bad for everyone-- they just looked weird in the cutter I had). When I could see the cookies weren't turning out the right way I wanted, I decided just to roll the remaining dough into balls. So I guess I could take the blame for trying to use this recipe for cutout cookies, since the creator of this recipe didn't specifically recommend to use this for cutouts.... On the plus side, the taste was fantastic! Very sweet, but that's how I like my sugar cookies."
"3","5","No fail recipe for beginners like me! Rated as delicious by my expert chef friend who teaches baking. Yummy with lemon zest!"
"3","5","Refrigerate and add a little extra flour to be able to roll out the dough for shapes."
"3","1","i dont know if i did somthing wrong but the cookies didn't turn out good. i did everything right. i did tell my dad not to heat the butter to much, and it only mealted a little bit. i put the cookies in the oven for 8 minutes, then when i took the cookies out, they were litarly boiling! they were liqidy, and spread all over the tray."
"3","5","Wow - like this recipe needs another review, but my kids insisted! lol This recipe was really easy for them to do and it turned out wonderfully. We also made variations using chocolate chips & walnuts & cocoa powder for a chocolaty cookie which turned out great too. Made another version topped with chopped peanuts (before baking) and a 1/4tsp of jam (after baking) and my hubby loves those - this is definitely a keeper :)"
"3","5","Omg Mine taste so good! Instead of vanilla extract I used a spoonful of vanilla icecream and then because there was too much flour i added half a cup of milk it came out so delicious :)"
"3","4","This is one of the fastest and simplest (yet good!) cookie recipes I have ever made. Per an earlier reviewer's suggestion I made sure my butter was VERY soft (almost melted), plus I added 1/2 tsp almond extract and just a dash of salt. They got rave reviews! This is sure to become a spur-of-the-moment staple in my baking repertoire."
"3","1","Hard as a rock. Thought I would warn others before I deleted the recipe."
"3","5","absolutly amazing"
"3","4","I followed the recipe and this was easy for a novice baker like myself. The first time I made them I didn't soften the butter enough so they came out crumbly. The second time around was much better and I was able to roll them out and use cookie cutters. The texture was soft and slightly crispy. I also made my own frosting using about a cup of confectionary sugar mixed with a couple teaspoons of almond milk."
"3","5","Very easy and very good. Followed recipe exact. A+"
"3","5","Oh My Goodness! These cookies are AWESOME! I read so many reviews and will share the tips that worked best for me: #1: I used margarine and left it out for 2 hours until it was room temperature. #2: I used 2 eggs - instead of 1, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract - instead of 1. #4: I rolled the balls of dough in a bowl of cinnamon and sugar before baking them. #4: DESPITE THE 'UNDONE' LOOK of the cookies at 8 minutes....I still took them out of the oven. I let them cool and feel in LOVE at first BITE! These are awesome cookies - follow the directions and you will be successful! WOWSERS!"
"3","4","Came out a little dry, but were pretty good. Made sure my butter was nice and soft, as I have always found that to be the trick with sugar cookies. But all in all, I'd use it again ... maybe adding 1 TB of butter more."
"3","5","These cookies were truly easy to make and tasted delicious! Will make these again!"
"3","3","The cookies taste like flour and my kids won't eat them. I am going to take some suggestions from other revies next time and use an extra egg and less flour. I think that they will be great as other reviewers have stated with the adjustments."
"3","2","I didn't like these much at all. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they were very bland and tasted like flour. I refrigerated the dough before trying to work with it and that ended up making it hard as a rock, to the point that I had to microwave it to be able to even get a spoon in it. I rolled the dough into balls and thye baked up extremely poofy. I think if I had made them into cutouts they would have looked even worse. I dislike really sweet or sugary foods but even these weren't sweet enough for me. They tasted of flour and little else."
"3","5","This recipe was great I did however add my own little touch, I added a little salt and more vanilla. I also rubbed margerine on my hands to keep them from sticking while I was rolling them into balls,this gave then a nice color while keeping them crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. I also rolled them in cinnamon sugar, and some I simply rolled in sprinkles I believe any type will work work it made for a very pretty Christmas cookies. I look forward to trying this recipe again with other toppings. I would definately recommend this recipe for a cook at any level."
"3","2","they're not sweet enough for me."
"3","5","I was skeptical because this recipe is SO simple compared to other sugar cookie recipes but honestly the cookies came out PERFECT!!! I was so happy!!! I made them exactly as the recipe stated, refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes to harden it up, and then rolled the dough into little balls and used a small bowl of flour to make them nice and smooth. Baked them for about 8-9 minutes and came out perfect. Used the ''decorator frosting'' recipe on here, and my christmas cookies are amazing!"
"3","4","Solid recipe; I would definitely make this again. I added a little more vanilla than it called for, partially to cancel out the fact that I had to use mostly salted butter when I usually use unsalted for baking. Next time I'll double the recipe - I feel like I could eat all these cookies myself! :-)"
"3","1","I followed this recipe exactly and there was something not quite right about them. My children weren't pleased either."
"3","5","This is the first recipe I've EVER attempted, and I must say that every time I make these, they come out perfect. I even made these for easter, and my grandma (who's practically the baking expert of her lifetime) loved them :D Don't make these without the butter completely soft. Otherwise from what I hear they won't turn out great. These arent really the type that can make good cutter cookies, but you CAN dip them in some colored sprinkles. These are also good with some extra vanilla extract if you want the flavor stronger, or cocoa powder to make a chocolate alternative."
"3","1","So, huge disappontment we followed the directons exactlly we wanted to make cookies for a charity event but we ended up wasting time and money, tasted like eggs and was visually unappealing"
"3","5","Made these for Halloween, frosted and decorated them. They were EASY, EASY, EASY, and tasted PERFECT!!! I did end up leaving out about 3/4 c of the flour mixture after seeing how dry and crumbly the dough was. This resulted in the cookies texture being just right... a little crunchy around the edges and soft in the middle. Yummm. :)"
"3","5","These are the best sugar cookies ever! If you are like me and put them too close together and end up with one big cookie for your first batch, a pizza cutter separates them nicely after they cool 2 min. I've rolled a batch in sugar, put a sugar cookie glaze on a batch, and my last batch I added a little cinnamon to the dry ingredients to make snicker doodles. Wonderful! 8 min and they're chewy, 10 min and crunchy... both good. If you leave them in too long the ole 'slice of bread in the air tight container' works great to make them soft again. You HAVE to try these! Make the balls small and give them plenty of space!"
"3","5","It was later in the evening and my sweet tooth started up. I had some frosting in the fridge to use up so I thought why not sugar cookies.   My sweet tooth was satisfied in about 15 minutes!! These were so fast. I halved the recipe. From there I froze half the dough and then baked about 12 cookies. I used my pizza stone and baked them for about 8 minutes. They turned out PERFECT. So soft, so chewy. Perfect sugary buttery flavor. To be honest they don't even need frosting. Glad to have found a 'go to' sugar cookie recipe!  **Note: I doubled the vanilla per personal preference. I also put my frozen butter in the microwave for a minute. Wasn't completely melted but right on the verge."
"3","5","This recipe was quick and easy and it tasted amazing! I rolled the cookies in cinnamon and sugar and it was so delish! I def. will be using this again!!!!"
"3","4","Be very careful on your cook time... take them out way before they look done, or they'll cool to really crunchy."
"3","5","YUM YUM YUM. Nice and soft."
"3","5","I followed the recipe and they were wonderful drop sugar cookies. I did add 1/4 tsp. of salt to balance out the sweet and added cherry chips. I will make these again!"
"3","5","These cookies were so yummy! i am a 13 year old girl who loves to cook... and i wanted to learn a new recipe while my relatives were over from all over the US! they loved these cookies, and i ended up making 2 more batches after i had made one batch! then about 2 weeks after that happended my mom wanted soem cookies to brign into work , so i was like ill just make oyu some snicherdoodles tomarrrow, and she remembered this cookie and said that she had been dreaming about them for ever! These cookies are amazing and very quick and easy to make! Now i probablymake a batch a week!!"
"3","5","I just got done making these, and they are sooo simple and so delicious!   I only had 1/2 c butter, so I halved the recipe. I prefer Almond to Vanilla extract, so I used that instead. Like other reviewers, I recommend *very* soft butter; Mine was practically melted. I did also dip them in sugar, but it's definitely not a necessary step.  They spread out in the oven, but to a perfect thickness! Take them out at 8 minutes (I did 10, but my oven runs cool) and let them cool. They'll be soft and chewy!"
"3","5","These are amazing. This is the first recipe I have ever tried on this website (I'm 15 by the way) and I loved it. I actually ended up with 36 instead of 48, but nevertheless they are simply delicious."
"3","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe ever! I only wanted a dozen cookies so I 1/4 the recipe and baked it at 350 degrees F for 12 minutes. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. It came out soft, chewy, and delicious! I will never go back to store-bought frozen cookie dough!"
"3","2","My husband and I agreed these should have been called Easy Flour Cookies.... It just seemed to be WAY too much flour. Maybe I did something wrong? I'm not sure. But we didn't enjoy them at all."
"3","5","These were so good! I added cinnamon and nutmeg."
"3","5","This is my new favorite sugar cookie recipe! It is super-easy, fast and absolutely delicious. The secret is to let the butter soften completely (overnight on the counter, if possible). The dough whips up in five minutes. I used two teaspoons of vanilla bean paste instead of extract. I also sprinkled the cookies with sugar when they came out of the oven and were still warm. Oven temperatures vary, but I found that nine minutes was perfect for my oven. Using a cookie scoop keeps them uniform in size. They were just right. I will make these from now on whenever we want sugar cookies!"
"3","5","Delicious! I rolled the balls in colored sugar before baking. I followed the recipe as written and they turned out perfect!"
"3","5","so easy and yummy!! i baked mine at 350 for 10 mins."
"3","5","These are better sugar cookies then the ones you roll out. I make a bigger cookie and increase the baking time a little. For some reason (to me) it makes a much better cookie. After making them into a ball, I flatten them just a little and springle a little sugar on top. These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made...and...I bake a lot!!"
"3","5","Didn't change a thing. These were light and fluffy perfect sugar drop cookies. Perfect for a weekly baking item with my toddler. Not too sweet, not too heavy. Great recipe!"
"3","5","My 15 year old made these rolled in sugar. fantastic and easy."
"3","5","Great and easy. Thought I'd need to flatten the balls but I definitely didn't--they cooked up into perfect little cookies. I added fresh lemon zest and replaced the vanilla with fresh lemon juice. Then I made a lemon glaze with powdered sugar, lemon juice and fresh lemon zest. YUM! An easy and versatile recipe, as I am sure you could flavor these many different ways..."
"3","5","All I can say is 'Yum'! And these were so much easier to make than roll-out cookies. While I will still make the roll-out kind for Christmas-giving, these are definitely my new 'go-to' cookie for when the kids and I get a craving!"
"3","5","These cookies are dangerously delicious and quite easy to make! I'm addicted to them :) (not good on the waistline). I've made them at least 10 times. As others comment, the key is to use butter that is room temperature or softened (not melted) in the microwave. I use almond extract-about 1 1/2 tsp. For Christmas, I rolled dough in red sugar. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly."
"3","5","I loved this recipe! I softened butter in the microwave. I added sugar, egg, and vanilla, and a touch of almond extract. Then, with a hand mixer I mixed, mixed, mixed, until fluffy and really combined. I only had self rising flour so I left out baking powder but added the baking soda. Then added the flour to the butter mix a little at a time. This is a stiff batter, as sugar cookies always are. I took a handfull of dough and rolled into 12 in log about half dollar size thick. I cut into 12 pieces and used cinn and sugar on some, just sugar on others. These were easy and good! Made about 7 dozen!"
"3","5","These were really good! I made some for my brothers and their friends and they loved them! Thanks(:"
"3","4","Overall a very good cookie! The dough came out a little stiff/crumbly, but handled well enough to shape into balls. My family prefers a chewier cookie, so I reduced butter to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I also increased vanilla to 2 teasp. and added a 1/4 teasp of lemon extract to add a little 'lemony' kick. One extra tip: DO NOT overbake or cookie will get too hard. I baked mine for 7 minutes, then let them finish 'cooking' on the cookie sheet for a minute before removing them to the rack. Delicious!"
"3","5","Great! So...partly for fun and partly to avoid going to the store, I made a few changes and they came out very tasty :o) I substituted one mashed banana and 1/2c. coconut oil for the butter and doubled the vanilla."
"3","5","Was feeling for a sweet snack and decided to look for a quick and easy recipe and I found this one. I felt guilty after I tasted these cookies because I couldn't stop tasting. I probably gained a pound however, I will make them again. Great cookie recipe"
"3","1","I was bored so i tried making these for friends and family, they were salty!"
"3","2","Followed the recipe step by step and it didn't turn out...I made three different batches and each batch I put either more sugar in or vanilla and they get a little bit better, but not much."
"3","1","Read some reviews, though that since most of them are good, I should try it. Turned out exactly as on the picture, but tasted awful! I did everything exactly like it says on the recipe, but they taste bitter. What a waste of time and ingredients, plus now my whole apartment smells weird cause of these cookies. I can't get rid of the taste."
"3","5","I made the cookies exactly as indicated and was skeptical because the doah did not look right because after mixing it looked like pie doah (lots of little pea sized crumbles). I thought this is too dry and was tempted to add something. It's a good thing I didn't because they turned out great! Just put a tablespoon pile in your hand and squish it together and the doah will look great. I rolled into a ball (was skeptical here too because regular sugar cookies are suppossed to be rolled). They flattened out perfectly and my 'sugar cookie' expert boyfriend deemed them the best cookie he ever had...better than his mothers! Now that was a complement."
"3","5","Very easy and delicious - the cookies stayed soft."
"3","1","I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I am an experienced cookie maker and these turned out horribly. They were flavorless, way to sweet, and the most bizarre thing.. they flattened into thin crispy nothingness! I will not make this version again."
"3","5","I wanted a cookie that I could whip together in minutes and these were great! I softened my butter as suggested and the cookies were perfect."
"3","5","Great cookies...easy to make. Had my 3 year old grandson help me make a batch for Santa Claus. We put red and green sugar sprinkles on top of them. They tasted great. I would recommend this recipe."
"3","5","Normally I avoid making sugar cookies because they are so time consuming, but this recipe is perfect! No refrigerating the dough, or cutting out cookies & no need to decorate if you don't want to. I did what was recommended & only used teaspoonfuls of dough, I will say they do really expand nicely, but the teaspoon just gives you a bite-sized cookie. Next time I make these I'll make the rounds of dough a bit bigger."
"3","4","Good cookies and very simple. But do make sure the butter is melted when mixing. I didn't have that problem but I saw that others did. My batch came out very soft and delicious but my opinion is that they should be more sugary - hello!, they are 'sugar cookies'. So next time I make them I am going to add more sugar to mine, that is all."
"3","2","They may be easy but they're tasteless and cakey and unappetizing."
"3","5","I have made these cookies for about 2 years now and I love them...The dough is crumbly but when you squish them into a ball in your hand it stays together nicely..I made my cookies big and when I put the ball on the pan I used the palm of my hand and pushed down a bit, not flat but just so it wasn't in a ball anymore and it turned out perfectly round...This recipe has a slight buttery/floury taste to me which is awesome. Not too sweet....I would advise like other people, leave your butter out all day long before you use..I 'creamed' the butter and sugar for about 5 minutes until it was so fluffy and airy which made the cookie taste that way..."
"3","4","Hey Everyone, So I just recently made this cookies! Awesome! Everyone loved them!! Although, they didn't expand as much as I thought they would and wanted them to! Any suggestions!?? Thanx =)"
"3","5","Very good Simple Sugar Cookie, I made several batches of these for Thanksgiving and they were eaten up!"
"3","1","Yes, it would've been much nicer to know that the butter needs to be not just soft, but very very smooth before I began baking."
"3","5","These are a perfect sugar cookie. They came out perfectly soft. I don't know how some people's dough was coming out crumbly & dry, if you follow the recipe there should be no problem. Make sure your butter is softened, not just room temp. I usually put it in the microwave for 15 sec or so and take out just shy of melting. Also, creaming the butter...you must really cream the butter! Whip it for awhile!"
"3","4","I must admit, the recipe is a bit wonky for some reason. I measure everything very precise and I too had crumbly dough. I added another 1/4 of butter which fixed it. My butter was completely soft, so that wasn't the problem. My egg was on the small side so that could have been part of the trouble. But after adding the extra butter, the dough was soft and easy to work with. We rolled them into 1' balls and cooked them for 10 minutes. Turned out great. Excellent flavor! They are cooling right now, we will be frosting them soon!"
"3","5","good job"
"3","5","Made these exactly as the recipe states, and they taste amazing! Love that they are not too sweet, and I think I may even go less on the vanilla next time. I chilled the dough and rolled it out to make pumpkin cutouts. The dough spreads really easily so I don't recommend using cookie cutters with a lot of detail (the ghosts and bats ended up like big blobs). I rolled it out to 1/4 inch and took them out at 6 minutes. Definitely making some Thanksgiving cookies with this recipe next!! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!"
"3","5","Would give it 10 stars if I could. A huge favorite at our house. I watched them closely in the oven and took them out while they still looked underdone. Perfectly crispy edges with chewy center."
"3","5","I was in need of a kid-friendly, easy cookie, and this fit the bill. It takes very few ingredients and the dough was very easy to work with. I just used my cookie scoop, rolled them in sprinkles, and the kids in my class loved them."
"3","5","This recipe is definitely a keeper! They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are very good and so easy to make."
"3","3","This makes an ok cookie. It wasn't my favorite sugar cookie ever."
"3","5","Super Easy! Super Good. I suggest making the balls a little bigger than 1 tsp, maybe a TBS. Also, even though it doesn't require refrigeration, if you do put it in the fridge for an hour or so, the cookies won't spread as much and you'll get more of a mound tha a super flat cookie. Either way, it's so yummy!"
"3","5","great cookies, and i'm usually not a fan of plain sugar cookies. I let the butter soften and took them out just before 8 minutes, and they ended up the perfect texture-soft on the inside, just a little crunch on the outside."
"3","5","I love making these cookies! It is so easy!"
"3","1","the batter is butter. complete butter no joke. i really wasted an hour to make these"
"3","5","This is an excellent basic sugar cookie recipe. I made them 'lemon cookies' by substituting lemon curd (I used the Trader Joe's brand) for some of the butter and substituting lemon extract for the vanilla. They were chewy and delicious!"
"3","1","i love cookies but these tasted like salt and baking soda"
"3","3","They were very very easy to make!! (which was what I was looking for) But they were not very sweet. TIP: If you roll them up in a ball and roll them in a bowl of sugar and cinnamon before placing them on a cookie sheet you get snicker doodles!! :D"
"3","5","So good. the dough is easy to roll and tastes YUMMMMMMMM!!!! I made heart shaped ones, punctured a hole and once cool, tied a pink or silver ribbon into regular or some died pink dough. This is for a friend's Bat Mitzvah! Amazing for all occasions!"
"3","4","These cookies were delicious! M&M's were the perfect addition! Only 4 stars because I'd use a little more butter to make them less dry and more gooey. I did have a hard time with the dough falling apart."
"3","5","Excellent cookies! My nieces and nephew wanted to make sugar cookies with me and I wanted a recipe that didn't require chilling, rolling and cutting, or cream of tartar. This recipe was perfect. After rolling the dough into balls, we flattened them with a drinking glass dipped in white sugar. I made a few high-altitude adjustments because their home is at almost 6,000 feet: Reduced butter to 2/3 cup, reduced baking powder to a scant 1/2 teaspoon, increased baking temp to 390 degrees F. At that temperature, 9 minutes was a perfect baking time. I'll definitely make these again."
"3","1","i do not recomend these cookies"
"3","5","My batch produced 30 cookies with my cookie scoop. Baked at about 12 minutes. Very buttery. Benefited from the 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Update: Made these again with an extra egg and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Rolled a few in cinnamon sugar and frosted the rest. They were gobbled up! So easy, especially since I had to cream the butter and sugar by hand."
"3","5","My name is Julia and I am 7 years old.I made these delicious cookies with my neighbor.There are special because we put m+ms.They were the best cookies I ever made.They were soft,warm,and buttery. I agree! These were easy to make. We used 2 teaspoons vanilla and that was the only change. M+m's were added after 7 minutes of cooking. Then back to oven for 90 seconds. Best sugar cookie we have ever eaten. This is a keeper."
"3","5","Super easy recipe that makes beautiful, yummy cookies. I did leave out about 1/4c flour, because the dough was so doughy that I couldn't mix it anymore. Great to make with a child!"
"3","5","I agree with the advice to use VERY softened MARGARINE, rolling them in sugar, and cooking 8 minutes ONLY for nice soft cookies. A teaspoon was too small for us; a tablespoon is more like the right amount unless you want bite-size cookies. I'd be willing to do this recipe again. I was tempted to do a ready-made cookie batter, but I'm glad I didn't. This recipe makes a much better cookie than a mix. I'm better at cooking than baking and even I didn't mess these up. My kids and I had fun making them."
"3","1","I love sugar cookies, so when I read all the great reviews I thought I would try them. Never again!!!! The dough,when mixed, was very sticky. I could't even get them to roll into a ball shape so I just scooped them off the spoon on the pan. While baking they looked good and not thin at all. I thought they might taste freat despite the dough being sticky. I baked for 8 minutes like the other reviews suggested. Cooled for 2 and tasted one. NO FLAVOR. They don't taste bad they just don't taste like anything at all. My search continues....."
"3","1","I can't understand how this recipe is getting so many 5 star reviews. My batch mixed well, which is about the nicest thing I have to say about them. They also baked well and smelled delicious. When I bit into one, at first it was delicious, then all of a sudden there was this bitter aftertaste that lingered. DO NOT make this recipe. You will regret it."
"3","5","My husband and I are huge sugar cookie fans and this year I set our to find the BEST recipe for sugar cookies. I had bookmarked many recipes and this was the second I tried, and I am very happy to say, my search is complete. These are awesome! The dough is easy to use for rolling and cookie cutters. (which I chose to prepare as) They turn golden and perfectly crispy but not hard. Unbelievable. Everyone adored them!"
"3","5","Great! These were easy and very fast to whip up. I chopped some almonds and some lindt truffles to mix into half the batch and they were great!"
"3","4","We enjoyed the chewiness and ease of this recipe."
"3","5","These turned out wonderfully!"
"3","5","Yum- I used 2 eggs and 2 tsp of vanilla... and this batch was enough to fill a 9x13 baking tray (to cut into bars) and make 24 rounded tsp size drop cookies. I rolled all but one cookie in the sugar beforehand, and think that the added sugar make them look much prettier. :)"
"3","5","very easy and delicious! i can make them very fast and without a difficult cleanup, will definately do again!"
"3","5","Great sugar cookie! I added twice the amount of vanilla as was recommended by the recipe, and took another review's advice and let the butter get very soft before starting. The dough was slightly firmer as most people pointed out, but if you roll the dough ball in just enough sugar to coat, then cook for 8 minutes as directed, they come out perfect. Cookies have just the right amount of softness (holds together, because of the sugar outside, but super soft inside). Will definitely make this cookie again!"
"3","5","I thought these were really good. Better than a lot of others i've tried. I didn't have baking soda so I just doubled the baking powder and it worked out fine. I also put cinnamon/sugar on half of them and they were great that way as well."
"3","5","I ran out of white sugar and subsituted 3/4 cup brown for 3/4 white. I needed to cook them for about 12-13 min instead of 8 - 10, but they came out beautifully - very soft and chewy."
"3","4","This is a great recipe though perhaps not the best. I doubled the vanilla in this recipe for a bit more flavor. The recipe says to use teaspoon size balls which made silver dollar sized cookies. While these are good for a quick snack, I wanted something larger. For the second pan I used tablespoon sized balls, flattened with a press which made the perfect size cookie. Bake them for 8 minutes and 8 minutes only no matter how they look as they will continue to cook outside the oven. 8 Minutes and they were perfect and stay soft even when cool."
"3","1","I am dissapointed to see all this work that I had put into attempting to make these sugar cookies only to see that they did not come out very well at all. I was attempting to make these cookies for a party with 30-40 guests all adults. So while adding and mixing the ingredience as the recipe called for I was fine. I understood everything that the recipe had said to do. My problem with these cookies was that first all of the cookies were super thin, then they burnt and finally they were simply just way to big and formed together as one big bunch of cookies which I had never encounted before while baking sugar cookies. I didnt care for this recipe. I will stick with the break and bake cookies next time. Dont waste your time. Maybe someone else will have better luck baking these cookies."
"3","5","I made a batch of these in half an hour... and that included the time it took to get out all the stuff including the mixer! They came out GREAT! Delicious and soft."
"3","5","Excellent and super easy cookie recipe! I just pulled the first batch out of the oven and I love them! I sprinkled each cookie with a bit of raw sugar before baking, but they would be just as wonderful without that addition. I highly recommend this recipe."
"3","5","all the raving reviews are SO TRUE for this recipe!! it is the best dough ever, it just all came together so beautifully and is so amazing to work with. PLUS it's tasty and if you cut back a little on the sugar it's perfect to be frosted or topped with chocolate. the only issue i had was that my cookies rose too much so i had to flatten the second batch before backing and they are never as nice and round. next time i may just omit the baking powder so they don't rise. also, my cookies never crack on top, and i wish i knew why! the cracking is the prettiest thing..."
"3","5","YUMMY! Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Followed suggestions and baked for 8 minutes, came out perfect! Refridgerated for a little bit to make it a little easier to work with. If is was a little to dry I added a splash of milk - JUST a splash. Everyone loves them!"
"3","5","Amazing, easy & delicious..."
"3","5","The Best SUGAR cookies EVER! They have a some what roasted nut taste to them...Its the sugar cookies i have always dreamed of. FANTASTIC, chewy and beautiful. For all of you who really dont like sugar cookies, stop bringing the stars down just because you dont like sugar cookies in general...I have been told so many time they are the absolute best sugar cookie there is, by multiple sugar cookie lovers!"
"3","5","these sugar cookies are great! I'm not sure what the problem is with the recipe! used 1 more tsp. vanilla...just made them Hmmm..."
"3","5","Very good/ Will be our favorite recipe for sugar cookies. A tip for the butter issue. I put mine in the microwave and cooked for 5 - 10 sec at a time until it was very soft. I can't wait for it to get soft on the counter top, so this is another solution."
"3","5","Delicious. Many compliments each time I make them. I use this dough in a cookie press, too soft for cut outs."
"3","4","I had a bit of trouble with this recipe. I'm not blaming the recipe, it's just I'm not a very good cook. Here's my recommendation to anyone who hasn't tried it yet and is planning to: DON'T put the blobs of dough too close together. Otherwise, you'll end up with one GIANT cookie......."
"3","5","My husband asks for these all the time. So simple but so fabulous! One tip... the dough seems to dry out really fast, and the drier the dough, the tougher the cookies are after they're baked. I solved that problem by storing the dough in an airtight container between batches. I take a damp cloth or paper towel and place it on top before I seal it up. Works like a charm."
"3","5","Really good. I changed it a little by putting in 2 teaspoon vanilla, and rolling them in sugar."
"3","4","These were fantastic!!! However I couldn't give it a full 5 stars because I tweeked it a bit. I added a pinch of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg to give more flavor. They turned out similar to a snicker doodle cookie!!! Fabulous!!"
"3","1","So...my best friend and I were making cookies for our boyfriends, who were coming to our condo for dinner. It was my boyfriends big 5-0, and I wanted to start the evening with a bang, so we decided to make some cookies, but we still had to get ready,so we decided to quickly look online to see what we could find. We found this recipe and because of the great reviews we were sure we found a true great recipe...boy were we wrong....  clarisse and carla (age 23, Utica Illinois)"
"3","5","I cooked the tray until it was almost done and then sprinkled a cinnamon and sugar mix on top before finishing it in the oven. Sooooo good!"
"3","5","perfect! delicious! no modifications needed at all! yum!"
"3","5","I was looking for a soft and chewy sugar cookie recipe. These turned out delicious. My search is over..I think I will keep this recipe a secret :-)"
"3","5","This has got to be the easiest sugar cookie recipe. I let the blue bonnet (instead of using butter) soften completely and followed the rest of the directions completely. The dough was kinda crumbly so I thought it wouldnt turn out right but they turned out perfect. I only allowed the cookies to bake for 8 min and when they came out I put chocolate chips and m&m's on the cookie. The kids devored the cookies. This will be my new sugar cookie recipe. The rest of the batch I rolled in sugar before baking."
"3","4","Big hit with my friends. The first time I made them I didn't have enough butter and used another egg to make up for the lost moisture, and they turned out very creamy and soft, absolutely delicious. When I made them again however and followed the recipe exactly they weren't as good, and too buttery, therefore I suggest using less butter and one more egg."
"3","1","When i saw the amazing reviews given to this recipe i thought this was the one to serve for my sons class end of the year party. I had them perfect and decorated and when my son tried one he said 'mom i told you to make me sugarcookies for my class not scrambbled eggs!' These cookies tasted exactly like scrmmbled eggs. Do not make these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly right. Im warning you dont eat them."
"3","5","Perfect sugar cookie!! Very soft and fluffy. Light sugar taste. Quick and easy."
"3","5","These are what the name suggests....easy! The taste is awesome. I added a Tbs of vanilla to the recipe which added to the flavor of these already great cookies. Thanks for the recipe, this is a definate keeper."
"3","5","I tried this today, it was the best sugar cookie ever. I rolled the balls in colored sugar,they were so soft and chewy I will never use another recipe, this is my one and only!"
"3","5","This recipe can also make excellent 'brownie' cookies - just mix in 1/4-1/2 cup (I always cook a half batch, so I use 1/4 cup) of powdered cocoa with the flour mixture, and the same amount of sugar extra. Not so good with peanut butter, but pb chips work. Of course, the original is also just delicious!"
"3","5","I thought these were fantastic. So quick and easy - I started them at 9:00 at night and was done by 10. I got 40 cookies out of this, but I ate some of the dough before it hit the cookie sheet. :) I followed the recipe exactly except that when I measured the vanilla, I did it over the bowl and let it run over the edge of the measuring spoon (I always do this). I use Mexican vanilla for everything because that's what my mom used when I was growing up, and I don't like the other stuff! (You can get it really cheap at Mexgrocer.com) I rolled all of these into about 1 inch balls, then rolled them in sugar. I left 2 doz in ball form and baked that way - the rest I flattened when I put them on the cookie sheet and then baked. The cookies that were baked in a ball shape were thicker with a lighter, softer texture - semi chewy when warm. The flattened ones were much more crisp. I frosted the flattened cookies with cream cheese frosting I had left over after making carrot cake cookie sandwiches last week (from Martha Stewart's site). The cookies were great with the icing, too! This will be my go-to sugar cookie recipe. I love the flavor and I always have the ingredients for this. Thanks so much for sharing!"
"3","5","I was looking for a sugar cookie that was very easy to make and these are true to their name! I was going to frost these cookies, but they were so delicious without, very chewy in the middle with light and crispy edges. I like a big, flat cookie, so I reduced the flour. Also, as other reviewers suggested, I increased the vanilla, the butter, the sugar and added cinnamon. These do spread out quite a bit while baking, but I rolled my dough to about an inch diameter and placed them very far apart on the cookie sheet. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar. Cook 8 minutes."
"3","5","The cookies taste just like the ones you buy at the grocery store! In fact by making them using the Pampered Chef medium scoop everyone thought I had bought them because they were all exactly the same size! This cuts out on the rolling by hand too! Perfect balls are placed on the pan for you! I have already made these twice in the last month, they will sure stay on the top of my recipe pile!"
"3","5","Taking some advice from other reviewers, I added in a little extra vanilla, as well as some cinnamon and allspice. Yummy yummy yummy. I did chill the dough (since I was using cookie cutters) and kneaded it a few times to warm it up before rolling it out...and the cookies came out perfect! 6.5 to 7 minutes was the right amount of time for me. My daughter and I will be making these again!"
"3","4","the recipe needs more time too cook about 12 min. It also need about 1/4 a cup of water to make it less crumbly"
"3","5","I have to say, these cookies are AWESOME!!! and they were SUPER EASY!! Now, for a 19 year old straight male who NEVER bakes, to make these cookies and for them to come out the way they did.. this recipe HAS TO BE idiot proof. I followed every direction to the T!! I even put them on the wire rack and everything. And they turned out amazing!!! Slightly crispy on the outside, and PERFECTLY soft on the inside.  The only thing I noticed was that the recipe said it would make 4 DOZEN cookies... mine only made about 22 cookies. Okay, well mine were rather large... But delicious none the less! I would recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone!!"
"3","3","These taste great but don't come out looking very pretty. My trees look like giant blobs and my ginger bread men have no visible limbs. They get really big in the oven. Even after refrig. for a while they still did it. If you just want a good tasting sugar cookie then they are fine. But if you are going for visual appeal I wouldn't make them."
"3","1","Wow, I can't believe how well-rated these are. I've made these twice, following the recipe to the letter both times, and had to throw them all away. After 8 minutes at 375 they are completely flat and burnt. I tried to salvage the last bit of dough by cooking it for 7 1/2 minutes at 300 degrees, and they turned out perfectly. I WILL NOT use this recipe again."
"3","5","Very very easy (and good) recipe. My boyfriend and I were sitting here craving cookies or sweets- but we have nothing in the house. I had been browsing this site all day and thought to myself 'I can just make these cookies.' I had all the ingredients, and literally got off my couch at 8pm and I'm sitting back down on the couch at 8:50 after baking 2 sheets of cookies. I added jam to the middle of half the batch for an added touch. Very easy and yummy!"
"3","1","There must be a typo on the web site. There is too much flour, not enough butter,etc....they were dry and crumbly. couldn't roll them. Whatever shape I made them, they stayed. They didn't spread out. Very disappointed."
"3","5","I have to say I get nothing but rave reviews from family coworkers and friends. I've made these 6 times in the last 2 weeks because people keep asking for them. Now I just forward the link to this page! My only variation is baking at 380 degrees and I average 9 minutes per batch."
"3","5","We like these cookies very much. They did get very thin, but still tasted perfect. I used half butter and half margerine, because that's all I had, and doubled the vanilla. I baked them for 8 minutes and they turned out soft and chewy."
"3","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. Every time I make these cookies, people go on and on about how they are the best they have had. As others have said, take the cookies out at 8 minutes. They will look like they need longer, but trust me.... they will turn out perfectly!"
"3","5","These are SOOOOO good! however i thought that they needed more than one teaspoon of vanilla extract; i read the reviews before i made the recipe and added about two teaspoons instead of one. I made sure not to over-bake the cookies, and they are so nice and soft :-) this recipe will become my go-to sugar cookie recipe for every event! mmm!"
"3","5","This is now my T-N-T sugar cookie recipe! Very buttery, almost like scottish shortbread. My only change from the original recipe is the addition of 1/4-1/2 tsp salt. I added a thin layer of white frosting and some sprinkles. May try tinting frosting for holidays."
"3","5","Super easy and taste incredible!!"
"3","5","These ARE easy and soft! I split the amount of vanilla between vanilla and almond extract and my husband, who doesn't like sugar cookies, loves them!"
"3","5","I've made these twice. Both times they've turned out great. My husband even said, 'Mmmm, Cole, these are even better than last time!' I follow the recipe as is + 1/4tsp salt."
"3","1","I thought they were gross none of my three kids had more than one"
"3","5","WOW! GREAT COOKIES. I ADDED A 1/4 TEASPOON OF CINNAMON AND SUGAR TO THE TOP OF EACH COOKIE FOR A SLIGHT TWIST. QUICKEST BATCH OF COOKIES I HAVE EVER MADE. FROM STAR TO FINSH OF FIRST BATCH ONLY 15 MIN. WILL KEEP THIS RECIPE FOR SANTA!"
"3","5","This is a great recipe for beginning bakers :) It's easy and doesn't require ingrediants that you'll need to run out to the store for! Everyone loved these cookies! I actually roll the dough balls in a cinnamon sugar mixture before I bake them, which gives them a snicker-doodley taste :) These cookies came out soft and delicious for me! I often only bake half of the dough and freeze the rest for later! Great time saving idea when you're craving some home baked goodness! :D"
"3","3","These cookies were too plain tasting and plain looking. They really could have used some extra flavor. They were, however, easy to make. I made 150 for my swim team on national Sugar Cookie Day (yes, it actually is a real holiday). It only took me about an hour. My team members enjoyed them, but they were no better than generic super market sugar cookies."
"3","5","Deeelicious and crunchy! My sister and I made them and fell in love."
"3","5","These cookies tasted great. When baking, make sure to use an actual cup of butter, instead of 1/4 a cup. This will make the cookies bake like cookies, instead of cookie crumbs."
"3","4","These cookies spread a lot! I put 9 on a 9X13 inch pan and they spread out and were touching each other! I didn't really like the taste (they tasted really 'eggy', like there were about 5 eggs in them) but hubby enjoyed them so I'm giving 4 out of 5."
"3","4","The texture is great, and the dough is quick to make and easy to work with. However, I felt like the flavor was really lacking. I ended up adding a thin sugar glaze and sprinkling coarse sugar on top. I think they'd be great if you intend to add icing or frosting of some sort."
"3","5","I made these cookies and everyone loved them they so so creamy and tasty. Thanks for puting up this recipe."
"3","4","I loved making these!  I however think the dough could use a little more butter/oil/liquid than the recepie states to make the dough easier to handle. I substituted the butter with canola oil to curb down the saturated fat yeild. This turned out very well, 'cept for the slight rapeseed aftertaste. I think other such vegetable oils would work well with this, too!"
"3","3","i followed the instructions exactly, but my dough was way too dry and wouldn't stick together well. Also, the cookies came out too hard. the first batch i made the teaspoon sized balls, but they certainly didn't flatten and were hard and bland. the second batch i flattened them with the bottom of a cup dipped in sugar and those came out much, much better."
"3","5","Great recipe! I actually added a bit more flour so I could roll them out an used almond extract instead of vanilla for a different flavor...good stuff! ~sjt"
"3","4","I sprinkled ground cinnamon on top of one of the batches and THOSE cookies turned out delicious and MUCH better than the rest, which were kind of bland.  Also, for all the cookies, I added extra vanilla and used margarine instead of butter, which made mixing by hand very easy."
"3","5","Simple and delicious. The center stays a little chewy, which we love! I rolled the balls in festive sprinkles and the cookies came out gorgeous!"
"3","2","I don't know what I did wrong, but when I mixed the dry ingredients into the wet, the dough just turned into a big crumbly mess. When I tried rolling the dought into a cookie to try and bake, the cookie turned out fairly good, but too crumbly."
"3","4","These were great. I had to make something for a very last minute cookie exchange. I normally make cut-out sugar cookies for parties but I knew I wouldn't have time. These were so easy to make and tasted wonderful. Everyone at the party asked for the recipe. Thank you."
"3","4","These cookies turned out great. I learnt that they did have to be chilled before working with the dough. I saved half the dough and froze it. I made them a week later and they turned out just as good. I added some m&ms to the cookies, it looked very cute."
"3","1","Decent recipie..dough was dry and the cookies were somewhat bland and almost sour..i think there is too much baking soda in it...i wouldn't make them again..ever."
"3","5","YUM! I used a medium sized cookie scoop instead of rolling the balls. They turned out great! I frosted them with the 'butter icing for cookies' recipe found on allrecipes. By far the easiest sugar cookie recipe ever!"
"3","5","i love this recipe! i was looking for a recipe for my boyfriend who's in the airforce to send him and his friends cookies, the recipe was SO easy (and was so much better than the betty crocker stuff i had been using previous to finding this recipe) and everyone who ever has them absolutely LOVES them and either asks for more or the recipe! to make perfect little cookies (when i'm not rolling them out and using a cookie cutter)i actually use a teaspoon or tablespoon measurer (depending on what size i want the cookies). usually i'll then dip the tops of the cookies in sprinkes or if you get colored sugar it makes them look like professional cookies (and many times people don't believe that i baked them and didn't buy them from a store!) this recipe is by far the best sugar cookie recipe i've ever found"
"3","5","These are great and easy to modify for whatever you need! I rolled mine in a cinnomon and sugar mix for a little something...really good while they're still warm!"
"3","5","Mmmm! The only bad thing I have to say about these cookies is that they're so easy to make, I've made them three times this week and that is NOT good. SO SO SO SO GOOD! And EASY!!"
"3","5","I have tried some really bad sugar cookie recipes....THIS ONE IS AWESOME!!! Soft just like I like I like em. The taste was great! Made 5 dozen for the Fall festival at the girls school. They where a huge hit! Thanks for sharing."
"3","5","this dough is grainy but the cookie when baked is moist chewy and great."
"3","5","I am the daughter of this all recipes account owner, me and my brother just made these divine cookies! They really are super good they taste just like sugar cookies (go figure) They were super simple and the ingredients are so few you most likely will not have to make a run to walmart for some crazy ingredient. We did add the extra egg and seeing as we are 16 and 11 year old chefs we spiced them up a bit by doing some cinnamon sugar, sugar, chocolate chip, or simply plain! It made it really fun getting creative with the simple toppings! They are declicious and we will keep this recipe handy! (extra egg really helped!)"
"3","5","Very easy and delicious. Works best if you knead the dough with your hands rather than mix with a spoon. Next time I'll probably roll in cinnamon sugar before baking. Very good!"
"3","5","Warning! This cookie dough is so addictive it should be illegal. With so few ingredients I thought the cookies might be bland but they were fantastic. They were perfect for the children's weekly cookie cravings. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's going in my 'favorite' pile."
"3","5","These were, surprisingly, really good. I am not a sugar cookie fan as I find them just too bland. But these were delicious. I frosted them with pink icing for Valentine's Day and they were delicious."
"3","4","I can't give it 5 stars even though I messed it up - I realize why a couple of reviewers thought these were too crunchy - the butter... I used A STICK because it is 8 ounces... meaning one cup ... WRONG - 2 sticks of butter equal a cup (for those of you who are teh occasional baker as I am..) However; this was a good flavor and my husband and I had a great laugh, my 3 year old got bored because we couldn't get the consistency right... thanks for the recipe...."
"3","5","These cookies are the best sugar cookies I've EVER made! They came out grrrreat and were super tasty!!!!! 10 THUMBS UP...LOL!"
"3","1","I tried these last night, and they sucked. Tottaly crumbly and it really didn't turn out. I will try my aunt's recipe for sugar cookies."
"3","5","These were very easy to make and very tasty! I used them to make cutout cookies, and shortened the baking time to about 6-7 min."
"3","5","These are a great simple cookie. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, used real butter and added 1/4 c sugar. I rolled thm into balls and flattened slightly and sprinkled with colored sugars. I baked them only 8 minutes and let them cool on the pan for 2 minutes befor moving to a rack. These are yummy crispy outside tender inside wonderful cookies. Thanks for sharing."
"3","5","The cookies were delicious...after I added a whole lot of water to the dough. It was unbelievably dry before that. My 4-year-old loved these cookies. Not too sweet, either."
"3","5","Simple, not too sweet, moist in the middle, crunchy around the edges! The only suggestion I would add is to keep the dough in the freezer between batches as it is a bit sticky."
"3","5","YUM! I just made these with my son and they turned out great. I rolled them into balls and dipped in cinnamon/sugar. Then had my son press with a fork and they came out of the oven soft and delicious. I cooked them for 8 minutes so they stay chewy, if you like crispy cookies, you could go for the whole 10 min."
"3","5","Very easy recipe and the cookies turned out great! It will definitely become one of my favorites. If the dough seems too soft to roll into balls, make sure you refrigerate the dough until it is firm."
"3","5","SOOOOOOOO easy - so good...me and my 3 year old made these and used 10 different kinds of sprinkles to decorate...easy - had everything in the cabinet - and will totally make again!"
"3","5","This recipe turned out great! My boyfriend loved them and so did his mom! Crisy edges and chewy center. Highly reccomend. Great for Christmas and Thanksgiving! I flatten them out criss-cross with a fork and sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on top. Yum!!!"
"3","4","An excellent sugar cookie recipe. Easy, too! Will take them out of the oven a few minutes sooner next time in hopes that they will be softer. I have an old fashioned oven from about 1950 or so, so this may be why they got a bit crispy. They also look nice. Put a few candy sprinkles on each one before baking. Thanks You."
"3","5","I generally don't change a recipe the first time I try it, but I did with this one. I wanted to double the batch and only had one cup of butter. I used a cup of butter and a cup of shortening....came out wonderful! This is a good basic recipe for sugar cookies. Simple to make and I had most of the ingredients on hand. I'll be making this one again."
"3","5","So far, this is the very best sugar cookie recipe I have found. They turned out perfectly. I did add just a touch of lemon extract along with the vanilla, and I rolled the balls in sugar before baking. Gorgeous and delicious. Thanks, Stephanie."
"3","5","I was looking for a simple sugar cookie recipe to make with my kids, but I also wanted it to taste good. I tried a couple other recipes off of this site and not happy with how easy or how they tasted,we went back to looking and found this one. I have to say that this one was AWESOME!!! It was easy to make with the kids and we ate all of them in one night, and the kids want to make more....lol This recipe is a keeper and is now on our holiday cookie list."
"3","5","Very good. These were chewy and tasty. I have tried others and found them tastless and hard...almost dry. Will definately make again !"
"3","5","Excellent cookie recipe. The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white since I was running low. They were great right out of the oven and had a beautiful golden tan color. The brown sugar gave them a very nice flavor. I would definitely recommened this one. Thanks a bunch."
"3","5","Very buttery and great texture. Everyone loved them and they couldn't have been easier."
"3","5","Yum! This is a great recipe. I baked them with my kids - it's so easy!The dough was too soft to make balls, so we dropped spoonfulls dipped in cinnamon sugar. I chilled half the dough so we can have fresh cookies for tomorrow too! This is a holiday gem! Great for school bake sales, too!"
"3","5","Wonderful Cookie! I doubled the recipe with no problems at all - good thing too because they disappeared!! I chose these for a holiday cookie exchange so I rolled the balls in red and green sugar before baking. They were beautiful as well as delicious!"
"3","5","very good and very easy. I rolled mine in multicolor nonpareils before baking, and they came out looking like colorful Christmas ornaments. Thanks a lot for this recipe!"
"3","5","I made these cookies last Christmas. I could not keep my nieces and nephews out of them. I even added cinnamon. As soon as they were removed from the oven, they were gone.  Happy eating."
"3","5","This was wonderful! The whole family loved these cookies! :) Thankyou so much! As novice bakers, we didn't know much but now we have a household favorite! :) THANKYOU!"
"3","5","Great cookie! My kids added M & M's to the tops and they turned out wonderful. The kids couldn't get enough."
"3","5","These were absolutely divine! I took another reviewer's suggestion and rolled the sugar cookie balls thoroughly in sugar....and WOW, what a treat! Even tried cinnamon sugar some of them. Will make again & again & again."
"3","5","Great recipe. Easy to make and great flavor. I'm not used to making sugar cookies with a rising agent, so when I used the dough for cut-out cookies, I found that, when baked, the cookies puffed up. The cookies that were cut with an intricate cookie cutter didn't resemble the original shape....but the kids didn't care! If you're using cookie cutters, use basic designs like a Christmas tree or a pumpkin."
"3","5","This recipe reminds me of the bakery sugar cookies I used to eat as a child. Good job Stephanie!!"
"3","5","These were so easy to make. They weren't sticky and were easy to roll out for cookie cutters."
"3","3","This was a quick and easy recipe. My family enjoyed them very much. For those cookies that lasted more than the first few days, they became a little too 'hard' for my liking. Smaller batch next time."
"3","5","Still soft and chewy the next day! Sweet enough with out frosting! Has to be the best sugar cookies I have had."
"2","5","Great recipe, fluffy and crisp. I added the juice and zest of 2 lemons to give them a bit of a kick and they were fabulous."
"2","5","This recipe was great. It was a huge hit with my friends and family. Very easy to make. I cut the amount of baking soda in half and I didn't let the cookies harden in the oven. They hardened when I took them out and they stayed soft and chewy into the next day."
"2","4","great recipe...I added a dash of salt and a little nutmeg to the batter for a little more flavor..."
"2","2","Maybe just me, but the cookie batter for this recipe came out dry and crumbly. I saved it by adding a bit of oil to the dough in order to get it to form balls. It was okay as a quick one time recipe. I've baked a lot of sugar cookies though and I would not recommend this one as a first choice. Sorry. :-("
"2","5","Look no further for a Sugar Cookie Recipe! You have found the best. Chewy, buttery, sugary...It's all that you want in a sugar cookie. I am a Recreation Director, and I made a batch of these cookies with my seniors. When we tried one, we all became very quiet and only Mmmmmm was heard. Note: mixture is quite crumbly. Don't worry. The heat from your hand when you form the cookie balls will melt the butter and make it stick together. Super delicious...honestly!!!!!"
"2","1","They taste absolutely horrible!!!!!"
"2","5","This recipe was EXACTLY what I was looking for! I was highly disappointed in some other 'high-rated' or overly complex recipes. A simple sugar cookie is best, especially with good flavor & dough easy to work with for cutting shapes. My cousin is autistic, and I chose this recipe due to the simplicity. He had a total BLAST making these! The dough was a great consistency to easily cut shapes. I only recommend rolling the dough to about 1/4-1/2 inch thick & only baking until slightly golden-brown so they will still come out somewhat soft instead of crunchy.   These were easy to make, they were easy to roll & cut shapes, and most important- they turned out looking very nice for decorating & also tasted great! This one is a keeper for me, and my cousin who loves to bake. I suggest anyone who is looking for a simple & great tasting/decorating cookie try this recipe out- especially if you have younger or a special-needs child who is eager to impress others with a fantastic cookie! :)"
"2","5","Never tried before but they awesome! However, I replaced the vanilla extract with almond extract."
"2","4","My family loved them. They were cake like cookies. I'm definitely doing these again."
"2","5","This is a quick, easy recipe perfect for drop sugar cookies! I made the recipe according to the directions but added my own icing recipe. To make the icing:"
"2","5","This recipe was so easy and tastes so good. I made sure my butter was so soft it was almost liquid but I did not melt it . Since I live in a cold place I put my butter in a plastic bag and warmed it with my hands, it worked really well. I recomend this recipe."
"2","5","Super easy, and so yummy!!!"
"2","5","What a simple and tasty recipe."
"2","5","Liked it, very easy to make"
"2","5","This recipe makes delicious cookies!  Used this recipe as the basis for a last minute Hallowe'en treat. I replaced half of the butter with roasted pumpkin flesh that had been through a food processor, and 1/2 a cup of the white sugar with soft brown sugar; added a dash of ground cinnamon and ground cardamom.  Everyone loves them!"
"2","5","These were delicious! I substituted the shortening for butter and added and extra tsp of vanilla. They were crispy, yet buttery and chewy in the middle. You must try!"
"2","5","This recipe is easy and fabulous! Made batch with no problems the first time. The cookies are crispy and chewy just a great balance! I added about a half tsp more of vanilla and a pinch of salt for flavor enhancement! Highly recommend!"
"2","5","This is my 'go to' sugar cookie recipe! As I have seen mentioned, I use very soft butter, use only a 1/2 of teaspoon, and only bake 8 minutes. Every stove and texture like- is different. You just have to find yours. I usually have dough left over, so I refrigerate the rest, and those seem even better! If I could, You would have a ten rate from me."
"2","5","These cookies are delicious and super easy. When I made them, I divided the recipe by 4 (since 4 dozen cookies is a lot of cookies) except I added half an egg instead of a quarter. Also, I used almond extract instead of vanilla because I live in Germany and Germans don't use vanilla very often. Even with dividing the recipe by 4, I got 21 decent sized cookies. I live with very picky host-siblings and they even liked them!"
"2","5","I wish I could give this recipe 500000 stars!! its outstanding! the best sugar cookie recipe ever! if you haven't tried it yet,you should!!! absolutely awesome!!!!!"
"2","4","I have made this recipe several times and every time I made the cookies, the dough was soft but the cookies still came out hard but i still loved them.  However last time I baked them I was in a rush so I had to melt the butter to get done faster and instead of a mixer or stirring with a wooden spoon or something I whisked the sugar and butter together then added all the ingredients in one at a time also whisking them in until it got thick then i used a wooden spoon to finish stirring.  But after I baked them my cookies came out really soft and fluffy!"
"2","5","Made these for my wife who loves sugar cookies, she raved about how great they were."
"2","1","This recipe tastes great, however the cookies stick and are super thin. I even tried using spray oil. This tastes great as a batter and a cookie if you dont look at it. But they are definitely ugly, stick to the cookie sheet, thin cookies."
"2","4","It was a great recipe! However, I would add some extra milk and vanilla and put a little less sugar. The cookies harden too fast otherwise. The are delicious warm and with tea."
"2","5","best sugar cookies ever"
"2","5","Great recipe! Easy to make and kids love helping!"
"2","5","This was a classic, simple recipe. My cookies turned out to be puffier than those pictured, but they tasted delicious and were very pretty."
"2","5","I reduce the temperature to 350 because I am baking in a convection oven and 9 minutes is perfect. I add 1/4 t almond extract and sometimes substitute lemon extract for the vanilla. This is a perfect cookie the way it is written, but also to play with."
"2","5","I LOVED it. It's the best sugar cookie recipe ever. I just recommend letting the butter sit out on the counter until it's room temperature. But if you're in a hurry, microwave it for 10-1"
"2","3","This recipe calls for too much flour. We have attempted this 3 times now and I finally got smart enough to cut the flour. I am a seasoned cook/baker (I was most definitely measuring correctly). If you use 2 3/4 cups of flour, you will end up with a very crumbly dough. I reduced it to 2 1/2 with much better results. It was still crumbly but I kept mixing and it FINALLY came together. Next time I will drop it to 2 1/4 c. If I were to rate this after cutting the flour, I would give the recipe 5 stars. However, as written, it only gets 3 from me. Before, it was a dry cookie. This last time, they much more moist and chewy. My advice is to add the flour slowly when you make this. See what works for you."
"2","5","These were great! My cookies looked exactly like the cookies in the picture and tasted delicious and this recipe does make a lot of cookies, around 50!"
"2","4","A great basic sugar cookie recipe, like others mentioned, I doubled the vanilla to give it a more rounded out flavor. I also added a pinch of salt to the batch and felt this balanced the sweetness, also rolling the balls into sugar and gently pressing down with a fork. My cookies came out chewy and perfect looking and so yummy. Oh another thing is I did half melted butter and half shortening. Amazing sugar cookies!"
"2","4","Good recipe! A simple, good-tasting cookie that will warm your mouth on a cold winter, and refresh you on a hot summer day. All in all, I recommend this recipe for those looking for a quick recipe but a good cookie."
"2","5","These turned out so good and they stayed soft for a couple of days. Excellent with cream cheese on them."
"2","4","I am not sure what I did wrong, however I was unable to roll my cookies. They were very sticky and I had to plop them on the pan, lol. They are tasty though, a hit with the kids!"
"2","2","I don't know what went wrong. I followed the recipe to a T. I even followed the reviews about how soft the butter should be. These have been in the oven for 20 min and are still dough."
"2","1","It turned out all crumbly and wouldn't hold together. Way too dry to form any type of ball or flatten out."
"2","5","I made two batches of this recipe and I've noticed something that correlates with the negative comments that's easily fixed. I baked the first batch to the recommended time until the bottoms were brown and they were a little more solid. The second I baked less, the bottoms weren't even browned and when I first tried to take them off the pan they were too soft so I left them on there until they cooled down and I could take them off. The first were cooked all the way through and became very hard after a day, but the second stayed chewy much longer."
"2","4","Easiest recipe for sugar cookies made a nice bit of them."
"2","5","My family and I made this recipe on a vacation. The cookies turned out delicious! However, to make these a little healthier, we substituted some of the butter with milk. The butter does have to be completely softened, however! Also, add a little extra vanilla to add more flavor... yum!"
"2","5","This cookie turned out yummy, they really are mouth watering. Easy to make, I did substitute baking soda (didn't have any) and just added more baking powder. I also added 1/4 tsp salt since I used un salted butter. I wasn't sure if I would ice them but after tasting one I decided that iceing was not needed."
"2","5","I love this recipe. So simple and delicious! I will often sprinkle in some cinnamon though and use coconut oil (same amount) in lieu of butter. It makes for a subtle coconut flavor with a slight zing from the cinnamon."
"2","5","This is a great recipe! My family and I really liked it. The cookies were really soft, even after the cooled. The first time I made these wasn't all that good though; because I rolled them out instead of making them into balls. The balls were MUCH MUCH better. They were awesome."
"2","5","awesome~! can I cut with cooky cutters?? my siblings love that!"
"2","5","This has been the best homemade sugar cookie recipe I have ever used. I rolled some of the dough into sugar which gave it a sweeter taste. Also I rolled the rest of the dough into sugar and cinnamon which made a snicker doodle cookie. Perfect for parties or just if you are craving a sugar cookie."
"2","4","This recipe really worked for me. I ended up using half a cup of butter and half a cup of margarine so that may have helped with the crumbling. My only issue is that they didn't really expand. I ended up flattening them after putting them on the cookie sheet. I also rolled them in cinnamon sugar which made them taste really good."
"2","4","This recipe was good with a few minor alterations. Here is what I did.  I did not have soft butter already, so I just microwaved it for 30 seconds. Some say not to do this...I did, it worked.  I increased the vanilla from 1 t. to 1 T. and added 1/2 t. nutmeg.   Next I reduced the oven temp. to 350 and baked them for about 10-12 minutes. They were good and chewy, I think I would like to try them at the 12 minutes for a more done cookie. It all depends on the desire of the person making, how chewy or crunchy they want them.   Then, when they come out of the oven....right away, drop the pan on a hard surface from about two inches high. For some reason, this action 'breaks them' slightly, and causes them to be chewy and moist. I do this for every batch of cookies I make, and have never had bad ones.   I also rolled the dough in sugar before baking, like another comment-er mentioned. This was a good addition.   Next time I plan on trying chocolate chips in them.   I would recommend this recipe to everyone! It was good, not to sweet. They were gone in two days!"
"2","1","they turned out super flat wouldnt even come off the pan. tasted like flour and baking soda.i will never make these cookies again!!!"
"2","5","These are awesome cookies... Don't over bake :-)"
"2","1","it was had and crumbly I added milk it came out frine but it is missing something to make them taste and look like cookies"
"2","4","This was a great recipe we found that when we started mixing it was dry so we added another egg and two teaspoons of water it helped lots other then that it was spectacular -Baking4ever"
"2","5","The best cookies on earth!!!! Easy as all get out and tasty too!, Thank you for posting this easy recipe. My son loved them."
"2","5","I tried this recipe at home for a small party and they were great i love making these and there easy to make even for a 14 yer,ar old like me"
"2","5","Wow really easy and tasty. I needed some sugar cookies quick and picked these. They tasted great and stayed soft for quite a while."
"2","5","Made using gluten-free flour (Domata) and they turned out great!"
"2","5","Very easy and very good, the kids loved them and enjoyed decorating them. I cooked them for 8 minutes and they were perfect, a little crunch on the outside and soft and moist in the middle."
"2","5","So far so good. I added cinnamon and white chocolate chips. Yummy :D"
"2","5","Just Wow! I can't give this recipe enough starts. I followed the recipe as is with no modifications and they came out perfectly. I gave it a try based on reviews and I'm so glad I did. Give it try, you won't be sorry. They are perfectly crisp on the outside without being hard, and soft and chewy in the middle. Enjoy!"
"2","5","Yes I did and it was sooo delicious I don't know if you guys can't cook or what but mine came out perfectly soft and buttery all it takes is the right measurements and your imagination! ???? keel trying there worth the try -Jordan"
"2","5","these were amazing and really easy to make. Just make sure the butter is mostly soft when using. Also don't remove the cookies until they have cooled."
"2","5","I loved this recipe. I've been trying to find a good, soft sugar cookie. These are it! As other reviewers say, the key is to have the butter EXTREMELY softened (no, not melted). I let my butter cubes sit out for at least an hour to soften. My daughter loved these. We made some for her play and added food coloring. They also taste great with butterscotch chips in them. I also added more vanilla (note I use pure vanilla not imitation)."
"2","5","Best sugar cookies ever. Fast easy simple and yummy. Been using this recipe for years and its never dissappointed me. Its my go to recipe whenever I want to bake cookies. To anyone reading the reviews try this recipe you will not be dissappointed."
"2","1","The dough was difficultl to work with and the cookies tasted too much like flour."
"2","5","Tried and true recipe. I love eating these plain or even decorated. I have used this recipe for the base on no bake cheesecakes and also various tarts. So versatile and easy! Love that they always turn out moist. They don't get dried out and crunchy like many rolled sugar cookies."
"2","5","Easy and yummy"
"2","5","Great tasting cookie. Didn't even have to roll in balls, just used cookie scoop, parchment paper and baked for 10 minutes. Perfect cookies."
"2","5","Super easy"
"2","4","These cookies are amazing. Just a few things I would change. I would add 2 cups of sugar, and 3/4 cups of butter. They taste way too buttery to me and not very sugary. Other than that, they were perfect!"
"2","5","This was by FAR the easiest sugar cookie recipe I've ever used. No chilling the dough (to be fair though, it was 73degrees and low humidity here in FL today). I used butter (would NEVER use margarine). It sat on the counter for 4 hours prior and wasn't complete mush, but was very soft. The only thing I added was a 1/4t of almond extract. Followed the other instructions exactly. They are crispy on the edges, soft in the middle, very yummy. Kids just grabbed the entire first batch and ate all of them."
"2","4","good recipe, was hoping for a thicker cookie, but these were good, just a bit thinner than I wanted, thank you for your recipe"
"2","4","If you 'melt' the butter (not just soften) you can cut into shapes (suggest a thicker cookie if shaping) agree that adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla makes a difference. Love this recipe, so easy and as others mentioned no cooling period."
"2","5","I was skeptical. I had never made cookies out of such crumbly dough before, but I gave it a shot. This recipe appealed to me because i wouldn't have to cut out cookies.(i hate that about sugar cookies). I needed a larger flatter cookie for decorating so i rolled large balls and then slightly flattened them. They came out large and relatively flat with just enough chew to them. A definite keeper for the recipe box. Have a mentioned how much i hate rolling out cookies? Try it. The dough may seem off, but its moldable like playdough. You won't be disappointed."
"2","1","Wow. This is the first time this website has led me wrong! These cookies are simply not good. I was hoping to decorate and use these for holiday teacher gifts but would be completely embarrassed to serve these. I read all the reviews about the soft butter, extract, etc. and followed the recipe exactly. The batter is so crumbly, sadly it's not even usable."
"2","5","The perfect cookie for me. So easy. Made half a batch. It made 20 cookies. Used a whole egg. Baked for 8 minutes. Chewy delicious!"
"2","5","Really nice, I liked how it was chewey"
"2","5","Its a great recipe . i tried this tonight but added a bar of cream cheese in it. they tasted like the sugar cookies from Great American Cookies !! My hubby loves them"
"2","4","I am going to use this recipe as the crust for Orange-Walnut Tassies. T do believe it will taste awesome!"
"2","5","Delicious buttery goodness loaded with just the right amount of sugar. Can't wait to find a frosting for these lil flat nuggets.   *** Sugar and no spice, still very nice, and plenty of fat for taste. I'd say waste no time and bake these quick, and chill the milk for old St Nick!"
"2","4","Turned out very nice. I added a 1/4tsp of salt with the dry ingredients. after mixing I rolled into a log shape in plastic wrap and refrigerated the dough for an hour, then sliced the cookies from the log then pressed the top of the slice in sugar before baking."
"2","5","Best easiest sugar cookie recipe. I modified it a bit by adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla, cooking time was 10 min in oven and these cookies came out perfect."
"2","5","These were AWESOME! I love to bake and I try different recipes at least once a week. My two granddaughters loves to bake with me. They missed this baking session, only because. I made these cookies for a pot luck at the last minute. I wanted something quick but good. I read a few other reviews, however these should be rated a 5star recipe. I will make again. Thanks for this recipe."
"2","5","This recipe is the best:-):-):-) I am a kid and I love cooking:-):-):-) When my mom makes sugar cookies she said that they never taste that good and when I made these for her she said that they are awesome:-):-):-)"
"2","3","This recipe was pretty good. My cookies were hard by the time they cooled but my children didn't mind one bit. They said the cookies tasted store bought (with the exception of how hard they were of course). I'll try letting the butter soften completely next time. They're worth another shot."
"2","1","Bland and boring. Not a keeper. Kids had fun decorating them, but not eating them. Should have read the reviews first."
"2","5","Made just as the recipe was written...they were perfect! Exactly what I was looking for...I didn't want a sugar cookie that I had to roll and cut out, just scoop and drop. I did use buttercream icing on the top for the cookies I was making, but I'll definitely use this recipe next time I want just plain old fashioned sugar cookies that are rolled in regular or colored sugar! It's a keeper!"
"2","5","This recipe is GREAT!!!!! I tried it with 1/4 cup of vegetable oil because I didn't have eggs, and the recipe still worked really well."
"2","5","These cookies were swagalicious."
"2","5","My children LOVE these cookies! We make them all the time! They are so easy & always come out perfect! They like lots of sprinkles...as you can see by the photo I submitted!"
"2","5","Great recipe ! It was a bit on the dry side, I did not want to fight the dough so I simply added an extra egg and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Did not need to do anything else. I also pushed M & M's onto the cookies right after they came out of the oven. By waiting until they are finished baking the dye from the candy will not smear on the cookie.It also keeps the candy from bursting in the oven while baking. This is only necessary if you want a visually pretty cookie"
"2","2","For some reason when I made this recipe they turned out like cake cookies. The dough wasn't dry and crumbly like other users have said, rather it was pretty moist and malleable. I've made this recipe 2-3 times and I always have this problem, I'm not sure why."
"2","1","The cookies were easy to make, but the taste turned out bland. It was hard, and you had to eat a few before the taste seemed right. They stored well, I must admit."
"2","5","Yummmy! Oh my golly, these were so good! I read a couple reviews before baking and took a few notes.... so 1. I made sure my butter was super SOFT 2.Added an extra dash of vanilla 3. I took out the cookies at exactly 8 minutes. They cookies spread a little more than I anticipated, so the edges stuck together on a few (not a huge issue), these cookies were super soft (I like mine really soft... these weren't even golden brown when I took them out), moist and delicious! Easy recipe, great results!"
"2","5","Great recipe! I didnt change a thing. Will add smarties or chocolate chips next time. Recommended for a nice sugar cookie."
"2","4","These cookies were very good, I give them 4/5 which would be 8/10 because 10/10 would blow me away, and I would be able to make a living selling them if they were that good."
"2","4","I tried this even though there were several comments about hard cookies. I tried a couple of things to make them less crunchy - making sure that the butter was room temperature, I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla & a few teaspoons of milk after it was all mixed together because it was so dry. This is super easy and tasty! I cut up fruit jelly candy mixed the pieces into the cookie dough they came out soft. This adds some extra flavor - orange, lime or cherry, to the cookies. They were a HUGE hit! I also sprinkled some cinammon sugar over the top of some - Snickerdoodles, this recipe is a great base recipe for so much more. Glad to find it!!"
"2","5","Excellent & Very easy. Added extra egg because batter was too dry."
"2","4","I tried this recipe and the cookies a really good. I did change three things however: I added one more egg (because the batter was too crumbly to roll), used margarine instead of butter and also supplemented half the margarine with shortening (1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup shortening) to make the cookies chewier"
"2","5","I've made this recipe dozens of times before. Every single time they're amazing! Easy to make, and easy to add flavors- though they're good by themselves too. I've put lemon zest in a batch, and I must say- the dough is ADDICTING! Absolutely in love with this recipe, a monthly tradition! I reccomend this to all bakers who want an easy recipe with wonderful taste!"
"2","5","These cookies are hot out of the oven and this is my first review. I followed this recipe's ingredients to the letter. I did, however, roll the dough into balls and toss them lightly with sugar. No need to flatten them. They came out perfectly; a little crunch on the edges and softer in the middle. Definitely a keeper."
"2","4","Great to use on dessert pizza. Love it."
"2","5","Watch carefully while baking. Even one minute too long makes them too brown and too crunchy."
"2","5","This was a great recipe, it was extremely simple and you have to be a very challenged baker to not be able to understand. The cookies were wonderful but you should space them 2 inches apart they like to spread out."
"2","5","Never made homemade sugar cookies before. I have always used store made brands. I followed the recipe. Added extra teaspoon of vanilla as recommended by other reviewers. Rolled dough into teaspoon balls and then rolled it in colored sugar mixed with fine sugar granules. They were awesome. Will use in the future and maybe make variations with other ingredients. Everyone loved them."
"2","5","I used whole wheat flour and margarine, the cookies didn't look like the ones on the picture, but they were tasty. The cracks didn't form maybe because of using different flour. I doubled the vanilla and noticed that the bigger I made the balls the softer they come out and last softer as well. ENJOY!"
"2","5","I am already known as a good baker....but these cookies got RAVE reviews all around. So easy. I guess I didn't soften the butter enough, because my dough did come out a little crumbly as other reviews have stated. I just added a little milk (as in just a splash) and the dough turned out perfectly. No refrigeration needed. I rolled mine in granulated sugar before baking and that was just the little bonus that put these over the top. I took them out when they still looked a little under-baked, at exactly 8 minutes, and they turned out nice and soft."
"2","5","I made these but rolled them out and cut them! My daughters class loved them and so did I :)"
"2","5","This is my new go-to sugar cookie recipe! I heeded the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the vanilla. Also, right before I was about to bake, I remembered I had some plain M&Ms and smooshed a few into each cookie ball. I took the cookies out of the oven after exactly 8 minutes and even though they were not a golden brown like suggested, they were PERFECT! The first batch I made are already gone and I'm just now taking the 2nd batch out of the oven! Good good recipe!"
"2","5","Delicious and easy!! Add some granulated sugar with Cinnamon mixed in to the top and make it a Snickerdoodle Sugar cookie :))"
"2","5","My Family was begging me to bake cookies tonight and after digging through my pantry, I found that I only had the ingredients to make sugar cookies minus the baking soda! I found this recipe and easily substituted the baking soda with 3 tsp of baking powder! I also added a 1/2 packet of vanilla pudding mix and some orange food dye (Happy Halloween)! The cookies turned out AMAZING and I just caught my Husband with a cookie in his mouth and 4 more in his hand, mind you they are still hot from the oven as I'm typing this! I would definitely make these again as it's such a basic yummy recipe that you can easily add other ingredients to fit the season ( Peppermint, toffee, cinnamon.. ect)!"
"2","4","Tried this recipe yesterday during the hurricane, and encountered these issues:  1. If you're using non-stick dark pans, reduce baking time to 7 minutes. I burned my first batch when I baked them using the time allotted. 2. Spray cookie sheets with cooking spray!! Also, since the dough is sticky, spray some of the cooking spray in your hands, and roll teaspoonfuls of dough in your hands and drop onto cookie sheets. This helped me :)   Doing the above helped big time :)"
"2","4","Just made it! So good! Although I recommend a cook time of 7-71/2 minutes."
"2","5","Delicious and easy! Easy to make gluten-free as well."
"2","5","These were excellent in taste, but I expected a thick, fluffy cookie. These spread out into flat pancakes, even after I refrigerated them. Maybe I should use baking powder instead of soda, or freeze them before baking."
"2","5","I love this recipe...the cookies turned out perfect! Thank you! I followed the recipe for word..and it was simple and easy and delicious..and chewy!"
"2","5","Made exactly as the recipe directed & the cookies are perfect."
"2","5","Amazing! Add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to your dry mix...with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top when they're done for a little something different. Guaranteed to be a winner every time!!"
"2","5","Great recipe. Cookies were easy and fast to make. I read another review that complained about the crumbly dough, just make sure your margarine/butter is super soft. It's okay if its a little crumbly AFTER you add the dry ingredients. I was worried becuase mine was, but the cookies were great!"
"2","1","Did not rise or taste good!"
"2","5","Great flavor, easy to make, and no crazy ingredients! In other words, perfect!"
"2","5","these cookies are very tasty. I made half the batch as supposed to, the second half I made a knuckle hole in top of the ball and filled them with assorted jam just to try them a bit differently."
"2","5","yummy and easy!!!!!!my family loves it!!!!!!the best thing ever."
"2","5","These cookies are Great! There quick, easy and Delicous!"
"2","5","These cookies were easy and came out great. I whipped up a batch of these after dinner and they were so quick and easy, and before we knew it we were having a sweet treat!"
"2","5","I love these little guys! I do have to admit though, if you want to make them larger, plumper cookies, divide the serving number by four to get the actual amount. I used the '48 servings' recipe, and it turned out to have only 12. They can get a bit flat if you make them too small, and they'll need a lot of space because they enlarge while baking majorly!"
"2","5","Love these cookies! I sent them in for my son's class snack and his teachers raved about them for a month. Now they are constantly asking me to make them for snack and class parties. This recipe is a keeper!"
"2","4","Delicious! The cookie dough was a little dry so I added an extra egg though!"
"2","5","Really good sugar cookies,thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","Wow! These were really good. I made them with my elementary school students and it was fun and easy and they came out very well."
"2","5","Not that another opinion matters here, after 2800+ reviews. So, thank you for this recipe. It is soo good and tasty especially when a simple recipe is wanted. Margarine works well as a sub for the butter. Couldn't ask for a more baker friendly recipe. Light and crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. Loved by my whole family."
"2","4","Easy, basic sugar cookie. They are a soft cookie. I used 2 tsp of vanilla to give it a little more flavor. I rolled them in balls and pushed them down a little so that I could add sugar and sprinkles on top. I also used food coloring to make them pink for vday. Mine were ready in 8 min. Even if they look like they might need another minute, take them out!"
"2","5","This recipe was delicious. I made the cookies today for Valentines Day and it turned out great!!! The dough is very flexible and it taste wonderful. DO NOT OVERCOOK! Follow the directions and they will turn out fine. :)"
"2","5","Great recipe for those of us who don't have the time to roll cookie dough! Definitely be sure to soften butter fully, and beware...servings is more like 80 cookies if using the 'teaspoon dropful' that is recommended! But what's the harm in too many cookies???"
"2","5","Best sugar cookie recipe yet!!! I followed the advice of others and used thoroughly softened butter. Came out soft and Chewy in the middle and crispy at the edges. Oh, I only used 1 1/4 cups of sugar...that was just right."
"2","5","The emphasis of the recipe is on 'EASY' and these are super easy to put together. I thought they tasted nice. Nothing fancy, but when you want a quick sugar cookie without a lot of prep/chilling/fuss, this should work well. Make sure your butter really is softened, as other reviewers have pointed out, too."
"2","5","Awesome! I bake cookies all the time.... often several times a week and a huge variety of different cookie recipes. These were simple and easy. Yummy, too! Will certainly bake them again soon."
"2","5","These were wonderful! I loved that they were different than most sugar cookies! The only thing I didn't like is that they expand a lot which is not good if you want to use cookie cutters."
"2","5","Amazing tasted just like the store bought ones I bought last week"
"2","5","these cookies are awesome! they're easy to make and they are so good."
"2","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"2","5","YES! Delicious! So good! My husband made these when I was sick and he has never baked cookies in his lifetime and he is 42. They were the best sugar cookies we have ever had & we love sugar cookies~always are trying new recipes, eating them , etc. He made them exactly as is...Perfection. Thank you!"
"2","5","These are delicious! They were a huge hit! Simple to make, & so yummy!! I used unsalted butter, then added about 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt. I'm making more because they went fast!"
"2","3","My batch didn't turn out good; very gooey in the center. Mine failed either because my baking soda wasn't 'fresh,' or the recipe just wasn't that good. I tried a different recipe, though, from a Pillsbury Dough Boy cook book, and they turned out really good. The main difference was it called for powdered sugar....maybe the p. sugar made it all the more different."
"2","5","Excellent cookies that come out perfect! Super simple to make - 10 out of 10."
"2","4","Not sure if it was because I used margarine but these cookies are very buttery! Not sure if I'll make them again. But they are very soft. It made 6 dozen cookies."
"2","5","These turned out great, I rolled mine in colored sugar for Christmas. They are very easy, and nice and crispy on the outside, yet moist and buttery on the inside. They look wonderful too."
"2","5","Great quick recipe! I cut it in half because I didn't need the original 48. I baked for 11:00 for a half crispy and half soft cookie. Very simple,"
"2","5","I tried this recipe today. I'd thought they'd be great for when Santa comes. Sorry, Santa, you're not getting any! These cookies are soooo good. They deserve more than 5 stars. I agree with others about not rating a recipe if you don't follow the recipe 100% but I'm going to do it anyway. I used 1 stick of butter & 1 stick of Promise margarine. I wanted the butter for the flavor & texture but didn't want all the cholesterol. The dough was a little soft for shaping into balls, probably because of the margarine, but I handled them gently & it worked just fine. Refrigerating the dough would probably make it easier to handle. I love Snickerdoodles but rarely make them because my recipe calls for a 1/2 cup butter & a 1/2 cup of shortening. I try to avoid shortening as much as possible because of the transfat. The next time I want Snickerdoodles, I'm going to use this recipe using the butter & margarine & roll the balls in the cinnamon-sugar before baking. The end result should be a tasty but healthier Snickerdoodle. Another reason that I like this cookie is because it doesn't require any special or expensive ingredients like chocolate chips or nuts. I usually have those things on hand but not always. I hate it when an emergency cookie craving happens & I don't have all the stuff. These cookies are easy enough to handle any cookie emergency & they're very good. I rolled walnut-sized balls & got 5 & 1/2 dozen cookies about 3 inches across. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","4","Just finished these cookies, really great recipe. I added 1/4 tspn salt, rolled in colored sugar, and baked for 9 minutes. I absolutely WILL be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","Very easy and very good :) I will use this recipe again for sure!"
"2","5","I made the mistake of combining ALL the dry ingredients - including sugar - before I read the recipe again and still the cookies came out just perfect! So much for alloting 2 minutes to cream the sugar and butter as some have stated."
"2","5","Very good and easy. I added a box of vanilla instant pudding mix in the batter and they came out very soft and moist, they will melt in your mouth"
"2","5","I love these and have made them many times. I roll mine in sprinkles before putting them in the oven. You can easily make these look seasonal by changing the sprinkle colors to match the holiday."
"2","4","Made these yesterday and they are good but not great. Dough easy to work and easy to get very similar sized cookies without measuring. For our tastes, something is missing - they seem flat tasting. Perhaps because of no salt in the recipe? Not sure I'll make these again unless I need a really quick recipe for drop sugar cookies because these were really quick to put together and eat."
"2","5","These where EXCELLENT! I will be making these again, for sure."
"2","3","My cookie dough was still crumbly even though I let the butter sit out for at least an hour. I ended up adding 1/4c. of melted butter and a extra tsp. of vanilla extract. Used a plastic spoon to measure out the dough, rolled in the palm of my hand and dipped them in powdered sugar. Was able to make 70 delicious cookies out of this one batch."
"2","5","so easy to make. i made this as a base for my new cookie recipe. i substituted the water with milk and added 1/2 tsp of salt to bring out all the flavors. next time, i'm gonna add vanilla too. thanks for the recipe! =)"
"2","5","They get big, so make sure you dont press them, lol!"
"2","5","Wonderful !!! And very kid friendly, all three of my kids had a great time helping out ."
"2","5","Best sugar cookie ever! I added 1/8 t. salt, 1t. vanilla, 1t. almond extract. Sprinklied coarse sugar on top before baking. This really is the best sugar cookie I have found in 25 years."
"2","5","Super easy! My 3 year old helped me with this and they turned out awesome!"
"2","4","I was nervous to make these after reading many of the reviews. I make another sugar cookie recipe off the site but was out of cream of tartar so decided to go with these. They came out surprisingly good. I doubled the vanilla. I made sure my butter/marj (I did half and half) was room temperature. In fact, I accidently melted half my butter in the microwave before starting and was nervous that would effect the cookies but they came out great. The key is to make sure you have a creamy dough when mixing. I rolled the balls in sugar and pressed in jimmies (sprinkles). I made them bigger than it called for so I made about 30. Great, quick recipe."
"2","5","So yummy and so very easy to make :)"
"2","5","These are awesome. Many sugar cookies have to sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, but there are perfect for when you want to make cookies NOW, and with a bare minimum of ingredients. I added cinnamon to the recipe and they became snicker-doodles. Also, I didn't follow directions perfectly (I added the sugar to the dry ingredients, and then added chopped butter, egg, milk, and vanilla, and mixed the dough with my hands), and they still came out great."
"2","4","These cookies turned out great! They were extremely easy and quick. I baked the cookies exactly as the recipe said, and ate them plain. They smelled wonderful and taste as good as they look.  My first time making sugar cookies.  The only thing that I didn't like is that the cookie didn't quite maintain the moisture after one day. Nevertheless, it tasted GREAT!   Thanks for the recpe! :)"
"2","4","I made this cookies for halloween, and they were so easy to use with cookie cutter, they turned out really nice."
"2","5","great, worked out nice and tasted great too!"
"2","5","fantastic! I am definitely on a cooking/baking kick, and added two heaping tablespoons of pumpkin, and adjusted the flour to 3 cups for a delicious, seasonal snack!"
"2","5","Outstanding recipe...easy and awesome!!! They are perfect after baking for 8 minutes. I don't really care for sugar cookies but i love these!!!"
"2","4","I realized (after making half the recipe) that I had NO EGGS! I used 2tbs of mayo and about a tsp of oil and a splash of milk instead and they turned out super yummy! I also doubled the vanilla (usually do). Good recipe!"
"2","5","These cookies turned out great. I did what other reviewers suggested and let my butter become completely soft and added an extra tsp of vanilla. I didn't have any problems with dry or crumbly dough. Honestly, it may have been because I lost track of how much flour I put in. I made my first batch with probably 2 or 2 1/4 cups flour and the cookies were extremely soft and spread out but still tasted great. I added another 1/4 cup of flour and they stayed in their original shape better. Definitely only bake them for 8 minutes. They are very soft on the inside and a little crispy on the outside. Hope that's what you're looking for.   I haven't tried using these as rolled cookies. I found an amazing recipe for rolled cookies on this site and I won't ever use another recipe. 'The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies'. They are perfect for rolling and decorating."
"2","5","Mmmmmmmmm....simple and delicious. I like some others added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and rolled the top of the cookie in cinnamon and sugar. They were great!"
"2","5","5 stars! I followed the instructions as written and added one final touch: I sprinkled sugar on top before I baked them. I decided to try one batch differently- I slightly flattened them before I baked- but the cookies that I left ball shaped came out the best! Mine took 12+ minutes- they were golden and still soft. I love these! Perfect with coffee in the morning to get you started. yummm"
"2","5","Very easy and good recipe!!!!! My husband loves sugar cookies and when I made these homemade....he asked if I could make some more. I then knew this was a keeper!!! The only thing I do differently is add more vanilla extract."
"2","5","Im not a fan of Sugar Cookies, but these were really really good and easy to make. Made sure my butter was soft I did add 2 Tsps of Vanilla just cause I like it, and I ended up making 2 batches cause the kids and the hubby ate the 1st one. They do harden as they sit though so definitly take them out at 9 minuts max or they will be hard. Great flavor though. Thanks!"
"2","5","LOVE THESE!"
"2","5","First time making sugar cookies and these turned out great. I started adding stuff to them, m&m's, mint chips....they fantastic plain!"
"2","4","I gave this 4 stars because these taste great. Everything else was an epic failure. I made the mistake of following some of the suggestions that people made... like cutting down on the flour and making sure the butter was VERY soft. What I ended up with was a thin messy dough, and cookies that spread out WAY too thin. So I suggest... try following the recipe as is. I didnt and it was ugly."
"2","5","Better than my grandmother's sugar cookie recipe. I halved this recipe, using just the egg yolk instead of the whole egg. It required a tablespoon of milk afterwards, to get the dough to come together, so I probably could have just used the whole egg in the first place. I rolled them in cinnamon sugar as well and they somewhat resembled a snickerdoodle."
"2","5","These cookies were easy to make and were delish!! I rolled in sugar before putting the dough on the pan. The only thing I would change would be less flour. The tasted very 'flour-y' and heavy."
"2","5","These cookies were really good! We did not have white flour so we used whole wheat -- It worked great! Roll the balls in a bowl of sugar if you want an extra sugary kick, and who doesn't?!? Very moist and crisp, delicate and the perfect night-time snack. You may consider reducing the amount of flour and putting in more egg. It makes so many, we had enough to give to our neighbors! Will make again...for sure!"
"2","5","These cookies are AMAZING!! The butter needs to be SUPER SOFT or they won't come out well. I mixed in mini M&M's and rolled each dough ball in sugar before I baked them. Yum!"
"2","5","Wow, these were SO easy and came out great. My husband doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, but he was grabbing one every time he passed the kitchen."
"2","3","I cut this recipe down because I only wanted to make cookies for my husband and I. This did not turn out successful. Although they tasted pretty good, they had the texture of cake rather than the crispiness of cookies. I was disappointed, but will try to make them again without changing the serving size."
"2","5","My daughter and I made these for Father's Day. They are Daddy's favorite! We baked a dozen and froze the rest of the dough to make cookies whenever we want. Thank you for the recipe!"
"2","5","Love this recipe. Was looking for something I could make with ingredients I already had in the house. These were perfect! Great sugar cookie."
"2","5","These are great. I brushed the tops with butter, then dipped them in cin & sugar and the boys are loving them. Thanks."
"2","5","How could you not love these cookies. They are buttery, not too sweet and so delicious. Oh, easy to make too. For slightly chewy cookies, bake them at 9 minutes. For crispy cookies, bake them at 10 minutes. Love these."
"2","5","My first batch was absolutely perfect. Slightly crunchy on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside. What's more is the cookie looked like a cookie you would buy from a cookie shop."
"2","5","Wonderful, simple sugar cookie recipe! I'm a little picky about my baking recipes, and my husband is very picky, and we both loved them."
"2","3","Dough was too dry, too much flour. So I added juice of two limes and the zest. They came out very nice still very sweet for the amount of lime I used."
"2","5","Best cookies EVER!"
"2","5","Very easy! Taste is great I used splenda. I flattened them a little bit before baking and 8 minutes is plenty of time."
"2","5","These are a great quick alternative to roll-out sugar cookies and taste GREAT. They don't need to chill or be rolled flat. The only 'downside,' if you will, is that the tops are not flat like a conventional roll-out sugar cookie for decorating. Not a big problem, as I definitely still give them 5 stars, but just thought I would mention it."
"2","4","This tastes more like a shortbread to me, but it's easy and made of ingredients that I had in the cupboard. I added lemon and put a dollop of raspberry jam on top."
"2","5","Great, simple recipe!   Instead of softened butter, melt the butter (slowly and carefully, so you don't burn it) in the microwave before mixing with the sugar. This will help dissolve the sugar and probably make the dough more manageable.   I was out of baking soda so I used 4 tsp of baking powder, and I probably used a little too much cause I can kinda taste it in the cookies.  I refrigerated my dough overnight and the dough was very stiff when I went to bake it, resulting in awesomely fluffy, cute cookies. =)"
"2","2","These cookies didn't expand for me. They turned out hard and dry."
"2","5","Excellent. Followed recipe exactly (used salted butter) & these came out perfectly."
"2","3","the dough was very crumbly and took a very long time to cook (close to 20 minutes) but once the cookies finally baked, they were very good."
"2","5","Easy, quick, and delicious! Stuck to just 8 minutes in the oven and they were perfect! Rolled mine in green sugar for St. Patty's Day and they were excellent. Used the specified amount of vanilla and they flavor was perfect. The cookies came out a little smaller than expected -- they didn't spread out as much as I anticipated, but I compensated by rolling bigger cookies after the first sheet. This is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","This is indeed a very simple, straightforward recipe. I've had nothing but success with it.   One enhancement I do is add about a quarter teaspon of almond extract, along with the vanilla, to the sugar, butter and eggs.  Plain, old-fashioned sugar cookies like these have always been among my favorite cookies."
"2","5","I made my sugar cookies using mini muffin pans, made a cream cheese and powdered sugar, vanilla frosting, and topped them with fresh raspberries. These are so yummy and elegant they are always a hit at all my get together s. This recipe is perfect for my sugar cups with fresh fruit."
"2","5","this is the one it is so good. I've cooked this recipe like 15 times. I cook it for my family, and get togethers. I hope everyone that cooks this recipe likes it. Have a wonderful day :)"
"2","4","Really sweet. Looking for something closer to Loft House Sugar cookies."
"2","5","WoW! These were REALLY GOOD! I did make some adjustments, use about 3/4 C white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1/4 cup coconut and a tsp of cinn, omitted vanilla b/c I ran out. Also had to sub shortening for the butter. Dough was a little bit too crumbly so I added a few tbsp at a time of milk to bring it together. After forming and putting on the pan I added a single chocolate chip to the top of each cookie for some flair. Baked about 11 min. Wow they're almost gone, everyone in the house loves them."
"2","4","The first time I did these cookies they were very crumbly and came out hard. I thought that the recipe calls for to much flour. So I started with 2 cups flour and added a flour to it to make the dough like cookie dough. They came out much better."
"2","2","Proportion of dry to wet ingredients is off. The dough is far to dry (had to mix it with my hands to get it even close to being workable). Suggest cutting back on the flour by at least 1/4 cup. PS As suggested by another reviewer, I did make sure the butter was soft before creaming, so that was not the problem."
"2","5","i love these cookies i make them all he time with my best friend! and the best part is that even thought there amazing, you can make them into shapes too! there just as good that way and great if you want to have some fun with the cookies!!!"
"2","4","At first I was worried that the batter was too dry and the cookies wouldn't come out right BUT in the end they worked out fine. And they made exactly the amount that was advertised.  I ended up adding a bit of extra vanilla, using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar. Also cooked them for 10 minutes. I would absolutely make these again because they were delicious and super easy! It's also easy to have all the ingredients on hand."
"2","5","These are perfect! Not too sweet, not too rich. Just perfect. I baked some of them a little bit longer to get more crispiness."
"2","5","I made these today and sprinkled red colored sugar on top for Valentine's day and they turned out perfect! I was also amazed at how easy they were to make!"
"2","4","Made these today, substituted butter for oil, and vanilla extract for vanilla powder. I'd say this is pretty good, they puff up quickly."
"2","4","Use unsalted butter and a touch of freshly ground nutmeg."
"2","5","Followed the instructions of other reviewers and added an extra half teaspoon of vanilla and took them out right at 8 minutes--perfect! I also sprinkled colored sugar on the top of the dough balls and it came out great."
"2","1","I'm sorry everyone but I did not care for these cookies!!!! Was very excited to make these at first as im trying to get into cooking...followed the recipe to the T...1st batch baked 8 mins and after cooling tasted weird then got hard as a rock...2nd batch i tried dipping each ball in sugar and baking for 6 mins they still tasted funny and very doughy....3rd batch added vanilla and dipped balls in sugar again baked 7 mins still tasted bad"
"2","4","This cookie was okay, I added another half a teaspoon of vanilla as other reviews suggested. After following the recipe, the dough was very crumbly, so I added another egg and the dough became perfect. After baking, I found the cookie wasn't sweet enough, so next time I will add another 1/4 cup of sugar."
"2","3","Made these cookies today. A little disappointed. Didn't have a lot of flavor. Put mini M&M's on them to give them a little color. Maybe next time I will roll them in colored sugar for a little more flavor. Also, others had remarked about them not staying together, but I used my cookie scoop which I think helped."
"2","5","These cookies are AWEsOME!! The only difference was I used self rising flour, I always use self-rising. Using the self-rising means omitting the baking soda and baking powder. I didn't have any vanilla so I used orange extract, YUMMO! If you want the cookies to stay moist PLEASE remove them from the oven at 8min. They may not look done, but still continue to cook while cooling. Will def. use this recipe again. THANX! My daughter and I even rolled the balls in color sugar and then squished the balls like you do w/ PB cookies, b4 cooking."
"2","3","I made half the recipe, reducing the ingredients by half. The cookies were heavy in the middle, after 9 minutes in the oven. Perhaps they needed another minute to bake. Next time I will definitely increase the sugar. The shape is true to the photo given with the recipe; they do not fall apart or crack. I added a touch of vanilla for flavor."
"2","4","This is the best sugar cookie recipe, I use it every time I make these cookies, and they always come out good. Thanks!!!!"
"2","5","Made these and my mom said they were 'the best sugar cookies she's ever eaten' I had to add a couple sprinkles of water to the mixture because it was too crumbly otherwise. The recipe claims to make 48, but I rolled my into golf ball sized balls, and gently pressed them down with two fingers and it made 15 huge bakery style cookies. When they came out of the oven I sprinkled a little sugar on top of them too...Absolutely Delicious!"
"2","5","Great easy recipe. I used 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla and a quarter cup less of flour. I used teaspoon sized balls and got way more than 4 dozen. I would say closer to 6 or 7 dozen! That's good though because they are absolutely delicious and I am gonna be eating these like crazy. Each cookie turned out perfectly round and nicely baked after exactly 8 minutes in the oven. Great recipe, thanks!"
"2","5","perfect, easy, easy, easy. i added an additional teaspoon of vanilla and baked 9 minutes. so delicious and so beautiful."
"2","5","YUM! So easy! I baked em 8 minutes and they were perfect! I put red hots on some of them and they were great!. Simple, easy and cheap to make!"
"2","5","Super easy, had everything already in the pantry and they turned out great! Will make again, thanks!"
"2","5","AWESOME :) Great cookies....butter MUST be at room temp....keeps cookies soft"
"2","5","I had been searching everywhere for an easy recipe, with few ingredients and no chill time. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added an additional teaspoon of vanilla. Before I started, I read reviews and made sure my butter was softened and I baked it for exactly 8 minutes. The results were outstanding. I served these cookies for a birthday party and they were a hit! I am going to have to try to make cut-outs from these and try chilling them in the fridge for a few hours... Stay tuned."
"2","2","mine tasted like baking soda, I was sad. I followed the recp to the T ... Next."
"2","5","Soft, chewy and versatile."
"2","5","These are the best sugar cookies in the WORLD"
"2","5","Excellent! I used 1 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar - like the other reviews said; softened butter (whipped) and take em out if you think they need 2 more min - they wont."
"2","5","This recipe is phenomenal. The butter needs to be super soft, basically like a thick cream. I used parkay margarine in the tub and scooping it out should be like scooping out fluffy whipped cream thats how soft it needs to be. I added 1 extra tablespoon and it came out amazing!!!!! 1 rounded teaspoon might be too small but a tablespoon comes out the size of a flat fist so somewhere in the middle is perfect. I drizzled mine with homemade chocolate which is basically just half of a bag of semisweet chocolate chips, some sugar, vanilla extract, baking cocoa powder (just a pinch or two), and a splash of milk here and there. The chocolate you basically have to eyeball so remember you can always add more but you can never take anything away. I love this recipe my new favorite"
"2","5","This was my first time making sugar cookies! They came out perfect!!! I'm glad i read the reviews first because, you should def. let the butter sit out, until it's soft!"
"2","1","I'm a HUGE fan of baking cookies and I was looking forward to using a simple sugar cookie recipe. Unfortunately, they came out tasting of flour. It seemed that they needed a more wet consistency. Maybe an extra egg and more butter. Even so the major issue was the flavor, it tasted bland and dry. This is not a recipe I would recommend nor try again. Inedible. I felt cheated and a waste of ingredients."
"2","3","These cookies were quick to put together with ingredients everyone has, but it was difficult to mix it all together in the final steps. Its as though there needs to be more butter or eggs. The dough was very crumbly and I had to press each dough ball hard in my palms to get the dough to stick together. They came out looking rocky and almost impossible to decorate with icing. The taste was also very bland."
"2","5","These are easy and delicious!"
"2","5","i love these cookies!!!!....I have made them twice now the only thing that i do to make the cookie dough more manageable and come together better is i add like 2 table spoons of milk to it if at the end its to crumbley......love these and so does everyone i share them with"
"2","5","Love this recipe!!! I do not change a thing. They turn out perfect every time."
"2","3","Holy flour! The dough was extrely crumbly, so much so that a good 1/4 of it was wasted. The cookie tastes good, and what did turn out was okay. I think with some adjustments, this could be a good cookie recipe. It wouldn't be my go-to sugar cookie recipe just yet, though."
"2","5","dont listen to the negitive at all k. if you want to make them heres how first throw in the dry stuff. when adding flower do not pack keep loose. then add the liquid ingredients after that mix it. Also when adding butter melt I do and ya get it into a liqiud form, I believe its easy to add it into the ingredients then use a large wisk to mix just stabe continuesly and once it mixes together then stir it will be hard but stire. once it pulls away from side and moist by looks get a large spoon and add to ya likings, DO NOT TOUCH dough at all only when putting it on the pan got to so you can get it on the pan try to avoid excess touching though. keep an eye on cookies they will look light brown when done. GREAT TASTE and oh wait until they are cool to take off pan and when putting on cookies its best to add pam or something to keep from sticking to pan"
"2","4","This is an awesome reciepe! But instead of pre-heating the oven to 375 I put it on 350 for about 8-9minutes and they were perfect! And instead of 1 teaspoon of vanilla I did 2 teaspoons of Almond extract. but if you were to use Vanilla surely use 2 teaspoons not 1."
"2","5","Super easy and delicious!"
"2","2","the way these cookies turned out was probably my fault however I'll say what I did to pre-warn any other bakers trying to make this change. i attempted to make the recipe using Splenda instead of sugar to make them Diabetic friendly. i also halfed the recipe. the dough looked perfect....i rolled them into balls and baked them and they never flattened at all. i'm left with almost perfectly round balls of sugar cookie. they went crumbly and broke apart when i tried to gently mash them down after removing from the oven. the one good thing is they did taste pretty good..."
"2","2","I followed the recipe and the cookies came out not so tasty. They tasted too much like flour and they weren't very sweet."
"2","5","Excellent, very easy recipe. I made it as described and the cookies are delicious. The one thing I did different was to roll the cookie balls in sugar before baking. I will make this one again and again."
"2","5","Great!! I loved the cookies and so did the family"
"2","5","I used an apple sauce cup (100ml) instead of the egg and they taste great! Awesome, easy recipe - thanks!"
"2","1","My oppinion was that they smell like burnt popcorn."
"2","5","just take them out before they look done! It was hard for me to take them out of the oven early enough but when I did, they were perfect. Some of them I rolled in a cin/sugar mix before cooking & they were wonderful too. My husband LOVES them and I have already made them a few times!"
"2","5","great recipe, just add extra butter and bake 8 mins at 325% for softer cookies :)"
"2","5","These are some of the best Sugar cookies I have ever eaten! I took the advice of several people and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, rolled them in sugar and only cooked them for 8 minutes. I also finally learned what it means to cream sugar and butter and the rest was an airy, soft cookie that had just the right amount of sweetness. I am glad these turned out well because now I have to make 600 of them!"
"2","5","I was looking for an easy cookie recipe that didn't require a trip to the grocery store, and I was fortunate enough to find this one. I am so glad I tried it! These were really great! I will be using this a lot!"
"2","5","Let me first say that I have NEVER left a review for anything... but these cookies were the easiest and the MOST delicious cookies ever! I let them cook for only 8 min and 2 days later they are still soft!"
"2","5","Excellent! I added a 1/4 more tsp of vanilla and stuck to the 8 mins - after setting the cookies are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. THESE WENT QUICK! Loved that these are drop. Rolled them in sugar before baking = DELISH! Will add these to a holiday must!"
"2","3","I made the cookies a little on the large side so they actually took about 15 minutes. Also, the dough was so thick it made my KitchenAid mixer work on overtime. It was literally shaking. I added a little more butter and it seemed to help a tad. If I make them again I will use an additional egg. The dough raw didn't taste quite right, I'm a huge fan of raw cookie dough. And when baked they were OKAY. Not sure if I'll make them again."
"2","2","I am a notoriously bad baker but I really followed these directions closely. My butter was definitely soft room temperature. The batter was DRY and crumbly. The end result cookie was tasty but floury in flavor. I probably won't make these again."
"2","5","This is a excellent sugar cookie recipe! It really is easy and simple. They only change I made was the sugar. I used only 1 cup while the recipe called for 1 1/2. I didn't want them to be too sweet. They turned out great! My friends and family loved them!"
"2","1","recipe amounts totally wrong,came out dry,hard, tasted like baked flour............."
"2","5","I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I MADE PLAIN SUGAR COOKIES WITH THIS RECIPE AND I ALSO HAVE MADE SEVERAL BATCHES BUT ADDED CRUSHED CANDY CANES & ALL HAVE TURNED OUT PERFECT :) I BAKED MY COOKIES FOR EXACTLY 8 MINUTES AND THEY TURNED OUT WONDERFUL :) I have been making these cookies for over a year now. Butter needs to be super soft. cream butter & sugar for a good while approx 4 min. double vanilla. Bake for exactly 8 min. If adding crushed candy canes add 5 of them and make sure you cover the baking sheet with foil first or candy canes will stick & ruin cookies. I have no idea how anyone could dislike this recipe & my dough has never been dry and/or crumbly"
"2","5","I made these cookies for the first time and they were absolutely delicious. They were so soft and chewy. I did add 2 eggs and 2 tsp. of vanilla instead of 1 egg and 1 tsp. vanilla. My family loved them. They were gone in a day. I keep cookie dough I make in the fridge for hours and sometimes overnight. What an awesome cookie. Will make for the holidays."
"2","5","We used this recipe for the candy corn cookies in the Betty Crocker fall baking 2009 recipe booklet. The original recipe calls for 48 cookies. Use 1/2 of this recipe and it makes about 7 - 8 dozen candy corn cookies."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies turned out fantastic! So easy! Make sure all the ingredients are mixed completely. The final dough does seem a little dry but the cookies turn out fabulous. This is my new recipe to use from now on!"
"2","4","These are pretty good, definitely easy. I made half a batch since I had some frosting left over to use up on something. My only complaint is that the next day they were very crumbly."
"2","5","I make giant cookies for my grandchildren every year on their birthdays. My grand daughter requested a sugar cookie this year, and I picked this recipe because of the ratings. The heart shape cookie was a hit. I decorated the cookie with icing and sprinkles."
"2","5","I love these! Everyone in my family does! They are so yummy! Please give these cookies a chance! (They'll totally win you over over store bought cookies)"
"2","5","I followed the tip to soften the butter to the point of 'mush' - cookies were perfect. They are a great standard sugar cookie - easy to make, crisp on the outside, soft in the middle. Mine took 10-12 minutes to bake on insulated pans. They did double in size when cooked."
"2","5","Excellent Recipe for Sugar Cookies, perfect they way the it is written."
"2","5","I made these with Splenda instead of white sugar, and they came out delicious - more like shortbread than a sugar cookie, but excellent with coffee! The dough is very easy to handle and isn't sticky at all."
"2","5","My husband LOVES these cookies. One tip that I think is really important is to be sure the butter is COMPLETELY softened before adding it. Leave it out long before you plan to make the cookies so it can get mushy. Also, pull them out at 8 minutes and let them cool...they'll be nice and soft and chewy inside! Update: I've made these cookies at least 10 times and along with the above mushy butter, be sure to whip the wet ingredients until fluffy before folding in the dry ingredients. They are sooooo outrageous - we're eating them RIGHT NOW!"
"2","5","OMG!!! These came out awesome!!! Nice soft center, crispy on the outside, with great flavor too!!! I always over pour the vanilla on all recipes. I also softened the butter in the microwave and some of it melted. The dough was very easy to work with and soft, no crumbles!!! You have to use real butter not that margarine stuff!! I also baked for 12min they didnt look done at 10. Thanks for the recipe I will definitely use it again!!"
"2","5","Delish! My husband made them once and they were perfect. Then I made them and made this mistake: I rolled them into compact balls before putting them in the oven. That was stupid. The bottoms burned and they didn't spread outwards. Just wanted to let everyone know not to do what I did!"
"2","5","These babies are delectable and highly addictive! I made them with my daughter, who pressed candy redhots into the dough balls before we baked them. Also, she added a few (A LOT) sugar sprinkles to the tops. A fun, easy cookie to make with kids. Just be sure that you don't eat them all yourself!"
"2","2","I baked these cookies yesterday, and they were very simple to make. They were however too sweet, even after decreasing the amount of sugar the recipe called for, and tasted very bland, although I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla."
"2","5","Delicious!!! Yummy! They are the best drop sugar cookies I have ever made. They were quick and easy to make."
"2","5","I used this as a base for fruit pizza and it was delicious! Everyone raved. Thanks for posting it!!"
"2","5","These were very simple to make, and great because they didn't need to be chilled. They were chewy, flavorful, and they tasted very similar to refrigerated dough (but without the preservatives, corn syrup and hydrogenated oils!)"
"2","4","Kids like them...I made mine supersoft...a very good sugar cookie recipe...thanks"
"2","3","Very easy to make, looked good with pretty pastel sugars, but they were a little too 'buttery' for my taste."
"2","5","Love these cookies!! They come out perfect every time, and everyone loves them! Just have to make sure the butter is actually soft first, or the dough is all crumbly."
"2","5","leave butter out for a while to soften"
"2","4","I loved these cookies. I followed other review advise of rolling them in sugar and baking them for exactlhy 8 min and letting them cool. I added a thin layer of lemon frosting and since there not that sweet it balances out. I didnt have a rolling pin and this saved me. Thank You!!"
"2","5","PERFECT! ( do make sure the butter is ALL THE WAY SOFT ) Makes for a buttery, soft, chewy cookie!"
"2","4","Very good! Cookies turned out great. Larger than in most recipes and very soft on the inside. Good taste too."
"2","5","Have been looking for a really good sugar cookie recipe and I finally found it. Followed the recipe and the cookies were perfect and totally delicious. The only thing I might do next time would be to add a little more vanilla, only because I am a vanilla freak. Thanks for the great recipe."
"2","4","In starting the dough I found it to be very dry and very crumbly. I had softened the butter, but apparently you have to nearly liquefy it. I melted about 2 TBS more of butter and stirred that in, which seemed to solve the problem. After that, they went very smoothly. They came out of the oven very nicely, they came off the baking sheet wonderfully, and the flavor was very good. The major plus to this recipe is how easy it was and how little dishes it took. It's so easy to clean up after making these, even the baking sheet is easy: the cookies do not stick in the least. All in all, they were worth it."
"2","5","AMAZING! I have used this recipe time and time again and it always comes out perfect. For some reason this time, the dough just wouldn't stick together. Probably my mistake, but I added a dash of milk and they were just perfect!!! Thanks again!"
"2","5","The pictures of many of these recipes are as persuasive as the list of ingredients. I'm so glad this one caught my attention. I doubled the vanilla and added 1/2 tsp. of salt to suit my taste. Other than that I was very careful not to overbake. My oven runs high, so I made an adjustment to 370 degrees baking time and 8 minutes was perfect. They were delicious!!!!!!"
"2","4","Good recipe for a quick sugar cookie. I rolled in coloured sugar before baking. You need to add about a 1/2 teaspoon salt, other wise it is too bland."
"2","2","Perhaps I didn't make them correctly, but, while these were extremely easy to make, the texture just wasn't quite right, they were too crumbly for my taste."
"2","4","i baked these and all my friends loved it. just follow the instruction accurately and yummmm"
"2","5","Easy and tasty! Made em with my KAM. Halved the recipe. Used a small oxo scoop to shape them - simple and delicious! Baked at 9 minutes for soft, 11 minutes for a little crunchy around the edges in my oven."
"2","5","Cannot get any easier than this recipe and the cookies are awesome"
"2","1","Even after reading the suggestions from other reviews I still came out with crumbly dough. I used soft butter, added an extra egg and some extra vanilla and I froze the dough briefly and sprayed my hands with PAM but still had a tough time with the dough coming together. The flavor of the dough was nice but it wasn't worth the time."
"2","3","This isnt the best sugar cookie recipe I have made. They came out tasting great, but they lacked the gewy center that I love."
"2","3","My dough came out crumbly and dry. A bit disappointed I turned it into shortbread. It tasted great. It's a better recipe for short bread than sugar cookies."
"2","5","This recipe was amazing. Baked beautifully, and turned out fantastic. After the doe was made I rolled in sugar and cinammion. I will add this to my recipes, and will make agian and again!"
"2","5","Easy to make, easy to bake, and not so easy to keep any around."
"2","5","These were absolutley amazing and easy!! I had a midnight cookie craving (gotta love pregnancy..lol) and didn't want to wake my hubby. Had all the ingredients, went together quickly, and they STAYED SOFT!!! I put little hersey piece in the middle of each one, and they were wonderful!"
"2","5","My son found this great recipe. My kids and husband love the dough and the cookies!"
"2","2","Very little flavor. If you like them soft, bake for 8 min instead of ten. Next time, will try adding a flavored extract to add some taste."
"2","5","Delicious!!!! I did what the reviews suggested and made sure to let my butter soften first by letting it sit out. They taste like cookies bought at a bakery and everyone wanted more!"
"2","5","this were amazing! Soft, chewy, and delicious!"
"2","1","they are not the best, because once they cooled down, they were not that great, and they were spongey inside. Me and my mom did not like them."
"2","5","Very good and easy! I liked that you don't have to chill the dough or cut out shapes. We rolled them in sprinkles and they were great."
"2","1","Ok, so this recipe looked really good, that is until I was finished mixing everything. I followed exactly and the dough turned out very loose and clumpy, kinda like pebbly sand. I tried a little from this batch, turned out dry, hard and bleh. I added a little milk to it and proceeded when I was actually able to get the dough to stick. Cookies after they were done, tasted like burnt cardboard and were dry and hard. Will not be using this recipe again!!"
"2","1","Very flat. Tasted like burnt, stale popcorn."
"2","1","Followed the recipes to a T...they spread super thin and mushy all over the pan...used a cool pan but it didnt help. I even tried chilling the dough first and that didnt help either. I cooked them for 9 minutes and they were brown on the edge (from being too thin) and raw in the middle."
"2","3","they taste fine, but spread way too much and were very flat...I made them thumbprint-style and put a hershey's kiss in the middle of each one and they just look like flat disks with kisses sticking out of the center...unfortunately, while the taste is acceptable, I am not comfortable bringing them to my holiday party...I bake all the time, so I can't imagine it was my leavening ingredients...and the recipe was so simple, that I can't imagine I did something so wrong that it's worth trying again"
"2","5","VERY easy to make! My 4 year old daughter and I made them and she was able to help roll the dough into balls and put them on the cookie sheet. We found though that smashing them almost flat worked out better as far as baking for 10 minutes. We followed the directions and let it sit on the cookie sheet for another 2 minutes before putting them on the cooling rack. They are crispy, yet have a bit of chewiness in the middle. Although there is NO almond extract in these cookies, they remind me of the consistency of those chinese almond cookies. I bet if you subbed or added almond extract, it'd be exactly like the almond cookies you get from chinese restaurants. I'd definitely make these again. Gonna try rolling this dough and making cut-out cookies next!"
"2","5","This recipe is great. I wound up making them into chocolate sugar cookies. Just add a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. I also rolled them in confectioners sugar before baking. Ummmmmm wonderful taste. Great sugar cookie recipe !!!1"
"2","5","Thank you! I teach school in Japan, so most of my students (7 year olds) have never baked or decorated cookies before. I needed something extremely simple that we could whip up as a class and bake in the school's tiny toaster oven. This was perfect; I measured out the ingredients at home, let the kids mix them together, decorate, and bake. The cookies were absolutely delicious, and the kids were thrilled. A wonderful school memory for them!"
"2","2","It was very easy to make but not as tasty to eat."
"2","5","very easy!! crispy outside, chewy inside, rolled in colored sugar, yum!"
"2","5","This is the best simple sugar cookie recipe I have used. I was looking for an easy one to make with my girls, and stumbled on this one. Its great. Cookies come out moist and yum."
"2","4","ADD ONE MORE EGG! This made all the difference. My batter was dry and crumbly and was not holding together well. Once I added an additional egg the batter was perfect. I too took others advice and added .5 teaspoon extra vanilla. Use butter instead of margarine. I sprinkled with colored sugar immediately after taking them out of the oven. To recap-use a total of 2 eggs and 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla, butter instead of margarine."
"2","1","These cookies came out flat, crumbly and flavorless. I followed the recipe to the letter and used nice soft butter (maybe too soft?) and ended up with these misshapen coasters that have a strong aftertaste of plain old flour. The texture's bad, the flavor's missing. Now, what will I do with all these cookies?"
"2","5","My 6 year old son made these while I instructed him. They turned out GREAT! I took others' suggestions and added more vanilla (1 1/2tsp instead of 1), but other than that, they were amazing! They were the perfect size to give to my kids, too!"
"2","5","This recipe was amazing! I love to bake so I made these for my brother. I added 1/2 teaspoon more of vanilla to get more flavor. I baked them for exactly 8-8 min. and 30 sec. they turned out perfect and you can tell when they are done when the top starts splitting.......right after they got out of the oven i sprinkled sugar on top while they were still warm! 'YUM!'"
"2","5","The first time I made these they came out absolutely perfect and stayed soft and delicious for many days. The second time they were too buttery, so I'll make sure to watch the butter next time (and there will be many next times!)"
"2","1","Condensed Review: These cookies taste like popcorn! So, I saw all these reviews (most of them good) and figured 'how could 1,700+ people be wrong?'. I saw tons of great reviews, but came across one person who said they tasted like popcorn. I laughed, and thought 'wow, what did SHE do wrong?' Then, I made them. The dough was not 'moldable' so I guess something was wrong even before I baked them. They were in the oven for exactly 8 minutes, yet were overcooked on the bottom. They were also very yellow, and very thin - almost transparent. I made my husband try first (he's like a human garbage disposal) and he said 'they're the weirdest things, they taste just like popcorn!'. I just had to laugh, because he didn't read any of the reviews (nor did I mention it). I don't know why, or how, but I would rename them popcorn cookies. The ONLY thing I can think, is that I used Country Crock margarine (although TONS of people do this for sugar cookies). I just don't know how it could go THIS wrong, though, even from the start, with the dough. So weird!"
"2","5","These were great. I cut the recipe in half, make larger cookies and had to cook them for a bit longer. The only changes to the recipe that I made were that I put in twice the amount of vanilla extract and I added some almond extract. I also iced them and dumped a bunch of sprinkles and decorations on them. I used the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe on this site by Kathy Brandt."
"2","5","MMM. The flavor on these is great! They are perfect. They come out best if you make small cookies. And watch not to leave them in too long! A minute or so can mean the difference between soft and crunchy texture. :)"
"2","4","Bake for 8 minutes so the cookies stay soft. Make sure the butter is softened to practically mush. I used 1/4 less flour, and probably could have used slightly less."
"2","5","My kids and husband love love love these cookies! Just to make them a little different I roll them in cinnamin and sugar mixture (just combine equal parts and then roll the ball of cookie dough into it)! They look exactly like the picture but cinnaminy! You can also roll/cut these cookies into shapes. Just freeze dough for 45 minutes to an hour. They turn out to be soft and chewy! Just bake them at 8 minutes!!"
"2","5","Super easy, VERY good cookies! Definitely a must to have soft butter, and mix the heck out of the dough w/ the dry ingredients (used a hand mixer). I found it better for cookie shape to slightly flatten the cookies slightly (mine didn't spread as much as other reviews led me to believe). Thank you for a great sugar cookie recipe!!"
"2","4","Do with 1/2 the sugar same butter content (don't deviate on the butter. It's the binder.)"
"2","4","We've been using this recipe in my household as a crust for 'cup pies'--we bake the cookies in a muffin pan and fill the crusts with cinnamon apples. They're so delicious that way that we've yet to try making them the old-fashioned way! They're also lovely with some lemon or lime juice."
"2","4","So, I tried these with shortening rather than butter because it's what I had on hand (I know....I know...how could I not have butter in the house!?). They are a great sugar cookie and seem like they'd lend themselves really well to transitioning right into snickerdooles. With shortening, they are moister in the middle....I made flattened golf ball sized rounds and baked for 11 minutes and they were perfect....slightly crispy on the outside, chewy inside."
"2","5","Easy and tasty. Everybody LOVES them!!"
"2","5","Delicious, esp. with sugar cookie icing from this site."
"2","5","I wanted soft and chewy like the kind you buy in the refrigerated section at the store, and that's what I got. I added a tablespoon of oil to ensure they would be soft, after reading some reviews. Also, replaced the baking powder with cream of tartar because I like the taste. Delicious!"
"2","5","Add a little almond extract and these are perfect. My husband loves these and is always wanting me to make more."
"2","5","The Best sugar cookie ever! Rolled them in sugar before baking and dusted with sugar afterwards. Grandkids are going to LOVE these!"
"2","5","Excellent! I love sugar cookies (actually, they're about the only cookies I eat) and these were perfect. As far as the butter comments go, I had to look up exactly what creaming the sugar and butter meant for another recipe before and that helped a LOT with any recipe calling for it. Also, I sometimes like to make faux snickerdoodle and sprinkle them with sugar and cinnamon when they are still kinda wet, fresh out of the oven."
"2","5","Easy, Easy, Easy! This is my go-to cookie when I'm in the mood to bake. I am usually a mediocre baker, but these are no fail! I bake them for less time because we like them softer -they seem to melt in your mouth this way. I also color my own 'Sugar in the Raw' or Turbinado Sugar (the larger crystal) with food coloring. Just put 1/2 cup sugar with a few drops of coloring in a zip-lock and shake/massage the bag. Add color till you get your desired hue. Gives great crunch and color when baked!"
"2","5","The whole family loved these, and they did stay soft which I have not been able to do with a sugar cookie until now. YUM!"
"2","5","I LOVE THESE AMAZING COOKIES!! THEY RULE!!! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and it tasted 10 X better!"
"2","5","these were devoured in my home... didn't change a thing!!"
"2","2","totally don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe as it is, but my cookies were flat...not at all like any of the pictures. I tried it a second time and even chilled it in the fridge with the same result. Must be me,cuz everyone else had good results."
"2","5","Perfect! Added a little more flour for my elevation."
"2","2","These were really bland! Yes they were super easy to make, but taste is the most important thing at our house. Will not make again. Sorry....."
"2","4","I loved how these cookies turned out! Thanks for sharing the recipe. I did get the butter REALLY soft and I did add an extra tsp of vanilla. I like my cookies a bit softer and thicker that is why it is getting a 4 vs. a 5!"
"2","5","These were excellent! They were so easy and delicious. I rolled some in cinammon & sugar, put choc chips in the middle of others and even topped a couple with dried cranberries. I did double the vanilla and recommend it. We froze half the batch and I think they were even better after they thawed :)"
"2","5","These cookies are SO YUMMY! But I must agree with the review before mine...make sure the butter is really really soft, and also if you use the handy 'calculate' button above the recipe to change the amounts beware. I wanted to change the recipe down to 2 dozen and the amount of ingrediants it came up with only made a dozen...so if at all possible stick with the original recipe! You will LOVE these cookies and they are super easy!"
"2","5","This is a great recipe. I added the zest of 1 lemon and a TBLS of lemon juice. Rolled them in large crystal colored sugar. They were the bomb!"
"2","5","Loved them! I followed the recipe as stated except I did add a little more vanilla. I rolled the balls in turbinado sugar and lightly flattened them before convection-baking for exactly 8 minutes (perfection). This is a super quick and easy recipe that I will use often! Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
"2","5","This recipe was the BEST sugar cookie recipe I have ever made. Even better than store bought. I am keeping this recipe 4ever! When I took them out of the oven they were crumbly and smushy though. I let them cool and they were great! They hardly lasted a day. My favorite recipe by far!"
"2","5","These cookies both looked good and tasted good! They were super quick and easy to make but delicious at the same time. We substituted only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 so it wouldn't be too sweet and also instead of vanilla extract we substited peppermint although it would be advised to add another tsp to it and wha la! We had amazing peppermint cookies that both tasted and looked great! We loved these cookies and will definately keep the recipe!"
"2","5","Easy & yummy!!!!! I used 2 tsp vanilla & rolled them in sugar before baking, as others had suggested. I will definately make them again! Thank you!!!!"
"2","5","softest and most moist sugar cookie recipe ever. as soon as they were cooled, i immediatly put them in airtight containers. stayed soft and chewy for days. i do not care for crispy sugar cookies so these were just awesome. i also added an extra tsp of vanilla."
"2","5","Simple and delicious. I made these for my daughter's third grade class. I followed the ingredients, but I did roll the dough in sugar before baking. I'll make them again with colored sugar for holidays. I used butter, but I may try margarine next time, as suggested by another reviewer. We used teaspoons to measure out the dough and ended up with exactly 6 dozen small cookies. I cooked them for 9 minutes on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. They didn't appear to be cooked all the way through because they hadn't begun to brown on the edges, but the cooled to a wonderful, chewy texture. I accidentally spilled an extra half-teaspoon of vanilla into the mix, but I'll do so on purpose next time."
"2","4","Incredibly quick, easy and great-tasting sugar cookie! For the holidays, we roll each ball into sprinkles or colored coarse sugar before baking to spruce them up. Also, try rolling them in cinnamon sugar before baking if you like Snickerdoodles but not the bitter aftertaste the cream of tartar gives them. These crackle just as nicely!"
"2","5","if you like the pillsbury sugar cookies, you will love these."
"2","5","We made cookie bouquets for a fund raiser and these were perfect. They were very quick to make. Loved that they didn't need to be rolled out and they stayed thick enough to put a stick in them. Made 6 batches and they were all perfect."
"2","5","Perfect Sugar Cookies. I've made them twice in a week and everyone who has tried them is asking for more."
"2","2","this recipe has a bitter taste because of the baking soda. if you replace it with baking powder. it would taste better with coffe though."
"2","5","If I could, i'd give this recipe 10 stars. These really are the easiest and best tasting sugar cookies i have ever made. I have finally found the most amazing sugar cookie recipe ever! I will make these often. Thanks for the amazing recipe!! -Nora"
"2","5","Made these for my little sisters birthday party and they were so good. Kid and boyfriend approved! And they're easy too!! Posted a pic s well =) & I will be making these again."
"2","5","This is a good recipe for sugar cookies. Making sure that the butter is softened before mixing them is important but also making sure to take the cookies out the minute they begin to turn golden brown around the edges is also important because if they stay in the oven much longer than that they will be hard instead of chewy. They may seem like they are not done in the middle but you can tell if there are cracks in the top of the cookie they are done but will cool so that they are soft and chewy."
"2","5","These turned out great! I followed the advice of others and took the cookies out after eight minutes. I was worried that they weren't done because they did not look brown, but they turned out perfectly."
"2","5","I just tried the recipe this afternoon with my 3 year old son and it worked out perfectly!!!! I read several reviews on them before trying it and you definitely need to make sure your butter is completely softened before using. I've made others before without doing that and they were just way to crumbly. This dough was a bit crumbly but once you roll them into balls they're fine. I also took a tip from another reviewer and rolled them in white suger! Fantastic!! Next time I'm going to try adding a little almond extract like someone else suggested as it would give them a bit of an amound cookie taste. They even crackle on the top just like them. I can't say enough about this recipe, I hate hard cookies and these turned out so chewy and not hard at all.! Also I made mine a little bigger to again ensure that they weren't hard so instead of it making 4 dozen I made 3. Well worth it!"
"2","5","These are the easiest sugar cookies to make. I used margarine instead of butter and they came out wonderful. My whole family loved them."
"2","5","these are some pretty solid cooks"
"2","5","Great recipe, takes so little time to make! A+++ cookies."
"2","5","absolutely fantastic! I did however find that the mixture was too dry and crumbly and I couldnt form it into balls, but my eggs were rather small, so I added another! These baked really well, very hard to mess up this recipe!"
"2","2","HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.... I STARTED OUT ANXIOUSLY EXCITED ABOUT THESE HIGHLY RATED SUGAR COOKIES. I WAS SURE THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM. I CAREFULLY AND PRECISELY MEASURED EACH INGREDIENT AND FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. MY DOUGH WAS RUNNY, LIKE PANCAKE MIX. I THOUGHT SOMETHING MUST NOT BE RIGHT. SO I ADDED A LITTLE MORE FLOUR AND THEN STUCK IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR 20 MINUTES. STILL, THE DOUGH WAS EXTREMELY STICKY AND TOO RUNNY. SO I ADDED MORE FLOUR AND PUT BACK IN THE FRIDGE. STILL IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY. I THRE IT AWAY. THEN I TRIED THE RECIPE OFF THE BACK OF A BAKING MIX BOX. THE SAME THING HAPPENED."
"2","5","This is a GREAT chewy,easy to make delicious cookie.I use this to make THE BEST snickerdoodles too.Simply add a tablespoon of cinnemon to the sugar that you roll them in. A+++"
"2","4","The cookies will come out hard unless the butter is practically melted before hand. When you cream the butter and the sugar together it should be like a gritty icing consistancy. They take a couple minutes longer to bake than the recipe calls for too. between 8 and 12 minutes."
"2","5","It's hard to stop eating these! They seem to go faster than I can make them. Really easy to make, which I love, and almost fool proof. To make some gorgeous christmassy cookies, I rolled them in colored sugar before baking. Everyone seems to love these! For a little more special taste, I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond essence, really makes the flavours pop. Will definitely make again :) UPDATE: Made these for Christmas 2009 to give out in a gift basket to people. Everyone loved them! Just made them again this evening for a quick sweet bite after dinner, and again, they never fail to please."
"2","4","I am NOT a good baker, but even I could make these! I thought they were great, just a little bit chewy. They were very quick and easy for cookies though! Stick to the recipe and roll in sugar before baking, and they are delish!"
"2","5","I made these cookies for a thanksgiving dinner for my church, and everyone said they were GREAT!"
"2","3","I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe just because I expected something different. My dough came out dry like a shortbread so I added about 1/4 c more butter. My butter was very soft, it had sat out all day, so I don't think that was the problem.   The taste was pretty good, but I wouldn't tend to make these cookies again."
"2","5","This is the BEST sugar cookie I've ever eaten."
"2","5","Excellent and easy! I flattened mine slightly and dipped in Halloween sprinkles for our annual pumpkin carving party. Great taste and very easy to make."
"2","5","I always thought sugar cookies were hard to make... these were delicious and so easy to make..."
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I had been craving a sugar cookie for a while and went on a search for it here on the site and it's great..didn't change a thing! My husband just ate 3...okay, I just had 2. :o) Good thing I only bake 6 at a time. One left and we're both looking at each other for the last cookie! Thank you!"
"2","5","This recipe is awesome! My eleven year-old daughter found the recipe and made the cookies all by herself and I think they are now our family's favorite cookie. She used the soft Smart Balance because she couldn't find the butter, and they turned out fabulous. Yum!"
"2","5","Okay, I've seen the critiques of this recipe, but honestly? I've found nothing wrong with it. I literally pulled the butter out of the fridge and immediately started cutting it into the sugar with a fork and they came out perfect, no problem. I wouldn't find them suitable for cookie cutters, since they're kinda sticky, but outside of that: practically perfect. They come out really soft and yummy and always get raved over especially when I make a hollow in them and fill them with a lemon cake filling."
"2","5","I still a novice at baking and these turn out great and super easy. I was even surprise they turned out that well for me. I think the people whose didn't turn out right and followed the recipe to a T, the problem may have been stale ingredients or your oven. I don't think these are meant to be cookie cutter cookies (the recipe does say to roll into balls) but for those who managed to get them shaped then congrats to you. Turned out just as pictured and tasted great."
"2","5","Great Cookies!"
"2","5","My husband has been reminding me every time I make cookies, of how he loves sugar cookies [sigh]; how can it be a cookie with no chocolate in it, I wondered... however, I finally was moved to look up a sugar cookie recipe that didn't entail too much work, as I did not want to make them in the first place. These were the cookies! Loved how easy they were to mix and bake. I worried they were too floury, but the eaters said they were perfect; I used Pampered Chef's Double Strength Bourbon Vanilla extract. It imparted a wonderful flavor and aroma to these plain Janes. Unfortunately, now I have been requested to make more, so next time I think I will double this batch and freeze some."
"2","5","These cookies were super easy to make, the recipe had ingredients that I had on hand at the time, and the cookies turned out perfectly. They were nice and crisp, just the perfect amount of crispness. Just be sure not to over bake them, or they will get too hard. As soon as you see any browning around the edges, take them out! I added sugar and crystal sprinkles before they were baked, so they would stay on the cookies, and they turned out wonderfully. I will use this recipe any time I need sugar cookies!"
"2","5","what i did. is i sprinkled a little sugar on them, while they were in the oven! THEY WERE AWESOME!!"
"2","5","I didn't look at the other reviews to see if anyone else had done this, but I added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract and it was SO good. I absolutely love cookie dough and don't usually like the actual cookie. This cookie is as good as the dough! Very soft and scrumptious. Great recipe and SO easy!! Good one to make with kids. Thanks!"
"2","4","One time they were soft, the other time they turned hard. Don't know why. I baked them with M&M candies to get them to taste like the cookies in the mall. It worked but the mall cookies are still better."
"2","5","Me and my friend made this and they are ah-mazing. They're better than any store bought sugar cookies you've ever tasted. They're soft and fluffy, and not too sweet. We were making them for a neighborhood party and kids were going so we mixed sprinkles into the dough. The were so cute and delicous. Five stars!"
"2","5","great recipe, i wanted to make snickerdoodles so i made my own mixture of cinnamon sugar to roll the balls of dough in and then bake: 3T white sugar with 3tsp. cinnamon."
"2","5","These are my standard sugar cookies, I bake them all the time. They're super easy to make. Honestly, sugar cookies aren't my favorite but everyone who has these says they're amazing. I've had some problems with the dough being runny so I put in a little extra flour (however, this just might be me) and also roll the dough in cinnamon sugar before baking which gives them a little bit more flavor. An all around excellent cookie!"
"2","5","Unbelievable how delicious and easy these are. My 3 year old did the measurements so they were not exact, but the cookies were incredible. I have tried lots of sugar cookie recipes that are difficult or blah. Thanks, these are the best"
"2","4","i use only 2 cups of flour and add an extra egg. i also either roll the cookies in sugar before baking or add a cup of M&Ms to the mix mmmmm!"
"2","3","Texture was good for rolling and cutting shapes. The flavor was very plain."
"2","5","We love sugar cookies that don't need frosting to be yummy and these are the best we have had! They get 10 thumbs up from our house. :) ps--we added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to give it a little kick."
"2","1","I really trusted all the reviews that I read prior to making this recipe myself. I love to bake and am fairly good at it too but I won't be making these again. These cookies went flat and looked nothing like the picture. Maybe if the picture looked more like what I ended up with I wouldn't have spent the time, and money to make these."
"2","5","Great recipe! Extremely simple to make! I just made these an hour ago for my neighbor as a thank you for house sitting. I added a little grated lemon zest for extra flavor."
"2","5","This was my first time making sugar cookies from scratch - also my first time making cut-out cookies. This dough was great to work with, and the cookies came out tasting great! My only trouble at first was my dough seemed a bit dry, I ended up adding about 1 tbsp more butter and the problem was easily fixed."
"2","5","Easiest sugar cookie I have ever made. THe only thing I changed was that I added 1 more tsp of vanilla and they had a perfect flavor. VERY SIMPLE and QUICK to make. Almost foolproof.  Family loved them - kids had fun frosting and decorating. I will definately be using this as my basic sugar cookie recipe from now on. Thanks!"
"2","5","They were good. I did add a little extra vanilla though. I didn't have very many left after I was done baking because my husband kept eating them!"
"2","5","What a great cookie! And they are really easy to make! I iced them with the Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies by Cali recipe from this website and they were great."
"2","5","very good. only keep them in for 8 min, then they will come out soft and yummy :)"
"2","5","very good, used a cookie scoop to drop them on the pan, cooked 9 minutes. Very rich and tasty, used decorator frosting recipe from this site to top and send with the kids to school for Valentines. Thanks!"
"2","5","OMG best cookies ever  Instead of Vanilla I added Almond Extract...I have one of those cookie making pressers and the dough works wonderfully in it.  I made them for a dinner party, and everyone was too full at dinner time because they had eaten all of the cookies"
"2","5","This recipe is amazing. The cookies are so delicious. I've made it several times now and it is super easy. The first time I made them, I left out an entire stick of butter and the mixture was very crumbly. I added about three tablespoons of evaporated milk to form balls and the family loved them. The next few times I made them, I followed the recipe exactly and no one could tell a difference. So, it doesn't matter if you use one stick of butter and some milk, they will taste great. I also added some imitation butter flavoring the first time by accident. We loved the dough without even cooking it. This is by far the best cookie recipe I've every tried from Allrecipes.com.  Has anyone tried to make a chocolate version? I would love to know what you did, but on the other hand I don't want to mess up a really great recipe. Let me know if anyone tries it with chocolate. I haven't done it yet, but that's my next step."
"2","5","Super easy, excellent sugar cookies. You can make nice cut out cookies if you refrigerate the dough for a few hours. Take care not to bake too long if you roll out the dough or the cookies become overly crisp."
"2","5","YUMMY!!!! every one raved about how good they were. didnt need to change a thing. this is the perfect sugar cookie recipe. I put luscious buttercream icing (from this site) on top.they didnt last long in my house.Thank you for this awesome recipe."
"2","3","I had high hopes for this recipe given the numerous glowing reviews, however after having just made them exactly according to recipe the best I can say about these cookies is they are ok. I bake frequently with near 100% success with each recipe I try, but these were just not very good and not very flavorful. My husband said they were very 'eggy' and he's right. Even though there is just 1 egg in the recipe, the only flavor you can taste in this cookie is that of egg. The dough was nice to work with, though, and they aren't terrible, so I that's why I gave them 3 stars. I won't be making this one again, however. Thanks anyway."
"2","5","Yum! Fasty, easy cookie to make even with the help of my 3 & 5 year-old boys. Rolled the dough in cinnamon sugar and came out perfect. Definitely bake for only 8 minutes for soft cookies!"
"2","3","I tried making these cookies 3 times. The first time they were melted and burnt and were too buttery. The second time, it was rock hard. The third time they actually looked like cookies but tasted horrible. All three times it tasted like the smell of the flour... maybe I'll try again with another brand of flour instead of Gold Medal flour..."
"2","5","These are perfect, it's true. I like to make mine with half the butter, and they still turn out amazingly! Happy baking!"
"2","5","Very good cookie. Not good for cutouts but very flavorful."
"2","5","My daughter and I just made these cookies...by far the easiest and best sugar cookies I've ever made!! We rolled them into balls and dipped them in colored sugar-it worked great! I'll be happy to make these every year! Thank you!"
"2","5","Great recipe, delicious simple cookies! Such an easy recipe to follow and not time consuming at all. Be sure to blend ingredients thoroughly and take cookies out of the oven at 8 minutes unless you like them crispy. I prefer chewy. I already put this one in my recipe book because I Will be making them again soon! Thanks!"
"2","4","I put the dough in the fridge for a little while. I had no problem rolling it out, it didn't stick to my rolling pin at all, which was nice. The cookies turned out a nice golden color. However I don't know if I did something wrong but they seemed a little crunchy to me. Maybe thats how they are suppose to be lol."
"2","5","Delicious and easy recipe. After reading the other reviews, I didn't bother trying shapes because the other reviewers said the cookies spread too much (and they do), so I just followed the directions, made round cookies and they came out delicious. I made them plain, topped them with colored sugar, crushed candy canes and Hershey's kisses and they all were very good. Just make sure if you use the kisses, that you push them into the center of the cookie enough, otherwise, they'll be off center once the cookie bakes (and spreads). Thanks for the recipe :-)"
"2","5","Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I've been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe for a long time. This one is perfect. The dough is so easy to work with. I added 1/2 tsp. extra vanilla, but it was just small addition to make the recipe superb. Look no further! I still have to try chilling it to make shapes but I'm sure it'll work just fine."
"2","5","My husband loves sugar cookies, but Im not a big fan. But when i tasted these, i fell in love!!! I took a batch to a Christmas party and with all the other elaborate desserts, those cookies were the most raved about! I had all the women asking me for the recipe. They're nice and soft, and easier than traditional rolled version. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 lt margarine because its all i had. Also added 1/2 tsp extra vanilla, cooked in oven 8.5 min. Wonderful!!!!"
"2","5","I made these today and they turned out great! One batch was taken out at 8 minutes, and the other at 9 minutes. For me, 9 minutes worked out better. I also added more vanilla as others had suggested (1 1/2 tsp vs 1 tsp), and they were a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll just follow the recipe."
"2","4","I started this recipe unprepared...it's a common problem for me. I realized after combining the wet ingredients that I didn't have any baking soda. I ended up using 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder to try and 'fake it'. I used a small scooper to ball my dough which worked well. The main problem I had with these cookies is that they just didn't spread out on the pan at all. I ended up with little 'puffs' instead of flattened cookies. I did smash one pan of dough balls down but I found that I prefered the look of the 'puffs'. I also doubled the vanilla as some people had said, and I added a pinch of salt. I was pretty impressed with these cookies even though I didn't follow the recipe to a T and I was lacking in ingredients. I actually wrote down my changes because I may want to make them 'wrong' again. TASTY!"
"2","4","These were definitely easy, and pretty good but unless you use real unsalted butter the flavor is a little off. Not the best I've ever made."
"2","5","This is hands down the best and easiest sugar cookie I've ever made. (Good enough that it prompted me to write my first ever review!) I'm working on my 3rd batch for the night...Christmas gift baking. Tips: Don't dig your measuring cup into the flour...gently spoon the flour into the cup (a gravy ladle works great for this) and although the dough is truly easy to work with, even straight from the mixer, it's even easier to work with if you refrigerate it for an hour or so first. I coated half of mine in regular sugar and the other half in cinnamon sugar...just for a little variation in my cookie boxes."
"2","5","pure decadent velvety goodness!! My guests were awestruck by the creamy delectables and they ate them all."
"2","1","They turned out so thin and didn't taste very good. I won't use this recipe again"
"2","5","WOW! These sugar cookies are WONDERFUL! The only fall backs are that the dough is quite crumbly and a little bit difficult to work with and they spread quite a bit. A round cookie cutter that is 3' in diameter made a cookie that was 4' in diameter. But it's ok because they are REALLY GOOD. 7 minutes in my oven was the perfect cooking time and they came out so soft. Thanks for such a good recipe! I will for sure make them again and again!"
"2","5","this is a great recipe this is coming from a thirteen year old girl who has absolutely no cooking experience i love the way the cookie dough is they remind me of my grandmas house -yes theyre that good"
"2","5","These cookies are delicious! They're simple and quick to bake. One suggestion: grease your cookie sheet (even though it says not to). Mine stuck a little. I will definitely use this recipe again."
"2","5","Sooo good! I added some m&ms to some, cinnamon sugar on others! Def would recommend to any baker! SO easy too..8 minutes is the perfect cook time!!!"
"2","5","Yummy. This is also a great project to do with kids. Have them add 1-2 Drops of food coloring for some extra colorful cookies!"
"2","5","Deeeelicious. The reviews helped... They only took about 6 - 7 minutes. Super easy prep. I didn't have to squash them, they flattened out just fine on their own. Possibly the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever used!"
"2","5","Hands down the best and easiest sugar cookie recipe ever! It doesn't require chilling to roll or shape. Almost everyone I have made them for asks for the recipe."
"2","5","Easy - delicious!! The other reviews helped, I only baked for 8 minutes. NOTE: I ran out of vanilla, so I used Almond extract - they came out delicious and didn't taste too strong of almond"
"2","5","Finally found a sugar cookie recipe that turns out like the plain sugar cookies you find in the grocery stores. These were so soft and delicious I almost ate them all. I did find that you have to press the cookie dough balls a little flat before you bake them so they spread correctly, but other than that they were perfect. I rolled them in black and orange sugar for halloween. I plan to use red and green for the upcoming holiday."
"2","3","They only needed about 6 minutes in my oven and i had to make about 1 1/2 (or slightly larger) teaspoon size balls so they didn't burn and get crunchy. Once I changed things up a bit the next batch came out better : ) yummy!"
"2","5","Great once I got the hang of making sugar cookies (first time trying them!). I did find that I had to add a bit more butter though. Best tip is to make sure to watch them like a hawk and get them out of the oven before they start to brown. If they go brown they lose their flavour (speaking from experience!)."
"2","5","Great, simple recipe! Love it!"
"2","5","These are hands down the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted. I wish I could find a roll-out dough this tasty, but these do look and taste extra yummy with a little frosting and some sprinkles."
"2","5","Hands down the best sugary butter cookie! They are soft and tender. Will definitely make this a staple in my recipe box!"
"2","5","The recipe is easy to follow and makes Delicious cookies which is crisp outside & soft & chewy inside..   take out 7-8 Minutes as the prior recipes.. Thank you people...  This is the First Time I am making cookie...& they have come out fabulous. I used 1/2 Margarine & 3/4 Cup butter & used 2 TSP vanilla..  & Dashed choclate chips on few cookies.  Regards Reetu"
"2","5","These are AMAZING!! Made these with my two year old. We frosted them with cream cheese frosting and topped with orange and black sprinkles for Halloween. Will make these again and again!"
"2","5","Simple and easy. Just don't overbake to get moist cookies. Thanks!"
"2","5","Very quick and easy recip that came out just delicious! I did add a smidge more vanilla and dressed with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon."
"2","2","I had high expectations for these cookies after reading the positively glowing reviews. And I love sugar cookies. But these were really lacking. Just very plain and they spread way out when cooking so they're ultra thin. First batch I made on un-greased cookie sheets as called for and even after waiting the suggested two minutes, they stuck so badly that several were demolished while trying to get them from the sheet to the cooling rack. I switched to my well-seasoned baking stone for subsequent batches and then at least they didn't stick as much. But the resulting cookie either way was just...blah."
"2","5","These cookies really are the best sugar cookies I have ever had."
"2","5","Sooo easy and so good. This is a regular in our house. I bake them for exactly 9 minutes on an air bake cookie sheet. Remove them immediately to cool slightly. Yum yum!"
"2","5","These were so easy to make. I generally bake bread and cakes in my tiny college apartment, so it's nice to have something that's so easy!  I baked them for exactly 8 minutes and they were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I had to add about 2 tbs of water to the dough, because it was a bit crumbly."
"2","3","I was really excited when i found this recipe. I finally tried the recipe. I followed each step and the cookies turn out hard and NOT Flat. I will give the recipe 3 stars for easiness and quickness, but nothing else"
"2","5","I was looking for a simple recipe to take to youth group... this is great because I had everything already. Here's a hint, if the dough is crumbly, kneed it with your hands. it melts the butter and makes it easier to work with. Loved it tho!"
"2","5","Delicious and easy...stick the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes before you roll the dough to make it a little easier."
"2","4","I really liked these cookies although I've never been a huge fan of sugar cookies myself. They were nice and crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside and smell heavenly while baking. The dough seemed a touch dry and for moister cookies I would take away some flour and cook for only 7-8 minutes exactly. But great cookies all around!"
"2","5","This is a wonderful recipe! Very easy and we all loved the cookies!"
"2","4","The cookies turned out very good. The dough spreads out about 1 in from a teaspoon size. I also baked them a little longer, as suggested, however, they werent crispy unless I baked them at 12-14 min. Not too sweet and quite chewy, they should turn out to a pale gold, very slightly browned at the bottom. The dough sticks to itself nicely and is relatively easy to handle. The cookies don't require icing, but it would enhance them nicely."
"2","5","These are great especially when you bake them for longer, They get crunchy and are great with hot cup of coffee. My future mother in law can't get enough!"
"2","5","These cookies are soft and delicious. I will make these often!"
"2","3","i never had cooked anything with so much sugar"
"2","5","This recipe is easy to make, and fun. Me and my kids had fun making these cookies. Only thing that I did different is add 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon per batch made, and we added sprinkles. MMMM mmmm goood"
"2","4","Awesome cookies! I first tried these last month - have made 4 batches so far & have shared the recipe with 2 sisters-in-law! First batch, I was out of vanilla, so used almond extract. Really good. :)  Update-2014: I have made these cookies sooo many times.... They are THE BEST sugar cookies!  Yummy; wonderful texture; so pretty; so easy. I love that they don't need to be chilled!  I usually use 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup butter-flavor Crisco. I like my cookies on the small side, so I use a teaspoon for a barely-rounded blob of dough, then roll into a ball. I still can't believe how beautifully round they are when they come out of the oven!  As far as being crumbly, as some reviewers have written: Yes, they will be crumbly until you've thoroughly incorporated all of the flour. Thank you, Stephanie, for an amazing cookie! :)"
"2","5","Excellent soft sugar cookie... I will make these again and again!"
"2","5","This is the perfect sugar cookie recipe! I agree that taking them out 2 minutes early improves the chewiness...I will use this recipe for years to come!!"
"2","5","I cannot cook for beans, I love to do it though and it seems I never get the recipe right even if I follow it to a 'T' I am proud to say, I just tried these and got it right! They are delicious and were so easy to make. I will use this recipe from now on. I even iced them and they came out better than I expected."
"2","4","The cookies turned out great. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the dough was very sticky and difficult to roll into balls. Otherwise, great recipe!"
"2","5","These were so easy! I loved not having to put the dough in the fridge or anything to slow me down. They were sooo tasty too! My family snarfed them down right away."
"2","5","This was so easy to make and they turned out GREAT!!! I even halved the recipe and it still was excellent. I recommend these for anyone who doesn't have time to chill the dough. I made these so quickly!!"
"2","5","these cookies are excellent! i had only about half a teaspoon vanilla extract, so i sprinkled in some nutmeg--gave the cookies the perfect flavor. in fact, i recommend adding nutmeg to this recipe as a standard. just delicious!"
"2","5","I was a little scared after I got this mixed up. It was such a dense dough, that I was afraid the cookies would be too dry. But after rolling them in sugar before baking, thay were the best sugar cookie I've ever made. So sweet and buttery!!! FANTASTIC!!!!"
"2","5","This is a GREAT recipe! I added a little salt (maybe 1/2 t.) and they were wonderful!"
"2","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made. So quick and easy to make! Everyone has loved them and asked for the recipe! Thanks!"
"2","3","These cookies were easy to mix....however, when they were baked they became a little brickish..."
"2","5","Amazingly soft, chewy & delicious! And so quick & easy! Good for someone who doesn't want to spend hours in the kitchen (yet appears like they have)!"
"2","5","I love making these cookies! I don't usually like sugar cookies because they get so hard and have little taste. These cookies are stay soft, buttery, and absolutely delicious! I also love this recipe because you will most likely have these ingredients in the house already! Thank you!"
"2","5","I've made these cookies before, and they were amazing. They are soft, sugary and easy to make. I would highly recommend this recipe to others."
"2","5","These cookies were delicious! I made them exactly as the recipe said, except I added an extra tsp. of vanilla. I am a horrible cook and can mess up ANYTHING. Gave them to my neighbors for Christmas with red and green sugar on top. They all loved them..."
"2","1","I made these cookies exactly as this recipe specifies. My cookies came out in a weird consistency and were unable to eat."
"2","5","This was the most easy recipe I could find and glad that I did. They are delicious!! I iced the toppings with cake frosting and dipped in to red & green sugar sprinkles."
"2","5","Soooo simple and sooooo DELICIOUS! This will absolutely go in my recipe book to make again and again."
"2","2","ehh..not so good. made them exactly to the recipe and even tried coating them in sugar. quite bland."
"2","5","These cookies are the BEST! My family loves them and allways asks for more!"
"2","5","Great Sugar Cookie Recipe and very Easy. I did bake them at 350 degrees F instead of 375. They turned out perfect!"
"2","5","A great sugar cookie recipe. I have made these for school bake sales and parties - have been asked to make them again and again. I use 2 eggs and chill the dough in the fridge for ~ 1 hour - makes GREAT cut outs!"
"2","5","Made as part of my christmas cookies. Boyfriend said best sugar cookie he has ever had. Crispy edges and chewy centers. Thanks for the great recipe."
"2","4","I just finished baking these and they turned out great i was very tempted into letting them bake longer than the baking time stated because from what it seemed they didnt look done, but i resited and i am very glad i did cause they browned just perfect on the bottom. 4stars only because this is the first ive tried so i have nothing really to compare them too. But overall a great sugar cookie!!!"
"2","5","These cookies are extremely delicious and chewy. Especially in the middle. My family thought that it was a hit and I am about to go make them."
"2","5","Very good sugar cookies. Mine won't spread during baking, so i ended up pushing down each one of them in my oven. Definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","Fantastic! I used an egg replacer and Nocoa margerine to make these vegan. I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top before baking. Great cookie. I will make this again!"
"2","5","This was a very good recipe. I decided to make it because my brother said I can't cook, especilly sugar cookies. I found this recipe and decided to make it. eveyone who ate a cookie including my self was blown away. for easy and quick this recipe is, it sure is good."
"2","5","This is an easy, delicious sugar cookies. Best part is I don't have to make a trip to the supermarket..."
"2","5","Excellent!!Soft Soft Soft!"
"2","5","children loved making and eating them, quick and easy as well as yummy. When they came out the oven we put a chocolate button on the top. mmmmmmmm"
"2","3","These did NOT work for me. I must have done something wrong, because the dough was clumpy. Did not work for using cutouts like I intended. Dough was tasteless. Sorry I will keep looking."
"2","5","These were really tastey, nice and buttery,and moist. I found that they need to bake in the oven a bit longer, but that could be because I make my cookies a bit large sometimes:). I will definitely make these again!"
"2","3","I found these cookies to be hard."
"2","4","This is a good recipe. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I don't really think they're 'sugar cookies.' I would call them snickerdoodles. I was looking for a real Valentines, roll-out-and-use-cookies-cutters recipe. They're great snickerdoodles, though!"
"2","1","This recipe was tastless, crumbly and did not flatten out. To save the dough, I added oil and lemon juice and reworked it, it had to be flattened out slightly. Also, the 375 oven temp was to high, so I tried 350. I wont use this recipe again.."
"2","5","These were the easiest cookies I've ever made. I made these for a baby shower, so I dyed the dough pink (I did add the extra egg as recommended). I also added a half tsp. of almond extract (secret ingredient in all my sugar/butter/choc chip cookes) in addition to the vanilla. Next time I'll use more almond, but they turned out beautifully. I also didn't want to take the time to roll them, as the dough was quite sticky, so I used a small pampered chef scoop to make the dough balls and it was just the right size. I will be making these often."
"2","5","These are SO good! After reading other revies, I used the two eggs and rolled in cinnamon/sugar. Plus I also added cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and orange food coloring to the batter to make them 'harvest cookies'. They turned out great and I couldn't keep my family out of the cookie jar! This one's a keeper!!!"
"2","5","A BIG HIT! After looking at SOOOO many cookie recipes I went for one that I had the ingredients for and I'm so glad I went with this one. Excellent COOKIE! I went with 2 cups of sugar, and 2 eggs. They were so good I gave some to my neighbor for bragging!"
"2","5","these cookies are delicious this is one of my favorite cookies to bake. i did add an extra egg and rolled the dough in sugar."
"2","5","These are the new fav in our house. My kids love them because they are soooo good. I love them because they are soooo easy."
"2","5","My daughter made these yesterday, and they were outstanding. Sugar cookies always seem a tad boring to me, but I loved these crunchy, tasty cookies. She halved the recipe, but used two eggs."
"2","5","awesome. finally a sugar cookie recipe that gives both great flavour and a soft chewy texture. i have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time...a must try!"
"2","5","These cookies were quick and delicious."
"2","5","these cookies taste great. they flattened out more than i would have liked, but the actual flavor is one of the best i've tasted in a sugar cookie."
"2","5","Wonderful cookies!!! I did add some almond extract instead of the vanilla because I rarely get the chance to use it. Totally yummy! I am surprised any cookies even made it to the oven. :)"
"2","5","this recipe is awesome! the trick though, if you're having trouble with the dough being too stiff or the dough not flattening, might be the way you pack the flour. don't pack it in too much when preparing the recipe. just lightly spoon into measuring cup and even off the top with a knife. it really helped me and it turned out great so i hope it helps!!"
"2","5","Great cookies. Bake for only 8-9 minutes. They may not look done, but they stay chewy this way. I added a bit more vanilla and some lemon for some more flavor. The dough is definitely a bit difficult to handle, not the best for cutouts. Roll the single cookie balls in your hands to make them more managable."
"2","5","Tasty. Took probably three minutes longer than it says,depending on how big your cookies are. Refigerated the dough first for 1/2 the recipes and froze the other 1/2. Some I left plain,and let my 9 year old decorate with a frosting and sprinkles or with colored sugar(the colored sugar he put on right before sticking them in the oven)."
"2","2","too soft"
"2","5","This recipe was a little too dry/sticky. I had a hard time getting them to stay together. otherwise, this cookierecipe was very good."
"2","5","Cook until they just *start* to brown (almost white) and they will melt in your mouth. I over browned some of mine maybe 1-2 minutes and the bottom was burnt."
"2","5","OK these cookies are the bomb!!! They were so easy. Me and my 6 year old niece made them together and they are delicious not to mention so easy. I also used lemon flavoring on about half the dough instead the vanilla flavor. Turned out delicious!!!"
"2","5","There were fun to make! Sugar cookies can be messy, but these were easy to work with. I rolled them into a big ball, flattened slightly, and then used a shamrock cookie cutter! They were beautiful! I also added green food coloring and green sugar on top! HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY!"
"2","5","Fantastic sugar cookie recipe. I wanted thinner, crispier sugar cookies so I made the following changes for mine. Scaled to 12 servings. Added an extra tablespoon sugar. Only used egg whites. Baked for an extra 2 minutes. It worked. They came out nice and crispy. They kind of taste like ice cream cones. Excellent cookies."
"2","5","I made this in in a toaster oven in Taiwan with a bunch of kids who don't speak english and who had never tried baked cookies before. It was so easy and they loved it and nobody could stop munching them. The texture is chewy and the cookies taste good even without toping."
"2","1","Im starting to think that I'm not a baker because these were hard like a brick they didn't even flaten out. I ended up going out to get chistmas cookies at the store."
"2","5","These were great! Followed recipe exactly, so easy to make and tasted good. Thanks!"
"2","4","I halved this recipe and used margarine the 1st two times I made this and it turned out very good. The next time , I used butter and the batter was TOO TOO thick and I couldn't control the shape. I did like the cookies the first 2 times though, quick and easy."
"2","5","No Need To Write A Book ! These Cookies Are Awesome : )"
"2","5","My husband prefers chocolate chip cookies, but i didn't have all the ingredients, so i decided to try these sugar cookies. They were so easy, and i had all the ingredients at home. they turned out perfect! My husband even loved them and said i should make them again."
"2","2","We haven't even had a chance to try these yet, so perhaps my opionion could change. As of now, however, I'm not very impressed. I followed the directions exactly as listed and the 'dough' turned out like sand is the best way to describe it. We still tried shaping it into balls to see if we could salvage the ingredients we had put into it but most of them just crumbled on the pan, you couldn't even form them into a ball. I've made sugar cookies before (although it was a LONG time ago) but I don't remember the 'dough' being like this. I'll keep looking."
"2","5","OH MY! These are wonderful, very yummy I have never tasted a sugar cookie this good and is so easy to make. All the ingredents are common so I didn't have to make a special trip to the store. Wow!!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","AAAA++++ Perfect recipe..Easy also. Tried so many sugar recipes and couldn't find the right one until now!!! Thanks its a keeper"
"2","5","Fantastic cookies! I didn't change a thing about the recipe and took these into work for the a holiday treat and everyone loved them! Thanks!"
"2","5","This recipe was great, very easy to do and the cookies taste wonderful. The only thing I changed was the oven temp down to 350 degrees and baked for 2 minutes longer, I have an older gas stove. Will definately make again. A++++"
"2","5","Very easy and tasty. Taste like the cookies you get at the bakery. Even better with frosting."
"2","5","I have been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe for years. This was the BEST! and the EASIEST. If you like a soft and moist sugar cookie this is it."
"2","5","This is a great recipe. I did follow some of the others suggestions and lowered the oven temp to 340 degrees F and I baked them for 16 min exactly. Perfect crunch on the outside with nice and soft on the inside. My dough did look very dry, so I added 3 teaspoons of milk and kneaded it for a bit with my hands. Great recipe, really good cookie. My youngest daughter (10) and I are still baking them. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","These were excellent! I put frosting on them and they were a big hit. Easy to make and bursting with flavour!"
"2","3","I should have read the reviews first! The dough was so dry I couldn't even use it all, even after chilling. Some of the cookies turned out flat, others like lumps. They tasted fine but I won't use this recipe again."
"2","5","Very good recipe! I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a splash of extra vanilla and also made sure not to overbake them (unfortunately, my first batch was a little underbaked though!). They were a huge hit at my office's holiday party and I've been asked for the recipe by several coworkers. I iced them with the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe from this site (but used butter instead of shortening). Will definitely make these again!"
"2","4","First cookies I've made in a long time that didn't come out totally flat. These are tasty and not too sweet. My husband said they 'look like cookies from the supermarket.' I topped mine with star-shaped sprinkles."
"2","4","Very easy, cripsy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Took longer to cook than recipe advised, but I'm sure that's the fault of my cooker!"
"2","4","This recipe was very simple but made the best cookies...crispy on the outside chewy on the inside...after reading the reviews I made one batch and flattened them on the cookie sheet and I made one batch and just left them in balls there wasn't any difference in my cookies they both looked just like the picture...on my second batch I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar...reminded me of snickerdoodles...I wish I knew how to make them a little thicker they are really quite thin maybe next time I will use shortening instead of butter...anyway they are so good, very hard, probably impossible to eat just one!"
"2","4","I followed the recipe exactly, and just had one problem with it. Putting rounded teaspoonfuls on the cookie sheets does not work. The cookies did not spread out at ALL, so what I was left with was tiny little balls of baked sugar cookie mix. For the next batch, I used a much larger amount of dough and flattened them out so they were in the shape of a cookie even before baking. This worked like a charm. Other than that, the recipe itself makes wonderful cookies! They turn out perfectly- they cook evenly, look good enough for company, taste great, and absolutely NO sticking to the pan or falling apart!!"
"2","5","I was a little skeptical at first but, this turned out to be a great cookie recipe. I ended up adding an extra tbsp of shortening, 1/2 cp of milk and leftover halloween mimi-m&m's. My boyfriend and I love them. When asked how many stars I should give he answered, 'seven!'"
"2","5","This recipe is the best sugar cookie I've ever made. These cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I always add a 3/4 tsp cream of tarter to every sugar cookie recipe but I'm sure these cookies are great without it. I will try without next time and there will be a next time. Delicious!"
"2","5","Perfect sugar cookies! Nice and chewy, perfect for frosting and decorating!"
"2","5","I love sugar cookies and these are fabulous! Perfect sugar cookie!!! I love these. Very easy to make. Sometimes I sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top."
"2","4","These are very good! I used real butter and they turned out just a little richer than I would have liked. Will try next time with margarine to see which is better. Mine looked just like in the picture :)"
"2","4","This can be a great recipe with a few changes. I made this a few times following the recipe exact, didn't care for it as much as others, until I tweaked it a bight. Trust me a great differece on taste and looks. Make a slight heap on the flour measurements, don't make it level. Use 2 tsp. of vanilla, add 1/3 cup of packed brown sugar, roll in white sugar & little brown sugar,press down cross ways on balls when you place them on cookie sheet,Do Not excessed the 10 minutes or they will be so hard. I use 9 min."
"2","5","Easy and tasty!"
"2","2","These were OK. We found them to be rather bland and uneventful. I rolled them in sugar and that just burned the bottoms of them. I won't be making these again. They were, however easy to make... maybe if I dressed them up more (ie: candy or something) they would have turned out better."
"2","5","Excellent cookies! Wonderful! I loved them. I am one of those people (now, don't laugh) who is looking for the perfect sugar cookie recipe. This is almost it. I can't say that it is THE recipe yet, because I need to try some more still, but this is really truly a wonderful recipe. Right after they came out of the oven I flattened them a little, because that is how I like my cookies. I don't like the round kind of cookies :). They had a cracked appearance on top, and were chewy. Yum! Thanks, Stephanie! I think I like these better than the Blue Ribbon Sugar Cookies."
"2","5","This is the 2nd recipe I tried tonight due to failure of the first. I doubled the vanilla and added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar for fear that these would be as tastless as the first recipe. I was unbelievably happy with the out come of these cookies! I also rolled the balls in colored sugar prior to baking and again was extremely pleased with the recipe! Better than any store bought sugar cookies I have ever had! Thank you for sharing!!! Deanna"
"2","5","These cookies came out great! Perfect taste, perfect shape. They were not chewy enough, a bit more crispy than I like, but that's probably because I left them in the oven longer than I was supposed to. I'm going to try this again, with a shorter amount of time in the oven."
"2","5","I picked this recipe over the other sugar cookie recipes because my husband was in the mood to cook. These looked easy enough for him to make and we had all the ingredients on hand so he went at it. These were excellent. I was very surprised that my husband made these. I asked him if he was sure didn't cheat and pick these up at the bakery. Thanks so much or sharing Stephanie."
"2","5","These cookies came out FABULOUS! I also made a decorator frosting I found on this site to top them off. I made them for my best friend because she loves those store bought sugar cookies and I thought this would be a nice change. So who won her over with store bought versus homemade? Homemade of course!"
"2","5","Yummy!"
"2","5","These were really good cookies. Took them out of the oven after 8 minutes and they were perfect...soft and chewy. My whole family raved about them. Thanks!"
"2","5","I love sugar cookies but don't have the time to fuss with all the details. This recipe taste great and was very easy to make. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"2","5","This is a VERY wonderful cookie, I have read alot of the reviews for this recipe as I was desperate and NEEDED a good recipe..... I found it in this one... I thank you... I did not find a thing wrong with this recipe....but then again I did not change anything with it... thanks again..."
"2","4","This was a nice, easy dough to make. They were a little too sweet for my taste, so next time I will reduce the sugar, especially when using sugars to decorate. The cinammon sugar ones were delicious. I also used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of margerine .. they were slightly oily and I think I would also reduce the fat. I experimented with the last dozen by adding a few drops of green food coloring, but not totally mixing it in. The result? Marbled green cookies! You can literally make a whole platter of these cookies and have each one look different. Next time, think I will try rolling in nuts. I got close to 6 dozen cookies with this recipe. Very good .. it's going in my recipe box."
"2","5","These cookies are WONDERFUL!!!! I've never made sugar cookies before and these are exactly what I was wanting! I made them before my husband got home and I was afraid I was going to eat them all before he got home and could eat one!! YUM!!"
"2","4","Great recipe. I had to add a bit more butter because my dough was dry and crumbly. These are not too sweet - so perfect for adding decorative icings."
"2","5","the dough seemed a little dry but they turned out great."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe for sugar cookies. Easy to make even easier to eat. A definite keeper!"
"2","5","This was a really easy and quick recipe. I decided to make a thin cookie since even the thicker ones I made were crisp. I made the dough into balls and then pressed them out flat with my fingers instead of trying to roll and cut them out. I baked them for 7 minutes. The technique worked well and everyone raved over them! Great recipe!"
"2","2","I was really disappointed with this recipe. They're too sweet, anything more intricate than a christmas tree puffs up until it is unrecognizable. They're too buttery and taste nothing like sugar cookies!"
"2","5","Very easy and taste great. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup milk, still taste great. I also baked a little longer, so these cookies turned out crispy outside and soft inside."
"1","5","I doubled the recipe and had so many delicious cookies! I made the dough one day, refrigerated it, then baked cookies the next day. Thank you for the easy recipe!!"
"1","5","I loved these cookies ! ! ! Not only did I love them but my spouse went crazy for them claiming they tasted 100 x better than the package mixes . We even put chocolate chips in them as well .   The only thing I changed in the recipe was I added a full teaspoon of baking soda and powder and added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract instead of 1 . That's it !  Amazing recipe ! Definetly saving this !"
"1","5","added food coloring 1/2 tbs of baking soda 4 tbs baking powder 2 cups of sugar , came out nice and soft ."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious. Added a touch of cinnamon to change it up just a bit."
"1","5","I made this into a cookie cake and it turned out AMAZING! I think it cooked about 12 minutes at 350, until slightly golden. Topped it with a cool whip/cream cheese mixture, strawberries and blueberries. Will use again for sure. :)"
"1","5","misread the recipe... made 4 dozen into 12... i know have cookie muffins..."
"1","5","Ok so as I was making these cookies I accidentally added 1tsp of peppermint extract instead of vanilla & thought 'Oh man how can I save this dough?' I decided to add 2/3 cup of coco powder & 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract & wahh-lahh. Best Chocolate Peppermint Cookies ever!  (and if you want to get cute) *Roll the refrigerated dough into 1inch balls & roll through powdered sugar just before baking & just like that CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINT CRINKLE COOKIES! *Best baking mistake I ever made :)  *Super easy to make & I followed tips & used completely mushy softened butter-musta' worked cause they are DELICIOUS."
"1","5","These are great for a easy and fast sugar. I always sprinkle with a course sugar on top."
"1","5","My favorite sugar cookie recipe. I cook these all the time and everyone always comes back for more! I feel as is they are lacking a little but with an added teaspoon of almond extract these cookies become better than ever! I have never had a problem with these cookies but you must make sure you cream the butter and sugar together before adding the dry ingredients and make sure your butter is room temperature before mixing otherwise it will not mix together properly."
"1","5","Perfect every time. A little crunch when you bite in and a soft center. I'm not a fan of sugar cookies, but I love these."
"1","5","Great cookies . If you follow the ingredients step by step they will be perfect . What I did different is when it asked for a a cup of butter I put a stick of unsalted and a stick of salted they were so buttery tasting . And a tablespoon of vanilla. They are so good . You can sell them"
"1","5","Easy and so good Yummy!!!! Make a big Bach ."
"1","1","Cookie mixture turned out to be nothing but crumbs!"
"1","5","If you enjoy the Pillsbury slice & bake cookies, you will love these, plus you get more for your money and KNOW what's going into them! I did use salted butter and made them 3 Xs the suggested 1 tsp. size (spaced out on cookie sheet, adding an extra 10 minutes)but, otherwise, followed it to the letter & they turned out perfectly! Will be returning to this recipe for sure :)I will likely double the vanilla though, as other reviewers suggested."
"1","1","The cookies turned into 'butter'. I would not recemened this recipe or do it again."
"1","5","Best tasting sugar cookies ever!!! I slightly modified the recipe. I used half a teaspoon of baking soda instead one teaspoon and 2 teaspoons of Vanilla instead of one."
"1","5","I made these for work and everyone loved them! I use the canned white Betty Crocker Whipped frosting on them with sprinkles."
"1","5","they are so good :)"
"1","4","They came out great !!!!! The only downfall was they were very thin and hard. I recommend using a recipe wirh cornstarch if you want thicker, fluffier cookies. Other than that they were delicious!!!!!"
"1","5","I love it! Cookies turned out great! I used a tad bit less flour. :)"
"1","2","The cookies came out terrible and I followed the directions exactly."
"1","5","The cookies came out perfect... Fluffy, buttery, yummy! I mixed the batter by hand only because I don't have an electric mixer. I only used a cup of sugar just to cut down on the calories, and the cookies still came out great. I've used this recipe twice and will use it again."
"1","5","LOVE this easy, perfect recipe! I read the other reviews and used almost melted butter and only baked the cookies about 8 minutes, or just until they looked a little under done and hadn't browned at all. Perfect outside, chewy inside. I added green food dye and shamrock sprinkles for St. Patricks day, it didn't change the outcome at all."
"1","1","All I taste is butter."
"1","5","My whole family loved it! I took the advice of doubling the vanilla for flavor and the butter soft ness will make or break these bad boys 100%. But super quick, super easy, and super yummy :) and that's coming from a pregnant mommy ;)."
"1","3","these cookies taste really good, but they are so hard. or dense. definitely not soft or chewy. i followed the recipe exactly, and didnt overcook. the bottoms are barely browned. not sure where i went wrong. oh well. they are now sharing a ziploc with a couple slices of bread to hopefully soften them up ;)"
"1","5","came out perfect! couldnt stay out of the cookie dough! loved it. fast and easy! love it!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe exactly as written! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out. To anyone that couldn't get this right- shake your head!"
"1","5","my family loved them!!! Perfect recipe!!!"
"1","5","PERFECT. Well, I did add a pinch of salt as others suggested, otherwise followed instructions. Take it out at 8-9 minutes for delicious chewiness. BTW, my dough started out crumbly. I just hand-kneaded it well and that warmed the butter in the dough perfectly. I've tried other chewy no-refrigerated recipes from food network, something was off. I tried Alton Brown's recipe, and those were sub-par. THIS IS THE BEST and super easy. Thank you!!"
"1","5","We decided to make cookies today since we were home for a snow day. I made these with my seven year old. The recipe is very basic and was easy enough for her to do most of the work herself with just a little help from me. The whole house smelled wonderful and the taste did not disappoint! This one is a keeper for sure! Thanks so much for sharing, we will be using this again and again!"
"1","5","This is my go to sugar cookie recipe. I bet I've made it about a half a dozen times now at least. It never fails!"
"1","5","This recipe was a hit! I don't have kids but my man does and we were trying to find a way to break the ice when I was going to meet them for the first time. They are 8 and 4 and I decided to do sugar cookies. Quick, easy, fool-proof and a hit! :) I would recommend with no changes to the recipe. By the way...my man....well, they were a hit with him too! ;))))"
"1","5","This was my first time making cookies from scratch and at first I was really nervous that they might not come out well. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out DELICIOUS! I used a star shaped cookie cutter and sprinkled some sugar on top and they looked adorable and tasted great!"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe - so easy and so tasty! After 5 mins of baking, we put a chocolate chip on top of some and sprinkles on others and sprinkled a dash of salt so the added sugar from the chocolate and sprinkles wouldn't overwhelm. So good."
"1","4","I thought it was a easy fast recipe but it did not call for salt which is odd, you should almost always put in sweet food and they speed out with I thought was weird so maybe just put baking soda instead of baking powder. Other than that it was very good!"
"1","5","I baked these yesterday and they were delicious and easy to make. I just added some sprinkles to them to make them for Valentines Day. You definitely have to keep them on the cookie sheet for at least 5 or 10 seconds before taking them off of the cookie sheet. The batter was just crumbly when I was getting to the bottom of my bowl, so I just grabbed it and molded it. I didn't roll it into balls, I used an ice cream scoop and they came out just great. They were a hit at home and at the office."
"1","5","It was delicious! Make sure to stick to the recommended baking time and do not exceed. They should not actually be brown. They'll harden within 5 min after being taken out if the oven."
"1","5","This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever made. Delicious!"
"1","4","Great recipe.! My kids loved it.!!!"
"1","5","I tried this today with red food coloring for a tester for my sons teachers a cookie bouquet and it is so easy and absolutely amazing! I will do in heart shapes and add red roses with red ribbon and attach a card! Add to vase and BAM! A gift that cost about $8!"
"1","5","Quick, easy and delicious!"
"1","5","Best sugar cookies ever!! Took advise of past reviews & made sure butter was very soft. They came out perfect!!"
"1","5","This was so tasty that I will use it again when I need sugar cookies."
"1","5","Excellent and easy recipe. We wanted cookies on a cold, rainy day. These cookies filled our bellies and warmed the kitchen! I'm not much of a baker, so I especially liked that I didn't have to chill and roll them.   I had to add 1 T. of water because the dough was very dry. I also love vanilla so always add an extra splash. Finally, I baked them for 12 minutes. Made about 3 dozen. This is a keeper...printed out and filed in my old-school recipe box!"
"1","1","Way too much flour."
"1","1","It's very powdery. I was planning to roll it and stamp it into shapes and freeze it for upcoming kids' birthdays. Frustrating."
"1","5","Made these for the first time last night and they are perfection!! So easy, and delicious!! I used some of the suggestions some of the other people suggested such as adding more vanilla(used 1 1/2 tsp.) and made sure the butter was soft before mixing it, and I took them out of the oven after 8 min. even though they did not look done. They turned out perfect and my whole family loved them. I used my KitchenAid mixer and it worked great."
"1","5","super easy to make and they flatten nicely so you can frost and decorate easy too :) They also are moist with outer crisp but chewy center !"
"1","4","Don't usually like sugar cookies but these were yummy!"
"1","5","Awesome, easy and yummy!"
"1","5","I love this recipe perfect cookies made 8 dozen!"
"1","5","Delish! I made sure to use soft margarine and took them out at about 8.5mins. My boys dipped them in sprinkles before we baked them. Will definitely be using this recipe again!"
"1","4","My 'cookies' turned out great! My batter was crumbly like several complaints, but I added milk hoping it'd do the trick. They weren't what I intended to make, but they were perfect for tea! Really delicious!"
"1","5","Awesome, made them and my family and Santa loved it :)"
"1","1","I have tried this recipe exactly, and unlike other reviews my batter was very dry so i added a tad bit of water. This did not help at all. the cookies came out very dry and not at all like shown in the picture. I've made this recipe two times now hoping it would taste better the second time possible because of a mistake i made when i first tried it. I feel very bad that this cookies didn't work out. i wouldn't recommend making these"
"1","3","Don't get me wrong these cookies are really good, but it was kinda damp and needed more flavor. Also make sure every single time you make a recipe READ THE SERVINGS. I can't stress enough about it. I usually don't read the serving because I forget or it's cause my hands are a mess from baking so I can't get to my phone. My cookies turned into a giant cookie. Then I read it said teaspoon size dough balls so then my cookies turned into these big cookies. It also took a while to get the cookies to the to be exactly how I wanted them to be. If you have trouble making the dough balls like I did then I suggest that you squeeze them or else they will just fall apart in your hand. For these reasons I had to give this recipe a 3 star rating. One good reason these were home run because they were easy to make and I could find the ingredients around my home. I would also drink these with ice tea surprisingly it give a more admiring taste when you put the cookie in your mouth. I also am not a big sugar cookie fan cause I feel they don't give enough taste."
"1","5","Awesome. Perfect sugar cookies. I used half butter, half margarine and made sure both were sufficiently softened. I baked for exactly 8 minutes, and these were perfection. Paired with chocolate frosting II from this site. Just like my Granny used to make!"
"1","4","I had to make a few adjustments to the recipe I had to MELT the butter and the turned out soft and delicious"
"1","5","LOVE IT! I use it all the time! It's easy and tastes great!"
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. I even listened to what others said about making sure the butter was ultra soft, they still came out hard. There's just too much flour in the recipe I think. I even tried underbaking a batch and as soon as they start to cool they turn hard."
"1","4","This was my first attempt at scratch sugar cookies. Used this recipe because I had all the ingredients lying around the house. I read some folks has dry batter. I decided to add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil to the recipe and it worked perfectly! The cookies turned out great and I would definitely make them again!"
"1","5","Love this recipe! Made two batches already."
"1","5","These were good cookies my class liked them"
"1","5","Fun making these with my two and a half year old!!!!"
"1","5","I wasn't a big fan of sugar cookies until now. This is a great, easy recipe that my son and I love! I found that 8 - 10 minutes was way too long in my oven; to keep the cookies soft, I cooked them for 6 minutes and 30 seconds. They come out PERFECTLY soft, tan, and delicious."
"1","5","Yay! A simple-to-make & delectable-to-eat cookie that needs no frosting to be perfect! A nice amount of chewiness, but not so much that it falls apart. They don't last long, so make extra...I'm giving you fair warning, with a smile! Recipe that requires few ingredients, and those it calls for are commonly in your kitchen already...the way I like it!"
"1","5","The family and I were craving something sweet on NYE. Didn't really feel like driving anywhere, so I googled and found this recipe.. I had all the ingredients in my kitchen, I even added some Bee's Knees Peanut Butter to the batter.. OMG best cookies ever. I had to make another batch after the first, my husband and kids were in love.. Incredible recipe!!!!"
"1","5","this is my go to recipe for sugar cookies so perfect."
"1","5","Best (and easiest) sugar cookies I've ever had."
"1","5","I substituted some of the vanilla for orange extract and added some dried cranberries... Oh Sweet Jesus. Delicious."
"1","5","So quick and easy I added red and green mini M&Ms. My husband loved them I'll be making the again real soon!"
"1","5","Turned out great! I actually used mini chocolate chips (that's all I had in my pantry!) and butter flavored crisco. And finely chopped my walnuts, which almost gave it an oatmeal texture. They turned out great! Very pleased and will make these again! :)"
"1","5","I think this recipe is awesome! Make sure butter is completely softened and they turn out perfect. The tricky thing is cooking them long enough, but not too long!"
"1","5","Great recipe. I just added more vanilla flavoring and a pinch of salt."
"1","5","I had no idea just how delicious these cookies would be! They are definitely going into the family recipe box. I took the suggestions of making sure the butter is soft. I like to leave out the butter overnight and then nuke it for 15 seconds just to get the butter slightly melted. Also, I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract. I love vanilla extract. I think the vanilla really comes through because of adding a little extra. I made tablespoon size balls of dough , baked them for 10 minutes on 400 then when freshly baked made crisscross patterns with a fork to make little beds for cinnamon sugar and red sugar crystals thus making them more like snicker doodles. I even added a tsp of cinnamon in one batch. I like making the cookies a little larger and baking a minute or two longer because when these cookies cool down they become these hardy, delicious cookies you can really sink your teeth into. This is a wonderfully simple recipe, so when your family asks for more of these it won't be a problem to whip up if you have the ingredients handy. The recipe calls for a 2 cups of butter so, stock up."
"1","5","yummy easy my mom loved them I like to add extra eggs :)"
"1","5","Taste great and very easy!"
"1","4","Great recipe, I made a minor modification. Initially, the dough was way too dry, so for the second batch I reduced the flour to 2 and a 1/2 cups. Much improved texture. I also added orange essence (1 teaspoon) and 1/4 cup of flaked coconut. Absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","super easy to make and never fail! definitely agree with the last post. the butter has to be soft and everything blended well. slowly adding the flour and chilling afterwards seemed to help a bit aswell"
"1","4","So I added my own twist on the recipe. Came out so well the first time, I followed my instincts and made another. The butter really is the key. First batch, butter had been out all night to thaw and they came out perfect. Second batch, butter was out most of day, but was not softening much, I used a mixer on it, but the cookies still came out kinda hard. My old made from scratch recipe left me with hockey pucks, big improvement from that to just a bit hard. Try using a mixer on the butter, if nothing else it is easier to mix ingredients by hand."
"1","3","I've had better cookies."
"1","5","I made these tonight, and the only thing I did differently was to add an extra egg yolk, and had to substitute a tsp of water (for moisture) because I was out of any extracts that would have tasted good in this recipe. The dough felt a little crumbly when I started to shape them the first time, so I threw in the extra yolk and then it was perfect. They formed balls easily with no stickiness. I made larger sized cookies (recipe made about 12 total) so mine took more like 10 minutes to cook. They have a mildly crunchy outside with a chewy inside. The flavor is tasty enough to eat the cookie un-frosted, but is not so sweet that frosting them would be overkill."
"1","4","These are really interesting!! They didn't flatten out the way I thought they would but they were soft and chewy, even at 10 minutes baking. I have yet to figure out how to put sprinkles on well so they're even (I guess next time I'll do it in the dough rather than on the mounds) but they still came out great! Tasty and soft!"
"1","1","Too dry!! I'm so disappointed with the recipe"
"1","5","I am absolutely impressed!! Easy and delicious, and SO chewy! And to think, I was once afraid of attempting the sugar cookie!"
"1","5","Great recipe! All I would say in my experience, my batch of cookies would turn out to crispy to my liking so I put the cookies in for 7min instead of 8"
"1","5","Made these yesterday but I added mini chocolate chips to the batter then rolled them in sugar before baking. When I took them out of the oven I put a Hershey hugs in the middle. Made an awesome cookies and cream cookie."
"1","4","I made these tonight, and I have to say that they taste really good. Nice and crispy but soft in the middle. The only reason I deducted one star was because the first batch burned after 8 minutes and were hard as rocks. So I decreased the cooking time to 6 minutes, but then the centers totally deflated once out of the oven. I did roll out the dough and use cookie cutters and this may have been the problem. Perhaps they would have looked nicer if I'd just rolled them into balls."
"1","5","These are easy, tasty sugar cookies. There are a few individuals that said their cookies became hard after cooling. Probably from baking them a little too long. This can be fixed! I too noticed that my sugar cookies were becoming too hard for my liking. I read about this, but forgot to heed the eight-minute warning, until after the first batch. I happen to bake the 'Easy Lemon Cookies' the same time I baked these cookies. I placed the Easy Lemon Cookies, which are VERY moist, in the same container as the Easy Sugar Cookies. The result... Nice and chewy sugar cookies. I'm sure you could also use a piece of bread to obtain the same outcome. Great recipe!"
"1","5","Excellent! I followed exactly step by step. This was my first time EVER making cookies from scratch. They came out PERFECT. not 'kinda good' or 'ok' but PERFECT. I'm on cloud nine. Now if only i could perfect using the cookie cutters"
"1","4","Read some reviews and since I like a more vanilla flavored sugar cookie I added an extra teaspoon and a half. Also- right before putting them onto the cookie sheet I dipped the top of the rolled dough into white sugar... (Trying brown sugar dipped next). AND- depending on size--bake for 8-9 minutes as other reviewer suggested. I used slightly less than an average cookie scoop...fitting 12 on each cookie sheet and after 8-9 minutes in preheated oven they still looked dough color yet slight golden brown bottom. After cooled they were slightly crunchy from outside with slightly chewy inside which is my preference. With those adjustments Id give 9 stars:)  Agree with Rolanda! Room temp butter (all ingredients) for cookies. Cold butter for pie crusts."
"1","5","Very yummy. I added a bit more almond extract than called for and it was wonderful. I froze half the batch to pull out and cook as desired."
"1","4","I found it very dry, will use a second egg next time. I increased my liquid this time and it worked out. I also found the cooking time was closer to 14 minutes, even when I flattened them a bit with a fork? I used Watkins Hazelnut Extract in place of the Vanilla for an extra pleasant taste! ;)"
"1","4","The recipe is quick and easy. The cookies were good. Will use again"
"1","5","Hands down the best one we've tried yet! I did a couple of things different, first I used my stand mixer. I used a melon baller to form the cookies instead of hand rolling (didn't get hands messy) and then I rolled the cookie in sugar before baking. Soft and yummy with the crunch of a sugar coating. I had to bake mine at 8 minutes for the first batch and then 7 for the remaining to get the right texture my family likes. I bake cookies at least twice a week and these are at the top of my list!"
"1","5","Super easy! I tweaked it a little bit though. I used melted (accidentally) margarine instead of butter, and had to refrigerate dough for about 30 mins since it was too soft. I also used double the amount of vanilla and a pinch of salt. Only baked for 7 mins and they came out perfect! Added M&M's while they were cooling and then stored in Tupperware. Still soft 2 days later, and my kids keep sneaking them..doubt they'll last a third day!"
"1","5","Very delicious! Followed the advice of another reviewer and let my butter completely soften (I cheated- microwaved it for about 12 seconds. Perfect!) and they turned out delicious! I rolled them into a ball and rolled them in a mixture of jello powder/sugar. BAM! Delicious! :) 5 stars! I doubled the recipe and rolled them into small balls."
"1","5","Great easy recipe and tastes perfect - light with just the right amount of sweet :)"
"1","5","These cookies were perfect for an after school activity with my daughter. It was quick to make, and we rolled the balls halfway in green sugar, red sugar, or sprinkles before baking them. I added half a teaspoon of salt because I don't like cookies without it. It just balances the sweetness. We also smooshed the balls to about a quarter of an inch thickness so they'd be thinner cookies like the first photo of the recipe. Oh, and I played around a bit and chopped up some chocolate mints, stuffed them in the middle, and enclosed them with the dough. So yummy! Since my daughter and I had more fun making these than traditional sugar cookie cutouts, I'm going to stick with this easy, tasty recipe."
"1","5","This really was an easy recipe and the cookies came out AWESOME!"
"1","5","I substituted the vanilla extract for orange oil. A wonderful simple change."
"1","4","Really easy to make and bake - I left to set in the fridge for an hour because they were a bit crumby. When I removed them they were still brittle so I added a splash of milk and they rolled into balls fine. I added peppermint extract and green food colouring to the mix to make it Christmas-y and rolled the balls in sugar as well as pressing some crushed candy cane pieces into the biscuit straight after removing it from the oven. I would recommend baking the biscuits on the middle rack of your oven - I had one batch on the lower rack and they burnt right through in the 8 minutes.  All in all, a fantastic recipe that could be easily adapted to suit the Christmas theme I was going for."
"1","5","This is the best Sugar Cookie recipe I ever tryed. My hubby never liked Sugar Cookies till he ate some of these cookies. They are the best."
"1","5","First time trying this recipe. Turned out pretty good! I made them for my nephew & his friends & they were a big hit! I sprinkled sugar over the first batch then powdered sugar on the second. They loved both but said regular sugar was the best! I'll definitely be making them again!"
"1","5","I absolutely love it' ,it is simple and easy to make. I followed the recipe, but I microwave the butter for melted 50sec. And I cooked the cookies at 350 in the oven for 10-15 min. Perfect cookies!!!!!"
"1","5","Made this tonight for my husband and son and they couldn't get enough. They loved them so much. Very easy to make."
"1","5","Very nice. I rolled some in sugar. Some in sugar/ cinnamon, and added pecans to a few. Nice addition to cookie gift boxes. Ty"
"1","4","I loved this recipe! The cookies were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside! I found when the dough was finished it was a little to sticly so i added about a tablespoon more flour to make it better. Everything about this recipe is great but i found was when I baked the cookies, they came out to be verry round. I was expecting to have more flat cookies but they just poofed up instead. All i did to fix it was as soon as they came out of the oven i took a spoon and pressed on them so when they cooled they became flat. They also had a small taste of baking powder. I didnt add to much but for some reason they tated a little bit like it."
"1","2","I did everything right and they didn't expand! all i got were baked balled of dough..."
"1","5","Best sugar cookie ever. This is coming from a person who hates to bake!"
"1","5","Omg these cookies are amazing! Extremely addicting to eat, easy to make, and taste amazing!"
"1","5","Easy to make - I make them low carb using Carbquick and Splenda and they turned out great!"
"1","5","Just made this and it was everything promised. Easy, at 8 minutes they were soft and chewy. Sweet enough to be enjoyed by themselves, but not so sweet that icing wouldn't be delicious on them too. Loved it, and sugar cookies are my least favorite cookie."
"1","5","Quick and easy for a mom of three"
"1","3","An OK recipe. I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want to make as many and they were really dry and after I baked them they were not flat like the picture but raised and puffy (which might have been because I cut the recipe). The taste was good, not great. I'll have to give it another try with the full ingredients but for now I give it a 3."
"1","4","Simple and quick! Thanks for the recipe. I was a bit bad and rolled them in sugar before baking."
"1","5","I really liked these simple but yummy cookies. I did make two altercations though. I added one teaspoon of almond extract and two teaspoons of lemon extract due to I wanted something lemony. They were perfect. Highly recommend all to try."
"1","5","I frosted mine and they were delicious! Just don't over bake them and you're good. They have slightly crispy edges with soft centers. I bake them for 8 minutes and then let them cool on the sheet for a few minutes. I've found this allows them to firm up so you can remove them from the tray. Overall winner!"
"1","4","Good recipe. I would recommend adding maybe a 1/2tsp salt but otherwise good. Also check cookies at 8min because if you cook too long they get kinda hard. I like my cookies soft and chewy."
"1","4","It was good but it could be a little sweeter. Probably taste good with icing"
"1","4","These cookies turned out beautiful!! There were not the best cookies ever but they were still delicious cookies are cookies great recipe over all"
"1","5","Very easy and simple to do :)"
"1","2","when I did the cookies i followed the direction but when I was mixing they came out soft and won't be able to come out round and they it came out not to be cookies but spreading burned dough. Somebody pls help me"
"1","5","OMG! Wow these cookies are amazing. I added cinnamon, a lot. 3 tbs. Thank you for the tip to cook only 8 minutes. They are crispy and still have a soft chew. Thank you!"
"1","5","These came out so perfect for me, I added sprinkles to make them look nice. My family loved them!"
"1","5","Loved these, and yes, I made a few alterations. I wanted my cookies to have that hint of almond flavor so I replaced 1/2 cup of flour with 1/2 cup completely crushed almonds (crushed in food processor until powdery but not pasty). I also doubled the vanilla and added 2 tsp almond extract (since some had said they were a little bland as is). Like others mentioned, I let the butter sit out until VERY soft - overnight actually - and the dough was a perfect consistency. Baked for 10 min. They came out perfect! Slightly puffed, slightly crispy edges and slightly soft chewy centers. There was a delicious flavor from the almonds and extract. Definitely would add the almond extract again even if I didn't have crushed almonds on hand."
"1","5","It was a very easy cookie to make for my family"
"1","4","I love baking for my family!!! And when I saw this recipe for sugar cookies I EEEEEKED with excitement, we love decorating them and all that stuff. So I tried the recipe VERBATUM and I couldn't get the constancy that I needed. I even tried the softened butter, but that still left it too dry. So I put two tbs of vegetable oil and that mace IT PERFECT!!! I love this recipe and have it printed but I made that one little addition. Thank you for this recipe! !!?????"
"1","5","Loved it! So easy and fast. My batter was really dry because I didn't have an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar. So I added a little vegetable oil until it was wet enough to stick together. I added food coloring to make pumpkin looking cookies. Everyone loved them and said they taste great. I also added some salt. Thanks!"
"1","5","Amazing! Thank you so much :)"
"1","5","Do I have to use both baking powder and baking soda? I haven't made them yet, but I have everything but baking powder and wanted to know if they would still turn out.."
"1","5","Yes."
"1","5","My 9 year old granddaughter made these tonight and they tasted great! She used almond extract instead of vanilla. Easy to make and very tastey."
"1","5","Love this recipe! My daughter loved helping me make them!! My husband thinks they taste awesome!! Perfect, easy, delicious treat."
"1","4","Not a bad recipe. Hubby really enjoys them and asks for them all the time. I found them a bit bland for my liking, but everyone else loves them so that makes me happy. :)"
"1","5","This recipe is super easy and delicious. I always add just a little more vanilla than called for. It is also great for a base recipe for flavored cookies. I provide cookies for community meals. Sugar is always a hit but I like to add a tsp. of lemon, raspberry, lime, and mint (individually not all at once) to create flavored cookies. Its best to add a couple drops of food coloring so you can tell them apart (lol, or else there could be problems). Then for frosting them just make a powder sugar frosting with the same extracts. Any way you look at it this is my favorite sugar cookie recipe."
"1","5","I lived this took advice for 2tso vanilla accidently used lemon flavor for first tsp thought I had vanilla lol so I used 1lemon 1 vanilla worked wonderful so then I mixed powdered sugar and lemon juice and drizzeled cookies with glaze delish so my screw up worked out great lol"
"1","5","Sooo yummy, would anyone reccomend saving some of the sugar from the mix out of the batter and sprinkling it on top before baking? that's how I usually make sugar cookies"
"1","5","The cookies are hugs!!!! They taste amazing. Love them."
"1","5","Excellent! So easy and beautiful!"
"1","5","These cookies are so yummy! They came out perfectly just as the recipe is written. My daughter made homemade whipped icing to dip them in, oh my gosh, so good together!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe and had amazing cookies. I was low on time and was making cookies for my color guard team, and I found this recipe. Loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"1","4","Okay ummm I just accidentally a whole egg for a 24 serving batch and.. The cookies turned out fine! So don't freak out they will turn out great still."
"1","5","one word. perfect!!!"
"1","5","These are excellent!! I was looking for an easy homemade sugar cookie recipe and got exactly what I was looking for. They do not need any extra icing on top. Mine came out crispy and sweet and were perfect by themselves. My only advice is to definitely melt the butter first. Also, in my case these cookies probably took closer to 15 minutes to cook. They still looked like batter after only 8 minutes so if you are short on time plan for 15 minutes a batch (but certainly check them sooner just in case!) I will definitely make these again. The taste is phenomenal!"
"1","4","like these but they have like a slight chemical flavor for some reason. its hard to describe. can anyone elaborate? we made them into like 15 large cookies."
"1","5","Love this recipe! Made 2 batches in no time. I read the reviews prior to baking so I melted the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat prior to mixing in the sugar. I also adjusted the cook time to 14 min. because of the liquid butter. The cookies are awesome and will be baking often."
"1","5","I made these cookies and they were perfect. I cooked them for 9 minutes and added a little more vanilla as well. They were soft and chewy. My husband and children loved them. I will be using this recipe from now on. I left the butter out until completely soft.. practically melting. Anyone who says they didn't turn out right did something wrong! !"
"1","5","I made these with my 7 year old, easy and delicious!"
"1","5","I give this recipe 5 stars because it was so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did was refrigerate the dough for about 30 min after mixing all the ingredients. My cookies were surprisingly delicious! This was my first time making sugar cookies but definitely won't be the last."
"1","3","I had to put another egg in mind to make mind even a good batter"
"1","4","I just made this recipe and I'm very pleased with the results. I had all the ingredients in my pantry and the cookies came out great!! Can't wait for my family to try them."
"1","4","My batter turned out runny- probably because I only had margarine on hand and not butter. Turned out great, however, with the addition of a little more flour. Also added a tsp or two of Japanese matcha, tsp or more cinnamon, and a 1/4-1/3 tsp each of nutmeg and ginger. Turned out a nice batch of green chai cookies. :D"
"1","5","My 12 year old son made these - quick and easy peasy. In my stand mixer, he creamed the butter and sugar together first. Once it was well creamed, he added the egg and vanilla. He measured and mixed the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and added them to the creamed mixture. Realizing he forgot half the butter, we added softened butter at the end. It turned out just fine. My whole family enjoyed this spur of the moment treat."
"1","5","Perfect go to easy cookie. Nothing AMAZING...but you can add what ever you like to it, like Heath or what ever chips. Good easy cookie"
"1","5","Wow! I live in China where ovens are rare, but I missed the taste of cookies (they don't do baked goods here very well...) so I went out and bought a little convection/toaster oven to make a few cookies in whenever I missed home. I definitely made sure to soften the butter, although I have to admit, I did toss everything together, instead of following the steps. It helped that I only made six at one time (small oven, remember?) but these were great. I did not have access to vanilla extract but they tasted fine without! I pretty much just stood by the oven and ate them before even letting them cool, lol."
"1","5","I did these 2day for my daughter and my siblings and they were jus perfect. 2014 and still rating this recipe as the best."
"1","5","I don't know how these could not turn out delicious!! So simple and delicious!!! Next batch I'm going to put in a little fresh orange zest."
"1","5","I agree with Rolanda, however, her comment saved me from making that mistake and for her future reference...they were only plain because you allowed them to be plain. Here's what I did while in search of the worlds greatest cookie WITH THIS RECIPE! 1) I finally stopped believing that somehow Miss Crocker with her prepackaged ingredients, would somehow get me where I needed to be. Stephanie on the other hand...ROCKS! 2) Obviously, I'm a guy and guy's tend to try to keep with the KISS method of 'keep it simple stupid' which I did and in knowing that I am surely not rolling anything I am not going to drive or smoke (in my younger daze the latter) I opted to adding an egg, a 1\8 cup of olive oil and 1\2 a cup of sugar while replacing half the vanilla with almost extract. Why? Because of 3) I added about 1\2 cup of chopped almonds-pecans (totaling 1\2 cup of nuts), goatmeal, shredded coconut, white chocolate chips and 1\3 cup of toffee chips. The egg, oil and sugar help to offset all these extra ingredients and in keeping with my KISS method...after stirring it up by hand for longer than I would have imagined...I lazily poured the whole thing into a 12x24' flat (1\2' high), aluminum pizza pan and spread it out evenly. Gave my Labs the lickings of the bowl and stuck it in the oven. You MUST monitor its progress to make sure it's baking the way you want or you'll get crisp edges. After about 10 minutes, I rotated the pan in the oven and then in 10 more minutes, by palm, I patted it"
"1","5","I made this tonight and it came out great. I started mixing the ingredients together and the flour was overwhelming so I mixed the dough with my hands and it was much easier to handle. I will make the cookies again in the near future."
"1","5","i like them"
"1","5","The cookies came out of the oven great! Although one side of the cookies were crisp but not the other so I had to flip them over and cook the other side for about 3 minutes."
"1","4","Softened butter is key I would also recommend unsalted butter.  To soften your butter put in the microwave for 10 seconds twice followed by about 15 seconds. Do NOT do 35 seconds strait you will get soup."
"1","5","They are delicious! Definitely will be making again."
"1","5","these are so good!!!"
"1","2","The cookies never really flattened while baking."
"1","3","Tried it, the dough was very sticky, and hard to get in to dollops on the pan. The cookies baked well enough. Went to take them off of cookie sheet and they stuck (thought they weren't burnt). The aftertaste of the cookies was bitter. I'm guessing its user error based on how well this recipe is rated."
"1","5","As I write this, I'm pulling my first tray of cookies out of the oven! I picked this as my first home made project, and I don't regret it. It was easy to do, and I can't wait to find other recipes to bake!"
"1","5","I just used this recipe tonight. The recipe works great if you use a mixer. I had also baked them for 9 mins."
"1","5","These cookies taste AMAZING! I found this recipe and decided to make them for my school project since it looked easy and it was a huge hit! Since then, Ive made it for my family and friends and we all love it. I highly recommend you make these, you wont be disappointed."
"1","5","Perfect and delicious!"
"1","5","There great perfect and its way much better than the store one to be honest and the best part is that they are homemade you have fun cooking them ???"
"1","4","The consistency and texture of these cookies are great!! But for some reason, I felt that it wasn't 'sugary' enough."
"1","4","I tried this recipe tonight. I looked at a lot of the reviews.i followed the directions but my butter sat out for two days due to not having eggs. It made the cookies super soft. They were very tasty and had a little puff to them. Tasted like store sugar cookies. I definitely can see if I used cold sugar that it wouldn't have came out as well. Put them on a rack to cool and transferred to sealed container."
"1","5","This was great! My family loved it. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. Delicious!"
"1","5","This recipe was good and easy to follow. I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies came out great!!!! Make sure the butter is completely soft. I will make these all the time it will be my good to recipe because I always have these ingredients in the kitchen. Next time all add icing on top for the kids."
"1","5","These worked perfectly and were indeed quick and easy :)"
"1","5","they were delicious."
"1","5","love the cookies. So easy. i have the recipe memorized. Fun to do with little kids."
"1","5","I made these cookies yesterday, 6/21/14, and they were good. The only thing I did different was to add 2 tsp vanilla instead of 1 tsp. My husband commented on them every time he ate one. I think the next time I make them, I'll changed the vanilla extract to almond extract. I'll also buy another cookie sheet so that I can get them done sooner."
"1","2","Cookies look like puff balls they don't flatten out."
"1","5","Just made these. They are the easiest sugar cookie I've ever made. Best of all, they are better than the complicated and time consuming type you have to refrigerate or slice. I looked at the reviews prior to making and made sure the butter was totally softened and baked for only 8 minutes. Also, I rolled some in sugar and some not. Great both ways. These are fast, easy and delicious. A definite 5 STARS from me!"
"1","5","If you want some more variety to the cookies, you can add a chocolate chip to the top when they're balls of dough. Either way, these cookies are delicious."
"1","5","Made this for my niece's potluck at school and they were delicious! Would make this at Christmas, roll them out and use cookie cutters! Great recipe!"
"1","4","Not sure what I did wrong but these cookies stayed so round & tall I had to flatten them with a spatula after removing from oven. Delicious tasting! Will certainly make again!"
"1","4","I really liked the cookies, I made a slight variation, I added 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and they were delicious! And then dusted them with a little bit of icing sugar. The only problem was that they didn't spread out that much. But they we're easy & delicious anyway!"
"1","5","I thought these cookies turned out great. I am not a baker by habit and I wanted something delicious and simple - this cookies accomplished that task to T. My boyfriend isn't a fan of sugar cookies typically, but he can't stop eating these! I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cups white sugar and doubled the vanilla. I rolled them in sugar before baking them and they turned out fantastic. I prefer my cookies soft and these were melt in your mouth. I saw that some people had problems with the butter. I took mine out of the fridge right when I started baking and microwaved both sticks in a bowl for 30 seconds and then for another 30 seconds, so it was soft and partially melted. That worked great and I didn't have any issues with the dough becoming dry and flaky."
"1","5","I was in a hurry to make a fruit pizza and didn't have time to go to the store to buy sugar cookie dough. I found this recipe and pressed it into an 11x15 pan and it worked perfectly! I set the butter out to soften at room temperature until it was very soft and removed it from the oven at 9-10 minutes. I didn't check to see if I had overdone it since some said to take it out of the oven after 8 minutes, but I knew that the cream cheese I was going to put on top of it would soften it up if I did. Someday I will try making cookies with this recipe but I may not have to buy sugar cookie dough again!"
"1","4","I agree with the other comments that about 1/2 cup less flour should be used in this recipe, and I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract for flavor. My dough would not stick together so I had to add some extra melted butter as well to save the recipe. I still gave these cookies four stars because, despite the dryness of using too much flour, they do taste really good. However, I think I may try a new sugar cookie recipe next time."
"1","5","I have tried this recipe and it is great. You can't even get cinnamon and sugar and dunk the cookie dough into the cinnamon and sugar and it makes a great snickerdoodles"
"1","1","I didn't like this recipe. at ALL. It was like sweet bread."
"1","5","I tried this recipe on Saturday the 10th. These cookies were a hit with my family n friends. Took the majority to a baby shower n they loved the cookies. I used my measuring spoon to make my individual cookies n they came out so uniform n perfect. This recipe is a keeper!"
"1","3","I tried this recipe without reading the reviews...should have read the reviews! After adding 2 and 1/4 cups of flour I noticed that the dough was starting to get dry so I didn't add any more. I did, however, use the same amount of butter...I should have cut that also! The cookies didn't come out dry, they did flatten out, and they were not hard after cooling, but they contained a little too much butter! I am going to try this recipe again and change the measurements of the flour to 2 and 1/4 cups and the butter to 3/4 cup. I'll let you know how it turns out! I also, think I will add either more vanilla or even some other extract...orange, lemon, or almond come to mind."
"1","5","Amazing recipe I've made it 14 times and its worked! If you dont like it then take out the baking powder!"
"1","5","Great fluffy cookies. I doubled the ingredients, added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla, used half margarine half shortening, substituted 1/3 of the white sugar for brown sugar, rolled the cookies in sugar and cinnamon and added a Pecan half on top. Perfect."
"1","3","Prep time was quick but the taste is blah. I even added extra vanilla. My ingredients were dry and crumbly as well after mixing but I smoothed it out with the back of a spoon and it smoothed out."
"1","4","Followed the recipe exactly, and these are pretty darn good cookies! Easy & quick; made 5 dozen using my cookie scoop. I do think it could use just a teeny bit more... something. Sugar? Vanilla? With this recipe, as written, they almost taste like almond cookies."
"1","5","Super easy and really delicious. I added some almond extract and used cake and pastery flour and still beautiful :)"
"1","5","Right sweet, right crunch. Added cinnamon because hubby loves cinnamon. 1tsp. Perfect. Keeper. Will make often."
"1","5","This was my first batch of cookies from scratch. I really wanted cookies and told myself that the only way I was going to get them was to make them myself. I couldn't believe I had all the ingredients! It said soften butter, so I stuck the stick in the microwave for 25 seconds. I don't have a hand mixture, so I mixed everything with a fork and then a spatula. I halved the recipe, but still used a full egg. The batter turned out great and was easy to work with - it seemed a little dry when I was mixing, but eventually it was fine (maybe because I used a a full egg, instead of the half an egg the halved recipe called for). I rolled them into measured tsp balls, and they did come out very small. My cookies didn't spread at all. Like others have said, the cookies are soft and chewy at 8 minutes. Because they are small, I don't feel guilty eating two (or three ;) ) Thank you for the recipe!!!"
"1","5","I added a dash of nutmeg and oatmeal to mine but it seemed too dry so I put in a little milk, they taste great! looking forward to doing this recipe again"
"1","5","I loved this recipe! For me it took up 3 cookie sheets and I still had a small amount of dough left over I recommend that you put the cookies in for 6 minutes then if they aren't done check them after a minute and if they STILL aren't done then put them in for one more minute, those bake fast so watch! Also, I brought these to school for my friends and they loved them! I recommend making sure the butter is like SUPER soft. You'll thank me later."
"1","5","I love this cookie recipe and so does my family! The deal with the butter is so true! My first batch my cookies came out great! my second I was in a rush and didn't let the butter soften all the way and they came out looking like biscuits"
"1","5","the cookies turned out AMAZING and tasted even better , if you wanna change things up a little though , instead of vanilla extract , thrown in some lemon extract and you get some pretty tasty lemon cookies !"
"1","4","I love this recipe the only problem is that they never expand i give them room and the just stay in ball form i followed the recipe step by step"
"1","5","Easy to make & taste great. They disappear fast"
"1","5","These were very easy to make and delicious! I made sure the butter was very soft before creaming as suggested by another review. Used a very good quality vanilla. Rolled them in coloured sugar before baking. These got devoured by company immediately and had a few demands for the recipe!"
"1","5","I used these for a class project where we had to substitute the vanilla with rose geranium oil and even with the obvious change in flavor, my friend's first comment was that they weren't at all sugary and gritty like sugar cookies usually are and that they weren't too sweet which was really good in his opinion. Even though I accidentally burned them, he had several which I would say is definitely a compliment to the recipe, lol. Another person who did the substitution with the oil said people thought they were from a gourmet chef. If you choose to do an essential oil substitution make sure you have therapeutic grade oil safe for consumption and I did 2 drops of oil in 1 dozen cookies. Anyway, I am sure they are amazing just in the regular recipe because the most noticeable thing was how smooth, not too sweet and 'non-gritty' they were."
"1","5","I really loved makeing and earting these cookies, but I cut the recipie in half instead of 48 I made 24. The only problem I had was my second batch burned alittle because I left it in too long."
"1","3","This recipe was very dry. So I added some water and then it got really sticky:(. It taste really good but is hard to handle. But they still turned out good after I cooked them."
"1","3","I give 3 stars to 'Easy Sugar Cookies'."
"1","5","Great cookies"
"1","2","Made this recipe exactly as per the directions and I didn't like them too much. They taste 'flour-y' although they are a simple cookie to make. Definitely don't over-bake, I'd recommend 8 or 9 minutes tops. I prefer a sugar cookie with sour cream or just something else- this recipe is missing something."
"1","4","Followed this recipe except I used margarine instead of butter as that's what I had on hand. The first batch didn't come out right. They didn't spread out much so I just had 'cookie balls'. Which is fine but I like a flatter cookie. I flattened the second batch with my hands before baking and they came out much better. I would also add, the secret to softer cookies is in the timing. For a softer, chewier cookie, bake them for less time and for a crispier cookie, bake them for longer. Leaving the cookies on the cookie sheet for five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack will also help with the consistency of the cookie."
"1","5","I was concerned at first because the dough was very crumbly and dry. But it would still form balls so I just went ahead and put them in the oven and they taste great! They didn't flatten out so they are a little thicker than the usual sugar cookie, but they are so soft, chewy and yummy!"
"1","5","These were a hit! Rolled them in cinnamon sugar for a faux snickerdoodle."
"1","3","I was craving a good sugar cookie recipe for a chilly, winter day. I started researching recipes and Allrecipes seemed to be quality. I have been very impressed with some of your other dishes, but this slightly disappointed me. I gathered my ingredients and preheated the oven. I had ran into several problems already. The doh refused to blend well, and I was forced to hand knead it, wasting time and effort. The recipe says that prep time takes fifteen minutes, but instead I found myself at the the kitchen counter for a good half hour. Once it put it into the oven, it took a little over fifteen minutes to bake, the recipe called for ten. I taste-tested the cookies, and they came out bland and inconsistent. Overall, this took up at least an hour of my day, with no quality cookies to reward myself with. I did enjoy the slight sweetness it had though."
"1","5","I've been looking for the perfect cookie recipe. And now I've found it! The first time I made it and tasted it I really couldn't believe I made them."
"1","5","This was easy and they tasted great. Im english so I dont do cup measurements so it was really helpful you can convert to metric and also change the yield. (I had never made cookies before although I make bread, scones, cakesI always make usually half a new recipe to try it out. I wish I made the full amount now!!!) I also softened the I cant believe its not butter in the microwave for 10 seconds.Had no vanilla extract so put a tablespoon of ground ginger in (I made half the original recipe amount) this gave a nice hint of ginger not too strong).My oven is terrible always takes longer than what recipies say so I experimented a bit and made in 2 batches and took 2 out at a time after 10 minutes. I really thought they looked very undercooked after 10 mins in my awful oven but as the other reviewers had said they crisped up when cold. I found the cookies I had cooked for 12mins were the most to my taste. They had a nice crisp bite to the outside and were still chewy and soft on the inside. Really I think the timing is down to trial and error depending on your oven. I will probably make these every day now when making bread they were so easy. Byebye shop bought biscuits ( sorry! Cookies I know biscuits in the US are savory. In England a biscuit is a cookie."
"1","5","This will be the drop sugar cookie recipe I use from now on. It was very easy, especially with a stand mixer. As one review suggested, you have to keep beating after you add the flour until it forms into a ball of dough. This is true even if you are making the sugar cookie dough out of a package. I used a tablespoon size cookie scoop and rolled each scoop in sugar before putting on the cookie sheet."
"1","5","Wow, THE best sugar cookies. I did double the vanilla, as others suggested, and cooked to 8 minutes. PERFECT. Slightly crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. My diabetic mother makes me hide these cookies!"
"1","5","Great recipe and they turned out great!! I actually didn't have baking powder when I made these and I ended up substituting it for more baking soda and it worked out fine."
"1","5","Very good cookies came out nice and chewy!"
"1","5","Love this simple recipe! Our cookies tasted great!"
"1","5","I just wrote a whole description of our cookie making adventure. It go erased. These are excellent. Not writing it all over again. We had a good time. Will try to send picture. 8-9 min for generous tsp."
"1","5","I didn't have any problems with this recipe. I did use 2 tsps. of Vanilla as several people had suggested it. Also I put my sticks of butter in the microwave until they were almost liquid and that helped tremendously. Sugar cookies have always been one of my favorites and this is so easy, we all love them! Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","So simple & simply Good. I will bake these cookies again."
"1","5","Super easy to do!! We doubled the vanilla extract and shortened the bake time to 8 minutes. :) super soft and yummy!!"
"1","1","I made teaspoon sized balls and they somehow managed to melt together and were rock hard when I tried them. I double checked the recipe and I did everything right....... and I consider my self a good baker..."
"1","5","The review that said to make sure the butter was soft - you can always use half oil and half butter to make a softer cookie. Air temperature may have played a part in how dry they were. Also, on my cookie, I dipped the tops in ground coriander, and it gave them a snickerdoodle-type taste (could also use cinnamon). Delicious recipe... good staple cookie. Will make over and over and add different toppings and flavorings for variety"
"1","5","Very good and very easy. Double the vanilla and use margarine instead of butter.... VERY well softened margarine. 375 was ok but 8 minutes is definitely the max. They will not spread out like the picture so ball them up and press them a bit on the pan (hockey puck-ish but a bit thicker). Great base recipe."
"1","5","I made these cookies but gluten free. The only thing I changed was the flour. I used Pamela's gluten free artisan flour blend. No one could tell the difference. I rolled the dough between wax paper to keep it from sticking."
"1","5","Simply the best!"
"1","1","Boring...no taste and very dull and flat. I've tasted better cookies. I will stick to my old recipe."
"1","5","Good recipe!I did use wheat flour instead of white,tasted fine. Everyone loved it!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out amazing! Kept in oven for 8 minutes--not a minute more--and the texture is great. Fluffy and slightly chewy, not flat and crispy. Highly recommend!"
"1","4","This recipe is easy and my husband loves them. Make sure the butter is really soft like mush before you even bother to try otherwise you will end up with a crumbled mess. I add two teaspoons of Vanilla to boost the flavor and a little bit of milk to keep them extra soft after baking."
"1","1","I should have read the negative reviews before actually making this recipe. There's simply not enough moisture in this recipe. I made do by adding some milk... ask me how much I don't know. The recipe might be for advanced cooks, hence the 'quick and easy' theme but this isn't easy. My cookies were very sweet, stuck to my cookie sheets and didn't flatten out prettily and while tasty, weren't easy.   I won't be using this recipe again."
"1","4","I really love this recipe! It's easy and delicious and that's what I like. I just used brown sugar instead of white sugar and the recipe said to do teaspoon size balls when putting then in the cookie sheet but unless you want mini cookies, I suggest you do tablespoon size balls."
"1","5","I have tried this receipe for 1st time and its great.Every one love the taste. Thanks for ur help."
"1","5","This recipe was perfect....Sugar cookies are not supposed to be super sweet...just the right amount of sweetness. Also, if you put them in a sealed bag or container after only 2 minutes of cooling, when they are still a little warm, they will stay much more chewy rather then get really hard...oh and a previous review said to use margarine, but when made with real butter, the flavor is much better, not to mention much better for you. I found that butter is much softer if you put it in the microwave on defrost for 1 minute..it will not melt and it will be just as soft as margarine."
"1","5","Quick, soft, and delicious! Best homemade sugar cookies I've ever had!"
"1","5","What a great recipe! I avoid vegetable shortening at all costs, so I was glad to find this recipe that does not call for shortening. The cookies were quite flavorful and the recipe was a breeze! I made one change -- tripled the amount of vanilla extract, which gave the cookies a deeper profile. My husband enjoyed rolling the balls of dough and decorating the cookies with our son."
"1","5","I was craving sugar cookies so I was looking around and found this recipe. They were AMAZING!! The only thing I 'altered' was I mixed some cinnamon and sugar in a bowl and rolls the dough in it before putting it on the cookie sheet. I will definitely be making these again."
"1","5","i tried this recipe. 'Best Sugar Cookies In The World' they should be called! they turned out great! I did bake them for 9 min. and made them a little bigger. They were so moist and easy to make and my family enjoyed them so much."
"1","4","I did add a second egg and doubled the vanilla to get the taste I prefer. But very good basic recipe. I used real butter that was definitely softened. However, this recipe may be more moist using margarine instead of butter. Will be making again, the kids ate them before they even cooled off!"
"1","4","I have made this recipe three times and the first two times the cookies came out crunchy despite keeping them in for the specified amount of time. Yesterday I made the dough but accidentally added too much flour. The dough was a bit dry. I added two tablespoons of evaporated milk ( because it was all I had at the time), mixed the dough until it was a bit sticky, and the cookies came out awesome! They were nice and chewy, just the way I always wanted them to be. Adding lemon extract also gave it a nice flavor."
"1","5","These are super easy to make! Tasty too! Tastes better after 24 hours."
"1","4","ADD ANOTHER EGG, CUT SODA IN HALF, EXTRA TSP. OF VANILLA! Some of the reviews state that the dough was sandy and crumbling. After the same result, I tried again only this time I added an extra egg, another tsp. of vanilla and cut the baking soda in half. Came out PERFECT! Crispy edges and SOFT middle!"
"1","2","Apparently I should have read the reviews before trying this recipe because my sugar cookies did not come out well at all! I tried to make holiday cookies with this recipe that required rolling the batter out with a rolling pin, and the batter was too crumbly to do this. It was terrible! Other reviews say it all depends on the butter, but I don't even want to bother trying this recipe a second time to find out."
"1","5","excellent cookie! I made one batch exactly like the recipe and added half vanilla half almond flavor, and a mini sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon quick easy to make"
"1","5","I used this recipe (added pecans and milk) for my Christmas List this year; each year my friends and family get cookies/brownies as gifts. I wanted the taste of the traditional sugar cookie without the hassle of cookie cutters and tedious decorating. I used this recipe and added a few of my own changes, and the cookies were spectacular tasting and looked good. These are my own invention, Texas-Sized Sugar Cookies."
"1","5","Made these with my three-year-old and it was a hit! After we rolled them into balls, we dipped them in sugar sprinkles to make them festive, then put them on the tray to bake. We only baked half the dough the first time and saved the rest by rolling into a log and wrapping in plastic wrap. Next time we wanted cookies, we just took out the roll and sliced the rest. Delicious!"
"1","3","I used this recipe last night and the batter was extremely crumbly and I couldn't get the batter to form a dough ball to bake it. The butter I used was even sitting out all day for about 9 hours or more. what I did was added one additional egg and 4 tablespoons of melted butter then mixed it in. The consistency then was perfect and they baked very well. They were soft and tasted great. To finish them off I sprinkled sugar over all of them. But overall, this recipe was extremely easy and everyone should probably already have all of the ingredients."
"1","5","THE BEST SUGAR COOKIE!! I've tried many recipes over the years, even pre-made dough from the store. My husband and son adore sugar cookies, but I just couldn't get them to turn out right. This recipe was simple and quick. I let my butter sit out overnight to ensure it was soft enough. Only modification I made was at the advice of another to increase vanilla. Baked them for 8 mins ... Absolutely delicious! DEFINITELY a keeper."
"1","5","Awesome! Used egg replacer since my son is allergic to eggs. We squished the dough into an ice cream scoop, placed the firm dough scoops onto a parchment lined baking sheet and pressed 5 smarties into each scoop of dough. They turned out awesome! Just remember to place the smarties really close together near the top...maybe even touching. The dough will spread out nicely. Putting the smarties too close to the sides will cause them to fall off or flip over to the sides or bottom when baking. I think I baked them for about 15 minutes since we used a medium size ice cream scooper."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly! I did NOT substitue anything. These are fabulous. The only thing I did extra was to knead the dough in the bowl for about 1 min after all ingredients were mixed in. Make sure to not overbake. These should come out of the oven while they are still slightly puffed as they continue to cook (and become hard) while cooling on the pan."
"1","5","Fantastic - the best sugar cookie recipe I have found and incredibly easy. My kids and I rolled them in red sugar for a festive Christmas look. My oldest is a confirmed chocoholic but she couldn't stop eating these...and neither could I!"
"1","5","The perfect sugar cookie! I didn't have enough butter so I used a half cup of unsalted butter and half cup of margarine. I used mushy butter and margarine that I let vanilla. I gradually add and stirred the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until it was thoroughly incorporated. I used about 3/4 of a tablespoon each and rolled into balls. I slightly wet/moistened half of the ball tops with water and then dipped the tops into white and colored sugar mixtures (one mixture white & red and other white & green for Christmas). To experiment, I rolled the other balls into the sugar mixture without moistening first and the sugar stayed. Then I took a glass bottom and pressed down to almost flatten to 1/4 inch. I cooked for just 6 minutes at 375 and the cookies sit in the cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper) for a few minutes before transferring to cookie rack. Of the two types, I think the cookies that I rolled in the sugar mixture without moistening looked best since the sugar looked more uniform. My husband does not care for sweets too much but he had a few of these cookies and wanted more. I asked him to keep his hands off my cookies - these are going out as Christmas gifts and I'll be bringing these to a Christmas party. I'll also be making these year round for the other holidays. You can dress up these cookies for any occasion. A recipe for life. YUMMY!"
"1","5","this is a great tasting recipe... easy, And not hard to make...I also put chocolate morsels in the dough, and that was tastey..."
"1","5","Best sugar cookie I've ever eaten. Loved the flavor. Perfect as is!"
"1","5","I made these cookies at the end of an 'unlucky' day of baking. These turned out really well, are quite tasty and my boyfriend cant stop dipping them in his coffee! I baked for 8 minutes and they're soft and tasty."
"1","3","I used room temp butter and baked for no more than 8 minutes, but they didn't seem as good a couple of hours later. They became too crunchy for my taste. Still fine, just not exceptional."
"1","4","I thought these cookies were pretty good for how easy they were. I baked mine 7.5 min, for a nice soft cookie. Very easy!"
"1","5","If your butter is at room temp and you cream together the sugar, butter, and egg before you add the other ingreadents you will never have a bit of trouble baking these. 8 minutes was the perfect time for mine. They are the best sugar cookie on the web. Simply awesome."
"1","5","It was extremely easy to make! Will do it again."
"1","5","WOW! My little girl and I decided to make these one afternoon. We didn't have baking soda or baking powder, so we used self-rising flour in place of the all-purpose flour. These cookies were amazing! We baked them for 9 minutes and they were perfect. This will now be my one and only sugar cookie recipe!"
"1","3","The flavor of these cookies is good, but I have made them twice now and they were kind of dry. I let the butter soften overnight after reading a different review just to make sure and nothing changed. Also they do not spread out I had to use a fork to squish them down. But the flavor is good like I said."
"1","4","These were super easy and pretty darn good! My dough came out a bit dry so I added margarine and I left out the vanilla because I am living overseas and haven't found any yet. Everyone enjoyed these and I will make these cookies again. These were a little taste of home for the Christmas season. Thanks!"
"1","5","There isn't a more delicious and easy recipe for a sugar cookie out there! Found this recipe in a quick pinch and it is fabulous! Thank you for sharing!!"
"1","4","They are good, definitely will make these again. I will be searching for a recipe that stays chewy longer but I am eating day after cookie for this recipe and it still isn't brittle so this is great and EASY!"
"1","5","Made 3 easy changes based on what I had in the house: used 100% whole wheat flour, Billington's Unrefined Caster Sugar in place of white, and on the advice of another reviewer, upped the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons. The cookies turned out perfect! They're easy & quick to make. They cool fast & firm up perfectly. Our family loved the texture, too! Thank you for a great recipe, Stephanie!"
"1","5","Subbed mint flavouring in for the vanilla, added mint candies to it, sprinkled coloured sugar when they were hot out of the oven. Totally easy Christmas cookies!!!"
"1","5","I love this cookie and so did my family. They are delicious and turned out perfect following the directions. I cut back on the sugar a little... the cookie reminded me of a cross between sugar and shortbread tasting...yum! My son is requesting more and I just baked them yesterday:)"
"1","5","These sugar cookies are wicked awesome, and wicked easy to make! I added a little extra sugar the second time because I have a sweet tooth, but it is not really necessary unless you are making them for kids then add more sugar. Thanks to this super simple recipe."
"1","5","These are so good!!! I made them last night for the second time.   I do end up baking them on our stoneware for much longer than the prescribed 8-10 minutes: it's closer to 20 minutes of time."
"1","5","YES THERE GREAT AND EASY"
"1","1","(substituted splenda) Cookies did not change shape - stayed in their little round balls, and then turned to dust as soon as we touched them. Added about 2T of milk to the rest and flattened them by hand, plus made them bigger. Milk helped them stick together, but still taste dusty on outside but with a slight gooey center."
"1","5","This recipe is the easiest sugar cookie recipe I have found. Cookies were GREAT!!"
"1","4","I just made these cookies exactly as the recipe says. I made sure the margarine was completely softened to a liquid state. Since my mixer is broken, I mixed everything by hand. I should have added more vanilla, though. However, they turned out wonderfully. I did not use a scooper, but I did use a teaspoon to plop them on the cookie sheets. This is a great recipe to have in your back pocket. They take just a few minutes to bake!"
"1","5","These cookies were great, and just what I had been seeking for such a long time. They are crisp and crunchy on the outside, while maintaining just the right amount of soft chewiness on the inside. The cookies really do expand, and in my opinion come out better if you don't try to flatten the balls after placing them on the sheet. Even without flattening you can add raw sugar or sprinkles to the tops that will come out nicely when baked. As others have stated, adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla can really improve the flavor; also, make sure that your butter/margarine is extremely soft- if you think it's soft enough, give it an extra few minutes anyway. Thanks for this recipe!"
"1","5","AWESOME. My husband just made a wistful comment about wanting sugar cookies after seeing a commercial for the refrigerated tube-o-dough. I am no baker/chef, but thought I could do better than that stuff. I quietly slipped downstairs and came back with these, made exactly as written. He promptly ate half a dozen, then hid the rest of them somewhere. Thanks for making me a SuperWife today!!"
"1","5","I wanted a cookie that would melt a little in the oven, and still be chewy. This is it! :) I melted my butter a little more than I meant to but I wasn't worried about it since the softer the butter the better. I wouldn't recommend melting it completely, but a little melt is okay. the dough is super soft and squishy, picks up sprinkles well, and it puffs a little in the oven. I take them out when you can just see a little light brown on the edges, and let them sit on the pan for a minute, where the puff settles and they are flat and perfect :) thank you!"
"1","3","These were very breakable cookies. When I picked them up they just came apart. Also they were too sweet to eat. I would not say they were the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted."
"1","4","Modified this recipe for dairy free. Used butter flavored crisco and water instead of butter and milk. Dough needed a bit more flour, and I always add a little extra vanilla. Cookies turned out beautiful and delicious, with just the right crisp to chew ratio. I will make again."
"1","5","Amazing flavor!"
"1","5","Perfect. I used maple extract instead of vanilla, because that's what I had, but they were perfect. I rolled these out and used cookie cutters without changing the recipe, didn't have to refrigerate at all, love it."
"1","5","My daughter and niece both 10 years old made these cookies by themselves and they were fantastic. I reminded me of the sugar cookie my mom made when I was little. I have been searching for a recipe that compared for many years I have now found it."
"1","5","Amazing man, try it. Just follow steps or else they'll look like biscuits ya know? { what happened on my first time OuO }"
"1","5","I added 2 tsp of cinnamon to these and bakes for 8 minutes and they were perfect! Next time I'll try them without the cinnamon!"
"1","2","Tried 3 different batches altering ingredients a bit per other reviews. Cookies did not spread much so ended up over cooked on the bottom and nearly raw in the middle. Most of it ended up in the trash. Bummer cuz otherwise quick & easy"
"1","5","This recipe is fantastic, super easy and delicious. Plus since its so simple you can add toppings without clashing flavors."
"1","5","I followed this recipe as is, and these are the easiest, best tasting sugar cookies!!! I really recommend you try again"
"1","5","not only is the dough yummy but the cookie is also!! very easy very fast. i totally enjoyd it!"
"1","4","I tried this recipe a week or so ago and it turned out okay. The dough was a little tough but I figured out a solution.  The second batch I made I added about 1/4-1/2 cup less flour and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I also melted the butter before I put it in. Then, as another person has said, I only put them in for 8 minutes. They were soft and delicious.  I also use this recipe for snicker doodles, I just toss the balls of dough in cinnamon and sugar first"
"1","5","Love these!! They were soooo delicious!"
"1","2","Hate it. I was ashamed to have let my family eat them. I followed all the directions and they came out tasting bland and with no flavor."
"1","5","These cookies were awesome. However I did add 1/4 more tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of salt for my own personal taste. It made them perfect!"
"1","5","This was my first time baking cookies from scratch and they came out perfect. Excellent, excellent, excellent, soft and chewy!"
"1","3","It is too sticky to put in balls right after making. I put it in the fridge overnight and baked it the next day and it came out fine. I will make it again."
"1","5","Tasty, pretty and EASY. I rolled the dough in to a one inch ball, flattened it half way then added sprinkles. Oven time was 8 min, then sit for 2 in the pan, then to the cooling rack. They looked and tasted great!"
"1","5","They turner out fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and baked for exactly 8 minutes. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
"1","5","Yummy!!! Not too sweet-just right! And super easy!"
"1","1","I read MANY reviews of this recipe. After following the recipe exactly (softened butter, etc) and the dough still turned out like crumbles, I tried a few reviewers suggestions and added another egg, 1/2tsp more vanilla, 1 tsp salt and a touch of milk. Cookies still came out like dry flour balls. You could barely taste the sugar. The only recommendation I can think of is to use a lot less flour next time."
"1","5","Delicious, quick & easy. I found the batter was a bit dry so I used 2 eggs & 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. They turned out beautifully & so yummy! Will definitely bake these again & again!"
"1","5","These cookies turned out well and my kids told me, 'good job Mom!' I put M&M's in them too. I had the butter really soft and even added an extra tablespoon. Egg was room temp and I stirred in the dry ingredients by spoon. Baking them for exactly 8 minutes was perfect. Yummy!"
"1","5","We used the very soft butter and added a little pumpkin spice. And a little pumpkin candy to top it"
"1","5","Delicious sugar cookies! Read the other helpful reviews, and they were right - removing the cookies from the oven at precisely 8 minutes is the secret to soft sugar cookies. They're a little doughy in the middle, but buttery and delish for it!"
"1","5","Delicious cookies!! I read some of the other reviews and let my butter soften completely. I think that helped. I doubled the batch and made them CD sized for my sons science class to decorate like Cells. Doubling the batch gave me 36 large sized cookies!"
"1","1","I hated these cookies. I Am always looking for a good cookie recipe and i thought i found one when i read the reviews and everyone thought the were good.These cookies are gross!"
"1","1","They're extremely dry, and if you were hoping to use this recipe with cookie cutters (which I was) then don't even bother."
"1","5","Easy and delicious! I did add an extra egg since the dough seemed dry and rolled them in sugar before baking, they came out sooo good!"
"1","5","Terrific! These cookies came out AMAZING!"
"1","3","It was ok I guess turned out good just not the right recipe for me"
"1","5","The easiest & best sugar cookie recipe ever! Would not change a thing!"
"1","5","I made these cookies this evening and they are really good! I only baked them for 8 minutes to ensure that they would be softer. I also doubled the amount of vanilla, just in case, and I also added M&Ms for fun. So delicious! My husband loved them! I will definitely make them again. It is an easy and quick treat to make!"
"1","5","Took by total surprise how good the cookies turned out. My 13 yrs old found this recipe and wanted to try it. First time making cookies from scratch. The cookies were soft and absolutely yummy. How can a simple and easy recipe produce such great cookies? Many thanks to the author!!!"
"1","5","This recipe turned out great...only two adjustments...used slightly less flour...seemed too crumbly otherwise and also substituted 1/4 of brown sugar for the white. Yummy! Great texture and taste compared to typical sugar cookies. Yummy without anything else added."
"1","5","I think I just made the best sugar cookies in the world!!! This is a fantastic recipe. I did add about 1/8 tsp salt. Because I can't cook/bake/eat anything without adding a bit of salt. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was a bit crumbly, and I was nervous they wouldn't turn out so great, but they were perfect! This recipe is definitely going in my recipe box!!! Thanks for a sugar cookie recipe that I can fix in under 30 minutes for my kids...they don't even have time to act like maniacs about getting cookies since I don't have to put the dough in the fridge!!!"
"1","3","I made a mistake and didn't read the reviews before making them, my dough was crumbly and hard to shape I realize now that is coz the butter wasn't soft enough it didn't spread enough while baking and came out very thick although I only used teaspoonful balls and it really made 4 dozens. I will try another batch with soft butter if my kids like it It's too sweet for me."
"1","5","Sugar cookies are my FAV... and this recipe is perfect!"
"1","5","Perfect sugar cookies! Easy ingredients, fast cooking time. My family loves buttery chewy soft cookies and this recipe accomplishes this. If you are looking for cut out type of sugar cookies this will not work. I cooked these on middle rack in a toaster oven at 350 degrees for 7-8 minutes. I added 2 tsp. Vanilla, 2 cups sugar, and 1&1/2 cup butter instead if what was stated."
"1","5","my husband loves sugar cookies. So I went on the hunt for an easy quick recipe. Came upon this one 3 years ago. It is his favorite. He is picky especially about his treats."
"1","2","this is not the best recipe for sugar cookies they turned out all gooey with a lot of butter tasting in it......."
"1","5","easy and yummy"
"1","5","i love it and i changed the serving size to 24 and i put a whole egg instead of the half suggested"
"1","1","After reading both good and bad reviews I decided I would give the cookies a try. Had I read the review about making sure the butter was to be almost liquified before mixing it would of saved me. The recipe made as directed came out very dry and crumbly, but I managed to get the dough to stick together enough to roll a dozen cookies and baked away. After taking one bite the entire dozen, along with the rest of dough went into the garbage, it tasted doughy and dry. Whoever posted this recipes needs to make a change to recipe and the directions so others will not waste the time or ingredients on a bad batch of cookies!"
"1","2","I have no idea what happened.. I did exactly what I was told and my batter was so wet that I couldn't make balls. It was almost like pancake batter. They came out moist (obviously) and an alright texture, but the flavor was extremely lacking. They didn't taste good at all."
"1","5","I am giving this recipe five stars not because these are the best cookies ever, but they are really yummy sugar cookies that are so incredibly EASY! I've been making these to serve to guests coming for baby visits the last few months, so I've probably made this recipe five times already, and everybody compliments them. I can whip them up in an hour, from start to finish (25 minute estimate in the recipe is very optimistic, although I bake them in 2-3 batches which makes it take longer). The rolling is the most time consuming part of the whole recipe, takes me about 20 minutes working quickly. I roll out the little dough balls and then give them a little press on a plate full of sprinkles. They come out perfectly. When I'm done I freeze them and they keep really well. As other reviewers said, I let the butter get completely soft before making these. And for my oven, 8 minutes is a maximum before they start getting too brown."
"1","4","These were really easy to make and they turned out wonderfully! I added some cinnamon and a tad bit more vanilla. Very good recipe!"
"1","4","I made mini sugar cookies with this recipe. It's really delicious, but I expected a bit more flavor."
"1","5","Amazing and simple with all the flavor. Made with butter first and was a runny batter but a good taste and chewy. Made with margariine and was different but still chewy. Do the recipe with butter! Easy! Good!"
"1","5","I have made these several times and each time has been perfect! I have received more compliments about them! After I roll them, I roll the dough in sugar so they are completely covered. Oh! And I made them pink and put a Hershey Kiss on them for my niece's sweet 16 :)"
"1","4","great recipe. I think they are a little too sweet for me, but my friends loved them"
"1","5","Love this recipe! It is very easy to make and only takes about 30 minuets with no fridge cool time. Used homemade icing with them to make thumbprint cookies and they were delicious!"
"1","5","Such an easy recipe. I melted unsalted butter under low heat while I mixed the dry ingredients. I let the butter cool before adding it to the dry ingredients and added the egg last. The dough does come out a little crumbly, but if you knead it a bit, it smooths out. I made bouncy-ball sized balls and pushed them flat in the middle with a spoon before baking. Make sure your oven temperature is right by using an in-oven thermometer (you can get them at the $0.99 cent store). Take them out after exactly 8 minutes, let them cool on the pans for an additional 2-3 minutes before attempting to move them. They will seem under-cooked, but they're fine. You can push M&Ms or Hershey's Kisses into them at this point if you want, but I just sprinkled them with regular, granulated sugar. They were a big hit at my husband's work the following day. Great recipe, thanks!"
"1","5","Mmmmm"
"1","5","its good"
"1","5","This is SUCH an amazing recipe!!! I cannot get enough of these cookies. They are VERY buttery and sweet, which is great for me, but may not be for others. If you are not a fan of buttery goodness, then I would definitely suggest cutting down on the amount of butter you use. Also, I used 2 and 1/4 cups flour, because the original amount seemed quite large to me. Turned out amazing. The dough was also incredibly easy to work with, not too crumbly or liquidy. One thing I can suggest is to thickly layer them on the baking sheets. Mine turned out quite thin. Definitely try making thicker balls."
"1","5","This is an excellent sugar cookie recipe!!  For anyone who found it dry, I noticed that the dough was dry just after I mixed it.  I added one more egg to the batter, mixed it and rolled the dough into balls.  The cookies turned out soft and delicious!   I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is an excellent easy recipe that yields soft delectable cookies!  Just add two eggs instead of one if you find your dough too dry."
"1","5","Love this recipe!! So easy and you can add any kind of candy to make different types of cookies :)"
"1","4","I've tasted better BUT for a super easy recipe, this is it, hands down. I will be messing with the recipe too later to get it gluten free. I did however use 1/2c maple syrup and 1 cup sugar. They turned out fine."
"1","5","I love this recipe! I have had tons of success with it too! I make sure my butter is practically melted before using, double the egg, and use about 1.5 of the vanilla and they are fabulous!!!! My kids love rolling them in colored sugar before baking too, they turn out beautiful AND tastey!"
"1","5","Everyone loves them. I have made them for friends, co-workers, and family. I like to make them rise more, creating more puffiness. Based on other reviews I learned to do this by substituting the baking soda with baking powder. I love learning where and how to adjust the ingredients through reviews."
"1","5","Perfect! We rolled the balls in sugar before we baked them and it added a little flair."
"1","1","I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out flatter than a pancake and hard as rocks."
"1","5","This is a very nice cookie, especially for the simplicity of the recipe. I used *unsalted* butter so I added 1/2 tsp salt (next time, I think 1/4 tsp will be enough). I also replaced the 1 tsp vanilla extract with 3/4 tsp *each* vanilla extract and orange extract, and the orange flavor was definitely noticeable but not over-powering. The dough was a bit crumbly so I shaped it into balls by hand (48 balls at 20g each, about a tablespoon). It is sticky enough to hold together with just a tiny squeeze, and not so sticky as to be difficult to work with. I baked them for 9 minutes but I am at a high altitude; 8 min would probably be perfect at sea level. Regardless of exact baking time, I could tell they were ready when cracks had started to form across the tops (but not too much...more/bigger cracks = crunchier cookie). They spread to about 2.25' diameter and flattened a tad more as they cooled. They had crispy edges, chewy centers, golden bottoms and creamy, unbrowned tops. I didn't bother sprinkling mine with sugar but if you like sweeter cookies, you might want to do that (plus, it's pretty)."
"1","5","As written this recipe is really good. They got scarfed up in no time. I did play around with the recipe a bit and found that if you use 1/2 cup softened butter, 1/2 cup butter-flavored Crisco, 2 eggs and 2 tsp. vanilla they come out perfect too. I use a cookie scoop and they all come out the same size and look perfect. I even made some using only 1 cup sugar and I thought they tasted better (but then I like a not-so-sweet sugar cookie). I had to make a batch two nights in a row for 'testing' purposes."
"1","5","Super easy and super tasty."
"1","5","i hate to say perfect, but they pretty much are."
"1","5","Best and easiest recipe coming from a kids prospective. I use palm oil in chunks instead of butter and they come out even better because it has no taste but even coconut butter adds not taste to the cookies after they have been cooked"
"1","4","I'm sharing this recipe for my friends with kids. You don't have to worry about getting the butter soft enough when you have kids that are molding the dough and making shapes.  I did valentine cookies with these today with my 3 year old and 19 month old today. It was the absolute best consistency for them to work with.  Plus they are perfect for adding sprinkles and candies and food coloring.  I'm not sure they were the best tasting I've ever had, but they were good. I'm sure they didn't come out picture perfect, but how much of that was due to all of the handling we did?  The recipe is super easy, and we were able to make and stir the ingredients together. I let the stand mixer handle creaming the butter and sugar.  Saving this recipe for future kid projects."
"1","2","to much butter for my taste. :("
"1","5","This was my first time making the cookies, and they turned out perfectly! Very easy and delicious recipe. Will definitely use again and again."
"1","5","Sub the butter for green butter. Time of your life."
"1","5","Add cinnamon? BEST. SNICKERDOODLES. EVER. Reduce the cooking time, of course, to make them extra chewy."
"1","5","This was the best sugar cookie I have ever made! It was easy with typical ingredients. I am too lazy to make so many cutout cookies during the holidays, so I just do round cookies and decorate with holiday frostings and decorations. These cookies were so delicious that my family didn't even want them decorated."
"1","1","I used this recipe with my kids for a Christmas party but when they came out of the oven we tried them and they were like sugary cardboard."
"1","4","These cookies are wonderful, even though I am not a huge fan of sugar cookies. They are soft and moist rather than hard and crumbly like a lot of sugar cookie recipes. I make these for Christmas every year. Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies but the trick is in the butter. Make sure it is super soft but not melted. I now make these every holiday and the family goes coo coo."
"1","4","I like this recipe for its simplicity. Very easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand. I read some of the reviews about it being bland so I upped the vanilla as suggested to 2 teaspoons and threw in some cinnamon for good measure. I also pulled them out early since I like my cookies soft. I'm glad I added the cinnamon and extra vanilla because they are a bit bland. I tried the whole cookie cutter into holiday shapes things and they expanded so much it was hard to tell the shapes apart. Maybe it would have worked out better if I had actually decorated them but I'm not interested in heading back to the store. My roommates bf says he really likes them."
"1","5","SUPER EASY and fun to make with kids :)"
"1","5","Very easy and so good! This is definitely kid-friendly.. made it with my 3-year-old and we had so much fun decorating them with colored sugar, sprinkles, and M&M's before baking them."
"1","5","Very easy to prepare! Soft, light cookie with great buttery flavor. I didn't want to mess with cookie cutters and rolling pins, just wanted to ice the cookies and decorate with sprinkles, worked out great. I followed other reviewers' advice and cooked for 8 minutes, turned out great. 5 stars for super easy with good taste"
"1","4","Well this was my first time making them and I must say it was delish..They were good but needed a few adjustments that I thought woul d work ..a half of tsp of baking powder, don't be afraid of butter + sugar ( as my mom says). Mine came out like little biscuits and tasted like a biscuit LOL, it wasn't much flavor,but I asked the family and they gave me pointers (Little brother said it tasted salty and plain) LOLOL!! But I am excited to make more!! xx"
"1","5","This recipe was so simple to do and the cookies were great!!. This is certainly a kid friendly recipe to do with your children or child. My daughter and I enjoyed making them. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","AMAZING! if you want to make fast and easy cookies these are what you want to make! i made it with just my ingredients at home!"
"1","5","These are great and so easy to make! My 3 year old and I just made a batch and are about to frost them. Made bigger balls for bigger cookies and they came out perfect. I baked for 10 minutes and used 2 eggs instead of one because I had an overeager egg cracker."
"1","5","Great cookies...very easy to make...taste great...will make again soon...I made one batch and they were very good but I like more flavor so I put 2 tsp vanilla extract in the next batch..."
"1","5","I made these cookies yesterday and they are amazing. They turned out perfect and they were perfectly round. I totally recommend this recipe to everyone out there. So good!!!!!"
"1","4","My go to basic sugar cookie recipe. Easy and simple. No rolling or pounding. :P Made this at a Whole Foods cooking for toddlers class. My kids loved it then and in our own kitchen. Not too sweet and not dry at all."
"1","5","I've made these several times with good success. I've used it with cinamon sugar to make a quick snicker doodle, which the family really enjoys. Just an FYI, the reason I'm writing this review is because last night I accidentally melted the butter instead of softening it. You should know that if you try to bake the cookies imediately therafter, they'll come out thin and probably a little extra crispy. So, I just finished the dough and put it in the regrigerator for an hour or so. They backed up perfectly after that.  This recipe is almost fool proof in my opinion."
"1","5","These were so delicious! I am not a huge fan of sugar cookies but these came out perfect. Just make sure your butter is nice and mushy before using it. :) They looked and tasted like heaven. I experimented with different lengths of oven time, I started with 11 minutes in the oven and worked my way down to 7 minutes. I have to say, 8 minutes in my oven made them turn out perfect. When I sparkled sugar on them and put them on a platter (attached picture) it was too tempting to NOT take a picture with how pretty these are! I am going to use this recipe again and again, no doubt."
"1","5","Excellent recipe!! These cookies are delicious. I have been searching for a sugar cookie recipe for years and finally hit the jackpot! After reading some of the other reviews, I added an extra tsp of vanilla and rolled them in sugar before baking. I baked them for only 8 mins even though I was tempted to keep them in longer but they turned out perfectly. I finally received compliments on my sugar cookies!"
"1","5","I made this recipe in a rush for my daughter's birthday party at school. Her classmates were raving about them!! Thank you for an easy, mom-friendly recipe! :)"
"1","5","I tried this recipe it was so easy to make it took less then 30 minutes I suggest this to people who want to make something quickly."
"1","5","my sister and i DID THIS RECIPE LOVED IT we had a blast and the cookies came out really good if we say so ourselves easy to make and if you wanna make them how we did we added white frosting and SPRINKLES to make the cookies less plain :) easy to follow and make sure the butter is EXTRA SOFT AND ADD MORE FLOUR but other than that GREAT!!!(BEWARE COOKIES SPREAD SO MAKE LITTLE COOKIES AND OR FAR APART)"
"1","5","Perfect. Only thing is I have to triple this recipe because my family likes larger cookies!"
"1","5","This was a great, simple recipe. The first time I made it I did add a bit more vanilla extract and about a half a cup of Skim Plus skim milk (to make the dough more like dough and not flour with bits of butter in it). Also, remember to completely soften the butter before mixing! It will help you so much down the road. Otherwise, these are quick and easy to make - going to make another batch tonight to bring into work tomorrow!"
"1","5","Worked perfectly. Made it tons of s=times and shared the recipe with a friend who loooved it."
"1","4","I recommend adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and chill the dough for 30-60 minutes so its easy to roll(about 1/4'-1/2' thick) and sprinkle powdered sugar on parchment paper out and roll the dough out ontop of it. Bake at 350 about 7 minutes. ------That way is a great base recipe you can use it for almost any kind of sugar cookie w/ added ingredients. I made these and added 2Tablespoons of mint and 2Tablespoons of lemon extract and they were great mint~lemon cookies. These sugar cookies are now my go to recipe for sweets and I will stop buying junk food from the stores and make these, I have 4 daughters and they all love cooking, so we will keep this around. ---I love this recipe after my changes above."
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. i bake a ton of yummy things from this site and never have i been so upset!"
"1","4","Good and chewy at 8 minutes. 11 minutes made them hard when cooled. If you wait until they brown, as the recipe says, they will be overcooked. Mine came out flat, but I didn't refrigerate the dough first. If you want them taller, refrigerate the dough before shaping. I dipped the top in colored sugar crystals before baking."
"1","2","Rather bland -- and this even after I increased the vanilla. Also a bit dense. I have made these twice, hoping they would be better the second time but was disappointed both occasions. There are yummier sugar cookies out there. This one does have the advantage of not being too sweet, however."
"1","5","This is hands down the easiest, and tastiest, cookie I have ever made! This is always a special request from my husband when his bandmates come over. I make the full batch (about 40 cookies) and between three guys....they are all gone! I would highly recommend this for anyone who is a beginner (like me) and who loves the fresh taste of homemade cookies! I've found that baking at abou 8-9 minutes gives the cookies that 'doughy' center that everyone loves, and makes it to where they are not overly hard and crunchy! I've also added bite sized candies (Reeses, M&M's, and chocolate chips) to the batter to make it a bit more fun! Yummy!"
"1","3","i added a little water to the mix. The dough was crumbly. 1/8 cup of water made the dough stick together better. The finished product was really good!"
"1","5","This was great! try adding 3/4 of butter, and the rest maple syrup!!!"
"1","5","OMG!!! This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever used!! They are totally foolproof and absolutely delicious... I also make awesome snikerdoodles with the dough.. Thank you for submitting such a great recipe. On a scale of 1 to 10 these are an 11!! Theresa Haines"
"1","5","very easy to find !"
"1","5","I tried the recipe and its sooo good my daughter loves it. thanks for the recipe.."
"1","5","Super easy cookies. Made with white whole wheat flour and egg beaters because that is what I had on hand. Melted the margarine as others have noted and the cookies were great. My scooper is big so it only made 30 cookies."
"1","3","I thought the flavor was good but the texture was like a muffin."
"1","5","These cookies are soo good I have made them a few times. For sure 8 minutes is the right amount to bake them and I added some lemon zest, white chocolate and coconut and made an amazing treat everyone ate them up and raved about how good they were. I also tried with some lemon zest and blueberries. They were a total hit!! Next I think I might try some coconut and chocolate.. YUMMY!!"
"1","5","Perfect exactly as the recipe is posted~! I have made alot of sugar cookies, these are not the kind you can use cutters on, but they are quick and more tasty! I make sure my cookie ingredients are room temp and well blended, it makes a better cookie."
"1","5","love it tried it and it came out perfect and taste even better"
"1","5","I agree with other reviews- definitely bake for 8 minutes, not 10. They end up perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Very, very, very delicious.  Also, I whipped up some icing really quick and dipped the tops in the icing after about 3 minutes of cooling the cookies. Awesome!!! I just mix half&half, water and powdered sugar to make the icing. Not too sweet, but very very yummy. :) Also, just add a little food coloring to make it any color you want!!! I will always use this recipe for sugar cookies from now on. :)"
"1","4","love it. Took me all of maybe 15 mins to make. I put 24 in the serving metric. they came buttery, light and sooo yummy. I replaced the vanilla with lemon juice simply because I had none on hand. I used a fork to cream the sugar and stick of butter.. put some dough on a table soon rounded into a ball and put on pan. PERFECT!! when you change the serving to 24 from the original 48 it will say 1/2 egg but I used a whole medium egg. Do try!"
"1","5","My kitchen is the kitchen where great cookie recipes come to die. However I was able to bake these cookies to absolute perfection (according to me) The only thing I changed was that I used almond flavoring! Turned out great! Very easy!"
"1","5","This isn't my usual sugar cookie recipe but I do love how they turns out. Very easy, wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","This recipe was very easy to follow, and the resulting cookies were delicious!"
"1","2","I made this recipe with a friend. We followed the recipe perfectly, but it does not say how far apart to put them. All of the cookies blended together and we now have to clean up a HUGE mess!!!!! Do not bother making these unless you have at least 4 cooking sheets."
"1","5","I just finished making these and they taste great. I followed the directions exactly except for the baking powder and used self-rising flour. They are just a little flat but taste really good."
"1","5","I substituted baking powder for the baking soda and confectioners sugar for the granulated sugar, and they still tasted great! Such good, easy and quick cookies. Will make them whenever i have 30 minutes to spare!"
"1","1","I used smart balance light in stead of butter, they taste terrible."
"1","5","This was the best sugar cookie I have ever had...Easy and great tasting.I have made it twice now.8 mins for chewy, 12 for crispy edges but soft centers.The BEST....."
"1","5","I made these for my little sister and she loved them! I'm not a huge fan of sugar cookies in general, but these were actually pretty good! I was surprised how well they came out. Watch the serving size though because it makes a LOT!"
"1","5","These are super yummy! Mine turned out perfect and this is definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","My second sheet is currently in the oven! I Love these! They were easy, they look great and are perfect size!"
"1","5","This is probably the 100th sugar cookie recipe I have tried, and this one by far, it the best! The cookies come out super soft with a great taste!! Make sure to soften your butter right, otherwise the dough will be crumbly. over all, I loved them and will be sharing this recipe with others!"
"1","5","I follow the recipe exactly every time. This is the ultimate sugar cookie recipe, it makes the PERFECT sugar cookies. Crisp on the outside, buttery, and soft and chewy on the inside. Love love love this recipe."
"1","5","We thought these were great. Very easy to make. I used a 1Tb. cookie scoop so they were evenly proportioned and cooked them 8 minutes. They were just starting to brown. Crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Great flavor. Kids loved them."
"1","5","I really liked these cookies! I would recommend 8 minutes for bake time if you like chewy cookies. Also, I would recommend less vanilla extract. These also didn't make as many cookies as it said it would. I was going to make 48 (like it said) but instead it ended up making 33. They did spread a lot, so I would recommend smaller balls of dough. Also, make sure the butter has no chunks at all (even little tiny ones.) Other than that, these were really pleasing. I would definitely recommend these to a friend. :)"
"1","3","Good recipe but the butter and oils need some serious adjustment I tried just the butter and it was too dry but together too oily good luck."
"1","5","This was by far hands down the best sugar cookie I have EVER tasted!!! It was easy to make all of the ingredients are ones you always have so on a dull day this is sure to make things bright! Soft, Chewy, and not time consuming and with twins this is a Tremendous plus!!! Added to my quick n easy recipe box ;)"
"1","3","I have used this recipe in the past and never had the issues I did today usually the dough is perfect but today it did nothing but crumble on me and I followed it exactly but the taste is still amazing its just I am very disappointed at how bad the dough crumbled"
"1","5","I just made these and they are to DIE FOR. Tastiest sugar cookie recipe EVER!"
"1","5","I love these, I made them without the vanilla, adding lemon extract instead. Then drizzled with lemon drizzle whilst still hot! They're delicious! :)"
"1","4","Nice recipe. Easy to make. I used sugar substitute: splenda/sucralose, which is the best artificial sweetener to use for baking. It measures the same as sugar. I also added cinnamon to the second batch to turn them into snicker-doodle cookies."
"1","5","I made these exactly as written and they turned out amazing. They were very quick and easy. People are already begging me to make more!"
"1","5","I used these as a base for snickerdoodles and they turned out very well."
"1","5","Perfect sugar cookies. Mine were a little bigger and needed a few more minutes in the oven than the recipe said but yum! They would be great with a thick icing on top or with hershey kisses baked in the middle. Loved em!"
"1","5","these cookies came out so perfect! They looked really attractive, and they came off of the baking sheet so clean that it made me smile :) this is a no fail recipe if you need something fast and easy"
"1","5","Yum, yum, yum! This is an amazing recipe and 8 or 9 minutes was the best time for soft chewy cookies!"
"1","4","I just made these to make a friut pizza and it turned out GREAT.. It was easy and fast.. they are great sugar cookies.."
"1","1","This is the worst recipe I've ever made. I liked the sounds of it as it did not require shortening or refridgeration and all of the reviews on the app were very positive. But despite making them (exactly as the recipe stated) they tasted awful. Actually, to be more precise...they are tasteless."
"1","5","Great base sugar cookie!! Do not over-bake and you will get crispy outside/chewy inside cookies. Will definitely make again. Kids loved them!"
"1","1","They tasted like cornbread, the dough was good and it was fun baking but they tasted so awful the bottoms burned before the dough was even cooked."
"1","1","WAAAAAY too crumbly even with melted butter. Adding an extra egg helps."
"1","5","AWSOME my kids love it"
"1","5","Nice and easy recipe for kids. Turn out great. :)"
"1","2","did not like them. DEFINITELY not the best sugar cookies I have ever had, kinda chewy, a little tough."
"1","5","We LOVE this recipe. It was quick, easy and VERY tasty. The only thing I would mention is that mine came out much thinner than the picture - but they were still really great tasting and we are thin cookie lovers anyways!"
"1","5","I used this recipe when I was supposed to make chocolate chip cookies for a gathering. Oops! No brown sugar, but the butter was already softened. These came out so well that people thought they were from a bakery! I reduced the flour to 2 1/4 cups and made sure I got them out right at 8 minutes. Absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","They're super easy! Everyone has all the ingredients at home at all times."
"1","5","These are by far the BEST sugar cookies I have ever ate! They are so easy! I just sprinkle sugar on little balls and they turn out so delicious! I only put them in for 8 minutes because I like them soft."
"1","4","really goood. I made some bunny shaped ones for Easter, and they were a hit. definitely make some icing to top it off."
"1","5","These were easy and very good. The only thing that didn't go so well was rolling them out to use with cookie cutters. Perhaps I needed to chill them longer than just an hour. Also they didn't make as many as I though they would."
"1","1","IT IS VERY CRUMBLY,DOESNT TURN OUT"
"1","5","The name says it all....easy. Also very yummy."
"1","5","Much easier then the other recipes I have tried, where you chill and roll out the dough. Taste fantastic with less hassle. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! These were quick and easy and baked up perfectly. I'll never buy the refrigerated stuff again."
"1","5","This were super easy and really tasty. I tripled the vanilla and used real butter. Yummy!"
"1","5","Very easy! Perfect for quick sugar cookie!"
"1","5","Very easy. My 4 yr old daughter helped. We mixed it in our kitchen aid. I agree, the cookies don't look done when you take them out but if they cook longer will be too crisp. Used 2 tsp vanilla."
"1","2","This recipe was not good for shaped sugar cookies. They came out too flat and crispy."
"1","5","These cookies are really good! I baked them for 10-12 minutes and they were crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle!"
"1","5","Rolled them in cinnamon and sugar! They tasted like snickerdoodles."
"1","5","This is a great beginner cookie recipe. I can't bake to save my life! Seriously, I've fudged store bought cookie dough ( idk how) but this recipe, I Aced! Kid tested, Husband approved! Its a keeper!"
"1","5","These cookies were really yummy. My family ate them right up. I wouldn't change a thing about them."
"1","5","These cookies where great! I did three things that made these cookies even better! 1/8 tsp. Salt. 2 Tablespoons of lemon zest! and scooped them into Tbs balls and cooked for 12 mins. Perfect lemony treat!"
"1","5","Most amazing sugar cookie recipe ever! I added 1/4 t. Almond extract and added a total of 3 t. Vanilla and a tablespoon more sugar. Flavor is much better. They roll out just fine, just do it slow."
"1","5","All I need to say is, The grand kid's loved them :)"
"1","5","These are fantastic!!! I softened the margarine in the microwave for 10 seconds as I didn't want to wait for it to get to room temperature and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla (only due to me loving vanilla). I baked them for 8.5 minutes exactly and used a stand mixer on its lowest setting. These have just enough crisp on the outside to hold a beautifully soft cookie together. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!"
"1","5","Delicious and so easy! I scaled down to 12 cookies and used a whole egg (instead of the scaled down 1/4 egg). Made 12 cookies, spooning with a tablespoon rather than a teaspoon. I started and ended in less than 20 minutes!"
"1","3","This cookie although delicious tasted more like a pecan sandie sans the pecans. I think I was really looking for more of a sugar cookie reminiscent of those with the icing on them you purchase at the supermarket."
"1","5","These were very easy and delicious. I even used canola oil instead of butter, and they truned out wonderfully. I recommend cooking them only 8-9 minutes so that they stay soft."
"1","5","I made these for a quick snack, they were super easy. I used Shedd's Spread and about a quarter of a cup of Crisco I ran out of the margarine, also we love Cinnamon so I rolled them in sugar and cinnamon before baking soo Good"
"1","3","My mom loves them but I found them rather plain..."
"1","4","I made these, but made it 1 3/4 c sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.. also, after I rolled the cookies into balls, I rolled the cookie in sugar, then put it on the cookie sheet... made it look perfect with a sugar sheen on top and perfect crackles. These are so simple and SO delicious!!!"
"1","5","I dip 1/2 the cookie in chocolate and sprinkle on jimmies. They look like they came from a bakery!"
"1","3","Cookies are good however when made into simple ball shape. Not for making cookies in holiday shapes. The cookies expand too much when baking that you lose the original shape."
"1","4","Pretty good but needs a pinch of salt!"
"1","4","These were very good!!!!! I chose this recipe because it didn't need refridgeration, or rolling. Sugar cookies are my all-time favorite. I followed the recipe to the tee and they came out pretty buttery (never thought I'd say that) but maybe next time I will use less butter, or up the vanilla like another person suggested. Also, I ended up cooking mine for about 13 minutes...and I love my cookies very chewy and barely cooked. Maybe because my cookies turned out so big, they needed extra time. Either way, this will be my go-to sugar recipe!!"
"1","4","Very easy and tastes great!"
"1","5","Very quick with less ingredients and great taste to make!!! Fantastic!!"
"1","5","These sugar cookies were awesome! I did make sure that the butter was mush before mixing it in and our cookies turned out soft and delicious even after they had cooled. This has become my go to sugar cookie recipe."
"1","5","Love this recipe! The first time I found the flavor too buttery, so I double the vanilla and they're perfect. I make sure my butter is soft and I never bake more than 8 minutes (sometimes only 7). At Christmas, I let my 2- and 4-year-olds help by pressing the balls of dough I form into red and green sugar sprinkles before baking."
"1","4","These taste great, but they didn't spread out the way another reviewer had described. I ended up having to flatten the cookies on the first pan after the baking time had ended and they were still very round and very not done. The rest of the batch I flattened before baking with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. They turned out great and were great for the kids to decorate."
"1","4","Good cookies - dough was very dry and crumbled a lot. Added a teaspoon of rum and a tablespoon of water. Very yummy though - everyone loved them!"
"1","5","I had to come back and give this a review. This was a great recipe! I doubled the vanilla extract but that was the only change I made. It tastes great the original way but I prefer a stronger vanilla taste!   Based off of your own oven the time between 8-10 minutes varies I think! I've seen a lot of 8 minute suggestions but 9 minutes worked best for my cookies! And it actually makes a HUGE difference. Ten minutes was too long, 8 minutes too short and still a bit undercooked, 9 was perfect for my gas oven. Happy baking and thanks for this recipe!"
"1","5","Great recipe, just make sure you don't brown the cookies. I refrigerated the dough, then softened with a low microwave setting, and rolled to make shapes. The dough was crumbling, until it was nuked."
"1","5","Best sugar cookies I ever made! After reading many reviews I found that it must be true your butter has to be very soft. I left mine out over night and I used margarine. I made several batches some plain and some with Reese's peanut butter pieces some with chocolate. I took them out exactly at 8 minutes. Do not be decived by the way they look, they may appear not to be done, but once the cool the will be perfect. I believe the reason some people are having hard crumbly cookies is because the over cook them, remember they are sugar cookies not chocolate chip they will not be as brown. Follow the 8 minutes rule let cool for at least 1 min then put on cooling rack...it will be the best cookie you ever ate! Have fun with it and add whatever you like."
"1","1","Hard as rocks!!"
"1","4","I really loved the recipe! I did what others said on here and made sure the butter was soft (I let it melt for a little in the over). When I did the mixing everything was very dry so as I do with other recipes I added water. I did this for xmas, when I roled them into balls I put flour on the counter which took away the stickyness of the dough. Other than that the recipe came out great and taste delicious!!!!"
"1","5","These were fantastic! I did add another teaspoon of vanilla extract though."
"1","5","Easy and excellent! I frosted mine and were good plain or frosted."
"1","5","I bake everyday and needed a quick sugar cookie recipe- this was it- it was great! I did chill the dough for a few hours before rolling it out and cutting it with cookie cutters. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract but other than that, I did the recipe as is and it was great!"
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies i have ever made, just make sure the butter is soft. My Kids loved them. This recipe is a keeper, LOVE them"
"1","4","This is just the sugar cookie recipe I was looking for. My children wanted to make cut outs, and the dough rolled out very nicely, even without being chilled."
"1","5","My fiance & I make these about once a week! They're super easy and really good. Thanks!"
"1","5","WOW! I doubled the vanilla per others suggestion, and they are aweseome!. Soft inside crispy outside. I was sure to let the butter soften well. I rolled the doughin colored sugars and they have a nice cracking on top. Very pretty, VERY tasty!"
"1","5","I love these cookies!!! I've used this recipe twice so far and will always use it. One thing I do different is after rolling into balls, I roll them in sugar and flatten with a glass to about 1/2 thick, this makes them chewy/crispy, yumm!!"
"1","1","These were too dry, couldn't even roll the dough into balls to put into the oven.. maybe it was the altitude..?"
"1","5","Very Easy to make and delicious...we used sprinkles...next time maybe add the chocolate mints mentioned!"
"1","5","These are so easy and the cookies are a favorite each year. I add some color sugar on the top to make them a bit more festive."
"1","2","For my personal taste, these cookies didn't make the cut. They were easy to prepare; however, the dough was very dry, difficult to work with and the cookies came out flat and crispy. Will look for another recipe but thanks for sharing with everyone."
"1","5","Love these cookies!Will make them through out the year,not just at Christmas."
"1","5","These came out very good. I actualy used it as a substitute for the peanut butter cookie in peanut butter blossom cookies. My nephew has a peanut allergy but likes the way the cookie looks.. So I made sugar blossoms.. rolling the cookie in a mix of red, green and white sugar.. and topping it off with the kiss."
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies. To be honest, I don't even ordinarily like sugar cookies. For me, if its a cookie, it must have chocolate/chocolate chips. But these are AWESOME! I do not agree w/ other reviewers who claim you should use margarine. I do not keep it in my house b/c of the hydrogenated oil, I use butter and as long as the butter is COMPLETELY softened, they come out wonderful. Happy Baking!"
"1","5","Super easy recipe! My batch came out light and crispy. Not too sweet. I will definitely be making them again. These would be a nice treat with coffee or to dip in chocolate."
"1","5","its easy yummy and fun i like that"
"1","5","Excellent cookies! Very soft and yummy!"
"1","1","These cookies were not tasty at all. The cookies puff up too much because of the baking soda. I made them again using a different recipe and omitted the baking soda. Those were delicious. I won't be making these again."
"1","5","This is a great little recipe but I too, must emphasize that it is best when baked at 8 minutes. I added crushed candy canes without making any adjustments to the recipe and the cookies were lovely."
"1","5","Added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla and did half butter/half shortening. Had no eggs so I substituted mashed bananas (think baby food). Thanks!"
"1","5","thanks for a great recipe! I like a little more flavor then what a traditional sugar cookie offers so I add a little molasses and cinnamon...kind of make it a cross between a sugar cookie and a snickerdoodle lol. I also replace the egg with a 1/4 cup applesauce (egg allergy) and they came out great!!! I think I will try substituting with some pumpkin puree next. Happy Baking!"
"1","5","This is a very easy and simple recipe the cookies were delish.... I made them for my co-workers and the loved them"
"1","5","Added 1 tsp of lemon extract (in addition to the vanilla) and after mixing I made a tube shape out of the dough and rolled it in wax paper and let it sit in the fridge for 30 min. You can slice, spoon, or roll the dough to cut out shapes. Perfect cookies."
"1","5","These cookies are the best and SUPER easy to make. The only thing is we made 87! but thats not a bad thing!!!!"
"1","5","Amazing cookies! Made them for Thanksgiving and they turned out great! I allowed the butter to soften and almost become mushy, which made everything run smoother. It came out to make 48 regular sized cookie and a mini 49th. I would make these again in a heart-beat! Very, very sweet and delicious! Yum!"
"1","3","Mixture is very crumbly..It took more work than expected and had to add more butter to make it work. However, the finished product looks very pretty. I would not call this an easy cookie to make though."
"1","2","They were flavorless except for a funny after taste. They were very easy to make but I guess I am just partial to my grandmother's recipe that takes much longer....."
"1","5","I love this recipe!! It turns out amazing every time I make them. You can change it up and add different candies/nuts. I've given this recipe to many friends and family^-^"
"1","5","Very good! I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out perfect! The last few I add cherry chips...YUMMY!"
"1","5","Great cookies...needed no modification on my end."
"1","5","11/11 awesome. have butter very soft, i microwaved it to soften it."
"1","4","Delicious cookies! Light and sugary. I added candy corn on top when I took them out of the oven and those add an extra sweetness to them. Definitely made about 4 dozen, but they were kind of on the smaller size - they don't spread out as big as you think they might. Also, could probably bake for a minute or two past 10 minutes.  Overall, thanks for the recipe! One for the books!"
"1","5","This recipe turned out GREAT. I've not had much luck with several sugar cookie recipes, but these are great. I used margarine instead of butter and heated it in the microwave for 30 seconds until it was gooey and melty but not liquidy. The cookies were just the right consistency, very soft and moist. Very yummy!"
"1","5","These cookies were great and super easy to make.... the only thing that was different was that I added vanilla extract and the almond extract... and sprinkled with raw sugar and I used self rising flour minus the baking soda and powder... just wish they were a little more chewy.. but they were still great!! thank you!!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious!"
"1","5","I love this recipe because it is delicious, easy and uses ingrediants I always have at home. I also always add pecan peices!"
"1","5","Quit winkin at me Levi u Fruit Cake"
"1","5","This is an amazingly simple yet delicious sugar cookie. I made it and my family went nuts. I had some left over butter cream frosting and spread a little on top and the cookies just disappeared. Will be using this one again."
"1","5","I like to add a coco and brown sugar for a fun twist."
"1","5","Great Flavor and texture. I did what other reviewers said and added a bit more butter and a bit less flour. PERFECT! We used colored sugar crystals and they look beautiful too. Great recipe that we'll be using again!"
"1","5","I love them and I make them all the time. The first time anyone tastes them they say wow these are amazing. But I use margarine which works really well and I use a little more flour."
"1","5","This was a great quick recipe! I will definately be making it again!"
"1","5","Great cookies! At 8 minutes they come out perfect."
"1","5","best sugar cookie i've ever had."
"1","5","Absolutely fantastic. I doubled the vanilla for extra-vanilla-ey goodness."
"1","5","simple, but delicious :) i added a half teaspoon of almond extract with the vanilla, and it just boosted the flavor a little. Very good!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious. I love that they dont have to be refrigerated. They are pretty with colored sugar crystals on top"
"1","5","This is my new all time favorite sugar cookie recipe! These tasted better than the ones I buy at my local grocery store! My husband who is not a big cookie eater can not get enough of them!"
"1","4","Easy to make for a non-baker like myself and oh-so delicious to taste! This was really fun. The cookies came out perfect and I didn't even try really hard to be spot on perfect with this recipe. However, I agree with others, that next time, I'll add a bit more vanilla."
"1","5","My first try of making cookies and turn out great my husband and daughter love it. Thanks  BTW,I used Margarine instead of butter and turn out great as well! in no problem."
"1","5","my family downright loves these!!! A must have with a glass of milk but it is simply the best!!!"
"1","1","Made this recipe tonight. It turned out awful! Made it just like the instructions say.. Bad recipe!!!!"
"1","5","These are delicious sugar cookies. I followed the recipe as written. Used quite soft butter and didn't have a crumbling issue as some did. Next time I may increase the vanilla or try some almond extract. However, they are great as is."
"1","5","I gotta tell you, I was a little worried with this one. It was so crumbly. Looked more like the baking mix I put together the other day. I used butter shortening that was already room temp, but maybe a really soft butter would have been better. I used a pampered chef scoop, so they were larger than a teaspoon but I just had to go with it so they could be uniform. I still had to really shape them up. Due to this, they were taking forever to bake, they were still just round hard balls. So I decided to go ahead and squish them down with a fork, just like a peanut butter cookie. That gave me the opportunity to sprinkle them with sugar. I kept checking in 2 minute intervals until finally I thought they just had to be done. And they were. The second batch, I squished and sprinkled before they went in. That went better than I anticipated. I expected a crumble explosion, so I tried to also hold them so they wouldnt crumble to pieces and that seemed to work. So those didnt take as long to bake. Overall the flavor is great and if you are looking for sugar cookie flavor without all the wait, then this is for you. They look great all sprinkled up too, or you could easily drizzle with some icing. I wasn't holding out hope for this one, but they turned out really nice. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","These turned out better than expected especially since I substituted brown sugar for white sugar. It changed the taste from a traditional white sugar cookie and gave it the taste of the original fried apple pies from McDonald's. Brought back memories from when I was a little kid!"
"1","4","These cookies are delicious!The dough comes out very crumbly though,I haven't mastered how to stop this from happening,but the flavor is outstanding.Don't over cook or the cookies will be too hard."
"1","5","Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I let my butter soften for a while and used my hand blender to soften it a little more. But the dough turned out amazing. When i finished, i used my hands and mixed the dough a little bit more thoroughly. Everyone LOVED these cookies. I sprinkled sugar sprinkled on them and baked for 8 minutes. I was told (by someone who likes crunchy cookies) to try for another minute or two. But the 8 minutes made them soft and chewy and they were delicious. They kept very well too. I am definitely using this recipe again! Amazing! (:"
"1","4","Easy, simple, delicious. 8 min was perfect. Added almond extract and sprinkled sugar on top. Yum!"
"1","4","This is the second time I've made these and they are still great! Super easy to make and definitely bakes perfect at 8 minutes. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is bc they are just a bit bland for my taste. However, they are just sugar cookies so there's not a lot of spice in the first place. Definitely a keeper no matter what"
"1","5","These cookies are excellent. They are crisp on outside and chewy inside. My whole family loved them. Bake time of 8 min. is perfect."
"1","5","These cookies are delicious!  I halved the recipe as I did not have enough butter, and I used egg beaters.  I dipped a fork in colored sugar and made a criss-cross pattern on the cookies before baking.  Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","3","I read the reviews before making these cookies and I was sure that I was going to nail them! I was wrong. I made sure the butter was completely softened and that didn't help. The dough was perfect, not crumbly and not sticky. But when I watched them bake, they remained in their ball shape the entire time. They looked like biscuits when I took them out of the oven. When I tasted them, the butter flavor was overwhelming. Next time I am going to use less butter and less flour and add a little milk. Hopefully they turn out better than round 1!"
"1","5","I've never made sugar cookies before, and this recipe turned out to be really good. I flattened out the batter on the pan a little, rather than just plopping it on. My only caution would be to make sure to take the cookies out of the oven before they look golden at all. The better cookies are definitely the softer ones."
"1","4","These were amazing.. I did, however, change a few things.. I substituted half of the butter with softened cream cheese, and I used half splenda half regular white sugar. I used a splash more vanilla as well.. and these turned out amazing..   A tip.. take some parchment paper and mold your dough into a log shape, roll it up and put it in the fridge for about an hour. Then all you have to do is cut the dough into slices and place on the cookie sheet. I baked at 350 for 10 minutes."
"1","1","They have no flavor and crumble."
"1","4","I found this to be an excellent starter recipe. After I read the reviews I added 2 tsp vanilla, about 1/2 tsp cardamon, a well rounded cup of margarine. When I had the dry ingredients including spices, I blended really well. Blended margarine in really well with blender, Mix egg really well with vanilla first then added and when dough was on cookie sheet, sprinkle sugar on top and baked on 3rd level from bottom for 9 min. turned out perfect! thanks for sharing :>) my niece and I used this recipe and she was quite happy!"
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"1","3","they don't bake properly.. they're sticking to my cookie pan and won't come off and you MUST put the dough in the fridge over 1 hr or overnight for proper dough"
"1","5","Amazing cookies!! Only made one change, I rolled them in sugar before baking. Baked for exactly 8 minutes and they turned out perfect! 2 days later they are still soft and delicious!"
"1","4","I added about 1/2 tsp. almond extract and reduced the baking time to about 8 1/2 minutes. They were good, however, I will keep searching. They were had a lightly buttery-crisp edge, which was wonderful, BUT they were a little too dense in the center. I would like to find a recipe that's still soft-centered, but with a lighter and more velvety center. My coworker thinks the key might be a recipe with sour cream, so I'll keep searching and testing."
"1","3","They were delicious but they got hard after a while so they could've been better but other than that they were good"
"1","5","These were great. Made half the recipe and kept dough refrigerated to make fresh cookies whenever we please. =)"
"1","2","It was really hard and took forever. Directions weren't clear, it tasted all screwed up. Don't like the recipe. :("
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly and the cookies were super easy and super yummy. My preschoolers helped make them and the ingredients are so simple I always have these things on hand. Great recipe. I like to under cook a little so they are melty soft"
"1","5","Seriously the best sugar cookie recipe out there. The outside is crispy, the bottom is lightly carmelized, and the inside is chewy. My boyfriend's favourite!"
"1","5","Delicious! I started to make these, and then realized I had very little sugar left, so I made them with brown sugar instead. They were awesome! Like other reviewers, I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla to add extra flavor, and made sure to cook them for only 8 minutes. I'll deiniftely make these again!"
"1","5","This was just AMAZING! I love that chewy and crisp texture. And so sweet! But I have a question, do I use salted or unsalted butter, because salted butter turned our to be just fine, even more tasty blending in with the sugar. Here's a tip: Use 2 eggs, not 1. It gives the cookies a more golden look to them and it avoids the dough getting a bit too dry and crumbly, which is what happened to me."
"1","5","Perfect. I did what another reviewer suggested, added 2 tsp vanilla instead of 1, and used margerine. No problems with smooth or crumbly. 10 min for slighty smaller than golf ball size dough."
"1","4","This is one of the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted. Truly. It seems like it bakes a lot, and it does, but I am so glad of that now. I have a 10 year old hand mixer, so I had one heck of a time making these cookies. By the time I got them in the oven, I was plain exausted. They tasted fantastic, and I might make them (hopefully I will have better luck with the prep this time... :D) again. Seems like no one else had a problem, so try them! They're really good."
"1","5","My daughter used this dough to make a dessert pizza with cream cheese frosting, strawberries, pineapple and chocolate sauce. It turned out great! I want to try to modify the recipe to make Snickerdoodles! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","these cookies are amazing. super easy, and made with things that i always have on hand. they bake up chewy in the center and crispy on the edges. my go to recipe from now on!"
"1","1","Unlike the other reviews, my cookies turned out horrible. :c They were, personally, disgusting. They tasted salty, bitter, and burnt, though I baked them for eleven minutes and they were golden. I didn't use any salt, either! I followed all of the directions carefully, but they tasted fowl. I definitely won't be making this one again.. :c"
"1","5","These cookies are extremely delicious! i enjoy making them and they turn out perfect for any occasion. The only problem i had was the oven time. Our oven is a bit more powerful than others and bakes quickly, the cookies turned hard. But now, we just limit the time and they always turn out delicious! 5 stars for this recipe!"
"1","5","Very good. I followed the recipe exactly."
"1","5","I microwaved the butter for several seconds to get it soft without having to wait. The cookies came out great! The whole family loved them, this is a new family favorite."
"1","5","put dough into a casserole dish and made a sugar cookie bar with lemon icing on top."
"1","5","These were so easy to make and they taste great! I added a splash of milk to the mixture at the end because the dough seemed a little too dry. But other than that, EXCELLENT!!"
"1","5","These cookies are the BEST sugar cookies I've ever made. Couldn't ask for more. Today I wanted chocolate cookies, I added 3/4 cup of cocoa powder. Turned out wonderful. A little dry since the powdered chocolate made it a thicker consistency, but 1 egg white and 1/2 cup water fixed that."
"1","4","All in all, good recipe and really FAST!"
"1","4","I had a grand idea to make birthday cookies for a little girl. The only issue is, I had 35 minutes before she got off the bus. I was able to do this recipe and have them ready in 30 minutes. Surprise! I also added colorful sprinkles in the batter for fun. The cookies were great! Day TwO: The cookies are still awesome! This is one I will keep for a long time! Thanks for saving me! :)"
"1","5","I made these exactly as written, baked for 8 minutes, and had soft, wonderful cookies that didn't last the whole day...and now I'm making a second batch. Simple, easy, and good!"
"1","5","Perfect cookies! Really tasty and really easy to make. I made them for a party at school, and everyone loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","2","I made these and the dough was very dry. I did use my Kitchen Aid mixer and maybe it mixed them too hard? Idk... my husband loves sugar cookies but I have a very hard time making them. Thank you!"
"1","5","Yum! I've, strangely, never had great luck with sugar cookies but I'm out of chocolate chips and needed to make cookies for a meeting. After reading the reviews, I put the butter (in my big glass mixing bowl) in the microwave for 40 seconds to soften (it was straight out of the fridge). It was about half melted, and half very soft. I followed the recipe as stated except for doubling the vanilla. I rolled them in pink sugar crystals and baked for eight minutes and they came out perfect. Huge, huge hit. I will definitely make them again!"
"1","4","I thought it was good, I used a little to much baking powder though..."
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe. I substituted 3/4 cup of whole wheat for some of the white flour (I prefer the rustic look to my baked goods). I also did a batch with lemon zest and dried lavender I brought back from Provence. Delicious. Such an easy, straightforward recipe and a perfect blank slate for variations."
"1","5","I made these, really scared....but its SOOOO goood! I loved them! Just make sure the butter has melted properlyyy! My dad is like obsessed wiff these!!!"
"1","1","Great recipe! This was quick and easy and turned out flawless!"
"1","5","The absolute easiest sugar cookie you will ever make. So delicious, I sold some for Easter and had to make more the next day. There is no way to mess up this recipe. I recommend them to everyone."
"1","5","Made these because my boyfriend loves sugar cookies. I don't like them....until now!!! They rock!"
"1","5","I was worried because the dough was very dryish and crumbly, but, these really were wonderful. Easy too. I added a little extra vanilla and cooked 8 minutes only, like previous reviewers suggested. Absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","I made these as an Easter treat for a group of young daycare kids.. I frosted them with different colored vanilla frosting and the kids absolutely loved them! Not only were they a hit with the kids but the parents tried them and said they were better than any store bought cookies. I will never use store bought sugar cookie dough again..this recipe was such a success!"
"1","5","Best and Easiest Sugar Cookies EVER!!!! Make sure your butter is soft, and use REAL butter!!!"
"1","5","I halved the recipe, but didn't precisely measure out half an egg - I probably had a bit more than half. I'm always liberal vanilla extract, and I added just a dash of almond extract. I baked them for just 8 min. The end result was a slightly thin cookie (but I wasn't trying to shape them so this was no bother) that was very moist and very tasty. It reminded me of the macadamia nut cookies from Subway."
"1","5","So easy! It takes like a 1/4 of the time and effort it takes to make your traditional sugar cookies. They have a fantastic flavor and taste great alone or with the Sugar cookie frosting from this site. Only thing I changed was I baked them for 7 minutes because I have a convection oven. I'm definitely making these for my upcoming bake sale. Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
"1","4","Very good as written... also made batch with lemon instead of vanilla, add some lemon zest and some dried cranberries. Very good both ways, nice soft/chewy cookie. Update: I've made these several times now. Even added Strawberry Pineapple Orange juice w/ orange zest and cranberries... Very good!"
"1","5","You could sell these: they look and taste great. One note: the recipe made 35, not 48, with a cookie dough scoop. If you need 48, make them small."
"1","3","Followed the directions very closely and got batter that was really easy to work with (didn't need to freeze or refrigerate, rolled really easily, etc.) but the cookies came out really....blah. Pretty much tastes like wet sugar to me. If you want something super easy and very underwhelming, this is the recipe for you."
"1","4","The best sugar cookies so far. I am satisfied with how much you can make with a small amount of ingredients. I experimented with various types of extras, and found that some cinnamon added inside/anise and sugar coating work the best. Maybe a little too crunchy for my taste, but I'll make them again."
"1","5","these are awsome!. I melted the butter before I added the sugar, and it blended quite nicely, oh and I didnt have any egg so I used a sub.(1TBSP water + 2 TBSP corn starch.) They didn't rise like they should (lack of egg im sure),but we like our cookies crunchy anyway. All in all they turned out GREAT!"
"1","3","Good taste, but it cracked and crumbled a lot when I was trying to roll them. Tasted good, and I decorated with royal icing."
"1","5","Super Easy! Super Yummy! I made them with my 3 year old today! We put the dough in a cookie press to make shamrocks for St. Patty's Day!"
"1","5","Perfect and easy."
"1","5","Very tasty cookies that were super simple to make. Took me only about 10 minutes to make. There was a lot of sugar in this; however, I may have mistakenly added too much."
"1","5","These were delicious!! My children made these by themselves!! They were great!!"
"1","4","Very good (:"
"1","5","Me and my friends looooove making these at sleepovers and for birthday gifts! Definately bake them for less time because they're amazing when they are really soft!"
"1","4","Great recipe, definitely bake for 8 minutes only. I find sugar cookies sometimes too sweet, so I substituted the vanilla extract with almond extract. Definitely put a different spin on a delicious recipe."
"1","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe I've found so far. I doubled the recipe so I could make the cookies a little bigger and rolled them in sugar before putting them in the oven. Delicious!"
"1","5","super easy..and very tasty..made for a christmas gathering..and not one cookie was left!"
"1","5","Wonderful, worked perfectly. I personally always like to add an extra egg. Also I did make sure the butter was completely melted, in fact I cheated a bit and put it in the microwave until creamy."
"1","5","Excellent! Perfect just the way it is. Smelled heavenly while cooking. Tasted amazing."
"1","5","Fan-frickin'-tastic! I only made one change: I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of white for deeper flavor."
"1","4","These were delicious and so simple! I topped mine with cinnamon and powdered sugar... so delicous!"
"1","5","Perfect cookie, directions, recipe. Fast and EASY."
"1","4","I was looking for an easy sugar cookie recipe and this is definitely it! So simple and DELICIOUS. My friance and friends devoured them within a couple of days.  The only change I made was to add another teaspoon of vanilla extract. I'm only giving these a four because some of them significantly hardened after cooling. Underbake them just a tad and they'll be perfect!"
"1","4","Very yummy. I doubled the vanilla and melted the butter. Otherwise, I followed as directed... Definitely watch the cookies and don't go over 7-8 minutes, as you don't want to cook them too long. They'll start to burn/get hard after that. But these turned out really well... I was pleased...great snack that makes a bunch of cookies with just a few ingredients normally readily on hand."
"1","5","I think this recipe was very easy and baked as directed they came out PERFECT. I like to use Almond extract with my sugar cookies and they were delish. These do not need to flattened out they bake perfect. Loved the recipe."
"1","5","These cookies were perfect, exactly what others have described. Chewy, a little crispy on the edges, and the flavor is amazing. I did use 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp almond extract. With that change, they tasted similar to the pillsbury rolled cookies, but with way better texture. This will be my go-to recipe from now on."
"1","3","I had a bit of trouble with the dough being crumbly, however, I did manage to roll the cookies into balls and they baked up just fine. Tip=roll out smaller balls because then you can bake them less time. Baking them a full ten minutes as I did with larger cookies causes the bottoms to become too dark because of all of the butter and sugar in them. Over all, the flavor was good...but these are really sweet...like eating pure sugar."
"1","5","Definitely the easiest cookies I've ever made! You don't need any special ingredients, you most likely have all of them on hand. And if you like to eat raw cookie dough as I do, then this recipe is divine!! I will be making these again for sure."
"1","5","simply put, YUMMY! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","3","Average Cook Recipe. Quick, easy for kids, and family. Needs less flour, Added more vanilla and a shot of maple to fix exact taste. will use for a good base in the future."
"1","5","had to add about a fourth of a cup extra of butter for some reason, but they turned out great!"
"1","4","Great recipe! This recipe is really easy to follow and the cookies turn out great, but I found that slightly flattening the balls before baking was better than leaving them in ball form."
"1","3","I had a hard time deciding how to rate this recipe. I usually try recipes as least once as written but this time I was out of real butter and took the top reviewers suggestion of using margarine. What I got were cookie shaped sugar biscuits. They were still a soft cookie texture but the taste was something more like a biscuit. I'm not sure if that's because of the margarine or because I just don't like the taste. A quick search online did reveal that it is sometimes a bad idea to switch margarine for butter in cookie recipes. I think today was one of those times..."
"1","5","These were super easy to make and came out SOOO yummy! My kiddos and hubby couldn't get enough. This will defiantly be a keeper for easy drop sugar cookies! Next time I think I may add mini M&Ms! 8 minutes seemed to be the perfect time for me, cooked thorough and slightly brown on the bottoms but perfectly chewy!"
"1","5","I have made these twice, and both times they came out perfect! I found that softening the butter as other reviewers had suggested and using two eggs, as well as mixing on low speed has kept the batter from getting crumbly. Cook exactly 8 minutes, and cool on sheet pan exactly 3 minutes, and you have a perfect cookie. I found if you make them too big they won't cook all the way through, so smaller is better."
"1","4","Pretty good basic cookie. Came out a little dry and by day 2 they weren't too yummy anymore. I'll keep looking for a fantastic basic sugar cookie recipe.  Made a second time, cause they're just so easy. Used pastry flour. Turned out fine."
"1","5","perfectly delicious"
"1","4","The whole family loved them! I hope the boyfriend does too."
"1","5","Great easy recipe! I recommend melting the butter completely and adding additional vanilla, just as some other members have suggested. Love it!"
"1","5","My family was feening for something sweet, so I hopped online to this site in search for something that would not satisfy their sweet tooth, but also be a breeze to prepare. I won't lie, I was drawn by the key word in the title...EASY! LOL This recipe was on point! Not only was it easy and quick to prepare and bake, but it was just the right amount of sweetness. For the softened butter, I simply nuked it in the microwave until it was soft and partially melted, and it worked lovely. I decided to bake the cookies for 8 minutes as they came out soft and chewy; my family's preference. The dough easily yielded 4 dozen as well, something I was pleased with. I will DEFINITELY be adding this recipe to my rotation of sweets!"
"1","5","Made them for Christmas and was a huge hit"
"1","5","i thought these were absolutely delicious, and everyone who tried them agreed. based on reviews, i made some changes: my butter was thoroughly melted and creamed really well. i added about a half a cup of sugar to the recipe. i thought the dough was pretty stiff so i added a splash of 2% milk (i used half&half the second time, it gave it a richer flavour. also, JUST a splash- otherwise you have to add a tiny bit more flour). also, before baking them, i pressed them a tiny bit with a fork dipped in a sugar/vanilla extract mix and baked til they were almost done, then sprinkled sugar on top and baked the rest of the way. they aren't for people watching their sugar intake, but they were oh so very tasty!"
"1","4","I made these cookies with minor changes, which is that I used an egg substitute because I don't eat eggs, vegan butter (Earth Balance 'butter'), organic unbleached sugar, and I baked them on parchment paper, and I posted my picture with all the tiny cookies on a white plate with blue lines outlining it. The cookies came out awesome, they could use a little more vanilla extract maybe if you like it more sweet, but I'm making vanilla frosting for them so they came out perfect. It was my first time making cookies from scratch and I too questioned the dough as it was crumbly, but I think it came out fabulous...only 8 minutes in the oven not one second longer, and I used a teaspoon with a round bottom and then scooped and made a rounded top and balled it into my hand and you can see from the picture they came out perfect :) NOT greasy at all! I may add 1/2 a teaspoon more of extract next time if I eat them without frosting but that's all. Loved them."
"1","5","Delicious, simple and tasty! Maybe add a bit more vanilla extract, and this truly is the easiest, tastiest sugar cookie recipe out there. My cookies took only 6-8mins to be perfectly chewy/crispy. We then frosted some with a quick confectioner's sugar/milk icing, and my 2 year-old loved tossing sprinkles on top. We have our go-to sugar cookie recipe now! Thanks very much for sharing, Stephanie."
"1","5","Very good. Mine look exactly like the picture on the site page. My college son wanted sugar cookies, and these hit the spot."
"1","5","I LOVE UM! BEST SUGAR COOKIES EVER!"
"1","5","These....are.....amazing!!! Just got through making a whole bunch of these and I can't stop 'tasting'. I initially thought that I messed up the recipe some how with the all the flour, but I kept mixing and poof!! Fabulous cookies! I loove these and will be making them again and again!! Thanx Stephanie :)"
"1","1","I was looking for a quick, easy sugar cookie recipe and this seemed like a good one. I read some of the bad reviews but thought since there were more good than bad, the recipe should turn out ok. Oh so wrong. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but the dough was in crumbs. Like some other reviewers suggested, I added 1/4 c milk to try to pull it together, but it was still all crumbly. They needed 12-15 minutes to bake and some turned out paper-thin and greasy. If you are looking for a good, tasty, easy recipe then this isn't the one. Keep looking."
"1","5","I have tried a lot of sugar cookie recipes and this one is by far the best! I was commended by all who enjoyed these delicious cookies! Once again I will reiterate what others have already said; 8 minutes is the perfect amount of time for luscious, moist, chewy on the inside/crispy on the outside cookies, two teaspoons of vanilla extract definitely gives it a little more of a kick, and making sure the butter is extremely soft helps as well. Upon coming across this recipe and reading the reviews I was more than excited to give them a try, I am very glad I did. I recommend this recipe to all who enjoy the perfect sugar cookie!"
"1","5","Ok...I loved these cookies. I never have successfully made sugar cookies before. Since I had all these ingredients (and the stores were out of premade dough) I thought I would give it a try. I read tons of reviews and decided to add another tsp vanilla but otherwise followed it to a T. They were the best. The dough even tasted good. When I took my first bite I was in shock they were so good. I would say cook no longer than 10 miutes or they get too crispy."
"1","1","This as it stands does not work and is not easy. The dough was too crumbly. Too much flour I think. If you have to change the ingredients to make it work then what's the point."
"1","1","Didn't work at all. turned out sugar cookie biscuits!"
"1","5","great sugar cookie!! Like the sweetness and the texture! I used this twice to make fruit pizza and the cookie was a great compliment!!! Cookie is crunchy and moist!"
"1","3","The first time I tried this recipe, they surprisingly came out pretty well. The cookies were kind of small, but also had a nice thickness to them , as well as softness. I also used margarine instead of the butter. Once all combined, the dough was very hard to work with, but it turned out just right, and was easy to roll into small little balls as the recipe calls for. I have on clue what happened from then on. I've tried this recipe quite a few times since, and it WILL NOT work. This is the most annoying recipe I've ever witnessed. It's like if you don't do everything exactly right, you are totally screwed. Today I was attempting to make them to give as holiday gifts, and they are going all flat on me, and don't have the same consistency or anything. I did chill them over night so maybe that was a BAD idea. I was just trying to save time. Last time I had to cook these cookies like 12 min, and now I can't seem to figure out how long the cook. They either come out too soft and not cooked, or too crispy. Plus, it has too much of a buttery taste going on. Now, I have to figure out something else to cook for Christmas, instead of these."
"1","2","These aren't bad, but super floury. It's not hard to make sugar cookies, but this recipe is super crumbly and doesn't work well."
"1","4","came out hard!! last time was not batter crumbly"
"1","3","These cookies were good but not amazing. Yes they were easy to make but they were flat & crisp.. I guess I was just looking for a fat fluffy sugar cookie."
"1","5","Great recipe"
"1","1","this recipe is quick and easy. the cookies arent sweet at all and the dough is very dry and awkward..it has a nice crunch on the outside but taste nothing like sugar cookies and smells very weird and greasy...i would never recommend this to anyone"
"1","4","These were very good--they reminded me of a recipe my grandmother used to make. My only complaint is that they got very hard after not very long even though they were stored in an airtight container (maybe I just need to eat them faster!)"
"1","5","This is a great and easy recipe! i used cookie cutters with mine and they turned out!"
"1","5","I LOVE these sugar cookies. I added a little more vanilla than called for, but I always do that. I read through some comments and saw that some were a disappointment. I used real butter. If you use margarine they won't come out well. Mine were rather soft -- which I liked. Also, if you compare to store bought--well, there is no comparison. Store bought usually adds lots of sugar to make up for vanilla, and probably don't use real butter. These aren't yukky sweet at all. Full of flavor. 5 stars for sure."
"1","5","So easy and so yummy. I broil them for the last minute so that the tops have time to catch up to the crispiness of the bottoms."
"1","4","Really easy to do! Even at high altitude (6000ft) the recipe didn't need any tweaking. I did roll the cookie dough balls in sugar and cinnamon and they turned out great!"
"1","1","For some reason our cookies turned out tasting like popcorn!! I was really disappointed not sure why but maybe because we used the crisco butter sticks instead of going out on a cold winter's night to get the butter but it was a big joke that we made popcorn cookies."
"1","5","These cookies were sooooo good! I did make sure the butter was very soft and chilled the dough overnight only beacause it was late when I made it and the kids wanted to help, so I had to wait until morning. We made these to give to neighbors. They were so awesome, I now have to make some for us."
"1","4","I wish I would have read more reviews before I made these. I will give them a third try with the leaving the butter out all afternoon and putting them in the fridge before baking."
"1","5","These were a wonderful flavor! I couldn't stop eating them... and I am not a fan of sugar cookies! Stay to baking time of 9 minutes. They were nice and soft for days."
"1","4","Easy AND yummy, what could be better?! I put Hersheys Meltaways in the center for fun."
"1","5","These definitely were easy, and really yummy too!! Made them last night and everyone loved them. I will be making more soon!!"
"1","5","These aren't the best sugar cookies I've ever had, but they are the best EASY sugar cookies I've made. I only made one change the the recipe - I added more vanilla - 2 tsp instead of one. It is very important to use softened butter (never margarine!) and cream the sugars till light and fluffy. I used a cookie scoop and rolled the balls in sugar. I baked for 8 minutes on airbake cookie sheets. They turned out perfect and they disappeared quickly! Yum!"
"1","5","I couldn't stop eating them as I was decorating 'em! SO delicious!"
"1","5","really good!"
"1","4","great easy cookie with good texture and flavor"
"1","1","I made these cookies they looked great in the oven but when taken out they fell flat. Are you sure the temp should be 375. Someone told me they thought that heat was to high. Please let me know. Thanks"
"1","5","My dough came out a little crumbly as other reviewers mentioned. I just pressed it all together and wrapped it in saran wrap in the fridge. Then I scooped it out and rolled half in red sugar crystals and the other half in green sugar crystals. They came out perfect! Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy middles. YUM! Next time I will make sure to cream the butter better as other reviewers mentioned. Wish I had read the reviews first, LOL But either way, these cookies were great!"
"1","4","Added an extra egg as the mixture was very crumbly. Also added an extra 1/4 C of sugar. After letting the dough rest for about 10 minutes on the counter, it was perfect to mold in my hands."
"1","5","I am a guy but I bake and love it. I make cinnamon coffee cake allot and had lots of extra crumbles in a bowl in my freezer and I rolled the balls in the cinnamon crumble mix and they turned out sooooo gooood. I didnt have any vanilla so I used hazelnut and it was set off by the cinnamon very well. Far out."
"1","5","Delicious and super easy!! I am not a baker and these turned out perfect. Chewy, moist, and soft! YUM!!!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Simple and not too many ingredients. I roll the balls in sugar before baking and remove from oven after 10 minutes before cooling on glass cutting board. Then quickly seal in tupperware or plastic storage bins/bags. They stay soft if stored this way."
"1","4","I'm sorry everybody, but these cookies are not the best. They are very sweet and not a good taste to them. I do alot of baking but I will not be making these anymore."
"1","5","Easiest cookie recipe I've ever made. My husband and I couldn't stop eating them! So simple, I'm definitely making them again."
"1","4","I put the dough in the fridge for a couple hours so it was easier to roll. It seemed a little dry, but rolled out fine once I kneaded it to warm it up. I would not leave in fridge as long or roll out right away. Good taste. Baked for 8 mins and they came out perfect."
"1","5","Great sugar cookie!! Moist and delicious, even a couple of days after baking. (Make sure your butter is truly softened and creamy). I rolled mine in sugar and cinnamon and added just a titch more vanilla than called for... very yummy! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","excellent! as others have mentioned, make sure butter is very soft and i did double the vanilla (plus a bit for good measure). yum!"
"1","5","They are the best sugar cookies and very easy to make."
"1","4","I just finished these! They came out great! I recommend 12 minutes tops. They came out soft and delicious! They would make a great base for Snickerdoodles."
"1","4","This was an easy recipe to prepare. I rolled it so that the kids could cut out cookies, and it worked pretty well. I halved the recipe (lightly beat 1 egg then use 1 1/2 tbsp of it, to get half an egg), but still used 1 tsp vanilla, which was perfect. Both kids got to cut out 8 medium to large cookies. Then we decorated them with sprinkles, baked and enjoyed. Usually making sugar cookies is an ordeal - more dough than they have attention span for, and frosting which makes it all more complicated. This way kept it simple and the recipe was still sweet enough without frosting for the kids to enjoy. When the portion that I'd put in the refrigerator for an hour or so came out rock hard I microwaved it on a very low power level for less than 30 seconds and it went back to its original consistency. I realized after the first batch that since the cookies are thinner rolled I needed to shorten the baking time to somewhere between 6-7 minutes. The remaining scraps of dough I mushed together into tbsp-sized drops and made 1/2 tsp-sized divots which I filled with jam - also very tasty!"
"1","5","Very yummy recipe! I followed the tip to take them out at 8 minutes instead of 10 and they turned out perfect. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract for the perfect touch. Definitely making these again."
"1","4","Surprisingly good. Once the batter was mixed, I thought it looked odd and was going to be a disaster, but they actually turned out!"
"1","5","These are good. I thought they needed more sugar, but that's from a 'sugar happy' person. My sister says its perfectly fine. And the rest of the family. The dough was a little too...un-thick. It wasn't a doughy dough. We made it though and it was fine. Don't leave them in the oven too long because it will get burned. And they do spread a lot. We made it the size of about a tabluespoon or so and it got as big as my palm (probably a little smaller than an adult palm)"
"1","5","these cookies are awesome! i rolled them in sugar sprinkles before baking them and it was great. my boyfriend and his friends loved them!"
"1","5","Perfect! Although teaspoon size makes very small cookies, I made them much bigger. Delicious! I used Turbinado sugar and they were great."
"1","4","I loved that the recipe was easy and they turned out delicious!"
"1","5","Excellent! Soft and chewy on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside. Wonderful flavor. My oven took 10 min. Wouldn't change a thing. Thank You"
"1","4","added white chocolate chips"
"1","5","absolutely easy and absolutely delicious! The dough was super velvety, not too dry like one other I tried recently. I did what was suggested by another poster and took them out right at the 8 minute mark. They are soft and chewy, but with a crispy edge. For a couple of batches I rolled the cookie balls in some cinnamon and sugar( like a tsp of cinnamon and 2 Tb sugar mixed together), and I had 'snickerdoodles'. Yum! this recipe is going to be the go-to for sure. Still can't belive how EASY it was!"
"1","5","Followed the directions exactly and couldn't be happier! Delicious!"
"1","5","very good and super easy!!! I was able to do it while holding my 11 month old lol"
"1","5","THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING 4!!! THANKS, THIS WAS EASY, FAST AND VERRRRRY YUMMIE. THIS KIDS THOUGHT THEY TASTED AWSOME"
"1","5","These were the easiest and best tasting sugar cookies I ever made. My entire family loved them and I took some to work and my daughter took some to school. Great Receipt..."
"1","5","SO easy! & SO amazing! These cookies were perfect for a quick sugar fix! I would recommend these to everyone :)"
"1","5","These are a perfect sugar cookie. We sub. vanilla with almond extract and pushed some sliced almonds in the top of the balls before baking! Delicious!! I liked them...they were a perfect thickness (we don't care for the very thin ones! Thank you for posting!!"
"1","5","delicious! great recipe, my only complaint is that it the yield is a little higher than i would like."
"1","4","These were a fantastic base sugar cookie--I did add a tablespoon of skim milk because the dough was dry and wouldn't stick together and I also added a half teaspoon of salt for good measure, but these come out great on their own or embellished. I made half of them plain and on the other half, I rolled the dough in sugar, then I halved some milky way and 3 musketeer minis and pressed them cut side down into the top of the cookies when they were hot out of the oven. They were flat-out addictive and got rave reviews! Thanks!!"
"1","4","I liked how simple and few the ingredients were! I would flatten my cookies out a bit before baking next time. They didn't really spread out as they cooked so they looked kind of strange. Good taste... chewy not hard!"
"1","5","This was a really good and easy recipe. I have never made homemade sugar cookies before, but they are definitely the best I have ever tasted!!!"
"1","5","Tasty and easy cookies. I reduced the butter just a bit and they still stayed together rather well. Just for some seasonal fun I pressed a chocolate chip and some black and orange sprinkles into each cookies before baking. I think they look a little like bloodshot eyeballs. This is my new sugar cookie recipe!"
"1","5","I absolutely LOVED this recipe!! The only thing that I did different was adding a 1/2 tsp of salt to the recipe. This is a really tasty, soft cookie! I added sprinkles to the tops of them and kids couldn't get enough!!"
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies and possibly the best cookies I've ever made. My kids loved them. I didn't change a thing. Bake only 8 min, to keep them nice and soft. I rolled into teaspoon sized balls, then pressed into Halloween themed sprinkles! Super easy. Do make sure that your butter has completely softened."
"1","3","These cookies have good taste! The downside is that the dough is very crumbly. We were hoping to be able to frost these, but they were just too fragile for that."
"1","5","This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I've used and all of my friends love it. I add a dash of cinnamon and a half teaspoon more of the vanilla extract to the mix, and make a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and sugar to sprinkle on top as the cookies cool for a delicious snickerdoodle version. Or my dad likes it when I add a teaspoon of freshly grated orange peel to the mix and just sprinkle with regular sugar as they cool. Both variations are delicious."
"1","4","It's a good starter recipe if you don't know how to make sugar cookies. In terms of prepping, it doesn't create a big mess like other recipes do. Just use a good wire whisk and a sturdy bowl and you're good to go. The taste might be a bit lackluster if you want it plain. I'd suggest adding some topping to this like M&M's, candy, or chocolate chips to give it more flavor. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this for people who don't want a big mess or a confusing recipe."
"1","5","Wow, really good....topped with sugar cookie frosting from this site...+hmmmmm"
"1","5","Super simple cookies. Super good! They baked up quick too, I think this is a perfect recipe for sugar cookies."
"1","5","I had snack duty for my child's Kindergarden class for an entire week. Not knowing how to get 100 snacks prepared I started with chocolate chip cookies, then moved here. These were a blast to make with the help of five children as we cut out halloween shapes, and a hit, I got an email from the teacher for the recipie. Thank you for the buttery, sweet treat that was a hit at school!!! I would not change one thing about this recipe at all. I even used the calculator on this site to help me measure out enough ingredients for a class of 21, PERFECT!"
"1","5","SOOO Good ! I made 2 baches for my church event, they sold out!"
"1","5","I love this recipe"
"1","5","These were SO easy & quick to make! My son & I baked these yesterday, and they were SUPER yummy & moist :)"
"1","4","These cookies are so good but both times I've made them mine turn out flat. I'll keep trying because they're yummy and its probably operator error."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out GREAT!"
"1","5","Help - followed it to the tee but had very very crumbled dough, the butter was soft and added the vanilla. I chilled the dough for an hour but had a hard time to form the balls because it was crumbled. Am new to baking so not sure, I used a hand mixer for creaming the butter and sugar and gradually mixed in the dry ingred with the mixer as well. The flavor was terrific but they didn't spread out. can anyone give me an opinion? many thaks"
"1","3","Im not sure what I did wrong, but my batter came out crumbly. I did however soften the butter in the microwave which I suspect was the culprit. The mixture seemed too dry and the cookies tasted bland. I'm going to try again with an extra tsp of vanilla and using very soft thawed butter."
"1","5","This afternoon I wanted something sweet and easy with just a few ingredients that I knew I had in my pantry. A quick search for 'easy sugar cookie' brought me to this recipe. This was SO quick and easy! These look and taste just like the sugar cookies from the bakery!! I did make one deviation from the recipe. I was out of eggs, so I used a 1/4 cup of vanilla soymilk in place of the egg. Also -- I used salted butter (the recipe didn't specify). The cookies turned out beautiful! Perfectly buttery and sweet.   Edited 10/08 -- I just made these again, and they weren't nearly as good. I'm not sure where I went wrong exactly, but this time the cookies were hard and barely spread at all. Also - this time I used unsalted butter, and the cookies were really bland. I wholeheartedly recommend using salted butter for these!"
"1","4","This was my first time ever making sugar cookies. I am glad that I added an additional tsp of vanilla otherwise the baking soda would have been over powering. Next time I will reduce the soda to 1/2 tsp. Otherwise super easy and good."
"1","5","This is a nice cookie, I dont always have the time to roll out and decorate cookies, with this cookie you dont need to. I did dip them in sugar before baking, its really a no-fail recipe as long as you measure everything properly. I wanted to add just a tip, I knew there was going to be too much flour by reading the recipe so I omitted a 1/4 of a cup. The butter was the right amount, and before baking the WHOLE batch you really shoud bake 2 or 3 first to see how they are before ruining an entire batch."
"1","5","Came out great. I had to cook mine for 13 minutes but maybe my oven is just weird."
"1","5","I must say these are the best sugar cookies we have ever had! I followed one of the other reviewers comments and took them out at 8 minutes. Even though they looked like they could bake longer, letting them set on the baking sheet for 2 minutes made them set up nicely. Trying them again this morning after they sat out overnight reaffirmed that these cookies are 5 stars for soft chewey center!"
"1","5","Great sugar cookie recipe. Cooked exactly 8 minutes and took someone else's suggestion and rolled the dough in sugar before placing on the baking sheet. YUM!"
"1","4","They are some of the best sugar cookies I have had! They spread a whole bunch, so make them about a tablespoon size and they are awesome with frosting! A tip is to let the butter sit before you add it so it is mushy and don't overbake it!"
"1","5","These cookies are awesome. I followed the recipe exactly....adding just a bit more vanilla as others stated. They are pretty quick to make and really do only need about 7 minutes to bake. If you roll the dough into balls and dip the top half in sugar, the come out looking exactly like the picture. Great recipe! Tastes just like a sugar cookie should."
"1","5","EASY, EASY and EASY! I loved this recipe. I will never use another sugar cookie recipe again, my search stops here."
"1","5","simple & tasty. TY for a simple recipe..I enjoyed it :o)"
"1","5","This recipe was amazing! I did add a Tablespoon more butter to the dough after I was done mixing everything due to it being too dry. My kids loved these cookies. We used a cream cheese frosting to top them off which really complemented the cookie and added more flavor."
"1","5","Good recipe especially since I didn't have to freeze them for hours. One review mentioned making sure the butter is warm and soft and to add another tsp of vanilla. Great suggestions! The cookies tasted really yummy. Very kid friendly. My stepson and I added sprinkles. :-)"
"1","1","I made 12 servings, which was probably my problem, but the batter was goopy no matter how much extra flour i added. The mixture burnt and tasted horrible. I won't ever make these again."
"1","5","excellent simple"
"1","3","not that the cookies didn't taste good, but they came out so FLAT, even after sifted. they were however, yummy."
"1","5","Just tried this recipe. My first homemade cookies and everybody adults and kids loved them. I melted my butter all the way on accident. The flavor was good like store bought but without the hydrogenated oil and other bad additives. I added a tsp of vanilla. I never realized how much sugar actually went into sugar cookies so I will only fix on a rare occasion, but when i do i will use this recipe for sure."
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made. My mom even liked them and she doesn't like mch of anything since she started taking chemo 5 years ago. I read some of the reviews and i have to agree that makeing sure the butter is soft is key to keeping them chewy. Since I didn;t have time to wait for it to soften, I put the butter in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time untill it started to melt but had not all the way melted. They were great!"
"1","4","Just baked the 'half version' to only end up with 2 dozen (plenty!) Definitely make sure that the butter is room temperature. If you like really soft cookies like I do, only bake for 7 minutes...my first dozen I baked for 8 (at just over 350) and they were crispy - flavorful - but crispy. I also took the advice of another member and doubled the vanilla, and they have a wonderful flavor!! Overall, a very tasty and simple recipe that I will bake again!!"
"1","5","So good i made this for some of my nursey kids and they LOVED it! BRAVO! Like some other people have mentioned I used a tablespoon of vanilla to give it more flavor."
"1","5","I've been looking for that 'perfect' sugar cookie recipe for years. This is it. The only change I made was I used 2 tsp. vanilla instead of 1 and rolled the balls in white sugar before baking. Quick to put together and they melt in your mouth."
"1","4","Started looking for a good sugar cookie that doesn't need to be rolled out. Didn't think these were great at first, but then I ended up eating almost all of them myself. My husband is still not sold, so the search continues..."
"1","5","I really liked these. Very fast and easy."
"1","5","This recipe is great! I needed a quick easy recipe for a friends birthday and this worked great! I had to change a few things because he is diebetic so I used splenda instead of sugar, shortening instead of butter (was all out of butter) and 2 tsp of vanilla like someone metioned in the reviews. I did have to mash em' down a lil cause of using the shortening and I also rolled them in sugar for a nicer look. Turned out delicous! Can't wait to try them with butter though I bet they are even better :)."
"1","5","Always come out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","10 stars from my 10 year old and her class!"
"1","5","Really simple. I agree to increase the vanilla I used 1-1/2 tsp. Someone mentioned to be sure the butter is soft enough, but after I mixed the dough, I let it sit for about 1/2 hour and the cookies turned out great. I baked for 8 minutes, but the batch that went 9 min seemed a little better. I think that when the stress cracks appear in the cookie, they are done. Not color, but I use insulated cookie sheets"
"1","5","Oh my, we couldn't stop eating the cookies, they were so good! I basically melted the butter and it blended very nicely. I also took the advice of the other reviews and added 1 more teaspoon of vanilla. Absolute delight! Thank you for sharing this decadent recipe."
"1","5","Soft on inside, crispy on outside. Don't overcook. I was worried because the dough was pretty dry but they turned out well!"
"1","5","I just made a batch of these. I had no vanilla, so I added cinnamon and nutmeg instead, and a pinch of salt. After taking them out of the oven, I dusted them with powdered sugar. These are the most amazing sugar cookies I've ever tasted. That are amazing. Crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. I think it's important to not overmix the dough when you add the dry ingredients. Stir until just mixed. My batter was like breadcrumbs, I put a little on the palm of my hand then placed the other hand over and rolled until it became a ball."
"1","4","Prep time was about 15 minutes INCLUDING cleanup! I put the measured ingredients in their own bowls and let my son do the rest. The cookies weren't the best i've had, but they were pretty darn good. We cooked them for 9 minutes."
"1","5","So easy and turned out great!"
"1","3","I cooked these exactly as the recipe says and I had a bit of a problem - they didn't spread out very nicely at all. They stayed mostly in the (very small) round shape, which made for cookies that were dry on the outside and too wet in the middle. The taste was pretty good, but I wouldn't serve them to guests. I guess if I made them again, I would make them tablespoon-sized balls instead of teaspoon sized balls and I would pat them down flatter before putting them in the oven."
"1","5","A very easy and delicious recipe. As they were coming out of the oven, my wife was eating them! I did add more vanilla as was suggested by a few reviewers. They came out crispy AND chewy. They were WONDERFUL. I live in a high altitude area and other than adding more vanilla, I did not change a thing. The cookies took exactly 10 minutes to bake."
"1","2","I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I both did not care for the recipe at all. They have a VERY strong butter flavor that simply was not our cup of tea. Not going to make again."
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies ever! I added an extra tsp. of vanilla and baked for exactly 8 minutes. The texture and flavor is wonderful!"
"1","5","These are excellent. I did however mix m&m candies into the doug and rolled them in white sugar. I baked them for 10 minutes. Once cooled, they were chewy in the inside with a slight crunch on the outside. They were good the next day also. A recipe keeper."
"1","5","These cookies were great! They were quick and easy to make, soft and yummy. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!"
"1","5","These are absolutely delicious! They have a crisp edge, but a chewy center. This is my second time making this recipe and I will continue to use it."
"1","5","I dont normally care for sugar cookies but I liked this recipe. :) I took a whole bunch to my friends at school and they freaked out over them :D"
"1","3","These cookies were very good - me and my 4 year old had a wonderful time. The only thing is that there was too much Baking powder (kinda tasted faintly like baking powder) so I lessened the amount to 1/4. Still came out poofy but did not taste like baking powder."
"1","5","The best sugar cookie recipe I have found. I have shared it with family members and they agree. Make a double batch if you plan to keep any around for a few days. I add colored sugar sprinkles for holidays. They are super with buttercream frosting on top. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"1","1","Even though I let the butter sit it wasn't even like dough it was more like liquid, But that's because I had to add like 5 tablespoons but then I gave up and took a glass and poured water out because they were so floury not doughy like they're suppose to be. I followed every direction, I did change up the serving size because who wants 48 cookies?So I hope that if you don't want 48 cookies Don't make this recipe."
"1","5","Great easy cookies to make with young kids and they are delicious!"
"1","3","A tasty cookie. Not exceptional, but tasty. So I give it 3 starts, right in the middle. Definitely a fast cookie fix though."
"1","1","The recipes needs way more sugar, to truly be called a sugar cookie."
"1","5","These cookies were delicious!!! We made some of them a little too small, so those ones were burned on the bottom. But the non-burned ones were fantastic! They were simple and super quick to make. They only took about 5 minutes. I put Andes candies (chocolate mint chips) on the top, and that made them more flavorful. Yum!"
"1","4","Great recipe.I make it Gluton free by using the gluton free flour."
"1","5","These are absolutely wonderful cookies! They are not only easy, but buttery & perfectly chewy."
"1","4","True to their name, these were very easy to make and delicious! Perfect for when you don't want the extra time and clean-up of rolling & cutting out cookie shapes."
"1","4","These were pretty good! I thought they were tasty. The only reason I gave them a four is because they didn't disappear like I thought they would. It's two days after I made them, and although they're still soft and chewy and delicious, my husband has only eaten two of them, and my kids have had two each. I still have a whole bag of them left. They do make BEAUTIFUL cookies, though, and I like the fact that you don't have to roll them out. We rolled the balls in colored sugar before baking them--I posted a picture if you'd like to see! Do make these at least once--maybe my family is just more of a 'chocolate chip cookie family,' if you know what I mean. :)"
"1","5","Wonderful! I used half (softened) butter and half crisco only because I didn't have enough butter. We love our cookies crunchy (not soft because they seem stale to us that way) and this gave it the perfect crispness. My hubby said these were the best he ever had. My sons & I rolled the tops in sugar (regular and colored) prior to baking to make them pretty and even sweeter, which was not too sweet - it's a sugar cookie, for goodness sakes! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","These taste great! I followed some advice and left my butter out to get really soft. I cut the recipie in half and used the whole egg and close to 1 cup of sugar. 8 min is the perfect cooking time for soft cookies. I've also made thise with margarine and they tast just as good."
"1","3","These are very tasty and are in fact very easy to make. I do like that they are not as sweet as most sugar cookies, however, I only gave this recipe 3 stars because the batter was fairly hard to work with. It just didn't seem to have enough liquid so the dough was very dry. I found it very hard to roll the dough into balls because it kept crumbling in my hands. My daughter wanted to use her cookie cutters and it was also hard to roll out and transfer her shapes to the pan without it crumbling. I added another 1/2 cup of butter which helped and also reduced cooking time to 7 minutes as my oven is fan assisted."
"1","2","these cookies are just OK. Not awful but certainly not wonderful! My dough mixed fine, I used softened butter and it was not crumbly as some people have said. HOWEVER, it was like working with pudding. The dough was WAY TOO SOFT. I could barely get it off the spoon to make to the balls. They baked fine but be warned they spread a lot! Taste was decent but there are much better recipes out there. Save your time!"
"1","5","I love it. i think you are a good cook!"
"1","5","I made these for my daughter's high school chorus class and everyone loved them. Later, I had to make more for home, they're addictive :)"
"1","5","I melted the butter completely as others suggested and followed the directions exactly. They are delicious. Soft in the middle and crunchy at the edges. So good! Big thumbs up!"
"1","5","Excellent"
"1","5","many coments on these cookies. Some said they were the best they ever had! Thanks!"
"1","5","I love this recipe! This was my first time making them and they came out fantastic. Its really quick and easy to make the only problem is that there is a little too much dry mixture. But besides that this is the perfect recipe."
"1","3","Something is very off about this recipe. I followed it EXACTLY. I think it needs more butter. I feel that it was also dry. My husband likes them but I do not."
"1","3","I've had better sugar cookies before. My possible mistakes were the fact that one user stated that you absolutely need to melt the butter completely like a liquid, I melted the butter but it was softened and liquidy in the middle - maybe this was not enough melted. Additionally, I added 1/8 tsp of cream of tartar because I've never had sugar cookies without cream of tartar, perhaps I should have omitted the cream of tartar - I will next time. Be careful not to overbake!"
"1","4","I just made these for the kids to decorate and I think these are really good!! The dough can be a bit crumbly so it is best to refrigerate and spray your hands with a little Pam when shaping. I pressed these down just a little with my palms and sprinkled with sugar before baking. DO NOT OVER BAKE, especially if you like a chewy cookie. When you see a slight golden tinge around the edge they are done. GREAT recipe and thank you for sharing."
"1","3","I followed another reviewer's advice and made sure the butter was very soft (but not melted). The other review said that this made the cookies very soft and buttery. This was not my experience. I followed the recipe and found that it was extremely crumbly and would not hold together. I added an extra egg and two more teaspoons of vanilla (one tablespoon total). With the additional ingredients dough held together perfectly. The dough did not spread very much when it baked but were a perfect golden brown after eight minutes. After they cooled they looked exactly like the picture and are very buttery and soft."
"1","5","They were super easy. My 7 year old daughter has food allergies so we substituted Earth Balance sticks for the butter and Ener-G egg replacer for the eggs. I took another suggestion and rolled them in colored sugar for good measure. She called them 'enchanting'."
"1","3","thx for this easy recipe. all though its quite good i've added my own twist to it. like ranger cookies i've added several ingredients to it, coconut 1 cup an extra egg, add half white sugar and half brown sugar,1/2 to 1 cup of oats, pecans or walnuts,if dough is to stiff add some butter-but usually its just right. add an extra teaspoon of vanilla, also my son loves chocolate chips added to them, i always use self rising flour and no baking soda or salt or baking powder. make cookies into about a rounded teaspoon full of dough or they puff way up, and these cookies stay softer for days"
"1","5","I'm rating this five stars because its super easy and VERY yummy!! I don't like to do sugar cookie cut outs because they are a pain, so these are the best drop cookies. The only change I made was to add half a teaspoon of almond extract, because I like the flavor. My daughters love these cookies! Will definitely make again."
"1","5","This is easy and wonderful and if you don't let the butter get too soft, it makes for great roll & cut out cookies."
"1","5","The best drop sugar cookies I've ever made. I followed the directions exactly. The dough seemed a little crumbly and at first I thought they seemed a little dry but after they set for a little while they were perfect. They stayed nice and chewy in the center and crispy at the edges. Perfect!"
"1","5","These are great!"
"1","5","I gave up on making sugar cookies many years ago after never being able to recreate the delicious cookies I found in the grocery store. This weekend we were snowed in and my husband and I really wanted sugar cookies, so I thought I'd give it another try with this recipe. I could not have imagined that they would turn out so well! We both agreed these are better than our favorite grocery store cookies. I used two tsp of vanilla as several reviewers have suggested. I also used real butter and had no problems with consistency. The directions say to use a heaping tsp, but I used a heaping tablespoon and the cookies came out a very normal size. I will be using this recipe again very soon!"
"1","4","I added a little over 1/2 t almond flavoring. I would go with exactly 1/2 t next time. I also used a large Pampered Chef scoop and flattened the cookies before baking. Made 16. They're delicious. I'm going to decorate them with 'White Cake Frosting II'. :) They kind of flattened out and were a little crunchy, which is why I gave them 4 stars. It could have been my fault, though, my butter wasn't absolutely 'mushy', but I did let it soften for 6 hours."
"1","5","the cookies are great.if you want them gooey and crunchy bake for no longer than 16 minutes!"
"1","5","Awesome and easy cookies!"
"1","5","Love em! These cookies were really easy to make and turns out much better than a boxed mix or refrigerated dough. I will make these again."
"1","3","I thought they were a little to floury and not sweet enough but my husband loved them!!!"
"1","5","these cookies are wonderful!! they are easy to make and a hit everytime!! i made over 500 during the holiday season and everyone loved them!! i follow the recipe as is and do not change it in the slightest. i do only bake them for 8 mins. on 350 because my oven runs so hot. i make them plain, sometimes i had decorations to them such as sprinkles or colored sugar...very simple recipe and i suggest this to anyone on any cooking level!!"
"1","4","This recipe is easy, just as it says. I would have given it 5 stars if it had more flavor. For some reason, it just didn't have the delicate richness I had hoped for in a sugar cookie. I rolled the balls in sugar before baking. Then I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar I rolled them in for more flavor. That definitely helped! But then, I realized it was pretty much just a snickerdoodle."
"1","5","thank you for this! I had forgotten about a kids' function and needed something to whip up with ingredients I already had at home. This was it! I love that anything can be thrown in, candies, lemon, cinnamon. This is perfect!"
"1","1","i did not care for these"
"1","4","These sugar cookies were very easy and had a great cruch to them! Paired with coffee or hot chocolate they are delicious."
"1","5","This was a very tasty and simple recipe. We have made it twice now. Do make sure your butter is room temperature and very soft before mixing. Also, I only baked until the tops were cracked and the edges were golden, this way they were soft and chewy rather than crunchy which is how I prefer my cookies. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","Super easy to make, super easy to fiddle with as well! Great recipes, thanks!"
"1","3","Easy, yes. The texture was good but the flavor was lacking and the flour was pronounced even with 2 tsp. of vanilla extract."
"1","5","This cookie recipe is unbelievably good and easy. I recommend this recipe to anyone who isn't in a huge baking mood and wants a yummy cookie. It's also nice you don't need to refridgerate the cookies either!"
"1","5","Super easy recipe, I doubled to have enough to go around. I used a basic buttercream icing and a few well placed sprinkles and these were great. I did use a sugar replacement made for baking since I was using an icing. You couldn't tell the difference at all, great texture."
"1","5","These are the best sugar cookies i've ever made. Period. I followed what some of the other reviewers said and let the butter soften for an hour before cooking which made the batter nice & creamy. The cookies came out perfectly and my whole family loved them. I also made them for our Christmas get together and they were gone within minutes. This is definately a recipe that will go into my recipe notebook :^)"
"1","5","I've been looking for this recipe for months, it's pretty darned close to my mom's which I lost a few years back. These were our Christmas cookies, and after baking them I'm not sure it's the same. Have a few suggestions to tweak it - make sure you sift the flour, and sift the rest of the dry ingredients (except the sugar) into it. remeasure after you sift. Eliminate the baking soda, increase the baking powder to 1 teaspoon. This keeps them from coming out like rocks. Make the vanilla 1 tablespoon, and add a half teaspoon of salt. refrigerate the dough before you roll and cut it. I used a metal rolling pin. sprinkle flour over your counter, and on top of the dough to keep the rolling pin from sticking. Do not use the non-stick cookie sheets, they will burn. Air bake is much better. I also add a simple butter frosting to this - stick of softened butter, confectioners sugar and milk. I just keep adding sugar, then a little milk until I get the consistancy right. Decorated with colored sugars, or use food coloring to tint it. Yes it's a cholesterol nightmare, but they are SO good. They freeze reasonably well, although I'd recommend not freezing with the frosting already on. The original recipe also called for grated lemon zest and cream of tartar. We never used them."
"1","5","This recipe perfectly lived up to it's name. It was simple to make and they tasted delicious. I took the advice of the reviewer that recommended that the butter should be COMPLETELY softened before creaming. I think that was key to making tasty cookies. I would also recommend that you make sure that the middle is done. The first batch that I made was taken out of the oven too early because I was trying to hard to keep them from getting hard."
"1","5","Simple, quick and delicious! My son loved them. Gas oven/9 minutes cooking time."
"1","4","A good basic recipe, though I modified it a bit after reading the reviews. Instead of 2 3/4 cup flour I used 1 3/4 cup and i used 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. Oven time was approx. 8-9 minutes. I also used tablespoons instead of teaspoon fulls so I would have larger cookies. We decorated with sprinkles, colored sugar and M&Ms and they came out wonderful!"
"1","3","My son and I tried to bake this today and were quite disappointed. The cookie had a bitter after taste. I am guessing it was the baking soda"
"1","4","the perfect easy sugar cookie. I used 1 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 turbinado sugar for a slight molasses taste. I also rolled the tops of the balls in a mix of turbinado sugar and cinnamon. super easy, super delicious! can't wait to try a bit of lemon as another reviewer suggested. this is a great cookie recipe by itself with many more possibilities! thanks!"
"1","5","Very good cookie perfect for those that don't like a lot of sweetness. I did 8.5 minutes and they were just the right texture."
"1","5","I have always had trouble making cookies but this wass the easiest fool-proo.f recipe. Easy steps, not too many ingredients, easy prep! My 11 year old daughter and her friend helped me make them and they were delicious"
"1","4","My dough was kind of crumbly and I ended up adding some milk in order to make it stick, so I'm not sure what happened (because I did follow the recipe exactly). Overall, I thought they were a very good texture and they tasted good."
"1","5","The cookies came out really good. I used half margerine and half unsalted butter. I made sure the butter was very soft. I also a little bit more vanilla as other people had suggested (1 Tablespoon). Easy and very tasty! Definitely a keeper!"
"1","4","These are really easy to make. They stayed soft just the way my family likes them even after two days. I read some of the other reviews about the cookie batter turning crumbly. I used Country Crock Spread and didn’t have a problem with the batter being too hard."
"1","4","Was a big hit for playgroup cookie decorating. i like them more fluffy but these were a little crunchy (could have been my own fault) but were very tasty. i ran out of sugar and substituted powdered sugar and was still great! (remember 2 cups p. sugar = 1 c white sugar. Thanks"
"1","2","So far all I can see is that everyone is rating these cookies fairly high. I'm making them now, I'm not that impressed, they do not look like the picture posted here. I will be trying a different one next time. Sorry."
"1","5","This was my first time making just plain sugar cookies, and they turned out awesome! The recipe was easy, and I followed the advice of others on here and added a little more vanilla and rolled them in red and green sugar - GREAT RECIPE! Thanks!"
"1","5","My husband who's very picky about cookies raved about these!!"
"1","5","Loved it-- especially the no rolling it out part. Added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. cream of tartar. Fantastic!"
"1","5","These live up to their name: EASY sugar cookies. I followed the recipe exactly rolling the balls in colored sugar. They were delicious, melt in your mouth cookies."
"1","5","these are awesome sugar cookies. i agree with another person that said take them out at about 8 minutes- they come out very soft and delicious. i don't really like crunchy sugar cookies so THIS is the recipe I was looking for. I actually made them around Halloween and put homemade icing on top and they were amazing- best recipe hands down. the only problem i had was using a 'teaspoonful' and rounding them... they came out looking like silver dollars. so i just made them a little bigger and it was perfect. i'll be making these for Christmas :)"
"1","5","The 'kids' ( in their 20s ) have eaten the entire batch in less than 5 hours. I just put out more butter to soften for tomorrow. I agree with reviewers. Make sure your butter is SUPER softened."
"1","5","DELICIOUS! I was worried because the batter was really crumbly so I added a tsp. of water and another egg. They turned out fabulous!"
"1","5","This was a great easy recipe I made them for my boyfriend and he loved them!! Thanks"
"1","2","I have never been a big fan of sugar cookies, and these didn't taste bad but were a pain to make. I used this recipe,for a Christmas party let the butter get really soft and they still turned out more like cake or biscuits then chewy sugar cookies. I also found it difficult to get them cut out because the dough was so soft even after refegeration for a couple of hours. I am still looking for a good recipe."
"1","3","I wanted easy and that's all that I got. These were bland, bland, bland. I added more vanilla and even a little lemon extract. I wound up making a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar to put on top to make them edible."
"1","4","A simple and wonderful recipe! I've made it several times already! Some of the texture issues other users have complained about seem to occur as a result of serving variations. This therefore changes the overall amount ofingredients in the recipe.Though it's nothing an intermediate baker can't fix. Delicious! Try making a little nook in the center of the cookie prior to baking and put little dollop of your favorite preserve in it.Fun and tasty."
"1","5","Great Cookies"
"1","3","Like the recipe says they are easy, but they are not the best ever sugar cookies so I went with 3 stars for 'good'. I did like them, but will be also trying other recipes. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","good clean yummy"
"1","5","These were super easy to make, had everything on hand in my pantry. They were delicious, too! I used vegan butter (Earth's Balance) to make them dairy free (for my son who's allergic to milk) and it worked beautifully."
"1","5","What everyone else is saying is correct. Cook for exactly 8 minutes only. Make sure the butter is completely soft. Dough is easy to work with. I just rolled the dough in my hand. I also pressed the dough balls into colored sugar. Just the tops and they came out perfect."
"1","5","Very easy and very good. I did not change the recipe. Melted butter in microwave since I forgot to take it out of the refrigerator.... Recomend this to anyone! We had fun making snowmen by just making three different size dough balls.... The dough tasted good even before baking it,(not a recomendation)"
"1","4","These are delicious, they get a 4 not due to taste but because we had to add milk as the dough was too crumbly. We put 1 cup of sugar not 1 1/2, next time we are going to use brown sugar, as we love the flavor of it."
"1","5","My 5 year old son and I made these this afternoon, so easy and delicious! We crushed up some candy canes and sprinkled them on top while they were cooling, he loves them!"
"1","5","This is the easiest cookie recipe I've ever used. And SO good! I used only 1 1/4 cups sugar in the recipe, then used the remaining 1/4 cup to roll the cookies before baking. And today, I rolled them in colored sugar for xmas. So cute!"
"1","5","How can anyone mess this recipe up??? These are amazing! Any good cook/baker knows different weather situations/altitudes change a recipe, and these are very hard to not fix if yours come out incorrectly! If your cookie turned out tasting like popcorn...what the heck? Did you use sweet butter? not salty? Thank you SO much for putting this EASY recipe up, it truly was a cinch."
"1","5","Easy and quite good - I found a great raspberry icing recipe and iced the cookies with that, and they turned out great!"
"1","4","Pretty easy to make. I found that refrigerating the dough and using it a day or 2 later makes them a bit better. But other than that, it's a nice, simple recipe."
"1","5","This is by far the BEST sugar cookie recipe I have ever came across! It makes the perfect soft, buttery cookie you have ever tasted! They came out PERFECT when cooked, in a gas oven, for 8 minutes. The dough was so easy, my 8 year old son did everything but the measuring! He had a blast rolling the dough into balls. It was great because the dough doesn't have to be chilled. I am a HUGE fan of Subway's sugar cookies and this recipe is the closest I have ever came, to comparing it, to theirs. For christmas, I believe we will bake a few more batches and roll them in holiday colored sugars for Santa to enjoy on Christmas Eve ;) I highly recommend trying this recipe. Follow the steps just like it calls for and they will turn out perfect!"
"1","5","Excellent cookie you can make any time! Don't hesitate to make this cookie!"
"1","5","Spectacular cookie! After many failed recipes, I followed this one to the 't' and it turned out soooo tasty. Make sure the butter is soft!"
"1","5","These cookies are so simple and delicious! I didn't have time to wait for the butter to soften all the way, so I just nuked it in the microwave for ten seconds and it was soft, but still solid. I had to bake mine an average of 9-10 minutes, and they came out crispy on the outside, soft on the inside- just the way I like them! I have a feeling my housemates will be pleased when they wake up in the morning =)"
"1","5","This is an almost perfect recipe. To make it absolutely perfect, sprinkle sea salt on the raw cookies before baking. Trust me, you won't regret it."
"1","5","This was my first time making sugar cookies and it was PERFECT! I didn't change anything about it, and reading reviews, I made sure the butter was completely softened before starting. The only thing I did was add some cinnamon on top of the baked cookies. I'll be making these a lot! Thanks!"
"1","5","This recipe is perfect! I honestly don't know what is wrong with all of the negative reviews. My 8 yearold daughter can make these unsupervised and they come out perfect every time!"
"1","4","I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies came out flat. I added more flour and finally got cookies that didn't collapse when I took them out of the oven. I added 1/2 cup more flour. I would make these again. :)"
"1","5","I am not usually a sugar cookie fan, but these were delicious! I make them for the kids and my husband...I think I might hide a few of these!! They were moist and thick!"
"1","5","I've made alot alot alot of sugar cookies in my business, but I really feel these are one of the best out there. I did soften the butter and that worked great. No need to change anything. This is the first time I reviewed, Thanks for the recipes"
"1","5","This Cookie is delicious! I've been looking for a really good sugar cookie recipe for a long time, and this one wins. It's a bit too soft to make shapes with, but I didn't really care. I made them all into even sized circles, and they looked and tasted great. My coworkers raved about them, and ask me for them every week now."
"1","4","I made these just as directed and I found the flavor to be just right. They did come out a bit flat and I'm not sure how to fix this problem. I also added toffee bits to some of them, coconut to others, toffee and coconut to some, and left some plain and all of them were delicious, but the toffee bits were my favorite."
"1","5","I can't much judge these cookies themselves because I always add things to them, but I can recommend wonderful additions! Last time I made these, I substituted apple sauce for the egg (about 1/3 cup) although egg can be used, too. Additionally, I sprinkled ground cinnamon into the dough (to taste) and also added three packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Cinnamon Apple. This gives it a nostalgic, sweet autumn taste. The applesauce, however, often results in a cakey texture which often ends up better the next day. That's great with a glass of milk (or soy milk - the sweetness of soy milk is great with these cookies). The only difficult thing was trying to figure out how to describe them to people... 'Apple Cinnamon-Sugar Oatmeal Cookies'?"
"1","3","Well the taste like a sugar cookie but they certainly didn't turn out like the photo. I followed everything, but they looked like flat biscuits! LOL, they are ok. But cook and judge for yourself... I guess I'll have to try again..."
"1","5","These cookies are the best tasting sugar cookies I have ever had. They were easy, used no unusual ingredients and my 8 year old helped and could have practically made them himself. There are endless possibilities with food coloring and colored sugars and sprinkles as well! Awesome!"
"1","5","WOW!!! These cookies were the BEST!!!! They were SO chewy and yummy! We used margarine instead of butter, added a 1/2 tsp of extra baking powder, and 1/2 cup of extra flour. The kids and I rolled them in some colored sugar before putting them in the oven...baked them on a stone (which I swear by for good chewy cookies) for about 10 minutes...Mmmmm!! Delicious! I have been looking for a no fuss sugar cookie for years...but none of them turned out very well. This recipe is definitely a keeper...it was SO simple...we had great tasting sugar cookies in no time!!!! THANKS!!!!"
"1","5","I rolled the cookies in white sugar. They came out beautiful and they tasted great! I've been looking for a great sugar cookie recipe for a long time and this is it for me!!"
"1","5","the first time I've made sugar cookies from scratch... amazing!"
"1","5","Great cookies, very easy to make."
"1","5","i have made these cookies countless times and i always get rave reviews. i dont roll the dough in sugar or add any other decorations (although you obviously can!), but i find that they are just delicious plain."
"1","5","Very very good! Must have butter softened though. Even my 11 month old couldn't stop eating them! Will make again very soon!"
"1","5","YUM! These were chewy, crispy and delicious!! The only thing I changed was I added an extra TSP of vanilla. I now finally have a GOOD sugar cookie recipe!! Will definately be making these again!!!"
"1","5","Finally, an easy sugar cookie recipe that tastes great! Definitely worth the amount of butter for the taste, most recipes have about a cup of vegetable oil and they just don't taste the same. This will be a permanent recipe in my collection!"
"1","5","these were awesome, easy & delicious! the only thing i did different was, add almond meal as i didn't have enough flour. so 2 cups flour and 3/4 cup almond meal, which gave it a nutty taste and texture. these were really divine. thank you!!!"
"1","5","Super easy...tastes great!!! Don't change a thing. Make sure the butter is room temp."
"1","5","perfect-o!!!! i added a little cinnamon and it was the perfect snickerdoodle."
"1","5","Easy and excellent! Received many compliments and requests for recipe. Took advice of using two eggs and two tsp. vanilla."
"1","5","I fixed a batch of these with my boys and my mom. We had the best time, Raisins on some and candies nd sprinkles I love these they are so flexible."
"1","5","LOVED these!! My only suggestion is to roll the dough in a little sugar before baking them."
"1","4","pretty good, BASIC recipe. If you're looking for plain jane this is the recipe for you! Simple, Easy and quick!"
"1","3","You need to melt the butter COMPLETELY and add another teaspoon of vanilla for good flavor. They're really good when they're warm, and the dough is good too. :) When they're cooled down they are a little bland. When they get a little bland, they're still good and sweet!"
"1","1","2 3/4 cups flour was not enough, and I knew I should've added more when the dough was not dough at all but more like a runny goo. when I tried to cook them anyway, they spread and flattened and were just greasy, flat, tasteless."
"1","5","I added a little lemon zest and it was heaven!"
"1","5","My friends are clamoring for the recipe, and I always have all these ingredients....the perfect cookie! I dip the tops of mine in granulated sugar, and they are marvelous."
"1","4","Pretty good cookies. The bottoms burn easily so I reduced the cooking time down to 6 minutes. My oven bakes about right on the money, not too hot or cold. Let them cool on the sheet for a minute or two before you remove them as well."
"1","5","These cookies were delicious. I followed another reviewers advice and took them out after the 8-10 minutes even though I didn't think they looked done. But they were and they tasted great!"
"1","4","Very easy and satisfying recipe. I pressed the balls before baking onto colored sugar and it made them very festive."
"1","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe! I do not wait for my butter to soften i just put it in the microwave till it is soft not melted! these cookies are mistake proof not sure why people say they come out hard or fall apart! I'm getting ready to make these again right now because we love this recipe so much this time going to add almond extract because i can't find a good almond cookie recipe anywhere!. I'm sure this recipe with almond is awesome!"
"1","5","Turned out soft and chewy. I added half of a lemons juice and all the zest of one lemon, great fresh favor!!!!!"
"1","5","these sugar cookies were very fast, easy, and after i made them i think i gained five pounds eating them.... delish!!!!"
"1","4","This recipe is very good. Although i am not a big fan of things that are sweet, i love this recipe after i do a few minor adjustments: a little bit less sugar, 2tsp brown sugar, and 2large eggs. I love this recipe!"
"1","5","These were amazing I will use this recipe again. Use it! Its amazing!"
"1","4","I followed someone else's recommendations and used melted butter and added another 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I also sprinkled extra sugar because it needed more sweetness. It's a great recipe for a base sugar cookie that you could easily add chocolate or nuts too."
"1","5","SOOOOOOO DELISH! I haven't made a bad recipe from this site yet! WHOOOPS i wanted to make more and ran out of butter so I replaced with veg oil, and that was NOT a good idea, dough just crumbled."
"1","4","This is a good basic recipe, but it needs a pinch of salt."
"1","5","Yummy! Tasted great with or without frosting. Take them out at or before 10 minutes even if they look white, that way the cookies stay soft after cooling."
"1","4","make sure your oven is on the right temp and HOT but they are very good and take around 10 minutes"
"1","5","I thought this was an excellent recipe. I added a tad bit more vanilla flavor."
"1","5","Great sugar cookies! I made these cookies with my son. We made sure the butter was softened as the other reviewers suggested. The cookies came out so buttery and delicious my family gobbled them up. Best of all, they really were easy and quick."
"1","5","Really buttery and yummy. I did add a little nutmeg and cinnamon and was probably a little generous with the vanilla, but very good, easy recipe!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe as is and they came out wonderful. My husband and his friend love them. I could bake a batch and they would be gone by the next morning :)."
"1","5","I halved this recipe, since it seemed like too much to make all of it, and it worked out great. I like to make my cookies bigger, so they were flatter, but still very good and chewy. I gave this recipe to my boyfriend in Sweden, and he loves it! They don't make cookies often there so he had a lot of fun and loved the finished product. Great recipe!"
"1","5","This cookies were VERY VERY GREAT, lol!! I did roll the dough in sugar and cinnamon before I baked the cookies and they were delish!!"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious.."
"1","5","I substituted Earth Balance margarine for butter, so I wasn't sure if they'd come out as great as the reviews promised, BUT they were perfect!!! at 8 minutes they were the perfect texture crispy around the edges but still chewy. And the flavor was buttery too! This is THE recipe for sugar cookies!!!"
"1","5","This is by far one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've ever found!! They are so easy and delicious! My husband loved them! Also, if you roll them in cinnamon and sugar, they make a great snickerdoodle!!"
"1","5","Great sugar cookie recipe. Works great for cut out! They sold well at our bake sale and I'll use this one again!"
"1","5","OMG! These are the best sugar cookies ever. I didn't cook them longer than 10 minutes, so they were light and chewy. One batch was in for about 12 minutes and when cooled they were a little crunchy. I prefer chewy, so between 8-10 minutes is best. Otherwise, I made no changes to the recipe. I wish there was a lock on the cookie jar because my family has eaten almost all of them already (myself included)! I will keep this recipe forever, and I will never buy a sugar cookie from Pillbury, Nestle, or a cookie bakery again... These are better!"
"1","4","Super easy recipe, I added a little extra vanilla and rolled it in a brown sugar, cinnamon and mini chips mixture. They are fantastic! Will use this recipe again."
"1","5","These cookies are sooo good! Will totaly make these again!!"
"1","4","Very good!"
"1","5","Make sure not to undercook them they are decieving when in the oven. The are amazing when cooked right!"
"1","5","A little bit more cakey than I would like, but overall an outstanding flavour. I made these into massive sugar cookies. The only modification was to add a little bit of butter extract."
"1","5","this is one of the best receipes, cookies came out great without the mess."
"1","5","The best sugar cookies to make!"
"1","4","Very tasty! One reveiewer said to make these small becuase they spread like crazy. I did not find this to be the case at all! I would recommend to make little balls and flatten them just slightly. I also added about 1 1/2 TBS of fresh chopped rosemary to the cookies and it was delicious!"
"1","5","I'm not done cooking them yet, but the batter is AMAZING!!! I can tell just by the taste and texture that it will be GREAT!!! The only reason why I gave it a 5, is because you can't go any higher!!! I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and I made mine with chocolate chips. I love these cookies!!! And best of all, it makes so many,I can give them to my neighbors for Memorial Day. AWESOME COOKIES!!! I am sooo doing them again!!!! - just finished! really good, but a tiny bit dry... next time I'll try adding some milk...."
"1","2","I was not a fan of these cookies. They were tasteless and dry. They were a bit like scones. To improve them I would add water/milk and more sugar...... only 2 stars for me."
"1","5","These cookies turned out GREAT! I decided to make them after all the great reviews. I didn't have any vanilla extract so decided to use 1 tsp. lemon juice and 1 tsp of pancake syrup. They turned out awesome!"
"1","5","I love this recipe. It's so versatile. I have wrapped the dough around chocolate, made snickerdoodles from it, added cranberries, white chocolate chips and orange zest - all have been wonderful! Thanks!"
"1","4","Really good but they fell a little flat. I didn't use vanilla extract though. Next time i will add a little flour to help keep shape."
"1","5","Perfect cookie every time! These are great~ follow recipe EXACTLY, meaning... use butter at room temperature. If you must substitute, use Earth Balance. I put in an extra dose of vanilla, but that is only for personal preference. Test your oven on the first batch for your time at your altitude. You won't be disappointed!!! It's a keeper!"
"1","5","Holy these are tasty!! Sugar cookies have always been my downfall, but these are GREAT!! Lightly crispy around the edges, soft and chewy center. And not bland at all! They are soooo tasty! I halved the recipe, but still used one whole egg (hoping to make them a bit fluffy rather than all crispy-success!). My husband is going back for more--I'm right behind him!"
"1","5","So like most women, it's almost that time of the month and I want to eat anything sweet. So I decided to try this recipe to curb my sweet tooth. I'd say they're the easiest cookies to make and they look as perfect as they taste. Thanks for a great recipe that was not only quick and easy, but was just what I needed!"
"1","5","Simple, easy and they ROCK!"
"1","5","These cookies were so good, I didn't change a thing. They didn't take very long to make, I love that you don't have to refrigerate them. I will definatly make these cookies again."
"1","5","I recommend cooking them for 7 minutes and 30 seconds... they came out perfect!"
"1","5","These cookies were delicious! Just perfect! Definitely make sure that the butter is completely soft because that makes all the difference in making sure that they aren't crumbly. Everyone has LOVED them, they can't stop talking about how yummy they are! And the recipe was SO quick and easy!"
"1","5","these are awesome! and they get better and better each time i make them. my family LOVES them!!!! :)"
"1","5","After mixing the butter and sugar, I realized I was out of vanilla. Who runs out of vanilla? I substituted almond extract and the cookies turned out great. These are the best (and easiest) sugar cookies I've ever made. I frosted with a touch of cream cheese frosting and added pastel sprinkles for Easter. My husband loved them! Just hope the kids do, too."
"1","5","The ease of this recipe to make makes me want to make them every night... not to mention that they are so delicious they are my new favorite kind of cookie. I did do one thing a little different... after rolling the dough into balls I rolled them around in sugar.. made them so beautiful. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Couldn't get any easier than this recipe! I was looking for something to bake and realized I only had one egg and ran across this recipe. It was very, very good and super easy. I will try m&m's in them the next time for a little twist but definitely a keeper."
"1","5","a great tasting recipe that's so easy my 'hates to be in the kitchen' husband could - and did - do it with wonderful results. do make sure the butter is very soft before beginning."
"1","5","So here i am, it's 11pm wednesday night when i realize that i forgot to go out and buy some good old break'n'bakes for my creative writing class tomorrow. my mom refuses to take me to the grocery store so i'm forced to google some recipes with only ingredients contained in my household. these cookies were simple to assemble, easy and fun to roll into balls and were a pinch to clean up. the result was perfect every time; a soft, warm, suprisingly rich and buttery, sweet sugar cookie. these cookies are easy and delicious and will be gone in a flash tomorrow in class."
"1","5","This has to be the easiest cookie recipe I've ever tried that yields a nice product. No rolling, no chilling... just mix and bake. Perfect babysitter project!"
"1","3","Well I thought this recipe was ok, but not the best! It says don't grease the pan, GREASE IT! Also instead of using butter, I used margarine. Also Cook a little longer than it says, for about 15 minutes for the perfect soft cookies. Only put about 6 cookies on a tray, because they get really big. about 3 inches wide. Also they taste alot better if you sprinkle a little sugar on top of them. Follow these directions, and you'll get better cookies!! trust me!"
"1","5","LOVE LOVE LOVED this recipe! I made it tonigh with my 14 month old son and we had a blast, with a fantastic result! The only change I made was adding twice the amount of vanilla cuz we love that taste here! Thanks for a great recipe!!"
"1","5","I have been on the search for the best sugar cookies which don't require rolling out and these are it! They are even better than the sugar cookies my grandma used to make--more buttery and they rose beautifully where the ones my grandma made, although still good, were drier and flater. It can be hard to tell when these cookies are done, but I followed the reviewer Amy Yvonne's tip to take out the cookies when the tops are just starting to crack. Then I let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before putting on the wire racks. They turned out great--soft but chewy. They are not too sweet, so I rolled them in raw turbinado sugar before baking them to give them some more sweetness and texture."
"1","4","This recipe was VERY EASY!!! It was VERY dry though, I forgot to roll it out... will use this recipe again!"
"1","5","These cookies are absolutely delicious! They are so easy to make... my 6 y/o son had a blast helping me! I made them with the Smart Balance 50/50 sticks and they turned out wonderfully. Some of the best I've ever had. This is a true keeper!"
"1","5","These are awesome! Not a lot of prep time like cut-outs, and easy for the kids. We make a buttercream frosting and the kids decorate the top!"
"1","5","These were the best sugar cookies I have EVER had! My husband didn't want to stop eating them."
"1","5","This is truly an honest buttery-tasting cookie which goes together quickly and nicely. I have made this recipe five times in the past month, and everyone raves about it. I like to decorate with a shimmering sanding sugar or a colored sugar. I normally prefer a softer cookie; however, this one, although crisp, melts in your mouth with a delicious buttery flavor. As suggested, I use 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Otherwise, do not alter this recipe. Also, do not use unsalted butter in this recipe. I strongly recommend this as a cookie to 'always have on hand' since it appeals to people of all ages."
"1","5","I have to say this is the best sugar cookie recipe I've tried. I've been on a quest to find the perfect one- after trying this one- I threw all my other sugar cookie recipes away!"
"1","5","Awesome cookies!!! I did add the almond extract and it was a nice touch. Will be making these cookies over and over again."
"1","5","I suck at baking and this recipe was a snap. Love it."
"1","5","Fantastic recipie... also works well with the splenda sugar blend"
"1","5","These cookies were delicous I made them for a party and I had no left overs. I made the Original and then with the left over dough I added chocolate chips and then with the leftovers after that I added cinnamon!! They were so easy to makev:)"
"1","4","My mom says she really liked these cookies. What made them extra good and the second batch better was when she rolled them in sugar before baking. This gives a little extra crispness to the outside and they are chewy inside."
"1","1","i read the reviews and the sounded great but when i made them i was curious b/c the dough was very very crumby but after baked the were all dough inj the middle and completly burned on the bottom"
"1","5","I am very impressed by this recipe! I needed an easy recipe to bake cookies for my students and the kids at my children's school. The cookies were FAB! They were not too sweet, soft, and delicious! The only thing I added was a bit more vanilla for flavor. Thanks a bunch!"
"1","5","So easy to make-- and seriously, the BEST sugar cookies! They taste just like the ones you buy in tubs from kids raising money. The color is wonderful. You can't really beat it for the time it took and the taste. Will keep this recipe around."
"1","5","These were very good!! I added a teaspoon of almond extract along with the vanilla. They would also be good rolled in sugar!!"
"1","3","I don't know if it had to do with the way I prepared my butter or my flour or sugar or whatever, but these things don't taste so great. My boyfriend likes them, but the rest of my friends agreed that they're both bland and similar to biting into raw sugar at the same time. I'll probably look for a different recipe next time I make sugar cookies."
"1","5","This Recipe was Perfect. I was looking for a good cookie recipe that only had ingredients that we kept in the house. Not only were the ingredients convenient, the recipe was easy to follow and the cookies tasted great. I will be making these on a regular basis. Note: If you don't use a mixer, this recipe will strengthen your arms. :)"
"1","5","These were awesome! I am very picky about my sugar cookies as we are not into frosting them. They have to be able to be soft and chewy for half my family and crispy but moist for the other half...all from the same recipe. These worked wonderfully!"
"1","5","I'm making these right now - I just tasted one and they are AWESOME!. I used to own a cookie business, but never had sugar cookies on the brochure. I could tell just by the dough texture that these were going to be excellent. They're buttery, melt in your mouth and have just the right amount of sugar. This is a recipe going straight into my file, not only for sugar cookies, but a great base for other flavors. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","easy, great taste, and need more? you can do anything you want with these cookies."
"1","5","A great recipe to just have fun with. Add an extra tsp of vanilla and use room temperature butter, but other than that no changes are needed. Roll the dough in flavored sugar, crushed candy canes, sprinkles or be unoriginal and use plain old sugar. :)"
"1","4","I suspect this recipe could be improved by balancing ingredients for a more supple batter, but my quick fix for crumbling batter is simply working it by hand after all the dry ingredients have been added. The heat introduced by folding and shaping by hand is enough to soften the batter. Also added extra vanilla extract as other reviewers have done, as well as 1/2 tsp orange extract for zest."
"1","5","A great, basic sugar cookie. You MUST start with soft butter. This should be a given for just about any cookie recipe though. I pressed the balled cookie dough just slightly, then pressed them lightly in table sugar. Wonderful!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe and so did my husband! just a tip as soon as I took them out of the oven, I sprinkled cinnamon and suagr over top even before I took them off the sheet. They were GREAT!!"
"1","5","I made these and they were so good! I put them in for 9 minutes and the edges came out crunchy and the middle was soft but not too soft! De-lish!! I will definitely make these again."
"1","5","My daughter in culinary arts turned me on to this recipe. My favorite cookie is the sugar cookie, and have tried several different recipes over the years (i.e. grandma's sour cream sugar cookies, grandma's old-fashioned sugar cookies, several sugar cookie recipes from the church recipe book, etc., but this cookie recipe is the best. What a terrific find! I'll still make grandma's sour cream sugar cookies every so often, but this is the default sugar cookie in our home now."
"1","5","These are the best! They are so easy to make. I took the advice from a few members and rolled them into balls (I used a cookie scoop to get the same uniform shape & size) them rolled them into sugar. WOW, what a great cookie."
"1","5","Awesome cookie recipe! I used the margarine tip from a review (that's what I had at home). Cookies are great tasting and cook beautifully. I have also used this recipe for the base of a fruit pizza."
"1","4","good and easy recipe--I was able to make just over five dozen cookies."
"1","5","AWESOME!!! I love sugar cookies and these were very easy and have great flavor. I adjusted the recipe slightly. I only had unsalted butter so I used it with a pinch or two of salt. I also used Splenda for baking and they turned out wonderfully. Thanks for a great recipe that is sure to become a Christmas staple."
"1","5","I made these exactly according to the recipe, using a Kitchen Aid mixer. I took another reviewers advice and rolled it out between sheets of wax paper and they were awesome!"
"1","5","I can't stop eating them!!! These cookies are excellent!! I added and extra tsp of vanilla as suggested by others. I rolled these cookies in colored sugar before baking. I had to cook then a few extra minutes but otherwise a very good recipe."
"1","5","I'm with the other melodramatic woman! I have searched and searched for 15 yrs for a great sugar cookie recipe always being dissapointed every yr. but this yr I found this one and this is it!! I was sooo excited I wanted to cry! I made 2 batches for Christmas, rolling them out and cutting them into cute shapes. Some we iced & some we didn't. They were GONE in 2 days! I had to make more last night. They are AMAZING! A little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Just a treat for your palate.. not your butt though. ~Be advised: if you make this.. you will eat a lot! ;)"
"1","1","THESE COOKIES DID NOT SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST, THEREFORE I'D SAY THEY WERE GOOD. The blender idea-not so great though. Cookie dough splattered everywhere and made quite a mess.   :) but they sure are yummy when finished and frosted."
"1","5","Best sugar cookie recipe hands down. I make this anytime of the year. Top it off with buttercream frosting and you will love it. I didn't have enough butter tonight to make these so used half butter and half butter flavored crisco and they were great (but butter is my favorite). Thanks for sharing this recipe-- our family loves it!"
"1","1","these cookies...spontaneously combusted in all of 3 seconds after i had checked on them. i turned my back for a few seconds and then all the sudden my fire alarm goes off and my kitchen was on fire!! its all wrong 2 and 3/4 cups of flour ha! it should be more like 4 cups!! and don't get me started on the sugar."
"1","4","Not being a fan of thin sugar cookies I had trepidations about the results but this recipe has changed my opinion of sugar cookies forever. A note when using caster (super fine) sugar reduce the sugar to 1 ¼ cups due to the higher packing fraction."
"1","5","WOW this is amazing!!! Do not overbake it i know it seems very soft. Also I put a little extra vanilla and some cinnamon."
"1","5","You should add a wee bit more butter...it makes the cookies stay soft for days!"
"1","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe ever! As an American living in Australia for the last 16 years this is one cookie I really miss. Will make this recipe again. By the way, I converted the butter to metric but left the rest in Imperial. This seems to work with most recipes that are from the US."
"1","4","Not as soft as I had hoped, but they were great. My boyfriend can't stop eating them! I used these and decorated them with frosting and sprinkles. Came out nice. Will make again!"
"1","5","Finally a GREAT sugar cookie. Everyone I ever tried tasted like dough.  Has anyone tried to Roll/Refrigerate this dough,Then cut and cook?"
"1","4","These were very good straight out of the oven, but were not as soft the next day. I do recommend rolling in sugar if you like a sweet cookie - I made it both without and with, and I definitely preferred the ones that had been rolled in sugar. If you are able to make the cookies the day you need them, I would not hesitate to recommend this recipe! Otherwise I may keep looking."
"1","5","Good and easy."
"1","5","Just like everyone else is saying - this is a simple, delicious recipe! I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and baked 8 - 8.5 minutes. I pressed the top of the rounded cookie dough balls into colored sugar prior to baking - so pretty!"
"1","5","easy & delicious"
"1","5","So yummy! Came out beautifully!"
"1","5","FABULOUS! I don't have the patience to roll out dough or wait for it to refrigerate, so this was perfect! They stayed nice and soft (as long as we took them out of the oven soon enough). Great recipe!"
"1","5","Thanks so much.. have tried several recipes with the kids to make and decorate, trying with cookie cutters etc.. this was soooo much nicer, easy to make, and the kids had alot more fun just with colored sugar and candy.. less stressful lol.. and the best part is that they taste great!!!"
"1","5","This recipe was incredibly easy and soooo yummy. I made them on Saturday night to bring to the office on Monday, and by Sunday my family had eaten almost all of them! No complaints, they turned out great!"
"1","2","I must be doing something wrong, with all the 5 star ratings for these. Even though I used room temperature Butter Flavored Crisco, these cookie were CRUMMY! I increased the vanilla to 1.5 teaspoons. Dough had problems holding together. After test cooking 3 cookies on my GE Profile Advantium 120, at 350 for 7 minutes, they were crisp/tender, but I had to press the crumbs between the palms of my hands to get it to form a cookie. I added a second egg to the remaining dough and with the second batch in the oven, they didn't quite get done, broke apart semi baked. I am disappointed. They did puff a bit, which was nice."
"1","5","Really easy, really yummy! I was a little surprised at how flat and somewhat crispy they were...but ended up liking them that way."
"1","5","Fantastic! These are hands down the easiest and tastiest sugar cookies. I love that you don't have to chill the dough. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out delicious. I cooked mine the full 10 minutes and the were lightly golden on the edge and still soft and chewy in the center. A perfect holiday cookie. Next time I think I'll top them with a little cinnamon and sugar."
"1","4","I give this 4 stars because the cookies were delicious... however they are not very good for cutting shapes out of them... they were just a little too soft for that."
"1","5","My four year old and I made these last night. She wanted to make something herself for Thanksgiving. It was super easy to make for her. We did make sure the butter was very soft after reading the reviews. These came out perfect!"
"1","4","These are great for a quick cookie project with the kids. I melted the butter totally first, added 2 tsp of vanilla, and substituted 1/4 cup of butter for canola oil. They turned out great and chewy. Thanks!"
"1","5","Super simple recipe! I'm a military guy who likes to entain my daughters with sweet treats. This recipe was terrific. My daughters loved the cookies and I loved the ease."
"1","5","These cookies turned out great. But I did have a problem. My batter turned out really runny so there was no 'forming the batter into a ball'. I had to add more flour. But after they were baked they were great!"
"1","4","I used half the recipe and still used one egg and 1 tsp of vanilla. It was very good!"
"1","4","Dear Stephanie, I would like to apoligise for my last review. The reason the cookies turned out bad, was because of me not you. I am sooooooooooooooooo sorry!!!!"
"1","4","These cookies were deeeeelicious! It was my first time making sugar cookies. This recipe was quick and easy -- perfect for my schedule. I don't really have much time between classes, homework, etc. I did what the previous comments said and used margarine and let it thaw until it's cushy. The cookies turned out perfect. I undercooked my first batch - but practice makes perfect. [=  Hoping to get better after some more practicing! -Kammie"
"1","5","Incredibly easy, quick, soft and delicious! These cookies manage to stay soft and moist for days after being baked and stored - something that doesn't come around with every cookie recipe. I will definitely make this one again!"
"1","5","Just like it says, easy, soft and very tasty with or without icing. My 4yr old wants to bake cookies all the time, so I often 1/2 recipies. I wasn't sure what to do about the 1 egg, so I used the whole egg, the full 1 tsp of vanilla, and added a pinch of salt (I thought it was strange that it wasn't called for). The results were perfect!"
"1","5","These were amazing cookies!! Not only were they convenient to make (no chilling), everything about them was perfect. They were soft and delicious. Just a few notes: I added an additional tsp of vanilla. On half of the batches I made I dipped the cookies in sugar before putting them in the oven. The sugar made them crispier on the outside, but the softness within was unchanged. Also, for maximum softness, serve straight out of the oven. These cookies cold are rather hard..."
"1","3","These sugar cookies are yummy and very easy to make. However they spread very thin and i prefer mine a little thicker. Also cut down cook time to 8 min to allow for chewier cookies!"
"1","5","Just like everyone else is saying, these are SOOO good! Easy to make and absolutely delicious! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 2 tsp of vanilla and made sure my butter was super soft. Will be making again and again, thanks!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies! Everyone loved them and they were easy to make. 1) Make sure to the following: Use around 1 1/2-2 tsps vanilla extract instead of 1. 2) Use butter COMPLETELY at room temperature. 3) Bake only 8 minutes. 4) Space cookies farther apart because these expand alot. 5) Make sure to use fresh baking soda or else your cookies will fall flat."
"1","5","Recipe was yummy. Put sugar on the tops of cookies and then baked them and added a 1/2 box of vanilla pudding(instant.) and one egg yolk extra. Good."
"1","5","These were a delicious, no fuss, sugar cookie. Why wait for sugar cookie dough overnight, when you can use this recipe? Instant gratification!!!"
"1","4","I made these cookies today. They are very tasty! They also are much easier to make than my usual recipe that I make and roll out and cut. They don't look as pretty, however, it cuts down on the time it takes. I made a buttercream frosting and used this to icing the cookies and they were awesome, and it made them look prettier!"
"1","5","This recipe was so easy to follow and the cookies came out great. I even added Decor Sugar Sprinkles before I baked them to add color. All I did was make a flat dent on the top of the cookie and pour the sprinkles on top. That worked very well."
"1","5","made the cookies came out great. this is a great recipe to make with kids. I saw the note to let the butter completly soften, I was inpatient so at the end my dough was not just right so I added a lil margin to get the dough to the right texture... Great recipe"
"1","5","I wish I could rate this recipe even higher than '5'! I mke larger cookies so this recipe made exactly 2 dozen, they were ALL gone in 15 minutes! You really can't eat just one! The only thing I did differently was to use Blue Bonnett stick margarine rather than butter. WONDERFUL!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious & so easy. These were the first cookies I've ever made from scratch & they really were easy. I had to cook them closer to 10 minutes to get them fully cooked through."
"1","5","Well the people who have been giving it 1 star more than likely made it wrong. Goes to show you, better measure carefully, and follow directions or it will not taste good. I know this because the first time I made these I slipped a little too much flour. The batter was dry and crappy, so I added more butter! Fixed:)These cookies are awesome! Simple to make and go a long way!"
"1","1","Julie and I (marissa) have made these cookies. We added all the correct ingredients, and then we put them in for the time that was suggested and we took them out, and we needed to put them in for aprox. 4 more minutes. Julie and I were not too impressed about this, our friends daughter was waiting paitently for this cookies, and then we took them out in excitement, and they were not finished. I do not suggest these cookies for the young and elderly. I do not suggest these sugar cookies to anyone."
"1","5","I love these! Very easy and great taste! They had a nice soft texture on the inside with a slight crunchy outter portion. It's nice to eat a sugar cookie and not go through all the work every time to cut out and decorate!"
"1","4","I would have to say this is a really good recipe... however I altered mine. I increased my flour to 3 1/4 cups. Vanilla to 2 1/2 tsp. I also melted my butter just to the point where it was starting to get runny. I mixed the sugar, baking powder, soda, and vanilla with the butter and slowly whipped in my flour... Baked at 375.. I did once batch at 7 mins and one at 8 mins. Both are extremely tender and chewy even after cooling... the 8 min one just has a crunchier outside."
"1","5","I made these as per Rolanda's tip and made sure that the butter was soft and then creamed the butter and sugar together very well. They turned out great - crispy outside and chewy inside! The only thing was that I had to be careful of the baking time. I found that 7 or 8 min was plenty and any longer made them too hard and brown. It could be just the way my oven is though. I added a pink M&M to the centre of each cookie while they were soft because they were for a friend's daughter's birthday party. Everyone loved them!"
"1","5","Truly the best, easiest cookies. Didn't need to change a thing. Perfect as is. A great recipe!"
"1","5","My niece made a batch of these cookies for Labor Day and every one is still raving over them. We did double the vanilla and baked the cookies for exactly 9 minutes. She iced and decorated them after cooling and they were the only thing NOT left over at the picnic. The were soft and chewy even after cooling. We will definitely make again."
"1","5","Really delicious and easy, will become a house favorite! These don't spread too much-so make 'em big!   I only wish they didn't require two sticks of butter!"
"1","5","yummy! the best ever!"
"1","5","THE COOKIES ARE DELICIOUS, SOFT, CHEWY WITH A CRISPY EDGE. I COOKED THEM FOR 9 MINUTES AND THEY CAME OUT PERFECT. I DID DUST THEM WITH POWDER SUGAR TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE MORE SWEET. MY FAMILY LOVES THEM, AND THEY ARE MY HUSBANDS NEW FAVORITE. ONE BATCH GONE AND ANOTHER ALL READY TO GO. ENJOY!"
"1","5","This recipe was so easy especially for a really bad baker like myself! I followed the recipe except for putting my dough in the fridge for a couple of hours as suggested by another member and I rolled it in cinnamon and sugar like a snickerdoodle. SOOOOOO good. This will be my cookie recipe from now on."
"1","5","These were absolutely great. I used honey instead of vanilla extract and only baked them for 5 minutes."
"1","1","this recipe didnt work at all and disapointed my dear little granddaughter tabbitha from getting her cookies im so disapointed and greatly discourged chose another"
"1","5","8 mo's pregnant and I have been craving sugar cookies with M&M's. This was the most simple and most delicious batch of cookies I have EVER had. They bring me back to my kid days of cookies at the mall"
"1","4","These were very good. I made them for my son's classroom and they were a hit with the kids! I also used margarine instead of butter and found the texture was perfect! I had no issue with the batter at all!"
"1","5","AMAZING! came out absolutely perfect and everyone one loved them, gone in a day, although i added ground pecans to the mix...........LOVED IT!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe four times now.  To be more accurate, every weekend for a month! My husband and daughter LOVE THEM! This is the easiest and best sugar cookie recipe I have found.  I make my cookies large, so I don't get 4 dozen from the recipe. I get 2 dozen from it.  I also mix a tiny bit of milk with a lot of powdered sugar and food coloring to make an icing for the cookies. So yummy!!"
"1","5","I followed Rolanda's advice and softened the butter to a melty-soft consistency and added a little extra vanilla extract as well. These were some of the best sugar cookies I've ever had and they were very simple to make. I'll definitely be making these again in the future."
"1","5","I have to admit I'm not the best at rolling out any dough - but this one was super easy! Not too sticky at all, and it held up. The kids loved making shaped cookies. The taste is wonderful too. Overall, great recipe!"
"1","5","So easy and good. You almost always have everything on hand, so you can whip up a quick batch nice and quick. My husbands favorite is sugar cookies, so this is perfect, and he loves these. I don't smush them down with sugar though because if you leave them in a ball as they cook, they are nice and chewy in the middle."
"1","5","EASY and yummy. You always have the ingredients in your house,so you can make them anytime. I did not cool the dough and cooked for 9 minutes to make slightly crispy with soft centers."
"1","3","They were okay. They didn't have much flavor, and they weren't very sweet, so I dipped the top of each cookie in sugar before letting them cool. The dough was dry and hard to work with, and the taste of the cookies was all-in-all dissapointing."
"1","5","This recipe is so awesome. I shared it with my friends and they all loved it!!!"
"1","4","Very very good - and easy :) I had to add water because the dough was much too dry. Mine were baked in 11 minutes on the TOP rack. I think the bottoms cook too quickly on the center or lower rack."
"1","5","Wow! We LOVED these cookies! My daughter decided to name them Angel Crisps. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I replaced 1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 c. coconut oil and used 1/4 tsp (approx.) of almond extract in lieu of the vanilla. This recipe has so much potential for variations it will be a regular in our house."
"1","5","I mailed these cookies off and the friend didn't get them until 10 days later. He still said they were really good.   A coworker couldn't stop eating them at work.  I gave some to a friend to take home to her husband, and she said he DEVOURED the five cookies.  This is a great recipe if you follow it closely!"
"1","4","I kept scaling back the time these baked in hopes of a softer cookie, but each time (even down to 6 minutes) they came out crunchier than I would have preferred."
"1","5","perfect!"
"1","3","I followed this recipe exactly (twice!) but somehow the mix still came out much much too dry. I don't think as much flour was needed as in the recipe. I added 2 egg replacers to the recipe just to get it wet enough to roll into balls. They were decent cookies, but too much work to make them pliable."
"1","4","Very easy! ...but for us, not so 'quick' Took us 2 hours. But that's probably because we were having too much fun shaping the cookies. ahem. Well, we used organic sugar. I might use less next time, as it was a little too sweet! And sometimes the dough was crumbly, and hard to shape into balls (we used our hands). It's a pretty dry dough. I wasn't sure whether to put water in it or not...in the end, we didn't, and they turned out fine! Also, it's better to leave it in the oven longer, since it doesn't finish baking very quickly!  I had fun with this recipe with my friends, it's worth trying :)  PS: don't put very thick chunks of dough into the oven, or they won't turn out very well :D"
"1","5","Beautiful and simple cookies - what more do you need in life!! I might consider using lemon zest next time I use this recipe."
"1","5","I made these using all organic ingredients and they were perfect. It made 47 silver dollar sized cookies!!"
"1","5","I love these cookies! I change em a bit- I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and use 1/4 cup butter 1/4 cup apple sauce to cut down the fat a little. I usually ice them. What's great about these is that they stay moist for a couple days- if they last that long!"
"1","5","I came looking for an easy soft no roll sugar cookie that that tasted great and I found it!"
"1","5","Oh my gosh what can I say! These are AWESOME cookies! I only put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes and I was able to make shapes without a problem! We frosted them with canned frosting from the store without a problem. I ate a cookie two days after making them and it tasted the same as it did the day they were made! DELICIOUS! Highly recommended."
"1","5","this cookie doesnt taste very tastey...i had to add mad sugar yo...freakin..BOOOOOOO!!!!and yo they dnt have enuf butter in the recipe..i looked this shazz up and it needs an extra stick of but"
"1","5","I added almond extract and the kids really liked them. they were flatter than the cookies i usually make. I was very pleased with the ease of this recipe. thanks:)"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious. Maybe it was just me, but the recipe doesn't quite yeild 4 dozen. I doubled it and got only about 6 dozen, which didn't suit my need very well."
"1","5","I'm a huge cookie lover and these are on the top of my list! They were a tad plain, so i added m&ms to make them 100% more delicious! Thanks for a quick easy recipe that made the day for millions of children!"
"1","4","Very good, quick sugar cookies. I was happy to find one that doesn't require an hour of refrigeration. My only complaint is that they are a little dry...maybe it's just how I made them."
"1","5","I loved this recipe! It was great and so easy to make. The first batch burned a little because I was not paying attention but the rest of the cookies came out beautifully. This is a great recipe to add on sprinkles, almonds, chocolate chips or anything you can think of to decorate the cookies. This is a great recipe to get creative with and it is very versatile. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great sugar cookie. Yummy!!!"
"1","5","I thought they they were perfect and found that if you switch the measurements of the baking soda and baking powder they had a tast when they were done that just melted in your mouth and if you dont like the taste of the baking powder and baking soda I think that adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the recipe instead of one made it very satisfing.  Claire"
"1","3","The recipe was good, but it needed some adjustments. I would suggest making it with 2 eggs, not just 1, because the consistency of the dough was not right. Also, if you add about 1/2 tsp of almond extract the cookies will have much more flavor."
"1","5","These are delicate and delightful! I've made them as written and they are tasty, but I prefer to leave out the vanilla and use two teaspoons of almond extract instead. Gorgeous.   Also, for others like me who prefer to dirty only one bowl: It works perfectly well to mix the wet ingredients first, then pile the dry ingredients on top. You can gently stir the baking powder and baking soda into the flour with a fork -- then fold all of the ingredients together. You may want to knead the dough with your hands as it's rather flaky and a little hard to mix with a spatula/spoon/etc. Bakes up lovely, though!"
"1","5","This is one of the best sugar cookie recipes iv ever come across! 5+ stars! (i did use slightly less flour and added a small amount of almond extract)"
"1","5","I always find it funny how one recipe could have two totally different outcomes. When I read reviews for this recipe, I read some say it's crumbly so it's hard to work with and some others said it was too sticky to work with. I didn't know which ones to believe until I made my own. I thought the batter was perfect to work with (keep in mind I didn't use cookie cutters) just making round cookies. It was chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, PERFECT! However, I did use 'I cannot believe it's not butter spread instead of real butter and doubled the vanilla. I did put frosting on them and placed one bunny marshmallow on top for Easter. This is the best sugar cookie I ever tasted and I sure will make them again! Thank you!"
"1","2","These cookies taste good but do not use this recipe if you want cut-out cookies. They spread out so much you cannot tell what the shape is!"
"1","5","This recipe is the easiest 'from scratch' recipe I've ever made! It really wowed my husband and friends. And it makes enough cookies for an army! They are delicious, and I have to admit, I'm not a very good cook. So -- I have to recommend it to everyone. Especially if you are a broke college student! I didn't have any baking powder or baking soda, so I had to leave that out, but the cookies were still way better then anything you can buy at the store. When I took them out of the oven, I melted a little butter on the tops and sprinkled them with sugar. Delish!!!"
"1","4","These were certainly easy! My kids wanted to make cookies and we didn't have a lot of time... so we made these. I just sort of fashioned them into flattened circles and let the kids decorate them. Then while we ate lunch I cooked and cooled the first batch and stuck the rest of the dough in the fridge. I rolled them out afterwards, and it went OK -- the dough was easy to roll and cut, but they definitely spread while cooking, so this isn't the recipe for intricate cutouts.   I actually followed the recipe exactly (I never do that!) and was pleased. Tasty, easy to make, easy to work with, easy to clean up after. Not the best cookie ever, but a versatile kid-friendly and easy recipe. :)"
"1","5","These cookies are absolutely amazing!!!! The are not too sweet but they have an classic sugar cookie taste that's just right!! i made this recipe numerous times and i love it and will i will continue to use it in the future!"
"1","5","These cookies are SOOOOOOOOOOOO good! And SO very easy to make. I made these and added some cream cheese icing and sprinkles... They are easily the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted!"
"1","5","They're wonderful! They're soft and sweet, thank you for the recipe!"
"1","5","I made these last week to share with the playgroup kids for Valentine's Day. The only change I made was to add an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla, but I'm still rating it 5 stars, because I think this is more of a personal preference issue. I rolled mine in red sugar sprinkles before baking, and then pressed a cherry juju heart into each of them after they came out of the oven. Everyone, kids and moms, loved them. I got lots of compliments, and the cookies were almost gone by the time playgroup was over. I was happy there were a few left so my 7 year old could have a couple when he got home from school. I'm definitely keeping this recipe, and am making again tonight so I can share them with the preschool kids tomorrow."
"1","5","This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe you will come across on this site. Bottom line. This is my signature cookie recipe and I am known for this one... I also make mine taste the way it does because I add a tablespoon of vanilla...makes all the difference. Thanks Stephanie."
"1","5","I made these fantastic cookies for my office on Valentine's day. I added a little red food dye to the wet ingrediants before adding in the flour, etc. I also added a little more vanilla. I was the hit of the office. Everyone came by my desk to tell me how good the cookies were and to ask when I was going to make them again... Make thses cookies and you'll make a lot of friends, too!"
"1","5","These cookies were so easy to make. Don't over bake them though. Will for sure make these again :)"
"1","4","Good recipe overall, however my dough was very crumbly (perhaps my butter wasn't soft enough?). I tried to make shapes with it, but to no avail  I'll make these again."
"1","1","I probably should of listened to other when they said these spread. I tried to make heart cookies. These are probably only good for circles. How they got Xmas figures in the picture, I don't know. I even cooked them thicker, but they spread more and were crispy cookies. They tasted good, but not the type of cookie I wanted."
"1","5","Mmm, I just made these, and they're delicious! They have a nice crackled top, and are crispy on the outside, nice and soft, but not mealy, in the inside. I will make these again! oh, I added a little more sugar than the recipe called for, and am glad i did, because these cookies are perfect."
"1","5","This was a one of the greatest sugar cookie recipes I have ever used! It came out chewy and soft and tasted great! It took about 20 minutes to prepare and make, but it was worth it!I put fork lines in the middle and, it cooked great! I recommend this recipe 100%!"
"1","4","Easy is right. I have made 2 batches of these so far, both for my sons'preschool Christmas parties. They were quick and easy to fix (I made Christmas trees) and both batches were eaten very quickly!"
"1","5","These cookies ROCK! I baked them EXACTLY according to the recipe, and they were UNBELIEVABLE! :D"
"1","5","This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I have tried. My family is normally really picky but they couldn't get enough of these. I topped them with a vanilla frosting and they were really good."
"1","5","This is the best sugar cookie mix ever! My friend was surprised on how you didn't have to refrigerate it before it was used. On one of my batches, it did help to put it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or so to use my cookie cutters. A big hit!"
"1","5","Very quick and easy! Made these for Halloween."
"1","5","I am a pastry chef always looking for different variations on cookies and this is by far the best. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening(the shortening prevents the cookies from spreading). I used an ice cream scoop, rolled them into a ball and rolled in sugar. Next time, I think I may add some lemon or orange zest. Will probably make this again but roll out and cut into hearts for valentines day and frost. Very Good!"
"1","5","These cookies were very good. My three year old got some cookie cutters for Christmas and she wanted to use them so I had all the ingredients on hand for these. They came out crispy and tasty."
"1","5","This has become my go-to sugar cookie recipe! My husband says it's the best sugar cookie he's ever tasted. I have been intimidated in the past about making sugar cookies, but this recipe put all my fears to rest. The dough is very easy to work with when chilled and I was very happy to find that I was able to roll it out and use cookie cutters with ease!   When I make these into the balls, I roll the dough balls in a bowl of granulated sugar before baking. Delish!  Thanks for a super sugar cookie recipe. I can't wait for Valentine's Day so I can make batches of heart-shaped cookies."
"1","5","Soft, moist, delecatable cookies! This is the perfect base for tweaking the recipe or adding toppings. They taste great the next day too....assuming you have any left."
"1","5","This recipe provided very yummy results!  I used an electric mixer to cut butter and sugar together; rolled dough into balls that I flattened with a glass bottom dipped in color sugar; baked the cookies for 7 minutes and cooled them on the cookie sheet for 1 minute before moving to a wire rack.  My family likes cookies to be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and these were perfect. Still chewy inside after a couple of days.  I'm going to make this recipe again, but this time I'll try rolling the balls in cinnamon-sugar and not flattening them."
"1","5","These cookies are unbelievable! After my last few attempts in which the dough came out too dry, I made the following changes and they came out FANTASTIC: I reduced the flour to 2½ cups (loosley measured; don't pack it), ½ tsp. of baking soda and baking powder. I doubled the vanilla to 2 tsps. for greater depth of taste. I was worried that the cookies wouldn't rise properly with the baking soda and powder reductions, but this was not a problem. They came out beautifully. Leave in for 8 minutes for chewy cookies and 10 if you like them crisper around the edges. I also made some of them with a single marchiano cherry on top (cut in half), in the middle. :-) Delish!"
"1","5","I make these cookies for all occasions and always get tons of complements! They are so simple to make, and there is so much that can be done with them, like adding chocolate kisses on top after taking them out of the oven. To keep them chewy make sure to keep an eye on them and take them out of the oven before they get brown."
"1","5","There really isn't anything that I can suggest to make this recipe any better or easier. My cookies turned out perfect - no complaints here.  The only thing I may have done differently is that I rolled the dough a little thicker because I like my cookies thick and chewy. This recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","Very easy and good! I made 1/2 a recipe to test them out, and mixed everything in my cuisinart, it worked perfectly. My kids loved them straight out of the oven, I will made again."
"1","5","My daughter and I made these. We sprinkled them with everything we thought might be good. Her favorite was the red sugar (it sparkled with a green tint for some reason after baking). Mine was nutmeg, but just a little."
"1","5","Phenomenal recipe!!!! I'm not a big fan of sugar cookies but after trying this recipe they are my new favorite. The cookies are so moist. I baked them for 9 mins and they were perfect. They do a ton of spreading though...I tried making candy cane shapes with this recipe but couldn't pull it off, they came out looking like blobs. LOL So I went with regular ball shapes which worked great. You've gotta try this recipe!"
"1","2","Not a good cut out cookie recipe. I even rolled them into balls like the recipe said and they did not turn out well. Flavor was good."
"1","5","I scaled this recipe to 98..I had to use shortning instead of margarine or butter, also, I had no vanilla! But I tried anyway - the mixture came out extremely dry and I almost gave up. But first I ended up adding 2 more eggs, about one and a half more shortning, and give or take around half c. more of sugar. Rolled in colored sugar, and crossed my fingers...the results were amazing, I can't belive how good they came out. Soft and a little chewy, not falling apart- just right. In fact this might be my new favorite!"
"1","4","I was looking for an easy sugar cookie recipe and this it the right one!! I had one that I has used for years, but this one taste just as good as my old one. I did increase the vanilla like other has said and I think that did the trick. I can say this one is a keeper."
"1","4","These are kind of a cakey cookie, very good but maybe be better with more sugar, next time I'm going to try that. I doubled the vanilla."
"1","5","This recipe was great! I did have to add the 1 egg white for better consistancy. I also rolled the cookies in sugar before I baked them."
"1","5","The easiest cookie that I have baked and the best cookie that we shared with our friends. I highly recommend this recipe....yummy"
"1","4","this cookie is WAY too sweet w/o any salt to cut the sugar-edge. I added 1/4 teaspoon salt to batter."
"1","5","These cookies are soo good. I make them all the time. I wouldn't change a thing."
"1","4","Taste was good on these. We made Moon Pies out of 1/2 and snickerdoodles out of 1/2. Yeah, I've got a pretty big sweet tooth. :) Be REALLY CAREFUL not to overbake because on my first batch, I left them in 9 minutes because they didn't look done to me.. big mistake! They were fine until they cooled about 3 minutes.. then they spread all over the place and got way too crispy. It was weird. Anyway, just take them out at 8 minutes, and trust me, they won't look done. Just do it! They'll be nice and chewy and round that way. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Wow! I made this for the kids in my CCD class and was so happy with the results. They really enjoyed it with icing on the top. I haven't had a better sugar cookie yet."
"1","5","I've been looking for a drop sugar cookie recipe and here it is. I did add 2 tsps of vanilla, because I didn't want them to taste like butter and the dough was a little sticky and that was easily fixed by putting a little sugar on your hands. Tomorrow I'm going to make this recipe and put the dough in the refrigerator overnight and make roll out cookies. I'll let everyone know how they turn out."
"1","1","these did not taste like sugar cookies, tasted weird"
"1","1","I followed this recipe and the dough came out flaky. It made it hard to roll into balls and I didn't even want to try to roll it out to use cookie cutters. They do taste good but the dough was a pain."
"1","5","I JUST MADE MY FIRST BATCH OF THESE AND THEY ARE TERRIFIC. QUICK AND EASY FOR ME AND THE KIDS. I DID ADD AN EXTRA TEASPOON OF VANILLA. PUTTING THEM IN THE FRIDGE FOR A LITTLE WHILE HELPED ME WITH THE SECOND BATCH, MADE IT EASIER TO WORK WITH. I WILL DEFINETELY PUT THIS IN MY RECIPE BOOK. AWESOME FLAVOR!!!!!!! (by the way this is Charles' wife, not Charles. Had to clarify for his benefit. LOL) Merry Christmas, ooohh there's the buzzer! Yeah cookies"
"1","3","Not good for rolling out for Christmas cookies, spreads waaaay too much. Mine flattened and sank when i took them out of the oven. Will not use again."
"1","4","This great recipe for sugar cookies that you don't cut out. They taste great with a cup of hot tea. They don't work for thumbprint cookies though, because they rise and spread out."
"1","5","WOW! Worked out great for Christmas cookies. These are great! Use lots of flour on the surface on which you are working to keep it from sticking. I also cooled it over night before baking."
"1","5","I made these cookies last night and they were fantastic. The dough was easy to work with and the cookies were a big hit. I sprinkled white sugar over the top. I ate some dough, which tasted great! I did add some almond extract and doubled the vanilla. I think the addition of grated lemon peel would be fantastic."
"1","2","I decided to experiment with different sugar cookie recipes this year. I didn't like this one at all. The cookies puffed up a bunch and then flattened out, so they completely lost their shape. They're also not as soft as my sugar cookies usually are. I'll stick with my old recipe..."
"1","3","This cookie dough tasted like flour! It was alright after adding icing..."
"1","5","these were so easy to make plus taste so good. i will definitly make them alot."
"1","5","Quick and easy! I have a 4 year old so we had fun coloring sugar and sprinkling it on top. FYI mixed colored sugar melts to look tye dye like. He liked it!"
"1","5","awesome recipee...very nice texture and easy to work with. Beware you do not add too much flour when rolling it out, dough will become tough to work with."
"1","5","Super easy and tastes great. 10 mins."
"1","4","Very good, Very easy! I agree with another reviewer - add a bit more vanilla. Great cookies!!! Take out at 8 minutes."
"1","5","For a person who's always in a hurry or simply isn't a chef...this one's perfect!"
"1","5","Easy, delicious, and turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great! I chilled the dough and cut them into shapes, and decorated them with almond flavored frosting. Just what I was looking for!!!"
"1","5","These cookies were absolutely what I was looking for. Just the right texture & taste. The outside edges were crispy, while the middle was soft & warm. I do recommend putting the dough in the refridgerator for about 5-10 minutes before you handle the dough. I also had to change the cooking time. It took me 10-12 minutes to cook mine. Overall, these cookies were exactly what I was looking for! :)"
"1","4","These were definitely easy and very tasty but not 'knock my socks off' good. I tried rolling the balls in tiny sprinkles but when they baked, they spread unevenly and I ended up with sprinkles on only one side of the cookie. I'll probably try out a different sugar cookie recipe next time just out of curiosity."
"1","5","Thanks you all recipes! You saved our christmas! yummy yum yum"
"1","5","I make this recipe for all of my friends and i get so many praises on it! Best recipe ever. Also it is very easy to make and it takes no time at all. Best id you add sugar on top after they come out of the oven."
"1","5","Wonderfully awesome sugar cookies. My family loved them...they are so much better than the buy and cut kind! The little bit of work is really worth it."
"1","5","My husband made these today, they were great, light & crispy. Wonderful with light frosting and some candy sprinkles!"
"1","5","this reciep was reay good. I used in cookie molds. Taste is tender and and is very good . will make again.thank you for sharing"
"1","5","I'll never make another sugar cookie again!! I let them back for 7 minutes. I only made a half a batch and now I wish that i made a full one!! Look no further, this is it!"
"1","5","These cookies are the best!! They only took like 5 min prep time. My family loved them!! I will definately be using this recipe again and again."
"1","5","Easy. Very tasty. Truly easy to roll with your hands with no sticking. I let bake several minutes to flatten before sprinkling then returned to oven."
"1","5","I made these tonight. They are so good. This is the first time I have successfully been able to make sugar cookies. The only thing I added was a little pumpkin pie spice since I'm giving these as a Thanksgiving present. Thanks so much for the recipe!!"
"1","3","These were decent cookies but really floury. It came out okay but not great. My roommate and I ate them but I wouldn't make it for anyone else."
"1","4","These were definitely easy, that's for sure. But they were good, not the best tasting. I would only make them again if I were in a hurry to take cookies somewhere."
"1","4","Really nice cookies,they only take 6 minutes in my fan oven and be warned-they spread out to almost wafer thin-ness."
"1","5","These were very simple to make and turned out wonderful! They were a bit sticky to cut out, but I had my 7 year old helping me. So if you're a bit faster than her, you should be fine! These tasted so good they didn't last a weekend! TRY THEM!"
"1","5","they are so good"
"1","5","taste amazing! i followed the directions exactly and they were perfect. i made icing as well. :)"
"1","5","I made these cookies tonight and my husband comented they were the best I've made so far - not too sweet and not too hard or soft. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","Delicious!! I love to bake this time of year and every time I try a sugar cookie recipe.. it's not very good. I gave this one a try and not only was it simple to make, but it was very very good. Buttery tasting with a touch of sweetness.. crisp on outside and chewy on inside! So glad I found this. Will be using this recipe for this holiday baking!"
"1","5","Easy and tasty! I added a bit more vanilla than the recipe called for and they came out great at 375 for 10 minutes. I tried leaving them in for 8 minutes, as suggested by some reviewers, and they were still doughy in the middle. Just make sure you keep an eye on them is all I can really offer! ***UPDATE*** Decided to make these again and they came out great. Prior to baking I rolled mine in a combo of 2 tbsp. sugar to 1 tsp. cinnamon and they came out awesome. Definitely a keeper recipe now."
"1","5","omg! these are by far the greatest cookies I have ever tasted. Yum! I didn't follow the recipe exactly (didn't mix butter/sugar and flour in two seperate bowls...oops) but they still turned out great. :) and with such common ingredients too. I covered mine with rainbow sprinkles to add a little color to the cookie. Ellos son muy delicioso. What can I say? You MUST try these cookies."
"1","5","Perfect soft sugar cookie.... the dough seems a tiny bit sticky when first making the balls.... but they come out perfectly. I rolled mine in colored sugar!"
"1","5","Came out great! I do have to add, how the H-E- double L do cookies come out purple without adding food coloring?! Must have not been a very good cook is what I am guessing!"
"1","5","Awesome! I substituted with Gluten-Free All Purpose Flour and they were delicious. Made a much better gluten-free/wheat-free cookie than what is sold in stores. 8 minutes baking was perfect."
"1","5","Wowie, wow, wow!!! These are great. The only thing that I did different was to add 1/2 t salt as I like the sweety/salty thing in cookies. If you like chewy sugar cookies, this is a great recipe. Just to let you know, mine did not brown but, they are so yummy!!!"
"1","5","Best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tasted. I do add a little extra vanilla and roll my cookies in colored sugar. Recipe seems a little dry but if you mix well everything turns out just fine."
"1","4","graet cookies there are soft and easy to make my whole family love them great thanks....."
"1","5","Perfect, everything you could ever want in a sugar cookie. And so, so easy! I wouldn't change a thing."
"1","5","This is absolutely the best sugar cookie I have ever had. I put royal icing on top, and they are to die for!!"
"1","5","Fabulous recipe. I bake for 9 minutes, and they are soft and wonderful. I usually add sprinkles, or roll in cinnamon sugar to make snickerdoodles."
"1","4","These cookies are very simple to make and I thought that it was going to be a great recipe simply because I always have the ingredients on hand. My fiance isn't a big fan of sugar cookies because they're 'too plain' but I gave them a try. My 2 1/2 year old son helped me make them...and he really enjoyed eating them! I made the first 12 without adding anything...they were pretty good but too plain for us. So the rest of the cookies got sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar....they taste exactly like snickerdoodles! This is definitely a good recipe to keep. I gave 4 stars because I think that the recipe is too plain 'as is'."
"1","5","Fantastic recipe! It was super easy and the resulting dough was delicious. I used these on a 'Cookie Crust Cobbler' and can't wait to make cookies from it!"
"1","5","They were great cookies.  I took out some flour, though.  They were still good!  Thankies. ^^"
"1","5","These cookies are fabulous. The cookies were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I added a half of a teaspoon of lemon extract to the recipe. I scooped the cookies out with a tablespoon scoop. I didn't roll them into a ball. I baked them on a stone. The cookies stayed nice and puffy even after cooling. I froze half the batch in the shape of the scoop to bake later. I LOVE these cookies."
"1","5","Delicious drop sugar cookies! Very easy to make. I baked for 8 to 9 minutes and they are chewy-soft. I prefer them plain but I also made some buttercream icing and iced some of them for people with more of a sweet tooth. They got rave reviews."
"1","5","I had a hard time beleiving the other reviews because this recipe looked too easy to have good results. However I was wrong. My kids (3&8) made this almost all by themselves and they came out great. The only thing we did differently was added 1 tsp of almond extract with the vanilla. We also used sprinkes on top. Will make again."
"1","5","I followed some other's suggestions and added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and a pinch of salt. I rolled the dough balls and flattened them slightly on a small pile of sugar, which I then flipped over to have a nice, crispy, sweet top! I made little criss-crosses in the top with a fork. I took them out after exactly 8 minutes, and they were absolutely wonderful! I love how easy AND inexpensive this recipe is. Try them!"
"1","4","I like the taste very much. I have no idea why though, but the dough came out incredibly dry?  Still good recipe -- I'll definitely try this again."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! It was easy and tasted very good. We made two batches, one with vanilla extract and one with butter nut extract."
"1","5","This is an awesome recipe! Thank you!"
"1","5","Definitely quick and easy, may need a little more sugar when you make less than the original recipe calls for, but it was a pleasure to be able to make a batch and have them ready for a school party in a half hour late the nite before. Thanks bunches!!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe! My family likes them with colorful sprinkles on top or just plain. A great after school snack! Thanks!"
"1","5","i usually don't make sugar cookies b/ci can never seem to find the best recipe but this is by far the best sugar cookie i have ever had!i rolled them in sugar before i put them in the oven and it was the perfect touch! didn't let them brown b/c they wouldn't have stayed soft. take them out at exactly 8-10 minutes depending on ur oven even if they still look kinda of white and not all the way done!...trust me :-)"
"1","5","I LOVE THESE SUGAR COOKIES!!!! they are soooo soft and chewy and EASY to make!!!! Thanks for the recipie!!!!!"
"1","4","This is the first sugar cookie recipe I've found that I actually like. As per other reviews, they are perfect--sweet & buttery but not overly rich, crisp around the edges & chewy in the middle. Yum.  My only complaint is that they tasted a bit eggy for my liking, but I added the zest of a couple of limes after baking the first pan & they're absolutely gorgeous. No doubt lemon zest would work equally well, but I love the combination of lime and vanilla.  Also, the cookie dough can come up a bit sticky, but there's no need to chill the dough before rolling it into balls. Just put a couple tablespoons of flour into a deep plate and dip your fingertips (dusting off the excess) before shaping the dough. It only takes a tiny bit of flour to stop the dough sticking to your hands, and I find that this works like a charm.  Oh, and I rolled the balls of dough in vanilla demerara sugar to give them a bit of crunch. Perfect."
"1","5","These are great! I used a cookie scoop to get uniform cookies. As soon as they came out of the oven, I sprinkled them with white sugar. The sugar sticks which is great. My kids really like them! Thanks!"
"1","4","An hour ago, I decided I wanted to learn to bake cookies - I'm glad this is the recipe I went with!! My first batch failed because I decided not to follow the recipe exactly... WAY too much baking soda! Second time, I followed it exactly, and they've come out great! A little bland, but I'm sure that's something I can work at once I learn to cook a bit better!"
"1","5","I am a daycare provider and I often find that pre-made dough is just too expensive for the number of kids I have and I found this single recipe not only makes more than enough cookies without doubling, it is quick enough to where I can prepare it and bake all the cookies when the kids are napping, and they have fresh baked cookies when they get up, they're that quick!"
"1","5","It's amazing that such a simple recipe can yield the best sugar cookies ever! Wonderful!"
"1","4","given the amount of time that it took to make these, they were absolutely amazing. i only had whole wheat flour on hand, so i didn't feel as terrible about eating them so fast!"
"1","4","I just made these. Fantastic! And really easy, i whipped them up in a half hour flat. I did however, make the balls a little too big, so make sure to really downsize, because they spread  alot."
"1","5","Great recipe and so versatile too... Instead of vanilla extract I used almond extract and added 1 1/2 T of poppy seeds just to try something a little different. Compliments iced tea and fruit really well. Also after reading the reviews, I adjusted the recipe by reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup, reducing the baking soda by 1/4 tsp and adding a 1/2 tsp of salt. (I used unsalted butter.) The cookies did spread some while baking, but I had 12 on a 15.5x20 insulated cookie sheet and they didn't touch. Will definitely make again."
"1","5","This recipe is really good, but I can taste and/or smell the baking soda. Maybe it's just the baking soda that I use, but I'm not sure. Anyhow, still really good. Thanks!"
"1","5","These cookies are the perfect sugar cookie. The taste is just sweet enough with a wonderful creaminess. As far as texture, mine turned with just the right chewiness and crumbliness!"
"1","5","Wow! The easiness and taste of these cookies are unbelievable! Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I made them for a friend's birthday, and she loved them! Thanks!"
"1","5","Love these cookies! Made these for guests and they truly were devoured by young and old alike! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Fabulous cookie! I have never had these not turn out and I've used the recipe a lot! They're also very good if you roll the balls in sugar and cinnamon before baking."
"1","4","Take them out early or they will be crunchy...perfect for dunking in milk, but they're best when still light colored and soft!"
"1","5","The best sugar cookies ever!!! Soft and chewy!"
"1","4","This is a great recipe! So easy!! one of the easiest i've used.. I do recommend chilling the dough before rolling into balls.. Much easier to mess with.. Also I agree with the other poster who said cook for 8 minutes or you'll end up with crispy cookies!! 8 minutes was perfection!"
"1","5","WOW. these cookies are amazing. my whole family LOVES them! i added a little bit of vegetable oil into the mixture to make it stick together better. and i also found that putting white chocolate chips in them makes them taste EVEN BETTER! but beware: if ur out of sugar, go out and buy some. do not put splenda or any other artificial sweetner into it. it tastes very bad (as i figured out) take my advice and make these cookies! you're sure to love them!!!!"
"1","5","Oh so good! Only thing added to recipe was a dash of salt. These are going to be a favorite of mine!"
"1","5","Perfect!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious! My family and I really enjoyed these. I'm not the best baker (hey, I'm learning!) but these cookies were super simple, even for me. Will make again!"
"1","5","VERY easy recipe & delicious too! Didn't get 'golden brown' unless left in for over 12 minutes (which makes for a hard, crispy cookie) but taking them out around 9.5 minutes seemed perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again!"
"1","3","I added a little more flour and then rolled out between 2 pieces of parchment paper and was able to cut shapes immediately without refridgerating. Unfortunately, these cookies have a funny after taste. Is it baking soda? Also,would adding a pinch of salt bring out the sweet taste?"
"1","4","I followed the recipe as written. The dough came together nicely and was easy to make, but my 5 taste-testers and I found them to be fairly bland. We ended up putting frosting on them, which improved them, but I'm going to keep looking for a sugar cookie recipe."
"1","4","The dough was very dry but I managed to squeeze it together into golf sized balls and they cooked up real nice. Delicious!"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious! I ran out of white flour, so I used 1 1/4 c wheat flour and 1 1/2 c white flour. It really gave the cookies an interesting texture and flavor. I also substituted 1/3 of the butter with applesauce which also added sweetness and made the cookies very soft. Thanks!"
"1","5","A big hit at my house! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","These are really great. Basic, simple, no roll cookies with ingredients already on hand. I always roll the balls in sugar before baking which to me makes a huge difference. Doesn't get much easier!"
"1","5","I've tried many sugar cookie recipes, but this was by far the easiest and best. Thanks!!!!!"
"1","5","These are the best ever! I have had to pass along this recipe to others. I made it for my xmas exchange, and they got rave reviews. They freeze very well. They're nice and chewy which is the way I like my sugar cookies. Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","MMMMM these were sooo good! I went to a Fondue party, and we used these to dunk in the chocolate fondue pot. Everybody raved about how good they were! Thanx for sharing!!"
"1","5","This recipe was awesome! Everyone loved the cookies, they were really good. I flattened them slightly with a sugar coeated fork, then added some holiday sprinkles. I will use this recipe again and again in the future. My husband couldn't stop eating them!  It's so nice having a holiday sugar cookie you don't need to roll out and cut."
"1","5","These were excellent... so soft. I ended up using Blue Bonnet Margarine Sticks... and added some Powdered Buttermilk Culture, and they came out awesome!"
"1","5","Great, easy sugar cookie recipe with simple ingredients! I used this recipe to make my festive cookies this past Christmas with the 'sugar cookie frosting' recipe."
"1","5","These were amazing! They tasted absolutely amazing when they came out of the oven, and even a couple days later. This is the best recipe ever."
"1","1","too buttery and impossible to manage."
"1","5","i loved these cookies! first time i didn't mess up on baking :)"
"1","4","These were great cookies! The only problem was when I made them on sunday they spread well and were crisp and chewy at the same time. But when I made them on monday they didn't spread, they were tiny and chewy; still delicious but not crisp like I like them. I think I should have added abit more liquid, the dough seemed drier on monday so maybe thats why they didnt spread."
"1","5","VERY EASY AND VERY GOOD THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVED THEM."
"1","5","I fixed several dozen of these cookies and the whole family just raved about how good they are! You've got to try them! Simple and easy!"
"1","5","Really easy and tasty! My three yr old loved helping with this one. We put rainbow sprinkles on the cookies before we put them in the oven and we pressed them down a bit before we put the sprinkles on them. Very fun!!"
"1","5","Truly easy and great to make when you are in a bind and have to go to a cookie exchange! All the ingredients will be in your pantry."
"1","5","This is the best and easiest sugar cookie recipe! Look no further for the perfect sugar cookie recipe. I rolled my dough into balls and then pressed with the floured bottom of a glass. Then I decorated with red sugar for the holidays."
"1","5","Wonderful cookie. My grandson loves these, thanks for the recipe."
"1","2","these are too crispy for me...my children also prefer thick, soft and sweet sugar cookies; these are not."
"1","5","Good tasting recipe. Easy. And it's hard to keep my husband out of them, I'm not going to have any left for our Christmas party!!! LOL"
"1","5","Great tasting and easy to make. I sprinkled some colored sugar on top and they were a big hit with everybody.."
"1","5","so easy and so good. can't say enough on how good these are. impress your kids with homemade cookies when they get off the school bus."
"1","3","Very good recipe - but not the best I've ever had! Had to add an extra egg as they were too crumbly. Rolled in red/green sugar for holidays - but tasted a little too much flour and not enough sugar!! Thanks!"
"1","3","Maybe I read all those great reviews and thought it was going to be easy. I wanted a recipe that I didn't have to chill for hours, but I had to refrigerate these. The last batch, I rolled in cin-sugar and they were fine. Just not what I want right now. I have ALOT of cookies to bake. Not these though"
"1","1","This was the second time I've tried to make these. I was so careful to follow the direction EXACTLY this time around. I don't know what happened-both times they rose too much and weren't at all soft."
"1","5","My family has never been a big sugar cookie fan, but they LOVE these cookies. I get requests by everyone to make them. I usually put a buttercream icing on them, and they go perfect together! Definitely a keeper, I've had a bunch of people ask for the recipe! Apparently, they're the best sugar cookie ever!!"
"1","5","Great cookies! Nice and chewy. Dough seemed dry, but held together fine when I rolled it into balls. I rolled the balls in sugar before baking. I tried pressing M&Ms into the cookies right when they came out of the oven, but they ended up falling off when we tried to eat them! Oh well. Cookies still tasted great!"
"1","5","This was so easy to make and tasted like I bought them from a bakery!"
"1","5","Super easy, cookies are beautiful and delicious!"
"1","4","add sugar to the tops of the cookies at the last minute in the oven....and make sure you take them off the sheet asap otherwise you get some crunchy cookies!"
"1","5","These cookies are amazing! The dough is a bit crumbly, but that didn't matter...my roommate and I heartily give them two thumbs up!"
"1","4","I added a second egg to the recipe and rolled the doughy batter into teaspoon-size balls, then rolled the balls in a sugar & cinnamon mixture. I baked them for 9 minutes, and they were amazing! Just chewy enough to be perfect -- melt in your mouth! I served them at a Bible study and had several women ask me for the recipe, even my mother-in-law (who's a great cook!). I was proud. Thanks for the recipe, and thanks for the tips from the other reviewers."
"1","5","I must have made these cookies hundreds of times. First of all you have to use real butter--that is the only way that the true flavor comes out. Also I halve the recipe because I can't eat an entire batch. Also I replaced half of the sugar with brown sugar and they turn out great too. Very nice recipe and always a winner. Thanks"
"1","5","THANK YOU! These are just what I was hoping they would be and SO GOOD! I followed the recipie exactly except I made 1/2 a batch but still used 1 whole egg."
"1","5","This is a very good little cookie! They are very uniform in shape and have a great taste and texture. They are a flat cookie but are moist if you don't over cook them. I tried rolling them in sugar and I also baked them plain. Both ways were good. The sugared ones were a bit more crisp, and my husband prefered the slightly softer original version. Thanks Stephanie for sharing this super recipe!!!"
"1","5","These are great! I rolled some of them in raw sugar & some in cinnamon sugar. They are really easy to make and taste wonderful! I can't wait to bake them for the local dessert contest in September!"
"1","5","These are so good! They are moist and the best sugar cookies I've ever had! And so easy to make also!"
"1","5","I have had to stop making these cookies. If I don't stop, my husband will soon weigh 300 lbs. These are the best cookies, and his favorite."
"1","5","Awesome, awesome, awesome!"
"1","5","A winner... beautiful and delicious. Thank you."
"1","5","Great recipe!!! It made about two dozen huge cookies and they were easy, delicious, and great!!!! Thanks Stephanie!!!!"
"1","5","I used 2 eggs and these cookies were perfection!"
"1","5","Yummy!"
"1","5","These were deelish - I added 1 t salt and 1 t lemon extract, rolled in sugar (as recommended) and then pressed flat with the heel of my hand. Kids devoured them. Thanks!"
"1","4","Turned out rather hard. Gave it four stars for the nice flavor. Maybe next time I'll flatten the balls of dough & shorten the cook time."
"1","5","Rave reviews from the little ones. This recipe was very easy, and very tasty! I would recommend making small cookies, and rolling them in sugar before baking. I will definitely use this one again."
"1","5","I tried this recipe tonight and we loved them. I made some plain, added some finely chopped pecans to some, and sprinkled some with sugar and some with a sugar and cinnamon mixture. They were all great, I will be making these cookies again and again. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe."
"1","5","Delicious! We made these for my daughter to sell at our garage sale, and I think we ate as many as we sold! My daughter has proclaimed them as her favorites--One change is I rolled the balls in sugar before putting on the cookie sheet."
"1","5","these were really fantastic, simple cookies. i had to bat everyone away from them so i'd have enough to take to work. dough freezes nicely as well so you can save it for later. definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","If you like soft, chewy cookies, these are AMAZING! I've made this recipe a few times always with rave reviews. I occassionally add some M&M's to the mix. Delicious!"
"1","5","awsome cookies :) Though I replaced 1 1/2 cups of flour with whole wheat flour and added an extra egg....They stayed moist for almost one week....If they had lasted a week I bet they still would have been moist.!!! Love them"
"1","3","Not sure exacty what happened , hubby helped so maybe something got forgotten in the recipe but they came out as very tasty puffed dough balls. lol, will try again."
"1","4","These were delicious cookies. However, the dough for the cookies were very crumbly and hard to form. Also, they take WAYYYYY more time to bake!"
"1","5","Quick, Easy, and delicious!"
"1","5","These were very tasty cookies. I wanted to make Easter shapes so I rolled out and used cookie cutters. Still works!"
"1","1","I was not happy with how dry my cookies turned out. They were crumbling when I took them out. Plus they did not flatten out like I expected them too. I may have done something wrong, but I cannot figure out what."
"1","4","Overall, these were great cookies. After the first day, they were way too crunchy for my family. They were awesome fresh out of the oven, chewy and just perfect with a glass of milk. However, the following days they were more like eating sweetened bricks. Thus, the 4 stars."
"1","5","The dough is a little sticky-but don't add too much flour! When you make it right---MMMMMMMMM so good!"
"1","4","These really are INCREDIBLY easy. I wish I had taken the other suggestions of rolling them in sugar, but I like my cookies to be softer. I think I'll try that next time and see how I do!"
"1","5","These cookies were very quick, easy and delicious! My only suggestion would be to roll them in sugar before placing them on a cookie sheet. Otherwise they are awesome!"
"1","3","An okay cookie; however, it was a bit crunchy for my taste. I tried to make bigger cookies, which was probably not a good idea as the edge was cooked long before the rest of the cookie. If I made them again, I would probably make cut-out cookies."
"1","5","PERFECT! Crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside..yum! Keep an eye on them as they bake..mine took about 12 minutes to bake up soft. I used margarine instead of butter (always do) and they still tasted great. I'll have to try them with some icing next time! Thank you for this wonderful recipe :-)"
"1","5","These came out soft and chewy. I highly recommend this recipe!"
"1","4","These are good. We made these for Valentines day and iced them with Cream Cheese frosting. I think adding some nutmeg to the recipe would be a nice touch and make them more flavorful."
"1","5","I was searching for a delicious sugar cookie recipe for cut outs and hadn't found it until this recipe. Great, great flavor. The only thing I would do is try to cook a few minutes less to make less crunchy."
"1","5","This recipe is excellent for cookie press cookies. Work quikly on a dry day. I add a little salt if I use unsalted butter."
"1","5","This is the perfect sugar cookie recipe. Shake some sparkle sugar on top as they are cooling and youare back in the 50's!"
"1","5","All I can say is YUM! I'm so skeptical about sugar cookies, but I was craving some sweets and I didn't have any chocolate chips. These went way beyond my expectations, and I'm going to give the recipe to my mom. They were excellent!"
"1","4","These taste great! They taste like sugar cookies should (alot of other recipes for them taste too much like shortening bread). The only thing that would make them a little better would be if they were a little less crumbly."
"1","5","This was a very easy resipe.. The cookies were great and chewy. This is the best sugar cookie i have ever tasted"
"1","5","so so yummy, unfortuneately. i couldn't stop eating these. in fact, i don't think i've ever eaten more cookies in one day than with these. very simple."
"1","5","This is my new, favorite sugar cookie recipe. They were a huge hit at Christmas."
"1","5","excellent recipe, thank you. i made them at christmas along with some pink and green icing for the top and half a marashino cherry for each cookie!"
"1","5","Have made these several times now and they always come out great."
"1","3","I made these cookies for our traditional holiday cookies with cookie cutters and colored icing. They were only ok...we were expecting much better after reading all the reviews....My family and I don't get the fascination. Will go back to my old recipe."
"1","5","The recipie never specified unsalted butter but after years of cooking I should have known. The recipie was very simple. Not dealing with the issue of salt, I would definitely have to say they were great. I just can't wait until they are finished so I can remake it the right way!"
"1","5","Didn't have baking soda, so I substituted baking powder for it, but they were still perfect!"
"1","3","I followed recipe with no substitutions. I was expecting a spectacular cookie, but these were just ok. A little bland - needs some salt, maybe? Not bad, but I think I will try a different recipe next time."
"1","5","These are out of this world and are the best sugar cookies I ever had and tastes like mine and they are the best.  These deserve 5 Stars *****"
"1","3","Great flavor, but I had to cook them nearly 15 minutes before they even resembled cookies and not balls of dough. After 8 minutes the bottoms were still not done. After 10 minutes I fig'd I'd take them out anyway like another reviewer suggested. I definitely should've checked the bottom before I took them out of the oven, but I didn't want them to be hard inside and out. Just mess with the time, folks, and they could be 5-stars."
"1","5","Great and very easy!"
"1","5","These are so good and very easy, too. Thanks!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe. These cookies were easy and wonderful."
"1","3","I thought the flavor of this recipe was good (somewhat like shortbread) but I agree with some of the others that the cookies were very dry. I was hoping for soft cookies. I am also at a high altitude so I know that makes a difference too since I had to cook them longer for the cookies to actually leave their tight ball shape (about 14 minutes for me). They were good, but definately did not end up soft for me and I normally have no problem making my cookies end up soft when I am baking."
"1","5","These are the best. Play with the cooking time a bit. I am not a chef and these fool everyone everytime."
"1","5","These were so easy to make! And they turned out absolutely delicious. I have never been able to make homemade cookies and get them to turn out, but this one worked! Thanks!!"
"1","5","These cookies are super easy! I liked that they were made with butter and not Crisco (partially hydrogenated oil). My cookies turned out nice and chewy at 8 minutes. The dough does appear crumbly but if you mash it in your hand before rolling into balls it goes together well. We used 'Sugar Cookie Frosting' from this site to ice them with."
"1","5","This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I've come across. The key to keeping them soft and not crumbly is the cooking time. The cookies do not need to be even lightly brown when you pull them out, check the bottoms only. If pulled early enough they stay moist and soft!"
"1","5","I added crushed peppermint stick to it also and it was wonderful!"
"1","5","great cookies! dont cook them too much and they stay soft. decorate them however you want! very fun, and easy for the kids to help, the best part..."
"1","5","I love this recipe. It is quick and easy. I did change the vanilla extract to almond extract and liked it better. A fun thing to do is to roll up them up and dip them in sprinkes before baking!"
"1","3","I don't know what I did wrong but my cookie dough was dry dry dry and very crumbly which lead to dry and not so great cookies. I added a teaspoon of water and then milk and still they were pretty bad. They looked NOTHING like the picture, even when i pressed them with a fork."
"1","4","these were okay, my family liked them but they tasted just like fork cookies.. maybe theyre the same thing.. but i added milk to the batter because it was really dry and crumbly, and it got really sticky.. then i squished them down like forks and they turned out okay.. i prolly cooked them for too long but they tasted fine, a little bland tho.."
"1","5","best sugar cookies ever....i did tweak the recipe a lil by adding equal parts of whipped butter and shortening...came out with that super moist middle."
"1","5","Excellent Cookies! I liked the fact that I didn't have to roll these out and press into shapes. I did however flaten them down a bit with a fork and top with sugar and sprinkles. A family favorite that is definately easy to make!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! Very moist and buttery cookie. I added M&M's to the tops of the cookies before I baked them and they were great. They tasted like a sugar butter cookie that you would buy at a cookie shop at the malls."
"1","3","good cookies, only thing like many others said, you have to make them thinner and more spread out while you are puting them on the cookie sheet, first batch done as balls came out burnt on the bottom and unfinished on the top."
"1","5","Fool-proof recipie for the best sugar cookies I have ever made.  The first time I made these cookies they came out perfect. The second time I messed up and switched the measurments for baking soda and powder.. still came out OK, but were not flat like the first.  Great, easy to follow recipie."
"1","5","I really loved these. I rolled half of the cookies in sugar, left the others plain and slightly flattened the balls before baking. My husband wanted traditional sugar cookies (not rolled) so I made this recipe for him. He ate the entire batch!! (with the exception of the few I ate) I have already passed on the recipe to my mother. I will make this again and again."
"1","5","They were great! And so easy that my children could make them. I will definatly keep this recipe for future use. I had everyone wanting a copy!"
"1","5","Killer cookie recipe... I zested a lemon into the mixture and it gave them a great 'frosty-lemon' flavor... Definately will use again."
"1","5","These cookies are the best! I made a batch of these cookies for a group of friends and before I could even get the second cookie sheet into the oven the group had finished off the first. They said they were the best cookies they ever had!"
"1","5","Sugar cookies are usually a little plain for me, but these are YUMMY! I made them last night and they were super easy. I put frosting on half (since I expected them to be a little plain) but I think they are better without frosting. I also like the recipe becuase since you roll them into little balls, they are easy to freeze and make later as well! I followed the recipe exactly, but flattened them a little before putting them in the oven."
"1","5","This recipe is AWESOME! It is so quick and easy. I am always looking for easy recipes that my 3 year old can help me make. We have such a good time making these. Thank you so much for the great recipe."
"1","5","Really good, I made them plain, then I made them with a hersheys kiss (or three) on top, then I made them with pecans (terrific), then I added brown sugar with the white (really good)--anyway, the best sugar cookie--I also made a really huge one--I still couldn't ruin this cookie--it came out awesome."
"1","5","These were the easiest and the best home made sugar I've ever had. My husband felt like cookies last nite, found the recipe and within an hour we were eating cookies. Great taste and stayed soft even without wrapping them in plastic wrap. I sprinkled alittle colored sugar and cinnamon on top of the dough before I baked them. Will be making these again very soon. :)"
"1","5","This recipe is exactly what is says...Easy Sugar Cookies! These are the best sugar cookies that I have ever made! My husband and kids absolutely love them. I started out making one batch, and ended up making two because the first batch went so fast!!! This one is definitely a KEEPER!!! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!!!"
"1","5","I rolled half of the cookies in a mixture of 1 tbsp. sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon and made snickerdoodles. I followed the recipe for the rest of the cookies and they were very good and flavorful."
"1","5","This was definitely one of the best recipes I've come across, exactly like you buy at the bakery. Do not over cook. They will look like they are undercooked when they come out of the oven, but they are in fact done. I use this recipe for Halloween, Christmas and tailor the appearance to match the theme. Thanks!"
"1","5","Great, easy, simple sugar cookie. Nice flavor. A snap to mix up and bake. They look as good as they taste. Will be making these often."
"1","5","These cookies were perfect! I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, and after baking I brushed the cookies with milk and spinkled them with colored sugar. Everyone loved them!! Also, I didn't realize it but I used 2 cookie sheets instead of 1...the bottoms came out perfect - never too dark."
"1","4","I made these sugar-free, with splenda, for a friend that can't eat Carbs. He RAVED over them! Now I make them all the time with splenda.  This recipe is great, and easy too. I make them into drop cookies and they always turn out great."
"1","5","Great cookie :) I used half margarine half butter and they turned out great. Very soft in the middle without being doughy, and just a little crispy around the edges when I baked for nine minutes. If I'm craving a soft sugar cookie, this will be the one. Hasn't replaced the Blue Ribbon Sugar Cookie recipe for flavor, but still a great one. Thanks!"
"1","5","I couldn't stop eating these..that's my only complaint:) Very yummy..."
"1","5","EXCELLENT cookies and so easy...no rolling and cutting (although you could if you needed to). I added 1/4 tsp salt like a reviewer recommended. I used a small cookie scooper that has a lever to drop the dough onto the cookie sheet so my cookies were perfectly round. I bake them the full 10 minutes...8 minutes made them too doughy (depends on your altitude) After they cooled my daughter decorated them for Christmas give-aways. We made six batches of these delicious cookies!"
"1","5","These were so simple to make and the plate cleared in minutes!"
"1","3","I used this recipe to make cut-out Christmas cookies. I found that the dough wasn't sticking together very well so I added an extra egg and that worked. But I found the taste to be very bland. I have made better tasting sugar cookies before."
"1","5","This recipe is perfect- easy, foolproof, and delicious! Slightly crispy on the outside but yumyumYUM chewy on the inside. Make sure you refrigerate the dough first because it is very sticky!! I Replaced 1/2c of white sugar w/ confectioner's sugar as suggested. I wanted to make a colorful plate of assorted sugar cookies, so I doubled the recipe and set up 6 different plates w/ different sugars to roll the cookies in prior to baking: red sugar, blue sugar, cinnamon sugar, brown sugar, white sugar, and chopped nuts... baked about a third of them without any sugar and decorated those with melted white and milk chocolate. This was the best looking (and tasting) tray of sugar cookies that I've ever seen!"
"1","5","This recipe is absolutely amazing!!!! Every christmas I make sugar cookies with crushed candy canes on top and the original recipe called for the premade frozen sugar cookie dough. I have been searching for a sugar cookie recipe that I can make from scratch to use instead. The problem is that most sugar cookie repices i have found are incredibly difficult or time consuming, so its easire to just use the premade dough. This recipe is super easy to make and tastes much better than the generic premade dough.  If you are interested in the candy cane cookies, simply crush the candy canes (I use a hammer and a plastic bag) and sprinkle them on top of sugar cookie dough before baking. They are a real winner at holiday parties!!!!"
"1","5","These cookies are fantastic and so easy to make. Everyone has these ingredients on hand. I put some premium vanilla ice cream in between two of the cookies to make an ice-cream sandwich - and it was to die for!"
"1","4","I was very impressed by the nice texture of these cookies (had to bake them a bit more than the given time) but I give it 4 stars because I believe the recipe uses way too much sugar...  I will definitely make these again lowering the dosage..."
"1","5","Great, easy recipe. I roll the dough into small balls. I then take a drinking glass, dip the bottom of the glass into granulated sugar to keep the dough from sticking, and press the dough balls out into very thin perfectly round shapes. They cook quickly and are a great almost Moravian-style cookie. My friends love the crispiness. You can use colored sugar with the glass for a seasonal color accent."
"1","5","This recipe was soooo easy and tasted great. The cookies came out crispy on the out side and warm and chewy on the inside.I rolled them in sugar before I baked them.But the only thing you NEED to do with them is eat them with a glass of milk.I will so make this recipe again."
"1","5","I have always had trouble making decent cookies, so when these came out perfect I was THRILLED!!! I'm sure these will disappear quickly. They were so easy and I'm especially happy that I didn't have to roll them out or chill them or anything. Thanks so much Stephanie =)"
"1","5","My kids love these cookies and my son wants to take them as a snack in his lunch all the time. They really are easy to make, and the baking time was right on. (Unlike other recipes I've found where the time's off by several minutes!)"
"1","5","I made these just as directed, only adding a touch more vanilla, and they came out fantastic. Just what I was looking for- an easy to make sugar cookie with a very nice flavor and great consistancy. Just a bit crackly-crunchy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. I'll be making these again!"
"1","3","Hmmm. What can I say? I wasn't overly 'wow-ed!' by these cookies. Nothing wrong with them at all, but, I added a cup of M&M's and I still thought they were a little plain. Also, these come out a little thin for my taste. Can't complain too much, cause they're gone....just probably won't make them again."
"1","5","These sugar cookies were wonderful. I did cut the sugar down to 2 cups. I had a taste test of 3 different kinds of sugar cookies and these came in first with the lesser amount of flour. Thanks!!"
"1","5","Me again...I tried making these with Almond Extract instead of vanilla...wow...taste just like the Almond cookies you get in a Chinese Resturant.I still rolled them in Raw sugar...Taste Great...What a good recipe..Cindy"
"1","5","I made this recipe for a Marriage Encounter get together. I did substitute Lemon Extract for the Vanilla, and they came out fantastic. I served the cookies with lemonade and iced tea. They were a hit. I liked how quick and easy they were to prepare. BTW, if you haven't taken a Marriage Encounter weekend, it's worth it, as it helps make your marriage as good as the cookies!"
"1","5","great! very easy and tasty - i rolled them in rainbow sugar crytstals!"
"1","5","I love these cookies! Like the title says.. IT'S EASY!!!.. i rolled the balls in different color sugars, sprinkles, and the last batch i put a hershey kiss in the middle right after i took it out. SO YUMMY!!!!! there're just the right chewy sugar cookies for me! i will def. make these again!!"
"1","5","These are the easiest and best tasting sugar cookies I have ever eaten!"
"1","5","These were super yummy, I changed the recipe a little bit... I only had 2 cups of flour so I added 2 packets of rich chocolate hot cocoa mix to the flour and they came out amazing. WOW, they werent chocolatey but the flavor was outstanding. Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
"1","5","Great cookies! Some I rolled in colored sugar, some I rolled in regular sugar and added a piece of maraschino cherry to the top and some I left plain. Absolutely delicious - light and fluffy."
"1","4","They were ok...nothing too special..they don't spread really when cooking...we flattened them out."
"1","4","These cookies tasted too floury to me. It's possible I accidently counted wrong and added too much, but if not then I'm just not impressed. I also added sprinkles which helped."
"1","5","Truly an easy recipe. Simple yet still tasty. My kids loved them. Thanks Stephanie."
"1","5","My mommy left me home alone because she took my sissy shoe shopping, so I made cookies all by myself because I wanted candy. I was going to use Vanilla, but I used lemon juice instead because I read the bottle and it said 'contains alcohol' and this is red ribbon week and I know drugs are bad. Anyway, my cookies came out the right way (crispy outside, chew inside) but when my mom and sister tasted them and said they were crispy, which made me kind of sad because I wanted chewy ones. Also, I put in powdered sugar because I read some other lady's recipe and hers had powdered sugar in it and I thought that would make it yummier, so maybe it did. I also put frosting on these because the cookies from the store have frosting and theirs are really squishy and yummy and I steal them all the time from the free cookie plate, but these didn't taste like them, so I guess that was bad. My sissy and mom just came home now and ate the cookies, here is their review 'yeah, these are ok, but Sarah is a super cook.' and 'I give these cookies a 5, but I'd probably give any cookie a 5.' kthxbye"
"1","5","Wow. it flattens out a LOT. But, they taste good. really soft and chewy, might break easily... all my friends loved it. too sweet for me, though"
"1","4","i was looking for a little more chewy on the inside sugar cookies but these were a little too fluffy for me. but my friends loved them!"
"1","5","I agree this is more like a shortbread cookie, but very easy and wonderful!!! Great to ice and decorate!"
"1","2","I was looking for a softer cookie than this recipe yields. I found that the cookies turned out thinner than I like, and the bottom was way too chewy for my taste (almost hard). I didn't throw away the cookies, but I will not make this recipe again."
"1","4","Very easy to work with, but lacked a little flavor. Definately use Janice Brubakers frosting!"
"1","5","My cookies came out perfect with this recipe. Not too hard, and not too soft with the perfect sweetness. Some of them, I rolled in cinnamon sugar before baking. This made them extra yummy."
"1","5","these made smiles on our faces. THANK YOU!!!"
"1","5","Very enjoyable! Very light and easy to make. Do not put on cookie sheet near oven, the batter gets really soft and sticks. I needed a good sugar cookie recipe, Thanks!"
"1","5","This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. The cookies looked and tasted great with red and green candy sprinkles for Christmas time."
"1","5","The cookies were very easy & tasty. Give them a try."
"1","5","Thanks for the great recipe! They were quick and easy to make as promised. I decorated them with frosting and sprinkles for the holidays. I hope you like theses cookies as much as I do!!  Merry Christmas"
"1","5","I tried first to roll these out and cut shapes- a disaster. However, that's not what the recipe says to do! I made them as described and they came out perfectly. They were delicious with buttercream icing."
"1","3","These cookies are 'okay'. I used less flour than called for because, as mentioned by others, the dough gets real crumbly. They are very crispy, but I prefer a more tender cookie."
"1","5","I am not much a a baker, but these cookies were simple and they came out tasting great. Thanks a whole bunch."
"1","4","the first time i made these they came out HORRIBLE i didnt know what was wrong w/ them untill i realized i added a 1/2 cup of butter instead of a cup and i messed the recipe up. I havent made them again yet but im planning on it. I'm sure they will be delicious-- i'll let you know!! :) (they were my first cookie baking experience)"
"1","5","EXCELLENT!!! SOOO EASY TO MAKE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! FOR SURE A KEEPER!! MADE FOR Fourth of July..a big hit!! thanx so much!"
"1","5","This could quite possibly be the easiest cookie recipe ever! I thought they were perfect, just soft enough. I also liked not having to roll the dough out and wait for it to chill. Thanks for sharing Stephanie, this is now THE sugar cookie recipe in our house. :)"
"1","3","Easy,Fast,Kid's loved them"
"1","5","The ultimate cookie to me is the sugar cookie and this is the ultimate recipe for those yummy cookies!"
"1","5","I thought these were very good! I am not a big fan of sugar cookies, but I enjoyed these. These were just the perfect consistancy-not too soft or too crunchy! I liked them also because they weren't overly sweet even though I rolled them in white sugar before I baked them. I liked the fact that I didn't have to place them in the fridge to chill also. Delicious!!"
"1","4","These cookies were really delicious. We wanted to use cookie cutters so we followed another reviewer's advice by adding 1/4 cup more flour. The dough was still too sticky when I rolled it so I just added more flour as I went. The cookies turned out a little hard, so either the 8 minutes is too long or the 375 is too hot, but once I adjusted it, they turned out fine. The cookies are a little bland, which is great if you add a frosting on top. Overall very good recipe and my 5 year old loved them!"
"1","4","These cookies were very good - i baked them closer to 12 minutes, and also pressed them flat before baking and so they would be crisp. Rolled them first in some sprinkles or red/green sugar- very Christmasy!"
"1","5","This recipe is a really good one! Easy is definitely what I'd call it. I used it to make cut-out Christmas cookies, but it did spread a bit too much. I'd recommend adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour to help the cookies keep their shape (or you could cut down a little on the butter). Also, I added about a teaspoon of lemon flavor just because I like a lemony hint in my sugar cookies. This one's a keeper!"
"1","5","I have always burned and ruined my cookies but these came out perfectly and were easy to make. They tasted wonderful and my roommates love them!"
"1","4","ONCE MADE THEY DON'T LAST TO LONG. NEED TO MAKE DOUBLE BATCHES SOMETIMES TWICE IN ONE DAY. THANKS"
"1","5","Insanely easy recipe..Family loved it..They didn't even last a day..I dressed half of them up by rolling them in unsweetened cocoa for a grownup taste."
"1","5","An excellent recipe, probably the best i've come across for some time"
"0","5","These taste great and even better if you roll them in sugar or even cinnamon sugar happy baking"
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made! Perfect. Chewy"
"0","5","Love how easy this recipe was to make. I had all the ingredients in my kitchen!!! I decided last minute to take half the cookie dough and I added 3 tablespoons of peanut butter, and wow they came out great!!!!"
"0","5","Really great sugar cookie recipe! The only one I've ever used! These don't need any frosting whatsoever, they're so good by themselves! Whole family loves them! Thanks for this!"
"0","1","The taste of the cookie was so bad! Didn't even taste like sugar cookies. Had a dry taste to it and to thick. I followed the directions exactly too! :("
"0","5","Great, fool proof recipe. I made them with my eight year old and they were great. We put sprinkles right in the dough to cut down on the mess, and they looked and tasted great. She even played with the dough to make shapes and it was pretty durable. This isn't a fragile dough. The taste was simple and great, although I think next time I might add a touch of salt, as I used unsalted butter. It might also stand up to some more adult spices to make them more complex. I will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious and so easy! I used unsalted butter and before baking I pressed each dough ball firmly into a mixture of sea salt, sugar and cinnamon. Yum!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies, and they are great! It's all I want in a sugar cookie. Delicious, and glad to have found the recipe."
"0","5","Don't even alter a thing!! Perfect!!"
"0","5","AMAZING!!!!"
"0","5","absolutely my favorite sugar cookie recipe. I do hate when people say 'best recipe out there' then have made 5+ different changes to make it the best for them. This one, I didn't have to change a single thing. they are perfect"
"0","1","If you could rate this a zero I would. I made these cookies and when I put them in the oven in the balls they covered the whole entire pan and basically I have to cut them out my own. But you can't because it's basically liquid with a thick layer of whatever liquid on top. I couldn't believe it. Don't make these. I'm sorely disappointed."
"0","5","I didn't actually make this - my 12 year old, 10 year old and 8 year old made it. And they turned out GREAT. We made no changes other than cooking them longer than the recipe called for (because my kids put too much dough on the cookie sheet ), just followed the recipe as written.   So if you are able to read to do basic cooking in the kitchen, these are easy to make and taste delicious just as it is. No changes necessary to get a great cookie!"
"0","5","A tip for keeping soft cookies soft, store in an airtight container with a slice of bread at the bottom. We save the ends for this purpose because no one likes to eat them."
"0","5","I rolled the dough balls in coarse sugar before baking and they came out splendidly! I was careful to use an oven thermometer and took one batch out at 8 minutes, one at 10 and another at 9. The 9 minute ones were soft, but held together perfectly with a lightly crispy outer crust. One taster said the cookies tasted like Christmas. I had toddlers rolling the dough balls and they still came out perfectly. I'm saving this recipe."
"0","5","This is the 1st ever sugar cookie recipe i've tried, and it turned out so delicious! I also modified them by adding a thumbprint of strawberry jam in the center of the cookie!"
"0","5","I'm an experienced baker, but it's nice to have a simple, easy and delicious sugar cookie recipe on hand for when my sweet tooth is calling! As ovens vary, I had to bake mine longer but other than that I followed the recipe. Oh--I did add colored sprinkles and made Funfetti sugar cookies!!"
"0","5","I made this recipe with my 2 year old today and we both loved it. Followed recipe exactly and it came out perfect, love that you can use it right away and don't have to wait to chill the dough. Total keeper."
"0","5","These cookies were wonderful! My boys helped with the mixing and stuff. I even saved a little of the dough and added some chocolate chips because my boys wanted them. These turned out fabulous too!"
"0","4","I made 52 very small cookies. They took about 15 min to bake but are a great snack"
"0","5","Fast and simple and didn't really need chilling!  I subbed 1/2 cup corn syrup for 1/2 cup sugar, as I find this helps keep the cookies moist.  I added 1/2 tsp salt, because I find it always helps the flavor.  My cookies did not spread much at all, even with the addition of liquid sugar, so I can see using them for simple shapes (probably not anything complex like snowflakes, though.) I used plain old mostly softened butter, and it worked fine without needing it to be close to melted. Extra beating may help - I always beat my butter/sugar mixture until nearly all the butter color is gone.   I use vanilla bean paste which is also a huge flavor booster - the kind that looks like dark brown sludge, not the syrupy kind from Williams Sonoma.   These were topped with a vanilla buttercream icing, and are just fantastic!"
"0","5","This recipe rocks! I just added a 1/2 tsp. salt . Otherwise this is the sugar cookie recipe I've been searching for!"
"0","4","Taste great but the next time I'll make it I will be less sugar  Still taste good but needed some water on it cause it was very hard"
"0","3","The first time I tried this recipe I mixed the dry and wet ingredients together in the same bowl, which was a BIG mistake. the batter turned into a crumbly mess, and I had to start over. Definitely make sure you mix them separate before putting them together. Also make sure you soften the butter, not melt it. Melting the butter my second attempt caused the cookies to come out extremely thin and crispy, although they still had a nice flavor. Overall they were good cookies, but I would not recommend them to someone who wants a limited amount of work."
"0","5","Added one more egg, half a teaspoon of vanilla and made sure that the butter is really really soft before I creamed it with sugar.  The only problem I encountered was that it was hard to 'shape' the dough, mine turned out sticky. Still, I managed to shape them by dusting my hands with a little bit of flour. Then I sprinkled honey granules and put a piece of chocolate chip on top of the cookies before baking.   The cookies turned out to be perfect after 8 minutes. Soft yet a little crunchy on the outside - Buttery and creamy, not too sweet. :-) yum!"
"0","5","WOW!!! These cookies are BEYOND AMAZING! I made them for my entire family and they absolutely LOVED them! I really recommend these to everyone."
"0","5","I tried them and they were and tasted fantastic! My parents loved them everyone loved them! They were a little dry when i mixed the dry ingredients in so i added a little bit of cream! But they tasted so good my mouth is already watering just thinking about them! Yummy! Ty for posting this easy recipe!"
"0","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe i have yet found!Just like others have said not too sweet and not too bitter but it kinda tasted like raw eggs the first time i tried them but the second time i had the genius idea of rolling the dough balls in sugar and that helped the taste by far! PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS USE THIS RECIPE!"
"0","5","I replaced the all purpose flour for Namaste gluten free all purpose flour and used up homemade lavender butter (about 3/4 cup), and 1/4 margarine. I set my oven to 350 and baked for 12 minutes. They came out great, even with the gluten free flour."
"0","5","the world's best sugar cookies!!!"
"0","1","These are the worst cookies I have ever made!"
"0","5","Yes i will make this again."
"0","5","These came out great! As some others have said if it did not come out right you probably did something wrong. Also the most helpful positive review as well as others is well... THE MOST HELPFUL. I always look at other peoples tips before I try a recipe. I rolled the balls in sugar and put in freezer as someone suggested. I did 8 minutes also. I also made a few with cinnamon and sugar an also a few with frosting. They all came out great! I made sure that butter was room temp also left it out on top of fridge for about 2 hrs before using. They're chewy and great. Trying not to devour them all. :)"
"0","4","Good cookies.   Easy recipe with easy ingredients.   Plain sugar cookie. Nothing special.   I frosted them. They needed a little something!"
"0","5","Everyone loved them! I found that putting them on the bottom rack of the oven for 17 mins. worked."
"0","5","My go-to sugar cookie recipe. I was looking for a recipe one day, out of boredom, and I saw this one. The reviews are all so positive and the cookies themselves seemed more than worth a try. I made them and my entire family fell in love. They began constantly begging me to make more, and I was always so excited to. I've experimented with different icings and frosting, with bake time, and with different colors. I have found what is, in my opinion, the best time to let them bake, and I'm very pleased. They aren't too soft, and they aren't too firm either- they're just right, and they're addicting. To the creator of this recipe; Bravo."
"0","5","I make these all the time now. A nice fluffy cookie. Would be great in other flavors too."
"0","4","They taste okay, but aren't as moist as other reviews suggested. Next time I'll try baking them for 8 or 9 minutes. Hopefully they go over well!"
"0","5","Yum!!!"
"0","5","These were sooo amazingly easy and yummy!! I used self rising flour so I didn't use baking power or baking soda. I also substituted the 1 cup butter for 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup water."
"0","4","Definitely make sure the butter is one step before melted. Also, I added 2 dashes of cinnamon and two pinches of sea salt, and they taste like French toast cookies. Great recipe!"
"0","4","Turned out perfect!! I'm only thirteen and I thought that the 1 cup of butter wouldn't be enough but I think it may have been more than enough. They are perfect, but next time I'll probably only add 1/2 cup of butter. Reduces the fat anyways ??"
"0","5","Best sugar cookies I've ever had. I added a little more vanilla (2 tsp.) and a pinch of salt, and I sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking. I too took them out around 8 minutes.They were delicious."
"0","5","We LOVE these cookies! They are so easy, delicious and fast. The cooking time is literally 10 minutes and the kids love to decorate them."
"0","5","great cookies!!:)"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. It is super easy and quick! I have trouble making them stick around in my house! They are just so good they are gone after a few minutes of being out of the oven"
"0","2","5 for being super easy (love that): The preschool with love them I'm sure.  2 for tastiness: They are kind of bland for an adult pallet I think..."
"0","5","So, the full recipe makes a total of 48 cookies?"
"0","1","Did not form a dough. When they were put into a pan they turned into a blob of goo. Looks were deceiving. After they came out of the oven from 15 minutes they looked hard, but the inside was a white glob."
"0","4","I have tried several sugar cookie recipes, following them as written. The taste was always off. I LOVE the way these taste but when I use it for cut out cookies they spread way too much. I tried chilling the dough before and after cutting but it doesn't help. Would anyone know how to adapt the recipe to minimize spreading? Maybe reduce the amount of baking powder/baking soda? Any suggestions?"
"0","5","YUM.. . easy.... super fluffy is how long you cream the butter and sugar.. until it is super duper fluffy... fold in the rest just until it is mixed and spoon the sticky mess onto a non stick sprayed pizza pan or cookie sheet.. I just put giant quarter cup size ones just a half inch apart.. all over it.. baking into one giant cookie.. I added a t. of cinnamon to butter and sugar mixture.. then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top before baking them... YUM YUM YUM."
"0","4","Very easy to make! The dough is easy to work with (I used cookie cutters and the dough wouldn't crumble and would roll out perfectly). My only complaint would be that the serving sizes are way off. I changed the serving size to 12, and the dough wasn't even enough to feed 5 hungry cookie eaters. So I would suggest you'd make way more than the serving size tells you how many people this will feed. Otherwise, these cookies came out well. Although, I kept them in the oven a tad longer than the bake time that was said. Then they were ready to come out of the oven."
"0","2","the dough is a big crumbly mess. Overall, they taste ok, but since the dough was so dry, the cookies didnt spread while they cooked. So I ended up having to flatten my dough balls a little bit on the pan before I cooked them. My kids like them, well because they're cookies, but nothing special."
"0","4","I just found this recipe today like I have done with all my cooking lately and this is such a simple and tasty recipe I even added pecans to mine which was still good"
"0","4","Great recipe when you need a quick sweet. The butter does have to be room temperature and I add 1 tsp Cream of Tartar, makes them soft and moist."
"0","2","no matter what I did to this reciepe these sugar cookies always came out more like a cake then they did cookies."
"0","5","Really easy to make and so yummy! They turn out great, soft and not too sweet. My girls can't get their hands off these cookies. Next time for sure we'll make double batch!"
"0","5","This was as it said, very simple to repeat. They do taste terrific. Although my suggestion would be to the uploader of this recipe to say that the dough should be refrigerated for at least an hour. I'm 3 cookies in and loving them but the second batch was refrigerated and look better."
"0","3","The dough ended up sandy, the cookies were too hard and needed more sugar. Otherwise it was ok."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Very quick and easy! Taste great!"
"0","5","These are easy to make and delicious! They were a little hard but they still were great! I rolled them out and used cookie cutters for Christmas cookies! They taste great without frosting too (:"
"0","5","It was really good... Except for the fact that we totally forgot to add the eggs. ADD YOUR EGGS."
"0","5","Love this recipe! I doubled it, used vegetable shortening instead of butter and added an extra egg. When I dropped them onto the cookie sheet with a teaspoon, I made a small impression on the cookies and put colored sugar on top. I will use this recipe from now on!"
"0","1","Wayyyy to much flour came out flaky. I did not care for the flavor, either."
"0","5","Very easy and great tasting!"
"0","3","This recipe was amazing when it was warm! It was soft with a not overly buttery flavor. You should make them when you're hungry though. When they cool completely they get dry, hard, and crumbly."
"0","5","Best sugar cookie recipe on here! My family and I love to makes these cookies, especially around the holidays. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","I love their recipe! I added a pinch of salt and an extra teaspoon of vanilla and they taste perfect!"
"0","5","I messed up the first batch but the second was soooo awesome I just put a li\let more vanilla exstract! Yummy."
"0","5","Delicious sugar cookies. I only changed the amount of dough I used for each cookie. I like a larger cookie. My first batch, using only a teaspoon of dough, came out a little small for decorating (baking for an elementary school party), but I used a tablespoon sized amount and they came out perfect. Will use this recipe again!"
"0","5","Super easy and delicious"
"0","5","The cookies turned out so delicious even though I used 1 cup of sugar instead 1.5 cups. It was just the right amount of sweetness for us and was soft and chewy. My husband loved it and he's very particular about his sweets. The recipe was so easy to make. Never will go back to store bought ones."
"0","5","Made these last year! Loved them! I am making them for one of my classes and I think everybody will enjoy them."
"0","5","Absolutely amazing! I am all about full on flavor, so I added a teaspoon of more vannila!"
"0","4","while the recipe tasted good, the dough was unsuitable for cookie cutters and rolling."
"0","4","I melted the butter then cooled it before adding to sugar. They were great"
"0","5","I love it it is so tasty and I think the whole world should get to taste them 5 stars!"
"0","4","I must say, these were very good and quite simple to make. the only thing I might do differently is decrease the temperature a bit, probably to 360 c as I found they browned faster than they cooked. the"
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly except I used 2 tsp. of vanilla. Made sure the butter was completely softened before creaming as someone else suggested. At first I thought the batter was too crumbly but the heat and pressure of your hands,as you roll the dough into balls,knits it together nicely. I used a rounded measuring tsp. and wound up with 70 cookies! I dipped each ball into colored sugar and baked for 10 minutes. Each cookie was approx. 2 inches in diameter when done. Absolutely delicious and slightly chewy, highly recommended! I will use these as part of my Chritmas gift trays for friends. Happy Holidays! John"
"0","5","I think this is a great recipe. My eggs were kinda small so I used two. Came out perfect!"
"0","5","I made them for the first time for my family and they just loved them. They keep asking me to make more. Really good."
"0","4","Great recipe. Maybe a little less flour, then it would have made it outstanding. The batter became crumbly, after letting it sit for around a day, but if it does, add water. It makes the batter stick better. I made Christmas shapes out of them, and they were uneven. This is my problem, but if your cookies are uneven, bake in oven for less time."
"0","3","These are good looking cookies. However I noticed after I made them this recipe has no salt. Whoopsies."
"0","4","This is a good simple recipe. It was missing salt so i added 1/2 a tsp. I was also wanting a christmas cookie that was easier than biscotti so i added dried crandberries and candied orange to the sugar and pulverized it in a food processor. I also added orange extract. It was a perfect texture with a holiday flavor. I also melted white chocolate and drizzled it accross the top. I will use this base recipe again."
"0","5","They are AWESOME!!!!"
"0","5","These cookies came out AMAZING! The only thing I did differently was rolling the balls in cinnamon sugar before I popped them in the oven. Will be making these again and again! Thank you!"
"0","5","Great"
"0","4","After i roll them into balls I then roll them into sugar. Will be making these again for Christmas."
"0","5","This is I think the best sugar cookies I have ever made. They are so soft n delicious!!!"
"0","5","This recipe turned out perfect! Ok, I did lessen the amount of flour using 2 1/2cups instead of the 2 3/4 it called for and used pure vanilla, not imitation and baked for 11 mins at 350. Worked great and tasted amazing! Thanks!!!"
"0","5","Excellent cookies and extremely easy recipe."
"0","5","I wanted an easy Christmas cookie recipe without a lot of mess or fuss, so of course the word 'easy' in the title caught my eye. After reading many of the reviews and hints -- one mentioned that the butter should be extra soft -- I made these. Oh. My. Heck. Easy is right! And my family can't stop eating them! Soft, chewy, with just the right bit of crisp around the edges, and not too sweet. When I tried to soften my butter in the microwave, it totally melted, so I added the sugar anyway, then put the bowl in the fridge for 10 minutes. And contrary to what someone else posted, these don't spread out that far on the cookie sheet. No one in our family likes iced cookies, so these are just perfect for us. Highly recommend! Highly!"
"0","5","Mmmm delicious! I followed the recipe exactly an they turned out great . Just make sure to soften the butter in the microwave !"
"0","5","use 1/2 teasp. vanilla and 1/2 teasp. almond extract"
"0","5","Simple recipe. Delicious cookies :) I substituted an extra pinch of baking soda for the baby powder. Also, I used safflower oil, instead of butter."
"0","2","They taste ok but came out flat"
"0","4","Only thing I did different is used an egg substitute and added a little salt. Good stuff!!!!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe and it came out perfect! Didn't have to change a thing they were delicious, me and my family enjoyed them, they didn't last long."
"0","5","Best sugar cookie recipe I've ever baked, or honestly tasted! 2nd time cooking! Husband and kids begged for me to bake again!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at sugar cookies and they were amazing!! I used 1 stick real butter, 1 stick margarine softened in the microwave and 2 tsp of vanilla. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. They were the perfect sugar cookies!!! Great recipe!!"
"0","2","I read through all of the reviews and was surprised that more people did not experience how crumbly this dough is. I made sure that my butter was room temp beffort I started to cream the egg and vanilla with it. The dough was so crumbly that I couldn't even get it to hold together. Too much flour. I ended up adding another egg and 2 tbls of butter. This gave me a workable dough. I am not impressed with the overall taste. They are very bland. I whipped up some buttercream frosting to top them and make them sweeter. Overall I don't think I'll try this recipe again. I will stick to a classic sugar cook recipe from now on."
"0","5","This is a great recipe for sugar cookies. Crunchy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside."
"0","5","For whatever reason, I had to bake them for 12 minutes. I checked them at 8 minutes but way too soft. At 10 minutes, still not quite there. At 12 minutes, they seemed perfect-easy to slide off the baking sheet (I always use a silpat) and no brown on the bottom. This recipe is great. I had my three-year old daughter sprinkle red and green sugar crystals on top right after they came out of the oven for festive holiday cookies."
"0","5","Super quick, super easy - my way of cooking! We added cinnamon and nutmeg. Unreal."
"0","5","Nice recipe. Five stars because it did exactly what was described, so no surprises, the result was exactly what I was looking for,and no changes were needed.   I made it exactly as is. Icelandic butter is a little stickier than American butter, so this still needed to be chilled a bit to be rolled. Watch the baking time really carefully. If you want them to stay soft then take them out the moment the edges start to brown."
"0","4","This is incredible and so easy! This was my first time making cookies and because of this they were a success."
"0","4","Easy recipe. I should have made the dough balls less roubd though..."
"0","5","This is my first review, although I use allrecipes all the time. I am a cook, not a baker. I decided on a whim to try to bake cookies. I read the reviews and decided that since it makes 4 dozen I would try 4 different kinds. One with a reese's cup in the center after baking, one rolled in sugar, one rolled in cinnamon sugar, and one where I squeezed the juice of an orange. Wow !!!!!! These are amazing, and so easy. Definitely make sure the butter is super soft (I put mine in the microwave on 40% power for 40 seconds)and use the extra vanilla. Thank you! I have to go eat cookies now."
"0","5","Super easy & tastes great!"
"0","5","Very yummy very quick very easy!"
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have made. Super quick and super easy. I made a double batch and they were gone in a day."
"0","3","I didnt tweak the recipe at all and the cookies came out hard at 8 minutes, with pan rotation halfway through. I limited the Time to 6 minutes, and they were undercooked. So there wasnt very much leeway room. Ive true many recipes but always soon to get a hard sugar cookie. Good luck with your baking journeys."
"0","5","Quick, easy, ingredients on hand . I did use two eggs. Very soft chewy, cookies. Take out at 8 min do not over cook. I used real butter, they were amazing!"
"0","4","I softened my butter pretty well in the microwave, but when I did the final mixing at the end, I had crumbs! So I added another egg and the dough was great! Delicious cookies! I rolled them in colored sugar to make them christmas-y!"
"0","4","Great recipe! Giving this a 4 star instead of 5 because I did a lot to the recipe to make it more awesome. First, I cut the recipe in half. (I didn't want to make 4 dozen, only 2) I kept the egg and vanilla amounts as the original recipe because so many people complained of a hard crumbly dough (eggs tenderize pastries) and that the recipe was tasteless (vanilla extract helps with flavor). I then let the butter completely soften (letting it melt on the stove is a bad idea. Melted butter can melt the sugar. This is bad because sugar is also a tenderizer for the flour.) Then I went about my business as the recipe directed, mixing REALLY well. I molded the cookies into flatten balls. I didn't place them on a greases cookie sheet, but parchment paper over a cookie sheet. Parchment paper is the BEST! As a finishing touch, I sprinkled sugar over the cookies. I cooked both batches for 8 minutes as the recipe said and let them rest on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes. They come out so tender and crispy and soft and tasty! YUM YUM YUM!!!"
"0","4","I tried the recipe but, used margarine instead of butter and rolled the dough balls in sugar before I baked them. They are perfect."
"0","5","I added cranberry and walnut . Also added oat to cumbs."
"0","5","I did the recipe like it said except I added a bag of heath toffee bits..delicious"
"0","5","Best sugar cookies ever!!! My whole entire family loved it. If u take the cookies out of the oven right when they are a little crackly at the ends of the cookies they are delicious!!! :)"
"0","5","I was looking for an easy cookie recipe that I could make with ingredients that I already had in my pantry and refrigerator. I found this sugar cookie recipe and not only was it easy, but it was a huge hit with my family! Half of them were eaten as they came out of the oven. I will definitely make these again and again."
"0","5","A very easy, perfect sugar cookie :-)"
"0","5","I just made these! DELICIOUS! Crispy on the outside/chewy in the inside! I will definitely make these again!"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","These cookies are oh so easy and really yummy!!!!! Instead of using vanilla extract, I used lemon."
"0","5","Great!"
"0","1","Didn't work. Cookies did not flatten."
"0","5","Love this recipe. I add fun things like lavender, rose sugar, or lemon zest. True though that the butter must be completely softened for nice, soft cookies. But if you like crunchier cookies, use harder butter and leave them in for a few extra minutes."
"0","5","The batter is crumbly but if you add a bit of warm water and work it into a big ball with your hands it softens up and the cookies turn out wonderful!! I used maple flavouring and added some pecans :)"
"0","5","This turned out perfect ! I had no baking powder on hand but still turned out awesome. Unfortunately second batch stayed in too long so make sure to watch them. They were chewy moist and delicious, best sugar cookie recipe I've used to date"
"0","5","Great! This was the first time I made cookies from scratch. All the ingredients were in my kitchen! I added ppeppermint extract to make them more holiday like."
"0","5","love it"
"0","1","Too much flour it didnt stick together!!!"
"0","5","Best sugar cookie recipe ever!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and tastes really good."
"0","4","Considering that I have NEVER made cookies from scratch, I found this recipe extremely easy and the cookies turned out great. I read through the reviews beforehand, so I ended up only increasing the vanilla extract to 2 tsp. At first I was worried that the dough would turn out crumbly as other reviewers had stated, and when I first began to add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar I thought it was going to turn out awful. I kept mixing the dough and after a few minutes it came together perfectly. I baked them for the recommended 8 minutes and the cookies came out soft and chewy. I love sugar cookies, but I found that these did taste a bit like flour. I think next time I'll try adding some lemon to them."
"0","5","Only change was to double vanilla. Great cookies to put sprinkles on with the kids. Easy, fast, and made a lot more than I was expecting."
"0","4","these are good, only things i changed was i put in 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, and i used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of margarine, good and soft."
"0","4","A refreshing cookie. Better than store-bought. Here are the changes I made- used only one cup of sugar and added one and a half teaspoons of Orange Blossom water. I also only cooked the cookies for nine minutes in the oven. I live in Denver Colorado so up here things cook quicker. My cookies were perfectly soft and were not crumbly like many other reviewers reported. Do not over cook these cookies and you will be fine!"
"0","5","Great and simple recipe."
"0","5","Yes I tried this recipe and there one thing I changed in stead of 1 teaspoon vanilla I used I tes spoon of almond extract and it trued out good my sister likes them from plan cookie to a very good cookie."
"0","5","Great recipe! I love that the ingredients were simple and could all be found in a basic pantry! I accidentally added 1/2 cup sugar to the flour..oops! ...lol But they came out golden and buttery crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside! I've dusted a few with icing sugar and others I've spread a cream cheese icing and then sprinkled on chocolate chips and butterscotch chips..."
"0","4","I love these cookies my only complaint is that it took 10mins longer to fully cook"
"0","5","These turned out excellent. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes and they were perfect. I did choose to use 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla instead of just 1"
"0","5","So I saw this recipe and had to try it, i admit I was a bit skeptical seeing they didn't look too tasty in the photo, but I love these sugar cookies. the best ever but instead of using vanilla I used pancake syrup. TASTES AMAZING!!!! Everyone loved them. They had a little crunch to them on the edges and in the middle the were so soft and chewy."
"0","5","I'm was out of store bought cookies in the house and my toddler was not happy with me. So I knew I had all the stuff to make sugar cookies. So I googled sugar cookies and this recipe came up. I didn't read one review i just need cookies. (lol) So I made them and they came out awesome! So quick and easy! I will be making these again!!"
"0","5","I was looking for an easy sugar cookie recipe that made a good cookie. What I found was that this recipe makes an easy great cookie!! I can't figure out how some of the people who wrote the reviews had bad luck with this recipe. I will say, that my butter had sat out for hours so it was very soft (not melted). My grandson and I made these and they came out perfect first time. I have made them since and they always come out perfect. Looking forward to making them at Christmas with green and red sprinkles. Also, looking forward to making them with lemon flavoring. They are so easy, they have become my 'go to' cookie if I need something in a hurry! Thank you for this recipe!!!"
"0","5","The best sugar cookies ever! This is definitely my go to recipe!"
"0","5","Constantly using this recipe!"
"0","5","Just made these cookies, and they are delicious!! Crispy on the edges, and soft and chewy in the middle. I rolled the balls in granulated sugar before baking. Yummers!!"
"0","5","Delicious, I had to work hard to get all of that flour mixed in, but if you give each dough ball a squeeze before baking they stay together well. Easy and yummy. Thanks!"
"0","5","Super easy and easy for the kiddos to help with! Love that you dont have to refridgerate the dough before hand! Makes it so much easier for a fast treat for the kids."
"0","5","After reading some of the reviews I baked the cookies for 8 minutes. Instead of using the 'stick butter' I used butter that comes in the plastic tubs, like country crock. It's already soft for the most part. It is really important to gradually mix in the dry ingredients, so don't get ahead of yourself. As long as the cookies are baked no more than 8 minutes they come out perfect and taste amazing! Also try different flavored extracts in lieu of vanilla, like rum or peppermint for the holidays."
"0","1","I checked and double-checked my ingredient amounts. I did everything as it said. I even checked reviews and made sure my butter was properly softened. What I got after 8 minutes was round balls of dough that didn't flatten, were very VERY dry on the outside, and uncooked on the inside. I've never had this happen before"
"0","5","Eating one right now! Yummmmmy! I split the amount of sugar 1/2 & 1/2 with white and brown, made some powder sugar icing to spread on once cooled and they are very good."
"0","5","This is the BEST sugar cookie recipe! I actually used the dough for shape cookies for Halloween so I put the dough in the fridge for an hour. The dough is definitely crumbly at first but it comes together nicely in your hands (it's like pie crust!) and then you can roll it out (I did it in small batches). I was worried it wouldn't work for shale cookies but it worked perfectly. The cookies are absolutely DELICIOUS and I will definitely add this recipe to my collection. This is now my go-to sugar cookie recipe. Thank you so much!"
"0","5","Let me say these are some really good cookies. I use this recipe for most of my cookies and I just add what I want to taste. For example, I add any nuts, lemon flavor or chocolate chips. So instead of me having a bunch of recipes in my book for cookies, I use this one. And it's really good with cream, blue berries and chopped strawberries. Oh and I always use butter Crisco. I hope you will enjoy these cookies just as my family and I do every Sunday as a snack."
"0","5","A really great sugar cookie recipe! Like another poster had put it, I too was looking for a good sugar cookie recipe. I've tried so many and they would most of the time be way too thick or just as flat as a pancake no matter what i tried. I would like to add that I used margarine for this recipe (country crock) and it turned out just fine. I also just plopped the dough onto the sheet rather than roll it and it made the pretty cracks in the cookie. I tried rolling the dough and giving it the tiniest pat and they didn't turn out as good looking so I suggest stick with the plopping, haha. I made half the batch plain for the kids and the other half snickerdoodles. I'm going to add my picture of the snickerdoodles so keep and eye out for it ;) This was a nice, light, not-too-sweet cookie and I had the dough made and on the cookie sheet before the pre-heat oven beeper went off, lol! Give it a try!!!"
"0","3","I tried this recipe and it was just ok. Recipe turned out crumbly with no flavor but my husband ate two plates full so i gave it a three lol it might just be me lol. Looking forward for more recipes on the website!:-)"
"0","5","This recipe was awesome. Only thing I had to leave it longer than suggested time. Might be cause I have a gas stove. They taste delicious!!!"
"0","4","Made these cookies for the 4th today. They were a hit with my family, but one thing to note is that you SHOULD NOT use an ungreased cookie sheet. Continue the recipe as normal, but you should probably use a piece of parchment paper to keep the batter from sticking. Other than that, great recipe, really fast for an Independence Day treat!"
"0","5","I simply LOVED IT. I ate 7-10 within the 1st few hrs. Now I want to make some everyday!!! =)"
"0","2","I added a half cup of peanut butter and they were magical."
"0","5","Made these late last night and they we a hit. I followed the recipe, only I rolled the dough balls in sugar before baking. Sooo good."
"0","5","Came out just right! My husband asked me one night if I would make my homemade cookies again but he requested iced sugar cookies. I used this recipe and they came out amazing! I also added chocolate chips to some since the recipe makes so much. Great and easy to make"
"0","5","this a great recipe and my family loved it when I made it. my mom said if u don't have eggs, then u could use applesauce and its 1/2 cup of applesauce per egg."
"0","5","I didn't add water"
"0","3","i was very excited to try this recipe, but the batter was very crumbly, and i had to take handfuls of the crumbs to form a cookie because they didn't spread either.I will try this again though , because they tasted really good."
"0","5","This recipe is perfect! No problems what-so-ever. I baked them for nine minutes in the oven. I have made these way more than once. They stay soft for at least 3 days! Just put them in a bag and set them on your counter. :)"
"0","4","I thought this is an amazing recipe but it did not make 48 cookies like it said... it only made like 24"
"0","5","This sugar cookies were awesome I am making some for father's day!!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!"
"0","5","My 10 yr old daughter has been making these (BY HERSELF!!!) and asked me to save this recipe. They turn out delicious every time!! Super easy and we always have the ingredients on hand. :o]"
"0","5","This was great! Fast. Simple. And I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts to make my Dad happy ;) A+ cookie"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly except I melted the butter, and added cinnamon. They were firm on the outside and soft on the inside. They turned out great! Me and my husband loved them!"
"0","5","Awesome!!!! Will bake some more!!!"
"0","4","I made this recipe for my siblings and parents they loved it and I added peanut butter(creamy) and they loved them the most. I hope I find more recipes that are even better."
"0","5","Excellent and easy. I used half butter flavored shortening and half butter (softened in a microwave), added a little extra vanilla and cut back the flour a bit, about a 1/4 of a cup. They turned out fantastic!"
"0","5","Easy and so good. Nice combo of soft and chewy. Taste just as good after freezing; just put on the serving plate and they're ready to eat in under five minutes. Actually, they're great while they're still frozen. While they are still icy cold, they have a nice snap to them. I used a 2 tsp. disher, which made 78 perfect 2 1/2 inch cookies."
"0","2","great taste, bad texture"
"0","4","Loved this recipe. It was easy. I agree with other reviews, stick to 8 minutes, make sure butter is soft. I personally will add the extra vanilla my  next batch. I would love a little more flavor."
"0","2","This recipe was going fine until i had to roll them into balls for the oven - the mixture was very sticky and messy but i did what it said and 'rolled it into balls' (well i tryed) as soon as i put the tray into the oven, they all melted into one ginormous cookie!! It tasted very good but a big flat sticky mess was not at all suitable for the upcoming bake sale... sorry xx"
"0","5","Quick, tasty cookies! I needed a recipe for cookies that would take 30 min tops, and these were perfect. Easy, simple ingredients, and they have a lovely texture. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. My cookies looked store bought and were soft and chewy. I can NEVER get my cookies to turn out the way these turned out...so I added chocolate chips and made me a chocolate chip cookie with some of the batter. These cookies were indeed EASY to make!"
"0","5","These cookies were pretty good. With such basic ingredients, I was able to bake my first cookie from scratch--That is without grandma. I followed the recipe exactly as stated except for I replaced the egg with a mixture of 2 tablespoons of water, 1 teaspoon of oil and 2 teaspoons of baking powder and I added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. This worked great with this recipe. I wish I had seen the post stating to take them out of the oven at 8 minutes, no longer. They are a bit crisp, but not falling apart. They're still a good chewy, yummy cookie. Simple and awesome!"
"0","4","definitely quick and easy to whip up a batch."
"0","5","Awesome! It was too good to be true"
"0","2","Way to sticky and hard to handle!"
"0","5","Very easy and very good. I will use this recipe next time I make sugar cookies."
"0","5","I love this recipe. Half way through mixing the dry and wet ingredients the dough got crumbly. Once it was done, however, I chilled it for two hours and dropped teaspoons of them on the baking sheet. My oh my are they good. And heres a tip. If yiu are just getting your butter out of the fridge, run it in the microwave for about 20 seconds. The inside will melt but the outside will be only slightly warm and that means the sugar will cream into it better.and dont be tempted to do shapes with this recipe. I tryed and the teapots and teacups I made look like blobs. Yummy, roundish, slightly warm blobs. I also added half a teaspoon of salt to give it a kick in the right place."
"0","2","way too crumbly, they dont stick together, i would recommend to reduce the flour by one cup and add two eggs."
"0","5","For a tastier cookie add an equal amount of Almond Extract to the vanilla!! Loved it!"
"0","5","These cookies turned out WONDERFUL!!! My family LOVED them. Even the next day, the cookies were still soft and gooey! Just the way we love them!"
"0","5","i tried the recipe and i loved it i actually rolled my dough out floured the surface with a little powdered sugar, and cut out hearts and stars for my sons, and they loved them they went so quick. i have already put out more butter to make another batch, they were great."
"0","4","eh! it was pretty good but, i think you need 2 minuets of cooling before there good. at first i thought they were under cooked. -_-"
"0","5","This was a great recipe! I've been searching for a good sugar cookie recipe, and I think I finally found one! Although, I did cook them for 8 minutes and 30 seconds though, because I like my cookies soft and chewy.  Great Recipe!!!!! :)"
"0","5","Very easy, took the suggestion of adding more vanilla (I did an addtl. 1 tsp but 1/2 would be sufficient), room temperature butter, and baking for 8 minutes and they came out great. I mixed everything with a hand mixer and it looked crumbly, until I rolled them for the baking sheet - they were perfect! I rolled some in sugar and they came out that delicate white with those sugar sparkles. Beautiful! I also rolled some in sugar and cinnamon and the very last bit I added a little nutmeg into the mix as well. All seem to be popular with my husband who is picky about his cookies!  They flattened a little bit (see photo) but relatively held their shape. I could see these working for cookie cutters!  8 minutes is perfect, they look soft but harden just enough once out of the oven. One batch I left in an extra minute or so and they were a firmer (and a bit dryer) overall."
"0","1","Way too cake like. Not soft at all."
"0","5","The perfect sugar cookie in my opinion! Slightly crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth soft on the inside! Followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing!"
"0","5","This was a very easy recipe. The cookies turned out nice and soft. I only changed up using egg whites instead of the whole egg. (i was out and only had whites!) they still turned out very very yummy. Got the taste seal of approval from my 4 yr old daughter. ;) fast prep, fast bake. We are going to use candy melts and drizzle it on them for a quick topping. I think they will taste like cake pops when i do this. lol Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","I made a double batch, added about half a teaspoon of extra vanilla, and on about thirty six of them (halfish) I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar. My family loved them. Even my dad who rarely eats desserts."
"0","5","I just tried this recipe, and it was fantastic! It is so simple and so fast, and it tastes just as awesome! The cookie is crispy on the outside and soft and mushy in the inside and has a perfect not-too-sweet taste. Loved it !"
"0","5","Great recipe! Used coconut oil instead of butter and white whole wheat flower. Amazing and easy."
"0","5","I had to make these for a presentation in English class, my teacher gave us an 'A' just because they tasted amazing! The class loved them and I had extra for myself :) the cookies were very light and fluffy, and if you put frosting on top it is perfection. 8 minutes is a great time to bake them for. The picture is what's left after my presentation."
"0","5","Easy, delicious, ingredients I always have available. Need to make this more often!!"
"0","5","I added a little extra sugar, an extra egg, and a dash of milk and they turned out perfect!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing!! Their not too sweet and their soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. I followed the reviews and put them exactly 8 minutes in the oven, after letting them cool for about 10 minutes they were perfect! Totally making them again :)"
"0","5","This is only the second time I tried making from-scratch cookies and they were unbelievable. Crispy outside, soft inside. I actually melted the butter on the stovetop instead of waiting for it to come to room temp."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I made Easter cutouts and they came out great! Be sure to add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and refrigerate before cutting our shapes."
"0","4","the cookies were so fluffy and light i loved how the recipe was so simple and they didn't get hard after i left them overnight"
"0","5","Amazing! I have a butter trick that I use for pies, pastries and other recipes: grate your butter with a cheese grater! I have also used half butter/ margarine. Even if the butter is cold and the dough is kind of crumbly, just knead with your hands and voila! I have used this recipe many times and it's perfect EVERY time. Kids love when it's rolled in cinnamon and sugar."
"0","5","Great recipe! Has become a family favorite."
"0","5","I have made sugar cookies for years. They are my husbands favorite. Hands down the best ever according to him and my sons.  They were so easy to make! Dough comes out a bit dry but rolled into balls easily (or squeezed).  Highly recommend these!"
"0","3","The recipe for 24 really only made 16, because there was way too much flour in the recipe. The taste was pretty good."
"0","1","Does not work with Splenda"
"0","5","My friends and I started to make this. But we dont like directions, so we just threw everything in a bowl and turned on the mixer. Looked like moon sand so we added a couple 'dashes' of milk, vanilla, and those heart candies you get on valentines day that taste like chalk. All in all, after arguing about how big they should be (apx: 1/2 in) and baking w/out a timer till they started to smell just a tad burnt, they turned out great! Looked exactly like the picture! Tasted amazing too! Try our way! It works!"
"0","5","The Perfect sugar cookie. Easy recipe and very tasty. Will be using this recipe from now on."
"0","5","Awesome!! I used the 'change servings' option to make only 12 cookies. It asked for 1/4 of an egg. Even though I was not very accurate with measuring the egg, plus adding food coloring and extra flour to make up for the added liquid, these still worked. I added extra vanilla for flavor also. They tasted great and had a nice texture. I read another review that said to make sure the butter was completely softened so I made sure to do that as well. Will definitely make these again. Very easy and not very many ingredients!"
"0","5","Great cookies! They are still delicious and chewy two days later. I knew the day before that I wanted to bake these cookies the next say so my butter (unsalted) sat for a full day on counter top. I realized that I'd ran out of baking powder so I used 2 tsps of baking soda and a tsp of fresh lemon juice to make up for those acidic components and they were absolutely out of this world! I did start with rounded tsps of dough but they were too small. So I finished up with 1/2tbsp for each cookie. 1tsp will take 8mins and the 1/2tbsp took no more than 10mins. Enjoy!"
"0","5","This recipe is ridiculously easy and delicious! I used it to make Piñata Cookies (3 cookies put together with royal icing, the middle cookie has its center cut out and filled with candies) and they were absolutely perfect! I baked each pan of cookies for only 8 minutes and they turned out crunchy and just how i like sugar cookies. It was a last minute decision to make these for my Spanish class, so I am very pleased with the result. Even my parents, who have been bakers since they were teenagers, said they were delicious! I've never baked on my own before, and I'm so happy these were my first from-scratch cookies. I plan on making more this weekend!"
"0","5","Loved these! I split this recipe in 1/2 and rolled the other have in cinnamon and sugar. I can't decide which I like better!!"
"0","5","I love it!! I add cinnamon and sugar on top to make them snickerdoodle cookies! This is our family's favorite!"
"0","5","I have been baking for years and this is the best sugar cookie I ever had! For people whose cookies didn't come out as expected you should set your butter and cold ingredients out some hours before your ready to prepare."
"0","5","Excellent very easy to follow and love the cookies 'yummy' ??"
"0","5","Best. Cookies. Ever! I used twice the vanilla and made sure the butter was totally soft before I started (like other reviews suggested) and they were perfect!"
"0","5","Easiest and most tasty sugar recipe I've ever tried! The only thing I suggest is using margarine instead of butter. They come out so much more chewy this way. Other than that, I don't change a thing. This will forever by me go-to sugar cookie recipe."
"0","4","I added milk to mine to make the batter more of a cookie batter instead of crumply and hard. The milk helped to soften it and they were more moist and didn't get hard after a day."
"0","5","this was an awesome recipe and I loved how soft they turned out to be! My niece and nephew loved them and my sister wanted the recipe! I had pressed vanilla chocolate chips into the cookies right when they came out of the oven! they were just the right amount of sweetness and were awesome with the chocolate chips! I will be telling everyone I know about this. Loved it so much! My sister thought these were my own recipe and I told her that I got this awesome recipe and I told her the ingredients. She said she baked them and loved them! (again)"
"0","5","An ultimatum given by my kids to make cookies before they reached home from school. Started net surfing ,came across this simple recipie ,tried it ,it was an instant hit..... My kids loved it and I was graded as a good baker."
"0","3","really easy and good but they didn't come out like the picture but exactly as they were dumped. maybe because i used dark brown sugar?"
"0","3","This was a basic 'good to ramp up' type of recipe. Like others, I softened the butter, to the point that I put it in the microwave for 15 seconds. I used almond extract and doubled the amount. I then stuck with 8 minutes as others did.  The one place the recipe went wrong was putting them on an ungreased cookie sheet. They stuck to the pan, big time, and the only way I was able to bake the second batch was to put a piece of waxed paper over the stuck-on bits and layering the cookies from there.   Overall, just OK. Nothing special."
"0","5","Great cookie! I subbed 1/2 the white sugar with brown sugar.. The result? A great, more complex flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","3","NEEDS TWEEKING!!!! I made this recipe twice. First time I followed the directions exactly as written. The dough was too dry and the cookies came out hard. Second time: I cut the flour in half and kept the wet ingredients as written. Cookies came out perfect and delicious. My kids loved them. I loved them. I ate too many of them. If you are going to do this recipe please watch the dry ingredients. Add them slowly and stop when the dough becomes firm enough to make balls easily with your fingers. Too much flour can cause an unhappy cookie. In the future I will be using only half the dry ingredients due to my most recent experience."
"0","5","they tasted amazing!!!!"
"0","5","I've never made homemade sugar cookies, these were so easy even a novice made them tasty. I did accidentally double the baking powder - whoops - and for a little extra appeal I dipped the dough balls in white and colored sugar. I only baked mine for 8 minutes, they came out with a soft crunch and a little chewy goodness in the middle, perfect if you like your sugar cookies from the fridge."
"0","1","These just did not work. They stayed in balls...tried flattening the next batch but just did not work."
"0","5","These cookies tasted so good we gobbled them up! I used lemon juice instead of baking powder (1.5tsps) and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla! Cook for 8 minutes and then let them sit for 2 minutes on the pan and they were perfect! (Make sure your butter is soft as well)"
"0","5","I have tried this recipe- it is literally THE BOMB!!!!! I shaped them like hearts. :)"
"0","5","Fantastic! Hands down the best sugar cookie recipe ever. Easy to make, easy to modify and cooks up golden brown. Five stars and a Facebook like, Stephanie. Awesome!!!!"
"0","5","I was looking online trying to find a recipe with really good reveiws and when I found this one it tried it and it's amazing"
"0","1","Not a fan! They taste like eggs! Not worth the 3 hours of baking it took me. :( I followed the recipe, and I used completely softened margarine instead of butter. I added a bit of extra vanilla, but they still tasted bad! The texture was very cakey, and the dough was wet and hard to handle. Not my best sugar cookies!"
"0","5","My family loves sugar cookies. I frost mine with homemade frosting and then use all natural sprinkles. This recipe is by far the easiest I found and cookies come out great. Only problem is in my house the cookies only last a day."
"0","2","Easy recipe...bland taste even after adding almost double the vanilla and adding nutmeg. Didn't flatten out while baking...lowered temp, added extra softened butter. Very crumbly batter. Definitely won't make this again"
"0","4","I really enjoyed making them nice and easy and tasty I added a little of cinnamon sugar as soon I took them out of the oven a little extra flavor yummie ALANE"
"0","5","Awesome! No changes, no fuss, no muss, just fabulous!"
"0","5","These are great!! I would recommend slightly flattening them once they're on the pan...other than that, those cookies are wonderful."
"0","5","These are delicious! Add the extra tspn of vanilla and have the butter completely softened. Also, when rolling out, use powdered sugar on the surface you are rolling and on the top of the cookie batter so your rolling pin doesn't stick. I had so many compliments on them and am looking forward to making these for other holidays."
"0","1","Fell apart, couldn't roll cookies."
"0","5","These are total winners! Used almond extract instead of vanilla. Unbelievably simple! Recipe is surely a keeper!"
"0","2","My daughter and I thought we'd make some sugar cookies to decorate this evening. I thought the 'easy' sugar cookies would whip up real quick. But the batter is too dry and crumbly to work with. I have a distraught 7-year-old and all I can think of to do is start over with a different recipe."
"0","5","Soft and chewy. Rolled them in rainbow sprinkles for a bake sale. Everyone loved them."
"0","5","I've made these cookies twice. They are great! Instead of the usual way of baking them, I baked them in a mini-muffin pan; when they were finished, I put a Hershey's Kiss in them. My granddaughter is allergic to peanutbutter, so I wanted to find an alternative. Everyone loved them! The second batch, well, I wish I'd read some; reviews first. I didn't have any butter; didn't think a spread would work; so I used--(gasp) Crisco. Yeah, the dough very dry and won't hold together. I may add a little milk to see if that helps. Also, I Love the recipe adjustment for more servings!"
"0","2","I did exactly what the recipe said. I even used a mixer but the recipe just did not turn out"
"0","5","Wow. Best sugar cookie recipe I've tried. Amazing. Bake for 8 minutes and use margarine. They weren't golden but so so soft and chewy. Love them!!!"
"0","2","There is absolutely nothing wonderful about this recipe, as you could probably guess from the ingredients. It tastes like your average run of the mill sugar cookie. How anyone could rate it above 3 stars is beyond me. Don't waste your time or ingredients, seek something better."
"0","5","Amazing!!!! Its perfect,easy,and really good...make sure your butter is softened ...i read one comment on here that said that before i made it and it really makes a difference !!!"
"0","5","Thesewere really easy to make, a little plain but still good. My family loved them. Dont overbake them like me. Just 8 minutes. theyll be very chewy and crisp on the edges."
"0","5","This was super easy to make and very good! I like my cookies a little on the softer side so I took them out at 8 minutes as another reviewer suggested. Other than that, I follower the recipe to a 'T'. Fantastic!"
"0","5","I use this recipe all the time. It's one of the few recipes that I change. The butter being crumbly is never an issue for me since I always have a stick or two at room temp. This recipe is also perfect for making snickerdoodles. Just roll each ball in a mixture of equal parts cinnamon and sugar. And if you prefer softer cookies like I do, store in an air tight container with a slice of bead."
"0","5","These cookies were so GOOD and easy! The best part is that I already had all the ingredients on hand! I microwaved my butter in a glass mixing bowl until it was soft and proceeded from there. Once everything was mixed together, I scooped out balls of dough. I made some plain, some with sprinkles, and rolled some in a mixture of Cinnamon and Sugar. I would most certainly make this again and I'm adding this to my recipe book permanently!"
"0","5","Love These! Simple and Delicious!"
"0","5","Perfect and so easy~"
"0","2","The dough was crumbly as some people said--but the cookies weren't dry. In fact, I had to lower the oven and bake them not a second longer than 8 minutes. The bottoms were overbrowned and the insides were still a touch squishy. Not ideal results. I did soften the butter in the microwave on the lowest setting, bcs of the house not being warm enough to achieve soft butter at room temperature. That being said, the cookies still firmed up when cool and are just not at all what I expected from other people's experiences with this recipe! I tried to save these with icing in them, macaron-style. The cookies are too firm, though, and the icing squishes out. I tried making the balls of dough larger and flattening them with a pancake turner a bit before baking. Those did spread out and look more normal, but they really got too brown and I was a little horrified. My roommate thought they were the best she'd ever eaten in her entire life. (I won't tell you how old she is, but that's a good compliment. LOL) I felt like everything went wrong with this recipe, but it wasn't for lack of trying. I should have gone through the trouble of making a rolled-dough style cookie batch, instead. I'm not making this again. Sad face."
"0","5","I made these...very buttery taste....loved them!"
"0","5","THIS RECIPE IS THE EASIEST ONE I HAVE EVER MADE, AND THE COOKIES ARE JUST FANTASTIC, THEY JUST MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, IF YOU WANT TO TRY SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT, TRY ADDING ALMOND EXT, AND PLACE ONE ALMOND IN CENTER OF COOKIE BEFORE BAKING, THEY ALSO SOME OUT WONDERFUL,HAVE FUN TRYING DIFFERENT EXTRACTS"
"0","4","I have found you need to add a small amount of water. This is key to making soft chewy cookies. I have added coca chips and made the very best chip cookies my kids have ever ate."
"0","5","I'll add my review to the other gazillion! These were fantastic! I didn't even use a mixer, just a wooden spoon to mix. If I could advise one thing, it is to not crowd them on the cookie sheet, and you will get beautiful, large, round cookies. Worth the extra time it takes. I will be using this recipe over and over. Quick, easy and delicious, and you can't ask for more than that!"
"0","5","These came out pretty good!! Nice and soft.. only thing I did different was add more vanilla :)"
"0","4","The cookies were very good, except for the fact that the dough was extremely crumbly and dry. I added a bit of water to soften them up. Overall, they were very delicious."
"0","2","Hmm... Well, the cookies didn't really spread and each bite is dryer than the last. I think it was the baking powder that made it so puffy and cake-like. I'll look for a recipe the omits it."
"0","5","Great recipe - the cookies were a hit at our Christmas office party .it will definitely be permanent in my recipes...thanks for sharing :))"
"0","5","great rrcpe didnt have enough vanilla so substitude with lemon extract best sugar lemon cookies i ever had better then any store bought cookie by far"
"0","5","We made these delicious cookies in my class. Simple and easy, not only did they taste delicious I also made a100 on my lab for the class"
"0","5","This is so simply to make! I actually melted the butter since I rarely remember to take the butter out and it doesn't soften well in the winter time anyway, which really cuts time honestly cause then I can make it quickly the moment I think of it. I put it in for 8 minutes and the edges are crispy, but the center is nice and soft, but not dry, love it!"
"0","4","Ditto on the 'hard and crumbly' dough. ..and my butter was soft soooo...just use 2 lge eggs instead of 1...i also pushed them down a bit with glass dipped in sugar...the result is wonderful!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I made them as desert 4 Sunday Dinner, kids & adults loved them! I added another tsp vanilla ex & 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Make sure your butter is very, very soft! I baked them 12 mins on 375, foiled cookie sheet. They were soft & perfect size for putting the whole cookie in your mouth if you dunk them in milk & eat the whole thing like I do! Thnx!!!"
"0","2","This is the first time I have made sugar cookies and they came out tasting like flour!!! I can't understand why. I followed the recipe exactly! Even the part about the butter being softened."
"0","1","cookies were so dry and way to small to cook right."
"0","3","Bland cookies, so I doubled the vanilla & added about 1/4 tsp almond extract. The dough was crumbly (my butter was very soft); I compressed it into a roll in plastic wrap."
"0","5","I'm not a big fan of plain old sugar cookies, but these have definitely changed my mind forever!! Absolutely delicious and so easy!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious. (I added a pinch of salt.)"
"0","5","These were great. I added a little orange zest and cooked them a few minutes longer."
"0","4","I added the zest of 1 lemon and it was spectacular."
"0","5","Best recipe for sugar cookies by far."
"0","2","Butter was completely melted and I followed the directions to a tee. Cookies came out flavorless and dry. Maybe I need to lessen the flour or add more vanilla extract. Unfortunately not for me. My husband liked them though!"
"0","5","My batter came out fine. A bit sticky, however, what I did was put flour on my hands and rolled the dough into balls. That took care of the stickyness. My kids said these were by far the best homemade cookies I've made. Going to hold on to this recipe. Thx!"
"0","5","Just made these. Love that the ingredients were things on hand. Took some other advice and melted the butter first so it was soft and put in an extra tsp of vanilla. Love that I didn't have to refrigerate the dough. Came out great. Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","I've been trying sugar cookie recipes for the last 2 months. This is by far the best. I always use butter in my cookies because it tastes the best. I melted mine completely in the microwave and the cookies came out so soft. If you over cook them they become very hard very fast. You have to pull them out right away. This recipe was so easy and so good. I made them plain but I can't wait to try some with candies in them as well. However they are amazing plain made exactly as the recipe says!"
"0","5","I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon of fresh orange zest."
"0","5","Made them twice so far and they are awesome. Everyone loves them! The trick is very soft butter!! Enjoy"
"0","5","Forgot to mention that my cookies did better @ 350."
"0","5","After reading the first comment I know this recipe was GREAT! And it was thank you for sharing yet a wonderful recipe, my wife and kids enjoyed it to the fullest! :)"
"0","5","Very easy and good sugar cookie recipe. I would take out of oven after 8 minutes as well. Those cookies were much softer later than those baked for 10 minutes, which were more crispy."
"0","5","Tip: mix dry ingredients first with a whisk and then add liquid ingredients. It turned out very dry and I had to use another egg and then the dough was perfect. When I cooked them, they were fabulous! This tip from Oklahoma mother of two! Boomer Sooner ladies, and gents! Happy New Year!"
"0","3","They were alright, a little to hard for my taste!!"
"0","4","I'm not really a sugar cookie person, but I enjoy baking these for family and friends."
"0","3","ACTUALY, thre and a 1/2 . one batch yeilded .35 cookyz. I made them for a moUse party. My second cousin is allergic to flour but he was ok. We used colored suger, It made them look EXTRA-ordinary . I used fun cookie cutters, like butterflys, dinosaurs, firetrucks, the number five, hearts, ducs, shooting star/ A+ medal, etc. The truck didn't turn out very well. I recommmend using about 5and a 1/2 more Eggs, but just the whites and yolks. not the shells. Also, it doesn't tell you this, but you should stir with a spoon, not your hands. I learnd the hard Way-- my first batch came out too lumpie and more was on my HANDs, you know. So, in conclusion, this is a god recipie that makes about 458.59 cookyz. Good for ppl allergic to flour. They dont react."
"0","4","If I didn't alter this recipe by substituting some of the sugar with Truvia, I might have given it 5 stars. The cookies were still good, though."
"0","4","These cookies turned out great, but only after some tweaking of the recipe. After adding and mixing the dry ingredients, the dough became very crumbly - too crumbly to form into balls. I had even done as other reviewers said and made sure my butter was completely softened by letting it sit out for a few hours. I am an amateur baker so I am unsure if my fix was the 'correct' way to do things, but I added some milk a tiny bit at a time until the dough was of a better consistency, and they turned out very well after exactly 8 minutes in the oven. Slightly crisp on the outside, chewy but not gooey on the inside. I made them for Christmas and rolled them in colored sugar before baking."
"0","4","Cook 10 min or less for Chewy. Cook up to 15 for Crispy meltaway texture."
"0","5","I've tried a few different sugar cookie recipes, and this has to be the best one. It's delicious, and the cookies are really soft and melt in your mouth. I think I'll be sticking with this as my go-to sugar cookie recipe!"
"0","5","It was our first time making these and they came out fantastic!!"
"0","5","I used the advice of other reviews - microwaved butter for 35 seconds, added an additional egg & 1/2 tsp vanilla. Dough was very creamy. I just kept stirring. I can see what people were saying about floury dough, but if you keep mixing it gets better. Make 50 or so cookies which we decorated differently. I cooked them for 7 minutes. I made the M&M cookies a bit bigger & inserted the candy with 2 minutes left to cook. Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","Delicious cookies. Mine came out perfect. I make larger cookies, so I cooked each batch for 10 minutes. My batter was very moist. I used margarine and set it on top of the preheated oven to soften it. Great recipe!"
"0","4","Very easy recipe! I did as some others suggested and rolled in sugar. I also baked them on a dark non stick pan so I dropped the temp to 350. Perfect!"
"0","5","I added an extra egg because of my altitude it's just habit but these came out very good now I just need to find a good recipe for icing"
"0","5","The reason the cookies spread so much is because of the amount of sugar. The more sugar you use the more they will spread . The less sugar use the they wont sspread as much so if you want a cookie that doesn't spread as much, instead of putting 1 1/2 c. Sugar use just 1cup. Other than that its a good formula"
"0","5","Loved these!"
"0","5","This by far is one of the best sugar cookie recipes! So easy, all cookies came out perfectly rounded and taste delicious! Id say the best ive ever tasted! Definitely 5 stars!"
"0","5","So yum! Cooked each batch for 7 minutes, they came out perfect - not hard like some cookies tend to come out when cooked too long. Will be making again!"
"0","5","Just made these with my 4 and 6 year old. They are absolutely fabulous! We separated the dough in half - colored half green and half red (used an entire small bottle of food coloring for each half which gave them GREAT color). We then rolled them in white crystal sprinkles and they look pretty! They will be a great addition to our holiday dessert table!"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing!!! love Love LOVE!!!! My husband hates sweets but loved these. The best recipe yet!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and taste great!"
"0","5","Like others have said these cookies are perfect! I am not a big sugar cookie fan but the kids wanted something that had more of a Christmas theme to leave for Santa. I followed the recipe exactly and split the dough in two. Then colored half of it red and half of it green. I then rolled them into balls and rolled them in confectioner's sugar to bake. I did like others suggested and baked them for 8 minutes and they are soft and oh so good!"
"0","5","I just made these tonight and they turned out perfectly. I took the advice of one reviewer and made sure my butter was extremely soft. I used an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract to up the flavor. These are super easy to make and highly addictive. I'll definitely use this recipe again."
"0","4","Very yummy sugar cookie, my dough actually came out fluffy and I was concerned but once they hit the oven and cooled they were soft and sweet :) Definitely add the extra tsp of vanilla."
"0","4","They were yummy! We used real butter and actually rolled them out and cut shapes out it. They turned out great! This has definitely become my favorite sugar cookie recipe."
"0","5","This was recipe is awesome! My 16yr daughter, was like 'mom make sure you save that recipe', she loved it. I had already tried a different sugar cookie recipe before and it was no where near as good as this one!"
"0","3","Actually more of a 3.5. The taste was good, but the dough was VERY dry. My first batch, I rolled out the ball and baked, but it never flattened. The bottom burnt. I think it needs more liquid. I'm going to experiment now..."
"0","5","These cookies were very delicious, and I would recommend this recipe for anyone who likes sugar cookies!"
"0","4","My family and I loved this recipe. I sprinkled some sugar crystals and dots to make them Christmas cookies. The only reason I put 4 stars is because there was a slight alteration to the recipe. I halved all of the ingredients except the egg and vanilla. The flavor was delightful! Will use again!"
"0","5","I loved it, I made some and they turned out WONDERFUL. Im totally making Santas cookies with my kids with this Recipe. The best yet."
"0","5","I thought this was an excellent recipe and it yielded delicious cookies! I added a little more vanilla extract."
"0","5","I give this recipe 5 stars. I am gluten free, so I added a little less than 1/4th cup EXTRA gf flour per cup of flour. You can add a few drops of water to get the consistency right. I also add 1/2 tsp almond extract on top of the vanilla extract, to the recipe because I like the almond taste. When gf, you add around 3/4 tsp. xanthan gum for each cup of flour for elasticity. Great recipe!!"
"0","5","#1 sugar cookie recipie ever! best advice is to pre-heat the oven to 400 ,place cookies in the oven, and immeaditly drop the thermostat to 350. approximately 7 mins will give you chewy cookies and 10 will give you crunchy. i add chocolate blue-berrys to the center of the dough balls and they tast like a blue-berry muffin cookie!!!"
"0","4","Pretty good recipe for an easy sugar cookie. I followed the recipe exactly since I'm not the best at improvisation and they were okay. You really have to make substitutions with this. With the original recipe, mine took twice as long to bake but they came out nice and fluffy and chewy. It was very light and airy because they practically doubled in size in the oven. The flavor wasn't so great though. I thought it would be much sweeter than this, so next time i'll add another tsp of vanilla or something. Pretty good recipe overall."
"0","2","The dough was kind of dry. So it fell apart as I placed it on the pan. It d didn't expand when baked. Maybe I should have shortening instead of butter. It was edible but an ugly cookie."
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe it is never wasted any super easy to do with little ones. However I tried several time with several batches and they are simply too soft (even after chilling for several hours) to shape. But will use this recipe a million times I love it as does everyone I made them for!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice now, both turning out terrific! They stay soft and moist after they cool, and they taste fantastic! They are not too rich or sugary. This will be my sugar cookie recipe that I use from now on!! :)"
"0","4","It was a good recipe, I just had to add one extra egg so they wouldn't be so dry."
"0","4","Couldn't pick a better recipe to try for the first time making Sugar Cookies.. Loved it... thanks..."
"0","5","I needed something for my daughter's class Christmas party. I used this recipe and followed the recommendation of another user and used 2tsp of vanilla and margarine. These were ssoooo much better than store bought sugar cookies. I will absolutely use this recipe again. This was also my very first time making cookies from scratch and I must say it was a VERY pleasant experience for a first timer like myself :-)"
"0","5","Excellent! I used this mix to make both sugar cookies and chocolate chip cookies. The kids and my husband enjoyed them."
"0","5","Quick, easy and pretty tasty. Great as a base to add other things such as toasted almonds or chocolate candies."
"0","4","These WERE easy. Nice and chewy the first day, but they get too crunchy by the second."
"0","5","I love this recipe! It's very simple to make, no refrigeration needed (yay!), and it's easy to adapt if you like to experiment, like I do. I've substituted peppermint extract and added crushed candy canes. (Add a little extra peppermint extract.) They're also awesome with almond extract instead of vanilla. We made a batch and they were gone the next day. Yummy!"
"0","1","I made the dough to a tee 2 days before I needed 6 dozen sugar cookies and then I let it sit out of frig for about 10-15 mins before rolling the dough in to about 1.5 tsp balls. the cookies came out super flat and looked and tasted like fried butter didn't have a sugar cookie taste at all. I was too embarrassed to use them so had to start over with a different recipe :("
"0","5","I thought these cookies were easy and delicious! I did make an error when baking and only added 1/2c butter but they turned out like a shortbread cookie and everyone raved about them. The surprising comment was that they were not too sugary as some can be. Will be making the modified version again and again."
"0","3","the dough was not very soft and cookies turned out very hard. this was after i adjusted the temp to 350. next time i will try using completely softened butter as one reviewer mentioned and perhaps margarine??"
"0","4","Perfect cookie dough for my cookie shooter. My oven temp required them to bake for 13 min. Delish!"
"0","4","This was a good base recipe but definitely needed to be added upon. I added a teaspoon of mint extract and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix then rolled rounded balls in granulated sugar. They came out great! I, however, would not have enjoyed them as the recipe was written...a little dry...but overall, as I said, a great base for additional ingredients. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","(UPDATE!! I originally rated this recipe a 5 but unfortunatly 30 min after my cookies had cooled they did turn hard as other reviewers complained about :( They still are a very Buttery Delicious cookie just kind of hard they would be good with a cup of coffee or tea . These cookies are truly AMAZING!!! Perfect! crispy around the edged chewy in the middle!! I dont even care for sugar cookies and iv eaten two! I did melt my butter to ensure they would come out chewy and not cakey,and I added a 1/2 a box of cheesecake dry pudding mix! We have a keeper!!!"
"0","5","I just made these with my 3 year old son they are so good . I did modify the recipe a bit I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I also melted the butter to make sure the cookies would stay soft. We love them this is a nice starter recipe I'm already thinking of what I can add to the leftover batter."
"0","3","it just wasn't that good for me. My cookies came out really hard and were not that tasteful. However, the butter wasn't softened, so I put it in the microwave for a little bit. That might have affected the consistency of it a little bit."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly, and I never had better sugar cookies!"
"0","5","The only thing that I didn’t like about this recipe was that I had to add another egg because the batter was starting to come out dry. Any cookie recipe I’ve ever used always called for two large eggs, not just one. This is the second recipe this week that I had to adjust and add another egg instead of just the one that these dry recipes call for.  I always use salted butter due to the fact that I never add actual salt to anything that I bake. Every other ingredient I followed exactly. I did have to shorten the baking time. First, I did 6 minutes. They came out really good, the only flaw was that the bottoms were a little on the crunchy side. Therefore, I adjusted them to 5 minutes and they came out perfect! They’re just sweet enough to satisfy and they have that delicious buttery taste that I love! Hence why I use butter! Well, aside from that one soy allergy I have."
"0","5","We just finished making 10 dozen cookies with this recipe. They turned out GREAT! I use margarine straight from the fridge in lieu of butter and it was neither dry nor crumbly. We even had a two year old helping....I know from past experiences (and other recipes) if you add your dry ingredients too fast the dry crumblies can happen...maybe that was an issue? Anyway 8 minutes is PERFECT for soft cookie results."
"0","5","Made these tonight. Great simple recipe; however, dough was far too dry so added 2nd egg and dough was perfect as were baked cookies. Gave 5 star even with the change as will use again I'm sure."
"0","1","I followed the recipe to the T! Even creamed the butter and sugar until almost fluffy. 375 degrees and at minute 6 in the oven, the whole place started smoking and the bottoms of the cookies were black and burned!"
"0","5","Made it per the recipe and baked at both 8 and 9 minutes. 8 minutes felt a bit undercooked. 9 minutes was perfect. Very much dependent on your oven and preference - so I suggest doing a small test batch. You'll have to let it cool to get a good read of the finished texture though."
"0","1","I PUT THIS IN THE OVEN AND A BRICK CAME OUT. THE BRICK WAS NOT EVEN TASTY!"
"0","5","omgoogle i was looking for a recipe for tonight and this one popped out im gonna try this one! by the pic i think there gonna be good unless i let them burn i almost always forget about my cookies in the oven and they burn:("
"0","5","Easy, tasty, and versatile. Also a good recipe to work on with kids because the dough is very easy to handle."
"0","5","Just what my husband had in mind. I flat sugar cookie that is chewy with a crunchy edge."
"0","5","This was so easy and tasty! I frosted them and everyone loved them! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Super simple & tasty. I used 1 & 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp almond extract. Then used 2 tsp of the batter per cookie. Bake for only 8 minutes. Sprinkled with colored sugar. PERFECT! ~ ttoberle ~"
"0","5","The completely softened butter is the trick for these cookies. They were so delicious that my kids were begging for me to make more."
"0","5","it is so delish and fast to make when unexspected guest arrives at christmas time ty"
"0","5","These are simple & easy to make. I'm not a sugar cookie fan but found these to be addicting with coffee!"
"0","5","Great recipe, VERY easy. Great to make with kids. I've made these several times and it's true the batter is crumbly, when I find it's too dry or crumbly, I just add in about a tsp of veg. oil... No problem. Other times it's been fine. It will be very pale or just barely tan when done. Very tasty!"
"0","4","I think these cookies are very easy too make. they are also very yummy next time i make them i'm going to add other ingredients!!!!!"
"0","5","I LOVE THIS RECIPE. So good and soft. Made with the kids and they had fun. Then Had people over and everyone loved them and now they want me to make them a batch :)"
"0","3","This probably would have rocked if I was a good baker (lol) but somehow I messed up sugar cookies. I don't know what went wrong, but when they came out of the oven, they were ball-shaped still! Can anyone tell me how to fix this?"
"0","4","Great for beginners but slightly lacking in taste.. I noticed the recipe didn't call for any salt so I followed it as written. They baked beautifully (10 mins) , crispy on the edge, soft on the inside. My only complaint was I could taste the lack of salt. After the second batch came out , I sprinkled some with kosher salt....PERFECT! I will experiment with the salt the next time I make them."
"0","2","Followed the recipe exactly. Maybe it was too cold in my kitchen but the batter was very dry and crumbly, and the balls didn't flatten out in the oven. They taste okay though. I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe."
"0","5","These are perfect!"
"0","5","i love this reciepe it is so delicoius since i invented it ur welcome"
"0","2","eh,I've had better. They are tasty, but a little too crisp. I was looking for sugar cookies that were soft and pillow-y. These definitely missed that mark!"
"0","5","I tried this recipie not knowing what was going to come out this is an amazing recipie I loved this and so did my all of my family, thin and crispy just how we like them AMAZING COOKIES!!!! Although I would suggest a small little extra dash of vanilla and cook it for 9 minutes oh and instead of using baking powder and soda just use all poupose flour I think it tastes better like that and they are a little better with the butter melted completely and a little burnt"
"0","5","Great sugar cookie recipe!!! Only cook 8 minutes as suggested by other users unless you like them crispy...if you have a newer oven or a one that typically over cooks I would only do 7.  I would also add a little more vanilla extra and put in the refrigerator for literally maybe 10 or 15 minutes..just helps the cookies ball up a little easier, oh and roll them in sugar for an extra yummy touch."
"0","5","I'm make n these tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow...Wish me luck !"
"0","5","This is perfect especially for me as a first time mom trying to spend some bonding time with the baby."
"0","5","My family loves this recipe. I will use this one for ever !!!!!"
"0","3","These cookies taste good, but my dough it always crumbly; which makes it hard to form. I had read a review that stated butter must be extremely soft and my butter has been very soft both times I've tried this recipe; and I follow the recipe to a tee. I don't think I'll be making this sugar cookie recipe again; I think I'll look for something a little better."
"0","5","Simple and wonderful, I will be making these again soon!!"
"0","4","The flavor is excellent, but we found that when using cookie cutters, the dough did not exactly retain its shape."
"0","5","Omg the best sugar cookie hands down! So easy and great fun for my 4 year old"
"0","5","So totally buttery and delicious... I can't wait to show these puppies off! I halved the recipe, but added the whole egg. Followed everything else exactly. The result was a crispy outside, soft inside sugar cookie that I will be making again and again! I frosted them with the 'Simple and Delicious Buttercream Frosting' from this site, decorated them for the season, and they turned out bakery quality!"
"0","5","My daughter and I were looking for something sweet to eat when we found this recipe. These cookies tuned out wonderful!!! I didnt have any baking powder nor the substitutes for it and it was snowing outside so I put a pinch extra baking soda and a little salt and BEST SUGAR COOKIES I EVER HAD! So light and buttery! I will be making lots more for Christmas!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and so yummy!! My husband and daughter loved them!"
"0","5","This recipe gave me childhood memories of my dad and I making sugar cookies over the holidays!! It was delicious!! Mine was actually perfect at 10 min! Yum!!! This sugar cookie recipe is a keeper! Thank you! :)"
"0","5","Very easy to make and we have made it several times since. WE LOVED IT!!!"
"0","5","BEST SUGAR COOKIE EVER! And very easy!"
"0","4","I have made this recipe twice, and I completely agree with one reviewer who said that the secret is the butter. If you want this recipe to turn out right, you have to make sure the butter is completely soft...if it isn't, the dough will be very dry. The first time I made these cookies, I had completely softened the butter on the counter, but the second time the butter wasn't completely soft, and the dough became VERY crumbly. The cookies still taste good, but the consistency of the dough makes it challenging if the butter isn't soft enough, especially if you're going to roll the dough balls in sugar. Also, to add to the flavor, I used the one teaspoon of vanilla, per the recipe, but also added about 3/4 teaspoon of orange extract. It really brings out the flavor of any sugar cookie recipe. Overall, this is a great basic sugar cookie recipe - not too sweet, not too buttery, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I will definitely be coming back to this recipe!"
"0","4","These were really good! I've been looking for a good, basic sugar cookie and I think I found it. The only change I made was to use 1 tsp more vanilla and I'm very glad I did. The taste was perfect. The only thing I'll change next time is to make the cookies bigger (they were super tiny) and maybe I'll chill the dough or cook them less because I like my sugar cookies chewy but these came out crispy. Other than them being too small and crunchy, they were perfect. Definitely my new sugar cookie recipe!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Thank you! Just made these today. Added an extra egg and an extra tsp vanilla and a dash of salt after reading the suggestions. Those that say this didn't work, didn't follow the recipe. Baking is an exact science. These rolled into balls perfectly, 8 mins was perfect, tasted great! Easy peasy!"
"0","5","easy and delicious"
"0","5","These are the best and easiest sugar cookies i've made i have a picky family and they went over wonderfully"
"0","5","Great cookies! I am not much of a baker and they turned out great! Very easy to make as well!!"
"0","5","I really did love this recipe. It was my first time making it and the dough turned out crumbly. What I did, for those who face the same problem, was I added some milk and mixed it in with my hands (the spoon was useless, at this point). They turned out great! I will most definitely use this recipe again, sometime."
"0","5","My daughter and her friend made these last night using Namaste Perfect Blend Gluten Free flour. Didn't change anything else. Delicious, and easy to make. Will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","5 stars because they were quick, easy and delicious. I'm not a pro so I'm quite proud of these. I feel like I've done something fantastic. Will definitely use this again."
"0","5","Just made these loved them. Quick easy and taste great didn't have any problems with the dough followed the recipe as it reads. I will be making these again"
"0","2","I think I'm a pretty experienced baker, and I followed this recipe exactly as stated. I was very disappointed in with the results. The dough was nothing but a pile of crumbs, and I thought that once balled they might flatten out in the oven. I was wrong. I ended up with lifeless piles of dough. Sad!"
"0","2","The 'batter' was crumbly, the cookies were hard and they didn't flatten like the picture shows. They were too hard to eat the outsides of them BUT the middle actually tasted pretty good! I probably won't try this one again."
"0","4","something went wrong they came out looking like bread but they still taste great."
"0","4","Kind of thin, but super chewy and good. Made them for YMCA Halloween party."
"0","5","All I did was add pumpkin spice to the mix about 1/2 tsp. Also I rolled my small ice cream scoop balls in sugar before placing on the cookie sheet. They came out so perfect, soft and yummy!!"
"0","5","These sugar cookies are great! I make them all the time and am constantly asked to make them for people. Suggestion, though. The cookies do NOT need to come out golden brown. That will make them too hard. Set the oven to 355 or 360 depending on your preference and set the timer to 12 min. This will make them very soft when they come out, so don't touch them until they cooled. I recommend taking them off the pan with the cookie sheet and letting them cool until hardened. That way the cookies will be hard on the edges and outside, but soft on the inside. I also add a tablespoon of vanilla or more for that extra flavor. Oh, and the reviews are right. The butter needs to be COMPLETELY MELTED for this recipe to work.   Hope I helped!"
"0","5","My family loves these sugar cookies! I sprinkle cinnamon over the top just before baking. Sooooo yummy!"
"0","4","Easy recipe, delious cookies. I had the butter at room temperature like other suggested, BUT still found that the dough was super dry and crumbly. I added in an extra egg & 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and it got a bit more manageable. I think it may not need the vegetable oil, but next time I'm gona try making it with an extra egg. Also, it's much more delicious if you add in lemon zest! We added 1 lemon worth, but next time we'll do 2 lemons because we loved having the lemon in there! :D"
"0","4","This recipe is so good ...the cookies came out great but when making the cookies remember the butter needs to be really soft if not the dough will get clumpy ..other then that the cookies come out great :)"
"0","5","I made this recipe as written. As I was taking the cookies out of the oven, they were vanishing as fast as I was taking them off the cookie sheets. I ended up making a second batch. I did put 2 tsps of vanilla extract in the first batch. I like strong flavor. The second batch I used Lemmon extract and Lemmon zest. Turned out with a faint Lemmon flavor. Thanh you for a very versatile recipe. I can see endless possible options."
"0","4","the cookies had a nice texture and were very yummy, but quite sweet, I wouldn't recommend putting so much sugar."
"0","5","Pull em right at 8 mins.. make sure butter is room temp so dough binds and isn't crumbly. I omitted the baking powder too. Tasted as good if not better than Subway™ sugar cookies. No joke!!!! Enjoy"
"0","5","This recipe was delicious! I read the reviews and added an extra egg and(accidentally)completely melted the butter. It turned out amazing!!!!!"
"0","5","I liked the idea that I did not have to refrigerate the dough because I decided on a whim to make cookies and wanted it to be a quick process. I softened the butter in the microwave (on very low power for 30 seconds at a time until it was very soft but not melted). These came out great. I rolled them into balls and some I pressed into colored sugar before placing on the baking sheet and others I left plain. They were very good. I don't know why anyone would have trouble with this recipe."
"0","5","Love this recipe. Regarding other review comments: Agree that a tad more vanilla is warranted; baking time of 10 minutes, not 8, is right; don't wait for golden brown, just bake 10 minutes. If cookies get hard, put a small piece of wet paper towel on wax paper in the cookie tin for a few hours. I especially liked that there's no refrigerating of the dough."
"0","5","loved this recipe will be making again"
"0","5","best yet"
"0","5","yummy, soft and chewy!! I added sugar to the top once rounded on baking sheet"
"0","5","They came out great at 8 minutes. They were perfect and didn't spread out much at all. I used a tablespoon to measure them out and came up with 51 round cookies. This will be my sugar cookie recipe from now on."
"0","5","I found my new sugar cookie recipe. Wow, these are moist, slightly crunchy and it reminds me of a Snickerdoodle. Thanks for the recipe. I will be sharing. :)"
"0","5","This is a really great sugar cookie recipe. So simple yet delicious! The family was eating them as quickly as I was baking them!"
"0","5","Let me start by saying I have NEVER made anything from scratch, much less cookies. These turned out great! My fiancé devoured them!"
"0","4","This is a pretty good recipe!"
"0","4","These are definitely one of the better cookie recipes I've tried. I love a good sugar cookie, these came out soft and sweet, but not too sweet. My boyfriend thought they were too plain, but i don't think he's a big fan of sugar cookies."
"0","4","Easy, fast and yummy! Great recipe! I did have to adjust the time a little. I set my gas stove to 375F like specified, but if I left them in for more than 7 minutes they would burn the bottom. Once I changed the cook time they were amazing!!"
"0","5","My girls love this cookie. They love mixing up batches & putting little candies or other little touches into then. It's my go to recipe."
"0","5","Super easy & tasty! I was looking for a recipe to swap ingredients to make gluten-free and these still turned out great with a g-f flour blend! Kids got to decorate & loved them!"
"0","4","Nice!"
"0","5","Amazing sugar cookie! My alteration was + 1 egg yolk in addition to the egg (by accident. I kept to the tips of keeping the cookie about a tbsp size, flattened them with a fork, then dipped the top in sugar. My oven runs high so I set the temp. at 350 and after 12 minutes these were PERFECT. Used tons of sugar cookie recipes and this is by far the best!!"
"0","2","They taste like peanutbutter and they are not that wow, but they are okay..."
"0","5","I made these cookies the day of the bracelet party. I didn't eat one to see how it turned out because I ate a little it of the cookie dough and if the cookie dough is good then the cookie itself after it's done baking will turn out PERFECT!! And when I brought it for people to try. It was a HIT!!!!! Every loved it...And I was proud of myself because in all honesty I'm not much of a baker and I'm proud of myself that I did this cookie justice!!!! I'm SO happy that I found this cookie recipe and I can't WAIT to make it again real soon!!!! And by the way, if you're a chocolate lover like I am. I poured some Hershey's unsweetened coco powder on the cookie dough and kneed it into the dough really well to tweak it up a bit and make it chocolately and it turned out even MORE delicious!!!! :D To the person who created this recipe...AMAZING!!!!!!!! :)"
"0","5","I just made these and they turned out great - has anyone frozen them? I need some for a class trip and would like to freeze them ahead of time....I didn't change anything other than I needed larger ones for kids to decorate, so I made them larger and used a cup to flatten out the dough - it worked perfect!"
"0","5","I would have added a photo but I ate them all, lol. This is a good balance of ingredients for sugar cookies. I was able to make healthy substitutes for this recipe. I used organic whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and I used organic evaporated cane sugar instead of fine processed white sugar. The cookies turned out delicious still following the recipes exact measurements. Thank you!"
"0","5","I've never made sugar cookies so I wanted to try some recipes and this was by far the best! Their amazing! I loved them and so did my nephew and family."
"0","5","I had a friend and her granddaughter over and tried this easy recipe. I adore vanilla and am not such a fan of chocolate... This is the BEST sugar cookie ever, and so easy! I love the fact that they come out so uniformly! Like another reviewer said 9 minutes, and I did leave the cookies on the sheet for 2 minutes. This is a keeper I will use for Christmas and other events! Thank you so MUCH!"
"0","4","I wanted to make something like snickerdoodles so I substituted the sugar for a cinnamon sugar mixture (1part cinn, 3 parts sugar). Everyone who's tried em loves em!"
"0","5","ONE CUP OF BUTTER = TWO STICKS I guarantee that the people who rate this low and complain that the dough is 'crumbly and unusable' have been adding one stick or 1/2cup butter. I made the same mistake the first time I made these, and almost had the same problem.  So people: be sure to add TWO STICKS of butter, 1 full cup, and these cookies will be the best you've ever had."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Quick, easy & absolutely the best sugar cookies I've ever made...."
"0","4","Super good and so easy. I completely melted the butter it was easier to mix that way."
"0","5","My entire family loved these cookies! I did change my cooking temp to 350° for 8 min though because my husband likes them soft."
"0","4","Everyone in my house ate these cookies like they were going out of style! I baked the batches of cookies for 7 min, as our stove gets very hot very quickly and 8 min was burning making the cookies more crunchy than I liked. Very good, and super easy!"
"0","4","Yummy cookies. They don't actually make 4 dozen though. We got about 33. Don't let them brown too much."
"0","4","I really enjoyed making this recipe and I feel like for m first time it was an okay batch. Next time i know it will be even better, but they came out pretty good. :)"
"0","5","easy and yummy"
"0","5","about a 1/4 cup more flour and very soft butter produced a nice soft cookie with just enough flavor."
"0","5","Amazing recipe. You can make it soft and chewy or crispy. For some odd reason I got 83 regular sized cookies. Maybe my scoops were not as large, but I don't mind since I like my cookies crunchy.   Will definitely try again and again.   So much cheaper (and healthier) than packaged snacks at the grocery store!"
"0","4","I really liked this recipe and so did my family! My only thing was I added another teaspoon of vanilla extract for more flavor. Really make sure the butter is mushy (I microwaved mine for a few seconds). This recipe worked great and gives you delicious quick sugar cookies!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I quartered the recipe and just made a dozen. It was very quick and they were great. Nice light dessert for family of four. Like the other lady said though, the secret is in the 'softened' butter. Make sure you don't melt the butter; just soften slightly."
"0","5","I love these cookies!!! I believe these are the potato chips of cookies, just can't stop at one! I was in the mood for something sweet one night and wanted to use what I had in the kitchen. I came across this recipe and was very pleased. My husband isn't a big fan of sugar cookies, but when he tried these he loved them. We usually have all 4 dozen eaten in 2 days. They are not too sweet and the texture is great. I would highly recommend these! Thanks for a great recipe! :-)"
"0","5","This was DELICIOUS! Though I'm not sure if this happened to anyone else, the cookies weren't very good for the first day. After it sat overnight in an airtight container, the next day the cookies were heavenly! I couldn't stop myself from eating them. Even my sister, who is extremely critical of everything I do, couldn't help herself from eating over HALF of them! Highly highly recommend this recipe. It's easy, and delicious!"
"0","5","Delicious cookies!! I completely melted the butter..."
"0","5","Excellent! Made as is. It's really good and really easy!"
"0","5","This has become my go-to sugar cookie recipe. Fantastic! A few notes from my kitchen:  - as others have noted, make sure the butter is quite soft - if using unsalted butter, add 1/2 tsp salt to the dry ingredients - use the fluff/sprinkle/scrape method to measure your flour precisely - roll balls of dough in granulated sugar before baking - follow the baking and cooling directions exactly - optional: add grated zest of 1 lemon with the egg and vanilla."
"0","5","Super easy and yummy. Stick to the 8min and you won't go wrong."
"0","5","Every cookie came out perfect. I took them out when the bottoms appeared to be just beginning to brown and they set perfectly on the pan before racking them. I'm lazy and hate to stir, so I used the hand mixer for the whole thing, highest for the beginning, lowest for the end. I also baked them on a day with 100% humidity. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Omg I love them there sosososososososososo good"
"0","4","Very simple and yummy!"
"0","5","Deserves 10 stars!"
"0","5","These are great sugar cookies!! No need to change a thing. I even used whole wheat flour for 1/2 the flour called for and still awesome! About a previous review...slightly softened butter works great but you need to make sure to cream it (make fluffy) with the sugar....if it's mush..defeats the purpose of creaming it with the sugar."
"0","5","This was my first foray into baking ANYTHING from 'scratch' and I found this recipe easy to follow. I was glad I took a look at other comments before starting. A few things I found out:   1) I don't have a hand mixer, just a fork, so the actual prep time was more like 25 minutes due to stirring requirements and a lack of experience  2) Leaving the butter out on the counter for 2 hours did get it to a great mixing temperature  3) I also took my egg out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature along with the butter, doesn't seem to have caused any issues, and everything mixed really well  4) Rolling the balls of dough in sugar made for extremely sweet cookies...would probably cut back on the sugar in the mix next time  5) 8 minutes of baking produced perfect cookies, just like others have suggested  6) Using a spoonful of dough for each cookie produced around 60 cookies, not 48  7) 18 cookies per cookie sheet allowed for spreading without having the cookies touch/fall off the side  8) Glad I made the decision to lightly spray the cookie sheets with cooking oil (butter flavored), as all the cookies came off the cookie sheets with no leavings/breaks"
"0","5","Delicious, homemade cookies with ingredients already on hand. Everybody (grownups and kids) loved these!"
"0","3","It was okay, a very easy recipe that satisfies a sweet tooth. A bit dry though."
"0","2","I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out hard as a rock and really small. We had a cookie giveaway last night and no one even TOUCHED those cookies. I can't blame them. And now I have upwards of 8 dozen (my batter made a lot) cookies to get rid of. They taste edible, a little plain, but otherwise it was not good at all"
"0","5","Love love, love, these cookies. They are soft and buttery, and every one who tries them loves them."
"0","5","my cookies came out delicious. made sure to follow other raters instructions and have the butter be very soft and only bake for 8 minutes."
"0","3","Eh. I made these because we wanted cookies and I had these ingredients in the cabinet. The dough was very dry, and the overall product is just okay."
"0","5","These are great! I made a half batch and they turned out light and airy with just the right amount of crunch. I added two teaspoons of vanilla for extra flavor. This is definitely my go-to sugar cookie recipe from now on."
"0","5","Great recipe....added an extra egg...a bit of salt...doubled vanilla....baked for 8 min & they came out perfect crispy. :). Did four varieties & they all came out great. Did some plain, some with lemon glaze on top, snicker doodle, and some with toffee and walnuts mixed in. Great tasting & easy to make."
"0","4","These cookies aren't the best sugar cookies I've ever had but they are the best I've made! For people that are saying the batter is to hard you probably didn't get the butter soft enough. Also, once you add the dry mix to the butter, eggs, vanilla, and sugar it should not be sticky at all."
"0","5","We all loved this recipe!We cut everything in half because it was to much(we probably could have eaten that much anyway).There were not any leftovers afterwards :-)"
"0","5","Turned out soft and chewy even after they fully cooled! I have always wanted to make these kinds of sugar cookies but since now, they have turned out not so good. I will use this again!"
"0","5","Love these cookies! They are easy and quick!"
"0","2","Have made these 2 or 3 times thinking maybe we were doing something wrong. We just did not like these cookies."
"0","4","I attempted to make these yesterday - and failed. probably because i didn't have enough ingredients and had to cut the recipe down. I went to the store last night and got enough and tried it again! the first batch came out hard, and nasty. So i went back to the remaining in the bowl, added about five tablespoons more of sugar, and some cinnamon. When the cookies were on the pan, i sprinkled some more sugar on top of them. that made a HUGE difference. They are so light and yummy. i will be doing this again :)"
"0","4","After reading the reviews and suggestions, I came up with my variation. I used 2 1/2 cups flour, added an extra egg yolk and a 1/4 cup brown  sugar for chewiness. I did leave my butter and eggs to room temp. I also added an extra tsp vanilla.  I did make Lemon sugar cookies using 1 tsp grated lemon peel and 2 tsps lemon instead of vanilla. Yummy."
"0","5","these were AMAZING!! after reading the other reviews, i made sure the butter was realllyyyy soft. also, i added 1/2tsp salt, an extra 1/2tsp of vanilla and the juice of half a lemon. after rolling about 1tbs of dough into little balls, i used the bottom of a glass to smoosh them a little bit before putting them in the oven. i took them out right at 9minutes and after they cooled they were perfectly crisp around the edges and soft in the center. yum!!!"
"0","5","I love this recipe so much!! The cookies came out so good! The recipe is easy and so great! Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","5","The hubby loves these!"
"0","5","This is the best but if u really want this to be a sugar cookie get half a cup of sugar and roll out the cookie dough balls into the sugar this will give it a nice sugary crust trust me this wont let you down enjoy!!"
"0","5","I made these cookies for my photography class and they devoured them then asked me to make more. Great recipe."
"0","4","I should have done what I USUALLY do with sugar cookie dough, which is chill it for a day or at the very least a few hours in the fridge before rolling out and using. The cookies bloated up twice their size!! Its possible the cookie cutters I used were far too large and had too many awkward angles. Regardless, the taste can't be beat...I wouldn't substitute the butter with margarine or any other type of oil created in a lab like some posters did."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! Although it says to back for 10 minutes, I would go for about 8. This way the cookies don't harden after coming out of the oven. Also, when I make sugar cookies, I usually roll them quickly in some sugar in a bowl. This adds to the taste and sweetness. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","Simple and delicious. This is my new go-to recipe for sugar cookies."
"0","4","I just tried these cookies, and just note I am not a baker at all. Every time I try to make something, they always come out way too foury and dry. I tried these and I was very nervous about messing them up. I made the balls a little too big, so I had to leave them in longer than was called for, but they really did come out very well. The only thing is that they could be a tad bit sweeter (I have a serious sweet tooth), but other than that, they were pretty good. Quick and easy! I followed it to the exact measurements and what I was suppose to do. Definitely going to be making these again!"
"0","4","Tried it before, had to come back and find it again. Yum. I made sure to add it to my recipe box this time. Very simple, tastes the way a sugar cookie should, no need to refrigerate. My daughter loves it."
"0","4","pretty alright needs something to add a bit more flavor"
"0","5","Very easy and very good! I doubled the vanilla extract, and added a little extra sugar as well. I rolled some of them in bright orange sugar crystals before putting them in the oven. The whole family liked them."
"0","5","as a child baking these cookies, I really think these are the best cookies I hope I wont get on SUGAR RUSH I want more of these recipes !"
"0","3","Very crumbly! I followed the recipe to the letter and it definitely didn't turn out properly. I measured exactly, I used margerine and let it sit out for hours. There is no way this recipe deserves 5 stars if you need to use less flour and add an extra egg. I have a snickerdoodle recipe that is almost exactly the same, I think I'll stick with that one. Also, there are pictures of cut out cookies. Who could possibly have done cut outs with this recipe?! You would have to change a lot before rolling and cutting this dough would be possible."
"0","3","I followed this to a t and they came out hard as a rock. Maybe they needed extra tweaking."
"0","5","quick and very good."
"0","5","thank you for the great recipe"
"0","5","Great recipe andbeasy to follow. They came out perfect crunchy on the outside and softy in the inside."
"0","2","They never turned round they just baked as lumps, didn't expand much and the ones that did expand because I made them bigger were hard as a rock. The batter was crumbly which I guess is supposed to happen?"
"0","1","Too crumbly and had to add sour cream AND cream of tartar! Easy but not preffered."
"0","4","This is a great sugar cookie recipe for drop cookies, not cut out cookies. I had to add a little water to the finished batter to get the right consistency. I used rounded teaspoons instead of tablespoons to stretch the recipe further. Also, dipped the end of a glass in water and sugar and pressed these a little before cooking, for a shiny sugar topping and rounder cookie. Turned out really good!"
"0","5","This recipe is perfect, easy, awesome. If you want softer ones, just take them out earlier, of course. Awesome recipe, thankyou. I'll definitely use this again."
"0","5","I really liked this recipe. I make many different edibles for my cancer patients, and adding a dose of R.S.O. to each cookie hides the flavor of the medicine and medicates my patients at the same time! I will continue to use this cookie for my patients!"
"0","5","My 12 year old pulled up this recipe and made them all by herself.... YUMMY! Soft and chewy... delightful surprise to come home to."
"0","5","these are the BEST easiest sugar cookies ever!! I cannot stand rolling out cookies so these work wonderful for me! Be sure your butter is super soft and be sure to mix WELL! I have made these with all different flavorings-vanilla, almond, lemon-turns out wonderful each way. I use a small cookie scoop and drop in a bowl with granulated sugar. I place the cookie balls on the sheets and flatten just slightly with the bottom of a glass. Do not overbake! These are delicious! I make these about once every two weeks. Awesome, easy recipe! Thanks!"
"0","4","These turned out fabulous! I microwaved my sticks of butter (which had just come out of the fridge)for 12 seconds to soften them. They turned out slightly crunchy on the outside with a soft, chewier middle - perfect! My only disappointment was that they weren't SUPER flavorful; maybe next time I might add more vanilla or a little salt to enhance the flavors. Great recipe!"
"0","5","awesome tastes awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","2","The cookies were rock hard! Someone had said that the butter needed to be softened, but that definitely wasn't the case here. My butter was soft, and the cookies still turned out hard."
"0","5","These really are incredible. I thought the other reviewers were insane raving about them like they were but ohmygoodness, they are every bit of perfect as they are made out to be. You could easily add lemon or almond extract for extra zing. I did add about 1.5 tsp of vanilla and cooked them exactly 8.5 min. Even my toddler who hates sweets, love these, which is a nice change from the 'tastes like poop' face I always get. This is a keeper."
"0","1","OMG!! Don't waste you're time on these! If there was a -10 that would be my choice. Sorry..."
"0","5","OMG!! This recipe made the best sugar cookies I have ever had. I was on the search for something my daughter whom is lactose intolerant could have. They were not hard to make at all. They are wonderful!"
"0","3","Grease your baking sheet!!!!! The cookies were pretty good, but hard to get off the sheet."
"0","2","It tasted pretty good but it was EXTREMELY crumbley and no matter what I did It wouldn't become the texture I needed.. kinda disappointed"
"0","5","I made these for the 1st time & EVERYONE LOVED them!! I am so happy to find an easy but delicious sugar cookie. Best sugar cookie I have ever made by far!"
"0","5","My husband and I just made these cookies for my nieces high school graduation party, they are amazing. The recipe was so simple, follow the recipe exactly and they come out amazing. I added a little sugar / cinnamon to the top half way through the baking process and it added a little extra flavor. My husband says, no more store bought cookies!!!!!!!"
"0","2","I followed the recipe exactly, using softened butter. Added 2 tsp vanilla. The batter was fluffy at first. I refrigerated it in between. At 8 minutes they were puffed up and just golden around the edges when I pulled them out. They fell flat and thin, and were hard as rocks. They had a nice flavor, but it was more like a sand tart without the spice. Not going to waste the ingredients to try this one again."
"0","5","This has to be the easiest and my go to sugar cookie recipe.... Love, love, love it.  I make it in advance and wrap in plastic wrap and place in the freezer until the time I need it. Then I just cut off in small portions and roll in balls and then roll in colored sugar and bake.. Yummy. I do add some almond extract in with the vanilla and it gives it a great taste."
"0","5","This is one of the best sugar cookie recipes i have ever tried out! They are really yummy! They taste a little more like a shortbread than a cookie but they are still awesome!"
"0","5","So glad I tried these! Turned out perfect. Soft, tasty and so easy to make."
"0","5","I just made these cookies and they were excellent. I will be using this recipe again."
"0","3","Before making these cookies I read some reviews just in case anyone did theirs a bit differently. Followed the instructions exactly except instead of adding only 1 tsp. of vanilla, I added 2. I made them into 1 tsp. balls and put them in the oven without flattening them. They came out exactly at 8 minutes halfway puffy. It was fully cooked, but they were so TINY I thought they would of expanded more.   As for the taste, it still seemed pretty bland to me even with the added tsp of vanilla."
"0","5","it was very good and tastefull~! , i recommend adding more vanilla , about 1 tsp. The butter should be very bland. I thought this was a very good recipe , oh though i think i screwed up somewhere with the flour , i believe i added a bit too much. They came out like a sponegy-like cookie. I recommend and will make some more in the future"
"0","5","I followed previous reviewers suggestions and let the butter get really soft and stuck to the exact 8 min rule. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla for a little extra flavor. I loved them! So did my husband. I'm usually a mix girl. I never think of making cookies. We don't keep sweets in the house and if I need to make cookies (like for Christmas or Easter) I buy a mix. With this recipe it made me realize I don't need a mix, I just need a great recipe!!"
"0","5","Add 1 tsp almond extract"
"0","4","These are a good, basic sugar cookie. I took these and baked them in a mini muffin pan for 8-9 minutes. Once cooled I filled them with a mixture of equal parts plain yogurt & peach jam (~1 tsp each) then topped the cookie with homemade whipped cream. (I recommend Alton Brown's whipped cream recipe) Delish!"
"0","5","added 3-4 tablespoons of milk soured with lemon juice"
"0","5","these are so good!!! Very simple to make!!"
"0","5","Excellent as the recipe is written! Fast, easy, and sooo good!"
"0","5","O MY GOSH they are so delicious!!!!!!!"
"0","3","These are what K & Joni made. Good, not great. This really isn't a sugar cookie though. It's a butter cookie."
"0","5","These cookies were perfect! Not too sweet but not bland either and easy to make. I will make them again!"
"0","5","great recipe and so easy! Make sure to whip the butter and I added approximately 2 1/2 tablespoons of sour cream yum!"
"0","5","Wow!!! This is a great sugar cookie!!! I read some of the reviews on the cookie before I tried the recipe. I made sure that the butter was very soft (at room temp) and increased the vanilla to 2 tps. I baked for 8.5 mins and then let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 8 mins before I transfered to cooling rack. They are very soft and taste like I bought them from a bakery. I saved this recipe and will be using it again. Thank you!!!"
"0","4","I made a bunch of these for Valentine's day and put them in little bags inside of tins and passed them out as Valentine's gifts. I did roll them in colored sugar before baking, but everyone loved them! I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","3","These were quite bland and too floury. If you want a soft and fluffy sugar cookie this is it, but it didn't have nearly enough flavor for me and too floury/pastey. I won't make them again."
"0","4","I really enjoy the sugar cookies and I put powder sugar on top to finish it off."
"0","5","I made this recipe with my three and a half year old son the other day. Every single cookie was delicious! They turned out perfect!! I am making another batch when he gets home so we can give them to his teachers tomorrow. I am not a person with skill in the kitchen so this was really fun, easy, and yielded great results!"
"0","5","I add a tsp crm tartar, Yum!"
"0","4","This was a really good recipe. I added coconut flakes and butterscotch chips and they were amazing. Still chewy the next day. :D"
"0","2","It's wonderful when it first pops out of the oven, and it's easy to make. But after it cools, it gets extremely thick and loses most of its good taste."
"0","2","While the taste isn't that off on these, the dough was basically just a bowl of dry crumbles and the cookies got hard really quickly. It was definitely easy, but not at all as good as I thought it would be. Would not make again."
"0","2","Spare yourself the time and trouble and look for another recipie. Even before I began baking these I had the sinking suspicion they were not going to turn out as expected the dough becomes crumbled and the cookies don't bake right And to the person who said the trick is with the butter my butter was as soft as it could be without being melted long story short two thumbs down"
"0","5","OMG, this sugar cookie recipe is delicious! I added one extra egg and the consistency was almost cake-like. I am definitely going to make these cookies again."
"0","5","Delicious!!! Just made these, very easy, no refrigeration, delicious!!!!!"
"0","5","Love love love! I replaced the butter with olive oil to make eating them feel less guilty and they tasted perfect- I don't think it makes any difference in the taste, look, or smell. I didn't have any baking powder so I only used the 1 tsp of baking soda- the cookies look the same as the ones in the pictures.  After my cookies came out, I covered some with peanut butter,vanilla frosting, strawberry jam, or dark chocolate covered blueberries.  Delicious"
"0","5","This is the first time I've made sugar cookies. Promised my 4 year old granddaughter we would make Shamrock cookies. As a novice, I'd say that anyone who thought this recipe did not deserve all 5 stars is far too picky! I even rolled the dough so she could cut them. I will save this recipe for all of the coming holidays when she wants a 'cut' cookie. Her Papa even said they were GREAT!"
"0","5","These turned out really good for me. I used Crisco butter and I like vanilla so I used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon. The dough had a great consistency and I was able to bake them right after mixing. Great cookie!"
"0","5","OMG these are SO good! They are really easy to make! They are really perfect!"
"0","5","This is literally the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. The cookies are soft and fluffy, even after they've cooled. The balls of dough bake down into perfect circular cookies, which makes for fabulous presentation. The sweetness is perfect too. I substituted half the amount of sugar for Truvia Baking Blend, and they taste just as good as if with all regular sugar. I highly recommend this one!"
"0","2","If you use the dough right away, its very sticky. I put it in the fridge for awhile, so it was easier to roll. Baked, but they cool hard and aren't as tasteful. Wouldn't use again."
"0","5","easy and DELICIOUS!!!! Kids love to help with these, rolling the balls in sugar. A GREAT recipe -- Thank You!"
"0","2","I followed the recipe to the letter, but the cookies came out brittle and bitter. Doused them in confectioner's sugar to help sweeten them a bit. Wouldn't recommend."
"0","5","I did not like this recipe at all"
"0","5","I love this recipe and have told others where to find it after they taste the cookies. I agree with the one review about the butter, it must be soft. I also roll them in sugar before baking, a little extra crisp and sweet. Great recipe."
"0","5","Perfect 10! My cookies turned out wonderful and this recipe was what I was looking for. They were very easy. I made the mix and immediately rolled the cookies with a little flour."
"0","5","I was that person that couldn't even make spaghetti properly. These cookies are easy to make, and so delicious! They're not too sweet, and even my nieces and nephews would enjoy making these.  I love that the ingredients are everyday staples in the kitchen. Maybe because i'm inexperienced still, but when I take them out to cool they flatten out, they don't stay round. Anyone have any tips on that?  I didn't have the problem with the butter; softening it properly makes the batter properly."
"0","5","I love sugar cookies and this is a very simple recipe that is easy to follow."
"0","5","I made this receipt for my church, instead o 4 dz it made 24 lg they were the best sugar cookies. I ever had, I just made them again and like the large ones .  Mary"
"0","5","This has got to be the BEST recipe for sugar cookies EVER. I've used it twice and gotten yummy sugar cookies each time. It's so easy to make the cookies and the taste is out of this world. Rolanda's review helped make the cookies even better!"
"0","5","simply perfect sugar cookies!"
"0","5","We have made this recipe a few more times. My Granddaughter has decided (after forgetting to put them in!) that she likes making them without the baking soda or powder. That way they are a little more firm and she can frost them. Still taste great! Love them the way the recipe calls... light and fluffy, melt in your mouth! But this is another option!"
"0","5","I chose this recipe due to the high number of reviews (over 3000) and the high rating - this was great! I even cut down the amount of sugar to 1 cup and they were great!"
"0","5","I made this cookies yesterday. Super fast and easy recipe. I made about 2 dozen (they came out big) and there is almost none left. I'll do them again in a heart beat"
"0","5","Made these with my 3 year old. Very easy and fun to make (she loved rolling the dough into balls). Soft and chewy deliciousness!"
"0","5","I followed the directions for the ingredients to a T I didn't alter it in that regard. The ONLY thing I didn't do was roll the dough out by the teaspoon full. They were just way too small. Other than that these turned out perfect. Added this to my recipe box."
"0","2","I thought the cookies tasted too eggy for my taste. I opt more for chewy cookies and this just didn't cut it; even with the cookies just golden on the bottom, they still tended to be quite crunchy around the edge. I read in the other reviews to make sure that the butter was very soft, just before the point of melting, and it was but that did not seem to help. I like the idea of these cookies, so I may make them again and see what works best for me... I also may try the 'healthy alternative' to this recipe. I'll keep you allrecipe lovers posted on it all."
"0","5","should have known: these hardly spread...flatten them out before baking."
"0","4","My hubby wanted a homemade sugar cookie so I looked online and chose this one. I didn't have plain flour so I used self rising but added 1/2 the amounts of baking soda and powder. I rolled the dough into small balls and pressed them slightly with my fingers so they wouldn't be puffy. In ten minutes I was sprinkling sugar on some pretty cookies. A few minutes later we were enjoying some really good cookies. :)"
"0","5","This was a super simple yet delicious recipe. I made it exactly as written. Butter was room temp, which I think is key. I made little balls and rolled them in sugar. Perhaps I could have made them bigger, because I ended up with about 6 dozen. But, the size was what I wanted so, even better! Just a fantastic cookie recipe that my kids, hubby, and hubby's co-workers loved. Thank you so much!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe!! I baked them for 8 minutes and they turned out great! I liked the warm buttery taste. I'll definitely keep this recipe!"
"0","1","The recipe was easy to follow but the cookie wasn't that great. Very cakey (I don't like cakey cookies) and dry. I don't make sugar cookies often and have been searching for a really good recipe. I think I will keep trying."
"0","5","This is a great and easy sugar cookie recipe! I followed exactly as written except I used whole wheat flour and they came out so good! They are a little crunchy on the outside and really soft on the inside. Next time I use this recipe, I will use white flour. Our cookies were pretty thick so it took about 10 minutes. I was afraid I would have to refrigerate the dough because most of the recipes I've seen say to do that, but these didn't need it, which on a weeknight worked well."
"0","5","Really good and SUPER EASY!!! I just sprinkled some maple syrup granules on top... and it is sooo good!"
"0","5","I made these sugar cookies for the Holiday,they came out great and the taste is delicious my husband couldn't wait until tell got cold he loved them. Thanks for the recipe. I give it a Five star"
"0","5","It is very easy and tender and sweet i would say to add a little sugar on top before baking"
"0","5","These tasted a lot like Nilla wafers. I baked them small and put them in my banana pudding recipe. It turned out really good! My husband was impressed. :)"
"0","4","It was a good recipe, the main benefit was the simplicity. It seems a multitude of sugar cookie recipes involve multi hour steps. I did notice that they werent quite sweet enough when done. The quick remedy was just sprinkling sugar over them when warm. They ended up pretty good! thanks for the recipe"
"0","5","Yummith in my tummith"
"0","5","i've never made cookies till now n was super worried! but these were easy to make n tasted great! oh i followed the recipe entirely n didnt made any changes!"
"0","4","Tasty and perfect for the late night cookie cooking crave!"
"0","5","hi"
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly, and the cookies came out great! I grated some lemon zest into the batter, and added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I also used a melon ball scooper which gave the final cookies a perfect shape!"
"0","5","Awesome!! Tasty AND easy!!! Used margarine instead of butter for softer, chewier cookies. Also be sure margarine is at room temperature and cream the margarine and sugar VERY WELL. Add a little extra vanilla and sprinkle with sugar. Can't wait to add cinnamon next time for easy snickerdoodles!"
"0","5","Great Recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe was great. The best sugar cookie recipe i have found so far."
"0","5","Lovely just brilliant tasted wonderful my boyfriend did enjoy much very"
"0","5","I had never, ever made homemade sugar cookies before so I was looking for an easy (and delicious) recipe. This was it! They were so incredibly good and not overly sweet. I have a friend who doesn't even like sugar cookies and she loved them! They were a big hit with my coworkers. The trick is to take them out when they are still a little underdone. They harden up as they cool on the wire racks and you don't want overdone cookies! They were very soft in the center, just the way I like them."
"0","4","Super easy! Added colored sugars to the top. Everyone loved them."
"0","5","I loved the consistency of the dough. It was easy to roll into balls. The only addition I made was to roll each ball into white sugar prior to baking. They looked and tasted great!"
"0","5","My kids and I made cookies Christmas Eve. They were a hit at our Christmas brunch. The kids beamed with pride."
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice in the past two weeks! Amazing cookies! Soft with some chew and some crisp. Very easy to make. At the end when you mix in the flour it may seem too powdery and that all of the flour mixture isn't getting into the dough. Just hand mix in what is left and it makes a good consistency."
"0","5","These were excellent, I chilled the dough prior to making them and they turned out great. I made them for Christmas and rolled them in colored sugar. They were a big hit. I was also happy to see that they stayed soft. They were all gone within a few days but they stayed soft the entire time."
"0","5","This is great and fast recipe my family love it!!!"
"0","5","I just made these. Very good and super easy. I added about a teaspoon or so of almond flavoring so i increased the flour by a few tablespoons and they turned out perfect! Slightly crispy but nice and soft on the inside. I also really like how the recipe adjusts for servings. One of the best sugar cookie recipes I have ever made!!"
"0","5","These are the perfect sugar cookie - I rolled the balls halfway in Xmas sprinkles."
"0","1","Amazed at all the good reviews, my sister and I jumped into the recipe immediately. We first started noticing problems when we added the flour mix with the butter, egg, vanilla mix. We noticed that the cookie dough was crumbly and looked like sand. We ignored it and made small dough balls and put them in the trays. The dough was extremely dry and could barely stay stuck together in a ball. We set the oven for 10 minutes. The balls barely expanded at all. Still hopeful, we took them out and tasted them. Luckily, they were not severely burnt or anything, but they tasted bland, like flour. Finally, we put icing and sprinkles on them and ate them because we didn't want to waste all our time and supplies. With the icing, they weren't a disaster anymore :) But we're still quite disappointed. So we looked up some bad reviews because it made us feel less disappointed... hopefully this review can help you feel better if the cookies didn't turn out the way you hoped... because we are with you! Happy baking! :D"
"0","5","Quite possibly the best sugar cookie recipe out there. I would, however, add a pinch of salt because it needs a bit. Took mine out @8 minutes and perfect after cooling a few minutes. DO NOT OVER BAKE. I used a small cookie scoop and it was super-easy. I did roll some in a cinnamon sugar mixture because husband begged for them. I tried telling him they weren't sugar cookies with cinnamon, but he was happy and they came out equally as good as the plain.   If you need to soften your butter simply put in microwave for approximately FOUR seconds per side. Do NOT use melted butter. GOOD RECIPE, STEPHANIE :-)"
"0","5","I made these for Christmas and my 4 year old helped every step, especially rolling the dough. One tip: The ones we rolled in colored sugar before baking came out better than the ones we tried to sprinkle later. They were all delicious and I would have been happy to eat them all myself! (which I almost did)"
"0","5","Easy AND delicious! I started baking as a teen, but have been baking more and more from scratch over the last year. I wanted an easy cookie recipe for days when we want something sweet at the house. I first made this recipe last Christmas and have been using it ever since. For this recipe, I use it as originally written and I've never had any issues. I warm the butter in the oven to help it soften and I don't have any problems w/crumbly dough once I add the egg and vanilla. I literally just made a batch to take to our family Christmas party later this evening, and they taste fantastic. I added red sugar crystals on half and made semi-snickerdoodles out of the others. The only change is that I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Next time, I think I will try adding lime or lemon zest to the batter for an extra zing of flavor. I like this recipe b/c it's easy and doesn't require much fuss. The cookies are chewy, but not gooey and they stay that way! I usually try to make enough to last us a few days, and they never taste stale. As for the cooking time, I check them at 8 minutes and then if needed, I'll add 2 minutes. I think anything longer than 10 minutes is too 'done.' Bless you for this recipe!"
"0","5","Awesome, not much I can add other than if you roll in sugar do so right after making each ball, dough tends to dry a little on the cookie sheet. Also for those that said the dough was crumbly I wonder if this is their first dough recipe. After combining wet and dry ingredients it is crumbly until you knead and work w/the dough. Heat from your hands softens the butter and makes it into the dough you're expecting."
"0","5","My family loved them because they weren't too sweet! I did take them out of the oven after 7 minutes because they prefer a soft cookie but other than that, I followed the recipe as is."
"0","4","Good recipe. Good buttery taste. I added an additional egg and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Like the other reviews, do not bake no longer than 8 minutes."
"0","2","I measured everything carefully, made sure the butter was soft and even had the egg at room temperature. What I eded up with was a dry crumbly mess that didnt even closley resemble cookie dough. After adding nearly 1/4 cup of liquid was I able to handle it properly. With the added liquid I had to double the bake time."
"0","3","I'm no stranger to baking or cooking, but even I found that this recipe is on the dry side. My butter was completely softened as someone else suggested. May try this recipe again with either more butter or less flour next time. The batter looked good until about the remaining cup of dry ingredients - the mixer just broke the batter into crumbly bits - much like when you cut cold butter into flour for biscuits.  Baked the cookies for 8 minutes - color was perfect. Mostly white with the slightest tinge of brown. The insides were soft and chewy. I lowered the time to 6 minutes when baking on some of my cheaper thinner pans.  Dusted the tops with powdered sugar. Looks nice.  EDIT: After the cookies completely cooled, the insides turned crunchy, which is good if you like them like that. Unfortunately, I prefer a slightly softer cookie and I've already baked these at the shortest time possible without undercooking them. I will be trying a different recipe next time."
"0","5","Easy and delicious!!"
"0","5","Very easy, worked with a Butter/vegtable oil spread too (not a low fat one). Look forward to decorating with my daughter."
"0","4","Quick and easy, as the recipe promised. Make sure all ingredients, especially the butter, are at room temperature before starting. I would also suggest, after you form the dough into a cookie sized portion, roll it in sugar and slightly press it on the cookie sheet."
"0","5","I love these sugar cookies! cant stop eating them."
"0","5","this recipe not only is easy like described but all of the measurements were exact!! On top of that they look smell and taste great without adding anything to the cookie itself(icing, frosting or adding sprinkles). best sugar cookies I've ever made and can even stand up to the store bought competitors!!"
"0","4","This issue might be with my technique, but these don't come out chewy : ("
"0","5","It's a fabulous recipe be sure to time ur cookies a few mins to golden = semi crunchy. Otherwise they will be soft:)"
"0","5","OMG!! This was the easiest recipe ever. I just finished and I have to say I'm smiling....believe me that's a big deal. I really don't like baking, but my GROWN children want Mom to bake for the holidays. These are fun. Kids would love doing these. All I did was add an extra tsp. of vanilla, rolled in little balls, as directed,then dipped in colored sugar...so pretty....taste so good. I will definitely make these little jewels again. Nothing less than 5*****. Thanks so much for this SUPER recipe!! PegK"
"0","5","I love this this recipe. It is great the way it is or sometimes I add spices like garam masala to the dough and sugar topping."
"0","5","made this several times and so yummy and easy! make sure the butter is very soft. we roll them in sugar for extra sweetness!"
"0","5","I really enjoyed these! No rolling or refrigerating, but still delicious! A keeper for sure."
"0","5","Was looking for a very simple sugar cookie recipe that did not need to be refrigerated! I looked at the other reviews and did add another tablespoon of vanilla.  These cookies turned out light and delicious! I dipped them in colored sugar before baking to add a move festive touch!  This recipe is a keeper and will be throwing out all my other sugar cookie recipes!"
"0","5","I have never made sugar cookies before, and these were really simple, and absolutely delicious! My husband and I can't stop eating them!"
"0","2","They stayed in a little ball shape. They were decent tasting though - I like a very plain cookie. Total flop, giving less than a square inch of cookie for my daughter to decorate."
"0","5","They taste awesome but why don't mine come out flat like the pic?"
"0","4","This was nice and easy to make! Taking this batch to the girls I coach at the gym :)"
"0","2","Followed to the receipe by the book , with no changes. Cookies were cooked when baked but next da they were hard like a rock! Not a good receipe to follow"
"0","4","My son asked if we could make Christmas cookies that we could frost/decorate, so we tried this recipe. Very tasty, but does not work if you want to use cookie cutters for various shapes. They expand too much, distorting the shape. Great cookie, though...a big hit in our house!"
"0","5","These were the first sugar cookies I have ever made that tasted really good. The only thing I did differently was to roll the cookies in cinnamon and sugar before baking. I will definitely be using this recipe again."
"0","5","This recipe is FANTASTIC! I'm a 14 year old and I brought this in for one of my classes. There weren't any left! Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Perfect!!!"
"0","5","I've made these cookies a few times, and they turned out great. I usually refrigerate the dough beforehand to make it easier to work with. Sometimes I add chocolate chips and a little bit of cocoa powder, makes for a great chocolate chip cookie!"
"0","5","This is a very simple recipe & I thought they were great. Used 1/2 tsp. vanilla & 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Would definitely make again."
"0","5","This recipe really is easy and they turn out delicious. Only thing i would do different next time is add about 1/4 cup extra of sugar to make them a little sweeter. I used a small cookie scooper to scoop the dough onto baking sheets. They were perfect."
"0","5","Made cookies as per instructions and was able to roll and cut them with cookie cutters without refridgerating them. Turned out beautiful. Was reluctant to take them out at 8 minutes so left them 2 minutes longer. Slightly crispy and delicious. Keeping this one."
"0","5","I love these cookies. I have been looking for a recipe like this one for years and these cookies will definetely become a christmas tradition in my house !!!!"
"0","5","seriously the best sugar cookies ever"
"0","5","Very easy and delish! Next time I make it I will use a bit more sugar cause I like it extra sweet :)"
"0","5","Simple and easy. The dough was very crumbly so I was a bit worried but once mixed with my hands it was great. Rolled the balls in coloured sugar before baking and were delicious treats!"
"0","5","Awesome! Baked for 8 minutes and they came out perfect! I did listen to other reviewers and softened my butter completely first. Fantastic recipe - a keeper! Thank you."
"0","5","I tried this recipe exactly as written. My only difference is that I use a tablespoon size scoop to portion them for baking. They are perfect. My family loves them!"
"0","5","Thank you a thousand times over! After failing too many times I gave up on sugar cookies, the chilling, the rolling, the cutting out and ending up with little bricks was too painful. These cookies are fantastic, they taste like sugar cookies should taste and OMG were they easy to make! I will NEVER use any other sugar cookie recipe!!! Thank you!!!"
"0","5","*******READ THIS IF YOU ARE SCALING DOWN THIS RECIPE********  My dough was a little too floury and was coming apart in little pieces. It also wasn't very sweet. I took about 6 tablespoons of sugar and 4 tablespoons of water, swished it around in a measuring cup and tossed it in. That really helped a lot. I also needed to add a little bit of butter since my dough wasn't sticking very well. My cookies came out a bit smaller than I was expecting, probably beacuse I added an entire egg instead of half, and even though I spread them out; they were still small. The diameter is about 2.5', a bit smaller than the top of a coffee cup. One tip I have is that before you put them in the ove, flatten the top a little bit and sprinkle some sugar on top. The sugar doesn't caramelize and since the cookie cracks at the top, it looks like a professionally made cookie. I had to actually mix with my hands and not my mixer because it was tearing into tiny pieces and getting coated in flour, which keeps the pieces from sticking.  This is an amazing recipe!!"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe. I tried making this a part of my holiday baking and it simply did not turn out. When i mixed the dry ingredients together with the butter it was very grainy and did not come together when i added the egg and vanilla."
"0","1","The mixture of the ingredients were too dry, and I added a TINY bit of 2% milk. The consistency was perfect. Just like a sticky, sweet-smelling mixture. I baked them and were surprisingly... Bitter.... I topped them with honey and it took away a bit of the bitterness. I bet it wasn't the milk i added. And I only added about 1/8 teaspoon."
"0","5","This recipe is great. Its simple and quick and can be done in the mixer. The best part of this recipe is that it is a great base for many flavored cookies just by adding in extracts (instead of vanilla). I have made many variations and they have all turned out amazing. The best ones so far have been the lavender cookies. I added 2 tablespoons of lavender and they turned out so amazing and pretty addicting. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for posting:D"
"0","5","Made these last night exactly as recipe states. They are incredibly easy, fast and absolutely delicious. You will not be disappointed! Yummmmm!!"
"0","5","great recipe I rolled in raw sugar and peanut butter chips"
"0","5","I've tried a few sugar cookie recipes from here and elsewhere and liked them all but agree with many that this one is simple, uses ingredients you probably have on hand, and turns out a great tasting cookie. Do take them out at eight minutes and your finished cookie will be chewy on the edges and soft inside. I sprinkled mine with red or green sugars before baking, they were for a holiday party. I also added a teaspoon of almond flavoring to the batter because I love that taste in a sugar cookie. Several people at the party asked for the recipe and of all the cookies I brought, this was the most commented on!"
"0","5","This is a really easy sugar cookie recipe. They taste great and you don't have to bother with refrigerating the dough then rolling it out and making a mess of the kitchen. I made them vegan very easily and with great results - people couldn't tell they were vegan and ate them like crazy. I just substituted Earth Balance margarine for the butter and made a flax seed 'egg' by combining 1 tbsp of ground flax seed with 3 tbsp water. You let the flax/water combination sit for about 10 minutes then add it to the recipe just like you would a real egg. I rolled the cookies in red or green sugar before baking."
"0","5","wow I am super exited to make these"
"0","5","easy to make!"
"0","2","they are good but not that soft"
"0","1","I had just tried this recipe for some girls that I babysit for, and the cookies turned out bad!! Yes, I did have the butter softened. I never really heard of a recipe calling for baking soda & Baking powder. Needless to say maybe sugar cookies isn't my forte!"
"0","4","Nice recipe! Easy to make. I used baker's sugar and slightly more butter than recommended to make sure the dough wasn't too dry and then coated them with a mixture of granulated white sugar and cinnamon. Delicious!"
"0","5","I made this and it was super good.My hole family loved them. I used a electric mixer, make sure if you are using one to mix it on low when adding flour other wise it will get all over. I used cookie cutters and frosting. These were so easy too."
"0","5","Delicious! Very easy to make. I always get complimented on them. Before baking, I like to flatten each cookie and top it off with a little bit of extra cookie."
"0","5","I made these sugar cookies for me and my mom and i dont know if maybe i made them wrong or not but when i mad ethe batch i had to make three because the dough was so crumbley that it wouldnt stick together but they did taste amazing and was worth cooking! Hope this helped!"
"0","5","Awesome,quick,easy and delicious. I can't make enough of them! They barely make it to the cookie jar."
"0","3","Dough was a mess of crumbs. Baked cookies had a great texture but did taste like flour."
"0","5","So easy, so good! I've made these several times and they've always come through."
"0","5","Easy to make and really yummy! I substituted margarine for butter and 1/4 applesauce for the egg to make the cookies vegan... and they were absolutely DELICIOUS! Next time I make them (and there WILL be a next time) I plan on adding 1/4 cup more sugar. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
"0","4","Great recipe although it too sweet for me, especially with the added sprinkled sugar. I'll decrease the butter to 1 cup next time! Otherwise, perfect!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe, it's a keeper"
"0","5","Awesome cookie!! I prefered not rolling the cookie in sugar before cookie. Pull the cookies out of the oven between 8-9 minutes. They stay perfectly chewy."
"0","5","I loved this recipe!!It was super easy and didn't take long to bake."
"0","3","I usually dont bake from scratch. no matter how precise i follow a recipe something always goes wrong. i followed this recipe almost exactly.(i added salt as others suggested) the only other thing that was different is that my butter was completely melted. after mixing everything together the batter looked like it was a bit too stiff so i added an extra egg as a few people suggested then it was too doughy. it tasted a tad bit floury but i figured it would blend as it cooked. the first batch was kinda big so i cooked them for 9 minutes and took them out to cool. the second batch was smaller and cooked 8 minutes. they both came out exactly the same. they were soft but a dry. on a good note they have a great taste lol just want a sugar cookie should taste like. i will be trying this again so any suggestions on how to make it better would be great."
"0","4","The title does say it all. I have made these three times. The kids really like them, and I like them pretty well. Everything plays out nicely, but I have gotten a flour taste in every batch. Not enough to turn me off, I just wish I could figure out why. I do think about 10 minutes in the fridge before cooking really helps. I found that completely covering these in sugar was just too sweet. I just dip the top in sugar, and that is plenty. For my oven, 8 minutes exactly made the perfect soft on the inside/crunchy on the outside cookie. Great dunkin' cookies. I bet you have everything you need to make them right now. Bonus points if you just happen to have colored sugar on hand."
"0","3","Yummy, simple to make, nice to decorate but they are a bit too crunchy. Maybe I should have put them in the oven for a bit less time."
"0","1","I didn't care for these cookies when they were done. They 'turned out' fine, but the taste was just off putting:("
"0","2","I will not make this recipe again. I followed the recipe to a T and they just came out very greasy and too buttery tasting. They looked great but the taste was disappointing :( Maybe they need frosting but I just like a plain sugar cookie at times too."
"0","1","I give this recipe ZERO stars because, I am making them for a party, and they were crumby. I added everything and some milk. I think it needs salt, but i don not mean to be rude but i wasted 20 dollars plus of ingredients. I have seen that picture in google images, so you did not take tjhat pictre. I saw it before this recipe was done."
"0","4","so so good! sprinkled them with cinnamon fresh from the oven & they are a great crowd pleaser, served with tea or coffee, or for playdates!! one thing that i did have trouble with was balling the dough to put in the oven...i find it easier to flatten it a bit on the top, i don't bake much though so perhaps thats common knowledge. also i agree about the extra vanilla, way more delectable. :o)"
"0","5","Really good especially when you dont have enough time to make the rolled sugar cookies."
"0","5","Quick, easy, and delicious!"
"0","5","Really Easy and they turn out great!!!"
"0","5","These were great!"
"0","5","Delicious cookies! I made dinosaur cut outs with the first batch and traditional cookies as 2nd batch I mixed everything together for the cutouts and they rolled out fine and cut out fine. The second batch I mixed the sugar and butter then added it to the flower, there was no change in consistency. I did add a little more vanilla like one person suggested. Perfect! I can't wait to make them for Thanksgiving and see how people respond. Honestly yummy!"
"0","5","This is the one."
"0","5","i didn't like this recipe at all...i LOVED it...the only change i did was i added a pinch of salt. I work in a commercial kitchen and made these yesterday just to see how they would do...they sold out so fast, people were buying 4 at a time. Thank you for posting!"
"0","4","The cookies were great! I like it how it comes out chewy, big and just nice! For the butter part, I used half oil and half butter. My family liked it alot and will definitely bake sugar cookies using this recipe again. xx"
"0","3","I followed the recipe, but after I mixed the last of the flour in the dough was extremely dry. I ended up adding about 2-3 tbls of milk to get it to a normal cookie dough consistency. I can see why so many ppl complained of them being dry because if you didn't add the milk they would've been.  With the milk added mine turned out great. A little simple icing (milk and powdered sugar) and they were great."
"0","4","Super easy and good. Top with a bit of icing sugar and voila!"
"0","4","I LOVE this recipe! I usually throw in a packet of sprinkles/100s & 1000s. The kid's totally devour them. I also make them with white chocolate buttons on top to make them acceptable for my allergic to life nephew and he took home half the batch because he loved them so much! I've even made them with about 25 3-4 year olds and they easily made them and LOVED them! In short - I LOVE THEM and everyone I make them for LOVES them!"
"0","4","Really easy...I even had to substitute 1.5 cup of coconut flour for the regular flour and mine turned out really good. The dough was really good too! I did add 1/2 tsp. of salt because I think all recipes should have it. Great go-to cookie!"
"0","3","This is my first 'easy sugar cookie' recipe. I've made other sugar cookies before but it's cold and wet here today and I wanted something quick, easy and comforting. These are super easy to make. I didn't read reviews before making them. My butter wasn't completely softened. My first batch was made in 12 minutes... still waiting for them to cool completely, but the warm ones I ate were delish, although I might add a touch of salt the next time around. Second batch was cooking while I read reviews and I took it out at 8 minutes to see the difference. Overall, quick, easy and yummy."
"0","5","simple and delish!"
"0","5","I love this recipe because it's easy, delicious, and it is made with ingredients that are usually already in my pantry."
"0","5","I am decent baker but have never made sugar cookies. These turned out great! Very easy, crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Yum!"
"0","5","These are the best and most simple sugar cookies ever. I do a little addition to mine though - I turn them into my famous tropical sugar cookie. I add have a bag of white chocolate chips, a whole (small) bag of chopped macadamia nuts and then minus the rasins, I add a bag of tropical dried fruit mix - chopped. They never last at my house. I have to make a double batch and hide half."
"0","5","'So easy' is exactly how I would describe this recipe. I know some may say i'm insane but i got a sweet tooth and it is 2:50 AM and I am making cookies ha ha. No i'm not pregnant but if I were I would definitely make these sugar cookies. They are so quick and easy to make and they are so delicious. I would recommend these to any one of my friends and family. Thanks for posting this recipe. Sincerely, Rachel. :)"
"0","5","Easy and yummy!!! will make these again !!!!!!!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I did add 2 tsp of almond extract for a different flavor. Dough very easy to work with."
"0","5","Simple, easy recipe. I took the advice of several other reviewers and used 2 teaspoons of Vanilla extract, and limited the baking time to eight minutes and the cookies turned out perfectly."
"0","5","TOTALLY YUMMY!"
"0","5","Amazing and easy!"
"0","5","I needed a sugar fix, and these were quick and easy! I froze most of the batch as dough balls and they're wonderful to bake up straight out of the freezer in small batches."
"0","4","These had some great points. They are buttery. They rise nicely. They have a great texture. However, overall the flavor just seemed a touch lacking... and for a sugar cookie they didn't seem very sweet. If you plan on frosting these, they would probably be perfect, but if you are looking for a classic sugar cookie that can be eaten on its own, there are much better recipes out there."
"0","5","These are perfect! I accidentally melted the butter and they still tasted amazing!"
"0","5","Amazing recipe! The 8 minutes baking time was spot-on. Still chewy the next day, what more could you ask for?"
"0","5","A great recipe. Its simple, not too sweet, and just enough. Perfect for a summer Sunday or great for the holidays."
"0","5","This was my first time making sugar cookies from scratch and this recipe was perfect! Definitely saving for future use."
"0","5","Made these for a school project with my friends and they were a BIG hit. Very happy with how they came out"
"0","2","Lesson Learned: read all the lower-rated reviews before the higher ones to learn from other's mistakes.   The recipe seemed easy enough, but I had the batter-is-a-mess-of-crumbles problem many others reported. Another reviewer said the trick was to have mushy butter, but that did not help me out. I had to google 'fix my crumbly sugar cookie batter' to find out a little milk and some serious hand kneading was in order.   Which I did, and the batter was then something I could work with.  I won't be using this recipe again."
"0","5","tweeked a little due to food allergies but kids love them"
"0","5","Delicious!!! It was hard not to eat all the dough before the oven preheated."
"0","4","You have to bake these cookies as soon as you finish the dough. Once I left the dough out because I had something to do, and when a came back 30 minutes later to bake them, the dough had turned crumbly and had to bake. It took us a long time to finish them. Another time I refrigerated the dough because I didn't have time to bake them, and they also turned out dry and crumbly. The flavor is good, and they are really quick to make."
"0","4","these cookies were so easy, my daughter and i had some bonding time while making them. We call them the sweet heart cookies."
"0","5","This recipe is great! I made it last night at 8pm because my family was craving cookies and it was easy and quick. We enjoyed how fluffy and tasty the cookies were. I made one modification and added chopped pecans to the recipe. I will be making these again!"
"0","5","Just made these cookies. Definitely easy, and good. I added 1/4 tsp of butter extract to mine in addition to the vanilla and rolled half the batch in a cinnamon sugar mix before baking. Really good. Mine took 9 min."
"0","5","This is a great simple recipe that can be adjusted as needed. It isn't fancy but tastes great as is or with additions.  Add whatever you like. Sometimes I use almond extract and add chopped nuts. Other times I add dried cranberries or raisins. Try lemon extract and some lemon zest.  As suggested, make sure the butter is soft and the egg is at room temperature and your cookies should be a success."
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe. The bottoms burned and they didn't cook all the way through. The were too doughy and buttery."
"0","5","didn't last long"
"0","5","These cookies are great for the kids they love them"
"0","5","Used these for my daughter's birthday party and they were a hit! Yummy and soft!"
"0","5","Outstanding Cookies - quick and easy too. The family and friends loved them."
"0","5","I made these cookies today. It was my first attempt at homemade cookies. I added two teaspoons of vanilla extract and sprinkled them with cinammon when they came out. Delicious and simple!"
"0","5","This is one of the easiest and best sugar cookie recipes that I've tried! You can't just dump the sugar and the butter in the bowl, people. You have to cream it, which takes time....like 6-8 minutes. I made two batches and they both turned out fine and did not spread wildly like others claim. On the second batch I subbed peppermint extract and butter extract into mine because I wanted a mint chocolate chip cookie. I also added dark chocolate chunks. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","4","Great, quick easy cookie! I cooked for 8 minutes, and they are soft and doughy. Delicious. The dough was great to work with, be sure the butter is very soft before beginning (I softened in the microwave). I rolled them into white sugar before baking."
"0","5","These cookies are great. My girlfriend and I added 4 oz of chopped macadamia nuts and 4 oz of white chocolate chunks, and it turned out wonderful!"
"0","5","Easy..tasted great. Not too sweet..."
"0","4","They're good but I had to refrigerate the dough first because it was kind of sticky. I also doubled the amount of vanilla. Really easy though!"
"0","5","OMG these cookies are amazing. The recipe is very simple and takes hardly any time. After they came out of the oven, my family and I ate all of them and couldn't believe how tastey they were. Probably the best sugar cookie I have ever had."
"0","4","Made really nice cookies, my son loved them. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside...nice! For variation, I added chopped almonds and 2 tbsp cocoa to it....I realized that I should have increased the quantity of sugar after adding cocoa, but still tasted good."
"0","5","So simple and came out perfect, girls loved decorating them!"
"0","5","These are the BEST sugar cookies I've ever eaten and they were super easy to make. The only change I made, because of some of the other reviews, was to double the vanilla. Otherwise, I did exactly what the recipe said. I found that I had to use the full ten minutes to cook them but they're perfect! Thanks so much Stephanie!"
"0","5","these were absolutely delicious! my husband and kids loved them."
"0","5","I followed the recipe just as directed but I doubled the vanilla..I pressed them down before I baked them with sugar,as suggested.. I then sprinkled candy sprinkles on top. My family loved these cookies. So this is a keeper.."
"0","5","This by far is the EASIEST sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried. 8 min for soft cookies. Top with homemade frosting...super yum!"
"0","5","Amazing cookies. Super easy.   Tips: Since it only calls for one egg, if you don't have eggs don't worry. It may taste better with eggs but it doesn't screw up the recipe completely.  If you don't have baking soda or baking powder, just use self rising flour and leave out the salt because self rising flour is already slightly salty.   I reduced my cook time to 7 or 8 minutes because last time they got slightly too done on the bottom.   Hope this helps!"
"0","5","The best I ever made. My family loves them."
"0","5","The best sugar cookie ever. It is very easy to fix these anytime. My kids friends always request these cookies. No changes to recipe."
"0","5","Great simple sugar cookie recipe to use with kids."
"0","4","While making the cookies, i noticed it was too much flour. So, I didnt even use all that amount. It was still too much flour. Use some water when it gets dry. I used about 1/2 a cup. But, good anyways."
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made! I take them to my church meetings and people always tell me what a good job I did baking them and how good and soft they taste. And they are really really easy to make and the ingredients are easy to remember. I can whip them up in 15 minutes, that's all. So this is an A lister to me!"
"0","5","These are delicious plain as well. Clara and I bought store icing in a tube and decorated them. Fun & easy kid project."
"0","4","These have a great flavour - make sure you use good vanilla and roll the dough balls in white sugar before you bake them. I'd make them again :)"
"0","5","This was very easy to follow, i had a craving for something sweet and simple to make with little ingredients. this was extremely simple and very tasty! hit the spot juust right :) and it made enough to make a couple of batches for tomorrow night!"
"0","4","As advertised. Good! Needed to get the butter to room temp to get them to flatten out much, but delish!"
"0","5","My grand-daughter and I made these today and she says 'they are super yummy!' We sprinkled colored sugar on top to give them an extra sparkle. We were eating them as fast as they came out of the oven. I'll need to consider making a double batch next time! I think I'd like to try them with lemon flavoring instead of the vanilla next time, just to see how they come out."
"0","5","I made these once before and I overcooked them. :( But the flavor was very buttery and perfectly sweet! I decided to try making them again just now and they turned out great! Except I made it without the egg and it is really good! Try it that way!"
"0","5","Make sure you're butter is soft. It makes the Sugar Cookies ALOT better then it already is."
"0","5","Awesome."
"0","5","Follow recipe as it is and the cookies came out GREAT !!! Delicious... only problem I cant stop eating them :)..."
"0","4","With a couple of tweeks, this recipe was fantastic for soft, chewy sugar cookies. I used two teaspoons of vanilla, rather than one, added in 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. I will definitely use this again in the future."
"0","4","I read the review about the dough being too crumbly. I had the same problem, although my butter was soft. It was more like a pie crust than cookie dough. I added maybe an half cup of whole milk which brought the dough together. It was supper sticky, but cooked nicely. Great taste and super easy recipe."
"0","5","I've never been a good cook. At all. But I was in the mood for something sweet so I made some cookies with this recipe. The best cookie I've EVER had. Everyone loved them. Thanks!"
"0","5","Yum! They taste even better the second day! We added sugar sprinkles to the top!"
"0","5","Love these!"
"0","5","These cookies were easy to make(hence the name) and were delicious! Great consistency. Crisp on outside and soft on inside. Thank you for a great sugar cookie recipe! Best I've ever tasted..."
"0","5","This is a easy yummy recipe!! I used self rising flour so it took no time and I used margarine. So good my hubby and son loved them!! I am about to make again :o)"
"0","5","my husband is a sugar cookie connoisseur, and he LOVED these ~ so easy too : )"
"0","5","So easy to make and so so very good!!!!"
"0","5","Really easy to make. They taste great."
"0","5","Late night craving and ran into this spectacular recipe which called for all the things I already had in stock! I love anything lemon so I chose to add about 1/3 cup lemon juice. The 'dough' wasnt all that fluffy but still I was about to spoon out 6 large ones and drop on cookie sheet. After 10 minutes they all sort of baked as one giant cookie but nothing a glass cup couldn't fix. I cut out about 10 cookies and they all tasted like the center of a warm cookie. Not too crumbly, crispy, or liquidy. Lemony and just perfect!"
"0","5","Love this recipe! Super easy to make. I added reeses pieces to the tops to add a peanutbutter kick. Was delicious!"
"0","5","These are absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","This was my first time ever making sugar cookies and they turned out fabulously, if I do say so myself :) I've made other cookies in the past, but none which even required flour (believe it or not) so this was an entirely new experience for me. I followed the recipe exactly except substituted maple syrup for vanilla since I had no vanilla on-hand. I also used whole wheat flour opposed to white so the cookies have a brown speckled look to them rather than the regular creamy white look. SO yummy! I will definitely use this recipe again. It may also be worth mentioning that I blended everything by hand/spoon, no electric beaters here, so it's not necessary but may improve the end result."
"0","5","These cookies were so delicious that my brother thought I got them from a bakery. The only thing I did differently is added a little more vanilla extract. They are easy to make and the ingredients are things I always have in my cupboards. The cookies are not too sweet but good with or without icing. I will be making these over and over again, they are my new go-to cookie recipe!"
"0","5","Just finishing baking the last batch now! Amazing recipe. I added a little bit of cinnamon to the tops before I put them in the oven and it is an awesome touch to an already amazing recipe! Love it!"
"0","5","I added 1/2 tsp. of ground clove & 1/2 tsp. of salt to the recipe, it turned out really good! Crispy edges and chewy middles @ 8 mins. Yum!"
"0","3","Taste was OK and they came out very thin. Now the thin part is me not knowing how to bake haha, but the taste was so-so. Any seasoned cookie baker can tell me why didn't they stay nice and thick? As soon as I opened the door they would just get miserable :)"
"0","5","Super simple and oh so good! after reading a few reviews about the butter needing to be super soft.. i just melted my butter in the microwave. it worked perfectly... so yummy and sweet. everyone loved them!"
"0","4","delicious cookies ... though I did change it a bit. I didn't have enough white sugar on hand, so the sugar mix was 1/2 cup white, and 1 cup golden brown sugar. Since I was already off-base, I added a 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts. They came out a little like the popular pecan shortbread cookies, except better. Everybody loved them."
"0","4","The cookies tasted perfect, but at the end the batter was crumbly and wouldn't hold together. So we added a bit of milk and pressed it into a dough in a wide dish, with our hands. Took about 15 mins in my oven. Nice and soft"
"0","5","excellent!!! simple and delicious!! moist on the inside and just plain yummy!"
"0","5","So darn good!!!! Trust me!!! Best sugar cookies"
"0","5","These were so so good! I had been looking for a perfect recipe for sugar cookies, and this was definitely it! This will be my go to recipe for sugar cookies."
"0","5","amazing cookies! DELISH!"
"0","4","Thank you for this very 'easy' recipe! My 5 year old brother and I made it together. However, I did change the recipe a little. First of all, I made it with 1 cup butter(2 sticks) but it was WAY too buttery when I made it, it tasted more like a butter cookie then a sugar cookie(If that makes any sense) . It might also be because I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1 and 1/2. 1/2 is too much, so i removed it. Next time I will use 1 cup sugar and probably 1 1/2 stick butter. However, the cookies baked nicely after 9 minutes in the oven and they worked extremely well with a cookie pan that I own. The cookies will be soft out of the oven, so wait for 2 minutes to cool where it will firm up yet still be soft, warm, and delectable. THank you Stephanie!"
"0","5","I've used this recipe twice. First, I followed the recipe exactly, and the second I added some things to make it more suited to my tastes. I added some fresh ginger, cardamom, cloves and agave nectar, and used one cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Both times the cookies came out delicious! The recipe is very simple, thus being very easy to use. It also makes it great for experimenting with ingredients. All together, it's a great recipe."
"0","4","Great easy sugar cookies. I rolled them in colored sprinkles before baking. The first batch I thought was a bit bland. I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the second batch and they were quite a bit tastier. My son loves them and they are so much easier than rolling out and cutting."
"0","5","I made these cookies at daycare with the out of school care children and they were a sucess easy to follow and the kids loved them (so did the staff). This recipe has been added to our planing books for many more makes. Thank you for such a great recipe"
"0","5","LOVE this recipe! SO simple with all NORMAL ingredients! I made the recipe as directed (I too, stuck the marg in the microwave for 35 seconds), and then split the 'dough' into 4 bowls. We picked our 4 fav. food colouring colours and made four different colours. Then we took a little out of this bowl, and a little out of that bowl and rolled the different coloured dough into one little balls and slightly flattened them on the baking sheet. We repeated until we had all sorts of funky colour cookies happening (some had all 4 colours in them!) WHAT FUN COOKIES! A huge hit!!!"
"0","5","Super Easy! I made these yesterday and while the dough was crumbly, i pressed it into a lipped cookie sheet, rolled it a little, and used big heart shaped cookie cutter. I made them egg free, using a powder and water substitute i have for my son, and they turned out great. The kids had a fun time putting icing and candies on them to celebrate Valentine's day. I froze the extra cookies and will be making these with cookie cutters for all holidays. Followed other reviews, only baked 8 minutes and they were perfect."
"0","5","Very tasty and easy! I rolled some of the dough balls in a cinnamon/sugar mixture for snicker doodles too. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I love these cookies! When I made them I used some little Valentine cookie cutters and they worked great! But they were kinda crumbly after I mixed them, so I made medium sized balls and that helped them sorta shape up and they worked great. Stayed chewy and soft even until the next day! totally my favorite sugar cookie recipe yet!"
"0","5","I made these today and they were DELICIOUS! I was in quite a hurry, so they didn't come out exactly pretty... and I had to halve the recipe, so I just added a whole egg instead of a 'half an egg'.... they turned out a bit flat.  I prefer them without frosting, but I ended up frosting half of them because they were good both ways :D  I'll definitely be using this recipe again."
"0","5","the best sugar cookies i've ever had! my 10 year old sister made these tonight and the only change she made to the recipe is adding a bit of water after the ingredients were mixed, because it was very crumbly. they are perfect!"
"0","5","I found that the dough was pretty crumbly when I was trying to form dough balls. So I put a Tablespoon of milk in and mashed it around with my hands.  Works like a charm! Also did not put in 1/2 t. baking soda because I didn't have it. But Oh my goodness they were good!"
"0","5","I don't know how these cookies could be better - I was, as usual, a little surprised to see that people had trouble with them - basic basic cookie recipe and no-fail instructions. Good stuff, and saved to my recipe box."
"0","5","I love this recipe so much! I use it all the time and it works really great"
"0","4","Perfect recipe if you need to keep the kids focused for an hour on a Sunday afternoon. Chances are you have all the ingredients at home, and it's so easy that kids can do it with very little supervision. The call 'who wants to make cookies?!' Works 100% of the time."
"0","5","So quick and easy and so delicious!!"
"0","5","These are delicious and everyone always raves about these. I used this recipe when I made melted snowman cookies for the holidays. People thought they were so cute and so tasty!"
"0","5","I use this recipe as a base for EVERYTHING. I have a knack for frostings and icings and this cookie lends itself to any flavor combination I can come up with. Love it."
"0","5","I'm not a big fan of sugar cookies, but I was craving something sweet at 3am. So I made a batch of these and they came out WAY better than I expected. Nice and fluffy. I used brown sugar instead of white and it still came out pretty awesome. Definitely helped my craving lol."
"0","5","OMG!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","I love this cookie for its simplicity and convenience. I rand out of white sugar so used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and then ran out of unsalted butter so used 1/2 cup of Country Crock and added cinnamon and wow (clearly we were making our pantry stretch). I can't wait to follow the recipe exactly!"
"0","2","I couldn't get the cookies to be fluffy like the pictures..."
"0","5","Very Tasty, Perfect and Easy Sugar Cookie!"
"0","5","Very easy and yummy!!! They went very quickly"
"0","5","I think this recipe is fantastic. Easy to prepare and bake! I've made these cookies several times from this recipe and they get better every time. This last time I omitted the egg, and they turned out more crispy, which is what I prefer. With the egg makes them more tea-cake like. Also, I use soft margarine instead of butter. Delicious and easy!"
"0","5","I loved them. Don't change a thing!"
"0","5","OMG!!!it is really the easiest recipe ever. I can't never make cookies before not even from a box. I decided to give another try and these came out yummy!.Santa almost didn't get one!"
"0","5","Such easy cookies to make.. I made them and my kids ate them all once they got to the cooling rack."
"0","4","I really liked this recipe! But a few things: You must follow the recipe EXACTLY. If you make just a few changes (like I did) It could mess the entire thing up! Don't use cookie cutters 'cause the dough expands a LOT in the oven! But other than that the cookies were really good."
"0","5","I made these cookies a few different times. I always used real butter and they turned out amazing, everyone seems to really like them. But this time I only had margarine and it makes these cookies a total nightmare to work with. Other then that they seem to be a perfect sugar cookie."
"0","4","I really liked them. I wish I knew how to make them a little chewier."
"0","5","Easy and delicious. The perfect crispy outside and soft inside!"
"0","5","These are great and they are super easy we make them all the time at our house now!!!"
"0","3","Makes an okay sugar cookie not the best for cutting shapes despite what other reviews said. Even after leaving in the refrigerator over night they were still almost impossible to work with. I used wax paper and extra flour and yikes."
"0","4","I accidentally doubled the amount of butter and the cookies were AMAZING!!! I had to cook them for about 12 minutes instead of the recommended 8-10. Also, I added chopped dried cherries which added to the delicious chewy texture."
"0","5","I really wasn't expecting a lot but these cookies got nothing but rave reviews from everyone. Some said they were best sugar cookies they had ever had and they were certainly some of the easiest -- other than store bought -- I ever made.  The only addition I made was x-mas colored sugar sprinkles on top before baking."
"0","5","Awesome!!!!! Very easy and awesome!!! I added more vanillia than it calls for but other than that, there is no way to improve it!!!"
"0","5","These are amazing and I am not much of a baker. This will be one of my new staple dishes!"
"0","5","These cookies are excellent! They remind me very much of cookies my great aunt made growing up... the flavor is wonderful and perfect plain or with icing/frosting! I added food coloring to make mine festive for the holidays and it was a bit difficult, but i was pleasantly surprised when they turned out to be a pretty marbled red!"
"0","5","My three boys loved these cookies."
"0","5","Wonderful cookies! they were by far the BEST cookies i've ever had. and they don't take long to make!! :) i recommend this recipe, definetely!!"
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have ever had! I hadn't made any in a long while, and these were absolutely perfect! I plan to make more for my girlfriend tonight, and add red and green sprinkles for the holiday.  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe. They were the perfect mix of crunchy and chewy. I baked them for only 8 minutes, and though they came out soft, they firmed up. I have now found my new go to recipe for sugar cookies!"
"0","5","Yes - THIS is the recipe I've been dreaming of for years now! I left the butter out over night. I added an extra egg and 1/4 tsp of salt (used unsalted butter). The first batch I used Splenda instead of sugar. The second batch I used 3/4 cup of Splenda and 3/4 cup of sugar as well as 1 large tsp of lemon zest. The first batch dough was stiff. The second batch dough was buttery. The second batch of cookies came out a lot softer and delicious!!!! I also used powdered vanilla instead of liquid. I will continue making these cookies - as per the 2nd batch!!"
"0","5","Very easy and yummy. I only put my cookies in for 6 minutes because I like chewy cookies. As soon as they came out I sprikled some cinnomon sugar on them, it look geat and tasted great!"
"0","5","I just pulled out the first pan, and I have to say, these cookies are delicious! Super easy to make and also incredibly tasty! The perfect sugar cookie recipe.  Neither I nor my brother are huge fans of sugar cookies, but they're his roommate's favorite so I made some for her, and we all ended up loving them! Definitely try this recipe!"
"0","5","Awesome!!! Perfectly soft in the middle and stayed that way for a few days. They were a hit with everyone and this will definitely be my go to recipe for sugar cookies!!!"
"0","5","Not a thing wrong with this recipe! After reading other reviews, I made sure my butter was soft (and I used BUTTER, not margarine as one other suggested), added 1/4 tsp of salt and the result was the best sugar cookies I've ever made! I rolled my dough balls in sugar, and pressed an M&M in the center. Convert to Snickerdoodles by adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough, and roll the balls in cinnamon & sugar mixture."
"0","5","its not fair i should be able to give this recipe 100 stars,its awesome,the best cookie i ever made.followed the recipe,didnt change a thing,cooked for 8 min. soooooooooooooo good"
"0","5","Oh my goodness these cookies were delicious! Just made them! Very easy to put together as well!! Very satisfied!! Thank you!"
"0","4","They were yummy! The batter was very crumbly, was a little difficult to work with.  Husband loved them!"
"0","5","I don't know if there's a big difference in the ingredients in the cookies and other sugar cookies, but I had a cookie swap with a few friends this past weekend and one of them used this recipe to make jam thumbprint cookies and they were awesome! The only thing that she said she did differently was that she used a silicone mini muffin/cupcake baking dish (so she could make a well in them to spoon the jam into) and she didn't bake them quite as long as the recipe called for. I will definitely be using this recipe for myself very soon!"
"0","5","these are the yummiest sugar cookies ever! love them, are so easy to make. we make them every year for Christmas and i invite my daughters friends around for a cookie making playdate. The only thing I change is a bit less butter. However i do live in the UK, so the butter is a bit different, other than that they are perfect! we add some christmas spices to them for make it a bit more festive. on batch is plain and one batch is christmasy"
"0","5","Delicious and really easy! Perfect for this week's cookie exchange. Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe!"
"0","5","It was so good! Especially with icing"
"0","5","Anyone who tried one complimented on how they normally do not enjoy sugar cookies, and that they all loved these ones. The only thing, is I took one of the reviews advise and added an extra tablespoon of vanilla. : )"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! My family ADORED them. I took advice from the other users and made sure my butter was completely soft (I actually put it in the microwave for 15 sec.) and only left it in 8 minutes!! So yummy!"
"0","5","Lovely!!! I added the zest of a lime, I think a the zest of half an orange would work lovely too. These are amazing, they will go away so soon you wont believe it!"
"0","5","This was the easiest sugar cookies I ever made! Everyone loved them. The first time I made it I rolled it out and cut into candy canes, but the dough really expands when cooking so it didn't look like it was supposed to. However, when I made them with a rounded tablespoon, they all came out perfect. Everyone at work asked for more. I brought them again the very next day. It's so great, my boss even said I would have an excuse for not getting to work on time if I kept bringing the sugar cookies. =)"
"0","3","These sugar cookies are okay, but the dough is too tough and difficult to work with. The texture is not great once the cookies are baked either."
"0","5","I made this with my mom for a group that I go to. She taught me all I needed to know about how to make cookies. BE SURE TO CHURN THE BUTTER GOOD! If you don't, it WILL turn the cookies/batter hard. :) 5 Stars because it was easy to make it and it tastes delicious. We used food coloring this christmas to make it fun, and yes it's harder to tell when it's done but we just went 9 minutes and they turned out perfect. We also used a small ice cream scooper to turn the cookies into medium sized balls. :)"
"0","5","I made these for the first time and they were delicious!! It was soft on the inside too! Really great! and it didnt even take me a long time to make! my family loves them! and so do my friends"
"0","5","Super easy, quick and delicious. The recipe yields a lot, so I had plenty of leftovers, but they didn't last long. Everyone from kids to Grandma loved this and wanted the recipe. Soft, buttery and sweet. Perfect sugar cookies recipe; can't say enough!"
"0","5","GIANT balls can be cooked 1 1/2 minutes longer. delicious!:)"
"0","4","take out of the oven before they start to brown to keep cookies soft"
"0","5","I live at a high altitude in Colorado and I just finished a batch. They came out perfect and I didn't alter the recipe. I do like my cookies bigger than what most recipes call for, so that may have made a difference. I am very pleased."
"0","2","Couldn't cut into shapes because they were too gooy but once they sat out to cool, they were too hard to really enjoy."
"0","5","Perfect easy cookie when low on ingredients! I had no baking powder but they still turned out great."
"0","5","I laughed aloud when I pulled mine out of the oven, they were so flat & stuck together, probably because I used caster sugar (all I had on hand). I still give these cookies 5 stars though, THEY WERE SO DELICIOUS."
"0","4","Great recipe and very easy to make. We added sugar sprinkles to the top before baking and let them cook 6 minutes. Leave them on the pan additional minute to finish cooking and give a soft texture instead of crunchy. I did cook a batch for 8 minutes and crunchy is great also."
"0","5","I made this recipe for my grandpa who just went through heart surgery and survived which is GREAT!! But he needs to gain some weight so I shipped these cookies his way and I hope he likes them. ( I know I liked the dough!! Not that I tried them or anything)"
"0","5","i can do it with just egg sugar flour butter"
"0","5","So good and easy to make my girls love them"
"0","5","Easy, delicious, amazing. Made 2 batches this weekend!"
"0","5","Love these cookies! I also got everything ready before realizing I didn't have vanilla, only almond extract. So I used that instead and they came out FANTASTIC! Will be making some today with vanilla, I'm sure they will rock too :)"
"0","5","So simple and so delicious!! Perfectly fluffy and light."
"0","3","baking these cookies with my daughter tonight .. crossing my fingers xxxxx :)"
"0","5","These cookies were so delicious and my boyfriend, Michael, just couldn't put them down! I thank you so much bc I've been looking for a really easy sugar cookie recipe and most I've tried were so bland. These were perfect. I rolled them in sugar, just too add a little more crunch. YUMMY!!! And great for the Holidays! I literally spent 20 min in the kitchen."
"0","5","Best sugar cookie I have ever made! I did have to add my own touch. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Family loved them!"
"0","5","Wow! Great texture to this cookie. Cooked on a baking stone and they were a perfect consistency. Will be doing these again!!"
"0","2","I dont know what happened, i followed the recipe and the cookies came out kinda hard. My mom says that they taste like cornbread, so i dont know where i went wrong."
"0","5","my boyfriend work for the military and when i made these for his crew they loved them. im a beginner at cooking and baking and they where so easy and they taste awsome!! good recipe!! :) two thumbs up!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and delicious!"
"0","5","These are so easy and delicious! I love that they stay soft, and use very basic ingredients that are usually on hand. The last batch I baked them and then added m and m's to the top while they were hot. Yummy!"
"0","5","Just finished the first batch of these, and they turned out great. Very easy to make, my son loved helping me make these. Make sure if your like me and like putting big balls of dough that you leave plenty of room, or your cookies will bake together once the dough flattens out."
"0","5","Great cookie I bake mine for just a minute or two less to get a softer sugar cookie, big hit with the folks at work and a easy cookie to make, I also add vanila (1 tlbs) for more flavour."
"0","5","Simply delicious!"
"0","5","This is the best cookie recipe I have ever made!! Easy, chewy, soft goodness!!! I just finished making the entire batch and only half is left as the 'guys' have eaten them!! I did roll them in cinnamon sugar which gave them an almost snickerdoodle taste. Thank you so much for this post!!!"
"0","5","very easy to make and very yummy :)"
"0","5","After blending all ingredients, the dough was very crumbly. So, I added an extra egg and then the dough had a perfect consistency. The cookies were light and lightly crispy, but not hard. I used butter and these cookies just melt in your mouth! Delicious!"
"0","5","This is absolutely the easiest and yummiest recipe for sugar cookies! I brought these for a get together and received raving reviews, even my husband loves these!!!!"
"0","4","Melt in your mouth good and super easy to make."
"0","5","As a grandma, I am always searching for the perfect Sugar Cookie. I have finally found it! I did customize the recipe and even the grandkids love it plus it has the extra benefit of being healthier. After I have rolled out the cookies, I put about 6 roasted (with garlic salt and butter), shelled pumpkin seeds. Make sure that you push them into the dough slightly, so that they will bake in and won't fall off when the cookie is cooked. The baking time was perfect at 10 minutes, and they are perfectly round. Didn't find that they spread an exceptional amount as other reviewers did. This recipe is the best!"
"0","5","Awesome sugar cookie recipe! I followed recipe exactly. Cookies are soft and sweet. This is my new favorite cookie recipe!"
"0","5","perfect and they stay soft!"
"0","5","they are awesome good cookies my cookies came out very large"
"0","5","These are by far the best buttery sugar cookies! They are easy to make & pretty quick, too."
"0","5","I made these cookies today for a pot luck. They were a big hit! It's not too often sugar cookies turn out soft...and stay soft! Great recipe!"
"0","4","These are so yummy and easy to make! Make sure you take them out at exactly 9 minutes, or else they have crunchy outsides. They look pretty with sprinkles or granulated sugar crystals."
"0","2","When I tried this recipe I followed the instructions exactly how it was written and the family and I both agreed that the cookies had come out tasting more like flower than a delish surgar cookie. So I left out the 3/4 and add a little more butter and not only did the cookies come out super soft and fabulous but they were just as soft and tasty the very next day:-) Once i played around with this recipe the cookies came out great."
"0","5","Awesome recipe so easy and had fun with my kiddies. This will be one of our favorites for holidays and fun."
"0","5","Delicious! This was the first recipe that I have ever used on this website and it was wonderful!"
"0","3","The cookies kind of fell apart on me and were more of a flakey dusty cookie rather than the chewie kind I was expecting. It was very easy though and fast to make, no need to wait for it to refrigerate which was nice."
"0","5","I don't have anything to compare this too, as these are the only sugar cookies I've ever made, but everyone in my office liked them, and they came out nice and light. I had to thaw out the butter from frozen, and so some of it was very melted when I mixed it with the Sugar. They weren't too sweet. The best part was how quick and simple they were to make. I did all the mixing in my Kitchen Aid."
"0","4","Great recipe for sugar cookies, I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla in my cookies."
"0","5","Delicious!!!"
"0","5","I have read a few of the reviews and noticed alot of people were saying the dough was crumbling. I had the same experience with this and I found that kneading the dough while mixing in the dry ingredients helped make the dough smooth and easier to manage."
"0","5","I made these and they were the BEST SUGAR COOKIE I HAVE EVER MADE! I used lemon extract instead of vanilla, I used a little more flour, about 3 cups. They are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, the best part is NO CHILLING THE DOUGH."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! So quick and simple - it took me less than 15 minutes to get all the ingredients together and make the dough. I used a mini cookie scoop and ended up with 56 cookies - MORE than enough! I listened to the other reviews, though, and cooked them for 8 minutes (on a regular cookie sheet) and 9 minutes (on a baking sheet with sides) and they came out perfect - crispy on the outside and not too chewy in the center. I also rolled my cookies in sugar before baking - 1/4 cup is more than enough for 56 cookies. Awesome recipe - one that I will definitely use around the holidays since it is so quick! One more note - I did not have to nor did I choose to chill the dough before they were baked."
"0","3","I tried this recipe with Splenda instead of sugar; it turned out more like a biscuit than a cookie. It probably works better with regular sugar. But my friends loved eating these with their chili because the Splenda turned it into kind of a sweet biscuit."
"0","5","Wonderful cookies but not for those who love them burnt, like I do. The flavor lessens the more brown that they are. The best burnt cookie I've tasted so far is the peanut butter cookie. This cookie is meant to stay light in color."
"0","5","great"
"0","5","This was a simple recipe and it was delicious as my daughter would say. I followed the recipe exactly except on top of the cookies I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on some of them. Will definetly use this recipe again."
"0","5","These cookies could not have been more perfect. I love them, husband loved them, kids loved them, my parents loved them. I'll be baking these often. I read a few reviews and agree with the 8 min for slightly crunchy outside/ chewy inside. Perfect!"
"0","5","Super easy to make. I added red food coloring to make them pretty and sprinkled sugar on top. Easy and fast. Doesn't take tons of ingredients and went super fast."
"0","5","I was about to write these cookies off after the first cookie sheet came out of the oven; they were burnt beyond belief and they were only in the oven for 5 minutes! Then I figured out that it was my oven and not the recipe that's the problem; I recently moved to a new place and the oven is GARBAGE! 375 must translate to 1000 degrees. I lowered the temperature, tried again, and WOW! I had to throw out a few cookies, but this made a huge batch so it was no problem. And the ones that did turn out... pure heaven! Next time I think I'm going to try putting M&M's in them :)"
"0","5","so easy and so yummy! Best sugar cookie recipe I have been able to find. I usually add an extra teaspoon of vanilla for a touch more flavor, but even without the extra vanilla these are DELISH!!"
"0","5","Super easy to make and the taste is perfect!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! I f you want some more colorful cookies try dropping food coloring in to the already mixed dough then needing it in. You will get beautiful confetti cookies"
"0","5","Great and simple! I like to double the egg and vanilla and add some cinnamon and crushed walnuts; I also set aside half the dough to mix in a lot of oats and get sweet oatmeal cookies! A sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on top adds a nice touch. Very tasty even without amendments though!"
"0","4","This was a quick and easy recipe! I added 1 tablespoon of almond extract instead of the vanilla and only used 2 cups of flour and they were wonderful!"
"0","5","These are great and easy to make!!!!!"
"0","5","These came out awesome! Light, fluffy, and tasty. We added blue food coloring, a fun twist for kids like us to bake with. Delicious."
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for almost two years now (and I make them fairly often) and they always come out perfectly for me! The cookie is exactly what I want in a sugar cookie, soft on the inside and crunchy around the edges. During the holiays I like to add a little peppermint extract for a Holiday flavor!"
"0","5","OH, EM, GEE, the BEST sugar cookies EVER. They turn out fluffy & soft on the inside. Amazing recipe as is. I did read the comments & made sure that my butter was softened before using. A-mazing! I'm not much of a cook, but I follow directions pretty well. These are easy & TASTY."
"0","5","this is a easy recipe for someone who does not know a lick about cooking,thanks tasty"
"0","5","Delicious and easy! Followed the recipe to the letter, and they turned out perfect! Nice chewy cookie."
"0","5","I just made these cookies, and Im a first time baker. They turned out great!! Thanks!"
"0","5","Everyone I have made these cookiies for , or have tasted them just loved them. And they are so easy!"
"0","4","Super easy, super richer. Great recipe. I am keeping this one."
"0","5","Delicious and easy! I put frosting and sprinkles and the kids loved them."
"0","5","I wanted to do a twist on the usual recipe, and used 1/2 tsp. of black walnut extract replacing the 1 tsp. of vanilla, and rolled the dough ball in bourbon smoked sugar for a deeper flavor. (Photo 182)"
"0","5","I don't normally even LIKE sugar cookies, but my family and I all loved these. I, too, made sure that the butter was completely softened before creaming, and baked each batch for exactly 8 mins each. Perfection! I get the feeling that I'll be making these again and again."
"0","5","The best soft sugar cookies!"
"0","5","i've never made sugar cookies before but i sure have eatem many and these were right up there witht the best! super simple, quick, and easy. my whole family loved them! i followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect!"
"0","5","These came out great. My kids and I loved them."
"0","5","So delicious and so easy! I have tried lots of sugar cookie recipes and this is by far the best one I have tried! The only adjustment that I made was instead of making the balls with a teaspoon I used a tablespoon. The first time I did it I thought they were just too small so I did them with the tablespoon the second time and they were perfect. It made right at 3 dozen cookies instead of the 4 dozen with the teaspoon."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe, so simple and so yummy. I added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and some cinnamon and nutmeg, rolled the balls in sugar and slightly flattened them, turned out super tasty!"
"0","5","Loved these. I didn't have enough butter, so I added part butter, part oil and it worked pretty good. The batter appeared really crumbly, even though my butter was VERY soft. I added a bit more oil (1/4 cup) and it was fine. I also added 2 tsp vanilla rather than one. My oven required 10 minutes for the cookies to be edible. I tried 8, but they were just too soft. 10 was perfect for me. Also, right out of the oven, I sprinkled them with a cinnamon/sugar mixture and it was lovely!"
"0","5","Oh my god! First let me say that I've never baked cookies from scratch so I didn't have any idea what I was doing but they came out perfect!! I halved the recipe and used a tiny bit more vanilla than it called for. I also read some of the reviews (thanks folks for sharing your wisdom) and made sure the butter was super soft. I made three batches of six so I could experiment. I made one plain, one with pieces of a Hershey's chocolate bar mixed in, and one with Cadbury mini-eggs. All came out perfect. Thanks for this recipe. Definetely going to make these again!!"
"0","5","I just made these for the first time and they are great. They have just the right amount of sugar to make them sweet. I did add a little bit more vanilla than it said too but not much. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and easy recipe that still tastes really good."
"0","5","Wow! These are awesome! I didn't have butter, so I used 1 cup of butter flavored Crisco instead (plus 2 TBS of water). I was worried about how they would turn out, but they were great; crispy around the edges, soft in the middle, and good flavor. I can't wait to try them again when I actually have the ingredients the recipe calls for. I'm sure they'll be even more delicious!"
"0","3","These were okay. I thought they had an odd taste to them. Everyone at work said they were good though. Might try to make again."
"0","5","I add cocoa powder and chocolate chips! Yum!!"
"0","3","I made these but used Shortening and they were dry. I added 1/4 cup maple syrup and some chopped pecans and they were like shortbreads. Only 3 stars cause I had to doctor them up."
"0","4","I just made these because i was limited on ingredients and they are great! i rolled the dough in sugar and then baked them and i will be making them again!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing and chewy!! and yummy!!!!"
"0","5","awesome cookies they are really good just don't make the balls too big and space them out evenly"
"0","4","I thought this recipe was pretty good. I added anise because I like more flavor than a traditional sugar cookie. That was the only change I made. This was great because it was so incredibly simple. It's a great recipe for days when I don't feel like doing much, but still need some sweetness in my life. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but I basically ate the whole thing myself over the course of three days. I do recommend carefully watching these, as only a few minutes too long, and you'll wreck it (as with any sugar cookie). I'll be keeping this one and making it again soon."
"0","5","This is a great and easy recipe. I always make more dough and shape it and store it in the refrigerator for when I need it. Whether it is for the kids or when company comes over. Everyone thinks this is a recipe handed down from generation to generation and are sheepish to ask me for the recipe! Many thanks!!! These are great frosted too! That is the way my kids like them. The adults, unfrosted!"
"0","5","I love this recipe I searched for weeks for a simple to make yet tasty recipe this is it."
"0","5","Well, we love these cookies! They are quick, easy, and taste great. Even my 4 year old cookie connoisseur loved them, even without sprinkles or frosting! They remind me of cookies I use to buy, as a kid, at the local Chinese carryout in our neighborhood.   I will agree they do spread allot. Give them room to grow. Also, I added a bit more vanilla then recommended. That was all I changed. The cookies are just right on the sweetness scale.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","2","They were below average taste-wise and when you pulled them apart they wouldn't come apart."
"0","5","Great easy recipe. My son has a dairy allergy so I love finding recipes with minimal dairy ingredients. I just replaced the butter with Earth Balance and they were a hit!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe, we have made these three times since finding it. :)"
"0","5","I love to make these using food coloring and flavored extracts for variety. (yellow- lemon, blue-vanilla, red- almond) Fun and delicious!"
"0","5","I made these for my little sister and she no longer eats any store bought sugar cookies!! Definitely a hit with the entire family- no icing needed!! GREAT RECIPE!!!"
"0","5","To all the people who thought the dough was too crumbly; they turned out perfectly fine. These were awesome! :D"
"0","5","I'm a nanny for two boys ages 7 and 10 who love to bake! We use this cookie recipe every time! But today we switched things up and used shortening in place of butter, and the cookies came out absolutely amazing!"
"0","4","Very very good. Doesn't even need frosting. These were perfectly sweetened. Not too strong, not too weak. I will definitely use this recipe again :D"
"0","5","These are fantastic just as written. The batter is easy to work with and they bake up to chewy perfection. I followed the recipe exactly, making sure that my butter was super-soft just as Rolanda's review suggested. I also chilled the batter for 1/2 hour before baking; I've found that this helps prevent spreading with almost all the cookies I make, so its become standard procedure for me now. These are yummy eaten plain, with sprinkles, or even with icing. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"0","5","Honestly, these are the best homemade sugar cookies I have yet to taste! I absolutely the advice of the reviewer who said to MAKE SURE your butter is extremely soft before mixing with sugar. I also added an extra half tsp of vanilla. These taste like they are from Pot Bellies! VERY GOOD, not messy at all, and easy to roll. I highly recommend!"
"0","1","I followed all the instructions to make these cookies. the first time I though I probably mixed the ingredients for to long so I mixed all the ingredients together for the second time and got the same results. in the oven they grew and then flattened after just 8 min. I also thought they were to greesy and.tasteless"
"0","5","A great & fast recipe. Substituted turbinato sugar and they came out great!"
"0","5","Awesome cookie, a couple of additions. First we crushed up three normal sized candy canes and mixed them in for a candy cane cookie. The other slight variation was balling them up in a mini muffin pan, just after they are out of the oven put in the center a candy cane kiss. AWESOME any way you try it, enjoy."
"0","4","These cookies are absolutely amazing but just make sure you put in enuogh butter and have it fully melted because once you get to the bottom, you'll find that the dough gets really dry and crumbly that it's almost impossible to use. Also DO NOT overcook cause it gets hard after an hour or so of being out of the oven even if it looks too soft when you are taking it out of the oven! Otherwise very tasteful and super easy to make(firstcookies i made without a parent help! :) )"
"0","5","the dough was really easy to work with didnt take long to make at all! i backed them for 8 minutes and they where amazing!"
"0","5","It's GREAT!! I made it as a christmas gift for the Janitor at school.. He liked it! Thank you!!"
"0","4","Great cookie, and SUPER easy! I added 1/2t of cinnamon and 1t of nutmeg and they tasted great."
"0","5","The best sugar cookies I've tasted in years!!! Reminds me of my grandmothers cookies...so soft & chewy. Easy & delicious"
"0","5","These are the easiest and best sugar cookies I have ever made. They may seem a little dry but all you have to do is roll them up in a ball and work with them a little. Love them!! I made them for my neighbors and friends at church and they rave about them!"
"0","4","These sugar cookies are simple and delicious! I will definitely make them again. I only gave 4 stars though because I wish they were a little softer."
"0","5","delicious and easy to make!!!"
"0","4","I found these to seem a little dry- but turned out good. I had to take off my wedding ring and knead the dough with my fists. I also had to bake these for 12 minutes for them to even become slightly brown on the bottom. The cookies still taste amazing. I dipped the balls into different colored sugars for Christmas and I also made a pan with cranberries on top-- YUM!! I will make these again."
"0","3","Not what I was expecting. followed recipe to a 'T' and they were flat. Including letting buter sit at room temperature all afternon. Nice flavor, but I could have gotten the same result with a tube at the grocery store. Will continue my search for the ultimate sugar cookie....... EDIT: Found out oven was left at 350 degrees from last cookies I baked. Also refrigerated the dough between batches seemed to help. They were a little more puffy. Still not perfectly satisfied."
"0","5","The Best EVER!! Realy!!! I absolutly LOVED them! They tasted good and were so easy to make! No cooling! Small but the right size!"
"0","5","This is the second time I do these sugar cookies and I have to say I LOVE THEM! They are delicious and so easy and fast to make. My son loves them too!"
"0","4","This is super easy to make and the dough works well with my cookie press as well as cookie cutters. The taste is good - not great - but the ease of preparing and the ingredient list makes it a 4."
"0","5","This is definitely my new go-to cookie recipe! They are so easy, delicious, and versatile. Just make sure the butter is melted, like other reviews have noted."
"0","5","Very simple and good"
"0","5","Very good! I just used margarine instead of butter and added another tsp of vanilla. I then rolled into balls(about tbsp size), using a lil' powdered sugar to keep dough from sticking. I then used the bottom of a pilsner glass coated w/ colored sugar to smoosh the cookies down. It made nice size cookies that were great!! Thanks!"
"0","2","The taste good ,but a little too hard and crunchy for my taste."
"0","5","Easy recipe and delicious!!"
"0","4","These are really tasty little cookies. The only issue I had was that they all turned out somewhat hard after baking them. (My butter had been sitting out for over a day, so I know it wasn't that.) It was probably because they were kind of thin when I made them. (I made shaped sugar cookies.) Either way, everyone quite liked them!"
"0","5","I absolutly love this recipe, it's perfect!!!! It's easy and quick and everyone should have most of the ingredients in their kitchen. Do follow the 8 minute baking rule, and make sure the butter in very very soft. My cookies came out kind of small, but for me that's okay :D. Do try this, Awesome!!!!"
"0","5","oh my GOSH!!! Best sugar cookies ever! I was a little reluctant but they're totally awsome =)"
"0","5","Tasty and chewy! Super easy to make. I read the reviews and I completely agree with Rolanda below. Use soft butter, and I used 2 tsp vanilla instead of one. Will be making these again and again."
"0","5","very easy and delicious."
"0","5","just made these for 5 girls to decorate. Well, they ate as many as they decorated. Quick, easy and tasty."
"0","5","these were great. added a little of milk and 2 tsp of vanilla. going to use these again and again"
"0","4","These were easy and yummy! They were a perfect combination of slightly crunchy outside and soft inside (even the next day.) My only complaint was they were very flat. That may have been me and my new mixers fault though. Overall these are terrific."
"0","5","2 teaspoons of vanilla, mush margarine and 8.5 to 9 minutes. PERFECT! I too have been looking forever for sugar cookies. Done looking :)"
"0","4","Tasted great and were really fast to make. :)"
"0","4","good cookies, could have been a tad more sweeter but i would make these again."
"0","5","These were great! And, yes, the key is to soften the butter completely. Also wish the directions had specified to coat the dough balls in sugar before baking."
"0","5","Best sugar cookie in the whole world. They are as simple as pie. by: Jillian"
"0","5","Just made these tonight for my kids. They loved them!! They said they were better than their great aunt's which is a BIG compliment! They were very soft and light. I actually only did 1/4 of the recipe, so I had to use 1/4 of an egg, which I think I had a little extra in there, but they really came out just fine."
"0","5","These are my boyfriend's favorite cookie. I love them too! So easy to make and as long as the butter is really soft they come out great."
"0","5","I made these cookies last night and they are so simple but have such a wonderful buttery flavor!!! After I had already started making them I realized I didn't have any vanilla extract so I substituted 1 tsp of grated lemon zest and that gave them a really light flavor!! This is certainly a keeper."
"0","5","This is the recipe my mom used when we were kids for cut outs. The only difference is that my mom used powdered sugar instead of white sugar and of course refrigerated the dough so we could use cookie cutters. With some butter frosting to decorate THESE ARE THE MOST DELICIOUS AND FUN SUGAR COOKIES EVER! :) Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Great recipe! My wife was impressed I could make these so easily at home. On the second batch, we rolled them in a cinnamon/sugar mix to make a nice and easy snickerdoodle."
"0","2","The mix was so dry it couldn't be rolled flat to cut out shapes. They tasted ok but won't use this recipe again."
"0","5","Great cookies! Turned out just like the pictures! I love how these sugar cookies actually have a sugary flavor. usually I do not taste much sugar in other recipes. Fast/Easy! Recommend!"
"0","5","Thank you for this quick and simple recipe!! it;s a big hit in my house. i have never had any problems, and I love the simplicity of the recipe. I use 2 tsp vanilla instead, but I just love vanilla. I also love going back and forth from butter to margerine for a little difference. Thanks again!!"
"0","4","This recipe was really good, but as previous users have stated, the dough turned out really crumbly! I even followed the suggestion to make the butter entirely melty. The cookies turned out perfect, but the dough was definitely difficult to work with."
"0","5","Super easy, a fantastic Christmas cookie! Ive tried many others and this one melts in your mouth!"
"0","4","Needs about a half cup more sugar and a quarter cup more butter but all in all a very yummy soft sugar cookie recipe."
"0","5","these cookies are so good and delicous"
"0","1","Easy, yes. I softened the butter as written and suggested by other reviewers, and followed the recipe, but these cookies are hard as a rock and the batter is dry, even though they had not reached 'golden' yet."
"0","4","I am a good cook not great yet so I was looking for an easy receipe I could use to surprise my family for Thanksgiving while not having to buy any extra ingredients. I just wanted to use things I already had in my home. This receipe is perfect and easy!!!! I had NEVER made cookies before but i just followed the instructions and saw what other people had to say. Please, please wait for your butter to become soft and use 2 generous teaspoons of vanillla extract -- not one. Also, and maybe this is just me using a teaspoon size ball didn't work for me. The cookies were good but too small. I used a tablespoon-sized portion and spread it out evenly and that worked fine and you had a better proportioned cookie. I will most definitely use this recepie again. My mom, dad, and bro loved them. The cookies made this a Thanksgiving to remember!"
"0","5","OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!! These are honestly the best cookies I have EVER had. I am a beginning baker. I don't do it often but am learning to do it more! WOW! They were so easy and I can't get over how great they tasted!!!!!!! My husband and all the neighbors LOVED them :)"
"0","5","I make cookies every year at Christmas and I'm always looking for good cookie recipes.This one is a winner.I made it the other night and my family is crazy about them.We are making them right now.My husband said to never lose this recipe."
"0","5","I made these tonight it was delicious. Easy simple and no fancy ingredients."
"0","5","I've made sugar cookies before but this recipe was simple & delicious! I did add an extra tsp. of vanilla extract. Used my pampered chef large round stone & they were perfect. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","4","Easy and fast. Just sweet enough. Great with a bit of cinnamon."
"0","5","This is the first time I've ever baked sugar cookies! They came out perfectly! By reading all the reviews, I had an idea of what not to do, and what to do... considering my oven is an older model, I did put it under the 350 degree marker. I softened the butter in the microwave in 10 second intervals. And instead of one of those $200.00 mixers, I simply used the 'old fashioned' way--my hands. I made sure the dough was close to room temperature before putting them on the cookie sheet... I used parchment paper on the sheets, don't know if this made a difference, but it worked for me! Put them in for about 9 minutes, and voila, perfect little sugar cookies! Unlike some of the reviews, my sugar cookies didn't spread at all... perfectly round, and tiny! Very easy for the novice, like me! Enjoy!"
"0","5","Great sugar cookie's This may be helpful to get really fluffy cookies. I used 1 cup of Hellmanns Mayo instead of butter or margarine and the cookies turned out great and yummy. Then to make them look really Christmasie add about 5 drops of green food coloring and add red sprinkles on top. They wont last a day in your house!"
"0","5","I've made these about 10x since I found this recipe. Super easy, SUPER YUMMY, and I usually always have all the stuff to make them without making a trip out to the store. LOVE THEM! YUMMY!"
"0","4","A very easy recipe that needed just a little modification. Please keep in mind that I am at 5280 ft altitude, but after following directions, I had a crumbly mess that even my 3 year old said 'uh-oh' to. I added two more eggs in a desperate attempt to do something with the crummy mess and that solved the problem quickly. Delicious cookies and a happy toddler."
"0","5","Easy and Delicious....we will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","Super easy recipe!!! Turned out 'professional' looking since I used a commercial ice cream type scoop! I had to bake them for about 12 minutes in my oven."
"0","5","I have never joined a website to rate a recipe but this cookie is so sweet, soft, and easy to make I had to comment. Please give it a try! The best!"
"0","5","My favorite sugar cookie recipe. Cookies turned out extremely soft. I used margarine instead of butter."
"0","5","Awesome! Not Kidding! I've made dozens of sugar but this one was the best! I know lots of people are having trouble with the butter part, well here's a good tip microwave the butter for 10-20 seconds. It makes the butter soft but not to soft."
"0","5","These cookies were excellent. I followed the recipe to the T and had great results. I have dark cookie sheets and have an issue with my cookie bottoms buring or getting very dark and these cookies did not, the cooked perfectly. I did have to leave them in slightly longer because I believe I made larger cookies but I will keeping this recipe and using it again."
"0","5","These are the easiest and most delicious sugar cookies I have ever tasted, the dough is great for using cookie cutters. This receipe is easy and fun to make with the kids as well. Iv'e tried many suar cookie receipes this is the greatest by far. The picture does'nt do these cookies justice, the are soooooooooooo yummy. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING."
"0","5","Very easy and extremely delicious! I read the other reviews before starting and let the butter get good and mushy. Turned out perfectly. Still deliciously chewy four days later too. My kids love them."
"0","5","The recipe is easy and cookies are yummy :)"
"0","5","They were VERY easy to make. My 13 year old daughter made them and they were fabulous! She is making another batch today!"
"0","4","Really easy! :) I had to make sure I took them out of the oven right away. The first batch smelled a little bit like burnt popcorn, but maybe it was the butter I used?"
"0","5","I made these cookies for the family not too long ago, and they DESTROYED them: each person had about 2-3 cookies each, but by morning, more than half were mysteriously gone, lol. the only thing I did different was I added a teensy bit more vanilla extract and sugar (on the sweet side, I know, but I had a major sweet tooth that night). thank you so much for this super easy recipe!"
"0","5","Wow, you guys are right! i wouldn't exactly call making any cookies 'easy', but these have a fabulous texture: I can't stop eating them! I added some cocoa powder and a splash of milk to the mix. I am afraid to make cookies because I have a wonky oven, but I followed the reviews, took them out soft, and they crisped up perfectly."
"0","5","I really like these cookies. They are easy to make and good. I found out if you bake for another 7 minutes it tastes better. try it."
"0","5","Great Recipe! I have never really liked sugar cookies, but after I made these I realized what I have been missing!!! They are so easy to make also, which is a great bonus!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and they are delicious!!"
"0","5","WOW! That is all I have to say! I make them once a month and everyone in my house LOVES them! No need to add or adjust anything here because it is PERFECT! Well, maybe just a little cinnamon sugar sprinkled on the top, but overall just a great recipe!"
"0","5","Quick tip for those who have butter in the fridge and need to make these cookies quick. Grate the butter, it softens it up. I'm not sure if it'll make it soft enough for this recipe, but it is a quick way to soften the butter."
"0","5","These cookies are so tasty! This is my go-to cookie recipe. It's made of ingredients I usually have laying around, and it doesn't take very long."
"0","5","These are yummy and easy to make! I rolled each cookie in colored sugar before putting on the cookie sheets and it worked great!"
"0","5","simply delicious!"
"0","5","The cookies are great. I ran out of baking soda, so I used 3 tsp of baking powder instead. They turned out great! Also, I heard some people complain about the consistancy of the dough. I let the butter soften on the counter for about an hour and a half and it worked great. Easily rolls into balls or flattens for cutting."
"0","5","very good! I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavor crisco..... also swapped the vanilla for almond extract. Baked 10 min. 1 thing though... SALT SALT SALT!!!! Cakes and cookies NEED salt to properly bring out the sweet. I added 1/2 tsp."
"0","5","Awesome cookies! So easy and perfect my husband ate them all in 2 days:-) I added an extra tsp of vanilla and made sure the butter was extremely soft almost melted and these cookies were chewy and melted in your mouth."
"0","5","AWESOME."
"0","4","Great in a pinch with few ingredients"
"0","5","This is definitely a great sugar cookie recipe! I baked them a few minutes longer and they turned out perfect. I also used the sugar cookie frosting recipe on here and they were perfect together!"
"0","5","Excellent and easy! This is one of the few times I've ever baked cookies from scratch and they turned out AWESOME! Thank you."
"0","4","the texture made me nervous at first, the dough seemed very crumbly and i was worried that it wasn't going to roll out well because i'd planned to use cookie cutters. but i added a few tablespoons of water to the finished dough, separated it into two balls, wrapped them in saran wrap and then put it in the fridge to chill for about 45 minutes. the final results were delicious. also, i pulled my cookies out at 7 minutes just to be on the safe side and they came out perfect. that my just be my old, finicky oven though!"
"0","5","Made these last night and they were great. Super easy and quite a nice texture. Best part--I didn't have to go buy anything for them!! The one reviewer is right though, it's all about the butter. I let mine sit out for a couple hours and the batter was like velvet. 8 minutes wasn't quite long enough for my exact tablespoon-sized cookies, I think I'd go for 9 next time."
"0","1","I thought 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda sounded like a lot but with all the good reviews I decided to stick to the recipe to my disappointment. These are baking soda tasting cookies that are way too sweet:("
"0","5","I was looking for a reciepe for easy sugar cookies without butter and found this recipe. I followed the recipe, but I add cinimmon leon pink food coloring and a 1/2 cup more sugar than what it called for. I tried doing the cookie dough by teaspoon and they came out really small that was the first 2 1/2 dozen. So I did the rest by tablespoon and they turn out better. They turned out soft, chewy, moist and not dry. My daughter even liked them. She said that this recipe was a keeper. She even wanted me to make more, but I told her another day and to put blue food coloring in them the next that is what she surjusted. The dough was soft and glossy and good to eat. Bake these cookies for 8 mintues not 10 they will turn out softer than cooking them for 10 mintues and put 2 teaspoons villina instead of 1 teaspoon it turns out sweeter and also and teaspoon of orange exact it gives it more flavor I have found or any flavor you want. I give this recipe 5 stars. It was that good and delightiful. Alice"
"0","5","This is now my go to recipe. Easy, and very good."
"0","3","pretty hard and flat...my butter was really soft too. maybe my baking powder and soda need replacing..."
"0","5","Easy to make yummy cookies! followed recipe and added lemon tart ontop!!!"
"0","5","This is the first review I have ever posted, but I had to comment on these cookies ... they are DELICIOUS and very easy!! Thanks for the suggestion to keep the butter very soft. That worked like a charm. We pressed little chocolate mints in the top while the cookies were still warm. Yum yum! This recipe is definitely a keeper."
"0","5","We love these cookies! It's such a versatile recipe that you can add any additional ingrediant!"
"0","5","These were really good. I didn't have trouble with the batter and I used a cookie dough scooper which made it super easy."
"0","5","I love these cookies. I even added a little cinnamon and extra sugar on top. DELICIOUS"
"0","5","Delicious and super simple! Boosted my confidence in baking. My housemates approved, as well."
"0","5","I normally dislike sugar cookies because of the shortning taste so these were fab. I cooked them for 8 min exactly and the are just the right texture for decorating and taste. I followed the recipe to the T."
"0","5","Awesome and so simple!!"
"0","5","I'd probably make them a little sweeter next time but I just like really sweet cookies otherwise they turned out perfect!"
"0","5","I loved these cookies, they were easy to make and they taste wonderful. I was able to mix them by hand didn't even need my mixer."
"0","5","I like mine really soft and chewy so I baked them for about 7 minutes. Great consistency and flavor!!"
"0","5","Fast, easy, and delicious!"
"0","5","Wonderful! I doubled the vanilla just as others suggested and they were great!"
"0","5","This is my go to sugar cookie recipe. My grandpa loves sugar cookies, and he is always requesting a batch of these. They are super easy and always come out great! They don't usually last more than a day thanks to the kids! Yummmmm!"
"0","4","The cookies were great. My daughter sprinkled sugar on them and they were very good. My only complaint is that at the end, the batter got crumbly, however, in the end, they were delicous."
"0","5","my family really enjoys this easy sugar cookie recpie. I use it for the base to make other kinds of cookies."
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies I've ever had. And they are so easy to make. I sprinkled some sugar on top and ate them while they were still warm and soft. Delicious!"
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic! So easy and delicious. I love to take baked goods to work with me, and I was in a hurry today and this recipe was EXACTLY what I was looking for. Thanks so much!"
"0","5","I liked these cookies so did everyone else when I made them for a business get together. I used softened margarine and as for the flavorings I put in half a tablespoon of cinnamon and a tsp each of almond and vanilla. They came out great and with plenty of flavors to keep our guests enjoy multiple complexities of favor. Delicious."
"0","5","This recipe is great! I make these sugar cookies all the time, and my family always loves them! They taste great with cinnamon sugar sprinkles on top, or with a little bit of chocolate in the middle. I never have trouble with these cookies, and the consistency is always right. Also, you don't really need baking experience to make them. This was the first time I'd made cookies from scratch, and they turned out just as great as any other time I'd made them. You can also stick any leftover cookie dough (if you don't feel like making all the cookies at once) in a container and put it in the refrigerator. Just warm the dough up a little bit and then follow the baking instructions. They taste great!"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","Quick, easy and delicious exactly as is. Couldn't stop eating these! Thanks!"
"0","5","Very easy recipe and they turned out delicious!"
"0","5","Easy and chewy, I added 1 extra egg to the recipe! Rolled them in powder sugar before baking too. Yums"
"0","5","These are good cookies.Add some Royal Icing on them and you will have really fancy cookies."
"0","5","To die for cookies. I used Organic Whole Wheat Flour instead of all-purpose flour and they turned out just as GREAT!!!! Very soft and sweet!!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. I found it on allrecipes and printed it then gave it to my 12 year old daughter to make. She made them all by herself. They are soft and very yummy. We frosted ours and put sprinkles...Thanks for the great recipe"
"0","4","These cookies were definitely easy to make. But the taste wasn't too good. Overall they are okay."
"0","5","This cookie recipe was very easy to follow and the cookies were great! I sprinkled confectioner sugar on top on one batch and also a strawberry preserve on another for a different taste. It was delicious! Also I will like to thank the other reviews for mentioning not to leave the cookies over 8 mins. I followed that time and every batch came out perfect!"
"0","5","Great recipe..easy. I use whole wheat flour instead. Comes out delicious :)"
"0","5","I just made this recipe & it turned out great! My kids love them! The only thing I changed was that I had no vanilla so i used almond extract instead & they still taste great!"
"0","5","A great simple sugar cookie. Doubled well."
"0","5","Super easy and super delicious! Can not say how much i love making these! I also add M&M's and sometimes use almond extract instead of vanilla for something different!"
"0","5","These are thee BEST sugar cookie recipe ever! I especially like that I don't need to refrigerate the dough! I just end up eating it raw instead of baking the cookies."
"0","5","I thought this recipe was a hit!! I made a batch and cooked them for 8 minutes exactly and they turned out awesome!! One thing I did differently was put 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of one. It gave them more flavor, I thought. Two thumbs up!! :D"
"0","5","I love it. It tastes so good, and it's so easy to make!"
"0","5","Wow! These cookies turned out wonderfully! I changed up the original recipe because I had very limited ingredients in the house...So I changed the servings to 32 (odd number I know) and used the measurements provided. However, after delving into the recipe, I realized that I had no vanilla...So I decided to experiment a little. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to the dry mix, as well as about 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, just to be sure it had some flavor. When it came to the butter/sugar mixture, I took another reviewers recommendation and let the butter get mushy on its own, it worked out great! the 'batter' was light and fluffy after about 2 minutes of beating it with a whisk. I also added the rest of the powdered sugar that I had, approximately 2 more teaspoons. Now for the odd part, and I'm not sure it really did a lot besides making the batter fluffier....I added about 2 Tablespoons of Redi-Whip! Mixed it all together, added the dry mix about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup at a time until I couldn't whisk it anymore and switched to a wooden spoon with a hole in it. It was pretty dry at that point, so I added a splash of milk (approx. 1-2 Tablespoons) and another teaspoon of 'mushy' butter. Let it cool in the freezer for half an hour, rolled in sugar, baked as instructed originally (8 minutes) and voila! A tasty 'twist' on these Easy Sugar Cookies, via some random ingredients. If I had had enough powdered sugar left I would have made frosting...lol"
"0","5","Probably the best sugar cookies i've ever had! I made them for a bake sale at my school. and they were the first to go out of everything! They were wanting more the next day!"
"0","5","Awesome cookies! Melted butter (not margarine) used 2 tsp vanilla and rolled in sugar before baking! Bake for 9 minutes - cool for 2 and viola! you have the BEST Sugar cookie EVER!"
"0","5","Best sugar cookies ever! I changed it a bit though and added another half teaspoon of vanilla because it looked dry and came out great! Only cooked for 8 mins was super soft when came out and still is! A couple of batches came out slightly crunchier but that's because I only have 2 cookies sheets and kept using them so the cookies were cooking faster...took it down to cooking for 6 minutes and cookies were soft again."
"0","5","At first I was apprehensive. They weren't spreading out when they were baking, and I thought it was a dud recipe. Was I ever wrong. I baked them till they were just slightly golden brown on top (approx 12-14 min) and they were AMAZING. Best sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried. I threw in a teaspoon of almond extract for extra flavour. Delish."
"0","5","These were very easy and my husband loved them!! The only thing I did different was roll the ball of dough in sugar, coating it all the way around."
"0","5","SIMPLY THE BEST! Don't be afraid to use SMART BALANCE butter. I used SMART BALANCE butter and cooked them 8 min. They turned out perfect!"
"0","5","I mixed all the ingredients before realizing I didn't have baking soda(which I think makes cookies flat). They still came out awesome, and they were nice and high..very simple and quick recipe..will def make again."
"0","5","So QUICK and EASY. Delicious too. I use margarine and they are soft every time."
"0","5","Love these cookies!!! I roll them in coconut, mini choc chips, sprinkles, they are sooo versitile!! I am on my 4 batch in 2 weeks!! Today I am trying with m&ms and maybe some jam!!!!!!"
"0","5","Super easy and soft! I melted my butter completely and they came out great. Really expands while baking."
"0","5","Just made these cookies. They are so sweet and my mom loves them. They came out great. I rolled them in sugar before I put them in oven just like someone said below. They are excellent. I give it a 5 stars. Thanks for adding this excellent recipe. No complications or nothing."
"0","5","Just as the title says - EASY. Very good... delicious with coffee."
"0","5","I'm always looking for a good sugar cookie recipe and this one far exceeded my expectations. They were exactly as they said, a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! When you are done mixing them, they look crumbly and I didnt' know how they would turn out, but don't worry, they roll into balls quite nicely. They couldn't come out of the oven fast enough for the kiddos :) Sampled one and felt I needed to write a review they were that good (too bad I'm on a diet)"
"0","5","came out absolutely perfect, i love this recipe, going to use this for some of the cookies in my daughter's baby shower and add blue sugar crystals....it's a boy. lol"
"0","5","I loved these cookies... very similar to some chocolate chip cookies I make, without the chips. I did subsitute a half cup of brown sugar for half cup of the white sugar. Very yummy. I am getting ready to make these right now, and I am going to try rolling them in cinnamon/sugar."
"0","5","I did exactly like the recipe said and the cookies came out wonderful! One thing i had little issues with was the batter was a little sticky,but that's when the refriderator steps in :3 I have made these on 4 separate occasions and i plan to keep using this recipe.Sprinkles make a colorful and tasty touch ;)"
"0","5","I agree that this is the best sugar cookie recipe. I partially melted the butter and that made the dough come together really easily without being dry and crumbly. I also used lemon extract instead of vanilla and it was terrific. Cooking time of 10 minutes in my oven is perfect. These are very versatile and I have also added cocoa powder to the recipe substituting it for some of the flour. Good with add-ins like candies or nuts and also good frosted with confectioners sugar glaze."
"0","5","This recipe was not only super easy to make, but was absolutely DELICIOUS. I made these for some friends, and they were nearly gone within the hour. Definitely will use this recipe again."
"0","5","I have been making these cookies for a while now and they are awesome and so easy. I agree with the posts that say the butter needs to almost be melted for the dough to turn out right. I noticed there is a difference if you use salted or non salted butter or margarine. Each one makes the dough a little different. I prefer the salted butter overall.  I have learned it the dough is not firm enough to roll, stick it in the fridge for 5 or 10 minutes. These cookies are all the rave at work and they always ask me to bring them. I have rolled the balls in cinnamon and sugar which makes these the best SNICKERDOODLES ever!!!!"
"0","5","great recipe! i've made them twice already. the first time i scaled down the recipe b/c i only had one stick of butter, and they still came out great. both times i used brown sugar instead of white and almond extract instead of vanilla (half a teaspoon). i also created my own toppings as other reviewers have mentioned... i dipped them in cinnamon/brown sugar before baking and also put raisonettes or chopped walnuts on top after taking them out of the oven. so good!"
"0","5","These are excellent! I put vanilla frosting on top of the, which was a nice touch! :)"
"0","5","i loved them! they were really good and i was able to make alot of them with ease. even when i only made half a batch, i got lots of cookies and they all came out perfectly. i will definately be making these again in future. i also have someone in my family that has coeliac disease and i decided to change the flour to rice flour and i added a pinch of xanthum gum and they came out just as good as the original recipe with the normal flour. delicious!!"
"0","5","Delicious! I used margarine instead of butter due to preference. The mix was crumbly but I was still able to use it & make the cookies with no problem. They were huge & like I said delicious! I will make these again & again!"
"0","5","I love these cookies! I've made several batches so far and always follow the recipe as written. The trick is not to let them bake too long as there seems to be a fine line between chewy delicious cookie, and slightly overcooked hard cookie. Less is more, and I only cook them for 8 minutes, any longer and I have a less than delicious cookie!"
"0","5","Super delicious, super easy. I rolled them in cinnamon sugar to make snickerdoodles. Baked as directed, and made sure the butter was super soft (almost entirely melted). Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is a very good recipie. Its a good easy way to make sugar cookies but i added a liitle more flour to make them thicker. But it is a great recipie I love it!"
"0","4","Cookies came out good, used unsalted butter with 1/2 tsp. salt in batter, cookies cool to a nice crispy edge & chewy & soft when eaten. Quick & easy like it promised."
"0","4","i thought these were very tasty and easy to make, though to me they tasted a lot like shortbread rather than suger cookies. and like other comments said, the state of the butter is very important to the outcome of the cookies. make sure its very soft, mostly melted. it will make them so much softer."
"0","5","These cookies were the best sugar cookies I have had. They did not last more thann the evening I made them because they were devoured! They were tender in the middle, which everybody loves. My son is severely allergic to eggs so we used egg replacer powder instead of the egg and they turned amazing. Thanks! I will be making these again tomorrow!"
"0","5","Made with Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips--it was a fantastic recipe. I put the batter in the refrigerator for 10 mins after making/before spooning onto the cookie shape and it kept from spreading too far/burning on the bottom. Really great cookies!"
"0","3","Sugar cookies are my husbands FAVORITE so he's been begging me to make homemade ones for a while so I tried this recipe. They are not the best cookies but they definitely aren't the worst. A noticed some people said their dough was crumbly so I beat my sugar and butter with a mixer and my dough was definitely not brittle but it was extremely sticky. I had add extra flour throughout the whole time of trying to roll the cookies into balls, I probably used an extra 1/2-3/4 cup of flour. I did have to cook them for a little longer than suggested but only a few extra minutes. I also rolled mine in sugar before cooking. Make sure you put them on the cookie sheet far from each other!! They will spread a lot! My husband said they don't really taste like cookies, more like a cake mixture. Not horrible but will not make again!"
"0","5","Just what I was looking for! A delicious cookie that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. My kids are crazy about them. I live at 6,000 feet and didn't have to make any adjustments for the altitude. I did chill the dough for a couple of hours before baking. Then I shaped the dough into balls and my son dipped them in sprinkles. I did bake them on parchment paper and removed them from the oven at 9 minutes even though they just had a slight hint of browning. The edges stayed nicely rounded and the consistency was perfect."
"0","5","Super easy and delicious!"
"0","5","Sometimes I roll the dough balls in sugar sooo good. ive been putting M&Ms in the mix too. they taste like store bought cookies!"
"0","5","My sugar recipe search is complete. Like Whoa!"
"0","5","These were wonderful, I added crush pecans in the mix,,yum"
"0","5","Perfect Sugar cookies! Turned out just like I like them. Thanks for the recipe"
"0","4","All friends love these delicious cookies! They need to be kept in a sealed container to keep from drying out."
"0","5","Great recipe. I took some of the advice from the others: make sure the butter is soft, add more vanilla extract and decrease flour. With that advice, they came out just the way I wanted them to: thin, a little crunchy on the ends but soft in the middle. Yummy!"
"0","5","Ive done this recipe many times and it keeps getting better!!!!"
"0","2","after i read the reviews it seemed like not having them soft enough would make them come out dry and flavourless. so i went a step further and melted the butter, adding the sugar as i went over medium heat, making careful not to caramelize it or anything. i followed the rest of the recipe accordingly. i experienced the same problem as others, which is disappointing to say the least. their is a faint after taste of sugar, and i can taste it in the back of my mouth afterwards, but when they first go in, they're really floury. they are too crumbly to mush down afterwards, and the batter was way to crumbly to mush it down prior to cooking. i have no idea how to change to make this any better than others have said. but honestly, why would you try to make something that isn't very good your own? i wouldn't want my name on these cookies. overall, i'll eat them. they aren't inedible, but then again, i'm a guy, and if it is dipped in beer anything tastes good to me. rating: prep:3 once cooked:2 fortaste:1 aftertaste:2 average: 2 stars"
"0","5","Mmmm. These are simply yummy and so fast. Will make these again soon. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","YUMMY...The best-tasting sugar cookie recipe I've ever made."
"0","5","Tasty and quite easy to make"
"0","5","Very easy. These are the best! I LOVE them!It has become a new Christmas tradition in our house."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! Mine fell due to the wrong kind of butter, but they still came out tasting A-MA-ZING! I cannot wait until I bake these again for my best friend's baby shower~"
"0","5","This is a super easy and very tasty recipe, but i like the texture of 'The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' better. I will use this one for times when i don't want to put as much effort into getting a great tasting sugar cookie."
"0","5","Great cookies and like the recipe states they are very easy to make. My husband said that they are they are the best sugar cookies I've ever made."
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","I made these gluten free with my own gluten free all purpose blend. They were wonderful. I added about 1 T. almond extract and rolled in sugar. I will make these again!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe to a T - perfect cookies!"
"0","5","Made these for the first time yesterday. made heart shaped for Valentines day turned out great. Very easy to make."
"0","5","These cookies turned out perfect and no kidding were they easy!"
"0","3","These were pretty good but were WAY too sweet if you are adding frosting. These cookies stand alone pretty well, but are almost sickeningly sweet with frosting on them. I do love that you don't have to roll these. Mine came out looking picture perfect and golden brown on the bottom, crunchy outside and soft inside. Out of three different sugar cookie recipes, these were the only ones that didn't get completely eaten."
"0","5","Super fast & easy to make.....& delicious! I needed a quick recipe for Sugar Cookies that were to be frosted. These are good enough to eat plain and even better with the frosting! Great recipe:)"
"0","5","awesome"
"0","4","pretty good! baked well! i added the jam in the middle and tried rolling them in sugar. i think that they would be best plain and great for frosting or decorating! overall tasty cookie and super easy to make!"
"0","5","My daughter & I used this recipe....we loved them, as did the rest of our family. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe : )"
"0","5","these sugar cookies were DELICIOUS!!!! to make them less hard though, it was easier to melt the butter+ use less flour:). it made them thin and great!!!! I made them with my friends and we couldnt stop eating them!!!"
"0","5","My husband and son go nuts for these. Son has food allergies and this recipe is simple to adapt and still a crowd-pleaser."
"0","4","I love this recipe. I didn't have any eggs, so I googled it and came up with this: one egg=2 tablespoons liquid (like water), 2 tablespoons flour, 1/2 tablespoon shortning, and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. There is only a little difference in taste, but it still tastes good! The dough was a little dry (I think it was because of the egg mixture deal) so I added a little milk. I'm not sure how much, just enough to make it a little stickier. And instead of rolling the dough balls in just plain sugar, I used cinnamon and sugar! They are super that way. Another trick I learned: use shortning (like crisco) instead of butter. It helps to keep your cookies soft and fluffy. Use that trick in any cookie recipe!"
"0","4","These cookies were very easy but tasted a little bland. I have made them with a little added coconut flavor which was pretty good, and with almond extract (they tasted like ice cream cones!) Everyone loved both versions, I recommend both."
"0","5","Probably really a 4.5, but I round up because I am at high altitude (5600 ft) and made a few changes to compensate. Added 1 extra Tbsp flour, cut the baking powder and soda nearly in half. Raised oven temp about 10 degrees. Also added more vanilla, but that is preference rather than adjusting for altitude. Are they the best sugar cookies I have ever had? No, but they are good and VERY easy. They browned beautifully too. Definitely a keeper! I found that if I partially flattened the cookie before baking I could have a crisper cookie. Flattening some and leaving some in balls made it almost like two different cookies."
"0","5","THE BEST SUGAR COOKIES EVER!!!!!!!!!! That's all I have to say!! Yummy!! =D"
"0","5","I had to come back and rewrite my review. Initially I gave it 3 stars because out of the oven, these cookies didn't taste right. My 6 year old wasn't impressed either. But the cookies the next day were delicious! I baked two batches, the first batch I baked for 8 minutes and the cookies came out really good and chewy. The second batch was timed for 9 minutes, and they were crunchy. This recipe is fantastic considering how simple it is!"
"0","4","I just made these cookies - very easy! Be warned that these can be messed up pretty easily, though. After the cooled off, they got a little hard.. so I recommend putting them in a ziploc bag or coving them on a plate with foil so that they don't harden. Also, don't over bake these! I baked mine for 8 minutes and they came out fine! Other than those 2 things, they are good!"
"0","4","These are great! Self rising flour works also! I would say that ten minutes is too long if you like softer cookies, but these are very simple, easy to make treats. I had the craving for cookies, and I had all of the ingredients in my kitchen! (If you do use self rising flour, don't use baking powder and soda)"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe! At first my dough was a bit crumbly but in the end it turned out. I haven't even gotten to baking the cookies since i've been munching the dough since I made it :)"
"0","5","This was great for my nieces and nephew to help me make. They were great!"
"0","5","Chewy and Delicious!"
"0","5","My family calls these cookies 'The best sugar cookies in the world.' I love these cookies so much! I made two trays and put them on different shelves in the oven. One tray came out looking beautiful and the other was flat and not very pretty. The next time i made them, I only put in one tray at a time and they came out much better. These are the only sugar cookies i make anymore."
"0","5","This is one of the best cookies I had. Since I am looking for something a bit crunchy, I bake at 350F for 16 min and it came out wonderful. The taste is great. I divided the dough into 2 batches, one I keep the original, the other I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla power and 1/2 cup of finely choped oatmeal. Both taste excellent. The second time around, I mixed a package of cream cheese, a can of condensed milk and 1/4 c of lemon juice. Put this cheese mixture in the center. Wow! To die for! Thank you so much the this recipe. It rocks!"
"0","5","I can only say what others have said: these are the easiest and best sugar cookies around! I recommend leaving them in the oven for a max of 8 min, if you like them soft after they've cooled."
"0","5","OMG! These cookies tasted great. It may have been my fault but they ended up being crunchy when they cooled (I used my cookie press and baked for 5 minutes) but wow they tasted great. I am definantly making these again."
"0","4","cookies tastes good and a very good recipe. my only problem seems to be that they always jet hard very quickly. dont know what im doing wrong."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. It was easy and tasted great. I suggest you cook for 9 minutes, because the cookies end up soft, but they are fully cooked. When I made these cookies, I ended up with 84 cookies instead of 48, and all of the cookies were about 5 inches in circumference, and I still had enough dough to make a giant cookie. But that only makes the recipe better! Thanks! :)"
"0","5","very easy"
"0","5","These are delicious! I discovered that I only had a little over a cup of white sugar when I started so went ahead and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make up the difference. They turned out wonderfully. :) Buttery and delicious. Far better than the roll we used to buy from the grocery store."
"0","4","I agree with a lot of the other posters that the cookies were good, but hardened very quickly. I made these and sent them to a soldier overseas, and by the time he got them, they were essentially the quality of hard tack... quite frustrating. The taste was good for the first few days, but after that, they should just be used when dipped in your morning coffee in lieu of a biscotti."
"0","4","These tasted great, but I had to refrigerate the dough overnight because I found the dough to be too sticky to use cookie cutter."
"0","4","This is my basic cookie starting point. I have tweaked this recipe with 1/2 tsp. of mint or almond extract, a Tsp. of cocoa powder, and even replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with whole wheat for a 'nuttier' flavor. As Rolanda points out let that butter turn to mush! Leave it out overnight if you have to. DO NOT try to cheat and soften the butter in the microwave. I tried that once and the cookies had a flat, almost rancid taste. Not good. Beyond that this recipe is pretty forgiving and tough to screw up."
"0","5","super easy & yummy! We added green frosting."
"0","5","Super easy, but you really need a mixer to make them turn out right. I also rolled the dough in sugar before baking and that made them even better!"
"0","4","I read the review that said the butter needs to be thoroughly soft or the batter ends up crumbly and dry. This happened to me as well. So I popped the entire bowl in the microwave for 10 seconds and then beat again and the batter was much better. The cookies came out exactly like the photo. Since I live at high altitude I added just a touch more flour and baked at 385 degrees for about 11 minutes. I may experiment as others suggested with some lemon, etc."
"0","5","These are so good they should be illegal. They came out perfect the very first time. My 10-year-old son said, 'Wow, all goodness in every cookie.'"
"0","5","The cookies turned out great, I didn't change anything in the recipe, they looked like there were store bought. One thing to watch out for is the kind of cookie sheet you use.When I used a air bake light color sheet, they turned out great. When I used a dark color sheet, the cookies were not spreading, they came out thicker, smaller and the bottom was too dark."
"0","3","Looks like good cookies but iv'e done it numerous times but they don't come out right but ive's suddenly decided to bake so im new to it my cookies come out smelling like eggs, molasess like i believe its the butter cookies have no base but fortunately on some occasions rare ones they came out right"
"0","4","needed a sugar cookie recipe that had a simple list of ingredients which this fits the bill. the cookies came out very tasty. thanks to whoever submitted the recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is so yummy! I use it every Christmas to make cookies to hand out to family and friends. (This year I made 12 dozen!) They all love these cookies too and say they're the best. I would definately recommend this recipe!"
"0","5","These were fantastic! Really easy to make and delicious. Made them last night for Santa but he only ended up getting 2 because all others were pretty much gone. Great recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies were easy to make and tasted great! I will definitely use this one in the future."
"0","5","These are really great, but I had to add almost an extra cup of flour, because the dough was so runny."
"0","1","these turned out really flat for me, but I see for others they did not. Not sure what I did wrong."
"0","5","I didn't follow the recipe exactly (substituted with brown sugar and did half vanilla extract and half almond extract) but they turned out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy inside. Just wonderful. My mom said this is the perfect cookie for her."
"0","5","These came out so much better than the last recipe I tried on here. The only thing different I did was bake em for 11 minutes, but only because I baked them on parchment paper. For some reason when I use partchment paper I have to bake things longer. I also did add extra vanilla extract. Only a 1/2 of tsp though. I melted the butter in the oven too because I just decided last minute to bake. Hours later they are still soft and I am hoping thats how they say. Chewy! Excellent recipe!! :-)"
"0","5","These were so light and fluffy, and not very filling (just what I wanted in an Xmas cookie!). I added some lemon juice and lemon zest for extra flavor."
"0","5","Easy to make and taste wonderful!"
"0","5","Very good! I cooked it for 8 mins..no longer! Also, I rolled the dough in a cinnamon/sugar mix. Yum Yum!!"
"0","5","These cookies are so easy and taste great! I used margarine instead of butter because that is what I had in the fridge and it worked well."
"0","5","These are the best!! Husband loves them, friends ate all of them in minutes, super easy and fast. Will never make another recipe."
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe!! I ddi not change a thing from the original ingredients and they came out great. 8 minutes gives the perfect chewy sugar cookie. Will make another batch tonight to ice and decorate. THANKS!!!!!"
"0","5","These cookies are incredibly easy to make and are really delicious. Mine came out more like wafers with browned edges and were very buttery. Definitely would make them again."
"0","5","Loved this recipe! Very easy, and taste just as good without frosting as they do with! Thanks!"
"0","5","I just made them yesterday and they were so good! They just melt in your mouth. I used real butter, but I plan on making another batch with margarine and see if they turn out as good. Warning: Once you eat one of these cookies it is almost impossible to stop eating them."
"0","5","These were so soft and delicious! Great because they just require ingredients you would usually have on hand, and you don't need to refrigerate or roll out the dough...so easy!"
"0","5","I made these with my little girls last night and we had a ball. Brought them to work and have had nothing but rave reviews. Great tasting and easy to make what more can one want?"
"0","5","Great recipe! These turned out really well. Everyone who tried them loved them. However, my girlfriend liked them, but said they tasted like shortbread. Another friend agreed. Not sure what to make of that, but I will definitely be using this again. Thanks!"
"0","4","Simple & delicious. I added 1/2 teaspoon more vanilla and dipped in different colored sugars."
"0","5","Perfection...."
"0","5","These were delicious and VERY soft. I was happy with this recipe and didn't change a thing"
"0","5","This was one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've used, I made royal icing to go along with it and it was the perfect sweetness!"
"0","5","All my friends love the cookies I make from this recipe."
"0","5","PERFECT! these are just what I was looking for! I'm not sure what some of you did wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly and they came out GREAT!"
"0","5","I love these cookies, and nineteen 5-yr olds in my class love them more! I'm supposed to make gingerbread men for a class activity but realized not all kids like ginger, so I made 2 batches of the dough and kept in fridge. Brought to school the next morning and the kids love free-moulding them into gingerbread man shapes (we didn't use cutters - much more fun!). These really expands (result: cute fat gingerbread men), and the taste is sooooo good. Oh, I used very soften margarine and reduced sugar to half. Perfect. Thanks for the recipe :)"
"0","5","Love these! So tasty and easy - my husband even made them, and that is saying a lot :)"
"0","4","These cookies are just like heaven. I am THE worst cooker/baker in the world and I can't believe how good these ended up being. My dough was a bit crumbly too at first but I kept going with the recipe and am so happy with the results. YUMMY! (I only gave it 4 stars because of the amount of butter and sugar. Seems a little too much for my own health.)"
"0","5","Truly easy, and very tasty! I discovered that I was out of vanilla extract, so used lemon juice instead, and they still came out wonderfully. I used a hand mixer to blend everything, and it did have a little bit of a hard time once all the flour was added, but in the end it was fine. My 3 year old daughter helped roll the cookies in colored sugar before we baked them, fun for all! I baked the cookies on insulated cookie sheets, and did leave them in just a little longer than 8 minutes, because they were too soft to put on the cooling rack. I baked one batch on a non-insulated pan, and they were perfect at 8 minutes!"
"0","5","Quick, easy and yummy! These looked like store bought cookies when they came out of the oven!"
"0","5","Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly. Best (and easiest) sugar cookies ever!"
"0","5","Amazing! I really loved this sugar cookie recipe and it was simple and easy to make. I made one addition and a few substitutions but mostly stuck to the basic recipe. Definitely take the advice of softening the butter before hand (I left it out for about 45-60 minutes before starting) - the cookies cake out so soft and delicious! Here are my substitutions and addition: 1 - 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 3/4 cup white flour 2 - 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup butter (would have used all margarine but I had some butter to use up) 3 - BIG ONE Added 1 tsp lemon extract, I think this really enhanced the flavor I cooked for 10 minutes with two cookie sheets in the oven (rotating shelves once) and 8 1/2 minutes with one cookie sheet. Husband tested and husband approved! He loves his desserts and didn't even know there was whole wheat flour in it! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone that wants a delicious, easy sugar cookie recipe. It is also good as a base to add candies, chocolate, or nuts too. I used this recipe in conjunction with the Pillsbury recipe for Peppermint Crunch Cookies - everyone at work loved them :) Enjoy"
"0","4","They were good but lacked some kind of flavor next time I will add something extra.but thanks for the recipe"
"0","2","I followed the recipe exactly and they didn't turn out too well. My husband loves sugar cookies but these were not to his liking."
"0","5","I love making these cookies! They are so easy and so cute when decorated with sprinkles! My family and my husbands family love them; and we're a picky bunch!"
"0","5","These came out great! As the other reviewers said, I would recommend baking these closer to 8 minutes than 10 and also make sure you leave the butter out to soften."
"0","2","these were fine right out of the oven but hard and buttery the next day, very unpalletable. I don't know what went wrong but i did these up right."
"0","5","I made these sugar cookies for school for a powerpoint presentation and they were very good. Everybody in my class commented on them and even a the teachers who got one."
"0","5","awesome!"
"0","5","The best cookies ever! Super easy. My pickiest eater (10 yrs old) loved them."
"0","5","These cookies are so easy to make and super tasty."
"0","5","AMAZING!!! I made this recipe 4 times in three weeks!"
"0","4","I signed up jus coz i wantd 2 write a review... :) i've nevamade sugar cookies b4... they r so yummy nd perfect!! thnq Stephanie!!"
"0","5","Sooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","3","These were okay. I was hoping for a little more with all the great reviews. They are not soft cookies; they are crisp. I think adding a little salt might have helped, but I didn't enjoy the flavor very much. It was kind of bland. My search for the best sugar cookies continues."
"0","5","Excellent cookies and very easy to make in less than 15 minutes!"
"0","1","these cookies tasted like popcorn not happy with the out come but nice try"
"0","4","I have to agree with Rolanda. Make sure that the sugar is very soft and extra vanilla. I wasn't sure they would be good as the batter wasn't very tasty. But my husband couldn't stop eating them when they came out of the oven. I also loved that this recipe was so quick to make. Easy if your in a hurry!"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","i completely recomend...very good even thogh i didnt have bakin soda...."
"0","5","Fantastic! I halved the recipe since it was only for 2 people, but I'm sure the full batch would have been eaten just as fast! I decided to make these spur of the moment so I nuked the butter for a bit in the microwave and I think the heat helped dissolve the sugar making it oh so delicious. I rolled some of my balls in sugar before baking which was yummy, but the plain ones were just as good. I'm sure they would taste great with frosting if I can ever keep enough plain ones around long enough to make some!"
"0","3","I can't believe I wasted my time and ingredients on these cookies. They were edible but definitely not the best I've ever had."
"0","5","Super Yummy!!!"
"0","1","I tried cooking the Easy Sugar Cookies recipe, although the cookies looked okay in appearance, they were difficult to digest, unfortunately. I am not sure if the recipe calls for too much or too little of any of the ingredients."
"0","1","If you are looking for a good recipe, keep looking. The dough was gooey and extremely pasty, but I still decided to put it in the oven. The circles of dough I had made, were spread acrossed the pan in a thin layer. I tried my hardest to get the dough off the pan after i made it, and I ended up throwing it all away. This was a disaster of a recipe. I do NOT reccomend it ONE BIT. >:("
"0","4","Pretty good cookies, not my favorite - frosted with orange frosting for Halloween - VERY sweet."
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful! I have made them several times and have never been disappointed."
"0","4","These were delicious and a breeze to make. From another review, I substituted half the butter for plain yogurt. I didn't have any baking soda so I only used the baking powder and they turned out just fine. I also added 1/4 cup of trail mix."
"0","5","These cookies were really really good. When I made them everyone who tried them enjoyed them. They are really easy to make too. But make sure that the butter is completely softened if not the cookies will get hard upon cooling"
"0","5","yummy!!!!"
"0","5","Im only an 11 year old girl my brother and I made this recipe for my parents anneversery(we made a dinner and left for them to have alone time)and they were great!!!"
"0","5","Was informed by my daughter that she needed something for a bake sale at school, at about 7 pm the night before!!!! These were easy to make, and came out beautifully!! I dipped each ball into decorating sugar to make them 'prettier'. Big hit, and the cookies helped to raise for victims of the tsunami. Tasty!!"
"0","5","Simply these are the easiest cookies to bake! And they taste Yummy :)"
"0","5","Great cookies!! I used a couple of tips from other reviewers. Melted the butter and used 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla! They turned out soft and tasty! My only suggestion is that I would make the cookies a little bigger. Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","3","LOL, just wanted to share my story. I really needed something sweet ( it was that time of the month) so I decided to make these. Somehow the dough turned out kind of sticky and weird, but I went ahead and put them in the oven. As I am eagerly waiting for them, they even smelled funny...all of a sudden it dawned on me....I forgot to add the sugar! Ugh I did go back and try again, another day, and the kids really liked them."
"0","4","I baked some of them but they seemed as if they still needed something, so I put sprinkles on the rest and that helped give them a little something extra."
"0","5","This is a great recipe! The cookies turned out perfectly. I melted the butter before adding it and it worked perfectly. This will be my 'go to' recipe for cookies in the future."
"0","5","Perfect sugar cookies. And dough freezes like a dream. I've been looking for something that I can freeze so the kids and I can make and decorate a half-dozen cookies on a dreary, rainy afternoon. I took other reviewers' notes to heart: increased the vanilla and made sure the butter was soft, but couldn't have been easier. Double plastic-wrapped a log of dough, popped in the freezer and cut off pieces as I need them. Still only takes 8-10 minutes to bake. How long will the dough last frozen? No idea. The boys and their friends ate ours within 14 days."
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies I have ever had! So easy, and so quick! Great idea for some home baked Christmas cookies to give out for the holidays. Thanks!!!"
"0","4","I used shortening instead of butter. My batter came out crumbly, and I added mayo to bind it, about 3 heaping tbsp of mayo. Turned out beautifully. I separated the dough in 3 parts: made some plain, added chocolate chips to the 2nd portion, and added walnut pieces to the 3rd. Everyone loved them. p.s. Also used 1/4 cup less sugar, and they turned out very sweet to my liking, I think I will use even less sugar next time."
"0","4","Maybe I rolled the balls too small, but these cookies turned out crispier than expected. They still tasted delicious, but were thinner than I thought they would be--they reminded me of the Christmas cut-outs that we make during the holidays. I will definitely use this recipe again."
"0","4","I loved the ease of the recipe...did not like the outcome. You need to take them out after 8 minutes...not a second later. It is like drop cookies so the cookie is not so appealing. However, it is SO SIMPLE to make!!!!!!!!"
"0","4","Pretty good, 9 minutes make them more gooey. I sprinkled sugar on top at the end."
"0","5","I made this recipe as is, the cookies turned out great. I made sure the butter was super soft as another reviewer suggested."
"0","5","These were so easy and my friends couldn't stop eating them!"
"0","5","These are the BEST sugar cookies! You definately want to make sure the butter is at room temperture before mixing it it. I rolled the cookies in sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet"
"0","5","Probably the best simple sugar cookie recipe I have used. Delicious!"
"0","5","Great recipe and very easy. I found this recipe awhile ago and use it all the time. Excellent Cookies! Soft and Delicious!"
"0","5","Very good cookies. It is a little too sweet for me though. I used 1 cup of sugar, and it still turns out fine. 5 stars."
"0","5","Can't believe how easy these were. I was craving something sweet last night and decided to make some sugar cookies. I looked at a few recipes that called for ingredients I didn't have (shortening) or chilling in the fridge. I wanted something quick and easy and made this recipe. They came out delicious! I doubled the vanilla and next time I'll flatten the cookies a bit instead of leaving them as balls since they didn't flatten enough for my liking. I ended up squishing them with the bottom of a glass as they were cooling."
"0","5","These are quite possibly the best sugar cookie I have ever tasted. They were so quick and easy. I topped them with store-bought cream cheese frosting and they didn't last long!! Tip for softening butter: unwrap it, throw it on a plate, and microwave it in 10-second intervals until it's mushy but still holds its shape (I usually do it for 10 seconds, then an additional 5)"
"0","5","Absolutely loved these cookies. I added another teaspoon of vanilla extract and baked on 325 for 10 minutes....they came out awesomely amazing. These cookies really are easy and delicious! I will make again!!!!!"
"0","5","These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever made or eaten! Simply and easy, I see no need to change anything!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! I do different variations with it like rolling it in cinnamon sugar before baking or halfway through the baking time, putting a hershey kiss in the middle of each cookie. It is simply delicious, and my family loves it! My brother keeps asking me to give this recipe to his wife. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","These cookies are the best home made cookies I ever had in my life!"
"0","5","The dough was VERY easy to work with and the cookies are soft and delicious."
"0","5","I love these cookies! They came out soft and chewy. I used margarine rather than butter and dropped the dough in teaspoonfuls onto parchment paper. Then I sprinkled a mix of cinnamon and sugar that I keep in a salt shaker onto the dough and baked for 8 minutes. Awesome! Thanks for a fabulously easy recipe!"
"0","5","very simple yet extremely delicious. my girls loved them! we've made a few different flavored batches--regular, cinnamon, and orange. today, we're experimenting with butter flavoring and rum flavoring ... in the same batch. :) should be great! I agree with those who have doubled up on the vanilla/flavoring. makes a HUGE difference."
"0","4","These cookies were super fast and easy to make. I put a little more vanilla in than the recipe called for and they came out great. I also didn't bake them for the full time, but my oven is pretty fast."
"0","5","I give these a 5 because it is the first time I've made sugar cookies from scratch and they turned out amazing. I would add a teaspoon of salt next time. Like the other reviewers warned me I took out the cookies after 7 minutes - they didn't look done, but they were. They were chewy and soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. I'll be making these again for sure!!"
"0","4","Very good! Definitely take out after 8 minutes, or less! My only change was adding an additional 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Fairly easy recipe and I already had all the ingredients on hand. Hopefully my new next door neighbor will like them too!"
"0","5","they were really easy to make and tasted really good."
"0","5","WOW WE ALL LOVE THEM! BEST SUGAR COOKIES IVE EVER HAD ATE THE FIRST BATCH ALL BY MYSELF LOL!"
"0","5","You can't get any quicker and easier than these cookies... I nestle small chocolate easter eggs in the center for a really pretty and delicious cookie. They're also great with glace or preserved fruit, or half pecans."
"0","5","I love this cookie me and my daughter had a great time making these."
"0","4","Soft cookie (as long as you don't leave them in too long). However, they don't spread out like I'm used to so if you make a ball, flatten it. Might be the lack of humidity where I'm at that creates this since I am at a higher elevation. Good taste!"
"0","5","These are so good! i love them!!"
"0","1","well, I followed every single direction that it said and I dont know why but they did not turn out for me. I do NOT reccommend making these cookies they were a complete waste of my time and ingredients."
"0","5","First off, I'm a VERY terrible baker!!! Everything I try to bake turns out nasty, even if I follow the directions to a 'T'!! Trust me, I'm not exaggerating!! So, I thought I'd try AGAIN at some homemade cookies. I can't believe I didn't mess this one up! They are AWESOME!! Mine usually taste bitter or tinny, but these came out perfect!! LOVE EM!!!!"
"0","5","these were easy to make...to the lady who said you needed super soft butter...wrong...i used 2 (1/2 cup as per recipe) sticks of 'hard fresh out of the refrigerator butter' and mixed it all up together by hand...everything came out great"
"0","5","delicious! perfect cook time 8 minutes 15 seconds."
"0","5","Really good and moist."
"0","4","Even though I let the butter soften for a couple hours, it was still a little dry, so I just added a couple extra tablespoons of butter and it was PERFECT. They disappeared in one day!"
"0","4","this was easy to make and didn't take long at all. i did not get 48 servings out of the above recipe because i made bigger cookies. also, i drizzled on some melted semi-sweet chocolate to make them special and even more delicious!"
"0","2","Followed the ingredients to the letter and the cookies came out poorly. Did not have a full-bodied taste unless frosting was added after baking. The dough went together perfectly, looked great, but the taste was so disappointing."
"0","4","These are fine, but they didn't live up to the rave reviews."
"0","4","They weren't very good by themselves, but with just a tiny bit of icing on top they were amazing :)"
"0","5","These are the best and easiest sugar cookies I've ever made; and I have made alot. My daughter and husband had soooo many that I had to take more out of the freezer that same evening."
"0","4","This recipe was great!! I'm totally going to make these in the future! Thanks for the recipe! Also, I melted the butter a little in the microwave for 30 seconds. The sugar cookies came out perfect!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I added red, white and blue sprinkles and they looked and tasted great."
"0","5","BEST SUGAR COOKIE EVER! I made them exactly as stated and the dough did come out crumbly and weird looking at first. I just took my hands and smooshed it all together to form a big ball and then made the cookies out of that. Make sense? I made big balls of dough and the cookies came out yummy, soft and chewy. OMG soooo good! I'm eating one now!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe, I also added extra vanilla like others and they were perfect. Many people believe they are not done if they are not brown, but sugar cookies are not supposed to brown. I saved this recipe and will always use it. Another yummy idea I tried was rolling them in cinnanmon and sugar before cooking, they were so good! I did not change the temp nor the cook time. Also, margarine is better than butter in sugar cookies, I used country crock and it is already a soft margarine so it worked very well."
"0","5","Excellent cookie. My 5 year old loved making them but insisted that we put chocolate chips in them. They came out great!!"
"0","5","very easy and fast! did it all in my kitchenaid so I only had one pan to clean. They were great with melted chocolate chips in between, yumm!"
"0","5","I too have been looking for a sugar cookie that didn't have to rolled and mess with alot. I must say this is it!!! Sugar cookies are my husbands favorite and he says these were Attttt! I didn't have any problem with them spreading out The only changes I made were I used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of marg. (it was what I had on hand already softened) I did follow other reiviews and did 2 tsp. vanilla. then I rolled the balls in sugar before I put them on the cookies sheet. They were GREAT! Between my husband and 4 kids they went quick. Def. a new family favorite!!!! Thanks"
"0","5","These really are easy and not lacking in the flavor department! If you're like me and don't care about being able to shape them most of the time and just want a quick, easy, but still tasty recipe, these are perfect! After making a mistake once when making them, I just threw all the ingredients in at once and mixed and figured I'd hope for the best. They came out just as good as ever, and made it even easier. :)"
"0","5","Yum! I just made these with the 4-year-old I babysit (they're that easy!) and they're absolutely delicious!!"
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! the only thing i did was double the baking powder..so they rise a little more...and i added an extra egg....and everyone loves them..the kids i babysit went nuts for them haha...so now we make them often =]"
"0","5","Could not have been better or easier! I made two batches - one with 1 1/2 t. of dried lavender and zest of a lemon and the other with almond extract rather than vanilla. Both were delicious! I will probably frost them too as I want to do something extra on the top, but they don't need the frosting for taste... perfect with the hint of the other herbs/tastes I added."
"0","5","Iwas craving cookies looked up this recipe it was so easy the kids enjoyed them i will continue to make these cookies."
"0","5","These cookies came out great! I used 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla instead and rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. Then pressed them down with the bottom of a measuring cup. Everyone loved them, and I will definitely be making them again."
"0","3","Simple and good."
"0","5","I made these a few weeks ago and they were simply fantastic. I used all butter, and they were perfectly soft and chewy. Combined with the 'Sugar Cookie Frosting' from this site... just woah. I ate three dozen all on my own."
"0","5","Very good! I accidentally totally melted the butter rather than just softening it... and my cookies still turned out delicious!"
"0","5","This is a GREAT recipe! Soft, chewy sugar cookies, so delicious. I have made several batches of these since discovering the recipe a few months ago. I am known as 'the one who makes THE best sugar cookies.' I always roll them in sugar before baking (usually colored) so they look pretty! I, too, add a little extra vanilla (I do that to every recipe that calls for it!). ENJOY!"
"0","4","these were really tasty! to solve the dryness problem i just used another egg white."
"0","5","they smell awesome...will make them again and always!"
"0","5","We had so much fun making these and they turned out amazing. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We decorated them for Easter and they barely lasted a few days! Will use this recipe often!!"
"0","5","I made this recipe with my 4 1/2 year old son and we rolled the dough out to make dinosaur shape cookies. It wasn't the best recipe for shapes, but it was perfect for the attention span of a kid. We also used a lactose free margarine instead of butter and it still tasted great! I expected these cookies to turn out horrible, but we'll make them again! Very tasty and nice and quick!"
"0","5","I have a cookbook of all different kinds of cookies, and none of the sugar cookies looked good or easy to make, so I googled 'easy sugar cookie recipe' and found this one and I love it. They're so simple, take hardly no time, and they're delicious! They're really buttery and light and you get plenty out of this recipe which is always a plus!"
"0","5","I made these dairy free by using Earth Balance buttery spread. Very easy recipe. They were delicious. The kids loved them too!"
"0","5","perfect! pretty easy and came out great! I rolled them in sugar before i put them in the oven too."
"0","5","Very easy indeed! I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and lemon extract. Only got three dozen."
"0","5","This was my first time making sugar cookies and with this recipe I am already a pro! YUM! Can't wait for my husband to get home and try them!"
"0","5","Delicious! Only change was based on other feedback- added 1tsp extra of vanilla. Will definitely make again!!!"
"0","5","These are delicious and very thick...probably because I scooped the dough into really big teaspoon-fulls that made 21 cookies instead of 48! I read one review that said the dough was crumbly and that using margarine was better than butter, but I made sure the butter was really soft before throwing it in with the sugar, and I stirred the ingredients as thoroughly as possible so it wouldn't be crumbly. In the end it came out like regular dough and the cookies were perfect!"
"0","4","I needed to find a sugar cookie recipe that was easy, and only required one egg. This one is really good! I added 2 tsp of vanilla instead of one and when I roll the cookies up to set on the tray, I roll them in sugar to be coated, then I bake. This tastes AMAZING! It's perfectly soft on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. Great recipe for a quick, yummy treat."
"0","5","these were great! i enjoyed making and eating these. i also dipped some in melted chocolate; it was delicious. but watch out; they make a lot of servings!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies, they are both easy to make and delicious. My husband and teenage daughter love them also.I wish I had found this recipe a few months ago, it would have been fun to decorate them for christmas!This is the cookie I will use from now on."
"0","5","I tried this recipe last halloween when my mom forgot to get candy so I made these cookie and my sister had tried one and said that they were great now I use this resipe all the time these cookies are great! I give it five stars"
"0","5","These were delicous! I had to cook them for 15 min. but they came out perfect. Soooo yummy!!! Thanks!"
"0","5","Okay. I gave these a try because I want to make some for easter and I want to give them a test run. I have to say. These were out of this world..These are the most amazing sugar cookies EVER. I will make these whenever I can, and for every occasion :)"
"0","4","These were okay. Good for being so quick. Nothing special though."
"0","4","We really enjoyed it."
"0","4","These cookies turned out better than I expected. My family was very happy with them."
"0","5","Easy, as promised and delicious. Mine took a little longer to bake than the time given."
"0","4","I just made these cookies and they are the best! I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I also made half of the cookies with Heath toffee chips. My husband & kids told me I make the best cookies ever!"
"0","5","Best sugar cookies I've made. My kids and their friends love them. I tried a batch with white choc. chips and OMG was it delicious."
"0","4","These were easy to make but rolling the dough is time consuming. I prefer a drop cookie. I used shortening in place of butter and 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of vanilla. I also rolled the cookies in colored sugar before baking. The taste was good and the cookies are crisp on the outside and soft in the middle."
"0","4","very good cookie, really simple and yummy =) wouldn't change a thing"
"0","5","These are one of the best sugar cookies i've ever tasted! they came out perfectly-delicious :]"
"0","5","Delicious!!! :)"
"0","5","Excellant sugar cookies. Great with butter cream frosting."
"0","4","My kids liked this recipe. the only problem was the batter was slightly dry and crumbly, so when cookies came out, they looked cracked. I think next time, I will add less flour and a little more milk. Otherwise, very good."
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for a while just now rating it. They are perfect! I make them very very often.They remind me of cookies my mom used to bake when i was a kid. Thanks for posting:)"
"0","5","This is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to make, and so good for my famous 'Fruit Pizza'. It's a bit too much dough for one pizza plate, so I can make a little one in addition to surprise someone!!"
"0","4","I agree with the other reviews. Normally I always read the reviews before I make something but I was in a hurry this time so I didn't. When I tasted the dough it tasted a little to floury so I thought I'd add and extra teaspoon of vanilla and it made the dough perfect. I was glad that I did that when I went back later and read the reviews. I also baked them for about 8 minutes. These were the best sugar cookies I have ever made! OH..Also I didn't have baking powder OR cream of tartar so I substituted in some non dairy coffee creamer and it worked out great!"
"0","5","Absolutely Awesome. Turned out wonderful. I'm making more this weekend so the kids can help me decorate."
"0","5","Good."
"0","5","I just made these cookies and they are easy and good. I sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar on them after they came out of the oven. Yum! My husband loves them because they are not too sweet, yet they satisfy his 'need-a-sweet-snack' tooth."
"0","5","I have to say these are the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted!! They don't need anything on them. My daughter though wanted to frost some of them so I made a strawberry frosting and they were sooo good. This is the best recipe I have ever tried for sugar cookies and you can use this one for cookie sutters too!!"
"0","5","These were so good! Maybe just a tad too much baking soda - I felt that I could taste it. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit more vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. They were crisp at the edges, soft inside with great light texture!"
"0","5","I found this recipe a while back when I was looking for something quick with only a few ingredients. I was not expecting them to be one of my favorite cookies. I have made then several times now and they always turn out great. The dough seems a little crumbly, but it never shows in the final product. I like to press them in colored sugar sprinkles before baking. I have had many compliments on these and they have been snatched up real quick at school bake sales. Thanks Stephanie for the great recipe!"
"0","5","These are absolutely the best! Has anyone ever tried to roll this dough out to use with cookie cutters?"
"0","5","I just tried this recipe this afternoon, and it turned great. It was very easy yet very good. I will do it again."
"0","5","This is an exceptional sugar cookie recipe; very creamy and soft but holds up well while frosting. I added an extra tsp of vanilla. Definitely be sure to remove from oven after 8 mins; they setup perfectly."
"0","4","Easy to follow and I did let my margarine soften all the way first. My kids are waiting to eat them now. They wanted to put food coloring but we didn't use enough so they're not quite purple, but they do have sprinkles."
"0","4","These were easy and wonderful. I only give four stars because they spread like crazy on me. While not as pretty, they turned out crisp and delicious. I frosted some with a plain white frosting but I think they do well on their own."
"0","4","Super easy to make! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added more vanilla. However, they are very, very buttery. Next time I will cut the butter back to 3/4 c. and add a little more sugar."
"0","5","Wow! I'm not exaggerating when I say I've managed to mess up every single sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried. I thought I had a baking hex. I tried these and they were easy and came out perfectly!!! I doubled the vanilla but left everything else the same! TRY THIS!"
"0","5","Great Recipe! Easy to make- only took about 15 minutes, and cooks beautifully. Thanks! Emma"
"0","5","Easy and delicious."
"0","5","I'm used to the packaged sugar cookies because I'm lazy. These were absolutely excellent, and these ingredients are what I usually have laying around. Took these cookies to work, and they loved them!"
"0","5","These are the best and easiest sugar cookies I have ever made. I added icing and sprinkles and my 3 year old loves them! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","SUPER quick and easy, and VERY tasty! I used Smart Balance margarine with these (softened) and they turned out great. The didn't spread as much as I thought they would, but besides that they were perfect. Make sure to take them out just at the point where they don't look quite done enough. They will remain soft as a result. I used the recipe ' Sugar Cookie Icing' found on this site for my icing. They were great together! Make sure to wait until your cookies have cooled and chill your icing in the fridge for a bit - otherwise it will run down your the side of your cookies. Thanks for a great family recipe!"
"0","5","Easy! Tasty! 5 out of 5 no question!"
"0","5","This was a very good Sugar Cookie recipe. I melted the butter and added 2 tsp of vanilla extract. I also instead of doing balls I made this disks. They are nice and soft and yet have a little crunch to the bottom. They were very good."
"0","4","These really are easy sugar cookies. I make them with my son. However, I have found that if I use my hand mixer, the dough is too dry, I can only make these with my kitchenaid mixer. We roll them in sprinkles or colored sugar."
"0","5","This is so easy! My family loved them."
"0","4","Very good, not too sweet and the kids loved them."
"0","5","Charles loves them"
"0","3","My students loved them (they love any cookie though). I thought they were good but not amazing or anything"
"0","5","Butter was soft and they came out PERFECT!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. It's so easy and tasty and doesn't require chilling and cutting."
"0","5","These were great and very easy to make! Thanks!"
"0","5","Crisp and GOOD! This recipe is the best. Just roll and bake. I love that you don't have to refrigerate the dough."
"0","5","SO good! SO easy!"
"0","5","Ridiculously easy and good. There are many 'sugar cookie' recipes. This is the real deal -- all butter and sugar -- that still stays soft in the middle."
"0","5","This is the first year I've baked cookies on my own and these turned out great."
"0","5","These cookies really were easy, easy to work with, and have a great taste. I added extra vanilla and a little salt, just due to personal preference. They due tend to spread if you're using them as drop cookies, so make the drops small and give them enough space. I doubt I'll be lookig for a new sugar cookie recipe any time soon. Thanks for this recipe! :)"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out perfect! There is no need to refrigerate the dough as it’ll be crumbly if you try to work with it cold. I baked mine for 11 minutes and they got slightly brown on the edges. They were crispy… just the way I like them."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! Light, crispy, and perfectly sweet. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","3","Ok - easy recipe. One thing missing, It needed 2 eggs not one. 1 egg the mix was dry and crumbly, when I added the second egg it work so much better. AS far as taste, I will get back to that after x-mas ."
"0","5","I made these last night,wonderful,GREAT directory!"
"0","5","These are fantastic. I realized this morning I needed cookies for gifts and these were fast and easy. I rolled them in green sugar just for decorations and they were beautiful. I'm not good with rolling and cutting out sugar cookies so these are a great alternative. These will be made over and over in our house."
"0","5","All I wanted was a simple sugar cookie recipe for chewy cookies... This was it! You can also make them crunchy by cooking a little bit longer! I made these and they were gone in 2 days between my mom and I... I also used a cookie press to make unique designs... I can't make these again as my mom is mad cuz she ate most of them. I used a little extra vanilla as was suggested by another user, AND accidentally melted my butter all the way but it still worked :)"
"0","4","Delicious recipe - the only reason for 4 stars is that I found the dough to be a bit crumbly to work with."
"0","5","I had never tried a sugar cookie recipe before but now this is one of my family's favorites. I just suggest to make sure the butter is definitely soft and be careful not to overcook. My oven has a tendency to bake things faster than what the recipe recommends so I only baked these for 7 minutes."
"0","5","OMG! These are great cookies. I followed everything to a T with one exception, I add a bit of cinnamon. I got rave reviews all around. Also for decoration I rolled them in colored sugar and well let me say that these didn't last very long at my house. I will so be making these again and again. Thanks for sharing Stephanie."
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful. I took the advice of another review and added 2tsp of vanilla. They taste almost identical to the sugar cookies you get from Subway. Perfect cookies!"
"0","5","This is one of the simplest and best sugar cookies I have ever made. I did an 8 minute bake (adding sprinkles after 4 minutes) and produced soft, tasty delights. Highly recommended."
"0","3","I added 2 tsp vanilla and reduced to 1 cup sugar. In terms of taste and texture, it was pretty good. Even though I overcooked the cookies, I didn't find it dry or crunchy. I also liked that I reduced the sugar so it's not as sweet. But I had trouble with the cooking time and temperature. My oven temperature is average (ie. if the recipe asks for 8-10 min, my food is usually ready for 9 min). When I baked these cookies at 375F for 8 min, the bottoms were burnt and the center was not cooked. Also, the cookies didn't spread out as much as everyone said they did, so the cookies were a little bit too high. In the end, I flattened the cookies to about 1/2 inch thick and then baked at 350F for 12 min. They turned out really well. I'm only giving this a 3-star because I nearly ruined all my cookies before figuring out the best time/temp to bake them."
"0","3","Not the worst cookie i've ever tasted but then again, not the best either. They taste very bland even though I added the extra vanilla. I am sure they would be better frosted to add some flavor to them. I wont try this one again."
"0","5","wow! i just have to say, that i am in no way a baker, but these came out fantastic! I added the recommended extra tspn of vanilla and baked them for an extra 2 minutes, and everyone loved them!"
"0","5","Very good cookies. They turned out great. The only change I made was added an extra tsp. of vanilla."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Makes a perfect soft/chewy texture and provides a wonderful medium for all sorts of added goodies! Holds up well with LOTS of goodies in each cookie. Add-ins aren't necessary though, as this cookie is very tasty as a simple sugar cookie."
"0","5","these are SO good and super easy to whip together. i make a half-batch which is the perfect amount for our small family. i'm making a double batch to ive out as gifts for christmas. wonderful!"
"0","3","The dough came out quite sticky, which made it difficult for my children to work with as it stuck to their hands.  As suggested, I used margarine that was room temperature.  I followed the recipe though I refrigerated the dough for about 2 hours hoping it would be more suitable for cookie cutters (nope).  I wouldn't make this again as I am sure I could find a better option."
"0","5","i thought these cookies were great i made sugar cookie lolipops out of them they real went over well with the teachers and students"
"0","5","First time I made these they didn't work..crumbly and not-so-good. Second time...perfect. Soft and yummy! Not sure what I did differently, but I will keep using these cookies. I used the recipe for the base in a fruit pizza...YUM!"
"0","5","I just made these this morning for my daughter's class. I just wanted to say that I am so impressed with the ease of these and the end product! I followed the suggestion to let the butter get really soft, so I took the sticks out late last night. I also took them out after 8 minutes sharp as suggested. I rolled mine in colored sugar & decorated them w/cinnamon dots. Mine were excellent out of the oven :). They hardened a bit more than I like, but I think only partly because of my older sheet & also because I ended yielding 60 or so. Thank you for this winner!"
"0","5","Try throwing some cocoa in there. Delicious! (And easy.)"
"0","5","I make these cookies for Christmas every year and my whole family loves them! Here's a tip: When you roll the little balls of dough to put on the cookie sheet, try sticking a chocolate chip in the middle. They melt inside and give the cookies a chocolate filling. It's delicious!"
"0","5","I added 1 tsp vanilla. These came out perfect!"
"0","4","Yummy and easy to make. My son and I had a grande time making these tasty treats!  I did add another teaspoon of Vanilla though, for more flavor. :)"
"0","5","This sugar cookies are wonderful. I used Country Crock spread as my butter, and it was so Yummy! I have had some disastrous sugar cookie recipes, but this was perfect! Thanks for a wonderful recipe. Easy and delicious!"
"0","5","These are easy and very good! First time I ever made sugar cookies! Make sure butter is soft - I put it in microwave for 30 seconds. Definitely will make it again!"
"0","5","Thanks to all of the reviews i got good advice and tips for this recipe. These sugar cookies turned out awesome. They were just right (not dry at all). I added the extra tsp of vanilla as well and only allowed them to bake for 8-9 minutes (one tray i made them larger)."
"0","5","I make these all the time! They are super easy and they are very good! They never last long in my house!"
"0","5","5 stars because they are so good and easy! But I melted the butter and the batter was still so crumbly that they were hard to form into cookies. I added a splash of almond rice milk to the second batch and that helped a bit. I also had to bake them a bit longer, more like 15 mins, but that may be my oven."
"0","4","I added 2 tbsp plain soy milk and coated the dough with cinnamon sugar before baking, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. With about 9 minutes of baking time, I got a crispy exterior with a nice chewy center. The cookies were tasty and not too sweet. 4 stars because of the insane amount of butter that goes into these cookies."
"0","4","Great cookies! I did add about 1/2 tsp. of salt and practically melted the butter. To scoop, I used my 1/2 tsp measuring spoon (sprayed with a little bit of cooking spray). After they were scooped, I rolled the tops in colored sugar crystals and then baked for 11 minutes. Perfect! Do make sure to do a test batch (a couple of cookies) to get the time just right."
"0","5","I have to melt my butter before adding it. Otherwise it wont turn out. Other than that I have not strayed from the recipe. This one's a keeper. Thanks."
"0","5","To start, the batter is delicious! I ate half of that up before i even made the cookies :) They have a yummy taste of vanilla running through them.  The slight crunch of the sugar makes these 100% satisfaction. The cookies are simply fantastic."
"0","3","I made these with Splenda instead of the granulated sugar and they seemed to lack flavor..."
"0","5","These cookies are easy to make and really tasty. I don't usually take the time to make sugar cookies from scratch, but these are worth the extra few minutes. As another reviewer suggested, I added two teaspoons of vanilla instead of one and I sprinkled some sugar on them halfway through cooking time."
"0","5","The perfect drop sugar cookie I have been looking for!"
"0","5","I'll never roll another sugar cookie again! These are Santa worthy!! 8 min. yielded a slightly crunchy outside with a chewy center while 10 min. yielded a golden crispy cookie, both delicious. These were so easy and were eaten as fast as they were baked."
"0","5","Oh my gosh, thank you for posting this recipe!! I have been looking for a good one for a while and you just made my night. And I did do the extra teaspoon of vanilla extract which helped soften up the dough a bit, but I think the crumbliness is what makes them so good! Thanks again!"
"0","5","You said it! They taste good and are so easy to make!"
"0","5","Super delicious! This really is the easiest recipe for sugar cookies. I paired this with decorator frosting and everything it was the best I've ever tasted!"
"0","5","Very Easy and very good"
"0","4","these were very easy to make. They are delish as well! I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and it flavoured it quite well- plus I made green and red one's to add to the christmas spirit! Good Recipe!"
"0","5","this is the beast and easy cookies ever.you should make them"
"0","5","Very easy recipe and delicous!"
"0","5","These ARE easy to make and they come out perfect each time!"
"0","5","These are great! So easy to make and everyone loves them. I love that they don't require any chill time (I have no patience)! They also work well with the Splenda 50/50 blend. I know its ironic to make sugar cookies with Splenda, but they really turned out great."
"0","5","Supper Yummy!"
"0","5","This thing turned out awsome!! Me and my Dad made them nd they turned out great! We made sure to make the butter really soft. So i think that helped. lolz."
"0","3","I tried this recipe last night- adding a little more vanilla. The cookies tasted good and were DELICIOUS when warm. However, after they cooled, they turned hard. I'm not really sure what to do to keep them soft :("
"0","4","Easy. I rolled the dough in sugar before putting it on the cookie sheet... also tripled the vanilla, giving it a little more flavor."
"0","5","My boyfriend loves the cookies so much he ate the batch by himself :)"
"0","5","I love these cookies! i make em' all the time now"
"0","5","These were soooo good!!! I debated on this recipe and another one from this site and this one is by far better. They had such a great taste. I made mine bigger than the recipe calls for so I had to bake a bit longer. I took them out when they were barely browned at all. They were chewy and great! I would pick this recipe over all the other ones."
"0","5","I'm not a big baker but I've made these cookies two nights in a row now. Usually I hesitate to share my baked creations with others (I had a bad experience at a potluck when I saw someone throw one of my cookies away after taking a bite) but everyone I've shared these cookies with has really enjoyed them. These cookies are super easy to make. They do come out a little thinner than I usually like my cookies, but they have a very unique chewy texture despite the thinness. Only thing I have to say about the recipe is be generous with the flour - the first time I did the recipe I was a little conservative with the flour use and they were too gooey to make balls out of. I will be making these recipe again and again!"
"0","4","My husband loved these!! I sprinkled a little sugar on top just to add to it."
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe! It's incredibly easy and extra yummy! My son and husband beg me to make them all the time!"
"0","3","This is a really easy recipe to use if you have kids. However, they taste kind of bland and are just 'okay'. I've had way better. But again, a great recipe to use if you have small children. It's simple."
"0","4","these cookies turned out pretty tasty, although i wish they would've been a little less crisp after baking. overall a great, easy recipe."
"0","5","My daughter loved helping me make these delicious cookies. Easy to make and great to eat :)"
"0","5","This was an easy recipe & tasted great! I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe. The first batch I made lasted only 5 minutes. Yummy with a fresh cup of coffee! : )"
"0","4","Very tasty cookies! I made them one night when I was wanting something sweet and it came together so easy. I will make again."
"0","5","These cookies are so easy to make and taste great. I have to hide them from my boyfriend so he doesn't eat them all in one sitting."
"0","5","awesome recipe- this one had more taste than 'the best rolled sugar cookies' and I didn't even use vanilla! My only advise- don't melt the butter in the microwave (like I did whoops...) or else the cookies will harden overnight. I thought that there was a little too much butter, but it was still good! I made the cookies twice the size and made 12 cookies with 24 servings of dough. Baked for 15 minutes, and they came out perfect!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome! I made them exactly as written and the whole family ate them up. I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes and they were soft and chewy. I used my cookie scoop that holds 1 1/2 TBS of dough. Yummmmm!!! I will be adding these to my holiday cookie baking this year... :)"
"0","5","I just made these sugar cookies. I noticed a few reviews pointed the importance 0f using soft butter. I used 'I cant believe it's not butter' (in the tub) from the first batch I had the best cookies. I'm testing cookie recipes for my Christmas baking and you can bet these will be on the top of my list"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I was able to make the dough and bake all of the cookies within one hour! The dough was a bit crumbly and needed to be mixed with my hands before baking. I rolled each ball into colored sugar before baking and they came out very chewy! My husband (who is a choc. chip cookie fan) ate them all up raving about them after each cookie. Will definitely be making these again!"
"0","4","this recipe was good for what i was making them for i need the cookies to be a little harder than normal for decorating.. and i found the cookies to taste really good. the batter was crumbly and hard to form..next time i make these i will try having the butter much softer.. otherwise good base recipe"
"0","5","My 8 year old and I made these for Halloween treats. They were fast, easy, and great tasting. Will definately be using it again real soon! Thanks!"
"0","5","WOW!!!! These taste sooo good. My second batch is still in the oven, and my son and I already ate half of the 1st batch.  I did use real butter since that is all I had and then added 2 tsp of vanilla. Other than that I did exactly what the recipe called for. These will be made many,many more times."
"0","5","Simple and yummy! Made this morning with my granddaughter. We rolled them in tinted (orange) sugar for extra fun. Great recipe!"
"0","5","these cookies are good!i had to use whole wheat flour cuz i didn't have white.next time i'll use the all purpose white flour and i know they'll be even better!"
"0","5","I baked this recipe for my dad's birthday and everybody loved it. I put colored icing in it and decorated them, it was so cute. these cookies are so yummy and soooo easy!"
"0","5","Very simple and yummy! Of course, I have quite a sweet tooth, so I rolled the balls of dough in sugar before baking."
"0","5","Im am I brand new baker and these cookies came out perfect. I like my cookies a little crunchy so I baked them a few minutes longer and they came out perfect. Thank You!!!"
"0","5","FABULOUS! My boyfriend ate the whole first tray without it being taking off the cookie sheet! Thanks!"
"0","4","Recipe was very simple and quick to make. I softened butter very well and dough was still crumbly. I didnt mind it too much seeing that when i rolled the cookies they did quite well sticking together. I baked one batch at 10 mins-crispy on outside and semi-soft in middle. The other batched i baked at 8 mins-super soft. Depending on how you enjoy your cookies both turned out good. I also added 2 tea. of French Vanilla extract, instead of 1 tea. of Vanilla. SUPER TASTY!"
"0","5","Just as you said, EASY! They taste so fantastic. Thanks for such a great tasting and simple recipe!"
"0","5","OMG!!!!! This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. I used powdered sugar in place of granulated. The dough was had a velvety texture, and the finished cookie was soft and yummy."
"0","5","Awesome!! Kids couldn't get enough! Adults couldn't get enough, either, actually! Dough seemed really gooey before baking but boy, it made some nice chewy cookies. Cooked them 5 minutes, added sugar on top, then another 3. Used margarine like others said. Will not ever use store bought again."
"0","5","This was an amazing recipe! we did change the temperature to 325 but delicious, defiantly a favorite!"
"0","5","I fixed these cookies, and they came out great.I used margarine instead of butter."
"0","5","perfect recipe as is... melt in your mouth"
"0","5","I absolutely love these cookies. They are easy to make and taste AMAZING! They are so soft and chewy. I found the dough a little sticky, so I ended up putting it into a bag and piping the dough onto the cookie sheet, but other than that, I love these cookies!"
"0","5","this recipes was fast and easy. Kids wanted cookies and they had them in no time. Will definitely make this one again."
"0","5","This was a fantastic batch of cookies. My 2 year old daughter & I just made them. The only thing we did different was added 1 cup of chopped pecans. It gave it a bit of crunch where it would otherwise be too chewy for me. They were awesome!!"
"0","5","Oh my are these good! Perfect... wonderful balance of sweet, soft cookie. Not to mention very quick and easy to make."
"0","3","this was the best sugar pancake recipe we've ever had. although the directions were a little misleading and the recipe required a dash of milk, the outcome was still fantastic and we'll be enjoying our sugar pancakes for the next little while."
"0","5","these are by far THEEEE best sugar cookies i've made. other recipes were too sticky (which made it impossible to mold into shapes) and flavorless. these cookies taste wonderful, definately no alterations needed!"
"0","5","These are really great cookies. We put them side by side with the Ultimate Sugar Cookie, and there was no contest. Rolling balls in sugar before baking on Parchment was the key tip. I also added cardamom, cloves, ginger, cinnamin, and black pepper to the last batch of rolling sugar for a snincker-doodle type flair. There are a real keeper!"
"0","3","i made these and everyone said they tasted like scrambled eggs!!! there's only one egg in the recipe so i dont really know how to fix that..."
"0","5","Wonderful dough! Very easy to work with. I ran out of white sugar so I used brown sugar instead. Still delicious!"
"0","5","they were really good, only thing i did was add quite a bit of cinnamon so they were more like cinnamon cookies. would bake again, with a little less cinnamon lol"
"0","5","I LOVE these cookies!!! They are just so easy and so delicious. I make them every year at Christmas. Just before they go in the oven, I roll them with sprinkles and it makes them really pretty! Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","This is the best and easiest sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried! I think it's the butter that makes it so special!"
"0","5","Okay, so I promise for those who have not tried this recipe, it is amazing. As long as your butter is at 100% room temperature, you will never be disappointed. I froze the dough for an hour and then rolled out a foot wide cookie for a friend's Welcome Home party and it turned out magnificently! Kudos to the creator of this fabulous sugar cookie!"
"0","5","I used this recipe to teach a cooking lesson for 4th and 5th graders.We all enjoyed the cookies!"
"0","5","Wow - what great and easy cookies. These are so nice and soft - great texture. I used 1/2 of the flour wheat and the rest all purpose. Used a small ice cream scooper to make the cookies. Will be making again soon!"
"0","3","these were good, but they were too buttery for my taste. I recommend flattening them slightly before baking."
"0","5","This is my favorite sugar cookie receipe. I've made it several times & it always turns out well. I add double vanilla extract for extra flavor, but the rest is perfect!"
"0","5","These are amazing cookies! They were very easy to make and were incredibly delicious. Everyone loved them. I'll be making them again soon!"
"0","5","these were perfect! of course - i didnt think they had enough sugar on them - so i dipped into sugar before baking! .. made them cripsier on top! More sugar - the better!"
"0","5","very fast very easy very very delicious!"
"0","4","these cookies were very easy to make, and require very basic ingredients. i used 2 tsp of vanilla to make the taste a bit richer. i added chocolate and peanut butter m&m's on top. i also rolled some in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar to make snickerdoodles, which came out well."
"0","5","This recipe is delicious! My entire family enjoys them. The only problem that I find is that when i cook them for 8 minutes the inside of the cookie is not fully cooked yet. Next time, i will cook them for longer. These cookies are well worth a second time making."
"0","5","Very easy to make! I cut them in half when they are warm and then serve them with the chocolate fountain. They are very good!"
"0","5","I made these for a Fourth of July party. They were amazing!! My dough was really crumbly, so I got worried at first, but I just rolled them into little balls and they baked just fine! I was able to make about 40 little cookies, which I decorated with frosting! Easy, fast and very tasty recipe!!"
"0","4","I don't like greasy cookies, so I use only 1/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of sugar. To add moist and more flavor, I add 1/2 cup of skim milk and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. They taste good. But in this way they are more like biscuits."
"0","5","I just this recipe for a 4th of July barbeque. They came out delicious! I like my cookies a little moist and chewy, so I added 1/4 cup veggetable oil to the mix, as well as 1/2 tsp Almond Extract to boost the taste."
"0","4","This recipe was very easy, made exactly 4 dozen cookies, and were very chewy. I added 1/2 cup extra sugar and used 2 tsp vanilla, though. These cookies were not dry or crumbly at all; to those that had this happen, perhaps you need to cream the sugar and butter more thoroughly. I made another batch, this time adding 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup butter and they were very tasty! Will keep this in my recipe box as a quick and easy sugar cookie to make for my 79 year old dad."
"0","5","Absolutely the best sugar cookie I have ever had! My 4 year old daughter and I made these, and they were so simple and very delicious. We highly recommend these. I too added a bit extra vanilla, in fact we doubled it to 2 tsp. They were soft and chewy in the middle and slightly crispy on the outside, just like we love them! Perfect sugar cookies!!!!!"
"0","5","These cookies were delicious! I think I might of made them wrong though because the dough was in crumbs so it made it hard to form the balls. I think i just made them wrong. Oh well. My mom is so cute becuase she loves them so much and she is all old and she really loves them! I also put on some frosting on top and that made them even more delicious. I really enjoyed them. Thank you."
"0","3","These were ok, not really a favorite. Probably won't make again...sorry! There are way better sugar cookie recipes out there."
"0","5","these were so easy to make. however it took about 15 minutes to bake under 375. or maybe i left them to catch a golden color. crispy on outside yet chew inside. thanks for the easy fool proof recipe :)"
"0","5","These were easy to make, the taste and texture was perfect. My husband loved them, which means they're the best."
"0","5","Loved it! I used it as the base for a fruit pizza and it turned out wonderful. Would definetly use again! The only changes I made was to use 1cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar."
"0","5","These were great, they were soft and moist on the inside and had just the right crunch on the outside. I added a little extra sugar in the batter instead of rolling in sugar. They were amazing and I didn't feel hesitant when my children asked for seconds since they are not too sweet. I will be making these regularly."
"0","4","Very good. I had to add a bit of water to my mixture as it was very dry but they came out very nice. They came out lightly brown and chewy. I dipped the top half in sugar for extra sweetness. My only gripe was they got a bit hard and crumbly after a day of being stored away - and I stored them in an airtight container. Overall, a very good recipe."
"0","5","awesome! I tried it 3 different ways...the way it's written, rolled in cinnamon and sugar, and in green sugar."
"0","4","Easy, soft, and delicious."
"0","3","These did not turn out well at all. I might be partly to blame. I cut the butter in half and replaced the rest with applesauce. I also used egg beaters instead of eggs. I always do this when baking to cut down on the fat. It just didn't work with this recipe. Sorry, but I doubt I'll make these again."
"0","5","A popular favorite in my family. Some of my family doesn't like chocolate, but everyone likes these cookies. No need to change anything in the recipe, either. This matches some of my favorite recipes, in that there are simple ingredients."
"0","4","Good sugar cookies and definitely easy. I really liked that I didn't need to roll the dough out."
"0","3","this cookies were SO good raw but.....cooked they left a lot do be desired!"
"0","5","these were seriously the best sugar/butter cookies ever. i doubled the vanilla and rolled the tops in coarse sugar before baking. made these twice in one week!!"
"0","5","I started making these cookies about 40 minutes ago and have eaten 2. I made them as written and added a few chocolate chips on top. fine cookie."
"0","5","I absolutely look this recipe, I fully agree with the other review. They were quick, very easy and taste devine!"
"0","4","The cookies were easy to make... and tasted great!! Good recipe!!"
"0","4","This recipe produces delicious cookies, however I tinkered with it a bit. I added one egg yolk for added tenderness a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cardamon, and a pinch of salt, for flavor"
"0","5","These are wonderful! Like other reviews state, they do not look done at 8 minutes; however, they taste perfect and are really soft. I rolled them in sugar before baking and they are really flavorful."
"0","5","Unbelievable! This is an awesome recipe. I followed the directions, except used light butter and a tad less sugar; then rolled them in cinnamon sugar before baking. They tasted amazing! This will be my sugar cookie recipe from now on. Thanks!"
"0","4","I made these cookies b/c i wanted to try quick cookies instead of the traditional old-school roll out kind. `they look like biscuits and taste ok!it tasted too sugary and not buttery enough. they are soft. i like mine thin and crisp. I added a little more vanilla and some buttermilk bc the batter was too crumbly. they looked like the picture. not the best cookies but my family liked them. i also made strawberry compote-sugar,water and fresh strewberry (boil for sec and let stand to get thick or refrig for jelly)to dip."
"0","5","Fantastic! This recipe is super easy, quick, and yields a soft on the inside buttery cookie. I did put 2 tsp. of vanilla (but I'm a vanilla junky) :)"
"0","5","These are the yummiest and easiest sugar cookies I've ever made! And the best part is that the recipe uses items found in most kitchens! I did double the vanilla to give it a somewhat richer flavor. I also plan to add a little cinnamon to my next batch for a little variation!"
"0","4","Easy and delicious. My 3 year old even helped with ingredients. Dough is a wonderful consistency for shaping and cutting. Great recipe."
"0","5","Well, we mistook the white sugar for granulated sugar. So when the dough was more like powder we decided to add our own ingredients. We put in peanut butter, cinnamon, half n half, brown sugar, milk, water, and honey. After we baked the really sticky dough for about eleven minutes we took out or creation. We created some darn good sweet biscuits!"
"0","4","these cookies are pretty good...they had a few textural problems...the dough was a bit grainy due to the sugar. so, i tweaked them a little. first off, use only 2 1/2 cups of flour. replace a quarter cup of sugar with a quarter cup of powdered sugar. then add about 1/2 an egg. also, mix all the dry ingredients, including the sugar, together, then once they are mixed with the butter, and a mix of the egg(s) and vanilla. i'm a huge vanilla fan, so i put a tablespoon in there. these go great with lemon frosting as well!!"
"0","3","This turned out pretty good.. only I found it had a rather overpowering eggy taste. It could have used much more vanilla extract..  And you weren't kidding when you said they were easy. I made several batches and each batch took hardly anytime to make.. Just too easy and your measurements were very accurate.  I will make it again next time however Ive got to do something about that egg taste. Thanks."
"0","2","OKAY cookies, I followed the recipe and the dough was very crumbly, didn't seem right. We added another half of butter and that made it easier. Was very easy to put on tray instead of rolling it out. We baked for 10 min, and they turned out burnt and hard at the bottom, the cookies were okay but it didn't even taste right. I've made way better cookies before."
"0","5","These were the easiest cookies to make and by far the best tasting. To add a little extra flavor I sprinkled on a touch of cinnamon which added a delightful taste."
"0","4","I liked them, but my husband thought it was too eggy! I probably will try another recipe now."
"0","3","I have to say I've had better. But I did enjoy making them. I'm only 14 and I'm home all day so i wanted something fun and quick to do."
"0","5","So wonderful! I made them with powder egg replacer and they were still just plain awesome. I got neon food coloring to mix into them too :) I recommend dipping them in homemade frosting. :D"
"0","5","Thank you for this recipe!  I don't even like sugar cookies, but have to say these won me over. Excellent cookies! As mentioned by another reviewer, I used almond extract along with vanilla (1 tsp almond, 1/2 tsp vanilla).   Fabulous! Took them to a fundraiser, and though people go for chocolate chip cookies, those who sampled these sugar cookies changed their orders to get more of these.  I'm off to make more now for an evening of yums!"
"0","5","Absolutely perfect. Just remember to chill for a bit. These are unbelievably soft! Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I am pretty particular with sugar cookies and these were great. They were not hard or bitter (which sugar cookies often are). I followed the recipe exactly. If you wait until the edges of the cookies are turning brown they are overdone. 10 minutes was the perfect amount of time. If you can lightly press on the top of the cookie and it feels slightly crispy and not doughy...they are done. They were so easy to roll out, cut and cook!"
"0","4","I found a couple of problems with this recipe. First of all, it DID NOT make 48 cookies. I only got about half that with the recipe given. Secondly, I did find it too crumbly for dough, and added a splash of milk. That helped a lot. Furthermore, instead of making round balls I just used cookie cutters to make my own shapes and it worked fine. Other than those two things, the cookies themselves were good. I hope my friends will enjoy them this weekend."
"0","5","These cookies turned out great! I baked for 8 minutes and they were done perfectly."
"0","5","for as easy as they were, these were amazing!"
"0","5","very good - rolled into balls perfectly - cooked up very nice. I was in a pinch for school snacks for the kids and this worked great. thank you"
"0","5","these are the absolute best sugar cookies and my 3 yr old has so much fun making them!"
"0","5","These cookies were delicious and easy to make. I took them out when they were just browning on the edges. They were not too sweet, which made them perfect for some type of topping. They stayed nice and moist overnight as well."
"0","4","Very easy to make and dough was so good to work with. I put my dough in the freezer for 15 minutes and it wasa breeze to roll out (Always use a well floured mat and rolling pin). These tasted good, I would of liked a more sweeter tasting cookie bvut my kids and husband lobved them, so that is okay in my ooks. I also used homemade icing to add the sweetness."
"0","5","Excellent sugar cookie! While making the dough, I worried that it looked more like a pate brisee dough, but it turned out just fine. I experimented with making it round or flattening the bottom for more of a mounded cookie, but they both worked. I rolled the dough in colored sugar, and the cookies were so pretty. I wouldn't use these with cookie cutters, though, since they do crack on top, they're more your classic round sugar cookie."
"0","5","These cookies rock!!!!! i made them the other night and they are sooo simple!!!! they turned out perfectly!  For a change i substituted 1 cup of flour for 1 cup of ground almonds and stuck half a Glace Cherry on each cookie. very tasty!!"
"0","5","This is the beast sugar cookies i have ever made"
"0","5","LOVE this recipe.....it's easy and wonderful!! The kids in my sons class will love them for Valentine's day. Have some baking in the oven right now!!"
"0","5","i love this recipie i actually put a little extra vanilla in, along with some cinnamin and allspice. i actually think that its alot better if you add a little milk, and dont rool it, just mush it up ant put it right on the cookie sheet and 12-15 min. was about right"
"0","5","THE BEST AND EASIEST SUGAR COOKIE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Excellent! Even more fun with sprinkles and cream cheese frosting! Mmm!"
"0","5","I never thought I would like sugar cookies this much untill I made these with stuff I already had in the pantry. I did add more vanilla like others had mentioned and only cooked them for 8 mins. They came out soft in (but done) in the middle and chewy around the edges. I will be making these again."
"0","5","Super good and super easy! I found that refrigerating the dough for about ten minutes made them stick to my hands less as I rolled them. I set my oven on about 360F and baked for about nine minutes and they came out perfectly!"
"0","5","I had to substitute the vanilla with molasses and they still came out Great-Thank You!"
"0","5","EASY! The first cookies I've ever made and got great reviews. Like others said, allow dough to refrigerate over night in order to cut shapes the next day. Add flavored crystals while baking for deco. These cookies aren't that sweet, which my family liked."
"0","5","I had an old family recipe for sugar cookies that I loved just fine. My husband didn't like that one though--but I found him sneaking MANY cookies from THIS recipe. So I will definitely be using this one from now on!"
"0","5","I love this, its my favorite recipe of all time and gets very good rating from everyone. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I loved it!! This was my first time making cookies from scratch versus buying the dough in the store and I didn't know what to expect. I followed other users advise and added 2 tsp. of water to the mix. They were so good I made them twice in one week! The first time I used two sticks of margarine instead of butter and the dough spread very quickly, so I made them into 3/4 inch balls that spread into 1 1/2 inch cookies, I think I made at least 80 cookies, which is perfect because I have a large family. They were extra chewy!! The first time I simply added the ingredients as I took them out of the fridge, but the second time I combined the sugar and butter as the recipe asked, it didn't seem to make much of a difference. Also, I had to set my oven at 325 degrees because it heats very well. I didn't get to form them into cute shapes because they spread quickly. I think I could have the second time because I refrigerated the dough for an hour instead of 10 minutes as I did the first time. After rolling the cookies into balls I rolled them in sugar and then rolled them again so that the sugar would press into the dough. I will make these cookies again and again!"
"0","4","This recipe made really good sugar cookies. Will use again."
"0","5","These are the BEST!!! My husband raved about them. The recipe makes a good portion of cookies 60+. We had none left over. I used the 'Sugar Cookie Icing' recipe with these cookies."
"0","5","My husband and I both really enjoyed these cookies. When I made them the first time I followed the recipe almost exactly (only change was I doubled the vanilla like some people who posted had suggested) and I thought they tasted just a tiny bit too starchy, so the 2nd time I made them I followed a few more of the tips of the other posters and reduced the flour to 2 1/2 cups, and the butter to 3/4 cup. I only had 1/2 tsp of vanilla the 2nd time, so I missed that extra vanilla flavor in my 2nd batch, but we both still thought they were yummy. For decoration I just rolled them into balls then into a cinnamon sugar mixture (2 tbsp sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon). I tried decorating a few differently, but this was the kind we liked the best."
"0","5","really good and really easy i will definitly use it again.  i put my dough in the fridge to chill even though it said not to, i had other stuff to do at the time, i ended up having to let it thaw to be able to use it.  i just rolled it into a log and cut circle slices.  everyone liked them!"
"0","5","much better than the 'Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' These are delicious!"
"0","5","This is a great and super easy recipe though I find that the cookies are a little bit too rich and buttery for me if I don't decrease the amount of butter by about 20%. A little less butter and they're perfect!"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing and delicious! I have a holiday bake-off and they were so simple and the biggest hit. Cooling them for 2 hours did help. If you double the recipe, make sure mix it up really well!"
"0","5","exelent  i did my own little twist, puting 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar, and 3/4 cup granulated and added 2 tsp of vanilla. I followed the rest of the ingredients and instructions and they were exactly what I was looking for"
"0","3","they had a good flavor. But I won't use this one again. The dough was hard to work with. I couldn't find my recipe box that has the recipe that I have been using for the last 15 years. We recently moved and I need a recipe."
"0","5","Quick,easy,and fun! Great for women on the go!"
"0","5","These cookies were heavenly, my favorite cookie recipe of the year. I did not alter the recipe at all. The cookies do spread a lot so would probably not work for cut outs. I found that the cookies in the back of the oven cooked quicker than in the front, so I turned the trays 2/3 of the way in to baking to try to get a more even batch. 8 minutes was perfect for a moist cookie, chewy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies are perfect! They were so simple to make. I was able to make them and eat them in less than 30 minutes. Its a perfect holiday cookie. Soft on the inside with a little crunch on the out. I put sugar in the raw on top which also provides a nice texture and crunch."
"0","5","Yum..followed exactly and rolled into balls (didn't use cutouts). Second year I've made these and will continue to make each Christmas!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe!! I made these with my kids on Christmas Eve. The cookies turned out great and the family loved them--so did Santa. Very quick to make as well."
"0","4","These were good. They were crisy though, when they were cut out. If you like that kind."
"0","5","This recipe is good, however, I modified it by adding twice the amount of vanilla called for, and substituted .5 cups of Brown Sugar for White Sugar. That way they had a richer flavor. The cookies look puffy when taken out of the oven, but quickly flatten down. The cooking time given was too long for my oven, since I don't care for dunkers. But even those are totally fine with a cup of tea! Great easy recipe that makes delicious sugar cookies. I'll make this one again!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! I used a previous tip given to use an extra 1/2 a tsp of vanilla and that worked out really well. The cookies are sweet, buttery and just so indulgent! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","Great cookie...sooo easy to make! I rolled them, took the back of a glass and pressed gentley and put colored sprinkles on them, kisses and red hots! Came out great!!!"
"0","5","Delicious and easy! I use a cookie scoop then dip the rounded side into a mixture of sugar/cinnamon/dash of cloves. Try 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 orange extract. My mother in law loved these cookies as much as any other fancy dessert I'd make. It's great because these are ingredients regularly on hand. No doubt these are a favorite year round cookie!!!!"
"0","4","good stuff...but i tried to make cut out cookies with this recipe but it doesn't work out so well because they get a little poofey...good cookie though"
"0","5","Definitely the easiest and best cookies I've ever tasted! Thanks!"
"0","5","Very nice sugar cookie recipe"
"0","5","My husbands family love these cookies, make them at xmas and give them in a pack full of goodies. Yummy!"
"0","4","excellent recipe, easy to make, and turn out absolutely perfect! Thanks so much"
"0","4","These came out very good! It was my first time making sugar cookies. I chilled the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours and made them into cut-out cookies, and added sprinkles on top before baking. They did spread a little but they came out not too chewy, not too crispy. The only thing i changed with the recipe was a little extra vanilla."
"0","1","do not use.... cookies come out horrible"
"0","3","These were good, not as great as I was hoping for the rating it has. They were a little bland. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I think I will try a recipe that lets the mix sit for several hours. That may have been what was missing"
"0","4","i thought they were very good i put some jam preservatives in the middle i thought they were a little floury though"
"0","5","LOVE THEM! This ones a keeper! Had rave reviews, Ill be making these every Christmas!"
"0","5","SOOO GOOD!! This recipe was great. It was so easy and they came out perfect. Make sure to take them out right at 8 minutes and you'll have yummy soft cookies. Great recipe!"
"0","4","These came out cake-like to me as I wanted something with a chewy center and a little crisp on the outside and stayed soft until I was ready for more later. I use half of the baking soda & powder which is required. A half tsp more vanilla, 1/4 more sugar and about 1/8 less flour. I kind of eyeball what I do with the ingredients so this is probably very close. And yeah the cookies do spread so I don't bother trying to make cut-outs at all. Thanks anyways for a great stepping stone."
"0","4","These cookies came out great! I did use extra vanilla and I read the other reviews that stated to take them out at 8 minutes even if they don't look quite done. I'm glad I did - they were perfect!"
"0","5","This is the number one, Best sugar cookie recipe ever !!!! I have found that if you add just a little water to the dough when you are kneading it,, it is easier to work with..."
"0","5","these cookies were really great. and u can tweak it really easily. i used half as much sugar to make them more cake-like"
"0","5","THESE WERE GREAT. I USED SELF RISING FLOUR AND ROLLED SOME IN SUGAR AND PUT A HERSHEY KISS IN SOME OF THEM. THEY ARE SO EASY AND WERE GONE QUICK. EVERYONE WANTED THIS RECIPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"0","5","These cookies are GREAT!!!my 4 yr old loved the fact that he could help.I will be making these again"
"0","3","These were ok. I enjoyed the act of making them with my daughter. I am not a big fan of sugar cookies."
"0","5","EXCELLENT thank you so much!!!"
"0","4","This is the best sugar cookie recipe that I have ever done. The dough is easily rolled for cut out cookies. This is one that I will definately use year after year."
"0","4","this was a great recipe to try. i loved how they came out. 8min is just the right amout of time(if you want them soft). i also used this recipe to make thumbprint cookies and stuck strawberry jam in the middle."
"0","5","What a great recipe! Quick and easy to make, and the yummiest sugar cookies I have every made!"
"0","4","I loved the cookies! They were extremely easy to make except they were super flat! They came out like 48 sheets of circular paper. Are they supposed to be like this? Help! Otherwise very very yummy!"
"0","4","These cookies would get 5 stars for ease of preparation. My 12 year old daughter pulled this recipe off this page and she makes them for the family often. They are not the best sugar cookies ever, but great for beginning bakers."
"0","1","I thought this recipe was terrible. The consistency of the dough was horrible! I let it chill in the fridge overnight and the dogh was still way too sticky to use for rolling and cookie cutting. I tried cooking them anyway and the cookies tasted bland. No good."
"0","5","Yummy! I agree this recipe is quick & easy. I will definately be making these cookies again!"
"0","5","Awesome. I needed cookies at the last minute and these are ingredients you have laying around."
"0","5","Turn out very tasty and easy to make!"
"0","4","wow. these are REALLY rich. i've never made sugar cookies from scratch and was surprised by the consistency of the dough. they are very good, but in my opinion, border on butter cookies instead of sugar. unless i did something wrong, which is entirely possible..."
"0","5","These cookies are great and easy to make.I am a baker at a University,and the students love these cookies!"
"0","5","Excellent...Yummy! On a cold Sunday afternoon I felt like sugar cookies but nothing time consuming...found this recipe, read the reviews and 30 minutes later I tasted the best sugar cookies ever. Highly recommend. A++++"
"0","5","Quick and easy, these cookies were wonderful!  If you want to shape them, put the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours before rolling them out.  A simple icing of confectioner's sugar and milk goes well with them."
"0","5","These are so wonderful! The best sugar cookies I have ever had. I rolled them out and did cutout cookies and topped them with a lemon icing I made with powdered sugar, fresh lemon juice and a little water."
"0","5","Mmmmm! Soft, chewy, buttery. Not too sweet, not too floury. The perfect sugar cookie! I halved the recipe and now I'm wishing I made the whole batch!"
"0","4","They were easy to make and good. Super quick to make."
"0","5","These sugar cookies were not too sweet or too floury. The consistency was perfect, almost sticky, but definately not dry. I added pineapple, a bit of raspberry preserves, and some key lime juice to spice it up a bit without adding frosting. Definately delicious. I will continue adventuring with this recipe."
"0","1","I won't be making this again the dough was way to sticky i had to put it in the freezer it has a bad floury after taste and i think i'll stick to alresy made dough"
"0","5","I love this recipe. Very simple and a joy to make. I add peanut butter and can eat these for days!. I make a batch and take half to work. I don't want to eat them all myself!"
"0","1","This recipe calls for you to cook the cookies for 8-10 minutes, i found them to be done in 6-7 minutes, they are very crunchy!"
"0","5","Reminded me of the sugar cookies we had at school growing up. I made them quickly yesterday and my family loved them! I did frost half of them and they were just as good."
"0","5","This is without a doubt the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever had. Just the right size and texture. GREAT"
"0","5","These cookies are excellent! Very soft and chewy and easy to make. I rolled some in sugar and have also tried frosting them, which worked out well too, but they are great plain as well."
"0","3","It was ok but definatly will not be making again. It's alittle too flour-y for my, and my friends, taste. But still... it was very simple to make."
"0","4","it was too flour-y and didnt have the taste i was looking for, but this was the most decent recipe for sugar cookies i have come across"
"0","3","This recipe was simple, but just o.k. My dough wasn't firm AT ALL. It was sticky and goopy. I just spooned it onto the baking sheet that way. There wasn't much flavor to these. You can stick a candy or chocolate morsel in the center, but you must put it in immediately after it comes out of the over or it will harden too qiuckly. I thought that this recipe was just so-so."
"0","3","I really wasn't impressed with this recipe. I found it too eggy tasting abd bland. had to be thrown out. Won't be making this again."
"0","1","Theses cookies were the worst thing I have ever tasted and when I took them out of the oven they were Purple!!!!GROSS!!!! I gave this recipe to a friend who is a cook and when she made them they were as hard as rocks. I was makeing these cookies for a charity event and when nobody ate my cookies because they looked and tasted so bad, I was furiuos!!!!"
"0","4","Pretty good but not truly wonderful...yet. Super easy and overall fairly good. About 1/3 of the way through baking the batch I decided they were missing something so I tossed in about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar and added another 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. The rest of the batch was awesome. Overall a good recipe, just needed a little something extra."
"0","5","Very easy and really tasty. I let the bottoms brown a little so they were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside. Followed the recipe exactly. Don't expect to roll out and cut because it was too mushy even after refrigeration."
"0","2","Not terrible but not good. Won't make this one again. Not sure if I did something wrong or what....but just not chewy or soft or anything...worth a shot if you know how to adjust your recipes ;)"
"0","5","Quick and easy and oh so yummy! Thanks!"
"0","2","These cookies were too sugary for me."
"0","4","I was craving some cookie dough and this hit the spot. The cookies are in the oven right now, and I bet they will be delicious. I added some lemon extract for extra flavor, and salt because it was way too sweet without it, although they ARE sugar cookies."
"0","3","Taste is great but the dough crumbled! Next time i might add water or use less flour. Other than that, GREAT!"
"0","5","i LOVED this recipe. my friend and i added a bit extra vanilla, and then a bit of peanut butter to the mixture. they came out amazing!!"
"0","5","This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever used! Definitely worth trying.... you will be addicted!"
"0","4","The recipe is great! The taste was a little strange, but they taste really good with frosting and milk."
"0","5","Amazing. Incredible. Great. Make this recipe - don't change a thing. Perfect."
"0","5","My whole family loves these cookies and they are so easy to make!"
"0","5","Super easy and turned out great, crispy and a little chewy. The kids loved helping make them and making them disappear."
"0","5","Beautifully simple recipe with great results. My family LOVED these. They are a perfect sugar cookie. I used a cookie scoop (larger than the suggested teaspoon)and baked them 14 minutes."
"0","5","these are the best sugar cookies ever!! everyone I know who has tasted them has asked for the recipe...and they are so easy to make."
"0","5","This cookie was simply amazing! I added a thin layer of vanilla Betty Crocker frosting on top, and made them to look like volleyballs by drawing lines on them with food dye markers. The whole team absolutely loved them."
"0","5","These are great...and they really are easy! The dough is nice to work with; I often make these for holidays and events at school (the kids really love them!). They are great paired up with the sugar cookie icing (or the frosting...I've used both)."
"0","5","These were great, definately a keeper. I did as another person had done and only left them in for 8 minutes and they came out perfect. I didn't try it this time due to not have ingredients on hand but I think throwing some white choc chips and macadamia nuts into the mix would make these great. My kids loved them."
"0","5","I was out of vanilla, so I added almond extract. They were awesome! Sort of like marzipan sugar cookies. These were super easy. My 5 year old helped me, it was a fun activety for a rainy day!"
"0","3","I just made these cookies, and while the flavor is excellent, they were much too dry! I had to throw out the entire batch. My under-experienced cooking did not afford me the knowledge as to how to fix the dryness (I didn't know what to add to save it). Or perhaps I used the wrong measurements?"
"0","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever used I doubled the recipe and froze half but I think I'm going to have to get those out of the freezer soon because they are almost gone."
"0","5","Like everyone has said before - this is a really really good sugar cookie recipe! I did add 1/2 an egg and sprinkled the top with sugar to add a little something -- both my new hubby and I were very happy with the results."
"0","4","so good best i've made so far !"
"0","4","This recipe is really good if you're just dying for some cookies. I really likes that the cookies don't need to be in the fridge for hours and hours. These cookies will be so good if you put in like less than 1/4 tsp of almond extract in with the vanilla and some lemon berbena (ground). It was really good. Also a good tip is to leave the cookies in the fridge after you bake them and they sooo much better chilled."
"0","4","I really liked this recipe. Since I like to actually TASTE the sugar in sugar cookies I added an extra 1/2 cup sugar to the batch....and also a teaspoon of almond extract. Soooo yummy!!!!!"
"0","5","Really simple, really delicious sugar cookie!"
"0","4","Good cookie, put andes chips in extra. Added a little extra flour, 2 cups sugar, half cup confectioners sugar, and extra egg. First batch was trash. Don't flatten, make balls a little larger than 1 teaspoon, cook 8 mins."
"0","4","I made these and they were great. The ratios could have been a little better though. When i made mine the batter wasnt stiff enough. But they tasted great."
"0","5","These are really good. The easiest sugar cookies i've ever made, and no rolling pin, ya gotta love that."
"0","5","These were the best sugar cookies I've ever had, but I substituted butter flavor crisco for the butter"
"0","5","Easy, fast recipe that produced cookies with a lovely texture and flavor (crisp edges, chewy centers). We used a cookie scoop and got cookies that look just like the ones in the lovely picture submitted by Angie. I like how the tops have that crackled look. We frosted some with leftover chocolate cream cheese frosting, and left some plain."
"0","3","These cookies are okay if you don't have the time to make rolled sugar cookies. They taste a lot like snickerdoodles except without the cinnamon. Would use in a pinch, but if I have time will make the rolled sugar cookies."
"0","5","These turned out really well. I've never made great cookies before but these were really good. My son is taking them to a bake sale at school. They were easy to make and turned out perfectly. I only got 3 dozen tho... not 4."
"0","5","I've tried baking sugar cookies before & they never came out that good but these ones were PERFECT."
"0","5","Excellent recipe that doubles or even triples perfectly. We even used cookie stamps successfully with this recipe. True, these cookies don't hold the design like a shortbread would, but the design was still visible enough to add variety to the batch."
"0","5","Way too good! I can't quit eating them. They are amazingly good with homemade frosting on them! Great recipe!"
"0","5","greate recipe my family loved it"
"0","5","The best cookies ever!!!!!!!! Thanks a lot! I loved them."
"0","5","this is the easiest sugar cookie recipe!!! A little bland, but really great with frosting!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at sugar cookies and was A TOTAL SUCCESS!! I have picky children (yes, lord help me, even picky with cookies) and they were gone almost immediatly. I did however follow the other members advice and added the extra egg - i already make things too dry, so i was erring on the side of caution. They are so fast and easy, they are ALL 4 kids' pick for their school snack and share day!! Thanks so much!"
"0","4","Pretty good recipe. I used it as the crust for a fruit pizza. The dough is pretty sticky, but that is to be expected from sugar cookie dough (that is why most recipes call for refridgeration). The cookie was soft and yummy, but it gets a 4 not 5 because it isn't 'the best' plain sugar cookie. But it was easy and really good!!!! It isn't too sweet and is perfect for fruit pizza or frosting!"
"0","5","We made this recipe twice in the last 24 hours because the first batch was gone in a matter of hours. Extra delicious right out of the oven and very easy to do. We rolled some of them in cinnamon sugar which was also very good. We did some in a sugar glaze but felt it was too sweet."
"0","1","i should have stuck with my own recipe for sugar cookies, this was the worst, i had to add a lot more butter than the recipe called for in order for it to stick together, the cooking time was wayy to long, my first batch burnt, then to top it all off they were the worst tasting sugar cookies i've had. definitely won't be making this one again"
"0","5","The best everyone loved them. My son wanted to add some food coloring to them and we made them all kinds of colors we had fun making them and eating them too. Also I used them as a base for chocolate cookies and they turned out great, just add your chips and bake."
"0","5","really easy to make! i whipped these up last minute. only thing the cookies need is more sugar! i added more sprinkled on top, but i would add more to the dough next time."
"0","5","i LOVED these cookies. I was searching for cookies for Easter and i thought I'd try these out. So i did and shared them with family aqnd friends. They all said How did you make these! They are delicious!!"
"0","5","Very tasty. I definately recommend using butter versus margarine."
"0","3","I hate to give a bad review, but I have to be honest here. Okay, these cookies get five stars for taste, and five stars for an easy recipe....but maybe one star for appearance.  I used large cookie sheets and placed the dough balls about one inch apart. After 8 minutes in the oven, I opened the door and to my great surprise there was only one giant, cookie-pan shaped cookie. They all spread right into each other and lost their own identity. When I tried to remove them from the pan, they just fell apart. (But they still tasted AMAZING!!!) So for my next tray, I kept the dough balls two inches apart, which was not at all practical.  This worked out a little better for me. I'm not sure what I did wrong, maybe my butter was not soft enough. Like I said, the cookies tasted great, but I would never want anyone to see what they looked like. The cookies' appearance was embarassing."
"0","4","I loved how easy it was, but added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to it, and then I threw in some Lemon flavoring in one batch and orange in the other, and they were wonderful, great texture and flavor, my hubby loved them and he doesn't like sweet deserts but he ate them up!!"
"0","3","I wasn't too crazy about these cookies. They tasted too much like the Christmas cookies that I make. The texture was alright, but other than that, there have been much better sugar cookies that I have eaten."
"0","5","These are excellent! So, so good!"
"0","5","Oh So Good! Right on Stephanie"
"0","5","We make these for Girls Nite except we put chocolate in them and pake them in mini-muffin tins: Spudmuffins! And very sweet. Perfect with those chick flicks :D"
"0","5","These were just great. I put a few M&Ms on half the batch and sprinkles on the other. They freeze really well and stay perfectly fresh in a cookie tin."
"0","3","These cookies were ok-my mix was pretty sticky which made it hard to roll into balls. They're harder the 2nd day so they should be eaten the 1st day when fresh & soft."
"0","5","This was just an excellent recipe! I cannot say enough good things about it. The cookies weren't too sweet, they had just the right sweetness. I got so many compliments on them when I made them for Christmas. I will be making these every year from now on. Thanks for this great recipe!"
"0","5","easy and tasty, great base recipe for holiday sugar cookies"
"0","5","After making another recipe that was a disaster this could not have been any easier."
"0","5","Very easy and great tasting. I added a Tablespoon of buttermilk & confectionery sugar to the mix. I don't know if that made any improvement, but everyone loved them."
"0","4","These cookies are really easy to make. I followed the directions exactly and had no problem. The cookies came out looking great and were light and moist when eaten. I added green decorative sugar to the top for the holidays. They aren't the most flavorful sugar cookies I've ever had, but they also require fewer ingredients than most. Next time I might try coating them with a white & brown sugar mix."
"0","5","this recipe was great, i forgot to convert it for a dozen though so i had to make 4 dozen but no one was complaining :) there deliciouse and i added m&m's to it, it was the best"
"0","5","i've never been able to make cookies. they always come out too hard so i blamed it on my oven and gave up for a long time. i came across this and i happened to have all the ingredients in my kitchen so i gave it a shot and they turned out perfect! thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
"0","5","Toooo Easy!! So good Will Melt in your mouth and all you need is to bowls,and a wisk"
"0","4","Great and makes a large amount of cookies"
"0","5","Great cookie recipe! My husband loves them. I decorated them with red and green sugar sprinkles for a more festive look. Delicious!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe for sugar cookies.My man just loved them."
"0","3","these are decent sugar cookies, but i am still trying to figure out why everyone was raving about them.... mine didn't get thin, which was fine. but they just didn't look like the photo on the recipe."
"0","5","Easy to make, excellent tasting!"
"0","5","YUMMY!It's not hard to make at ALLL! It;s sooooooooo delice!"
"0","5","I was having a 'need a cookie NOW' moment and tried this recipe for the first time. SO SIMPLE, SO FAST, SO DELICIOUS!!! Came out PERFECT eventhough I eyeballed all the ingredients. Definitely a keeper!!!"
"0","5","These were awesome! I put a lemon/orange icing on top and my husband loved them."
"0","5","This recipe was amazing! It made such delicious cookies, and I followed the directions precisely and they turned out GREAT! They have a nice flavor, and were easy to make."
"0","3","I thought the cookies were just ok. They tasted more doughy than sweet."
"0","5","These are so easy and they are delicious! Thanks for the great and simple recipe!"
"0","5","i always make these mmmm they are the best  :)"
"0","2","I had to spray the pan to keep them from sticking and they tasted too 'baking powder & soda-y'. Easy recipie but next time I will reduce the baking soda and powder."
"0","5","I loved these cookies, tasted better than store bought. I sprinkled some sugar on the dough before I baked them, which gave them an extra sugary sweet taste. Will definitely bake these again!!!"
"0","4","easy and fun to make and everyone loved them. I personally thought that they may be a little too sweet but that may just be me."
"0","5","Just as everyone says, these are wonderful. I don't think it's possible to screw them up. I used half whole wheat flour/half white as that's what I had on hand. Rolled them in cinnamon sugar. Mine took a little while longer, but my oven wasn't overly hot when I put them in. Lovely, quick - I had a cookie craving and about 20 minutes later, I am enjoying them!"
"0","5","I distributed these among family and they loved them. They stayed crisp on the outside and soft and cakey inside for the couple days they lasted. I added almond extract, and extra vanilla and sugar as suggested in other reviews. I sprinkled a bit of sugar on top before baking and it made a nice crisp to the tops. Mine came out looking like the photo posted by Catalina S. They'd make great snickerdoodles if you add cinnamon to the dough. VERY good, home-made looking cookies."
"0","4","These were simple and good. Sugar cookies are my favorite :)"
"0","5","Excellent sugar cookies!! They were a big hit with everyone. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
"0","5","Simply Amazing!!!!!!!! So quick and the best I have EVER tasted!!!!"
"0","5","I couldn't make these cookies fast enough for everyone to eat! Great and incredibly easy recipe that will used again and again!"
"0","5","great cookie! my husband and 3 yr old daughter whipped these up in the time I fed the baby, and without any problem! Spectacular! They used the microwave to soften the butter (15 seconds per stick=30 sec. total) and 1 extra large egg! I can't wait to try the other half of the batch tomorrow doing cut outs! Thank you, Stephanie!"
"0","5","THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT. IT WAS MY FIRST TIME MAKING SUGER COOKIES FROM A RECIPE. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS AND THEY CAME OUT PERFECT. EXCEPT I DIDN'T COOK THEM AS LONG. I ALSO GOT TIRED OF ROLLING THE COOKIE DOUGH INTO BALLS SO I PUT THE DOUGH INTO A WILTON PIPING BAG. I SQUEEZED OUT THE DOUGH THAT WAY. THE DOUGH DIDN'T EVEN STICK TO THE BAG. I AM MAKING THESE AGAIN TOMMORROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE RECIPE. THESE ARE A GREAT HIT AND I WILL KEEP MAKING THEM."
"0","4","These came out nicely and tasted good too :) Thanks for a simple, tasty recipe!"
"0","4","this recipe is amazing!! but listening to the other reviews, they taste much better with 2 eggs and rolled in cinnamon and sugar."
"0","5","These were amazing. They were easy to make and tasted great."
"0","5","This recipe is awesome, I make it all the time! For a truly delicious variation I make a chocolate ganache with bittersweet chocolate and heavy cream, then dip each cookie halfway into the ganache. Set out on some waxed paper to harden for about an hour and oh-my-goodness you can't resist them! I get requests for these cookies constantly from my firends and family. Thanks for this wonderful cookie recipe! :)"
"0","4","These were very good, and very easy!"
"0","3","They didn't spread out all and turned out really really hard. I didn't care for them much."
"0","5","Excellent taste, easy to make. Thanks!"
"0","5","Yummm!!!!! These are so good!"
"0","5","i use this recipe all the time and everyone always loves them and asks for the recipe. its a keeper!"
"0","5","Great recipe, super easy to make, used maple instead of vanilla, delicious!"
"0","3","okay I guess. I added m&ms and I wasn't all that impressed."
"0","5","pretty good"
"0","5","All I can say is YUMMM_MMMEEE! They were even a hit with my Picky 6 year old:)"
"0","4","I started making the cookies and realized I didn't have any vanilla... so I used honey instead. They turned out great! For a little added sweetness, I drizzled a little honey on top just before eating one. Great!  Who knew?"
"0","5","this recipe was great my children loved it this recipes is for keeps thank you very much"
"0","5","Very easy!!! Loved these cookies. I didn't have to cook them for a solid 10 mintues though. More like 6-8 minutes. I even rolled them in sugar before cooking and they were delicious and light!!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I made the cookies for a birthday party and everyone loved them and ate them all up. They were easy to make, and I will make them often."
"0","5","Absolutley amazing- I rolled them in sugar, and added some milk and a 1/4 tsp of salt to them. SO GOOD!!!!  I also made this for a 'wheel of grub' program at a summer camp I worked for, where the kids answer trivia to win a mystery cookie add-in. The cookies were able to handle all sorts of extra stuff thrown in- honey, chocolate, raisins, etc."
"0","5","Yum! I took them to a dinner party and had the pleasure of watching one of my friends unconsciously reach his hand to the plate for cookie after cookie. Thanks!"
"0","5","These are yummy!! I have made them twice now. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","THEY TASTE GREAT. VERY EASY TO MAKE."
"0","4","pretty good, a little on the dry side, maybe it was my fault?"
"0","3","i don't know what i'm doing wrong. when i made these i thought they would taste like sugar cookies, but they taste more like cookie dough and are cakey. I dopn't know what i'm doing wrong, should i add more butter or more sugar? someone please telll me."
"0","5","Very good! I have made them a lot of times and they always turn out great! Every1 always enjoys them!!! Great recipe!"
"0","5","great"
"0","3","Nice texture but were more like cake than cookies and also I could taste the baking powder and baking soda"
"0","5","Excellent. My stepson loves them!"
"0","4","Just finish baking half of a batch, and they are all gone!!! I think i'll have to bat my family way from these soon! Although the cookies were a bit dry and didnt flat out like it did for the other memebers, it was pretty good. It's a keeper! Thanks for the recipes."
"0","5","These are great. I did end up putting in an extra egg b/c of the notes I read in other people's reviews. I also substituted brown sugar for half a cup of sugar--I ran out of the regular. Today is the second day and they are still soft and delicious. They are great with a little cinnamon sugar sprinkled on before baking."
"0","5","PERFECT! jUST PERFECT!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Quick and easy! The cookies were delicious!"
"0","5","I have made these cookies quite a few times. I do agree with alot of the others that they do get very hard, very quickly. When I stored them in a bag I placed a piece of fresh white bread in the bag and that kept them moist and softer. But aside from that they are a delicious cookie, I have gotten many complements on them. My husband who is not a cookie lover, loves these cookies."
"0","3","A little dry, but still good."
"0","5","These come out perfect everytime! My favorite sugar cookies ever."
"0","5","This recipe was very easy for someone like me ,who doesn't get a chance to bake very often."
"0","5","Quick, Easy, and they tasted great!"
"0","5","Very easy to make and both my husband & son love them!"
"0","5","Efffin Delicious! Only I put store bought lemon icing on top. Yum-O!"
"0","5","my husband loved these cookies!"
"0","4","It's good, but... still not exactly the one I was looking for. I think I like it crispy all the way."
"0","4","This was too dry so I added more butter and some milk and some water but in the end I had to work very hard just to make the cookies stick together. They did taste very good though."
"0","4","To be frank, I was going to give these cookies a 3 stars rating. I found the dough was difficult to work with (too sticky) so I ended up adding more flour. As a result, they didn't flatten out properly. Also, they're easy to make but easy to overbake too, make sure you take them out of the oven after 8 minutes! I let mine a few minutes more and half the batch was hard as a rock! However, the other half turned out delicious and nice-looking (little domes). I added mini chocolate and caramel chips and made them into cookie sandwiches with the cream cheese frosting II from this site. Boyfriend gobbled them down and even went for seconds, which he usually don't since he watches his intake. If it wasn't for the sticky dough, I'd had given them 5 stars!"
"0","5","This recipe was a lifesaver! I tried them before and they were delicious, but I needed a rolled cookie recipe. I tried a few others but the taste and/or consistancy were sub par. I finally decided to use this one and they held up perfectly. Thanks!!!"
"0","5","These are easy and very tasty. It's a keeper!"
"0","5","I am not a cookie maker and these came out great!!! They go great when they are hot and with ice cream."
"0","5","These were very qucik and easy to make with ingredients readily handy in my kitchen. The only modification I made was to use 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown...simply because I ran out. They still turned out great! My kids and husband wouldn't stay out of them! Thanks!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I had my son roll the cookies in colored sugar before popping in the oven and they turned out great not to mention he had fun helping mom! This will be a 'regular' treat in our home for sure! Thankyou for the great recipe."
"0","5","So easy and yummy. A big hit in my house and very easy to make. I rolled them into coarse sugars and the kids love it."
"0","5","soft and chewy cookies, taste great without frosting"
"0","5","My 8 year old loves to make these. They are great!"
"0","5","This was great - a very easy recipe. We frosted the cookies with green frosting and shamrock sprinkles for a preschool and grammer school St. Patrick's Party. They were a big hit. We will be making more this weekend - so we have some to snack on."
"0","5","A delicious cookie! In my oven, 9 minutes at 350 degrees gave the perfect texture. If you roll them in sugar first, they come out with a lovely crinkled top and a slight crunch. For my hubby who likes crunchy cookies, I just baked them a minute or two longer. I'll definitely be making these again!"
"0","4","Very simple and great results. I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar before baking. The kids love them! Next time I am going to try them with a little bit of finely minced lemon zest. Mmm.."
"0","5","these were awesome cookies. I did bake an extra 6 minutes, and they were perfect. I did roll 1/2 the dough and froze to bake a few days later."
"0","5","these cookies were very good, the percect combonation of crunchy and soft. they taste perfect, and were really easy."
"0","4","absolutly awesome family loves them"
"0","4","these were good and i'd make them again. a little crunchy for my taste - i like chewier cookies (could be the little bit of wheat flour i mixed with all purpose - i can't help myself - or maybe i cooked too long)."
"0","5","Easy and good!"
"0","3","These did not turn out at all, I didn;t have any banking soda though and I made them too big. I will try this again, because they did seem easy enough"
"0","5","these were simple and delicious! i'm studying abroad right now, and didn't bring a mixer with me. so, i used a fork from start to finish and the cookies still turned out beautifully. i made a thin frosting (also with a fork), added a touched of sprinkles, and the friend i made them for raved!"
"0","5","Awesome cookies!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome! My hubby loved these, I will definitely make these again and again! They are so good with buttercream frosting, too."
"0","5","These are just great! I put M&Ms on top and the ones with those are better. Brought them into work today and they were gone immediately. Just Great!"
"0","5","Excellent! It was nice to be able to make chewy and crunchy cookies from the same batch of dough by just changing the amount of cook time. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","Very easy to make! Depending on the length that I bake these, I can make them chewy or crispy--both are great."
"0","4","Good taste but a bit too crunchy for my taste. I did rolled/pressed as well as rounded drops, just too hard/crunchy."
"0","5","A very simple to make cookie with a delicious taste and wonderous texture."
"0","5","Yummy! I am 7 months pregnant and almost ate the whole batch myself! Best sugar cookies I have ever made!"
"0","5","These are probably the most amazing cookies I have ever made. Everyone has something good to say about them."
"0","4","These are great, easy sugar cookies. Nice and crisp on the outside and chewy inside. Very versatile too...I just sprinkled sugar on them, but you could decorate a hundred different ways. I had no problems with the cookies spreading out from the 'ball' shape. My oven must be a little off though because it took exactly 12 mins not 8-10. Make sure they are really 'golden' before taking them out or they'll be doughy in the middle. I'll make these again!"
"0","3","I initially was prepared to give this a bad rating. My first batch did not come out to well. The batter would not flatten out. I figured the balls where to big. So when I made batch two I made the balls smaller. They still didn’t flatten out…so I used a spoon to flatten them. For batch three I decided to roll the dough out flat, since they wouldn’t flatten when I baked them. Batch three was much better. I topping them with some strawberry icing and they were tasty."
"0","4","I'm not a big baker but wanted some heart shape cut outs for Valentine's Day. This fit the bill since I happen to have all ingredients and it has wonderful ratings. I agree. Yummy! Wish I would have doubled it for more!"
"0","5","The cookies were delicious! I've made them twice now and the second time I added a little less suger but put in peanut butter chips and those went very well together."
"0","5","Super easy and very yummy. Has a permanent home in my cookie collection."
"0","5","Taste great and super easy! We just had drop in company and absolutely nothing to serve, so I popped onto All Recipes and found this recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand, it took almost no time at all, and turned out great. I hate sugar cookies, but loved these. My husband and our guest gave great reviews."
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for quite some time and just wanted to say how wonderful these cookies are. My son will only eat sugar cookies and is forever wanting these cookies. Thanks so much! Just perfect!"
"0","5","Let me tell you.. this was a GREAT recipe.. My boyfriend even loved it, he helped me make them and everything, we did it for xmas cookies.. I made 2 batches i put red food coloring in one and green in the other, i rolled them out and made sugar cookies pinwheels and just put the colored sugars on top. They were a HIT! Thanks for the recipe!~"
"0","5","These turned out perfectly, crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle. I did add a little salt per other reviews, to give them that extra little flavour. These sugar cookies were just what I was looking for! Thanks!"
"0","5","Dynamite! These cookies are dangerously good. I added a touch of salt to give them a kick. Very easy. Perfectly chewy."
"0","5","Amazing. So simple, perfect sweetness. Too good to be true, but it is! Such an easy recipe i couldnt believe it. Increase the recipe, they are gone fast!"
"0","5","Very good recipe. I did add 1 teaspoon of cream o tartar. These cookie were soft and chewy just how my family likes them. My family ate the entire batch in 2 days. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","4","I loved the flavor of these cookies! I searched and searched and found almost exactly what I was looking for. I made them exactly as stated in the recipe and they didn't quite turn out as large as I wanted. They were great right out of the oven but the next day they were still chewy but not very soft any longer. Next time I will make them larger and see if this helps. Great taste!"
"0","5","Great cookies, easy to make!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! I brought it with me for a friend when we baked cookies with all of the kids, and it was SO simple, even the youngest could really 'help'. New favorite in this, and that household! In fact, I'm baking some tonight for a school event ;)"
"0","4","I liked the cookies and thought they were good."
"0","5","Didn't have any problems with the recipe as it was. The dough was thick, but not too dry or hard to work with, the cookies cooked up perfectly from 'balls', tasted great, and kept their softness."
"0","4","delicious! had a strange twinge to them, but i think it was my cooking spray."
"0","5","These were very good cookies. Never made sugar cookies before and I dropped them off the spoon and cooked them without pressing them down alittle. After the first batch the rest were perfect. They didn't make it though the christmas holiday. Thanks for the recipe. I will be putting them on a recipe card for future use."
"0","5","I have to admit, to ease stress on Christmas eve, I normally buy those tubes of cookie dough to make cookies for Santa with my kids. This year I totally forgot and was reminded by my 7 year old that we had to make the cookies tonite b4 she went to bed. Found this recipe and they turned out GREAT! Very easy! Thanks Stefanie!"
"0","4","These turned out pretty good. They were a little more sugary than I prefer."
"0","5","A classic sugar cookie recipe. I cut the butter in 1/2 & substituted it w/ crisco (butter flavored) but in turn had to add an extra egg & a dash of salt. I've made them like this once & strictly by the directions once & it's a toss up. But substituting the crisco definitely made them less greasy."
"0","2","I was extremely dissapointed with this recipe. I might as well buy the pillsbury cookie dough, it tastes better."
"0","4","This is a very good sugar cookie! The only trouble I had with it is, that it didn't hold the shape of the cookie cutter to well. Maybe, it's not meant for cookie cutters?? But, besides that it is a very good cookie. One of the best I have ever had! Thanks!"
"0","5","These cookies came out AWESOME! And were EASY! After I mixed the ingredients & it was crumbly, my daughter and I washed our hands GOOD and played with the dough. It came out great. Nice and soft. She patted some down and used cookie cutters to make a few. I made logs out of the rest. We wrapped both (logs & cut outs) in waxed paper & set in the freezer for awhile. (We played a board game.) Then I sliced a log and put them with the cut outs on a baking sheet and baked them. They came out PERFECT! Her shapes stayed shapes and tasted great!"
"0","5","These were easy and wonderfully tasty!"
"0","5","Very yummy, just how I like them. In addition to making the cookies as directed, I made a sugar free version for a diabetic friend, using sucralose in place of sugar. They're a different texture, the sugar free cookies are drier and more cakey, but they're not bad. Not as good as the original though."
"0","5","This was a wonderful recipe. the recipe is easy great tasting. My kids loved it. Usually sugar recipes are hard but not this I will make this my number one sugar recipe"
"0","4","Easy to make, and pretty good cookies too. I would have given them 5 stars but the dough was a little crumbly and the cookies aren't as chewy as I would've liked. But overall, a great recipe! Try it!"
"0","5","This is just the recipe I have been looking for! I used this recipe to make Christmas cookies and the dough was so easy to work with. These cookies had a great flavor and were made even better with the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe from this site. This one is definitely a keeper-thank you!!"
"0","5","I am not a baker, and I tried this recipe after a long day with my 5 year old twin grandsons, and it worked perfectly. I found the dough easy to work with for both an adult and small children. They tasted great as well."
"0","5","Fabulously Easy & Delicious! My sweet critic (hubby) rated these a 5++ star"
"0","4","I followed recipe as laid out. I did notice it was dry and added 1t cream. I wanted to add more but my beater broke. I put dough in frig overnight. It rolled nice and I didn't have to use flour. The dough did not need to be real cold to roll either. The only thing about the cookies was once cooked they lost shape. Meaning, I has a cutout of an ivy leaf, bell, and gingerbread man and once cooked they no longer had their shapes. Cookies taste great."
"0","5","Recipe was easy to follow, cookies were crunchy on the outside while remaining chewy on the inside. Might try using this same recipe as a base for snickerdoodles next...."
"0","4","This is a great recipe and I would definitely do again. I suggest adding milk because the dough is extremely dry and I turned my oven down to 350 because my oven bakes quickly."
"0","5","Very Easy, Very Tasty...simply said."
"0","5","excellent recipe. just what ive been looking for!!!"
"0","5","I substituted the butter for crisco butter flavor shortening and I added 4 Tbsp. of milk because it was very crumbly and dry after i mix it together. I just made them about an hour ago and they are almost all gone. I was told that I need to make some more. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Angie!!"
"0","4","Very easy, and fun to do with the kids. Taste good too!"
"0","4","Right now I am chewing on these wonderful cookies. They are slightly tangy, but excellent! Thet look exactly like the picture,"
"0","4","These were easy to make. I did not need to refrigerate them..they rolled easily into balls. the first batch I flattened with a fork. the second batch I did not and they were much better..softer and fluffier in the middle. Only needed to bake them for 8 min. Will make again."
"0","4","Decent, easy recipe, but I agree with others that the cookies come out a bit on the dry side. So they are better with a glass of milk. ;) I took some of my batch and mixed in some strawerry preserves for sugar, and this made the cookies a little more chewy/moist and gave them a pretty swirl."
"0","5","Wow! I wish I found this recipe before I tried this other one, which turned out to taste horible. So I decided to find another one, and well no more looking for me, Cause I believe Im going to stick to this one. They are *GREAT*.They were very dry but I didnt add anything I decided to try it anyways and they still turned out awsome. *A bunch of thumbs up from everyone in my house*"
"0","5","These are perfect! I made them for my son's pre-school class and all the teachers asked for the recipe. I have made them several times since, and have received nothing but compiments!"
"0","5","These are excellent!"
"0","5","I made these cookies with a seven-year-old, and they were great! They are easy and quick to make and were very tasty. We decorated them with M&Ms, colored sugar, sprinkles, and mini Hershey kisses, and followed others' suggestions about flattening them before baking. They were beautiful!"
"0","4","These were good, the whole family liked them, but they were missing something. No one else minded but I thought they hardened and crumbled very quickly. They were still a great quick and simple treat."
"0","5","Very easy, chewy, buttery, great tasting! I sprinkled sugar on top to make them a little sweeter."
"0","5","These were great and so easy! Thanks!"
"0","5","These taste really great! Especially when they are still a little warm. They do get pretty hard and crunchy after they cool though, but still taste great."
"0","4","I just got done trying this recipe, and they turned out great. And I didn't even have to go to the store, could make them with what I had in my pantry.  They're so easy to make, and they come out soft and chewy, just the way my family likes them.  I rolled them in sugar to give them a little bit more texture and sweetness, and flattened them with a fork to help them bake more evenly.  Thanks for the great recipe, will definitely make these again."
"0","5","I just made these (the last batch is cooling as I type) and they are great! flattened or not, they're delicious. I'll be bringing them to the family christmas party for sure!"
"0","5","super easy recipe...with delicious results. These cookies did not last long in our home, and will be a must for the holidays!"
"0","4","Thanks so much for this recipe. I'm not 'the cook' in my house, but I was tonight when I made this after-dinner treat for my husband and son!"
"0","5","WONDERFUL recipe!! Made them 3 times already. Chewy and addicting."
"0","5","My 9 yr old daughter and I made these together for her class. This was so easy to make and a delicious hit."
"0","5","Great cookies! My kids were eating them as fast as I could bake them. They think these cookies are 'the best!'. I followed the directions exactly and the cookies turned out just like the picture. I also rolled some in cinnamon and sugar and they were good too. I tried rolling a few in plain sugar as well, but they don't need it. They are just as good without."
"0","4","These were very good I substitued the sugar with baking splenda. My kids really enjoyed."
"0","5","I enjoyed making these cookies with my 3 year old, very easy and they were great.Thanks!!!"
"0","5","I made this recipe and it was fabulous. My 4 year old son helped me make them, and he also loves these better than chocolate chip cookies. I did make a few adjustments (nothing major), I just turned the teaspoons into tablespoons for the size of the cookie, and cooked them a few minutes longer and they turned out great. Thanks for this very simple recipe."
"0","5","Wonderful, easy, quick recipe. Thank you"
"0","5","These cookies are easy as pie. The dough is not sticky and they come out light and crunchy."
"0","5","A Quick and Easy way to make a great cookie. These cookies were good. I made them as the recipe calls, and just rolled them into small balls, about a heaping teaspoon size. I did not flatten the cookie and they came out great. My husband took them to work to share. They all agree, they are good. TY"
"0","5","REALLY easy recipe, and the 9 minutes on the timer helped me keep track of each batch! Cookies came out perfect. Thank you!!"
"0","5","Not only were these cookies supper yummy, they were sooo easy to make!"
"0","4","The cookies were really tasty, and I'm actually tempted to just make a mix of the dough to eat with friends!! The only thing I found is that is was a bit too dry and kind of hard to roll, I'll add a tablespoon or so of milk next time, I think. I also topped half of mine with cinnamon and sugar and the other half with just sugar, they all came out very well... though I wish they were a bit flatter (I flattened them with a cup but they were still about half an inch high) Will make again with a few variations."
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies ever. They arent too sweet and my 4 yr old son just loves them."
"0","5","Seriously wonderful cookies. I got soooo many compliments on these!! I took them into work and everyone just loved them. They really are easy to make and are great if you want to add your own flair. I put colored sugar on top of some, and slices of almond on others. Yum, yum, yum!"
"0","5","Great cookie, but not due to my reading skills....... i accidentally put 2 eggs and 2 tsp of vanilla.... i wondered why my mix was loose. But I have to say even with my messup they turned out great. I also added some lemon zest, 1/2 cup extra sugar and covered with cinnamon sugar. I used a 2oz scoop and lightly pressed with the bottom of a glass. My cookies spread just a bit and were beautiful and tasty. They look and taste like my local deli cookie. I will try the original recipe, but this is a keeper."
"0","5","i don't bake & this was so easy & tasted like i spent all day on"
"0","5","Delicious and very easy!"
"0","5","These turned out perfect for me. I ended up putting most of the dough into a pizza pan and just spread it out with my fingers. It turned out nice and crispy which is how I wanted it because I was going to crush them for something else anyway. I didn't need to crush the whole thing so I just cut it into squares and put buttercream icing on them. Quick and easy if you need something in a hurry. Would be great as M&Ms or something with candy. Thanks!"
"0","4","Can't believe I am saying this, I have made this twice and I realized what they are missing; salt. They taste slightly bland without it. I would either add salt or use salted butter. It adds a deeper flavor."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. My family loved it and we will keep it as a family favorite!"
"0","5","These were really great, I made them in a bar pan to make a 'Fruit Pizza' with. I have lost what I thought was the absolute best sugar cookie recipe EVER, but these came in a VERY close second, and that is a compliment considering the recipe I have is from a lady who makes them professionally! Thanks for being a lifesaver w/ this recipe!"
"0","5","these were REALLY good. i made them last minute for a function tomorrow and they take no time at all. i also made the sugar cookie frosting to put on them, and it makes them even more amazing. try them!"
"0","5","Absolutely the best sugar cookies I've ever made using Allrecipes...however, you may need to add a few tablespoons of butter to the recipe to make the cookie softer and more flavorful"
"0","5","These are very easy to make and delicious. They are chewy and tasty. I highly recommend them."
"0","5","This is a great easy sugar cookie recipe. The girls in my dorm just 'tore' them up;)"
"0","5","I also rolled mine in cinnamon & sugar and it made them look very neat. I'm going to *try* to save some for everyone else. These are great!"
"0","5","I used whole wheat pastry flour (but only 2 1/2 c) and brown sugar. I also added another tsp of vanilla and about a tsp of white vinegar to the wet ingredients, and 1/4 tsp salt to the dry ingredients. I rolled them into balls and did not flatten...cooked them for 9 minutes and they were wonderful! Perfectly shaped, nice and chewy. Yes, they are greasy...but they are cookies! Simple and good."
"0","5","Awesome sugar cookie recipe!! Try these, you'll be so pleased with the outcome. So easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! It's so simple and turns out great. I discovered this while searching for an easy recipe with ingredients I already had most of. Now it's my go-to cookie of choice!"
"0","4","These were pretty good - I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar before baking. I guess with all of the great reviews I was expecting more. My 2 yr. old daughter really liked them, though!"
"0","4","These cookies came out a little harder than I had expected. They tasted eggy, but otherwise, they were chewy in the center and reminded me of the Asian almond cookies."
"0","5","These are WONDERFUL! I ate three within five minutes of them coming out of the oven! I also made them vegan by using dairy free margarine and using 1/4 cup of apple sauce instead of an egg. They turned out perfectly moist and slightly chewy. Will be my new sugar cookie recipe!"
"0","5","great cookies"
"0","5","These cookies turned out amazing! It is rare I have all of the ingredients in my kitchen without having to go to the store! They turned out sooo chewy and sweet and ahhh! I love them! It was hard for me to refrain from just eating the dough!"
"0","5","Yummy! Easiest sugar cookies I ever made and definatelyn the best!"
"0","5","These worked out great. I used Splenda instead of the sugar and they still ended up yummy. I did flatten them out with a glass b/c when I cooked the first batch, they didn't expand and stayed in the little balls. Also, I dipped them in chocolate & covered that with sprinkles for an extra added 'pretty' factor. Good cookies! Will make again."
"0","5","Wow, this was simple to make and a surprisingly elegant little cookie. I used lemon oil in place of the vanilla since I prefer lemon kissed cookies. The cookies were tender, moist and did not flatten out at all. I really creamed the butter and sugar to make the cookies really tender. What a perfect little cookie."
"0","4","Well, I am gearing up for a bake sale with the youth from our church so there will likely be a lot of cookie reviews from me today. These were great! So easy to make. My only complaint is that my hands hurt from rolling the dough into balls."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe. I didn't change a thing!! Very soft cookie. The best sugar cookie recipe I've tried. It's a keeper."
"0","5","These were really easy cookies to make. I hate cut out cookies, so these were perfect. I used the small Pampered Chef cookie scoop and ended up baking them for 11 minutes. They didn't really flatten much, which was fine with me since I love puffy sugar cookies. Really fast to make and tasted good."
"0","5","o my goodness! waht excellent cookies! i needed to make cookies for school, but at the last moment my mother couldnt take me to the grocery store. so, i went online, looking for a fast, easy, simple recipe, that i could do in a short amount of time. here i found it! and these cookies are first class, if i do say so myself! thank you, i hope everyone enjoys these as much as me and my class did!"
"0","3","The cookie tasted good, but they flattened out way too thin and got very crispy...not chewy or soft at all. I baked the first batch too long, but after a day, ALL the cookies were hard as rocks...not just the over-cooked ones. I threw most of them out. Sorry, but I'll keep looking for a good, thick & chewy sugar cookie."
"0","5","A quick, fun, and yummy recipe I made with my two year old. I flattened the balls out a tiny bit, which made a big difference in keeping the insides not too doughy. We will definitely be making this again!"
"0","5","this was great just like when my grandma used to make them!!!!"
"0","5","They tasted awesome and were really easy to make. I added some lemon juice and a little more vanilla. I also put a hershey kiss in the middle of them which made them even better."
"0","4","These really were great sugar cookies! They were very easy to make, the dough was wonderful and everybody loved them. The only problem was that they did REALLY flatten out during baking.  Other than that, they are a great first cookie!"
"0","5","I have been looking for a quick and easy cookie recipe and this was perfect. My 4 year old son had alot of fun making this with me. It was very easy for him to roll into balls and drop into the cookie sheet. Next time we will try adding some M and M's on top. I thought it tatsed pretty good and I am sure when my other kids are home later today, the cookies will be gone. Thanks!"
"0","4","I wanted a quick cookie recipe to make with my 3 year old and with this i got it..i had to change a few things i added a extra egg, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar and about 2 tb. spoons of lemon juice and they came out terrific i will be makeing them again really soon."
"0","4","These had a really nice flavor. The texture was not quite what I was looking for. The outside of the cookie gets very crispy...center stays nice and soft. But if you like doughy cookies, only cook 7 mins. They are completely white - no brown edge, but believe me, they sit 2 mins and the outside gets crispy. 5 stars for flavor, 4 stars for texture."
"0","5","These were easy to make and the kids loved them!  Thank you for sharing."
"0","4","I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract...just as my grandma always does. That helped the flavor. I also put M&Ms on top of some of them for a bake sale, and rolled the others in white sugar."
"0","5","I agree with some of the others, this cookie didn't have too much flavor, but I LOVED the chewy inside. I thought maybe I had done something wrong at first because the batter was soo soft, but they cooked fine."
"0","5","This is sugar cookie heaven! I love chewy cookies and this fits the bill. I rolled mine in sparkling sugar (larger than sanding sugar) and they look as good as they taste!"
"0","5","This recipe was great! Most sugar cookie recipes make you refridgerate or freeze the dough for a couple hours, not sure why. But this recipe was a cinch to make. The only thing is, it's a bit bland, so I added fresh lemon zest to taste along with the vanilla extract. Gotta try this one :-)"
"0","5","These are very good sugar cookies, made with my kids and receive lots of good feedback. I always frost. Be sure not to under or over bake. GREAT Recipe :)"
"0","4","Delicious. I had to cook them longer than the recipe suggested for them not to be too doughy. I may try again with less butter because they really flattened out."
"0","5","These are the best sugar cookies ever. I love them! They are soft and moist and yummy and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe at least three times and everybody loves them. The last batch I made I put MM's in the middle of them, it was great."
"0","4","I rolled out the dough and sprinkled with colored sugar. The cookies were crewy and delicious. I will make these again!"
"0","3","Pretty good flavor, but the dough was dry."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Sometimes I just use lemon extract or add cinnamon and nutmeg. Cookies turn out perfect every time and are so easy to make!"
"0","5","they were quick to make... soft, chewy & yummy ! I added M&M's milk chocolate baking bits to some of my batch as well"
"0","5","As my 3 year old who helped make them said, 'Mmmm...good.' These are great! We'll be making these over and over."
"0","5","I am not a baker and this was great. It was very easy and the cookies were wonderful. I used splenda sugar instead. I also flatened the cookies a little to add some sprinkles. They turned out wonderful."
"0","5","Easy and delicious. Last night I decided to make some sugar cookies, as I was having a cookie craving and had minimal ingredients. I am so glad I found this recipe! It was easy and quick to make. I was munching on a cookie in less than 20 minutes. The cookies come out very soft and chewy. And surprisingly the ones I packed for lunch today and the one I am currently munching were still soft and chewy."
"0","4","A nice and easy recipe to make. The children really love the cookies, but it was a little too sweet for me...hence the name."
"0","5","These are wonderful! Easy and they taste delicious! I added the pinch of salt as others recommended. I also halfed the recipe. GREAT RECIPE!"
"0","3","I didn't want to make 48 cookies, so I made 24. Unfortuantly, I used the wrong kind of pan and the cookies tasted a little bit too sugary. This recipe was ok other then those things though!"
"0","5","Yummy! Tasted great. I think that they are better warm but that might just be me."
"0","5","Dang...them are some good cookies...I used almond instead of vanilla and they are very yummy...I got 42 cookies that were good sized cookies by rollong a ball and using a cup to make them circle cookies then spiknled them with colored sugar...YUM!"
"0","5","Great,simple basic cookie recipe. Add your kid's favorite toppings, and they'll scream for more."
"0","5","These were definitely easy and some of the best I have ever had. I made Christmas cutouts and they turned out so great! This recipe makes plenty of dough for a lot of cookies. They are not too soft but not too crunchy either. In my opinion, the best sugar recipe on this site. I tired another and they were cakey. These are ideal for holiday baking."
"0","2","I don't know guys.. i made it and i wasn't too crazy bout this.. it was ok.."
"0","5","I went through so many sugar cookie recipes and I made these this morning and it was just what I wanted. I cooked them just as described. They came out perfect!!!! Not hard. A little crunchy on the outside and soft inside. I will highly recommend these to all my friends."
"0","5","This recipe was so easy!! And the cookies are delicious! My 6 year old son helped me and we had so much fun. The dough was a little sticky, but I worked around it."
"0","5","OH MY GOD! These are delicious. I've tried about 7 different sugar cookie recipes and this one beats it hands down. I've finally found a recipe I will keep and continue to make for years to come."
"0","5","I thought these cookies came out great and they cook very quickly, thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious! Simple to make and tastes great too. I cooked the first batch a tad too long, so they were a little to crispy- 8 minutes on each batch later was perfection!"
"0","5","These are awesome. They might be a little crispy on the outside but its soft in the middle yummy!! nice recipe"
"0","5","Exactly as described, quick and easy! I liked them taken out just before browning to leave them a little softer, but that was at 7-8 minutes. Awesome and easy, especially for busy moms!"
"0","3","Alright, did I do something wrong? It's possible... I've never made sugar cookies or cutout cookies before... mainly cause they're not my favorite cookies to eat. But since I now have a 5 year old it seemed to be the thing to do for the holidays. I picked this recipe. I am without a doubt underwhelmed. Again, it might be something I did wrong. The cutout cookies LOOK pretty but the taste isn't anything to brag about. Oh well... I tried..."
"0","5","These cookies were awesome! I'll never buy a 'store bought' sugar cookie again. They were so easy to make and I always have those ingredients on hand, I can make them anytime I get a sweet tooth!"
"0","3","This recipe was easy but not good if you want a soft cookie, still tasty."
"0","5","I couldn't believe how delicious these cookies were!! I only chose this recipe because I didn't have any cream of tartar. I didn't believe they'd turn out so yummy! After two days they still were moist and chewy!! I added some grated lemon peel to make them extra yummy!"
"0","5","Easy. Just like a sugar cookie should be."
"0","4","I really liked these cookies! Super easy, but I had to keep them in the oven about two minutes longer. I also sprinkled a bit of white sugar on top of the cookies like my great grandma did when she made them! Stayed very moist."
"0","2","I've tried this recipe a couple of times and each time the cookies come out thin and runny. I'm not sure what is going wrong, and I've tried adjusting the amount of flour, the baking time, etc."
"0","3","This cookie baked up beautifully with a very nice texture (soft inside). However, the taste was very bland. I sprinkled sugar & cinnamon on the top, but it was still missing something. I actually think it would be better if a little salt (maybe 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon) were added."
"0","5","I was looking for a quick and easy sugar cookie for my 3 year old's preschool snack and this was perfect! I rolled the cookies in red and green sugar before baking and flattened them slightly and they came out great. They were also delicious and by far the easiest sugar cookies I ever made. This recipe is a keeper!!"
"0","5","Just baked these cookies.. Followed recipes exactly..and they turned out WONDERFUL... even rolled them out and cut shapes to them. They were perfect crispness for the decorating we will do later :) crunchy but chewy... perfect.. ty for the great recipe !!"
"0","5","First off, thanks for the recipe! I made a batch adding only 1/4 t almond extract (just a hint of extra flavor) and green dye (for christmas). I just about always use my cookie scooper and then half rolled them in green sugar. 8 minutes in my oven and they were PERFECT! They are a great cookie.. got a nice crispy ring on the outer edge and its moist and soft middle. My hubby loved them ( i let him have a few before I am freezing them). Nice simple recipe and came out perfect. And my 6 1/2 month old son thinks the raw cookie dough is good (gave him 3 tiny bits and he said, 'mmmMMm' after each bite)."
"0","5","A very good cookie. This cookie is not a real sweet cookie. So my family just keeos eating them...Yummy!!!"
"0","5","Very Easy....Very Good....Thanks"
"0","4","This recipe makes a good sugar cookie. I didn't modify the recipe at all (I did put sprinkles on them halfway through baking), and it was good just the way it was. Our girls ate them all up quickly! Thanks!"
"0","5","This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever found! They come out just like the sugar cookies you buy in bakeries. I made them last year for Chistmas and everyone loved them."
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! Quick and easy! The cookies stayed moist and fresh. I made them for Halloween and ended up having to make a second batch that night. Definately a keeper."
"0","5","Great recipe. I am the most impatient cook so not having to cool and roll these out made them fabulous. I made huge cookies for my sons' class, so I only got about 22 cookies out of it.  I substituted the butter for shortening since I did not have enough butter. They turned out great. They are not too sweet, just right. I plan to ice them too. All in all this is a fabulous recipe and even though I have my great aunt Rit's recipe for killer sugar cookies, these will be the ones I will make when I want to get them done quickly! Save the other one for special occassions.  Thanks for the recipes Stephanie."
"0","5","These cookies taste sooooo good! And they were super easy. Will definately make again."
"0","5","These sugar cookies are very good and very easy to make. Just the right amount of sweetness. I will be baking these often."
"0","5","These were so good!! I mixed these by hand and half way into pouring the flour in, i realized I forgot the other 1/2 cup of butter.. so I melted it and stirred it in. Not a bit of difference! I put in lots of mini MnM's and baked for exactly 8 mins... they are fantastic!! Still soft the next day!"
"0","4","Read reviews before making - tried upping the sugar and lowering the flour like one reviewer and they came out too sweet for my tastes. Great solid recipe - I added orange extract and they came out wonderful. Dough refrigerates very well - we made one batch of dough and baked a pan every other night for a warm yummy cookie treat each day."
"0","4","Quick and easy!! Delicious!"
"0","5","5 stars for being so easy, and they tasted good too. These came out of the oven looking like a million bucks - perfectly cracked and light golden brown. My kids are professional sugar cookie tasters, so these are okay by me!"
"0","5","I used an ice cream scoop to place big dollops on the cookie sheet and the cookies came out very thick and soft. I also sprinkled sugar on the cookies before baking. I only baked for 6 minutes and the cookies came out perfect. We decorated with food coloring gel tubes."
"0","2","The cookies come out very thin..."
"0","5","Awesome.....Grandmas recipes was nver this good~~!!~~"
"0","5","Good basic recipe!"
"0","5","Yummy! Yummy! I have been searching for a good sugar cookie recipe forever and finally I got one!!! The dough was a perfect consistency and the taste was heavenly. I did make some changes--I uped the sugar to two cups and lowered the flour to a cup and 1/2. Also, I sprinkled the prebaked dollups with sugar. Kuddos to Stephanie!"
"0","5","I cook a lot and these are the best sugar cookies I have ever made."
"0","5","These are as good as they are simple. I added some orange extract for flavor instead of vanilla just for a change. Awesome. Next time I will add some lemon extract. These came out soft after baking 10 minutes and cooling completely. I let one batch cook about 14 minutes and they were crisp. Adjust baking time to desired texture. Also, I didn't flatten them with a glass like some recipes call for and they flattened on their own and came out perfectly round. This would be a great holiday cookie maybe I will try them with a cookie cutter, too. Thanks for the keeper recipe!"
"0","4","I used this recipe last night, and the cookies turned out great! I didn't have to change anything. My family loves them, Thanks!"

"0","5","SUPER DUPER"
"0","4","Thse sugar cookies have a good buttery flavor. I rolled them all into balls and then flattened half of them with the bottom of the glass for larger, thinner cookies and left the others for smaller, thicker cookies. Both are good- the flat ones I frosted. I used baking stones and did not have to adjust the time very much."
"0","5","Great recipe and so easy."
"0","5","Wow!!!These are the easiest cookies I have ever made. And they are soooooo good!"
"0","5","These turned out beautifully for me! The taste was just what I was looking for!"
"0","5","These were soooo good! Everyone thought I bought them! They turned out beautifully, all nice and cracked and sparkly because I rolled them in sugar before i baked them.  Fantastic!"
"0","5","These are so easy and have a good flavor! My three yr old helped make these and loved them. We rolled them in colored sugar, like mentioned. They came out perfect! Soft in the middle and crispy on the outside!"
"0","5","This is the only time I've made a cookie this simple and likes it."
"0","4","Great recipe!! Reviewed many of the sugar cookie recipes on this site--looking for an easy no-roll version and choose this one as most seemed to have success with it! I upped the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp and changed sugar to 1c white 1/2c confectioners as some had suggested. Made these with my 4 yr old so had to roll in colored sugar or sprinkes or cinnamon & sugar-- looked great-- tasted terrific-- would keep baking time to 8 min to keep soft. Excellent-- quick to make as cookies don't spread too much so you can fit many on a single pan-- will make again soon!"
"0","5","VERY EASY AND SO YUMMY. I also bought the store icing in the little canisters, and divided it into different bowls and added food coloring. My kids had so much fun decorating these. My 2 year old couldn't get enough of these cookies."
"0","5","Love it. I have made this recipe about 6 or so times, and everyone loves it. I put frosting and sprinkles on the cookies once they have cooled and the taste is amazing!"
"0","5","PERFECT!! Taste just like a sugar cookie should! It was so easy too. I dont think the people who scored this low followed it to the tee. This one is a keeper."
"0","5","cookies are soft, but not greasy! i used a slight modification: equal parts of butter and vegetable oil (1 cup total), and 3/4 cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar."
"0","5","Oh! So crisp, yet chewy...and picture-perfect too! Absolutely THE BEST sugar cookie on this planet. Way to go Stephanie!"
"0","5","These cookies were great! They were soft on the inside and crispy outside. they had a wonderful flavor too! Not at all bland like some cookies. My husband loved them and he is pretty picky. I will def. make these again. :)"
"0","3","easy to make ,kids rated this ,not the best sugar cookies that i have tasted."
"0","5","Very good and my family loved them."
"0","5","Very great sugar cookie recipe. We live in the mountains above 6000 ft. Had to change it to 2c sugar, used 2 tsp vanilla. I rolled into balls and flattened with my hand, they still spread just enough for wonderful rounded edges, great taste and texture."
"0","5","Super recipe! So easy to make with a traditonal sugar cookie flavor. Made exactly to recipe, baked 9 minutes, let completely cool & they were perfect - firm bottom, slightly chewy center. Only problem we have is deciding which batch is better - the one I frosted or the one I rolled in colored sprinkles."
"0","5","These cookies are so yummy!! They were quick and easy to make. I added sprinkles to the batch for a little color variety and it gave it a sweeter taste. My kids gobbled them up! (and so did I). Thanks for sharing it!"
