"1079","5","I couldn't ask for any better! I used a 9x13 pan and baked it for 40 minutes. I just made this for the 2nd time and this time I upped the cocoa to 1 cup... I'm REALLY glad I did! The cake is great with the amount called for, but after trying more to see the difference, I definitely think 1 cup is the magic amount. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. I used the 'Buttercream Icing' recipe (pictured) from Sharon on this website. Incredible together!"
"760","5","My original review was 4 stars because I tried the cake only a few hours after baking. The cake alone was OK but had a strong baking soda taste. I used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and with this the cake was good. However, after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good! As good as any store bought or boxed mix. Bottom line: Make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight. I see no need to buy another boxed mix again. Thanks for a great recipe. Oh, and yes, after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out perfect :D"
"529","5","This cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake. Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks. UPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing."
"233","4","With just slight variations, this recipe is much like 'Black Magic Cake,' which I found I prefer. It is not quite as dense or as fudgy as this one. This is a deep, dark chocolate cake, but it was almost TOO moist,TOO dense. Don't know what really accounts for the difference since the recipes are so similar, and maybe it's just a matter of personal preference, but while this was a very good cake, I'll stick with the other."
"220","5","I have joyfully been trying many different cake/frosting recipes from this site and I must say this is about the most moist and delicious I have found! I used this to make cupcakes and what a perfect batter for the task! It's so 'runny' you just pour it into the liners. Halve the recipe and you get 12 cupcakes. Fill the liners 3/4 way full. They come out fluffy and very moist- PERFECT! I used the 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' from this site and it too was superb. (I wrote a review on it as well.)"
"178","5","One of the best cake recipes your ever going to find. Been cooking cakes for over ten years this recipe is easy, moist,texture and elasticity is perfect for chocolate cake. The type of cocoa is crucial. I've cooked it twice, first time used a dark cocoa it was good but the dark chocolate enhanced the salt so it tasted a tad salty. So next time if using a dark cocoa will omit the salt. Second time, used good quality standard cocoa and came out great. Also used a diluted espresso instead of plain water. Also glad the writer noted the runniness of the mix abit worrying at first. Excellent recipe."
"160","5","This is the exact recipe that is on the back of the Hershey Cocoa can. I have been using this same recipe for years! So much better than a box mix!"
"124","5","My grandma must've found this recipe a couple years ago, because that's when she gave it to my family. We love it! However, this recipe doesn't have absolutely PREFECT chocolate frosting that came with the one my grandma gave us, so I thought I'd help out a bit: Â½ C Butter/  2/3 C Cocoa/  1 Tsp. Vanilla/  3 C Powdered Sugar/  1/3 C Milk -  Melt butter, stir in cocoa. Alternately add sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. If necessary, thin with additional milk. Add vanilla. - There we go! I use this frosting recipe every time, and it's perfect for this cake. Hope I helped!!!"
"111","5","Absolutely delicious and so EASY to make! We made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves. Perfect with some whipped topping, we added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey! If you do this, make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter AFTER you have poured it into the baking pan, let them just sit on the top. Since the batter is thin, mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out."
"102","4","This recipe is awesome but remember it will only come out as great as the ingredients you use. I used Hershey's cocoa powder because that's what I had on hand but I would recommend using the highest quality cocoa you can afford! The batter IS really thin, I am SO glad that the recipe included that warning because I woulld have thought I did something wrong. Don't worry!"
"85","4","this recipe is very good. but i used the batter to make cupcakes and they were delicious! i was surprised at how moist they were. everybody loved them. i suggest that when you put in the cocoa powder, it's good to sift it then there are no lumps and the batter is smooth. also i did not put the full cup of water, i think it made the batter too thin. the next time i'm going to try it in the cake form."
"80","5","OH MY GOD! This is hands down the BEST, EASIEST and MOISTEST chocolate cake EVER! I was very skeptical about this recipe, after all I tried cake mixes before and they were heavenly but oh my was I impressed! As others suggested I used 1 cup of cocoa but other than that I did nbot change a thing. I checked the cake at about 25 mins and the toothpick came out clean so I took it out. So you should keep an eye on that, some ovens might not take that long to cook the cake. I greased the tin and cut out a circle of stickproof baking paper and the cake came out very easily. Even though it is so moist, you can still lift it and it won't break, of course you have to be careful with that. I iced and filled it with some ready made chocolate icing and it was divine! I also left it out all night and it taste just as moist and delicious as the day I made it. Thank you SO much for this recipe, it is definitely a keeper and will make it many many times! Btw, for the people who pointed out that this recipe is from the Hershey cocoa package, does it really matter? They don't sell that cocoa here and I would have never known about this recipe if the user did not post it here. Baking is about sharing good things and that was definitely done."
"50","5","I googled to find a chocolate cake recipe for a baking contest, and picked this one for it's simplicity due to my busy schedule. I won! I won with a perfect score!!  The greatest thing about this cake is how moist it is.... not just fresh-baked, but even a couple of days later. I am adding this recipe to my recipe box!  HINT: I use the shorter baking time with all recipes, subtract 5 minutes, and check the cake by touching with a finger to see if it springs back. What you want is for the cake to spring back but still sound 'wet' inside.... Turn off your oven, close the door and let the cake finish its last 5 minutes of bake time. This will allow the cake to set without drying out. Try it!"
"46","3","This is not a good cake to make a layer cake with. It is delicious, but it is more of a pudding cake, or a spoon type cake. It would NOT come out of the pans, even though the pans were well greased before hand. This cake came out in chunks...the kids had a great time eating the scraps, but we had to start over for my daughter's birthday cake."
"34","5","This was an extremely easy and low mess cake recipe. I needed something fast, that was homemade, for my son's birthday. I made this recipe into 24 cupcakes (instead of a cake) for a group of preschoolers. I frosted it with chocolate frosting and they tasted delicious. The cake was moist and yummy. I would make it again."
"32","5","This cake is absolutely fabulous! A treat for all chocolate lovers! And oh soooo easy! This recipe is very forgiving, it is quite difficult to go wrong with this one if you keep a few tips in mind. First of all, make sure you use LARGE eggs, otherwise you will end up with brownies instead of a luscious cake. Do not cut back on the soda or the baking powder, as they are the key to the cake structure. I also upped the cocoa to one cup and the result was any chocolate lover's fantasy. The cake was very moist, almost creamy yet with the firmness of a cake. I topped it with toblerone ganache and it worked perfectly with the bittersweet taste of the cake. Make sure you line the pan with parchment. The cake is so fudgy that IT WILL stick to the pan."
"31","5","I found this recipe a little under a year ago, and I can't count how many times I've made it. I will never, I repeat, NEVER make another chocolate cake again! I get asked for the recipe constantly, and friends and family beg me to make it. Tip: I make mine with 100% whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference AT ALL! If you're looking for the best, most moist and flavorful chocolate cake you've ever had, YOU FOUND IT!"
"22","4","The taste of this cake is 5 stars, but the texture is a 3, so I averaged them out, making the overall rating 4 stars. I may have done something wrong, but I did follow the directions exactly and my cake stuck to the pan (even though I did grease and flour it). Also, the cake was very crumbly and almost too moist, and almost overflowed out of my 2 9 in. pans. Next time i may try reducing the amount of water, or add none at all, because the taste was absolutely devine! I will definitly make this again with minor changes. Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE: I made this recipe again as cupcakes and they are sooo good! They are very rich and extremely moist. They are light and wonderfull! IMPORTANT:Just be sure if you make cupcakes you only fill the tins HALF FULL or else they will overflow (like mine did the first batch). I baked them for 25 minutes per batch and I was able to yield 30 cupcakes from this recipe. Also, they are divine with peanut butter frosting form this sight :)"
"18","1","way too much for 2 9 inch pans spilled all over my oven ended up throwing the cake away and baking something else!!!!"
"16","4","This is an easy and tasty cake. I always make it in a 9 x 13 pan but it still bakes for about 35 minutes. Interestingly, the last time I made it, I forgot to add the oil. All of it. And my family still loved it. So there's a good very low-fat option, too!"
"16","5","Absolutely fantastic! I tried this recipe out for my cousin's birthday and it was devoured!!  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out GREAT! As stated by another reviewer, don't be afraid to use the amount of oil and boiling (not hot!) water needed-it makes all the difference.  Oh, and be sure to wait those 10min (or more!) before removing from the pan... it makes removal MUCH easier.  This is a definite keeper. =)"
"15","5","Made this one exactly by the book as far as ingredients go. However, I used a 9x13 instead of two circulars as I don't have those, so I upped the bake time to ~38 mins. It seems very runny when you first pour it into the pan, which can be disconcerting. Don't worry about that though' it turns out fine. Very moist and delicious. I paired it with 'Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting' from this site."
"12","5","I have made this cake for 30 years or more. I use a cup of black coffee instead of boiling water. Great recipe! Great grandma, grandma, mom and me!"
"11","4","This was such a moist dense brownie like cake- it was delicious! - I made a vanilla buttercream icing that went amazing with it- I only gave it 4 stars because it dipped in the middle- not great when you are making a layer cake- I did some reading on why cakes dip and one reason is too much baking powder- soda- which this recipe has a ton of-"
"10","5","this is the BEST chocolate cake i have EVER had. i managed to mess it up by using a bad springform pan and it was the ugliest cake you will ever see, but the best taste. i made it with chocolate ganache made with milkas triolade, a mix of milk, semibitter and white chocolate. it is the best cake i have eaten and my family agreed. next time i will make it with a good pan, be sure to grease it well if you have old pans like me.. (im buying new ones) great recipe! thanks to the person who submitted it.. i literally made the batter in 15 minutes (inluding measuring) i used 1 cup of cocoa but i think sticking to the recipe would work fine. dont stop trying this if you only have 3/4 cup cocoa"
"10","5","Great recipe!"
"10","4","I used Gihaderlli (?) cocoa and I believe that intensified the flavor of the cake. The cake was very moist and rich...and a tad bit too sweet even though I lowered the sugar from 2 cups to 1 3/4. Next time I will use 1 1/2. Overall it was a good easy cake, its one of those fun cakes. I was a little concerned when I stirred in the boiling water because the batter smelled...burnt? but the cake tasted fine."
"9","4","I am not a big fan of chocolate but decided to try this anyway for the chocolate lovers in my home...I think I ended up eating at least a 1/3 of this cake all by myself...lol. It was easy and good."
"9","5","this was wonderful and super easy. i was worried about the batter being so runny.. but it turned out great. made it with the fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site and added mini chocolate chips for decoration around the side. beautiful and tasty!"
"8","5","AWESOME! I followed the exact recipe for one of a three layer cake for my boyfriend's graduation party. It was extremely easy and way better than any box mix. The scraps got eaten before I iced it :D."
"8","5","I made this in a bundt pan, glazed it with the 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' from this site and sifted powdered sugar over the top of it. Gorgeous cake and it tasted pretty darn good too. Like some of the other reviews recommended, I replaced the water with strong coffee...made the flavor really pop!"
"7","5","This was perfect!!! I did as others suggested and increased the cocoa powder to 1 cup. I baked this in a 9x13 baking pan for 40 minutes. This cake is delicious in every way...moist, rich, dense, but not too much of each! The perfect balance of all! I topped mine with a peanut butter chocolate ganache...heavenly!!!"
"7","5","This cake was delicious, and not really any more work than a cake mix. I followed the recipe as written, it yielded two 8-inch cakes...I will save this to use as my go-to chocolate cake recipe, thanks!"
"7","5","'Now THIS is chocolate cake!' That's what my dad said as he ate this cake. I completely agree. I made this for my niece's birthday and it came out fantastic. The thing I love about it is that it's almost as easy as a box mix, but tastes even better. Plus, it's made with ingredients I usually have in my pantry. It's dark and moist and goes perfectly with 'Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting' on this site. My hubby requested I make another cake just for us, so I relented, but only made 1/2 cake. It's one of the best chocolate cakes from scratch I've ever made!"
"7","5","Always use the best chocolate!"
"7","4","Good cake, moist and easy to make."
"7","5","OMG... my daughter needed cupcakes last minute for school. I had no boxed mix and it was to late to go to the store, so I came on here. I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to give this a try. This has to be the moistest cake I have ever had, almost to moist to remove from the cup cake papers, but well worth it. I won't be going back to box cake mixes again! Thank you for the recipe!"
"7","5","So easy to make and perfectly moist and delicious. I used a standard Bundt tube pan (baked for 35 minutes) and frosted it with a dark chocolate ganache. Excellent!"
"7","5","This Cake is Amazing!! Family requested chocolate cake and i couldnt find my original recipe so i tried this one, i wont be looking for the other. The cake is soft, Light and extremely tasty. My Dad doesnt like chocolate cake, but this one he had thirds i would deffinately say try it. I was worried that the batter was too thin but i tried it and it works. They rise beautifully and dont sink in the middle. i put chocolate fudge frosting in the middle i was very pleased with this recipe well done and thankyou for sharing Shirly."
"6","5","I'm the worst baker in the world. This recipe has made me feel otherwise. Absolutely amazing;)  Thank you for sharing."
"6","5","Wow, this was so good, I am having it with coffee for my breakfast this morning (shame on me). I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder, just under a cup. I frosted with the butter cream frosting from the Red Velvet Cake I recipe on this site. Took the advice of another rater and bought an oven thermometer - made a huge difference, as my oven temp was 10 degrees high, allowing me to adjust to the correct temp. I removed it at 28 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe and comments for a great cake!"
"6","5","This was a super easy and delicious cake to make! A nice deep chocolate flavour. Why anyone would use a boxed cake mix after trying this recipe is beyond me!"
"6","5","this was delicious and sooo easy. Just dont make the mistake I did and add the boiling water while the mixer is spinning! ouch! hah"
"6","5","This cake came out really good. I did change it up a bit to make it healthier. Instead of oil I used applesauce and instead eggs I used egg substitute. I also used one cup of cocoa powder and added a cup of brewed coffee. The result was a delicious and somewhat healthy chocolate cake."
"5","5","I've used this recipe many times before. I replace the water with a cup of coffee and I think it makes it so much better. I've also substituted the milk with soy milk on a few occasions and it turns out just fine. I always use this cake recipe as a layer cake and never have any problems getting it out of the pan."
"5","5","Easy, easy! I keep the dry ingredients bagged in my freezer and use this recipe as my go-to cake mix. Turns out perfect EVERYTIME! I read the negative reviews and from what I read, the results were bad because of a recipe modification or overfilling the pans. Yes - this cake rises, even though the batter seems really runny. Definitely worth a try!"
"5","5","I cut this recipe in half, made 18 cupcakes and baked for 15 minutes. It was fast, easy and delicious."
"5","4","Turned out good. Could use a little more chocolate flavor to it. Would increase the cocoa to 1 cup next time"
"5","5","This is my go-to recipe for chocolate cake! It's super easy to make and the cake always comes out delicious and moist. I followed others' reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa powder. I've tried the recipe with water + 1tsp coffee and also with just water...either way the cake is great! I wouldn't recommend this recipe to use for cake pops...it's too moist, it won't hold the ball shape at all."
"5","5","I love the one bowl method and it is delicious."
"5","1","So DISSAPOINTED! I actually had to make this recipe 2 times. My son and I were making a birthday cake for me together. I made it once and it ran all over my oven. After hiding this finished product from my son so he was not upset that the cake was ruined I tried again. I followed the recipe exactly and it almost ran all over the oven this time it stuck to the pan and was not cooked in the middle even after 40 minutes. I am now sitting here smelling the burnt cake self clean off the oven and is soooo not happy!"
"5","5","Very moist chocolaty cake"
"5","5","Very good, very quick, very easy. Thanks!"
"5","5","This was easy to make it turned out great.. I used a cream cheese icing recipe from this site to spread over it and my family loved it."
"5","5","This is why I love this site. Here is an EASY recipe to follow. The user comments were right on. Per their advice I used the following...  1 cup of cocoa powder (Still Hershey's since that is what I had) 1/2 tbsp instant coffee to the boiling water before mixing.  The cake is moist, delicious, and a little dense compared to regular sheet cake."
"5","5","I'm not normally a big chocolate cake eater but this super simple and delicious recipe has changed that! As per other reviewers I made the following tweaks to the recipe. 1) Increased the cocoa to 1 cup 2) Used 1 cup of coffee to bring out the cocoa flavor 3) Used room temperature ingredients. It took 40 mins in a 9x13 pan. I always get rave reviews when I bring this to potlucks and am asked constantly if I actually baked it myself! Important note - find the willpower to not eat this immediately! Leave the cake OVERNIGHT in the fridge! It's worth the wait! Makes a huge difference to the taste! Moist, full of chocolate flavor, almost fudge-like (which I prefer!). Nice!"
"5","5","I upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup as suggested by other reviewers and that's the only change I made--delicious! Yum, yum, yum! This was perfect! Not too sweet, moist, and super easy! I will definitely make this over and over again. Thank you!"
"5","5","Absolutely scrumptious. I am glad I read others' advice before making, otherwise would have worried about how runny it is at first. When it was baking, it really puffed up over the pan which was worrisome too, but settled down nicely as soon as it was removed. I iced this with 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' and it was a huge hit. Would definitely make again."
"5","5","This was my first cake from scratch. Very simple, had all ingredients on hand. Took the advice of other reviewers and THOROUGHLY greased the pan. Also used 9X13 pan instead of two 9 inch rounds and cooked for 40 mins. Came out perfect and moist and yummy. Oh yeah, and I also used hot coffee instead of hot water."
"5","5","Absolutely wonderful cake! My entire family enjoys it. The only change I make is to sometimes substitute the water for coffee. Thanks for sharing!"
"5","5","Amazing! I NEVER make cakes from scratch but decided to be really crazy and try one out for my daughters b-day, I was nervous about this cake but it was sooo good! Easy, moist, and really delicious. I will be making this again and again, thanks for the recipe even if it is the one from the Hershey's box, I would have never seen it there!"
"5","5","I was so afraid of making cake from scratch, I've tried before and it ended up with the cake in the trash. I paired it with 'fluffy peanut butter frosting' from this site, and my husband immediately turned to me and said i better get started on the next one b/c this one would be gone in no time! It wasn't overly chocolatey, and paired with the pb frosting it was perfect! Oh! and soooo easy!"
"5","5","this was sooooo moist and delicious!!! i used 1 1/2 cups spelt flour instead of the 1 3/4 cups of all purpose flour. i also used applesauce instead of oil and just 1 cup of sugar. i find that if you are going to be using a sweet icing/frosting/glaze on top, then you really don't need to add so much sugar to the cake it self. yum!!"
"5","5","I can't really comment fully on this cake because I'm still in shock! HOW MOIST IT WAS, and easy wasn't the word! All I can say is if you doubt, try it out for yourself and you will doubt no more!!! Call me doubting Thomas! I was really in doubt when I saw how soupy the batter was (even though I read the warnings). Like I said, I'm still in shock! Great cake! A definine 'must make again'! No more boxed for me, ever!"
"5","5","I was very surprised at how nicely this cake turned out. It was so easy, wonderfully moist, and delicious. It just proves that the most simple recipes are often the best."
"4","5","I have made this cake in a 9X13 pan. Delicious...only chocolate cake I make. The recipe is on the back of the Hersey's Cocoa Powder can!!!!"
"4","5","Loved it!Followed the suggestion of increasing cocoa to 1 cup. Makes 2 cakes, so ai made it into a double layered choc cake with choc butter cream frosting. YUMMY!!! :)"
"4","5","Fantastic Huge chocolate cake,moist,tasty,i will not ever buy a chocolate cake again,my kids adored this,thank you so much shirleyo."
"4","5","I have to give this recipe 5 stars. I accidentally didn't make it as written, but it still turned out great, though not as much like a cake. I accidentally left out the cup of milk, so the end result was more like brownies. It tasted great, just a lot more dense. My daughter wanted a 'dirt cake' for her birthday, so I topped it with Cool-whip with chocolate pudding mix stirred into it, then crumbled Oreo cookies all over the top. Everyone at the party loved it and there was none left. Great recipe, even with my mistake!"
"4","3","This works pretty well and comes out easily. I did the brewed coffee thing the second time I made it and the flavour was better. Still not amazing but very simple for beginners."
"4","5","I used coffee in place of the hot water and cut the sugar by 1/4-1/2. I frosted it with Rich Chocolate Icing. It's quick, easy and everyone I've made it for loves it!"
"4","5","Amazing. I hate when i make things that have instant mixes and turn out pretty much the same as instant, BUT this however is totally worth making homemade instead of instant. I will use this for all my chocolate cakes and won't need instant chocolate mix again. I love how dense this cake is. I made cupcakes because its for a finger food event and i needed it to be easy for people to eat. I am looking for a icing recipe now and i soo do not want to mess up these cupcakes. And yea the recipe is on the back of hersheys cocoa but i wouldnt have noticed the recipe til i found this one. Thanks."
"4","5","I was really afraid this was not going to turn out when I saw how runny the batter was. But it turned out great!"
"4","5","Excellent. I was a bit concerned we wouldn't like it as much as my usual go-to chocolate cake (I didn't have all the ingredients called for in that one, or I would have made it) but it was really good, thoroughly enjoyed by all! I made the layers and froze them for two days, then frosted and left in the fridge another day and it was very moist when it came time to eat it. Just the right amount of density too. I frosted with Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting from this site and filled it with Cinnamon Coffee Frosting also from this site. I used 8 inch pans and it worked wonderfully (I actually found the layers to be a bit thin, despite my using smaller pans). Edit: I've made this a bunch more times now, and paired with peanut butter frosting, it is amazing. A.MA.ZING. I made cookies n cream frosting with it too once and that was good as well."
"4","5","Wow! Dont change a thing. If you are looking for a moist,perfectly dense chocolate cake,this is truely perfect. It couldnt be easier with everything in one bowl. I was a tiny bit sceptical because the batter was very thin, but it actually did come out better than any other chocolate recipe Ive tried. Thanks for an easy, wonderful cake recipe."
"4","5","Very good! Especially the next day. I used a whole cup of cocoa powder per other reviewers suggestions, and I'm very happy with the results. Yum. Update!! I halved the recipe (used 1/2 c cocoa powder) and made 12 cupcakes with it, then frosted and filled them with Fluffy White Frosting from AR. Run to your kitchen and make these - they will not disappoint!! I baked at 350 for 16 min and they were so moist and yummy. We ate them in literally two hours. Almost like homemade Hostess Cupcakes but totally better!"
"4","4","I made this cake for my daughter's birthday. Everyone loved it but it was too moist for me. I found that it taste even better and less moist after refrigerating overnight. I also used 1 cup of coca powder and all butter. I used Buttercream icing by Sharon."
"4","4","I actually got this recipe off of the hershey's unsweetened cocoa container and make it any time I need to make a chocolate cake. Its moist, rich, and very chocolatey. I've made it as a layer cake and cupcakes and have frozen them with good results."
"4","3","Ok i have to give this three stars even though i completly messed it up. I forgot it needed veggie oil so it had to sit in the fridge. After that i saw that i put a little to much of it in :( so it ended up better than i thought it would. Also one more thing i made it into a sheet pan. I paired it with a nice cream cheese frosting. I think i might have to make this again an re-review it. If you are thinking of making this dont be dicouraged by this review!"
"4","1","WARNING> do not use this recipe for cupcakes! H.O.L.Y C.O.W. what a disaster! in 25+ years of baking i've never made such a mess! i followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 1 cup of hot coffee rather than hot water. my mistake? because i was wanting big fluffy tops on my cupcakes i followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and filled my liners 3/4 of the way full. BAD IDEA! bad, bad, BAD! everything ended up overflowing and i had to throw the entire batch (12 cupcakes) out! and i'll have lots of pan (& oven scrubbing!) to do. next, i tried to fill them 1/2 full (as i usually do with other recipes) and i just checked and even those are overflowing! what the heck?!? if i ever make this recipe again i will NOT make it for cupcakes. i have to admit that the taste (of what i could scrape off of my cupcake pan) was very good though. too bad it didn't work out for me. :("
"4","5","Perfection!"
"4","4","Great recipe. I used it to make cupcakes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was my batter bubbled up a little over my pans in the oven. I was able to cut off the extra when they were done though, so, no problems. Great texture and flavor. Perfect for decorating. I did use 1 whole cup cocoa as other reviewers suggested, and I used half dark/half regular. I will make again whenever I make chocolate cake. It was very easy. Thanks for the recipe shirleyo!"
"4","5","I absolutely love this recipe. Sometimes I sub the boiling water for hot coffee and use a bit more cocoa powder. I have changed this recipe to serve 72 using the calculating tool and it works just as well. Always and I mean always a crowd pleaser."
"4","5","Fab! I made this with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting...total hit! So moist and yummy."
"4","5","A truly scrumptious cake. I made this for a fete at church. I took the advise of other reviewers and added 1 cup cocoa powder as against the recommended 3/4 cup. Also, instead of adding the ingredients in the order mentioned in the recipe, I beat the oil, and sugar till fluffy, then added the eggs and beat well. I sifted all the dry ingredients and added that alternatively with the milk. After the flour and milk was added I added the extract. And finally as was mentioned in the recipe I added the boiling water. I baked this in two 9x9 square pans for 30 mins. Once they had cooled down completely, I used nutella to spread between the layers and around the cake! Thank you Shirleyo for the recipe, 400luv for recommending it to me, and KSAZA for the nutella idea!! :)"
"4","3","Very easy basic chocolate cake recipe. I did have a little trouble getting this out of the pan, also the cooking time was a little out. I had to cook for an additional 20 minutes, as it will still uncooked in the middle. I finished it off with Chocolate Ganache (This was excellent). Not a bad cake, but the taste was not quite there for me. To be honest, I don't think I will be using the recipe again."
"4","5","This is the best chocolate cake!! The only thing I change is to use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa instead of regular cocoa. I always frost the cake with 'chocolate frosting 1 by Tianne' from this site and everyone loves it!"
"4","5","The cake is awesome. It's easier than making a box cake and it turns out rich, moist, and delicious every time. I bake mine in two medium spingform pans for about 45 minutes. You can substitute strong, HOT coffee for the boiling water for a richer flavor. I've also made cupcakes in two 12-cupcake pans and bake them for 25 minutes. Next time I'm going to try and add 1 cup cocoa. :)"
"4","5","This was my first made-from-scratch cake and my first layer cake. For a first attempt, it turned out really well. I took other's advice and upped the cocoa to 1 cup."
"4","5","Update! I have made this about a million times and it is always so good and so moist and absolutely perfect. Tonight I made cupcakes from this recipe and they are AWESOME! 1/4C batter per cupcake - I will never use another recipe. Thank you!! /SO good! I can't believe how easy this was - and so so good! Too make it even easier and even better, when I pulled it out of the oven I sprinkled a bag of chocolate chips over the top and then smoothed them once they had melted. Then I sprinkled chopped pecans on top. Way easier than making frosting, and a big hit at our work potluck. Thanks!"
"4","4","I gave this recipe 4 stars only because it stuck to my pan so bad we just frosted it in the 2 round pans and ate it out of the pan. I also greased and floured the pans like I do every time I make a layer cake and I've never had a cake stick so bad, homemade or boxed. Taste wise, it was really good!The texture was great! It was really pretty too. Too bad it stuck so horribly =("
"4","5","This is the Hershey's recipe on the back of a can. Same recipe.  Very yummy."
"4","4","very good. we put it in the fridge overnight, and it was very dense the next night. almost brownie-like. :)"
"4","4","A very nice cake, I have to say. Super easy, satisfying taste. Nothing too gourmet or difficult, and it turned out perfectly (which doesn't always happen for me!). As per other reviewers, I reduced the amount of boiling water added by a hair (maybe from one cup to 4/5 of a cup). Oh yes, and I cooked it for way longer than called for, but that could just be my oven. I just waited and waited 'til a toothpick came out clean, and when I finally took it out, it was perfect."
"4","4","Good. I hate to say that I still like the butter devil's food cake mix better!"
"4","5","This was the easiest cake I have ever made! Even easier than a boxed cake!!! With recipes out there like this, NOBODY should ever make a boxed cake again. I only wanted to make a small cake, so I cut the recipe in half with no problems. The batter was made and in the oven within 10 minutes. I used 'Chocolate Frosting I' also from this website and that was easy too. A+ recipe!"
"4","4","This is very yummy and very moist! Stayed moist for days. I rated it 4 stars though because it took a lot longer to cook than noted and didn't hold up well to being frosted - wayto delicate & crumby. I made cupcakes and I had a hard time taking them out of the pan without squishing them. If all you care about is taste and just want to serve this to your family - this is an excellent recipe but use good cocoa. I don't recommend if you want to have a 'professional finish' product."
"4","5","This cake is AMAZING! It is so easy and turned out just as moist, if not even more moist than a boxed cake, and tasted a lot better! I've been searching for a moist, chocolatey cake and this one is it! I highly recommend it! Paired it with chocolate cream cheese frosting and also with fluffy white frosting drizzled with chocolate glaze. Thank you for the AWESOME recipe!"
"4","4","This recipe was easy to follow and quick to prepare. My cake rose perfectly; I baked it in a 9x13 pan, for about 40 minutes, and it could maybe have used a bit more. The end result was light and airy- if you are looking for a heavy, dense cake, this is not it! What you would expect chocolate cake to be - not overly chocolate-y, and it is not an amazing, unique taste, but it is very moist, and great topped with a nice fudge icing or even alone(I like plain cake for some reason!) Be sure to have with a glass of milk! :)"
"3","5","This is the same recipe that is on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa tin. I love this recipe! I do use a cup of HOT, STRONG coffee instead of boiling water though, it really enhances the chocolate. So delicious and moist!"
"3","5","I made cupcakes with this recipe and they were fantastic! I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and they turned out perfectly. Best chocolate cupcakes I've ever made!"
"3","5","Wonderful as a cake or cupcakes! If making cupcakes, reduce the baking time to 20 minutes (took me a batch or two to figure that out!) Fill the cupcake tins to not quite 3/4 full or they will overflow onto the pan and make it difficult to remove. Frosted with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe, sprinkled with a little decorative sugar, placed in individual cupcake boxes and now had a wonderful little holiday gift for family and friends!"
"3","5","but SOOOO much better if you use strong coffee instead of water!!! I usually make it in a 9X13' pan. Freezes perfectly too!"
"3","4","I've been using this forever as my go-to chocolate cake, with a couple tweaks. I am very into cake decorating and I found that this cake just didn't stack well or have a sturdy enough texture as is. I add one pack of Jello instant chocolate pudding, and another egg. After this the texture and flavor is wonderful. Next time I'll try adding some more cocoa as others have suggested, and the instant espresso is a great add if the cake is for adults.  An update, lately (instead of adding the jello pudding above) I still add the extra egg (total 3 eggs), but I also up the flour to 2 1/4c, increase baking powder to 1 3/4 tsp, and use 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c buttermilk instead of all milk. This seemed to get rid of the center of the cake sinking problem that I was having before."
"3","5","I was looking for a simple chocolate cake recipe for a spur of the moment dessert for the fam. The cake was moist and very chocolaty. My 5 year old, a huge chocolate fan, loved it. It is very dense, so if you prefer a lighter cake, this might not be your recipe. I baked it in 2 round pans and frosted/filled it with chocolate whipped cream(heavy whipping cream, cocoa powder, and confectioners sugar). It turned out great, and was just what I was looking for."
"3","5","I subsited for almond milk, coconut oil, hot coffee instead of boiling water. mmmmm good oh boy this is good. This was soupy, but I followed measured amounts and came out great. You can tell when it's done when the kids come out of room asking what that smell is :). foolproof."
"3","5","This cake is one of the best. It was delicious and moist. I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfectly. I lined my pans with wax paper to avoid the pans sticking."
"3","1","This is the exact recipe that is on the back of Hershy's Cocoa. So no wonder it's good. I realized this when I got the cocoa out of the cabinet and started making this recipe, then looked at the back of the cocoa. It's written exactly."
"3","5","This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. Way better than a mix. It doesn't have that artificially light texture cake mixes tend to have. I use 1 cup of hot coffee instead of the water."
"3","5","Amazing!!"
"3","5","This was very good! I got nervous after I took it out of the oven it did fall a bit. I cooled it off, frosted it and put it in the fridge overnight. It was heaven! Will definitely make again...."
"3","5","This cake is perfect! I used chocolate milk instead of plain milk and strong coffee instead of boiling water and the result was better than I had hoped for. I did not have a problem with the cake sticking to the pan. I greased the pans and sprinkled cocoa on the bottom. I will make again and again!"
"3","5","This was an amazing cake! Even my picky daughter has been eating it, and she NEVER eats cake.  After reading a couple of the reviews, I increased the cocoa powder to 1c, and I used butter instead of oil (since I can taste oil in cake)."
"3","5","This cake was great. I followed the other reviewers advice of upping cocoa to 1 cup, lining cake pan with parchment after butter/flouring sides, turning off oven five minutes before time was up and refrigerating overnight once cooled. Cake did not stick to the pan, was perfectly moist even after staying unfrosted for 24 hours, and had a good texture and taste. I filled with seedless raspberry preserves, covered with semi-sweet ganache and decorated with chocolate whipped cream."
"3","5","Okay, I was initially going to review this with 4 stars, but trust the reviews that say it's better the next day! It is easy to make and it tasted alright when I first made it. I iced and decorated for my daughter's school party the following day and when I got there to serve the cake, it tasted out of this world! I can't comprehend how it did that, but it really did! It's very moist and even sticky (clean up isn't too much fun, make sure to use parchment paper!) Yum! Thanks!"
"3","1","This cake was SO sweet my family couldn't even swallow it. I think the 2 cups of sugar needs to be 2 tbsp. It looked like caramelized sugar."
"3","5","Delicious! But for those of you making cupcakes, only fill about 1/2 way. These have a good amount of rise to them!"
"3","5","Made this for my hubbys birthday! This cake is delicious! Very moist! My hubby has requested that I not go back to cake mixes...now I just need a yellow cake to impress him with! I made this as a 9x13 baked 40 minutes. It came out beautiful and not flat like most cakes are nowadays!"
"3","5","This has become my 'go-to' chocolate cake recipe! So dense and chocolate-y!"
"3","4","I made this recipe into cupcakes- they came out really good! The only negative thing is that they were a little chewy. Also, they overflowed, and that was after I halfed the recipe and made 15 cupcakes. Maybe it is just my new oven. Overall, I would say that it is really good and extremely easy!"
"3","5","Made in a bundt pan (43 min at 350) and I could not have asked for better! Dense, moist and wonderfully chocolatey! Tasted even better the next day! Love this recipe!"
"3","5","Beautiful cake! I only reduced the sugar by half, the rest, i followed the recipe exactly. It was moist, chocolatey and DELICIOUS!! My go to chocolate cake recipe from now on!! Thank you!!"
"3","5","Delicious! Like another reviewer, I halved the recipe and it made 12 cupcakes. The batter was really liquidy, so I used a liquid measuring cup to pour it into the cupcake liners.  I frosted them with my Grandma's cocoa frosting. Homemade frosting is much more important than homemade cake!  **Melt together 5 tbsp butter or margarine with 5 tbsp cocoa add 1 lb powdered sugar and a little milk to mix. ** I used a hand mixer to smooth out the frosting, and piped them on to the cupcakes.  I love that the recipe can be made with 'staple' ingredients. This one is going in the family recipe book.  They were awesome, and I am my kids' hero :)"
"3","5","This cake is fantastic, however I see it on here a lot as just a chocolate cake recipe, but it is actually a trademarked Hershey recipe that is on the back of every hershey's cocoa container. Either way, I've been making it as my standard chocolate cake for years and have never had a better cake."
"3","5","For a non-baker like myself, this was a GREAT recipe! I had *most* ingredients on hand (missing the cocoa), and it was so easy to follow the directions. I made this cake into cupcakes - cooked for 17 minutes (in semi-high altitude) and they turned out perfect! Even peeled away from the wrappers perfectly (can't say that happens with cake mixes).  Thank you for sharing this review - I became a baking superstar mom in my house!"
"3","5","Man oh man! This recipe saved my tail this weekend! I had mini cupcakes to make for a wedding, and 3 hours before I was supposed to deliver them, my original recipe failed...probably bad leaveners. In any case, I was out of most of my ingredients and didn't have time to run to the store. I frantically searched for a quick, EASY chocolate cake recipe that didn't require too many ingredients and came across this one. Tried it....LOVED IT! It was SO easy and SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO very tasty- this will be my standard from now on!"
"3","5","I made this today for my son's 8th birthday. We halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes. They are so yummy. We couldn't wait to let them cool and ate 1 already. Now daddy needs to hurry and get home so we can enjoy the rest."
"3","5","Wonderfully moist and full of flavor. I added one cup cocoa and a cup of coffee instead of water. It's fantastic. Thank you!!"
"3","1","Too sweet. Too soupy. I even used Hershey's Hot Fudge Topping like other people had recommended.  The consistency was good BEFORE I added the hot fudge. That was a mistake."
"3","1","I am a very good baker, but this cake didn't turn out at all. I was worried even though the recipe said that the batter will be thin, even though I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't know why it said to dust the pan with butter AND flour, but I did it anyway. When I took the cake out of the pan, the top of the cake had flour spots all over it, so I had to wipe it off because nobody wants chunks of flour on top of their cake. Also, the middle sunk in and the edges were tough because I had to bake it longer because the middle was undercooked. What a disaster! I will certainly not make this cake again."
"3","5","My 5yo wanted to make a cake so I chose this recipe based on it's fabulous reviews. It was surprisingly easy to make. In fact, my little girl made it with very little help from me.  When I added the cup of boiling water to the batter I was sure I screwed something up as I had never seen cake batter that thin. I reread the directions and went ahead and poured it into 2 8' cake pans and still had little left over so I poured the remaining batter in an additional 8' pan and it was about 1/2 full. The cake came out beautifully! Very moist! We frosted ours and added various sprinkles for decoration and served it immediately. (she couldn't wait) Delish!"
"3","5","This is a really good cake recipe. However, the first time I made it it stuck to the bottom of the pan and was a huge mess. (No idea why you would flour the bottom of the pans.) I started over using parchment paper to line the bottom of the pans. It worked out beautifully! The cake was very moist and not too sweet. I did up the chocolate to a cup but aside from those minor changes the recipe is wonderful!"
"3","5","What a fantastic recipe! This was easy to make and tasted light, but rich. Do not be afraid of the thin consistency of the final batter! I was very scared at how thin it was (almost like water), but after baking it, I was SUPER happy with the final texture and taste! Highly recommended ."
"3","5","This is the exact recipes on the back of the Hershey's cocoa package for their 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake...just saying"
"3","4","I substituted 'no sugar added' apple sauce for the oil, and it turned out great! I also added a bag of chocolate chips for extra chocolatey deliciousness (but don't forget to coat them in flour first, or they'll all sink to the bottom, especially since this batter is really thin)! YUM!"
"3","5","Delicious!!!! The best chocolate cake I have ever had! Thank you!"
"3","5","Soooooo very good. I used this to make mini cupcakes. One recipe made about 48. What a bite of heaven. Cook for about 9 and a half minutes for the minis."
"3","5","I think this is probably the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made and eaten!!!...I did up the cocoa to 1 cup per other reviewers suggestions. Also, ran out of regular cocoa so the frosting had 1/2 reg cocoa and 1/2 Hershey's special dark cocoa...AMAZING!!! This is exactly the same recipe on the Hershey Cocoa box"
"3","5","Wonderful cake. I made it in 9X13 pan and it took about 50 minutes to cook. For those of you worried about what type of cocoa powder to use - I used Hersheys and it turned out fine. In my mind that *is* a quality ingredient! Like others I used coffee instead of water - couldn't taste the coffee but the cake was amazing."
"3","5","This cake is delicious! I don't really even like cake but my fiance does so I made this one and it was amazing! I will definitely make this my go to chocolate cake recipe in the future."
"3","4","Hmmmmmm...I made these into cupcakes and they sorta looked like brownies:/ I wanted to fill them, but they were too flat to be filled. Still good, though!"
"3","5","A friend, who is also a reviewer on this site, pointed me in the direction of this recipe. It reminds me of one I had years ago, but the recipe was lost. It is easy to prepare, very moist, doesn't need icing and is a great 'unexpected company' recipe. I was glad to be reminded of the one bowl chocolate cake."
"3","5","Made this last night and everyone loved it. I ended up doing a half recipe (didn't realize I was short on sugar) but I did add more cocoa then half. It calls for 3/4 of a cup but I added a half cup of cocoa due to others saying it made a difference. It was so moist and had such a rich flavor. I also wanted to mention how EASY it is. It's really hard to mess this one up, and that's why I like it too."
"3","1","Made this for my dad's birthday, but no one really liked the texture or the taste. This cake does not have a fine crumb and IS dense, but mine came out a bit rubbery! I skipped the baking soda, and used sunflower oil instead of vegetable."
"3","5","Super easy and much better than a box cake!"
"3","5","So so easy and delicious. It's nice and moist. Don't get discouraged when you add the water, it does look weird but it will turn out ok. I used the Texas chocolate frosting with this and it was fantastic. Soooo decadent."
"3","3","The main problem for me was the texture and lack of substance to the cake. It's hard to explain, but it didn't taste like a homemade recipe. It was too light in texture, too crumbly, and light on flavor. Yes, it was very easy, and moist... but I was disappointed in the finished product. It had a slightly bitter taste, probably because of the Hershey's cocoa. I'll try a different recipe next time."
"3","5","Want to make this a healthier cake? This is the only chocolate cake that I bake and eat. I use only whole wheat flour with just under a 1/2 cup oil and I use olive, yes, olive oil. I use a a cup and a half sugar. I use a half teaspoon of salt, 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, and no sodium baking powder all which lower the sodium content. At times, I use no salt at all. You really don't need salt when using baking soda and powder. The whole family loves how moist it turns out and is healthy to boot. I use no frosting as it needs none but may try to frost it just for a change."
"3","5","a friend gave me this recipe about 12 yrs ago.it is the very best in chocolate cakes in my opinion.u can't do any thing wrong with it.i've made it when i was low on cocoa, another time with only 1 1/2cups sugar,and another time only had 1 egg.it turned out every time.this is a magical recipe.wouldn't try any other. u can't improve on perfection.if some of u haven't tried this i suggest u do, u won't be sorry. i us it to make chocolate trifle, zuccotto, layer it with buttercream, ganache it,or just have it plain, or w/yogurt.thanks shirleyo for sharing .now others can enjoy it as much as i do.5 stars +"
"3","4","This is a very good recipe. For a quick chocolate fix this is my go to recipe. I changed the servings to 6 and then baked 2 little cakes using my onion soup bowls (the ones with a handle) and they were awesome! I had to bake these for 27 minutes and they came out perfect."
"3","4","My husband liked this as it was extremely moist. I liked it, but thought it came out a little too soft, like it hadn't baked long enough. But I've made it twice, cooked it a bit longer and used a bundt and everyone seems to like it. It definitely is moister than any other receipe I've tried. Will keep this on my favorite list!"
"3","4","This is a very good, simple, and easy to make recipe. I upped the amount of cocoa to 1 cup as suggested by others and found that the cake does taste better after letting it sit for about one day. I frosted it with 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' and it was a nice treat. I did however have problems with the cake not coming out of the pan even after greasing it and flouring it - perhaps next time I will try a new method."
"3","3","The cake was good but when using Hershey's Cocoa i found the same recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa Box, so that's why i rate it 3 stars, wonder who copied who's! but it was a good tasting cake."
"3","5","If I could rate this any higher I would. This is one of the best chcolate cakes I've had and I am a pastry chef so that says a lot! My students all love this cake. It's so rich that none of my students could eat seconds. We frosted it with a simple fudge icing. The fudge icing is as follows: Sift twice 3 c powdered sugar with 2/3 cup dark cocoa powder. Then stir in 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, 1/3 cup milk, and 1 tsp vanilla."
"3","4","This is a great cake. Normally I can't bake to save my life, but I really wanted a chocolate cake. I had all the ingredients, and the only change I made was I used 1 cup of hot coffee rather than boiling water. It actually cooked in 25 minutes for me. Delicious and moist!"
"3","1","This cake didn't rise and it ran all over my oven. It was so moist that it stuck to the pans. The flavor was fantastic, but it's just not made for two round pans. Probably would be just fine in a bundt or 9x13 pan."
"3","5","For my husband's birthday, he requested a cake made from scratch. I used this cake mix to make a double layer 13x9 cake with chocolate icing in between the layers and a topping of chocolate ganche....DEATH BY CHOCOLATE. This mix produced a moist cake that has a rich, chocolatey taste without being overly sweet (even with the 2 cups of sugar) and was easy to manipulate into layers. It is also easy to mix all the dry ingredients into a ziploc bag to keep onhand for future reference. The only changes I made were using half all purpose flour and half cake flour. To make a 13x9 sheet cake, you will need to bake at 350 for approx 45 minutes. One note....do not be distressed by the thinness of the batter....it will bake up correctly. I recommend a tall glass of milk to go with this as the perfect compliment."
"3","5","SUPER DELICIOUS!! I used buttermilk in place of the milk. I ended up with 3- 8' layers. I used the 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' on here and it came out wonderfully. The cake was so moist and chocolately!! Can't wait to make this cake again soon!!   UPDATE 8/11/08- I made cupcakes with this recipe- I ended up with (24), I filled the muffin cups 2/3-3/4 full and they came out perfectly. I tried sprinkling choc chips on top just before baking, however, I don't think I'll do that again, I personally like the recipe better with that addition. I didn't use buttermilk this time, I definately noticed a difference, the buttermilk is a MUST and makes the cake much more moist!"
"3","5","I made this cake last week for my daughter's birthday party. I doubled it to make a double layer 13X9 cake and it turned out beautifully. The cake was VERY simple... I usually have the ingredients on hand... and it stayed moist and yummy for the three days it took for us to eat it all up. I also took leftovers to work, and my boss had seconds he liked it so much. The batter is very thin... don't let that scare you. It comes out just right. This was literally easier than a boxed mix, and soooo much tastier!"
"3","5","The best chocolate cake I have ever made! I added one ripe banana into the batter and the texture was perfectly moist. The slight banana flavor combined nicely with the rich chocolate."
"3","5","quick and easy and very moist. halve quantites for 7 inch tins.  **** USE HOT COFFEE instead of plain boiling water for extra taste.. FAB!"
"3","3","This recipe was only ok for me. I'm glad that people said the batter was thin, because I would have thought I really messed up! It was pretty good the first time, but I made this cake a second time and I actually found that it tasted pretty bland. It was't very sweet or chocolatey. Maybe next time I will add the coffee instead of water like other people had suggested."
"3","5","Wow - this is definately a cake that will become a part of my permanent collection! What a fantastic recipe! It is so easy to make. I must admit that I was skeptical when I stirred in the hot water and the batter was so runny. But despite my concerns, it rose perfectly and turned out wonderfully! Such a great texture, moist and chocolately. I used a yummy chocolate frosting and sprinkles on top. Took this to work for a colleagues birthday and I had the whole marketing department around my desk eating chocolate and commmenting that it was one of the best they'd ever had! One person mentioned it that it was 'just like grandma used to make'. VERY glad I've discovered this recipe!"
"3","5","Yummy,Yum..This was my first step into cake making. And it was a big hit among my family members. The best part is that it was less messy, easy to make and time - saving. Thanx for boosting my confidence in cake making."
"3","5","Great texture and flavor--JUST like a chocolate cake out of a box. I love that there was no butter in it. I made cupcakes and they rose so much in the oven it made a huge mess and had to run the self-cleaning cycle when I was done. I also had to trim them before icing them but I got to eat the scraps so it wasn't a total loss (hee hee). I wouldn't change the amount of baking soda because I really enjoyed the texture of it but beware: if you make cupcakes with this, only fill them half full."
"3","5","Great - Moist... I used chocolate milk... yum!"
"3","5","This is the first chocolate cake from scratch that i've found to be excellent. i used soy-milk to make it non-dairy with no problem. i frosted it with a non-dairy whipped topping that i mixed together with crushed chocolate sandwich cookies."
"3","5","Wow... this cake is so moist and delicious and so simple to make. I added 1T instant coffee to the boiled water to enhance the chocolate and I used very good cocoa. I also iced it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (also added cocoa to make it more chocolatey... as if it needed it) and it was perfect. YUM!"
"3","5","5 stars for this! Used Ghirardhelli cocoa and it was great! Put a Cool Whip kind of frosting on it so it wasn't too sweet. I baked it in a 13x9 pan and everyone in the family loved it. Thanks."
"3","5","I made an icecream cake out of this scrumptious moist cake. I cooked the cake in a 9x13 baking pan, let the cake cool, cut the cake in half (lenghtwise), spread softened vanilla icecream on top of the bottom layer, put the top layer of cake on top of the layer of icecream and froze it. When it was frozen, I cut it into squares, drizzled it with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Yummy, yummy, yummy icecream cake."
"3","5","This was EXCELLENT! So moist! I will never make a different chocolate cake. I did add a little cinnamon to it and it gave it a great flavor."
"3","5","I was pleasantly suprised!! This cake had me a little scared because the batter was going to be thin so I almost skipped over it. Then I saw the reviews and they were all very good, so I thought what the heck, I'll try it. Excellent!!! Even better than the chocolate cake recipes I have in my HERSHEY dessert recipe book!!!! Very easy to make and quick. VERY MOIST!!! She wasn't lying when she said the batter would be thin!! WOW! But I don't care! The cake turns out wonderful! I finally found a great chocolate cake that is easy and better(not to mention healthier) than the boxed cakes. I will be making again very soon as cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party!!"
"3","5","This was perfect. It's the first cake I've made from scratch. I made it for my husband for Valentines Day, and we both loved it. It was very easy (and my electric mixers are broke, so mixing by hand is fine also) This will be my chocolate cake recipe from now on, thank you!!!"
"3","5","Loved this recipe. I was looking for something fast, easy for my son's birthday. I had all the ingredients on hand and it took only a few minutes to prepare. Everyone loved it and my husband said it was the best cake he ever had!!! I frosted it with a cream cheese vanilla frosting."
"2","5","Seriously my go-to recipe for chocolate cake... which I have made MANY of for family/friend's birthdays. Moist, light, and flavorful every time. Very versatile, you can add whatever fruits, spices, anything you please really- consistently raved about!"
"2","5","My mother used a cup of hot coffee instead of hot water.It really enhanced the flavor of the chocolate!"
"2","5","Tried it with a bit more of RitterSport chocolate and it was fabulous. Added some whipped cream and a strawberry as garnish. It was heavenly! However I left it in the fridge overnight and it became a bit too sticky... any remedies for that or am I doing something wrong?"
"2","4","I made this cake and followed the recipe and found it to be really moist and rich , nice cake. will be making it at thanksgiving, i will try to sub half the water for Kahlua"
"2","5","My new best cake recipe, better than my grand mothers! I hope she doesn't read this."
"2","5","I loved this recipe. It looks beautiful and goes perfectly with peanut butter icing!"
"2","5","Great recipe. Used what I had in the house: subbed light brown sugar for white, buttermilk for milk, and cake flour for regular. Still turned out wonderful, chocolaty and moist. As recommended, iced with butter cream; like to try peanut butter icing next time.   It's a fool-proof recipe. THANX!!!"
"2","5","Awesome cake! Sooo easy and fast, but so moist and everyone loved it. Halved it for a 9 inch circle cake. I used mostly dutch process cocoa and 2tbsp hershey's cocoa. Also used half half-and-half and half 2% milk for the milk :)"
"2","4","Make sure your baking powder is not expired. We often have a can in the cupboard, that is not used much, and expires. If it is expired it will negatively affect your recipe."
"2","4","It is Amazing moist and Delious I tried it with a different brand of Cocao and it is not as moist??? I also use chocolate pudding instead of frosting."
"2","5","i use spelt flour and soya milk I leave out the baking soda ..add choc hips .it cooks like a dream and I make it most weeks. I am making for my friends sons Birthday melting a choc bar on top . It is so moist, it freezes really well and its is better on day two as long as you wrap it well. It is the quickest and best choc cake EVER!!!"
"2","5","My 14 year old son wanted to make a cake for the first time. I found this recipe, liked it's simplicity. It was delicious! He did it all himself, and only had to start over when he confused tablespoons for teaspoons. :) The texture is amazing, and it wasn't overly sweet. Excellent recipe we will use again."
"2","5","this is my staple, I make it in 3 round pans for a layered cake, I make it as 24 cupcakes or in a large rectangle pan, it is fail proof, moist, easy and quick. I have made this recipe more than 60 times, never a flop. We love it. Forgiving and versatile"
"2","5","lovely!"
"2","1","Tried this recipe tonight and all my family was super excited for some yummy chocolate cake. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, however, it turned out to be highly disgusting. I am not exactly sure why. I am an experienced baker. Baked it at the right temperature and right time. Used all the ingredients. Highly disappointed in this recipe. It tasted very bland. Not going to use this recipe again.WHAT A WASTE OF INGREDIENTS .. My experience."
"2","5","Excellent chocolate cake - best I've ever made"
"2","5","This recipe never fails have used it for years not to sweet but rich in flavor. Thank you"
"2","5","My favorite chocolate cake recipie and everyone I share with love this cake very much too. Definitely a great chocolate craving settler."
"2","5","!!!!!OooooohhhhhhHH MY DEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was my first attempf EVER, to make a chocolate cake from scratch....... I have NO WORDS to describe how simple and delicioso it was...... I made it for my husband's birthday..... Thank you for sharing this with us =Â°> I will upload pictures later"
"2","3","Just got done eating this cake and it was very good. I followed directions exactly except for adding the full cup of cocoa. The cake was very moist,actually that is an understatement. To me the cake almost had more of a brownie like consistency than that of a cake. Since it was so moist it was nearly impossible to cut or get out in one piece even though I carefully lined pan with parchment paper.  Flavor was pretty good and I'm sure it would've been better if I had used better cocoa so that's on me. I would probably make this cake again but not if it was for something special where it needed to look nice. It's just way to moist and doesn't hold together well enough for me to want to decorate."
"2","5","Combine with 'One Minute Chocolate Icing' for a pretty quick-and-easy, but impressive, dessert. The batter always seems wrong because it's so thin, but it turns out perfectly airy and moist every time. I agree with other reviewers that the cake seems to be better after a day in the fridge, not sure why, but it's an excellent make ahead cake."
"2","5","This chocolate cake literally takes all other chocolate cakes I've ever made!! It's rich and creamy. It's not too sweet, too anything! ITS P-E-R-F-E-C-T!! I made absolutely no changes to this recipe. I follow the directions to a T!! I skimmed through some bad reviews and am perplexed as to how it could have gone wrong! Oh.. I did use ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa; if that means anything to anyone. This is the winner :D"
"2","5","This recipe was just delicious. It was very easy to make and my family loved it."
"2","5","This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I saw where somebody says it doesn't layer well, but it does! Every time I have made this I have layered it and have never had any issue. One thing to note though is that this cake is much, much better the second or third day."
"2","5","I doubled the recipe because I made (2) 9x13 cakes and increased the cooking time to 40-45 minutes. The cakes were moist and tasted excellent. My daughter who doesn't normally eat cake had a piece of this every night until it was gone. Will definitely make this again."
"2","1","When I added the boiling water, it turned the batter to a watery liquid. It didn't regain its consistency in the oven. I was using spring form pans, and it leaked all over my oven too. Since the recipe is otherwise very straightforward, I can't imagine trying it again."
"2","5","Love this recipe! I have used it many times and it always works wonderfully! I tend to add more cocoa because I love lots of chocolate but it isn't necessary. I have tried it with a variety of flours from regular all-purpose to rice flour and have had no difficulties even with those changes. Definitely a good go-to cake recipe, very easy and quick!"
"2","5","This is a GREAT receipe and has been since the 60's. This was first published by Peg Bracken in the 'I hate to cook, book'. Its well worth a read, there are other great quick clever ideas."
"2","5","First of all, this is absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had in my life. My husband who is a chocolate cake hater, licked his desert plate clean when I served him this one.   I altered the recipe a bit by reducing the sugar to 1.5 cup and mix white and brown sugar (was out of white sugar at that time) and I forgot to include the vanilla extract.   I frost it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this website and double the vanilla extract called for to complement the lack of it from the cake (and reduced the sugar required).   Result: A Chocolate Cake to Die For. Thank you for this amazingly easy and delicious recipe."
"2","5","Phenominal! Made only 1 change, upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup as other suggested. The flavor is spot on and the cake is soft and moist-not dense AT ALL!! Will def. use this again and again. PS-who cares if it came from a cocoa can and someone posted it-I never would have found it otherwise!"
"2","5","Wonderful recipe! It was so easy (I even thought I messed up somehow because of how easy it was). When it finished it tasted like heaven! It was chocolate, moist, and airy."
"2","5","I have made this several times and it's now my 'go to' cake. It's the best from scratch cake I have ever had and get so many compliments on it. I will never buy a boxed cake again!"
"2","5","easy to make and tastes good!"
"2","5","Love this recipe. I have made it so many times I have it memorized. I make mine in a bundt pan and bake for 50 min. I frost it while it's still pretty warm and it looks great. I get requests for this cake often for people's birthdays."
"2","4","I've made this recipe twice but both times were rather far apart so I didn't alter the recipe the second time. I followed it as written both times. The second time I did use a different pan, and it boiled over on one side (regular cheap bakeware). It also fell in the middle, making it pretty ugly until I turned it out upside down. Granted, I live at a high altitude (about 1 mile) but the amount it fell seemed worse than other things I've tried. As such I think I'll be looking for a different easy cake recipe that uses less baking powder/soda that works better where I live. However, the taste of this cake is very delicious and chocolately. It IS too thin of a batter for much like sprinkling in chocolate chips or anything though."
"2","5","Amazing! If you're looking for an easy, delicious chocolate cake recipe, you found it! I made it just as it said, and the cake turned out as promised. It was very rich and chocolately....almost like a dark chocolate, and very moist. Make sure you mix well, as it says to avoid lumps. I didn't have a mixer, so I had a few lumps, but that was totally my fault and the cake was still delicious!"
"2","5","perfect for cupcakes!"
"2","4","I tried it when it was a little warm, too gooey, but I let it cool and it was much better. It is not what I think what a cake should be, it's between a brownie, fudge and cake. I will try with a half cup of water instead of a full cup. I love the easiness, just a little moist for me. Different, but I liked it. I used a chocolate butter cream icing."
"2","5","I Made this cake today for my kids and they loved it. It was fast and easy. I will most def make this cake again."
"2","4","Excellent cake recipe. I'm not a great baker, and this was simple and fun enough for me to attempt with my four-year-old. I found that two 9-inch cake pans needed less than 30 minutes, but my oven's a bit fast. Combined with a chocolate cream cheese frosting and it was terrific. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","So moist and wonderful! I did make it with 1 cup chocolate instead of the 3/4 cup it called for. Many compliments!"
"2","5","I made this cake for my mom's birthday last week. I used a simple vanilla buttercream frosting on the outside and my entire family loved it. My mom was amazed this was home-made and not from the store, it was quite a hit! Great recipe. :)"
"2","5","We had an after dinner chocolate craving and needed an easy recipe using cocoa. We chose this recipe because of the reviews and simple ingredients. This cake is AWESOME! We followed the recipe EXACTLY, no changes. However, we did use a 9X13 glass dish and baked for 38 minutes at 350 degrees. The batter was a little thin, but we expected that from the reviews. I used Nestle's Tollhouse Cocoa. YUM! And we iced the cake with a rich homemade chocolate chip icing. We found that recipe on www.cooks.com (NEVER FAIL CHOCOLATE CHIP FROSTING)..... This cake is so moist!"
"2","5","Awesome cake! I added only one cup of sugar because i had really sweet frosting and it was just perfect!"
"2","5","I have a friend who is alergic to soy. This is a great recipe that I can make for him. I did not have success making them as cupcakes."
"2","5","Delicious and simple. This cake disappeared quickly.  Made twice - once as listed for a double layer birthday cake. Made again today as cupcakes for a Halloween party. Made 24 cupcakes - baked for 20 - 22 minutes. Because the recipe is so thin you might want to put the batter into something you can pour to keep from making a mess when pouring out the cupcakes."
"2","5","This is now my go to recipe for chocolate cake. Since using it for my mother's birthday cake I have used the recipe about 3 times in 3 weeks. Very moist. I made it into a bundt cake (bake for an hour) and drizzled it with the allrecipe recipe for satiny glaze."
"2","5","This was great! It was so easy and not too sweet. This will be my go to chocolate cake recipe."
"2","5","I know this will sound strange, but this cake has the fluffiness and the moisture that usually only comes from a box cake mix. It is really really good. If you don't want the complexity of Sandy's chocolate cake (my very favorite recipe here), this is a good choice, throw it all in one bowl and mix it up. I followed someone's suggestion and put it in a 9X13 pan for 40 minutes. Perfect. Canned frosting and you are good to go. It doesn't get easier than that."
"2","5","By far the best chocolate cake! The best part is you only use one bowl!!"
"2","5","Mmmm awesome. Made one 8-inch layer cake and 12 cupcakes. Will be keeping this recipe!"
"2","5","I was looking for a quick and easy chocolate cake and I found it! Super easy and I didn't even use an electric mixer. All of the ingredients came together great. I was skeptical of the runny batter, but it made for a wonderfully moist outcome. I did a single 9x13 and baked it for 35 minutes. It's the perfect balance of sweet and chocolate without making your teeth hurt!"
"2","5","Admittedly, I have not made any other cake from scratch. This was my first attempt, and even though I forgot the vanilla extract, it turned out FAB-U-LOUS. I could not be happier with it. I just ate a piece without frosting and it was just so good. It is so moist! I did take the advice of a few other reviewers and upped the cocoa to 1 cup. It turned out great! And yes, I am also thankful that the recipe warned about the thin batter. That would have really thrown me off! :)"
"2","4","This cake is delicious, moist and chocolatey. It was also really easy to make. I ran into problems in the baking and it still came out ok! I just made one cake instead of two, and poured it into a springform pan. I realised all too late that the pan had leaked all over the inside of my oven! Luckily it had only been in the oven for one minute so I poured it into a non-springform pan and turned the oven off so I could clean it. The batter sat there for at least 30 mins, which probably wasn't good for it, until I scraped off most of the batter inside the oven and pre-heated the oven again. I ended up baking the cake for about 40 mins all up and it turned out quite well, especially considering what it had been through. It is a bit crumbly so I had problems transferring it to a wire rack and then to a serving plate...had a few bits of cake break off the bottom. I made this cake for my family so presentation doesn't really matter. I covered it in chocolate frosting and put sprinkles on top. Will be making this again, hoepfully without the mishaps!"
"2","5","baked the cake yesterday for my friends surprise birthday party and everyone loved it surprisingly! made some changes though.. i added some extra cocoa on it.. tnx for the recipe!"
"2","5","I made cupcakes with this recipe and they were very good. I frosted them with creamy chocolate frosting and froze the excess- they were great even after a few weeks in the freezer and I can't wait to make them again!"
"2","5","This is the same recipe off of a famous label cocoa powder box. But is absolutely delicious! There is also a recipe for Perfect chocolatey frosting on the same cocoa label, and it is the perfect frosting for this cake. YUM!"
"2","1","I followed this recipe exactly. It didn't rise and it came out tasting burnt."
"2","5","Always a safe bet when I'm in a hurry. I love that there aren't a ton of dishes either!"
"2","5","Love, love love this recipe! It is soooo much better than boxed cake. Moister than any boxed cake out there as well. Make this and you will never look for another chocolate cake recipe again!!!"
"2","5","Great recipe. It is very moist and tasty but not overly sweet. To me this is the perfect replacement for boxed cake mix. My first attempt at this recipe (and baking a cake from scratch in general) was a success. If you are new to cake baking, try this recipe- it is easy and yields tasty results."
"2","5","This saved me today as my son told me last minute about having to bring a dozen cupcakes to scouts tonight. I didn't have a cake mix handy, and had all the ingredients to make this. So glad I tried this!! Perfect just the way it's written and quick to throw together too!! YUMMY and moist!"
"2","5","Great! We really loved this. Made half the recipe in a square 8x8 pan for my 3 year-old's birthday and it was just right."
"2","5","I made this cake because I had all of the ingredients. It was pretty good! It was very moist and rich!"
"2","5","This cake does turn out moist and delicious each time. It is especially good for chocolate lovers. Works well for cakes and cupcakes as well. I have been using it for years - it is exactly the same recipe that is on the Hershey's Cocoa container."
"2","5","These were DELICIOUS. Too Delicious! Receipe made 12 cupcakes and a round cake. Subbed half te oil for additional water. Used a quarter cup less sugar. Delish!"
"2","5","AMAZING cake! First time I ever made a homeade cake and it was perfect...thanks for sharing!!"
"2","5","Wow, so easy to make and tastes great. A family favourite.Thanks for posting this recipes."
"2","5","SO SO SO EASY to prepare! I had a last minute birthday cake emergency and this was nearly as easy and quick to prepare as a box mix! thank you!"
"2","5","i love the recipe i made this today it was excellent i changed it a little bit i put 1 cup of cocoa and 3/4 cup of water it turned out perfect thank you for the recipe :)"
"2","5","This is the best chocolate cake in the world!!! I followed the recipe 100% by the way I used hershey's cocoa some suggest to buy a better quality cocoa but if your on a budget hershey's is great!!"
"2","5","Absolutely the best chocolate cake and frosting recipe ever! Everybody who tastes it blurts out 'OMG!' before taking another bite as quick as they can! I think I will now call it the OMG Chocolate Cake! I have made the cake twice, with the same great results."
"2","5","Best chocolate cake ever. The kids don't even want frosting on this one. They love it the way it is. So easy, taste and texture are perfection."
"2","5","made this for my eleven-year old brother's birthday. Huge hit with all. Will do again."
"2","5","This is my standby chocolate cake for many occasions. It's very versatile. I make it with a patron citronge marmalade filling or orange infused chocolate buttercream and it's a hit."
"2","1","this is the best and easiest chocolate ever."
"2","5","My new go to recipe for cake. I have made this cake three times now and every time it is so easy and turns out moist and delicious. Frosts well too, I use this for all my birthday cakes."
"2","5","Um, can you say 'wow'? I never thought a recipe this easy would taste this good. This recipe totally blew all my complicated baking theories out of the water. Delicious, moist, simple...perfect."
"2","3","Cake turned out ok, it was more like a brownie than a cake though."
"2","4","I wished it was richer, but it was definitely easy to make."
"2","5","I made this cake for my husband's b-day. It was a huge hit! Super moist, fudgy, and very rich! I used 1 cup of cocoa and put chocolate ganache(I found recipe on this site) on top. Excellent!"
"2","5","This was so easy that I considered making up double the dry ingredients and keeping half in a zip-loc as homemade cake mix for the next time I need dessert in a hurry. Very moist, very chocolatey, and made entirely from 'pantry ingredients' in 10 minutes flat. Made as cupcakes, baking 18 minutes at 350."
"2","5","Yummy!!! A perfect basic chocolate cake recipe."
"2","5","This is a delicious and easy cake. My daughter made it for her teacher's birthday, and to share with the class. I got distracted while it was baking, and it got overcooked. Still, it got rave reviews and I'll definitely make it again. I used a vanilla buttercream frosting because I ran out of cocoa. Next time the frosting will be chocolate too."
"2","5","I loved this recipe. I think the 3/4 cup cocoa powder is the perfect amount of chocolate flavor, and the runny batter worked wonderful for the cupcakes I made with this. Not overly moist and dense as some of the recipes using a mix and box of pudding: it's the regular smooth light texture of perfect cake. Will make again and again, thanks so much for sharing :)"
"2","5","I baked this for my brother's birthday and it was quite a hit, very rich and chocolatey. Of course I did use an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa and butter instead of oil..."
"2","3","I am rating this three stars since it stuck very badly to the pan even though I greased and floured it. If I tried to make this again, I would probably line my pan with parchment paper."
"2","5","If you follow every step of the recipe, it will turn out just right! Its a thick, rich chocolate cake and quite moist. Made it for someone's birthday and everyone enjoyed it. Very good recipe!!!"
"2","5","This is the original Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate chocolate cake recipe my mom was making 40 years ago.....simply the best chocolate cake out there. Definitely give this recipe a go and don't get put off with the watery mix after the boiling water goes in, it bakes up perfectly. I use it for cupcakes and it works fine, also doubles and makes a large sheet cake for larger crowds. You can't go wrong!"
"2","5","Very light cake, simple to make. Not too sweet, perfect chocolate taste. Surprisingly the batter is very watery, as planned, but bakes up fine. I didn't have any baking soda, still came out great. Baked in a 9x13 pan. No frosting included in the recipe."
"2","5","Quickest chocolate cake I've ever made! So easy and taste great too!"
"2","5","You WILL wonder about the runny batter. The first time I made it I only jotted down the ingredients and baking info but didn't look at reviews. I was shocked at how thin it was, even before adding the boiling water. But I was assured when I ran back to the laptop to check the reviews. It really is runny, but I've made cupcakes with this recipe several times now and they are to die for! So moist! I only had half the necessary cocoa powder last time and it was still delicious. As I virtually always do, I used whole wheat pastry flour and it turned out fantastic. Next time I'll sub applesauce for half the oil and I have no doubt it will still be great."
"2","5","It made the entire house smell wonderful through the night after I removed it from the oven. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks amazing! I used dark chocolate frosting, and decorated it with crumbled Oreo cookies and gummi worms. I hope my boyfriend likes it! :)"
"2","4","Super easy and very good. It is the same recipe from the can of Hershey's cocoa powder. I made an 8' square and 12 cupcakes. The batter is very thin and soupy, but it bakes up wonderfully."
"2","5","Excellent. Used 1 cup cocoa powder. Tasted better the next day."
"2","4","I made this recipe as 2 dozen cupcakes for a friend's birthday last week, and the cupcakes turned out beautifully. As has been said by many, don't let the extremely runny batter scare you. But DO be careful not to overfill your pans. I used a lipped measuring cup to pour the batter into my cupcake liners and had no problems. Great recipe. I did not give it 5 stars simply because I wanted something a bit richer. Overall, though, it's a keeper."
"2","4","Very easy and very rich chocolate flavor. Next time, I will reduce the amount of oil by half and use applesauce for the other half."
"2","5","This turned out just perfect! Very yummy!"
"2","5","We all really liked this cake. I did use 1 cup of cocoa (instead of 3/4c) and used both regular cocoa and the special dark cocoa (about 1/4 dark to 3/4 regular). Very tasty cake! Used a chocolate butter creme frosting recipe from this site."
"2","5","Super easy to make and super delicious to eat!! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","I make this cake exactly as written and it's always perfect. It's good as soon as it cools, but even better after being stored in the refrigerator. It really improves with age, if it lasts that long. : ) I frost it with an icing made of butter, whipping cream, cocoa, vanilla, and powdered sugar. SO GOOD!"
"2","2","I tried to make these as cupcakes and they came out very weird and tasteless and dense. Won't make again... at least not as cupcakes."
"2","5","Yep, this is the exact same recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa box. Shirley is getting all of the credit for her plagiarism."
"2","5","I took this to a family gathering and it got rave reviews. So simple! I had never made a cake without out a box mix - anyone can do this! Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","Very good! Moist and delicious! Followed recipe exactly (except used 1 cup of cocoa) and frosted with 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' from this site. I made 2 layers, and in between them I put a filling made with 1/4 cup sugar, 12 oz frozen raspberries, and 8 oz cream cheese. It was very good!"
"2","5","This cake is a breeze to make, tastes great and has a moist crumb. My mother asked me for the recipe, I don't know what higher praise a girl could ask for."
"2","5","I made this cake for my son's first birthday. I made a bundt cake and cooked for about 48 minutes. It came out moist and it was a hit at the party. This cake is a keeper for sure."
"2","1","Couldn't get it to come out of the pan, it was kind of mushy. I followed the recipe exactly and waited 10+ minutes to try and remove from the pan. It tasted ok, but isn't anything that I would serve. I was really hoping this receip would turn out for me. Now i need to bake a different birthday cake."
"2","5","You will never use a box cake again. Seriously. This is just as easy, you already have the ingredients, and it is delicious! Tender and dark. It has a perfect texture for a cake, and a nice rich chocolately flavour. (for the topping, I mix one can of sweetened condensed milk with two bars of unsweetened chocolate in the microwave. Chop the chocolate so it melts easily- so easy, so rich and thick) This cake is a chocolate lover's dream."
"2","5","I didn't get to taste it--made cupcakes for a cupcake walk--but my children who did raved about it, and keep asking me to make more. The batter flavor and consistency reminds me of my favorite chocolate sheet cake recipe. I used it with the Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting from Allrecipes--minus the cocoa--and I can vouch that the frosting was delicious! :-)"
"2","5","This is probably the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten. The only thing is that it's almost too moist. I adde more flour, and had it in the oven for another 10 minutes, I don't know if it was because I halfed the recipe. 5 starts anyway, if someone can give me some advide about frostings/fillings to this cake..I would be glad to know."
"2","5","This is the exact recipe for 'Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake' from the back of the Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa can. I've been making it for years. It really is the best chocolate cake ever. Frost it with the 'Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Frosting' recipe also on the back of the same cocoa can."
"2","5","Made it for my husbands b-day cake. At the request for chocolate cake. It turned out wonderful! moist and delish!!!! It was easy and less mess..which is always a plus in my book!"
"2","3","Very easy to make, though the boiling water step threw me off. It definitely does have a strong baking soda taste, and I didn't find it that flavorful. (Topped with Pilsbury Vanilla frosting, but it almost completely overpowers the cake's flavor.) Will keep on the lookout for other cake recipes."
"2","2","A strange recipe from start to finish. I will not make this again."
"2","5","This cake was very good! I made it the night before, added 1 cup of cocoa and it was delicious! Did a double layer cake with chocolate frosting and crunchie bar candy pieces in between the layers and on top! yum!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly. It's a great chocolate cake recipe! This was easy to make, very moist and chocolatey, and was gobbled up quickly by our kids. It will be my new go-to recipe for chocolate cake. Thanks for sharing the reicpe, shirleyo."
"2","4","This turned out perfectly and was very simple to make. My only complaint is that it tasted too much like cake from a mix."
"2","5","Although I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, the cake turned out perfectly sweet and moist, dense but still fluffy. Great recipe to have around for a quick crowd pleaser."
"2","5","EXCELLENT! Absolutely excellent! This cake is very moist. I am not the best cake baker in the world, so I have to work extra hard looking for 'no fail' recipes. This is it! I used a 13 x 9 pan and baked about 40 minutes, then frosted with a chocolate cream cheese frosting. No more box mixes for me!"
"2","5","I'm not a big chocolate cake fan, but made these for a friend's birthday. I'm a chocolate cake fan now! WOW! This is the first time I've made cake from scratch, not a box. I actually made cupcakes. I halved the recipe and made 12 cupcakes, and they cooked 25 minutes on 350. If you make cupcakes, make sure to fill cups only half full because they rise a lot. Don't be freaked out by the boiled water. It seemed way too soupy to me, but turned out great."
"2","5","Love this recipe! Super moist, with much better flavor then a box mix. So easy! I'll never make another chocolate cake recipe again! Don't use less water...you get crispy edges."
"2","5","This is a great cake, and it was pretty easy, too. It tastes just like the chocolate cakes my mom made when I was a child. I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and there was no difference in taste (the family didn't know! and couldn't tell!) plus I saved 109 grams of fat and 920 calories. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","This was a great chocolate cake. I didn't have any butter, that's why I picked this one. It was easy to make and tasted great, very chocolatey. After you add the boiling water it's very thin and runny, but that's okay it still works. It wsn't fluffy like a store bought cake, but it was very moist. My husband had a cake like this growing up and he thought this recipe was very good. I made 1/2 the recipe and baked it in an 8-inch square pan, it worked fine."
"2","5","YUMMY! This is such a wonderfully moist and delicious chocolate cake. Next time, though, I plan to use parchment paper to line the pans - I had some trouble getting the cakes out of the pans even though I greased and floured them. Great recipe!!"
"2","4","This is a very easy recipe to make; it's fast and really does require only one bowl to make. The batter will be runny but it fluffs up to a nice consistency. I did as some other reviewers suggested and added 1 cup of cocoa instead of what the recipe suggested since I am a chocolate fanatic. I made this cake for a friend's birthday and he loved it so. I will definitely make it again."
"2","5","I can't tell you how many times I have made this and it always turn out great. It's super easy to make and you usually have all the ingredients on hand."
"2","3","surely it tasted like it too sweet & overpowering the chocolate. fails to be a 5*.Gosh when will i have the perfect chocolate cake??!"
"2","5","this was REALLY easy abd REALLY good! I am a terrible baker, but i couldn't mess this up! I used diluted coffe in place of water and a full cup of cocoa powder....yum! 1 hour in a bundt pan.  Chocolate glaze: mix cocoa, powdered sugar and a little milk until desired consistency. drizzle over cooled cake!"
"2","5","Everyone loved this delicious, moist chocolate cake! I used rice milk instead of cows milk to make it dairy free."
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful! When I put the boiled water in, I was afraid it was too thin, but it turned out with great texture. I baked it in a ten inch bundt pan and had to change the time of course. 50 minutes and it turned out perfectly! =)"
"2","5","This cake is astonishingly good and is even more amazing for how simple the recipe is. This is the best recipe for a chocolate cake that I have ever found, and I have been baking chocolate cakes for 10 years. I've made this recipe to the 't', and also increasing the cocoa powder to a full cup. My preference is the little extra cocoa :)"
"2","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it came out fabulous! Very moist and good. I use cocoa powder instead of flour to 'flour' the pans (so it doesn't leave white spots in the cake). Frosted with Rick's Buttercream Frosting. Topped with peanut butter chips and toasted pecans."
"2","5","i must confess, i am not a baker, but this cake was very easy, moist and delicious. no need to buy a box ever again. thanks for the post!"
"2","4","This is a great chocolate cake recipe. You can find the exact recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa tin, and I've been making it for years--always with excellent results. Not sure how someone could pass this off as their own recipe... However, if you add one teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and substitute hot coffee for the boiling water, the cake is absolutely divine! I'd suggest using the frosting recipe that's also on the back of the Hershey's tin, as it goes perfectly with this cake."
"2","5","great. I made no changes to this recipe. There is no need to ever look for another chocolate cake recipe. This is so moist."
"2","5","Delicious and so simple! Same exact recipe is on back of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa. No reason to spend lots of time on other recipes. This one is great. Nice rich chocolate flavor. I also frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting (1/2 recipe)."
"2","5","Perfect chocolate cake"
"2","5","BEST chocolate cake I have EVER eaten,,or made,Wonderfull.Only change I made was I substituted 1 cup really hot coffee for the boiling water,will make again & again!"
"2","5","This recipe is great! I made it into cupcakes for my cousin's wedding 'cake' with buttercream icing and it was a huge hit!"
"2","5","absolutely delicious!! perfect just the way they are. I did use for CUPCAKES, and just a warning only fill half way, NO more! very good with Luscious buttercream frosting that you can turn any color you'd like!"
"2","5","WOW!!! This cake is brilliant! It is lovely,chocolatey,dark and moist.!! Its also so easy to make!!!"
"2","5","I followed the directions to a T and it was great. used for a black forest cake- poured liqueur on each layer, then filled with whipped cream and canned black cherries. Finished by icing with whipped cream. All my coworkers loved it! I will be using this recipe often."
"2","5","AMAZING. I'm 14 and I made this for my friend's birthday 2 days ago. The SMELL of it was sooo chocolate-y (although maybe that's because I added some Ganache) that she took it out to share during lunchtime at school. All my friends loved it and now I need to bake 2 more for 2 people's birthdays... both next month! Oh, and I just want to say that after adding the water, the batter is REALLY runny but I found that adding any more flour to it makes it too heavy. And I added 3 tablespoons more of cocoa. Sifted, of course. Perfection!"
"2","2","Tastes like a cake mix from a box recipe and I don't prefer thoes at all. I made cupcakes and the middles of each cupcake sunk. I don't know what went wrong."
"2","5","Great cake, very dense and moist. I found this same recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa Powder, so I knew it was a winner!"
"2","5","This cake is nicely moist, and very good. It's also extremely easy to make. I made it for my daughter's birthday, and it was enjoyed by the whole family. It does make a very thin batter, but it bakes up beautifully into a very tasty cake. Make sure you grease and flour your cake pans well though, as it has a tendency to try and stick. I did increase the cocoa to one cup, but otherwise followed the directions, and it came out very well. I will definitely be using this recipe again!"
"2","5","This was a great recipe! Very moist cake and I thought it was also very chocolatey. The only thing I did different was used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again! :)"
"2","5","Wow.. this one is a keeper. No mess at all, easy to pour to the muffin pans (I made cupcakes). I baked 24 cupcakes, 350 degrees, for 25 mnts."
"2","5","Absolutely lovely chocolate cake recipe! I substituted hot coffee for the boiling water and it turned out perfectly. Also added about 5 minutes to the cooking time."
"2","5","Very easy to make and the result is a delicious and moist chocolate cake. I tried both in a cupcake and cake form, and both produce excellent results. Best to leave it for few hours to savour the chocolatey top!   Definitely a keeper...."
"2","4","Super easy and pretty darn good. Not the most amazing cake I've ever eaten, but I would make it again. I had all the ingredients on hand and the cake was moist and good! I did use coffee instead of water."
"2","5","I gave up chocolate for lent so I made this cake for Easter. I used the 'Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting' for the filling and frosted with the 'Special Buttercream Frosting'. The cake itself was so easy and came out great! I took others advise and made it the night before so it could sit in the fridge. I found that it was even better the third day so I can't wait to have another piece tonight! Will make again and again since it doesn't really take any added work compared to a box cake, but it's nice to say it's from scratch!"
"2","5","This cake is awesome! I made it for my parents' 25th anniversary with the 'Grocery Store Frosting', which is also on this site, and it was amazing! Thank you so much."
"2","5","I followed the recipe from the back of the Hershey's cocoa bag. I used Droste cocoa and baked the cake in 2 9' round pans. I split the layers and filled them with dark chocolate pudding and frosted the now 4 layer cake with milk chocolate butter cream. This is a fantastic, moist cake. My dh isn't a chocolate cake fan at all, but after one bite he couldn't stay out of this cake. I kept it in the fridge because of the filling, I just let the sliced sit for 10 minutes before serving. Don't use hot water-make sure it's boiling! The boiling water brings out the chocolatey-ness of the cocoa."
"2","5","Made this for a friend's birthday--was super moist and had just the right amount of chocolate! I already had all the ingredients in my pantry. This will definitely be an 'old reliable' recipe in my collection."
"2","4","A very nice and moist cake. I frosted this cake with Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting and I thought they complimented each other nicely. A nice cake overall."
"2","5","I made this cake for my nice's birhtday and the flavor and consistency was perfect. I used chocolate frosting to decorate it and it turned out beutiful. I followed the recipe exatly... the results were wonderful."
"2","4","Warning: If you are looking for a rich dense chocolatey cake, this is NOT for you. The cake was very light, fluffy and moist but the taste was nothing special fresh from the oven (It tasted like cake from those boxed cake mixes). I am a huge chocolate fan and this cake just didn't have enough chocolate flavour for me. BUT I left it overnight in the fridge and it was SOOOO MUCH BETTER the next day. Much more dense and rich. Perfect with ice-cream!"
"2","5","Excellent chocolate cake. Moist and delicious. Used a 9x13 pan instead of a layer cake. Frosted with my favorite buttercream icing and served it to my family for Valentine's Day. A huge hit."
"2","5","As a person who grew in the south and a strong southern cooker, dessert is very important especially after meals.This was a wonderful recipe. It reminded me a lt of my mother's wonderful triple layer cakes during holidays. It was very easy and super moist. I will use this again. But i cheated a little, i used ready made frosting"
"2","5","Couldn't be simpler! I made it for my father-in-law's birthday last night, and it received rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, then frosted it with cream cheese frosting. The batter is extremely runny after you add the cup of boiling water, but don't let that concern you. It is a fantastic cake, and I doubt I will even make a chocolate cake from a box again."
"2","5","This chocolate cake was so easy, and absolutely scrumptious! Me and my 7yr old neice made it last night.The only thing that we different~ My neice LOVES CHOCOLATE, so she suggested wanting pudding on her cake. So the only change we made was we spread chololate pudding between the two round cakes. YUMM-O We also used the cream cheese chocolate frosing on this site submitted by Carol. Will definately use again. Thank you"
"2","4","Good basic recipe! It was nice and moist, but a little bit crumbly. It didn't want to come out of the pan, so make sure to grease well. The taste is very strong, so using a good cocoa powder is key. I thought it tasted a bit more like a brownie than a cake, but the texture was perfect."
"2","5","I made the cake yesterday for my cousin's birthday and it was a hit! It was so moist! When I was making it I was a little scared after I added the boiling water but it turned out great! I will never make a chocolate cake from the box again."
"2","5","This cake is AMAZING!!! The first time I made it I had to remember the batter is suppose to be thin from the cup of boiling water. It stays moist from the first cut to the last (which was about two days in my house)!! I have already made this cake three times and it is the only chocolate cake I would ever make."
"2","5","Unfortunatly I only got to lick the knife that I used to level the cake, but even that was good. I used a Mickey Mouse shaped pan, coated it well with Wilton's cake release and had no problems with the cake sticking to the pan or falling apart. I was a little nervous at how thin the batter was, but in the end it was a perfectly moist chocolate cake. I plan to make this again soon so I can try some."
"2","5","great recipe. Turns out perfect every time"
"2","5","Oh my goodness! This was better than a boxed mix by far! My cakes always seemed to come out tasting flat, but this is rich, moist and chocolaty. My compliments to the recipe submitter. This is now in my personal recipe box and my days of buying boxed mixes are over."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe--moist and rich chocolate taste. I sifted confectioners' sugar on the finished cake instead of frosting. Delicious. One thing I would note is that I used 8' pans and had to bake for about 50 minutes."
"2","4","This recipe made 24 moist cupcakes; very easy and low fuss."
"2","5","This is truly the most delicious chocolate cake I've ever eaten! AND it's sooo fast and easy to make, that it's almost embarrassing when everyone comes to you to say how great it is. Equally great as cupcakes, too. I went exactly by the recipe, by the way...and it is frighteningly thin looking...but only the first time. Have no fear! :)"
"2","5","This is the only chocolate cake recipe I will be using from now on. I made it the first time exactly according to the recipe and was so impressed with the results that I made it again with 100% whole wheat flour. I honestly couldn't tell the difference; I ate almost the whole cake telling myself that I was just getting my whole grains...hehe. It was very light and moist and was sufficient without frosting. Good choice, and so easy! ***UPDATE; I have started to add a little less liquid (maybe 1/4 cup less) with a little more cocoa (1-2 Tablespoons more), and it's fantastic. For parties, I always frost this with a slightly modified version of Rich Chocolate Frosting on this site (more cocoa there too), and when I served it at my son's birthday party, my whole family said that it was the best chocolate cake they had ever had. I've never heard so many compliments about a cake. Sometimes I sub coffee for the water, too; this is a real winner."
"2","5","Batter is a little scary cause it is soooo thin---but not to worry---the cake tastes and looks great!"
"2","5","First of all, I must say this was the moistest cake I've EVER eaten. Sooo yummy. I would have never made it though without seeing all the great reviews. So thank you for the post. My entire family LOVES this cake!!"
"2","5","This cake is rich, moist and INTENSELY chocolate. I spent a little more money to get a good quality cocoa and it was absolutely worth it! For those who may find the information helpful - this cake can be made with rice milk instead of regular milk. I don't know whether or not it changes the taste, but it comes out tasting fantastic, so if you're lactose intollerant, it's worth making the switch.  Somewhere on this website, I found a recipe for a mocha-rum icing. I made it with chocolate liqeuer instead of rum. It worked very nicely with the cake."
"2","5","The recipe is very good I made cupcakes by decreasing the temp to 325. I thought they would be too runny but they turned out terrific. I will use again."
"2","5","This recipe is awesome. U wont regret trying it. It was so easy to make.. check out pic."
"2","4","I felt this was good but something was missing. The cake was moist. But the consistency of the cake was almost like eating sponge cake."
"2","3","moist and light. Flavor was lacking."
"2","5","This cake was delicious! I cut the recipe in half to make one layer. I made the other layer out of Recees Peanut Butter ice cream that I scooped into the other 9' baking pan. (Line pan with wax paper first. Then I put crumbled Oreo Cookies on top. Freeze. Take ice cream layer out of pan and put on plate with cookie side up. Put chocolate cake layer on top of ice cream layer. Spread with store bought vanilla frosting. Freeze until ready to eat. Delicious! Kid's loved it."
"2","5","Fluffy! Will make again. I used a mixture of cake flour and all purpose. Next time I will use ALL cake flour. I also used a total of 1c of cocoa, splenda baking mixture for sugar. Great basic chocolate cake recipe- super fast and easy. Also, definitely use the creamy chocolate frosting recipe on this website- it's super easy and goes perfect with this cake."
"2","5","SO moist. Delicious. Added a bit of instant coffee to the boiling water. Cake held together well when I sculpted it into a 3D race car. ATTENTION: Do not half this recipe. The cake will not turn out."
"2","4","this tasted yummy. it was a hit at my son's birthday. both rounds fell for some reason - probably next time i'll add more flour and see if that helps."
"2","5","This cake was moist and flavorful. I would make it again. I followed the recipe exactly. The chocolate flavor was great. I used a 9 x 13 glass pan and it worked great. I highly recommend this recipe."
"2","5","I made this recipe following it exactly, except I substituted corn flour (masa) for the white flour, to make it gluten free! and I baked the whole thing in a 9x13 pan. It turned out great, I actually think the corn flour added more flavor! I did not even frost it, but I did sprinkle some white chocolate chips on top. I will definatly be making this recipe again"
"1","5","Delicious! Made this recipe exactly as written except made a sheet cake instead of two rounds. It turned out moist and fluffy and fantastic."
"1","5","I used light coconut milk (can) since we're lactose intolerant. I also used brown sugar instead of white. The cake was really moist. I topped it with chocolate panache. I'll be making the again. It is now one of my go to recipes."
"1","5","This cake is so good and easy to make. Always a hit."
"1","5","I wanted to ask about a frosting resipe that any one have tried and thinks that it is amazing"
"1","5","Whipped this up for my pregnant wife last night. Had all the ingredients on hand and the batter only took five minutes to prep. Great recipe and will keep on hand for future emergency cake moments. Thanks!"
"1","5","This is seriously the most delicious chocolate cake I've ever had. I used the highest quality cocoa I could find and a raw sugar, followed everything else exactly. Moist, fudgy and utterly delicious. Since it is so rich, I skipped a butter cream option and frosted it instead with a sour cream, whipped topping recipe from another website. It complimented the cake beautifully without adding anything overpowering. I'm not a big cake person, but was looking for something for my daughter's birthday. I think I just found my favorite cake recipe."
"1","5","I have tried 1000s of recipes it seemed like, and this is the only one that I LOVE. I made it exactly like the recipe says, and I have also made it using 1 cup cocoa and 1 cup freshly brewed coffe and an extra 1/4 cup flour. Both are amazing."
"1","4","I made this cake last weekend I was impressed with how moist it stay'd I put a whipped icing flavoured with coffee delious"
"1","5","Was so amazing!! Highly recommend. I like more chocolate so added a wee bit more cocoa"
"1","3","I'm giving this only 3 stars because it lacks flavor. Even with 1C cocoa and some chocolate chips sprinkled on top this lacked chocolate flavor. It was very easy and quick (no butter needed softening, no chocolate needed melting) and it was moist, so it could be a useful recipe when you are in a hurry. If you have the right icing or some ice cream to go with it, it is ok."
"1","5","I get rave reviews EVERY time I make this cake! Delicious, easy and ewey gooey!"
"1","3","Did not care for this recipe, it tasted okay, but the texture was gummy!"
"1","2","It was an okay recipe, but it definitely could be improved upon. The cake was super moist. Although edible, fell apart. The chocolate also tasted a bit washed out."
"1","5","This cake turned out great!! Super moist and delicious!!! I used 1cup cocoa powder as several others suggested, and coffee instead of boiling water as I had a cup left over. I made it early enough so I could let it rest as one reviewer recommended, and was scrumptious! I made a peppermint buttercream icing, and it made a great peppermint patty cake. I am saving this to make again!!"
"1","4","i was searching for a perfect moist chocolate cake for almost a month and eventually saw this on youtube. no regrets of baking this! it was super moist and definitely delicious!"
"1","5","Exceptionally moist, rich cake! Like others suggested, I upped the cocoa to 1 cup, baked it as a snack cake in a 9 x 13 inch pan lined with parchment paper for 35 minutes, and it was so easy to cut and serve. I've been 'snacking' on it since it cooled enough to do that! Hubby loved it and I'm pretty sure our grandson will give it his seal of approval.  One bowl, no creaming butter, it was as easy as dumping everything in, then adding the cup of water I boiled in a Pyrex container in the microwave! I won't be looking for another chocolate cake recipe! Oh....and for anyone who needs the kind of cake-pop recipe that involves mixing baked cake with frosting, this is it! Thank you!"
"1","5","It so good , I can't explain it ! My husband can not stop eating it !! Thank you so much for sharing it !"
"1","1","Tastes like baking soda."
"1","5","Really really good! I made cupcakes and are moist and chocolaty. Will definitely be my go to chocolate cake recipe."
"1","5","Perfect.. but make sure you have a very good non-stick surface, I just used what I had. Also, as mentioned in other reviews... I used 1 cup of cocoa, and almost 1 tsp of baking soda (original recipe uses too much). I also added the boiling water 1/4 at a time and ended up using only 3/4 which was more than enough... I think others might have used all of the water... which might be why they ended up with a far too moist result. I ended up with a total of eight 4' cakes (but then again... I filled the pans too much lol)"
"1","5","This is a great Super Bowl cake. I made this cake last minute, not knowing a bunch of people were coming. It was just perfect. Nice and moist and fluffy. This receipt was easy to make, and I am 11 years old. I suggest this cake! :)"
"1","5","Super easy and absolutely delicious. Everyone always loves this. This is the exact same recipe on the Hershey's coco box, I believe. I did increase the coco powder to one full cup though. This recipe halves easily. Would recommend using spring-form pans for presentation purposes as this cake is very soft and crumbles/breaks easily when transferring. Oddly, it gets better after sitting in the fridge for a while! I suggest letting it cool in the fridge a full night before serving."
"1","5","Very moist devil's food cake. I made it as a bundt and cut recipe in half. Great quick cake!"
"1","5","Delicious and moist. It is crumbly though, so it didn't stick together well as a layer cake. We ate it with a spoon instead of a fork. ;-) One thing to note: Make sure you put the boiling water in last. I goofed up and forgot to put in the flour, so I added it after the boiling water. I ended up with flour lumps that I suspect the boiling water would have dissolved. Highly recommend this recipe!"
"1","5","I tried this cake as an 'I'm-Bored-With-Box-Cakes' attempt. It came out so wonderfully delicious! Even my mom, who is not at all a chocolate cake eater, LOVED IT! She still swears, to this day, I bought this out somewhere. I did up the Cocoa powder to 1 cup, and even got a little creative with the icing and added candy bars to the actual cake mix after it had cooked for about 5 mins. It's still fabulous!!!"
"1","5","I made this cake last night. The whole family absolutely loved it. My husband and mom both said it was the best cake they had ever had. No more box cakes in this house. I Topped it with chocolate buttercream icing."
"1","5","Made this as a double layer cake with fudge frosting, almond slices to sides and top then added drained Maraschino cherries around the top to border. Husband LOVED it!!! Even three days later in a cake box out of the fridge tasted perfect and moist. Will be doing this again over the weekend!"
"1","4","I was delightfully surprised for the gorgeous cake I got in the very first go! Though the centre sank in slightly,it looked perfectly fine after icing. The cake is amazingly moist and dense and reeeeally rich.My husband absolutely loved it.The only thing I didnt like it was a slight after taste of baking soda so m gonna reduce the quantity slightly n try again.Also,the runny consistency will scare u,but dont be... and also it rises quite a bit,so fill your pans much lesser than half."
"1","5","Easy to make, just swopped white sugar for brown...still tasted great. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","I'm stuck indoors during a typhoon and I'm craving chocolate cake. Found this recipe and gave it a try. I'm glad there was an option for splitting the recipe in half and exact measurements cause I only had a cup of sugar left. I substituted the boiling water with some fresh hot coffee and the cake was DELISH!! Totally saving this recipe for future cravings."
"1","4","This was absolutely delicious! I forgot the oil and it was still very moist. Used a cream cheese frosting and had lots of good reviews."
"1","5","I've used this recipe exactly as is twice for layer cakes & was thrilled both times with how it turned out. It's moist & delicious - better than a boxed mix!"
"1","5","Really good and easy to follow cake recipe. I doubled the cocoa powder to make the chocolate flavor more intense. The cake Ended up being very moist and fluffy with good flavor."
"1","5","This is the best recipe I've come across. I substituted Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and used espresso instead of water. I baked it in a bundt pan and finished it with a light dusting of confectioner's sugar. I think the cake is moist enough to not need any icing. This is my new go to chocolate cake."
"1","5","To die for. I made the mistake of starting this mix in cake pans with a removable bottom. It leaked out a bit when it started baking. However, once baked and topped with chocolate frosting ... best chocolate cake ever though it only lasted a day and a half."
"1","5","This cake is delicious! I did as suggested by other reviewers and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup. I also used an espresso and then boiling water for the rest of the one cup boiling water in the instructions. I used gharadelli cocoa powder. I was a little thrown by how runny the batter was but wasn't nervous about it because all the other reviews said that was how it was supposed to be. I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes and when it was cooled I sprinkled confectionary sugar on top. So good it didn't even need frosting! It was the perfect end to dinner with a nice espresso. Definitely staying in my recipe rotation for when I am having a chocolate craving! Thank you!!"
"1","5","Such a great recipe! I made one heart shaped cake with peanut butter frosting and used the remaining batter for a small bundt cake. I added frozen raspberries to the small bundt cake after 20 minutes of baking and it turned out so tasty!!! I covered that with a chocolate ganache. I also used substitute sugar and only used water (no milk). Perfect, moist, and so rich! Thank you!"
"1","5","This is an amazing recipe I just tried it now it's just so irresistible thanks a ton to all recipes and Shirleyo ??????????"
"1","5","chocolatey and moist, yummy"
"1","4","When I was 10 years old I made it as a surprise for my mothers birthday. She would mention this every week when I phoned her at 88 years old while she was going through Alzheimers."
"1","5","My family really liked this recipe. They were all surprised when I told them that it wasn't a cake box recipe. It was very easy to do and it took little time to make"
"1","5","Whenever I try a recipe from this site the first time, I customarily follow it to the letter. But for this cake, I decided to add a tablespoon of instant coffee just because I always do with chocolate cakes to enhance the flavor. And lucky thing, too because I forgot to add the vanilla. This is the best, moist, flavorful chocolate cake I ever tasted and the kids, who are my harshest critics, agree as well. For frosting, I decided to make try the fluffy, white frosting from this site as well, for nostalgia, as it was the frosting that my Mom also used when I was a kid myself. It was a perfect combination with the cake. It tasted like marshmallow with just the right sweetness. I'm happy that I finally found the perfect recipe for my chocolate cake. Thanks for sharing!!"
"1","5","One of the best cake recipe.Totally loved it"
"1","5","Best chocolate cake recipe I have ever tried. Simple. Moist. Rich. And the quick easy clean up is a plus. This is my go to recipe for birthdays or other special events that I am bringing a dessert to."
"1","5","It was an easy cake to make I might jus make it again. It was really good to really rich but so sweet. I was in chocolate heaven!"
"1","5","Making this cake for the second time now. It's fantastic, very tasty and moist. I baked in a 9x13 pan as I wasn't wanting a layer cake but a larger cake to cut into squares. The first one was a little tricky to get out the tin but I didn't leave it to cool for 10 minutes before trying it! My fault. This cake keeps really well. I had it well wrapped on the counter for 2 days and then there was a couple of pieces still left so I froze them and got them out when needed. It still tasted just as good!"
"1","5","This is a good cake, but I am not sure if anyone realizes that this recipe is on the back of Hershey's Cocoa unsweetened box."
"1","4","This was a cool recipe"
"1","1","i tried this and i kept the oven on for 2 hours and the cake would not bake"
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for decades! since my grandma and always turns Perfectly very moist, delicious and lot of chocolate flavor. Secret: A good cocoa powder such as Hershey's gives an extraordinay flavor against other cocoa powders.As I live in front of the beach, Humidity is an extra so I cut off a little water as les than 1/4 of cup and turns the same."
"1","5","I made this recipe just as it says and I was not disappointed at all... It is rich, moist, flavorful, and amazingly easy to make. One word, Delicious!!!!"
"1","5","So easy and yummy"
"1","5","Holy Cow! The best chocolate cake I have ever had. I made it with 1 cup cocoa powder like someone else suggested. It's so easy to make and my family was very satisfied. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","I had a hankerin' for chocolate cake made easy & simple so I tried this recipe. Super easy & super delish!!! Wow!!! It's fluffy, moist & didn't take more than 10 minutes to stir everything up (I was too lazy to use my hand held mixer) & baked the batter in a deep casserole glass dish. It took approximately 50 minutes at 350 degrees to bake & made a chocolate cream cheese frosting. It's the most perfect chocolate cake recipe & I highly recommend it.."
"1","5","Moist and delicious! Bumped cocoa powder up to 1 full cup per some previous reviews and baked in 9 X 13 pan, other than that made exactly as recipe states. Frosted with a chocolate buttercream and it made the perfect 80th birthday cake for my mother."
"1","5","I didn't have any oil on hand so I used mayo instead and it turned out extremely moist! Best. Cake. Ever."
"1","5","This recipe is fantastic. Wot a waste of money on boxed chocolate cake. Thanks."
"1","5","It was incredibly rich! Be careful not to pair it with a strong icing/frosting--it will drown the taste of this AWESOME cake! Everyone loved it, even my crazy picky friends."
"1","5","Perfect and so simple! My family canÂ´t get enough."
"1","5","I love this cake! I use this recipe for pretty much any chocolate cake I ever make. :)"
"1","5","I was pretty worried when I saw the thinness of the batter, even though I was pretty careful in following the recipe. I shouldn't have been this cake is amazing. This will be my go to chocolate cake from now on."
"1","5","This is one of the best homemade chocolate cakes I have ever made. My son has a allergy to egg so we substitute that with soy milk and it is still the best one yet!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely the BEST chocolate cake I've ever made or tasted!"
"1","5","Great cake! Easy to prepare and very moist and chocolatey. I made cupcakes and came out great! I did change the amount of chocolate to 1 cup, though."
"1","5","This chocolate cake is so easy and great for cakes or cupcakes. I suggest baking cupcakes for around 18-20 minutes, same temperature. Also to use an ice cream scoop for the perfect amount of cake in the baking cup. This is wonderful and I usually top it with powdered sugar or a simple vanilla glaze from this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vanilla-glaze/detail.aspx) which is a glorious touch."
"1","5","absolutely amazing! mine turned out perfect! this will be my new standby!"
"1","5","I love how tasty and light it is! I've made it three times already and people love it too."
"1","5","This cake is delicious. I substituted 1 c boiling coffee instead of the water and it enhanced the chocolate flavor. Everyone loved it."
"1","2","Too sweet! If I ever make this cake again I will only use a quarter cup of sugar."
"1","5","Oh mercy this cake was perfect. I haven't baked a cake from scratch for awhile and it was a breeze - was a little nervous about the boiling water but was very happy and surprised that it came out so moist and better than any cake I think I've ever had or made. Yum."
"1","5","This recipe tasted so delicious! I made it for my grandpa's birthday, and it was so moist and chocolatey! I love this cake!"
"1","5","Thank you for the great cake recipe! I made this yesterday--my first ever cake not made from a box mix! It could not have been easier. It was definitely helpful to read the negative reviews before making this, to be forewarned about just how thin the batter is. I might have thought I'd messed up, otherwise, because it was quite thin. Baked evenly and was ready in exactly 32 minutes. Since it seems like some people have issues getting it cooked perfectly, it must vary from oven to oven in terms of when it's ready."
"1","5","This was a perfect chocolate cake. I just made this recipe and it was really easy to follow with great results! Cake was really moist and yummy, no complaints and will definitely make again."
"1","5","I agree with what someone else said, at first didn't taste quite right but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours it's awesome, even my picky husband loves it! I will use 1 cup cocoa next time though. I'm glad for the note that the batter is runny, I would have thought I screwed up. It looked like hot chocolate not cake batter. I used two Christmas tree shaped pie pans. They were not big enough, lol. I think I over filled them because they spilled over. Also someone pointed out how difficult the cakes are to get out of the pans. I assumed it was because I used the tree pans, but yes it was very tough. So moist and dense that were you set the cake leaves a layer of cake. I had it all over my hands."
"1","5","This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! It is moist very very tasty. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great!"
"1","5","I made this substituting whole plain yogurt for the milk and 1/4 cup applesauce and a 1/4 cup oil for the 1/2 cup oil and it turned out delicious!!! I'm sure it is wonderful the original way too. This is definitely my go to recipe now! Wishing I would have found this recipe years ago!!! - Was also glad that I read the water makes it runny. I thought the batter looked the right consistency before the water and then after I added it I was a bit worried, but as stated by numerous reviewers before me, it turned out perfect!"
"1","4","omg so chocolaty and yummy. I did change things up, I added white chocolate chips into the batter and melted some white chocolate and used it as frosting... I needed a giant glass of leche"
"1","5","This was the easiest and best cake I ever made! I did made a couple changes. I used Coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used some black cocoa powder in with the regular cocoa. My oven is extra hot so it was done in 25 mins. Frosted it with a vanilla buttercream icing... And it was epic :)"
"1","5","Yummy in the tummy! Made these for my cousin's work party and they were gone in seconds!! I used coffee instead of water (always love the coffe/chocolate combo) and buttermilk instead of milk (had some leftover and wanted to use it up). I filled them with a little chocolate pudding and topped them with a cream cheese frosting! DELISHHHH!!"
"1","5","I made this cake for my son's birthday I have tried similar recipes so I took a risk and invited my in-laws, My mother in-law is very picky with food, and today she asked me for the recipe for this cake, she even had a second piece! (if you know her your mouth would drop), even my father in-law was surprised that she repeated on cake! we all loved it! if you tried it and didn't turn out good, you are doing something wrong, I always try the first time just as the recipe is asking for. I followed the directions exactly and viola! deliciousness! for the amount of work is well worth it! My in-laws already asked me to make it again for their friend's birthday. I made a Dark Chocolate ganache to go with it, that made it even better! Not a German chocolate cake but so much easy and still good! what else can I say? I liked it,"
"1","5","This cake is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have ever used. It is so moist and yummy. I love to cook and try new recipes all the time. I am hooked on this one though. Can't wait for an excuse to make it again."
"1","4","I agree with review from naples34102, black magic cake is more moist. I use peanut butter icing not chocolate. I also use cold black brewed coffee instead of water. This cake is better the second day. I did use the bake time for layer cake, my receipe is for a 9 x 13 cake pan."
"1","3","I was unable to get this cake out of a well greased and floured pan. Was Ok, but I've had better homemade chocolate cake."
"1","4","Seriously easy and delicious! Subbing the hot water for coffee really enhances the chocolate flavor!"
"1","5","I made this as a sheet cake, since I read a review that described this as a moist, pudding like cake. But I didn't find that it turned out that way and it actually comes out of the pan pretty clean so I think it would make layers just fine. I do find that I think it tastes better the next day, but it tasted great the day I made it, too. I used Hersheys dark chocolate cocoa and found a simple chocolate frosting recipe on this website so I completely got my chocolate groove on!"
"1","5","Great recipe. Not dry."
"1","3","I just made this cake but the middle sunk in.. I followed all the steps, is high altitude could be a problem? Need some help, it is a birthday cake..was..:("
"1","5","The best chocolate ever! I've using this recipe for many occassions. The most easiest cake to make!"
"1","4","Moist dark chocolate cake. Easy and quick to make."
"1","5","Rich, moist, and fluffy :) i altered it a bit because I can't leave anything well enough alone (yes, It's a disease). I substituted buttermilk instead of milk for extra moistness and hot espresso for the water. You can't taste the coffee in the final product, it just gives the chocolate some extra oomph. Very tasty."
"1","5","Baked this cake for b'day party yesterday. I reduced the sugar level by a quarter of a cup, baking soda and baking powder(by just a little bit) and less salt. Garnished it with fresh strawberries. What a cake it was! I added frosting too.My husband and teen soon can't seem to get enough of it. The guests loved it as well. Would make it again and again and again. So simple and took 15 minutes only. A good gift to take as well!"
"1","5","This is very easy but great recipe. The cake is moist and everything's just right, with great taste too."
"1","5","This cake is amazing! It's my go to recipe now for almost all occasions. This cake is so moist it doesn't even need frosting. A little advice though this cake is way to soft and moist to layer and go really heavy on buttering and flouring your pan"
"1","5","this is my 'go to cake' for the past two years! BUT, I always use 3 round pans because the first time I only used 2 pans and had an overflow mess! It makes a wonderful 3 layer cake, always moist and delicious."
"1","5","This recipe sounds very much like the one on the package of Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa...hmmm, I wonder? I have made that cake and it is great. Very simple and everyone who tries it says it is really good. I going to check it out..."
"1","5","AMAZING!!! I was a little scared because the mixture was very watery before placing in the oven, but it turned out super moist and tasty! I used a chocolate fudge icing and it tastes just like a dessert from a restaurant. Terrific!"
"1","3","I live at 8,000 feet elevation. This cake is delicious... but definitely not meant for high-altitude."
"1","5","Delicious and moist. Extremely runny, so don't use a springform pan, otherwise it will leak all over."
"1","3","bland, needs tons of frosting to make it sweet enough. I even added a tbsp of rum extract, but it didn't give it a richer flavor obviously."
"1","2","I tried to make this recipe many times and everyone gets such awesome reviews. I followed it exactly as the recipe says, but it always turns out flat, rubbery and hard.... I have no idea what I am doing wrong and I know it should turn out. I really want to get this recipe right because everyone is raving about it. This is my first 'one bowl' cake and I can never get it to work... can anyone tell me what could happen? Maybe I need to add more baking powder or.. I added too much water???"
"1","5","Fabulous cake, very moist! I did not make it as a two layer cake though, instead I just made one large cake and added about 10 minutes to the cooking time."
"1","5","I really like that this cake looked almost black as it came out of the oven, but was really springy and light. I made cupcakes: baked at 350 for 23 minutes, and mini cupcakes at 350 for 17 minutes. Perfect results. I paired this with the Rich Chocolate Frosting and together the cake tasted reminiscent of Wegman's chocolate cake, (which is the best on the planet). Next time, I want to try using buttermilk. Great recipe---thanks!"
"1","5","Loved it...especially the next day. Cake turned out moist & not too sweet. I was glad for the warning that batter would be thin/runny. Baked 2-9' round cakes. My only 'fail' was baking too long - I baked for 25 minutes but I think it was probably done at 20-22. I frosted with 'Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting' found here and OMG - it was delicious! Used the entire batch to frost cake. Great reviews from all who tried it. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","I made this cake for a baby shower and had rave reviews about how yummy it was. I did however up the cocoa to a cup as suggested and it was perfect. The only downer was that the corners were a bit over done using a 1/2 sheet pan and dident rise much, but made it easy for not having to trim any off the top. I will definitely make this again in a smaller pan. Tip on over cooked sides: make a thin sugar water mixture and use a pastry brush to brush on and then let sit a hour before icing. Works great to bring back the moisture! :-)"
"1","5","Delicious! Very good and easy to make. I did with a bundt cake mold and worked well. Also, I didn't even use a mixer, just hand stirred with spoon. Try topping with a chocolate genache for that extra chocolatey experience."
"1","3","OK... I am pretty darn good at baking, but what went wrong with this recipie?? The cake turned out super moist- not as chocolatey flavored as I would like... But holy cripes did it stick to my pans, and fell completly apart upon removal from the pans!!! I cooked it about 3 or 4 min. less than directed. I greased the rounds with crisco, and I dont know why it fell apart so easily... but I will definitly be trying a different recipie for choc. cake next time! But I do have to give the cake props for it's moist-ness. I pieced it together, let it cool- frosted it, and fed it to all the guys around the shop. Not pretty, but it did the job!It reminded me of a store cake- that you find in the coolers. TY!"
"1","5","This is so amazing. Incredibly easy to make, and so moist and delicious to eat! I went ahead and upped the cocoa to 1 cup, and it was perfect. I read a few reviews saying this was not good for layer cakes, but I didn't have a problem at all. I was, however, very careful. I cut out parchment paper circles for the cake pans, buttered/floured the sides of the pans well, and the layers popped right out. I also wrapped both layers in foil and froze them overnight for easy frosting the next day . The cake turned out perfectly, and with a simple vanilla buttercream frosting, it was the best birthday cake I've ever eaten. Seriously, my extended family gobbled it up. And did I mention that the batter is incredibly easy to make?? This recipe is a keeper for sure. Next up: Chocolate cupcakes for my son's third birthday party. Enjoy, all, and thanks!"
"1","5","This is my go to chocolate cake recipe, and I make alot of cakes! I use buttermilk and sub the water for extra strong coffee... everyone raves and I always get asked for the recipe!"
"1","5","BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER! It gives the right amount of moistness and yum. Few tips: If you can not have milk, believe it or not, grape juice is just the thing! I mean it!!!! Also, using 1 full cup of cocoa improves the taste.  I always use this recipe, it is the best!"
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"1","2","I did not care for this recipe. Didn't rise at all. I followed the recipe to a T...I don't know what went wrong but I won't be trying this one again."
"1","4","I am trying this now since we have a hurricane."
"1","4","This was really good. Not exactly moist but definitely not dry. I used a frosting recipe that was very thin and poured it over the cake. This worked perfectly to make it moist. I'm saving this as my go-to chocolate cake recipe."
"1","5","perfect chocolate cake. Quick and easy, and quick clean-up too"
"1","5","This.... is the best chocolate cake EVER. Moist, chocolatey and simple to make. I always receive lots of compliments when I make this cake. Tastes great with a simple chocolate or oreo whipped cream frosting. I line the pans with wax paper, it's simpler than greasing, and the cake always comes out of the pan perfectly. It takes about 45-50 minutes to bake in my oven, but all ovens are different. Also, I only add about 3/4 cup of water. My go-to chocolate cake recipe, I recommend anyone else to try it! :)"
"1","5","Turned out great. Loved how easy it was to put everything in one bowl. I took a tip to up the cocoa to 1 cup and it tastes great. Did mine in 9x13 pan for 35-40 min. and cupcakes for 15-20 min. Also made one with cocoa as called for, 1 cup of the flour was whole wheat, and substituted apple sauce for oil. This healthier version was also tasty; a little different but tasty nonetheless."
"1","5","This is such an easy delicious moist chocolate cake. A perfect birthday cake!!!! It worked well in a bundt pan, and looked very celebratory with just the right of vanilla ice cream on the top. I prefer to use brown sugar and buttermilk in my recipes and this one is definitely a keeper!!!!"
"1","5","I made cupcakes from this recipe and it's super chocolatey. If you don't enjoy chocolate or really rich flavor don't make it. It's amazing. I suggest adding more sugar than it says. I made a homemade caramel buttercream frosting that definitely made it so much better!"
"1","5","This cake was very easy to make. The lack of fuss is a big bonus in my tiny kitchen! But even better was the taste: rich, chocolate-y and incredibly moist (which it stayed!) I've always had terrible luck with cakes, but this came out perfect. So glad I found this recipe. Thank you!"
"1","5","Very moist and rich! It was very easy to make. The only changes I made was reducing the vanilla to 1 1/2tsp and 1/2 tsp of salt. I baked it in a 13x9 in pan for about 37 minutes. I iced it with a mint buttercream icing I made. It was fabulous!"
"1","5","I made cupcakes using this recipe (except I substituted organic unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil) and they came out so rich and moist! I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely be using it again. If you've never tried baking with applesauce in lieu of vegetable oil, I highly recommend it!!"
"1","5","I've been looking for a cake/cupcake that screams yummy and fudgy - and this is it! I look forward to trying all the toppings that will go with it! The only change I made was using Dutch cocoa instead of regular, yummy! Thanks Shirleyo!"
"1","5","Excellent cake. I made it in a 9x13 pan. This cake is SO moist, such a perfect texture, not too heavy, and not so light that it seems like a bought cake or a (aaagghhh) box mix, even three days after making it. It freezes very well. Will be making this again."
"1","4","I was incredibly skeptical of this cake. I knew that the batter would be thin, but after adding the cup of boiling water my batter was thinner than expected. I decided to trust the recipe and put it on the oven. My cake needed a little extra time to cook through, thanks to the runny batter. Removing the cake from the pan proved to be a challenge, as the cake was moist to the point where it did not want to stay together. When it came time to frost, I had to be incredibly careful not to pull apart the cake. It was a brilliant mess and the whole time I was cursing this demon cake. HOWEVER, when I finally served it, this cake got rave reviews. Everyone loved it, came back for seconds and thirds and requested the recipe. I even got a baking job offer! So, as much as this cake scared me, I'll definitely be making it again. It was worth it in the end!"
"1","3","I don't know why, but the cake tastes pretty salty. Make be cut down the salt next time."
"1","5","awesome chocolate cake! Even my husband, who doesn't care for chocolate, loves it! This is definitely my go-to recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious and moist, and hardly takes any time at all! I'll be using this recipe a lot in the future!"
"1","5","This cake recipe is the best ever!!! Easy, moist, deliciousness!!! You wont be disappointed..."
"1","5","I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but I had a craving. This cake is very moist and not overly sweet. I topped it with a chocolate buttercream frosting, which made it sickeningly sweet... just the way I like it!"
"1","5","This cake was fantastic! The first few times I made this cake, it stuck to the bottom of the pan because it was so moist. Put a piece of wax paper on the bottom of the pan and it comes out just fine. Be careful though, the batter gets really runny after adding the water, but it turns out wonderful."
"1","5","The family raves over this cake. It looks and tastes like an expensive bakery cake. I frost the center with chocolate buttercream frosting and spread a layer of warm chocolate ganache over that (ganache purchased at Whole Foods), then frost the whole cake with the choc buttercream frosting and pour warm choc ganache over the top until it drips down the sides then refrigerate it. It ALWAYS turns out - even the first time when I didn't follow the directions correctly -- I am not a seasoned baker whatsoever!! This cake is requested for family birthday cakes! It is so easy and beautiful and most of all it tastes fabulous."
"1","5","This is a GREAT chocolate cake recipe. I use a whole cup of cocoa. I have used it to make cupcakes, sheet cake, layer cake. Goes great with Peanut butter frosting and chocolate ganache."
"1","5","This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. It's a classic cake that everyone loves - just the right combination of moist and delicate. I use a chocolate or vanilla icing (the recipe on the back of the confectioner's sugar bag, lol) and it's always a hit. And there's only one bowl to clean! :)"
"1","5","hmmm..this is the best cake i ever had..!!!!! they are so good and moist like the bakery cake but, i feel that are somewhere much better than market cake mixes..1st time i tried, it turned out perfect..the batter actually becomes very thin when u add hot water, but just dont worry and go ahead with the exact measurements given in the recipe, they ill turn out the best..usually my huuby is not a fan of cakes but, this time he loved it soooo much..!!! I followed the same measurements, except the amnt of cocoa powder, i added half cup..next time am gona try with hot coffee just like others have mentioned in the reviews..This is the first time am writing a review, because i wanted to tell that this recipe is awesome..Thanks"
"1","5","YUMMY! I did use 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and paired this with the chocolate fudge buttercream frosting. SO good!"
"1","4","The flavor of this cake is delicious but mine turned out a little of the gooey side. I'd probably bake a little longer next time."
"1","5","Whenever I make chocolate cake, it's always this recipe because it comes out perfect every single time! People always love it and I get tons of compliments. It's so moist and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. It's also very easy and I don't think it's much more time consuming than a boxed cake mix. Do be careful though, I did not realize how much it would rise the first time and had overfilled cupcakes, so it's better to err on the side of caution when filling pans."
"1","5","This tasted excellent and had a light texture. I didn't change a thing and I topped it with chocolate powder sugar icing. My 7 year old daughter has already requested that I make the same cake for her birthday. So I will be using this recipe again!"
"1","5","OMG!!! Absolutely the best 'from scratch' chocolate cake recipe I have found in years!! No jell-o pudding mix, no boxed mixes included (drives me nuts when looking for scratch recipes!) - just fantastic texture/taste/chocolate density - everything! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! And it's a 'one bowl' too! Couldn't ask for more :o)"
"1","5","THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I'VE EVER MADE!!! Moist, decadent, truly delicious. I made a quarter slab although only used half the cake as I was making a small cube. The rest of the cake, I didn't even bother icing it, it was so good! I made it exactly as the recipe described, thanks for posting!!"
"1","4","this is a great chocolate cake recipe."
"1","5","Easy and my family loves it!!"
"1","5","I love this cake recipe. I make one small change, just for my taste. I use boiling coffee instead of the water. Gives a subtle richness. Though, I'd rate it 5 stars based on the original recipe, no changes made. It's perfect either way. It's the only chocolate cake recipe I use."
"1","5","I made this in one large cake pan... doubled the baking time... shape was perfect and it was soooo moist"
"1","5","I prepared that cake two days ago and it was great! I made it with strawberry cram, strawberries and chocolate - it was so Yummy :)"
"1","5","I made this cake today for my father-in-law's birthday and he gave it great reviews! I vegetarian so I used almond milk and I also used unbleached flour. It came out great! Easy to make, but it stuck to my pan. It may have been the pan, so I just had two separate cakes. It goes further that way. :)"
"1","5","Great recipe! I halved it and made mini-cupcakes for the kids. Even used almond milk instead of cow's milk because I didn't have any. Very good flavor, moist."
"1","5","Amazing chocolate cake! I've made this three times and it always turns out delicious! This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe."
"1","5","Topped with my own coffee frosting. Delicious!"
"1","5","SO MOIST AND PERFECTLY CHOCOLATEY! Changes made thanks to other reviewers: Up cocoa to 1 cup, 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup oil, and added 1 1/2 tsp instant coffee to boiling water before mixing in, baked in a 9x13 pan. Was looking to fill a late-night chocolate craving. This and the Rich Chocolate Frosting (8 servings) were perfect.  UPDATE: currently making cupcakes for my niece's 2nd birthday (no coffee this time), and for all the cupcake decorators out there, filled to 3/4 you end up with a heftily domed cupcake - more of a muffin shape. Will fill to 1/2 next time."
"1","5","Simple but nice and RICH RICH RICH!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious!!! I actually made this cake in a fluted 10' cake pan, baked for 40 min.. When it cooled I inverted cake onto a cake plate and cut into two equal layers. Then I spread my homemade cannoli filling (recipe included) on bottom layer and placed remaining layer on top. Drizzled with chocolate glaze. Refrigerate after making! This was amazingly delicious!!! I will definitely make again!   Homemade chocolate chip cannoli filling: 15 oz.container of ricotta cheese (drained), 2/3 cup powdered sugar (mix these 2 ingredients on med. till well-blended) add 1/4 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. amaretto. In seperate bowl whip 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream until thickened and soft peaks form, then fold into mixture. Fold in 4-5 Tbsp mini-choc. chips. Refrigerate for 1-2hrs."
"1","5","My family went nuts for this chocolate cake. Frosted with chocolate ganache which put it over the top. I made the cake on a Thursday night for a Saturday party. I was super moist even after a day and a half. I think you need to be a true chocolate lover, though. I am not that big of a fan so this was just too rich for me, but everyone else loved it!"
"1","5","I made this in a 9 by 12 sheet pan. I used 1 cup of cake flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, and added a tsp of espresso powder to the boiling water. I frosted with chocolate whipped cream frosting. It was a huge hit!"
"1","3","This was just a so so recipe honestly. I liked that it was pretty chocolatey but it wasn't very sweet or aromatic. The flavor was a bit saltier than I thought it should be. Like I said, I liked it but it was just ok."
"1","4","followed recipe exactly, was very moist with nice crumb but next time I would add a full cup of cocoa powder and also swap some coffee for the boiling water. But I will be making it again!"
"1","5","Heavenly! I made this with a cream cheese frosting, and had everyone at my son's birthday party thinking I was an amazing baker - gotta love that :) This cake was moist and luscious as promised. I don't normally love chocolate cake, but this one may have won me over."
"1","5","Best chocolate cake ever!"
"1","5","This cake was so perfect! It was moist and rich. I have had such a hard time finding a homemade cake recipe (mine always turn out dry) but I will be using this this one from now on."
"1","5","I give it 5 stars, but only if you let it set for a day. The first night I made it is smelled soooo much like the baking soda, it gave it an almost fishy smell. The next day however, it was AMAZING!"
"1","5","Awsome. added coffee instead of water & 1 cup of cocoa. Frosted wirh ganche frosting. Made it the day before, put it in the fridge overnight. brought it to room temp. (about 1hr) . Was wonderfull."
"1","5","I followed everything just as the directions said and it came out great. One of the best chocolate cake recipes I have use, plus I love how simple the method is."
"1","4","This is a quick and easy recipe...I used the suggestion of 1/4 cup additional cocoa powder and when looking for something a little richer even added 1 cup of freshly brewed coffee in lieu of the water... YUMMY!"
"1","5","Amazing chocolate flavor, moist and rich. I ended up baking the whole batch in a single, glass 9 x 13 inch baking pan in a convection oven. It turned out fine although the center sunk a bit. I frosted the cake w/ an Allreceipes butter based frosting using Hersey's Special Dark Cocoa, which was wonderful but definitely rich so I don't recommend eating without a nearby glass of old milk."
"1","5","best choc cake ever!"
"1","1","This cake fell into 3 different pieces per layer after I let it set. Putting it together and frosting it couldn't even save it. It crumbed worse than any cake I have ever made. It was dry, too. I followed the ingredients and method to the letter. I used King Arthur's Flour products. This was an expensive disaster."
"1","5","I followed the recipe except I used a half cup of sugar less than the recipe called for because I didn't have unsweetened cocoa. I also baked it in a 9 by 13 glass pan for 32 minutes. It was delicious and my family loved it!"
"1","5","I've made this cake twice and it's been a hit. The first one was exactly as written and it was great. The second time, I took another reviewers suggestion and increased the cocoa to 1 cup. I also added one cup of chocolate chips. I made it in a bundt pan. It took 40 minutes to bake. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper."
"1","5","I made this cake yesterday, and it was great. Dense and very moist. I changed it a little. I didn't have milk so I used half and half. I only had olive oil, so I used 1/2 cup of mayo instead. I swapped out the boiling water for freshly made hot coffee. Also I listened to other reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa. I made a buttercream frosting. Everyone loved it. I will make it again, and I will use all the changes I made."
"1","5","I think I've modified this recipe about as much as I can without doing anything illegal. This is what I've added: 1/4 tsp finely ground black pepper (really jazzes up the chocolate flavor!), a little cinnamon and cloves, 1/2 apple, finely chopped; handful of raisins, cocoanut, chopped walnuts. I also replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, and replaced some of the oil with 1 Tbsp of butter, and added extra cocoa. I let it bake a little longer because of the added fruit. Wonderful stuff."
"1","5","I made this cake for my daughter birthday, and it was sooo moist and decedent! It was a major hit! I will definitely be making this cake again! I will NOT change a thing, it was fabulous!!!"
"1","5","This was fantastic! I did up the 3/4 cup cocoa to 1 cup and served with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting recipe and it was a HUGE HIT!!"
"1","5","After burning my fiance's boxed birthday cake I was frantic to find a quick cake recipe. Turns out this is the best cake I have ever made! No more boxed cake for me! Thanks!"
"1","5","Delicious and moist!"
"1","5","I will NEVER buy another cake mix again! This was the most moist and delicious chocolate cake I have ever tasted and it was soooo easy! I even used freshly milled sprouted flour, raw sugar and raw cacao powder and NO ONE noticed!! It was devoured! I used a cream cheese frosting recipe and it went perfectly! The kids even tried to scrape the crumbs from the bottom of the 9x13. I'm glad there was a warning about the batter being very thin. If there hadn't been, I would have thought I had done something very wrong. It was extremely thin, but baked beautifully! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","I made this yesterday and it's reeaallllly good. Nice and moist, very chocolately. I used a basic buttercream frosting. My husband loved it and I'm actually eating a piece right now for breakfast. My Sunday morning treat. :)"
"1","5","So easy. Quality of ingredients is key."
"1","1","Honestly, the worst chocolate recipe ever. It was messy and caused a lot of effort for something totally not worth it. I was expecting a delicious, moist, lovely cake, but instead I got a horrible liquid of some sort. It didn't even taste eatable... not impressed at all. VERY disappointed."
"1","5","This cake is amazing! Very moist and chocolatey! I iced with a seven minute frosting and topped with mini chocolate chips. Delicious! Thank you!"
"1","5","fantastic and moist. I use this recipe for cupcakes all the time and they always turn out terrific and stay moist for several days."
"1","5","Very easy Very moist Very yummy!"
"1","5","As a veteran cake baker, it's hard for me to fathom how anything so simple made with all-purpose (not cake) flour could come out so tender, moist, and chocolate-y without the benefit of the science of the cake mix. I will make this recipe again and again. It is sooooo good. I made it exactly as written, though I might try that added 1/4 c of cocoa sometime. Highly recommend this recipe."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly (except I did up the cocoa powder to 1 cup, as per recommendations) and the cake turned out amazing! I took it to work for a colleague's birthday, and it was a huge hit. All my colleagues, who are Russians (I live in Moscow) were pleasantly surprised by my 'American' chocolate cake and said it's the first time they've enjoyed cake in a long time. This was the first time I have baked a cake, and I will definitely go back to this recipe. It was easy and delicious!"
"1","5","This is my new chocolate cake recipe. I made it for my boyfriends birthday and everyone was amazed that I had made it from scratch. They all loved it."
"1","5","Seriously awesome recipe! There is not one thing wrong with this cake! I made it exactly as stated and it is the most moist chocolatey cake Ive ever made!!! I make a cake at least once a month for work bdays and this will be THE cake I make from now on!! Seriously awesome!!!"
"1","5","I LOVE this recipe! Nothing added and nothing omitted and nothing substituted for a really good basic chocolate cake recipe. I look forward to using this to make my cherry chocolate, my orange chocolate, and etc. cakes. Thank you."
"1","4","This was a really good cake. To be perfectly honest though, it wasn't all that much better than a box mix. I used boiling coffee instead of water, and it didn't have a strong coffee flavor, which was good."
"1","5","Love this recipe. One of my old bosses was a fan of whiskey so I used half cup of water and a half a cup of whiskey. It was a huge success, more adult like cake. If you want a little extra kick add a small amount of whiskey to the chocolate icing.  Idea #2: make the chocolate cake, then make a white chocolate pudding and whipped cream topping. I added some mint to the whipped topping for the christmas holiday."
"1","5","The BEST from scratch cake recipe I've found yet."
"1","5","it was very nice chocolate cake - let it cool completly before you eat it  it tasted better on the second day"
"1","5","This is the most moist and amazing chocolate cake EVER! Super easy to make and tastes BETTER then the box cakes!"
"1","5","Very tasty! Had made them so many times and made some alternatives as well. Don't give me wrong, the original recipes is great as is. Instead of boiled water, I've added in 4 tsp. postom to the boiling water to enhance the chocolate flavor (I know some of you do it with coffee but I don't drink coffee so). I've also used same amount of mashed bananas in place of oil. Worked perfectly!! Sooooooo gooooood with chocolate frosting. Will definately make these again and again!"
"1","5","Everyone raved about this delicious recipe! I made cupcakes and topped them with whipped cream. Absolutely wonderful! I am making it in cake form again tonight! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This was moist and delicious. Much better than a box mix."
"1","5","if you like a dense, moist chocolate cake, this is the one for you. I use a full cup of cocoa powder and also add 1-2 tsp. instant espresso to the boiling water. I love vanilla but 2 tsp. may be a little too much (but i use mexican vanilla which tends to be pretty strong, so maybe that's the problem) :-)"
"1","5","My family loved this cake! I topped it with pecans and caramel sauce, what a treat!!!"
"1","5","I made this for my son's birthday cake. FANTASTIC! I used the recipe as written and the cake was extremely moist and rich. I got so many compliments (it was incredibly tasty with white buttercream icing). This is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe!  For cupcakes, 20 minutes is sufficient in the oven. They turn out wonderfully too!"
"1","5","Best chocolate cake ever! Not too rich, not too sweet, just right!!"
"1","5","Perfect recipe - make it all the time!!"
"1","5","I made this cake for my son's birthday and it got RAVE reviews. It is now definately my go to cake recipe. For frosting I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe. Fantastic!!! I let both sit over night as others suggested. You should know that it comes out rather small (I used a 9x13 inch pan) so if you have a lot of people coming, you should make two of these and then use frosting to frost them together."
"1","4","Good, quick, simple rock solid basic recipe. I had no problem with sinking - nice, dense, and moist. I did use coffee extract and a coffee/water mixture for added flavor. Ran out of powdered sugar and had to resort to canned stuff which was WAY too sweet (tip: do NOT use jarred cream cheese frosting - yeck). Next time will probably use a simple glaze."
"1","5","Delicoius! I made 24 cupcakes from this recipe and they tasted like devil's food from cake mix! The only change I made was using a full cup of cocoa powder. For cupcakes, bake at 400 degrees for 5 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees. This will help make domed tops (this recipe makes the batter spreads out instead of rise because the batter is so thin)"
"1","3","You know, I'm torn about reviewing this only because it got so many great reviews. I'll just give you mine and let you do with it what you will. I'm a pretty experienced baker and cook, and yet, my cake fell. I've never had a cake fall on me, ever. I didn't open the door, nothing mysteriously fell off the table on to the floor, Nothing - and these cakes fell. Ok, so moving forward... These cakes were almost like brownies. Nothing cake-like about them, really. The flavor was good, if you're looking for a cake brownie type flavor (which I was not) and the consistency is definitely not spongey like cake but thick and crumbly like brownie. To be honest, I wasn't all that impressed with this. I didn't make it because it was easy, I made it based on the reviews... and either I made a different cake than everyone else, or they just haven't had really great chocolate cake...lol. I gave three stars, reluctantly."
"1","5","Excellent!"
"1","5","Sooooo good and so moist. Best choco cake I think I have had. I agree with the other, bump up the cocoa powder to 1 cup."
"1","4","Great cake. If you are looking for a simple chocolate cake that is moist and YUMM, then this is good. It is kind of generic, but whatever, it is YUMM. I didn't have frosting, but the thick paste that you mix together here before you pour in the boiling water was a lot like frosting (I NOM-NOMed many globs of it), so I put some aside before adding the water. Mixed it with some 100% pure peanut butter and used that as frosting for the cake. So good."
"1","5","It's the perfect decorator's cake. It is perfectly moist and bakes flat every time."
"1","5","This, indeed, is a fantastic cake. It is really THE perfect cake, since it is easy, one-bowl and delicious. However, as another recent reviewer said, it is the Hershey's cocoa recipe that is on the can, and has been used for generations! My mother, who would be 102 yrs old by now, made this when I was a child! Try it with white icing for a delicious change; that's the way she always made it."
"1","4","I used a little bit more cocoa as other reviews suggested. I baked it in an small electric oven, but I opened the door when the cake was rising and the final result was more like a brownie, still good but not that fluffy."
"1","5","THIS IS PERFECT CAKE... SO MOIST AND EASY.. DONT BE ALARMED AT HOW THIN IT IS WHEN YOU POUR IT INTO THE PAN.. IT COMES OUT PERFECT.. NO HARD EDGES AND NO PUFFING UP IN THE MIDDLE."
"1","1","Just made this cake with my daughter and it didn't turn out well at all. Was dry and tough and I baked it for 30 minutes (the lower end of the time range the recipe suggests) - so I didn't overcook it based on the recipe. Maybe the time needs to be shortened. Very disappointed!"
"1","5","Absolutely Delicious!"
"1","5","This is just the easiest recipe and it is so moist and good. Second time I have made it and I don't feel the need to ever try another chocolate cake recipe. I did do a full cup of cocoa powder the second time and just as good. Now just to find a great chocolate frosting to top it."
"1","5","Oh my chocolatey goodness! Moist, fluffy, rich, and chocolatey. Just about peftect, you just need to pair with a great frosting (but not canned, this is too good!). I had a bit of a hard time getting it out of the pans without it breaking, so next time I'll definitely use parchment."
"1","5","It was delicious!! Perfect the way it was!!"
"1","5","This was the first cake I've ever made from scratch, and it turned out PERFECT!! I went exactly by the recipe and didn't change a thing. It was absolutely amazing! Soooo very moist! I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and used 2 heart shaped pans. He couldn't get enough of it!"
"1","5","This cake is amazing!! The only changes I made to this recipe were: increasing the cocoa to 1 cup and refrigerating the cake overnight. I have also used buttermilk in the place of the milk and I have replaced up to half of the oil with applesauce. This cake is amazing with a chocolate cream cheese icing. Enjoy!!"
"1","5","My favorite chocolate cake!"
"1","5","this has become my standard chocolate cake recipe. my whole family loves it, as well as all the guests who've shared it. i've done it iced, glazed, or just topped in powdered sugar.  i do agree, it tastes better with coffee in lieu of water, and the better the cocoa, the better the flavor! love, love, love this cake!"
"1","5","Excellent cake. I thought I would try a trick I saw on TV and use cocoa in the greased pan instead of flour but it stuck a little. Next time I'll use flour. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe."
"1","5","This is now my chocolate cake recipe, and none other. My grandma thought I had made this with expensive real chocolate and not cocoa. Everyone who has had some, loves it."
"1","5","Delish! Always requested by co-workers. Like others, I used 1 cup of cocoa and added 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder to the batter. I baked in a 9 x 13 for 40 minutes.   I iced with the recipe below. Can't find the original source, it could have been from another reviewer. The icing also gets rave reviews when I served with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III. ICING: 1/2 cup butter or margarine  1/4 cup milk  3 tablespoons baking cocoa  3 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  Melt margarine, mix all others and pour over warm cake."
"1","5","This is excellent!"
"1","5","Made this for my 11 yr olds birthday. It was perfect. Made as is, no tweaks. I was skeptical about the thin batter, but perfect for a good solid chocolate cake recipe. We don't like our cakes super sweet, but this was moist, and excellent! Thank you for sharing."
"1","4","This is a VERY easy, VERY chocolaty cake. It's the best recipe I've come across so far for a basic chocolate cake. It's moist and yummy. I was really worried because it cooked over the sides of my pans (used the 9' as stated), but I trimmed the layers up and it frosted beautifully. I made a chocolate buttercream frosting with a white chocolate filling. Too chocolatly for me, but my daughter requested it for her birthday."
"1","5","there cannot be a simpler cake to make! and t is super delicious. as many others noted, the thin batter is a bit alarming, but it bakes up incredibly. i did mine in a 9x13 and it was so perfect. i literally had no time to make a cake, and this one was about 7 mins to mix up. 35 mins in the oven. no time to frost, so i cut a stencil of a pine tree, and dusted a generous amount of powdered sugar over the cake. it was a huge hit. ****** i used a full cup of cocoa, a tad more oil, and of course an extra teaspoon of vanilla!******** I will not buy a cake mix again. i already memorized this recipe, and loooove it!"
"1","5","I made this for my friend's birthday and she was thrilled. It is so easy to make, I will be making it over and over."
"1","5","This was fantastic! It was so rich that next time I'm going to make chocolate whipped cream and frost with that to let the cake texture and flavor shine through! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","This is really good cake.... I did alter the recipe though. 1-1/2 sugar. 1 cup of good cocoa powder. 1-1/4 tsp of baking powder. 1-1/4 baking soda. 1/2 tsp of salt. After reading alot of the views of being salty and other stuff wrong with it---mine came out JUST GREAT----I love it. I put homemade chocolate frosting on it tooo.... Yes I will make this again.... Thank you all recipes"
"1","5","My family and I loved this cake! It was the first cake I had ever attempted to make from scratch and it was delicious! It was very moist and had just the right amount of chocolate. They asked me to never make another chocolate cake from a box again, from now on use this recipe!"
"1","5","Absolutely the best made-from-scratch chocolate cake I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out so flavorful and so moist! I baked mine in a bundt cake pan for about 50 minutes and it was perfect."
"1","5","This was just delicious! I baked it in a bundt pan and dropped in about a half cup of choc chips before baking. They sunk to the bottom and made a nice frosting replacement. I also dusted the cake with a little cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. I used whole wheat pastry flour and my family couldn't even tell. I can't wait to try this recipe and make an upside down german choc cake."
"1","5","Quick, easy and tasted great....very chocolaty"
"1","5","This was my first 'bake a cake' ever and all I can say is I made a great impression =0) . Thank you for sharing...definitely one of the best cake recipes!"
"1","5","This is seriously the best chocolate cake recipe! It's super, super easy to make. It's quick. It's moist! At first you might freak out at how runny the batter is, but it comes out perfectly. I used this recipe for my friend's wedding cake and everyone LOVED IT! great job!"
"1","5","Fantastic!! So light and fluffy, and sweet but not overpowering. I topped it off with a rich Coconut Pecan frosting, and it was excellent. Will never reach for another boxed mix again. Thanks so much for this recipe!"
"1","3","i used this for cupcakes and i don't recommend it. they rose, but were kind of gummy around the edges and stuck to my muffin pan. the cake is very soft,moist in the middle but dry on the outside. it was very hard to pour it into the cupcake wells because the batter was so watery. it would probably be ok for the 2 9' round pans as long you have a really yummy frosting!"
"1","5","Wow, this is so SIMPLE and beyond DELICIOUS!!! Made cupcakes and they turned out perfect:)"
"1","5","oh my goodness. this is the best chocolate cake i have ever made!!!! i did modify one thing, i upped the amount of cocoa to one cup as a few reviewers suggested because i simply LOVE chocolate. I think this still would have tasted great w/out the increase and still would have deserved 5 stars tho. thus my rating of 5 stars. I do highly reccommend increasing the cocoa, as i did, for any chocoholics out there cause it sent me into chocolate heaven. hands down best chocolate cake ever"
"1","5","This is the best Chocolate Cake I have ever had. I plane to make this cake again for my daughter's 5th Birthday. Thank you for the great recipe."
"1","5","Awesome!! My husband isn't a fan of chocolate cake, but he sure liked digging into this one. However, I did increase the cocoa amount to 1 cup, but all I had was the No Name Brand, and it was wonderful."
"1","5","Amazingly delicious and super easy. I sprinkled chocolate chips on top as another reviewer suggested. Tastes great the same day, tastes even better the next day after being refrigerated. Add a scoop of ice cream and you have a perfect dessert. My family could not get enough."
"1","5","turned out v moist n chocolately..as others suggested i put 1 cup of cocoa n put 2 tsps of instant coffee to the boiling water!def a keeper.the cake turned out just like betty crocker chocolate fudge cake!!excellent!"
"1","4","this is super simple and great as cupcakes (actually that's all i use it for). a batch will do about 25 - fill them 3/4 full and bake about 13 mins."
"1","5","Excellent! Moist and chocolaty, but not too chocolaty. Wonderful recipe!"
"1","4","My 12 year old and 9 year old had no trouble baking this delicious cake. It is very moist and my only suggestion is a big dolop of cream or ice cream to top it off!"
"1","5","Extremely moist cake! Love the simplicity of only using one bowl to make this cake. Don't be afraid that the batter is really thin."
"1","5","Best chocolate cake I have EVER had. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!!!"
"1","5","Best chocolate cake (well, I made cupcakes) I've ever made. I did substitute a box of chocolate instant pudding for some of the sugar, since some people said they used more cocoa powder. Not sure if that made any difference or not. I also realized too late that I was out of vanilla, so I didn't use extract. I haven't made any frosting yet, I froze them for a bridal shower this weekend."
"1","5","I was kind of nervous ot make this cake, but I am glad I did. I followed the directions to an exact. The cake turned out perfect. Mosit and not too chocolatey. The cake batter after you add the water is very thin. I thought I had messed up. But it turned out perfect. For something so easy it is great!"
"1","4","Easiest cake to make ever! Not a big fan of cakes that use oil but this one was good!"
"1","5","Wonderful cake! I am dreadful at making cakes but got rave reviews using this recipe. I topped with vanilla cream cheese icing and decorated with strawberries which was delicious. The texture continues to improve in the fridge over night and even the day after that. Thank you!!!"
"1","5","Beware of altitude. I am in Colorado and my first attempt fell. So I used 1/4c less sugar and only 1t of baking powder. I also added an extra spash of milk. Then it turned out and it was wonderful."
"1","4","i found that the longer you keep it in the fridge the more flavor it has! yum!"
"1","5","It is fast to make. It turned out lovely. I used more coco, and will use 1 1/2 cups or 2 cups next time b/c I want it really chocolately. Thank you for this recipe!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe! A very decadent cake that is super easy to make. Thank you!"
"1","5","I cut this recipe in 1/2 to make sure it was GOOD first (& We have a small family). It is EXCELLENT. I mean: not okay, not good, not yummy - it's excellent! Yes it is a thin batter when you add the water, but it is so airy & fluffy and moist, it is a true KEEPER! Believe the reviews! :)"
"1","5","This is the cake everyone asks for for their birthday. Friends, family, their friends, their families! I can make this cake while helping with homework and making dinner at the same time because its easy doesn't leave me a huge mess to clean up. I have used chocolate milk, instead of regular. And I always throw in 2 grated squares of semi-sweet baking chocolate to any chocolate cake I make. Have to make sure the migraine I'll get from eating this is totally worth it :)"
"1","5","This was fabulous tasting and so moist. No more boxed cakes for me!"
"1","5","Great and easy, no changes needed."
"1","4","the flavor in this cake was very good, and it was very moist. super moist, almost too moist, like many of the other people on this site have pointed out. i added a spoon of blueberry jam which was nice too, and at the time i only had chocolate milk on hand. and yes the batter was veeeery thin! is that why the cake kinda... caved in? it didnt poof up. instead it spilled over the edge of the pan and made a huge mess..."
"1","3","This is the recipe you find on the back of Nestle Cocoa powder. It was a bit disappointing to find an unoriginal recipe on here, but I guess it does work to make a pretty good chocolate cake"
"1","5","This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. I put it all in an angel-food pan and baked it for 12-15 min longer, then made peanut-butter icing!"
"1","5","This is a ridiculously moist cake....almost too moist (if there is such a thing). Very easy to make, and tastes rich and delicious. I did increase the cocoa to one cup, as others have done. I also added some mint extract to the mix and frosted with a vanilla icing that I added several drops of green food coloring to (turned out a nice, minty pastel green color). Took this to a dinner party and it was a huge hit. This recipe is very versatile; I'm sure I'll use it again. Might bake a tad bit longer next time, though."
"1","5","I was looking for a good chocolate cake mix to make cupcakes and this nailed it. Not too dense, not too light, not too sweet or chocolaty. Just right! I topped this with a wonderful and equally easy vanilla buttercream frosting (3 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup butter - mix for 3 minutes, add 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon whipping cream - mix an additional minute). I will definitely be making this again."
"1","5","Turned out incredible! Very soft and moist. It was a hit at my party and when I shared some with my landlord several days later she said it was the best cake she had ever eaten!"
"1","5","Delicious. I upped the chocolate, like many reviews said to do, and add 1 tsp. peppermint extract for one of the tsp. of vanilla. Perfect mint chocolate cake. I also made these into cupcakes. Bake for 18 min."
"1","4","first chocolate cake recipe i have tried from this site, i was pleased with it. i made it for my daughters second b day. it was kind of like a brownie to me."
"1","5","Very very moist. I don't think it would be a good cake for shaping. got nothing but fave reviews, even my boyfriend didn't believe I made this from scratch! I used rich chocolate frosting found on this website and it worked very well! Anyone who likes chocolate should try this cake!"
"1","5","The best chocolate cake recipe EVER! So moist and easy to make - will always use this when i want a choc cake"
"1","5","This is THE BEST from scratch cake I have ever tasted. I have tried a TON from this site and love them all for the most part but this one takes the cake! Pun intended. I made exactly as written and it was SO simple. I was SHOCKED at how moist and chocolatey this cake turned out. I WILL keep this one as my chocolate cake recipe from now on. Box mixes won't be around much longer with this easy recipe!! LOVE IT THANK YOU!"
"1","5","Very easy and super moist! I love that everything is mixed in one bowl - so much faster. I followed the recipe as is and I will definitely be using this one again."
"1","3","I have not yet tried this recipe, however, when I do, I will most likely...substitute buttermilk or lite sour cream for the milk (or 1/2 and 1/2 of both); add some Bailey's, and either semi-sweet or mint chocolate chips...wanted to write to answer some of the requests. It does appear to need other flavors."
"1","5","This was my very first, honest to god, homemade dessert and I'm glad it was because it was a great experience. Very easy to make, so moist and delicious. I made a two layer 9' round cake and it weighs a ton compared to box cake! It was so well liked by friends and family that in a week, I was asked to make three. Thanks for this!"
"1","4","Make sure you prepare the pan properly, I used Wilton Cake Release. Very good taste and easy."
"1","4","This cake was really good. Not as moist as some users said, but it was delicious. I made a bundt cake with the recipe then used a mint-chocolate frosting. Together they were bennismo!"
"1","3","Not a bad chocolate cake, but boring. Not much more exciting than a boxed mix."
"1","5","This cake was AWESOME I had so many people ask me for the recipe that I had to come back to rate it . I would give this more stars if I could. It came out moist and Delicious ."
"1","5","I have no idea how anyone can gripe about this cake. It is without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I did the recommended substitutions (applesauce for oil, 1 cup cocoa, less sugar) and I made a sourcream frosting to go on top and it was divine. People at the party I brought it to raved and raved about it. I can't wait for another occasion to make it again."
"1","5","Add some whip cream and chocolate fudge to a slice of this cake...Decadent!!!"
"1","5","Really good, simple and fast! An easy recipe to alter, as well. Good consistency with basic pliable ingredients. Can easily be made into a 'gourmet' cake with a few tweaks. I opted for replacing half the milk with yogurt, it adds moisture. Used 1 1/2 cps flour instead and only 1/4 cp hot water. I also added 2 tbs. of port. Lastly, used melted margarine instead of oil. I only had a bundt pan and it worked fine! The result had the rich tang of dark chocolate and it was VERY moist! A new family favorite! I will make again at the drop of a hat!"
"1","5","Super moist. Super chocolaty. Super yummy. Super WOW! I made these as cupcakes for my son's birthday and they were a hit. I cut the time in half at 17 minutes. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. I filled them w/bavarian cream and topped them off with buttercream frosting. A must keep recipe."
"1","5","Moist, not too dense, easy to make, fast and delicious. I made this cake for my son's birthday and topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site. It was perfect. He couldn't stop eating it."
"1","5","This cake was delicious! I made it for my nephews 5th birthday party and it was a huge hit. Everyone thought it tasted great. The cake came out very moist and had great flavor. I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the cocoa to 1 cup and let it settle in the fridge for a day. I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","Easy to make and came out AMAZING. I cooked it the 30 minutes and it was already cooked fully. With a buttercream chocolate icing it tasted delicious. I'll be using this again :D"
"1","5","i used 1 full c cocoa powder and made it in a 13x8 pan. i also used cocoa powder instead of flour to dust the pan. i will definitely make this again. what an easy and inexpensive dessert to make w/ ingredients i always have on hand"
"1","5","This cake was great! The only thing I did differently was add & dissolve 1 tsp instant coffee crystals to vanilla before putting in bowl. Don't think it made any difference (but have heard adding coffee crystals can bring out more of a chocolate flavor--per food network). Otherwise I made this recipe as stated, with two 9' pans. Baked 30 min, was enough for my oven. I added Duncan Heinz chocolate buttercream frosting to it--it was moist, tasty, and chocolaty--what more could a chocoholic ask for! Will recommend this recipe. Looks like Hershey had a great recipe. Thanks for sharing! Oh, I was going to add chocolate curls to top of cake but realized I was out. I added crushed chocolate graham crackers, which sounds odd but worked for presentation purposes."
"1","5","I cut this recipe in half, and made 12 cupcakes. The only modifications I made were using half whole wheat flour, olive oil, and skim milk. These cupcakes were AMAZING! Moist, light, and you couldn't taste the whole wheat at all, so it was a nice way to make them a bit healthier."
"1","5","This is a very delicious cake. My family has been enjoying the very same recipe for more than 30 years. It's the one printed on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can. 'Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake.' The frosting recipe, also printed on the can, is equally amazing."
"1","5","Awesome chocolate cake! The only changes I made was I used boiling coffee instead of water and I used a 9X13 pan. Instead of greasing and flouring the pan, I greased and sugered the pan. Gives it a nice sweet outside."
"1","5","made this yesterday for a work function. my boss loved it! made it exactly except i used coffee instead of water. also topped it w/ a condensed milk/choc. chip frosting"
"1","5","THE EASIEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I HAVE EVER MADE... IT TASTE AWESOME, BUT FOR ADVICE BAKE IT A DAY BEFORE AND PUT IT ON THE FRIDGE IT WILL TASTE MUCH BETTER THE NEXT DAY.... TRUST ME"
"1","5","this cake is the best chocolate cake i've ever tried in my life--and the best part is i got to take credit for making it! wow, isanely good! i added some more cocoa and a dash of instant coffee--baked it and iced it with bailey's flavored buttercream and dark chocolate mousse for the outside. so good i actually trembled."
"1","5","Delicious! I didn't change a thing and though I was initially concerned about the thinness of the batter, it baked beautifully. My visiting friend ate four of these (I made them into cupcakes) in under two minutes. I will definitely be making this again."
"1","5","UPDATE 2: MY FRIEND LOVED THIS!!! UPDATE: AS B POWELL SUGGESTED (GREAT IDEA!), I MADE UP A BATCH OF DRY CAKE INGREDIENTS - BUT NOT FOR MYSELF! I SENT IT (WRAPPED WITH RAFFIA IN A HOLIDAY GOODIE BAG) W/ DIRECTIONS (PRINTED ON HOLIDAY LETTERHEAD) AND A BASIC VANILLA FROSTING RECIPE, A BOTTLE OF MADAGASCAR VANILLA (FROM MY LOCAL SPICE SHOP) AND A JAR OF PEPPERMINT SNOW (FROM WILLIAMS-SONOMA). MY FRIEND LOVED IT!!! :-) Yummy cake! It's my fiance's Bday today. His favorite cake is chocolate with vanilla frosting, so I decided to give this recipe a try, frosting with Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting (also on this site). I've never made a cake from scratch before (not that I can't, I just don't have the time to... lol!) - this recipe proved to be INSANELY easy, quick and economical (most well-stocked pantries will have all of the ingredients on hand). It's SUPER moist, layers well (I made a two-layer cake) and has just the right amount of chocolatiness (IMHO). Although nothing can beat the convenience of a boxed mix, this is a great substitute. B. Powell's suggestion to whip up a second batch of ingredients in a Zip-lock bag for later is genius (thanks!). Next time, I think I will use a full cup of cocoa and possibly substitute 1 c. coffe for the water. I would have never guessed that this was a Hershey's recipe (and I even used Hershey's cocoa!). Great recipe, shirleyo! :-)"
"1","5","Excellent, excellent, excellent. Didn't change any ingredients. So moist and flavourful! I doubled this receipe and made a large triple-layer chocolate cake for an equally large birthday gathering. It went over extremely well."
"1","5","Everyone Loved it. This was the first 'real' cake I've made and it was great."
"1","4","Moist and yummy! This was very easy to make."
"1","5","DANG! So good. I used Buttercream Icing recipe from this site to frost."
"1","4","Really moist, and not too sweet... but if u r looking for CHOCOLATELY, this is not ur cake... another suggestion: use less milk and just 1 tsp of bakins soda, 'cause it left a little bitter flavor at the end."
"1","5","Wonderful! It tastes even better the next day!"
"1","4","I followed all of the directions to a T. It fell in the middle and got a hard crunchy top on it. It still has a very good taste!"
"1","3","Very quick and easy. Definitely not the best cake ever but it's good. Tastes similar to a boxed cake mix."
"1","5","easy and delicious but trust me when I say it needs more cocoa I added a whole cup the second time because the first time it was so moist and delicious but needed more cocoa flavor. Maybe it's the brand I add but ADD MORE COCOA!"
"1","5","This recipe made the perfect chocolate cake!"
"1","5","Incredibly fast and simple to make, perfectly moist and delicious. The recipe is resilient, too -- I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa, subtracted 1/4 cup of sugar, and substituted half whole-wheat flour, and it worked out great. Excellent with 7-minute frosting."
"1","4","this is a great basic chocolate cake. I have made this a few times, the only thing I have done diff. is increase the cocoa. thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","This is THE BEST chocolate cake recipe. Everyone raves about it, and it's SO simple! I made cupcakes with it, and baked them @325 for 15 minutes. I will not use another chocolate cake recipe, this one is 'it' for me."
"1","5","This is the best chocolate cake ever! I was a little nervous because I had to make it dairy-free (with a soy-butter chocolate frosting) and it turned out fabulous! It's the kind of cake that would be wonderful even without the frosting. And super easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","This was an awesome recipe! My fiancÃ© said it was the best chocolate cake he had ever tasted. I made this for my birthday because I needed something to whip up quickly since company was coming in less than 2 hours. I did not even frost it, just ate it with whipped cream served on the side. Delicious!"
"1","5","Very tasty. Easy to prepare. Came together very nicely. Followed directions exactly. Maybe next time I will alter it a little. I have some hazelnut oil I've been wanting to use up. Sounds yummy either way. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe."
"1","4","Easy, quick, and on the 'healthier' side of typical chocolately desserts! I made two dozen cupcakes, and the batter amount was just about right (maybe slightly more than I needed). I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cup with no issues. If you have instant espresso or instant coffee on hand, add 1-2 tablespoons of it to the mixed batter (or you can add to the hot water, I assume.. but I hadn't thought of it at that moment yet).. it does wonders for enhancing the chocolate taste! I also made sure to sift all of the dry ingredients for a lighter cake texture. The one bowl aspect of this recipe is a major winner, but you also get fantastic results - so it's not like you're sacrificing quality for quantity at all! I baked my cupcakes for 22 minutes (my oven runs a bit hotter than the dial states - so the toothpick test is essential at the 20 minute mark), and they were good. I could have gone a little bit less, too. I frosted with a little bit of pink buttercream frosting (tinged with almond extract), and it gave it great depth of flavor. And I just love that dark brown/pink color combo. :) I've posted a picture! One more thing: I ate one right after frosting them, and they were slightly dry. Put them in the fridge, in an air-tight container overnight.. and the next day, they become totally moist - especially at room temp! So, this only gets better with time. :) Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
"1","4","This cake was very moist, and I took the advice of another reviewer to add a tsp of instant coffee to the boiling water. All in all a great chocolate cake!"
"1","5","The cake was very moist and delicious. My father said it was the best chocolate cake he has ever had."
"1","4","someone used a tube pan so I tried that, I now have a drippy gooey mess all over the bottom of my oven. not worth the mess"
"1","5","oh man this was good. so rich too. i did what others recommended and used a full cup of cocoa powder. like another reviewer had experienced my cake came out as flat as it was when it went in, it tasted fine just didnt rise. i then found out my baking powder had expired before the exp date."
"1","5","This is an excellent cake. I have been making it for years from the back of Hershey's Cocoa with rave reviews! It always makes a hit and is the first dessert gone at any gathering!"
"1","3","I fully agree with mom2hhh; the cake came out rather 'normal' or bland in taste as it tasted just like any ordinary chocolate cakes! I followed recipe closely, only decrease baking soda to 1 tsp instead of 1 Â½ tsp as I do not want my cake to taste like too 'chemicalâ ' and added 2 tsp of instant coffee into the cup of boiling water just to bring out the chocolaty taste better as advised by others (even double check with Hersheyâs site in advance just to ensure I did right). I was disappointed that the cake came out dry externally as it lacks the moist like 'Too Much Chocolate Cake' from this site. This is out of our recipe box and I'll revert to 'Too Much Chocolate Cake' from now on. A 3-star for cake taste and 5-star for its simplicity as you can whip out this cake in no time."
"1","2","This didn't work for me. It came out flat.... I mean really flat! It was only about 1' thick (didn't rise at all). I had wanted a 'dense' type cake - but this came out more dense than even brownies. All I can figure is I must have done something wrong - but in going over it several times, I just can find my mistake. Glad it works for most everyone else. Wont be re-trying this one. I'll go back to the recipes that include sour cream and pudding."
"1","5","As others have said, this is the Hersey's recipe for chocolate cake. That being said, this is a good one! The cake comes out really moist and flavorful - I even left out the vanilla by accident, which I can't believe considering I'm a vanilla fuh-reak! Great, great cake - and I'm not even that big on chocolate cake. No more boxed cake mixes for me!"
"1","5","seriously...best chocolate cake recipe ever. so moist, and not too sweet. i used a chocolate buttercream icing from this site and it was absolute heaven. my hubby, who is ever the critic, actually told me i should open up a dessert house with a cake this good."
"1","5","This was fantastic. I, like many other people, was a little scared after adding the water. But the cake was great! I actually made cupcakes, and it made 24 overflowing cupcakes. They tasted so good. Rich and fluffy all at the same time. I frosted them with my favorite chocolate frosting recipe and everyone in my family loved them. Next time I want to pipe cream into the middle of them!"
"1","5","it was incredibly easy and the best cake I have ever had. It is because of this that I have been named the master of cakes within my household."
"1","5","This cake is very good and really easy to make. I've made it twice now and both times it's been kind of fragile (falling apart easily while cutting), but sitting overnight after being frosted seemed to help the rest of the cake stay together. The second time, I increased the cocoa to 1 cup. The extra chocolate flavor was d'lish! :> Definitely keeping this recipe around."
"1","5","Excellent cake, the only problem is it is so rich you need to make sure you take a small piece or you won't be able to finish it!"
"1","5","this cake is so moist and is yum. I use a old time frosting. try it NOW. perfect for kids. I made it for my kids birthday and she loved it. But she is a picky eater so I was happy. I make it all the time now. It is just wonderful"
"1","4","This is fairly tasty, would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. I made it as the recipe says, but used Splenda as I didn't have sugar on hand. It didn't seem as watery as I would have thought by other reviews. In fact, prior to adding the water, it was so thick that it 'crawled' up to the belly of my mixer, almost more like a brownie consistency, but even thicker. Alone, it tastes kind of bitter, which could possibly be the Splenda. It was a rather dense cake, but definitely moist. I iced it with about 1/2 container store bought milk chocolate icing mixed with a small container of regular cream cheese. That combination was very good with the cake. Overall, quite tasty but not sure I would make again due to the bitterness."
"1","5","This recipe was very easy, and what a great, moist cake!! For chocolate lovers, you wont be disappointed!! I made it with a bundt pan and cooked for about 40 minutes... will use this again!!!"
"1","5","After trying the too much chocolate cake recipe from this site and a recipe from a well known chef, this recipe came out the best in that it's springy, moist and fluffy. Although I'm a chocoholic I might not be a big fan of chocolate cakes making it very difficult for me to find a chocolate cake recipe that strikes me as out of this world. This recipe will become my current staple until I find another recipe that's more chocolatey and distinct."
"1","5","This is so easy to make. My family is constantly wanting me to bring it to all of our gatherings, and i am not usually the one who cooks at all!"
"1","5","Awesome flavor and high marks for simplicity! This is as easy as a box mix, but way tastier :)"
"1","5","I made cupcakes instead of a cake and baked the cupcakes for about 15-20 minutes. It turned out really good! I followed other reviewers and added more cocoa powder. I also substitute one cup of fresh brew coffee for one cup of water to add more flavor (personal preference). If you like dark chocolate, this is a way to go!"
"1","5","This is the PERFECT chocolate cake. I made in two 10'pans and cooked for 30 minutes. Make sure you grease and flour pretty liberally, as sticking was a little bit of an issue. I followed this recipe exactly, pairing it with the 'Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting.' It was to die for -- I had several people tell me it was the best chocolate cake they had ever eaten. Likewise, non cake-eaters were even scarfing it down. As suggested by some, I made this the night before and let the cake sit overnight; I took it out 20 minutes before serving and it was just perfect. Thanks for a great recipe :)"
"1","5","This cake is amazing! I have used it soo many times! I have also altered it to make an almond cake and a lemon cake. I substituted the cocoa for cake flour (which gave it a very spongy texture) and added lemon juice and grated lemon peel in place of the vanilla. I also used the cake flour and almond extract for the almond cake....AMAZING!!!"
"1","5","This cake was very rich and chocolately!!! I made this for a birthday party and everyone had a nice big slice! I covered it in chocolate icing... Mmmmm I used 1 cup of hot espresso instead of hot water - thats the only thing I changed :)"
"1","5","thanks for this great recipe...so easy to prepare... and indeed perfect for cupcakes too! cheers!"
"1","2","I bake. I bake a lot. I followed the recipe exactly and I was a little concerned at how thin the batter was. I made this into cupcakes. It made 27 cupcakes. 27 cupcakes that I only filled 2/3 full but they still overflowed and ran flat onto the top of my muffin tins and then stuck there. I had to tear the tops off which makes for pretty fugly cupcakes. They taste alright, but the edges of the tops were a little chewy where they overflowed. I usually make 'Barb's Chocolate Cake' off this site and that one rocks, so I don't know why I deviated. Oh well. I made some kick butt white chocolate mint frosting though! I'm going to post that recipe. It's deee-lish on chocolate cupcakes."
"1","5","UPDATE: This recipe is the exact same one from a Hersheys cookbook. *** Made this exactly as stated. They weren't kidding when it says the batter will be runny after adding the boiling water. I'm glad I saw that or I would have been worried. I put a mug of water in the microwave for 2 minutes for the boiling water. Whether or not it boiled I have no idea as I didn't watch it but it was hot enough. This cake was amazing. Very spongy and airy and light. Definitely make sure to grease the pan(s) enough. I used a bundt pan and it worked perfectly. Also make sure to let it cool for the 10 minutes- otherwise it may not come out of the pan completely. I will never again buy cake mix (thank goodness!) from a box again! Very quick and easy to make! Thanks ever so much!"
"1","5","This recipe is amazing. It turned out perfect! Separated from the pan with ease and was really moist and dense. I'll definitely be making this one again. It goes GREAT with the Taste of Home frosting recipe on this site: 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' submitted by Amy Via."
"1","5","I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I've made this cake several times, and each time it came out delicious! I followed recommendations to make it 1 cup of cocoa and used Ghiradelli cocoa powder and it is fantastic. It's very moist and chocolatey. The first few times I used duncan hines frostings but I've also used a buttercream frosting and it tastes amazing. I also made this cake with a strawberry filling and covered it with chocolate ganache and it turned out absolutely gorgeous and delicious!The most recent time I made them, I made mini cupcakes and baked them for 13 minutes at 350. Half the batter is enough to make a little over 36 of them but make sure to fill it up ONLY 3/4 of the way because they rise a lot! Thanks for this recipe! Absolutely amazing!! :)"
"1","5","I dont usually rate recipes but I had to with this one. This cake was FANTASTIC! Super moist and chocolaty. Like other reviewers, I used a full cup of cocoa and it came out perfect."
"1","5","Love this! Baked up beautifully. As everyone has said, batter is thin but the cake turns out fabulous; trust the recipe!"
"1","4","This cake was definitely as easy as it claimed to be. I made this for the bottom tier of a three tier wedding cake. I used different liquors in each cake, and in this one, instead of vanilla, I used a little more then a tablespoon of Kahlua. It was very moist, and sturdy, as well. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","this cake was incredibly easy, so it scores mega points for me - my two and a half year old did all of the measuring and stirring, if that says anything. i thought it tasted good, not great. it has a similar texture and flavor to a boxed mix. not that that is a bad thing, i just think that a cake from scratch should be a bit richer than what you would buy in a box. i frosted it with a butterscotch frosting and i loved the combination."
"1","5","I made this for my son's 17th bday for the family and this was fantastic. My son is a amateur pastry chef and I was worried about his critical taste buds; no worries here! Amazing!! This cake does get better and better with time in the fridge."
"1","4","Great recipe for chocolate cake! I used a recipe on this site for frosting: Rich Chocolate Frosting. The cake was very moist and turned out wonderful."
"1","5","I have to say this is amazing! Fast and delicious! Others mention changing the amount of cocoa powder. Here's the scoop: if you are using high quality cocoa, you can definitely reduce it. If you are using regular hershey's cocoa, you can increase it up to 1 cup. But remember, it's still personal preference as to how rich you like your cake and what you plan to top it with. I recently served it frosting free with vanilla ice cream topped with strawberries and bananas and it was fantastic!"
"1","5","yummyyyyyy!!!!!!!! i made this when I had ppl over for dinner..some of them don't eat cake and they really loved it:) i ended the night giving the recipe to everyone!!! i'll definitely bake this again!"
"1","5","Very good, very easy. Very moist and tasty. Inscreased the cocoa a little bit. I could eat this without frosting, but if I were going to frost it again, it would be with a vanilla frosting instead of chocolate."
"1","5","I upped the coco to 1 c., used 1 c. stong brewed coffee in place of the water and baked it in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 40 mins. I made it into a 'Better Than Sex Cake' it was a huge hit at work. I made the recipe again, with the modifications above, into cupcakes baked at 350 for 20 mins and these were my favorite. I iced them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site."
"1","5","This was a fabulously moist, chocolatey cake. I added a squirt of Hershey's syrup to the batter, and also used strong coffee in place of the water. I was a little worried because the batter was SO thin, but it turned out just right!"
"1","4","This recipe is pretty good, and very easy to make. I did make a couple small alterations. Instead of adding 1 cup boiling water, I added 1 cup stong brewed coffee. Coffee really brings out the flavor of the cocoa powder. I also added about 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients."
"1","5","My first chocolate cake from scratch, and it was a huge hit. This recipe has it all - it has only a few easily available ingredients, it's moist, and it's has a deep chocolate flavor. I used very good cocoa powder, and it made all the difference. Make sure to butter and flour the pans because the cake tends to stick. Also, do NOT fill the pans to the brim, or the mixture will expand and fall over the sides. If you don't put a baking sheet under the cake pan (as I did once), the mixture will smoke and burn on the bottom of the oven. Oops. Anyway, about 2/3 from the top will do it. You can make a couple cupcakes from the left over batter, if you have any. I poured 'Hard Chocolate Glaze' (from another allrecipe member) in between the two layers and all over the top. It was too much! Everyone was in heaven :)"
"1","5","Wow, what a cake. I have made many variations of a chocolate cake and this by far was the best! Yes, the batter did appear very 'soupy' but once it came out of the oven it was just perfect. I made this for a birthday and got rave reviews, there was barely any left over! I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","Made it just as the recipe says and it was delicious! Moist and not too sweet!"
"1","5","This is a great chocolate cake recipe. I made a 13x9 cake and topped it with homemade chocolate buttercream icing. The cake was tender, very moist and rich in flavor. It was easy to make and really good. I will make this again and again and will never buy a mix - this is too easy and so much better."
"1","5","Wonderful! I used Ghiradelli cocoa powder and increased to 1 cup as others suggested. I topped it with Chocolate Ganache."
"1","4","I didn't really like this recipe, the batter was very thin, almost like water. The cupcakes I made did rise very nicely though. And my hubby and 2 yr old liked them."
"1","5","If I could give this a 10 I would have my husband said it was the best chocolate cake he had ever had!!"
"1","5","All I need to say is WOW. This is the ONLY chocolate cake recipe you need! I know it said that the batter would be thin/runny after adding the water, but it still looked TOO runny... I thought, 'What the hey, I'll bake it anyway.' It is SO moist and DELICIOUS! This only reinforces my decision to quit cake mixes - I've never looked back! :) I'm not a chocoholic, so I went with a vanilla frosting... it is a recipe I got from my grandma, who got it from a friend befoe my mom was born. 2T and 2t flour 1 cup milk 1 cup butter (2 sticks) softened 1 cup sugar 1 1/2 t vanilla. Mix all of the flour with a little milk until it is smooth. Mix in the rest of the milk and heat on the stove over medium heat *WHISKING CONSTANTLY* until it is thick and smooth. Let cool. In a mixer (or w/ a hand mixer) cream the butter and sugar. While mixer is still going, add th cooled milk mixture a little at a time. Beat until fluffy. Add vanilla and beat until incorporated. This is the PERFECT frosting - not so sweet your mouth hurts, just creamy and perfect! Give it a try! (But give Mrs. Holly all the credit for her fabulous recipe!) ^_^"
"1","5","Very good cake, follow directions and it should come out perfect. The texture was very nice."
"1","5","Very good recipe for basic chocolate cake. Had a pleasant flavor and I made it as written. Great because the ingredients are always things I have around the house. Better than boxed chocolate cake!"
"1","5","the best chocolate cake ever. my husband made this for a cub scout dinner and it was a winner. it's very moist, i suggest putting parchment circles on the bottoms of the cake pans, as it may stick. make this recipe and you'll never make another!"
"1","5","This is amazing!!! We love this!! Always a hit with a chocolate butter frosting! Add the eggs one at a time."
"1","4","I was for something quick and easy to do with my 4yr old daughter. This is just the ticket! Very moist and fluffy. However I would have aenjoyed a little more of a chocolate flavor. Always room for improvement maybe some choclate chips or syrup. Still a keeper as is."
"1","5","Wow. Fantastic. Easy. Don't change anything on the original recipe. I used two round cake pans (reduced cooking time by 5 minutes). Also, used icing recipe from back of Herseys Cocoa can. Moist. Delicious."
"1","5","I halved the recipe and made 18 beautiful cupcakes.Didn't change a thing, except I added 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract (for fun only).I didn't read all the reviews before I made this, but I checked it out just after. To start with, this recipe is totally working!!! Everything - ingredients, amounts - is right! I'm glad I gave it a shot! Thank for submitting!"
"1","5","This cake is quick, easy and yummy! I hate dry cakes, and I was delighted that this was so moist. I put whipped cream and sour cherries between layers and on top, and sprinkled with chocolate flakes. I made it for my fiance's birthday, and he INHALED it!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly (but used a blender as I didn't have a mixer). For filling I used strawberry jam and on the top I melted some chocolate and mixed it with chocolate wafer cookies.  Everybody absolutely loved it."
"1","5","Amazing. Great taste! Do use 1 cup of cocoa. I made this, but I only had 2 8 inch pans.. that worked fine. It is not too dry or too moist. I could actually grab the cake with my hands with out it breaking on me. I frosted the cake with a fluffy frosting I made with instant pudding and whipped topping. It was easy to make and delicious! I couldn't take a photo because it was gone before i could haha."
"1","5","This cake was SO good - I used cake flour, but other than that, made the recipe as it was written. I made two layers, made a simple chocolate frosting to put on top/in between the layers, and the cake was a hit. Served it at a friend's birthday and everyone loved it! It was moist, chocolatey and really, really good."
"1","5","This is by far the easiest chocolate cake I've ever made, and sooooo moist and delicious - YUM! I followed suggestions of other reviewers and increased cocoa to a cup, and also added 2 tsps instant coffee to the hot water. It was just perfect! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe."
"1","4","This was extremely easy to make, and even though I increased the cocoa powder to one cup, I didn't think it was a 'wow' cake. But it's a great cake to make as a standby because I think most people would have all the ingredients on hand. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","I increased the cocoa to 1 cup...great recipe"
"1","5","Really light and moist. Only change I made was to use 1 cup cocoa powder as almost everybody suggested. I also used applesauce for all the oil. Appearance and texture wise, it was great. Taste wise, not nearly sweet enough for my taste, but it was still superb. I had doubts about the method, but surprisingly, it baked to perfection right on the 30 min mark. I never had that happen before! Definite keeper and will make again. And again."
"1","4","Great simple choc. cake. I am known for my elaborate baking endeavors, which are usually delectable...but I had to make a birthday cake and was in a major hurry the day before so I used this cake recipe, the chocolate ganache recipe from this site, and spread seedless raspberry jam in between loaves for a raspberry chocolate ganache cake. I was skeptical venturing out into the unknown for someone's birthday, but I got RAVE reviews!!! Next time I will make more ganache as there was not enough for this cake, but the cake itself was very simple to prepare and quite tasty. Not too rich either, as it uses cocoa instead of chocolate. Good choc. cake recipe when time is short! I rated 4 stars as I did not make with frosting as directed."
"1","5","So easy, sooooo good! thanks for a wonderful recipe. I almost halfed the sugar, and it was still sweet enough to my opition."
"1","4","Finding this recipe here at AllRecipes.com just made my life a whole lot easier. Thanks for posting it, shirleyo. This cake got way more than 5 stars from my chronic chocoholic husband. I'm sure I'll make it a gazillion times now, and LOVE the ease of this delicate, moist cake recipe.  I, too, baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes at 350. Came out just perfect!"
"1","5","Very easy, perfect consistency & moistness. Not heavy on the chocolate flavor, so frost accordingly. I made it with vanilla frosting and it was delicious. A definite keeper!"
"1","5","This cake is bloody amazingly easy to cook, and came out wonderfully. It had a gently chewy crust, and was very moist and fluffy. The batter was less thick than pancake batter, but came out beautifully. (I had believed the recipe was ruined but wanted to try it anyway- don't be fooled by the thin mixture- it turns out delicious!)"
"1","5","Wow! I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do a 'from scratch' chocolate cake, but this recipe worked fantastically! The cake is absolutely delicious. I even made 'healthy' substitutions and it still turned out fantastic. I used part Splenda, part white sugar, increased the cocoa to 1 cup, substituted strong coffee for water and used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil. It baked perfectly and tastes delish topped with chocolate frosting."
"1","5","I followed the recipe without changing a thing. the batter looked very watery but it turned great. I made cupcakes came out in 20 minutes."
"1","5","I made this cake last weekend and other then upping the cocoa powder to 1 cup i made no changes..everyone loved it =) thank you"
"1","5","Easy clean up & tastey"
"1","2","Not a very good recipe. Flavor is good but the cake is very crumbly. I followed the exact recipe as this is my son's birthday cake and I wanted it to be perfect. Not my idea of a geat cake. I think the texture needs improving. I will try another recipe from this site next time tho."
"1","2","the only thing that made this cake taste good was my butter cream frosting."
"1","5","I made cupcakes using this recipe and they turned out great - rich and chocolatey without being too sweet. I halved the recipe and made 12 large cupcakes. I added a simple milk chocolate icing and chopped walnuts on top of the cupcakes and they tasted even yummier."
"1","5","This turned out light not dense for me. Perhaps it is because I sifted the flour and cocoa powder. It taste just like a box mix... which I didn't mind at all."
"1","5","This was the best chocolate cake from scratch I have ever had. Usually scratch cakes I find are dry but this was moist and not ridiculously sweet. I did not change a thing and would never. I used a cream cheese frosting recipe and unfortunatly can not stop eating this cake!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. It was very airy and light (not dense), which is exactly what I wanted. I added choc chips after I poured the batter and they sank to the bottom. Next time, I will add them after the batter has thickened a little."
"1","5","I just made this cake for my sister and laws reception. It was delicious! And easy. Only problem was that it boiled over the pan while cooking (even after we only filled the pans half way). Totally worth it."
"1","4","This is the Hershey's recipes...I agree. That is so wrong to post this as your own. I use this recipe all the time and recognized it immediately!!!"
"1","5","This cake is amazing. I actually forgot to get the vanilla extract and was worried it wouldn't come out good but it was still EXCELLENT. It was sooo easy to make. It did take about 15 minutes more to make than expected but it was worth the wait. I was worried because when I checked on it in the oven, it seemed so light and it fell a little in the middle but it came out great! Love it."
"1","5","This is the best chocolate cake recipe available, especially if you are looking for a light, airy, very chocolatey cake. I used the recipe to make cupcakes, and it made about 30 cupcakes with perfect domed tops and a very moist crumb. I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar, added an extra 1/4 c. cocoa, and doubled the vanilla. Perfect!"
"1","5","Great recipe! Very easy to make and it came out tasting great! The batter is thin, almost watery like, and that scared me at first but I remembered other reviewers warnings and went with it - glad I did. Very moist. I upped the cocoa to 1 cup and used a 9 x 13 pan, baked for 35 minutes and it was perfect. This was actually my first attempt at homemade cake and everyone was impressed! Thanks so much!"
"1","5","I made this last night, and I used the 1 cup cocoa, and one larger pan, for 40 min. It was divine. I have to make it again tonight, because the family went nuts over it. We all agree that it's a wonderful recipe."
"1","4","The taste was fantastic, but heads up to others, this makes more mix than a standard cake mix (i.e. more than 24 cupcakes in my case) so be prepared for that."
"1","5","wow this was the best ever, I did increase the cocoa to 1 cup, perfect!"
"1","5","This cake is DELICIOUS! It is very moist, and chocolatey. It is very easy to make, and fast too. I just made it as a surprise for my hubby for our anniversary! I'm sure he's going to LOVE it!"
"1","4","Very quick & easy cake! I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, reduced the sugar to 1 & 1/2 cups and added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the boiling water. Took about 55mins to bake rather than 35mins but I was using a funny shaped pan. A lovely light chocolate cake that I will be making again!!!"
"1","5","I will never buy a pre-made cake mix again. Turned out lovely. :o) So wonderful that everyone raved that it was better than my sister-in-law (who is a professional cake maker). The caked popped outa the pan perfectly (I coated it with butter and powdered cocoa) and it was moist and yummy. I did use the boiling coffee per one persons comment earlier.Not very chocolate tasting, though, but if you are craving something sweet, this is it!"
"1","5","I made this on a spur of the moment. My son wanted to take chocolate cupcakes to preschool for his birthday and I didn't have a cake mix on hand. My hopes weren't high because I can't even make a boxed cake mix come out right. Boy was I suprised. This recipe is WONDERFUL! It was super easy to make and very moist. My husband didn't believe me when I told him it was homeade. Thank you so much for the recipe, it's a keeper for sure!"
"1","4","Moist and very chocolatey! Great cake and it's a cinch to make. I never thought you could add wet to dry ingredients but it worked fine.  FYI- If you get the idea of using a cream cheese frosting on this cake, it's probably not a good idea to use Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site. Made as instructed it's far too runny to be suitable for a cake. (I found this out the hard way)"
"1","3","I tried making this cake twice. The first time it didn't cook evenly and fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan. The second time it was dry. Both times the cakes fell in the center. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but I'm going to keep searching for a cake recipe."
"1","5","This was a great cake, I made cupcakes. They were very moist and very easy to make. Look forward to making a cake with this."
"1","5","This cake is awesome! Moist, chocolatey, easy to make and not too sweet, so it pairs perfectly with a buttercream frosting. I followed the directions exactly except I added about 1/2 cup chopped semi-sweet chocolate chips -thinking it would be similar to choc. chip muffins- but I put them in before adding the boiling water so of course they melted. And also I split the batter between 2 heart shaped pans lined with parchment. The texture was great- after cooling they removed from the pan and held together perfectly. One was dusted with confectioners sugar only- simple and elegant- and served a day after baking. Hubby preferred that one. The other was frosted with a buttercream frosting from this site (sorry, can't remember which one right now) as a birthday cake which the family just loved. Will definitely make this again."
"1","5","A great cake for being sooo easy. I added hot instant coffee in place of the boiling water which made the cake extremely dark and rich tasting. Then I topped it with the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. Delicious."
"1","5","I made this for my husbands birthday, my parents came over and we serious considered opening a bakery because of this cake! Everyone loved this cake, it was so mosit and full of the chocolate flavor we were craving!  I followed the recipe exactly, using nestle cocoa powder and I melted 1 bar of the Ghirardelli baking chocolate to add to the chocolate infusion. I made a simpe icing for the cake and poured it on hot, it was perfect. I have made this cake numerous times now, and each time it comes out perfecly!"
"1","5","I made this cake yesterday for my hubby (Valentine's Day). He's not much for making comments, but did like it. I loved it! I think it's the best chocolate cake I've ever made. It was so moist and tasty, not too sweet-just right!  The only changes I made were to use whole wheat flour, as I always do, ( used a little less-1/14 cup) and less salt-1/2 tsp. is plenty. For icing, I whipped one pint of cream, and added about 1 Tbsp. each of sugar and cocoa powder. A perfect topping for this cake!  For cupcakes, I noticed if you google Hershey Chocolate cake, you will get instructions on them and other types of pans. I couldn't find my heart pan, so used an oblong one, approx. 10 x 14'.  shellylyn"
"1","4","Really simple basic cake. Great when you need something quick, especially it calls for basic ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and used it for school cupcakes."
"1","3","I thought this cake was dry."
"1","5","I have made this cake for company, showers, & just for myself and my husband. He will eat it for breakfast if he can :) Thanks for a great recipe, I don't think it is really necessary to top with icing since the cake is so moist. Just sprinkle with some dark & white chocolate chips while cake is still warm."
"1","5","Runny yes, bland no. Wow, what a wonderful, moist chocolatey delight! First time making it. I will look no further for this type of cake. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Just as described - 'Rich and Moist'. This was just YUMMY!"
"1","4","When I first made this, it tasted a little off, but when I tried it again the next day it was great. Very mysterious. Anyway, it had a good texture and not-overly-strong chocolate flavor, but I disagree with the person who said it was easier than a boxed mix. no way jose!"
"1","5","This was quite dense and not too sweet, but really good."
"1","2","I made this cake for my son's birthday, and after reading all the great reviews, was very disappointed. The taste wasn't great, even using 1 cup of cocoa, the cake was heavy. Not a favorite at all."
"1","5","I was looking for a simple but moist chocolate birthday cake and came across this recipe. this is a gorgeous cake which i have made for my three childrens' birthdays, they love it and so do all their friends. a perfect recipe, but i do put a bit less water in it than suggested, so the batter is not too runny."
"1","5","I've been making this cake for years and its awesome! However, my recipe calls for 2 cups of flour and only 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda. I also use 1 cup of cold, strong coffee in stead of the milk. Enjoy! It's amazing!!"
"1","5","I made this cake for my coworker's birthday and it was a hit! I baked it in a 9X14 pyrex dish. It is quite sticky at the bottom but the flavor was great. I also used strong coffee instead of the boiling water to add more taste. I frosted the cake with a chocolate/sour cream frosting...delicious..."
"1","5","This will probably end up being my staple chocolate cake. It turned out fantastic. Don't worry about the batter being so thin before you bake it, it will turn out perfectly. I covered mine with two layers of chocolate ganache and topped it with some fresh strawberries, and I had a hard time not drooling all over it..."
"1","5","Yummy! This cake is moist and tastes so good. I even substituted the oil for applesauce and my hubby nor I could tell! I will make this alot, thank you!"
"1","5","i loved it! really rich and moist,i used coffee instead of plain water as suggested by others,i also baked in a 9x13inch pan. i covered it with chocolate frosting. i will use this recipe again,thankyou."
"1","5","Very easy to make, all in one bowl (which I loved), and the flavor was rich and chocolatey. This was very very moist. This is a keeper, thanks Shirley."
"1","5","Everyone's favourite cake. I made this for my father once and now it is a staple for birthdays in my family.  Super moist and rich."
"1","5","I just finished bakeing the cake, it tastes wonderfull. I didnt have enough oil, so i used melted butter. It very moist and it has that nice chocolaty taste that is not too sweet."
"1","5","Loved It !! I made this cake last night for company, and they loved it !!! I also did what another user suggested and substituited the water with hot coffee and it really gave the cake a kick !!! Another thing that I modified was using wheat flour instead of the regular and it didn't damper it at all !! Fantabulos recipie !!! I will defaintly be making this one again !!"
"1","5","I made this recipe for Fourth of July cupcakes. I halved the recipe for 12 cupcakes and followed the recipe exactly. I used some fancy cocoa fron Holland I found at the store for my husband who is picky about his chocolate. I also used the brown sugar cream cheese frosting recipe on this website. Topped with raspberries and blueberries, it looked very festive. And it tasted GREAT. We ended up eating cupcakes for dinner one night. It looks thin but that works perfectly for cupcakes- scooping it into the cups is easy. And they come out so moist and wonderfully delicious!"
"1","5","Seriously the best chocolate cake I have ever had...and my whole family agrees. Very chocolate-y, and SO easy! I've made it 4 times and I've found you really have to thoroughly grease the pan(s) as it does have a tendency to stick a little bit. But overall SO yummy!!"
"1","5","Very moist. I had to cook it much longer, probably 15 min. longer, but very good. My son asked for it for his birthday cake. it's a keeper."
"1","3","This cake didn't come out chocolate-y enough for me."
"1","4","Good fluffy and easy cake, I think it lacked a little flavor, next time I am going to add some coffee to it, or maybe some chocolate chips as I like a real chocolaty tasting cake."
"1","5","Excellent! Came out extremely moist. Looked almost underdone but was just very moist. Iced with chocolate icing and filled with cherry preserves."
"1","5","followed it EXACTLY with the exception of a little variation with the oven time, which is different for each oven. However, all i had to do is check the center with a toothpick. Ok, so it was a big hit, especially when i filled it with a layer of raspberry jam and thawed out raspberries, and a second layer of chocolate fudge. Then iced it with no other than chocolate icing (only a thin layer) then used chocolate shavings to decorate plus fresh strawberries on top (i was out of fresh raspberries). I was doubtful at first because the batter was runny. I'll try it again and again with different flavours (maybe some coffee, less cocoa poweder,...etc). Thank You"
"1","5","This was the most moist and delicious chocolate cake I've ever made. The extra water probaly had something to do with it..."
"1","5","I made this for my 3 year olds b-day. It was delicious!!"
"1","5","did this recipe for my son's bday and it came out really good...."
"1","5","thanks for the great recipe..i have tried it 5 times..getting better each time..my family love it!"
"1","5","Awesome moist cake!"
"1","4","It was OK. Nothing special with this cake."
"1","1","Everyone gave this so many stars I was sure it would be good -- so disappointing! Followed directions exactly, used good cocoa, but still not as good as expected. Too spongy & bland. Will not use again"
"1","5","Great cake! Loved it! Thanks"
"1","2","Maybe I did something wrong but I found it to be quite bland and the consistency was odd. Almost like it was boiled instead of baked in the middle but with a crunchy exterior. The only real positive was that it made the house smell like hot chocolate."
"1","5","Yes, this is the cake on the Hershey's Powdered Chocolate Box, and yes, it is delicious!!"
"1","4","Used buttermilk instead of milk, Topped it with satiny shocolate glaze from this site. Came out so delicious and chocolatey. Most people loved it, but some said it was a bit too dense, or heavy. But really very tasty and beautiful dark chocolate color. Very moist and delish as is without glaze even!"
"1","5","Family loved the cake, husband said it was just like he had as a kid. The second time I tried adding some chocolate chips for the boys however, this was not so good. They all settled because it was thin batter, whick I figured would happen, still great though. Rises awesome"
"1","5","THIS RECIPE IS DELICIOUS, BUT FOUND IT TO BE AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE HERSHEY'S PERFECTLY CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE, FOUND ON HERSHEY'S WEBSITE. IT IS MADE WITH THE EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS AND COOKED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY."
"1","5","Very good cake recipe. This is the recipe that is on the back of the Hershey's cocoa box."
"1","5","WOW, fast, easy and absolutely scrumtious!!! This cake turned out nice and moist/dense/tasty!!! I needed a quick cake for my hubby last night so I tried this since he is a chocolate lover, and MAN ALIVE, this is the best homemade (from scratch) cake I have ever made! THANKS for the recipe! It's a keeper"
"1","4","This was the moistest cake I've ever had, almost too fudgy the night I made it. I used a ganache as the frosting, which made it truly decadent. It tasted a lot better the next day, and even better the day after. I will definitely make this again, but I will make it a couple of days ahead next time."
"1","5","The best and easiest chocolate cake ever...once you've tasted it, you'll never eat chocolate cake from a boxed mix again! The best part is that it is simple to make and very, very moist."
"1","5","This cake was so easy to make and everyone loved it! It is very moist and goes well with the Chocolate Mousse Cake IV recipe (used this for the frosting). Will definitely make this again."
"1","4","I halved the water, but it still came out pretty good. I overdid the chocolate though (the cocoa powder), but that was my fault. The mix didn't look dark enough to me at first. lol"
"1","5","So easy, so good and so many compliments. Definitely a keeper."
"1","5","This was my first scratch cake and turned out better than any boxed cake ever has. The cake is moist and fluffy. I made this cake as the base for a decadant layer cake but seriously, the syrup I used to sweeten, moisten, and flavor the cake was not needed."
"1","5","Excellent!!! This is a fantastic cake recipe! I will be making this again and again! Made it for my Grandfather's birthday, made buttercream frosting for the center and frosted the rest with the Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting recipe on this site (also excellent!)"
"1","5","My family loves this cake! I make it often, and I follow the recipe exactly as it is. I do, though, bake it in a Bundt pan (like others have said - takes 40 min.), and we cover individual slices with hot fudge sauce (from a jar) and have ice cream on the side. That is just Heaven on a plate! Also, we take individual slices and wrap them up and keep them in the freezer. When we take out a slice, we pop it in the microwave with hot fudge poured on it, heat it up, and it tastes just as fresh as the day it was baked. Even seems to be a little more moist. This is my hubby's favorite cake! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","I loved this cake it is SOOO good!!"
"1","5","Really enjoyed this cake. Very easy to make and several days later is still very moist.   I didn't have the two 9-inch pans, though, so I just poured the mixture into a bundt pan and baked for 40 minutes and it came out perfectly."
"1","5","This recipe is excellent!! Super moist and super easy to create. All the guests were raving about it."
"1","5","I was craving for some chocolate cake, so I decided to make this. It was my first time making cake from scratch and this was very easy. It was very moist. I baked it in a bundt pan for 40 minutes and topped it with chocolate ganache (found in this site)."
"1","5","Wonderfully moist and delicious. I substituted Splenda and a little bit of honey instead of sugar and it was still marvelous! Thank you!"
"1","5","So Good! I used chocolate ganache, because there is never enough chocolate in my world. Will definately make again."
"1","5","This is the recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder. It does get 5 stars but it's a company's published recipe."
"1","5","Very easy and delicious. I think this is the first cake I've made, and it turned out perfectly. The recipe was foolproof, and my fiance's mother (who makes chocolate cakes all the time) even asked for the recipe!"
"1","5","Great with cream cheese frosting!!!  8 oz. cream cheese, 1 cube margarine, 1 t. vanilla, 2 t. milk, 1 pound powdered sugar  Also good with this pudding frosting...1 package (4 serving size) Instant Pudding, 1/4 C powdered sugar, 1 C cold milk, 8 oz Whip topping  You can do the cream cheese in the middle with the pudding frosting outside or vice versa. So yummy."
"1","5","This cake was DELICIOUS! I made it for a birthday cake. It was moist and MUCH better than a boxed mix. I frosted with Hershey's 'Perfectly Chocolate' chocolate frosting (on the back of the cocoa box).   Update: I was out of vanilla, so I used peppermint extract in exact amounts for the cake and frosting. It was really good!"
"1","5","This is good, everybody loved it."
"1","5","I made this cake for a group of people who were helping us remodel our house! I wanted the cake to be scrumptious!!! This cake was definitely that! It was very decadent and moist with wonderful flavor and not to sweet! It got rave reviews and I will never buy another chocolate cake mix again! I did use 1 cup of cocoa powder and when the batter was in the pan I sprinkled 3/4 cup of choc chips on top, which could be omitted as the cake was plenty chocolatey:) For the frosting I used 1 14oz. can of sweetened condensed milk 1 1/4 cup semi sweet choc. chips and 1 T vanilla extract, melted in the microwave and spread on cake. DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks for a great recipe! Tamara"
"1","5","This is an AWESOME chocolate cake. Tastes even better then the box mix. Everyone in my family loved it. It was very moist and chocolatey. Will make this again!!! Thanks!"
"1","4","I made this for my son's birthday, and it was good, but I think all the reviews set me up for a 'WOW' experience, and instead, I got a very good, but not fireworks-inducing, chocolate cake. It was insanely easy to make. Mine fell a smidge in the middle (could be because I was dancing while making the frosting to entertain my 4-month-old). I baked for 35 minutes, and it was done. Everyone said they liked it (and every plate was clean except my six-year-old birthday boy's), but I thought it was maybe even too rich, but not chocolatey enough for the richness of it. I filled it with fresh strawberries and strawberry gel and frosted it with Butter Cream Frosting II from this site. Overall a good cake, and I would probably make it again, but it didn't knock my socks off."
"1","3","I'm sure I followed the recipe exactly but the batter never cooked completely. I left it in the oven for over an hour. It did make great brownies though! Frosted with chocolate butter cream frosting."
"1","5","This is defintely a keeper. Moist and delicious!"
"1","5","Great cake, very moist! I added 2 tbsp. of coffee to mine...yummy!"
"1","5","I was searching for a good chocolate cake recipe to make for my friend's shower and made 3 test cakes before I found this recipe which worked amazing because it was so light and moist. I actually made a big slab cake with this recipe. I frosted with a chocolate buttercream icing (in the middle too) and then chocolate ganache over the whole thing. When it set, I decorated with hearts using melted milk chocolate. Everyone craves this cake. I think I have even out done my mother in law. Thanks."
"1","5","This is honestly the best choclate cake to make, im nto much of a cook and it was so easy and everyone was impressed!"
"1","5","super easy to make, i made it into loaves and they were a little dry without frosting but otherwise really good"
"1","5","Easy & delicious! No need to buy boxed mixes again. Like another reviewer, I baked this in a 9 x 13 pan for 43 minutes. Yum! My entire family loved it."
"1","5","What can I say..this cake recipe is the best! This was so easy, with NO MESS!! Not to mention MOIST as ever! This cake is great...I was doubtful about how thin the batter was...but was I wrong! Another key thing is that I ran out of sugar, I only had one and a half cups of sugar left in my pantry. The cake came out perfect! This was a home run. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and they were sooooo good. I loathe dry cupcakes, but these were so moist that they didn't even need icing! Only thing I can suggest though, is that when you fill your muffin tins, don't over fill them (2/3 full is good) because they rise a lot (I had a little spill). And I recomend, to watch for the airbubbles -- if you they are done (kinda like you test for pancakes), so that they don't over cook. I took mine out when they looked really glossy almost gooey, but they sprung back when I touched them and the toothpck cake clean.Highly recomended!"
"1","5","I kid you not, this is the best chocolate cake ever! It is the moistest cake I have ever had! So chocolaty too! I bake mine in a 9x13 pan for about 40-45 minutes. Super easy and VERY tasty!!! I usually top mine with buttercream icing (by Sharon Gerstman). Now, I need to go get me another piece!! :o)"
"1","5","I made this as a prop for my daughter's final in Public Speaking class, everyone loved it. I baked it in a half sheet pan and frosted with a 'real' butter cream{butter, pwd sugar, cream and a splash of vanilla}She got an A{on her speech, of course}and she brought home no leftovers. I gave it 5 stars."
"1","5","This recipe was great. I used apple sauce instead of oil, still turned out fluffy. And it was really easy to make."
"1","5","A beautiful cake! It did not stick at all, rose perfectly and was so moist and fluffy. I opted to make it more interesting by adding sliced almonds, coconut, dried cherries and ground ginger - mmm. Also, I substituted maple sugar for the white sugar and you could not tell the difference (you must add 1/4 of baking soda for every 1 cup of maple though). Will definitely make this gem again!!!"
"1","5","I decided on this recipe because of the simple ingrediants and excellent reviews. It turned out to be a great choice, because the birthday girl dubbed it 'the best cake chocolate cake she ever had'. It was easy to make and came out perfect. Just make sure you bake it long enough. Goes well with chocolate ganache."
"1","5","This was the first homemade cake I have ever made and it was wonderingful. I used a square pan, and it was the first time I've ever had a cake come out flat with no bump in the middle. I keep thinking this isn't going to work, but it did. It tastes great with choclate fudge frosting. As another review said it would taste even beeter with better quality cocoa powder."
"1","5","What a wonderful cake. It did seem runny before baking, but it was extremley moist. I did bake an additional 8-10 minutes. Thank you"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe. Just a few minutes to prepare and tastes delicious. Thanks!"
"1","5","This is the most unbelievable chocolate cake out there! It is the easiest thing in the world to make! I made I for my brother's family birthday and I got rave reviews."
"1","5","I found this cake to be the most moist cake ever.Cleaning out my recipe folder at home,I found that I had this same recipe clipped out of a Family Circle magazine advertising Hersheys cocoa powder.It was in a Feb.1999 issue.I apparently never made it because I would have remembered making such a delicious cake.Thanks."
"1","5","Very good and easy to make. No more boxed chocolate cake for me!"
"1","5","This is a fabulous chocolate cake. It was so easy and turned out perfectly!"
"0","3","Flat and not very tasty. I have had much simpler and better tasting chocolate cakes."
"0","1","The whole point of this site, I thought, is to post unique home made recipes, not copies of other recipes. I was browsing for a chocolate cake recipe and read this recipe among many others. And then I read a recipe from this website: https://www.hersheys.com/recipes/en-us/recipes/cakes-cupcakes/184/hersheys-perfectly-chocolate-chocolate-cake . And I realized that's the original recipe ! What a shame I say.."
"0","5","This cake was lovely .It was soft , moist and delicious just like a boxed mix .I recommend like most of the other reviewers did to increase the cocoa powder to 1 cup and sift the dry ingredients together into the bowl.after using this recipe I will never use a boxed mix again!!!!"
"0","3","If you want a cake that tastes like a mix cake, then this recipe is ok, since it's really no more work than a boxed mix. But if you want something really, deeply chocolatey, this is not the cake for you. It was moist and rose nicely, but the taste was rather bland. I will keep looking for a fudgey chocolate cake."
"0","4","I just made the cake this morning but the cake is not soft, its not rich, moist like you said, but it's texture is moist and hard, not soft. what's wrong with it? Is it okay too if I greese the pan with butter?"
"0","5","I made this with the Better Batter gluten-free flour mix, and it was amazing! My husband said it was the best chocolate cake he had ever tasted--and since he's 47 and loves cake? That is a pretty amazing feat!"
"0","1","Worst cake I've ever made. Turned out like ."
"0","5","This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I've made. I had to bake it 40 min. instead of the 35. Yet what came out of my oven was beyond my expectations. Thanks so much.  Will tell friends."
"0","5","This recipe takes the cake. It has become my go-to for cake batter. It's simple to make, the texture is lovely and the cake is nice and moist."
"0","5","Very good and really easy to make! Im sure I will be making this again and again for my grandkids!"
"0","4","I agree with SunnySmile. It is more like fudge cake. I didn't have eggs, so I substituted chia seed 'gel.' I had only a little milk left, so I used yogurt instead. It still came out like described: dense, rich, and moist. I also lined the bottom of my non-stick bundt pan with parchment paper. Made a HUGE difference in being able to remove the cake in one piece."
"0","5","Yes i will make this again. It is so moist and rich i love it!! To it i poored a blackberry strawberry syrup using powdered sugar and water to that i added blackberries and strawberries. SO GOOD"
"0","5","Great I think I will try it"
"0","5","Great recipe for a moist cake, thank you."
"0","5","First attempt at making cake from scratch and it turned out really nice. great recipe. Thanks a lot"
"0","5","This was an excellent cake! My family ate it warm and it was super yummy and moist. I did add 1 cup of cocoa like others said too and it was great! This will be my go to cake recipe! Thanks!"
"0","5","This cake was absolutely delicious, and it's so easy to make! I've made this for multiple celebrations and birthdays and will continue to in the future!"
"0","5","Just made it for the second time. It's a wonderful recipe. I did have to bake longer than 30 minutes, I just kept testing it until it came out clean. I made a giant cupcake the first time and a two layer round cake the second. It was devoured! I changed to 1 cup cocoa and added a teaspoon of instant coffee to boiling water. Its very liquidy, super easy to pour, very moist cake but not too dense. Very very good! Rave reviews from everyone:)"
"0","5","I baked it today and was so amazingly tasty and moist so easy to make had an amazing feedback from my family ?"
"0","5","The very first time I made this cake was a total disaster...evidently I missed something along the way and it VOLCANOED all over my oven. It smelled so good while it was making that mess I refused to let it defeat me. I waited about a month and tried again...HOLY MOLY!!! Since then my boss requests I make it every few weeks!"
"0","5","This recipe made it into my family cookbook.. No modifications needed. I make it atleast once a month."
"0","5","Simple, quick and decadent!!! A must try and then a must add to your recipe box!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. Super easy and moist. It's even easier if you use a kitchen scale for the dry ingredients. 8.1 ounces of sugar, 8.9 ounces of flour, 2.5 ounces of cocoa powder."
"0","5","I would use less salt next time but this was soooooo good"
"0","4","Have mAde it twice the first time turned out better than the second .. It is like a fudge ans I will make it again :)"
"0","4","it was so good. very fluffy and chocolaty."
"0","5","I use this as my never fail chocolate cake and is the best cake with its moist and spongy-ness. Awesome with caramel icing!"
"0","3","The end product tasted pretty good. But, it was super sticky and rose a lot more than accounted for. It didn't look like the picture at all. Cleanup was a nightmare. Would not use again. ps: frosting was awful"
"0","5","Very easy and a great base recipie. I used 9x13 and it only needed to cook for 30 mins. I have also substituted half the oil with applesauce and I couldn't tell the difference. Still moist and not too sweet. I also put a little less than the recommended sugar, less sweet and allows the cocoa to really come through."
"0","5","I've made this as a cake and as cupcakes Cupcakes take about 18 minutes. It comes out really light and moist. The only thing I changed was the order in which I mixed the ingredients. A lot of cake recipes say to cream together eggs, oil/butter and sugar. I do those 3 firsy, then the rest. Not sure if it makes a difference since the boiling water will take out the grainyness of the sugar."
"0","4","Very moist and excellent flavor, I was surprised at how thin the batter was but it baked perfectly in 30 minutes. So moist it was hard to get out of the pan but I dont have a cake server either."
"0","5","This is actually HERSHEY'S 'PERFECTLY CHOCOLATE' Chocolate Cake Recipe. I have made it numerous times and it is a favorite of my family."
"0","5","This is a GREAT recipe that I have made many times. I went way outside the box this time and added 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 T extra sugar, 2T extra cocoa and 1 C. .strong coffee. I think I've got something here .It's a very interesting texture, like baked pudding. Not too springy either. Next time going to do the same with Red wine instead of coffee. :-)"
"0","5","Delicious. Perfect every time. I like to make little cupcakes out of this because who wants to deal with the hassle of a whole cake and cleaning out pans? I sure don't. I prefer it plain - no topping of any kind. This batter is that good. Everyone has to hold back from eating more than they can chew haha."
"0","5","Made this last night and it was an absolute hit!! So easy, comes together fast, and tastes fantastic. Very moist but still held its shape well! No issues depanning. Made a beautiful choclate layer cake. Will make again! Added a hint of instant expresso powder to really bring out the chocolate flavour. Much easier than many cake recipes."
"0","5","Simple, easy to make, and a delicious taste! This is a great cake recipe to have on hand."
"0","1","This cake is very, very liquidy. I've done everything according to the directions. I put one star 'couldn't eat it' because I had to literally scoop out the liquidy part to eat it. I even added 5 minute intervals to bake it, but the inside and middle were still like the slop-ish mix in the bowl. All in all, the cake tastes deliciious, but like sunnysmile said, it is more of a pudding cake."
"0","5","This is an amazing chocolate cake! The best Ive ever eaten. It is my standby and all my friends beg me for the recipe. I would suggest to put in the wet ingredients first to give the cake more spongy better slicing surface. Also put in one cup of cocoa if you have enough. Cut circles of paper towel and put on the bottom of the greased pan. DO NOT flour the pan. This is the best recipe for cake I have ever eaten and I now HATE vanilla cake. :D"
"0","5","Super moist!"
"0","5","My family and I LOVE this recipe!! The only change I made is, instead of a cup of boiling water, I added a cup of hot coffee. I also scaled back the baking soda th 1 tsp. Yum!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. I made it twice, and not even the crumbs were left. I made it in a in a single cake tin, and I used butter icing to top it off. It was a hit."
"0","5","Amazing and EASY!!!"
"0","3","Very similar to boxed cake. Lacking the density and deep chocolate flavor that I prefer."
"0","5","The best chocolate cake I've ever made! As a previous reviewer suggested, I added a spoonful of instant coffee. Also, because I didnt have veg oil at hand, I used butter. Baked in a 9Ã13' pan. So moist and fluffy!"
"0","5","I have been looking for a chocolate cake recipe that was moist and with basic ingredients. This recipe was it! My husband loves chocolate and he truly loved it. Thank you for posting this recipe."
"0","5","Loved it!!"
"0","2","The taste was wonderful ... Nice and moist. But I can't serve a cake that doesn't come out of the pan! I made a lot of mini-cakes and almost all of them stuck in the pan. I ran a spatula around the edges to help, but then they just came out in pieces of cake. I'm going to have to start all over! At least my family will enjoy eating the 'mistakes.'"
"0","5","I've made this cake several times and every single time it's come out perfect and moist and everyone loves it. Recommended to anyone who wants to make an easy homemade chocolate cake."
"0","5","Best homemade chocolate cake recipe I've found it's so good. Like quite a few people that have rated this recipe on here I upped the cocoa to 1 cup and it's amazing it doesn't even need frosting it's great with some confectioners sugar sifted over it."
"0","5","This is the easiest, quickest chocolate cake recipe ever. I substituted apple sauce instead of oil and used 3/4 Cup whole wheat in place of flour. The results... AWESOME! Everyone was raved. Will make again!!!"
"0","5","First homemade chocolate cake... Very nice... Thank you so much... Now I know whats in my cake..."
"0","5","My mom went 'mmmMmmmM!' And my dad said 'I think this is the best cake I've ever had' and he's (almost) 40! And at first I thought it looked to dark but it turned out outstanding! I also made a frosting for it!"
"0","5","This is the first chocolate recipe that I followed, this is the first time I made a birthday cake, and it turned out to be a big SUCCESS ;). Very easy to follow, very simple to prepare and very tasty!"
"0","5","I made this cake using Cup 4 Cup Gluten Free flour, and it came out beautifully! Oh my goodness! Happy day! Thank you!"
"0","1","I made cupcakes. Instead of rising they overflowed, spread out and were flat. They appeared done and sprung back when touched but were wet looking on top. I added a little more baking time but it didn't help. They were moist as promised but that didn't keep them from crumbling and sticking to your fingers. Flavor was not sweet enough to please kids."
"0","4","I don't like chocolate cake, but seeing as it's my sister's birthday and she doesn't like vanilla, I thought I'd give this a try. It's super moist and so much better than a box cake! And with only needing one bowl, making it is a breeze (cleaning up too). I even liked this cake - it's yummy. :)"
"0","5","this cake was just right! very moist and tasty."
"0","5","Had almost a full cup of cocoa. Very good and moist!"
"0","5","I added 3 teaspoons cinnamon and 1 tsp cayenne pepper to make a mexican chocolate cake. It was amazing!"
"0","5","This cake is awesome and really easy to throw together. I had a hankering for cake and this hit the spot! Moist, light and delicious. Definitely will be making this again!"
"0","5","This is a fabulous chocolate cake recipe. Easy and delicious. Cake was very moist and clean up was a breeze. I have made a lot of cakes (even a few in the last few days) and I really love this one. We have food allergies and often need a safe cake or cupcake for school/community events on short notice-this will be my go to!"
"0","5","Best chocolate cake recipe ever. Even after a few days, it was still good and not old and bad texture like most cakes get. We will definitely make this one again. We have tried several chocolate cake recipes and love this one the most."
"0","5","This is an excellent chocolate cake. By far the best I've made. I only changed a couple things. As instead of reg cocoa I used Hershey's special dark for that extra kick, and used a whole cup??. And I used 3 tsp vanilla instead of 2. But WOW what a fantastic cake! I have found the perfect recipe and will not use another! Not too moist just right. Hope this helps!??"
"0","5","Couldnt habe asked for a better recipe! Perfect sugar, perfect moisture! Amazing thanks!!!"
"0","5","Very good love it!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at chocolate cake and it was a hit. The only change I made was to use one cup of chocolate. Word to the wise separate this and bake it in two pans. It will rise more that you think also do not use a spring form pan it will leak through."
"0","5","This was excellent with the strawberry buttercream frosting I made. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","4","Halved all the ingredients to make one 9' round cake. Except for the cocoa powder, used 1/2 cup instead. Totally worth it. Tasted delicious."
"0","4","This recipe was moist and delightful."
"0","5","DO NOT even think of making any other cake, every again! This cake is amazingly delicious and I make it for every occasion. I always have the ingredients on hand, and it takes literally 10 minutes to throw all of the ingredients together. Besides not using the oil, instead substituting flavoured apple sauce (it flavours the cake nicely!), I have not changed a thing in this recipe. Bake it once, and ENJOY!!"
"0","5","The is great. I am no baker. My best cake ever. Soft and moist"
"0","5","Shockingly easy and incredibly moist.... I drag this recipe out all the time. It never disappoints!"
"0","5","Great, easy, moist and delicious! It never failed me. :)"
"0","5","Amazing. Really easy to make, fast, and so, so good. We loved it!"
"0","5","This recipe was so easy and delicious. I did increase the amount of cocoa to 1 cup as advised by other reviewers and it was amazing."
"0","5","Amazing recipe! My husband said it was the best cake he has ever had in his life and asked me to make again the next week! Moist and fluffy and very rich! The second time I made it I halved the recipe to make a mini cake and it came out just as delicious!!!"
"0","4","Super moist cake and YUMMY delicious. The only thing holding it back from five stars is that I was looking to make a layer cake and this is too moist to stand up to layers. Otherwise, I will definitely make again in a loaf-style cake. I did make a couple of substitutions: I traded out butter for oil - I just like the taste better - and added chocolate chips into the batter. Mini chips work better as they don't sink to the bottom. So chocolately, I may have to find a different frosting other than chocolate. YUM!"
"0","5","This is so easy, ingredients I already have, and delicious. I have made it numerous times and follow the instructions as written and it's perfect every time. Once I added mini chocolate chips to the pan after pouring in the batter (otherwise if stirred into the mix it sits on the bottom) for a surprise for my chocolate lover and made it a round layer cake. I pair it with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe and it's always a hit. Double the frosting recipe to layer between the round cakes and frost the entire cake (top and sides). This is a go to recipe for me!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe. We increased the cocoa to 1 cup as well and it was delicious. It's become our go to cake, perfected with boiled icing."
"0","5","This was my first cake I've made turned out so yummy"
"0","5","This is my go-to recipe every Thanksgiving holiday. I have made this cake numerous times without fail. Never an issue with baking time or coming out of the pans. I always make it double layer. It's a hit every time. Pair with an awesome chocolate butter cream frosting (homemade), you can't lose."
"0","5","I tried it the very first time.. Absolutely delicious.. Not too moist or dry.. Beats many boxed chocolate cakes. How can I modify the recipe to make a vanilla cake or similar, that is not having to use cocoa... Thanks ever so much for the recipe.."
"0","5","I have made this cake a few time and ever time it is so dang good my kids and better half eat it so fast it crazy like watching 1 year olds eat their first cake lol im so glad to have found it thank yohso much for sharing"
"0","5","I made this cake exactly like the recipe, and it came out perfect! I love this recipe! Very easy-it will make you not want to buy a chocolate cake mix again."
"0","5","Very good and moist cake! As good as a bakery chocolate cake!"
"0","5","Most delicious cake. Very moist."
"0","5","best cake iv ever had! I'm a collage student in a Culinary Arts program and i used this cake for my Baking exam and it got me an 80%!!! Awesome Cake!"
"0","5","Hi, This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever. I made it for my darling's B'day and it's was a hit. I made this chocolate cake with the Authentic French Meringue from allrecipes with chopped chocolate for the topping. I call it Chocolate Meringue Cake. Only thing I did different was I cut the recipe in half and added 1tsp of pure Almond extract and I cut down the sugar of 1 cup to 3/4 cup for the cake and for the Meringue the recipe calls for 2 and 1/4 cup of sugar for 4 egg whites for which I added only 3/4 cup of sugar. They are still yummy and sweet enough for my family's taste. I recommend this recipe and also watch the videos for tips and tricks. Also read the reviews for tips from fellow bakers. Happy Baking.."
"0","5","Tasted even better the next day!!!! I used 1 cup of cocoa powder....."
"0","5","omg!! Love! Love! Love! this cake recipe.Becausei didnt hve veg oil i used canola but still came out brilliant :)"
"0","5","Perfect chocolate cake that you can take into different directions! Rather than bake a layered cake or cupcakes, I opted for a bundt cake version and it came out delicious. Took a some other users advice and used 1 cup of cocoa, (grocery store brand) and it came out moist, fluffy, and perfectly sweet. Not salty at all or mushy like other reviews. I have a wolf range which runs hot, but I still baked it for 30 mins and let it cool for about 30 minutes and it popped right out of the bundt cake pan. Used a chocolate glaze recipe that I found on allrecipes for a very simple, yet decadent dessert. This will be my go-to homemade chocolate cake recipe from now on!"
"0","5","As soon as I saw that a cup of boiling water was needing, I was a bit skeptic. However, it turned out incredibly well and the whole house loved it! It was moist and was pretty good; certainly better than I thought it would be!"
"0","5","I liked it the first time I made it. Since then I've adjusted it slightly by replacing the oil with a stick of melted unsalted butter, and replacing the cup of milk with a cup of water. Now I love it! Ya can't go wrong with butter..."
"0","5","So good!"
"0","5","Thank you shirleyo for sharing this recipe! Such a beautifully moist cake! The only change I made was to increase the cocoa to 1 cup and I sift it so there won't be any clumps. I've made this and poked holes in it and poured a raspberry syrup over it once it cooled. Friends and family love this recipe!! Thanks again."
"0","5","This is my go-to chocolate cake...really is a one bowl cake! As the recipe states, the batter is quite runny before baking but don't worry - it turns out fantastic. Everyone comments that my cakes are the most moist cakes they've had!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. I prefer baking it in a 9 x 13 for 40 minutes. However this is the exact same recipe as the chocolate cake recipe on the back of the Hershey Co. Cocoa container. It also includes the 1 cup of boiling water."
"0","5","Just made this last night. Wow!!! Just stop here folks and bake this cake! I altered the cocoa powder to dutch process cocoa at one full cup and used coconut oil. The consistency of the batter prebake is very loose. Fear not!!! This recipe will bake up into the most perfectly moist, rich cake ever! Hope my friend loves her birthday surprise!"
"0","5","This cake is so good. I baked mine an extra 10 minutes. It was fine. I greased the pans and placed parchment paper in them instead of greasing and flouring them. This cake had the exact flavor I was going for: nice chocolate, but not dry."
"0","2","What a mess !!!!! Baked exactly per instructions in 2 round 9 inch cake pans. Ran over tops of pans while in oven and made huge mess in oven and burned onto oven. Disaster !!! After baking; Cake in the pan was very irregular and uneven on top. It literally had hills and valleys instead of being level.   HIGH ALTITUDE ALERT !!!!!!! We live at 5300 feet so that is only thing I can think of was the problem. Tasted it and it had good flavor."
"0","5","Made these (with a simple buttercream icing) for my sister's bridal shower. Everyone loved them (including me). Several people asked for the recipe. I just couldn't stop eating them. Followed the recipe exactly, except made them cupcakes and baked for 18 minutes."
"0","5","My 3 boys made this cake all by themselves! Not only was it incredibly easy (one bowl) but in was super moist and delicious! This is your 'go-to' chocolate cake recipe!"
"0","4","I am so thankful for this recipe my family loved it !!! I used one cup of cocoa and it went great. I used butter cream in topping and doubled it with pure cream and some grated chocolates on top !!!"
"0","5","Fantastic! Easy to prepare and delicious to eat. Moist texture and rich chocolate. I made it for my brother's birthday and he simply adored it."
"0","5","Best chocolate cake recipe EVER!"

"0","5","I think this is the most amazing and beautiful looking cake and the best thing is it tasted delicious! I would recommend for everyone to try it."
"0","5","The best recipe for a relatively effortless cake. I was very impressed by the cake I baked for my husband's birthday. I followed the recipe word to word. I felt it needed more cocoa. So added more. The taste is divine. The cake is very light and keeps well in the fridge too. Love it love it love it."
"0","5","so for the first time ever i tried a cake from scratch. this recipe was great so easy to make . i made it cupcakes but they came out so moist and good, it was awesome. also did a vanilla frosting from scratch and the whole thing was good. my dad gave me a 7 out of 10 and thats a remarkable review. try it . easy as pudding"

"0","5","This was the best chocolate cake I have ever baked. I have tried a lot of recipies and they always turned out dry. This cake was so moist and very easy to make. This will be my go to chocolate cake."
"0","5","This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have found. Once it has cooled completely, it doesn't even need frosting- so rich and moist."
"0","5","This is my go to now for Chocolate cakes or cupcakes! I follow the directions exactly (except a little less cooking time for cupcakes) and the results are always devoured quickly!"
"0","5","This is a no fail recipe!!! Delicious!"

"0","5","I love it and I don't even like chocolate cake!"
"0","5","This was so moist and kinda dense but so good! I was leery when it said add boiling water to the mixture with the raw egg, I immediately thought ahhhhh! Scrambled eggs! But this was perfect. I read the comments and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup and it was great. Its very rich so I think next time I'll do a cream cheese icing to break up the sweetness."
"0","5","Perfect and stores nicely."
"0","5","Had to use coffee in place of water to give better flavor"
"0","5","Delicious cake and easy! I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake was perfect. This will be my go to recipe now for chocolate layer cake."
"0","5","This is an awsome chocolate cake ... I have replaces it with my grammies recipe .. that really says something . Yummmm! I make it for all special occasions now ... this is the 2nd yr. My niece has wanted it for her bday."
"0","5","What a great and easy recipe. I replaced the vegetable oil and milk with the same amounts of Plain Whole Yogurt (Sugar River Dairy out of Albany, WI), using the same amounts....  I also halved the sugar, added 3/4c. of Burgundy Chocolate pieces and to give it a Mexican spin, I added 1 1/2tsp. of Pampered Chef's Cinnamon blend and 1 tsp Cayenne pepper...my friends were raving at the decadent outcome! :)  ...Also topped with Sugar River Dairy's Vanilla Yogurt"
"0","5","It was an awesome recipe! I put sees candy on top for decoration. It looks wonderful and tastes awesome"
"0","5","Easy to make and very good! I cooked it in a sheet pan and cooked for 40 minutes. This recipe is a keeper for sure."
"0","5","This will be my go to chocolate cake from now on!!!"

"0","5","This cake came out awesome, of course! :)"
"0","5","Been using this recipe for my client and they are happy with the orders. Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","Fabulous easy recipe to make  With my 4 year old grand-daughter But is great enough for me to repeat  Even without her :)"
"0","5","I have made this recipe many times. If ever I'm making a chocolate cake, this is the recipe I use. It is delicious as written, however I am making this for a wedding next week and tried substituting brewed coffee for the boiling water and it was even better! A couple of people who tasted it are not 'cake people' and decided it's not that they don't like cake, it's that they like good cake. They said this cake is delicious! My husband, who is not a cake person, said it was the best cake he's ever tasted."
"0","5","i ;ove this recipe"
"0","5","Really easy to prepare and tasted great!"
"0","1","It had literally no flavor and it was too moist to cut like a normal cake."
"0","5","Oh..this recipe is awesome. Tried it out and frosted it with a vanilla butter cream frosting.My family and friends loved it!"
"0","5","This cake is a hit everytime I bake it! The only change I make is, instead of boiling water, I use brewed coffee. Yummy!"
"0","5","Absolutely LOVE this recipe, and it is now my only chocolate cake recipe, I make it mostly in cupcake portions.  GORGEOUS"
"0","5","I love this recipe! The best chocolate cake I have ever had. I didn't have regular cake pans so I used a Bundt pan instead. And I topped it off with chocolate chips! The whole family loves this cake."
"0","5","This recipe was simply amazing, that is the only word to describe it"
"0","5","Perfect!"
"0","5","Very easy recipe to follow. Everyone loved it! Very moist and flavorful. Added the whipped creme cheese frosting with shaved chocolate as a garnish. This cake will satisfy anyone's craving for chocolate. Loved the fact that you only use one bowl to mix everything. I was a little nervous about the boiling water, but the layers were nice and fluffy. I used 2 - 9 inch round cake pans lined with wax paper. I sprayed the pans first with Pam and then inserted the wax paper. The batter was very thin. Once the layers were cool, removed the wax paper to continue to cool. Allow layers to cool completely before frosting. Made cake a day ahead and stored in refrigerator. Excellent!"
"0","5","This is an amazing cake recipe! Its fluffy, moist, and tastes great!! We've made this cake several times and it always turns out good :-) thanks for the recipe Shirleyo!"
"0","5","This recipe is very good and truly satisfied my chocolate craving"
"0","5","it is very good!"
"0","5","Very good cake, and definitely making it again. I usually change the white sugar for brown one, but this time I only had half portion of the brown sugar so had to add the rest of white one. Came equally good and sweet for my husband and myself. Next time will try with just brown sugar and substitute oil for yogurt."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. Easy to make and always turns out great!"
"0","4","it is moist , rich , and delicious .. the cake is quite dense & fudgy. This is a deep, dark chocolate cake, but while this was a very good cake, I'll stick with the other because i think not suitable for every time."
"0","4","I made this cake last night, my kids were very reluctant to eat it because I don't know how to bake. To my great surprise not only did the cake turn out great, but my kids ate it all in one night. Thank you for such a great recipe."
"0","5","Taste like chocolate cake with chocolate pudding, but without the pudding! Really good cake, will make again. Made recipe as is, but with 1 cup of cocoa like one other review!"
"0","4","Super easy to make! My cakes did not rise in the middle so I just ran a wire across to level for stacking. I let cakes cool 10 minutes before removing them and had no problems. I did as others suggested and increased cocoa to 1 cup. It tastes like a chocolate wafer and is so dense and moist! I have the cakes chilling in the fridge and am going to top with vanilla butter cream frosting. I would make this cake again!"
"0","5","Perfection! I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but the cake came out of the pans easily and was not too soft. I baked them in the evening. I put them in plastic wrap and frosted them in the morning. I prefer to frost cake when the layers are cold since it makes it so easy.   I made a beautiful two layer cake with this cake. Yum! My go to recipe."
"0","5","Absolutely delish!! Only baked for 30 min-very moist. Used 1 cup of cocoa powder. Will definitely make this again!!"
"0","5","This was an absolute wonderful, easily made chocolate cake. I would recommend this recipe to everyone!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice now...and it has been a huge hit. People can't believe that it's homemade. It's moist and rich and perfect. My family loves it!"
"0","5","To be honest, I personally thought that the mix was too watery the minute I added the boiling water. Surprisingly, It came out great! It was a nice moist cake. Delicious! It was so good my family had no trouble at all licking the bowl! This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe there is!"
"0","5","This is a really great basic chocolate cake recipe. I've made it as cupcakes and as a layer cake and it worked well both ways. It's soft and moist, not dense or dry like some homemade cakes tend to be."
"0","5","I increased the cocoa to 1 cup and used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. I also have hungry teenagers so waiting 30 minutes wad too long. We make mini individual 'cup' cakes by greasing a large ceramic cup or bowl and microwaving it for 1-1 1/2 minutes. A little powdered sugar on top....makes a nice snack cake."
"0","5","It was amazing. So moist and fudgy. I was making this for a birthday party for the fisrt time. Im not afraid to take risks and everyone loved it. I like that it does not use that much flour and does not use any butter so that i can leave that for the frosting. Its also easy to make and very quick. This is the best cake i have ever tried. Wish i could give it 100,000 stars"
"0","5","This was easy fast and tasted great my 99 year old great grandmother who I would have to say is a chocolate expert loved it and eat two pieces as soon as it was all dune. ... I did take the suggestion with the cocoa powder and add a cup...."
"0","5","I made this recipe for my Dad's 80th birthday and he loved it. I had no vegetable oil, so I just melted a stick of margarine and that worked fine! My family is already petitioning for me to make another cake!"
"0","5","Delicious!!!! My family loved this cake. It was moist with a rich chocolate flavor. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","This is the only chocolate cake recipe i ever use now but instead of semisweet i use dark cocoa and it is amazing. But yeah this one is great and real good with dark chocolate cream cheese frosting"
"0","5","This is the easiest, best chocolate cake I have ever made! Moist, chocolaty,rich. I added a great chocolate butter cream frosting for a perfect desert."
"0","5","Made it twice with DUCK eggs instead of chicken eggs. It WAS AWSOME !"
"0","1","This recipe isn't the greatest. The cake is dry and spongy- not the greatest flavor either. It DOES NOT come out of the pan."
"0","5","This is my favourite chocolate cake recipe ever!! I've never used cake mixes, I admit, but I've tried lots of different chocolate cake's such as butter chocolate cake's and other things like that, and they were never fully up to my satisfaction. They were often dry and they hardened up in the fridge which made them even drier. When I tried this recipe I was doubtful, BUT!!!! it came out amazing!! It was gone in a few hours. This is my go to recipe for chocolate cake. Since it's oil based, it stay's moist and is so delicious. I will never go to another recipe for chocolate cake."
"0","3","Easy to make but really difficult to frost because it was so crumbly. Taste was pretty average nothing special!"
"0","5","This is a very good, very chocolatey cake! I've made it 4 times now and it has been perfect every time! For those of you who are on a gluten free diet ... I needed a gluten free dessert to take to a dinner, this worked great! I substituted the regular flour with King Arthur Gluten Free flour and added slightly more than 1 1/2 teaspoons of xanthan gum powder (for better texture)and it came out great! I couldn't tell a difference. (The xanthan gum will make the batter thicker & not as thin as the regular batter. I also prepared the cake pan with the gluten free flour.) Yes it is the same recipe on the Hershey's Cocoa can & I used the frosting recipe on the cocoa can, it was delicious also! I don't currently have a coffee maker so I put some instant coffee granules in the cup of boiling water. This will be my 'go to' chocolate cake recipe from now on!"
"0","5","In my opinion this recipe is worth doing over and over again although i do make one change i only use half of the sugar. my whole family absolutely adores this recipe. Thnx"
"0","5","I tried this recipe twice.made cupcakes for my niece son's bday. I don't have regular milk so I used evaporated milk. It came out moist and will bake it again."
"0","5","Moist and chocolaty. Easy to put together."
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic i used it for the fourth of July and my whole family loved it, they are telling me to make it again today.....I added 1 tsp of instant coffee and it tasted amazing. The cake came out very moist that my sister thought it was a box cake"
"0","2","Terrible as a cupcake. Overflowed everywhere. As a regular cake, it worked just fine."
"0","5","My family loves this cake and have been asking me to make it again for a while now. I have found that this tastes great with a peanut butter frosting layer in between the two layers of cake with chocolate frosting on the outside. Heaven on earth."
"0","5","This right here! This recipe right here! It is the best hands down basic chocolate cake recipe, you do not need to look any further. Easy to make, and bakes up very nicely as a 13x9 cake. Frost it up, scoop out your portion and sit down for a relaxing evening dessert! You will not be disappointed!"
"0","2","After an hour and five minutes in the oven, I was able to feel confident that this was a cake and not soup. Still a little too moist in the middle but I was able to invert onto a large plate without any mess or crumbling. The cake was very spongy looking. I left it be for about ten minutes to cool and came back to a huge crack down the middle. I started to ice the cake but it was still too warm so I let it cool in front of our AC for about ten minutes. I cut off two pieces for my husband and myself to try. I iced the pieces individually with homemade peanut butter frosting. The cake itself didn't taste like much of anything and seemed under done everywhere but the very edges witch were crunch. I do not plan on making this cake again. -Larissa"
"0","5","Awesome most cake! Saving this recipe!"
"0","5","This cake was amazing and easy!! Everyone loved it!! I had it right out of the oven and it was ewooo! Baking soda but left over night and beautiful !"
"0","5","I absolutely LOVED this recipe!! And yeah the batter is super thin, but it turns out delicious!! I put fresh raspberries inside and made a raspberry frosting, and it was to die for!! Definitely going to be my go to recipe!"
"0","5","My whole family loves this cake! I found it and made it for my sons first birthday and just made it for his 3rd birthday! It works great as a layer cake with peanut butter frosting and chocolate shavings in the middle and buttercream frosting on the outside! I'm making it again today for my daughters first birthday with cream cheese frosting! So easy and comes out perfect every time!"
"0","5","I thought this cake was great. I was worried about the soup it turned into before putting it in the oven, but wow. I did up the cocoa just because I am a chocoholic and always do. Also, we are very big on nutritious foods, so even 'junk' food gets a healthy upgrade here. I used coconut oil in place of oil, and it did not give it a coconut taste as an FYI. I used coconut milk in place of regular milk, and 1/4 c egg whites instead of an egg. I made my own butter frosting, which I did tweak to make healthier than a standard. That came out good, but I am not 100 % happy with it, so I won't share until I have it right."
"0","5","very soft and moist.. perfect for bday :)"
"0","5","I used a cupcake pan and sprinkle with powdered sugar and topped with strawberries! My family loved them!"
"0","1","I baked the in 9' pans as recommended and they made an awful mess all over the oven and the house smelled awful."
"0","4","Made as a cake first and was delicious...moist and great flavor. I did use hald the recommended vanilla and sub 1/4 tsp. almost extract for the other half. My kids loved it so much they ate it before I even had time to frost. I tried to make the second batch as cupcakes...that didn't work so well. Taste was off and they were a little flat. Otherwise so delicious!"
"0","5","I used this recipe to make cupcakes! The best cupcakes I've ever made. I didn't have any vanilla though but it didn't bother the taste. So dense and moist! My new favorite. No more boxed cake in this house."
"0","5","This cake was absolutely delicious and quick to make! I added chocolate chips to mine too."
"0","5","The cake itself was amazing!!!!! You need to keep the cake in the pan for the entire 10 minutes or else it is still hot and mine crumbled. When making the batter, after including the hot water, it looks like a pudding almost and is VERY moist. I used the chocolate cake with buttercream frosting and it was fantastic. I would highly suggest this to a friend!!!!"
"0","5","What a great recipe! I followed it exactly and the cake came out so moist and chocolatey, but not overbearing. Awesome!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Turns out perfect with the right shiny texture on top...the first couple of times I halved th portion and tried it.this time around I made it in two pans...turned out great and junior who is my official taster loved it. I watched the video and found it useful.I used hersheys cocoa and had to bake abt 45 min. This is definitely my go-to chocolate cake recipe now,quick and fool proof.I haven't tried icing it yet."
"0","2","Very doughy"
"0","5","I got a hankering for some chocolate cake the other night. I have always always been a box lady. Well last night the urge didn't stop. I knew I had Caco and I said, I'm going to make a chocolate cake. Got to mixing then realized I didn't have any milk. i wanted this so bad I went and bought the milk came home an dmade this cake. All I can say is * I WILL ALWAYS MAKE THIS CHOCOLATE CAKE*, it came out PERFECT. My first time not getting a hard crust. not not overly sickening sweet chocolate. Just absolute perfect. Love the quickness and it's so good."
"0","5","This is by far the best chocolate cake ever! I read the reviews and added the additional cocoa to total 1 cup. Also due to allergy's I used coconut milk. I couldn't wait for it to cool down!! I will never make another recipe!"
"0","5","The cake turned out lovely, it was so soft and moist! Everybody in my house loved it =)"
"0","5","Would a chocolate butter cream go good with this or too much."
"0","5","Easy and great flavor. Only thing i changed, I use hot coffee instead of hot water."
"0","5","I think it was fantastic. I halved the sugar, upped eggs cacao to one cup as suggested and then two tea spoons of instant espresso into the boiling water. I also substituted a tea spoon of vanilla for orange oil extract. Tasted just like Terry's orange dark chocolate balls. Fabulous basic recipe!"
"0","5","When I use the Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, I don't up the cocoa to a cup. The Dark Cocoa is much richer. And instead of 1 cup water, I add 1 cup coffee. This truly enhances the chocolate flavor."
"0","4","Great cake recipe. This will be my new go to recipe. I used it for Brown Derby Cake and it was perfect! I substituted butter for oil. I will bump up cocoa to 1 cup next time."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, this cake is perfect!! I was quite leary of the thinness of the batter, but it baked up so light and fluffy, and despite it's whopping two cups of sugar, is not actually too sweet! So often home-made, from-scratch chocolate cakes are dense, flavorless doorstops. Not this cake! It tastes chocolatey and airy, like a boxed cake mix without all the preservatives, not to mention it is incredibly easy and fast to make. Two thumbs up!"
"0","5","Made this for my twins 2 yr old birthday party (along with a yellow cake receipe). This cake was hands down fabulous (moist and tasty) and better than the yellow cake one I made off wiltons' website. Followed the receipe exactly. the only downside was the outside of cake was sticky (because it was moist) so a bit hard to ice."
"0","5","yummy delicious. Used half brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp of vinegar. It was delicious with chocolate butter cream icing."
"0","5","I made this cake for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it. I usually don't care much for chocolate cake but this was the best I have ever tasted. It was really moist and chocolaty and very easy to make. I baked it for 35 minutes and frosted it with chocolate cream cheese icing."
"0","5","Flawless moist chocolate ever! You cant go wrong with the recipe."
"0","5","I just baked my first cake from scratch yesterday and I used this recipe. I must say, it was amazing!!!!! The cake was moist and flavorful. I baked a chocolate cake for my wife for mothers day and she absolutely loved it. She was shocked I made something this good. :) It came out perfect and the recipe is written to where any one can follow it and produce superior results every time!"
"0","5","This is by far the most delicious cake I have ever made. I was a bit hesitant to make a cake from scratch, but I decided to give it a try, and I am glad I did! It was delicious and moist with a very chocolatey flavour. I used a chocolate buttercream icing, and it was great! Everyone loved it! Best cake I have ever tasted, I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!"
"0","5","Delicious! Halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes (~30min baking time). Also, I used 1/2 a cup of cocoa powder (instead of 1/4 cup and 2 teaspoons). Thank you!"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous chocolate cake recipe...and pair it with the fluffy bp frosting and they're just aren't words to describe the yumminess that occurs!! After reading reviews I did use strong coffee instead of plain boiling water. I will never use another chocolate cake recipe again!"
"0","5","This is so moist! super easy and amazing delicious. Everyone was asking me how i made it! haha"
"0","5","Made cupcakes as directed. Amazing! I topped these with a popular chocolate frosting from this site and even stuffed some with frozen cookie dough. I made these for my sons first birthday, everyone was talking about them. My husband took leftovers to work and I think everyone fell in love with me."
"0","5","This cake was delicious!It was sweet and moist. I made this recipe in a 9X5 loaf pan and it came out great. So far, this is the best chocolate cake recipe I've made."
"0","5","For my lower carb needs adjusted as follows:  Flour 50/50 whole-wheat/buck-wheat Baking powder instead of Soda, using baking powder/soda conversion (3x more baking powder) 1/2 the sugar (makes it not very sweet, but with icing,"
"0","5","This is my go to chocolate cake! It is so moist and delicious, and pretty sturdy for icing. I usually make it with a simple powdered sugar vanilla icing and it stays fresh for days. It is so easy to make but good enough for a special occasion like a birthday - I made it for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake I had ever made."
"0","5","This was my first time making this recipe. It came out amazing, and I don't even like chocolate cake!"
"0","5","This is by far one of the best homemade cake recipes I've ever tested. The cake came out perfect, and was nice and moist. I didn't change anything. My daughter hates homemade cakes, she prefers box cakes. Today she asked me to make this cake for her b-day next year! I used chocolate ganache as my filling and chocolate buttercream for my frosting."
"0","5","I used this to make come chocolate cupcake a while back. I was a little worried at first when the batter got so thin after adding the water but they came out beautifully. This is just as easy as using a box mix but your result is SO MUCH BETTER! Thanks shirleyo!!"
"0","5","best easiest cake ever! making it again for the second time!"
"0","5","love it i have used this recipe several times and its always a big hit ppl love how moist it is"
"0","5","Made this for the first time on my boyfriend's birthday. It turned out amazing and everyone was raving about it for days!"
"0","5","It was amazing! It was so delicious and I made this for Easter! People said that I was an amazing baker but the it was really the recipe! It's tasted so good because it left a nice chocolate taste in your mouth! This is a amazing recipe, I'm even considering making this for Christmas!"
"0","5","Easy to make, and tasted great. A nice moist chocolate cake."
"0","5","Great as cupcakes!"
"0","5","Speechless.. I'm not much of a cake person.. Well, I wasn't until I made this one, love it! I didn't change a thing...I will try the extra cocoa next time..."
"0","5","Good recipe! By the way, this recipe is found on the back of a can of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa."
"0","5","Considering I can NOT cook, I made this and my husband said 'wow this is actually eatable, did you make this!!!' and 'best cake you have ever made!' I put whipped cream with caramel bits in the middle to join two cakes, was much better after been in fridge for 1 hour"
"0","5","First non boxed chocolate cake that my family actually loves! It is super moist. I baked it as both a double layer cake and a as cupcakes- both came out moist and delicious!"
"0","5","This was good - I halved the recipe and it turned out just fine."
"0","5","Simple and easy with ingredients commonly found in my pantry and refrigerator...and the result was a very moist and flavorful cake!"
"0","5","Super chocolaty, nice and moist, easy-breezy to make! Throw away those boxes, people! You'll never go back to Betty Crocker after making this recipe. Dangerously good...."
"0","5","Outstanding as written Seriously one of the best I've made for being so simple. Like a brownie with the texture of moist cake. Thank you ;) Yum!!"
"0","5","Best cake ever!"
"0","5","I really like this recipe! I added a full cup of cocoa the second time and I think that really did the magic touch the extra oomph! Lol anyway thank you it is a helpful dish that I use now to make chocolate cake! Happy baking!"
"0","5","I wanted a simple cake recipe that I could make without a major shopping trip. I saw this recipe and thought, why not??? I found the recipe very easy and had all the ingredients in my pantry. After reading the reviews I opted to increase the cocoa to 1 cup. The only complaint I have is that it would not come out of my pan... I used a bundt pan and baked it for 30 minutes and left it in the oven an additional 10 minutes after shutting the oven off. I let it cool almost 20 minutes before trying to get it out of the pan and the top still stuck, I prepped the pan like I do any other cake pan. After I frosted it though you couldn't even tell it broke. My husband ate 1/3 in the first sitting. This is a very rich, dense cake and the flavor was spectacular. I didn't use anything fancy, I even used a generic cocoa powder. Very simple and easy... I will defiantly make this cake again!"
"0","5","I give this recipe a 6! I am not a chocolate cake lover, but I fell in love with this recipe. I used a regular easy icing to cover the whole cake and a a chocolate mascoponi chocolate frosting between the layers and for fancy decorating. Decorated with strawberries as well . It was Devine! Followed the recipe exactly! It turned out better than a shop bought cake. The best part was how easy and fuss free it was, and the taste was superb.   This is definitely a keeper and the type of recipe that will be handed down to family and friends. Thanks so much for sharing."
"0","4","Followed the original recipe with no amendments. Very simple to bake and can be done within 10 min. The texture of the cake is moist, however I find it a little dense. It went well with peanut butter frosting."
"0","5","Just baked it! Turned out spongy and yummy! I used a silicon mould and a non stick one, didn't greese and was easy to remove both cakes. I didn't have milk, so I used 3 tbsp of powdered milk with a cup of water. Definitely you have to let it cool for hours b4 eating. It's a bit dry, so I'm thinking about a soft frost. :)"
"0","5","Made this twice.. But used one cup of cocoa ... It's perfect ..."
"0","5","I never thought that even I could bake a cake so well that no one could resist.  This is just an awesome yet a very quick and easy recipe to try. Just loved it :)"
"0","5","OMG!!! I just loooovvvvedddd this recipe!!! The only thing I did differently though was keep it in the oven a little bit longer. (40ish minutes) But besides that it was amazing! The cake was veerrry moist and delicious!! I HIGHLY recommend this!!"
"0","5","I was shocked at how easy it was to make. I've only made a cake out of a box before this. I did this as a surprise for my wife's birthday. We both loved it. Very moist cake but not overly rich. If you like more chocolate flavor add more cocoa powder. I did add a little orange zest to the batter because I like that flavor with chocolate. I will do this one again!"
"0","5","Excellent!!"
"0","1","followed this to the tee and ended up with dry tasteless chunks that stuck to my non-stick pan!"
"0","5","BEST CAKE EVER! This cake has ruin me on any chocolate cake i could buy in a store. :) I uped the cocoa powder to 1cup!"
"0","5","I tried this and added about half a cup extra of cocoa. It turned out pretty awesome! I made some homemade icing to go with it. 3 cups powdered sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa, a stick of softened butter, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup of milk. I cook a lot but never tried baking anything so this was my first baking experience. I must say I was very pleased with myself and how it turned out!!"
"0","5","Couldn't be easier or more delicious! Followed recipe exactly as written. I used mini bundt pans and baked for 20 minutes. Very moist and chocolatey. Someone mentioned that is even better the second day and I would agree."
"0","5","My first cake from scratch, and I LOVE this recipe! Someone else mentioned it's not great for layer cakes. That is correct - it's spongy, moist and wonderfully squishy, so perhaps a recipe with more flour or butter instead of oil is advisable for a sturdier cake that doesn't become a squishy mess when you try to cut it. I however, love my cake that way! :)"
"0","5","Delicious!!! The only alteration I did was instead of 1 cup of boiling water I did 1/2 cup of boiling water and 1/2 cup of freshly brewed coffee."
"0","5","I made this cake and took it to work and the staff love it. But before that my wife tasted the cake and ran to the shelfto see if it used the box cake."
"0","5","This is the best cake recipe that I ever had. Thank you very much. It's very easy to prepare and incredibly tasty."
"0","5","BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!! :D thanks for sharing Shirleyo!!!"
"0","5","Super no fail recipe !! A regular in our house"
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for chocolate cake. I use it to make cupcakes and they always receive rave reviews. They are rich and moist and go great with Peanut Butter Frosting."
"0","5","This cake was delicious! So tasty and soft and super easy to make. I used melted butter instead of oil and took the recommendations from other reviews to up the cocoa. Also, I used a hand whisk as I do not have an electric mixer and the batter was just fine. I was able to layer the two cakes with vanilla frosting with no issues."
"0","5","I absolutely love this recipe! I am eating right now. Very simple to make, very great tasting. Very good! :)"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous My family loves dessert - especially chocolate cake. I seriously doubt this 9' cake could serve 24 people! I doubled the recipe and got 28 servings from an 11x17' pan. I used 5 cups of flour, and used hot coffee instead of hot water. I also added 1 tbsp of cinnamon,3/4 cup brown sugar, coffee creamer instead of milk, and added 1/4 cup orange zest. I greased and floured an 11'x17' and baked the cake at 355 degrees for 55 minutes. This is an awesome cake, especially when frosted with peanut butter/chocolate frosting (a family favorite)! For my version of this recipe check my recipe box!"
"0","1","This was not a good cake to make a layer cake out of. It was extremely difficult to get out of the cake pan. | made the cake twice thinking I may have made an error in the recipe but it came out just as bad the second time."
"0","4","I've got this IDENTICAL recipe in the crockpot right now! Exact same ingredients! Can't rate it yet because it's still cooking--but check under Amazing Slow Cooker Chocolate Cake to learn how to bake it in the crockpot! Too funny!"
"0","5","Without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever made. The recipe is as simple as a box mix, very quick and easy. Don't be afraid of how water-y it is when you put it in the oven. Because of the deep pans I use (6x3in) I use a lower baking heat (325) and longer baking time, about 40-45 minutes. Came out moist and dense. It is a bit crumbly when it initially comes out but like all cakes, I out mine in plastic wrap, then the freezer for a few hours."
"0","5","Amazing! This recipe was so easy to assemble! I added melted white chocolate on top after the cake cooled which was absolutely delicious. The cake baked nicely and tastes absolutely amazing! Cheers to the moist cake, you can't go wrong with this recipe!"
"0","5","I just made this but realized I forgot to add the oil! It still turned out really moist though."
"0","5","INCREDIBLE! This cake was delicious! Moist, rich, and hits the spot. For chocolate lovers only. The frosting was to die for. I made this on Saturday and my husband has already asked when I will be making another and it's only Monday! :)"
"0","5","This was the best cake I ever made. I upped the cocoa to 1 cup as someone else said to do...it was great. Thanks for the information."
"0","5","This recipe is great! I searched the comments to see if anyone had made it with almond milk no luck :(  I decided to try it anyway and it turned out great!!  If your going to layer it be sure that you let it cool completely so it does not fall apart when you pick it up."
"0","5","the best cake yyyymmmmmmm"
"0","3","I've made 'one bowl' chocolate cakes before and they turned out pretty good but for some reason this one had a bizarre aftertaste. Not sure if it was the cocoa - I used Tollhouse cocoa, brand new/fresh. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm a bit confused what kind of cocoa was implied here though - I believe the one I used was regular cocoa, not Dutch-processed, but with regular cocoa you use baking SODA to neutralize the acid and with Dutch-processed you use baking POWDER, yet this recipe uses BOTH. Why? Not sure. In any event, the cake had a decent texture but the aftertaste ruined it. Sad as I made it as a birthday cake."
"0","5","The best and easiest chocolate cake I have ever made, and all in one bowl!!! I followed the recipe exactly , EXCEPT followed the suggestion of reviewers and upped the cocoa to one cup. Delicious and moist and keeps well, not sure why others had such trouble with it and over flowing ."
"0","3","I tried this recipe for cupcakes. They were very moist however they fell when cooling. It could have been my baking powder was too old, didn't think so, they other issue could have been oven temp but just had the oven repaired and temp has been perfect. I can try again as a cake but definitely a no for cupcakes!"
"0","5","ITS THE GREATEST CAKE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","I've been looking for a perfect chocolate cake recipe and has yet to find one until this! One thing I changed was, I mixed the boiling water with 1.5 teaspoon instant coffee. Now, my search is over!"
"0","4","It is a good recipe, and it should be because it is from the back of Hershey's cocoa powder."
"0","5","This is the best Chocolate Cake I have ever made! I served it at a dinner party and all the guests thought it was a boxed cake mix! This recipe is definitely a keeper."
"0","5","I have made this cake SO MANY TIMES! It has never failed. It's moist and so chocolatey! My favorite thing about this cake, though, is how well it holds together. It never falls apart when I take it out of the pan. I can pick it up with my hands and it stays together. It's great for making tiered or specially shaped cakes. My favorite way to make it though is with cream cheese frosting and a raspberry filling. I never alter the recipe and it always cooks perfectly!"
"0","5","I went with the added advice of a full cup of cocoa and instant coffee to the boiling water. I've NEVER made such perfect - moist - delicious cake! I also did the 9x13 pan for 40 minutes. Even with the store bought frosting that I had on hand - the cake was memorable. My future son-in-law had 3 very large pieces!"
"0","5","I do a lot of baking and this is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I have come across. It's very easy to make- not much harder than using a mix from a box (but oh so much better)! I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.  As other reviewers have said, do not be turned off by the thin batter. It's SUPPOSED to be that way. The water is what makes this cake so incredibly moist.  For a frosting recipe, I took the advice of another reviewer who provided her grandmother's chocolate frosting recipe to go with this cake. It's review #13 on this page. I give the frosting 5 stars as well!"
"0","5","This is our favorite, exactly as written."
"0","5","Excellent recipe...I added a simple glaze of sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and a little water, that I put on top and this recipe turned out wonderful...5 stars from me:)"
"0","3","Ok, not really special. Made according to recipe. Turned out dry and not extremely chocolaty as I expected. It was easy to put together but won't go out of my way to make again."
"0","4","It is a rich and dense cake, and like other reviewers, I found it a bit tricky to stack as a layer cake because it was just so moist and heavy, but I was able to keep it together in the end. I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond extract, and I used half almond milk and half dairy milk. It gave it a darker, more exotic flavor. By far the best tasting chocolate cake I've made."
"0","2","Well I messed up that rating! I meant to say that it was okay but I didn't really like the texture. It tasted fake."
"0","5","Good and very easy. Make sure to grease the pan very well."
"0","5","Love this cake! So moist and easy to make, my new favorite."
"0","5","Love this recipe. Made a 2nd time with Irish Cream substitute for Milk. Amazing!!"
"0","5","This was a great cupcake project for my 7 year old daughter. She made the batter practically by herself. The runny batter made it a little messy when filling the cupcake liners but still a success. After baking we cut the tops to make them level with the liners. She frosted and decorated on her own. It was very easy and quite an accomplishment for her!"
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful! The best chocolate cake I have ever made. I made it in a 9x13 pan and frosted it while it was still a little warm (with store-bought frosting!) and the frosting just melted and made a very rich, fudgy cake. I kept it in the fridge and was just as delicious for the next couple of days until it was gone!"
"0","5","Whipped this cake up as an impromptu dessert this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. This recipe produced a decadent, moist cake that my family and I greatly enjoyed. As per other reviewers, I did have a bit of a problem with one of them sticking to the pan despite being properly greased. In the future I will line with parchment for easier removal. Awesome cake! Highly recommend!"
"0","2","To be honest I was expecting completely a different cake... I made it twice, thinking that maybe I did something wrong the first time, but no. It is just not my type of cake. It comes out too spongey, like it is made of rubber or missing baking powder... The taste is not that great ether... It lacks chocolate in my opinion. Thank god my boyfriend would eat anything..."
"0","5","This is a great chocolate cake recipe! Absolutely nothing to complain about. It's easy to make, stays moist for several days, and most importantly, it tastes very good. The recipe is perfect exactly as written."
"0","5","I have tried other cake recipes and usually they come out dry or without good flavor. This one was great! Very moist and tasted delicious. I made a homemade chocolate peanut butter icing and it was perfect."
"0","2","Batter was too thin with the boiling water. Cake came out flat, like a chocolate, moist cookie. Tasted ok, but not suitable for guests!"
"0","5","I love love love this cake. I've made it 4 times since I found you recipe."
"0","5","I have made this twice now and everybody loves it including me! I am going to try it a third time with a peanut butter filing. Excited to see the outcome."
"0","5","Delicious and moist! I also upped the cocoa to 1 full cup and it was amazing even without frosting! Now I need to find a great frosting recipe to go with."
"0","5","This is the best."
"0","5","i used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup of Forty Creek cream liquor (wiskey based) tastes like baileys but better, and oh man was the cake epic."
"0","5","Great recipe! Instead of cake form however, I halved the ingredients and made 12 deliciously moist and fluffy cupcakes. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get unsweetened cocoa powder so I used hot chocolate mix and it turned out great (you can lessen the sugar if you use hot chocolate mix). Do not worry about the watery consistency, it'll turn out great in the end!"
"0","5","I'll never make a boxed chocolate cake again! This was my first attempt at a cake from scratch and I'm so thankful it was with this recipe and I wouldn't change a thing about it, it was perfect, moist and even better the next day. Thanks so much!!!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! If you use self rising flour vs all purpose (which is what I done) cut out the salt & baking soda. I also added 8oz of cream cheese! Frosted with a chocolate cream cheese frosting. Devine! The cream cheese cuts down the sweetness just enough for those who fuss things are too sweet, but not too much for the sweet lovers! It's a win win!"
"0","5","This cake is great! It is quick and easy and Hard to do wrong. I even substituted the all-purpose flour with gluten-fee flour with no problems at all!"
"0","5","Pretty good cake, only thing I change was I didn't the hot water. I used one cup of strong coffee."
"0","4","I made this in a bundt pan with a chocolate glaze. Very pretty and tasty. Glad the recipe mentioned that the batter is thin or I would have been worried. I cooked it for about 50 minutes to ensure it was done."
"0","5","Mine came out perfectly moist. I loved it! It goes very well with the Chocolate Butter cream Frosting that is also found on this website."
"0","5","This cake was amazing! I doubled the recipe and made it into a triple layer cake for my sister's birthday, and it turned out wonderfully!"
"0","5","I made this cake just as the recipe states and got rave reviews from all fellow staff members. Of course they all want the recipe now:)"
"0","5","Perfect, easy and quick! I even substituted some ingredients to make a healthier virgin. Whole wheat flour for white flour. Instead of 2 cups sugar, one and a half cup honey. I didn't even have baking soda so I added an extra half spoon baking powder and didn't fill the one cup oil to th brim, cause honey had a lot of liquid. And like other reviewers said I put 1 cup cocoa and it was perfect."
"0","5","Very moist! My entire family loved this cake."
"0","5","This was so delicious. After adding the boiling water the batter was so thin I thought for sure it wouldn't turn out but it wound up being fantastic. I used a 13 x 9 cake pan, greased but not floured and baked it for about 35 minutes. I was nervous after reading the negative reviews but the taste and texture were perfect. My husband and I both agreed that it came out way better than a boxed mix."
"0","5","this is the recipe on the hershey cocoa can. i use buttermilk instead of milk, coffee instead of hot water and sprinkle cocoa powder instead of flour in the pans. it's so easy and delicious, people are always asking me to bring this cake to gatherings. if you're making cupcakes, make sure you barely fill with the batter, it does rise alot and will overflow your cupcake tins."
"0","5","I have been baking this cake recipe for years. I buy the Special dark cocoa. My company praise the cake every time. I suggest making your frosting from the recipe on the container instead of premade store boughten frosting. Much better"
"0","5","I had to make a cake at the last minute and this recipe was perfect. It took me no time to prepare using basically one bowl. I thought I may have ruined the recipe because I added the boiling water before I mixed all the other ingredients first, but it still turned our just beautiful. I frosted and filled the cake with a whipped cream chocolate icing. My guests loved it!"
"0","5","DÃ¶kk og djÃºsÃ­. Gerir tvo passlega botna. (Dark and juice. Makes two moves at a good bottom.)"
"0","5","It's in the oven cooking as we speak so hopefully it turns out but it smells amazing!! :)"
"0","5","It was very easy to make and bake and it was moist. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I stick the cake in the freezer straight from the oven. It turns out extremely moist. I also make a chocolate ganache to spread over the top once it's cooled. Best chocolate cake ever."
"0","5","This is the BEST cake chocolate cake recipe I have ever used!! Though Iwas kind of bummed when it crumbled out of the pan.. However, I don't blame the recipe.. it is just me. Anytime I bake a chocolate cake it never comes out of the pan in one piece [[this is only when I bake chocolate cake from scratch]] but I used this same recipes for cupcakes and they came out perfect!! No I have delicious cup cakes and cake crumbles for the beginnings of cake balls ;)"
"0","4","Great cake! Took advice, upped cocoa to one cup, added 1 tsp of coffee to boiling water. My cake was a bit overdone at 30 minutes, but my oven is hot. I generally need to reduce the cooking time. I halved the recipe, no problem. It needs a frosting, I used a Ree Drummond chocolate, pecan frosting made warn on stove and poured over the cake. I only had Hershey's cocoa on hand, but would use a higher quality cocoa next time., this recipe was on the back label. It would definitely be richer in taste using a higher end cocoa. Also loved that I had all ingredients in my pantry, no shopping required for this last minute cake for company. Served it with fresh raspberries, was a success."
"0","3","Bland taste, not enough chocolatey flvor. The texture and appearance were perfect and my cakes came out of the pans easily. However, the flavor was disappointing."
"0","5","I'm an accomplished cook and baker and this chocolate cake is absolutely fantastic. I bumped up the cocoa to 1 cup as other viewers recommended and it was delicious. I omitted all coffee since the people that were eating it don't care for coffee. Instead of a chocolate frosting I made a banana butter cream. Yum. Excellent recipe."
"0","4","Really light in texture, like a box cake but much better. A breeze to make."
"0","4","I was craving a good chocolate cake and saw this recipe. I loved that it took one bowl. I followed the directions exactly since I'd never made it before; however, I could't get it out of the pans in one piece. Forturnately I got enough out to try to layer it and since it was just for me, I didn't mind. I taste very delicious and was moist. I will probably try it again if I can figure out how to get it out of the pan in one piece."
"0","5","This is the BEST and easiest Chocolate Cake ever!!!. I cut the recipe in half and baked it in 2 6' wilton cake pans. Just my husband and I so a huge cake never gets eaten fast enough. I frosted just the top and middle with a chocolate ganache.. YUMMMY"
"0","5","Cupcakes: makes 24, even at filling only 1/2 full.... they still spilled over??? Grrrrr what a waste (tasted good though). When life gives you ugly cup cakes... you make cakeballs!!"
"0","5","Wonderful, moist and rich cake. I moved to South Africa and this cake can be made successfully with the ingredients available here in an oven that is sketchy compared to my American oven. Love it and I am so glad to be able to make a great cake again!!!"
"0","5","I made the recipe double! I poured some caramel in the holes when it was baked. My icing was whipped cream with chunks of Skors. The best cake ever!"
"0","5","So easy to make and tasted delicious. Less clean up too."
"0","5","Great recipe, I will increase the Choco powder about a Half cup next time but excellent recipe! I made a mocha Choco frosting for it - gone in 24hrs...."
"0","5","Very moist cake and delicious, it's good by itself, which is not very likely for a chocolate cake , I made in in 9*13 inches pan, bake for 40 min because it's I used pyrex and didn't preheat, I usually like cakes hot but not this one, after it gets cold put it in the fridge and then try to test it you won't regret!"
"0","5","was an excellent recipe from start to finish!!! SO easy to do, quick to make. There were no complaints from the family as I served this to them after dinner tonight....will make again. Isn't nothing wrong with a little sinful chocolate every now and again ;-) more soo with having this again. TY"
"0","5","I think this cake is just wonderful. I made it as is and it turned out perfect. I baked it in a 9 x 13 Pan for 40 minutes. This is my new quick chocolate cake. Thanks Shirleyo."
"0","4","Second Time Around we were lucky with this Cake. Lots of taste and good texture; Next time we will add some more flour, though, as we want it a bit less wet.  Our recommendation: Use the following Icing: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/one-minute-chocolate-icing/detail.aspx"
"0","5","This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe I have ever made. It was moist and delicious! I have baked it for alot of parties and people always beg for more! I always make my own butter cream icing to frost it. Its the cherry on top."
"0","3","I have made this cake twice. The first time everything came out great. This time, I made cupcakes and they were very dense and dry. I don't know if there was something I did wrong with the recipe or maybe this just doesn't work for cupcakes."
"0","5","Made this for my block party in a 9x13 pan and it was a big hit!"
"0","5","Great cake recipe. Easy to make.  In whose world does this make 24 servings? The nutritional information should be adjusted to use 12 servings."
"0","5","My two-year old made this cake and it turned out great. We altered the recipe in the following ways: 1) one heaping tablespoon of dry ingredients were removed from the mixing bowl, dumped on the counter, then scraped off the counter and returned to the bowl. 2) the vanilla was forgotten 3) the boiling water was added the the other ingredients before mixing, so that some of the eggs cooked onto the side of the mixer bowl. My husband swore it was ruined and it was still great! Talk about foolproof."
"0","5","This cake is delicious! I also used the buttercream frosting. My girls loved it."
"0","5","This recipe is super easy to make and it is very delicious. The cake turned out very moist and soft. I will not be using a cake mix ever again... the first time I made it, we eat it hot with ice cream and my family loved it. I was a little worried because I could taste the baking soda in it but the next day the taste was gone. Thanks  Shirley for the recipe!!!"
"0","5","After baking this cake, I will never need, nor would I ever want to buy a cake from a box again (or bakery for that matter). We tried this cake without any frosting at all that might disguise or enhance its flavor and it was everything a chocolate cake should be. Rich, moist, substantial, yet with a tender, spongy crumb. We increased the chocolate by 1/4 cup and used plain old water (no coffee on hand). Enjoy this recipe!"
"0","5","Amazing cake! I have now made this a few times, and it is always the most moist, flavourful cake I have ever had. It gets rave reviews from the other people eating it too. It looks like it's going to be too watery, but it's turns out perfect. I find it great for a tiered cake as it is firm enough to hold up to some extra weight but still delicious!"
"0","5","All I used was veg. Spray for the pan and cake came out of the pan like a charm! I can't wait till it cools so I can ice them and eat them!!"
"0","5","I halved the recipe and made cupcakes. So Good!!"
"0","5","Super easy, delicious. Everyone raved about it."
"0","5","I love this recipe it is so easy anyone can make it!! And it only takes one bowl too! So no mess. It is a very moist cake so you can leave it in too long but not too short either! Or else it falls apart! But I love this recipe it has become my main cake recipe"
"0","5","I love this recipe! I used it to make cupcakes for a church picnic, and they were gone fast! The cake was delicious and moist, and the peanut butter buttercream I made to go on top was, well the icing on the (already fantastic) cake...haha! And who cares if this is the recipe from the Hershey's Cocoa Can as others have pointed out, I wouldn't have found it there anyway since my cocoa isn't Hershey's... Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","5","Had to rush to make a cake for my son's birthday after realizing that a cake mix I had bought had sulphites in it which we are allergic to. This absolutely saved the day. I had all ingredients on hand and was whipped up in no time. I did use 1 cup of cocoa thanks to some suggestions of the reviewers. This will be my new go to recipe for birthday cakes since everyone wants chocolate on their birthdays. I topped it with the no boil chocolate fudge icing recipe from the Betty Crocker cookbook. Everyone loved it. It also tastes just as good the next day."
"0","5","Awesome, easy recipe that yields a delicious, light crumb cake with a beautiful dark color. The strategy that worked best for me was to make it and frost it two days before I wanted to serve it-- this gave it time to mature and become very moist. I have served it sooner but the cake seems drier and denser. I put it in a 9x13 pan but did need to bake it about 8 minutes longer than indicated in the recipe."
"0","5","This is the Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate' chocolate cake recipe. I've made this many times as cupcakes and it's very moist."
"0","5","Excellent cake!"
"0","5","My daughter wanted to make a cake from scratch...after trying to let me go buy her a box of cake mix, decided we would try this....sooo glad we did!! Easy and very moist! Topped with some cool whip icing and voilÃ , a get dessert! We used Nestle Quick because we didn't have unsweetened cocoa powder....still was great!"
"0","5","AMAZING!!! Used 1 c of cocoa powder (so 1/4 c more than the recipe specified). My family LOVED it!"
"0","5","I love this recipe and have been making this particular cake for years! I had found this exact SAME recipe on the back of a HERSHEY's Cocoa box several years ago. I give the RECIPE (and ONLY the recipe) a full 5 stars"
"0","5","I loved it, for now on will be my favorite chocolate cake recipe. I made it for my co-workers and they loved it!"
"0","5","easy and delicious!"
"0","5","Perfection! I have been making the same chocolate cake for seven years and it is so nice to find a recipe that works with my current recipe and is fantastic just the way it is. Moist and delicious. I can't wait to make it again:)"
"0","5","I really like this cake. I will never buy a boxed cake mix again. Delicious!!!!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe and I love it. I didn't change a thing and all I can say is 'yummy'. Thank You !!"
"0","5","this is sooooooo good.. I only added chocolate chips... great and quick"
"0","5","mmmm, really moist and tender and light!"
"0","5","I use this recipe all the time when I want to make cake and it has worked out for me every single time!"
"0","5","This is an excellent cake. I baked it in one 9'' tall pan and created 4 layers using a cake saw. I layered it with caramel pudding and minced nuts. I also moistened it with cocoa liquor for more flavour. Then I frosted it with whipped cream. In order to create a beautiful layered cake at home, the cake itself must be cold so that it does not melt the pudding inside. Really great base cake for layering."
"0","4","Almost perfection! I would have given 4.5 stars but that is not an option. The only reason I didn't rate this recipe 5 stars is because I would like it to be a tiny bit more moist. Other than that it was fantastic, this will be my chocolate cake recipe. And I loved the tip about adding a whole cup of cocoa, it was super chocolatey just like I like it."
"0","5","yummo"
"0","5","This cake is amazing!!! I bake it with wheat flour or replace it with gluten free flour. Every time comes out great!! I use german chocolate cake filling with it.... or just add some almond essence."
"0","5","Substituted 9 ounces melted chocolate (57% cocoa) for the cocoa, reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, and made into cupcakes. Scrumptious."
"0","5","We loved loved loved this recipe. We followed other reviewers suggestions and used a full cup of cocoa powder - this yields an excellent cake!"
"0","5","Best Cake EVER!"
"0","1","I made this recipe to spec with the exception of vanilla extract and I halved the portion to make a smaller cake. It was my moms birthday and I was hoping to surprise her with it when she got home from having lunch with a friend. The only thing I surprised her with was the horrific smell of burnt cake in the house, even though what came out of the oven hardly resembled anything close to a cake. I poured the batter into small, greased and flowered glass dishes, preheated the oven to the appropriate temperature, and took notice of the fact that as the recipe said, the batter is indeed very runny. I checked on it about every 5 - 10 minutes and after an hour, never came CLOSE to looking like anything other than soup with a thin layer of something that curdled and eventually burnt to a crisp floating on top... I'm like... 80% sure cake isn't supposed to curdle... I've botched recipes before by accident but not very often, and usually for being inattentive, but this is just insane, and it boggles the mind to look over the recipe trying to figure out where I went wrong and what kind of sorcery was being used by all the cooks who gave this 5 stars and experienced no difficulties. Any insights would be tremendously appreciated >."
"0","5","I made cupcakes from this recipe, and I have got to say that this is the best recipe for chocolate cake EVER. I baked them for 20 minutes and they turned out amazing! They were soft and moist and simply delicious. My family couldn't get enough!"
"0","5","I bake my cake in2 loaf pans, but every time I make it, the cakes never around more than a day. Everybody in my house loves the cake."
"0","5","This is my 'go-to' cake recipe for birthdays, thank you's, apologies and general sucking up. If you need a chocolate cake that rocks every body's socks, this is the one!"
"0","2","Definitely will not be making this again. I added 2 tablesspoons of flaxseed soaked in 2 tablespoons of water and I subbed applesauce for the oil...which I have done a million times and can never tell the difference. And subbed 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour...which could have made it so dense. It was VERY dense and had very little chocolate flavor...the frosting I put on it over powered any chocolate flavor in the cake and I was very generous with the cocoa powder and short on the sugar because we don't like things over sweet."
"0","4","Good cake! Its very moist and soft.I noticed that its the the exact same recipe as the Hershey's chocolate cake, which I've used a lot."
"0","5","this is one of the best recipes i tried. I made 5 recipes of this last Christmas, everybody loved it including our parish priest. A friend of my friend asked for it. I hope there is an italian version of it."
"0","5","I made this cake for my daughter's 1st birthday party and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe, there were 2 things that I changed I added 1 cup of cocoa and i used a 1/4 oil & 1/4 cup applesause.  I will be keeping this cake recipe for the future."
"0","5","Some family members were coming over for supper and I did not have a dessert made. I googled Chocolate cakes and whipped this one up in less then 15 min and it was SO good! Definitely one I will be making again!!"
"0","5","Very yummy. I added some espresso powder to the batter and used coconut oil in place of vegetable."
"0","5","I made this for my son's BDay party and everyone LOVED it. I even had one person say that they had not had cake that good since they were a kid. I made the recipe as is, no adjustments. I made it twice, the first with a store brand cocoa and the second with a higher quality brand. Both were good but the the second was definitively better. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe, no more box cakes for sure!"
"0","4","Made this for the first time and everyone loved it."
"0","3","Tasted like an average chocolate cake; nothing special."
"0","5","This cake is amazing! Its definitely a family favourite! My sister doesn't like cake, and she likes this one. Probably because it's not super sweet. But it's sweet enough for the rest of us!   -We follow the recipe exactly (except changing the boiling water with juice, coffee, etc. sometimes), except we use two round pans with at least two cupcakes, so it doesn't overflow, which it does easily.  -If you make cupcakes out of these, don't expect a big round dome top.  -Be careful when stirring after adding the boiling water, stir s l o w l y !  -This cake is very yummy and moist, and is even better the second or third day, so don't be afraid to make it ahead of time!  -Although I agree with other reviewers, not the easiest to get out of the pan, even when you spray a lot.  -I really like that it's in one bowl, and a lot of the same measuring cup, less clean up!"
"0","3","When I make this cake, the middle seems to fall in. When it is in the oven it rises nicely, as soon as I get it out, it falls. What am I doing wrong? However it is very tasty!"
"0","5","LOVE this recipe! Use boiling coffee instead of boiling water for extra chocolate flavor. If making cupcakes, bake 15 min at 350 F for regular cupcakes and 11 minutes at 325 F for mini cupcakes. I've also used for a layer cake and it works well. Just cut off the top so it is flat."
"0","5","I made this batter into cupcakes instead of cake and it turned out AWESOME! My family loved them! And as for myself, let just say I had more than one. ;)"
"0","5","Quick, easy, delicious! Happy Valentine's Day!"
"0","5","AMAZING! All comments below are 100% accurate. I added 1 cup of cocoa powder as some people recommended, and it was perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better chocolate cake."
"0","5","i loved the cake. i made it into a peanut butter chocolate caramel cake. it was amazing and everyone at work wanted the recipe. it came out great and isnt too rich. it is a great basic chocolate cake."
"0","5","This cake turned out so delicious. Just the right moisture and density. It was easy to follow. I used the icing recipe from 'Extreme Chocolate Cake', by Rach56. And after making this I will never return to frosting out of a can. Yum!!!"
"0","4","Good, but needs some extra oopmh. A little plain on its own. Had to bake for 40 mins, not sure why."
"0","5","It was perfect! Easy to make, very basic cake! Don't worry about the consistency after you add the water, it comes out just fine."
"0","5","Ran out of chocolate but it was fantastic anyway. Moist, Chocolaty and would be perfect with Chocolate whipped cream topping.. Will make again."
"0","5","This cake is SO moist and delicious. This is what REAL chocolate cake should taste like. You just can't go back to using boxed cake mix after making it. It's also really nice to only have to use one bowl. Everytime I make it, people always rave about how yummy it is. I usually frost it with a cream cheese icing."
"0","5","I made this recipe for my family and they loved it! The same thing with some friends I made it for soon after. The only thing I did differently is I used a cream cheese frosting on top of the cake. It was a huge success."
"0","5","By the way, yes you can make a 2-layer cake. I made 2 circular cakes, layered chocolate icing on the bottom one, and plopped the 2nd cake on top of it, and then coated the chocolate icing on the top one. Stuck it in the fridge... So delicious. You'll love it. Don't forget to put a nice coating of crisco while baking, it'll come out just fine."
"0","4","hmm not the BEST chocolate cake ive had. but the easiest!  all the ingredients are kitchen staples & its very minimal cleanup. i cut back to 1.5 cups sugar (just to be healthy) but alas, this was a BAD idea.... (my hubby's comment: 'hmmm..sugarless cake?' i also used non-fancy nestle cocoa powder & i brewed a tiny amount of kona coffee for my boiling water. the batter before adding the water was really clumpy & after i added the water, it was not super runny. not dry, not sticky sweet, but if youre craving chocolate & you want it fresh,here ya go! i'll make this again (w/ the 2 cups sugar..screw my health)"
"0","5","favorite chocolate cake recipe"
"0","5","Best chocolate cake recipe out there, period! I make mine in a 9x13 and bake for about 60 minutes. You will never buy another box cake mix again!! Thanks so much for sharing?"
"0","5","Amazing! :D"
"0","5","Outstanding! I used this recipe as a base for a German Chocolate Cake and it was a big hit! I'll be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I just made this recipe for my dad's birthday - he turned 58 and chocolate cake is his favorite! It turned out GREAT! I used two 8' pans instead of 9' because that's all I had. They worked perfectly, didn't even have to cook it very much longer. I stuck to the recipe as listed and I couldn't have been happier!"
"0","5","Just made this. It's perfect. I replaced 1/2 of the flour with barley flour and did 1.5 c sugar and it was perfect. I could take the sugar down to 1 cup or even 3/4 cup and it would be plenty sweet for us."
"0","5","This is really moist cake I have for kids and it is now their favorite cake!! We also use the creamy chocolate frosting with it. It all melts in your mouth!! Highly recommend these. I made it as a layer cake and as cupcakes works great both ways!!"
"0","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE!! My husband says this is a keeper.. Did use a whole cup of cocoa"
"0","5","I agree with the reviewers that raved about this cake. It is easy, moist, has great texture, all that good stuff."
"0","5","so so so so so very easy to put together. A relative newbie to cakes like me could put it together in a jiffy. The cake turned out moist and fluffy like other reviewers pointed out. I made absolutely no changes to the recipe except for using canola oil instead of vegetable oil as I did not have the same. I used a spring foam cake pan and it was very easy to pull out the cake. No trouble at all! I made is as a Christmas treat to my staff and it was gone in a flash! I personally felt it could be a bit sweeter but hey, lesser calories is good right? Thank you Shirleyo, I loved this recipe and its a keeper! Planning to try it with chocolate sauce and ice-cream. yum! :)"
"0","5","This cake is amazing ! It's now my go to recipe for chocolate cake. I did use it as a layer cake and it turned out perfect."
"0","5","Super moist cake, and really easy to make! I had to cook it a little longer than it called for."
"0","3","I used evaporated milk, a little bit less sugar, a little bit more cocoa powder, and I didn't have vanilla extract so I didn't use it. I made cupcakes out of it, and it was okay."
"0","5","awesome!!...just need to be careful of overflow when its baking....other that that perfect and impressed everyone... :)"
"0","5","VERY easy to make. Turned out wonderful and very moist! Could eat it with just powdered sugar for frosting!"
"0","5","I took the suggestion of a few others and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup. I followed everything else exactly as the recipe states. I don't own any round pans, so I did a 9x13 for 40 minutes and it turned out great! Very moist and super chocolatey! One thing to note though, is that it makes a much thicker cake than boxed cake mix does. I was able to get half of mine out of the pan in one piece and froze it to have another time!"
"0","5","This cake was really simple to make and tasted delicious! Good chocolate taste and really moist. I followed the recipe exactly. I read other reviews that said the cake stuck to the pan and fell out in chunks, but I had no issue with this. I greased the pans well and let cool for about 15 minutes before removing them. Definitely will make again!"
"0","5","I made this in to cupcakes, and they were very good. Moist, yet not wet. The one change I made that I highly recommend is adding chocolate chips. I poured the batter (very thin, I know, but it cooks up!) into the cups, and then I sprinkled chocolate chips on top so they didn't sink too deep. It was perfect! Super easy, and also dairy-free (since I used soy milk and no one noticed!)."
"0","5","This was AMAZING.   I'll never make a boxed cake again. I should add that I used 1/2 cup of melted butter rather than the oil as well as 1 cup heavy cream rather than the milk. It's so moist and fabulous!!!"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","This is great! I made it dairy free for my boyfriends birthday and used rice milk instead of regular milk. Wonderful!"
"0","5","Super easy and tasty! I've had many folks asking me for the recipe! Definitely a go-to chocolate cake recipe!"
"0","4","Making it now....switched the boiling water for strong coffee for an extra kick....batter was really thin but I have faith...lol the recipe made 2 8inch cakes and 6 small cupcakes....batter tasted amazing...can't wait to try the cake..."
"0","5","Perfect! Very easy to make, and I was able to cut the recipe in half very easily. Moist and just dense enough."
"0","5","This is the same recipe as 'Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate' Cake. The one you find on the back of the unsweetened cocoa powder. Which I love!"
"0","5","I am actually not sure if I have reviewed this before, but even if I did it is worth doing again :] This is absolutely the BEST cake I have ever had. I have read some reviews that state husbands who don't like cake but love this, and my husband is no different-not a cake fan, but loves this one. I am not sure what some reviewers mean by too moist, this cake is so moist I had a hard time getting it out of the pans sometimes, even buttered and floured first, but that is what makes it good, we hate dry cakes!! I will never buy another ready made or box mix ever again, this is my only cake!!!"
"0","5","Moist and delicious every time."
"0","5","Incredible cake. I will never go back to box mix! My boss LOVED it. Used Chocolate frosting I and it was just perfect."
"0","5","So good!! My parents loved this and asked me to make it again. The only thing that went wrong is I think I took it out of the pan to soon cause it broke in half. Next time i'll wait longer and hopefully it won't happen again. Other wise it tasted like real chocolate cake and was so moist! Thanks!"
"0","5","I have made this several times. Great and quick as is. I have tweaked it a bit and added 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/4 cup. also make sure you DO NOT overbake ..25 minutes is perfect as it still cooks in the pan!!"
"0","5","This recipe was easy to follow. I substituted the all-purpose flour with cake flour (simply because I had 3 boxes of it in my pantry). This was the first time I've ever made a cake from scratch. The cake came out moist & was DELICIOUS!"
"0","5","I just baked this cake for my step - daughter's birthday. She, like the rest of the family, is a chocolate lover and I know she will love it because I scraped the cake from the bottom & sides of tube pan & it's moist, chocolatey & delicious.I followed another reviewer's advice and used a full cup of cocoa powder. I used the tube pan and it was a challenge getting it out of the pan because it is so moist. Out of sheer desperation, I folded parchment paper, four pieces thick, cut a hole in the middle, put it over tube ( had manged to get the rim part off without too much damage)said a prayer and gently flipped it over. It worked. I set it on cake saver plate and frosted with chocolate ganache, then trimmed off the messy paper around the edges. Had already thrown out the leftover coffee from breakfast & didn't want to make a pot so I made a cup of 'International Delight' vanilla latte instant. I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Voila! Will definitely make this one again."
"0","5","Amazingly good and amazingly easy!!! I throw in some chocolate chips a few minutes into cooking time."
"0","5","I needed a last minute cake to make for a friend who LOVES chocolate... made it in not time at all and added bournville coco powder really chocolatiy flavour. Tried a bit of the side and tasted so moist. Added a dark ganache and had to like the spoon, yum yum, shame to waste it. Hopefully my friend will love this all to himself as his wife does not like chocolate cake. How could anyone NOT like chocolate cake ? Thankyou to whoever put this fabulouse receipe will never make another type of chocolate cake again, so easy"
"0","5","The perfect chocolate cake."
"0","5","This was delicious!!! I made the recipe as stated (24 serves) in one huge tray and it was great. I think for the family I will halve the quantity (possibly increase cocoa and cut sugar back a bit - 55g and 175 g respectively), but make it otherwise as stated"
"0","5","Absolutely love this recipe! I will never make a boxed chocolate cake ever again! It was so moist and delicious. Received many compliments and requests for the recipe!"
"0","5","I absolutely love this cake! The easiest and most wonderful chocolate cake recipe!"
"0","5","This cake is a nice cake for someone not wanting anything too rich. The only thing I did different to this recipe was that instead of mixing the dry ingredients and wet ingredients seperate then adding them together, I just put it all in and mixed it at once because it makes for a moister cake. Just make sure to add the boiling water last no matter how you mix the rest of the ingredients. The cake sticks to the pans pretty good even with shortening and flour so I'll use wax paper to line my pans next time. Darn good cake!"
"0","5","Love this cake I made it 2times this week everybody loves it"
"0","5","I was a bit skeptical, but needed to whip up a birthday cake FAST. This recipe is outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly and got a lovely moist chocolate cake."
"0","5","This chocolate cake is divine. It was a big hit & even the not so crazy about chocolate cake people enjoyed it. It's super most & pairs well with Rich Chocolate Frosting."
"0","5","I made this for my wife for her birthday. I doubled the recipe, and also made cupcakes for our girls to eat. Let me say.. this is THE moistest cake I have EVER eaten. It stayed moist for a few days just sitting on the counter, and was super rich and chocolatey! LOVE IT!"
"0","5","I make this all the time for every occasion and EVERYONE says how moist and delicious it is! I just use traditional butter icing with it!"
"0","5","I made this chocolate cake for my boyfriend for his birthday. It even impressed his mom! She asked where I bought it! It was so moist and tasty!"
"0","5","Made this one day on a whim, and it turned out so amazing. All of my roommates were shocked it was from scratch. Note that it will be extremely watery when it goes into the oven (I really thought I had messed up somehow), and that the tip to butter and flour the pans works really well- This cake is super moist, so it's much easier to get out of the pan that way."
"0","2","I was very optimistic about this recipe as it has a good rating by a large number of people. The cake did not turn out well. It sunk in the middle and did not taste very good. It must be me since everyone else loves it....."
"0","5","This is my go-to recipe for birthdays and special occasions. I love this recipe! The cake is so moist and rich. I usually end up baking cupcakes with it instead of actually baking a cake, and it is super easy to convert! My friends and family beg me for this recipe!"
"0","5","I tried this one today,it comes very prefect...thanks for adding this. Excellent chocolate cake !!!"
"0","2","I made cupcakes and this recipe is TOO moist. The cupcakes really tasted underbaked, and I made a point to overbake them. Maybe as a cake it works better."
"0","5","YES!! This cake recipe is fantastic: perfect flavor, perfect moisture and so, so easy! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I mixed it manually as I don't have a mixer. I made it one day in advance, as I read a review that advised so for the best flavor, and I used Ghirardelly unsweetened cocoa. This cake was so good that my quest for the perfect chocolate cake is officially over!!!!"
"0","5","yummy and easy. One change: i used half of cup of boiling water just to make sure it wasnt flat."
"0","5","Wow, delicious!! Made cupcakes instead of the cake, baked 18 mins, made 24 regular size and 10 mini's. Tried lots of chocolate recipes and this is by far the best. Batter is quite thin when pouring, but this is normal. Have to fill cupcakes about 2/3 to 3/4 full as they do not rise a lot. Paired with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site as well, what a treat!!!!"
"0","5","Love this simple recipe! So easy and tasty I never buy the boxed mix anymore. I started making this recipe about 2 years ago and everyone loves it (even people that say they are NOT cake fans)."
"0","1","I picked this recipe because it had such great reviews. I used this recipe for cupcakes and they turned out awful. First they didn't rise, the middle of each cupcake was caved in, the ousides ran onto my cupcake pan and were crispy. The cupcakes stuck to the liner and the cupcake fell apart. I am so glad I tested one before taking these cupcakes to my sons school. What a disaster that would be for kindergarteners. I am on my way to buy a box cake to bake. Next time I will make a practice run when trying a new recipe. I will NOT be trying this one again."
"0","5","Delicious! I made this cake with peanut butter frosting and it was a big hit!"
"0","5","I didn't bother sifting anything and it still turned out great. The batter was enough for 2 9-inch round cakes abot 1.5-2 inches each in height. This cake is super moist and it tastes even better when it's cold fom the fridge."
"0","5","Very easy to make and better than any box mix. When I need to make something quickly but want to make it from scratch (which is 99% of the time), this is my fall-back recipe. Just make sure you grease the pan well because the cake can sometimes stick."
"0","5","***** I use a cup of cocoa in the cake and bake in 9 x 13 pan for 35 min on 325. I add more milk to the frosting."
"0","5","This is such an easy and yummy recipe. The cake was realyl soft. I did not bother to use a handmixer Ijust whisked everything by hand."
"0","5","First off...make it the day before...it is sooo good after its sat...second...I doubled the recipe because I made a 13x3' cake round...I used double the eggs and half in half instead of the milk...and just a little less water, and I used a whole cup of cocoa...It was amazing! I was able to remove it from the pan and position it on my cake decorating plate without any problems...it was sturdy, gooey, chocolatey, Amazing goodness!!! I have been searching for an amazing chocolate cake recipe...This is it!!! It rocks the socks off my grandma's recipe for sure!!!"
"0","5","I loved this cake!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so did everybodu else, an absolute winner!!!!"
"0","4","Very moist! Loved it. Used a cocoa glaze on it too."
"0","5","i absolutely love this recipe, i just made it for a coworker and i made it for my own birthday. i love it. sooo good. moist, and very chocolaty it is a great cake."
"0","4","This is very easy to make and taste delicious! I like how moist this cake is. And like said in the recipe, the final mix is in fact very liquid, but turns into something great!"
"0","5","this is the best cake ive made it was a hit for my son birthday"
"0","5","Best chocolate cake EVER!"
"0","5","Great basic chocolate cake! We made it a bit healthier by substituting the oil and vanilla for vanilla Greek yogurt Anne took another reviewer's advice to use coffee instead of water. In this case we used hazelnut decaf...all in all, it was a fabulous basic cake that allowed us to carve it into different shapes, layer it and decorate it, and have a grater family dessert night!"
"0","5","This is the same as Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Cake Recipe"
"0","5","Absolutely superb, just as the recipe said. Be careful about thoroughly greasing and flouring the pans, though; this is so moist it's very sticky! But scrumptious even right away -- can't wait to try it tomorrow."
"0","5","moist and delicious! i use 1 whole cup of cocoa powder."
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely awesome! The cake was moist and very flavorful, my family loved it! I was really surprised by how easy the cake was to prepare. I used cake flour in place of the all purpose flour and made a raspberry sauce to drizzle over the cake once it was complete. I will definitely make this cake again."
"0","5","This was the best chocolate cake ever! I made it for Christmas and everyone raved."
"0","5","Perfect Chocolate cake!! Made this for Thanksgiving. I am now making it for my Office Christmas Bake Off competition. It is definitely delicious and moist. Cake did sag a little in the middle, but once it was iced, it was unnoticeable. Thank you!"
"0","5","This was a huge hit with my bible study group. I did use a full cup of cocoa powder. I will be using this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","4","I agree that it would be better with more cocoa in it (but I ran out of cocoa right before I could test it!). It's really quick -- 15 minutes to put together and it only took 25 minutes to bake in my admittedly weird oven. You really need to make sure you grease the pans well, or it'll come out messily (easily covered with frosting). It took the same amount of time to bake in cupcakes as it took to bake in two 9' pans, which is weird; it's also great with a couple of dashes of cardamom and a bit of cinnamon."
"0","5","Great recipe, turned out great! I recommend to add some icing to flavour it up a bit!"
"0","5","I used 3/4 C whole wheat flour and 1 C white. Also substituted espresso for water, and folded my egg whites into the batter after whipping them till fluffy. Turned out A-mazing! My new standard chocolate cake! Thank you for this perfect recipe!"
"0","5","So Moist And Delicious!! Everyone Loves This Cake!!"
"0","1","Followed it word for word and ended up with a liquid mass inside an inch of crust. Neither tasted particularly appetizing. Disappointed."
"0","5","This cake has to be one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had...it's moist but not overbearing...and it reminded me of brownie but still a cake by far..I will highly recommend it, and its super easy!!"
"0","4","It was a good and simple recipe."
"0","5","AWESOME! Just made it tonight. I DID increase the cocoa to 1 cup as recommended. I didn't have milk, so I used buttermilk instead. This was so easy and everyone loves it! We used the buttercream iscing that is with the Cherry Amish Friendship Bread recipe. Left it vanilla, but you could add cocoa and make it chocolate. You will NOT be disappointed!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! Just rich enough without being too rich. Will definitely be making many times over."
"0","5","Ahhmazing !"
"0","4","Extremely easy to make, delicious and not too sweet. I had to bake mine for longer than the suggested time, about 7 minutes more. Very moist cake, I frosted with chocolate cream cheese icing from this website. Will make again!"
"0","5","Phenomenal. Nothing like it!"
"0","4","Make exactly 93 mini cupcakes cooked at 10 minutes. They really didn't rise that much so I had to fill them just about to the top."
"0","3","Do not attempt cupcakes with this recipe! It was an utter failure! I filled each cup about half way and they still exploded out the top. They also stuck to the cupcake liners pretty bad. I can't say anything about making a cake with this recipe, but bakers beware...don't make cupcakes!"
"0","4","Me and my daughter made this last night and it was super moist and very good!! Will be making it again"
"0","5","Just made it - I don't do from scratch very often, because I don't have the knack - but this was amazingly easy! I love it and my family loves it! Thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious and moist chocolate cake. The only thing I changed was reducing the amount of water to 1/2 cup... I like a slightly denser cake. Anyway, it came out really yummy with a great texture!"
"0","4","I used this recipe to make an ice cream cake for my husband's birthday. He doesn't like dark chocolate or anything coffee-flavored, so that eliminated a lot of chocolate cake recipes out there. This one was a perfect basic chocolate cake to showcase my homemade mint ice cream I used as 'frosting'. The cake froze well and tasted great."
"0","5","This was sooooo delicious....I made this last night for my family and they absolutely loved it. it will be my go to cake from now on! the only change i made was to add 1 cup of cocoa and it was delicious. i would give you more stars if i could !"
"0","5","loved this cake. thin batter surprised me,how moist a cake it turned out to be."
"0","5","this cake was absolutely delish and equally important, it was easy! i followed the recipe exactly as stated, baked it for 32 minutes in a 9x13 pan and topped it off with a vanilla glaze (recipe from this site) within 20 minutes the cake disappeared!!"
"0","5","A whole new family of fans! Delicious!"
"0","4","Wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe and made 24 cupcakes. They came out so soft and moist. I would give 5 stars if there's more chocolate taste in it."
"0","5","I LOVED this recipe! I made it into cupcakes, and it made 2 dozen exactly! Then I filled them with a creme I made, and topped them with a chocolate glaze! Sooooo good! I have no complaints!"
"0","5","I joined allrecipes.com JUST to comment on this cake. I made them as cupcakes for my sons birthday and just like Pringles I could not stop at just one! I thought initially there was too much sugar, but OMG, yum! They are just moist enough and not dense. I ate about 4 before the party and had to stop myself before we didn't have enough! Will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","My 12yo son baked this today - it was so easy for him and it was delicious!!"
"0","5","easy and delicious, does taste its best the next day though"
"0","5","loved it! it was so moist, i topped/filled it with chocolate ganache! delicious!"
"0","5","yay."
"0","5","Moist, declious, and easy!!"
"0","5","What a wonderful recipe! This was the first cake I had ever baked and let me tell you it was delicious!!! I made it for my mother's birthday and she couldn't stop complimenting my baking skills! The cake was just so moist and delicious it was absolutely amazing thankyou! I was a little skeptical about the whole 'one cup of boiling water' part but it all worked out. Thanks!!!!!! Will definitely use again!"
"0","4","Little bit messy to work with, but worthed it! I baked it in a 11 inch round pan, for 1 hour! (175C - interesting). And the sugar was observable, little crunchy =)  If you don't want your filling/cream to be soaked in between the layers and on the top of the cake, put some jelly/jam on it first (apricot's a good choice, because it has a soft flavor)"
"0","4","I made this recipe, and I thought it was a bit bland and dry, but then again I made it in a giant cupcake pan, so that might be why it was dry, since I cooked it a bit longer thinking the middle wouldn't be done. However, I am not a chocolate cake fan, so I decided to spruce it up a bit on my next try. I added two of the approximately 4 ounce butterscotch pudding snack containers into the batter, and oh my!!! It transformed it into the most moist, soft, wonderful chocolate cake ever, and I don't even like chocolate cake. I reduced the water by 1/3 cup when I added the pudding. I don't know how much time to add to baking, since I made it in a giant cupcake pan again, so just start checking it around the time it says and take it out when the toothpick comes out clean."
"0","5","An absolutely wonderful cake that I adjusted by toppin with a chocolate Glaze instead of a frosting and I used my own chocolate custard recipe instead of a fudge middle. It turned out to be an enjoyably delicious, light, and fluffy cake."
"0","4","I used this recipe in little bunny shaped muffin tins, and they worked perfectly. They were nice and moist, but I had a little trouble getting them out of the pan. I covered them with a chocolate ganache and some chopped almonds to finish them off. Super yummy. =^.^="
"0","4","It is moist and rich, but has a bit of baking soda after taste. I think I will try another recipe which does not require as much baking soda."
"0","5","So good! Super chocolatey and moist. Best chocolate cake I've ever had :)"
"0","4","This was EASY and great tasting recipe! I am glad I found this.....this is a keeper! Now to find the perfect frosting for something so soft, moist and delicious! THANKS!"
"0","5","I would give this cake (taste wise) a five star. I have one problem with the baking of it. I baked it in a 9 by 13' pan and it cooked all the way through, but sinks down in the middle. It's cooked all the way through, but the presentation without frosting is not appealing to the eye. Any suggestions as to why this is happening?? Some of the other reviews I have read indicated that they also used a 9 by 13' pan instead of two 9' round pans. Would love to hear from anyone else that has encountered this problem."
"0","5","Made this recipe twice now in a 9Ã13 pan & it is a moist, delicious cake! Recommend it as its very simple tomake & moist everytime! Thank you."
"0","5","Easiest and best chocolate cake I have ever made. I keep the ingredients on hand and have not purchased a box mix since I began using this recipe!"
"0","5","Wow! This cake is easy, delicious, moist, and...DELICIOUS (yes, it's that good--I had to say it twice)!!! I baked two 'First & Ten' football cakes to make rocket ship cakes for my boys' birthday party. That made it take longer than 35 minutes because it was one recipe per cake, so it was pretty deep. I am really glad my 2-year-old said he wanted chocolate cake and that I found this recipe! Amazing! I saw one review that said they would never buy a boxed mix again and I have to agree! It really is too easy and scrumptious to not make every time you need a chocolate cake!"
"0","5","Excellent and easy! Just made this for my son's birthday--it made a moist, dense, and chocolaty two layer cake....I'll be making it for a friend's birthday tomorrow and will try the 9 x 13 pan as one of the reviewers did."
"0","5","This cake was excellent - made it for my husband's birthday. I used a little more cocoa as recommended by other cooks & it cooked for 20 minutes longer than the instructions say. It sat covered overnight then I iced it the next day with basic chocolate buttercream. It was perfect. I won't use a mix for chocolate cake ever again. Another bonus is that you can prep & mix all the dry ingreds together then put it away till you have time to mix in the wet ingreds & bake it. DO use parchment in your pan & DO use the very best cocoa you can find."
"0","5","that's by far the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten!"
"0","3","i will say, i messsed up a lot! but, i dont think thats the reason why i didnt rate this cake 4 stars. i tought it tasted kinda bland, like it was missing something. but maybe itwas because i used a 8x1 round pan, and it over flowed, causing a smoky kitchen and i had to open a door but left it open till about 9:25 pm and my dog started barking at something out side! (cyotees live in my area, a lot of them) but maybe it was the frosting i used, i used that nasty pilsberry vannila frosting with green food coloring and added a veriaty of choco. sprikles. when it finished cooling thhough, the bottem was very moist and it stuck to the bottem of the pan, i did greese it! it was kinda crumby and to put on the iceing was really hard without messing up the cake. i dont know what i did wrong, but i dont think i will make this again."
"0","5","This cake was incredible! We used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe, also from this website. It was sooooo chocolately and easy to make! The strawberries were a perfect touch to compliment the all the chocolate!"
"0","4","Good chocolate flavor i used hershey dark chocolate cocoa. Turned out moist, very good."
"0","5","this is the best chocolate cake ever!!! i used 3/4 cup cocoa powder and 1/4 cup chocolate... it was really black and soo soft and delicious.. prepared it for my little cousin's birthday and every one loved it and asked about the recipe!!! and it take so little time to prepare the batter.. thank you very much!!!"
"0","1","Just baked this cake and it cracked at the centre. And also the centre wasnt cooked! Very disappointed though."
"0","5","This cake was great! simple and way more rich than I expected."
"0","5","I just made this cake and it is SO GOOD! I used 3/4 cup of cocoa, but do think I will use a full cup next time!! It was a very easy cake to make and defiantly will be a go to cake recipe! I also had that baking soady taste, but am hoping it will fade as another member said. Question, when I up the cocoa to 1 cup do I change the amount of sugar also??"
"0","5","This is the best from scratch chocolate cake recipe I've ever tasted. So much better than boxed cakes. I make decorative cakes as a hobby/side job and this is perfect. It is moist and easy to stack and shape. I also increased the cocoa to 1 full cup and used the best quality cocoa I found at the store. Everyone begs for my recipe. This is a rich, moist, delicious cake!"
"0","5","I have made this cake twice. I used 1 cup cocoa the second time and WOW (from now on I will be using 1 cup cocoa)! This cake is amazing, moist, and tastes great even after it's been sitting in the fridge a few days. I frosted the whole thing with the Brownie Frosting from this site, then topped with Chocolate Ganache (hence why I was keeping the cake in the refrigerator)! My mom is always requesting me to make this cake for get togethers, it's a real favorite!"
"0","5","This cake is always a hit!"
"0","5","My boyfriend literally could not stop raving about this cake! I made it with the Heavenly Chocolate Mousse recipe on this website for a perfect birthday cake!"
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic. The only chocolate cake recipe i will ever use again! The only change i made was to use 1 cup cocoa powder. Per other reviews. I also used Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting on the site. I just used 4x the amount of frosting for a 2 layer cake. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"0","5","I wanted to make a chocolate cake so I just made this chocolate cake and wow! It taste great and very moist! I'm so going to keep this in my recipe book."
"0","5","Great recipe and the best part is it's butter free! An overall pretty healthy and amazing cake. I baked mine using Godiva chocolate and i baked in a 10 x 2 pan. It took a bit longer, about 45 minutes but ti came out perfect. I put semi sweet chips in the mix too which added some surprise to the cake. Once it cooled I covered it with the Chocolate Ganache recipe (heavy cream, bittersweet choc). It was perfect! very rich but great with vanilla ice cream and coffee! Will make this again I am sure! plus its super easy!"
"0","5","I made this as written. It was yummy and everyone really enjoyed it. I have never had much luck with layering cake so I made it as a standard sheet cake and it worked out great."
"0","5","My favorite Chocolate Cake recipe. If you are looking for a dark, moist, fudge-y like cake, this is it! Simple and beats any box mix cake."
"0","5","Loved this cake and I'm not a big fan of chocolate. :) I followed the directions exactly and after cooling, I frosted with chocolate frosting on top and in the center. I also filled the center with a homemade plum jam. Delicious! I have to agree with others though, it is much better when it sits in the fridge overnight. Very moist and not overly sweet like some cakes tend to be. This one stays in the recipe book!"
"0","5","This is an easy cake to make, makes good cupcakes, and the kids love to help make it."
"0","5","This is our new cake that we make for all birthdays and special occasions. It's fabulous!! Easy, quick and really easy to frost. I use a frosting from allrecipes.com called 'Rich chocolate frosting'. It's perfect everytime. My family of seven will eat the entire cake in one setting because they can't stop themselves, it's that good!"
"0","5","This turned out great.I used the Chocolate Cream Cheese Icing from this site,but the cake was so moist I had to add a 5th Tbsp.of milk to the icing so I could spread it without tearing the cake."
"0","4","Needs more cocoa powder."
"0","5","this is the new best chocolate cake recipe! moist and delicious...reallly easy to make. The only scary part of the process was adding the boiling water to the end...the mixture was strangly liquid but...in the end i understood why. the moisture was just where it needs to be....******heavenly****** gonna make another cake today :P"
"0","5","Simple-check Delicious-check Looks great-check Easy clean up after-check AMAZING!!!"

"0","5","We all loved this cake and it is so EASY!"
"0","5","this batter really is THIN but it works. i was a bit skeptical at first but this is the most delicious chocolate cake i've ever made/tasted. it taste almost like cocoa puffs. lol"
"0","5","Just tried this recipe after reading the good reviews on it and it turned out great! The recipe was very easy to mix. I used the recipe to make cupcakes and they were so good! This recipe tastes a lot like devils food cake - so moist and chocolate. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!"
"0","5","Very easy - very good. A real keeper"
"0","4","First try was amazing right from the starting gate. Easy to make, easy to follow, took so little effort and the cake came out amazing! The kids loved it. Moist, chocolaty and delicious. Also, I looked up a home made frosting in ALLRECIPES, it turned out great. THANK YOU!"
"0","5","Yummy! I love this cake... May I make a suggestion for frosting :) Kathleen's Peanut Butter Icing: 1 cup confectioners' sugar 1 cup creamy peanut butter 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup heavy cream Also I love chocolate and I would also suggest upping it to one cup cocoa powder and adding 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips to the mix once it has been poured into the pan. Its sooo good especially if your a fan of reese's peanut butter cups"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! Made for grandsons birthday party! Lots of adults at party loved this recipe. I did add about 2/3 cup applesauce. Alsolutely a keeper!"
"0","2","Stuck to the pan (I did the pan prep as instructed and as I do for other cakes that do not stick). Taste was good though."
"0","5","I make cakes for a living and I can tell you this is the perfect chocolate cake!! It comes out moist and chocolatey every time! It is always my go to recipe!"
"0","3","The cake was not rich what i expected.It was ok.Followed the recipe exactly.Wont be making it again."
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous! I followed a recommendation and upped the cocoa to 1 cup. I also baked it in a bundt pan for 40 min and it turned out moist and delicious. I made a ganache and poured it on top of the cake which complemented superbly! I will be using this as a my go to chocolate cake!"
"0","5","Followed this recipe to a T, and it was awesome. But to me, it was more of a two bowl cake, but the one with the dry ingredients is technically clean (heh)"
"0","4","good recipe, if you are a fan of fugde like chocolate cake, but I am not. i like those fluffy, moist chocolate cake but not dense ones. anyways but this recipe is good, very easy to make easier than any cake i have made. But the only problem, it stucks to the pan often, so use wax paper or parchement to line the bottom of the pan."
"0","5","Just finished making a 'test batch' before having to make a birthday cake this weekend and cant believe how good this came out. I'm not a fan of chocolate cake but this one will be the exception. Super moist and fudgy, and it almost seems to taste better after being in the fridge. I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of melted butter for the veg oil. I also used ruddy red cocoa which I've never seen before and I was a little worried that the cake would turn out red LOL (it didnt)...I also omitted the salt since I'm not a fan. I think for the next batch I'll follow the other reviews and up the cocoa to 1 cup other than that I wont change a thing!"
"0","5","This cake was incredible! It was moist and dense and tasted perfectly chocolatly. I did add 1 full cup of cocoa powder instead of 3/4 cup."
"0","5","My go to chocolate cake! Never ever fails and makes good cupcakes as well (use a bit less liquids when making cupcakes). I make this as written and it comes out perfect every singe time :)"
"0","5","Love this recipe, perfect for birthday cake! I substitute the water for coffee and only add 1/2 teaspoon of salt."
"0","5","This cake is to die for! I've been looking for an easy chocolate cake recipe that's moist and doesn't dry up when you refrigerate it. This cake is exactly that, and more! I followed the advice of some reviewers and upped the cocoa to 1 cup. Also, I substituted buttermilk instead of regular milk, hoping to get a better rise. But I think I overdid it and my cake fell as it was cooling. My bad! Even with my mess up, this cake turned out delicious! It's the kind of recipe where you can't go wrong. In fact, after leaving overnight in the fridge, the cake actually got even more moist, and the taste incredible! The only thing I'd do differently next time is line the baking pan with parchment paper instead of just greasing and flouring. I can't stop raving about this cake. This is going to be my standard chocolate cake recipe from now on. I can't wait to bake it again!"
"0","4","Really good, easy to make but totally stuck to my bunt pan even after I sprayed and floured."
"0","5","This has become my standard chocolate cake recipe. It is easy to make, always bakes up perfectly, and has a nice texture and wonderful taste! We love it with peanut butter frosting."
"0","5","Very good and moist cake."
"0","5","This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made or eaten. It is great even without frosting. This will be my new staple chocolate cake recipe. THANK YOU SHIRLEYO!"
"0","5","A word to the high altitude cooks, this cake will only fall if you don't make adjustments. I live in Colorado Springs, CO so I am at about 5500 ft. I used 1 3/4 c sugar instead of two, 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda instead of 1 1/2 tsp each, and increased the water to 1 1/4 c water. I used a 9x13 cake pan and baked it at 325 for 50 minutes and it turned out just perfect. I also used the buttercream frosting by Sharon and they are amazing together. I think it tastes much better than boxed cake mixes."
"0","5","this recipe is so easy! i made them into cupcakes."
"0","4","Very decadent and moist. I substituted 1 1/2 cups honey for the sugar and omitted the boiling water. Turned out very nice."
"0","5","Perfect combination of moist cake and chocolate. Have made this countless times and have received wonderful reviews. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!"
"0","5","Increased the cocoa to 1 cup. Added 1/4 cup applesauce. Batter was very thin, but I went ahead! I made 2 x 8 inch rounds and 10 cupcakes with 1/4 cup batter each. It was perfect - this does rise up a lot, so leave space in your pans. I baked for 20 minutes until a toothpick came out clean. PERFECT! It has a soft light very moist texture and I needed a change from my usual dense chocolate cake. I added Kahlua Ganache for the fill, covered it in Chocolate buttercream, piped on some pink buttercream roses and it looked amazing - and tasted just as good! It did seem 'sticky' when I took it out, so do make sure you wait a little to take out of the pan and make sure you grease and flour your pans well."
"0","5","Rave reviews. Very easy, rich dark chocolate flavor. Moist! The only thing I changed was to add hot coffee instead of boiling water at the end. I frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting (recipe on this site)."
"0","5","The best dark chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch. Absolutely delicious! I divided the layers and poured the Texas Sheet Cake icing in between the layers to make an old fashioned Fudge Cake. Oh my goodness! It was so good!"
"0","4","Great, easy recipe. I made this for a two year old's birthday party so admittedly I did not use the most quality chocolate money can buy. I used Trader Joe's cocoa and it still turned out great. I did increase the cocoa to one cup like a lot of other reviews suggested and I am glad I did."
"0","5","Soooo good! I made a half recipe in an 8x8, cut in half and frosted with a whipped ganache. This will definitely cure a chocolate craving. Very rich and delicious!"
"0","5","I absolutely loved this cake, my husband did too! Hint though, don't use two 8in pans and guess how full they should be! My pans overflowed and my oven caught on fire... the cake still turned out amazing! Maybe if I get bigger pans, I will make it for my husband's birthday next year! I did add a full cup of chocolate, and I am glad I did"
"0","5","My daughter loved the cupcakes this recipe made! I increase the chocolate to one cup of cocoa, because I know how much she loves chocolate. I'm actually making this cake again right now!"
"0","5","What a wonderful recipe. The cake was beautiful to look at and glorious to eat. It was so moist and flavorful. I increased the cocoa to 1 cup as suggested by others and used applesauce in replace of the oil for personal preference. This is going to be a permanent go to recipe for me from now on."
"0","5","Delicious! Very moist and chocolatey. I topped mine with a French Buttercream frosting."
"0","5","Delicious and very easy"
"0","5","Easy to make even if you are having an off day. Yesterday I burned everything I touched, but this cake still turned out good. I was worried it was going to be bad because it was so runny at first but it baked up nicely."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious. I served it at a party and it was gone in about 15 min. As per some of the other reviews, I upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup."
"0","5","Great cake, and SO FAST AND EASY to make! Modified a bit by adding extra cocoa, cinnamon, coffee, nutmeg and cloves. I could hardly believe I made it, it tasted so good. Never using a chocolate cake mix ever again :)"
"0","5","Simply amazing. Easy but delicious!"
"0","4","My step-son wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday, so I made this for him. It was absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it and there wasn't even one piece left at the end of the day. Only thing different I did was used unsweetened applesauce in the place of the oil. Now his dad wants me to bake another one to take to his boss who just gave birth to a baby boy this morning."
"0","5","AWESOME recipe. As a lot of other reviewers commented, the cake gets better the longer you let it sit. I substituted a cup of coffee for the water and it was perfect. Used a little more cocoa powder also for rich chocolate taste. No fail recipe, just follow it exactly."
"0","5","I made this recipe. This is my first chocolate cake from scratch. I have made homemade cakes before but not chocolate. This cake turned out wonderful for me and very moist. It is a keeper."
"0","5","i had my sister make me this cake for my birthday and it was AWESOME! Best cake I ever had, and I LOVE cake!!! if you make this cake you will NOT regret it!"
"0","4","was well liked - better then any old box mix but just as easy."
"0","5","Yummy!!! So good, I'm making it again!"
"0","5","My new favorite chocolate cake recipe. It's perfectly moist and not overly chocolately; great with buttercream or ganache."
"0","4","delicious! used metal 9x13 pan and baked for 35 mins. sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top, but they didn't sink this time."
"0","5","This cake is amazing and moist!! I upped the cocoa to 1C. The batter was super thin but it turned out great!! I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40mins. Will be my basic chocolate cake from now on."
"0","5","Darn good cake! Doesn't even really need frosting!"
"0","5","I made this into a birthday cake for my husband and used 'Sturdy whipped cream frosting' on top (it was a ski-slope cake!). It was super easy and tasted fantastic. The frosting also got the thumbs up from young and old alike."
"0","5","rather than decreasing the sugar amount, i followed the recipe as it is; however i was doughtful of how it would come out of the oven as the batter was runny. this cake turned out to be so tasty and moist. i will do it again and again. i love it. thanks"
"0","5","This was not as fluffy as i thought it would be but the taste is just perfect. Definitely the ideal chocolate cake."
"0","5","I just had to add my review to the growing number because this cake really should be tried. TRY this recipe! I'm very glad I did. This cake was super easy, delicious, and moist. I really didn't think cake could be good at all unless it came from a box and had 'pudding in the mix' but this cake is fantastic. I didn't beat the batter for 2 minutes before adding the boiling water, it really isn't nessesary at all and you run the risk of over beating."
"0","4","Absolutely perfect! I used 4 stars because I did agree that 1 full cup of cocoa was the right amount. I also replaced the water with adagio.com Birthday Cake tea. Friends of mine have replaced the water with Dr. Pepper and coffee, so I suppose the possibilities are endless. I frosted it with peanut butter frosting from the Peanut Butter Cake recipe on this website. YUM YUM YUM!"
"0","5","Perfect chocolate cake.....using 2 cups of flour. Have made this recipe (from HersheyÂ´s can label) for years with success. This is my go-to recipe whenever I need chocolate cake to dress up with any topping and/or frosting of choice. The recipe yields two 9' round cakes."
"0","4","The only problem was it was slightly overcooked in our convection oven. Probably 25 - 28 minutes next time. I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour."
"0","5","This is a fantastic recipe! It is basically devil's food cake, made simple! I made some changes because I didn't have unsweetened cocoa in the house... I used 2 cups of chocolate drink mix and 1 cup of brown sugar (instead of 2 cups of sugar and 1 of cocoa), it worked great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I tried this cake the next day after baking it; it wasn't that great....however, after day 2 in the refrigerator, something spectacular happened. The texture of it changed and it was fabulous! So, bake this a couple days in advance and refrigerate it--wonderful!"
"0","5","This is an amazing chocolate cake. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and increased the cocoa powder to 1 cup. And to quote another reviewer, this cake is even more delicious the day after. I didn't even refrigerate it--just covered it. I made it with thick buttercream frosting so that may have retained its moisture. In any case, I don't review recipes often but this was amazing. A definite keeper. Thanks for it!!!"
"0","5","My husband thinks this is the best chocolate cake ever! I think it's pretty good- but a little heavy and moist for my taste. Really, it's all in finding a good icing! One great thing about this recipe is that I almost always have the ingredients on hand!"
"0","4","No need to buy from the box again! Thank you great recipie."
"0","5","This cake is delicious - wonderful chocolate flavor and a nice, moist consistency. It makes a beautiful, heavy, rich cake. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, and they were a great combo. I made it for my niece's birthday since she's a big chocolate lover, and she loved it. I bake a lot, and this will be my go to recipe for chocolate cakes from now on."
"0","4","Nothing fancy, just a good chocolate cake! Following original recipe, I made 6-7 dozen mini cupcakes and finished them with a cream cheese icing. Be sure to bake the batter immediately since the boiling water activates the leavening. Can't go wrong with this one!"
"0","5","Nice taste, easy to make. I made this one to make a train cake, it was a good choice, plus I made 10 cup cakes with cream cheese frosting also from this site."
"0","5","So very good! I read through a lot of the reviews and was a bit skeptical that this cake could taste that delicious without a bunch of ingreadients. But I tried it and followed the directions exactly and it turned out to be one of the best tasting cakes I've ever done. It doesn't require a lot of fancy ingredients, which I am grateful for. The batter was a little thin, which made me a little worried. I baked it for 35 minutes, and when I put a knife in the middle it came out clean and I was so suprised! Definitely a keeper, and I will make it again soon! I made some frosting that I found from the website and they went great together. Very good."
"0","3","I'm really torn on this, because I thought it was REALLY delicious, but it was sort of a disaster to make. In my first attempt, using 9 inch pans as instructed, the pans completely overflowed. There was just a stream of batter running over the sides. What was left in the pan eventually fell into a flat cake. I tried again using half the batter in a 10 inch springform. The cake didn't overflow, but half if it did collapse when I gave it a toothpick test at 30 minutes. I ended up keeping it in the oven for 45 minutes. It was lopsided, but delicious. I will probably make it again, but will bake it in a larger pan for a longer time and will not disturb it at all!"
"0","5","Easy and delicious!! I agree with the poster that said that it's even better the next day after it has had a chance to mellow though. YUM!"
"0","5","Excellent! Made this and filled it with chocolate ganache filling and frosted with caramel icing. Amazing!"
"0","5","This cake was amazing! So easy and quick to make. I baked mine in a 13x9x2 for about 30 minutes, then frosted with 'Cinnamon Coffee Frosting' on this site. To die for! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is, without a doubt, the best chocolate cake I have ever made. The texture was perfect and the taste fabulous. I will never look for another chocolate cake recipe again. This is it."
"0","5","Delicious! It was even better on day 2. I used 3/4 cup almond milk and 1/4 cup water in place of the milk and it baked perfectly."
"0","4","After reading the other reviews, I did add more chocolate to the recipe. I was not really impressed with the taste of the cake but my husband (I was making it for him) really liked it. I just thought that the cake still lacked flavor..missing something. Since it got rave reviews from my husband (and was simple to make)...I will most likely make it again."
"0","5","Easy and great tasting cake :) I was wondering if I could add some rum or another type of alcohol to make it even better 0_-"
"0","5","This cake is moist and delicious. And very easy to make. I didn't change anything about the recipe at all and it came out great. This will now be my go-to chocolate cake recipe."
"0","5","This cake is soft, moist, rich (following the advice of other reviewers and using 1 cup of cocoa) and it rose beautifully! This is my new go to chocolate cake recipe (with a little less cocoa next time). Don't be alarmed by the thin consistency. Yum!"
"0","5","Chocolate perfection!!! Moist, rich, perfectly balanced sweetness...what more could you ask for?"
"0","5","simply wonderful!! i made this cake for a birthday party and it was an absolute hit.. my husband said he'd never tasted anything so good :) THANKS Shirleyo.. i wouldn't change a single thing from this receipe. 3yrs later.... Still the best chocolate cake to whip up super quick and it tastes divine.. Love love love this recipe..makes me look like an expert.. Lol"
"0","5","YUM! At first I thought that there was absolutly no way that a batter this thin could cook. But when it came out, in exactly 34 minutes, it was perfect! I used one 9x12 pan instead and everybody loved it. Very easy too! I'm twelve and not the best cook but made this cake with like, NO effort."
"0","5","This is an absolutely delicious and moist chocolate cake recipe, I've been using this recipe for more than 10 years now."
"0","5","I just found another version of this recipe that uses buttermilk instead of milk and hot brewed coffee in place of the boiling water. It's baking now."
"0","5","YUMMMM....this was very moist and chocolatey. I ran out of white flour and used half whole wheat flour which might have made it richer. I also didn't have milf so I used about 1/4 cup heavy cream with 3/4 cup milk. no vegetable oil but olive oil with an added 1/4 applesauce to keep it moist. My version had some added health and was still realy delicious!"
"0","5","this will be my chocolate cake recipe from now on. Perfection."
"0","4","I gave this 4 stars because this chocolate cake recipe is the same as the Hershey's cocoa powder recipe. I'm just glad I read the reviews that told me it was the Hershey's recipe, because I have already made that one and was looking for something different and unique to try... Since I was looking for something other than the Hershey's recipe, I modified this one a bit. I used a full cup of cocoa powder like other reviewers suggested, I used half and half instead of milk, and I used half butter and half oil instead of all oil. I didn't want to use all butter because the oil does give it the moistness. I will make the recipe again, but I will modify it even more. Next time I plan to add another form of chocolate in addition to the cocoa, maybe bittersweet or dark chocolate. I like the cocoa, but it seems like it is still missing some chocolate flavor that the cocoa cannot give."
"0","5","I reduced the sugar and the oil a little bit, but overal a great and EASY recipe. Kudos!"
"0","5","Super easy & Delicious! Didn't even frost it just dusted with powdered sugar. Loved that it only used 1 bowl. Will make again!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT cake recipe :) Came out perfect- rich and thick and moist!"
"0","5","Very good cake! I had all the ingredients on hand. Will not buy a box cake again!"
"0","5","I have looked high and low for a good chocolate cake recipe and this is it! The cake is so moist and flavorful! The family gave it rave reviews, too!!"
"0","4","This recipe made a great tasting cake but I used it to make cupcakes and it was kinda a mess. I filled the cups up 3/4 of the way and it completely spilled over. They are not pretty looking cupcakes but quiet tasty with cream cheese frosting. Next time, and there will be a next time, I think I will use a 9x13 pan. So it just lost one star for not being a flexible cake batter."
"0","4","As another reviewer pointed out this is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. It is really good and fudgey. Also easy."
"0","5","This is the one and only chocolate cake reciepe I will be using from now on. I've been searching for ages for a chocolate cake reciepe and this one just reminded me of the ones i used to eat as a child. I followed some of the users suggestion of adding 1 cup of cocoa instead of 3/4 and it just tuirned out perfect!"
"0","5","I made this cake as directed, and was very happy with it. I ended up splitting the layers and giving the cut sides a wash with simple syrup, but the cake would have been moist enough without it. I would recommend waiting at least a day to eat the cake after baking. The day after it was baked the cake was good, two days later it was fantastic. I will definitely use this recipe again, thanks!"
"0","5","Moist, chocolaty, very easy. Fabulous with my mom's caramel frosting. Don't be scared off by how thin the batter is after the boiling water. Wouldn't change a thing; will definitely make again."
"0","5","This was a great moist cake, so rich!"
"0","5","I was looking for a quick and easy dessert and this was it! I made the cake in a bundt pan and my family was very pleased with the results. It was moist and delicious. I was almost disappointed that I didn't have company to serve it to! I did use 1c of cocoa as I had read in another review, it was good but I'm not convinced it was necessary."
"0","5","Sooooo Good!!"
"0","4","This is a good basic chocolate cake. Not too sweet, but good chocolate flavor and easy to make!"
"0","5","My kids made this cake yesterday...it turned out awesome! We did substitute coffee for the water. We baked in a bundt pan, and topped with German Chocolate Cake Frosting II (off this site). I'm normally not a chocolate cake person, but this cake is so moist and full of flavor, I'm having a hard time staying away from it :) Thanks for sharing!***Made again, this time I added a cream cheese filling of crm chz, vanilla, powdered sugar & chocolate chips. I also added 1 TBSP instant coffee. I iced the cake with chocolate icing and topped with cherry pie filling...MMM GOOD!"
"0","5","Made them as mini cupcakes and they came out super moist and yummy! Used 1 cup of cocoa as recommended by others."
"0","2","This cake was very easy, very moist and very dense. Unfortunately it was also very bland. I've tried it three times with different icing with no success."
"0","5","This cake is yummy and easy so easy that my husband which is no baker made it the other day and it was still great."
"0","5","So moist, delicious and EASY. I followed the recipe exactly, except baked in a tube cake pan for about 35 minutes. This is a keeper for nights when you need a bit of chocolate in a hurry!"
"0","5","I made this recipe as cupcakes and they turned out great! I used 1 full cup of unsweetened cocoa instead of 3/4 cup to bring out the chocolate flavor. I also added 2 Tablespoons of old coffee (leftover from this morning) to the boiling water to bring out the chocolate flavor even more. I made sure to sift all dry ingredients. I think this is key to making this an extremely light and fluffy cupcake. These are really delicious, even without frosting! I'll be making this recipe again!"
"0","4","Some changes: 1 cup of Dutch cacao instead of 3/4 cup. No water, but instead more milk, in total 1,5 cup. Instead of 1/2 cup of oil, I used a mixture of butter and oil and some more of it too: 1/2 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup of oil. Last but not least: chipped pieces of chocolate mixed in the batter. Cooking time about 1 hour. Delicious!"
"0","5","Okay - best cak I hae made in a while. Follow others and added 1 cup of cocoa powder. Never using cake mix again. used 9 inch cake pans and the buttercream icing. One friend who does not eat cake - ate two pieces. easy to make and wonderful to eat."
"0","5","This cake was a huge hit at work and home! It's a keeper."
"0","5","I used 1/4 c oil and a small plastic container of applesauce. It was so moist, dense and yummy!"
"0","5","It was just as easy as the box stuff and tast a million times better."
"0","4","It was pretty good, but I would take away that teaspoon of salt, I could taste that when I ate it. But my family and boyfriend loved it, so I would do this again!"
"0","5","This recipe puts those boxed mixes to shame! I followed the directions exactly as written & the cake turned out rich & moist & delicious! I think next time i will sub coffee for the boiling water in the last step!"
"0","5","Very easy and very yummy!"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","Taste great! I read the reviews that the cake was too watery so I did not add the water. I had to substitute two of the items. Instead of cocoa powder I used Godiva's hot cocoa mix and instead of Vanilla extract I used Coconut extract. I sprinkled chocolate chips between the layers after the cake came out of the oven. I frosted it with wiped cream and coconut. This came out great and tasted like a german chocolate cake w/o the tooth ache."
"0","4","I am only giving this 4 stars because it is the exact same recipe on the back of the Hershey Cocoa can as someone else said. It has a rich fudge flavor and I agree the day after it was better, a bit too rich for me though. I used the chocolate frosting recipe found on the back of the Hershey can as well and let's just say you will need milk! I noticed the cake was so moist that when I frosted it, it started to fall apart. I'm glad I was making it for my household so I didn't care much about it but would have been embarrassed otherwise."
"0","5","Greatest chocolate cake I've ever made...finally!"
"0","5","So good!"
"0","5","This cake is wonderful. Everytime I make it, I put it in the freezer after it bakes and it turns out super moist."
"0","5","I tweaked this recipe just a bit and thought the result was sensational; probably better than any other cake I've made. I upped the cocoa to 1 cup and the vanilla to 1 Tbs. Made as cupcakes and added a tsp of mini choc chips to each cupcake. The real test of a good cake is if it tastes good without frosting. This one does! To add to the flavor perfection, it's all done in one bowl. What could be better?"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! Love the boiling water effect. I use this recipe to make Cake Balls, also on this website, and I cut the recipe in half and it makes about 30 Cake Balls. I upped the unsweetened cocoa powder to 1 full cup and it came out so great. Really rich and moist! Thanks!"
"0","5","Made this for my son's birthday, frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting, the cake was a big hit. I used 2 tsps baking powder as I had Dutch cocoa, omitted the baking soda and salt, used coffee for hot water. Baked in 9x13 pan for 35 minutes and it was perfect."
"0","5","I made this cake along with the Buttercream Icing recipe on this site. My husband told me it's one of the best cakes he has ever eaten and he LOVES cake! I followed another reviewer's advice and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup. I used a 9X13 pan and baked it for 30 minutes. Thank you for this amazing recipe!"
"0","5","first cake i've made from scratch and it didn't disappoint. only difference i did was add 2t of instant coffee. very moist, not too sweet, and perfect chocolate flavor."
"0","4","I made this for my sisters Birthday and everyone loved it. Its probably the moistest homemade cake i've ever made."
"0","4","This cake was good, but not the best. It was not moist enough for my liking. Next time I think I will take it out of the oven a few minutes sooner and see if that changes anything."
"0","5","I've been using this recipe for years - it's the same as the one in my Hersheys cookbook. However, I add a box of instant chocolate pudding mix (dry) and I use a cup of boiling coffee instead of water. ALWAYS gets great reviews, very rich and dense!! I top it with chocolate cream cheese icing."
"0","5","While the batter is surprisingly thin, this cake comes out moist and light - and is very versatile. Tastes like a boxed mix, and just as simple to prepare. For those who thought the cake was too bland, try adding 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the boiling water before adding it to the batter. I also used one cup of cocoa like others have suggested. Perfect!"
"0","5","this was a fantastic recipe"
"0","5","Fantastic cake, and will be my #1 cake from now on. Made it for my daughter's first birthday, and although she didn't eat very much of the cake since I had so much frosting on it to distract her, I have been eating her leftovers and it's amazing! It's been sitting in the fridge for two days and it's only getting richer and better, so no worries about making it in advance for an occasion. I actually forgot to add the water in my first batch, and I think it turned out better that way--thicker batter, thicker, richer cake."
"0","5","This is the exact recipe that I made from the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can and it's been around for years. An excellent Chocolate cake indeed!!"
"0","5","Really delicious and very easy. I used 1 full cup of cocoa instead of 3/4 and added chocolate chips...it was very chocolatey and not too sweet really amazing cake, did not even need frosting...just some whip cream or ice cream!"
"0","5","Scrumptious! And so, so SIMPLE. It is very dense and heavy though, so beware! You will definately get your chocolate fix with this recipe!"
"0","3","This recipe took a long time to cook. Not the best recipe I have made but was moist."
"0","5","This is a WONDERFUL basic chocolate cake recipe. Just made it for the first time, followed the directions, and the cake was moist, flavorful and delicious. I made a 9x13 and then cut it in half and made a layer cake. Can anyone recommend a good frosting recipe to go with this?"
"0","4","definitely better the second day as the flavors meld. use good quality cocoa or you'll be sorry."
"0","5","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! It was a hit with the family and I plan to make it again for Christmas. I did up the coco because I do like my cake chocolaty and moist. Yum."
"0","5","This recipe is identical to the other one on Allrecipes called Extreme Chocolate Cake. The only difference is that the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe also has a recipe for frosting. I didn't want that frosting, so I just printed out this recipe. I'm glad I did. I reduced the sugar by about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup and it still tasted heavenly. The batter is so easy to put together, the directions are easy, and nothing was confusing. I baked for 33 minutes, but the bottoms of my cake layers were still a bit gooey. I suggest the entire 35 minutes. I used a bit of cream cheese for the frosting, due to what was available in the fridge. I noted that I wanted more frosting while eating the cake. A good two to three cups of frosting would make this cake a masterpiece complete."
"0","5","Simple, delicious, forgiving, reliable. I am always shocked by how watery it looks and worry that it's going to be a complete train-wreck, but it rises and bakes up perfectly every time."
"0","5","Quick & Easy - very tasty!"
"0","5","so moist and so easy"
"0","5","I could not believe how moist this cake was. I doubled the recipe and made it in a sheet pan for a work birthday party and the entire thing was gone in 30 minutes. I covered it in 'Rich Chocolate frosting' from this site and everyone loved it. The only change I made was using buttermilk in place of the milk, which I think made the cake even richer and more delicious. I will definitely be trying this one again."
"0","5","Used this cake recipe to do my sons robot birthday cake. It was moist and yummy. Just baked it in a sheet cake pan and cut and shaped it into the robot!"
"0","5","This cake was easy to make, smelled amazing, and tasted great too! I did make a couple of changes. I substituted the vegetable oil for butter. Since I didn't have unsweetened cocoa power I used Swiss Miss No Sugar Added (6 packets to be exact). And finally, I added one bar (about 1 teaspoon) of shredded unsweetened chocolate pieces. The cake turned out to be very moist, sticky, and chocolatey."
"0","5","Wow, I am not the biggest chocolate cake fan, but my friend is, so I looked for a recipe that would be tasty -- an hopefully better than a box mix. This recipe was IT! I thought it had wonderful flavor and was very moist with a nice, rich dark color. I used regular Hershay's cocoa, and everyone said 'Oh, you must have used expensive, fancy chocolate'. Will definitely make again. I used 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' from this site and it went great together (I made 1/2 the recipe because I made a raspberry filling to put between the layers), and it was plenty to frost and pipe a couple of rows of shells. ENJOY!"
"0","5","WOW! What a delicious moist cake--and it was sooo simple too! (No more boxed cake mixes needed.) As suggested by others, I increased the cocoa to 1 cup & added a little instant coffee to the water. Also, replaced half the oil w/ applesauce. Excellent & definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","So easy to make and also very forgiving. I wasn't paying attention to the amount of water and added 2 cups of water by mistake. I decided to bake it anyways and see what happened. Poured it into a bundt pan and it turned out perfect! I will make this again, but be sure to double check ingredient amounts:)"
"0","5","So nice to have the moisture of the boxed cake without the list of 50 ingredients. :) Very moist and yummy and so great that it's just in one bowl!"
"0","5","this cake blew my mind. i'm always thinking the more 'sophisticated' recipe will yield the most delectable result but i can fold in all the egg whites i want, when it comes to the perfect cake, this is it. so springy, so moist, everything about it screams sensation. it's my 'go to' cake from now on. making it tomorrow as a last minute request because it comes together so quickly it's worth the effort to be able to say, 'o, yeah. i made that from scratch.'"
"0","5","This recipe came out amazing. I made it for my Dad's birthday and my entire family has been raving about it since. I made a chocolate cream cheese frosting to go with it. Definitely will be making again!"
"0","3","I made this twice within two days. Once for cupcakes and again as a cake for a party. I wasn't impressed with the recipe after tasting the cupcakes. The cupcakes didn't seem to have much flavor, even a day later. I made the cake on Thursday, tasted some on Saturday for the party and still thought it was very bland. Now it's Sunday and I tried a few bites and thought it was improved. How weird is that? It seemed to take a couple of days for the flavor to take hold but I don't know why. Maybe with a more expensive brand of chocolate it would be better? So all in all I'd have to give this recipe three stars for ease of preparation but I can't rate it higher because I didn't feel like it had enough flavor overall."
"0","4","It throws together in a jiff! I think I had this mixed up and in the oven in less than 10 minutes. I was a little disappointed with the flavor, I thought it could have been a little more chocolatly. Then again my husband thought it was great as is, and I am a self confessed chocoholic, so there is always room for more chocolate me!!"
"0","5","This cake is amazing! It's so easy and tastes so much better than a mix. I put raspberry jam in the middle and it was the perfect mix of flavors. I will definitely be making this again!"
"0","5","Awesome cake, easy recipe. Baked 40-45 min in 9x13 glass."
"0","5","I've only just started cooking/baking more seriously about 3 months ago although I did dabble here and there before that. I would definitely rate myself a beginner and this cake was the first recipe I tried on the baking side. Everything turned out FABULOUS! I thought perhaps it was just beginners luck but I'm currently baking this for the third time in so many months and it comes out incredible every time. Everyone loves it and it's been a birthday request from several coworkers/friends. Thanks so much!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious...a success every time and you really cannot mess it up!!! Rich and moist and the only modification I have made is to increase the cocoa powder to 1 cup and use 1/2 cup boiling water and 1/2 cup coffee instead of the full cup boiling water"
"0","5","I've made this recipe, as posted, several times, and have received nothing but rave reviews. Melt-in-your-mouth chocolatey goodness at it's best. Yummy!"
"0","5","served this cake and received rave reviews. it disappeared really quickly! i just baked the second one this week and am waiting for it to cool down so i can put frosting on it and enjoy a slice with an ice cold glass of milk! yum!"
"0","5","I made this cake back in the summer for a Friday night 'family night'. My 5 boys loved it, and devoured it! They loved it so much my 6 year old requested it for his birthday. I made a homemade frosting off the back of the Hershey's cocoa can & it made the cake even richer. It's very good with glass of ice cold milk. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Delicious! I added a shot of espresso and enough water to make 1 cup, but I might do two shots next time, I didnt really get the flavor. Still, the cake is very good. The batter is super thin though, I was worried. turned out fine."
"0","4","this cake is really good! My brother can't get enough of it! it tastes even better after it cools down though. The only reason why i'm not giving it 5 stars is that i ran out of vanilla, so i didn't use it. I bet that it would taste even better with the vanilla. I'll review this recipe again after i make it again, with the vanilla."
"0","5","I love making cakes from scratch and this was simple and VERY delicious cake. I did not have milk so I substituted half and half! And it was fantastic! I actually made a bundt with th entire batter..just baked a bit longer for that but again a VERY delicious and VERY yummy and moist cake!"
"0","4","i used only one egg and 1 3/4cups of sugar but besides that, i followed the recipe exactly as written and it was excellent. like a chocolate sponge cake. will make again."
"0","5","Awesome cake! Great with satin glaze!"
"0","5","This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It was super easy to make, it was moist, wasn't too sweet and it tasted great. I followed the directions exactly and didn't feel that I needed to change a thing. I was really glad they added the warning about the batter being thin or I would have thought I'd done something wrong. This is for sure my go to chocolate cake recipe."
"0","5","Excellent Cake- very simple to make. Based on the reviews, I did increase the cocoa to 1 cup; and instead of water, I used a cup of coffee. I baked it in 9x13 for 40 minutes."
"0","5","this is a cake I have been making for a few years.Kids love it even without frosting. Made once a week for family and friends"
"0","5","Has anyone tried substituting 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil? Looking for a way to reduce the fat content, and I know this works in other recipes."
"0","4","I usued gluten free flour instead of white flour and it was very good.I will defiently make it again.Its very hard to find an easy chocolate cake ,especialy one that doesn't make a huge mess.Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I made this cake for my father in law when he got home from the hospital. I got so many raves about it. My mother had even mentioned that is was better than anything she has ever had out. My father in law, in fact has asked me to make him another cake tonite! Great job on coming up with the recipe....this cake is super moist."
"0","5","This is easy and so good! I've tried other recipes and this is by far my favorite. It's moist and dense just like I think a chocolate cake should be. Just be warned, the batter is very thin, don't panic, that's how it should be. But be careful not to overfill your pan(s) or you will have a mess in your oven! To this day I still have that issue when making cupcakes."
"0","5","I loved this cake! I've made it two times already and I'm making it a third time today. It's so deliiciously moist and chocolaty! Although this is the exact same recipe as the one on the back of the box of Hershey's cocoa powder. Anyhow, it's a wonderful recipe and tastes great with a chocolate ganache recipe on this website."
"0","5","this cake was the best cake ive ever made! it could easily even be the best home-made cake ive ever had! thanks SHIRLEYO!!! =) if it helps.. i had to make a few changes because of some ingredient shortages. i used butter instead of oil. didnt have enough cocoa so put in a bit of cadbury chocolate powder. and since the cocoa wasnt unsweetened, i put in 50g less sugar (which was caster by the way.)even with the changes.. it came out perfect! didnt even need frosting.. moist and rich!! =)"
"0","5","I am a novice baker, but I had no trouble at all mixing up this cake. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cake turned out wonderfullly. Most of the other cakes I have made from scratch have turned out quite heavy, but this cake was light and fluffy, and definitely delicious!"
"0","5","Loved this cake. Very moist and easy to make. Everyone enjoyed it."
"0","5","I love this recipe and use it all the time, so does my husband. Everyone always compliments and it has converted a few of my friends who use box mixes to start making cakes from scratch. Super tasty and moist! We love it with chocolate whipped cream for the frosting."
"0","5","This is by far the best (most moist) chocolate cake you will ever make. I started making this cake when it was 5/5 stars and only 53 people had rated it. It is so easy and the taste is wonderful. I do however use a cream cheese frosting and usually mix in some coconut or chocolate chips (in the frosting)."
"0","5","This recipe is fantastic! I've made it several times, and it has always been a success and met rave reviews. I've added a little extra sugar and it seems to be great. My only problem is that I always struggle to get the cake out of the pan-no matter how much I grease and flour it, the cake always sticks."
"0","5","The taste of this cake was great. It was just moist enough. I did have some difficulty removing the cakes from the pans, however. I ended up with a mess in the bottom of the pan and not-so easy to frost cakes. Admittedly, this could have been an error on my part. As this was a rushed birthday cake, perhaps I didn't grease / flour the pan quite thoroughly enough. I topped the cake with the mousse recipe from Chocolate Mousse Cake IV and layered it with fresh strawberries. It really was a delicious combination."
"0","5","This cake was sooo good! I made this for my brother's birthday and everyone loved it! The only thing I added was an small package of vanilla instant pudding. So moist, so chocolatey, and so DELICIOUS! This is a definate keeper!"
"0","5","I don't generally like cake. And i always think that chocolate cake doesn't taste like chocolate...until now. This is wonderful. We can't stop making it and eating it. Normally, i will bake a cake, and my husband will take it to work to share with his buddies. Usually, he will come home with half the cake left. This time, he made the mistake of taking it to work, and he almost didn't get a piece at all. This recipe is easy, moist, yummy, and serious crowd-pleaser."
"0","4","Yummy!"
"0","5","We loved it!"
"0","5","This is awesome! I used half Splenda and half sugar as well as egg substitute instead of real eggs. Next time I will use at least half whole wheat flour and applesauce as well. I topped it with a great frosting substitute: 1 1.4 oz package chocolate sugar free pudding added to 1 1/4 cup skim milk. Add one 8 oz container sugar free cool whip and fold in with pudding. Spread on cake and sprinkle chocolate chips over it. the cake ended up being a very light and airy dessert! It was perfect!"
"0","5","love this recipe! make it all the time to rave reviews."
"0","5","I made this recipe exactly how it is written. My family loves it, including my mom and dad who hate chocolate cake. I will keep this recipe handy."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and found it was the best tasting cake I've ever made- so good people didn't believe I made it :-)"
"0","5","This cake is awesome!! It is the fourth recipe I have tried in two weeks, and the only one that has come out perfect. This cake was rich, moist, chocolatey, and so easy to make. This will definitely be my go-to cake recipe for now on! I frosted it with a vanilla buttercream, and it was incredible."
"0","3","I thought the chocolate flavor was really good in this cake, and you can't beat how easy it is to put it together, but I felt like mine turned out a bit dry."
"0","5","Delicious Cake!! I cook light, so I made some alterations for a healther cake. I used 1/2 parts whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose. I only used half the oil called for and the other half unsweetened applesauce (if you use all applesauce it would be a VERY dense cake). I also used egg-beaters in place of real eggs and splenda in place of sugar. I used a whole cup of cocoa powder as suggested by other reviewers. The cake was light, fluffy, and tasted great. Next time I think I'll add some chocolate chips as well!!"
"0","5","Oh my, what an amazing cake!! I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting with this cake, and a bunch of college students had no problem devouring it for a friend's birthday. My only suggestion would be to be sure you flour and grease the pans enough. I don't believe I did, and, probably because the batter is so runny, I had a terrible time getting it out of the pans. Nevertheless, the flavor surely wasn't altered. I will definately be making this again for fellow chocolate lovers!"
"0","4","i made this cake for a birthday party i was scared about how thin the batter was but it was so good and everyone loved also i added fresh strawberrys in between the two layers it tasted very good with those added"
"0","5","Moist and delicious, although a little denser than boxed cake. Used apple sauce instead of oil, cake flour, and baked in 9x13' pan for 38 minutes. Thank goodness for the 'watery' note. Pulled away from butter/floured pan beautifully."
"0","5","Delicious cake! I was afraid it wouldn't be chocolately enough, but it turned out perfect! I oiled and floured my pans with flour/cocoa powder and they turned out fine (no sticking)As mentioned in other reviews, the batter is very runny, and I was nervous, but it baked up nicely. I made this in 3 layers (doubled recipe) for my mother in laws bday cake, frosted with whipped chocolate ganache and finished with a poured choc ganache....PERFECT! My new go to choc. cake recipe!"
"0","5","I was very nervous making this , the batter is very thin, not like a regular cake batter , but the result was excellent, very moist ."
"0","5","This cake is delisous! i made it into a butterfinger cake w/ carmel & chocolate syrup and cool whip and butterfingers ontop so delisous!!! :D"
"0","5","Loved it! I also added more cocoa like other reviewers suggested."
"0","5","I love this cake. It is so easy and my kids love it."
"0","4","This cake was quite good, I did up the cocoa to 1 cup and let it sit for a day as some others recommended. However, it still isn't the 'perfect' recipe that I've been looking for, I've had better chocolate cakes. But it is very good and pretty moist."
"0","5","This is my go to cake. I have made it several dozen times. My friends request it for their birthday parties, etc. I usually freeze it before I put frosting on it. It is super moist and difficult to frost if it is at room temperature. Seriously. Best chocolate cake ever!"
"0","5","We LOVED this cake. For me it is not often that I find a cake that I enjoy without any frosting."
"0","5","My eight year old daughter wanted to make a cake from scratch for her birthday. This was the perfect cake. It was very easy to make, and we had all the ingredients on hand. As I was making it, I was a little worried when I added the boiling water because the batter became so thin. But I shouldn't have worried; It was dense, moist and delicious!"
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","2","the cake did not rise and it wasnt sweet!"
"0","5","This cake is wonderful and is so much better than the box mix. My husband sais it is just like his maw-maw used to make!! Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","i've been making this cake for years. it's the same recipe that's on the Hershey's Cocoa tin. my grandkids really enjoy it at birthday time."
"0","5","Alone as is the cake was okay. today it was pretty hot day here were i live so i served it with french vanilla icecream and it was delish."
"0","5","My Hubby and Roomate Josh say it was yummy! There is only a 1/4 left!"
"0","5","I made this for a friends birthday. I cut the recipe in half for a one-layer cake, added some chocolate chips, a dollop of mayonnaise, and used home-made chocolate frosting. everyone loved it!! my one complaint is that it stuck to the pan, which is most likely due to the chocolate chips I used. I'm cooking it again right now, and I'm going to try adding the chocolate chips after a few minutes of baking since the batter is so thin. anyway, this will definitely be the recipe I use for chocolate cake going forward. love it!!"
"0","4","Love, love, love this. Only 4 stars because I altered it. 1 C. coco powder, butter instead of oil and 1 T. instant coffee. So YUM!"
"0","5","OMG..... We loved this cake, my friend from Germany came in so I made it for her. And we devoured it. And my husband said this is the only cake he will eat from now on! I did use a cup of cocoa and sifted all my dry ingredients. The buttercream icing goes great with this...."
"0","4","This cake was very good and very moist! Make sure to spray cake pans very well to keep the cake from sticking! Went great with buttercream frosting."
"0","5","WONDERFUL! This is going to be the only chocolate cake that I make from now on. I would suggest using one cup of coco powder instead of three-fourths though."
"0","4","Pretty good. Nothing spectacular"
"0","4","When I first made this cake my family loved it, but it seemed way too oily for me. However, like a previous reviewer mentioned if you let it sit a day or two it gets much better. This is a great cake if you are looking for something easy and fast to make, but I recommend it more if you can let it sit a day. Makes really good cupcakes too."
"0","4","While the flavor is wonderful the cakes performance in terms of presentation is just not consistent. Sometimes it will turn out beautifully and sometimes it will look less than desirable. I've used it for both cakes and cupcakes and have had mixed results with both. Again wonderful flavor but it won't be my go to recipe for birthday cakes or cupcakes, just not consistent enough."
"0","5","The only change I made was making this cake with specialty dark chocolate and 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of boiling water. It is so delicious....my family loves this recipe! Mmmmmmmmm.... I make it all the time."
"0","5","Incredible! I used 1 cup of cocoa as suggested by another review! Awesome. Just took a small bite, not even frosted yet! Might just sprinkle it with powdered sugar...that's how good it is!!"
"0","5","I made this for a birthday party one day before. It was very moist the next day and was the first cake to be devoured. I did add the mini choc. chips to the top and it was perfect...a keeper. I will make this again...soon."
"0","5","I was just reminded of this Hershey's recipe when searching the site for a quick dessert. I have it in my own recipe file but hadn't made it in a long time. I made a couple of changes this time: used buttermilk (because I had it on hand) and baked in a 13X9 pan for about 40 minutes. Wonderful, no frosting required. Served with sliced berries and vanilla ice cream. Guests enjoyed it and had no clue how easy it was. This is a keeper."
"0","4","Instead of cake, I made cupcakes! The recipe was easy and made tasty cupcakes, but they were too moist/wet. I would make this again, but just add less boiling water. Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer and increased the cocoa a bit."
"0","5","Very yummy! I am planning on using this recipe again and adding choc chips this time!"
"0","5","This is a keeper. The best chocolate cake ever."
"0","4","I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, as suggested by other reviewers. The cake was very rich.. maybe a little too rich. Otherwises, it was very good. A little too soft and crumbly."
"0","5","Delicious and moist! I used a 9 x 13 pan and baked it for 40 minutes. A few alterations I made: used brewed coffee in place of the water, and substituted 3 tablespoons of black cocoa powder for 3 of the tablespoons of regular cocoa powder (gives chocolate flavor more depth). Amazing with caramel frosting!"
"0","5","This cake is incredibly easy to make and tastes delicious. This was my first time to make a homemade cake from scratch and it turned out awesome!"
"0","5","Very easy and fun to make. Comes out deliciously moist and flavorful; goes well with any frosting!"
"0","5","This was a delicious and moist cake. I had just ran out of vanilla and so I used orange oil instead. It was perfect. I would definitely use this recipe again."
"0","3","I was hoping to make this my 'go-to-recipe' like many others. It definately was NOT aweful, but wasn't outstanding. I hope to reattempt it with possibly a better outcome. My issue was that my cake was extremely fudgy, too dense, almost more brownie-like than cake-like. I was prepared for the extreme wateriness prior to baking but mine wasn't as 'wet' as I expected. I believed that I followed the recipe as written, but like I said, I hope to try it again with better results. Still, it's worth a try, !"
"0","5","This cake is AWESOME! I've had trouble in the past making a cake from scratch, because it often comes out dense. Not this cake, it was light and chocolately ... it was SO good. I was so proud of this cake & my husband (his birthday) LOVED it :) I will be using this recipe anytime I need a chocolate cake - Goodbye boxed cake!"
"0","4","This cake was very easy to make and has simple ingredients that one would usually have on hand. I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings and it came out great and super moist. It is not sweet so maybe next time I will add a little more sugar. But overall a great recipe that I will definitely be making again."
"0","5","Delicious, simple recipe. Moist with rich chocolate flavour. Good on it's own but fantastic when complemented by frosting, berries etc."
"0","5","Very tasty!! Only took a few minutes to put together and completely satisfied my chocolate craving. Even better the next day. I topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and it turned out great. I will be making this again."
"0","5","Ok, this was the fastest and easiest cake I have ever made. It was better the next day after it cooled. It seemed fluffy when it was hot but when it cooled, it became this dense, moist, delicious mouthwatering cake. I didn't even put icing on it. I made it in a bundt cake pan (cooked for 55 mins) and sprinkled a little bit of powdered sugar on top just for decoration. It took me about 10 minutes from start to get it in the oven. I made it exactly as specified - no variations at all. It didn't need anything else. I was expecting it to just be ok. But it was EXCELLENT! Update 10/18/09 - Ok, since my last review I've made this cake at least a dozen times. I keep all of the ingredients incase I hear that someone is coming, and it's a huge hit with guests. I have had some failure getting a nice bundt cake with this recipe because it's so extremely moist that the top sometimes falls off in the pan, but it's never bothered anyone. Today I made it in a 9x9 pan and it's nice and thick. It was wonderful according to this recipe, but for variation I've added a tsp of cinnamon and a big pinch of red chili powder. Makes a unique and wonderful flavor. The longer it sits the more moist it gets. Soooooo good."
"0","5","This cake was fricken fantastic! I made a mistake and mixed in the boiling water with all the other ingredients instead of at the very end, and it still turned out excellent!"
"0","5","Excellent results - it had the moistness and even consistency of a box cake, but with 100x more flavor. I added some dark chocolate chips for some added richness."
"0","5","This was amazing! I have always been the only one in my family that loves chocolate cake, and this recipe wowed even the pickiest of eaters. My fiance's brother in law is a chef and he asked me to make this cake for his birthday. Not one person had a bad thing to say about this cake. This will ALWAYS be my new chocolate cake recipe! Thank you for sharing :)"
"0","5","This cake was awesome! I too increased the cocoa to 1 cup. I made cupcakes with it and they turned out great. Cook them for 15-20 min.(really depends on your oven and pan you use). This is my new 'go to' cake!!! Thanks!"
"0","5","O-MY-GOOOOOOD this was the best chocolate Cake I've ever eaten their are three of us in the house and the cake was gone in less than 24 hours"
"0","5","This was my first time making a cake not using a boxed cake mix. It was so easy and turned out really moist. I did up the cocoa to 1 cup as recommended by other reviews and I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (doubled the recipe) from this website as well. Thanks for such a good easy recipe I will be making this one again."
"0","5","Moist, delicious, tender and dark. Filled two 9-inch round pans perfectly. Do use 1 cup cocoa. A keeper."
"0","5","So moist and delicious! Tasted like it could be from a bakery. Loved the texture. I upped the cocoa a bit per others suggestions and frosted with the Rich Chocolate frosing also on this site."
"0","5","This was my first cake that I made from scratch and it was super easy and tasty! I made it for my 3 year old's birthday party and I was asked where I had bought it at!"
"0","5","I will never buy a cake mix again!"
"0","5","OK, this is my go-to chocolate cake recipe, and now thanks to you,my entire family's go-to. To give you an idea of how moist this cake is the youngest boy in the family said for his birthday he wanted 'that mushy chocolate cake' (he didnt know the word was moist). Now my mom and aunt have been making it almost every week and topping it with 7 minute frosting. YUM! Thanks for an easy recipe with staple pantry ingredients you can make any time."
"0","5","This was very good. (Well, that's what I was told. I don't like cake.) I used the recommendations and added 1 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup boiling water, left it in the fridge overnight and frosted it the next day. I made it for a birthday party. Even the people that don't normally like chocolate cake liked this cake."
"0","5","Great for cupcakes. I halved the recipe and made 12 perfect cupcakes. There was also no residue oil/grease underneath the cupcakes papers when they were removed from the tin. Good taste and texture too."
"0","5","very moist and delicious"
"0","5","Great flavor, and very moist! Will make this again."
"0","5","Delicious cake. I made only one layer (half the recipe) so there would not be too much left over. Frosted with one bowl buttercream icing for a lovely Sunday night dessert. Thanks!"
"0","3","A good, reliable and tasty chocolate cake recipe."
"0","5","I'm definately making this again!"
"0","5","Always turns out perfectly! I made cupcakes once from this recipe; just bake them for about 20 minutes. Sometimes I add a full cup of cocoa powder, sometimes just the prescribed 3/4 cup... it doesn't seem to matter too much either way. I use only whole wheat flour in my recipes and this recipe works well with the flour substitution."
"0","5","Omigosh. WOW. these are so good. i made them into little ramekins, because in my family we like little proportions. i filled them with walnuts and chocolate and coffee. Try it. its really just amazing."
"0","4","Yummy"
"0","5","Very delicious! My husband (who does not really enjoy cake) said it was super moist. I used a chocolate ganache frosting. Amazing results!"
"0","5","Great recipe, super easy, delicious outcome. This is now my standard chocolate cake recipe, I love it!"
"0","5","I just made these as cupcakes and was very pleased! It's moist and tastes great, I can't wait to make it as a cake next time! I used a full cup of cocoa (Ghiradeli) and sifted the cocoa as well."
"0","5","This cake was wonderful. It was light, moist, and full of chocolate flavor. This is definitely a keeper."
"0","5","SO delicious and easy! I wanted a chocolate cake and had no mixes at home. I decided to give this a try and I think I wont be going back to box cakes. It was so moist and most of all easy to make! I was always afraid of scratch cakes, not anymore! I made it with the Chocolate Frosting I here on this site, delicious!! The only change I made was adding instant coffee to boiling water! Thanks, and who cares where it comes from, it is the best chocolate cake recipe!"
"0","5","excellent"
"0","5","I don't care where the recipe came from because as my kids would say, 'It's the bomb!' Very moist and chocolaty."
"0","5","I've read the other reviews, and honestly I don't care where the recipe comes from. It's awesome and I love it! It's my go-to chocolate cake from now on. Everyone who tries it absolutely loves it."
"0","5","Next time I make this, I'm not even going to ice it. It is so moist, tender and chocolaty, it doesn't need frosting! We absolutely loved this cake! Thanks!"
"0","5","Wonderful, moist, easy cake. This one will be in my recipe book forever. Very versatile...I was out of oil so I used margrine and it was easy and totally yummy on the first try."
"0","5","Easy recipe. Very good although I did use 1 cup of cocoa to add more chocolate flavor. Will use again and maybe add some mini chips next time."
"0","5","This was easy and it came out GREAT. My wife couldn't believe something this tasty came out of our kitchen. It was moist and delicious."
"0","5","Hmm...very yummy! very moist and very chocolaty! One of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made! I followed some reviewer's advice and increased the cocoa but that's not necessary. Do exactly what the recipe says, and you'll get a very, very good chocolate cake!"
"0","5","This is the best cake recipe I've ever made! Absolutely fantastic - I'll never use another box mix for chocolate cake again! I used it to make cupcakes, and added chocolate chips in once I had spooned the batter into the muffin cups. They all sunk to the bottom but were delish anyway!"
"0","5","OMG! This cake is the best!"
"0","5","Love this! It's easy and super moist!"
"0","4","Thought this was excellent. Up'ed the cocoa and used a little less water. Turned out pretty well. I made cupcakes - the ones in the silicone trays were a pain to remove...I'm still learning."
"0","5","Delicious and super moist cake. Great cake!"
"0","4","I just made this cake today and it was a success. I didn't have the milk so substituted plain yogurt and with about a 1/2 cup (organic) sugar later, it was great. The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because it is actually almost too moist! I made jumbo cupcakes (without papers) and couldn't get them out of the pan very well. I'll use cupcake papers next time. Oh, I also baked for about 5 minutes longer. Very good and the fam loved, too."
"0","5","i made this cake for a family reunion and it turned out great!"
"0","5","Great chocolate cake recipe. I halved it and used it to make cupcakes, made a dozen perfectly. It was very moist, and not super sweet, but still tasted great. No changes to the recipe, works great as is."
"0","4","i followed the recipe word by word but the center didnt cook at all.though i baked all the batter in a springform pan. tastes very good with a great chocolatey taste but the center was very gooey ,didnt cook at all even after 45 min.it rose well. the top was hard.so i had to cut the cake leaving the center.iam giving this 4 stars since the the kids loved it and the cake didnt get wasted. i will still try this for its chocolatey taste next time and post my views again."
"0","5","Made as written and turned out great. The best chocolate cake I've ever made. Super moist. And yes, it is super thing when you pour the batter into the pans. It turned out fantastic!"
"0","5","I just used this recipe for cupcakes, i had enough batter for 29 cupcakes and baked them for about 15 min per 2 trays. they came out very good! very simple recipe and i love the fact that there's little cleanup afterwards"
"0","5","Very good moist and chocolaty! Great Quick very yummy cake!"
"0","5","The best chocolate cake recipe I have tried, so moist and delicious! My family loved it, I frosted it with some cream cheese frosting. Very easy to make."
"0","4","This was very good, very moist! Made it the day before as many mentioned. I added about a teaspoon of powdered instant coffee to intensify the flavor"
"0","5","Wow - what a great & simple recipe! I used my kitchenaid mixer & it took only seconds. I split the recipe in half and made 12 cupcakes. I baked them at 350 for about 18 mins (give or take). The batter is REALLY thin, but do not worry - it works! I loved the end results.. I ended up eating 3 after taking them out of the oven.... FANTASTIC! :) [Update] this is totally the recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can - BUT the better quality chocolate you have, Ghiradelli or Blommers makes this cake incredible! Yum!"
"0","5","Indeed, this is a delicious cake! I made it for my son's birthday for a German chocolate cake and it came out perfect. I increased the cocoa to an exact 1 cup measurement. Moist and fluffy, not dry at all. This recipe has already been saved as my standard chocolate cake recipe. Thanks a bunch!"
"0","5","Yum! I have made this recipe twice and both times have not been disappointed. I find the cake stays moist for days and it's really flavorful even after a few days. I make this recipe with the chocolate ganache recipe on this site. DELISH!"
"0","5","This is my new, go-to chocolate cake recipe. I halved the recipe and made 12 large cupcakes, which I baked for ~24 minutes at 350. Frosted with chocolate cream cheese frosting and peanut butter frosting."
"0","5","the best cake i use extra cocoa."
"0","5","very easy and and fast, with a tastey chocolately result. I have made this cake more than a dozen times. Used chocolate gangache as filling and to cover the cake then decorated with strawberries. Another option I did which everyone loved was to fill it with hazelnut cream (tasted like ferrerro rocher) then covered the cake with chocolate ganache. On top of that I put this: make crepes, very sweet crepes, making sure to make them very very thin and cook them till crispy. Then break them up to make some sort of flakes and decorate the cake with them. I think something like that can be found in speciallized shops but I don't know what they are called. Enjoy watching the cake disapear piece by piece:)"
"0","5","Simple ingredients and preparation, delicious chocolate cake- this is a great recipe to have on hand that I will make again and again."
"0","5","This is the onliest choclate cake i make and have been making it for years. It never fails, if you manage to mess this recipe up then you should give up baking."
"0","5","So moist and easy. Never buying cake mix again. Especially with all the chemical #%$^ they put in those things."
"0","4","Really great recipe, simple.  I increased cocoa (per recommendations to 1 cup). I also decreased sugar by 1/3 and would probably reduce it a bit more. I like the flavor of cocoa over the sugar. Was curious about sea salt, which I used instead of table salt (prefer it in all my cooking) and it didn't affect the flavor noticeably. This is a keeper."
"0","5","OHH MY!! Made recipe as described and loved it. It was the cake I used with Coconut and Pecan Frosting. Made great German Chocolate cake!!!"
"0","5","I made this cake for my family. My husband doesn't like homemade chocolate cakes - he says he prefers the box ones. However, he said this was a really good cake...and it was! I made it in a rectagular pan instead of round ones. I iced it with a peanut butter icing (it was actually fudge that didn't set up!) and it was fabulous!!! Even if this was found on the cocoa box, thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","great recipe."
"0","5","Doesn't matter where the recipe originated...this makes excellent chocolate cake! I used the recipe on this site for Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting SUBMITTED BY: k. blackburn and I think it was the best cake I've ever made."
"0","5","Excellent cake! I did not make any changes to the recipe. The cake is moist and delicious! I made it with the 'Heavenly Chocolate Mousse' from this website."
"0","5","Oh my goodness! This was my first time baking a cake from scratch, as I'm not much of a baker. The cake turned out fantastic - chocolatey, moist and perfect consistency. I had to cook for 35 minutes in my 9x13' pan for the cake to be done. The cake was moister and tastier the day after it was baked and continued to be tasty for the week after. Yum! Try it today!"
"0","5","Yummy! Followed the directions exacty - it was easy and baked up beautifully."
"0","5","I made this exactly as stated except for made them into cupcakes! This was one of the best cake recipes so far I've made!! It went great with the Chocolate Marshmallow Frosting from this site! Everyone love them!"
"0","5","I needed a quick birthday cake and this was it. It was wonderful with a rich chocolate tasgte. I used a filling of white chocolate (box of white chocolate pudding, 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup 10 X sugar. Mix together and add an 8 ounce container of cool whip. It makes a wonder filling or frosting. I than topped the cake with a chocolate ganacho. If you are a chocolate lover this is heaven on earth."
"0","5","Best chocolate cake recipe from scratch. I have tried many with poor results. This is absolutely delicious and the texture is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly. Will never make a boxed chocolate cake again or try another chocolate cake recipe."
"0","5","Thank you 'shirleyo' for this great recipe. My kids loved this cake. I live in France and am always happy to make my kids food from my childhood from scratch, frosting, for example, doesn't even exist here so I always make it from scratch."
"0","4","I made this recipe for cupcakes when I then piped chocoalte ganash inside then topped with cream cheese frosting. I received high praises, but I would have preferred a fudgier cake next time. This one seemed oily and the holes were too large, I prefer a denser cake."
"0","4","Yes, it's the same recipe as on the back of the Hershey container, but it's also a very good cake! If I hadn't found it on here first, I wouldn't have ever noticed it on the container, so thanks for posting it!"
"0","4","I doubled up this recipe and baked it in mini loaf pans for my son's birthday...I made him a train cake. Coupled with white wedding cake frosting, it was delicious. Despite sifting it a lot, it was quite dense, which is why I am rating it only four stars."
"0","5","Super simple and super delicious."
"0","5","A great easy birthday cake."
"0","5","I signed up to bring in a baked item for a work dessert contest. I made this cake with 1 cup cocoa. Layered cakes with raspberry preserves in btwn the layers & made sure preserves oozed from btwn layers, iced (top only) with milk choc. (store)icing, put stripes of raspberry preserves (heated up in the jar first) on top and swirled it in icing; then sprinkled with mini choc. chips. I won third place - YUM!"
"0","5","This was the first time I ever made a cake that wasnt boxed! I will NEVER go back again! this cake was AWESOME!"
"0","5","I give this one a 10! It was so easy and tasted great! I topped it with a rich chocolate frosting and it was perfect. Everyone loved it. I am done buying cake mixes."
"0","5","This was the best cake recipe I've ever made. I was surprised at how easy it was too. No more time consuming than boxed and WAY better. I'll never buy another boxed chocolate cake.  ADDED 06-29-10 just wanted to say I'm still making this same cake and have passed the recipe along several times. It is a keeper!"
"0","5","Excellent cake. We used Lonna Brown and Roweena's suggestions and it turned out perfectly. The frosting I used was Chocolate Cream Frosting, and I took chellebelle's suggestion to make it have a nice chocolate whipped cream texture."
"0","5","I cut the sugar by half and used a cup of cocoa and it was lovely and rich! So moist and delicious, and easy. By far the easiest cake recipe, almost as easy as a boxed cake mix.  I made these as cupcakes, so reduced cooking to 25minutes."
"0","4","This was extremely chocolate-y! After letting it sit the flavor wasn't so chocolate-y!"
"0","4","delicious and very fluffy."
"0","4","was good would try next time less water and more cocoa"
"0","5","Great! I made this as a birthday cake several times and everyone loved it! And it's quick and easy to make."
"0","4","I increased the cocoa to one cup and decreased the water to 3/4 cup. Otherwise, left everything else the same. It tasted a bit odd the first day, but by day 2, it was pretty good. I used Peanut Butter frosting with it, and everyone seemed to like it."
"0","5","Everyone loved it!!!"
"0","5","This recipe makes a nice, moist and dark chocolate cake. Very easy to make and great results. I've used it for two birthday cakes recently, using the fudge icing from the Buttermilk Chocolate Cake on this site. Great combination and no actual chocolate used, just cocoa powder. Enjoy!"
"0","5","Chocolate goodness! This was VERY moist and tasted more like a brownie than a cake. I made it for a birthday party and covered it with a fondant and it held up well. Everyone loved the cake and I LOVE that it only messes up one bowl!"
"0","3","I used 1 cup of cocoa, and only about 3/4 cup of boiling water, into which I mixed in a teaspoon of instant coffee. For me this cake was just okay. Right after baking, it had a bit of a 'tinny' taste, but the taste did improve after a day. I would like a chocolate cake that is a little more dense, rich, and chocolatey (using something other than water for moisture). If you like a lighter chocolate cake, this recipe might be good for you."
"0","5","Soooo good! Super moist, and just the right amount of chocolate flavor. The only change I made was to use buttermilk. BTW, the batter is REALLY thin when you stick it in the oven. Best chocolate cake I've ever had. Will definitely make it again!"
"0","5","Love It! So simple to make- but taste so very good. Made it for a birthday everyone licked their plates clean. My new stand by. Frosted with the rich chocolate frosting from this site. My family pours unwhipped whipping cream on our chocolate cake, this was absolutely delectable!!!"
"0","5","I made this cake for my sisters birthday and i must tell you that it is fantastic! I dont even like cake and i found myself reaching for more helpings. So rich and moist, it got rave reviews. I topped it with an icing sugar and cream cheese frosting. I doubled the recipe which perfectly fit in 2 9x13 pans for a double layer cake. Next time i will try filling the middle with something. I also lined the pans with aluminum foil sprayed with cooking spray to prevnent sticking. That way you can just pull the cake out without them breaking and sticking to the pan. They never stick to the foil. I also liked how easy and fast this recipe was to put together..barely takes longer than a box mix. This will be my chocolate cake recipe from now on."
"0","5","This cake was really good. I don't even like chocolate all that much, & I thought it was great! :) I made it for my sister's birthday, & I used a chocolate cream cheese frosting, & everyone was very impressed! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!"
"0","5","This is the best and EASIEST cake I've ever made, and eveyone I have made it for asks for the recipes. Tastes the best with homemade whipping cream. I also add extra cocoa."
"0","4","This cake was delicious and moist but I didn't use a big enough baking tin and it bubbled and overflowed out of the oven and all over the floor. The mixture is very runny so use a large tin and not a flexible rubber pan like I did."
"0","5","It helps a lot to dissolve the cocoa in the boiling water, and then add it to the rest of the mixed up cake batter.   mmmm.... can't wait for it to come out of the oven!"
"0","5","Made them into cupcakes, and it's the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Very moist and full of chocolate flavor!"
"0","5","This is an extremely delicious recipe.. very moist and good cupcakes - love it."
"0","5","The best chocolate cake i have ever had."
"0","5","OMG!! So delish & moist. I can't believe how easy this was to make. My family loved this. I was pretty proud of myself since my last attempt at from 'scratch' choc. cake took so long to make and was a disaster. The only change I made was adding mini choc. chips. It is so chocolatey it doesn't need frosting just a big glass of milk to wash it down. Will definetly make again & again!"
"0","3","I have had better Chocolate Cakes. Recipe turned out bland."
"0","5","The best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. I used the CHocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting also from this site and it was divine! Good and solid for covering in fondat as well. :-)"
"0","5","Very good indeed, just used half of the ingredients, cause I didn't want to make a very big cake. It turned out really nice anyway. My boyfriend loved it even though he likes 'healthier' cakes!!! Thanks for great recipe. =)"
"0","4","this is pretty good... i do have another chocolate cake recipe that i like better so i will probably just be making that instead"
"0","5","this recipe is THE BEST. I made it for my cousin's 21st birthday and it was just awesome. I also cut the cake lengthwise into two pieces and then i made some strawberry cream and put it in the middle and top. In addition, I made some spun sugar for decoration. :) I highly highly highly recommend this recipe."
"0","5","I made this cake after many failed attempts at producing a luscious, moist, chocolaty, cake. Homemade cakes have alsways been too dry for my taste. I actually preferred boxed cake mix- until I found this recipe! So easy to make, and wonderfully scrumptious! I've already put it in my recipe box to be made again and again."
"0","4","This was a very good chocolate cake recipe! I took the advice of others and sifted the dry ingredients. I added about half of the water that the recipe called for and the batter was still thin. I made cupcakes...they turned out great."
"0","5","Best cake I have ever had!"
"0","5","This was great! I've avoided making cake from scratch for a long time because every time it turns out dry or blah, but this was perfect, just like it came from a box! I iced it with chocolate buttercream icing. I also used coconut milk because my son is lactose intolerant."
"0","5","Oh my god, amazing. Best chocolate cake I have had in a long time, and it took mere minutes to throw together!"
"0","5","Wonderful cake, especially with Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe."
"0","5","Fabulous! Friends loved it!"
"0","5","Very moist cake. I substituted apple sauce for the oil and it was great! Who needs boxed cakes! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Fantastic!"
"0","5","This was the best it was so rich it nearly killed my husband....jk"
"0","5","I have been making this cake for years I love it"
"0","5","This cake is SO delicious! It was my first attempt at a cake not from a box, and I will never go back - especially because I can control the ingredients - no hydrogenated oils or weird preservatives! I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 35 minutes and it turned out great!"
"0","5","Really yummy and moist. I made a 9x13 cake and baked for about 40 minutes. I frosted it with 'Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting' from this site. They paired really well. Thanks for the great recipe! :)"
"0","5","OMG, this is awesome and so easy. I even lowered the fat by using 1/4 cup applesause and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup oil. Also this is so sweet and moist you don't even need frosting, I just baked mine in a bundt pan for 35 min and dusted with powdered sugar. Tasted and looked great."
"0","4","Everything about this cake is a 5, except for the assembly of it. That was my only concern. I always make absolutely sure not to over mix my batters, but when this one said to just dump everything in one bowl i was nervous about how 'light' it would turn out. While it was dense and moist, it was a little too 'compact' for my taste. However I will definately make again, but next time I will start with a creaming method and sift the dry ingredients. (I filled mine with a choc. pudding layer, then frosted...soooo good!)"
"0","5","Oh my goodness this cake was sooo moist! For some reason, it seems to taste even better the next day. Maybe it picks up some of the moisture from the frosting. I've made this more than once and have halved the recipe without a problem. Fantastic!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe for chocolate cake from scratch. I made this and the 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' recipe here on allrecipe.com, but using the two together was a little over the top."
"0","5","Paired with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site, this cake was unbelievable! Super moist, delicious, and easy. I halved the recipe for a 9x9 pan."
"0","5","Love it! I like to scatter chocolate chips over the top before baking, and ice with a cooled ganache (cream and chocolate). This cake is definitely better the next day or after freezing and defrosting."
"0","5","every chocolate cake lover i know loves this cake really good with ricks buttercream from this site!!"
"0","5","I was really surprised to have to add the boiling water at the end, because it made the batter very thin. However, it also made it really moist and delicious! I used the Chocolate Cheese Frosting from this website and they worked great together. Also, I used two cake tins, when they cakes were completely cooled, I cut the cakes in half and added the icing, so it had 3 extra layers of frosting! Won't be using a box anymore, thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","This is amazing. I got gave reviews from my girl friends!"
"0","5","The BEST chocolate cake I've ever made/eaten!"
"0","5","Added extra cocoa and frosted with 'White Cake Frosting I' turned out amazing :) baked beautifully with a good chocolate taste"
"0","5","This is now the recipe I use for all my birthday cakes. It always turns out great, and I get great comments! Never baking a cake from a box again!"
"0","5","Really great! Can be made really quickly and tastes great! Will try making cupcakes with this next time for a BBQ"
"0","5","Awesome! My fiance was craving a chocolate cake and I found this recipe. What a hit! Used safflower oil (the one healthy item in the whole mix) and I didn't use a mixer...just mixed by hand. Topped with chocolate ganache from this site. We each had a two slices and I kept a couple slices for my son and my Mom...the rest my fiance took to work and it was devoured."
"0","5","This was a fabulous recipe. I cut it in half, but used 1/2 cup of cocoa and made cupcakes. i was also worried about how thin it was but they turned out perfect, I will definitely use this recipe again. Easy and very yummy! Thanks for posting."
"0","4","This was a good chocolate cake. Really easy to make and good to have when you don't have any chocolate cake mix on hand."
"0","5","Excellent Recipe!! I, based on other reviews, increased the cocoa to one cup and added a teaspoon of espresso powder to the water to bring out the taste of the chocolate a little more. I also only had a choice between skim milk and heavy whipping cream in my fridge and of course opted for the cream and the results were WONDERFUL!!!! I made cupcakes and they came out light and fluffy- this is a great recipe for a light, fluffy cake- if you are looking for a denser cake this isnt for you! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Oh so good. Very easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of substituting spelt flour for all purpose flour."
"0","5","Great and simple cake. I took the advice of others and and used 1 cup of cocoa powder and it was wonderful."
"0","5","I reduced the water by 1/4 cup in exchange for Kahlua and added 1 tsp cinnamon for a Mexican twist. I upped the cocoa to 3/4 cup and added chocolate chips to the top. This cake got rave reviews."
"0","5","Thank you so much for this recipe! These were such a hit! I made cupcakes with no problem, didn't change a thing, they came out so moist and it was so easy to make! My health-nut of a boyfriend had 3-one after the other! This is a keeper...no more box mix!"
"0","5","I've used this recipe frequently. Once when a planned dessert failed I was able to whip this cake together at the last minute. I have used left over coffee in place of water with great results. When combined with cream cheese frosting the cake had an 'Oreo' cookie flavor. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","This really is the most wonderful chocolate cake, not to mention the fact that most bakers will have all the ingredients on hand anyway. I made these as cupcakes with buttercream icing...but what I did was half regular buttercream, and the other half, I made with ORANGE buttercream. Instead of adding milk and vanilla to the icing, added the same amount of orange juice and a little orange zest...c'mon....what a combination. Anyway, while I find a lot of chocolate cakes end up looking fantastic and tasting ordinary (especially store bought), this one is superior because it looks and tastes so intensely chocolaty. Enjoy!"
"0","5","THIS IS A PERFECT CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE.I MADE THE 'RICH CHOCOLATE FROSTING' AND IT WAS DELICIOUS AS WELL.FOR THE FILLING I USED THE 'FLUFFY WHITE FILLING' BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT.IT HAS NO FLAVOUR."
"0","5","I had made a chocolate cake with hot fudge sauce for my family's Easter dessert, but the cake was a disaster. I made this one at the last minute as an attempt to save Easter dessert, and it was fantastic. Very easy to make and resulted in a nice, rich, moist chocolate cake. Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic, very moist and full of flavor."
"0","5","This cake was moist and it came out of the pan very easily. I put in caremel and chocolate chips to put in some extra flavour."
"0","4","Really good! Made it in a 9X13' pan w/o any trouble! The best chocolate snack cake around!"
"0","5","Very moist!"
"0","5","I have made this three times now, and every time has been fast, easy-peasy, and with perfect results. A moist and springy rich-flavoured cake. I LOVE it. I halve the recipe and make one small cake in one 9' tin."
"0","5","Very moist and taste, it goes great with a cream cheese frosting."
"0","4","I liked this because I already had everything I needed to make this cake. It wasn't my favorite but it was good and my friends ate it all. It was also very easy and very moist. I frosted with the chocolate marshmallow frosting which I highly recommend."
"0","5","Wow, this was excellent. My husband and I are not chocolate cake fans but I needed a recipe for a birthday cake. Tried this for the first time and we both thought it was a great recipe. I did not do anything different. It came out very moist. This one is a keeper."
"0","4","I made chocolate cupcakes with this recipe. I added about 8 ounces of chocolate (Bakers Semi sweet chocolate squares) for 24 serving. I found that even though I added chocolate to the recipe, it wasnât as sweet as I thought it was going to be. I would hate to think how bland the cupcakes would have been if I did not add chocolate. Not a bad basic chocolate cake recipe but I would recommend adding a bar of chocolate if you are looking for a strong chocolate flavour."
"0","5","Great recipe! I have made many chocolate cakes before this one and...this is it. It has more flavor than others and doesn't taste like water. I used chocolate frosting 1 on this site as a topping and it went very well.Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Mmmm...I used this with the recipe for Texas Chocolate Frosting!"
"0","5","I would give this TEN stars if I could. It's awesome!~  I made it with coffee instead of water. It is moist and tasty!  I finished my cake with a buttercream frosting with raspberry filling. pretty awesome!  I used one recipe for a 10' x 3' pan, and it baked for 50 minutes. I used a heating core in the center."
"0","5","This recipe is identical to the one that I've been using for years. It's a family favorite, and the only chocolate cake recipe I've used in the last twenty years. It's reliable and always moist. I have yet to taste a chocolate cake recipe that I prefer.  It's only flaw is that it tends to fall--but I live in Colorado at 6,000 feet, so just about everything falls. I add a little extra flour and reduce the sugar and leavening by about an eighth to make up for the high altitude."
"0","5","Congratulations Shirley on a really quick, easy, tasty, moist and fool-proof recipe !  Thank you, also, Lonna Brown, for giving the 9x13 pan timing ... it was exactly what I wanted to make last week.  I had promised to make a Scooby Doo Mystery Mansion birthday cake for one of my grandchildren, so needed a non-sickly cake that didn't mind being cut into awkward shapes and stuck back together again !  This cake is not only light and moist, but it cuts a treat.  They say children are the world's severest critics ... well, I hope you'll be pleased to know that eighteen 5-6 year old Irish kiddies tucked in with a will and came back for seconds !  I'll definitely be making this one again and I might - if I'm lucky - manage to get a proper slice, rather than a few mouthfuls from the leftover trimmings.  Many thanks, Anonany"
"0","5","YUM this is everything a chocolate cake should be! This reminds me of being a child. this recipe will now be the only chocolate cake recipe i use :)"
"0","3","I made this cake again and the only change I made was using melted butter instead of oil. I did notice the difference between a home made chocolate cake vs boxed, but I don't know if it's worth the effort. Everyone thought it was just average."
"0","5","I give this five stars because it's super easy to make, very moist and it made a great birthday cake for my 4 year old. I might add more cocoa next time, as I really, really love rich chocolate but as a cake with icing and decorations it's sweetness is absolutely perfect for everyone. I used Rick's buttercream frosting with amendments according to suggestions made and it was great. The batter easily made two 8*8 pans (you could squeeze out a little more into a loaf pan if necessary.) Thanks for the recipe and letting us know that the batter is runny."
"0","5","Delicious - made this for my sister's birthday with chocolate frosting. Easy, quick and all natural - better tasting than box mix and better for you."
"0","5","Great recipe .Really moist.I used organic sugar and reduced the amount by 1/4 cup .I also used half white flour and half wholewheat flour .Still light and dreamy in the end ."
"0","5","Great cake and sooo easy! I frosted each layer with store bought non dairy whipped topping and cherry pie filling and the sides with more whipped topping. It would make a great valentine cake."
"0","5","Wow! So easy and moist!!! Everyone who I make this for says its the best they have had. For icing I whip a container of cream and then add a container of store bought icing for the perfect light and creamy whipped topping that is just the right amount of sweetness."
"0","5","this cake was absolutly amazing!! i followed the recipe exactly, and spread raspberry jam in the middle and chocolate frosting everywhere else. It was so moist and delicious! definetly a keeper."
"0","4","This cake was great and really moist. I needed something quick and easy for my boyfriend's birthday, and this only took about 15 minutes to mix up. I used store-bought chocolate frosting because I was low on time and then decorated the cake with M&Ms. It made an ultra cute birthday cake!"
"0","5","I've never attempted a chocolate cake before, and but this was one of the easiest cakes I've ever baked, and it is definitely the best tasting chocolate cake I've ever had. I chose this recipe for a casual dinner party, and it was completely devoured.   A few notes about the recipe: -The batter is incredibly thin. And it terrified me the first time, but it creates a moist, delicious cake.  -I added in semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Even with the thin batter, there were little chocolatey morsels throughout the cake. -I prefer a bundt pan, it's easier than the two layer cake -instead of frosting, I lightly dusted with powdered sugar  Again, it was an absolute hit (people were asking for seconds!) and the next day I was craving another piece but since it was all gone...I just made another cake!"
"0","4","thanks for sharing this recipe! my family and friends love it too. the moisture reminds me of a well-cooked pudding (if there is any). definitely making this again!"
"0","3","Tastes really good. Giving 3 stars because the cake was kinda crumbly and hard to get out of the cake pans."
"0","4","This was a really good basic chocolate cake. It was light and fluffy. Tasted kind of bland to me. I prefer a denser, fudgier cake. This was good, just not quite what I was looking for."
"0","5","This was a delicious, moist cake. Even better than cake mix cakes. Did not change a single thing in the recipe. I will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","Moist beyond all earthly means. Just plain delicious. Never will I bake cakes out of a box again!"
"0","5","Easy, tasty, and yummy. The batter is thin, but trust the recipe. I frosted it with chocolate buttercream for my hubby's bday and everyone loved it."
"0","5","So so so good! I used the Chocolate Buttercream frosting to frost this cake and it turned out simply delicious! First cake I have made in quite a while that the whole cake disappeared in 2 days! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","This was awesome and soooo easy. I just cooked it for my assited living facitly Christmas feast and it was the best part of their dinner. Thanks"
"0","5","Great! Nice easy recipe made with ingredients I always have on hand. Forget running to the store for last minute cakes."
"0","3","I wasn't a big fan of this cake. It was quite dry and I didn't find that it had nearly enough chocolate."
"0","4","Super easy to make. Moist, dark and delicious with a few simple ingredients!"
"0","5","It's my go-to cake when I need one in a hurry. So easy and the kids love it. I serve it with 'Chocolate Frosting I'."
"0","5","Wow! Easy and yummy. Way better than a box cake and not that much longer to make. I made it in a bundt pan and it came out perfect. Will make again and again."
"0","5","I was looking for a cake to make for my sons bday so I made this as cupcakes for a trial run. They turned out so moist and yummy. I even used whole wheat pastry flour because we don't use white and it still was delicious, light, and fluffy. Goes great with Rich chocolate frosting also from this website."
"0","5","I was very impressed with this cake - it was so moist and delicious! I made this for a birthday party and frosted it with Chocolate Mousse Cake IV frosting and everyone loved it."
"0","5","This was a fantastic easy basic chocolate cake and is a great foil for whatever frosting you want on it. Loved it and will now be my go to cake. Did follow recommendation of other reviewer and increased cocoa to 1 cup total and was perfect amount of chocolate taste. Thanks for this great recipe."
"0","5","This cake is really moist, not too chocolatey rich and fantastic with a simple bittersweet chocolate/sour cream frosting- YUM!"
"0","5","this is sooo good!!!! I made it for part of my exam!!...haven't gotten the marks back yet though. Everyone loves it!!!!"
"0","1","This recipe doesn't work! Maybe I used the wrong type of things, but it's not that great. There should be more flour!"
"0","5","This cake was fantastic! I was a little worried when I was making it but once it was done cooking my husband dove right in. This is the cake I'll be making from now on! Thanks!"
"0","5","I thought this cake was excellent. Very easy to make and very moist. It is almost exactly the same as the classic hershey chocolate cake recipe."
"0","5","Just wonderful!"
"0","4","I had all the ingredients for this cake in my kitchen - the receipe is nice and simple. I divided the amounts in half to make a single layer and ate it without any icing. Even cooked for 35 minutes it was slightly underdone. This is a very rich cake - I can see why the receipe is supposed to serve 24 - a very small slice is sufficent! It is something you would want to eat as a special treat. Congratulations on concocting such a succulent cake receipe from such simple ingredients!"
"0","5","WOW! Amazing. The only thing with this recipe I didnt understand was the added boiling water. The batter looked reeeeally watery, so I just used 3/4 cup instead of the whole cup. It turned out amazing! Good job. I will be using this recipe again!"
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic. Moist, delicious, and wonderful. I made this for my family as cupcakes and decorated them with my young cousins. We had a blast and the cakes were a hit with everyone."
"0","5","This was amazing. This was the first time I made a cake from scratch. It was so easy and a hit! People came back for seconds and thirds. I should have made another cake :-) I will definetly make this again"
"0","5","I made this for my roommate's birthday, and he said it was as good as his mom's homemade cake! This is a great compliment as I have never made a cake from scratch before. I used canned cream cheese frosting. Delicious."
"0","5","Yum. I added chopped pecans and baked in a loaf pan. Then drizzled with honey before eating."
"0","5","I think this is very much like the recepie on the hershey cocoa box. I make this recipe for cupcakes and birthday cakes all the time. It always turns out to be moist and delicious and gets rave reviews. It works to make a moist bundt cake or as the base for Death by Chocolate."
"0","3","Apart from just putting 3/4 of the amount of sugar stated in the recipe, I followed everything else to the letter. The cake looked great. Dark brown and moist. But the taste wasn't gud at all. I juat didn't like it. I always use the same cocoa on another chocolate recipe and it tastes great. But this cakes beautiful look, it wasn't delicious at all"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous cake!! Very moist, perfect texture, and amazing chocolate taste. Followed recipe strictly, and results were perfect. Make sure to grease and flour pans well to prevent sticking. Better than anything you could buy."
"0","5","THIS CAKE WAS SO MOIST AND HAD A VERY GOOD FLAVOR. I BELIEVE I FORGOT THE WATER. MY SON WAS 'HELPING' ME AT THE TIME. IT SUNK IN THE MIDDLE (I AM SURE BECAUSE I LEFT THE WATER OUT WHICH WOULD MAKE IT MORE DENSE). WILL TRY AGAIN SOON."
"0","5","Perfect cake. Hersey's Cocoa agrees it's on the back of the label."
"0","5","I am always on the hunt for a really great, moist chocolate cake and I have now found it. This cake is so good and so simple. I recommend that everyone make this cake. Thanks for the recipe!! Josie"
"0","5","This is a great recipe. I've been using it for years. It is the 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake by Hersheys. It's been on the cocoa box for many many years. (So it's ironic that one review mentions using a better cocoa than Hersheys). Hersheys also provides a great chocolate icing that goes with it. (Note: a great variation on this recipe is to use dark cocoa for a very rich dark chocolate cake)"
"0","5","Very good cake- easy to make- the whole family liked it! I made it with half splenda/half sugar, baked in a 9 x 13 pan, and served unfrosted with whipped cream. Delicious! Thanks!"
"0","5","Delicious! It was gone within a day. I didn't change a thing."
"0","5","This was really good. Mine sunk in the middle though. I am thinking that I need to make mine with High Altitude measurements. Other than that, it turns out just like a store bought mix and is YUMMY!! Thanks for the new recipe!!!"
"0","5","This is a delicious recipe. I made it yesterday and by night it was over. My family just loved it. I plan to make it again this weekend for potluck.  Just a note: just to avoid the cake sticking to the bottom of the pan I lined it with butter paper and the cake just sild out of the pan when I turned it."
"0","5","YUM! Even my mother-in-law asked for the recipe. I made this for my husband's birthday and it turned out lovely and moist, baked 50 minutes in a large round tin - definitely a keeper! (By the way, this is a BIG cake, 10 decent slices is only half the cake - have encouraged my husband to take the rest to his office to stop me eating it)"
"0","5","This is the best chocolate cake I ever made. I made it for a family friend's birthday and the mother asked me which kind of bix I used - she was floored it was from scratch. I made my own ganache with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream and a little icing sugar and served it warm on the cake. People were fighting for the last piece, it was devoured in 5 minutes!  The only problem I had was that it suck to the pan (bundt pan) and didn't come out perfectly...maybe 20 mins cooling wasn't long enough.  I'm making it again for more company tomorrow night, lets see if I can stay out of it that long!"
"0","4","wasn't quite fudgy enough for meeee! i think there was probably too much water but all in all it was good and simple to make!"
"0","5","Simple and delicious!"
"0","5","Wow! This cake was incredibly simple to prepare and so moist. Delicious cake that I will be making for all future birthdays! I used the frosting recipe on the back of the cocoa container, as suggested by another reviewer-that was great, too."
"0","4","This was a good cake. It was really rich, which I liked. But it was kind of spongey. I am not sure how to combat that. But it was good."
"0","5","Oh My! I've used recipes from this site for 4 years, and have never felt moved enough to review any!! This cake was the best chocolate cake I've ever made, BY FAR! Very moist, very flavorful, regardless of the brand of cocoa. I used the 'fluffy peanut butter frosting', from this site, and it was such a compliment to a delicious cake."
"0","5","Very moist indeed! Even my girlfriends who were on diet can't resist it."
"0","5","Great cake! I followed the recipe as given and it's a really great cake. Less mess, Great Cake!"
"0","3","Lovely texture, and moist cake however it did feel like it was lacking in flavour."
"0","5","I have already made this cake twice after just finding it about two weeks ago. Nice and easy, very, very moist. I did it in a bundt pan and just put a little powdered sugar on top."
"0","5","This cake was wonderful. I actually started off wanting a raspberry filled cake. So I used this cake recipe, along with the frosting and raspberry filling recipes for 'Deep Chocolate Raspberry Cake'. The combination of the two made for a wonderful birthday cake!"
"0","5","This cake was wonderful, moist and very rich. I will make it again."
"0","5","I made this for my son's birthday and it was a hit. This truly was sinfully delish!"
"0","5","Followed directions exactly -- was amazing. New family favorite!"
"0","5","Happy to be the 100th reviewer on this FABULOUS cake !! It couldn't be easier to make, and I made a fudge frosting and the combination was divine. Thanks for this awesome recipe, Shirley, my Thanksgiving guests were in heaven!  Just one thing..the recipe says it yields 24 servings. I would like to propose that the cake is so good that the real estimation, at least in my house, was about 8 servings, lol."
"0","3","This is the exact same recipe on the back of millions of Hershey's Cocoa cans. It's called 'Perfectly Chocolate' chocolate cake. It is a wonderful tasting cake though..."
"0","5","moist, fluffy, unbelievable. best chocolate ever."
"0","5","This is it--the perfect recipe for chocolate cake. My teenaged son actually embraced baking after tasting this cake and has made it numerous times. We like it best with vanilla frosting, for contrast, but I imagine that any flavor of frosting--or even no frosting--would work equally well. Enjoy!"
"0","5","it is r-e-a-l-l-y easy, quick & delicious! my friends loved it! light & moist! congrats!"
"0","5","This was incredible!!I made it for my son's birthday and the whole family wanted me to make this for there children's birthday's. I think that the 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate frosting that is on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can is also what made this cake a hit. The frosting taste's like fudge."
"0","5","great cake...very moist! will make again and again."
"0","5","so easy to make and so good. will definately make this again."
"0","4","I REALLY like the simplicity of this recipe thats why i tried it. I substituted coffee for the boiled water and used buttermilk instead of milk. It turned out moist and delicious. Even without the frosting this cake would stand on its own!!!"
"0","5","There is only one word to describe this cake: extraordinary."
"0","4","This recipe was incredibly easy to whip up! The batter was so thin that I wasn't sure it would turn out right, but it popped out of the pans wonderfully. Everyone who had a piece loved it."
"0","5","This was EXCELLENT! So easy to make and perfectly moist and delicious."
"0","5","This is simple amazing!!! It truly does only take one bowl. My cakes both rose wonderfully, and layer on top, with cream cheese frosting!!!! Yum. Great w/ strawberries!"
"0","5","This is an excellent cake recipe. I didn't have enough cocoa on hand, so I melted 2 2oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate and added it to my 1/4 cup of cocoa. Turned out perfect. I won't be using a box mix anymore!!"
"0","5","Made this with a Turtle Filling from another recipe....WOW....yum. I made a filling with evaporated milk 5oz - about 30 caramels and chocolate chips melted and put in a middle layer. YUMMY!!!!"
"0","5","One word WONDERFUL! I frosted this cake with Cream Cheese frosting II from this site and it was a dream! I will make this cake again and again!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Very moist, but kind of sticky. Cream cheese frosting was an excellent addition."
"0","5","this was a really good chocolate cake. the consistency was on the denser side which i liked. it almost tasted like a red velvet cake. the cake was so easy to prepare. i chose to frost the cake with the fluffy peanut butter frosting off this site and topped with crushed peanut butter cups. it was tasty!!!"
"0","5","If you love chocolate you will love this cake. I myself am not a chocolate lover but my kids loved this. This taste a lot like dark chocolate. But this bakes beautifully."
"0","5","I'm a new fan of chocolate cake now. Try it and you won't be disappointed. Didn't change a thing."
"0","4","I found this cake it awfully sticky. If I made it again I would dust the pans with powdered sugar instead of flour so that I can be more liberal."
"0","5","I am no chef by far, but this was an easy to make cake. I took it to my mom's birthday party, and hearing horror stories about me in the kitchen, several relatives were hesistant to eat it. However, once they started, I didn't think they would stop. Several people went back for seconds and everyone gave it rave reviews. Coincidentally, it was the same recipe that was on the back of my Hersehey's Cocoa powder container."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious, but not a good cake batter for cupcakes. I had to clean up the edges, but the taste was unbelievable!"
"0","5","Perfect! It was moist and delicious!"
"0","5","Very good, moist, and easy cake. I made this as one of the cakes for my 2 son's combined birthday party. This one was a hit! Was gone long before the yellow cake. Thanks!"
"0","5","My mom has a recipe that is almost exactly the same only it calls for half a teaspoon less of both baking soda and baking powder. It also has a cup of strong coffee instead of boiling water. This cake always turns out perfect and it tastes so good!!!! Very easy!"
"0","3","I followed the recipe exactly. For some reason the middle did not cook. I had to increase the baking time to an hour, but the middle was still uncooked! Tasted good though."
"0","5","rich, simple, quick and moist, love it! makes great cupcakes"
"0","5","Wow...this is such a good recipe!! Super easy & turned out perfect. It doesn't even really need frosting. :)"
