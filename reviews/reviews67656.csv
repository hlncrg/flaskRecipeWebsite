"5826","4","#1) Bake cake as directed. #2) Let the cake COOL for at least a half hour! Don't mix in the frosting while HOT! You will get a gooey, albeit yummy, mess!  #3) I used a handmixer to mix the cake and frosting. I used a dark chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting.  #4) Put this mixture in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 3 hours but I did it overnight and it was perfect.  #5) Using your hands, roll the balls bite size. I used a foil covered cookie sheet because I was out of wax paper. Wax paper is preferred. #6) Stick the balls in the freezer for an hour. #7) Melt up whatever chocolate you prefer (i buy my chocolate at a mennonite bulk foods store as I can't stand that melting bark stuff they sell at the grocery, yuck!!) 8) Using a toothpick, pick up the balls and dip in the chocolate. Using a second toothpick in the other hand help the ball slid off the toothpick. NOTE:If your balls fall off the toothpick into the chocolate they are not frozen enough.  9) Place in refrigerator to set. 10) Enjoy, these are SUPERB!!!!!!!!"

"1825","5","I have been making this item for about 1.5 years and am doing them for Christmas this year. I find it easier to dip if the prepared balls are refrigerated for about an hour, and dip them using an old Easter egg dye dipper instead of toothpicks (it wastes less chocolate and there is no fighting to get it off the toothpick).  I am making smaller balls (half of the mellon baller) and made 26 dozen from 3 cakes. One batch is with a white cake mix and mint chocolate chip icing and the other with a french vanilla cake with white chocolate almond icing; both dipped in chocolate confectioners coating.  My all time favorite though is red velvet with cream cheese icing and vanilla confectioners coating."
"905","5","These are so delicious! I used German chocolate cake mix and pecan coconut frosting and dipped them in chocolate almond bark. I crumbled the cake right after it came out of the oven, so it was still quite hot, but I believe that is one of the things that make it really stick together. Also make sure you crumble it into tiny crumbs. Whenever I ran into a big chunk the ball refused to form and would only crumble. I then froze the balls solid before dipping. I melted the bark in a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup, dropped one ball in at a time, lifted it out on a fork, and scraped it back onto the cold cookie sheet with another fork. They came out beautiful and by placing back on the cold cookie sheet, the chocolate hardened in about 15 seconds. I can't wait to share this recipe with all my family!"
"829","5","These things looked freaking awesome!!!! Mine also took an entire package of chocolate bark. I used milk chocolate cake, milk chocolate icing and the chocolate bark. It was divine. I had no problem with them holding together and I used my Pampered Chef scoop to make my balls uniform in size. I also used my egg seperator to dip them, it worked like a charm and the excess chocolate dripped right through. Betty Crocker makes a product called drizzlers, they are in a microwaveable pouch and come with a tip attached. I bought one of these in the white icing and after the chocolate dip dried, I drizzled the white all over and they were beautiful! I had little foil papers to put them in when they dried and they looked like they could have been made professionally! Well worth the time and effort!"
"693","4","This recipe just couldn't be easier. I read all the reviews and followed others' advice.   1) Trim off the edges of the cake to make it easier to crumble.  2) Mix in the frosting when the cake is still warm. You may only need half a container of frosting. 3) Use a cookie scoop to round your balls. 4) Freeze the balls for at least 2 hrs so they're firm enough to handle (plus it makes the chocolate dipping that much easier). 5) Use a skewer for dipping and since the balls are frozen, the chocolate hardens pretty quickly.  I've made german chocolate and chocolate mint versions (just add peppermint extract to the frosting). It was a hit with all my coworkers. Definitely a keeper!"
"539","5","I made my cake last night. When i got home from church i cut the cake into about 2in pieces and put them all in my kitchen aid. I put the icing in the micorwave for 25 seconds, (just long enough to soften it and not make it runny) to make it easier to stir in. The cake was just the right for making balls. My five year old DD even helped me make balls. We got 54 balls out of our batch. I put them in the freezer for about an hour before diping them in the chocolate. When I melted I the choclate I only melted 3 squares of the almond bark at a time and i put about a tsp of shortening in it (very important). I put a tooth pick in the cake ball dipped it in chocolate and then I left the tooth pick in util it dried and then i went back and filled the whole with choclate. This recipe is definitly a keeper and I WILL be making it again. Next time I'm going to try it with strawbery cake and iceing.. YUM!"
"486","5","These were beautiful! I was a little hesitant to make them because of some of the bad reviews, but after adjusting some things, they came out wonderful! I used duncan hines devils food, and milk choc frosting. I baked the cake ALL the way, let cool completely, crumbled in a big mixing bowl, and added only 1/2 of the frosting! that makes it less of a mush, and more cake like. I mixed it with a fork, It will still look a little crumbly,but when you form balls they stick together. I rolled them, and refrigerated them for an hour. I melted a bag of semisweet choc chips with some shortening, and dipped the balls into it and set it to cool on a waxed paper surface. Let cool completely and drizzled with white chocolate! yummy! you have to try them, they are a little time consuming but worth every bite!"
"478","5","YUM YUM YUM! I used strawberry cake mix with white frosing then dipped in dark chocolate. They taste very much like chocolate covered strawberries! As others have stated, you must freeze these for at least one hour before trying to dip them. Also, another trick for making the balls is to keep your hands slightly moist. I found that by doing this, the mixture did not stick to my hands and forming the balls was much easier! I have been passing this recipe on to many people and plan to make these again soon."
"469","5","These are wonderful!! The combination I used was chocolate cake, chocolate icing and Andes candy bits. If you like Girl Scout Thin Mints you will love these. They taste exactly the same only moist instead of being crunchy like the cookies. I did refrigerator the cake / frosting mixture for a few hours before rolling the balls. I also used an egg separator tool to dip and drain the chocolate from them. This worked much easier for me then toothpicks or forks. I can't wait to try different flavors!!"
"217","5","First, Allison, thank you for the recipe - it's innovative & makes a great presentation. As a 4-star professional caterer, I'd like to remind other reviewers to be kinder when reviewing a recipe. The submitter is generous of heart to share with you, and they've obviously tried the recipe as it's printed, and it worked for them. Try to remember this.  Now, In my catering kitchen, we first test a recipe as is. Allison's concept is wonderful. (1) It took us 1.5 hours beginning to end to produce a beautiful, delicious product. (2) I softened the icing in the microwave and GENTLY FOLDED 1/2 of the container into the WARM coarsely crumbled cake, for an excellent texture. I put the other half of the icing in the fridge for other uses. For those who used an electric mixer, you broke down the texture to mush. If you fold this properly as Allison intended, you will see small bits of cake. These bits will eventually absorb moisture as the finished product sits.  (3) We melted & tried a small amount of bark, but decided we preferred the taste of a dense ganache. The choice of outer coating is a matter of personal taste, but Allison's choice is not to be belittled. She likes it. That's what counts. (4) I agree a pampered chef style egg separator is essential to the success. It worked perfectly to dip each ball and shake to remove excess. We dipped the separator now and then in warm water to eliminate buildup. These were delicious! Thanks, Allison!"
"179","5","As a fan of this recipe, I feel that I have to address two common complaints. 1) The texture. You can't think of this as a ball of cake, because that's not the end result you get. Think of it as a kind of truffle, or just a candy confection. My MIL had them and didn't even know they were cake at all - that's how different from cake the texture becomes. She thought they were some sort of crazy lime truffles, and loved them. (Lime cake w/ lime cream cheese frosting dipped in milk chocolate). So, don't expect little bites of cake in ball form. Expect creamy bites of confectionary deliciousness.... which brings me to the second common complaint. 2) The taste. If you use a boxed cake mix and canned frosting, how can you possibly complain that’s all they taste like? I thought everyone knew that any recipe is only as good as the ingredients you put into it. I have never made this with a canned frosting, I always use homemade, and the cake is usually from scratch as well (or a doctored up box mix). The results are phenomenal. Making everything from scratch becomes a different recipe altogether, I know, but really - this is one of those recipes that's more for the idea than the recipe itself. And it is marvelous. Some tips – add the frosting in small amounts until the desired taste and texture is reached, and definitely refrigerate or freeze the balls before dipping. Sorry for the length. ;)"
"93","5","I made these cake balls in 5 different flavors within an hour.   The trick is, buy pre-made CUPCAKES from your favorite local cupcake place!   I live Manhattan, so I bought mine from Buttercup Bake Shop. I got 5 invidivual cupcakes in 5 different flavors including their famous red velvet, chocolate and lemon ones! I smash each cupcake up in 5 separate bowls - feel free to eliminate some cupcake frosting if you think cupcake has too much frosting)  Guess what? This does not only saves you precious time to bake your own chocolate cake and make frosting (since cupcakes come with frosting already on top), it gives you ample variety!"
"76","5","Ok,this is the only review you need to read.I have the tips to solve all the problems. Make your cake in 2 round cake pans, take them out of pans,put on wax paper for 30 mins.Crumble COMPLETELY in bowl & add a dollop of frosting at a time.Mix well after each dollop until you can roll a ball around in your hand like making meatballs.Don't be a ninny and add the whole container, you'll be sorry you did.If frosting is added a bit at a time, you will have the chance to stop at a good rolling consistency that will stick together and you wont need all that 'put in the fridge or freezer before you coat them with chocolate' nonsense.Use regular choc morsels,melt them in the microwave under watchful eye at about 50% power,checking & stirring every 10-15 secs or so.Solve the toothpick or fork dilemma by simply putting them in a round foil cake pan 1 in. apart & coaxing the chocolate over the top and down the sides with a spoon. Stick in the freezer for 30 mins to set and you have a disgustingly orgasmic dessert that will make others draw back a nub if they try and touch one while in your hands. My FAV-Dark Chocolate Fudge cake w/milk chocolate frosting and half/half milk chocolate morsels & Andes mint chocolate pieces for the coating. I also pushed a maraschino cherry coated in white chocolate glaze into the middle of the balls, & stuck a sliver of Dove dark chocolate into the top before coating. I am sitting here now with chocolate all over my lips with a nasty Cheshire cat grin!! ;)"
"59","5","These have been renamed 'Death By Chocolate Balls' in this house! Since I can't abide the relentlessly artificial flavor of cake mixes and canned frosting, I made my own chocolate buttermilk cake and chocolate satin frosting. It added greatly to the prep time, but judging from the response of those sampling, well worth the extra steps. This is a pain-in-the-butt recipe to make, but once done, they taste like the finest truffle. The 5 stars is for the result and not the prep. As others have noted, this is NOT a fast and easy treat. Used a combination of Lindt and Ghirardelli chocolate, half milk and half dark, to coat. Another combo that's divine is carrot cake/cream cheese frosting/white chocolate. Also white cake, raspberry jam heated to melt and mixed with a little marshmallow fluff and dark chocolate to coat. Remember when tempted to use easy stuff that the end result is only going to be as good as the ingredients you use, and choose accordingly. Watch out particularly for almond bark - ersatz taste. Why bother with this time consuming recipe if you're only going to use nasty stuff? I've actually been asked if I would be willing to sell them. Yes, they're that good! Edited to add: Just made with cherry cake (yellow cake mix with 1/3 cup oil, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup water and can of cherry pie filling plus 1/2 tsp almond extract all blended well before baking,) homemade vanilla buttercream, coated with dark chocolate. Voila! Cherry Cordial Cake Balls."
"49","5","I've made many, many batches of these over the years for weddings, showers, Christmas, etc. Yes, it's time consuming, but here are my tips to make it as painless as possible:  * After you cook the cake, cool it completely in the fridge before you break it up, then mix in the frosting when it's cold. It doesn't get as gooey and messy this way. * When rolling the balls, lightly spray your hands with cooking spray. It will still build up and you'll have to wash your hands several times during the rolling, but it helps a lot. * Put the rolled balls on paper plates, about a dozen per plate. Stick a toothpick in the center of each ball and freeze completely before rolling. Take the plates out one at a time to dip. They defrost really quick and if they sit out it makes a mess in your chocolate. Dip the balls, wait a minute or two, and when the dipping chocolate has set, pull the toothpick out. It will leave a tiny little hole, very easy to cover. Pull it straight up or it will break off inside. * I have made these as much as a month ahead of time and frozen them and they were awesome. You would never know they had been frozen. Good luck!"
"49","2","I made mine look like mini cupcakes (melted chocolate in the bottom of the mold, the ball on top, then dip in chocolate after it sets). They looked really cute but were time consuming, and as others have stated, the texture of the cake is just such a turnoff. It feels like it's been pre-chewed or something. If someone can come up with a better cake recipe for the inside, I'd love to try it again. I did not have any trouble making them into little balls - I used a mini ice cream scoop and rolled them to uniform sizes. **UPDATE** - I made these again for the 4th of July and only used about 2/3 of a can of the frosting. Wow, what a difference. The cake still held together and was moist and dense but not gummy. It was not messy to work with and some people even thought it was fudge on the inside. I would say with this simple alteration, it's now a 4 star recipe!"
"47","4","This is similar to a recipe cake decorators use, to use leftover cake scraps (left from cutting cakes into shapes/sizes, or the scraps from cutting the cake tops off so the cake is level). Instead of frosting, we mix the cake crumbs (any flavor cake) with flavored liquid coffee creamer (again, any flavor.) You can mix and match various creamer and cake flavors to make custom cake bon-bons. Just add enough of the creamer to the cake crumbs to make a paste; shape into balls and chill. When firm, dip in melted chocolate."
"43","4","These are a great recipe. Everyone needs to know about an old way of 'chocolate dipping' and I really believe you'll like this method much better than almond bark or using shortening. Use white chocolate, milk chocolate, or semi-sweet chocolate chips, melt in a double boiler with a half stick of Gulf wax. This is also known as paraffin wax and is found in any baking aisle. It hardens with the chocolate to create a shell, tastes awesome, and is completely digestable. I learned about it from my MIL for any dipping recipes (including strawberries). Hope this helps someone!"
"37","4","These do take a while to make but most of that time is cooling time. I made red velvet cake with homemade cream cheese icing (from this site) with a splash of disaronno liqueur with a dark chocolate coating. Some tips that should have been included in the instructions: 1. Let the cake cook but while it is still warm, crumble and add the icing (which should be a little cold). This allows for the icing not to melt too much but still act as a binding agent so the mixture isn't too mushy.  2. Refrigerate the mixture for 2-3 hours or overnight before forming into balls. This makes things less sticky and the balls hold their shape. U can use a tablespoon measuring spoon to do this instead of a melon baller.  3. Freeze the balls overnight. This really helps when dipping into the chocolate 4. Melt the chocolate with a little bit of butter. This helps the creaminess of the chocolate and makes even hersheys taste way better. You can also add a little vanilla or some extract to this step to give it a different flavor.  - also, melt enough so its creamy but not too hot as it starts to smell. Melt in 10 second increments - 10 seconds, stir, 10 seconds more, stir, etc. 5. Use a knife and fork. the fork to roll and the knife to lift out of the chocolate and onto the wax paper."
"31","5","I've been making this recipe for quite a while now. Its a great 'Wow factor' dessert thats for sure! I make them into 'cake pops' by inserting lollipop sticks into the bottoms before dipping them in the coating. I wrapped them individually with a clear plastic baggie and tied them at the bottom with different colored ribbons and gave them as Thank You treats and favors. I also used a Styrofoam circle mold and used toothpicks to insert them into the mold to make a sweet little topiary. Great center pieces for the party! I added 1C semi-sweet chocolate chunks to the Devil's Food cake I baked and milk chocolate frosting and a chocolate coating. It was sinful! I can't wait to try German Chocolate! I bet mocha or java inspired cake balls would be out of this world! Especially for work! **Update** I added 1 1/2 C chocolate rice crispies into the mixture with the frosting and cake and this gave it what it was missing-just a little bit of crunch! SO Yummy and I got tons of raves!"
"27","5","Wow these were amazing! I followed the tip to freeze the balls before dipping them and it made them MUCH easier to handle. The main issue I had was the sheer volume that one recipe made. I made them bite sized (a tiny bit bigger than a mini muffin cup) and one recipe made over 9 dozen! My family didn't object, but my waistline sure did! I made the following variations: Lemon cake with vanilla frosting, Strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting, Butter cake with rainbow chip frosting, chocolate cake with chocolate/ creme de menthe frosting, and chocolate cake with marshmallow cream and almonds."
"26","5","I read the reviews first & from those reviews, I did the following: made cake(s) and cooled completely; used my KITCHEN AID stand mixer with large paddle. Broke up cake into 2' pieces. Place 1/2 cake pieces in mixer, added some frosting & 'stirred'...added the rest of cake pieces, more frosting & 'stirred'. I only used a little more than 1/2 can frosting (following others reviews). Dumped mix into tupperware bowl, covered, and refrigerated overnight. Next day, I used my small-size cookie scooper to get uniform size balls. Scooped about 10 at time then took each scoop and rolled them into balls (wasn't even messy!). Placed those balls on cookie sheet and put in freezer for 1/2 hour before dipping into chocolates. I could not imagine using hands to mix in frosting or to roll into balls before refrigeratored. This method was SO easy and not messy at all :) I made devils food/choc frosting & yellow cake/caramel frosting. Dipped in white chocolate (the 'real' thing at Trader Joes and Nestle semi-sweet chocolate) Used a small amount of parrafin wax in each chocolate to get the right consistency...and nice gloss shine!"
"23","4","Normally, I love the convenience of boxed cake mixes & canned frosting. But for cake balls, I've found that using homemade cake & homemade frosting makes for a firmer, more cake-like texture that I prefer. Also, since I find the cake sweet enough on it's own, I usually substitute heavy cream, applesauce, canned pumpkin, coffee, chocolate syrup, or liqueur for the frosting. All it takes is just enough liquid/wet ingredient(s) to adequately moisten the cake so it will hold it's ball shape; otherwise, it ends up with that typical cake ball consistency that is very much (I'm sorry to say) like eating pre-chewed cake & frosting. I've even used raspberry jam (with white cake, along with a bit of heavy cream) with great success. Frankly, the sky's the limit! :-)"
"23","5","I went back and forth about trying these. Some reviews were thumbs up and some thumbs down. But, since it was only 3 ingredients, why not. My family is glad I made them. I followed a lot of the suggestions of other reviewers. After I baked the cake (Red Velvet), I let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then I used a fork to run through the cake and break it up into crumbs. I then transferred the crumbs to a bowl and added the can of frosting (cream cheese). It made a gooey mix. I then made the cake balls with my Pampered Chef large scoop and put them in the freezer for about an hour. I used Candiquik - chocolate candy coating (16 oz.), found at Walmart. You need it all, not just 3 oz. I found that the chocolate set real fast, maybe because the balls are cold. So if you are using sprinkles, have them ready. My family has requested them again, so I'll be making some more soon. Thanks for the recipe! Kids especially love them!"
"21","5","So these are amazing! Yes they are time-consuming (I personally find rolling the balls the most labor intensive, but I feel that way about those cute meatballs in Holiday Wedding Soup too ;) I agree that boxed mixes make boxed cakes....why not just take your favorite cake recipe, a simple icing recipe and make them from scratch??? Muchhhhhh better! I made the cake/icing mix after cooling the cake 30 min as directed, my icing was a bit thinner than canned so it was easy to add in as needed. I froze the 80 truffle balls overnite on the wax paper lined baking sheets. They were perfect for coating in the chocolate! I did Red Velvet Cake Truffles with Cream cheese icing,dipped in melted Wilton chocolates....white, dark, and milk chocolate. I put 3T of melted chocolate (each variety in separate baggies) drizzled the truffles, and put in mini foil cupcake liners for a party They are beautiful! One cake recipe yielded 80 truffles...so next time I'll 1/2 my recipe!"
"21","5","This is hit wherever I take it! However, it's not as hard as some of the reviews make it out to be. Here are MY tips: 1) let the cake cool 10-15 min & then crumble it into a bowl. 2)mix in the tub of frosting. The mixture will be very gooey. 3)put the mixture in the freezer for 15-30 min. 4)begin making the balls-I just scoop out a little bit of dough and form balls by rolling them in my hand. 5)place them on wax paper on a cookie tray and place back in the freezer for 15 min. 6)I melt the bark or candy coating only 4 blocks at a time. This way it doesn't harder before you are done dipping. 7)place dipped ball back onto wax paper to set. 8)if you want to decorate the tops w/sprinkles, etc. you must do this after each individual ball is dipped because the coating hardens quickly. 9)I just use a small spoon to drop the ball into the melted coating and then scoop it out, letting as much excess coating drip back into bowl. 10)When making lemon cake balls, I added yellow food coloring to the white chocolate candy coating to make them look more like 'lemons'."
"20","5","Rock on! Time-comsuming, but great if you are willing to put in the effort! Do you plan on making a lot for a party or something? Take your time - bake your cakes one night. Allow them to cool before adding the frosting. Add a little at a time until you reach the consistency you want (more cakey vs. mushy). Roll by hand - I found I preferred 2 tablespoons worth of mix per ball. Freeze overnight. The next day, do your dipping. Double boiler melting, the right dipper (plastic fork, middle tine broken), and patience will lead to beautiful treats. I rolled the ball in the candy melts or chocolate, lifted with a spoon, then took it off of the spoon using the dipper. Placed onto wax paper and slid the dipper straight out from beneath it.   My favorites were (cake-icing-coating): Strawberry-Strawberry-Dark Chocolate Butter yellow-Almond Butter-Chocolate Lemon-Lemon-Lemon (this was tough as the lemon extract made the vanilla wafers seize, but some shortening fixed the problem!) Devils Food-Nutella-Chocolate German Chocolate-Coconut Pecan-Chocolate Orange-Cream Cheese-Chocolate  The possibilities are endless!"
"18","5","Delicious treats! Check out this site for great cake ball ideas: www.DeWishesdDelights.com"
"18","4","these are really tasty and pretty easy to create. they are time consuming to make though so it helps to bake the cake the night before and let it cool overnight. these little cake balls (or pops if you use lollipop sticks) are the creation of a woman who goes by the name bakerella (bakerella.com) and are great for baby showers and office parties. the original recipe calls for red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting, and in my opinion is also the tastiest although you can use any type of cake mix and frosting you like. when decorating its also the easiest to buy candy melts and melt them in little sandwich ziplock bags (leave the bag open in microwave) and then once melted just snip off one corner and you have yourself a very easy to use (and disposable) pastry bag. when you first dip the ball in chocolate it also helps to try to get off as much excess frosting as possible bc these little things can be very sweet. also recommend refrigerating balls before coating in chocolate. helps them hold up better! yum"
"17","4","This is a pain in the o O (butt) recipe, but the results are incredibly addictive. After trying 3 times because I wanted it to work sooo bad, I finally figured it out (for me anyways). While cake is warm, crumble in a bowl and microwave a can of the WHIPPED frosting for about 15 - 20 secs... you want it a tiny bit warm so it is a easier to blend with the cake. Because it is whipped, there isnt as much frosting in the can and because of the air in the frosting it doesnt become the slimy affair a lot of people talked about when combined with the cake. It is like a super dense cake on the inside. Form into balls and FREEZE!! This helped 150% because then the cake didnt fall apart when dipping. When melting the chocolate, add veggie shortening and not liquids. I had a huge problem with the chocolate turning into a non melting mess when add liquid. No milk, no water, no oil. Take half of the batch out of the freezer and use CORN COB POKERS to dip the balls(the ones you stab on the ends of sweet corn so you dont get butter all over your hands). The two prongs helped stablize the balls when upside down. Hold upside down until chocolate stops dripping. I used the holes in a broiling pan to hold the pokers upright until the chocolate hardened. Drizzle white bakers chocolate on top a"
"16","5","DELICIOUS! BIGGEST HIT AT ANY PARTY!!  My favorite combo is funfetti cake, vanilla icing and white chocolate.  I do it like this and it comes out perfect:  1. bake cake 2. let cake cool for 1hr 3. mix in frosting 4. cover & put in fridge for 3hrs/overnight 5. roll mixture into balls 6. stick in freezer for 1hr 7. cover w/chocolate 8. put in fridge to set  You can also put a stick in it and it becomes a cake pop! :-)"
"16","4","This is a great idea. I've made them twice but I don't use a cake mix. The first time I used a cinnamon toast cake then mixed in a maple butter cream frosting and dunked them in vanilla almond bark. The second time I made a Guinness chocolate cake mixed in baileys irishcream frosting then dunked them in a whiskey ganache before dunking them in dark chocolate. I've found that after forming them it's essential to freeze them for an hour or they are just all gooshy. I will probably make these over and over again since making up new combinations is so much fun."
"16","5","ok...i'm really irritated. I bake cookies all the time...i make sooo many really good italian, polish, german, scandanavian, greek specialty cookies...the list goes on and on...recipes that have been handed down thru generations...and what does my family absolutely flip over??? CAKE BALLS!! They went nuts..i made the strawberry cheesecake version that some other reviewers mentioned...and my family adored them...go figure."
"15","5","Turned out awesome, we ruined the white chocolate the 1st time we tried it, but I think we got it now. Used styrofoam with toothpicks to let the balls cool whilst retaining shape."
"15","5","These turned out great! I was worried they would be tedious and time consuming (and they were), but they were worth it. It just takes some practice. I made them for my niece's 2nd birthday party. I used strawberry cake and strawberry frosting, which was perfect for a little girl's party. I dipped half in vanilla almond bark and half in semi-sweet chocolate. I tried the toothpick method, but it didn't work very well for me. I found what worked best was placing the ball in the melted chocolate, using a spoon to cover the ball with the chocolate, then lifting it up with a fork, and scraping the excess chocolate off the bottom with a spoon. I then used the spoon to push the ball onto waxed paper and to smooth out the chocolate if needed. To make the pink drizzle, I simply melted vanilla almond bark, added red food color and squeezed from a baggie with the corner snipped off. They came out beautiful and I'm looking forward to trying different flavor combinations."
"15","5","I made these last year and I can`t believe I hadn`t rated them. Wow is an understatement. I used devils food cake mix and betty crocker chocolate frosting. I garnished by sprinkling a melted chocolate bar. I refrigerated overnight and served as ^truffles^ after a semi formal dinner. They looked so elegant and tasted great. Everyone thought they were from some gourmet store. Thanks for the recipe!"
"15","5","Cake Balls are fun and easy (although a little time consuming) to make! The reason they are time consuming is because a box of cake mix makes about 60 cake balls. If you don't have time and don't need 60 cake balls, you can bake the cake, cut it in half and only use half to make cake balls. The other half will keep well in the refrigerator in a big zip lock bag for a couple days. But I say, if you have the time, make all 60 and share with friends. Believe me, everyone loves cake balls. My favorite combo is devils food cake with pecans and chocolate frosting inside with ghiradelli 70% dark chocolate and coconut flakes on top. A very close second is spice cake with cream cheese frosting inside with ghiradelli white chocolate and walnuts on top. I use 1/2 a can of frosting instead of a whole can and I cut the dipping chocolate with shortening so that it coats the cake balls better and isn't too thick. Serve them in mini cupcake liners, they look totally professional."
"14","5","These are delicious and I can't wait to give them as gifts. They are, however, time consuming and a bit tedious to make. I just finished making a ton of them, and I have some helpful tips: Let the cake cool completely and cut off any hard or dark edges before crumbling. Crumble the cake as fine as you can before adding frosting - using your hands works best. I found I needed the entire can of frosting to make them moist enough. Mix cake and frosting very well. Chill cake & frosting mixture overnight. When rolling balls, wet your hands - it will help the balls stick together and will keep the cake from sticking to your hands as badly. Don't make the balls too big! Insert a toothpick into each ball, place on a cookie sheet, and freeze for 30-60 minutes. When dipping (this is KEY!) dip as much of the top part of the ball as possible and don't worry about getting coating all the way to the bottom around the toothpick. Stick the toothpick into wax paper covered styrofoam (I used the packing from an old stereo), add sprinkles, and let the coating set up. Then take the ball off the toothpick and dip the bottom in coating to cover and place on wax paper lined cookie sheets. If the ball slid down the toothpick, just touch up the hole in the top with some coating dipped in a toothpick. I used Wilton candy coating, and I managed to cover about 42 balls per bag. The recipe made WAY more balls than that though, so plan accordingly."
"14","5","I made this for a bake sale to help raise funds for a worthy cause. These were the hit of the sale!!! I now have friends who have requested these for their birthday presents :) Thank you so much for sharing...you've made lots of people very happy!"
"14","4","My girls liked making these. They were still pretty soft, even after being in the freezer for 4 days, to dip. We shaped like a ghost and dipped in white chocolate and used mini choc chips for eyes."
"14","5","We made 'pop' versions by inserting a lollipop stick in the cake balls (the fabulous Bakerella's idea). My 5 year old daughter decorated them while I held the pop steady. Work quickly if you want sprinkles or candy to stick, the chocolate dries about a minute after dipping. Dip the tip of the stick into a little melted chocolate right before inserting. We used dark chocolate cake with whipped milk chocolate frosting. As many have noted, you can use a little less frosting with good results. The secret is forming the balls and refrigerating them way ahead. I kept them in the fridge after the sticks were in place, taking them out one at a time; it makes them easy to dip and dry quickly. The freezer method might be too cold, when we tried that, a few of the pops end up with cracks when they go from the freezer to warm chocolate. Tap your wrist after dipping to get a smooth result. If you make them without the stick, you can use a very inexpensive plastic dipping set that makes it easier. It's in several stores near the candy melts and baking supplies. You'll get better as you go along; the first few make yummy testers. The sticks stand up in foam well. I used an old, cheap cooler lid covered in paper. We poked little holes in the foam with a skewer first, so that the stick went in easily. If this were my first attempt, I definitely wouldn't try to make 100 of these for a party or shower. Plan these as a fun project for the first time before you try to make a lot quickly"
"14","5","This is a very simple recipe that produces quite an elegant looking product!  I made four different types of Cake Balls in the last few days. I did let my cake cool several hours after baking before crumbling and mixing with the frosting ( I only used 1/2 to 3/4 container frosting... too much frosting will make the cake ball batter a 'gooey' consistency) then formed the cake balls and froze them for 2 hours. Freezing them makes them simple to work with. They dipped quite nicely into melted chocolate almond bark, which I microwaved in small batches at a time (as it hardens quickly).... I used a teaspoon to lightly roll the cake ball in the chocolate (this method works much nicer than a toothpick), then before lifting it out with the spoon I tapped the ball gently on the side of the bowl to remove any excess almond bark. As the balls were frozen, they were easy to work with (with no crumbs falling off into the melted almond bark) and the almond bark set up very quickly.  You can then freeze the cake balls until you are ready eat them or give them as gifts. They freeze and thaw quite nicely. Great recipe!  ** just a side-note.... I needed to make a quick batch of these yesterday and used a ready made angel food cake, rather than taking the time to bake a cake and let it cool... worked great! You do need two angel food cakes to equal the amount of one cake mix however."
"14","5","I made a coconut cake for a friend's birthday, and while it was delicious, it was just too crumbly to frost and layer, so I made it into cake balls. Delicious! I used the coconut cake mixed with white frosting to make the balls, then dipped them in melted white almond bark and rolled them in coconut. I would make a few suggestions though: 1)I used a cookie scoop to form the balls, but then I rolled them between my palms to make them firmer and less crumbly. 2) Form all the balls before melting the bark and dipping them. I tried to roll the balls as I went, but found that the melted bark cooled too quickly while I was working and I had to keep stopping and reheating it. 3) I put about 1/2 Tbsp shortening in with my almond bark when I melted it. This made it much smoother and easier to roll the cake in. Knowing those things now, I would definitely make this recipe again!"
"13","4","Despite this recipe being time consuming and a bit messy, I really enjoyed these! I'm excited to try a tiramisu recipe I found. They are easy and fun! My SpEd students really enjoyed making these for a Christmas activity. Thinking of making them bigger and doing cake pops for the fundraisers we do. For those who don't get how to do it or who have had negative outcomes, something with the mix is not right. It's best to really crumble the (COOLED) cake so there are no big chunks and to use a little bit of frosting at first, and then add as needed. If a whole tub is used, the balls will not form properly. Happy Cake Balling ;)"
"13","5","I have made these many, many times throughout the years. I have added different extracts such as peppermint, orange, rum, raspberry to just plain yellow cake mix or your own favorite recipe for yellow cake mix. The trick I find most helpful is to NOT use warm cake but to let the cake cool, then add 1/2 container of cream cheese frosting to make it less sweet. If you need to you can always add more frosting. Form into balls and refrigerate for about an hour or longer, or you may freeze them for 15 min before dipping them in chocolate. This way they hold their shape and do not fall apart when dipping. Try to use the candy melts available at Michaels to dip the cake balls in. While the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle with nuts, sprinkles, etc. If you are not into using frosting which does make it a little sweet, then you can also use flavored syrups or even sugar free syrups such as DaVinci syrups. Just crumble the cooled cake, mix in syrup a little at a time, maybe 1/2 cup, then form into balls, and continue to do same as with the frosting. These are a little less sweet so maybe some might like this technique better and tastier."
"13","5","I wish I would have taken a picture of these. Everyone thought they came from a bakery! I did it for my daughters 3rd birthday and used strawberry cake mix, vanilla frosting and dipped it in white chocolate. Then i took the remainder white chocolate and made it pink to drizzle over the top. And I served them in cute mini muffin cups. What a hit! I only needed half a container of frosting and Im glad I didnt use the whole thing. These may take a little time but they are not hard to make in the least bit.*Update* For a luau I used pineapple supreme cake mix, using pineapple juice instead of water and adding about 1/3-1/2 cup of crushed pineapple then baking. I used vanilla frosting and dipped it in white chocolate with coconut extract mixed in then topped with toasted coconut. WOW!"
"13","4","We have had so much fun playing with different flavor combos. Caramel cake and caramel icing mixed then coated with the chocolate and sprinkled some with crushed pretzels and the other half heath bars crumbs. Really good! I am thinking of ne and crazy ways to make these. The kids and I are having so much fun. Thank you so much! :)"
"13","5","i made 200 of these (six different varieties of cake/frosting/chocolate combinations) so yummy! everyone at work wanted to know how to make them so i ended up printing off the recipe and setting copies by the tray itself. these are the things i learned/changed: -Let cake cool before crumbling. -Use only half the can of frosting (you can add more if you need to.) -After mixing cake crumbles & frosting, refrigerate for at least 3 hours (its better overnight). -Once you form the cake balls and place them on the wax paper stick them in the freezer overnight (or as long as possible, depending on time). -Use tongs to dip in chocolate. -Do not refrigerate or freeze after dipping(causes chocolate to 'sweat') -Pre-dipped balls can be kept frozen for weeks"
"13","4","Ok, floridagirly68, these REALLY did take 7 hours!! They are easy, but VERY time consuming. Look beautiful and taste great, but don't make if you don't have A LOT of extra time! Tips: I removed the hot cake from the pan and put it in my KitchenAide mixer bowl with the frosting and mixed it until well blended. I scooped the balls with cookie scoop and shaped them with my hands. I froze the balls overnight. I don't think they would hold up when coating if they aren't frozen. When I melted the coating, it kept separating when I dipped the balls and looked really gross as it dripped off the balls. I suggest dropping the balls (one at a time) in the melted coating, rolling it around with a spoon, poking it with a toothpick, lifting it from the pan, and letting the excess drip off. Cover the hole left from the toothpick with extra melted coating. I squeezed an opposite color melted coating from a ziplock baggy (with a hole cut in it) to top them off."
"13","3","Made this exactly as written and it wasn't a hit--waaaaaay too sweet for me and my guests. Liked the idea, so I tweaked it by using 8-oz block of softened cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 cup powdered sugar, beaten together till fluffy and then mixed into the cake crumbs. Chilled the mixture and used a melon baller, and they were a hit at my Christmas party. So good, I ended up making another batch for my office party and they disappeared in no time. The bonus of making your own 'frosting' is that it's much less sweet and doesn't have that awful aftertast that the canned frosting has. Since I had to tweak this recipe, I can only give it 3 stars. Thanks for giving me the idea, though!"
"12","5","Do not use an entire tub of frosting or your cake balls will taste very gummy and not very good. I use half a tub of frosting for one box of cake mix and they are delicious! You can always add a little more frosting if you need it more moist... but once too moist you can't take it back out :("
"12","5","Excellent--but I used chocolate chips melted with some shortening instead of the confectioners coating--never like the waxy taste of those or the store bought wafers, ick. These turned out wonderfully. Important to let the balls freeze for about 40 mins to allow for easier dipping."
"12","5","I have tried several varieties and they are always a big hit. One of the favorites is confetti cake with vanilla icing dipped in white chocolate. The one I am most proud of is my s'mores balls! I took a chocolate cake and when I mixed it I did half a container of chocolate icing and about the same amount or more of marshmellow fluff. I also added pieces of marshmellow in them. I dipped them in milk chocolate and rolled them in crushed graham cracker. They are better they day after that's when they really taste like s'mores!!  Heather- I have left the cake balls before dipped in chocolate in the freezer for a while and they turn out fine. I've never tried freezing them after dipped in chocolate. I know if you refridgerate them after dipped in chocolate they turn out fine also. Hopefully that answers your question!"
"12","5","This is my new favorite dessert to bring to parties. Yes, they do take longer than cookies, but so worth it. I bake the cake the night before, let it sit in the fridge overnight. Then, I roll into balls (using a melon baller) and put them in the freezer for an hour. If you don't do this, the balls will fall apart when you try to dip them. ALSO, tips for dipping: a toothpick was way too short for me to use. I used thin wooden skewers to dip, and then twirled the skewer to coat the sides. I also used a spatula to push the melted chocolate on the cake ball while twirling. Make sure to dip in sprinkles/nuts/whatever quickly after coating with chocolate because they dry pretty quickly! Everyone so far has loved these, and people can't believe that I actually made them (they look so professional)!"
"12","5","These are a hit! I followed the advice to let the cake and frosting mixture sit in the refrigerator over night and it did indeed keep the balls intact. Feel free to experiment as I have with various flavors such as lemon cake and vanilla candy by Wilton's or spice cake and cream cheese frosting."
"12","5","You can also insert a sucker/lollipop stick into each one. Then place these into a Styrofoam tree. This makes a wonderful piece for Christmas."
"12","5","So I totally CHEATED and just used doughnut holes to make these and it was so easy,no baking :) So if you are a busy woman like me but still wanna make them, use chocolate doughnut holes! I also put these on a lollipop stick and made them look like lollipops, super cute for the holidays!"
"12","5","Awesome recipe! A coworker gave these as a Christmas treat and I had to have the recipe...little did I know it was this easy! I hate making candy because it's labor intensive even though it's so good but these are REALLY easy. I don't know why people are saying they are messy. Maybe the melted chocolate coating? Tips: Don't use all of the icing...add about half and see if that works to form a ball if not add a little more until desired consistency. The complaints a mushy mixture is caused by using the whole tub of icing. Also refridgerating is necessary after the balls are formed before dipping them in the chocolate coating...I put mine in the freezer for about 2 hours or you could refridgerate overnight...this helped to make coating them easy. I used a slotted spoon rather than toothpicks. I just placed the ball in the spoon then used another spoon to pour the chocolate over top of the ball. The excess runs out of the slots in the spoon and you don't have holes from toothpicks and they stay perfectly round! I added sprinkles to the top of mine to make them more festive. I used German chocolate cake milk chocolate icing and milk chocolate coating since that's what I had at home but I can't wait to try different variations of this recipe! Its a hit!"
"12","5","What a fun treat! I made these with red velvet cake and vanilla frosting, dipped in white almond bark and then, for Halloween, I made them into eyeballs with mini m&m's and red gel veins..kids loved them, they were such a hit! I did freeze them for several hours and this did help. What a fun and versatile recipe."
"11","5","I did have a problem with the finished balls...I had a crack in the chocolate on just about all of the balls that I made. Does anyone have any suggestions to eliminate this"
"11","5","wow, tons of reviews, may as well add my 2 cents :) Excellent dessert/treat idea. I made these for Easter, using a white cake mix and after cooling and crumbling, I added about 2 tbsp of coloured sprinkles, then added white buttercream (about 2/3rds of a cup, you do not need more than that) then rolled into balls and froze them. For dipping, Celeste made an excellent suggestion of using plastic forks with the middle tines broken off, perfect! wasn't nearly as daunting as I was thinking. I used pink candy melts, powder blue candy melts and the pastel flecked candy melts, really, really cute. I packaged these up in little boxes to give to Easter guests this weekend. Will definitely be trying different combinations. Thanks for the great idea :)"
"11","5","I make these all the time, so I've got it down to a science. The ideal mix is 1 cake mix, 1/2 container of frosting, and 1.5 bags of the chocolate melting wafers. I use a stand mixer to combine the crumbled cake with the frosting. I don't worry about letting it cool too much. I just let it cool until I can handle it. I also use a melon scooper to shape the cake balls; the small side makes 100 balls per cake mix. To dip them, I bought the cheapo chocolate dipping tool from the craft store, and it works fabulously. We made 400 of these as part of a cake table for our wedding, and they were such a big hit, people were taking them home by the handful. I also bring them to every faculty potluck at the school where I teach."
"11","5","I just had to try these after reading all of the reviews. I admit, after I finally finished dipping all of them, I swore I would not make them again no matter how good they were. That was before I tasted them... Everyone who tasted them wanted to know when I would be making them again! I used dark chocolate cake mix with chocolate cream cheese frosting. To indulge one of my favorite flavor combinations, I dipped them in mint chocolate. Very good, albeit time consuming. My second attempt was somewhat more successful with reducing the prep time. I used 2 fondue skewers... 1 to dip and the other to slide the cake ball onto waxed paper."
"11","5","When my french vanilla cake cooled enough, I broke it into pieces and mixed with Dove Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Topping instead of frosting. (I read another review and someone decided to use the Dove, so I tried it.) I mixed well and I took a cookie scoop and scooped out and rolled in my hands until the ball was nice and smooth and held together. I rolled each ball in my hands for a few seconds each and I dropped them onto a baking sheet to freeze. Try using a Wilton lollipop stick in each one for easier dipping. The second time I made these I used leftover red velvet cake and cold chocolate ganache and I dipped them into tempered milk chocolate."
"11","2","Was I supposed to overbake the cake until it was dry and crumbly? I baked the cake as directed, and it looked perfectly moist and fluffy while I was crumbling it. After mixing in the canned frosting, however, it turned into a gelatinous mess that had the look and consistency of a wet sponge. Even chilling it didn't help. This recipe sounded like a great idea, but it just didn't work for me."
"10","4","It is crucial to refrigerate overnight or freeze for at least an hour these cake balls before dipping into chocolate. If making cake pops, melt chocolate and dip the tip of the lollipop stick into the chocolate and stick that tip into the balls (it'll look like tiny caramel apples getting ready for the caramel bath) then stick these in the fridge/freezer to firm up. THEN you can dip into the melted chocolate. For a regular cake mix, I'd only use a cup of the frosting. That is more than enough."
"10","4","So i dedicated 1 whole day pretty much to making these..and im very please with the way they turned out!. I made the cake and frosting mixture one night and let it cool in the fridge over night. In the morning i rolled them into balls, and placed them on a sheet in the freezer.They stayed there all day and in the evening i took them out to do the final touches. I used a toothpick to roll them in some bakers melted chocolate. I did white chocolate and rolled them in crushed candy canes, dark chocolate and rolled them in peanuts, and also bittersweet chocolate and rolled them in coconut. They look really pretty!and taste great too! if you have the time to make them, you'll be happy :)"
"10","3","If you put in a whole container of frosting you will have a gooey ball and it will taste like uncooked cake when you're done. Yuck. I find that just half of the frosting is plenty. I also use candy melts from the craft store instead of the bark."
"10","4","I have a question...everyone makes it sound so easy. When I go to 'dip' the balls, there is no dipping. The chocolate is so thick and then the beautiful white chocolate gets all sorts of the red velvet cake crumbs. Not so pretty. Anyone able to help me?"
"10","5","Even though I have used this with a box before in the past, this time I have used from scratch, my signature carrot cake and my bakery style cream cheese-all home-made, surely is a win-win combination!"
"10","1","One of the worst recipes I have tried. The cake mixed with frosting turned into a mud like consistency and would have never been able to be dipped had I not froze them for an hour. Will never make again..."
"10","5","These are SO tasty...it's probably sinful. At least at the rate I was eating them! I love that you can customize this recipe to whatever flavor you need. Definitely freeze the cake balls before you dip them - it worked beautifully."
"10","5","I used a dark chocoate cake mix and then used peanut butter instead of frosting. Then dipped in chocoalte and it was a lot like a reeses cup!"
"10","5","people - you are making this harder than it needs to be. 1. bake a cake. 2. mix it with icing. 3. roll it into bitesize balls. 3. freeze for 1-2 hrs. dip in melted chocolate. FABULOUS (also you can snack on some of the 'dough' while you are making the balls.)"
"10","5","These were awesome! I made these as a dessert for my cookie exchange and everyone preferred these to the cookies. One warning - don't make the mistake of using baking chocolate like I did for the coating. It was a bad consistency. Make sure to use candy coating."
"10","5","These are GREAT! I took them to work today and they all BEGGED me to make more tomorrow! I used vanilla cake and chocolate icing. It was hard to dip them in the chocolate coating though. I did refrigerate them first but bits of cake would come off in the chocolate and gum it up. So I ended up pouring chocolate over the tops. I used my larger scoop to make the balls and it made way more than 36. I had to use a lot more chocolate coating also. Added note- the next time I made these, I FROZE the balls before dipping and that worked WAY better!!!"
"10","4","These are good. DH liked them and he hates anything that's too sweet/rich. Got 5 doz with my 1' scooper. Dipped about a dozen in dipping chocolate, which seemed thick and goopy and even with the egg dipper was a pain cause some of the balls slid through. Good idea though! Ended up dumping the melted chocolate in a ziploc, snipped the corner off and drizzling it over the remaining balls and then let them set up. Won't make these often, but when I need something that looks fancy these are fairly easy (tho a little time consuming but can be done in advance). Forgot to refrigerate the balls, that would definitely help next time.  [Update] This is also a really good way to 'sculpt' cake shapes for DS's Cub Scout Blue & Gold Dinner. It was the basis for this year's Death Star and Vader's Tie Fighter."
"9","5","Great (but super sweet) treat! I did make some modifications: 1. Let cake cool for 30 minutes. 2. Mix in 1/2 tub of frosting. 3. Use small scoop to form the balls, place on wax paper and freeze for 30-60 minutes.  4. I made mine into cake pop by dipping the tip of the stick into the melted chocolate and inserting into the cooled cake ball.  5. Used a full bag of the chocolate coating I purchased from craft store.  6. Decorated with sprinkles.  7. Use something to hold the sticks while the chocolate hardens. (Hint- I turned my metal collander upside down and inserted the sticks into the holes- worked great! You could also purchase styrofoam block at craft store)   Overall these turned out great, I wrapped them up individually for a bake sale and they were a huge hit! While they take awhile to make, the time is mainly spent waiting on the cake to cool or the balls to chill.   For my first batch I made all Chocolate (cake, icing, coating). But I cannot wait to experiment with various flavors."
"9","1","Yuck. Soggy, canned-frosting-flavored cake. Between the mushy cake and the waxy outside candy coating, the textures are very unpleasant."
"9","3","Instead of using chocolate flaovered coating i used melted choclate chips it didnt work well so it ebdend up being a ball of cake with a blob of chocolat on top"
"9","1","Ugh. These are way too much of a pain to make and I didn't think the end result was worth it. In fact, I didn't care for them at all (I used red velvet cake mix and cream cheese frosting). I dipped about 2 dozen and have about 3 dozen left to dip but am so annoyed with them that I think I'm just going to skip it."
"9","5","Wonderful. Here is what I learned after making several batches. 1) use cake mix and packaged frosting only. Trying to be fancy and make from scratch is actually counter productive. I learned that the hard way. 2) bake cake in a 9x13. Cool for 30 minutes. Trim the edges, cut up then cake into sections, and place in a large bowl. 3) use only 1/2 of a can of frosting for each cake and stir by hand. It is easier if you stir the frosting first to loosen it up. 4) roll the balls immediately and freeze them for a couple hours or overnight 5) melt chips, not almond bark. For chocolate chips, add in 1/2 T shortening for each cup of chips. For white chocolate chips, use 1 T shortening for each cup of chips. 6) dip the balls using long wooden picks and then press the pick into a piece of styrofoam so that the coating can dry without creating a 'flat side' that you would get if you let them dry on a flat surface. To remove the pick once the chocolate has set, gently twist the pick out. If you just pull, the chocolate will break."
"9","4","These are cute and easy to travel with (e.g. easier to bring to a potluck than cupcakes) and they weren't too difficult to make... just rather time consuming (to be fair, a lot of the time was chilling time for me). They taste fine too, just perhaps not really worth it. I'm glad I tried it out, but won't really be in a hurry to do them again. I did cherry chip cake + french vanilla frosting, and chocolate fudge cake + chocolate frosting. I also experimented with a few different methods of doing the chocolate dipping, and found I had the most success with freezing the balls as others said, then placing it in the melted chocolate by hand, using a spoon to gently roll around/spoon chocolate over if needed, then piercing with a skewer to lift out and let excess drip off. Placed on a parchment-covered cookie sheet with the skewer still in it to dry (sets up very quickly), then gently wiggled the skewer out. This leaves a small hole in the top, but it can be covered with a small drop of chocolate if wanted, or if decorating further, it won't even be noticeable."
"9","3","As written, the recipe is flawed. Thankfully I did read the reviews and used only half a tub of frosting. The balls fall apart in the melted coating if not frozen, so FREEZE them. Also, 3 oz of coating? Seriously? No way would that coat the entire batch. The first time I used a full 16oz package, and really needed more. The 2nd time I made them, I froze the balls, and I used probably 5-6 oz of coating. Freezing them makes a HUGE difference."
"9","3","This is a basic recipe for basic cake balls. Because every cake mix is different, the amount of frosting you add must be adjusted accordingly. If your centers are too wet to form with your hands or are so gooey that they don't taste good, you have made an error, albeit one that the recipe itself doesn't seem to warn you about, so it isn't your fault. (Another thing that might go wrong is if your cake is too warm. That'll melt your frosting, then you have a bowl of slime.) You can use any cake and any frosting (or peanut butter or Nutella or cashew butter or whatever, you get the idea) combination that floats your boat. You can roll them in powdered sugar or crushed nuts or something if the chocolate dipping isn't working out. Never ever use confectioner's coating unless you have absolutely got to have colored bonbons, in which case get the Wilton melts (from a craft store). That candy coating stuff you buy at the grocery store is not fit for human consumption. I don't like these with canned frosting, personally, or the Oreo ones either, but this basic recipe can be a good one, and it can be made by children with success. I made mine today using a boxed dark chocolate cake mix, 3 oz. nutella, 10 oz. peanut butter (my cake was very moist, so 16 oz. would've been gross), and rolled the balls in powdered sugar. I got 48 from this batch, not 36, and many of them were quite large. Thanks for the recipe!"
"9","5","I love cake balls, but they are time consuming. I've grown to despise the dipping in chocolate part! After many batches and many different types of chocolate, I found that Lindt Lindor Truffles work the best. Their chocolate is much better tasting than chocolate chips, baker's chocolate, etc. It melts quickly and is very thin which makes dipping the balls much easier. If the chocolate you use is thick, add 1/2-1 teaspoon (depending on how much chocolate) of veggie oil to thin it out. The taste won't be compromised at all! I also use half a tub of frosting instead of the whole thing. Either way, the cake balls taste exactly the same."
"9","5","I make these often for partys I cater. The recipe makes alot. You can use many combos of cake and frosting. Everyone loves these when I serve them. I keep uncoated cake balls in the freezer, so I have them when I need them."
"9","5","These are sooo good! I used strawberry cake, 1/2 container of cream cheese frosting and dipped them into milk chocolate chips...I added a tablespoon of shortening to the chips as they melted. I only had butter flavored shortening and it worked just fine..I was a little nervous about that..but had no problems...I agree with another post about keeping some of the balls in the freezer as you work on the others. As they start to thaw, they 'sweat' a little and it may make the chocolate chips seize up a abit..I just melted a few more chips and tiny bits of shortening as the chocolate thickened...Kept chocolate in double boiler on lowest heat the whole time...time consuming, but well worth the effort!"
"9","5","I made these with yellow cake and cream cheese frosting and then dipped them in chocolate - they came out great! I think the mixed reviews come from the many variables in the recipe when you start playing around with it (the type of cake, the consistency of the frosting, etc.) The rule of thumb is to get the cake crumbs just moist enough so that the mixture sticks together."
"9","4","VERY GOOD AND VERY SWEET. It's 10:00PM and I'm still having a sugar rush!!! Next time I'll have to melt the chocolate covering in a bowl in water. Also, decorate with opposite color chocolate with a bag with a little hole. Best if eaten with milk. The actual decorating was a bit time consuming but well worth it. My daughter had fun making them and sharing them with her friends."
"9","5","Wow, these rule. I read almost every review on here and here's my input: 1) I used German Chocolate cake and the pecan frosting that comes with it. It is ok to use the whole can of frosting with this cake because it is thicker. The thinner, more sugary frostings DO NOT use the whole thing or your cake will turn out to be mush as my other attempt did (cherry chip with cherry frosting) I had to throw that whole batch away. 2) Allow cake to cool completely before breaking up into pieces and adding frosting 3) Once frosting was cooled I mixed frosting with cake and put into the fridge overnight  4) The next day I formed all of the cake balls. Placing wax paper on a cookie sheet and then sticking entire cookie sheet in the freezer.  5) I removed about 10 balls at a time from the freezer so they wouldnt thaw out and then I dipped them into chocolate. I used 2 bags of chocolate chips and thinned it out with a bit of vegetable oil so it would coat the cake balls nicely. Make sure to keep them refridgerated after making as chocolate will melt! Overall a time consuming recipe, messy yes, but well worth it. I'll for sure be making these again and try different flavors with for sure keeping in mind the frosting situation. I think one cake batch made about 44 cake balls and I used a Pampered Chef Medium Scoop to form the balls."
"9","5","Made these for our family Christmas party , they were very big hit! Used German Choc Cake and Caramel Pecan frosting - I froze the mixture before I rolled into balls which made it very easy to roll and then froze again before dipping in chocolate. Will make these again. Wonderful!"
"9","5","Very good. Leave a lot of time for prep. I mixed the cake and frosting, rolled into balls with my hands, placed on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper...then put in the freezer for 30 minutes before dipping. I used 2 spoons to coat and dip into the vanilla almond bark. I also used 3X as much almond bark than the recipe called for...then sprinkled with colored red sugar after dipping. Very pleasing to the eye..and got rave reviews from family and co-workers. Thank you for the recipe! Second making of cake balls....white cake with strawberry icing, coated with vanilla almond bark...pure Heaven! Third making of 'The Balls'. Red velvet cake with vanilla icing coated with vanilla almond bark...It does NOT get any better than this! I absolutely love this recipe!!!"
"8","5","I'm not too big a fan of cake pops, but my cousins and friends all loved these! definitely cool the cake before adding frosting and then chill the balls for a bit before dunking them in the chocolate coating. we used colored candy melts and rainbow sprinkles. for the super cute cake pops in my picture!"
"8","4","Cake truffles are a sure crowd pleaser, and they are not difficult to make. Some tips: 1. Use 1/2 can of frosting. It gives a great consistency -not mushy. 2. A hand mixer or food processor mix the cake and frosting easily.  3. As noted before, insert a toothpick and freeze the cake balls for at least an hour before dipping. 4. Consider buying dipping chocolate from your local chocolatier. I paid about $6 a pound for white and dark chocolate and it is superior to chocolate chips or those Wilton wafer thingys.  5. Closely monitor the temperature of the dipping chocolate - white chocolate in particular will 'seize up.' 6. Use a spoon or small ladle to aid in covering the cake ball with chocolate. if toothpicks don't work for you, hold the cake ball on a plastic fork with the two center tines broken out.  7. Serve them in mini muffin cups or candy cups. JoAnn has some darling ones."
"8","4","This was my first attempt at cake balls. After baking the cake I immediately transferred the cake to a glass bowl to cool a bit. I avoided transferring the tough cake edges. I then used 8 ounces of frosting and mixed it in with an electric mixer. The result resembled dough. I formed the balls and put them in the freezer for an hour. Now here comes the hard part, coating the balls. I tried the toothpick method and it didnt work for me. So then I used a fork and spoon which was a lot better but I still was not happy with the result. Some of the coating on the balls even cracked. These are very time consuming so Im not sure I will make them again, considering the way they turned out. They did taste good though. I used red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting.  UPDATE****I made another batch with chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting. This time I only used 1/2 cup of frosting. I used a pastry blender to crumble the cake and mix in the frosting. The balls held together nicely while still having the cake texture (not doughy). I tried the toothpick method again. This time I LEFT THE TOOTHPICK IN THE CAKE BALL. Just before the coating dried, but still gooey, I removed the toothpick and the coating settled into the hole. Also if your coating is too thick add a tiny bit of canola oil to loosen it up."
"8","5","The only problem is that there a step missing. COOL THE BALLS in the refrigerator for an hour before trying to dip them in the chocolate. Kinda an important step to be missing. Otherwise very yummy!"
"8","5","These little treats are perfect as gifts! One tip: don't make the balls too large, make them bite size. It's easier to coat them and easier to eat them that way."
"8","4","Good recipe but let it cool before you mix in the icing. Then make the balls with a melon baller and put them in the freezer for at least an hour. When you dip them frozen the coating hardens right away."
"8","5","I have made these 2 x's within about 1 month. The first time I made devil's food chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate almond bark coating...Deeeeelish! My friends and family all loved them. I made them mini size, using mini cupcake liners to present them. I placed each ball after it was coated in a pretty cupcake liner and topped some with sprinkles and some with chopped pecans. The 2nd time I made them I used red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting. I covered them with white chocolate and topped with sprinkles. They were another big hit with everyone.  I really don't think you can go wrong with these! Definitely a keeper in my recipe box!!! Other combos I have come up with are: white cake with strawberry frosting yellow cake with lemon frosting The recipe makes about 100 mini-balls. Another tip: to thin the almond bark use butter flavored crisco shortening. A teaspoon goes a long way so go easy. I use butter flavored because it doesn't take the flavor away from the chocolate. What a fun recipe! Easy, quick and good!"
"8","5","These are SO much fun to make! Some tips... I used Wilton candy coating in white chocolate and dark chocolate. DO NOT USE dark chocolate. I haven't tried the milk chocolate, but the dark doesn't melt correctly, making it impossible to coat the balls. I ended up mixing some of the white with the dark and it worked. Some reviews said to just put them in the fridge for an hour after forming, I'd suggest the freezer like other reviewers said. Having them cold when dipping helps A LOT. I put my left over white chocolate in two different sandwich bags and added a drop of food coloring in each and barely snipped the corner of the bag to be able to drizzle on them. I used two skewers to dip and it seemed to work really well. I will be trying the lollipop sticks next time. I was a bit intimidated to make these, but don't be... they're really fun and very rewarding because they turn out SO cute! I'm going to try and make easter eggs the next time around!"
"8","5","Absolutely wonderful! I made 35 boxes of these (4 of each of 5 different kinds in each box) for Christmas this year.... It took almost 2 days to complete them all but everyone raved!!! I made Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting dipped in White Chocolate......... Cherry Cake with Cherry Frosting in Milk Chocolate (tasted like a cordial cherry)....... Chocolate Cake with Chocolate frosting made to taste like chocolate mint with a little peppermint extract mixed in with cake and frosting, dipped in semi-sweet chocolate.........Lemon Cake with Lemon Frosting dipped in white chocolate....... German Chocolate Cake with Pecan Coconut Frosting, added extra coconut & nuts and dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate...... NOTE: I did not use the confectioners coating, I used approximately 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening to 2 bags of chocolate chips, heated over medium heat on a double boiler... to coat them, I added the cake balls and used two spoons and transfered them back and forth sorta like seperating the egg yolk from the whites and then placed them on waxed paper to set.... Can't wait to make these again!!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"8","5","does anyone have any helpful tips for dipping these in the choc??? thanks!!"
"8","5","...FIVE STARS +.... These are awesome. I made the cake and mixed in icing using a fork (I didn't want it too mushy). Left in fridge overnight. Shaped into balls and put balls in freezer for at least 3 hours. Then dipped in the melted chocolate and white chocolate bark. I sprinkled some with crushed pecans and some with crushed Oreos. They are a major hit! They are perfect to place in a box and give as Christmas goodies. I already have another batch in my fridge. I have gotten so many compliments!! Woohoo...my new dessert staple has been found! Thanks much to whoever created this recipe!"
"8","5","Wonderful recipe! Used yellow cake and full container of strawberries and cream frosting. Refrigerated blend before making the balls. That made the blend easier to roll up by hand without being so sticky. Froze the balls before using toothpicks to pick up and coat with white chocolate. Freezing kept the balls on the toothpicks and saved the chocolate from crumbs. Then after they dried I drizzled colored chocolate on them. Turned out very moist and delicious. Also made a batch using chocolate cake with creamy coconut pecan frosting. FabHub liked those the most."
"8","4","I agree they are much easier to coat if you freeze then first. I would suggest useing a candy dipping fork you can get them in the candy making or cake decorating area of most craft stores. I have seen them at walmart also wilton makes one that is a loop and one that is like a 2 pronged fork. This is all would ever use fof dipping any thing like this.Tooth picks just don't like to stay in things sometimes."
"8","5","I love making these and have a few tips, some which may have already been offered but work for me: 1) Cool rolled balls on waxed paper on baking sheet in fridge for two hours, then freeze for 3 hours or overnight. 2)I used Bakers Chocolate Squares melted with 1 T. shortening in place of the bark- hate that stuff. 3) Also have used white chocolate chips melted with 1 1/2 T shortening 4) Used egg white separator to dip balls in chocolate 5)Used a toothpick to run line around chocolate that pooled around dipped balls before it hardens- makes it easier to remove that extra chocolate. 6)Do not refrigerate balls once coated- they will 'melt.' 7) You CAN freeze coated balls. 8) You can also store extra uncoated balls in freezer for use another time. 9) lollipop sticks with a ribbon looks great stuck in the balls- do this while chocolate is still wet. 10) besides chocolate with chocolate frosting, red velvet with cream cheese frosting mixed in is a favorite 11) use fork to crumble a 1/4 of the cake at a time while its slightly warm, then mix in frosting with a fork a 1/4 at a time, using less than the entire can- maybe 3/4 of it. You don't want a gooey mess! Hope this helps and have fun with this recipe!"
"8","5","Seriously, my favorite kind of recipe. Fairly easy, very versatile, and people love them. Some of the flavors I've tried taste sort of fake (strawberry), others are sinful: And still, everyone asks for more. Use chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate, and you won't be able to convince your friends it's not a fancy truffle. The best trick I've picked up here? Freeze the balls till they're pretty solid. Buy a good size chunk of floral styrofoam. Buy some bamboo skewers. Put the frozen balls on the skewers, dip well, stick in the styrofoam to dry, remove skewer if you want. Voila, perfectly dipped cake balls."
"8","1","I'd rather have a piece of cake. It was a waste of a cake mix and good chocolate"
"8","5","Yummy! These went over very well with kids AND adults. I used red velvet with buttercream frosting and white almond bark to coat. I have never coated anything before, so I had a little trouble, but I did freeze them first which I think helped tremendously. I only used 3/4 of the frosting and added it in big spoonfuls. Perfect!"
"8","5","Don't listen to bad reviews. I almost did, and if I would have I REALLY would have missed out.  Key tips: 1) Refrigerate mixture for a hour. It's easier to make balls. 2) Freeze balls for another hour. Easy to dip.  I followed those 2 key tips from another review, and everything went easy for me.  My husband told me he couldn't believe I made these. They reminded him of those fancy chocolate covered strawberries.   These taste special, they look amazing, and anyone would love to receive them as a gift.   Thanks so much AMALLEN23!"
"8","1","Will give it another go, but am initially so disappointed. I should have known better when almost all of the professional and expert level cooks rated it so low. The taste was just...well, cake (albeit soggy & cloyingly sweet cake) rolled up in balls. I used good dark chocolate and French vanilla mix & vanilla frosting. Wish there was an option on website to ask ?s from others who have had success. I bake almost every day and I had such high hopes. Such a mixed bag; reviewers either love or hate these. I will edit if the next batch is better:("
"8","5","OMG!!! Tips: I made the cake in a 9x13 pan, inverted it onto a wire rack to cool and cut it into slices to cool faster:about 30 min. I put the cake in a large metal bowl and used my hand mixer to 'crumb' the cake, then mixed in frosting and some chopped pecans/ about 1/2 cup. with the mixer, I sat it in the fridge for exactly 2 hours. For coating: I used Wilton's candy melts, I added about 1 tbsp. evaporated milk (per 1/3 bag) to make it extra creamy, microwaved it for 1 min 20 sec. after I had rolled cake into balls I dipped each ball coating only half of the ball- I let it rest on waxed paper on the uncoated side (or leaning close to it) and waited for them to dry, they were all dry by the time I finished the first 'dip' on the last ball I had rolled. I then went through and while holding the dry chocolate coated side dipped the uncoated side into the chocolate. This allowed the balls to not have any holes from the toothpicks or lost balls in the coating bowl!!! I got RAVE reviews when I brought them to a party - I will be making all different versions of these and boxing them as gifts!!!!! Great idea!"
"8","5","I made these for an open house and they were a huge hit! I used the german chocolate cake mix and the coconut pecan icing. I also dipped these in the white chocolate (almond bark). One thing I found is that if you freeze the balls a little before you dip them, they are easier to dip. I had a couple people ask for the recipe. I also made these for a Halloween party. I used the red velvet cake and dipped them in white chocolate. I then painted colored circles on the top then a black dot in the middle to make them look like eyeballs. They were a huge hit! UPDATE: If you want to make these even easier... buy the mini baking and party cups... put a little chocolate in the bottom.... put the cake ball in it... and then pour a little of the chocolate on top. If you do it this way you dont even have to freeze them."
"8","5","I will use this recipe again. Refrigerating before coating is a must. I used a lot more chocolate coating than what this recipe calls for. Do not melt the chocolate in a microwave. Use a double boiler so the coating remains the right consistency for dipping. We made these for my dad's 95th birthday party, with the idea of making them look like road apples (horse manure). My father lives on a farm and is a horse lover. We used chocolate cake, German chocolate frosting and chocolate coating. After coating them with chocolate we rolled them in green and yellow, lightly toasted coconut. We made these of varing sizes, but averaged two inches. These were stacked up in a child's wheelbarrow. They were quite a hit! Three cake mixes, 4 cans of frosting yielded 100."
"7","4","There were tears, sweat, cursing...and then there were cake balls. With the task of planning my best friends bridal shower, I thought these might be a fun alternative to cakes or cupcakes. Begin cake ball trial #1. I am not a baker by any means, and with all the different reviews about this recipe I was nervous to start! I baked a cake mix, mixed with icing while hot (I did not use all the icing and added a little at a time) and made into balls with a 1 inch diameter cookie scoop. Left toothpicks in the balls and put on sheets in the freezer. So far, so good. Several hours later, upon dipping them in chocolate melting disks, realized the toothpicks were a mistake-I couldn't get them off! Some fell off in the chocolate, some started crumbling, and in general came out rather unattractive looking, as the chocolate coated really thick. However, I still found them rather tasty and the texture not at all unpleasant. Plus, what an affordable party dessert! Despite the pain these are to make, I will definitely put these on the shower menu- with some extra decoration to pretty them up."
"7","4","Succinct, easy, just make sure to cool your cake before crumbling and cut off the edges if they're a bit too brown and/or hard. If you don't use a confectioner's coating (chocolate bar or candy making discs) be sure to either temper your chocolate or if you're using chocolate chips, add 1 Tb of shortening to every cup of chips to create a smooth chocolate coating that will harden and look nice!"
"7","5","I don't remember WHEN I learned of this recipe - these sell well at bake sales and also no problem to make ahead of time. They keep well at least a week. One thing I also do is make LITTLE cake balls using pretzels instead of pop sticks - great for smaller portions. Pretzels are earth freindly so to speak. I will be making the little ones and big ones for my son's wedding reception. Recently I found a recipe using cream cheese - will try that this week. The book 'Cake Pops: Tips, Tricks, and Recipes for More Than 40 Irresistible Mini Treats' adds a lot of fun."
"7","4","I made this for Christmas, and they were a big hit. I loved playing with the flavors. I think our favorite was gingerbread with lemon frosting and vanilla coating. I was a little heavy-handed with the frosting to make the mixture nice and mold-able. And I used a cookie scoop to shape the balls. I'm thinking about trying chocolate with nutella next time I make them."
"7","5","I made these for Christmas. I followed other people advice by using a half a can of frosting instead of a full can. They are a little work but well worth it. I made chocolate cake balls and added mint extract to taste to the icing and blended it together, and they were awesome. Thanks again for sharing and so much cheaper than the one at Starbucks."
"7","3","I rated this 3 stars. Why? It doesn't include the most important directions, just the minor ones. First, use only about half of your icing, maybe 3/4 depending on your cake you made. Also, allow your cake to cool ALMOST all the way, it should still have just a bit of heat. Once you mix, let cool in the freezer about 30 minutes. Take the mix out, roll into balls, then put BACK in the freezer to cool for another 30-45 minutes. Take out, dip in your chocolate, and then set to cool. :)  I made cinnamon swirl cake with a cream cheese icing ball, dipper in white almond bark, then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, red sprinkles, and drizzled with red vanilla icing and peppermint-cream-cheese icing. :)"
"7","5","Used a really moist cake chocolate mix and drizzled vanilla frosting and my husband could not stop eating them!!Major win!"
"7","4","These are delicious and easy, but after making them twice I have suggestions for them to turn out the best they can. The cake should cool completely before you break it into crumbs. Also, I use only half the container of frosting. My first attempt, I used the whole container and they were too soft and tasted too much of frosting, not cake. But using half the container they tasted of cake and were much firmer and easier to keep on the pop sticks for dipping. I used pop sticks instead of keeping them as balls. For easiest dipping, did your pop stick in the melted chocolate, then insert into your cake ball. Then procede with dipping the cake balls.These are such a hit with kids, and with adults who want just a little something instead of a whole piece of cake. Great for cocktail parties!"
"7","5","As a recipe that has been around longer than Starbucks has had their Cake Pop's, this is obviously a hit-it-out-of-the-ball-park dessert. I used this recipe as a starting point for my cake pops. I decided to make Chocolate Mint ones. I used 1/2 chocolate cake & 1/2 tub chocolate frosting. I mixed peppermint extract in w/ the frosting (just enough to please the taste buds). When it was ready for dipping, i used melted Andes Mint Chips. Theses mint ones were amazing. With the second 1/2 of the cake and frosting I did peanut butter/chocolate. the balls were completely chocolate. For the dip I melted 1/2 milk chocolate chips with 1/2 peanutbutter chips. these too were devine."
"7","5","These things are just a little slice of heaven! I used a red velvet cake recipe from the Cake Doctor book, let the cake cool for about 30 minutes, then cut it into about 2' chunks and put it in the bowl of the mixer. Used the dough hook, first to break up the cake, and as others suggested, used less than the whole container of icing (probably 2/3). Scooped them with the smallest cookie scoop, rolled them into balls and refrigerated them for about 2 hours, then used toothpicks to dip with Wiltons candy melts vanilla. Let them cool back in fridge for a few minutes and stored in an airtight container. My granddaughter and I had a good time making them and the whole family loved them. I'm already thinking of other flavors to try!"
"7","5","Don't make this recipe unless you want to be hooked! You'll love the first combination you make, and then you'll think 'hmmm... I wonder if I combined this flavor cake with this icing' and you'll make that. And then another combination will come to mind, and you just have to try that, too! And they're all good! Honestly, though, my kids like white cake, white icing, dipped in tinted white almond bark with sprinkles (a la Starbucks Birthday Cake Cake Pop). My newest is to make a chocolate cake with coffee instead of the water in the directions, add coffee cream cheese icing (homemade), dipped in chocolate almond bark. Yum! I freeze the balls with a toothpick in them to make it easy to dip in the almond bark. Then just remove the toothpick gently after they're dipped. Way easy - so good!"
"7","5","This is my first time making the cake pops, so I used a vanilla cake and my own cream cheese frosting. I wanted them to look like an old fashioned soda counter treat. It was time consuming but lots of fun. The topper is a chocolate sixlet and I used the candy melts from the craft store. One problem I had in the beginning was I took the chilled cake balls and dipped them in the heated melts and they cracked when they cooled. So I guess you need to let the coating and balls sit before dipping. You live and learn. We enjoyed eating these as much as making them."
"7","4","Definitely crumble cake when completely cool, and form into balls shapes and then FREEZE for at least 30 minutes before dunking in the coating. I used a funfetti cake mix and a regular vanilla frosting for the interior and candy melts of different colors for the coating - you need MUCH more than 3 oz of coating, though...I used about half of three different 14 oz bags (21 oz total)."
"7","5","Great recipe! I used Yellow cake mix and substituted ½ of the oil with applesauce. I used cream cheese frosting, but only like ¾ of a container. I also waited until the cake was completely cool before mixing it up. I warmed up the frosting for like 20 seconds before mixing it in. I just used a fork to mash it all together. I also didn’t use a melon baller.. I just used a spoon to scoop it out, then formed it with my hands. Then I froze the balls for a while, and then while they were still hard from the freezer, I dipped them in melted chocolate. I found that using a toothpick was the easiest way. These got great reviews at the fathers day gathering, and at work the next day. I will definitely make again, and I am excited to try different flavors!"
"7","4","5 Stars for it being easy and yummy, but 4 stars because the directions as written make it rather difficult to coat the balls with the chocolate. Also, there was not enough chocolate, I had to make more using cocoa, sugar and oil. I made a chocolate cake from scratch and used nutella instead of frosting - O.M.G!! So good with the nutella! This was a fun recipe to have my nieces make, with my supervision. They had fun mixing the cake and nutella with their hands and then licking it off :)"
"7","3","I tried to make these recently after I saw them on Bakerella's website. I intended to make them as 'pops' as she had on her site. I bought strawberry cake mix, cream cheese frosting and chocolate for dipping. After mixing up the cake and frosting, I tasted it and found it to be disgusting. I couldn't imagine how it would be all finished - if the texture was still mush like the mixed crumbled cake and frosting was and then just coated with chocolate? So I didn't bother to finish them. Too sweet. Too artificial tasting. And, for the taste, not worth the effort. Instead, I scooped out balls of cheesecake (frozen variety, partially thawed) , froze them, rolled them in crushed graham cracker crumbs and dipped them in the melted chocolate. Stuck the popsicle stick in those and they were a hit. I wouldn't try to make the cake balls again."
"7","5","Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. These are incredible. I am making for the 5th or 6th time today and putting a maraschino cherry in the center, not because this recipe needs anything at all, but my husband loves chocolate covered cherries and I think he will really love these (he loves the original recipe w/o the cherries). I drained a jar of cherries for 10 minutes and then wrapped each one with the cake mixture. After I pulled all the stems off, it occurred to me that I probably should have left them on and used that to dip them (next time). Thank you again for sharing this recipe. I made several batches at Christmas and everyone loved them."
"7","5","Without a doubt, the easiest and tastiest way to make individual pastries! I made red velvet with cream cheese frosting. I used my Pampered chef scoop and made a little mound with a flat bottom rather than a ball. Froze overnight. I dipped the top of the mound about half way into melted white chocolate chips then rolled in toppings: mini chocolate chips, coconut, nuts, sprinkles. Everyone raved over them at the Christmas party and thought they were professionally made. I'm not a huge fan of red velvet normally but made them because of the color for Christmas and even I liked them! Thanks for the recipe!"
"7","1","How much sugar does a person need? Also, because the cake and frosting are mixed together, it feels like I'm eating something regurgitated. Not a good texture for me. Will not try this again. They only look pretty."
"7","4","Very good everyone loved these.... Dipping them was difficult but that was probally due to it being the first time I made these"
"7","5","I read all the reviews. I did cool cake to touch then crumbed finely. Microwave frosting for 20 seconds then used hand mixer to mix well. Fridge for 1 hour made balls then froze them. This was sooo easy!"
"7","2","They tasted ok, and looked ok, but the work that goes into them is too much!! It was alot harder to dip the cake balls then the recipe described. Also it definitely took more time than and hour and a half. It would only take that time if you made these time and again and were really good at it. It takes alot of effort for a product that unless you are a pro at cake dipping/decorating doesnt look too great."
"7","5","This was a big hit! Very easy to make. These are the things I did to make it work: * Broke up cake into crumbs while still warm. Let crumbs cool before adding icing. * Added whole container of icing. Did it a little bit at a time to make sure it didn't get too mushy. * Didn't have scooper, used hand to form balls (like meatballs) about 30 balls * Put in freezer for about 1 1/2 hours before dipping. * Used toothpick to place ball in melted chocolate, used spoon to pour chocolate on ball while in bowl. used toothpick and spoon to place ball onto try to cool. * Added coconut and sprinkles. *DELICIOUS!"
"7","4","VERY GOOD! My choice was to make chocolate peanut butter. I used Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix to make cupcakes. While they were baking I mixed 1/2 cup of peanut butter with 1/2 cup chocolate frosting. Once the cupcakes were done, I put them in a mixing bowl and added the frosting mixture until it was the consistency of dough, using an electric mixer. I did not use all the frosting. It made the cake taste like a moist peanut butter brownie. I then rolled and froze them for an hour before dipping them in dark chocolate. I placed them on a cookie sheet for decorating prior to placing them in their paper wrappers. Thank you Allison for sharing! I'm looking forward to trying pineapple cake rolled in white chocolate and coconut."
"7","5","The people at my work place loved these! Here are the tips I used . . . 1. Don't be concerned with your frosting size - I used a whipped frosting that was only 14 oz and it turned out just fine. 2. It took almost a whole 'standard' pkg of almond bark to coat a whole box of cake mix. 3. One cake box made about 35 cake balls. 4. Wait at least 1/2 hr to mix the cake and the frosting! The cake has to be WARM but not HOT otherwise the cake balls won't stick together. 5. Freeze the cake balls before you dip them in the bark."
"7","5","I just made these for the second time tonight and I will say, much easier the second time around. It is time consuming, but it's really a lot of wait time. I was making these for a party on Saturday, so I baked the cakes on Thursday, mixed in the frosting and put in the fridge to chill until the next day. On Friday, I used a cookie scoop and rolled the dough into balls. After making the balls, I stuck a party pick (fancy toothpicks) into each one as a handle, then I put the cookie sheets into the freezer for about an hour or so (at that time, I went and did other things around the house). After the cake balls were firm I dipped them in chocolate (using the toothpicks made this way easier this time) and put them back on the cookie sheets and into the freezer to set the chocolate. I made these using white cake with vanilla frosting dipped in dark chocolate and then devels food cake with fudge chocolate frosting dipped in white chocolate. My final comment, YES, they are sweet, it's cake, frosting and chocolate, how can it not be sweet??!"
"7","5","I love how versatile these are! And they are *so* good....they don't taste anything like regular cake and frosting, more like a bon-bon! Once mixed I can't tell whether the cake and frosting were 'commercial' or homemade, but I *can* tell if the shell is 'chocolate coating' instead of real chocolate. I substitute 2 cups Toll house chips melted with 1 Tbls shortening for the coating. It doesn't take any longer to heat up and tastes *so* much better! My favorite is 'german chocolate' (dark chocolate cake with caramel coconut frosting and chocolate shell), but my kids love 'PBJ' (strawberry cake with vanilla frosting and peanut butter chip shell)."
"7","5","Fun recipe, but there definitely is an art to making these. I agree with one of the previous reviewers, that when making this for the first time make sure you have plenty of time and are just doing it for fun as it may take a little while to figure out which of the suggestions offered work better for you. This recipe is so well reviewed, that I am just noting what worked for me so that I can remember what I did. Used Duncan Heinz cake mix, and homemade frosting, but reduced frosting incorporated with cake to 8 oz (about 1 cup). Either refrigerate overnight (if making ahead) or put in the freezer for several hours (if making the same day) and get the cake/frosting combo cold, but not frozen. Double boiler worked better for melting and maintaining a constant temp/consistency of the confectioner's coating than the bowl/microwave method did. Also good to use 1 tsp of shortening to 3 squares of candy coating to keep the coating more satin like. Easter egg dipper did't work for me. Toothpicks were better, but next time may use an old fork with most of the tines bent out so give me more room to work or give the lollipop sticks a try. Wax paper is best to cool on, but be sure to shake off the excess chocolate before placing or you'll end up with a pool of chocoate at the bottom of the ball that takes away from the pretty presentation."
"7","5","Note**** Use a cake mix that uses more oil verses water; the watery batters will make them soggy!... These were great and my 12 year old helped roll and dip them with me!... I followed recipe pretty close and thanks to other reviews, I put the balls in the freezer for about 30 mintutes before dipping in the coating!.. I would also recommend the bark for your coating... Heat in the microwave and it works like a dream... re-heated when it cooled down, but stayed liquid for about 10 minutes!... Lots of work, but fun and the final product tastes very good! Not like fudge, but like cake balls (like the name says) I used chocolate cake and chocolate frosting and they tasted a lot like those little chocolate hostess donuts!...I probably wont make very often because of the time they take, but they may become a part of our holiday tradition!... Thanks!"
"7","1","A mushy disaster. As someone else said, there is no way I could let my husband take this to work. It probably didn't help that as I was making it and describing it to my husband that he said, 'like pre-chewed food' I responded with 'more like post-chewed... hold-on, ewww'. Turns out that is what it is like.  If you read many of the reviews talk about serving it frozen, well that was not an option so from everything I could try there was no saving this. For what its worth I used Red Velvet cake and cream cheese frosting.The only reason I'm giving it one star is because I can give it to my kids as frozen treats, if not for this it would have gone in the trash. So sad, I was really looking forward to having something neat and different."

A couple helpful hints that I received when I first attempted this treat. 1) For the coating, combine 1 bag of Wilton melting chips and one package of the same flavor almond bark. 2) Let your cake balls sit out overnight on the counter to dry. It makes them less crumbly when you dip. Hope these suggestions help someone out there!"
"7","5","Yes, I can see why they're heavily addictive... they're gorgeous! I made them today for my dinner party tomorrow and I made one lemon cake and in half of the cumbs I mixed lemon frosting and the other half I put chocolate with a but of rum (I find it underlines the chocolate flavour and also reminds me a bit of Christmas :-D). While the balls were really easy to make they took me ages! From when I started on the cake mix until I had all the balls covered in chocolate it took me 5 hours! But then, I made quite small balls. From a 500gr cake mix I got 85 balls, which I froze for about 45 min. I found getting the chocolate on smoothly was quite tricky. I found that using a tooth pick to roll them around in the chocolate and then pick them up with the tooth pick was the easiest way. I then transfered the ready iced balls from the tooth pick to a cookie sheet with a fork and then left them to dry. My flatmate is already addicted to them and can't wait for tomorrow ;-) I used white, milk and dark chocolate to coat them and I prefered the milk chocolate ones.   Maybe next time, to cut out on the waiting time, I will use a ready made cake and just mix it up with the frosting and then make the balls."
"7","5","These are always a hit at parties because they are so delicious and so easy to eat. No plate and fork needed! I have made them twice. Once with strawberry cake, cream cheese icing and almond bark. Second time with German choco, coconut pecan icing, and chocolate coating. Both times delicious and devoured! I refridgerate cake after adding frosting so it is easier to roll into balls. If I have time, I also refridgerate balls before coating them."
"7","2","Ok, at the beginning, I thought this was going to be great. I froze the cake balls for 4 hours in a deep freezer. I put them in the melted chocolate--cake ball everywhere! Maybe I did something wrong here, but it was very disappointing. A great idea, but how you can get them to come out without falling apart is beyond me."
"7","5","This is a fabulous way to use up cake scraps left over from leveling or carving a cake. You can make endless varieties. Try using a liquour like amaretto or coffeemate creamer as the binding liquid instead of icing. Add mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, nuts, coconut, you name it. Go crazy!"
"7","5","AWESOME!!, you can also make these instead of cake, use crushed OREOS and cream cheese mixed together to form the ball, and coated in chocolate or any coating."
"7","5","Our local baker makes these and won't give out the recipe. I made this recipe and let several people try them and they couldn't tell the difference. Very rich and wonderful. I used choc chips with 1/2 bar of home parafin wax for the outer chocolate instead of the confectioners choc. I think it's easier to work with. I've been asked for the recipe by everyone who has tried them so far!"
"6","5","My son loves these so much he wanted them instead of cake for his birthday!"
"6","2","Cake balls/pops are delicious and, yes, time consuming. This recipe gets only 2 stars due to the fact that it is a huge bowl of mush... One box of cake requires a HALF container frosting, and add more until consistency is NOT MUSH. When using far less frosting, sticks hold well and balls do not fall apart when dipped."
"6","5","Been making these for a while. Sometimes like this, sometimes on lollipop sticks. Quick, easy, versatile. And you can keep it simple or make them elaborate. I made them for the office this Easter, but the photos are too small to upload! I used white cake & strawberry frosting dipped in white and milk chocolate and yellow cake with banana frosting dipped in white and milk chocolate. I decorated some with sprinkles and some with additional frosting flowers, put them in 3 Easter baskets with sparkly Easter eggs, glitter chicks and flowers and it was a beautiful (and delicious) presentation!"
"6","5","This is the 2nd time I used this recipe. Very good, but I do not folloow the directions as they are written. There would be way too much icing in the cake balls. Like another reviewer said, you can use coffee, ice cream topping or icing to make the cake stick together. I cut the outside edge of the cake and threw it away. I added coffee and carmel ice cream topping to the cake. You don't need a lot, just enough to make the cake moist, and roll them in balls. Freeze them. Get several out of the freezer at a time and dip them in chocolate. I used toothpicks and it worked great! I think I am going to make German Chocolate Cake Balls the next time I make these. I think they are better than cake. If you listen to these instructions, you will get cake balls that still have a cake consistency. Otherwise, it would be too moist and too sweet."
"6","4","I make these all the time. Everyone loves them! I find it easier to freeze the mixture before dipping just because they are a bit more stable when you place them in warm chocolate."
"6","5","First time trying these. I used white cake and strawberry coating with butter cream frosting. They were fun to make. They have a hidden heart under the melts. :) I made these pink lemonade ones this time. Yummy. I've made many more cake balls but none as fun as this Ice Cream Cone Sundae cake ball. Try these you'll have so much fun!"
"6","5","I made this for the first time last night, but tweaked a few things. I used strawberry cake and strawberry icing. First, my cake pan was in use from a baby shower cake, so I had to use other resources. So I made cupcakes instead, spraying the pan with nonstick spray instead of wasting cupcake liners. Once done, I put them all in a bowl and stuck them in the fridge for 30 min, then used a handmixer to combine them with the icing. Chilled the combo for about an hour, then froze the balls for a few hours. I used semisweet and dark chocolate morsels from Ghiraddeli combined in a cereal bowl and used a spoon to roll the balls around in. Turned out great!"
"6","5","So addictive, and I found out I had to thin the bakers coating with crisco. Made them for a meeting and for my kid's teachers as gifts!"
"6","5","I did a lemon cake w/ lemon icing then dipped in vanilla Candy Quik (found at Walmart). They were so good it's stupid!! Better than the triple choc I also made. I know that seems impossible but the lemon was gone before the chocolate at our Christmas cookie swap."
"6","5","Try different cake/frosting brands and you'll be surprised at the difference in flavors. I've found Devils Food is way better. Slightly cool the cake, crumble, and ad frosting to blend. Scoop out and place onto cookie sheets. Place in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. From this point work a few at a time. If making pops dip the stick into the candy coating first then into the cake ball, dip, and hold in one hand and then tap your wrist to drip excess coating. Top with sprinkles and stick pop stick into Styrofoam to set then wrap like a lolli. For cake balls work quick. These are amazing with will WoW them!"
"6","5","We make these are wonderful we make them all of the time! We will buy a cake off the day old rack at the bakery, mash them up and dip them.. Looks like you have SLAVED away for hours!"
"6","3","Okay. I had heard from tons of people that these were amazing, not including all the positive reviews. I make a German chocolate cake, coconut pecan frosting. I used Baker's semi-sweet chocolate coating to dip. My cake mix was smaller than the recipe calls for; I used an entire tub of frosting and it took 3 - 8 oz. packages to coat all the balls this recipe made. That said, I felt that they were messy to make - I mixed the cake and frosting while still warm and used a cookie scoop to make the balls. then I put in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Unless the balls were really cold, they looked kind of gloppy. They are extremely sweet. I much prefer the recipe on this site for Oreo Truffles. I do like the ability to mix and match all the flavors though. Maybe my chocolate wasn't right. May try again, but not my favorite."
"6","5","This really is very simple to make and only time consuming if you sit around and do nothing else while you are waiting on the cake to be ready. I made this with Betty Crocker Gluten Free cake mix, vanilla frosting and dipped it in chocolate. They are VERY sweet even for someone with a huge sweet tooth. I did the following: 1.Baked the cake following the instructions and let it cool for about 30 minutes. 2. Broke up the cake into crumbles and mixed in about a half a can of frosting (I figured too little was better than too much!) 3. Chilled the cake mix overnight. 4. Formed the balls of cake and placed lollipop sticks in them.  5. Froze the cake balls for about an hour and then dipped them in the Baker's Dipping Chocolate cups.  Everything together probably only took an hour of hands on time with a delicious result."
"6","5","Love the versatility. Great fun to eat. Thought we might keep them around longer if frozen. WRONG! Delicious frozen, too!"
"6","5","Wow, I wasn't sure how these were going to turn out, but W-O-W!!!! I did strawberry cake and frosting with chocolate coating and they were very delicious and refreshing! Can't wait to try different combinations!"
"6","5","I made this for the first time and found it very easy. I inserted a toothpick into each ball, froze them, then dipped them into chocolate."
"6","3","I had to start over with my batch. Apparently you should only use regular frosting not whipped frosting (it makes it look raw and gooey). And seriously, read the review that tells you to let the cake cool. It makes a huge difference."
"6","5","i love this, the flavors are infinite and they can be frozen and saved. So far my favorite combination is brownie mix with cream cheese frosting and after dipping into chocolate i sprinkle on caramel flavored sprinkles. Yum Yum."
"6","5","I make these on a regular basis and keep getting requests for more! I let the cake cool crumble it using about 1/2 of a tub of frosting. Chill over nite then roll them into one inch balls.."
"6","5","Fantastic! I agree that these definitely need to be cooled before mixing frosting and then I would roll them and then freeze before dipping in chocolate. Much easier that way! but so worth all the effort and as long as your balls are cold and frozen then it's not that much of an effort"
"6","2","This doesn't work out at all as the recipe claims. I had the exact amount of melted chocolate to dip the balls into and it's just a mess and looks terrible. Even with freezing the balls ahead. Tastes great, looks like !"
"6","5","I added a bit of shortening with the chocolate when I was meleting it and I did half a batch in white and half a batch in milk chocolate. The freezing and fridge time are totally necessary. After I mixed the frosting and cake together (just using a spatula), I put in the fridge until it was cold, then rolled into balls, and froze them so I could easily dunk them into the chocolate. A lot of work, but they came out very delicious! The white chocolate covered ones just disappeared!"
"6","3","I gave this a three because they were delish, and after i got the hang of it it went pretty quickly, BUT I could not get them to look very pretty. and it was a lot of work."
"6","5","Amazing recipe, highly addictive, super easy to make, I make my cake from scratch, I really don't enjoy ready cake mix.... I've been doing these for about 2 years now, I started using the cream cheese frosting but I found it kinda sweet, so I just started Using 1 full Cream cheese bar... and let ne tell you It is awesome! totally compliments the taste of the coating"
"6","3","If you have a severe sweet tooth, then these might be for you. They were easy enough to make, albeit a bit time-consuming. I ended up having to throw out over half - they were just too sweet. (Yea, I know, who knew there was such a thing!)"
"6","5","good lord, these things rock. i used milk chocolate cake + chocolate icing w/baker semi-sweet chocolate coating. amazing. so easy too. i def agree that you should let the cake cool completely before mixing with frosting and refrigerate the mixture for a little while before forming into balls. delicious and so pretty, will def try it again with other flavors also!"
"6","5","So easy! Love making these every year! Note: I've found for pretty shape and easier dipping, you've absolutely got to roll the balls by hand and then refrigerate/freeze them for a few hours. This helps their shape be firm and ensures they won't crumble as you dip them."
"6","4","I made these for my gf to take to work for her Christmas Spread, they were a very big hit. Not too hard to make, a little time consuming, but its all good. I made a Red Velvet cake, cream cheese frosting and I 'attempted' to dip them in Vanilla chocolate, but it didn't work out the way I wanted, so I made a chocolate glaze and they were very good! Thanks for a really fun recipe!!!"
"6","2","For the amount of work that goes into these, with the baking, cooling, rolling, cleaning up, dipping, cooling etc etc, I didn't think it was worth it at the end. I made 24 for cookie trays before I just gave up since I was sick of dipping and after tasting one, they're really rich and almost too-rich-i-feel-disgusting-now-that-i-ate-that feeling. I did devil's food with chocolate frosting dipped in chocolate. I'd only suggest these for the 'wow' factor or if you really like waiting for things to cool and dipping into chocolate for an hour or two for something that i'm pretty sure after one bite, my pants size went up. I'll still give them away with my other cookies, but only to the real chocolate lovers."
"6","5","These are delicious! I made them this past weekend and couldn't believe how easy they were! I didn't have any almond bark or confectioners coating so I used a bag of milk chocolate chips and a few squares of 100% cacao bakers chocolate melted together. Adding sprinkles on top definitely helps cover any imperfections that come from the dipping process. I froze some of the balls before I dipped them and found they were way less likely to fall apart doing that. These are so good, although they could use a better name."
"6","5","I found these to be amazingly easy to make! I was daunted by some of the reviews but I did follow advice and freeze the balls overnight before dipping them and that was *perfect*. I actually used Wilton Melts (about a bag and a half) for the coating and it worked splendidly. My 11 year old daughter helped make these and decorate them with contrasting white chocolate. We loved making them and they were a huge hit at the Christmas Party. We can't wait to make more and try other flavor combinations."
"6","4","Hmm, not too hard to make at all! I used a lemon cake and lemon frosting and dipped in milk chocolate. They turned out great! I found the secret to coating them in chocolate........use a plastic fork - and hold the cake ball on the fork and drizzle the chocolate all over the balls. VERY EASY!!"
"6","5","I made the cake as directed on the pkg and baked it on the low side of the degrees they suggested on the box. I cut the cake out of the 9 X 13 pan, leaving a 1/4 inch of the perimeter of the cake since it was dry. The can of frosting was put in right after the cake was scooped out of the pan and there wasn't any problem working the frosting in with a pastry blender. Then waited awhile for it to cool and made small 3/4 inch balls, placed on a cookie sheet on wax paper and refrigerated them for a couple hrs (made approx 55 balls). I used two 1# pkgs of chocolate discs and melted them in a double boiler. Used a slated spoon and tapped the sides of the pan to get the excess chocolate off and then placed the dipped balls on a wax papered lined cookie sheet. They harden right away so it takes another person to shake the sprinkles on top. Halfway through, the chocolate started getting thick so I just reheated it in the double boiler. Also kept the pan of chocolate on the table with the boiling water under it to keep it thin. Had enough chocolate left to mix some rice crispies cereal, raisins and nuts together to make 2 doz min cup candies. The cherry chip cake mix, with the vanilla frosting and chocolate coating is delicious! Tastes like choc covered cherries!"
"6","5","Tastes great! I used a devils food cake mix and cream cheese icing dipped in chocolate bark. I let the cake cool 30 min before breaking up and mixing with the frosting. I used about 3/4 of the tub of frosting. I let the mixture chill over night and then shaped into balls. I froze them about an hour before dipping. TERRIFIC!!!!!!"
"6","3","As others have added, the way I do it is to cool the cake first, refrigerate the 'dough' once you've mixed in the icing then, roll the balls or shapes and freeze for about 1/2 hour. This makes everything go much smoother. I've done chocolate cake/chocolate icing/orange & milk chocolate confectioners coating/fall sprinkles and red velvet cake/cream cheese icing/green and white confectioners coating/Christmas sprinkles."
"6","5","I've made these twice already and got rave reviews both times. They are so easy to make and yet very delicious. Going to make some for our annual 'cookie' exhange."
"6","5","Holy cow, people will FREAK OUT if you make these. My successful cake ball strategy? 1. Crumble the cake, while still warm (not hot!), into a container with a lid. Allow to mostly cool, then pop the lid on it and let it sit overnight. This made the cake super moist, and it was already cooled and crumbled in a bowl when I was ready to mix in the frosting. 2. Make your own frosting. You really don't need much, and it will taste so much better than the canned stuff."
"6","4","When I first made the cake balls and I did not like them at all. The filling was way too sweet and mushy I also found them hard to coat with the chocolate even after chilling. The second time I made them I only used one quarter of the icing called for and I froze them before coating with the chocolate. I also used semi sweet chips with a half a bar of paraffin wax (melt the wax first in a double boiler) This really helped in coating the cake balls because the paraffin really thins out the chocolate. It does take some time to make them, I made the cake balls one day and froze them overnight, then coated them the next day. I will make them again because they are pretty and there are so many combinations."
"6","4","Everyone in my family loved it. Before I could even give my mom and dad some my sister ate a lot of them... I couldn't get the balls to stick together..."
"6","5","I made these for an office birthday party and they were defenitely a hit.They are FANTASTIC!! I used devils food cake mixed with chocolate icing dipped in chocolate almond bark. They were a bit time consuming but shockingly easy. I made my cake in the morning, let it cool about 45 minutes and mixed in the icing. I then made my balls and stuck them in the freezer for about 6 hours. I used the entire pack of almond bark for dipping and about halway through I added pecan bits so half of my cake balls were plain and the other half chocolate pecan. Again, the dipping was suprisingly easy. I kept my pan of cake balls in the freezer and only took out about 10 at a time. I used a fork to dip and then just slipped the ball off with a toothpick. They weren't perfect but they looked pretty darn good! Like so many other reviewers I can't wait to try out other combinations. The common vote amongst my co-workers is give up my normal Christmas goodies and just make several different kinds of these! Thanks so much for sharing!"
"6","3","Definately time consuming to make, and not as easy as they sound, but they taste delicious and are an eye catcher."
"6","1","It tasted and felt like uncooked cake mush in my mouth. I couldn't even finish my first bite."
"6","5","You have to try these with orange cake. It's a hard mix to find, but once you try it you will be hooked. At least that's what I have found. Oh yeah and a tip - start out using only half of a can of icing. Then add sparingly til you get the right consistency. I rarely ever use more than half a can. Helps with the sticky factor because ideally it shouldn't stick to your hands."
"6","5","Great recipe for a crowd. This recipe made about 70 balls. I mixed while cake was still hot, then put in freezer for several hours before scooping. (Used a small #50 ice cream scoop) I used a dark chocolate cake mix and caramel icing then dipped in semi-sweet chocolate. Adding 1 tbsp oil to 1 cup of chocolate makes it easier to dip. Planning ahead is key to making this a very simple recipe."
"6","5","I had these at work and they were DELISH! So I looked for a recipe so I could make my own. There is nothing hard about this recipe at all. I let my cake completely cool, then crumbled it in a large mixing bowl. I added the frosting and went to work with my hand mixer until it was crumbled and mixed. It maybe took me 15-20 mins to roll 36 balls, which I put in the freezer for about 30 mins. I used two wooden skewers to pick up the balls and roll them around in the melted almond bark (thinned with a bit of shortening.) Easy. I would do it again for sure. I made this batch with carrot cake and cream cheese frosting. Heavenly!!"
"6","2","OMGosh. Where did I go wrong?! I really thought this recipe would be good. I used strawberry cake, strawberry icing, and milk chocolate chips (melted) for the coating. The texture kept me from being able to eat a whole one. I might try this one again since reviews are so great and stick to all chocolate...maybe that will help."
"6","5","yes yes yes. Here's the way I've made them, which works pretty well: after baking the cake, let it cool for a little while (fridge speeds this up), then mix with frosting in a bowl using an electric mixer. Chill this mixture (in the fridge or freezer if you're in a hurry). This makes it so much easier to work with. After chilled, form into balls and put balls in freezer for 30 minutes before dipping. This will help them hold their shape when you dip them. I've tried all kinds of cake/frosting combinations, but my favorite is strawberry cake/cream cheese frosting dipped in dark chocolate."
"6","5","These have been the hit of 2009! My fiance' makes them at least twice a month. Usually by request. She has tried a variety of combinations and they were all sinfully good, but I am still a fan of the yellow cake, chocolate frosting, chocolate coating. We have had some issues melting the almond bark but by adding a little hevy whipping cream she was able to make it much more manageable. Try them at your own risk they are addictive."
"6","5","these are so amazing and super straightforward in method. Anyone who says they're too complicated is crazy! Time consuming, yes, but not consecutively. alot of it is just waiting/refrigeration, etc. For someone like me with a toddler who wont let me be for more than a few minutes, I loved that about this! i spread out making them over 2 days, but if i hadn't done them super fancy decorated, i could have made it one day. For my first try, i went all the way and did the cupcake cake-pops from Bakerella.com. I knew not to add all the frosting, but i did anyway, and that became my only mistake. they were WAYY too squishy inside when they were all done, but they still tasted amazing!! I will listen to advice next batch. Alot of the advice given in these reviews is good, but some is not necessary. I agree it was easier to blend the frosting + cake while slightly warm....it wont affect the end result if its mushy while warm. Also, pops/balls do NOT need to be frozen solid before dipping, but it definitely helped having them well chilled. if you do the pops, i highly recommend using Wilton's candy melts instead of real chocolate w/ shortening. I used both, real chocolate for the bottom of the 'cupcake', and red candy melts for the top. the real chocolate never got super hard, and the candy melts taste + look GREAT. way better than the bark at the store. Plus they come in awesome colors! I cant wait to do these again, and try out some new shapes/colors. I brought them to a bake sa"
"6","1","I followed this recipe exactly as stated...the cake balls looked beautiful, but tasted terrible. I was shocked that this recipe received such great reviews...very disappointing."
"6","5","these are the best! Although I use half the frosting amount. I made chocolate chocolate and chocolate and carrot cake cream cheese frosting (my own) and vanilla.  One reviewer was correct about using quality ingredients!!"
"6","4","Definitely follow other's advice and freeze mixture before and after rolling the balls...makes it a lot easier! If they started to warm up a bit, i just stuck them back in the freezer for 5 mins or so.  Here's what I did/used: 1. devil's food cake 2. caramel frosting (duncan hines made it) 3. milk chocolate chips  I baked the cake, waited for about an hour then crumbled with a fork. I added the frosting by spoonfuls and ended up using about 3/4 container of frosting. Next time, I will use less so that they are more 'cakey.' I was tasting the mixture in between spoonfuls of frosting and added more so it would get more of the caramel taste. But I think I would rather have the cake-y texture as opposed to more frosting flavor.  For rolling the balls, I just used my hands! Scooped the mixture out with a spoon and rolled. It is a LITTLE messy. Other reviews on here may it seem like it was SUPER messy. No messier than making certain christmas cookies.   For the chocolate chips, I melted them in the microwave with a teaspoon of vegetable oil for a minute, half bag at a time.  I dipped the balls after they were frozen for about 45 mins-1 hours with a spoon and fork.  The caramel frosting is very sweet. And i LOVE sweets.  I will try them again with different combinations. The strawberry and chocolate ones look really tasty!  I also coated some with just powdered sugar. I would not recommend this if you use 3/4 or more of the container of frosting. They are just too gooey"
"6","1","I was so excited to try this recipe- they sound so good and look so pretty. I did a test-batch because I was planning to make them for a holiday part- so glad I decided to test them first. They are really gooey and overly sweet. I'm going to try petit fours instead."
"6","3","They have potential but I may have made them when the cake was too warm. They got all doughy when I mixed the cake with the icing. I may change this rating if I make them again. I used an orange cake with vanilla frosting. Also, I froze them with toothpicks stuck in so they'd be really easy to dip in the chocolate. Try that.....a great way to dip then the toothpicks come right out when they thaw:)"
"6","4","Great, yummy treat. Here's some tips to make it easier on everyone: Don't think you have to drown the cake in frosting, just add enough to make it like a firm cookie batter, just enough to hold a shape. Chill the frosting/cake mixture for at least an hour before forming the balls. Form balls using a small scoop and then roll; I used latex gloves for this for NO MESS! Then freeze the balls for at least an hour before coating. This keeps crumbs from falling off into the chocolate. Homemade buttercreams probably aren't the best frosting for this recipe, try a homemade frosting that's more like canned frosting, something that gets firm but not hard when you chill it."
"6","4","These tasted great. The first dozen or so that I dipped came out great, but by the end, they started to look a little funky because the dip was filled with cake crumbs. Also, I used 18 oz. of white chocolate, and that barely covered half of them. But i'm sure I will try this again!"
"6","5","This is such a crowd pleaser and no one ever can believe how you made them...the kids love to help. I freeze tehm and dip them as I need them for unexpected company ir for a fast dessert for my family. We have done the german chocolate, a strawberry cake mix and pfrosting with a white almond bark and the cocolate mint with choc. mint frosting and choc.bark. DO THESE THEY ARE GREAT!"
"6","5","If you want to make these, PLAN AHEAD. Due to lack of space, I have been working on two batches gradually over the past few days. For each batch, I made one 8in cake and one batch of cupcakes, which was fine. Tore into them with two forks and mixed in frosting while still hot. I refrigerated the mixes overnight and scooped with a 'cookie scoop,' filling the scoop and scraping the bottom flat before popping the cake out. Dipping is definitely the biggest pain. I made a vanilla almond bark-covered carrot cake w/cream chz icing and a triple chocolate. The almond bark was cheaper than real chocolate for twelve ounces (and it took almost 12 ounces for one cake). I had to thin the almond bark with a little oil, but be careful not to use too much because the cake bites can take on a sweaty appearance at room temp. If you use frozen balls, it makes the process easier because the almond bark hardens almost right away. When I make this again I will continue to use almond bark rather than chocolate chips--I think it compliments the cake better."
"6","5","Oh my, these are SO yummy! I read through 3 pages of reviews before I made this and took all the tips offered, and it was a breeze. Time consuming, but I knew that going into this. I did vanilla cake/vanilla frosting/milk chocolate almond bark with colored sprinkles in with the cake and also on top of hardened chocolate. I actually colored my cake blue and my frosting green and came out with a cool play dough blue shade. My son's bday was Thursday, and because I had a busy few days, I baked the cake on Tuesday and combined it with the frosting when warm, then put it all in the fridge in a bowl with plastic wrap over it....until wednesday afternoon. I then balled them with my melon baller and put them on a waxed cookie sheet (cold cake/frosting taste just like cookie dough, I could have eaten the whole thing). I then froze the balls for about 2 hours. I melted my chocolate with a little oil per recommended and dropped the balls into melted bowl of chocolate 1 at a time and fished it out with a fork. I put them back on the cold cookie sheet and dropped some sprinkles on top...smooth even chocolat. No mess, no frills (and I'm not usually good at these things). I put the choco finished balls in my fridge overnight (wed) and served them chilled on Thursday to my 7 year olds class and they LOVED them! Big hit from kids and teachers alike. I will make this again. One box mix made about 80 balls, but the chocolate almond bark only covered about 65 of them. I can't wait"
"6","5","I LOVED this recipe. I've made white cake with carmel icing and vanilla almond bark and I'm in the proccess of making lemon/lemon/vanilla and strawberry/strawberry/chocolate for our father's day picnic this weekend. I cannot wait to try other variations. I may try to use special chocolate used to make candy next time instead of the almond bark. I can find it in both mint and peanut butter flavors. I followed other's advice and used a small cookie scoop to make the balls. Once they're chilled I rolled them to form them a little better then back to the freezer. Worked great. I also found the almond bark to be a little too thick so I'm going to try to thin it down with shortening next time. The recipe may be a little time consuming but it's soo easy and can be made in stages in advance so it's definitly worth it!"
"6","5","YUMMY!!!!!!  I tried this recipe and it is delicious. I refrigerated them before rolling into balls and used a little olive oil on my hands to prevent sticking. I have tried chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and dipped in chocolate, red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate, white cake with strawberry frosting dipped in chocolate, and white cake with white frosting dipped in chocolate. All are delicious!!!! Great idea for kids------I took blue (or whatever bright color) frosting with white cake them dipped in chocolate and rolled into sprinkles. My son's preschool class LOVED them and his teachers begged for the recipe."
"6","5","I can't believe how tasty and easy, I will be making again and again!! I used yellow cake and chocolate frosting with chocolate coating. I crumbled the cake as soon as it came out of the oven, and mixed the frosting right away, the heat from the cake kind of melted the frosting and made it very easy to mix. Chilled the cake/frosting mixture for about two hours before rolling into balls, didn't have any problems with sticking. I did use about 3 times more chocolate coating than the recipe called for. I will try and thin a little next time to make it go further. I can't wait to play around with different flavors, thanks for a super recipe!!!"
"6","5","Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I have made tons of them since reading it back in November. Some hints... FREEZE before dipping, 24 hours if you can.... use a little crisco in the almond bark to thin it.... and to dip, your best bet is a skewer type object. If you can believe it, I used a small meat thermometer. Worked so well! Just stab em and dip em, then tap off the excess. By the time you do, the cold ball has solidified and is easy to remove from the skewer. One more hint..... MAKE PLENTY!! DELISH!!! A+++"
"6","1","I'm not sure what I'm missing here, but I agree with another reviewer...these just didn't work for me. They were just icky, goopy balls, covered in chocolate. I threw the them all out. I wished I would have just kept the cake as is and frosted it."
"6","5","These were good, my husband ate them all in one night! I made mine from chocolate cake mix and coconut/pecan frosting- Very good! I also refrigderated the mix and powdered my hands with powdered sugar when rolling. I then dipped in real melt semi-sweet chocolate and topped with nuts. I kept these in the freezer to. Will make again"
"5","5","These are insane!  Insane to make so many, recipe goes a long long way!Doesn't cost much! Insane trying to decide what flavor combinations! insane how delicious they are!  Insane how fast they went!  Insane many wanted the recipe and know how!   SUCH a keeper! I made a lot of variety for Christmas...HUGE hit!"
"5","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"5","5","These are awesome for holiday giving. I used Strawberry cake mix and frosting and chocolate coating. You can't stop eating them."
"5","5","I find this recipe makes A LOT of truffle-sized balls; I prefer to make these for larger gatherings or when I know I'll have someone to take the surplus balls out of my house! lol. These are very good though, very simple. Definitely chill mixture when forming the balls, and keep a bowl of cold water for your hands in between rolling the balls. Melting wafers are probably the best way to go with these, too. Great recipe!"
"5","5","I made these cake balls a couple of weeks ago for a 4H meeting and they were a hit. I stuck to the basics for my first attempt (white cake and frosting and almond bark with multicolored sprinkles). I baked the cake and turned it out onto wax paper (it rested 10 min) and let it cool until I could handle it and crumbled it with a fork and my fingers into the mixing bowl. I then slightly heated the canned frosting (about 1/3 of the can) in a bowl until pourable and mixed with my paddle just until combined. I refrigerated one hour and formed the balls by hand. It wasn't sticky, but held together fine. Placed them in the freezer on a tray one hour and melted the almond bark in one of those mini crockpots made for dipping strawberries, etc in coatings. Used the tool that came with the pot and rolled them into the melted coating and placed on wax paper. Immediately after each ball I sprinkled the colored sprinkles). After they were solid, I placed each in a mini muffin paper liner. They were very tasty, not too sweet."
"5","5","This is a great recipe...but I did make some changes...DON'T USE THE WHOLE CONTAINER OF ICING! This will give you a mess! Add 1/2 and mix well. Then add to your desired consistency. We like a little drier ball, like a truffle. I use the almond bark, a little bit of shortning to help with look when dried, and definetly try the Andies baking chips. Just enough mint flavor! Yumm!"
"5","5","Fun recipe!"
"5","5","Made this recipe for Valentines Day, I used red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting and white chocolate. Everyone loved them. I used a lot of the tips given by other reviewers. I used 2/3 of the frosting container and I after forming them into balls with a cookie scoop on a wax paper covered cookie sheet I put them in the freezer for about an hour. That really helped with the chocolate covering process. Definately worth a try..."
"5","5","Made w/Germ choco cake and coconut icing! Yum! Easy! Decoated for Valentines day, a big hit. Will make again w/different combos of icing and cake. Great recipe! Mixed by hand with a spoon in a bowl once the cake had cooled then made the balls, put them in the freezer then dipped."
"5","3","I made these, and thay were fine up until the dipping part. We made them, then froze them for about 45 minutes, then melted the chocolate. The 4 oz. bar only covered 7 cakeballs! I don't know what went wrong, but 3-4 oz. of chocolate is not enough!!!!! we are going to try making some frosting and decorating them, but I think they will be too sweet. I will not be making these again. -Natalie :("
"5","5","Very simple. Very tasty. Just make sure you have enough frosting for that cake so there aren't a lot of cake crumbs. Use too much frosting and it will be too sticky and a bit too sweet."
"5","4","These are an effort to make (dirty dishes, etc)-but always go over well. and you can customize to whatever holiday or event with sprinkles or coloring white chocolate. I had the most trouble with melting white chocolate. I used white chocolate chips--which didn't melt well--I would recommend using the bakers chocolate-white or chocolate. I used white pearl sprinkles and it looked lovely and covered any imperfect areas! I will make these again. I think it's just one of those recipes that gets better with practice. AND I did not have to use the entire can of frosting. I wasted one whole vanilla cake by using a whole can. I found 2/3 is enough to keep it moist and workable. Enjoy!"
"5","4","I made two versions of these. The first was Red Velvet Cake/Cream Cheese Frosting with White Coating topped with Christmas decorations. the second was German Choc. Cake with coconut/pecan frosting dipped in choc. almond bar and then topped with a coconut/pecan blended in my food processor. I thought the second one was better. I agree with the reviewer who had mixed her cake/frosting and then put it in the refrig for a couple of hours. I did the same with my second batch and even after I rolled them, allowed the 'balls' to sit for another hour or two. I think these turned out much better than my first batch. The red velvet batch is just starting to come into their own after one day of settling. I think if I would have followed the process I used for my first batch, they would have turned out better.   An important note though is that the 'insides' are very similiar to a truffle, not dry like a cake, so don't freak out like I did!!  I did like these enough though that they will be standards on my Christmas trays."
"5","4","Easy to follow, I used two bags of the Wilton coating chips per cake mix box and the double boiler melting is the best practice. I also freeze balls before coating. Made snowmen this year."
"5","1","Don't bother with this recipe. A total pain to make - stick with putting the cake batter in the pan and putting frosting on top. I'll never make this recipe again!"
"5","4","I love starbucks birthday cake pop. The closet thing I have found is making the cold oven pound cake from this site with 1 cup of vanilla buttercream frosting mixed in, then dipped in white choc. melts. Better than paying 1.50 for 1."
"5","4","These turned out yummy, made them with Cherry Chip cake mix and vanilla icing and dipped in melted chocolate wafers. Great flavour combination! My hubby didn't like them much, this was our first time having a cake ball/cake pop and we found the texture kinda weird. I kinda got used to it though - because the flavour was awesome. I brought a bunch to work and they absolutely loved them!"
"5","4","Tasted great, but difficult to make, with dipping it in chocolate, they kept coming apart even with the freezing; could be due to me using whipped frosting. Will make again using a different frosting."
"5","5","This was my first attempt and I made 3 batches for a large Thanksgiving get together. The first I used pumpkin bread, cream cheese frosting and white almond bark with a bit of cinnamon mixed in.   The second was red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting and plain white almond bark (then drizzled melted chocolate on top).   The third I used a dark chocolate cake (I added 1/2 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips), cream cheese frosting and melted semi sweet chips (add a little crisco to thin it out).  I couldn't believe how fast they disappeared! The pumpkin were especially a big hit."
"5","4","The cake balls without the chocolate are awesome! I'm having a major issue trying to get the very thick choc on. At the moment my balls are back in the freezer. I've added at least 1/2 cup of skim milk to the chocolate. It's finally running enough, but my balls are soft again. Next time I'll start these a day ahead. Thank you for the great recipe and useful reviews!"
"5","5","Well, the kids loved these. Used vanilla cake with funfetti frosting and chocolate chips as the coating. Super cute idea. I coolled the cake completely and used a tub of frosting- mixed with the beater and stuck in the fridge for a few hours. Once they were cold I rolled them and then froze them. Tasted like cookie dough- they should be called cookie dough balls. :)"
"5","5","I made these with homemade frosting using Rick's Special Buttercream, used less than 1 cup just kept add a tbsp at a time until it came together, using my 1/8 cup measure it made 32 cake balls, I put a popsicle stick in them to make dipping easier, decorated with sprinkles and wrapped in cello."
"5","5","I am only giving this 5 stars because it tastes so good and the different possibilies you can make are endless, HOWEVER, this is a total pain in the butt to make. I will NEVER make this again. Makes a complete mess, and although they are delicious I do not have the patience for this recipe."
"5","5","It was easyer than I thought."
"5","4","I made the recipe as directed, but will use less frosting next time as other suggested. A full can is just way too much"
"5","4","Not being a very seasoned cook I was worried, but these still came out great! The only thing I did differently was once I scooped out the balls I put them in the freezer for 20 minutes which made the balls so much easier to shape. Then I put them back in the freezer to get nice n cold for dipping. Also I took part of the cake and mixed it with peanut butter instead of an icing which were awesome for anyone who loves peanut butter chocolate!"
"5","5","Made red velvet and cream cheese frosting balls for a baby shower and they were a huge hit. It was a last min decision and I am so so glad I found this recipe! You wont regret making them!"
"5","4","Four stars only because I had to change things a bit: let the cake cool completely before crumbling by hand, only use 12 ounces of the frosting, add a tsp. or two of shortening to chocolate coating when melting to thin to the proper dipping consistency. These are so good that the little bit of time it takes to prepare is worth the extra effort. Like other reviewers, I look forward to trying this with other flavor combinations!"
"5","5","I brought these to two different functions and everyone gushed and wanted to talk about them. Be warned, they're VERY sweet!"
"5","5","These are great but I'm having trouble with the chocolate being to thick to dip them.The chocolate on the picture looks perfect. Did any of you thin it with oil or do any of you have any other suggestions. Thanks"
"5","4","Pretty good-super sweet, though. We made Red Velvet w/cream cheese frosting & a german chocolate w/pecan frosting & toasted coconut on top."
"5","5","These were great, perfect for a sweet treat, family loved it. I think the trick is to keep them small, and cool the cake crumbs a bit before adding icing. We also made this recipe replacing our own home make chocolate cake recipe and home make chocolate icing, dipped in melted chocolate chips. This is a very logical, forgiving recipe. You cannot go wrong if you improvise, just make sure to FREEZE THE BALLS ON A COOKIE SHEET before dipping. FOR GIFTS, Package in a round cookie tin, individually placed in decorative muffin papers. LOVE IT!!!!"
"5","5","I was looking for a chocolate/hazelnut recipe when i tried these. I made them with a little (1tsp each of) peanut butter & Nutella in a chocolate cake, then mixed with a blend of chocolate frosting & Nutella. For a coating I used chocolate with a tsp of Nutella & hazelnuts. Adding the Nutella made the candy coating thicker so I needed more. The results were rich, chocolaty, to die for cake balls! Everyone liked them & the size made them perfect for our cookout."
"5","5","Cake balls are very cute and surprisingly very filling. people always love them, and if you look up the Cakepops book, there are several ways you can shape, mold, and decorate the cakeballs to make very festive desserts for any holiday you can imagine"
"5","5","So easy and so tasty! I used white confetti cake mix and white confetti frosting. Since I have no clue what confectioners coating is nor where to even begin to look for almond bark in the grocery store, I melted two cups of white chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of shortening in the microwave and coated the balls. I found it helpful to chill the balls slighlty in the fridge before dipping in the chocolate because they were a bit more firm and easier to handle. I will be making these over and over again, I'm sure!"
"5","5","I made these with red velvet cake, cream cheese icing, and melted white chocolate chips with gel food coloring for the coating. They were a HUGE hit, and people keep asking for more. I will make these again, but I must say that dipping these was a real chore. The skewer method just didn't work, so I was left using two spoons, which resulted in uneven coating. Before I make these again, I think I will purchase the correct equipment for dipping candy."
"5","4","These are to die for! Very rich and yummy! I made 2 kinds for my mom for Mother's day, lemon and strawberry, both with vanilla frosting and vanilla coating. I used one can of frosting split between both cakes and they were still very moist. I refrigerated the mix for a couple hours before making the balls and I also froze them for a couple hours before dipping them. Can't wait to try other combinations!"
"5","5","This were not difficult but were a little time consuming. I baked my cake as directed and let it cool about an hour. I mixed 1/2 can of icing in it, squishing it with my hand until it was really sticking together very well but not too thin.   I refrigerated the dough for an hour and molded small teaspoons of dough into balls forming it much like I do meatballs.   I froze them for 2 hours then dipped them. Well I really poked a toothpick in them held them over the bowl and poured the chocolate over them until they were covered. Dropped them onto the parchment paper and drizzled chocolate over the top to cover the hole.   Oh yeah, I took 25 out of the freezer at a time, once they start to thaw they are a little more difficult to keep on the toothpick while you are covering them.   I used regular chocolate almond bark on yellow cake mix with cream cheese icing.  My family all placed their order for their favorite cake flavors."
"5","4","I used devils food cake and caramel frosting. These are so yummy and a great finger food!"
"5","3","Cake balls are very good, but these are too soft and moist. Use only 3/4 of the can of frosting."
"5","5","I made these on my own without ever seeing this recipe. I used cherry chip cake with vanilla icing and then dipped them in melted chocolate chips for some and dark chocolate for the rest. They were delish. I also have done the Strawberry cake with vanilla icing and dipped in dark chocolate. My husband raved about those. The other ones I made were white cake with mint extract and green food coloring, vanilla icing and dipped in melted chocolate chips. They tasted like Thin Mints from the girl scouts.. These are most definitely addictive!!! But oh so YUMMMY!!!!"
"5","5","These were awesome,but you don't need to use the whole can, I would use 3/4 of the can of frosting. I did it with german chocolate cake and coconut pecan frosting...turned out amazing. I also did white cake and added a box of pistachio pudding and vanilla frosting was really good dipped in white chocolate. Today I am doing devils food with chocolate frosting and I am adding 1 tsp of orange extract to the melted chocolate!!"
"5","1","I made as is...and it was GROSS to much mush in the cake thats why I gave it 1 star!!!!! made again but letting the cake mix cool before crumble then only adding a 1/3 of the frosting...then roll into balls put in freezer for a 1/2 hour then dip in choc..It was GREAT the second time making these! 4 stars once i changed recipe"
"5","3","I'm torn on this one. My experience with these wasn't great. I used German Chocoalte cake and mixed in about half a can of Cream Cheese frosting. I used a scoop to ball them, which went well. I froze them and then went to dip them in the 20 oz of vanilla bark I bought. Well, #1-that wasn't enough vanilla bark if it had actually worked and #2-the bark didn't melt right and started hardening back up instantly, even on low heat. I tried adding a little vegetable oil but to no avail. So, after only covering about 5 cake balls with this messy bark, I pulled out a jar of the new 'glaze' icing and just squeezed it on top of the rest of the cake balls. They're not pretty. And these are way too sweet for my tastes-and gooey. I can see the potential in this recipe and I may be willing to try again if I was happy with the taste. I probably won't put the effort into these again and was wishing I would have just made the cake."
"5","5","These were really good and looked so professional. I used red velvet cake mix with 1/2 can whipped cream cheese icing. Froze for 1 hour before dipping in white almond bark. Give it a try. The flavor possibilities are endless!"
"5","4","My family loved them and thought they were amazing - maybe it was the combination I chose (yellow cake, vanilla frosting, Ghiradelli Double Chocolate coating) but I thought they were just good. Also they take a long time to prepare for what it actually is."
"5","5","These were amazing! I made them twice and the first time they fell apart when I tried to dip them in chocoalte. I found the key to be to FREEZE them before I dip them in chocolate. When I did that, they were prefect!! They are great to take to an event and have a huge 'wow' factor! (Sticks were hard to find. My first catch, I used large wooden coffee stirrers. I did find the real sticks at Michaels) My one box of cake and one can of frosting made 55 cake balls. Maybe they were a bit too small... I used a cookie scoop so they would have a flat base. They were all the same size and I did not get as dirty when I rolled them by hand!"
"5","4","I made these for a Superbowl party and the best reaction went something like this: 'Imagine the most delicious doughnut hole, dipped in the most delicious chocolate, and then kissed by Keebler elves.' That about sums it up. I used spice cake, cream cheese frosting, and dunked in milk chocolate, and then sprinkled the tops with Heath bar crunch bits. I heartily agree with the reviewers who suggested freezing the mixture before attempting to roll/coat, and I also recommend against under-mixing the frosting. I was worried about squishing it all into mush, but that's actually what I needed to aim for, to make the mixture more manageable. Thanks for sharing!"
"5","5","I really don't think these are TOO much work. Obviously you don't want to make these if you are in a hurry, but these are pretty dang easy compared to other fancy dessert options. First - DO NOT add a whole container of frosting to the baked cake crumbles. Start with two tablespoons and then go from there. You want the mixture to be sticky enough to form a ball, but not wet. The balls can be whatever size you want - we made them the size of golf balls so we yielded a smaller amount. Freeze the balls before coating in chocolate. Keep in mind, you don't have to use bars of chocolate. You can use chocolate chips with a small amount of shortening mixed in (about a 1 tablespoon per bag). My favorite is banana cake with chocolate frosting dipped in melted pb chips!"
"5","4","They taste awesome but were a lot of work. I used white cake and vanilla frosting, added green food coloring and peppermint extract. I made the cake, let it cool, and mixed the entire can of frosting -- next time, I'd use half the frosting because it was a very gooey mess. I left that mixture in the fridge over night. When I finally rolled the mixture into balls, they were still a bit gooey-hence using half the frosting next time. I froze the balls for 2 hours, and then dipped them into melted chocolate chips, put on wax paper and back into the fridge to set. They are very good, but very rich. If someone else made them, I'd give them five stars... but I'm not sure it was worth all the time. This recipe would be great for a holiday party (the peppermint and green filling), but I'd like to try some other variations as well."
"5","3","Edible, but not great. For all the work I prefer to make 'real' truffles."
"5","3","These are tasty but also a huge pain in the neck. Super time-consuming for such a simple little treat. I do think the extra time is worth it, I just wish I would have known what I was getting into beforehand. They're fun and tasty, but nothing that is going to blow you away. Definitely freeze the formed balls before dipping, it makes a big difference. I think they are better bite-sized, so I skipped the melon baller and just used a spoon to scoop and rolled them into a ball. To avoid having a flat bottom, I dipped half the ball, let it cool in the fridge, and then dipped the other half. I used Devil's Food Cake and cream cheese frosting and then alternated dipping them in chocolate or white chocolate coating. Next time I think I'll try dipping them in melted peanut butter chips!"
"5","4","I made a batch of these for New Year's Eve. They're easy to do but quite time-consuming and I have a feeling they could be fabulous or horrible, depending on the combination of cake and icing and the proportion of cake to icing. I wouldn't have wanted them any gloppier than the ones I made so I think I'd err on less frosting than more. I made a Betty Crocker chocolate cake and a homemade chocolate frosting to mix in. I froze the mix for about 20 minutes, then made little balls by rolling them by hand, putting the bowl back in the freezer after making about a dozen of them. I found the melon scooper suggested by others didn't work as well. I melted Merckens milk chocolate wafers from the Bulk Barn in a double boiler and used a plastic fork with the two middle tines broken off to scoop them up and dip them in the chocolate before setting them down on wax paper. I found that suggestion on another website and it worked great. These are very pretty and impressive when put into individual wrappers."
"5","3","I did not enjoy dipping/decorating these. I just couldn't get it to look like I hadn't dropped them and let them roll across the kitchen floor! Some other cooks photos look so pretty! I am just not as skilled. Aside from that ---They were hard to manage and sticky to handle even tho I did refrigerate them well. I was also not at all pleased with the texture. Very odd mouth feel. The kids thought they were 'ok', pretty darn ugly, but ok. I wont make again as they are lots of work for a just 'OK' from the kids. Told Hubs he could take them into work (they eat anything there!) and he declined because they tasted/felt funny."
"5","4","Was making a cake like applesauce spice bar for a cookie tray and had the misfortune of having it crumble. I found this recipe, added cream cheese frosting, dipped in white chocolate and decorated. What a lifesaver!!! Thanks so much for sharing."
"5","5","I followed the same tips as many other reviewers, in terms of letting the cake cool a half hour, chilling the mixture for a few hours, and freezing the balls for at least an hour. In fact, we only took out a few at a time to dip. My biggest difficulty was the candy discs melting to a thick consistency. If this happens to you add a good tablespoon of shortening or even vegetable oil and it'll thin right out but still set up nicely."
"5","1","I made these to give as part of cookie plates to friends over the holidays. I have to say I really didn't care for them and neither did those I gifted them to. They tasted all right, but just not as good as we had hoped and not enough to want to make them again. I made strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in milk chocolate, with some dipped in semi-sweet chocolate. They looked pretty but the consistency in your mouth is not what you expect. That and the flavor makes us not care for them."
"5","5","This was my first time ever making these..... I made a homemade peanutbutter cake with buttercream icing, and I must say they are absolutely wonderful!!!! I will be making more of these in the near future! Thank you so much for posting this."
"5","1","What a mess. I should have read the reviews first before I made them. They fell apart in the chocolate and made the biggest mess ever. Wish the recipe would have indicated the refrigeration part. Would have saved the whole batch. Chocolate was ruined and filled with cake parts. Impossible to roll in chocolate with or without the fork. Cake mixture stuck in the melon baller and had to be rolled by hand. MESS!!!!"
"5","5","OMG, the possibilities! For my 1st attempt I stuck with all chocolate combos and they are terrific. Frozen cake balls are the trick. Frozen to roll and frozen to dip. And a full 24 oz of choc almond bark per cake mix box (3 oz per recipe, how is that possible?) I think I will be experimenting with different flavor combos for the next 50 years (if the clogged arteries don't do me in ;)"
"5","4","I have made these several times and have found the easiest way to coat them is to use mini cupcake papers, pipe a small amount of the chocolate coating into the bottom, then use a Mellon baller to fill, and top off with pipping additional coating on the top. Makes it a much easier and quicker process that is very decorative."
"5","4","I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange using fudge cake and frosting, chocolate almond bark, with crushed candy canes on top. My husband and I found them almost too dense and rich (we could only eat one each), but they were a HUGE hit at the party. After reading other reviews, I went with 1/2 tub of frosting per 1 cake mix, and this made for a great consistency. I definitely recommend freezing the balls overnight before doing the chocolate coating. Toward the end of the chocolate-ing, I found that the balls that had thawed started leaving crumbs in the chocolate, which made for a lumpier coating. Having frozen cake was also helpful in that it made the chocolate coating dry faster (so fast we had to hurry to stick the crushed peppermint on them), which allowed me to pack them up quickly when we were finished. I would make these again."
"5","4","PLEASE HELP! I have just attempted this recipe, and there has to be a step i am completely missing because when i order these from my bakery, the cake part inside is actually baked and very light. However, mine are very moist, thick, heavy and gives the appearance that the cake portion was never baked. My cake crumbled beautifully, until i added the frosting...that is when it all turned to moist yuk! Does anyone have any suggestions as to how i can start out with a light fluffy cake ball before dipping them in chocolate? And still end up with a great product? Thanks!"
"5","5","I made vanilla cake w peanut butter frosting, chocolate and chocolate and red velvet w cream cheese. called them 'truffles' and hit the ball off the cover. I didn't vary except I kinda eyeballed the quantities a bit because I used homemade cakes and frostings. When I got them into a light enough mixture I scooped them with a melon baller and then froze them for about 45 minutes before dipping. I used red confectioners choclate for the red velvets and dusted them with coconut, dark chocolate for the dbl chocolate ones and drizzled lines of white chocolate on top and the peanut butter ones I froze and then ground a butterfinger up and dusted it onto a milk chocolate dip. Just awesome. Didn't tell anyone how easy they were, just let them marvel at my culinary wizardry! Thanks - 5 stars. *** I'll put a picture up too, but since there's more than 400, you might not see them, although they are the ones surrounding the turkey cake."
"5","5","Very sweet and very yummy!!!! I didn't have almond bark, or melting candy chocolate but I did have a bag of chocolate chips, I melted them and mixed them with 2T vegetable shortening and it worked out perfectly. Great Recipe!"
"5","5","These are fantastic! I made them with a Funfetti type cake mix and white frosting. I followed several of the instructions (1) remove the exterior cake since it is hard - I used a dark pan which might have caused it to be darker (2) make sure to get the cake really mixed up because big chunks will not form the balls right (3) freeze for a good amount of time so they are hard (4) I had to thin out the almond bark too with shortening because the balls would fall apart in it since it was so thick. They are time consuming since they have several steps but well worth it!"
"5","5","These are delicious! Every year I make them and people go wild! I also swear that I am not going to make them the next year, but I always do. My favorite flavor is strawberry cake and strawberry icing...it is so delicious with vanilla candy coating! These are great to make ahead -- you can freeze them and thaw as needed. You must get a candy dipper -- it makes dipping the cake balls so much easier!!! Enjoy! They are phenomenal!"
"5","2","I hate to be a 'Debbie Downer' but this recipe isn't as great as it sounded. I found that the cake/fosting combo is a bit too mushy (texture) and I really couldn't taste cake or the frosting (some kind of taste combination between the two). Additionally after dipping 1/2 a dozen cake ball into chocolate I ended up tasting more chocolate than cake (for the remaining balls I just dipped the bottom half). The result was edable but after all the extra work of making the cake balls and dipping them in chocolate I'll think I just stick with mini-cupcakes for my finger desserts."
"5","5","This recipe is great and very easy. I let the cake cool about 20 mins before I crumbled it and was able to roll them into balls right then without problems. I stuck each one with a toothpick (with frosting used as a 'glue' on each pick) and then stuck them in the freezer (3hours), this way, no sliding or dropping when dipping in chocolate. Ater the chocolate coating, I sat the finished ball on a fork and slid the toothpick out through the tongs from the bottom and used the toothpick to ever so gently slide the ball onto wax paper. It worked out great and was not difficult nor overly time consuming. I love how you can try this in any flavor combo you can think of. I put about 1/3 cup of Peanut Butter in my whipped chocolate frosting, and it was wonderful."
"5","5","Simple and yummy! The flavor comos and decorating options are limitless!"
"5","1","I thought these were disgusting. If you really love the taste of canned frosting, you may like them, but even so, the texture is nasty. If you aren't the kind of person who will eat canned frosting with a spoon, then don't waste your time making these--it won't be worth it."
"5","5","Oh my goodness.... where have these been all my life!! I made FOUR batches of these over the holidays and EVERY person that had one asked me for the recipe! I'm even going to dye white chocolate grey and use cakeball as ROCKS for my son's dinosaur birthday cake. I would definitely recommend using melting chocolate (as opposed to choc chips) because it just seemed to have a better consistency and was easier to dip. I have not made a combination of cake flavor with icing flavor that wasn't good! YUMMMMMMMMMYYYYYY!!!"
"5","5","at my office, we rotate bringing a birthday cake for the next birthday after ours. I am bringing a cake ball bouquet! I got the idea when I was drying the chocolate coating on the cake balls this week. I was dunking them on the end of a wooden bbq skewer and standing them up in a drinking glass. It looked cute! I am going to use a cute glass or vase with some styrofoam or floral foam in the bottom to 'arrange my flowers' in! For the spring birthday I need to do, dipping fruity flavors in colored white chocolate will look great! :) Thank you for an amazing recipe I use over and over and I wanted to share my idea. Thanks Allison!"
"5","5","Great recipe! I used vanilla cake mix, chocolate frosting, and one bag of semi-sweet choclate chips as coating. I followed the advice of others and let the cake cool for about 30 mins before crumbling and adding the frosting. I then refrigerated the mixture for about 2 hours. It was so easy to roll into balls after that, and then I put the balls into the freezer for about an hour. I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave and mixed them to a nice, smooth consistency. Then I dipped each ball and put them on tin foil because I didn't have wax paper. In my opinion the chocolate chips worked great and they are less expensive than bark. The only thing I will do differently next time is try using 1/2 container or frosting to give it more of a cakey taste and less of a frosting taste. Next time I think I'll make red velvet cake mix with cream cheese frosting - yum! Anyway these taste great, and the cake/frosting selections are endless! Great for parties too, my food never comes out looking 'pretty' but these look great!"
"5","2","I really wanted to like these! I made them for a retirement luncheon at work, and I'm not even going to take them. These are just mushy, soggy blobs of cake dipped in chocolate. They are way too sweet and the texture is just strange. I would've given only 1 star, but the kids did eat them. I wish I had taken the time to read some of the negative reviews first. This recipe is way too much work for mediocre at best) results. Sorry."
"5","4","I've been making a variation on this for a while....what I found to be easier than trying to dip them in chocolate is to buy an inexpensive chocolate mould in the shape of a little peanut butter cup. I bought mine for a couple dollars at the bulk food store. Fill that 2/3 full of melted chocolate, place a semi-frozen cake ball in and push down slightly. Then pop the tray back in the freezer so the chocolate hardens quickly. Then you hold the chocolate part and dip into white chocolate. I dip it twice in the white chocolate because I find once just doesn't cover it nicely. After the second dipping, sprinkle whatever you want on the top. Soooo much easier than trying to dip balls and not drop them/break them, etc."
"5","5","Do NOT make these - they are TOO good!!! :)"
"5","5","I used 3/4 of the can of frosting. Brought these to a work function and they were gone in no time. There are some really good techniques on the Bakerella.com website for a smooth chocolate coating and different decorating ideas. Check it out!"
"5","5","Yummy! I made Bakerella's Easter cake pops out of mine. They were so adorable, but it took my friend and I about 6 hours start to finish! We made two batches - Strawberry with cream cheese frosting, and chocolate with chocolate frosting. Everyone loved them! They were almost too cute to eat!"
"5","4","I know that I am in the minority here but I thought these were not worth it in my opinion. I will not make again. They did look beautiful though. Thanks anyway. UPDATE ~ 4/11/09.. I wound up trying these again b/c I was sooo frustrated they didn't work out the first time. This time I did devils food cake with choc. frosting. This consistency was so much better than the yellow cake with choc. frosting I had previously tried. I dipped this batch in milk chocolate mixed with about 1/4 cup of melted peanut butter. The end result tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup ball. Much better. I will continue to experiment and next time I will only use 1/2- 3/4 of the frosting. If this recipe has failed for you.... don't give up. Keep trying."
"5","5","Wow - I had a field day with this recipe! Cake mixes & frostings BOGO Free, so I was like a scientist experimenting with a new chemistry kit! I will make these forever!! THANKYOU!"
"5","5","My rating is for the idea only. I made my own plain yellow cake reducing the sugar content and my own reduced fat cream cheese frosting. I baked the cake a day ahead and crumbled it the next day. I mixed the frosting in together and rolled into balls. Don't use as much frosting as stated. Use just enough so that the mixture is combined and cookie dough like. I popped them in the freezer overnight and dipped them in dark chocolate not almond bark after. They hardened pretty quick considering my cake balls were frozen. Oh my! I couldn't stop eating them. So good! Must try. I'm making strawberry cake from scratch and home-made cream cheese frosting again with dark chocolate chip next time. Must try!"
"5","5","Great recipe! I froze the balls for an hour after forming them so that they would not melt in the chocolate, and it worked perfectly. Also, instead of using baker's melting chocolate, I just melted half a bag of semisweet chocolate chips and a stick of butter. It hardened up wonderfully."
"5","5","This is a really fun recipe that lets you impress your friends!.. I also like that there are lots of cake/icing/coating possibilities... So, when I make this I make a box of cake and use about half to 3/4 a can of frosting. Here is a tip for this part... If your cake/frosting mix is TOO gooey... you can add a couple of tablespoons of flour. This stiffens it right up.. I roll them into balls at this point.. they should be thick enough to do this. Then I put the balls into a tupperware bowl or some container with a lid and I put them in the freezer for at least an hour. This makes them nice n stiff for dipping. NOW comes the hard part, or the most tedious at least.. If you're using plain chocolate to coat the balls, chocolate chips or whatever, you can melt the chips in a saucepan or double boiler. If you use chocolate you MUST add about a tablespoon or two of shortening.. i.e. crisco. This thins it up and makes for better dipping. If you use almond bark or confectioners chocolate you don't need to add the shortening. Also, if you're using white chocolate remember that you can add flavor extract such as lemon... and you can add food coloring. I dye the white chocolate red for my strawberry cake, then drizzle chocolate over it. Now MY beef is with coating the balls... I can't ever seem to get the dip smooth enough. When I get the balls on the wax paper they look so choppy, not very smooth. I'd like them to look like something store bought.. so if"
"5","5","I was VERY apprehensive about trying this recipe because I saw so many mixed reviews on it, but I finally gave in and I am so glad!!! I used a red velvet cake mix and dipped them in Merckens milk chocolate wafers that I melted. I went to a couple stores and couldn't find the chocolate bark, and just gave up. Merckens is excellent to use! Here is what you need to do to be successful, and I got these tips from all the other reviewers. You need to take 2 days to make these, they are NOT hard, just time consuming. First, make the cake, then cut off the hard edges that won't crumble and blend. Then mix with 3/4 of a can of frosting. The whole can would be too mushy. Then cover the dough and refrigerate for a few hours. I then used a PC small cookie scoop and make balls with them. I then stuck toothpicks in them and put them in the freezer overnight. I dipped them into the melted chocolate the next morning, pulling the toothpick out and just covering the holes. I worked quickly and did two batches of chocolate so the chocolate would stay melted and not get thick. I also didn't want the balls to start melting and the cake to start crumbling into the chocolate. I am not good enough to decorate as well as some cooks did on here, so I just put some chocolate in a plastic bag, snipped the corner, and put more chocolate lines on the finished balls. They really are not sweet and tasted amazing! My neighbors, coworkers, husband, and 3 children all LOVED them!! Thanks for t"
"5","1","I did not care for this recipe. I made them for one of my Christmas Eve dishes and it was more like a MUSH BALL. If you like biting into goo, then this one's for you."
"5","1","I wish i had read all the reviews before waisting two perfectly good cakes! I love to bake and thought this would be a nice treat for my fiance to take to work with him on Christmas day -These may look appealing but once you bite into them they are just no good at all - mush! I followed the instructions but should have known they were a disaster when making balls out of the gooey mess. I had to make something else to send with him! So disappointing and a huge waste of time and good ingredients!"
"5","4","I gave the recipe 4 stars because I think it calls for way too much frosting. I did about 8 batches of these to give as gifts, and after the first batch I cut the frosting right back. My tips: crumbling the cake is easy if you use your hands. If you have a white/yellow/pink cake, leave out the top and edges when crumbling, theyre usually brown and will turn the finished product brown. Eyeball it when adding the frosting. I go for a crumbly mix, because I dont like gooey balls. I use half a can or less. If you use homemade frosting it is more flavorful and you can customize. I keep the finished and decorated balls in the freezer until ready for gift giving, then thaw them. The combinations I've tried are: [Chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, cream cheese frosting, and chocolate frosting,] [white cake colored pink with half buttercream frosting and half strawberry jam - yummy but moist] [lemon cake with lemon or orange frosting,] [carrot cake with spiced crm. cheese frosting][butter pecan cake with coconut caramel rum frosting][chocolate cake with crushed candy canes and mint frosting]"
"5","1","To us it tasted like something a child would mush up in a cup. Stick to making truffles and fudge, and don't waste your time and effort on these little goblins."
"5","5","I totally suck at baking, but these were so easy and delicious to make. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cooling the cake balls before dipping. I froze them for 2 hours and dipped them in Bakers brand dipping chocolate. I also lined my pan with parchment papter so the balls were easy to remove. I was hesitant at first, but it came out great. I had to use 2 containers of the dipping chocolate to cover the whole batch. I will definitely make these again!!!"
"5","5","These are amazing! Here's what I did: 1) Let cake cool completely. 2) Let cake/frosting mixture set in fridge for 1/2 hour. 3) Shaped balls with small ice cream scoop, and let freeze for 3 hours. 4) Put small lollipop (found at WalMart) sticks in each. 5) Dipped in Baker's dipping chocolate, and rolled in coconut/nuts. I used red velvet cake mix and canned cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved them! And they were so easy. Yeah, there was some 'wait' time, but it's not a big deal. Try these!"
"5","5","I have great news about this recipe! It works with brownie mix!!! Just make 2 standard boxes, bake until just between the 'cake-like' and 'fudgey' stage, and proceed. OH WOW!!! These are unbelievably awesome, and I'm already plotting when I can make tham next!"
"5","4","Though I could feel the cream cheese frosting coating my arteries as it went down, it was totally worth it. Only thing I did differently from the recipe was freeze cake balls for about 2 hours before rolling them in the melted chocolate. Used my fingers to roll and it worked fine, but needed more chocolate than the recipe said. Delicious!"
"5","5","Easy, versatile and delicious! Mix and match flavors. A couple of tips....put the mixture in the fridge for a 15 minutes before forming the balls. Once you form the balls, put them on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer for another 15 minutes before coating them. Chilling between makes them easier to work with."
"5","5","OH MY GOSH! These are soooo! good. Will diffently be making again and again....{9-15-08}I needed to up date this. I made the 'peanut butter frosting' on this site{very good, used 2c's powdered sugar} Let the cake cool a little while thou, then add the 'pbf'.Tastes in a way like peanut butter cups.But I think the can frosting works better. I made the mice for work. Used sliced almonds for the ears."
"5","5","I followed other people's suggestions and only added 1/2 the can of frosting. After forming the cake balls, I froze them for 3-4 hours. I used an entire bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the outer shell, but I don't think I used enough shortening to thin the mixture (3 tsp). The shell hardened fine, but it turned out rather thick and I ran out. Anyway, I used chocolate cake mix with cream cheese frosting. I called them little balls of chocolate death, they tasted so good! I took them to a potluck and received rave reviews. The cake texture turned out similar to a truffle. If you don't like truffles, you won't like these. Make sure to drizzle an opposing color on top of the balls to make them look really nice. I used white chocolate. These things wound up looking and tasting like I bought them from a candy shop."
"5","1","I am sorry to say, I did not care for this recipe. As one other person said they are mushy, sweet blobs. The texture was a paste. I used strawberry cake and buttercream icing. I think maybe there's too much frosting? I was really hoping these would turn out for me. But, I just don't like the texture. Neither did my husband. It tasted like soggy cake with chocolate on top. I followed all of the directions right too. I even let the cake cool for about an hour."
"5","1","I did not like these at all! They taste just like a cake mix and premade frosting. If you are into that, you might like it, but I guess I thought it was supposed to be a sneaky way to make little holiday treats that tasted homemade. These do not."
"5","2","I made these for a tea party for young children. If you like boxed cake mixes and canned frosting you might like these. I used only half of the frosting so they wouldn't be too sweet. The mixture was quite soft but formed nice balls. I froze them before dipping in Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site. The glaze is the only thing that made them somewhat palatable to me but the 3 year olds seemed to like them."
"5","5","I really liked this recipe... after I formed the balls I stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes so that it was easier to coat them... also the amount of almond bark listed was not enough to cover all of the cake balls... so I rolled the extras in powered sugar and shook off the extra sugar afterwards... my daughter and I liked those even better!! I will be making these again!"
"5","5","i made this for christmas.was very easy. i used orange cake mix and vanilla icing and vanilla almond bark.i found it very easy and no mess if you use a cookie scooper,you get perfectly shaped balls with no fuss.this yeilded 85 cakeballs. i drizzled them with blue.i also took other reviewers adivice and froze them for one hour."
"5","5","I wasn't crazy about them buy my husband loves them. He said it reminds him of a bite size brownie (I used chocolate w/chocolate icing) only better."
"5","5","I have made these twice since I have found this recipe. I have made:  Chocolate fudge cake/chocolate fudge frosting/peanut butter chips with chocolate coating with a peanut butter chip swirl on top. Chocolate fudge cake/chocolate fudge frosting/chopped andes mints/with chocolate coating with a chocolate mint swirl on top. Coconut cake/coconut frosting with chocolate coating and dusted with powdered sugar. And finally a carrot cake/cream cheese frosting with vanilla coating and dusted with nutmeg.  These have had rave reviews from everyone who has tried them. I was told I should sell them. Thank you to the person who posted this recipe. I have frozen them before hand, makes it a heck of a lot easier, and they are WONDERFUL frozen! :)"
"5","5","Hi..I made these about 4 times in 2 days..for treats to take to school for Valentine's day! YUM! I however changed the chocolate dip. I used one small 1' x 2' block of parathon wax and 1 1/2 cups choc. chips..melted in double broiler. Worked well. I also used a scoop to form into balls. Helpful hints from others (thank u) to freez mixture THEN form into balls worked well too! Great recipe. Thank You! Neighbour2"
"5","4","I made them with funfetti cake mix and frosting. The sprinkles in the cake mix made it really fun and pretty. I also put some sprinkles on the outside before the chocolate solidified. I got much more than 36 cake balls out of the recipe. I found that I needed more chocolate than the recipe called for, and that it was difficult to try to dip the balls in the chocolate using a toothpick. Next time I'll use two forks to dip the balls in chocolate to make it easier. They were a hit everywhere I took them. I'll be making them again."
"5","5","I've made this recipe twice now. Once with a Carrot Cake mix & cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate. (I also added walnuts, raisins & coconut to the batter before baking the cake) I originally didn't rate them very highly, but I must admit that they grew on me. The second batch I made with a Butter Pecan mix & Carmel Coconut frosting. I dipped the balls in chocolate and sprinkled some with chopped pecans and some with coconut flakes. Wow! They're really delicious."
"5","5","These I really had my doubts about. But they taste really good. I used Dark chocolate fudge cake and pecan coconut frosting. dipped in Giradellie chocolate, and than sprinkled with nuts. I rolled the balls, froze them covered over night, and dipped them the next day. No cake in my chocolate, and they taste really good"
"5","5","These are great! My kids loved crumbling up the newly made cake. I tried rolling the first few by hand and that was a huge mess. I solved the problem by whiping out my Pampered Chef cookie scoop (like a mini-ice cream scoop) and that worked like a charm- perfect shapes and no mess. I also used an egg separator as suggested by another reviewer to dunk them in the chocolate."
"5","4","These were good, try making them red velvet with cream cheese icing dipped in green candy melts for xmas."
"5","5","I tried cake balls while visiting family in Nebraka. the lady who made them would not give me the recipe. Well... This is it!!! These are fabulous. I froze them for about an hour before dipping. I also added about 1 TBSP of shortning to the dipping chocolate. I did carrot cake and stirred in cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate. YUMMY!"
"5","5","My husband and I decided these should be called cake holes because they are kind of like donut holes-just more moist. Very messy to roll into balls and then still difficult to dip even after their stay in the refrigerator. Instead of taking the time to dip, I left them on the cookie sheet and drizzled a good amount of the chocolate coating on top, let them harden a bit, flipped them over and drizzled with more coating. I think this saved me a good amount of time, though they probably don't look quite as nice."
"5","4","These are really good. I did the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate almond bark and it was great. Like others, I think there are other flavor combos that will be even better. I froze the balls before I dipped them and that makes it easy. Also, that must be a typo about the amt. of almond bark...I used a whole package and I think it was a pound and a half! Very good and different..."
"5","5","hugee hit~ will make again. probably try different flavors. oooh exciting. i followed the other advice and placed the balls in the fridge for an hour. came out perfect~"
"5","5","These are so unique and very good! I like the versatility of this recipe. I added some finely chopped pecans."
"4","5","Big success no matter cake mix or frosting flavor."
"4","5","My girlfriend and her daughter love making these and they are very popular around the house. One trick they did is follow the instructions all the way but instead of wax paper, go to your local hobby store and buy a styrofoam pad and some thicker sticks, almost like the tootsie pop ones. After you dip the ball, place the stick on the styrofoam and your ball shape will remain perfect. This is good if you like to decorate the balls after for Halloween or other B-day events."
"4","4","These were well liked at my party despite looking a bit messy, though I can see why some on here didn't like them. You have to like canned frosting to like these (which I do) because that flavor comes through.  Following the advice of others and avoiding these from being mush, I used only a half can of frosting in each of my two batches (red velvet & funfetti) and I recommend doing this, as I liked the texture & wouldn't want them softer. I followed the advice to let the cakes cool at least 30 minutes, and then refrigerated the mixed cake/frosting overnight. After making balls, I placed in freezer for an hour, and they could have even went longer.  I tried making my own coating out of white chips & crisco and chocolate chips & crisco. It was thicker than bark & I had to double it & use 6oz of melted chips. Most of my balls also were not completely covered, rather they had globs of hard coating and were not very pretty. They tasted good, but not outstanding. For the effort I had to put in and how sloppy they looked, I won't be making these again. Much easier recipes out there that taste just as good and look better!"
"4","5","Used Duncan Hines Red Velvet cake and Pillsbury whipped cr cheese frosting. (not very cr cheese taste - didn't have time to make my own though) Let cake cool completely then processed a little at a time in a food processor - pulsing only about 5 times per batch. Only had to use 3/4 can of frosting. Didn't want them to be mushy as other reviews stated. If it starts crumbling when rolling into balls - try washing your hands. Little bits sticking to my hands seemed to make them not want to hold together. Refrigerated till chilled. Dipped in Wilton white bark pieces. For a garnish I took the same bark pieces and pulsed in the food processor and made them into tiny little flake pieces. Let the dipped cake balls harden just slightly then sprinkled on top. So pretty! My daughter is having a 'Brave' themed b-day party and wanted to work something red into a dessert because the main character has bright red hair. Worked perfect! : )"
"4","4","Fabulous. Brought them to a party and everyone was so surprised. The problem I had was that the chocolate was not NEAR enough to cover all the cake balls. I had to coat 1/2 of them in powdered sugar."
"4","4","Great recipe!! The first time I made this, the result was Devils Food cake mixed with 1/2 a can of chocolate raspberry frosting and dipped it in white chocolate (with a bit of shortening in it).   That was a bit too sweet for me though, so the next round was Devils food cake mixed with about 1/2 cup of very strong coffee and dipped in semi-sweet chocolate. The result was similar to a very rich and tasty truffle! Absolutely delicious!!   Note: In both instances, I had to pop the cake/frosting or cake/coffee mix into the freezer for an hour so I could form the cake balls easily."
"4","4","My new obsession... Cake pops. So freaking yummy and fun. I used almost a whole package of the almond bark for a batch. I found that the red velvet cake mix was much more moist than the yellow butter cake I did. With the red velvet cake, I used only about a half cup of frosting. The yellow butter cake was my fave so far, used vanilla frosting and milk chocolate to dip. Can't wait to try other flavor combos like choc. mint or carrot cake. Also, decorating is fun, we are going to do Wrestlemania themed cake balls next month"
"4","5","Love these. I made my own cake and frosting from scratch, and dipped them using a plastic fork with the 2 middle 'teeth' broken off. I let my sons help decorate with sprinkles. Fun and delicious. I'll make them again and again, cant wait to experiment with different flavors/colors/decorations. :)"
"4","4","I used amaretto liquor with yellow cake and dipped it in chocolate. It tasted good but the time to dip and mess with toothpicks stuck in each and then I stuck those in a big piece of styrofoam so the would be nicely formed was just too much work."
"4","5","I made them for the first time. They were fun and easy to made. I used the Wilton candy melts to coat them and they worked well. Also, I froze the cake balls before I dipped them and that helped. I'm excited about trying different cake mixes and getting creative with them!"
"4","4","Four stars because they seem to be well liked by others. Not me, too sweet, too messy and I agree with those that said just make cup cakes."
"4","5","I'm not a huge fan of frosting, so I personally give these about 3 stars but everyone I gave them to thought they were amazing so that's why I'm giving them 5 stars. I gave them as christmas gifts in tins and they looked great and everyone thought I put a lot more work into them than I did. :) I made the following combos: strawberry/strawberry frosting, red velvet/cream cheese frosting, devil's food/chocolate frosting, chocolate/chocolate frosting & peanut butter, french vanilla/vanilla frosting and crushed oreos. I found that covering them in bark coating was MUCH easier than melted chocolate and I froze them overnight before coating to keep them from falling apart. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"4","5","watch out for your waist, really good"
"4","4","These are time consuming to make. You bake the cake, wait to cool, spend time rolling the balls, then refridgerating/freezing, and finally decorating. Make sure you have the time. Other than that, they are fantastic! I suggest using a melon baller to shape, that will save some time."
"4","3","Not a huge fan of cake balls. I think they are fun to add to a dessert tray and others seem to really enjoy them. I would prefer to have a 'regular' piece of cake with the frosting on top rather than mixed in."
"4","1","I followed the direction and read many of the user reviews and still had an awful result. I used red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting (2/3 can) for the balls and dipped them in white chocolate candy coating. I ditched the hard sides of the cake, mixed the frosting in when the cake was almost cooled, made the balls with a melon abller, froze them over night and dipped the next day. The balls were not perfectly round, even when using the melon baller (this was my 2nd attempt at these!) - lumpy and bumpy. After dipping they still looked lumpy and the coating didn't seem to cover the cake evenly. I used toothpicks and found they left large, unattractive holes in cake balls. I think you definitely need to use sprinkles or more candy to cover the top of the balls and hide imperfections. Like I  said, this was my 2nd attempt at this receipe both times resulted in hideous balls that were way too sweet. These were meant to be gifts for Christmas but they are too ugly & sweet to give. Do yourself a favor and just make something else."
"4","5","I used a variety of combinations, these are very good just very time consuming. Takes longer than it says."
"4","3","This recipe was just ok to me. The process of dipping the balls was extreemly messy, time consuming and in the end the flavor was just ok. I used chocolate fudge cake and peppermint frosting and dipped in both chocolate and vanilla almond bark. I am glad others have had such amazing success, but this recipe was just not for me."
"4","5","The kids went nuts over these."
"4","4","These are good with a few changes. Only use 1/2 to 3/4 of the container of frosting. After rolling into balls, FREEZE them overnight. This will make dipping them much easier. Also, I use candy melts rather than an almond bark or something like that."
"4","4","This recipe is not for beginners. It takes quite a bit of time to figure out what works best to get the right results. Came out great, once we figured it out and they are delicious! We colored our cake batter to make it more festive for Thanksgiving."
"4","4","Delicious! Very messy to eat."
"4","5","Inexpensive, easy and delicious ... Need I say more?"
"4","5","I used about 1/2 can of frosting and they were delicious!! My sons are already asking for more."
"4","2","Sorry but this just didn't work for me. The almond coating didn't coat very well and where I poked the toothpick in, cake ball poofed out through the coating. I followed the recipe as directed and then with some of the tweaks, but, oh well! I'm glad that most others had better luck!"
"4","4","Great Idea... Made my own buttercream frosting instead, not a fan of canned frosting. Had this recipe called for making your own, I would have given it 5 stars. Overall, very fun and creative!"
"4","1","I really, really, really disliked these. Horrible texture. Difficult to work with. That slight 'off taste' you get with boxed cake mixes is condensed down to an almost chemical taste. Unpalatable."
"4","5","AHHHHMAZING!"
"4","5","With all the cakes I make, I have lots of leveled off cake tops, scraps from carving out shapes etc. and I hate having to throw them away...what a waste! But what else could they be used for, right? CAKE BALLS! Problem solved.  I added chopped walnuts, chocolate chips and caramel syrup instead of the icing. MMM-AZING!"
"4","5","Yes, there are 1600 other reviews all saying the same thing, but I have to add mine as well - these cake balls are amazing! I made them yesterday for a BBQ and everyone RAVED and RAVED. I ate way more than I should. :) You can play around with the flavor combos of cake mix/icing/chocolate frosting. My suggestions (as others here have suggested as well): form the cake balls and freeze first, so that they will be easier to dip. You can use plain ole chocolate chips for the outer layer; I melted the chocolate in the microwave (I used a defrost setting ans stirred after every 30-60 sec). If it's warm out, it's a good idea to then stick them back in the fridge for a few minutes to harden before serving. Again - these were AMAZING and may end up being my Christmas gifts this year! They are a little bit time consuming though, but definitely worth it."
"4","5","THESE ARE GREAT! you can stick stick in them to make cake pops. I made for Christmas.... RED VELVET CAKE and CREAM CHEESE FROSTING. DIpped in white or chocolate bark.... so amazing and red for CHristmas."
"4","5","What a huge hit!!! They were a little time consuming bu oh so worth it. I made mine into cake 'pops' (put them on sucker sticks and then dipped them) worked like a charm. But yes after you 'ball' them up chill them in fridge ad then dip stick into coating and let the stick firm up in place. Then holding the stick dip away. I then put the stick in floral foam (with the pop up, till they set) they are then perfect balls. Before they set completely I add some sprinkles oh so pretty. Some of the flavos I used. Carmel with carmel frosting covered in chocoate with pecan, chocolate and toffe sprinkles. Drk chocolate cake with mint flavoring added, choc. frosting dark cho coating, with mint sprinkles, these were the all time favorite!!!!!!!!!!! Many other flavors also These were all made for a bake sale and needless to say they were a sell out!!!!"
"4","4","These were a hit at my end o the year summer BBQ! I followed the tips from some of the other reviews and let the cake cool before crumbling. Also, a half can of frosting was definitely enough, you might want to even add less if you want a more cake like texture. I used chocolate coating instead of bars but next time I think I'll use semisweet chocolate to offset the sweetness of the cake and frosting mixture.   Oh and I like mine frozen! Just store them in a ziploc or tupperware. it's also nice to have a cool summer treat on hand for when friends come over."
"4","5","I made this with yellow cake, chocolate frosting, and instead of the chocolate coating in the recipe I made my own chocolate ganache and it turned out to die for. I made it for a friend's birthday, and she is normally a very picky eater but they were gobbled up so fast by everyone at the party. Instead of sprinkles, I dusted with powdered sugar and threw around some sliced strawberrys for a beautiful presentation. Very easy, and very delicious."
"4","5","They were easy to make and the presentation is beautiful. I used white cake and lemon icing, coated them with white choclate melted with some yellow food coloring. They were the hit of the cookie exchange party."
"4","5","Great recipe and easy! I used white cake with cherry frosting. I thinned my almond bark coating with some vegatable oil and it wasn't too think to rolls the balls in. I agree on getting them nice and frozen before even thinking about dipping them in the chocolate."
"4","3","im sure these are yummy...im just not cordinated enough to make them...they turned out horrible."
"4","5","Received rave reviews. I used devil's food cake and vanilla frosting. Dipped in milk chocolate."
"4","5","O M G! SO GOOD! I made these and sent some to work for my husbands assistant. Shortly after, I get an email telling me I am a genius! I have made these so many times and EVERYONE raves over them. I use chocolate fudge cake, with 3/4 can whipped cream cheese frosting. I do trim off the cruncy edges. Roll and dip in semi sweet chocolate. I also tried strawberry with cream cheese and white chocolate and semi sweet chocolate. Didn't care for that combo as much. I am constantly getting requests to make these. especially from my husband who I fear need to go to CBA (cake ball anonymous). Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!"
"4","2","Well, I just dont understand why anyone likes these. I admit they look pretty and its a creative idea, but these were incredibly gross. Its kind of like eating really sweet artificial flavored cookie dough with extra sugar. I used strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting and white chocolate coating. Maybe the chocolate would taste better but this was sooooo sweet and sogy, that I will never eat them. These also took forever to make. You have to freeze the mixture just to roll them nice and round. Then you have to freeze them again just to coat them and they thawed out so fast that by the time I got 1/4 of the way though them they were just melting in my chocolate. I was going to make them for my daughters dance class valentines party, but I have changed my mind..."
"4","4","I gave this recipe 4 stars because I personally would only give it a 2 or 3 while everyone who ate them gave them would give it a 5. It was a very easy recipe to make (though I definitely needed WAY more chocolate for dipping then stated) but I think it was one of those situations where making it puts you off eating it forever. The mixture of the cake and frosting is just sooo unappetizing and wet! That said, they were beautiful when finished and everyone loved them, especially my little sisters. If I were to make them again I think I would put in less frosting to hopefully get a more cake-like consistency."
"4","5","Excellent way to use up leftover cake!! Any time I make a cake that requires me to sculpt or shave off portions of cake, I'll make these cakes balls with the leftovers."
"4","3","These were easy to make and not time consuming at all. I used a TBSP and scooped out the 'dough' and placed them on parchment paper. I didn't worry about shaping into balls at that time. By the time I was finished, the dough was all cooled off and I went back and rolled each ball between my hands to make them smooth and round. Very easy and not too messy. My 3 & 5 year old enjoyed putting the sprinkles on after I coated them in chocolate. They liked the cake balls, but I just thought they were okay. Not a fabulous dessert. Since Valentine's Day is near, I used Red Velvet cake and Cream Cheese frosting and covered them in white chocolate."
"4","5","Ok, I made these for Christmas and a January Birthday this year and I just can't believe how easy they are! I had so much fun deciding what flavors to put together. So far the best by far was Baileys Irish Cream cake and white choc...YUM!!But I have to make one very big comment here, I DO NOT understand how this recipe says it yields 3 dozen servings from 1 cake mix? When rolling 1 to 1 1/2 inch balls that would leave half the mix in the bowl. Without fail, I got anywhere from 52 to 65 balls with every batch. These should be no bigger than a truffle. Using a melon baller is simple. It rolls the perfect amount, even a little over and you still will get more balls than 30 every time, I guarantee it!"
"4","3","My children give this a 5 star rating! Most adults commented that it's just too sweet of a treat. As the one who followed this recipe and made these cake balls, I can tell you that it was a very messy undertaking. I followed the suggestions of fellow reviewers, but even so, it was a mess. I'll stick to fudge and truffles from now on!"
"4","1","After reading many reviews and tips I thought this would be a piece of cake ; ) was I wrong...the cake and frosting mixture had no flavor and dipping the balls in chocolate is not that easy if you never done it before but after a few misses I got down. I started the day attemping to make two types of balls, I started with red velvet and cream cheese combo, red cake started to crumble into the white chocolate dip even after freezing it for a few hours and the taste was just not what I was expeting. Never finished the choc/choc balls..they are still in the freezer"
"4","3","Not bad, but you epect more from sweets. They look good, but the Easy Oreo Truffles require less work, look almost exactly the same, and taste much better."
"4","5","These turned out great. I did freeze the balls before dipping them in chocolate. I would recommend refrigerating them instead as the chocolate cracked quite a bit after dipping the frozen ones. These were delicious and everyone loved them."
"4","3","Do not use the whole can of frosting! I only used a few scoops until the cake stuck together. Otherwise it will be too mushy and way too sweet. They were delicious though.... everyone loved them and even asked me for the recipe!"
"4","1","Did not like these at all. I would recommend freezing them overnight which certainly helped in dipping them in the confectionery coating. I did not care for the gooey cake part at all. Not worth the time and the effort."
"4","5","Am i the only one having trouble dipping the balls into the melted chocolate. I've tried them chilled, or frozen, but still having trouble. Any tips?"
"4","5","Use magic shell by smuckers . It is less messier and sooo much easier! Remember to freeze the mixture prior to applying the magic shell."
"4","5","These are great and everyone wants the recipe! It also makes a lot. To save time I cooked the cake in my Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker in the microwave for 10 minutes. It turns out perfect! I also did an AWESOME variation of gingerbread cake mix and a jar of lemon curd instead of frosting. I used the vanilla bark on this. SOOOOO GOOD! www.pamperedchef.biz/carriemiller"
"4","5","These were highly addictive. My husband couldn't stop eating them. I used German chocolate cake and pecan frosting. I dipped half in German chocolate and the other half in white chocolate then topped with coconut. Next time I will cook my cake a bit longer than I normally would so the cake isn't too moist as this time, my cake was moist and I thought it make the cake balls too soft. Also, refrigerating over night would probably help as well. I found the balls rather hard to dip. Some one suggested using a metal egg dipper used for dying Easter eggs and I think that is a great idea. Very good. These were a hit."
"4","5","These came out awesome. I had a hard time figuring out the dipping chocolate though. I ended up using 1 cup of regular chocolate and 1 stick of butter, which made this awesome hard glaze, it worked out very nicely. I did red velvet cake, vanilla frosting and milk chocolate coating, it tasted exactly like a swiss cake roll, AWESOME!"
"4","5","I made 2 kinds, Chocolate with chocolate frosting and strawberry with sweetened cream cheese. I used candy coating to dip them. After making the balls i stuck a toothpick in each one and froze for about 30 mins each. This worked great and I had no problems with the balls falling apart. Merry Christmas!"
"4","4","Through trial and error I finally figured out why my cake balls were too 'mushy'. I used the 16 ounces of frosting as directed, but honestly I wanted a more 'cake' like taste so I used about half. DO not warm up the frosting and put it in your cake. DO not pour into a warm cake. Let the cake cool completely. Place your balls into the freezer for a while (this makes dipping easier). It is time consuming, but well worth it!"
"4","5","This is a great recipe to have fun and enjoy baking with your kids. Its easy to do and they taste delicious. I found its easier to dip if you melt your chips in a small crockpot or warmer it keeps it melted but not too hot. Use toothpicks inserted into the balls before freezing then stick into styrofoam to dry. They look amazing!"
"4","1","Too sweet and it didnt turn out right. Very disappointed."
"4","5","Awesome recipe! Yes, it does take some time, but it is well worth it! I read many of the reviews before attempting this recipe and mine came out perfect! I used devils food cake, white frosting, and then stirred in some chopped maraschino cherries. I let the mixture sit in the refridgerator for about an hour to set, then used a small ice cream schoop to make the balls. I froze the balls over night on a foil lined baking sheet(s). Then dipped them into a chocolate coating of 3/4 a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 tbsp of shortening. I decorated mine with some holiday non-perils and white chocolate drizzle! So excited to make other combinations!!"
"4","5","I remembered trying this recipe a few years ago and people enjoying it, so I thought I'd re-try it this year. I did a butter yellow cake with cream cheese frosting and it wad delicious. One of the biggest hits I made this year with family and friends. I love how simple yet decadent this tastes. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"4","5","Made again yesterday using fudge brownie mix with 3 eggs (cake-like brownies). Discarded the hard edges, used 1/2 can of chocolate frosting and dipped in dark chocolate melts. They are a heavier consistency/texture than the cake mix and taste awesome!!"
"4","1","The texture is just weird. Mine didn't turn out good at all. Won't do this again."
"4","3","These were OK.... I really didn't like them but did get some compliments on them when I gave them to friends for the holidays. I just didn't like the texture/consistancy of the cake under the chocl. Kind of mushy...."
"4","4","These are fool proof! I don't bake much and wanted to make something other than traditional cookies for the holidays. The recipe is easy to follow and simple ingrediants. But I think I'll take others advise and refrigerate the cake/frosting before coating...the cake is too moist if you try and coat immediatley after baking....."
"4","5","These are marvelous!!"
"4","5","Last year, I added this recipe to the assorted Christmas treats I give out every year. They were a huge hit!! Obviously, I kept them on the list for this year. But, I tried a new trick that made them much easier. The first year, I noticed that the cake bite portion seemed to fall apart when I tried to dip or cover it in chocolate. This year, I did a few things to combat that: 1 - I did not use the entire cake mixed with the frosting, which increased my frosting/cake ratio. 2 - I used a silicon mold to make the 'bites'. I formed the cake part into little squares. Then, I filled each mold about half full of chocolate, put in the cake piece, and then filled the rest with chocolate. They came out a lot more uniformly and I didn't have to worry about them falling apart. I am so excited about this recipe! It's a huge hit. This year, I will also be trying out some new decoration ideas."
"4","4","I think that this is one of those recipes that you have to just keep going and experimenting with what works for you. I read many reviews before making these and decided to try using toothpicks to dip the balls. This did not work for me. They either fell into the coating, or were stuck on the toothpick and were too hard for me to get off without ruining the coating. I ended up placing the balls on a fork and pouring the coating over, then tapping a little before placing on parchment paper to harden. One tip I did use was to freeze the balls prior to dipping. This really helped the coating adhere to the balls and set up quickly. I opted to make an all vanilla ball and did not have any problems actually forming the balls (I did let the cake mixture refrigerate first). Mine also needed a little 'cleaning up' after the coating hardened to eliminate some rough edges. I have to admit that when I first started dipping, I almost quit and decided these weren't worth the effort. But my kids said they didn't care what they looked like and wanted me to finish. In the end, they did turn out looking okay and my kids do love them. I, on the other hand, would much rather just have homemade cake with homemade frosting."
"4","5","i made these with a brownie mix because i didnt have a chocolate cake mix in the cupboard. i added an extra egg to make the brownies cake-like. it was fabulous!"
"4","5","These are truly addictive! The only thing I did differently was to let the cake mix/frosting mixture cool prior to rolling into balls for dipping....otherwise it is a sticky mess and they do slip off the toothpicks. I like to mix chocolate cake and chocolate frosting then dip in vanilla almond bark. And then I like to take white cake and mix with vanilla frosting to be dipped in milk chocolate almond bark. Sprinkles and such are fun decor for the holidays."
"4","4","My friend is a caterer and she makes these for many of her events. They are sinfully delicious. She also uses the candy melt 'chocolate' wafers in different colors as well."
"4","5","I cannot believe how amazing these are! (I wish mine looked as pretty as some of the pictures!) I made my own homemade butter cream frosting and I may have added just a little too much because mine didn't set up properly, but I am for sure making again and will be sure to add the right amount of frosting. I can't wait to make again!! SOOOOO YUMMY!!!!!!!"
"4","5","I have made these soooo many times in different variations and everyone just LOVES them! They are always a huge hit, and can be decorated up for any season."
"4","5","I read most of the reviews before I started. I let my cake cook for about 30 minutes. Next I placed the crumbled cake into a large bowl and used 1/2 of a container of icing. Then I mixed it using my kitchen aid mixer, rolled the balls (by hand) and placed them in the freezer for several hrs. I melted chocolate bark and dipped the frozen balls. I used a strawberry cake mix and strawberry icing. The results were great. They tasted like dipped strawberies. Thank you for the recipe! I can't wait to try other combinations."
"4","4","Hard to make, but good!"
"4","5","Some friends and I made the Bakerella (bakerella.com) version of cake balls which is the same idea except you coat the outside with candy melts."
"4","5","This is a great recipe, I made it with a normal chocolate cake mix and I mixed in I mixed in mini chocolate chips. , and used a fudge frosting... I mixed in mini chocolate chips. Next time I plan on using red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting."
"4","5","I followed LEXI70's instructions and they came out perfectlly. I would sugest, dont use the whole frosting bowl it will overpower the mix. Use like 1/2 and you should be fine"
"4","4","Just made these according to the instructions using red velvet cake mix and candiquik (European Style Candy Coating)~Do not recommend this chocolate! Switched and melted down semi-sweet chocolate chips~went better but still would not recommend. It is essential that you use the right kind of chocolate! I mixed the frosting in right after crumbling the cake and then refrigerated while I melted down the chocolate. Rolled the balls and directly put them into the melted chocolate...then put some in the freezer and put them into the melted choc. mixture~saw no difference in the outcome. Refrigerated before eating. They are delicious~not so pretty but I'll find the right chocolate and perfect that the next time I make them! :)"
"4","3","Flavor was good but not worth the effort. I could not get a nice formed and coated ball. Tried using a fork, tongs, and toothpicks. They all came out pretty ugly and I was too embarrassed to share them."
"4","5","My coworkers LOVED them! Very rich and decadent. Highly recommend cooling the cake after it bakes for a half hour, then add icing. Also recommend freezing the balls for a good hour or so, makes dipping in the chocolate so easy and it hardens faster."
"4","5","I have made this every Christmas the last several years and it is everyone's favorite out of all the candy that I make! I do have a few tips: 1. I use a small cookie scoop to scoop out the mixed 'dough'. 2. I spray my hands with cooking spray before rounding into balls. 3. I place the rounded balls onto wax paper and freeze before I dip them. This helps tremenously! When dipped, they set up almost immediately. My favorite flavor is definitely red velvet cake with cream cheese icing dipped in white chocolate! The best!"
"4","5","Okay maybe I'm a little too eager writing this before I've even dipped them but I'm making white cake with cream cheese frosting, I just tasted a bit and then had to put the mixture into the fridge (as I read is a good thing to do before forming the balls) just so I won't eat the whole thing! So even if everything else were to fail, they'd still be amazing! They smell incredible and taste just like they smell!"
"4","3","These were WAY over the top sweet for us, didn't like them at all, neither did my kids."
"4","5","These are so fun to make! I didn't find them overly time consuming, either. I couldn't find the right melting chocolate anywhere, so I just melted some regular chocolate chips and they turned out perfectly. I gave most of these away at my husband's office and everyone loved them. Someone called them 'little balls of chocolate heaven', and I concur. They're fun and easy to make, thanks for the recipe, I'll have to try some different combinations (I did chocolate cake with buttercream frosting)!"
"4","4","The first time I encountered cake balls, I couldn't stop eating them. I fell in love. I am now an addict, and have tried many different varieties. My fave are Red Velvet w/cream cheese icing (used these for my Twilight party and called them 'Blood Bites'- huge hit). From my experience, the best way to make these is by letting the cake totally cool before mixing in the icing. I wear food-handling gloves for mixing in the icing and rolling into balls. You definately should freeze the balls before you dip them in the chocolate. The second time I made these they were too sweet (although my family didn't agree), and I found that using cream cheese icing is the least richest flavor and can be used in every cake and tastes amazing. Also, I found that almond bark lessens the sweetness. I received some great tips from the reviews about how to make them prettier, as this was my biggest challenge. Thanks for all the great cake ball tips!"
"4","5","Loved these! Went over well with my family. Suggestion:Do not use with confetti cake mix. When you mix the cake with the frosting it loses the confetti color and turns brownish."
"4","5","i don't know why there are some bad reviews, these are awesome! people who are having issues probably didn't freeze them long enough so obviously they would fall apart after dipping them in melted chocolate! after mixing the cake and frosting, roll into balls and then put in the freezer until they are good and frozen! then dip fast! (it helps if you only have out what you are working with at the time so they don't thaw out) after you dip, put them in the fridge. if you put them in the freezer and then serve them, there is too much condensation. enjoy the endless combinations you can make!"
"4","4","I have made many different kinds of cakes balls... and I LOVE them all!! My favorite is crushed golden oreos with 1 pkg cream cheese and then rolled and dipped in either white or milk chocolate. They are all eaten very quickly and really simple to make!"
"4","4","These are so great and versatile! I used red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and am dying to see how it tastes with german choc cake mix with the coconut frosting. I would recommend letting the cake cool before crumbling and mixing in the frosting. I used my hands for the mixing: messy but effective. I also refrigerated the cake balls for several hours before dipping them in the coating. A little less messy that way."
"4","5","This turned out great! I followed the recipe and crumbled the cake while warm. I used yellow cake mix and cream cheese frosting and dipped them in melted semi-sweet chocolate chips. I usually love cooking everything from scratch, so I wasn't excited about the boxed cake mix and prepared frosting, but it was a quick dessert in a flash! They taste like those little chocolate-covered donuts that you get at a convenience store...and I mean that in the BEST way possible! It reminded me of roadtrips when I was younger. Thanks for the great recipe."
"4","4","I made these this past christmas and i agree this recipe couldn't be any simpler or easier. BUT i wish i knew to let it cool before doing everything, my chocolate flavored confectioner's coating kept hardening up on me and as far as the cake balls go, they ended up a big mess. But i will give it another chance and listen to other reviewers."
"4","5","I love this recipe and have made many variations of it. one hint is don't include the hard edge pieces in the mix."
"4","5","I keep a box of uncoated dark chocolate balls (my personal favorite!) in the freezer that are well wrapped up. It's an easy way to make just a few at a time. They are my favorite dessert!"
"4","2","I know these seem to be popular and I see them at every bake sale. They look beautiful, but I found them too sweet. Perhaps if they were made with homemade cake and frosting they would be better."
"4","5","Very sweet! But fun to share :)"
"4","5","I made these at Christmas and forgot to review them, I branched out with other cake mix flavors. Took some on a trip to Mississippi where they were well received. We all loved them. Our favorite was Cherry where I added 1/2 a jar of marachinos into the cake mix and cream cheese frosting covered them with white melting chocolate....Also did these in Carrot cake, Lemon and Chocolate......these were so yummy."
"4","5","Everyone loves these! So far people seem to have liked devils food cake with cream cheese frosting the most. German chocolate with the coconut pecan frosting was also a huge success."
"4","5","I made this for a Christmas family gathering and everyone loved them! My kids and husband said it was their favorite and wanted me to make more! We didn't find them too sweet or anything, they really tasted like chocolate covered cake! This does take a while and if you try to rush it, something will probably go wrong. I did this the day before Christmas Eve, for a Christmas Eve gathering. Please do a day ahead of time so you have enough time to do it right. I did a few things a little differently. I baked a cake (Devil's Food cake, reduced sugar and I think it was extra moist) then I let it cool for almost 2 hours. I broke it into chunks into a big bowl, then I took the mixers attached to my mixer and mashed it more to get more crumbs. I only used half a container of buttercream chocolate frosting and mixed that into the crumbled cake. It was a great consistently, I was easily able to pick off a small piece and roll it into a ball, then place on a wax paper covered cookie sheet, then I put a tooth pick into each ball and froze for a few hours. Once the balls were hard, I dipped them into the almond bark (which tasted just fine by the way) and put back onto the wax paper covered cookie sheet. Once they hardened I twisted the tooth pick until it came out. Don't pull the tooth pick out or it could crack the chocolate!"
"4","5","These were phenomenal! I made a ton of them for Christmas. Yellow Cake w/ Fudge Frosting dipped in Bittersweet Chocolate, Orange Supreme Cake w/ Vanilla Frosting dipped in Bittersweet Chocolate, and Spice Cake w/ Cream Cheese Frosting dipped in White Chocolate. Each flavor was delectable. I made sure to replace the water in all of the mixes with milk (for a moister crumb), and I crumbled the cake while still warm and added about 3/4 of the frosting and then let it sit for a couple hours before rolling them out. They were the perfect consistency by then. I used a fork to roll them in the chocolate and tap off the excess. I drizzled chocolate on the finished product (white on dark and dark on white) and then dusted them with sprinkles. They looked like something out of a bakery. My husband said they reminded him of really moist donut holes. All of my friends absolutely loved them and were begging for the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe!"
"4","2","It's so frustrating when you expect a recipe to turn out great and it doesn't. The rating on taste alone is a 4. I mean come on, it's your favorite cake and icing. But the instructions for making the acutal balls are misleading. I formed the balls with my pampered chef cookies scoop so they were all the same size. However, 3 ounces of bark...ha! I used half a package and didn't even finish coating my balls. I was making these for a Christmas party tomorrow so I used the white almond bark and some red sprinkles. I froze my cake balls for about 9 hours today. When I dipped them in the chocolate, they started to leave crumbs in the coating so the almond bark looked dirty and they didn't drain well, so I was left with a clumpy dirty ball that even the red sprinkles couldn't make pretty. Now I have to start over with something new for tomorrow's party."
"4","4","I made these with left over cake scraps from 2 cake orders that I had and took the balls into work the next day. I had enough cake left to make a double batch so I made one with chocolate frosting and one with cherry frosting. They were gone quickly and extremely liked! I'm so glad that I have a quick and easy recipe to use left over cake! No more waste in the garbage!"
"4","5","My husband and I made these together. I did need much more chocolate than the resipe said. I used a cake mix with pudding and they were very much like gooey brownies. They were very good. We served them with ice cream also. Next time I will try them with a cake mix that does not have pudding as suggested. I also want to try a yello cake with vanilla frosting and covered in chocolate. These would be great for kids school parties."
"4","3","I made these according to the recipe except that I used chocolate candy melts instead of the almond bark stuff you get at the grocery store and froze the cake mix/frosting balls for a couple hours before dipping. I bit into one to test it after they were done and oh my word. The reviews that said they tasted uncooked (like cake batter) and/or like they had already been chewed were right. I immediately went out to the store and got another cake mix. My problems with the first round were that the combination of the freezing, too much frosting, and the fact that cake mixes you buy these days have pudding in them and therefore are already very moist all contributed to making the insides a mushy mess. So. I made my new cake, crumbled it up, and formed one small test ball out of just cake crumbs, no frosting. I put it in the fridge, not freezer, for a couple of hours, then dipped it in the chocolate. The result? Exactly what I had envisioned these to be. CAKE inside, not cake-batter-tasting mush. I say, don't use frosting at all...It only makes things mushier, not to mention it makes these much less horrible for you, and DON'T freeze them before dipping...Just put them in the fridge."
"4","4","Made these for a work potluck and they were a HIT! To make the dipping process easier, I shaped the balls on a lollipop stick and then dipped them. For a cute and easy presentation, I stuck them in a basket with styrofoam. Oh, and I called them 'Cake Pops' because it just sounded more appetizing. Lol!"
"4","5","A lot of work but the finished product was really great! I served them chilled and they were a huge hit at our party!"
"4","5","So Good!! The biggest misteak was making these in the first place, cuz now my friends won't leave me alone. They are always requested for any party, potluck or get together. The favorite combo so far is cherry chip cake with cherry frosting, and white choc on the outside. Just beware- once you turn your friends onto them, they are like some kind of addictive drug, they will bug you for more and more. lol"
"4","5","unlimited possibilities... LOVE IT"
"4","5","These are awesome. I baked the cakes the night before (spice cake, cream cheese icing, white chocoate and also devils food cake, white icing and mint chocolate chips). I just cut the cakes in big pieces and let my stand mixer crumble it for me. I put the icing in the microwave for 20 seconds to soften it some and only added enough of it to turn the cake/icing mixer into a cookie dough consistency. I used my cookie scoop to form the balls and chilled them in the freezer before i coated them with the chocolate. They taste yummy and i can't wait to experiment with other flavor combos. I will also be adding these to my list of homemade goodies i make at Christmas."
"4","5","These are very good, they're really addicting... I used chocolate cake mix, chocolate frosting and coated them in dark chocolate. Everyone loved them. I took the advice of some of the users to let it cook for a bit, I wish I hadn't. I think you should crumble the cake when it is still fairly hot to ensure the smallest crumbs for best formation for dipping."
"4","4","Made this for Valentine's day this year. We used a strawberry cake mix with 'whipped' whipped cream flavored icing. I used my own recipe for ganache to cover the balls. They were fantastic! I love the idea and will be making them again very soon. Thanks!"
"4","1","These looked good, but were sort of weird and no one really went for them. I think mentally the thought of mooshed cake mixed with icing and then rolled into a ball and dipped in chocolate...I just thought it was gross and can't get past it to really like them."
"4","5","These are amazing! I made red velvet cake balls with cream cheese icing and they were simply heavenly. They freeze really well so you can actually make a few, leave the remaining balls in the freezer then come back a week later and make more. No freezer burn whatsoever. I used an entire bag of almond bark. I do not recommend the double boiler method. Melt a few squares of almond bark in the microwave and add more as needed. Leave the balls in the freezer while you work, I found removing ony 3 or 4 at a time worked best. Otherwise, as the balls begin to thaw the almond bark will pick up bits of cake and you will not get a smooth coating. I served these at our annual Christmas party and received rave reviews. I am now referred to as the Dessert Goddess.(lol) I cannot wait to try other variations. I love, love love this recipe."
"4","1","I made these over the holidays and they were not to our taste. When you mix the cooled cake mix and the frosting (I didn't even use all of it) it becomes a gooey center. When you bite into them it almost feels like they are raw with the gooey center. They looked great and fun to make but didn't like the texture. And the choc almond bark had a strange flavor. I will not make again."
"4","1","A lot of work and time. I expected a lot more. They were ok. Like chocolate covered munchkins. I used a home-made cake, icing and very goood quality chocolate. I don't get how this is rated so high!"
"4","5","these look and taste amazing!! definitely start by adding only half of the containier of frosting, and slowly add more if necessary- i found that using just a little more than half of the container was perfect to give the balls a more 'cake-y' consistency (insteasd of too gooey). i waited for the cake to cool before crumbling and mixing, then refrigerated the formed balls for about 2 hours. i melted a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips mixed with 2Tbs oil for dipping. then i drizzled melted white chocolate over the tops with a fork for a pretty design. i refrigerated them for a few more hours before serving- nobody believed i made them myself! definitely will make these for a company new years luncheon next week. This recipe is worth a try!!"
"4","5","Followed the recipe as the first poster but did put cake and frosting in fridge til chilled and dipped them and chilled again, I used milk chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting but dipped in melted reese's peanut butter chips with chocolate and peanut butter mixture drizzled on top, YUMMY!"
"4","1","I thought these looked so pretty from the photos, so I happily planned to make a batch for the holidays. First off, they are soggy and just...offensive on the inside. Also, you need to make the balls, freeze them and then dip them in the chocolate. I think that a lot of the people who said they were hard to dip used melted chocolate chips and not the actually confection chocolate specific for coating things. Melted chips are too heavy (hence people saying they needed the double amount)."
"4","4","These do take a while to make, and 3 oz of chocolate is nowhere near enough to cover one batch. I made a double batch and it took me 3 hours from start to finish. I made 2 devils food cakes, mixed chocolate frosting and mint extract in one and caramel coconut frosting in the other. I coated them both in melted semi-sweet chips then decorated them. The wow factor is definitely here with these and most people thought I bought them from a bakery. They taste like rich, smooth truffle candies.  In my opinion, cake balls are great, but this recipe needs some adjustment. Here are my tips: Don't use the whole can of frosting, start with half and add more as you need it. The mix should be sticky enough to form balls but not soggy. Also, I put the balls in the freezer for 30 minutes before dipping them and I had no problem with them falling apart. DO NOT USE CHOCOLATE BARK OR CANDIE QUICK, those products taste waxy and overly sweet. Use a bag of semi-sweet chips with a tiny bit of oil to make it smooth over a double boiler and they come out WAY better. Even though these took a while to make, I had fun making them and the taste was out of this world. Numerous people asked for the recipe. I will make these again."
"4","1","I made the red velvet and cream cheese combo and the chocolate and chocolate frosting combo. I followed the directions exactly. It took me over 4 hours to make two recipes. I dipped the red velvet in white chocolate bark and the chocolate in chocolate bark. The white chocolate was awful to work with - never again. They looked so pretty when I finished. Both my husband and I tasted them and they tasted like cake with waxy chocolate. I'm embarrassed to give them to anyone! I really don't understand why everyone is giving this recipe 5 stars - it's not worth the time and effort. I have been baking for over 30 years - so I know what I'm talking about - there are better tasting recipes out there."
"4","5","SPEEDY cake balls: I didn't realize how much time cake balls were supposed to be chilled and such. Since I was on a time crunch, I did it the speedy way and they turned out GREAT! I stuck the cake and frosting mix in the freezer for 30 minutes. Then I made the balls and put them in the freezer for another 30 minutes. Finally I dipped them in melted almond bark and put them back in the freezer for another 10 minutes. They were nice and moist on the inside and everyone loved them!"
"4","5","This tasty dessert is one of the neatest things I have ever made! It takes a while, but it is worth the effort. I made a chocoalte cake, crumbled it while still warm and mixed in most of a can of white icing. I then rolled into balls and put into freezer for about an hour. Dipped in dark chocolate, sprinkled with sprinkles, and put back into the freezer for a bit! They are wonderful, very rich and elegent, and I look very forward to making differnt flavor combinations!"
"4","4","I used a white cake with chocolate frosting. I let the cake cool, as suggested, but things still turned out gooey. I may use less frosting next time for a more cake-like texture. I rolled some of them in crushed candy canes, however that just made a mess and will not be doing it again. I added some shortning and mint extract to the melted almond bark. I also freezed the balls overnight to help with dipping. I yielded more than was specified. I ended up using much more chocolate than was specified. I started to half chocolate/half sprinkles because I thought I wouldn't have enough chocolate. This turned out delicious and everyone liked them, but were 'a labor of love'!"
"4","4","I saw this on The Pioneer Woman first. She recommends freezing the cake balls before dipping, and uses what looks to be Wilton Candy Melts. She also sticks lollypop sticks through to make them lollypops!! These are awesome and look really cute."
"4","3","This is overall a good concept and tasty. It would be good for a party or open house as no fork is needed. However, it is time consuming. I would not crumble cake warm I did and it was a soggy mess. I would cool cake then add frosting if you need to warm frosting in micrwave about 20 seconds. I also would not use all it was too much...maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of can. It is also mandatory to freeze balls before you dip at least 3 hours. As previous user stated an egg dyer tool works nicely. Decorating stores have chocolate dipping tools as well. Toothpicks are a nightmare. With these tips I will try again and you should too, and try with different flavors."
"4","1","These didn't turn out for me. In fact, I never finished making them. They were nothing like cake the minute I mixed them with the frosting. I'm wondering if it's b/c I used homemade frosting? Everything dissolved into a lump and tasted more like butter than anything else. Even after refrigerating, they wouldn't form a ball, so they were too difficult to dip as well. They were just mush."
"4","2","I'm not a big fan of these. The pics looked great, so I thought I'd try it. I made two batches -- funfetti cake with strawberry frosting and vanilla bark. Those were way too sweet, I threw most of the cake away before frosting them. The second batch was devils food cake mix with cream cheese frosting and chocolate bark. These are very good, taste almost like donut holes. But, by the time I got to them, I was so tired of making them. While the latter batch tasted good, it wasn't worth the amount of time put into them."
"4","5","OMG. What a great recipe that comes out so impressive looking! Yes, it does take some 'time' with all of the refriderating and freezing, but you can also do it way ahead of time and when you have the time.  Here's what we did.  Baked the cake on Monday. Followed other reviews and let cake cool about 30 min and left out most of the crust.  Only used 1/2 can of frosting. (We used carrot cake and cream cheese frosting with white chocolate on the outside! YUM!) Then put it in the fridge overnight (I think you could do it for less time but this is what worked for us.) Next day, make the balls. I used my hands and had a small bowl of water next to me to help with any sticking issues.  Put balls on cookie sheet in freezer over night (on foil.) Next day, melted a bag of white chocolate chips with 4 tsp shortning and just threw 4-5 balls in the bowl at a time, mixed them up, and pulled them out with a spoon. I must admit I probably used more chocolate on each ball than needed and almost ran out, but who cares, much quicker and easier than dipping one at a time. (I had a toddler helping so time was of the essence!) Will be making these AGAIN AND AGAIN as they were a big hit at my sisters b-day and so easy to serve.  YAY, what a great keeper of a recipe.  Cant wait to use this for my daughter's b-days and events."
"4","5","These were AMAZING!! My only problem was that when i was coating them in the chocolate the cake crumbled a bit."
"4","5","These have become a favorite of mine. My family thought they were the best things ever. Thanks for such a great recipe."
"4","5","Yummy! I read so many reviews but here is what I did: I used Devil's Food cake and Milk Chocolate Frosting and Wilson's 12 oz. bag of Candy Melts. I let my cake cool for 1/2 an hour. I started with only 1/2 a can of frosting as others suggested but for me it really needed the whole can. I then dropped them by spoonfuls on waxed paper then rolled them into balls using my hands. They turned out perfect, so far smooth sailing! Couldn't get them in the freezer so I had to settle for the fridge. I boiled a small pot of water, removed from stove and set a glass bowl on top of the pan so the water was touching. I added my melts a few at a time. (The water stayed hot enough to melt all the chocolates and complete the job). Then things got messy. What a pain to dip (more like roll) those things! I used tooth picks but the chocolate came off where ever the toothpick last touched, and it dries super quick so I had to stop after two balls to add the sprinkles. Anyway, long story short, lay down waxed paper in your work area and keep away all two-year olds or everything will be covered in chocolate and sprinkles, and I mean everything, toddler included! Oh, also, I used fingerfuls of the remaining chocolate to touch up any bald spots, there were a ton! Paint brush would've helped."
"4","5","Things I would have done differently the first time. 1. I would have made my white cake with the egg whites only and not baked it so long. 2. I would have not have thinned out my chocolate with Crisco. I really like to use Nestle white chocolate chips for dipping. I used two bags of the chips."
"4","4","This recipe is great, great tasting and make wonderful gifts! However, if I can suggest some alterations to this recipe--first, let the cake cool completely before crumbling and mixing with the frosting. This makes the balls easier to roll, especially if doing by hand, which I find to be more fun and give a more personal, homemade touch! Also, refrigerate or freeze the rolled balls for a few hours before dipping, keeping the pan of balls in the fridge and plucking out one or two at a time to dip. Hot dipping chocolate and cold cake balls make for the easiest dipping. Microwave small amounts of bark at a time in a coffee mug--it's better for the container you're dipping into to be more deep than shallow. You can also make these lollipops if you insert lollipop sticks into the balls before refrigerating, just make sure to dip them so that a little chocolate gets on the stick (to help them stay put) and hold each horizontally over your mug for a few seconds until the coating sets some, otherwise the balls will slide down the sticks. Stick into a block of styrofoam to dry."
"4","5","UPDATE: If your grocery store's like mine and only carries almond bark at Christmas, don't try to make them in the summer using Magic Shell coating instead of almond bark (Magic Shell's the syrup you put on ice cream and it hardens). It's a mess to make, the shell doesn't completly harden, you have to keep the balls in the freeze until time to eat them (which makes them hard to bite and people with sensetive teeth can't eat them) and the warmth from your fingers melts the chocolate shell so it gets everywhere!  This is the BEST recipe! I made these to take to the party where i met my boyfriend's parents and they loved them! Only thing is it took me WAY more than a 3 oz block of dipping chocolate. I ended up using the whole package. I also just dropped the balls into the chocolate and coated them completely instead of trying to dip them. I would also highly suggest putting the balls on a wax paper covered cookie sheet and stick them in the freezer for an hour or so. After dipping them put them back on the cold cookie sheet and they harden in no time."
"4","5","I used white cake mix & white frosting I tinted it red with food colaring. For our church Haloween party, called BLOOD BALLS, the were a smash. My husband & I were just talking about different ways for CHRISTMAS, so these would be our cookie platter along with my different candies thanks joy,plymouth, pa"
"4","5","This was YUMMY!! I made the cake balls using german chocolate cake mix,coconut pecan frosting & chocolate candy coating. I took these to work and my co-workers couldn't praise me enough for them. I crumbled the cake mix and put in the frosting right out of the oven and that made it easy to make into balls. I then put the balls into the freezer for 15 minutes to set then dipped in chocolate. I can't wait to make these again."
"4","5","I found this recipe around Christmas and I've been making them since then!!! They are wonderful and everyone that tries them...falls in love. I love red velvet/cream cheese, and strawberry and of course chocolate. I've been dreaming of mint chocolate chip and can't wait to make those! Def. important for mixture to be COLD before forming balls, and I use 2 spoons back and forth to coat in candy coating. I also thin my candy coating with vegetable oil..it helps."
"4","5","Amazing! Use a Pampered Chef small scoop or something of the sorts to at least get them in consistent bite-sized balls. I used strawberry cake, vanilla frosting (thanks to the suggestion of another user), then dipped in almond bark or chocolate bark, a little wax, and a little vegetable oil, and these little things are a DREAM! The different variations sound AWESOME. I am telling the world about them! EASY, EASY, EASY!!! Even the dipping was easy! I do this in a 3 step process not necessarily all in 1 day - mix the frosting & cake, use the PC small scoop to put each ball in a pan, refrigerate (I've had them in the fridge almost a week before moving to the next step), then roll them into actual balls by hand & dip when they're still cool. So easy. I recently used lemon cake/lemon frosting & almond bark. Interesting, and something different than chocolate."
"4","5","Oh my! How very easy and sinfully rich. My holiday guests really enjoyed these, not only because they are delicious, but because they are just the right size for the carb conscious folks. Because of my chocoholics I made them exactly as state, but for the gourmet taste buds, I made banana cake with pecan coconut frosting, then rolled them in dark cocoa bark."
"4","4","I made these for someone's birthday and they were a big hit. No one could believe how easy they were to make! I used cherry chip cake mix and cherry icing with semi sweet chocolate for dipping. My only complaint with the recipe is that the amount of chocolate called for isn't nearly enough. I melted two bars and ended up having to also melt 2 bags of chocolate morsels. Overall, wonderful!"
"4","5","Crazy good, and almost fun to make. Took others step of chilling the frosting/cake combo, then used white chocolate, semisweet and milk chocolate, rolled in coconut and walnut and heath bar and sprinkles...my husband said this was the best thing ever!"
"4","5","Freezing before dipping makes it so much easier. These are going to be my new standby dish to take to parties."
"4","5","I used lemon cake and icing, then dipped them in vanilla almond bark.All I got were rave reviews. They were as good as the ones from the pastry shop! I found that freezing them solid before dipping is the way to go, it makes it so much easier. I can't wait to try chocolate."
"3","5","These were really good and made the 'cake' last longer. They were very sweet - but everyone in my family thought they were perfect. I had to use a lot more chocolate coating than what the recipe called for, otherwise the recipe was perfect. I could see a million different combinations that could be made and enjoyed for so many events and holidays."
"3","2","Watch the video. The recipe leaves out the step where you refrigerate/freeze the balls before dipping."
"3","5","These are fun to make and worth the time. I use a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips melted in the top of a double boiler or glass bowl on top of pot of simmering water with 1/2 stick of gulf wax to dip the balls in. Tastes great and everyone loves them."
"3","5","I have used this recipe several times, works with any cake mix and frosting. Used a whole package of almond bark to coat the balls after leaving them in the freezer overnight to harden. Added a teaspoon of olive oil to thin the chocolate. Made the balls by hand. Put flour on hands to keep the balls from sticking to my hand."
"3","2","This recipe can be expensive and takes a very long time. I say expensive because it tastes very artificial and unpleasant unless you are using quality dipping chocolate, which is hard to find, but worth it. As for the time, you MUST freeze those cake balls before icing them unless you want a huge, gooey mess. Then the individual dipping takes quite a bit of your time as well. It's tedious, so be prepared!"
"3","5","I made this with spice cake, cream cheese icing, and vanilla almond bark. My boyfriend, my son, and all their friends, went bolistic!!! I will definitely use this recipe over and over!!"
"3","4","I used devils food cake mix and chocolate frosting..make sure cake is cool before crumbling and use about 3/4 of a 16 Paz container of frosting when cooled. Roll into balls and refrigerate for at least an hour before dipping in chocolate coating."
"3","4","This recipe is good start... but I have a coupla tips. Definitely chill the balls, makes it way easier, especially if you are making cake pops. Also, I used *half* the recommended frosting, I would have had mush otherwise. Yes, they are supersweet, but a huge hit with school-age kids, especially with crushed peppermint on top for the holidays."
"3","5","This is excellent, always a hit at a BBQ , I made pina colada's : pineapple cake, coconut/pecan frosting and roll in powdered sugar. BIG HIT."
"3","5","I have made and sold these for several years at craft fairs, they are always a huge hit! I add extracts to kick up the flavor and food coloring to enhance the look."
"3","5","We love these! We love to use German chocolate cake with German Chocolate frosting. Delish! Definitely freeze for an hour or longer before dipping into hot chocolate, otherwise, the ball falls apart into your chocolate and then it looks way less appetizing. I may have to make some tomorrow, they just look so yummy!"
"3","4","I agree about the Andes Candies....these were amazing on devils food cake and chocolate frosting. I also bought the microwaveable chocolate dipping kit from the produce section for dipping fruit. I only dipped the balls half way in the chocolate, because the kit is small, but this made the balls easier to eat, because you don't bite into it and lose half of the shell on the floor. Perfect."
"3","5","I made these with my own cake recipe and homemade frosting (i can't stand ready-made frostings) they turned out great, and all my party guests were crazy about them!"
"3","4","I've made these numerous times with different combinations of cake and icing. Although I haven't read all of the reviews, I did notice that many people who didn't like this recipe said it was mushy. My guess is that the people making these have only had the 'cake pops' that are really just cake on a stick. True cake pops are supposed to have the texture of raw cake batter. That is one the best things about them! The outside is crunchy and the inside is gooey!!! The only thing that I change is the amount of frosting; I use about 3/4 of a can."
"3","5","I have been making these for 3 years for work goody Day everyone one raves about them, they go fast.Some tell me they taste let Hostess King Dongs! chocolate is the best."
"3","1","I'm with the rest of the negative reviews. I don't get it. Followed the instructions using a tub of cream cheese frosting and refrigerated overnight. They were still mushy. I didn't even bother doing the chocolate coating. I didn't want to waste it because I new from the taste of the rest that there were not worth it. I've seen recipes with cream cheese instead of the frosting. Maybe those might be better? Glad I didn't make and send them to my son's school."
"3","5","These are a hit whenever I make them! I've done funfetti with sprinkles, red velvet, chocolate. The combinations are endless. Sometimes the simplest recipes are the biggest hits! This is the case with this recipe!"
"3","2","After all the reviews I read I expected these to be off the wall. They were just OK....not that great in my book. I followed the recipe exactly and used strawberry cake mix with strawberry frosting covered in white chocolate. I also tried chocolate cake mix with milk chocolate frosting covered in white chocolate. I made them for my daughter's birthday party, and while they looked pretty, nobody really liked them. I will not make them again, it was not worth the effort."
"3","5","Yes, of course these were time consuming, but ... Totally worth it! I thought that they looked horrible when I was done but everyone at our family Christmas party and everyone at work loved them and said they looked great! I wasn't going to make them again after realizing the time they take, but with all of the positive feedback I will definately try again! Maybe I will try I different type of coating, since that is what made them look strange to me."
"3","4","Made it with home made chocolate cake and frosting, then covered in semisweet chocolate chips. I thought the chocolate coating was too thick, but it was difficult for the coating to be thinner."
"3","5","I made three cakes and ended up with thousands of cake balls, lol! Seriously, three cakes makes a ridiculous amount of treats. I mixed strawberry cake mix with vanilla frosting, confetti cake with chocolate frosting, and devil's food cake with cream cheese frosting. I loved the strawberry combo, my hubby preferred the devil's food cake. I should have heeded reviewer's warnings and only used half of the container of frosting because using the entire container AND dipping each one in chocolate creates a very sweet dessert. Almond bark is tasty and buying a package is a lot cheaper than paying for the convenience of pre-made dipping containers which are obsolete after only a few balls. This is such a fun, cheap, and easy recipe that I can't wait to experiment with it again and again!"
"3","1","I was SURE everyone, including myself would love these. They sound so good. However, I made them and they were so rich that no one could eat them and I ended up throwing them all out. Sorry, I really wanted to like them. Won't be making them again..."
"3","4","I recently made these for my son's second grade holiday party. These are good, and I'm glad I read through the reviews for some of the advice. I only used a 1/2 can of frosting, and I smashed up the cake with a dough cutter, which made it not so mushy. I also put the balls in the freezer before frosting which was definitely needed. With all that said, however, I have to admit...I'm like the one reviewer. I think next time I might be more inclined to make cupcakes and frost them and call it good. There really is quite a lot of steps to these. Yes it was fun and festive, but not sure worth all the effort!"
"3","5","These are great for kids! Fun and easy to make. Can be made with many sprinkles and drizzles in a nice presentations."
"3","2","I tried and tried, but just couldn't get it to work out."
"3","1","I have never had cake balls but they sounded like a good idea for a Christmas treat. After trying one, I realized they weren't for me. Be prepared to spend A LOT of time making these and a lot of chocolate."
"3","5","I did gluten free."
"3","5","Excellent! I put a candy stick on the end of each ball before dipping in assorted chocolates to make cake pops."
"3","5","These are amazing. And they look so professional. If yours come out too mushy just add some powdered sugar to get the correct consistency."
"3","5","Ohh baby ohh baby light my fire! These were great! Works great with any cake mix."
"3","5","Awesome! This recipe if very easy, but takes a little time. I prepared the balls ahead a few days and kept in the fridge. The night before my party, I dipped them in the melted bark. Everyone thought they were from a bakery!"
"3","5","This is great to make with grand kids! To help them with the dipping, I gave them a pastry brush and a spoon to get the chocolate covering. They/we had fun and they were so proud!"
"3","5","Pretty good. I just thought it was a lot of work. I made home made chocolate cake with chocolate icing. I think some people thought it was too decadent but some lOved them."
"3","2","I did not care for this recipe."
"3","5","Some thought they were too sweet. but I loved them. I will make these again. I made two kinds one chocolate cake with German chocolate frosting and the other red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting!"
"3","4","I have to admit that I was not impressed with this recipe. I made it with confetti cake mix and icing and it was entirely too moist. BUT my teenagers absolutely loved it! My daughter made it with chocolate this weekend and they disappeared rapidly. They are better without the candy coating."
"3","5","So many possibilities!"
"3","5","Easy and tastes great! I made red velvet, cream cheese frosting and white chocolate almond bark. Soooo good, and I like the way you can make so many different combinations with this. I will make these over and over and they are such a hit at parties!"
"3","1","Did not like consistency (as someone else said earlier.. 'like pre-chewed cake') and they were way too sweet. I won't be making these again."
"3","4","These were good -- once I was finally finished making them. I ran out of chocolate to cover them with and I used 8 oz of it. There was too much in-between time before they were finally done which kind of turned me off from them, but the end result was pretty good."
"3","5","Very good, takes longer to make than recipe calls for."
"3","4","These came out delicious. I would recommend letting the balls harden before dipping them into the melted chocolate, otherwise they'll fall apart. Since we were low on time and couldn't let them cool off, we just drizzled the chocolate over the top and they came out great!"
"3","5","A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I had these at a party and had to get the recipe! I'm not a baker, so these are so easy and are honestly to die for! She recommends yellow cake & buttercream, which is what I made. Next time I'll also try red velvet with white chocolate outside. They are so good I gave them to my dessert-loving sister as part of her birthday gift. Seriously, so good. So so so good. And so easy! They are so pretty when done- people asked me if they were out of a candy box! Drizzle with contrasting melted choc. cover for effect. :) Thank you!"
"3","4","Oh ya, these are good!! Be sure and read some of the reviews for some great tips/ideas to make the process easier. I used a cherry chip cake mix with chocolate frosting--good combo! I did freeze the cake balls before dipping. The recipe calls for 3 oz. of coating?? I used about half of a 24 oz. block of coating (almond bark)...3 oz. isn't going to do the job! I did have some trouble with some of them cracking or 'oozing' cake mixture after being dipped...next time I might try doing some of them without freezing them to see if that makes a difference."
"3","5","So delicious! You have to be careful because they're so easy to pop in your mouth and before long you've eaten too many of these cake balls!  When the cake is done, I let mine cool for 30 minutes before crumbling and adding the frosting. Then I put that mixture into the fridge for 1 hour to cool it completely. I don't own a melon baller so I used my hands to roll the balls, keeping my palms wet with water to prevent sticking. I then placed the balls on a plate in the freezer for about 1 hour. This makes them easier to roll.  Variations I've done: carrot cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate coating, strawberry cake with vanilla frosting dipped in milk chocolate coating, red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate coating. Can't wait to try more variations!"
"3","5","Allison, these are awesome! I took a few other suggestions and used red velvet cake with cream cheese icing. I also used melted chocolate chips for the coating since I had them on hand. These were a big hit with company, and really, really easy!"
"3","5","I have made these a few times and they are always a hit. The latest was lemon cake with lemon frosting, dipped in white chocolate. So good!"
"3","5","SOOO GOOD!!! I baked cake as directed, then crumbled and let cool for about 20 minutes before mixing in frosting. I also only used half of the frosting, but it was still incredibly rich and creamy. So glad I tried this recipe. Definitely worth it!"
"3","3","Texture was off for me."
"3","5","I love making these because the end result is always a huge hit! When I make them I crumble when warm or cooled (it doesn't matter) and then add half the can of frosting. If you want a really moist cakeball then add a little more frosting but not too much. After i mix in the frosting I roll them out then stick them in the freezer for 15 minutes. For dipping I use the candy coating disks (not sure the brand) I got at Michaels. I just use a spoon and tap it on the edge to get the excess off then once they're dried I drizzle more of the candy coating! They come out perfect!"
"3","5","This recipe is easy, can be made with a ton of flavor combinations, and makes cute treats worthy for a gift. I used white cake, coconut pecan frosting, and chocolate coating. I let the cake cool for ~20 minutes and crumbled while still warm. The icing was pretty thick so I thought warm cake might work better. I didn't have to chill the cake mixture before rolling into balls (maybe b/c the frosting made it greasy enough not to stick). Skewers worked much better than toothpicks for dipping. I sprinkled the balls with coconut and almonds to cover up the hole made by the skewer. Excited to use this recipe again with other flavors!"
"3","3","Great taste! And I went in knowing these would be work. They ended up being more work than I wanted though. MUST freeze the balls so that you can actually dip them. And in what? I tried a few different things and nothing came out with a good presentation. Everything came out tasting good... but I wouldn't be able to make these as a gift or party which is what I'd tried them out in hopes of using them for."
"3","5","What fun! Very easy, although a tad time consuming. Worth the effort however. Thanks!"
"3","4","Really only 3 oz. of chocolate to cover all of the cake balls? I had to use 2 pounds of the candy discs, what did I do wrong? They were definitely delicious, and I will make again, maybe I used the wrong kind of candy. I used the candy discs from A.C. Moore. Any suggestions??"
"3","4","taste great, but not fun to make. tedious. messy, time consuming, and by the end of the process, I don't even want to eat them. but my family gobbles them up as quick as I can get them made."
"3","4","So good! I would also suggest to let the cake cool down for AT LEAST 30 minutes, freeze the cake balls before coating them, and don't use a full can of frosting. I used about 2/3of a can and I thought it was still a bit too much. I also added some colorful sprinkles to the cake ball mix, very cute. Yum!"
"3","5","I thought these were delicious and will make them again using different cakes and ingredients to add to them. I give them 5 stars"
"3","4","These were not hard to make - at all. I'm trying to figure out why some of the reviews said they were too much work because they are very easy. They are time consuming as far as, you have to wait for the balls to freeze before coating.  I used Wilton candy melts in light blue and pink to coat and a triple fudge cake mix with buttercream frosting for the inside. They looked great - like Easter truffles. They were tasty but the interior was a little spongy. I'm going to try another type of cake mix and less frosting and see if that changes the texture at all. My husband and boys loved them. I thought they were good but not great."
"3","2","These are are ok. The texture was weird to me. Very time consuming. We made the little chicks, which turned out very cute, but for a mom with a toddler and a baby, these were more work then they're worth."
"3","2","Disappointed. Maybe i am doing something wrong."
"3","5","I would give these Cake Balls 10 stars if I could! Amazing that's all I can say"
"3","4","Made these for Christmas to give to our neighbors. They loved them!!! I used a chocolate cake mix and added a bit of peppermint. Everyone asked for the recipe!"
"3","5","Wow. I made these for a school fundraiser and got rave reviews. It's a work-intensive process that took me a LONG time, but once I got the hang of it (I made 3 batches) it was, as they say, a piece of cake.   1) I used half the can of frosting 2) I froze the pre-dipped balls overnight 3) I will not use almond bark again. I think the moisture in the cake balls made it clumpy and lumpy and pretty ugly.  Flavor combos: 1) strawberry w/white frosting, dark chocolate coating w/ white chocolate drizzle 2) red velvet cake w/cream cheese frosting and vanilla almond bark coating. Tasted great but looked awful 3) Fudge cake w/Andes mints baking pieces mixed into batter w/ chocolate frosting, melted Andes baking pieces and dark chocoalte drizzle. All taste phenomenal. These are not an everyday project for me, but for special occasions I can see them becoming highly requested."
"3","5","These are great. I made carrot cake balls using homemade cream cheese frosting. I used just egg whites (+1 egg white) with the cake mix. I messed up with the white chocolate coating - for some reason it got chunky (I might have heated it up to much or something) - so instead of throwing it away, I added milk and butter to the chunky chocolate mess and it smoothed it out. It looked like a glaze. It pretty much tasted like a soft carrot cake glazed donut. After being in the fridge over night it really soaked in and hardened the outside: they are delicious...probably the best mistake I ever made cooking."
"3","5","These are so yummy. The first time I made these I used half of a left over store bought chocolate bundt cake. I didn't have any frosting so I used Nutella instead since I had that on hand. For the chocolate coating I used the Wilton candy melts. The candy melts come in different colors so they are great for different occasions."
"3","4","These are yummy! Red velvet cake and half a can of cream cheese icing was perfect. I froze the balls prior to dipping in the chocolate which made them easier to handle. I also added a bit of Crisco to the chocolate making it much smoother and easier for dipping. I sprinkled on non-pariels right after dipping and they looked adorable. Great for parties."
"3","4","I made these as directed and I did not like them, however I made them a second time using half of the frosting and they were much better. To me a whole can of frosting was WAY to much and they were a mouth full of gooey mush. By halving the frosting, they were fluffy and tasted more like cake."
"3","5","These were GREAT! I made them with Red Velvet cake mix and cream cheese frosting. WOW !! Really good. Dipped them in white chocolate and sprinkled with a little red sugar very pretty. Also made the German chocolate cake mix with the cocoa nut pecan frosting. Dipped in milk chocolate. Also very good. Thanks for this recipe. Its a keeper!!"
"3","5","I think in order for this to be a 5 star recipe, you HAVE to use a homemade chocolate frosting. The pre-processed chocolate frosting is just too chemically flavoured and creates a bad aftertaste...but with homemade chocolate frosting...mmm yummy!"
"3","4","These taste fabulous but I had a tough time getting the chocolate and almond bark smooth and thin. I even used the tip of shortening and had trouble. Maybe my bark was a cheap brand. But very good alternative to traditional cupcakes, cookies ect for bake sale. They make such an adorable looking treat. They were one of the first treats to sell out."
"3","4","This was just ok for me. I wouldn't make them again. The coating was what killed it. I'm sure they would have been much better if they had a real chocolate coating but you need kind of alot of chocolate to cover all the filling. I needed more than 3 oz. *post note* changed my rating from 3 stars to 4- for some reason they were much better then next day. I may make them again after all. I will definitely use real chocolate next time though."
"3","5","I give it a 5 stars, after making some adjustments based on several reviews & trial & error. I only use about 2 Tbsp. of icing. It's enough to give it flavor, but keeps from having a big gooey mess. I have a serious sweet tooth, but even half the container of icing is too much. I have made several combinations & can't wait to make more! These were a HUGE hit at my daughter's birthday party."
"3","3","These were okay. A lot of work and messy. I couldn't get the melted chocolate on right. They tasted better then they looked. I probably won't make them again."
"3","5","German Chocolate cake with the coconut pecan frosting...is there anything better? Seriously?"
"3","2","Just did nothing for me. This review is for the taste and overall appeal for the dessert. They were a little time consuming but freezing them worked great. I tried the red velvet/cream cheese frosting version since it's Christmas and I 'might' make them again using a choc cake/peanut better frosting and then dipping in dark or milk choc but it just wasn't that great to warrant the work and effort."
"3","3","These were easy to make and looked pretty, but were too sweet for my liking. Sadly, I ended up throwing them all out."
"3","5","i would love to tell you how these were but they all got eaten before i even had a chance to have one. i took the advice of another and cooled them before adding the frosting, i also dont think the whole can was needed but i used it anyway. this was a easy croud pleaser and i inlisted the kids help to coat them they had a blast. thanks for the great recipe."
"3","2","These were odd tasting. While others liked them, I was not pleased. I spent all day making these and really feel it was a waste of time when I could have made something that tasted better."
"3","2","These turned out 'O.K.', but I don't think I will make them again. I tried the suggestions, but getting them iced and looking decent was impossible. We still ate them (they were not pretty), but I did not take them to the function I had planned on."
"3","4","After reading the reviews I was prepared to be blow away by these. They were okay. The flavor was fine but I didn't really care for the texture. It was like a very sweet mushy ball of cake inside a chocolate shell. I probably won't make these again. (I used strawberry cake, white frosting, and milk chocolate coating)."
"3","5","I think I fiinally have the dipping thing figured out. Be prepared to go through a lot of toothkpicks - - but toothpicks are cheap. After you have the cake balls nice and cold in the freezer, stick a toothpick in each one. Dip in the coating (I use almond bark), leaving a little of the cake ball visible so the coating isn't touching your toothpick, and set on your wax or silicone lined cookie sheet. Let the coating harden, then remove the toothpick by twistin it out - - like you are unscrewing it. Go back and put a little dollop of coating on the top of each ball. It looks decorative! Do you know there are bakeries selling these things for over $25/dozen???? Great recipe. Thanks!"
"3","3","These were ok, but I expected them to be better. It may be that I haven't had box cake mix in ages, along with store bought frosting, and I forgot that the taste and texture of both are, well, store bought. I made a choc cake and mixed in cream cheese icing as some one suggested. I think choc would have been better. I let the cake cool completely and crumbled it up and mixed in the frosting. I really think a whole standard size can of frosting is too much, as it came out very very mushy. I suggest mixing it in batches stopping when the cake crumbs are just moist enough to form a ball. I used real choc and tempered it. Probably the best part of the whole thing. I have had cake balls before, but made from simple scratch cake and real butter cream that only takes a few extra minutes to throw together that far exceed this version. I won't be making these again. Sorry."
"3","3","Okay...really yummy, but A LOT of work! I attempted to make 3 flavors at once..and after about 2-3 hrs, I finally said 'I'm done!' ha ha. They are quite tasty, though, for me...too much work! Maybe these just take patience (which I don't have a lot of sometimes). I highly recommend lemon cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate-so good. I probably won't make again, not b/c they don't taste good (they do) but b/c of all the work."
"3","4","These are delicious! They are very time consuming but luckily i had my husbands help. I used a strawberry cake mix with cream cheese frosting and it was amazing. I did a yellow cake one to was that good. I had trouble melting chocolate so i bought the bakers microwavable dipping chocolate and it worked out amazing and saved sometime and trouble of melting chocolate. I used walnuts, coconut, chocolate sprinkles, pepperment sprinkles and a cinnamon sprinkle and it all tasted great. I made the cake and cooled it and mixed in the frosting the night before. The strawberry mix definatly needed freezer time since it was harder to form than the yellow mix. I used a mellon baller to shape them then used toothpicks to dip. Im stationed in korea and it was a great thing to make for our christmas party and to hand out to the people on base"
"3","5","these were awesome. here is what i did: used a banana cake mix and baked it in a 8' square pan. once it was done baking, i let it cool in the pan for 15 min, then dumped it onto a cooling rack to cool for probably 30 more minutes. i took off the corners/sides of the cake because they are too hard. then i crumbled the cake into my kitchenaid bowl and added 8 oz. of homemade chocolate ganache cooled, not hot. using the dough hook on my kitchen aid, i whipped up the mixture in no time. i didnt even need to refrigerate the mixture. i could easily make the balls. it wasn't sticky at all, it was perfect. so, i made all the balls, then put them in the freezer for 2 hours. i took 25 of them out at a time (so the others could stay frozen for easy dipping), and dipped them into the melted hershey dark chocolate chips with the toothpicks. i twisted the toothpicks out, then i drizzled on some white chocolate on top. they were AWESOME. the banana/chocolate mixture is a good one lol... we're not fans of the store-bought frosting, so thats why i used the homemade ganache. these turned out soooo yummy :)"
"3","5","I just finished my first batch of these last night and they are sooooo yummy! I even ran out to get more cake mixes and frosting to make them to give out for the holidays. I went safe with the first batch, triple chocolate (cake, frosting and coating). Next up, red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting and white coating. I mixed the cake and the frosting while the cake was still warm because it mixes better that way. Stuck it in the fridge to cool down and scooped it out with my cookie scooper to make them all the same size. I got about 50 of them out of one batch. Once scooped, I popped them in the freezer to solidify a bit more them quickly rolled them in my hand to make the edges smoother before dipping. : )"
"3","5","tried this and took others advice, turned out pretty good. - I ran out of coating and tried melted frosting - not a good idea. My freezer /fridge was pretty full - but since I live here in Ohio - I just let them cool in mother natures freezer - my front porch!!!"
"3","5","These turned out wonderfully! I made them like the recipe said then melted some chocolate chips and dipped them, yum! will definitely make again."
"3","5","WOW! These little guys are amazing! Don't be intimidated by a recipe people, just follow directions. I read LOTS of reviews and followed suggestions: crumble cake (minus the outer edges) in a bowl with only HALF of the frosting while the cake is still warm. Formed the balls with a melon baller, and chilled in fridge for 2 hrs, used a wooden skewer to dip the balls in chocolate. Simple as that... the amount of time depends on how fast you work. I used the Pillsbury festive cake (vanilla cake with the xmas sprinkles mixed in) and a vanilla frosting. For the chocolate dip, I melted a bag of semi-sweet morsels with 1 tbsp shortening. Using my skewer, I rolled the ball around in a spoonfull of chocolate. I used xmas sprinkles, coconut, crushed candycanes, and vanilla to decorate the balls. Placed in mini muffin liners, and they are Beautiful! Oh yea, and they taste like heaven in your mouth :)"
"3","5","Ya know....these are pretty good! We made these to put in our Christmas tins and they turned out great. Always a little scary trying a new recipe 'under pressure' and not knowing if the outcome will be to your liking. I am anxious to try other combination's - like maybe red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting ...oooooo-ahhhhhhhh! Merry Christmas all!"
"3","5","YUMMY!! For us amateur cooks this is great JUST make sure to follow the suggestions to mix the frosting in while hot BUT allow them to cool before you add the coating. Otherwise the balls are so hot they fall to pieces and ruin the melted coating. But absolutely delicious and I have loved mixing and matching cake, frosting, and candy coating flavors!!"
"3","4","These were very tasty and a lot of fun to make. They were VERY easy and a fun project. I took the advice of others and stuck the pre-formed balls in the freezer for 45 minutes to make the dipping easier. I used chocolate cake mix, triple chocolate chip icing and peanut-butter chips (with 1 Tbsp shortening to make it harden correctly.) These are good enough that I am interested in trying other combos. I imagine there are a few really STELLAR combos out there and, once I stumble upon them, I'll re-review :-) Thanks!  *** EDIT *** I made strawberry cake with strawberry icing coated in chocolate. Pretty good, but not great. The chocolate with chocolate icing was MUCH better. Still, though, I'm VERY excited to keep trying out more different combinations!"
"3","3","i was a little disaapointed since I am in love with the oreo truffles...my guests loved it though"
"3","5","These are definitely a crowd pleaser. Everyone at my husband's work devoured round 2 within 1 minute of him arriving to work. Now I have requests for other types of cakes. I used a triple chocolate cake w/ milk chocolate frosting-the whole amount. I dipped in chocolate bark:) I can't wait to try more types!"
"3","4","i substituted 16 oz. cream cheese for the frosting, not near as sweet. my family LOVES them done this way--got 130 balls!!"
"3","5","I made this with lemon cake mix and cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate chips melted. Also made carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate chips. Red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting and semi-sweet chocolate or dipping chocolate is also yummy."
"3","5","SO easy! This is the perfect dessert for dinner parties or events. They look great, are easy to make, and taste wonderful. I followed the advise from the reviews and had no problems. Let the cake cool, then mix in frosting, freeze the balls and coat. I used red velvet and cream cheese icing with a milk chocolate coating. Used shortening in milk chocolate chips instead of the confectioners coating because I prefer the taste."
"3","1","Unfortunately, I didn't read all the reviews before I made the recipe and it was a disaster. The frosting comes in 12 oz containers - not 16 oz so you probably shouldn't use all the cake. If you don't freeze the cake/frosting mix - it's nothing but a cake mix mess in the frosting. I might try it again following all the pointers from the other reviewers."
"3","5","I made these last night for the first time and they're great! I thought they sounded too chocolaty (what was I thinking?) so I used yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting and chocolate coating. Super yum!!!"
"3","5","Store bought or homemade -- it doesn't really matter, this is just a super fun way to revamp, reduce or recycle cake and frosting as we know it. This craze has been around for a while and I can see why -- the flavor combinations are endless (I made cake pops with a choc/choc center, dipped in almond bark, sprinkled with crushed candy canes). ...Now I'm just thinking of all those cakes of birthdays past that eventually became stale and ended up being pitched...."
"3","5","VEry very rich and tasty!"
"3","5","These are delicious! I used German chocolate cake with chocolate icing so they are SUPER rich but soo good. I struggled a bit with the coating, but that was probably the cook not the food :) Overall though, I'm happy with the turnout. I will defiantly be fixing these again!"
"3","4","For Thanksgiving I took carrot cake and used apple cider instead of the water and a couple of teaspoons of apple pie spices. I mixed it with cream cheese frosting then dipped them in white almond bark and chopped walnuts. They were quite tasty and highly addictive according to my friends and family. For Christmas I'm going to use a dark chocolate cake mix and use some peppermint schnapps instead of the water. I will then dip them white almond bark and crushed peppermint candies. I'm also going to do a white cake using pineapple juice and coconut extract with a white frosting then dip them in white almond bark and coconut. My dad can't wait! Make sure you freeze the dough both before and after making the balls. I'm going to also use about 2/3 of the frosting container and see if the the dough is more stiff. They make a great gift!"
"3","5","Tastes great, but I go through a lot more chocolate than called for"
"3","3","A little too sweet for my taste. The kids liked it but we all decided we would use more cake and less icing in the mix. Dipping and covering the outside was fun and turned out pretty."
"3","3","These look impressive, but I wish the taste matched the looks...they just weren't THAT good. I admit, I'm a chocolate snob, so perhaps I will seek out better/more expensive ingredients next time and try again."
"3","5","Extremely easy and delicous! I am going to make these again for xmas hopefully in the shape of little xmas trees. Thanks!"
"3","4","Having had professional versions before, I thought it couldn't be too hard to make these. After skimming the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I baked a cherry chip cake, substituting the water with cola, then let cool for 30 minutes. I mixed in a whole can (per the recipe)of prepared cherry frosting and refrigerated overnight. The next day, I rolled out the balls (with moist hands to stop sticking) and froze them for 6 hours, only due to my work schedule. (I got approximately 45 that varied in size.) I couldn't find 'confectioners coating' at the local grocery, so I bought blocks of semi-sweet chocolate and made a chocolate ganache (with heavy whipping cream) in the microwave. It took about 18 oz. of the chocolate and 10 oz. of heavy whipping cream to cover all of the cake balls. I used one toothpick to dip & one to ease the ball onto the wax paper, then used that same toothpick to fill in the hole on top. (If you need to, you can stick the balls back in the freezer if you have to melt more coating...it will help them from falling into the coating.) I let them set in the fridge for about an hour, before the family got to them and dug in. They'd never had the professional cake balls before and they really liked these. However, I think next time I will adjust the frosting measurements a bit so that they aren't so mushy and end up a bit more dense with cake. Overall, the flavor combination of cherry-cola-chip cake and chocolate ganache coating tasted great."
"3","5","I just love this recipe!! I made tropical cake balls, I used coconut cake with alittle rum mixed in and used coconut to roll them in after I dipped in chocolate, I also rolled in crushed cookies, the variations are endless!!!!!!"
"3","5","I've made two batches so far...first was cherry cake/cherry frosting and then dipped in white chocolate. SUPER SWEET, but really good! As this was my first batch and I'm still a newbie, they aren't very pretty. But my co-workers (who are also my guinea pigs) loved them! Second batch was chocolate cake/chocolate frosting/1 cup of chocolate chips and dipped in chocolate bark (I'm calling these little guys 'death by chocolate'). I drizzled them with white chocolate...they looked awesome! Almost professional! These are my favorite out of the two batches so far. Third batch will be german chocolate cake/coconut pecan frosting and then dipped in chocolate bark with maybe a little coconut sprinkled on top. If you're a little wary of trying these, DON'T BE!!! I followed a lot of the reviewers ideas...the hand mixer idea was brilliant...as was the tip about refrigerating the mixture and then freezing the balls. I can't wait to give these out for Christmas gifts...they're awesome!"
"3","5","These were VERY EASY and QUICK. My family loved them. This is definitely a recipe I will tuck away and use again. I made a Betty Crocker cake recipe from scratch. I think that the store cake mixes would probably turn out a little better."
"3","5","This recipe is fantastic! I read the other reviews and froze the balls after i dipped them. Just an hour or two to set then I put them in the fridge. I melted shortening and semi sweet chocolate chips instead of using the bar of chocolate flavored confectioners coating."
"3","4","pros: tasty, unique, adaptable and fun cons: labor intensive and time consuming"
"3","5","YUM! Great to make eyeballs at halloween"
"3","5","Loved these!!! I made chocolate devils food cake and used a fudge chip frosting and coated them with semisweet chocolate chips melted with shortening. I then drizzled them with white chocolate and then I fell into a sugar coma....lololol...I refrigerated them when i mixed it with the frosting and then made the balls and placed them in the freezer for 2 hours and dipped them in the chocolate. They hardened beautifully and my MIL declared them to be the best theing she ever had! I also want to add that I brought them to my daughter's pre-k class for her birthday and they were gone in minutes! kinda like a yummy truffle. Thank you!!!!!!!!update: i recently made these and dipped them into wilton candy melts in different colors>>>>soooo much easier that melting chocolate and shortening!!! enjoy!"
"3","4","The instructions for this recipe are leaving out 1 key step, once you make your cake into balls, I put them in the freezer for an hour before dipping, otherwise they just fall off the toothpick. I recommend placing finished balls in the fridge for 20-40 mins before serving, but that's only if you have the same impatient family I do.."
"3","5","Amazing! Just made tese last evening to bring to my niece's bday party today and they were a HUGE hit. Used Buttery Chocolate Cake with 3 different variations for coating. Some w/white chocolate, Dark Chocolate & Caramel glaze. They were a hit w/all ages! This is a keeper and can't wait to play with different glazes for fall holidays & Christmas!"
"3","5","The first one I did red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and a almond bark coating. No one liked the almond bark much but they ate the cake out of the middle. Secondly, I did cherry chip cake with a milk chocolate frosting and a chocolate coating with regular chocolate chips. The coating was soft and needed to be refrigerated but everyone liked the taste and texture better. Maybe a 50/50 mix of candy coating and chips would be better?"
"3","3","These were just ok. I wish the insides were more solid than they were. They turned out nice and the guests liked them but I wasn't crazy about them."
"3","5","I made these into Cake Pops instead of Cake Balls. If you slide a lollipop stick into the FROZEN cake ball, it's super easy to roll around and coat in chocolate! Easy once you get a hang of it, they look impressive and taste delish."
"3","5","I LOVE these!! They taste amazing and are so fun to decorate! They easily adapt to any occassion or holiday :) Yes they're time consuming, but well worth it. I followed the recipe exactly (flavor wise - YUM!) but after I mixed the frosting and cake together, I put the 'batter' in the fridge for a few hours. Once it was nice and cool, I rolled into balls (a little less than a tablespoon worth of batter). I lightly sprayed my hands with non-stick spray. I then put the balls in the freezer overnight. The next day, I used toothpicks and almond bark to dip. I stored the decorated balls in the freezer. Very impressive!"
"3","5","These are so good and easy. They look very impressive. It makes a lot, but they will disappear fast. Time consuming with the dipping. I kept mine in the freezer before dipping which helped. I have done several variations. Most recently I did a german chocolate cake and mixed it with homemade coconut pecan frosting. I dipped these in milk chocolate."
"3","5","The cake balls I made were german chocolate cake with pecan coconut frosting mixed in. Dipped in Bakers Semi Sweet Chocolate. There are a lot of steps and they are very time consuming to make, but they tasted awesome. Be sure to chill for quite awhile before serving. They were rich so we had a lot leftover. I served them to 8 adults and everyone ate about 3 to 5 each. Be sure to allow a lot of time for making these so you're not rushed. They tasted really good the second day, so next time I'll make them a day ahead."
"3","5","I made these earlier today. Milk chocolate cake, milk chocolate icing, and chocolate almond bark. Death by chocolate. Very rich, but very easy to make and satisfies a sweet tooth. I also sprinkled coconut over some of the cake balls. That was a hit. The only thing I would do differently next time is let them freeze for closer to two or even three hours. One didn't seem to be enough. Otherwise, these are delicious, simple, and different enough to be creative! Great idea, thanks!"
"3","4","These came out really good and my hubby can't wait for me to make them again. They are a bit time consuming, dipping them in the chocolate, but they are worth it. I let the cake cool before I added the frosting like another reviewer had suggested. These would make a great addition to my cookie trays I give out at Christmas."
"3","5","These are very sweet and rich. My recommendation is to let the cake/icing mixture chill in the refrigerator until it is cold. Only take half of the mixture out of the fridge while you are forming balls because once it starts warming up, it breaks apart easier. Once that batch is done, set it back in the refrigerator and then ball up the remainder. Store in the freezer overnight. I used those colored candy chocolate pieces that you find in craft stores for dipping. I don't have any good suggestions for dipping because mine didn't turn out very pretty. However, they tasted really good and people liked them."
"3","5","I've made these several times and they are NOT time consuming to make. The thing that takes the most time is letting them sit in the freezer overnight. This makes it so that the melted chocolate doesn't make the cake crumble when you're dipping. I love that you can make endless combinations of cakes and frostings."
"3","5","Don't be afraid to make these! After reading reviews about these being difficult to dip, I was afraid to attempt. These things usually end up a mess for me, however, they ended up working well. I waited over an hour to break up the cake with a hand mixer. The crumbled cake went in the refrigerator for over 4 hours (not a set time, I was just doing other things!) I then put the frosting (did not measure) in the crumbles until the mixture constitency resembled cookie dough. I used my Pampered Chef large scoop to make the balls and then rolled them in my hands. After all were rolled, they went in the freezer overnight. To dip, I melted Wilton candy chocolate coating, used two forks to move around and remove from bowl. After dipping, the balls went on wax paper, added sprinkles and done!"
"3","5","I don't like icing. So, I tried this making the summer jello cake (white cake with cherry jello poured over it), and cool whip instead of icing. I also didn't want a thick coating of chocolate, so I found a DIY recipe for magic shell, and dipped them in that. Since this type of cake is kept cold anyway, it worked great. Seriously, it was so hard not to eat a bunch of them. I also made a chocolate cake mixed with instant pudding (made according to box) and half a container of cool whip. I used white chocolate magic shell for the jello cake and regular chocolate magic shell for the chocolate pudding cake. The recipe I used for DIY magic shell is 1 cup coconut oil to 2 cups any kind of chocolate."
"3","4","First of all, the rest of my family really enjoyed these. However, since I made them, I couldn't give them a five star rating. I didn't have time to let the cake cool before mixing it with the frosting, but I did chill the balls for about an hour. However, getting a moderate amount of chocolate on them was so hard! By the time I had dipped a few balls, quite a bit of the chocolate was gone. I made it with Swiss chocolate cake mix and maple pecan frosting, which made it like a German chocolate cake. I thought it was a little too sweet, but again, I was the only one. If I made them again, I wouldn't bother dipping them in the chocolate. EDIT: I used up the leftover balls. Instead of dipping them entirely, I dipped only the top. It made it a lot easier, and it brought it down to the right sweetness level. Yummy."
"3","4","These were a HIT with my 4-year-old's friends for his birthday. I changed the recipe just slightly based on reviews and other friends' advice -- i baked a devils food cake (from a box) and used Duncan Hines classic chocolate frosting -- would have preferred from scratch, but ran out of time, but they still tasted SO GOOD. also used white/vanilla candy melts and melted them in a double boiler. This gave them a nice crunchy coating once they cooled, and if the candy hardened while working, I just reheated in the double boiler to melt again. Another change I made was to make them into 'cake pops' -- after rolling each ball, I inserted a lollipop stick and then dipped into the melted candy melts, then sprinkled with colorful sanding sugar. I just had to be careful and gentle when I shook off the excess candy coating so that they didn't slide down the lollipop stick. Perfect for a classroom of kids and giving them individual portions! And so cute! I bought styrofoam from a craft store (like for flower arranging) to allow the cake pops to cool and also display them. These are a great treat!"
"3","2","I don't know what happened in my kitchen last night that made me have to rate a nearly 5-star recipe with 2 stars. What can I say? These were a disaster. I made the balls as described, I even FROZE them because I knew they would fall apart and be a huge mess if not at least refridgerated before dipping. They were a MESS. They fell apart in the chocolate, it was impossible to keep them on a toothpick/fork/knife/spoon or basically any utensil in my kitchen. They crumbled into the melted chocolate and made a huge mess, I can't even believe I stayed up late to make them. I don't know what happened, but I will never make these again."
"3","5","Yumm-o. Lemon cake, cream cheese frosting, and vanilla candy coating!"
"3","5","This is such a fun recipe. I prefer using less frosting, about half a can, otherwise the mixture is too gooey. I also have experimented with many different flavors and just came up with a new one: cookie dough flavor. Prepare a 'butter recipe' yellow cake mix. Cool and crumble. For the frosting, mix 8 oz cream cheese with about one cup of brown sugar and 2 tsp vanilla extract until very smooth. Add 1/2 a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Mix with cake crumbs. Form into balls and freeze. Dip in chocolate candy melts. This tastes exactly like cookie dough but no worries about raw egg!"
"3","5","Even my not-so-pretty ones turned out delicious. (: They did dry very quickly, so I'd suggest that if you want to add sprinkles, do so immediately after you dip them. Wonderful!!! (:"
"3","5","This is awesome. I used devil's food chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting. To save time, I wrapped in plastic wrap and placed is frezzer for 30 minutes. Then shaped into 30 large balls, then sliced them in half. I unfortunately didn't have a melon baller, but they turned out perfect. Refreezing before dipping helped set the chocolate after dipping."
"3","4","I made these for a potluck with high hopes- the recipe I found was for 'red velvet truffles' (sounds a little more appealing than a cake ball, doesn't it?) They were a little hard to form into balls, and some fell apart in the white chocolate coating making them a little funky looking- the white coating had red velvet chunks. I had better luck with a milk chocolate coating. The mush is the result of over-mixing. I used my hands, not a mixer. They are VERY rich- I noticed everyone taking one bite and handing them off to their significant other. That said, I made them and gave them to friends, and one friend in particular is STILL talking about them 9 months later! He said I could sell them. So- to each their own!"
"3","5","This recipe is awsome! It is best made with carrot cake and cream cheese frosting...yummy! Thanks for postin it!"
"3","5","OMG! We loved these! I'm always looking for cute creative ways to out-do all my mom friends, and I found it! Just kidding, but these were awesome. I made them into cake pops, put them in decorative bags, and my daughter gave them out on V-Day. I do recommend freezing the balls as it will help to make the Wilton's candy coating set faster and you will avoid drips. I stuck the sticks in right after freezing but before dipping. I used a cake/cookie cooling rack to hold the pops in place while they dried, to avoid any flat parts. They tasted as good as they looked! Thanks!"
"3","1","I was not impressed with this recipe at all. I have made recipes that require dipping in baker's chocolate before, but this was a disaster. The cake balls totally fell apart, which ruined the melted chocolate. On top of that, I decided a store bought cake mix and store bought frosting didn't even merit me trying to save it...flavor was nothing special."
"3","5","My father-in-law HATES cake, but he devours these every time I make them. My husband always complains about their being too sweet, but that's only because he eats them before they have a chance to cool. I usually make these in the evening and start eating them the next day. (Sometimes even for breakfast, oh no!) I tried hubby's method of eating them while still warm, and I could see his point--they are WAY too sweet when still warm. I don't know how that works, I just know it's true. That's okay; the anticipation of waiting for them just makes them that much sweeter--figuratively speaking, of course. :) I don't keep chocolate bark on hand, so I always wind up using chocolate morsels. I wonder if that's why my cake balls always have a little puddle of chocolate they sit in? I keep hoping I can make them perfectly round like some of the other submitters' photos show, but my chocolate can't defy gravity like their super secret formulas apparently can. Oh well, they are still deeeeeeeee-lish! This last time I made them I used a yellow cake mix, divided the batter, and dyed one cake green and the other pink just to make them more fun for my kids to eat. Thanks, Allison!"
"3","5","I let the cake totally cool, added 3/4 of a can of icing, refrigerated overnight, and then froze for a few hours before coating - they come out awesome!"
"3","5","I made these for a family event and got rave reviews! I learned a few tricks: definately make sure the cake is completely cool before adding the frosting, i used a T cookie scoop to make the balls and froze them on a cookie sheet for about an hour, and a fork worked the best to dip with (2 spoons made a thick bark layer)."
"3","5","This is a terrific recipe. After a couple of attempts at different flavors.... chocolate with chocolate is the most popular. A couple of tweeks to the recipe are: I used my own recipe for a no egg chocolate cake (very dense and chocolaty). After the cake cooled slightly, pour in the melted chocolate frosting. Shaped the chocolate balls (approx 45 to 50) and placed them on a cookie sheet lined w/wax paper and frozed them for a minimum of 3 hours (sometime overnight). I used two (2) bags of Candy Melts 14 Ounces / Pkg-Light Cocoa, from craft store AC Moore or Michaels and melted them over a double boiler. Once the chocolate is melted thoroughly, I dropped in three to four cake balls at a time in the chocolate and used to two plastic forks to swirl to coat them and place them on a separate cookie sheet lined with wax paper. I let them air dry for at least 3 hours. Sometime if you've shaped the cake balls too big, the chocolate will crack but not often. The intense chocolate favor incredible! I've never been able to eat more than one! : ) Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","4","I'm the only person on the planet who could ruin this recipe. Definitely cut the frosting in half. It's way to liquid-y. Somehow I didn't do the almond bark right. It's too thick. So I have a 1/8th inch shell of armor around cake soup. Still delicious, but bleh. They're disgusting!"
"3","1","I tried these and they tasted like uncooked cake dough. I took them to a Christmas luncheon and as soon as they took one bit they never took another."
"3","5","These were relatively easy and very tasty! The filling is very airy and light. I used lemon cake mix, buttercream frosting (with some additional lemon juice), and white chocolate confectioners coating. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and waited for about 15 minutes before crumbling the cake- I also used an electric mixer to blend the frosting and the cake crumbs. I then froze the balls for about an hour, and they were a very manageable consistency when I dipped them into the white chocolate."
"3","4","These are very versitile and easy to make! A great recipe to use for many different holidays and occasions."
"3","4","OMG! So good! I used cherry chip cake, cream cheese icing and semi sweet chocolate to coat. I ended up with like 50 balls though, and I needed WAY more chocolate to coat. Anyone else have that problem? I followed someone elses suggestion, let it cool a bit, used a hand mixer to blend in the icing, put it in the fridge, formed the balls, froze them and then dipped the frozen balls in chocolate. Very yummy. Topped them with multi colored non pariels :) Thanks! Sister dumped her boyfriend just minutes before entering the house and there they were...make a great breakup snack aparently lol"
"3","5","I made these cake balls for Thanksgiving and when I arrived with them, my aunt made some too! It was funny! :) Anyway, I made mine with a yellow cake and vanilla frosting and coated them with white and chocolate coating. I dipped them in crushed oroes, pecans, and spinkles. Everyone loved them!!! I thought they were good, but I am a chocolate fan. My aunt made hers with chocolate cake and chocolate frosting. Then dipped in white and reg. chocolate. Those were so good! UPDATE! I wanted to make cake balls for my husbands work party and didn't have cake mix.... So, I made brownies and made them the same way as regular cake balls. I made chocolate brownies with chocolate frosting and white and chocolate coating. They taste really good! I would definetly try to make them. They are a great hit! I will be making these often!!!"
"3","1","I used devils food and baked a little longer to make sure it was a little dry. Added choc frosting and came to a nice thick dough. I also froze them, but they never became solid and were still leaving crumbs in the almond bark so I can't imagine trying to dip them right away. Also, 3 oz is like 2 1/2 squares, no where near enough. I thinned out the chocolate w/ several T. shortening and still used nearly the entire package. The time is also very wrong, no way that you're done in an hour. The taste is okay, very sweet of course. But since there are so many other problems with this recipe as written, I don't feel that any more stars are deserved. Sorry."
"3","4","I made this recipe exactly as requested. Once I was done and ate some of them the balls were slightly mushy. I made a batch again and this time around after making the balls I froze them overnight before dipping in chocolate. This perfected my recipe. The consistency is what cake balls should be - a little firmer - almost brownie like. I made chocolate almond (mix almond extract in chocolate icing) and I made chocolate penut butter (mix penut putter in icing) they are both wonderful. This recipe does take some time - but definitly well worth it. This one is definitly a keeper!"
"3","2","I followed the directions for the most part. I used 1/2 a can of frosting. These were way too time consuming and not that great. The inside was so mushy.. it reminded me of thick cake batter. I tried freezing them afterward,hoping it would somehow help..No luck."
"3","5","This was a great concept and it was really good. I made two types of cakes. One was yellow cake with chocolate frosting and they came out ok. Then i made red velvet with cream cheese frosting and it soooooo so good. They are time consuming but worth the time and fun to make. I find freezing them for 20 mins once molded helps keep them together when dipping."
"3","5","Absolutely sinful!! I've made these a few times using different flavors... one of favs was cherry chip cake with chocolate coating.. YUM!"
"3","4","This is a good recipe, but the tips that other reviewers made actually make it even better. 1. Allow the sheet cake to cool for a while so that it is not hot to touch, or the dough will get too sticky. 2. You don't need an entire container or frosting - I used about 2/3 of the bottle. 3. Chill the balls for at least 2 hours before dipping 4. You can use any chocolate plus a few tablespoons of crisco for the coating I think this would be fantastic made with lemon cake mix, lemon icing, and white chocolate. I'm going to try that next."
"3","5","DO let cake cool a bit before rolling. DO freeze the cake balls before dipping. DO NOT use that gross almond bark/confectioner's bar, USE YOUR FAVORITE CHOCOLATE! You will be happy you did."
"3","5","This is so easy and you can mix it up with different flavors of cake and icing. Everyone thinks these are so impressive when you bring them to a function"
"3","5","Made cake lollipops for my son's 13th birthday and he LOVED THEM...I followed the instuctions but used another tip I heard about and added lollipop sticks to them and popped them in the freezer to harden the chocolate and bam they were done....I used Chocolate cake/ chocolate frosting & chocolate melts...(what can I say he loves chocolate.)....I will definately be trying different variations of this one....YUMMY....."
"3","5","great (& easy) recipe! Definitely follow others' suggestions and let the cake cool completely before crumbling. then roll into balls and place in the freezer for about an hour before dipping in chocolate."
"3","5","Family loved them, I made them at Christmas and they were a hit with the whole family, even my husband. He normally does not like sweets, but loved this. I made with yellow cake and chocolate icing. Will try with red velvet next time."
"3","5","YUM! these were easy and DELICIOUS! i got tons of compliments on them and cant wait to make them again! i did one batch with strawberry cake, cream cheese frosting, dipped in white chocolate. the second batch was butter cake, caramel frosting, dipped in milk chocolate! i chilled them before dipping, and i poked each one with a skewer and dipped them in the chocolate. this dipping method worked mest for me"
"3","2","Sorry, I really tried to love them, the whole idea is cute and most of the photos made them look delicious. Don't understand what everyone is raving about, save the time and effort and just frost the cake."
"3","5","These are absolutely amazing and look so professionally made! I do recommend chilling the dough before balling it and then re-chilling the balls before dipping (they tend to hold their shape better come out of the chocolate much easier :)"
"3","5","These were easy and tasty not a mess I would recommend using a mini scoop and making sure it was packed firm do a bunch and then roll them into balls. I did use 1/2 can frosting so they weren't to sticky and let the cake cool I didn't even have to refrigerate the balls before dipping since the were solid. Start to finish it took me less than 2 hours. It does take more coating than the recipe calls for."
"3","5","I find that these require a lot of work, but they're SO worth it. It's such fun to come up with different decoration ideas. If you do a search for 'Bakerella,' you'll find her blog where she creates all kinds of designs for cake balls (including some of those in the pics posted with this recipe, which are adorable)."
"3","5","OMGOODNESS these were wonderful. I followed all of LEXI70 useful tips and they turned out perfectly. I left them in the freezer until they were all eaten, which made them even better!"
"3","1","I was so excited to make these because there were so many great reviews, but I was VERY disappointed. Concentrated cake from a box does not a great truffle make. I used chocolate cake and icing, and it made a great textured center. I dipped in Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with chopped Andes mints. I love eating the outsides of these truffles, but once I get to the center it overwhelmingly tastes like salt and a little like preservatives and processed food. It is a great concept, though, and I think I'll try making a home-made cake and frosting (with reduced salt) truffle sometime."
"3","5","Bravo to all the creative members for their reviews and photos! I learned that anyone's favorite dessert can be replicated with cake balls. I've done chocolate covered strawberries with strawberry cake/strawberries and cream frosting and dark chocolate coating. I've done 'Thin Mints' with milk chocolate cake/milk chocolate frosting/3 tsp peppermint extract and Andes mint chips as the coating. My next experiment will be lemon cake/lemon frosting and vanilla coating for the lemon lover in the family and a german chocolate cake ball. The fridge has been my friend through each of the steps. Let it be yours too."
"3","3","I think this recipe is overrated. I used one can of frosting and thought these were way too sweet even though i think not using the whole can would have nad an adverse effect on the texture. I let the cake cook about 50% before adding the frosting and then i froze the balls for an hour before coating them. It took about 1.5 bags of choc chips to get all the balls coated (i ended up with about 45 balls) I added some shortening to the milk chocolate in order to thin it out a bit. Also, to get the green color i sued the Wilton's paste food colorings. For the oranage streaks i added some veggie oil to the chocolate mixture so that it would easily 'flick' off the fork as i quickly shook it over the balls. They were cute but very sweet."
"3","2","I gave the recipe 2 stars for 2 reasons: 1) The recipe worked as written and the end result of the recipe was, in fact, a 'cake ball' so there weren't any inherent problems there; and 2) My husband and my brother both liked the cake balls although they wanted them to be bite size."
"3","2","I made these at Christmas and had a mess.....then I read the reviews and tips about refrigerating them, and using toothpicks for dipping....wished I had read them first. I am going to try it again because they look wonderful and there are so many good reviews I think I need more practice."
"3","5","SOOOOOO RICH! These were absolutely AMAZING! And I can't believe how simple the recipe is! I baked a batch of chocolate and a batch of strawberry cake/frosting. I attempted to coat with candy-coating (aka almond bark) but found that chocolate chips with shortening worked ten times better! **1 C Chips to 2 tsp shortening** Can't wait to try again with different flavors of cakes, frosting, and toppings!"
"3","1","I was really excited to make and decorate these. But..they were just not for me. My family didn't enjoy them either. Something about the texture... can't really put my finger on it. They just really grossed me out. As soon as I bit into one I wished I hadn't crumbled up that yummy cake. At least they looked cute!"
"3","5","These were a HIT! I read the reviews carefully. I made the cake (a white cake mix) as directed, and let the cake cool. I broke it up and mixed in chocolate frosting and refrigerated it overnight. Actually, I was so busy that I let it sit in the fridge until late afternoon the next day! I rolled them in balls, put them in the freezer for an hour or so, and then dipped them in either melted chocolate or white chocolate. I bought those Baker's tubs that you melt in the microwave, and used toothpicks to dip them in and out. I drizzled leftover melted chocolate (both colors) over them, and put them back in the freezer. Once they set, I put them in foil mini cupcake liners. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe!"
"3","1","I planned on giving these away for Christmas treats, but they were too much work and tasted awful! They were so mushy. Sorry. I really wanted to like it."
"3","5","What a delightfully easy and incredibly versatile way to shake up a boring cake recipe! I used a German chocolate cake mix and added chopped pecans and flaked coconut to the batter before baking. I then mixed in caramel frosting and dipped them in milk chocolate and drizzled white chocolate over them. I also made a carrot cake mix and added walnuts to the batter before baking, then mixed in cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate. I did take the advice of others and waited about 10 minutes to 'scrape' the cake after it was baked and I cut the edges off because they were a little too overcooked and didn't break down as easily. I didn't use the entire container of frosting because I found the consistency to be sticky enough after about 3/4 of the container. I let the cake balls cool to room temperature and then refrigerated them for a couple of hours before dipping them to make them easier to handle. I cannot wait to try new versions of this fun and easy recipe!!!"
"3","5","These were so good! I made as recipe stated. I mixed it right from the oven and had no problems. Mix well so no dry ingredients remain. I hand rolled the balls first and got 40 out of the mix. Once I got those done I melted my chocolate wafers in the microwave. Instead of the toothpick(that didn't work for me) I just used a spoon and rolled each ball into the chocolate,scooped it up with a fork and let excess drip off and put onto wax paper. It does set up fast so I did 5 balls at a time and then decorated them. Just make sure you get enough chocolate to cover all the balls. If you use the wafers I'd suggest at least 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds of chocolate wafers. I made mine with spice cake with french vanilla frosting and chocolate with chocolate frosting. I'd like to try carrot cake next time with cream cheese frosting. You can go crazy with any kind of flavors! Have fun and enjoy!"
"3","1","This recipe was most disappointing. I used red velvet cake with cream cheese icing-what a gooey mess-I waited 4 hours for cake to cool before adding the icing! Rolled the mixture into small balls and froze for about 2 hours. I had no trouble melting the chocolate and creating the finished product. They looked very nice. My husband then took a bite out of one and didn't finish it. I should have read all reviews first. Someone else said 'it was a gooey disaster and tasted like prechewed food'-boy were they right. What a waste of time and money."
"3","5","I give these 5 stars because they are very simple to make, and even a novice can do this and have an absolutely gorgeous presentation. I only half coated mine, it made life simpler. And, the one batch was store bought cake and frosting, the other batch was both from scratch. They are equally good, but I would definitely take the step of refrigerating before shaping, otherwise they won't be as round, and freeze before dipping, just to make it easier and less messy for you."
"3","1","my wife and i were most disappointed with this recipe. i believe that the recipe needs to be more specific about what kinds of chocolate are most suitable for melting to the degree that it is able to act as a proper dipping agent and what specific techniques work best for most effective melting (our attempt at melting white chocolate chips in a double-boiler resulted in a thick and paste-like mess). i don't deny that many users have had good results and i reckon that by experimenting more we might get better results. that said, a good recipe should be clear and specific enough that it is essentially 'idiot-proof'. this recipe falls far short in that regard."
"3","2","I apparently am not a candy maker! I couldn't get the chocolate to stay smooth no matter what temperature I put it at, the cake and icing kept falling apart even after freezing and the ones that did get dipped oozed cake out of the chocolate for some reason. And I wasn't very impressed with the flavor either."
"3","5","The great thing about this recipe is that the possibilities are endless! Some tips, though: 1. Let the cake cool before crumbling. 2. Freeze the cake balls before dipping. I freeze mine for about an hour, or until solid. Freeze again after dipped. Mine tend to 'sweat' after they've been in the freezer, so it's also good to make them ahead of time and either dip them later or keep dipped cake balls in the freezer until ready to serve.  I've made these once so far and used Betty Crocker's super moist chocolate fudge cake and caramel frosting. I sprinkled some of the balls with chopped pecans. They taste like brownie balls and they're *so* good! Next up: Peppermint & white chocolate cake balls."
"3","5","These are AWESOME!! I will make every year! I made the choc. cake/choc. frosting & added a bag of Andes Candies bits while still warm (suggested by a reviewer) and they are THE BEST!! Also made the german choc. cake/coconut pecan frosting then rolled in pecans - these were not AS good but still ok. I was a little hesitant to use the Almond Bark as opposed to real chocolate but am so glad I did - it sets so much faster and tastes just as good as the real stuff - also easier to dip than real choc. One tip: Don't refigerate after dipping - they will sweat and then turn sticky when you take them out. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!"
"3","5","Look no further....this is the fun, different, easy and yummy dessert you are looking for! The cake balls are a hit with every atmosphere and age level! My only recommendation....only use 1/4 to 1/2 of rom temp frosting. Otherwise you cake will turn to mush and then you will have mush balls. Ya, they do take some time...but they are fun and easy to do."
"3","1","I want to coat the balls with melted choc. chips, but I can't get the consistency good for dipping. I microwave a cup on high for 1 min. and add 1 tsp. oil, but it still comes out very thick."
"3","4","I'm going to make these a little smaller next time. They were really good, but I think smaller means you can eat faster :)"
"3","3","I must preface this by saying I hate dipping things in chocolate. It's just so tedious.  I use only real chocolate, which I presume is thicker than the confectioners stuff which is loaded with trans fats. That being said, if you use real chocolate for this recipe, you need more like 30 ounces instead of three.  For all the work of dipping, I didn't think these were worth the effort. If I am going to dip, I will make something decadent like truffles."
"3","5","This is such a versatile recipe that you can't mess it up! I used a spice cake mix and instead of a can of frosting, I used gingerbread flavored Coffee Mate and then dipped the balls in white chocolate coating. YUMMY!! The crumbled cake does not have to be mucky to form into balls. Just add enough of the frosting or flavored creamer to make the crumbs moist enough to form into balls. Have fun with this and use your imagination!"
"3","5","This is one of my favorite recipes and always a hit when I make it. The two most favorite flavors for those I've made it for are the Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Frosting and Strawberry Cake and Frosting. I always use the chocolate almond bark (candy coating), but I'm betting the white coating would be good as well. Also, after mixing the cake and frosting together, definitely put in the refrigerator for about an hour. Makes it much easier. And I just toss a couple of the balls into the melted chocolate then roll them around and fish them out with a fork.  I originally found this recipe under the name Cake Bites and using chocolate chips for the coating. The candy coating works so very much better."
"3","5","Fabulous recipe! Used devil's food cake, chocolate frosting and melted 2 big dark chocolate candy bars with a couple tsp of shortening for the coating. Froze the balls and held them on a toothpick over the bowl of chocolate and poured the chocolate over with a spoon until coated so I didn't get crumbs in the remaining chocolate. They looked beautiful. Eat them frozen...they are fantastic!"
"3","5","These are WONDERFUL! I did follow some of the reviews and chilled the balls first. They make wonderful gifts!"
"3","5","I made these last christmas and they were a huge hit. Can be time consuming, but definately worth it. There are many different variations and you can be very creative with sprinkles, coconut, or drizzling colors. Perfect gift and they fit nicely in candy boxes with a bow. I will make them every year for sure. Thanks"
"3","1","Mine didn't turn out at all. They wouldn't hold their shape in order to dipped. Ended up making a mess so I just pressed the cake in a pan and poured the chocolate on top. Tasted fine, but I wouldn't make it again because I couldn't get them into balls."
"3","5","These are a huge hit with my 3 teenagers and I think every single on of their 100 friends. This is the 3rd weekend in a row that I have made double batchs of them. I did exactly as the recipe reads and they come out perfect every time. I cooled the cake for about 5 minutes just enough so that I don't burn my hands when crumbling the cake. I did take the advice to put them in the fridge before I roll them. It makes it that much easier to handle. I have put them in their for an hour and as long as 5 hours. I rolled them out and put them on parchment paper and they didn't stick. This is a keeper for sure and can't wait to try some other varities. Thank you for a great recipe."
"3","3","Pretty good, but there are a few things I would change to meet my own preference. Put less frosting in the cake so it is more cake-y. And I would use actual chocolate instead of almond bark. It is just too fake."
"3","5","My neighbor told me about this recipe two years ago. I tried it for my son's 2nd grade Christmas party and have been asked to bring them every year since. I even have special requests from family to make sure cake balls are at all family functions. I am looking forward to trying the different combinations mentioned in the other reviews. These make great bake sale items if placed in individual baggies and use a twist tie in seasonal colors or school colors."
"3","3","Was not as great as some of the reviews state. I am not a fan of canned icing...that was all I tasted. Another recipe calls for a bag of Oreos and a block of cream cheese 'mushed' together. It had a better taste than the cake idea in this recipe."
"3","4","These are really nummy!! I used french vanilla cake mix with only 1/2 tub chocolate frosting. I coated them with semi sweet chocolate. They are VERY sweet, but taste like a choco covered donut hole, mmm!! I made the cake, let it cool for 30 mins, mixed it with the frosting with my Kitchen Aid...I rolled into balls using a cookie scoop and then froze for 1 hr. Then I melted semi sweet choco (1 lb!!!) with 2.3 tsps shortening.   Next time I make them I would add some cherry juice or some extract to the cake mix. Also, I would like to find something to dip them into that is not so sweet.   Thanks so much!! Great recipe!!"
"3","5","We LOVE these in my family! We've tried many variations: 1) dark choc cake/choc icing 2) white cake/strawberry icing/white almond bark (tastes like capt crunch berries!!) 3) german choc cake/choc icing 4) lemon cake/white icing/white almond bark  They're all fantastic!! Try to freeze them over night before you dip them. We use two forks to dip them in the almond bark...the excess chocolate runs through the tines. GOOD LUCK!"
"3","1","Wow, these were really unappetizing. They were mushy, sweet blobs. I guess I was expecting a different texture. My kids didn't even like them."
"3","5","Loved these!!! I had no problems making them and the taste was out of control. I used chocolate cake and milk chocolate frosting.....and by the way, I used only enough frosting to bind the mixture.....way easier to handle.I used a small cookie scoop to form the balls and then I rolled each one. Froze them for over an hour. I dipped in milk chocolate chips, white chips, and Reeses PB chips. Cant wait to try again with different flavors. A big hit at a party we went to last night!"
"3","5","takes time but it's worth it"
"3","5","My 12 yr old daughter found this recipe and made them. They were messy and time consuming and she was getting frustrated dipping them in the chocolate. I suggested mixing some powdered sugar and milk to make a glaze. They came out great and was much faster. They taste like chocolate glazed donuts!! VERY YUMMY. We will skip the chocolate dip next time. Gotta go clean my kitchen now!! YIKES"
"3","5","Yummy!!!"
"3","5","These are just too delicious!! I thought instead of making a birthday cake for myself today I'd make cake balls. Yes, they are time consuming and a little messy. I used a 10 oz bag of white chocolate chips which didn't go far at all. I then used chocolate chips and they didn't go far. Wound up rolling more than half of them in powdered sugar. They were just as good if not better than the ones I 'frosted'. And much easier! I didn't find any of them gooey or messy inside. We both thought of them as 'cake-like'. Just as moist as a regular cake. The only problem with these is that they're disappearing at a much faster rate than a cake."
"3","5","Ahhhh...now this hits the sweet tooth! Try keeping the cake balls out of your mouth during the frosting process! I ate enough to give me a stomach ache! Ha! I made these for a friends birthday which is on St. Patty's day. I used a white cake mix with white frosting and added a tsp. almond extract and some green food coloring. I used white and chocolate almond bark and also dyed some white bark with green food coloring and used some green sprinkles. Getting them 'frosted' was a little time consuming but they turned out delicious! Watch out though...kind of like those 'mini' candy bars and how you think it's okay to eat like 10 of them...same thing here!"
"3","2","I had high expectations after reading all the reviews and hearing people on the exchange talk about these. Quite sure I didn't do anything wrong...there is not much you could do to mess up this recipe. The end result of mixing the frosting with a warm cake was just mush. I thought it might be better after I froze the balls for a couple hours (as suggested by other reviewers as to be easier to work with - which they were), but not the case. After the white chocolate coating hardened...and you bit through the hard shell into that doughy, mushy center - yuck, there was no way I was sending these along to work with my husband. I have a good reputation amongst his coworkers as being a pretty good baker...but these balls would have changed their minds pretty quickly."
"3","4","The taste was amazing and everyone loved them! The only reason this got a 4 star is because the almond bark got crumbs in it and it looked funky. I had to freeze the next batch after I balled them up and be very careful when they get dipped. Otherwise a huge hit for anywhere!"
"3","4","Ok, this is a hard one to review. The recipe is sound and it works. That being said it is a major PAIN! Don't make this unless you really want to spend a couple of hours in your kitchen. I made the cake, crumbled it and combined it with the frosting with no problem. I decided to try to roll it with a melon baller and that just scooped a tiny bit and pushed the rest of it around. Since that didn't work I decided to use my cookie scoop. It worked like a charm but they weren't as rounded as I would like and because they will retain their shape after they are coated I decided to roll them a little smoother. I popped it back in the freezer to solidify a little before I coated them. I dipped them in melted milk chocolate chips and drizzled them with white chocolate. I give 4 stars because this recipe is exactly what it promises to be but the taste isn't worth the work."
"3","5","OMG. this recepie was WONDERFUL!!!. So simple and easy.. My sister and I made this for valentines day to bring to school. EVERYONE LOVED THEM!!. My teachers asked for the recipe. If you decorate them nicely and put them in a fancy box, people would think they were Godiva chocolates or somehting.  to save calories and mess, we only dipped the tops of the balls in chocolate."
"3","5","Wow! These TASTE amazing! Presentation wasn't so great, but w/a little practice I'm sure it will improve. I used Devil's food cake w/vanilla buttercream icing. I tossed some in 10X sugar and coated the rest in melted baking Hershey's kisses (I didn't have any bark or desire to go to the store). Awesome. I will continue to play w/various flavors and presentation methods! Yum, yum."
"3","2","These are WAYYYY to sweet."
"3","4","After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try the white cake w/fun fetti frosting. Thanks to many of the reviewers' suggestions I did take my cake right from the oven shredded it with two forks and stirred in the frosting. I then placed in the fridge overnight. After rolling into balls, I placed in the freezer for 1 hour. I melted white bark and chocolate bark. I didn't get throught the entire batch without placing back into the freezer to keep the balls from getting mushy. I can't imagine not putting them there and trying to dip them! I dipped using a tooth pick and it still was somewhat tricky not to get chocolate on your fingers after dipping the balls and trying to get them onto cookie sheet/wax paper. These do take alot of time to prepare and glad I did it over 2 days. They looked really nice on my cookie trays! I decided at the last minute to take a fork and drizzle them in opposite colors. They are sweet, no wonder the kids gobble them down. I will try lemon combination next. We call the 'CAKE BITES' in our house!"
"3","2","I love to bake but this is way to much work for the outcome there are a lot more easier recipes to work with!! Dont say I didnt warn you. My outcome was like Little Debbies with Choc with choc combo."
"3","5","Excellent, fun, relatively easy recipe. I made chocolate cake, buttercream icing, and dark chocolate coating - they are very rich but delicious. I decorated the tops red & green for Christmas, using a 'candy writer' tube. I had to go to my local cake supply to get the coating, but that was not a big deal. I followed many of the other reviews and broke the cake up straight from the oven, then let it sit in the fridge. i used my hands to roll them and dip them, very messy. I will experiment with some other dipping methods next time. Will make this again, can't wait to experiment!! Thanks to the author for sharing."
"3","5","I made these for a bake sale and they were a hit. They were the first item to sell out and I had such reviews as 'It is so good I feel inappropriate.'   I couldn't find the baking chocolate that the recipe recommended, so I used a bar of baking chocolate and some chocolate chips (after my bar ran out). It does make a thicker outside layer than the recipe recommends, but it was still delicious. The baking bar did have a much smoother consistency than the chips, but the chips were cheaper.  Also my top seller was a 'fun-fetti' cake ball. Instead of using fun-fetti cake, I used plain white cake and the fun-fetti frosting. If you want to do fun-fetti, that is the way to go."
"3","3","These were tasty but took waaaaaay too long to coat. I used devil's food cake with chocolate frosting and coated in melted chocolate chips mixed with a little veggie oil to thin. The cake/frosting balls were good as-is, without the chocolate coating - especially if you keep them in the freezer. I might make these again, but would just drizzle some chocolate over the cake/frosting balls rather than tediously dipping and coating each one. I ended up with about 50 balls from one cake mix."
"3","5","These are the best little things that I have ever made. It was easy and fun to experiment with different cakes. The best one is chocolate fudge with chocolate frosting!!! People couldn't believe that I made them....they all thought I bought them at a bakery. Thanks...AWESOME!!"
"3","5","I love this recipe!!! I have made it soooooo many time since I found it. I've made them with orange cake mix and cream chese icing dipped in chocolate. Next time im trying strawberry cake mix."
"3","5","people are begging me to make these again. They are very good but alittle time consuming. Freezing them before rolling them in chocolate is great idea. Takes way more chocolate than 3oz."
"3","5","YUM! Used carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, dipped in white almond bark- took a lot more than 3 oz. though. Freezing the formed cake balls for an hour or so before dipping made it super easy."
"3","5","Thanks for sharing this recipe and thanks everyone for the helpful tips. Everything is absolutely true--these are yummy and make it easy to be creative. I used 2 skewers to pick up the balls when dipping and didn't waste much almond bark. I look forward to making them for other occasions too--and I've been sharing the recipe all around."
"3","5","I tried these for a Christmas party. I am known for bringing wonderfully unique recipes and this one did not fail me! I have used a German chocolate cake and icing vanilla and choc bark (wonderful), a red velvet cake, choc. icing, vanilla bark (wonderful!) and white cake, white frosting choc. bark (not my favorite). I am going to try orange and strawberry...I will let you know how it goes. You really need to let your cake balls cool in the refrigerator for a while, maybe even overnight. Makes them easier to dip. No wonderful secrets for ease of dipping...just maybe add a little shortening to the bark when melting. Seems to make the coating less lumpy. Red velvet in white bark left little red crumbs...but I decorated with stripes of choc bark...not as noticeable. These are really wonderful and relatively easy to make...!"
"3","3","These are really really sweet and rich, I could never eat more than one. I used chocolate cake with chocolate frosting."
"3","5","great recipe. A sure fire hit at any party!! Time consuming but worth it. Tip 1 : roll into balls and freeze overnight.The balls will get hard and easier to mess with. Plus, your chocolate that you dip the balls into will get very messy if the balls are not frozen. Your finished product will not have a smooth coating. It will be lumpy and full of crumbs. 2. Make sure that not even a drop of water gets into your dipping chocolate. It will ruin it and you'll have to start over. 3. Use an Easter egg dipper to dunk your cake balls. This is the least messy way to achieve an even coating. (bend a wire hanger) have fun with the kids. they love rolling the cake into balls."
"3","5","Made these for a shower. YUMMMMMM!!!! Used a 1' cookie scoop and got 4 dozen. Freeze until solid,very easy to handle."
"3","4","Very sweet! If you use the coconut pecan icing they almost taste like rum balls. The variations are endless. The kids and I had alot of fun making these."
"2","5","These were extremely easy to make and were unbelievably moist. I let the crumbled cake and frosting mixture cool in the refrigerator for several hours before using a cookie scoop/melon baller to make the balls. Also, I did not have much luck dipping the balls in the candy coating and ended up just pouring the coating on top of the balls. If you do it that way, you'll need quite a bit more of the candy coating, but it's much easier!"
"2","5","I made the cake like directed, but used instead water Kahlua."
"2","4","These taste good, but they're a major pain to make."
"2","5","Definitely chill the cake batter before dipping"
"2","3","I made them what a disaster. The balls worked out great, a little soft placed, in refrigeration for 2 hrs, melting chocolate was the task and dipping. they kept falling off so I put them in the freezer tried to dip but the choc was a mess never again try that . Next time I will melt the cake icing and pour over the balls and be done"
"2","5","Great recipe! I used Duncan's Dark Chocolate Fudge cake and mixed it with Pillsbury's Peppermint icing. Wonderful combination and I dipped some in white and others in chocolate coating. I did follow others advice and waited till the cake cooled to add frosting and then once mixed I refrigerated the mixture a few hours before making into balls and then refrigerated the balls a few hours before dipping them. Worked great!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! Only need 1/4 can of frosting. If you mix with your hands you'll know when the cake to frosting ratio is just right. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and washed my hands several times while making the balls. It definitely helped keep them in tact."
"2","5","This was an awesome idea! I used less icing, that's the only 'modification' but they turned out delicious! I added a photo of them. I drizzeled white icing over the vanilla cake, and fudge icing over the chocolate cakes to tell them apart."
"2","4","Made these today for a cookout we were having with some neighbors, everyone liked them. I used chocolate cake and chocolate icing then dipped them in white chocolate and put some sprinkles on top. I was short on time but I think next time once the cake is crumbled and the icing mixed in I would refrigerate the mixture for a couple hours before rolling it will roll nicer and probably not have as many crumbs in the chocolate...I would even refrigerate again after they are rolled. I used a silpat on a cookie sheet and the chocolate covered balls came off very nice."
"2","4","Awesome cake balls! I do completely agree that you have to freeze the balls prior to dipping. I had a hard time with the chocolate dipping but they tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","Wow! Very good! They were very labor intensive for my standards. I used strawberry cake, vanilla frosting and white chocolate on some. Some I used chocolate and they tasted just like chocolate cherries. I would make these again for a special occasion or holiday."
"2","5","Time consuming but overall very easy to make! I used 1/2-3/4 of frosting and the consistency was perfect. I chilled them in the fridge before dipping them in almond bark. They were a huge hit at a Christmas party. Thanks for the easy instructions!!"
"2","5","My 9 year old Grandson Braxton made these for Christmas and they were outstanding. Could not keep from eating one after another Gonna some to have ready to dip in bark. Etta"
"2","3","I was very disappointed in the result. I made two batches for Christmas. One with a butter yellow cake, cream cheese frosting and vanilla candy coating dip. The other was a dark chocolate cake mix with coconut pecan frosting (German chocolate frosting) dipped in semi-sweet chocolate. In the end I had a lot of mediocre balls on my hands. Dipping anything is a lot of work. I wished I had made the Oreo Truffles or Buckeyes instead."
"2","1","There are few recipes that I can't make work. This recipe is a bit of a mess, and it tastes exactly like a cake from a box. Save yourself some time and make some cupcakes with a great cake recipe."
"2","2","A lot of work and not very good. Maybe another recipe would work better, but this one was a waste of cake, frosting and time."
"2","1","I knew when I saw 'canned frosting' in the recipe I would not like them. After two years I broke down and made the red velvet cake balls to take to a party tomorrow. Made 50. I did not care for them"
"2","5","This recipe deserves 5 stars. It is so easy and delicious, just time consuming. The last time I made them, it made about 80, so its definately a treat to make for a large group. I do the chocolate cake, chocolate frosting and they taste like Hostess Ding Dongs!"
"2","5","amazing!"
"2","5","I made a strawberry in chocolate bark, vanilla in vanilla bark, chocolate in chocolate bark. Perfect in every way!"
"2","5","Made cake pops out of mine. Fabulous!"
"2","5","My family couldn't stop eating these."
"2","4","My family loved them. The kids said they tasted like Starbucks lollipops so next time we are putting them on lollipopsticks. Made them with Dunkin hinds golden cake and betty crocker whipped cream frosting. Used just 3/4 of the can of frosting. dipped them in melted white chocolate chips and used colored sprinkles to decorate."
"2","1","I had a marble cake that was a day old, some of it had icing and some didn't. I put it in the kitchenaid and mixed it up then added a small amount of soft icing. I hadnt gotten them into the freezer yet when my son and family came in and ate almost all of them, even without coating.  They were a little gooey but the kids didn't care, they loved them. I am going to make again and try to get the coating on them. Very good."
"2","3","I don't know what happened. These did not turn out as good as I had hoped. I followed the directions, and even cut the frosting in half, but it was still super sweet. I will try these again, because maybe it was my combinations of flavors. I made yellow cake with vanilla frosting, and even dipped some in milk chocolate... way too sweet, even with half of the frosting. The consistency wasn't too great either. It was almost as if it was already chewed... not exactly appetizing. On the bright side, they were really easy to make!"
"2","5","These were very good. I used homemade buttercream icing from this site for the cake balls. So much better with the homemade buttercream :) Can't wait to make these again."
"2","5","I too, refridgerated this 'dough' after combining the frosting with the cooled cake and added oreo cookie crumbs. Then I made the balls and put them back in the fridge for a couple more hours. Freezing may even be better as I found them getting soft and less easy to coat with the chocolate as they sat out. I ended up re-refridgerating the second half of the balls...but these are AMAZING!! I mixed red velvet cake with vanilla frosting (don't care for the taste of creme cheese frosting as most use with red velvet cake) and added about a quarter cup of crushed oreos. Covered them in the chocolate coating and sprinkled crushed oreos on top while still wet. Surprisingly, these-at room temerature-taste just like Hostess Ding Dongs...yummmmm!"
"2","1","If you like mushy, soggy cake goo, this is for you. I do not."
"2","4","I dont dip or coat these i just pipe the chocolate or icing on top. i recently made them for a chocolate fantasy potluck / contest and i won first place. this is a great way to make a very expensive looking dessert without breaking the bank or spending hours prepping. thanks for sharing this. p.s im going to make them for my daughters baby shower too."
"2","5","I use half a recipe of homemade frosting with a full cake recipe. I usually make these into lollipops. I mix the cake ( warm or cooled) and frosting and then form into balls and place in the freezer until hard-they dip very nicely then. My hubby and kids love them as does everyone at my work and my hubby's work. My favorite so far is red velvet with cream cheese frosting and white chocolate coating. Beautiful and tasty. Love this idea, thanks for posting"
"2","4","Take longer than you think, but really yummy!"
"2","4","Sort of difficult and messy but I loved these. Did red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and white chocolate coating and sprinkles."
"2","4","Following suggestions of others, I waited 1/2 an hour and then crumbled my cake. I did yellow cake with cream cheese frosting, dipped in chocolate. THANK YOU to whoever said to keep hands moist while rolling balls--that really helped! I also chilled my balls before dipping them, and that helped too. Just used a spoon to dip--created some pooling of chocolate, but overall much easier than a toothpick."
"2","5","The taste was good, I did have trouble rolling them, so please do listen to others who say to chill the cake before forming the balls. This is a good recipe to 'fix' a booboo in the kitchen, like forgetting about the cake in the oven while outside gardening! (Which is exactly what I did and it got a teensy bit too brown @ the edges!)"
"2","5","Really good-time consuming-WARNING: don't add liquid food coloring to almond bark-either add powdered coloring or best option is to use the chocolate melting chips from a craft store! Good luck!"
"2","5","I made this with Red Velvet Cake and Cream Cheese Icing. Dipped in milk chocolate and Pure White Belgium Chocolate sprinkled on top. It was to die for!!!"
"2","3","I think these would be better with homemade frosting. I never cared too much for store bought frosting."
"2","4","Yum! I made these yesterday with red velvet cake mix, cream cheese frosting, and dipped them in chocolate. They didn't turn out quite at pretty as the pictures, but they tasted good. I am giving this 4 stars because I refrigerated the dough before dipping into chocolate, and some fell apart during this process. I definitely recommend freezing overnight as most reviewers suggested. I will definitely do this next time, and yes, there will be a next time!"
"2","3","I have a major sweet tooth, but these were almost too sweet. Plus, despite chilling them over night, it was still difficult to keep them looking pretty in perfect ball shape and covered all the way with a smooth coating of chocolate. I'm sure there is no real flaw in the recipe itself though. I just don't plan on ever making these again."
"2","5","THESE ARE GREAT,BUT NOTHING NEW.I HAVE BEEN MAKING THESE FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS!!!!!. KNEW I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THE RECIPE OUT TO ANYONE!!! HAHAHA"
"2","5","I have made these a few times now and I find the best way is to freeze them overnight and dip them the next day."
"2","5","These are GREAT!! Everyone that eats them loves them and they are so handy. Take to any gathering. Better than having a single cake to tote, cut- and hope it is enough for everyone. So much neater to eat as well. Try the white cake, cream cheese icing, coconut flakes, white chocolate combo...yum."
"2","1","This is the first review I have written.   I had very high hopes for these. However the outcome was very dissatisfying. The dipping was excruciating as the balls no matter how small were too heavy for toothpicks. I will be deleting this from my recipe box. Good luck to those who attempt this."
"2","1","This did not work for me. I followed the directions and while dipping the balls into the chocolate, they completely fell apart. I would recommend mixing the cake with the frosting and refrigerating until firm, then making them into balls and dipping."
"2","5","I brought these to an event at my son's school. My husband went to grab one and they were already gone while many other treats were still remaining. They were fairly easy to make and taste delicious! I will definately make these again."
"2","5","I got a similar recipe from a friend and it was super. I called for the cake mix and 8 ounces cream cheese. Same directions. Bake the cake. Cool. Blend in cream cheese. Dip in confectioners coating. I used strawberry cake mix and white chocolate. YUM! Pretty too on my Easter table."
"2","4","I'm only giving 4 stars because the directions are bad! Why would you mix the icing in while the cake is still warm?  They were very good, yet time consuming to make! Everyone loved them."
"2","5","These are amazing, I have been making them for about a year, but here are my tips to make them better yes you can mix and match the cakes and frostings but I have found cream cheese frosting to work best, make the cake dump it in a bowl add the frosting and mix it in a bowl then let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight, then do your almond bark dipping the next morning just made them for easter strawberry cake with the cream cheese frosting and the milk choc, almond bark, then red velvet cake with the white choc almond bark they will be fantastic for Sunday"
"2","5","This is a very versatile recipe. I have made two different batches using Strawberry cake with Strawberry icing for one and using Lemon cake with lemon icing for the other. I used the vanilla almond bark and used pink and yellow icing die to die it and made cake balls to give the children in my family for Easter instead of candy. They were a hit and it was a lot less expensive too."
"2","5","Love this!!! It's so versatile that everyone will like some variation. I made two slightly different variations. I used a devil's food cake mix and fudge icing. In one half I added about 1/2 ounce of kahlua and dipped it in melted semisweet chocolate chips ( with a little oil mixed in). In the other half I mixed a little mint extract into the cake mixture, dipped the balls in the semisweet choc chips and then dipped them in aero mint chocolate bar crumbs that I processed in my mini chopper. I am taking them to my Rumoli group tonight and I'm sure they will be a big hit!!"
"2","5","I have made these several times. My favorites were the cherry chip w/cream cheese icing - half dipped in chocolate, the other in white chocolate.   I recently made banana cake with cream cheese icing and dipped in chocolate and put them around the base of my son's wedding cake. The Pastor took a couple home with him and the following Sunday told my mother they were so good I could sell them on the street for 20 bucks a piece lol.   They are wonderful and totally addicting!"
"2","4","I thought these were good, but everyone else raved about them. I think it is a great alternative if you screw up a cake, but I personally prefer my cake in it's intended form."
"2","5","time consuming... but well well well worth it!!!! I did strawberry supreme cake with buttercream icing. Then I dipped in a variety of dark, milk & white chocolate. Milk chocolate was definitely the best - but all were great!"
"2","5","Really good! but follow the other reviewers' instructions/recommendations. And dont eat too many like I did. they're so rich!"
"2","5","Can't go wrong here, though mine weren't as pretty as the pictures. I froze the cake balls before dipping in chocolate, but they still started disintegrating."
"2","4","These were really good and pretty easy to make! Myhusband says they taste like Hostess Cupcakes. Will definitley make them again."
"2","5","Love, love, love it. I used the half a can of frosting and they turned out so yummy. Everyone at worked asked for the recipe. Husband was mad that I took all the lemon ones to work."
"2","5","These are really good and not that difficult to make. The refrigeration/freezing steps are definitely helpful. I did not use an entire container of frosting. I'll definitely use candy melt instead of almond bark next time. The almond bark is too sweet and will take your head off!"
"2","5","Very easy and a huge hit."
"2","5","Time consuming, but yummy! Made some for my daughter's party at school and it was a hit! Can't wait to make it again!"
"2","5","Loved these and will be making them often and trying different combinations I am sure! Aside from cooling and refrigeration time I really didn't find these very time consuming. I let the cake cool for about 30-45 minutes, crumbled it by hand into a bowl, added about 1/2 a tub of frosting ( I think a whole one may be too sweet and make the cake mixture too gooey - just my opinion) and mixed by hand. I pressed these into rough ball shapes, refrigerated on a wax paper lined cookie sheet for about an hour. They may have needed a bit longer because some wanted to crumble if I tried to roll them into a ball. But I just pressed them into a ball with my fingers then refrigerated about 30 minutes more. I melted almond bark then mixed in about a half tablespoon of solid shortening to thin it some, rolled the balls in a bowl of the melted bark with a spoon and lifted out with a plastic fork and placed on wax paper. I also melted white almond bark (adding shortening again) and drizzled that over the chocolate coating using a fork. They look like something you would buy in a store!"
"2","5","Made them over the holidays and they were a hit with everyone, will make again"
"2","4","We made two flavors of these for Christmas this year: lemon cake with lemon frosting and white cake with white frosting with almond extract. We had a small scoop and made approximately the amount specified in the recipe, however I felt that they were much too large. I would have preferred something that only took about two bites instead of the five or six that these had. I liked them well enough and they were easy to dip once they were refrigerated or frozen but if I make these again in the future, I will DEFINITELY be using a smaller scoop."
"2","5","Made these for the holidays. Awesome! I let the cake cool for at least an hour. Once I mixed in the frosting I put in the fridge overnight. The next day made the mix into balls and froze for about an hour before coating. I used two large spoons to roll back and forth. The toothpicks were too messy."
"2","4","baked choc cake in mini muffin pans, 10 to 12 min. no need to crumble, already bite size. when cool put in freezer for an hour or two then dipped in choc. great, not to sweet because there is no extra frosting in the cake. Next time I am going to try bakeing yellow cake for boston creme, inject with creme filling and dip in choc."
"2","3","Everyone raved about the cake balls but I just didn't get what was so great about them. I tried them twice to give them the benefit of the doubt but I don't think I'll make them again."
"2","5","When I made this I used my food processor (with the bread blade, not the knife blade) to crumble the warm cake. You only need a few seconds of processing to make the crumbs. I also used only 1/2 a can of the icing for the mixture. After forming, I froze the cakes for a minimum of 2 hours before dipping in the coating. It also took 16 oz. of melted chocolate/coating with 1/2 bar cooking parafin added to cover the approx. 60 balls. These were so good! It takes some time, but is well worth it."
"2","1","Did not even come close to working. It was a waste of ingredients."
"2","4","Made them for gifts this year, and they turned out great! We followed other reviewers' suggestion to freeze the cake balls before dipping in chocolate. Used red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting and yellow cake and chocolate frosting - red velvet were my favorite though! Also, used way more coating than mentioned - about 2.5 pkgs of 16 oz chocolate coating. Will make again with other varieties - possibilities are endless!"
"2","5","EASY EASY EASY. I rolled the mixture into balls first, and refrigerated overnight in a tupperware container. The dipping was easy with toothpicks, and the pieces didnt fall off in the chocolate. I would definitely use less frosting next time, just enough to cream the cake, not the whole container. People thought they were candies, but when they bit into them, they were pleasantly surprised, and they disappeared quickly. All I had was yellow cake mix and vanilla frosting this time, but I used red food coloring on half to see how it would look and they came out perfect. I love that everyone posted pics-- it gave me lots of ideas for next time. Thanks!"
"2","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"2","5","I made these with Cherry Chip cake and cream cheese frosting, dipped in dark chocolate. SOOO Yummy! Great recipe!"
"2","5","The instructions are a little vague and I suggest reading and printing the alternate reviews BEFORE making these delicious little wonders. Have a good understanding of cooking with confectioners chocolate."
"2","1","So disappointed! Was really excited to make this since I'd heard so much about them in the blog world. Seems to me like just fad because they aren't that great tasting!"
"2","5","Very easy, very tasty recipe! I did milk chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, and yellow cake with chocolate frosting. I dipped them in chocolate melty disks, and drizzled melted white discs over the top. When I made the balls, before I dipped them, I put them in the fridge for several hours to make sure they were more firm. Worked out great!"
"2","5","Even though I saw that this recipe had a high rating, I still did not expect them to taste so AWESOME! I used vanilla cake mix, 'rainbow chip' frosting, and did half with white chocolate and the other half with milk chocolate. I just tasted the finished product and was amazed. I must admit that while I was rolling the balls of goopy cake/frosting I was thinking it would probably taste pretty gross and look disgusting. But once finished and coated and bitten into....WOW!"
"2","4","made these today with red velvet and cream cheese icing...so far so good! I allowed the cake to cool completely and then added icing. They stayed together pretty well. I put them in the freezer to harden before dipping in chocolate."
"2","5","strawberry cake/strawberry frosting with white chocolate coating. Instant hit..Entire family is making them for other Holiday gatherings this season."
"2","5","I am so excited for my guests to try these for Christmas. I made a chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting dipped with the chocolate almond bark. I made some topped with coconut, some with a maraschino cherry inside with coconut on top, and some with Andes mints chopped up on top. I placed my tray on snow (we have lots in MN) to help them set up faster. Thanks for all the helpful hints in the other reviews. I had a blast making these."
"2","5","I actually read this recipe in another book and tried it tonight. Although they are a bit 'ugly', they are absolutely delicious. I am trying to have enough for christmas if I can stop eating them!"
"2","5","Made these for the first time today! Great creative recipe!! Thank you so much! I did not use the edges of the cake as others suggested and only used about a half a can of icing. I made white cake with strawberry icing and white coating and double chocolate as well. The cake was still warm when I mixed it up and then made the balls and put them in the freezer for an hour before dipping. Took a little time but it was not hard and these look great!!"
"2","5","Very easy but a little time consuming. I made three batches and they all turned out great. Time in the freezer before dipping is key. At least two hours. I used two ice tea spoons to dip and that worked out well. Chocolate cake with mikl choc icing and mint extract tastes exactly like the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies. I will be making these every year."
"2","4","WARNING: VERY TIME CONSUMING! It took me 6 hours to make 2 batches (1 with white cake/chocolate dipping, 1 with chocolate cake/white dipping). It is absolutely necessary to freeze the balls before you dip in chocolate. After decorating, they turned out beautiful and tasted just as great!"
"2","5","These are great - making them for our christmas eve get together. I used the White Texas Sheet Cake and the associated frosting for the inside and dipped in chocolate almond bark, which is what seems to work best for me usually. The almond in the sheet cake and frosting makes these yummy!"
"2","3","These were a huge pain to make - they turned out good and tasty but I'm covered in chocolate and exhausted. Not something I'll be making again."
"2","5","These were a big hit a friends Christmas party. Thanks to previous review i made 4 different flavors. My in-laws loved them and now they're on the Christmas menu. Wonderful wonderful wonderful."
"2","5","Made these last year for Christmas and now I have to make them EVERY year! These were wonderful...so easy and the possible combinations are so many and varied that you could theoretically never get sick of them. These were no-hassle but tasted like a major production went into them. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"2","5","This was great! I used lemon cake and icing and dipped in chocolate. Very kid friendly receipe, my four year old Grandaughter loved rolling the balls and dipping in the chocolate. Don't know why some reviews stated hours for prep, this went very quickly for me."
"2","5","so good and so much fun to make! I'm glad I read some reviews before making because freezing the balls before hand is a must! I found it easiest to work in small batch of 3-5 at a time and leave the rest in the freezer because as soon as the balls start to thaw your chocolate will turn into a crumby mess. I do agree with the comments about these tasting like chocolate dipped brownies, the consistency is about the same and if you use chocolate cake with chocolate or vanilla frosting the taste is much like a brownie as well...so if you're not going for that kind of taste I suggest trying a different cake/frosting combo. Great recipe for the holidays!"
"2","4","These are a lot of work and I needed 3 times the melted chocolate than the recipe called for, but they are sooo good! I also had to freeze the cake/frosting mixture before rolling it into balls (about an hour). It was far too mushy to roll into balls without freezing it first. Once the balls were rolled, I put them back into the freezer for an hour before dipping it into the chocolate. I wish I was better at dipping things in melted chocolate because mine look really messy. They taste really good though. I might add a little rum or something to the cake/frosting mixture next time to give it a little flavor. However, it took me about 4 1/2 hours total with baking and freezing time so I don't think I'll be making them again any time soon. I took away a star because it wasn't as easy as the directions claimed and it was far more time consuming than advertised."
"2","5","these were so yummy and easy. we used cherry cake mix with cherry frosting and covered with dark chocolate. tasted like cherry cordials."
"2","5","Excellent!"
"2","3","Ok, I wouldn't make again. These tasted like an undercooked brownie coated in chocolate."
"2","4","Ended up being really great, but the first dozen were a disaster because my melted icing was TOO hot and the balls kept crumbling. ALSO I did NOT use toothpicks, just my fingers. The balls kept coming off the toothpicks and crumbling in the icing so I just gave up. I used CandiQuik to dip the balls in and they were very tasty."
"2","5","I made red velvet with cream cheese frosting, and melted white chocolate chips for the covering. Beautiful for my cookie exchange!"
"2","5","I tried it with lemon cake mix, chocolate frosting and white chocolate to cover. Loved it!!! I believe this to be a great base for some rum balls. Add some rum to the cake as you mix it up with the frosting and roll into balls and cover with the sprinkles they cover the rum balls with."
"2","4","These were fairly easy to make. I used a red velvet cake mix with vanilla frosting and white bark. My only trouble with this recipe was the difficulty of mixing the frosting with the cake. I let the cake completely cool but the cake didn't seem to get as moist as I expected. I was able to use cooking spray on my hands and get them into balls which I then chilled. End result was delicious!"
"2","5","Excellent, easy, and delicious. Got it right the first time around, using reviews to make very minor adjustments: I put prepared balls in refrigerator a couple of hours (some until 2 days later!) before I dipped them. The ones that warmed up while I was dipping were much more difficult to cover. If you refrigerate, and plan to decorate with sprinkles or something that should stick to coating, do that almost immediately because the coating gets hard quickly on the cold cake. I used dark chocolate cake mix with the coconut, pecan frosting and it is really good."
"2","5","I made these for my mother in law's Christmas cocktail party and everyone thought that they were professionally made. When I told them how easy they were to make, everyone was in awe. I made red velvet with cream cheese frosting wrapped in chocolate. Some had white chocolate drizzle, crused pecans and coconut. Fabulous!"
"2","5","After reading the reviews my daughter and I decided to try these. We used a vanilla cake mix with 1/2 can of chocolate frosting. For the coating we used white chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolate chips melted. We used both bags for the one cake mix. You must wait for the cake to cool (despite what the recipe says) AND you must freeze the balls before coating. We only freezed for a 1/2 hour and that was plenty - no need for overnight as suggested by some. We used tooth picks to roll in chocolate coating. These are not difficult at all - we had fun making them! Great for kids because they can help do everything and they can be creative with colors! As for taste: we loved them! They taste like they should - cake and frosting! Yummy and fun! Will make again, soon!"
"2","5","Could it get any more perfect than a cakeball? I, too, have been making these for a while - a couple 'tricks'...refrigerate the warm cake over night! Makes for much easier rolling. After the balls are formed, freeze for, at least, an hour before rolling in chocolate. I've tried forks, toothpicks, spatulas, EVERYTHING to coat the balls - use your fingers! Much easier as long as the chocolate isn't scalding."
"2","5","I made carrot cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate, and lemon cake with buttercream frosting dipped in milk chocolate. They came out wonderfully. My only complaint was that, even after chilling the batter twice (before starting and halfway through to rechill), I still ended up with crumbs in my melted chocolate which made it very difficult to coat my last few balls. This might be solved by freezing the balls before dipping, but that was too time intensive."
"2","4","My initial rating was going to be one star until I figured out that these little treats need to be refrigerated before eating! If you don't chill them, they are mushy & too sweet! Having said that, take the advice of others to chill the mixture of cake & frosting. I chilled mine for 3 hours. MUCH easier to form and dip. I used an entire package of candy coating for 3 boxes of cake mix. This is a very versatile recipe, leaving you with so many options to mix and match flavors. I will definitely be making these again."
"2","4","This recipe is easy to make, but a bit sweet."
"2","4","Delicious. I used Wilton's Candy Melts and they just don't melt enough, way too thick. Next I will try Duncan Hines new Amazing Glazes to see if that is more 'dipable'. Took forever to dip each one and then move the too thick melts around to cover and not have it too thick. All in all they are delicious, no matter how bad they look:)"
"2","5","these are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. They reminded me of truffles but less sweet! I put sprinkles on top too!"
"2","5","This recipe is so easy and it is equally delicious. I used a triple chocolate cake mix and chocolate frosting which I warmed in the mirowave to loosen it up. I dipped the chilled balls in vanilla almond bark and chocolate almond bark and sprinkled them with multicolored sprinkles. Delicious!"
"2","5","I made these with chocolate cake mix & peanut butter frosting. For the coating, I used chocolate chip morsels. In order to get the coating to the right consistency, I melted butter in & mixed till it was a thinner consistency. Sometimes I use a small crock pot to melt the chocolate, but this time i melted for 1 minute in the microwave, mixed, and repeated for 20 seconds a couple of times. I also used a big spoon with slits in it, so the extra chocolate would drip off instead & moved them to parchment paper with a tiny spoon. They turned out perfect and everyone loved them."
"2","3","everyone loved these. i thought they were ok but not great. will try another flavor next time."
"2","4","If you love super sweet treats, this is the thing for you. But if you're not into really sweet tastes, it can be a bit overwhelming. Also, melting the chocolate or almond bark can present a little trouble. Mine came out extremely thick and was difficult to spread over the cake balls. To remedy this issue, I added a few crumbles of canning wax (my mother in law says it's edible and I trust her food judgment implicitly). It smooths and thins out the chocolate so you can pour or dip the balls much more easily."
"2","1","They looked very cute! It was fun to make. We brought them to a bbq and they didnt go over very well. It tasted like raw cookie dough? We used funfetti cake mix and buttercream frosting. Not sure what we did wrong but these were gross! Wont make them again!"
"2","5","I came across this gem looking for another recipe. I decided to try these cake balls on my co-workers and they were an instant hit! I even received some request for future events. Being in the south the only request has been red velvet cake but I'm ready to expand and think I will slip some new flavors in on them. Thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","I used strawberry cake, strawberry frosting and bakers chocolate on the out side, chocolate covered strawberries!! Letting the balls cool is a MUST after they are formed."
"2","5","Definitely recommend advice from previous reviewer to use hand mixer to blend the cake and icing- that was SO HELPFUL! Delicious and they look so impressive for such an easy recipe!"
"2","4","The taste is very good, but I had to follow other recommendations outside of the original recipe and they still were not very pretty. I let the cake cool for 30 minutes before mixing with frosting. I used a cookie scoop to make the balls and placed the balls in a mini cupcake tin to freeze for about an hour. Dipping them was not easy. Mine did not stay on the skewers when dipped in the chocolate. They also left cake in the chocolate, so the white bark was not clean looking, the chocolate bark hid it better."
"2","5","This were a big hit when I made them. I am planning to make for a Halloween party in Halloween colors. I was told by a friend to freeze the balls first, even over night before dipping and it will help from crumbs getting in the frosting when dipped and they will set sooner. I'm going to try that for the Halloween batch."
"2","5","I followed the directions exactly but I did wait until the cake cooled for sometime so it wasn't very hot. They came out wonderful. I can't wait to make variations! Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","These have a lot of flavor although time consuming they are a big crowd pleaser."
"2","5","These were so good! Let the cake mixture stand before adding the frosting! And you can cut the frosting in half! Great recipe...I got many compliments on these!"
"2","2","I would give this one star for taste, but because they are pretty and easy to make, I gave it two. I followed the instructions that others had posted about refrigerating and freezing. This is what they tasted like: super sweet mushy cake. The strawberry/white frosting with white coating did not go over well. No one ate more after their first taste. The German chocolate cake and pecan frosting wasn't as sweet, but still the consistancy of mashed cake with frosting was less than pleasing. They looked so pretty on my plate, and guests oooed and ahhhed over how they *looked* but no one asked for the recipe, and there were a lot of leftovers."
"2","5","I love making cake balls! They are quite time consuming but make a LOT of little finger foods to take to a party. There are so many options and flavors to combine that every time you can bring something new! I have tried vanilla with buttercream frosting as well as chocolate... I am pretty sure the chocolate got better reviews but they were both good. Next time I want to try red velvet and cream cheese."
"2","5","Very messy to make if directions are followed exactly, but very delicious. I definitely plan on trying some of the modified recipes."
"2","5","I wanted to try this for a while but thought it would be alot of work, Well I did it today, at first I was like what did I get in to, then as things started coming together, it got easy and I had fun doing it. I did use the amond bark, at frist I was not thinking this was going to easy but IT was and they look wonderful.I hope my guest love them as much as I do. if not more for me!!!!!! I used carrot cake and sour cream icing with choc almond bark.SO GOOD. one more thing It is very importent that the cake balls be cold before dipping. found this out the hard way.I put the in the freezer and took them out as needed to dip. I made ping pong size and used cup cake papers. looks great. next time I am going to use sticks and make them alittle bigger. I cant wait to make them again. no one in my family has ever had or made them so I am the hit now. Lovin life! try it, you will like it!"
"2","3","Great concept, but definitely something not to be made when the humidity is high. I stuck these in the freezer for about 2 hours and they still did not hold a shape to coat with chocolate. It was an ooey gooey yummy mess."
"2","4","Family and friends loved these but I didn't and I think it was totally because of me (I don't have a big sweet toothe). You will definitely need to freeze these until completely firm or you will end up with crumbs in your dipping chocolate. Next time, I though about trying a squeeze bottle with the tip cut cut off completely and squirting the chocolate onto the balls (on a cooling wrack so the chocolate doesn't puddle around the cake balls). But then I'd have to figure out how to coat the bottoms. Hmmm... I will definitely work with these more but don't forget to freeze them hard and use a dipping tool of some kind (spoon and / or fork doesn't work very well)."
"2","5","I made these with a chocolate cake mix, chocolate icing. I covered them with a chocolate almond bark and drizzled white chocolate on top of them. I took these to a get together and they were a huge hit and so easy to make. I did find that freezing the balls before dipping them made it easier and I recommend using a fork to hold them instead of skewering them. They were beautiful and so yummy. I will make these for other events in the future. I can't wait to try other cake/icing combos for more variety."
"2","1","Nothing special about this recipe except that its easy to prepare."
"2","5","Yummy! BUT, I used real milk and dark chocolate."
"2","4","Definitely need to make sure mixture is cooled before attempting to cover in chocolate. Tasty, but made my own cake mix from scratch."
"2","4","These are divine! I used pound cake with lemon frosting and white chocolate for the coating. Okay, okay confession time. I ran out of time to bake the cake so I bought one out of the freezer section at the grocery store. It worked like a champ and saved me lots of time! My sister said that I can make these for her any time. My second attempt was dark chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting and chocolate coating. This time I baked the cake :-) It turned out very well but they weren't as 'refreshing' as the pound cake/lemon frosting combination."
"2","5","Very easy & delicious recipe. I gave these away as gifts, made me look like a chocolatier. I even made them with red velvet cake, they turned out great."
"2","5","Have made these twice and everyone begs for the recipe. I can hardly get them through the door before the whole box has been devoured. They are messy and can be a little frustrating when dipping them, but are WELL worth the effort."
"2","5","I'm not much of a baker/pastry chef, but I wanted to make these for my daughter's 21st birthday, so I tried in advance. I couldn't make them fast enough! My family ate them as they had hardly cooled. The only thing I can add to previous reviews is that you must, MUST let the cake cool before mixing with the frosting. I also got a bit creative with the flavors, and that's where the fun begins!"
"2","2","These didn't work for me. I made red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and white chocolate. I cooled the cake mixture in the frig before rolling in the chocolate and they fell apart completely in the chocolate. So no luck for me and I am really bummed because these sounded so good. Oh the mixture actually was very tasty, my hubby ate some right out of the bowl."
"2","5","versatile! delicious! and the assembly? it was a piece of cake! :P"
"2","3","Hmmm, I don't really know what to say... They taste fantastic but I had a couple problems.... One, when I tried to dip them in chocolate, there not only wasn't enough, but it wasn't thin enough!! I kept adding more and more butter, but it was still like a frosting!!!:( I used Chocolate chips, because I didn't know what you meant by almond bark, but anyways, they also weren't very pretty, as the chocolate was too thick :( Well, I might try them again maybe dipping them in something else:)"
"2","5","I finally got around to making these and everyone loved 'em! It really is a great recipe. With some comments I see others who've tried dipping it in chocolate first, I also did that. DON'T do that! Dip it in powdered sugar first, let them sit, then try that. If you dip it in chocolate first it'll just soak it up and fall apart."
"2","2","These completely failed.. The 'dough' mixture was way too moist, and I couldn't get them to hold together long enough to even dip in the chocolate. I saw all the other reviews, and I followed the directions to the letter, I'm not sure what happened."
"2","5","these are amazing! The combination of crunchy outside and moist inside make them out of this world good! A few tips that helped me along were 1.) Freezing the balls are key. I had two trays of these going and after they had both been in the freezer for a couple hours I took one out and covered them in chocolate but when it started to come down to room temp I would put it back in the freezer and pull out the tray, alternating so they both stayed perfectly frozen. 2.) do not roll the balls in the chocolate. Little bits of it kept falling off into the chocolate. Also I used toothpicks like others suggested but I think next time I'll use some sort of egg dipper or forks. You could always see the hole where I pulled the toothpick out. Hope that helps!"
"2","4","Never made it with store bought icing, too sweet. I make homemade and 1/2 the sugar required in the recipe."
"2","5","A perfect, easy treat! My boyfriend loved these, and they were fun to make. AND tasty!"
"2","5","Be careful not to add too much frosting!"
"2","1","Sickly sweet. Weird texture."
"2","5","Althought time and labor instensive (especially dipping), this is one of the most requested recipes I have ever made. The possibilities are endless with this recipe and whoever came up with it is a genius! Nobody would ever know this was cake. It tastes like truffles. My favorite it strawberry cake mix dipped in Hershey's milk chocolate melted chips. Orange cake dipped in dark chocolate is also delish. You can't go wrong with any combination in my opinion!"
"2","2","This recipe fails to mention that the balls need to be refrigerated or frozen before dipping in chocolate or they completely crumble."
"2","2","Made these with vanilla cake and frosting and candy coating. VERY sweet and not to my liking though kids like them. Too, for Easter they asked for blue which was in no way appealing. Very hard to dip. Mine just did not look nearly as nice as the posted photos. Wish they did b/c I was going to bring them to an Easter dinner. Would be willing to attempt again with chocolate cake and frosting. Made them look ever so slightly cuter by melting semi sweet chocolate chips and spooning into a zip-loc bag. Decorated the tops with the help of my son."
"2","5","In response to many who have had a 'gooey mess', here is what worked for me. Cool cake completely. With an electric mixer, crumble cake and mix with entire can of frosting until dough like. REFRIGERATE for at least an hour, the longer the better. Roll balls and than dip into melted chocolate mixture. I used a spoon with holes/slats to drain extra chocolate. REFRIGERATE until firm. These are VERY sweet! Usually kids like them best. I hope this helps!"
"2","5","These are very sweet! Make them bite size. The recipe works well up to dipping the balls. There is definitely a learning curve to this part of the recipe. As others have said freeze the balls before dipping. I found the bark too difficult to work with and instead melted 1/2 bag of baking chips with 2tbsp vegetable shortening and just rolled the balls in the bowl. These are definitely at their best when refrigerated. Don't think of these as cake because they are really like a truffle or little desert you might buy from those magazines at Christmastime."
"2","4","These are good, but I would be impressed by anyone who could knock it out from start to finish in 1 hr and 10 minutes. They were slightly gooey, so I will probably only use 1/2 the icing next time. I used a duncan hines fudge cake mix and cream cheese frosting and did it in stages. Made cake, let cool for 20 minutes (no longer steaming), mixed with icing using mixer. Refrigerate overnight (it's just easier!) Scoop into balls, put in freezer while melting chocolate (add 2tbsp vegetable oil per bag of chips). Dip with toothpicks and set on wax paper. Great standard recipe!"
"2","4","wow, were these ever a hit! lol I would make these again, with less frosting next time to produce a more cake-like filling, as opposed to a truffle-like filling. Love the limitless combination options!"
"2","5","I love it"
"2","5","Great recipe!! I dont use a full tub of frosting I think its just a little to wet. maybe 3/4 is best. Weve tried all kinds of combinations now and these are always a hit and the first to go off the dessert tray."
"2","5","I first want to say that you need to freeze the balls after shaping them before dipping them or you will have one big glob. They are delicous once all is said and done. You canuse use any flavor cake, any flavor frosting and any flavor chocolate to dip them in. I used home made frosting chocolate cream cheese and cream cheese frosting with vanilla cake and dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate chips. They are very yummy! I will be taking to my daughters volleyball match tomorrow and watch all the girls go crazy over them. LOL!"
"2","4","I made this at Christmas time and the family loved them."
"2","5","My sister in law has made these several times and they are wonderful! We always request these for the holidays. She decorates them beautifully and they are gobbled up quickly!!"
"2","5","I made this with regular devils food cake mix and chocolate fudge frosting very good but RICH! So, I made these again with a REDUCED SUGAR box cake mix found at my local grocery store...OUTSTANDING! Not too sweet and believe me it makes them now even harder to resist :) especially when paired with really good dark chocolate (not almond bark or confectioners coating - Great recipe!"
"2","5","Instead of dipping in the almond bark, my daughter-in-law poured the melted almond bark into candy molds. (they looked like small reese's pb cup molds) She filled them 1/3 to 1/2 full and placed the red velvet cake balls into the melted chocolate. After a few minutes of refrigeration, they were ready to pop out of the molds. Then she drizzled them with white frosting. They looked so professional and tasted great. I think this would be easier than dipping them. She made some peanut butter balls the same way, and they were awesome!"
"2","2","I followed the directions exactly only cutting down the frosting alittle and these did not hold together ar all. They fell apart when I tried to dip them in chocolate. They also didnt stay together when i was making them into balls. I tried to drizzle the chocolate but that didnt work either. They taste good but they were just a mess. Sorry."
"2","5","Oh man, these are good! And versitile, you can make any combination ever! I made devils food cake and just regular milk chocolate frosting and then melted 2 cups of chocolate chips with 2T of crisco. Once I coated them in the milk chocolate I drizzled white chocolate over it and vise versa. Amzing...."
"2","4","Super easy to make after refrigerating the cake/icing mixture for an hour! Also, the finished product was better the next day after a night in the fridge. I can't wait to try the strawberry cake/white icing/chocolate coating combo! Yummy!!!"
"2","1","I am sorry but I don't see why these cookies recieved such a highrating. They seem like and easy recipie but they are not. One can of frosting wasnt enough to hold the balls together so I had to add another. Then they still kept falling apart when I dipped them in chocolate. When I finally got them right they tasted too sweet."
"2","5","SUPER sweet - love the possibilities with these!"
"2","5","For the coating I combine peanut butter chips (Reese's) and white chocolate chips (Hershey's) and I'd melt it over medium heat and have a glass of milk by my side to add a little bit in when the mixture gets dry. Then I turn it on low heat and stir till combined. Stir till some of the oil separates (adding in milk if necessary to make the texture smooth) and discard it. Turn off the heat and take some of the melted chips, flatten it on your hand, place a cake ball on top, and then roll it and drop it onto parchment paper. Let cool and once the coating hardens, you can store it in a container. I sometimes fridge mine if I'm not going to eat it for a few days then let it warm up in room temp before eating one. BE CAREFUL! the coating (chip mixture) for the cake may be VERY HOT so you might want to use a spatula to help shape it. And you can't taste the white chocolate. It's there because the peanut butter chips alone do not create a better consistency. 1/2 and 1/2 of each will work fine. I've added more white chips than peanut and it still has peanut butter taste. Ive replaced the peanut butter chips w/ chocolate and it works too but I like the taste of the peanut butter with the chocolate cake much more. EDIT: the melted chip mixture makes a non-sticky, fudge-like consistency that you can easily shape when warm."
"2","5","These are the BEST! White Cake with White Frosting, dipped in White Candy Melts (wilton) are my personal favorite. They are very sweet though, a warning to those who can't handle it. Make sure you get the balls almost frozen or at least very cold before you dip them."
"2","3","The Cake Balls were okay. They were TOO sweet!! Icouldn't eat them. Although they were fun to make with my friends, i will not make them again. :]"
"2","5","These were so good. We used chocolate fudge cake with cream cheese frosting, and white chocolate for the coating. We also made them a little larger. Since the recipe made so many, we shared them with friends and family. Everyone loved them! They were actually better on the second day though. And yes, they were very messy, but very much worth the trouble!!! We are going to try them using a red velvet cake mix next time!"
"2","3","I rated this 3 stars due to the fact I could not stand these things but most of the kids and a few adults did enjoy them. Perhaps it is the fact hubby and I are on a organic diet with no genetically modified corn ( corn syrups, corn starch etc) . The sweetness of this was overwhelming. It had the consistency of something having been previously chewed then dipped in chocolate. But like I said the kids liked them."
"2","3","I made these in a couple different flavors. My husband really liked them but I couldn't get past the texture of the cake mixture, it felt very mushy. I did make these with my daughter's choice of flavors (confetti cake and strawberry icing), this tasted just like chocolate coverd cherries."
"2","5","Easy and so YUM! I still haven't found the best way to dip them without having a hole on the top from the toothpick/skewer. (To remedy that, I'm going to use JAX's suggestion below to make a 'boquet' using a pretty basket/vase and floral foam. Great idea!) I've made this without chilling and had better success. I think if you have more goo to work with, then freezing/chilling is a good idea. Mostly though, I believe that you should add your frosting sparingly. You just need enough to make the cake adhesive in order to form a solid (not crumbly) ball. I used Paula Deen's Pumpkin Bars recipe, which is more like cake, and my homemade cream cheese frosting, then dipped in regular chocolate. When those hardened, I melted more chocolate, put into a parchment pasty bag, snipped off the end, then drizzled over the balls. It became edible culinary art!"
"2","5","These were a huge hit for a cookie exchange party that I attended. Make sure that you chill the cake and icing mixture for about an hour in the freezer and then for 6 hrs after forming the balls so that they are firm when dipping them in the coating. I made chocolate cake with chocolate icing and chocolate coating. I also made red velvet cake with cream cheese icing and vanilla coating. Everyone LOVED these. I will definitely make these again!"
"2","1","This was too sweet and the texture was unpleasant. They took too much time and were too much work."
"2","5","I made these twice in one week because my family polished them off so quickly. The first time, I chose not to coat the entire cake ball in candy coating but drizzled it instead...big hit! I made my second batch yesterday and inserted a lollipop stick in them and then allowed them to chill for about two hours. I coated them in the candy and then dipped some in almonds and sprinkled coconut on the others. Big hit!"
"2","5","I have been making these for years. I dip mine in either milk chocolate chips or white chocolate chips. It helps if the cake is cool when mixing the frosting. I also like to pop the pan in the freezer for a bit after I mix the frosting in. Its easier to work with when its cold."
"2","1","We did not like these at all."
"2","1","These do not taste good. I took them to a cookie exhange and they were not taken by anyone. Spend alot of time on these and was very disappointed."
"2","3","These look nice but are so sweet that I can't eat them. These are a lot of work for a mediocre outcome."
"2","5","A decorating tip: My sister put these on popcicle sticks and broke up some pretzels for antlers, and M&M/nerds/small candies for nose/eyes. You could also use an edible fine-tip marker (or I guess a paintbrush dipped in food coloring?) for expressions. Voila! Reindeer. Also stacked some balls together with a marshmallow top and made it a snowman (white chocolate dipped man, chocolate for marshamllow hat). Could also make people's faces (elves?). She used red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting (for that twisted sort of mind--seeing red inside a reindeer head). Entertaining, and very cute."
"2","5","OMG these are awsome! I made these for my seven year olds son's Christmas party at school. He freaked out over them!!!!"
"2","5","so easy to make will make again. thank you"
"2","5","I used Allison's recipe for my family cookie exchange and in the words of my nephew, 'Aunt Diane, you win!' These are amazing! I read through several reviews and used the advice given about refrigerating the dough before forming the balls and also freezing the balls before dipping. Both excellent suggestions. This isn't a simple process, but well worth the time. I used peanut butter chips for coating chocolate fudge cake balls and they were a major hit. I also tried carrot cake/cream cheese frosting/vanilla coating and german choc/coconut pecan frosting/milk choc coating. Those are also delicious. Thank you, Allison, for a great recipe!!"
"2","5","This is a very nice recipe as-is. I had about a tablespoon or two left of frosting and the cake was perfectly crumbled and moist. I followed some very helpful reviews and waited for the cake to be warm to the touch (not hot, about 20 minutes cooling time) and then added the frosting. I refrigerated the concoction for about three hours while I went Christmas shopping and when I came back it was sturdy enough to roll into balls with a melon baller. After that I put the balls in the freezer for a few hours and then dipped with fondue sticks. A wonderful treat - but only eat one!"
"2","5","This is one of those things that just sounded so weird that my mom and I had to try it! We were a little skeptical... but these turned out fabulous. We used yellow cake and coconut almond frosting. Yummmy!"
"2","1","A rare failure after years of baking! The inside was a weird consistancy, the taste was overly sweet, and the process is time consuming and expensive (it takes a lot of chocolate to dip all those balls). However, the ones I did before I gave up were very pretty and looked like they came out of a professional bakery."
"2","5","Very good and easy to make! Limitless possibilities with the cake/icing combo. The mix that my co-workers liked the best was: lemon cake, cream cheese frosting, vanilla almond bark with a touch of lemon flavoring mixed with the bark. TIPS: freeze the cake/icing mixture for a couple of hours or over night before making into balls. I also only used 3/4 can of icing. Mix with hand mixer."
"2","5","This was a hit at our home, everyone LOVED it! Thanx :D"
"2","2","These were decent. I made strawberry with strawberry frosting, then dipped them in white chocolate. Waaaaay too moist (I let the cake cook before smashing it up and didn't use the whole thing of frosting) and sickeningly sweet."
"2","4","I made these for Thanksgiving and have yet to serve them to my family tonight. I tried one this morning and I thought the taste was yummy and they look divine! But the texture is a little off for me. They are kind of...'wet' or, a little too moist on the inside because of the frosting, I assume. You might not need the entire jar! I wish I had known that. I crumbled the cake while very hot (almost right out of the oven) and mixed in all of the frosting, as one viewer suggested. Maybe this step was a mistake, so I suggest maybe letting the cake cool for a while, and then adding only 1/2 the tub of frosting at first- and add more as you go (if desired). But with a couple modifications, this is a keeper."
"2","5","These were the highlight of our holiday baking last year and we can't wait to try more kinds this year. Last year we made orange cake/vanilla frosting and strawberry cake/vanilla frosting both dipped in chocolate. We also did a white cake/vanilla frosting and added crushed candy canes and a little peppermint extract. They were fantastic. And chilling the batter before trying to roll works wonders. Also, freezing the balls before dipping makes them much easier to dip and makes them not as 'mushy' as one reviewer said. You won't be disappointed! These are amazing!"
"2","5","These are very good. You can also use the flavored liquid coffee creamers in place of the frosting. Not too much. Just enough so the balls keep their shape."
"2","5","Great hit! Everyone loves this recipe and begs for more! I've been making it for years. A little messy, but worth it in the end. My favorite it fudge cake and cream cheese icing. Delicious!"
"2","5","My kids had a blast helping me make these! I let the cake cool. Then broke it up and placed it in my kitchen aid along with the container of Dunkin Hines chocolate frosting. The mixture was very sticky, but i wet my hands (kind of like the way I do it for meatballs) in order to shape the cake balls. I placed them on a cookie sheet and froze them for 2 hours. Each kid had a job. One placed the cake ball into the wok of melted chocolate, I swirled it around and took it our with 2 forks and the the other 3 kids took turns with the sprinkles. We had a lot of fun! I served the cake balls frozen and they were delicious!"
"2","3","I'm sorry to rate this recipe so low, but I feel that the amount of work involved was too much for the so-so end result. The taste of the cake balls was certainly 'boxed' and I think everyone could tell they were made with 'bought' ingredients. I would have rather spent my time on a unique cookie or pie. Sorry!"
"2","5","White cake with fresh strawberry pieces, cream cheese frosting, dipped in white chocolate...yummy."
"2","5","i made this with my 3 and 2 yr old grandbabies they had a blast and ate alot of balls while they where still warm, i got so many yums and i love yous that i dont care if they get dipped, they requested cherry for next time,"
"2","5","these are so awesome. my favorite recipe to make is cherry chip cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in dark chocolate!"
"2","5","An AWESOME recipe, turned out SO perfect! I used white cake mix, and rainbow chip frosting, with vanilla melting chocolate to dip. Cant wait to make again, its so easy!"
"2","5","So good and so versital! thanks for the recipe. They freeze really well also"
"2","4","Very time-consuming, and mine didn't come out as pretty as the pictures, but I made these for a holiday party and people still make comments about them, so I'm sure I'll be making them again this holiday season! I followed other advice and waited for the cake to cool before mixing with the frosting, and used forks to dip the balls in the chocolate. I used red velvet cake, vanilla cream cheese frosting, and both milk and white chocolate for the outside. Get more than you think you'll need - if you're a novice like me, you will end up with a lot of it going to waste. These kept in the fridge for a while, so I ended up eating waaay too many!"
"2","5","I don't even like cake and frosting, but I LOVE these. They are addictive! I have passed on this recipe to many, and I have gotten to taste many different kinds thanks to some daring friends! I still love the basic chocolate cake, cream cheese frosting and chocolate almond bark. H-E-A-V-E-N!!!!"
"2","5","These are FABULOUS! I definaltely don't see these as being hard to make or time consuming at all. I have noticed that an entire container of frosting isn't necessary. I've never had to use more than 1/2. And instead of using a toothpick or skewer to dip them, I found that simply dropping them in the chocolate, rolling them around and using a spoon to pick them up and drop them on the wax paper is WAY easier! And it leaves no holes!"
"2","5","One of my favorite things to do is make sweets and send them to the base with my husband for the soldiers who work for him. My ten year old son and I made these last week and these received rave reviews! A few tips: 1) My son and I gave up on the melon baller and used our hands to roll the mixture into small balls. Messy, but fun : ) 2) I refrigerated the balls as others suggested to make it easier to dip 3) We used a wooden skewer stuck straight down into the top of the ball, dipped it, the slid it off onto the wax paper. We then covered the small hole with chocolate using a spoon. They were very easy to make, beautiful, and disappeared VERY quickly!"
"2","4","I thought one can of frosting made these WAY too sweet... they were a hit at the baby shower I made them for, but from now on I'll reduce the frosting. I initially made large balls (golf ball size) but they were a bit messy to eat, so I cut my frozen leftovers in half and rolled them again to make them more bite-size. Freezing the balls made them easier to work with, but would cause my chocolate bark to harden quickly, so I'd suggest making small batches that you can reheat as needed."
"2","5","Oh my! Delicious, I used red velvet cake and used about 3/4 tub of cream cheese frosting. My husband can't get enought of these. I won't be making these very often so that I may save my bum from getting any larger!"
"2","4","Pretty good, but a little too sweet for me. I'm admittedly not a chocoholic but I made these for a party so I was trying to please the crowd:) I did chocolate cake, chocolate frosting and dipped (only one side) in chocolate and it was just too much for me. I will try a different cake/frosting combo next time. I also thought the cake mixture was a little too gooey, so next time I plan to use less frosting (maybe 1/2 - 3/4 of a can instead of a whole one). Didn't find them that time consuming to make in terms of the actual work to make them, but you do have to plan ahead to give them time to chill (in the refrigerator) before dipping, and then set after dipping. I personally WOULD NOT recommend freezing before dipping - the cake won't freeze, just get very cold, and when you take it out, the condensation will start to make the cake balls way too mushy. Just refrigerate a few hours or overnight. To roll out the balls, I used a medium-sized cookie dough scoop and then hand rolled (about 1.5 - 2' ea.). I kept my hands a little damp and they weren't messy to roll and came out nicely- shaped. I used Baker's chocolate and it was really thick. Will try to thin it down next time w/cream but this time I didn't dip the balls completely. I just stuck them with a small fork, dipped in one side, and dipped again in rainbow sprinkles to make them more festive. Gave this 4 stars because I thought it was pretty good, but with a few tweaks, easily could be a 5-star recipe!"
"2","2","These were so soft, it was hard to keep it together (even when frozen, they thaw quickly). The bark coating doesn't cover pretty, I tried it microwaved, and over a double broiler and it still was not pretty on the 'ball'. I was hoping to find a recipe that can do them as well as the 'bakery' I use, but it just didn't please my cake ball need! ;) Thanks"
"2","5","This dessert is fast, easy and fun! I used a standard ice cream scoop to get about 18 balls. These would be super cute decorated as a kickball, soccer ball, volleyball or basketball. Perfect for a little (or big) boy's birthday party, where cupcakes might be too 'girly'."
"2","5","I can't believe how easy and good these were. I used chocolate on chocolate, german chocolate, and strawberry w/vanilla, and they all came out great although the chocolate ones went the fastest. It was easy to roll them with cornstarch on my hands and I used an egg separater to dip in chocolate. Everybody loved them and wanted the recipe. A few people thought they were store bought!"
"2","5","I made these for Educators' Week at my children's school, and I have been bombarded with requests for the recipe. I use Duncan Hines Butter Chocolate Cake Mix and Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge Icing. I pop them into the freezer for a few minutes, then drizzle them with white chocolate coating. I get rave reviews every time! NOTE: These do not hold up well at picnics. They're better for gatherings inside with air-conditioning."
"2","3","Made these for a baby shower. Definitely use candy melts and not just melted white chocolate chips (which doesn't coat as nicely and harder to work with). People loved them but I thought they were too sweet for my taste. It is a lot of work, so be prepared to have some time set aside for the dipping."
"2","4","these were very pretty!! taste was good but not great.. i did how ever make some changes to the recipe after reading previews reviews.. i use a box of strawberry cake mix.. and only half of a container of creamcheese frosting.. instead of almond bark I dipped some in white chocolate chips and some in semi sweet i rolled some in nuts and drizzeld others with chocolate =).. tip after you dip them and decorate these refigirated for atleast 4 hours or overnight =)"
"2","3","These are good, but they are a candy, not cake. They remind me of a truffle. It takes alot more chocolate to coat then the recipe calls for. It doesn't take much time until you get to coating the balls. That takes quite a while. I'm not sure I will make them again."
"2","5","SOOOO good. We did Strawberry with vanilla icing and then made chocolate with chocolate. Both were really good. It was WAY TOO much trouble to dip so we left them plain. We took the strawberry ones to school and they were a big hit."
"2","3","Honestly, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with this recipe. These are an incredible pain to make. I don't mind a challenge in the kitchen, but this just isn't worth the effort. The taste is good, but not fantastic. And the amount of chocolate coating called for doesn't cover even 1/2 of the cake balls. I won't make these again."
"2","5","I used German chocolate cake and icing and these were fabulous. I won't freeze them first next time, though. The chocolate hardened too fast and made it difficult to work with."
"2","5","Wowowowow! SO good! I used milk chocolate cake, whipped milk chocolate frosting, and chocolate mint candy wafers to coat. I let the cake cool about 10 minutes before adding just about 1/2 a can of frosting (that i microwaved for 20 seconds). I probably coulda added more frosting, but i wanted them as cakey as possible. Rolled them into balls, froze them, dipped them. The chocolate mint coating is to die for! I'm not a very good dipper, so some of them have very thick coating, but there ain't nothing wrong with that! I will use this recipe over and over again!"
"2","5","Do NOT keep these in your home if you are trying to lose weight. Impossible. I only used half the amount of frosting the recipe called for this time and I liked them much better than using the full amount. They were much easier to work with when frozen. I used lemon cake mix with cream cheese frosting and whit chocolate to coat. My husband and I liked the plain cake balls bettter - they were too sweet with the chocolate coating. However, the kids LOVED the coated ones and I eventually had to hid them so I would have enough to take to my event. I have also tried chocolate cake/chooclate frosting and those were very good as well. Good luck!"
"2","1","I was so excited when I made these, but I thought they were horrible. The frosting seemed to soak into the cake, to a point where it make the cake seem uncooked and soggy. Great idea, but not a great outcome."
"2","5","Great recipe...very delicious! I wish that I could have made mine look like the picture though :) However, they tasted phenomenal!"
"2","5","Good and super easy. It was a big success."
"2","5","I thought these were fun, a great way to be creative and very good! I took the advise of 'Lex170' on most of the steps and the cake balls turned out so pretty! I had trouble with using a toothpick to dip with so, I just sat the cake balls on a fork and dipped in the melted chocolate and scooted them off from the bottom with a toothpick. I didn't have any problems that way. I also used a melon baller to form the balls. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
"2","5","These were super easy to make and everyone absolutely loved them!"
"2","3","These were way too rich for me. I took them to the office and half the people loved them, half hated them."
"2","1","I followed the directions EXACTLY. They did not turn out like I hoped. It was like biting into a pre-chewed piece of cake. Complete waste of time and ingredients!"
"2","1","I guess I must have done something wrong -but these were a mess and didnt look appealing at all. I baked the cake, crumbled it, mixed it with frosting, rolled into balls and (taking the advice of others) put into the freezer for 2 hours. So far so good...I melted my bark coating and tried dipping the balls using a skewer. The skewer came right out of the ball so I had to use a spoon to fish it out. The cake then started to break up in the coating and the coating turned from white to a sickening brown color. Very messy, unattractive and not that great tasting either. Won't bother with this again."
"2","4","I used a lot of different suggestions from other reviewers on this recipe. I thought these were o.k. and something different. But the guests really really enjoyed them to my suprise."
"2","4","These are very yummy, I only use about a half a container of frosting and it was definitely enough! I also put mine on Lollipop sticks!!"
"2","5","Cake balls are lots of fun and can be done so many ways (Bakerella has raised it to an art form). But one thing to be aware is that you don't need the entire can of frosting. If you use the entire can the cake part will be a little too mushy. Use almost all of it, see if you're happy with the texture, and add more if you have to. It's easier to add more than to throw out the batch because you used too much. Also, melted chocolate chips aren't your best bet for dipping. Go ahead and buy the candy wafers that are made specifically for candy making; they work out much better. It also works better if you put the cake balls in the fridge or freezer for a while before dipping so they are a little more firm. Beyond that, this recipe is extremely versatile; you can use any cake flavor, any frosting flavor to make addictive little cake balls. I even made these once with gluten free cake and, while the texture was more grainy, they still worked."
"2","1","This just didn't do it for me. I made these to take to a party, used strawberry cake/frosting with chocolate and red velvet cake/ cream cheese frosting with white chocolate. They just had a really odd consistency to me and they didn't go over well at the party either. Will not be making these again"
"2","5","These are great. I used all chocolate and shaped them like footballs for superbowl. They were a hit. They taste like very fresh yummy Ding-Dongs."
"2","5","These are soooo good. The cake / frosting combinations are endless. This is a recipes that I am now required to bring with me to any function I attend."
"2","5","Easy and so impressive. The best is spice cake/cream cheese frosting. The lighter cakes have a funny texture when mixed with frosting and taste raw. Carrot cake works well too."
"2","3","These tasted really, really good, but my chocolate covering came out all gooey even refrigerated overnight. I also had a hard time wrestling them off the toothpicks; a few of them crumbled even though I'd frozen them beforehand. A great recipe, but not as easy to make as it sounds."
"2","5","Let me contain myself...these are out of this world!!! OH MY GOODNESS! I used Duncan Hines strawberry cake mix, and used 1/2 of a container of whipped cream cheese frosting. After mixing, I put in the fridge for an hour (per other reviews) then shaped into balls. I then froze the balls for about 2 hours or so, then immediately dipped in melted chocolate almond bark. CRAZY good!! And so gorgeous with the pink inside and chocolate on the outside! I am so looking forward to trying this with many other combinations, and have decided that this is going to be my new trademark item that I will bring to get-togethers. This recipe is genious, so delicious, simple, cheap, and unique!! Oh happy days!"
"2","5","We made these with devils food cake, vanilla frosting and dipped them in real ambrosia chocolate (on clearance after Xmas in the grocery store!). I crumbled my slightly warm cake into a bowl, added only 1/2 can of frosting -- you may be tempted to add more -- don't do it. You'll end up with wet and mushy insides. I set the bowl in the fridge for an hour, then scooped the dough with my cookie scoop, froze them for 1 hr and using toothpicks, dipped them into the chocolate. I filled two cookie sheets; some I made with my small scoop and I made a dozen or so with my large scoop. We stored them in the fridge for the whole DAY that they lasted! I'm sure they could be frozen but mine didn't last long enough! Will be making again soon ... they looked and tasted like something you bought in a bakery."
"2","1","With so many mixed reviews I was hesitant of trying this, but I decided to. I used strawberry cake mix and cream cheese frosting. It was like soggy cake. I chilled the dough before I rolled and dipped them. The chilled balls were... blah. Still like wet cake. Thanks, but no thanks."
"2","1","These sounded really good so I was disappointed that they weren't that great. I made them with yellow cake and white frosting in the inside and then milk chocoate on the outside. They tasted like generic choc dipped store bought doughnuts, except the inside was a bit mushier. I won't be making them again. Thanks anyway."
"2","4","-I recommend using less frosting than is indicated. I used about 2/3 of a can. -I found the few ingredients and simple directions made this recipe easy and straightforward. -I made a few varieties and the ones I dipped in chocolate were a bit overwhelming for me, though my husband loved them. I recommend making a simple glaze from milk and confectioners sugar and coating them in that then refrigerating until glaze is hard. They look like munchkins this way but the taste is much less overwhelmingly rich!"
"2","5","I made these for Christmas as gifts and they were a huge hit! I did white cake and frosting covered in semi-sweet chocolate, strawberry cake and frosting covered in white chocolate and dark chocolate cake and milk chocolate frosting covered in melted butterscotch chips. I followed the advice of others and cooled the cake 30 min. before crumbling, chilled the cake frosting mixture before rolling into balls and froze them before rolling in melted chips. I stored mine in the freezer, they held up beautifully. Everyone asked for the recipe. They are quite a bit of work but definitely worth it. Someone said they tasted like petit-fours which are even more work! I plan to make these again, the flavor combos are endless!"
"2","5","awesome. everyone loved them. i made the cake and frosting from scratch. i just can't stand how sweet the box mixes are. that added a bit more work to it, but it was well worth it. i made chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting. next time i want to try a strawberry cake and cream cheese frosting. i had never heard of cake balls until a few weeks ago. now i'm pretty sure they will be a part of just about any celebration from now on."
"2","1","I cannot understate how disappointed I was with this recipe. I followed the directions exactly, but the cake/frosting mixture was far too sticky to deal with. I refrigerated it overnight and even tried freezing it, but nothing helped. Worse than that was the texture. It felt like mushy cake in my mouth. Perfectly awful!"
"2","3","I was a little disapointed. A friend told be about this recipe and I was so excited to make these. My brain was racking with different combinations I wanted to try. I narrowed it down to 3. The recipe itself...simple. The process of making...pain in the butt! If I didn't have 3 children helping be roll out the six cookie sheets full of balls I ended up with, It would have taking be many hours instead of just a few hours. None the less, once I froze the balls a while I had to dip each one individually myself...that again...pain in the butt. I will probably not make these again. If I do, I will only make 1 combination at a time. I likes german chocolate cake with the coconut pecan frosting. You can really taste the frosting whereas the other flavors you couldn't."
"2","5","I had been eyeing this recipe for the longest time, because it is recommended so often on the recipe exchange. I was really grossed out by the idea of mooshed up cake mixed with frosting and squished into balls, but after much coaxing by recipe exchange regulars, I finally decided to give them a try. You know what? THEY'RE FABULOUS! They're not too sweet and the texture isn't like soggy cake, which was my biggest fear. I'll definitely make these again!"
"2","1","Even though i love sugar, this is way way too sweet. Also, it's so hard to make it look pretty and neat."
"2","1","I had high hopes for this, with really good reviews (some mixed reviews) and with all the work involved making these, biting into one was a disappointment! It was mushy. Maybe if less icing was used the texture would be better?"
"2","4","These were a great hit at Christmas. We made lemon cake, lemon icing dipped in white choc. and devils food cake/choc. icing dipped in choc. almond bark. The choc. ones reminded us of ding dongs. You can't use too much icing or they will be gooey. Freeze before dipping helps too. The first batch I made I didn't think I would like but everyone else did. The second batch were GREAT! I think it's takes a few tries to get the hang of making them."
"2","2","I should have listened to the reviewers and cut the frosting in half. They were MUSH!! I didn't even waste my time dipping them in the chocolate! I will definately try again because they sound so good but, if they don't work...I give up!"
"2","5","These where great! Everyone loved them at our holiday gathering. I will definately make these over and over again. I did mine w/slightly cooled cake, 1/2 tub of the frosting and then froze the ball mixture for a couple of hours before dipping. Any one complaining about the time it takes to make these obviously doesn't still make sugar cookies from scratch anymore...since I'd rather make cake balls vs. rolling out sugar cookies:)"
"2","1","Horrible! They don't roll in the chocolate, they don't form well at all. I'm sure they'd taste good if you could actually get it to work right. Just too much trouble. They were horrible and nasty to make."
"2","4","I waited a week before rating this recipe and I'm glad I did. My feeling now is that, the further you get away from the work it took to make these, the more you realize what a good recipe this is. Everyone who has tried the finished product has loved them, and they are so pretty - beautiful presentation. So in a way I guess the process can be compared to childbirth - difficult to get through, but oh so worth it. : )  I made several versions: 1. Cherry Chip cake with 1/2 a canister of cherry frosting, dipped 1/2 in white chocolate, 1/2 in ghiradelli milk chocolate. 2. Chocolate Fudge cake with 1/2 a canister of chocolate cream cheese frosting. Dipped 1/2 and 1/2 again (white chocolate and dark chocolate). 3. Orange cake with 1/2 canister of vanilla frosting. Dipped 1/2 and 1/2 again (white chocolate and milk chocolate).  I followed the advice of others and found it very helpful to reduce the amount of frosting used, and also to freeze the rolled balls before dipping in chocolate. I'll definitely make them again next year. Thanks for the recipe. : )"
"2","5","got great reviews from the crowd who had these when i made them. one hint though, if you are using dark colored cake balls then use a dark coating or else they won't turn out so pretty because it is hard to cover dark brown with white chocolate, for example"
"2","5","This was a great recipe. I made the choc. cake baked w/ Andes Candy pieces and mixed w/ the choc frosting and dipped in melted Choc chips. It did taste like the Thin Mint cookies only very moist. Will make again for sure."
"2","5","One tip I have is to take only about 6 balls out of the freezer at a time as you are dipping. This way, the cake balls will remain nice and frozen while you are dipping. This recipe is especially fun to make at Christmas-with red velvet cake mix/1 can cream cheese frosting. To make them really festive, I melted white chocolate and added green food coloring. Then I sprinkled crushed up candy canes on top. They looked SO festive and tasted great. Also-be sure to let the cake cool completely before mixing with frosting. If you use a cookie-sized scooper to make the balls, you will end up with 50 cake balls per batch."
"2","2","I guess my first clue that this wasn't going to be a worthy recipe should have been the title. The phrase 'Cake Balls' doesn't exactly make my mouth salivate. But the pictures looked great and I thought this might be a poor man's truffle. The only thing accurate about that statement is the word 'poor.' I thought the texture was, well, kind of like cake coated in frosting, not smooth and creamy like cookie dough. I made my own frosting, which was the best thing about this, next to the melted chocolate coating. The cake mixture was mushy, even though I was careful not to add too much frosting on the advice of other reviewers. The balls were as easy to roll as other truffles I've made, and I had no trouble coating them in chocolate. But, biting into them is a bit like eating a wet chocolate coated sponge. I gave it two stars because my husband was willing to eat them and said they weren't that bad. Poor guy. He never gets fed."
"2","5","This is a great recipe. My family and friends loved them. Could not make them stay on a toothpick so just used a spoon. I made red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and dip in white chocolate! Thanks I think I'm making them again tomm. for a pary."
"2","5","While these are a little messy to make they are totally worth it! I have altered this recipe around all kinds of flavors - white cake with cream cheese frosting works great too. Cover with Cherry chips and shortening melted, or cover the chocolate with peanut butter chips and shortening melted. I also melted white chocolate chips and colored it green and added mint flavoring for Christmas! This recipe is a hit!"
"2","1","I used orange cake and vanilla frosting with orange zest grated in. The balls never set even after freezing, I had to use more than twice the chocolate it called for to dip, They looked sloppy and tasted like mushy cake."
"2","5","I made these as a 'Let's see' kinda thing for something at church . I made Red Velvet with Cream Cheese frosting and they went FAST. I agree with others .. use only 1/3 can of frosting and add if needs more.I cooled cake for about 10 min and put it in my kitchen aid and it worked great. Going to try Lemon cake with lemon frosting and poppy seeds cover with white bark and sprinkle extra poppy seeds on top..."
"2","5","these are really fun to make. if they are too sweet for you, i would suggest substituting the icing for plain cream cheese- this makes them a little less sweet and very creamy!"
"2","5","I couldn't believe it - these were a complete hit! As I was making them, I kept thinking that there was no way anyone could like these, but people raved about them! I used triple fudge chocolate cake with triple fudge frosting and butter pecan cake with buttercream frosting - all boxed. I rarely use pre-made store-bought stuff, but I was in a hurry. Dipped both kinds in dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and peanut butter. I'm planning on taking these to another holiday party. Thanks for the easy and versatile recipe!"
"2","5","I have read all the negative reviews and I am convinced those gals are using too much frosting and putting it in before the cake is cool. I let my cake cool on the counter for 30 minutes before breaking up with a fork and add 1/3 can of frosting. That does not look like enough but trust me it is. I know the recipe calls for the whole can but that is too much. After making into balls I let them sit one hour in the frig before coating with almond bark and they come out fine. I am going to try the dipping chocolate with the lollipop sticks as this sounds less messy."
"2","3","This was time consuming and really,really sweet."
"2","5","wow it was a great hit at my x mas party. Let the cake cool in bowl first before you mix the frosting then mix the frosting in. then i put the mix in the fridge for about an hour made it easier to roll the balls."
"2","5","Like others... a whole can of frosting is way to much. It was really mushy. I baked another cake and added 1/2 of it in. Strawberry cake and frosting, dipped them in chocolate. After it was all said and done, they are my favorite things I have made all year."
"2","5","My family won't stop asking for them!"
"2","5","So, while looking for something to make for our annual Christmas party at work, I stumbled on these simple cake balls. A bit worried that traditional cake flavors wouldn't bring enough 'holiday' to the treat, I opted to give Gingerbread cake and Cream Cheese frosting a try. After crumbling the cake, I was afraid it was already a little 'gushy', I only added 1/2 can of the cream cheese frosting. I formed rather large balls (2 TBL) and let sit in fridge overnight. When I got home from work, I put in freezer for about 30 minutes. Using white chocolate chips and Gulf Wax I dipped each ball, and sprinkled with colored sugar and holiday candies. The hardened up pretty quick, and when I took the first bite, they were awesome!! This was my test run, and I hope to bring them to the party next week (fresh batch or course!)."
"2","5","Used german chocolate cake mix with the coconut pecan icing. Dipped in milk chocolate. As soon as I dropped them on the cookie sheet,I sprinkled chopped pecans over the melted chocolate. You have got to try this recipe! It is scrumptious!!"
"2","3","Yesterday I made a half batch following all the advice that was given (cool 30 minutes, refrigerate, freeze, etc.) and after hours in the kitchen I was ready to pull my hair out and throw it all in the trash. They came out way too sweet, way too gooey, and impossible to work with. Today I almost threw the other half of cake away but decided to give it another try - MY way - and they came out pretty darn good and I was done start to finish in less than one hour. The cake cooled overnight room temp; melted the (1/2 or less)frosting before adding; smashed it all together with my hands until it was like a cookie dough; skipped cookie scoops, melon ballers, etc and just rolled them in my hand; did not refrigerate or freeze; melted chocolate in a pie plate and rolled them. Oila! I think when they're refrigerated and cold the chocolate sets up too quick and makes the outer coating too thick; hence, too sweet. At room temp I got a perfect coating - not too thick, not too thin. I also believe without the refrigeration they have a better texture. The ones from the day before are still gooey. I *might* make these again."
"2","4","I tried this recipe for a cookie exchange wanting something unique. I don't know if I would ever make these again because of the time it takes. It took me 3 days to finish these.  * I baked the chocolate cake and refrigerated it. Left for several hours to run errands. * After cooled I mixed the cake with a tub of milk chocolate frosting. Then refrigerated that over night. * I rolled the cake mix into balls using the Pampered Chef small scoop. Then I froze the balls over night. * The 3rd day I placed toothpicks in the frozen balls only bringing out half at a time so they didn't defrost.  * I dipped each frozen ball in the chocolate leaving the toothpick in until cooled. My pan was refrigerated as well so the candy hardened right away. * When all the balls were dipped I melted 1 cup Andes peppermint baking chips with 1 Tbl shortening and drizzled over where the toothpicks had left a hole.   I am freezing these until next week's cookie exchange, we will see how they go over! I think they tasted great, but way too much work during this busy holiday season!"
"2","2","Probably would have tasted really good, but I followed the recipe to a 'T' and all I ended up with was a mess."
"2","5","I thought these were just alright. You have to really love chocolate to love these. On the other hand...everyone asked for the recipe! I had to give it to at least 8 people! I am making these again for christmas!"
"2","5","These are great and very versatile. They do take awhile to do though. I recommend a cookie scoop to form the balls and then roll them in your hand. Put them in to refrigerator to set before dipping. Add about a T of shortening to almond bark before melting.  I've substituted peanut butter for the frosting when using white cake. My family liked them better than the traditional buckeyes."
"2","3","If I were to make these again, I'd bake my own cake and cut WAY down on the sugar, then mix the frosting with that. They came out very pretty but were extremely sweet. I had a hard time forming the cake mix into balls, so I let it refrigerate overnight and let the balls freeze for two hours before coating them."
"2","5","These were wonderful. I used a yellow cake and chocolate icing. I put the dough in the refrigerator to chill before making the balls and then again before dipping them. It seemed to make it a little easier. Then I dipped some in white chocolate bark and the rest in milk chocolate. I did find the milk chocolate worked better because the white hardened too quickly, I may not have heated it high enough. But the cake mixed in the the white chocolate coating. I can't wait to make these again with different flavors!"
"2","5","Was a great recipe, I did follow other suggestions to refrigerate for several hours before making the balls, I am glad I did. I did the yellow cake/chocolate frosting dipped in chocolate, a little to rich for my taste, so I followed with an orange cake mixed with buttercream frosting dipped in white candy coating. Very good, plan to make these for Christmas using red velvet cake."
"2","4","This recipe was good, but I used half of the frosting and thought it was too much frosting. Next time i'll try 1/3 of the frosting noted on the recipe. Also it was hard to get a clean coat of chocolate over the cake balls."
"2","5","OMG!! These are absolute heaven! I followed the suggestions of letting the cake cool for 30 minutes before crumbling it, made the balls, and then froze them for 2 1.5 hours before dipping them. I then finished them off with a drizzle of white chocolate to dress them up a bit. The German Chocolate cake with Coconut Pecan frosting is AWESOME!"
"2","3","I have to agree with some of the so-so reviews in that these are mushier and sweeter than what I personally like. I am bringing them to a party tomorrow, so we'll have to see what the general consensus is. And, unlike many cake mix recipes, this one's not exactly a time-saver. I doubt I'll be making these again."
"2","2","Really did not care for these, the idea sounded good and other peoples pictures looked good, but mine, just an 'eh'. I used a strawberry cake mix, cream cheese frosting, and dipped in chocolate. They were messy to dip, didn't come out nearly as pretty as I'd hoped, by the end half my 'chocolate' was cake crumbs. Don't think I'll give these another shot."
"2","1","Sorry to say, I did not care for these. Regardless of how you follow the recipe (which is easy) and all of the recommendations of others, they turn out mushy and too sweet. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone--you'd be better off making the cake and frosting it!"
"2","5","These are completely awesome. I wanted to do a trial run before Christmas. I made them with white cake and cream cheese icing, i'll be a little more creative next time. I used only half of the frosting like others suggested and refrigerated the balls so they wouldn't fall apart when dipping. They were so good. I can't wait to make them for my husbands clients as Christmas/Thank you gifts."
"2","3","I used a whole can of frosting and the texture came out very mushy. I think next time I would go with a half a can of frosting and then add a little bit more at a time until I get a good texture (not too mushy) and taste. I used a strawberry cake mix and cream cheese frosting - the taste combination was really good! The mushy texture was the only thing holding me back from giving this one a better score."
"2","5","I have only been making these for about 4 months and my friends now BEG me for them! They are really great with funfetti!! And some of them actually like them better not dipped in the chocolate. Which I find to be the most time consumming part so if you don't want to they are still great without it!"
"2","2","I was disappointed in this. It sounded so good and got good reviews but, to me, it was just a gooey ball with a coating. My husband did like it, however, and he doesn't like many sweets."
"2","2","they taste like smooshed wet cake. sorry, not so good. :("
"2","5","Oh so rich!! I made these for my friends and they attacked them. I didn't want to dip them in chocolate so I rolled them in powdered sugar. So far I've only tried chocolate cake mix and cream cheese frosting, but I know that there are so many different combinations. Thanks for such an easy recipe!"
"2","5","these are 5 stars for the idea - I absolutely love them, but I use a homemade chocolate cake (I make Sandy's Sour Cream Chocolate cake from this site) and use a homemade cream cheese frosting. I used my smallest cookie scoop and scooped them onto a pan, covered them in plastic wrap and kept them in the refrigerator (I left some in there for days before dipping in chocolate). After the fridge I rolled the balls in my hands to smooth it out and I dipped mine in the Hard Chocolate Glaze (also from this site). I prefer these small and at least an hour out of the fridge, they're kind of fudgy that way and so good."
"2","5","These were so so decadent! We had some trouble keeping the melted chocolate smooth. Someone else had suggested freezing the balls a little first and that definitely helped. Very yummy!"
"2","5","these were very good, i used chocolate cake mix and choc frosting and added PB to tast to frosting. i took the advise of many review's and let cake cool, used less frosting than called for. also used semi sweet chips with shortning for dipping. i put balls in frezzer for while and they really held togeter while dipping. hubby loved them so much he was munching before they were even dipped, although he liked them dipped more. will make again with new cake/frosting combos."
"2","5","I used this recipe for a cookie exchange and it was a huge hit! I did chocolate cake with chocolate frosting drizzled with white chocolate. The second one I did was white cake with the white confetti frosting dipped in white chocolate drizzled with red and green )for Christmas) chocolate...The kids loved that one!"
"2","5","These were a huge hit. I made 2 kinds. 1) red velvet cake w/ cream cheese frosting dipped in semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2) chocolate fudge cake with chocolate fudge frosting dipped in white chocolate.  I had troubles with the dipping in chocolate, but found it was much easier when a good amount of shortening was added - made it much thinner and easier to use."
"2","5","Wow! I made these in October instead of a birthday cake for my daughter. My family went crazy for these! I used white cake w/ chocolate frosting and dipped in white and chocolate bark. Then drizzled opposite chocolate on each. Key is to def throw in the freezer/fridge after you add frosting to crumbled cake. Also, I used an Easter egg coloring wire dipper which worked really well. Time consuming but the reward is worth every bite!!! No one in my family wants plain cake anymore!!! Awesome recipe!!! UPDATE: I used a mini 'dip crock pot' to warm up chocolate...works really well...you don't have to keep reheating!!!!"
"2","3","With all the buzz about cake balls I thought I'd better try it out. Wow this was alot of work and wasn't what I was expecting. I thought they would be more of a cake dessert but instead they were more of a cheap-tasting truffle. I made a similar recipe to this one at the same time as this one, and I definately prefer the other one better. It was with 1 1/2 cups of flavored liquid coffee creamer instead of the icing - more rich, but still just wet cake. For this much effort, next time I'll just make real truffles or some other kind of chocolate candies. Glad I tried it and know now though, just not my thing."
"2","5","Baking never really works out for me, so I went into this recipe not expecting too much. But I was so pleased. Super easy. I mixed the cake and frosting while the cake was still hot. This worked out fine for me. I just rolled the balls with my hand. I put them in the freezer for a couple of hours then just coated the tops with melted chocolate chips. I don't know why some people found this to be time consuming or messy. Mine turned out fabulous."
"2","5","LoVe this recipe, so fun and easy! Made two batches, one with coconut cake and coconut icing, covered with chocolate almond bark and drizzled with white chocolate. SOOOO good!! The second batch was red velvet with cream cheese, dipped in white chocolate and drizzled with dark chocolate. Definitely freeze the balls before dipping, we used the metal dipper from the Easter Egg kit as someone recommended...worked like a charm! I'll post pictures of the finished product."
"2","5","These are fantastic! So easy! I did the first batch just like the recipe said and they were really good. I did my second batch with homemade red velvet and chocolate frosting and coated 1/2 of them with chocolate and 1/2 with 10x sugar...DELICIOUS! I did refrigerate them for about 30 minutes before dipping them, and that made it much easier. They are a little time consuming, but well worth the effort. Will definately be making these many times over! Thanks for the great idea!!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I love that you can use any cake flavors and frosting flavors to make what kinds you want. I also used a variety of nut and sprinkle toppings to finish them off"
"2","3","hmmm....so I made this, I used reduced sugar frosting because people said it was too sweet. My cake balls were supermoist, not cakelike, but they were too wet (i will cut the frosting if I make again). And because they were so moist they would break apart when I tried to dip them...next time I will refridgerate them. They are a little messy to make too."
"2","4","These looked really cute, especially for a baby shower using pink or blue food colouring. However my family and I found them a little bit too sweet. Maybe it's because I used white chocolate instead of almond bark, I'm not too sure. Nevertheless, it's a GREAT recipe of leftover cake."
"2","5","Oh lordy, these are dangerous. I think I gained 10 pounds over the holidays eating these. I refrigerated the dough for a few hours before attempting to dip them in the chocolate. I also found that the melted chocolate chips were much easier to dip into than the bark."
"2","5","we loved this recipie! we didn't change a thing.exept we didn't use a toothpick to dip them in the chocolate instead we drzzled them with both white chocolate and dark."
"2","5","I made these for christmas goodies, and were HUGE a hit. Great recipe, yummy...Thanks!"
"2","4","These were delicious but we've rated them a 4 because the recipe was a little short and they were a bit of trouble for us. You definitely need more chocolate bark than the recipe calls for, atleast an extra package. Also be WARNED: do not melt the chocolate in the microwave like the packaging says you can do, it coats the balls too thickly and our second package actually burnt (smoke and all) in the microwave, definitely put in the extra effort and use the double boiler."
"2","4","I couldn't seem to get these coated very well! I'd love to know how many times they were coated to get the picture that is on here! The flavor is very good though. I used a chocolate cake mix and french vanilla frosting. I won't give up and plan to try again!"
"2","3","I tried these with Funfetti cake mix and white frosting(all I had). Trying to dip them on a toothpick is nearly impossible, so I had to go after them with a spoon. They turned out way too sweet and mushy for me, but they look pretty."
"2","5","AWESOME!!!! I did as recommended as froze them for a few hours. I would STRONGLY recommend freezing them OVERNIGHT. I think the few hours helped but longer would have been better!!"
"2","4","Very Good. I used red velvet cake mix and cream cheese icing dipped in white bark. I did put the balls in the freezer before dipping for about 20 or so minutes. I didn't have any trouble dipping them like that."
"2","4","These were very good! I used strawberry cake and strawberry icing with chocolate Almond Bark. The possibilities are endless for flavor combinations. I mixed up the cake and icing while the cake was still warm. I then refrigerated the mixture and rolled it into balls and dipped them once they were cool. I don't think freezing them is necessary. Some of the pictures posted with this recipe are just beautiful!"
"2","5","These were so yummy and went over very well with my family and at the cookie swap I brought them to! I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and coconut pecan frosting. I crumbled the cake as soon as it came out of the over and use my hand mixer with the dough hooks attached to mix the dough. I chilled it overnight and then dipped in chocolate chips melted with about a teaspoon of oil. The only thing wrong with this recipe is that I don't know how 3 oz of chocolate would cover all the balls! I had to use 2-12 oz bags of chocolate chips and I still had a couple that were uncovered! I found that one recipe made about 60 balls! I will try these again with other flavor combos!"
"2","5","So awesome! I have tried these in so many variations. Favorite: Devils food cake with dark fudge candy melts. I use Wilton's candy melts for the dip. I also freeze my balls before dipping. I keep a supply in the freezer in case of last minute visitors. I just pull them out and give them a quick dip. Awesome recipe- awesome results!!!! Thank you for sharing this fantsatic recipe."
"2","5","I used German chocolate cake mix with coconut pecan frosting & dipped them in melted semi sweet chocolate chips....delicious!!!! Everyone who tried them asked for the recipe!"
"2","4","These were pretty good. I used funfetti cake and rainbow chip frosting with white coating. I needed a lot more coating than the recipe called for. If I make these again I will try chocolate cake with chocolate frosting or coconut pecan frosting. Very unique and versatile recipe. Thanks!"
"2","5","This recipe is AWESOME!!! I used devils food cake mix/chocolate frosting/chocolate almond bark, and they are delicious!! I followed the other reviewers recommendations and put the balls in the freezer for about an hour so they were easier to dip. For one batch, I used 3/4 of a bar of almond bark, and a square of vanilla to drizzle on the top. These were really so easy to make, (the most time consuming part is dipping) and I will DEFINATELY be making these again soon! I can't wait to try other combinations."
"2","3","too much effort for less than stellar results"
"2","5","Everyone loved these, even my husband who doesn't eat many sweets. I made chocolate with chocolate icing, will definitely make again."
"2","5","I have made this several times and it's a hit every time! I have used spice cake mix with cream cheese frosting and they were good, not as good as the chocolate though. I freeze the mix before and after I make the balls, it makes them easier to cover in chocolate. I changed the name to Cake Truffles, then it sounds like they were a lot more work than they really are!"
"2","5","Oh man, these are so good! I tried to remove a cake from the pan too soon and it totally crumbled on me. I didn't want to dump the cake and remembered this recipe. I made a homemade cake and frosting (both chocolate). I followed the advice of another reviewer and froze the balls for an hour and then dipped them in chocolate, using a skewer. I will definitely make these again even if my cake doesn't automatically crumble;)."
"2","5","Wooooowwwwwwwwwwww. I used strawberry with rainbowchip icing and butter recipe with milk chocolate icing. I used white and dark chocolate for the strawberry and milk for the butter cake, and both were soooooo amazing. Thanks to the tips about chilling before balling, it really helped. I also used chips and a dab of shortening instead of the bark since that's what I had on hand. Yum!"
"2","5","Marv! Froze them overnight and were easier to dip. Also, I used an Easter egg dipper as per another review, along with a toothpick and worked very nice. I used Red Velvet cake mix with Cream Cheese icing and they were a huge hit! Used shortening to thin down the chocolate, and may try a little veggie oil next time to see if that will help too!"
"2","5","These were soooo good. After coating them in the chocolate I sprinkled them with chocolate sprinkles and they looked amazing."
"2","5","Excellent! I used this recipe to rescue and box mix red velvet cake that was very bland from getting wasted. Mixed the red velvet cake with cream cheese icing, that alone tasted great. I dipped the balls in melted milk chocolate chips with a little cream added to help the consistency, because that is all I had on hand. Great for saving less than stellar cakes if you hate waste!"
"2","5","I coated the outside of the cake balls with powdered sugar becasue of time constraints and they turned out great."
"2","5","these are great. you just have to practice getting them the 'right' shape. i make the balls, freeze them for 24 hours, dip them in the chocolate and put them right back on the frozen cookie sheets. then right back in the freezer. everyone loves them."
"2","5","These were a little messy and time consuming, but well worth it! I used the chocolate cake and chocolate frosting, but added a couple teaspoons of raspberry extract to half the batter. It was a delicious addition! I can't wait to use different frosting/ cake mix combinations!"
"2","5","Awesome! These were a little time consuming to make, but well worth the effort. I used cherry chip cake and cherry frosting, dipped in vanilla flavored almond bark. Placing the cake balls on a cookie sheet in the freezer for about an hour made it easy to dip them in the coating without the cake crumbling. I ended up melting and using about 15 oz of almond bark, which covered about 40 one inch cake balls. Next time I'm going to try using chocolate cake, caramel frosting and chocolate almond bark. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","5","Oh addictive is so true =0) I made it with Vanilla cake and WHIPPED vanilla tub frosting,dipped it in white or milk choc. chips sprinkled w/crushed candycanes delish..made again with van.cake & regular choc. frosting I think it tasted better with the whipped kind...but either way there was still an empty tray =0) thanks for sharing"
"2","5","TRIED THIS RECIPE AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! AFTER WE COVERED THE CAKE BALLS IN CHOCOLATE, WE ROLLED SOME OF THEM IN FINELY SHREDDED COCONUT, OTHERS IN CHOPPED NUTS AND OTHERS IN CHOCOLATE SPRINKLES. THEY LOOKED GREAT AND TASTED YUMMY. FREEZING THE BALLS BEFORE COATING THEM IN MELTED CHOCOLATE WAS VERY GOOD ADVICE. MADE THE PROCESS A LOT EASIER. WILL BE PREPARING THEM FOR VALENTINE'S DAY PRESENTS. ANXIOUS TO TRY OTHER COMBINATIONS."
"2","5","I have made this recipe many times. The 2 forks work great when coating them with the chocolate(better than the toothpick)and also if you stick them in the freezer after making the balls but before coating them, it works best. Also if you put them back in the fridge to harden the coating on them it will only take about 5 minutes. I have also found that you can freeze them and that way if you have company over or you are stuck for a dessert or a quick snack you have one. They only take about 20 minutes to defrost and they are ready to serve. I use Chocolate Almond Bark and when it starts to get a little thick you can thin it out with shorting, but only use a little at a time because it can make it to thin if you use to much."
"2","5","WOW! This didn't last in my household. I did chocolate cake with chocolate icing and dipped in chocolate. A chocolate lovers dream come true! I made for X-mas eve and had to remake for New Years Eve! Freezing the formed cake balls help before dipping in melted chocolate!"
"2","4","This is a great tasty recipe. It is a little time consuming if you freeze the cake before dipping it, but it makes it so much easier. Another thing I found out the hard way was to spray my hands with vegtable oil when rolling the balls and it kept the cake from sticking to me. I tried the powdered sugar and flour tricks but they were still to messy for me. This time I tried yellow cake, vanilla frosting and dipped them in milk chocoate and rolled in sprinkles. The kids and the party loved them and werent nearly as messy as the other cakes there. I cant wait to try out othe combos and see what they come out like!!"
"2","4","I made several kinds for the holidays and our favorite was the german chocolate w/ cocount pecan frosting dipped in chocolate.They were easy to make and made several."
"2","5","Loved this recipe. I used the german chocolate cake mix and the coconut pecan icing. I tried dipping the balls but it got a little messy so I just spooned the chocolate over the top. I also rolled some of them in powdered sugar instead of the chocolate coating. They were a big hit at our Christmas party."
"2","4","these are super yummy (very sweet!) but pretty hard to make. i used both vanilla and chocolate frosting with strawberry and red velvet cake. i also used both vanilla and chocolate confectioners coating. baking the cake is easy but make sure to flour the utensil you're using to scoop the balls, it makes it a whole lot easier... thankfully it didn't take me too long to figure that one out. i refridgerated the balls like other reviewers had suggested and they were still pretty hard to dip in the chocolate. they look pretty hideous but taste delicious! maybe i'll try to make them smaller next time? and use a different coating. i'm not sure but i'm only making these on special occasions they took a lot of time!"
"2","5","These are great. Did not stay around long at our house. Will be making again. They are fabulous!"
"2","5","WOW!! What a great recipe! I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! I can't wait to experiment with other flavors. Thanks for the recipe!!"
"1","5","Excellent Valentines treat! Thanks for the share!"
"1","5","Yummy and fast"
"1","5","Everyone loves these !! I mix/fold the icing right in the 9'13'glass pan a few min. out of the oven. Very easy. I love white cake mix with white icing and 1 pkg of dark chocolate chips melted down for the topping :)"
"1","5","These are awesome! I made them a couple times with different combinations. They went over big! I Started them in the evening and refrigerate the frosting/cake mix over night. In the morning I form into balls and refrigerate a bit longer before coating them."
"1","5","I have made these and they are easy, amazing, and look great. after crumbling the cake, I add a container of frosting then roll into balls, then I put in freezer for 20-30 min, It is so easy to dip them after being in the freezer!!!!"
"1","1","I just tried to make these and it turned into a gooey mess. Followed the directions to a tee. I put the batter int he refrigerator after a failed attempt of creating balls with my ball scooper. I pride myself in my baking and hated buying a box cake and frosting to make this with my children. They were so excited and then so disappointed. Time to make something else."
"1","5","It was so delicious that i was at a lost for words!"
"1","5","so cute"
"1","5","Made these with homemade cream cheese frosting. Dipped them in chocolate confectioners coating. They were delicious!"
"1","1","I used a cheap cake mix with a cheap frosting and it tasted like it. I could try spending more $$$ but can't get past the time it takes to make cake balls. When making into balls it was just too soft. I had waited over two hours for the cake to cool. I ended up freezing the balls before dipping. This recipe is too time consuming for me for what you get. I would never make again. This is coming from a cook who likes making bread, cookies, enchiladas."
"1","5","These are so yummy! Easy to make but a bit time consuming. Made different flavors, so many fun exciting options. I used a double boiler to melt chocolate and used 2 wooden skewer sticks...worked great. Freezes well. I will definatly make these again."
"1","4","Mine turned out extremely delicious but I have to take away a star for the changes I had to make. After I made the cake and the pan cooled down a bit I put it in the freezer for about 20-40 minutes. You never want to crumble the cake or add the frosting to the cake while it's hot/warm. It makes it harder to mix. You can use your hands to mix the both together but I recommend wearing gloves if you're going to do this so it doesn't get too messy. I didn't have a melon baller or an ice cream scoop to make them so I used my hands. For me, it takes about an hour to make all of them. I freeze the cake circles for 10-20 minutes before I put chocolate on them. I can tell you that this is EASIER than adding chocolate on them after you make them. When you top the chocolate on them it hardens and doesn't drip. I put them in the freezer for about 10-20 minutes then I'm done! I usually leave them in the freezer for about an hour or two before moving them to the refrigerator."
"1","5","I have made these using various flavor combinations:red velvet with cream cheese and white chocolate, german chocolate, and chocolate peanut butter. They are always a huge hit, they make portion control for kids easy."
"1","4","They worked but I was surprized how long it took from start to finish. I used Betty Crocker Gluten Free cake mix. It worked to shape the balls, but when I put them on the sticks, they slid down. So I served my 'regular' batch on sticks and the gluten free ones upside down in muffin papers."
"1","4","I made these per the recipe and afterwards reading the reviews (which is very much not like me) BUT be sure to follow the advice of LEXI70. I'm looking forward to making these again - but I will be applying LEXI70's advice for sure."
"1","5","Yummy and easy!"
"1","5","These are amazing and a huge hit everytime i make them. I have gave this recipe to about 25 people now who after they try one insist on having the recipe"
"1","5","My homemade cake recipe on this site flopped...as in crumbled. So I grabbed the vanilla flavored chips to melt.. yummy!!"
"1","4","The all chocolate balls were unbelievable! Tried lemon cake w/lemon icing and white bark...not so great. I would stick with the chocolate. My child who doesn't even like sweets fell in love with these!"
"1","1","I'm giving this 1 star for very very poor directions. I've never made cake balls before and wanted to make these for an event. Little did I know you had to cool or freeze the batter.   Thank you so much to the reviewers for helping me out there. If it wasn't for you, I would be crying in my cake ball batter"
"1","4","These were really good, but the confectioner's coating wasn't good on them, and was a disaster to roll in sprinkles. Next time, I'll use my recipe that's for dipped cookies: melt 12 oz. butterscotch chips, 12 oz. chocolate chips, and half a block of paraffin (wax for candy making) in a double boiler, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. The mixture turns out very silky, and stays that way. It is a fantastic tasting and easy-to-work-with dip. I used chocolate cake and coconut-pecan frosting, and it was really good (but VERY sweet). I let the cake cool for 30 minutes before mixing in the frosting (used a hand mixer). Putting them in the freezer for a minimum of 3 hours is a must! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","This was a fun activity with my daughter. The recipe was easy to follow and forms a nice base to make alterations. Tasty, easy and it makes a great presentation."
"1","2","poor directions"
"1","5","I love this!!! its my favorite bite size dessert!!! great to bring over a get together :D"
"1","5","Easy recipe with a lot of option potential. Thanks for sharing."
"1","4","I made these for a Christmas party, and all of them were gobbled up. I used yellow cake, and vanilla frosting that I doctored up with some peppermint extract and red food coloring. I rolled the cake balls in melted semi-sweet chocolate and then sprinkled them with crushed peppermints."
"1","2","They fell apart when I dipped them in chocolate."
"1","5","I made these last night for my sons football team! A huge hit! I made strawberry cake, strawberry icing and dipped them in chocolate. I also made milk chocolate cake/cream cheese frosting and dipped them in chocolate! Yummo!!"
"1","5","Awesome!!! I thought the cake was going to be really gooey and gross when it was done, but it had a great texture- somehow reminding me of those rocher candies I love so much-minus the gooey center- I mad german chocolate balls with coconut pecan icing covered with melted german chocolate squares and then rolled in crushed pecans and toasted coconut. they were perfect and everyone loved them!!!"
"1","4","yummy, kids loved them."
"1","5","Super easy, great taste, perfect for parties."
"1","5","I made these according to the instructions minus a few ounces of frosting. They are so good! We didn't bring any home from the pot luck."
"1","2","maybe it was something I did but they were not good so I'm going to have to give it a 2 only 1 person liked them"
"1","5","These were delicious, i took them to work and everyone raved about them. I made red velvet with cream cheese frosting. I can't wait to try other kinds the possibilities are endless."
"1","1","These things look cute but that's about it! The texture is like raw, goopy/grainy cake mix dipped in chocolate. Once you bite through the yummy chocolate shell, you get to a mushy center. :/ No one in the house like these and I am so upset that I wasted my very expensive chocolate to dip them in! I will never make these again."
"1","5","Difficult to make, but worth it. My friends absolutely loved these! Definitely make sure to refrigerate them before coating though."
"1","5","I have made the Cake Balls several times. I use 2 TB shortening and 1 package chips, melt together to make the frosting. My family loves these. Very easy to make"
"1","5","As a first time cake ball maker I was nervous about mixing the cake with the frosting, but it turned out amazing! My coworkers and family members all thought they were crazy delicious. I used devil's food cake with chocolate frosting and vanilla candy coating, but plan to try other combinations in the near future. Excellent, simple recipe with a great end result!"
"1","5","These cake balls are so addictive! I used Betty Crocker's devil's food cake mix, chocolate frosting, and milk chocolate candy melts. Then i covered the balls in peanuts and marshmallows. They tasted just like the rocky road cake pops from Starbucks. I'm glad I found this recipe because cake pops at starbucks cost $2.50 per cake pop. Now I am saving money by making my own. The whole family loved the cake balls and I will surely make them again. Next time I might use strawberry cake mix, strawberry frosting and dip them in white chocolate. Yum!"
"1","5","So easy to make, not overly time consuming, and super delicious. Beware, they are addictive!"
"1","5","Dangerously tasty and surprisingly easy to make!"
"1","1","these are NOT easy! i baked the cake, chilled it, cut it with a pastry cutter to get a nice crumby texture. it was the dipping part. they took forever because i would take the cookie sheet out of the freezer (thank goodness a different recipe told me to do this!) and roll the balls, refreeze them, dip 5-10 and have to put the cookie sheet back in the freezer. to dip by hand is not possible. i ended up using a chopstick. i saw someone else suggested a toothpick but that's not enough. it did take like 7 hours like another review. someone will have to pretty darn special to get me to make these again."
"1","3","These taste amazing; however, I found that trying to dip them was a pain. It is suggested that you use toothpicks to dip the balls in the chocolate, but the dough is not firm enough for a toothpick to pick up. Maybe refregerate first?"
"1","5","These are wonderful!! You have to follow the directions for thinning the almond bark to dip for the best presentation. Everyone loved them!"
"1","5","Just made these using yellow cake and chocolate fudge icing. I melted butterscotch baking chips for the outside coating and rolled them in crushed pecans. DELICIOUS and so easy! Like others I placed the cake and icing mix in the fridge for about an hour before forming the balls. It was much easier that way."
"1","1","okay so i tried this because i saw this done making hello kitty's but mine did not come out that great ....and the cake mixture was so sweet when mixed with the frosting ugh i was so wanting to make these for my daughters bday but also i didnt refrigerate so maybe thats why it was so hard for me...mayb ill try gain this weekend"
"1","1","did not like would not make again"
"1","2","Do not make with confetti cake mix. They turn out looking like stuffing. Too sweet for me. My husband loved them."
"1","3","Way too much work. Didn't taste very good."
"1","4","These were yummy! I did one set with chocolate cake and chocolate frosting and another with vanilla cake and vanilla frosting. I think I grossly underestimated how messy these were to make though; I will definitely make them again, but only if I buy the egg separator that everyone keeps mentioning."
"1","2","I truly wish I had read the first comment, with directions to stick all this stuff in the refrigerator after mixing - it is indeed a gluey, worthless mess. Also, the chocolate bark was a complete pain, did not melt properly and was impossible to roll the balls around in. Argh!"
"1","4","These are really easy to make and I didn't find them to be time consuming at all. You can make so many different combinations with these. I would have used only 1/2 - 3/4 jar of the icing though. I would have liked a bit more 'cake' - but I know for next time!"
"1","4","I love these! But this was the first time I had ever done these and I agree with everyone else on here who has said only use 1/3 or so of icing. Also freeze them! I also just got so frustrated with dipping them. However it was my first time to do these and I will try to do them again!"
"1","3","I enjoyed these very much. They were simple to make...until I wanted to use them like lolly pop's. The mix would not stay together. I tried refrigerating them a bit which helped. I went on line later, to see what step I may have missed and I didn't. I read a few other recipes that were the same idea and they mentioned freezing the balls for an hour before coating with chocolate. I'll give it another try but this time freezing them first."
"1","4","They taste really good but mine look horrible. I tried freezing them before dipping in the chocolate and everything. They just didn't look nice. My daughter loved helping though and they do taste good"
"1","4","Tastes great! DOn't know why I can't make them look pretty though!"
"1","5","They're cute, simple, and by taking the time to decorate them nicely, everyone figures you bought them somewhere. yum yum yum yum yum. Perfect to make for all those picky eaters out there. Packaged cake mix is inexpensive, so making a variety of flavors is so easy. I used my own homemade frosting. awesome"
"1","4","these turned out very pretty, fun to decorate! the texture was a bit odd, but i think i made them too big. i will continue to play around with this. thank you!"
"1","5","I actually made these by mistake- I was initially making a marble cake, but the cakes didn't come out of my cake mold pan neatly, so I was left with a bowl of crumbly cake crumbs at first. Then I suddenly remembered this recipe and decided to just run with it! I combined the marble cake with some chocolate frosting, then used chocolate flavored almond bark to dip them in. I bought almond bark from the store and didn't like the taste of it on its own, so I melted it with some Hershey's chocolate chips, mixed it together and then it turned out fine. I had to refrigerate the cake balls I rolled overnight, because on their own, they weren't holding together in the dip. Once chilled though, they held together perfectly, and the bark hardened within minutes. My mom said they were like chocolate truffles. Next time, I'm definitely going to mix up cake mixes and frostings. Thanks for this 'save' for botched normal cakes :)"
"1","3","Over-rated"
"1","5","awesome!!!!"
"1","5","Addictive. Adaptable. Fun to make. Impresses everyone. Kids love them. A real keeper!"
"1","3","I only used 1/3 cup of icing. Rolled balls and flattened them. put them in the frezzer for 20. Took them out and used cookie cutters to make shapes, put them back in the freezer for a bit. Dipped sucker sticks in chocolate and inserted them into the shapes. Re froze them til the chocolate set. then took a few out at a time and decorated them :) I found they were alot easier to do when they were froze a bit. They really don't freeze and defrost fast. It's time consuming but I love the shapes rather then the ball.There always a hit where ever I bring them :)"
"1","5","These were really good! I used strawberry cake mix & icing. I had to freeze it a little while before dipping. I dipped some in white chocolate & some in milk chocolate! I plan on trying it with a Red Velvet mix next time!"
"1","5","These are great! They look so professional and impressive when finished! As to some remarks noting these tasted mushy, simply monitor the amount of frosting you add! As long as you can form them into a ball and it can hold itself together, it will be fine! Red Velvet is my personal favorite, my husband enjoys coming up with new combinations he'd like to have :) Great fun!"
"1","4","So easy to make, and every one loved them!"
"1","5","I used these in my Christmas goodie baskets and they were a huge hit. I used orange cake with cream cheese frosting covered with white chocolate and German chocolate cake and coconut/pecan frosting with milk chocolate."
"1","5","These are delicious and beautiful! I used vanilla cake, chocolate frosting, and chocolate coating. Then I sprinkled some nuts on top. I brought them to work and everyone loved them. Someone said they were so pretty she couldn't believe I made them. They are a bit tedious to make, but well worth the effort!"
"1","4","These are a pain to make, but they come out great. I used strawberry cake mix and cream cheese frosting. I refrigerated the mixture for a few hours before using a melon baller to roll into ball. After freezing the balls, I dipped them in white confectioners coating. Very cute Valentine's treat."
"1","4","These are absolutely delicious! I made them for the Super Bowl and everyone couldn't keep their hands off them. I used one box of milk chocolate cake and then made half of it with white whipped frosting and a white almond bark coating and the other half with milk chocolate whipped frosting a chocolate bark coating. I couldn't decide which one I liked best. It is very time consuming and you have to make sure you freeze the cake balls before you dip them in the coating chocolate otherwise they don't hold up very well. Definitely use a toothpick to dip them! Will be making them again!"
"1","5","I took these to my nephew's 3rd birthday party made with confetti cake and frosting... the birthday boy and everyone else ate these all up - SO good!"
"1","5","AMAZING!! Always a big hit wherever I go. I have people requesting them when there is a party."
"1","5","So easy and everyone loved these!"
"1","5","These were great! I made them for a party and everyone loved them. I used Betty Crocker's Cherry Chip cake with cream cheese frosting and semi-sweet chocolate. Everyone commented that they were soft like cookie dough, which made me think that perhaps I mixed too much, packing it together and making it quite dense. Next time, I'll only mix it until the frosting is spread throughout. I'll definitely be making them for many more occasions!"
"1","4","I don't know if it was just me, but these took about four times as much melting chocolate as the recipe called for! Other than that, they were pretty good. I think their charm really lies in the novelty of the 'cake ball,' though. Flavor-wise, it's not really anything overwhelming."
"1","3","This recipes is a little time consuming. It was ok but not worth the effort. It might have been the combination I was using. I did strawberry cake, with vanilla iciing and then dipped in chocolate. Probably won't make again."
"1","5","Once you eat one its all down heel from there! I was making these for a party and had to make another batch just for my family! Went with previous reviewers and put the cake balls in the fridge before dipping them! very simple and easy!"
"1","5","Made these for Christmas for one of the many treats I make. Used chocolate cake mix and chocolate fudge frosting. By far one my favorites out of everything I made. Can't wait to try other flavors."
"1","5","These were so easy to make and everyone loved them. I did not let the cake coll at all. As soon as I took it of the even, I used a spoon to break it up and dumped it in a bowl over the frostin, and it melted the frosting making it easy to mix. The balls formed easilt because of this. Will definitly make these again!! But they are very messy to make!!"
"1","5","I used lemon cake with lemon frosting and coated with white and milk chocolate. They were dynamite."
"1","5","You can freeze the cake balls and pull them out when you are ready for them. I keep some on hand for the kids and their friends. I find freezing the balls first will keep them from breaking up in the chocolate."
"1","5","I made these for Christmas and they were a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. I did all chocolate and added round white sprinkles on top. They looked better than I thought. I even plan on making these for my sister's wedding. I found that these can easily be made ahead of time. I froze a few for a week and took them out last night and defrosted them. They still looked and tasted great! My only problem with the recipe was that it was a little more time consuming than I thought. I also ended up making the balls in my hands, since the mixture was sticking too much to the spoon. With the advice from other reviews, I froze the balls before I dipped them, I would highly recommend this. The chocolate also hardens right away so if you are doing sprinkles, put the sprinkles on right after you dip them. After the chocolate completely hardened I put them in mini cupcake wrappers and they looked great!"
"1","5","I used this recipe as is with red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting! It was wonderful! Everyone gobbled them up!"
"1","5","These were fabulous! For Christmas I used red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting and white chocolate. They were a hit with everyone. I have also made them with devils food cake, milk chocolate icing and dipped in semi-sweet chocolate....for the chocoholic in your life! I will definitely be using this recipe again!"
"1","5","This was a hit with my family!! I also used a whole block of the chocolate bark. I saw someone mentioned using the egg seperater to dip the cake in. I will definitely try that next time."
"1","5","These are sooo yummy. The only suggestion I would have is not to use the whole can of frosting. Use half and then check the moisture of the cake mixture. My Red Velvet was a little too wet. I added a handful of coconut to the devils food cake and dark chocolate frosting. It made it brownie like."
"1","1","I followed the directions and the tips that said use half the frosting and they still were mushy. I was so embarrassed, I made these for Christmas! I have no idea what went wrong but they are not getting a second chance that's for sure."
"1","4","Made these for my daughter's 1st bd party. I attempted to make them into cake pops, decorated like cupcakes. All was well for a while, then some fell off the stick. I chilled the balls & dipped the sticks into chocolate before inserting...not sure what I did wrong. The undipped balls I had left I divided and made into smaller balls before dipping. I coated some with dark chocolate and the others with white chocolate. My husband and guest loved them, but I didn't care much for them. The chocolate w/ chocolate icing were the best. The strawberry with cream cheese frosting stayed mushy."
"1","5","Excellent recipe and everyone loved them. I did the first time with chocolate cake and chocolate frosting. I did put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before rolling into balls and it was not as messy. I did strawberry cake and strawberry frosting for the second batch. Used to teaspoons for the coating and that worked better than a fork or toothpick. I just sprinkled the tops instead of rolling them and that was much easier. Enjoy everyone you will be the hit of the dessert making business."
"1","5","Absolutely loved it!!! I followed recipe exactly and brought to two households over Christmas holiday. Both trays were devoured. I had used Golden Butter moist supreme cake and vanilla frosting for actual cake. For melted chocolate I used Bakers milk chocolate and added a few festive sprinkles."
"1","3","i would have given this a better rating had they not been a disaster. first off i should have stuck with chocolate chocolate chocolate. i will try these again but i will follow the person who refrigerated and froze the balls first. i did cool the cake for 30 min before mixing in icing but when i tried to dip in the chocolate they feel off the toothpick and fork so i had very strange shapes with several holes from me trying to pick them up. i also didnt see confectioners chocolate in my store so i bought baking chocolate which only covered 10 balls so have a glob of cake mixer in my fridge. i dont have problems following recipes and have never messed one up to date but this one got the best of me."
"1","3","These were pretty, but had a very mushy, off-putting texture. I even made the cake and frosting from scratch because I don't like the store-bought taste. I'm glad I tried these, but I would much rather have a traditional piece of cake."
"1","3","I didn't think the chocolate topping was enough and my cake balls were falling apart and hard to dunk in the chocolate coating. They tasted very good, but the presentation could have been better."
"1","4","everyone in my family loved these and i just made homeade frosting which made them delicious."
"1","5","I've made this recipe a few times and my friends and family can't get enough."
"1","5","This recipe was awesome!! I made three various batches of it for Xmas and everyone said they were delish!! I didn't use any bark chocolate since I want to stay away from anything hydrogenated and instead used baking bars of white chocolate and milk chocolate chips. For the last batch I didn't melt them enough so they gave the cake balls a thick coating. I guess if you prefer thin or thick you can adjust that by how much you melt the down chocolate coating. I personally loved the thin white chocolate coating myself. You can realliy get creative with this recipe!! Think I'm going to try boston creme cake balls. Vanilla cake, chocolate coating, and a dollop of pudding in the middle by using some kind of injecter. Mmmmm! Can't wait! Thank you for sharing!!!"
"1","5","Great results. Caution on the time it takes from start to completion. Cooling, preparing balls and dipping are time consuming! Easy but many steps involved. Plan on extra coating and use candy making wafers for best result, have easter egg dipper or lots of toothpicks, spoon and fork do not yield the best result. Plus you will be munching away on these outstanding treasures."
"1","4","These are very rich, but delicious!! Time consuming but worth it! Followed recipe as written!"
"1","3","Do not use the entire container of frosting unless you enjoy mushy. These were good but I think a little frosting goes along way with these balls. We did a funfetti mix with fun fetti frosting dipped in chocolate and red and green frosting for the holidays. Also we did the devils food with the whipped frosting and dipped some in the chocolate and some in the peanut butter. My suggestion to make it easier is to buy a chocolate dipping took from Michaels which was like $4 makes the process a lot easier. Don't skimp on the cooling time bc it helps with the chocolate coating and the ball setting. They are really really sweet so if you are not into that I would pass on this. They are adorable and can be combined with so many different flavors."
"1","5","Quick, easy, yummy! Perfect to make with a toddler or preschooler."
"1","5","THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!! Please excuse the yelling, but holy moly they are fantastic. I used the recommendations from Lex170 and they turned out wonderful. Thanks to both for the recipe and the how-to! WOWSA!"
"1","5","Yummy! Thanks for sharing! These were fun! I put them in the fridge for a few hours, rolled them into balls and put them in the freezer overnight. The next day (day of the party) I dipped them into chocolate and sprinkled christmas decorations on. I used an egg separater to dip and it worked perfectly! Not as much work as I thought, maybe because I did it over two days?"
"1","5","Amazing! Unique and so versatile! I needed something easy to share for my husbands work and his favorite cake is black forest cake. So using this recipe I made a black forest cake inspired one. I had so many compliments on it!! And it was far better then bringing 'cupcakes'. I think these are the new 'cupcakes' for events!! For Christmas I'm going to make different style ones! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!"
"1","5","My friend made this recipe but instaed of Chocolate cake, she used red velvet cake and crumbled it in a bowl, then she added a bar of philadelphia cheese to the crumbled cake, mashed it together until it was rich and almost creamy, lastley, she followed the rest os the recipe as normal and oh my gooooodness!!! It went from yummy to heavinly delectable! You should try it!"
"1","5","I made these for Christmas and everyone loved them. I waited around 45 minutes before I crumbled up the cake and the frosting stirred in easily. After rollling them into balls I put them in the fridge overnight so I could frost them the next day. I used chocolate cake with white frosting and white coating. Dunking them was a little challenging. the toothpick wasn't strong enough to support them so we used a kabob stick. They were delicious and I can't wait to try other combinations."
"1","4","Reallly sweet!! We probably only used 2/3--3/4 can of frosting. We made lemon cake/vanilla frosting dipped in white coating & Christmas confetti cake with vanilla frosting dipped in milk choc. Once you get the right consistency in the coating its pretty easy."
"1","3","My attempt at this recipe ended in frustration and disappointment. Everything seemed to be going well until it came time to dip them in the coating. 3 ozs. did not seem to be nearly enough for the number of cake balls I had to coat. About the first 6 turned out great and then the coating started getting too stiff to work with and when I tried to thin it out I ended up with a mess. Others have had luck with this recipe so I guess it's just me!"
"1","3","i made these in red velvet and german chocolate flavor. they were just okay. I thought i was pass these out as our xmas candy, but I am going back to our usual xmas candy we give out, oreo truffles. people BEG for those"
"1","4","Made these Saturday just as the recipe says. Came out great and everyone at work loved them."
"1","4","Followed the recipe as written using red velvet cake mix and cream cheese frosting. A bit time consuming overall, but I expected that. I coated mine with chocolate almond bark, finding that I had the best luck using a regular old spoon, rolling them around, and placing them on waxed paper. My girls really liked them, but they like anything sweet! I found them OK, but not something that will be a staple recipe for me."
"1","1","Took the advise to moisten hands to handle, and the cake was mushy in middle. Overall these looked nice but tasted not to my liking."
"1","5","I have made these for a few years. They are easy,and everybody loves them. You do have to freeze them and take your time. I can make a batch of them in a few hours, but no whare near 7. TRY THEM YOU WILL LOVE THEM!"
"1","3","this is a good dessert but like others said you have to read the reveiws first because you need to freeze the balls before or refrigerate them because mine turned out disasterous but still good"
"1","5","Oh yum. These were a hit at Thanksgiving. They all got gobbled up! Messy to make, but tasty, and the flavor combinations that are possible are endless. I chose to do a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate coating (not bark). Had to use extra chocolate coating. Some guests said they tasted like ding dongs without the cream filling. Personally, I thought they were tastier than that. I'll make these again, maybe try a different flavor combo then..."
"1","5","not as hard as i thought they would be... and theres a cupcake shop near me that sells these lollicakes for somewhere around 3 bucks-a piece!!!"
"1","1","did not enjoy this recipe at all"
"1","5","Excellent! Takes a little practice but worth the effort. I made devils food with milk chocolate frosting and coated with Wilton candy melts in peanut butter flavor~tasted just like Drakes Funny Bones~Yum!"
"1","4","Im amazed at the rave and review these got after how simple they were to make. I never thought my family was going to make as big of a deal over these as they did. Im telling you they dissapeared and stole the dessert spotlight when i served them for thanksgiving. i only gave this 4 stars because the prepared frosting i feel was a little too sweet. in my opinion if a self made buttercream was used it might have been better, but over all this is a winner"
"1","5","Fairly easy; Super addictive. I used chocolate fudge cake mix, chocolate batter, and pulverized candy canes. Covered with white chocolate, they were delicious!"
"1","4","Used lemon cake mix, lemon frosting and dipped in white chocolate and then rolled in coconut...I was so tired from making them I didn't eat but 1 :) But, took to church and husband and church and kids loved them"
"1","5","Very easy and very good. Everyone who tasted these loved them. I did the chocolate with chocolate frosting and chocolate almond bark, and I can't wait to try other combinations."
"1","5","These are rich, delicious, and unique. They were the hit of the party, and I love that there are so many flavor combinations to suit different tastes. I just rolled the balls with my hands and that worked out fine. I also tried dipping in chocolate with my fingers, but I burned myself a couple of times so I would not recommend trying that. I agree with other reviews saying that this did take quite a long time, so be prepared!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly and it went perfectly. I had them off to the side during a party and people were snatching them up before dinner was even finished! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","DELECTABLE!!!! Made them for Christmas and they were amazing!! One made with spice cake and homemade cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate. And one made with the Hershey's recipe for perfectly chocolate, chocolate cake and frosting, then dipped in semi sweet chocolate and sprinkled with chopped candy canes. A very big hit!! And oh so cute!! Followed other reviewers suggestions and did not add total amount of frosting."
"1","5","These are now famous in my house. Everyone loves these. I bring them to parties and stuff. They disappear so fast. They are so rich though. A little too rich for me, but with plenty of milk, they're gooood."
"1","5","A lot of people love these. The time consuming part is the dipping but worth it. I love the versatility of combinations with cake mix and frosting. I buy tubed decorators frosting and put little designs on them because I use toothpicks to dip and they leave holes on top."
"1","4","The batter was a little difficult to manuver with but the taste of the cookies was fabulous!"
"1","5","I just dipped these in the chocolate and they're in my fridge :) I ate one before I dipped it in the chocolate and it was amazing! Fantastic and creative."
"1","4","These are delicious! Mine didn't turn out very pretty, but they tasted wonderful! I used red velvet cake, vanilla frosting, and melted Tollhouse morsels for the coating."
"1","1","tasted decent. confectioners coting too thick"
"1","4","Tasty but time comsuming. I made red velvet with vanilla coating. By fault of my own, the red cake tinted my coating, so they were not very attractive. Still good though. :)"
"1","4","Good!! Everyone liked them."
"1","5","Amazing!! I did chocolate fudge cake mix/chocolate frosting and butter cake mix/vanilla frosting both dipped in milk chocolate. I seriously couldn't stop eating them. Next I'm going to try banana cake mix/cream cheese frosting!!"
"1","5","Love this recipe, will be making millions of these I'm sure! I have people asking for them now! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","These would probably be a 5 if I would have followed the recipe. However I didn't have frosting on hand and didn't especially feel like making any. So I used flavored creamer like another reviewer suggested. They tasted delicious but I need to work on my chocolate dipping skills. I made cherry cake mix w/ amaretto creamer & semi-sweet chocolate, and butter pecan cake mix w/ latte creamer and butterscotch chips (delish!). I think they would be better with frosting (less dense?) and plan to try it soon."
"1","5","I just made cake balls last night and here is what I learned: After baking the cake, you only need to let it cool for a few minutes before breaking it apart. Break it apart in a bowl with a big spoon until very crumbly, then add the frosting. When using white cake mix, you may need to use a can and a half of frosting. This mixture would be great by itself (I imagine just sitting down with the bowl, spoon in hand, chick flick in the dvd player). After rolling mixture into balls, stick in freezer for about an hour, till firm. Then poke with skewer, dip into melted almond bark, twirl off of skewer onto wax paper, apply topping (sprinkles, nuts, etc.), and let it set. The cold temperature of the balls will set the almond bark quickly. These were amazingly delicious and very rich!"
"1","5","These are so simple to have such an elegant appearance! I always end up using more chocolate for dipping than the recipe calls for. Easy enough for any spontaneous occasion, fancy enough for special occasions!"
"1","5","Great, and easy recipe that makes me look like I am a professional baker! The only I change I made was using Toll House white and dark chocolate chips to make the coating. I then added a smidge of shortening in and they came out pretty well considering I was kinda winging it. I wish I had an egg seperator it would have made it much easier, instead I just used a spoon. Enjoy! :)"
"1","4","End result is not worth the effort it takes to make them."
"1","5","Great taste and lots of fun! I agree with the previous reviewers who suggest refrigerating for several hours- it made them much easier to dip."
"1","5","I love these. I will be making them for my son's wedding. Still trying to figure out how to make them pretty. Definitely freeze for several hours, even overnight. When making balls, only take out a little of the chilled dough at a time. Melt small amounts of chocolate and only have a few chilled balls out at once. Keep everything chilled. You can add a small amount of solid shortening to melted chocolate to thin out. I have used Wilton chocolates and also almond bark. The Wilton needed to be thinned."
"1","4","Everyone liked these. They are great for kiddos- nice little bites of cake without the mess!"
"1","4","This recipe was good! Although, I don't care much for choc. cake, so I recommend using yellow cake mix, white frosting and white almond bark. To melt the almond bark, just throw it in the microwave and,stirring occasionally, it will melt really quick! Be sure to buy the flavor-full almond bark, not cheap almond bark."
"1","5","I made these for a work BBQ. They were a huge success, and so easy to make. I used funfetti cake mix and chocolate funfetti frosting. I froze the cake\frosting mixure and then rolled them in melted chocolate chips. I sprinkled them with I'll the 'funfetti' Then stored them in the fridge. They were good cold, but even better at room temp. I try a white cake \ strawberry frosting combo next."
"1","5","messy, cool ingredients"
"1","5","Wonderful! Delicious! Heavenly! These were a huge hit! Mine took 2- 16 ounces of candy coating for 2 cakes. I made red velvet with whipped cream cheese frosting dipped some in chocolate and some in vanilla."
"1","2","I didn't care for these. My hometown has a bakery that makes cake balls, and they are wonderful. These were mushy and had no cakelike qualities. The ratio of icing to cake seemed too high for me. I will try again with less icing."
"1","4","My family was impressed. They turned out yummy and pretty but it seemed like a lot of work to me so I don't think I'll make them again."
"1","5","This turned out great, well, the second time. Very important to only use the amount of icing that they say. I made my own recipe, but I didn't bother to measure it, so the first batch was a gooey mess. I used choc cake with strawberry icing, then dipped it in milk choc. It tasted like a choc-strawberry truffle. So goooood!"
"1","4","Pretty good... though they remind me of Little Debbie snack cakes. I used almost an entire 24-oz pkg of almond bark to dip all the cake balls in."
"1","5","Nothing gets better than cake balls. I chose triple chocolate cake with 1/2 to 3/4 can of chocolate frosting and used semi-sweet bakers chocolate with shortening (3 Tbls choc: 1 1/2 Tbls shortening). I highly recommend freezing the balls before dipping in the chocolate. I needed almost 3xs as much chocolate as called for in the recipe. For a neat twist put popsicle sticks into the balls for cake pops. Absolutely amazing."
"1","5","I made these for a family reunion, the first batch I used spice cake with vanilla frosting then dipped them in cinnamon chips, they turned out awesome! The next batch I made with lemon cake and vanilla frosting that I added lemon extract too, I then melted white chocolate chips added lemon extract and a few drops of yellow food coloring, they turned out great, Both of the batches were a little crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside, everyone really enjoyed them."
"1","5","delicious! have made a few times with different cake mixes & glazes... time consuming but well worth it!! a huge hit with everyone"
"1","5","This is a great recipe with a great presentation. I used the Magnolia Bakery's red velvet cake recipe (find it on epicurious..com) with HALF the recipe on this site for Cream Cheese Frosting II. It will turn out too moist if you use the full frosting recipe so use half and mix it with about 3/4 of the red velvet cake. I used others suggestions and let the cake cool for 30 min before mixing with the frosting, refrigerated it overnight, rolled into balls, froze for 1/2 hr then used vanilla almond bark for the coating. They were PERFECT, I have served them for 4 occasions in the last month, drizzle on some dark chocolate or roll half in chocolate sprinkles for best presentation. I had trouble finding the almond bark but finally found that Walmart carries it so be sure to look there!"
"1","5","This is my first time making these, and I have to say I'm impressed. I honestly expected these to be some sort of crumbly ripoff of a truffle, but they turned out incredibly smooth and chocolaty. If you freeze them longer, the almond bark hardens up, leaving it crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Delish!! I also liked how easy they were to make. I'm a kid, and I made these with no hassle! :) Now, I'm going to put these to the ultimate test: A party! Let's see how the crowd likes them. Thanks for sharing!!!"
"1","5","OMG ! These were great.... I put them in the fridge after I rolled them into balls to make it easier to dip them in the chocolate...wow! even better the 2nd day"
"1","5","I have a question. Has anyone tried freezing these after you had dipped them in chocolate? How did they turn out?"
"1","3","I would freeze the balls before dipping. The recipe is good and easy to follow, just too sweet for me. I love sweets. I thought it was just to much. Maybe I was having an off day. :)"
"1","1","I had a difficult time making these look appealing. I kept getting the cake in the coating and they looked so bad i through the whole mess out. Sounded good but the dipping in chocolate is harder than it should be since the cake mixture just fell apart. And yes I did freeze it first"
"1","1","one big mess"
"1","2","I thought these were rather boring, nothing special. I was going to serve these on Easter but I threw them away."
"1","5","I've made these twice in the past 2 weeks. Everyone that tried them said they were great. Very simple but time consuming."
"1","5","These are the best and simplest dessert! For those of you having such a difficult time with the dipping. I always save my wire egg dippers from Easter. Simply modify the size of the dipper and it makes it a breeze to dip these!"
"1","5","This was SUCH a great recipe! My friends could not believe I made it myself because it looked so lovely and professional. I also gave it to a colleague who said it was 'freakin' delicious' :D Some tips for first time makers though: I myself didn't know what everyone meant by using toothpics/forks/skewers to dip the cake balls so it took me a few tries. But what I did was melt a small bowl worth of chocolate, stick the cake balls on a toothpick (right after removing them from the freezer so they were really cold), and dip the balls almost all the way. I left a little bit of cake uncovered around the toothpick, and just waited til the chocolate hardened and removed them from the toothpick, with the uncovered portion as the base. I am definitely going to try these again, with different flavors!"
"1","4","I made 2 batches of these for my niece's bridal shower. They were very good and got lots of great comments. I made one lemon cake mix with lemon frosting and dipped in white chocolate, and one chocolate cake mix with caramel frosting dipped in milk chocolate. Both were delicious. I found I needed the entire 16 oz package of chocolate coating for each batch, 3 oz. would never have worked! Also, I found that I had to freeze the cake balls first before dipping because they tended to fall apart. Then, because the cake balls were so cold, I had to keep re-melting the chocolate because it got thicker as it got colder. I used my pampered chef cookie dough scoop to make the balls, it worked perfectly! I didn't like the hassel of dipping...wish there was a better way that was easier. Otherwise...they were fantastic!"
"1","4","I used a white cake, lemon frosting, and vanilla almond bark. They were delicious, but a little overly sweet. I think if I make them again I might try melted chocolate chips instead of the candy coating."
"1","5","Very easy! Made great gifts. Will definitely make again."
"1","3","I have to pretty much agree with Pyrex Cook. I had the same experience. My kids liked them though. But, hey, they pretty much like anything sweet. These were Waaaaaaay too sweet for me. One bite and I was done."
"1","5","OMG these are amazing! I have gotten a million requests after making these and bringing them into work. Everyone thinks I am the best cook in the world now! Thanks :-) Oh and I did chill the cake balls before dipping in chocolate, too gooey if not!"
"1","5","Mine turned out perfectly. I used yellow cake mix and chocolate fudge frosting (half can). I dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with 2 Tbsp. shortening."
"1","5","Oh my, oh my! I just made this as an early 'happy birthday to me' & they are frickin' awesome! I used red velvet cake with cream cheese icing & vanilla coating...tasted like a little ball of heaven!! YUM YUM YUM!"
"1","3","Followed recipe exactly. Did as others advised and chilled mixture well, then made balls. Froze balls. They were still too soft to pick up with a toothpick or fork or skewer. All in all, a big mess. I still have most of the balls in the freezer -- will try coating them again tomorrow, maybe."
"1","5","This recipe is simply fantastic. I followed it exactly as written, and they came out beautifully. I used a double chocolate cake mix, double chocolate frosting and dark chocolate bark--chocolate overload, and insanely addictive. One cake mix and one can of frosting made two dozen balls with the size of my scoop, but I think I might make them slightly smaller next time so that they are truly bite-sized. I brought these to a Valentine's Day Pot Luck dinner and they disappeared before the main dishes! Awesome recipe--thanks Allison!"
"1","4","My cake balls didn't turn out very well, but mostly I think because I tweaked the recipe a lot. First, I ran out of eggs and substituted heavy cream for the eggs in the cake mix. Then, thinking it would help the balls hold together better, I undercooked the cake by about 2 or 3 minutes. I only added half the can of frosting, but I still think that it was too much, especially when my cake was already sticking to itself very well. When I rolled the balls, the mixture wasn't at all crumb-y. It was more like fudge - solid but 'gooey'. I froze them for an hour, like another reviewer suggested and it really helped with the dipping. I dipped the balls in a milk chocolate ganache that didn't set. It still hasn't set, and it's been 24 hours. Next time, (because there will definitely be a next time,) I think I will just use chocolate chips, not a ganache. They taste great, (I used yellow cake mix with triple chocolate fudge frosting,) but it's too chewy. I used small tongs to dip my balls with, it was really easy. I would put four or five balls into the pot with the ganache and roll them around to coat, then take them out. It only took me 30 minutes to bake the cake, 20 minutes to roll the balls and 20 to dip them. What added the time for me was chilling the mixture, and then freezing the formed balls. Total, it took me two hours to make these. If I hadn't messed up, it would have been worth it, so I will be making these again."
"1","4","These are fairly simple to make, although the dipping process I found to be a little difficult. I suspect it is partially because I didn't wait for them to freeze before dipping, and also because I couldn't find the confectioner's coating. I used melted chocolate chips, both white chocolate and milk chocolate (separately). I still had cake balls leftover after using 2 entire packages, so it's not exactly the least expensive recipe. However, they make a cute presentation when you buy the mini paper liners to put them in. Hint, follow the advice to keep your hands wet while rolling the balls. It definitely makes a huge difference!"
"1","5","These are great! Endless variations for flavor on this recipe. I chose to add a small package of strawberry banana jell-o (dry) to the cake mix before baking and then used a vanilla frosting - delicious! The cake balls are excellent frozen, even without the exterior coating. The appearance is definitely impressive!"
"1","5","This recipe is awesome!!! I always get requests for this recipe. It is pretty time consuming, so I always make these with a partner."
"1","3","Pretty good. Like the versatility but it's easier to just eat cake ... better for you too."
"1","5","Very rich but awesome! I made them with red velvet/cream chs frosting and melted white chocolate chips! Recommend a tall glass of milk for one cake ball ;-)"
"1","4","I have been making cake balls for quite some time. I like to call them cake truffles. Anyway, try mixing them with a chocolate ganache or home made buttercream- the flavor is great! If you don't mind them taking a little bitlonger to set up try using your favorite chocolate bar. That makes them even tastier. I love using Symphony bars. yum!"
"1","3","This recipe is a lot of work, and I am not crazy about how sweet and dense the cake balls are. Also, it made a real mess in the kitchen. I made two kinds, red velvet with cream cheese frosting and white chocolate coating, and chocolate with fudge frosting and chocolate coating (I like the latter better, its less sweet if you can believe that). The white chocolate chips did not melt very well, just not as good of a texture as the chocolate coating. I made an egg dipper out of bailing wire, and that worked well."
"1","5","YUMMO!!! Might be a messy process but soooo worth it :)"
"1","5","So good! I used strawberry cake mix with vanilla frosting, then dipped some of the cake balls in white chocolate and some in milk chocolate. I had to use shortening to make the melted chocolate thin enough - it seemed to set too fast and I had to keep putting it back in the microwave and adding shortening to make it thinner."
"1","3","These were okay. I used vanilla cake mix and cherry frosting. I dipped half in white chocolate and half in milk chocolate. The milk chocolate was better."
"1","4","Umm? I don't really know what to make of this. I was expecting something different but not sure what. I felt that they were ok, everyone else seemed to loved them. They were a lot of work and in the end I'm not sure they were worth it. I think next time I will just get my chocolate fix from a candy store."
"1","5","Quite a lot of work, but not difficult and well worth it for the end result -- makes a huge quantity of candy."
"1","3","they were ok, not as good as i expected, a bit dense for my taste."
"1","5","I love these!! My daughter loves these! We had so much fun making them and they are easy as can be. They take some time to cover in chocolate and decorate but that is the best part of making them. So much better than the hum drum cake and we had a marvelous time customizing them to what everyone loves. My favorite is red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting covered in white chocolate! I will be making these all the time as a nice after dinner treat."
"1","3","I used yellow cake mix and chocolate frosting to make these. I dipped half of them in reg. chocolate and half of them in white chocolate. Honestly, I thought they would be a little yummier than they were. They were very rich and thick. I also thought it was a little too much work for the outcome... so did my mother in law and my husband. They weren't bad though."
"1","4","I just made these this evening. I was hesitant to make them at first because they seemed to be quite difficult to master according to other reviewers. However, I found them quite easy to make and they came out very good :) I decided to go with a strawberry cake mix, strawberry frosting and milk chocolate coating. I baked my cake as directed.. let it cool completely, crumbled it up added the frosting and mixed until it got to be like a play-doh consistency, rolled them out; I ended up with 33 balls. I let them them sit for 2 hrs. Melted my chocolate and for me the hardest part was dipping them. They set up well. Very good, however it has made my blood sugar spike! They are quite rich! Still, they are good and worth the time to make. I like that you can use a variety of cake mixes and frostings as well!"
"1","5","Love, love love! These are amazing and pretty easy to make!"
"1","5","was a great bake sale item, and got so many good reviews, I will make these again and again"
"1","5","These are always a hit. This is the second year that I have made them as gifts for Christmas. The favorite seems to be german chocolate cake and icing dipped in chocolate. Yummy!"
"1","5","Wonderful for gift giving. All the possible flavor combinations will make your head spin. Thanks for sharing. I recieved rave reviews on the gift boxes that I made w/ them this Christmas season."
"1","4","These were really tasty but they were labor intensive and I (probably in the minority here) had a really tough time getting the chocolate on. I would have only given them three stars but everyone I gave them to (valentine's treats for co-workers) RAVED about them so they got an extra star."
"1","5","Awesome! My kids were eating them before I could even get them dipped in the almond bark! Yum! Will make again!"
"1","5","I made these for Christmas- they were a huge hit! These did not take long to make at all. I followed the directions and they looked amazing. I'm sure I will make these again. (I used milk chocolate cake mix, milk chocolate icing, and chocolate almond bark, then to add finishing touches-- sprinkled some walnuts on top.)"
"1","5","I used white cake mix and 1/2 tub chocolate frosting. I froze the balls to make it easier to dip. I needed 4 7oz chocolate bars to coat. I used dark chocolate. They were a big hit!"
"1","5","these are very good. I took them to work and everyone loved them. They do take a little time to make but well worth it."
"1","5","This was the easiest and most fun recipe to make. If you do not have the time to take your time on this, wait until you do. I made the cake and mixed the frosting in and refrigerated it over night. I did not use the entire container of frosting. I read where people talked about the balls not sticking together, you need to keep washing the frosting off your hands for it to stick together. Also, I used a chop stick inserted in the ball to dip. Don't forget to add a little shortening to thin out the chocolate, if not it will be too thick."
"1","5","IT IS CRITICAL TO READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS - ITSJEANETTIC was very helpful to me. 1. ONLY USE 1/2 a can of frosting. 2. work with cold cookie sheets 3. refrigerate in between completing 4. I use semi-sweet chips w/ whipping cream about 1 cup chips to 1/2 cup cream. 5. I also use Andes in some of ganache/coating 6. I also used 1/2 a marachino cherry in some of the balls. Next - I want to try adding some liquor for adult gatherings: amaretto, coffee liquor, etc."
"1","5","Soooo good. I used chocolate cake, milk chocolate icing, and dark chocolate coating...yummy. They are a little messy when making, but the dark chocolate melting chips set hard. A little like a truffle...Big hit at family get together!!"
"1","5","These are phenomenal-even better if you make the cake and frosting from scratch. A couple of suggestions to make these easier are to add the frosting a little at a time. You only need enough frosting to be able to shape the dough. I also used melted chocolate chips with a little butter to thin to do the coating. No need to refrigerate before shaping if the consistency is right but an hour or two in the freezer before dipping helps a whole lot. If they don't look too pretty after dipping drizzle a little melted chocolate in a contrasting color over the imperfections."
"1","4","I just spent all morning making these. Like others suggested, I used half the icing. I then put them in the fridge for an hour to make them easier to work with. After i balled them, I put them in the freezer for one hour. I used almond bark and it was such a pain. It hardened pretty much on contact, and did not turn out all pretty like I had hoped. It was easier for me to spoon the almond bark over the balls rather than dip then into the bark. I used cherry cake and cherry frosting with chocolate almond bark. They taste really good, but not pretty enough for me to take them to a Christmas party like I had hoped. Any suggestions on how to make them look better??? Should I not have used almond bark?"
"1","4","followed recipe to a 'T'. Made lollipops with different toppings. They were good."
"1","5","These are so Easy to make and a lot of fun to decorate. I did Freeze them for one hour after I mixed them in with the icing ,and after I rolled them into balls I froze them again for another hour. I plan on making some to give away as gifts this year! Thanks for posting this recipe!"
"1","3","These are good but thought they would be better. They do get a little time consuming dipping all those balls and it is hard to get to look nice. Mine never turn out like the ones in the pictures. They are alittle gooey inside, maybe use less frosting and make sure your chocolate is thin so it doesnt get clumpy. I dont know if it is worth all the time involved. All it is is boxed cake mix, nothing special."
"1","2","These were too sweet for me and a little too hard to make. Sorry!"
"1","5","These are tasty little treats. Used much more than 3 ounces of coating. Made homemade frosting."
"1","3","End result was nice enough, but I hoped it would be less labor intensive - despite following suggestions to freeze balls, these were a pain to coat - what I found to work best was to dip half the ball and lay that (dipped side down) on wax paper, let that set, then dip other half in (used red velvet cake/crm cheese frosting/white coating/green sprinkles -cake speckled the coating. If I make these again, I wouldn't use all the frosting - made cake balls seem doughy/uncooked.) My daughter didn't mind my problems, as she got to eat the 'ugly' ones that I didn't think turned out well : ) (if hand rolling, I suggest using latex gloves, esp if using red velvet cake!)"
"1","4","They deserve a 5 star when you follow the reviewer's suggestions: freeze before coating, use less frosting, and chocolate chips rather than coating chocolate"
"1","4","Messy to make, but we did chocolate cake, seedless raspberry jam + a little chocolate frosting and melted chocolate chips to coat with. Very good combination!"
"1","5","Fun and E-Z, the possibilities are endless! This is the total RAGE for this year! Be sure and check out my blog today for definitive Cake Ball ideas - then tomorrow's blog has even more cranked up versions. Get your inspiration here! http://www.manorbooks.wordpress.com"
"1","3","I thought these would be better given all the rave reviews. The taste was only okay in our opinion and not worth the work."
"1","5","This recipe is awesome!! I had one batch that seemed to be a little too soft to roll so I added some coconut to absorb the moisture and they were extra yummy!!!"
"1","5","Loved this receipe. I made several batches using different flavors. They freeze wonderfully for future use and make great gifts."
"1","5","I made this with home-made 'Red Velvet Cake I' and 'Seven Minute Frosting I' recipes (to cut down on fat and a bit of sugar). The ratio of cake to frosting was good with these recipes (I didnt have too much of either). I waited for the cake to cool completely before crumbling it, but you could probably do it warm too. I stored the crumbs in an airtight container until I was ready to make the frosting (if you do this, make sure it's completely cool or it will get soggy). After I added the frosting and balled them, I froze them and then coated them in melted chocolate chips. Turned out great! They were moist and chocolatey, and they looked great too :)"
"1","5","So easy and very good."
"1","5","oh these are good alright but I got awesome design ideas from other sites."
"1","5","Awesome!"
"1","5","Talk about rave reviews! I made these last year for a Christmas party and had to give the recipe to several people. I've used milk chocolate cake and frosting with chocolate almond bark topping, as well as white chocolate almond bark with red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting. This year I'm trying chocolate cake/almond bark with caramel frosting. I love it when my goodies look like they came straight from the candy shop!"
"1","5","One word. yummy. Worth the work. Still can't figure out how to dip them neatly or eaily, but worth every bite."
"1","3","These are good but very difficult to make. Even with freezing the balls before dipping they still thaw and kind of fall apart in the almond bark. The Easy Oreo Truffles on this site are much easier and just as good if not better than these."
"1","5","These are amazing! you have to try to make them atleast once. They're so easy and everyone thinks that it some sort of decadent candy that took all day."
"1","5","I had these at a farmer's market and loved them, then quick looked up the recipe. They could't be easier to make, but they look and taste like you put hours of effort into them, haha. I made them for a baby shower and everyone was asking how to make them!! Unique!"
"1","5","A new fav dessert for anyone who I've made try them. Recipe is great as it, but a few helpful hints: 1. mix the cake with the frosting as soon as it's out of the oven--it's easier. 2. chill the mixture just for a few mins (30 min is fine) so that it's a little easier to work with when forming the balls. 3. REFRIDGERATE the balls when complete. Store them in the fridge. They stay moist and delicious, and the choc holds up so well."
"1","5","Too good! Used two different boxed cake mixes and frostings. Next time I think I will make my own homemade cakes just so I can take all the credit on Thanksgiving :) YES it is time consuming but its all in your attitude. It was a lot of fun getting messy rolling the cake balls. Best if made the day before because I did have to freeze the balls before rolling them in chocolate (they were too soft) In the end WORTH the time and mess. Just have a positive attitude and be ready for all the compliments!"
"1","5","I LOVE THESE! So does everyone with whom I share them!! Add some paraffin wax to the melted chocolate covering...makes them beautiful and set up very nicely. Did I mention that I LOVE THESE!!!"
"1","3","This recipe was good, but nothing spectacular. I thought the mixture was a bit too moist-I would much rather eat cake like normal with the frosting on top. I followed the advice from the reviews and cooled the cake (I baked a rainbow chip) before using a stand mixer to make it into crumbs. I used 2/3 of a can of frosting (also rainbow chip). Using a tablespoon measure, it made 75 balls which I froze for 8 hours. It took about 1.5 pounds of melted white chocolate candy to coat. I immediately sprinkled each ball with nonpareils before the coating had a chance to harden. They took about 2 hours to make overall, not including the freezing time. My husband liked them better than me--he is a middle school teacher, and he said his co-workers and students loved them. They were VERY sweet."
"1","5","I made a pistachio chocolate bundt cake that burned and cut off the burnt part and made these with chocolate frosting. Rolled them in chopped pistachio nuts. They were such a hit! Also did white cake with white frosting. I put almond flavoring in the frosting. When making the balls I put a half of a marachino cherry in the middle. Another hit! I refrigerated before rolling...much easier...froze all the different varieties for the holiday and will add them to my holiday cookie platters to give away! Easy!"
"1","5","Very yummy! And super moist too. I made it with German Chocolate cake and coconut pecan frosting dipped in chocolate coating. I sprinkled some with coconut, some with pecans, and left some plain."
"1","5","I'm rating this recipe 5 stars for taste and ease.; they didn't look great. I love the versatility of this recipe & although I used devil's food cake, milk chocolate frosting and chocolate almond bark, I think I'm going to try different flavors next time. Also, I think I'm going to have to read up on using melted chocolate cause mine wasn't easy to dip."
"1","5","Very good recipe! I used funfetti cake and buttercream frosting (I had some I wanted to use up). My frosting was blueish-green so it kind of had a funky color to it, but it still tasted great! I rolled the balls in semi-sweet chocolate. Can't wait to try this with other flavors!"
"1","4","These are very easy to make...the worst most difficult part is dipping them in the chocolate coating. I suggest rolling the balls placing on a tray and freezing for a few minutes before dipping them. I brought them to work and my co-workers loved them!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness.....sooo sooo good and soo soo addicting. My friend made them for my baby shower, she used strawberry cake and white chocolate (I was having a girl) and they were delicious!"
"1","5","These were great. I made these for the Holidays and everyone loved them. I will be making them again this year. Thanks for the recipie!"
"1","5","I used this recipe and LOVED IT. I did let the cake cool completely and then used a scoop to make the balls. I used my hands to smooth them out after i scooped. I used Lemon cake with lemon frosting covered in white chocolate and they were divine!! Also garnished with a little lemon peel curl. I am currently working on some with swiss chocolate cake, chocolate buttercream icing and chocolate coating...i will let you know how those turn out. there are endless possibilities!!!!!"
"1","5","These are so easy & look impressive! The secret is chilling the dough before you scoop them into balls."
"1","2","Perhaps this recipe requires more technique explanation. I read so many reviews & cooled the cake & only used 1/3 tub frosting, chilled them, etc. The bark was way too thick for dredging, added water & what a mess! Finally sorted it out & they were delicious & make such a presentation. Would be great for cookie tray, hostess gift, dish to pass, etc. I don't think these took that long or were that difficult (once you have learned all the 'secrets.) & will probably make these several times trying out all the suggested combinations. However, the recipe as is gets 2 stars because I shouldn't have to go to another website or read 100 reviews to figure it out. Poor recipe, great idea!"
"1","5","Oh wow. Once you get the science of these bad boys down, they most definitely live up to the hype. It seems like everyone has a slightly different method that works best for them. It took me a few tries to get it right, but I'm so glad I kept trying and I encourage anyone who didnt have much luck the first time to give it a 2nd (or 3rd!) shot. My first attempt, I used the whole can of frosting and mixed it in while the cake was still warm. I ended up with a mushy, odd texture that wouldnt firm up even after hours of freezing and tasted a bit like ABC (already been chewed) cake. The second time, I let the cake cool completely, used only enough frosting to make everything stick together, and dipped in melted Baker's Chocolate. Well, the cake texture and flavor was great, but the Baker's melted all over our fingers when we tried to eat them, so for my third try I am determined to get perfect results. I ordered Merkin's Chocolate Coatings from Amazon (I checked every store in the small town I'm from and no one had almond bark or dipping chocolate) and cant wait to make them when they arrive."
"1","4","This recipe is great but it's trial and error. Here are a few tips I learned while making them.. Freeze the cake balls after you have mixed it with icing. Heat Almond Bark on Stove and add Crisco to thin. After desired consistency, remove from heat and dip balls to cover."
"1","4","Mixed review. I sent these to work with my fiance, and he reports that people liked them a lot - and why not? They're cute and sweet. But my objection is that I spent a few hours making these and not a thing about them is homemade. In that amount of time I could have made a cake and frosting from scratch! However, while that would have been more pleasing to me, these cake balls are pleasing to a crowd, so they served their purpose. I would make these again for people who would appreciate their cuteness and not care so much that they're made from ingredients that came from boxes and cans. Five stars from coworkers and three stars from me averages to four stars."
"1","5","Aside from the mess that comes with dipping in chocolate, these were easy and quite a crowd pleaser."
"1","5","These were soooo good! I used white cake and vanilla frosting with white almond bark coating. They were absolutely amazing. They were really rich, and milk is a must while eating these. They taste the best if refrigerated overnight."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! I made several flavors with different toppings for a bake sale. The balls sold out in no time and everyone was asking for the recipe!"
"1","5","I finally got a chance to make these last night. They weren't as difficult as everyone made them sound. They're a little time consuming, but not too bad. Instead of a whole can of frosting, I used about half. I used devil's food cake, chocolate frosting dipped in melted dark chocolate wafers that you buy in the candy section at Michael's. I also bought the cheap chocolate dipping set that worked nicely. Very yummy! My husband isn't a big sweet eater, but he liked them a lot!"
"1","5","This turned out really good. I followed other suggestions and chilled the dough for a little while before I used a cookie scoop to make the balls. This made it very quick and the balls were all uniform in size. Dipping wasn't that fun, but well worth the effort."
"1","4","With all the hype for this recipe, i was expecting something a little more. I originally wanted to give this a three star rating, however, I think if i used a different flavored cake and icing i would have liked it more. I used vanilla cake and cream cheese icing. Next time i will do something with chocolate cake and add some nuts in them. It is a very basic recipe and leaves the door wide open for however you would like to manipulate it to suit yourself!"
"1","5","i think that this recipe is certainly time consuming, one should have in mind to take their day slowly to get this done. i made and chilled the cake overnight, made the frosting the next day and stuck the balls in the freezer for 2 hours. a really great treat for guests! good thing to have company or i'd eat them all! ack!"
"1","5","These were great!!! Super easy just a little time consuming. My daughter made these all by herself and she's just a teen so anyone can do. Although I would say to definately use Devil's Food Cake style. When my daughter made them she use some sort of fudge one that made them taste a little too rich but other than that so definatley use the ingredients given and you'll have a yummy, addicting dessert!"
"1","5","These are wonderful! Thought it was time consuming, but well worth it!"
"1","1","i used red velvet cake mix and whipped cream cheese frosting. i used the whole can of frosting and the cake was still very crumbly and hard to mold together. i think if i used regular icing it might have worked better. but i managed to get a few cake balls out and froze them. i used white chocolate chips for the coating. for some reason they would just not melt smooth. the lumps in the white chocolate stayed even after i added a LOT of shortening! i was trying to get it to smooth out more so it would be easier to dip and i added some water. boy was that a HUGE mistake! the white chocolate curdled up and became all lumpy. i tried dipping a ball in it to see if it would still taste good but it wasn't. i ended up with a huge mess and no cake balls :'(. if i do this recipe again i will make sure to follow the reviews 100% and dont use whipped icing or white choc chips!"
"1","1","I don't get it. I didn't like these at all, maybe I did something wrong."
"1","5","These are SO delicious and definitely addicting. they are very easy to make. Mine didn't come out as beautiful as the picture with the recipe, but once you taste them you won't care what they look like!"
"1","4","I didn't have chocolate to dip them in, so these weren't really all that great for me. Good idea though, since you can make these if your cake crumbles when coming out of the pan."
"1","5","Great recipe, I just need to figure out how to dip into the chocolate better ! I was never any good at that. But the taste was incredible ! I used red velvet cake mix, cream cheese frosting, and 'tried' to dip into white chocolate. I was going to take this to a potluck, but they're very messy looking :P"
"1","5","Delicious! The recipe is very easy to make, but time consuming. It would make a great rainy day project. I used devil's food cake mix, and made my own cream cheese frosting (whipped together 8oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 1 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract). I also melted down a few oz. of Trader Joe's 72% bittersweet chocolate for the outside chocolate coating, instead of confectioners coating, and it was delicious. I melted the chocolate in the microwave, instead of a double boiler."
"1","2","This was a lot of work for the mixed results. I found these extremely sweet! Also, I followed some suggestions regarding freezing to help with the chocolate dipping process. That was a disaster. I only used 3/4 of the icing and this made the balls too mushy and soft. I don't know what went wrong or what I did. This only the second recipe of about 100 that did not work out. Very unhappy."
"1","4","I've made this recipe a few times now. The only difference is I use my left over cake pieces from when I level my cake and left over icing from decorating the cake too. My hubby and I really don't like them, but my sister, 6 yr old nephew, best friend, mom and step-dad all love them. So I will continue to use my extra pieces and make this recipe quite a bit!"
"1","5","Easy to make and they tast great. Husband a children loved them. I followed the recipe exactly and was happy with the results. Thank you for a great recipe."
"1","5","I thought these were great. A little time consuming, so I'm sure I wont be making them very often, but very tasty :)"
"1","5","These were excellent and they present beautifully! I used a variation on dipping chocolate and cakes/frostings, and they all turned out delicious. They do seem more similar to truffles than cake after all is said and done, but good nonetheless. I received numerous compliments on these."
"1","3","These were very easy to make, but not a yummy as I expected. With my extensive experience eating chocolate and sweets I had to rate them average. Especially when you consider that they are labor intensive. Sorry, just being honest!"
"1","5","I've made this with many different mixes and frostings, changed up dipping chocolates and chocolate toppings. It has never been bad. If you want a smoother texture for the balls put the finished cake and frosting in a mixer while the cake is warm. I also added some mint extract to a devil's food cake and it was good."
"1","1","Sorry. This recipe was not good. Neat idea though."
"1","4","Very good, but VERY time consuming. Also, make your balls truly bite size, better for the eating. And DON'T try to dip them in just regular melted chocolate (I ran out of the coating) That is a big mistake."
"1","5","These turned out great- everyone loved these. Some drizzles with contrasting chocolate, rolled in nuts or coconut"
"1","5","I got a lot of laughs anytime someone asked what these were. But everyone loved them, myself included. I didn't think they were as difficult as people have been making them out to be."
"1","3","These look very cute, but the taste is not good at all--way too artificial and sweet. I'm not sure why they're so popular, though they are quite simple to make and there are lots of ways to be creative with them. However, I won't make them again."
"1","5","this is a terrific recipe. wow what a winner."
"1","2","I really wanted to love this recipe, considering how many cute things you can make with it... but it was just not good to me. First off, the consistency of the cake is REALLY unappealing. My boyfriend said that it was the texture of a 'mini donut hole drenched in milk'... whatever that means, basically - very mushy (and I didn't even use the entire container of frosting). I used Wilton candy melts in chocolate and vanilla... afterwards, the taste was just TOO sweet. I love confections, but this was just too much. After eating one, I needed to drink an entire glass of water because it was too sweet. It's a good idea, and the pictures are so cute, but to me, baking is about taste, texture and balance. This fell short :("
"1","5","I did fudge cake fudge frosting and chocolate coating, topped some like the picture, some with chopped nuts and some with grated chocolate chips. They turned out great! So cute, just like the picture! Everyone at the party loved um! Im just glad I had my hubby helping me. It took a few hours even with help. Cute and yummy! But give yourself lots of time if you want them cute. I'm excited to try differnt combos!"
"1","3","They were easy to make once I got some help fropm people who made it before. I followed the directions and it was a mess. You need to pop these in the freezer for an hour or so before you dip them, or they will fall apart. Very tasty, but I doubt I will make them again."
"1","5","AMAZING!!! You have so many options with this recipe, it can never get old. The only change I made was to add only a 1/2 can of frosting. It seems to be plenty. Enjoy!"
"1","5","these things taste amazing, but I did have a hard time dipping them. They were soft, so I froze them and that helped a little, but I couldn't get them smooth the way I normally do"
"1","5","These were pretty easy & were really good! I made them for my husband's birthday instead of the usual cake that never gets completely eaten. They store great in the fridge & for once the whole birthday cake was eaten!"
"1","5","My family loved these cake balls. I rolled them with my hands that I dipped in a little water. That way they were very smooth and didn't stick to my hands. I also used candy melts to for different colors. Next time I am going to try to tint almond bark to see how they taste that way."
"1","5","What a great recipe!! These turned out great, look like they came from a bakery. Followed the suggestions of others; made the balls with my hands and put in the freezer before the chocolate coating. Thanks for sharing this."
"1","4","use 1 can frosting. freeze balls prior to dipping."
"1","5","These are AMAZING! My sister and I made them the other day because it sounded like fun- they were SO easy to make and not nearly as messy as I thought. We made white cake with strawberry frosting dipped in milk chocolate and white cake with banana frosting (we blended banana instant pudding into whipped frosting) dipped in milk chocolate. We are making the banana ones for Easter as well as cherry chip cake with cherry frosting dipped in dark chocolate and cheese cake filling with graham crackers crumbs dipped in dark chocolate. There are so many fun things you can do with this!"
"1","3","These were very pretty, and were not hard to make but the filling just didn't taste that good to me on its own... I thought it was a bit pasty. I think making traditional truffles would be quicker (no cake baking) and have more 'wow' effect."
"1","5","YUM! YUM! Can't wait to try more combos."
"1","5","i love cake balls and so does everyone else! i let the cake completely cool before crumbling and adding the frosting. i used my cookie scoop to make them into balls. i put the balls into the frig for a couple of hours and then coated them. they are so yummy!"
"1","5","Took these to work and everyone loved them."
"1","4","I loved this recipe - though I will say that I followed some of the other reviewer comments to begin with, like refrigerating the cake-icing mixture and freezing the balls before dipping them. Also, I can't imagine why you would need all 16 oz of icing - I used less than 12 and even that was quite a lot for the amount of cake."
"1","5","So addictive! Very easy to make, it just takes time to cool off the mix and form the balls. I used yellow cake and chocolate buttercream frosting (one of my favorite cakes). After I combined those I put the bowl in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes. Then I wet my hands and started making balls like I was making meatballs. I froze the cake balls for an hour and a half. When I rolled them in the chocolate almond bark they hardened up very quickly. Tasty!"
"1","5","Awesome!! As others have said, be sure you chill the cake/icing mixture, roll them out chilled and CHILL AGAIN!! It makes the dipping in chocolate step so much easier! I melted Andes mint chocolates, used chocolate cake and creme cheese icing, and they were amazing!!! The mixture made around 50, and they were gone within 20 min! What a wonderful recipie, thanks so much!"
"1","2","Bummer... I was excited about this recepie as a food item for church... I tried lemon cake & frosting... much much too sweet and squishy, and I didn't add all the frosting."
"1","4","I made these into cake lollipops 'cake pops' and they were a HUGE HIT!!! I'm not quite sure how much I like the taste but everyone else sure loved them. I'll be making these again for sure, they totally WOW people!"
"1","5","I absolutely love these and have made them several times. There are endless possibilities. I always use half a container of icing though. The entire container is way too much. I also put the balls in the freezer for a little while before dipping. This makes them much easier to handle. I first saw these on the Bakerella website. She does all sorts of things with these and has different designs for every holiday."
"1","4","Since these recipe makes so many cake balls and you will probably want to try lots of different combinations, you might want to make cupcakes instead of a regular cake. That way you can use however many cupcakes that you want to get the number of each flavor you want then frost the rest of the cupcakes and share them with the kids. Another tip is to melt the chocolate in a slow cooker (crock pot), it might help by keeping the chocolate warm enough that it's not effect by the cake balls being so cold. I wasn't that impressed with these cake balls because I thought they would be different although I don't know how I thought they would be different. I used an entire thing of frosting maybe that's what I should change. Anyway, I will try them again with the tips and see if they go over any better. They are worth trying just remember the tips shared here and be ready to look a little silly in the baking section of the store while you stand there and try to think of what combination of cake flavor and frosting flavor would be good."
"1","5","Although time consuming, these are very good! I followed the suggestions of the top reviewer with the exception of the toothpicks (which didn't work out so well). Making the balls that way is an all day project. Using a hand mixer on low for about 20-30 seconds definitely helps mixing the cake and frosting. The only problem I had was my melted chocolate bark not staying smooth long enough to coat all 56 balls. I tried adding a few squares at a time and managed to get 40 done. I also ended up using 9 of 12 squares of bark. The recipe calls for 3 oz, which would cover like 5 balls. I also used devil's food cake mix and whipped buttercream frosting - delicious!!"
"1","4","The cake came out a little mushier than i imagined. I only used half of the can of frosting. I had a couple work friends try them and they enjoyed them. This is a very unique recipe. I will make them again."
"1","5","These are awesome! You do need to chill the cake/frosting mixture before rolling it into balls. And freeze the balls before dipping - MUCH easier! You can decorate them any way you like afterwards - as Easter eggs, Christmas ornaments (or even trees if you make them into cones instead of balls!), happy faces, whatever. I love the versatility and simplicity of this recipe."
"1","5","I used just short of a whole tub of frosting and had no problems with it being too gooey. Don't put the frosting in while the cake is still warm. Make sure to cool completely. I froze the balls for a few hours before dipping. Overall, easy to make and tastes great."
"1","5","These were tasty. My kids loved them. I will be making these again. I only needed to use half of the frosting. I also let the cake cool completely (I got side tracked) before crumbling. I didn't have any problems mixing. I took someones suggestion and froze the balls before dipping. Very cute. My kids can't wait to make these again!"
"1","4","I made this today. They were good, they looked fantastic. But were really sweet. I probably wouldnt make them again."
"1","5","I make this recipe very frequently and it's the easiest and most delicious way to impress anyone! My favorite combination is Devils food with Cream cheese frosting, covered in chocolate Almond Bark. Also Red Velvet and cream cheese is delicious. Its like a mini-cake that completely melts in your mouth. Had to stop at 1."
"1","5","After reading through several dozen reviews I decided to follow 'AnaAH''s recommendations. I used a Red Velvet cake mix and crumbled it while it was still fairly warm. I didn't bother with microwaving the frosting, but I definitely used the 'Whipped' variety. I think this was important. Absolutely key to a successful outcome is the refrigeration and freezing times. They turned out beautiful and delicious. A hit and well worth the effort. Thanks to the orginal submitter and to the suggestions of those who blazed the trail."
"1","5","This was so good. When I brought this to a meeting, all I could hear were the 'ooh' and 'ahhs'. You will definitely get people wanting to know what is in it. It is a sweet surprise. Women will love and hate you at the same time. Love for the deliciousness and hate for extra love handles that comes with consuming these!"
"1","5","excellent. Very Important Tip: Refrigerate Balls for a bit so that when you dip in chocolate they don't fall apart.I made the balls larger and rolled them with my hands. I also added sprinkles to some for a festive touch for the kids. I used strawberry cake supreme with white vanilla icing. Grrrrrrreat! Its a keeper!"
"1","4","Ok, so I made this with lemon cake/lemon creme icing/vanilla almond bark, and also strawberry cake/cream cheese icing/chocolate almond bark. I did have to freeze the balls for a couple of hours before I dipped them, but that made it much easier and coating hardened faster. I did not care for the almond bark in either chocolate or vanilla, and will avoid it at all costs from now on. The cake balls themselves were great, and I will definately make them again using real chocolate coating instead of almond bark. Great easy recipe!"
"1","5","I substituted strawberry cakemix and half a can of strawberry icing with 8ounces of cream cheese. Dipped them in chocolate and they were delish...also made the original recepie it was yummy too. Everyone loves these."
"1","5","I made these for Christmas and they disappeared. Everyone kept asking how I made them. I used chocolate cake w/ chocolate icing. I dipped them in chocolate almond bark and drizzled them with white chocolate. I did put it in the fridge after I mixed the cake and icing and left it in there over night. The next day I made them into balls and put them in the freezer overnight. Once frozen they were easy to dip. The recipe was very easy as long as you took the time to refridgerate and freeze in between steps."
"1","4","People love these cake balls! They are very easy. The first time I made them I baked a cake and mixed them with homemade frosting and then dipped them in chocolate. The next time I used leftover cake: I took the frosting off the top, microwaved it until it was warm, and mixed it with the cake in a mixing bowl with a mixer. I also dipped these in chocolate. This is a neat way to use up left over cake."
"1","4","I must say I was a bit disappointed--there are just so many reviews on here with different suggestions that I didn't really know what to use. I did decide to use half of the frosting it called for and used strawberry cake with 1/2 can of cream cheese frosting then covering with white chocolate--but I thought it was just ok. I am going to try these again because the reviews for these cake balls puzzles me-so maybe it was something I did. I do plan to use the strawberry cake with a WHOLE can of cream cheese frosting and coat with white--maybe next year and see what happens--I will not give up on them. My guests thought they were good--but they were not raving about them."
"1","5","I received a lot of compliments on these. Especially when guests found out that they were homemade and not store bought."
"1","4","If you like donuts then you will like these, I wasn't much for the consistency of them or maybe I am still bitter that the cake I used to make these balls with was the most perfect cake I ever made and I managed to get the whole thing out of the pan with the whole thing staying perfectly together lol. We dipped them in gnocchi which worked really well and was delicious. These made at least 80 for us as well."
"1","3","I made the red velvet/cream cheese frosting version of these with white confectioner's coating... not really that good to me, but I did get compliments, and the presentation is good for Christmas time."
"1","5","Holy Moly. I couldn't keep these long enough to share them at xmas. I ended having to make more because my husband kept eating them and my visitors kept hearing about them from him and asking for samples. Tried a couple of different combination. The red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in chocolate were the big hit! I cooled my cake and frosting mixture in the fridge overnight before making the balls. Then I place the balls on a sheet in the freezer before dipping them in the chocolate. It helped them stay on the toothpick during the dipping. Since the dipping chocolate is warm, the cake balls need to be as cold as possible when you are dipping them to stay on the toothpick. Also, I used alternate colored chocolate (white chocolate w/ food coloring) to make drizzles on the tops of each different batch. It helped in telling people which cake ball favors were on the tray before just biting into something unknown!"
"1","5","These are delicious. I did triple chocolate cake with chocolate fudge icing. I got RAVE reviews at the cookie exchange I took them to. My family loved them too."
"1","5","Everyone loved these! The best part was no one knew how easy they were! I tried a yellow cake mix with chocolate fudge icing and an chocolate almond bark coating. It was excellent."
"1","5","Seriously addictive!"
"1","3","I wish I could say I thought this was the best, but I didn't. I found it to be very mushy inside, and I must have done something wrong with the chocolate because I didn't have enough to cover all of the balls. I ended up doing a 'drizzle' design on a lot of them. I also thought they came out very sweet. Too sweet. I guess that from the very good reviews this recipe had; I expected something more. It never hurts to try a new recipe though!"
"1","4","I loved the fact you can make these ahead of time and freeze and that you can decorate them different so it makes a lovely display. Was a little time consuming baking the cake freezing the balls etc... and for the chocolate covering i just used chocolate chips/vanilla chips/butterscotch chips the kind you use for cookies and added approx. one tsp of shortening for every cup of chips i was melting ( placed about a cup of chips in small glass bowl melted then placed that bowl over another bowl that was filled with a couple cups of water that i had brought to a boil ..the fist bowl sat inside the water bowl but the waterbowl lip kept the chocolate bowl from going all the way down ..this helped keep the chips melted for longer period of time as i dipped the balls ) Was not a hit at my party but was not a miss. Would make again for the potential impact they can have in display and the make ahead value for a dessert. favorite flavor seemed to be strawberry cake with strawberry icing dipped in semi sweet chocolate chips I think next time i would add some of those flavored creamers ...example strawberry cake/icing with a couple amaretto creamers then dip in chocolate"
"1","5","Okay first of all I don't know who gets 36 out of these, I got like 80. And they were plenty big enough. I made them with chocolate cake mix and vanilla whipped icing. First, I cooked my cake mix and crumbled it up and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour. Then I mixed in the icing I believe it was a 12 oz can. Let that sit in the fridge overnight, the next morning I made them into balls and let them sit in the freezer for an hour. When I went to put the almond bark on them I only got out a few at a time because if you get to many out at a time they tend to start coming apart in the chocolate. After I finished all of them I left them in the fridge until ready to serve. Everyone really liked them I made them over Christmas and they went pretty fast. Will be making them again especially at Christmas and I didn't really think they were hard to make at all just some long steps but that gives you time to work on something else while you wait."
"1","5","Delicious!! I took others advice and let the cake cool before mixing with frosting. I just used a spoon (not a melon baller) to dish out my cake for forming into balls. I used a big thin three tined meat fork to dip the balls in the chocolate and a small straight metal spatula to put them on wax paper. I tried lemon cake w/lemon icing (white chocolate coating), red velvet cake with cream cheese icing (dark chocolate coating), fudge cake with chocolate icing (mint choco coating) and fudge cake with chocolate icing (dark choco coating). Nuts and red/green sprinkles help denote what kind of flavor each truffle is and gives a nice crunch when biting into. My husband thought these were best when served refrigerated. I froze the ones we didn't give away so we could munch on them all year long."
"1","5","I was concerned about making these after reading some of the negative reviews, but I'm really glad I did. I made them for Christmas to have more variety and I used all chocolate ingredients. They were gone before Christmas. I did not find them difficult to make at all. I baked the cake and scooped it into a bowl while it was still warm. I stirred it with a spoon to crumble it and then added the icing while it was still warm. I didn't use all the icing, maybe a little over half the can. I put it in the refridgerator for a few hours and then rolled them and dipped them. They were disappearing from the plate as fast as I was putting them on it. I will definitely make these again and experiment with other flavor combinations."
"1","5","Ok, this is my first review and I have to say they were delicious. I made strawberry cake with vanilla frosting coated in Baker's semi-sweet chocolate, sprinkled with some non-perils. I took a lot of the other reviewers advice and only used about a 1/2 can of the frosting. They definately did not take me 7 hours. My cake was NOT completely cooled when I crumbled, it was still a little warm and I put the balls in the fridge for about an hour. It did take more than 1 box of the Baker's chocolate so I had to raid the pantry for a 1/2 bag of chips mixed with a tiny bit of shortening. I used two forks for my chocolate dipping and had no problems. My first taste I thought they were just okay and was thinking maybe to much work to ever make again...and then I had the second taste, and third and now I am hiding the rest in the back of the fridge from my family."
"1","5","I loved these!!! I made 2 batches. One with vanilla cake mix mixed with only diet orange pop, so that the cake tastes like a healthier creamsicle. I dipped these into milk chocolate. I then made a batch of brownies, scooped around the edges to the soft brownie, and mixed it with cream cheese frosting and dipped into white chocolate. I couldn't keep my family from eating these!!!"
"1","2","eeeks, I was really excited to try this recipe b/c of all of the great reviews. I didn't think there was anything special about these at all. They were barely average taking into consideration the time it took for these.  There is a similar recipe using cream cheese and oreos which is so much better than these.  I used red velvet cake w/cream cheese frosting and white chocolate."
"1","5","My kids enjoyed making these at Christmas. We rolled in Coconut, Nuts, Powdered Sugar, Cocoa, Sprinkles. Not to mention how good they were."
"1","4","What a cool idea and unique idea. The good parts: Lots of rooms for variations, creativity and individuality. The not so good parts: Hard to control the finished size...Once you roll it around in the melted chocolate, the thing gets to be about as big as a golf ball! I gave them as gifts boxed up real nicely with colored tissue in cute little candy boxes. Mt concern was not being real confident about what the center cake part consisentency would be if not eaten right away. I did not get any complaints so I guess (hope) everyone enjoyed them. I suggest using the chocolate wafer things you get in a craft store and adding just a little canola oil to thin out the chocolate which gives yo a few more seconds to get the things covered before the chocolate hardens. I found if I placed the cake ball on a wide tonged fork (bbq fork?) and then lowered it into the chocolate that this allowed for the most chocolate coverage and for the chocolate to drain off. Good Luck!"
"1","5","Fantastic! I can't wait to try other flavors. Wasn't hard to make."
"1","4","Not sure if using the german chocolate cake set up messed up the cake balls.It did not turn out for me.Next time I will use a traditional vanilla or chocolate icing.They tasted good,but very difficult to work with."
"1","2","Loved the idea, hated the result. I think the texture is what I like least. It's like pre-chewed up cake. The dipping didn't work after freezing the cake balls for an hour, nor did it work after freezing overnight. Maybe I needed better quality dipping chocolate. Even so, the cake balls themselves just aren't my cup of tea."
"1","3","Not worth the work."
"1","3","I didn't think I would ever say this, but I think it was just too much chocolate. I might try different flavors - I haven't decided yet. But I won't make the chocolate on chocolate on chocolate again."
"1","4","We love these cake balls (we call them Frosty droppings since I coat them in white chocolate). They are a bit time consuming and difficult to dip in white chocolate (we do not like candy coating bark so I use real chocolates) but they are worth it if you have the time. We usually make red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting, and dip in white chocolate. I also found that even though dipping in white chocolate is universally difficult, Ghiridelli (sp?) seems to work the best for me. It is also much 'whiter' than Hershey's. I would have given five stars if my review was purely based on taste but I took into consideration the time it takes to make them."
"1","5","These were awesome! I used a supreme lemon cake mix with lemon frosting and a white chocolate coating. After dipping the balls into the chocolate i rolled them in coconut. Everyone loved these little suckers and i will be making them all the time."
"1","4","Made these today and they are ok,but if you would like something that is awsome--try the cookie balls that are in here they are 6-7 stars."
"1","4","This is a great recipe!! It is much more easier to do than I thought. I have 2 suggestions 1. Make this recipe with a nice flavored cake mix, whether it be lemon cake and lemon frosting or red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting. 2. The easiest way to form these cake bites are to make sure that you refrigerate the mixture before forming the balls. It makes it much much easier to form ."
"1","5","Absolutely amazing! Entire family loved it. Be warned: very addicting. I read almost every single comment before making these and some were true, some were not. 1. Cooling the cake for 30 minutes is entirely too long. It still needs to be quite warm to the touch before mashing or it will not hold together to form balls. Cool about 10-15 minutes. 2. If making the german chocolate/coconut pecan mix, it's okay and necessary to use the entire can of coconut pecan icing. 3. Refrigerate the cake/icing mixture at least 2 hrs. 3. FREEZE THE BALLS OVERNIGHT after shaping them! This will keep them from falling apart when dipping into hot chocolate. 4. I couldn't find any of the almond bark or chocolate mentioned at Marsh, so used Baker's dipping chocolate in the microwavable container. Worked like a charm! 5. Chocolate dries very quickly on balls. Have toppings ready. I used pecan pieces, shredded coconut and sprinkles."
"1","5","Very good. I used Yellow cake mix, milk chocolate frosting and dipped them in real white chocolate. Everyone loved them!"
"1","4","These were delicious, but difficult to dip. I had a very hard time trying to dip them in the chocolate. I made Red Velvet cake & did the cream cheese frosting, then dipped them in white chocolate. They taste wonderful, but they really don't look very pretty. I don't know what I did wrong, but I was disappointed the way they turned out."
"1","2","Mine completely flopped. I had read reviews and refrigerated the cake/frosting mix before making the balls, then froze the balls before dipping them. The first two turned out ok, but the rest started crumbling and the melted chocolate turned into a thick mixture of cake crumbles and chocolate. We gave up, but the remains sure were yummy. Maybe using less frosting is the key."
"1","4","I made these and they were difficult to make. They do taste good. I had a hard time with melting chocolate. I tried using white chcolate chips and had to throw it out because it tasted like wax. So then I tried chocolate chips and could not get them melted right, threw that out. I used Candiquick and to my suprise they did NOT taste like was and it was way better to melt. I searched high and low for BARK and can't find any. It would be nice if someone named what brand or where they sell this stuff. I metled the candiquick over a stove but I had an idea. If I had a fondue kit it would be some much easier to dip them in. Mine did not come out that pretty like these other pics but they were edible. Takes practice."
"1","5","My family loved these! AFter reading the reviews, I waited until the cake was cool, crumbled it and added the frosting. I froze the balls after baking and then dipped. Turned out beautiful. I made a peppermint cake, added fudge frosting. Dipped in both white and dark chocolate. Very well received by all."
"1","5","These are spectacular. I made chocolate cake/pecan coconut frosting dipped in melted semi-sweet chips and carrot cake/cream cheese frosting/about 1/2 cup golden raisins dipped in melted white chocolate chips. For both kinds I used probably 3/4 can of the frosting, shaped the balls and chilled them in the refridge for a few hours before dipping. They look beautiful and taste even better. I actually had to hide them because my husband kept eating them! I will def. be making these again."
"1","2","This recipe sounded so easy and yummy, but I have to say they did not come out at all the way they were suppose to.  Very disappointed..."
"1","5","I didn't know what to expect when I made these! There seems to be very strong reviews for both sides. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I LOVE these! I used strawberry cake mix and not quite a whole tub of cream cheese frosting. Then I used both chocolate almond bark and white. They are both so yummy!"
"1","4","OK so I have made these twice now. First time, a mooshey, goowey mess. I did it per instructions and used golden butter cake mix with cream cheese frosting. I dipped that in choc. bark-yuck. Second time, after reading all reviews, I used devil's food cake, 1/2 the frosting (plain white). The texture was so much more cake-like. I think the spongyness of the devil's food cake works good with this recipie. I found the dough much easier to roll, and froze the balls for an hour. I didn't want to bother melting and dipping in bark so i melted 1/2 bag white choc. chips and drizzled. They looked really nice, like the photos on here and were much better."
"1","3","Even though these tasted pretty good, they were a pain to make since the cake and frosting mixture left crumbs in the chocolate dip making it more and more difficult to complete. I couldn't finish dipping since the almond bark got too hard to dip. No amount of heating would take care of this problem."
"1","3","They were a hit and tasted great. But they were a pain to make. I most definitely recommend chilling the mix and freezing the balls before dipping them. The dipping was the hardest part."
"1","5","These are great. I made these for a family xmas party and everyone just loved them. I read the reviews and they were not hard . I did cool the cake and add the frosting.Then put it in the frig till I could make balls with it and froze them. They are not hard at all. I even had the white stripes on them. I used semi sweet choc chips for the coating. Just wonderful. I will make them again."
"1","5","So delicious! I used dark chocolate mixed with a little bit of canola oil for shine. Here is a helpful hint, spray your hands with cooking spray prior to rolling the frozen mixture in order for the cake not to stick."
"1","4","I was in the middle of a 'red velvet cake' crisis when I stumbled upon this awesome recipe! WOW! It sure saved me--expecially my piece of mind. I couldn't just toss everything...too much time and money invested! Thanks for this outstanding alternative! YAHOO! :-)"
"1","5","After reading the reviews, I decided to go with the reviewer who suggested cooling the cake before mixing with icing, refrigerating overnight, making the balls, freezing for an hour or more and then dipping them. I purchased the Wilton candy dipping set, and I highly recommend it. I made a homemade red velvet cake and homemade cream cheese icing with white chocolate bark (and I could not find a high quality bark). These were incredibly rich and so very good. I suggest making smaller balls, the walnut sized balls were so rich it was hard to finish more than one (but somehow one was just not enough). Super for gift giving season and I am sure I will be making these throughout the year for get-togethers using different combinations. Fabulous recipe and such a simple concept. The addition of the little white paper cups adds class and makes these little sweet bites look and feel like a million dollars."
"1","5","well I attempted these w/o reading any of the reviews (something I've never done before) and thought it can't be that hard. It was very messy, and by the time I was finished I vowed to never make them again. However, EVERYONE loved them and requested them for our next Christmas get together on Tues. I came back and read the reviews just now and see where I went wrong. I def. recommend following the advice of some of the other reviews. I can't wait to try a different variation of these as I used triple choc. chip cake mix with the triple choc chip icing (1/2 would have sufficed) very very rich. I am giving it 5 stars bc I did not read the reviews before making."
"1","4","They were quite good. Everyone who ate it liked it. However, one definitely doesn't need to add a whole container of frosting. Half a container does the job well. I also concur with the freezing for one hour or so. I didn't use the chocolate bark that the recipe suggested, but Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips. They were quite moist and sweet. I would use the recipe again."
"1","4","very delicious but very frustrating to make. wait for the cake to cool a little before adding to room temp frosting. Freezing helps the balls hold their shape, otherwise the balls are too mushy to form a perfect round ball with your hands. Use a sheet of wax paper and place a nickel-sized drop of the coating and then place the ball on top then drip one tablespoon of coating and let gravity do the rest. it is a much less frustrating time than trying to toothpick and dunk and then try and cover the toothpick hole mess up. besides if you make a contrasting cake and coating colors the drips coming down look very beautiful."
"1","5","Wow. What a great easy recipe. I have no luck with candy, I think I just don't have the patience. But this was no fail. Unlike others I used all of the frosting, but I did freeze them after I rolled them before I dipped them. This uses way more candy coating than the recipe called for. lots of room to get creative and they look beautiful in my cookie baskets. No more work or mess than cookies!"
"1","5","Addictive is the right word for these! Used chocolate cake and chocolate frosting. Wore plastic gloves and used my hands to mix warm cake with frosting to get things mixed real well. Didn't need chilling, just used small cookie scoop to shape balls. Froze balls before dipping---shouldn't have, it made the chocolate set too quickly when dipping. Will just chill at this point next time. Also, used alot more dipping chocolate than called for. Made 47 balls and used a 12 oz bag of white candy coating and a 15 oz bag of milk chocolate disks so I ended up with white and brown treats. UPDATE 5/5/11: Still Addictive! This time allowed chocolate cake to cool for an hour, mixed in 3/4 can white frosting, then chilled. Formed balls and put in lollipop sticks, then froze. Used about a pound or so of the chocolate candy making discs. Melted chocolate in glass bowls set in warm water in big skillet on low burner, so could add more as needed. Also added a little bit of canola oil to chocolate to thin it out so it wouldn't be so thick and clumpy. Made 50 balls and was MUCH easier this time and looked much prettier too!"
"1","5","Whoa - these are awesome! Try putting crushed oreos in the crumbled cake/icing mixture. Super moist! I may try putting some chopped up marachino cherries in next time!"
"1","5","I'm giving a 5* rating based on chocolate cake mixed with chocolate frosting and then dipped in chocolate/peanut butter. OHHHH MYYYYY GOSSSHHH !!! They are delicious. Very time consuming, but so good. I also tried strawberry cake mixed with cream cheese frosting and then dipped in white chocolate and some dipped in semi sweet Ghiradelli chocolate. Those dipped in the Ghiradelli chocolate taste like chocolate covered strawberries. (A little too much strawberry taste for me, but that's just my taste.) Make sure to freeze the cake mixture first and the dough will be easy to work with. Thank you very much fro sharing this recipe. I'll make them again, I'm sure. Merry Christmas!"
"1","5","If there were ten stars, I'd choose that option! These are absolutely amazing and I'll be making them again and again!"
"1","5","Thank you for sharing this recipe. It would seem that Idaho has been out of the loop on this dessert. 'First time anybody in my fam has encountered cake balls. My first batch went to my son's AWANA Happy B'Day Jesus party and not a single ball made it back alive. Even my dessert-wary husband loves them. I'll be taking another batch, made with Nutella instead of canned frosting, to my MIL's for Christmas. Thanks so much."
"1","1","I seriously thought these would be good since it got such outstanding reviews. Boy was I wrong! The inside was mushy."
"1","5","What a different treat. Spoiled the fiance though. Liked white cake with choc chips, choc icing and choc coating. The best was choc cake, choc icing, insert marachino cherry and choc coating."
"1","3","DO NOT MAKE THIS AS IT CALLS FOR. Follow one of the reviews that has a lot of stars. Reason I only gave it 3 stars is I didn't bother to read the reviews, so I didn't do all the chilling of the cake/frosting and had lumpy goo to contend with. Also, she estimates way too little traditional chocolate. I would plan on using a whole bag of chocolate chips if you don't like almond bark like me :) My husband likes these things, I don't think they are worth the effort and time for using a cake mix and frosting."
"1","4","These are a really wonderful treat. They are very easy to make but the dipping process of course is time consuming. I made carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and dipped them in a 50-50 mixture of white chocolate and white almond bark. They are so moist and have so much flavor, way beyond what you'd expect of a box cake. Tonight I am going to make german chocolate with coconut pecan frosting and dip them in 50-50 melted Hershey's bars and chocolate almond bark. I use the mix of chocolates and almond bark because I like the flavor of the chocolate but the almond bark gives it a glossier appearance and makes evenly coating them easier. I can't imagine when I would ever go through the process to make these beyond the holidays but they are certianly a tasty treat to enjoy or to add to a holiday basket."
"1","3","I have no idea what I am doing wrong, but these were all mushy on the inside and barely edible. I used a yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting and 1/2 of the frosting per other reviews so that could totally be it?! They looked beautiful, I spent so much time with the icing and decorating and it was all a waste. Giving it 3 stars because I know there are probably much better combinations of cake/frosting that I might try next time."
"1","5","i rated this 5 for taste, but it was very difficult to dip the cake balls. that was the hardest part for me, but i made them for a family get together last weekend, and they all insisted that i bring them to christmas, so ill see if it will be easier this time. but i used strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting, and dipped somein white chocolate and some in milk chocolate and some in coconut also."
"1","5","Easy & Yummy! I made 3 varieties for a cookie exchange at work. Chocolate Mint (chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, and Andes mint chips) coated in chocolate almond bark; Red Velvet (red velvet cake, white frosting) coated in powdered sugar and topped with vanilla almond bark; Chocolate Chocolate (chocolate cake, chocolate frosting) coated with chocolate almond bark. TIPS: While it was easier to work with the cake balls when they were frozen (coating them) I found that when they started to thaw inside of the coating, they started to seep a little moisture. I just left them alone and they dried fine. I had no problem using an entire tub of frosting, but can see where the cake balls would be more cake-like if you used less...they were a hit, especially with the Andes mints!"
"1","5","Love, love, love this! The combinations are endless which makes it alot of fun. I combined gingerbread cake mix with cream cheese and then triple chocolate with choc. cream cheese frosting. Both were a big hit at a holiday candy exchange. I did freeze them overnight and dipped the gingerbread in white chocoate. I dipped to cover 3/4 of the ball, refroze, and then dipped to cover the rest. They looked and tasted great! I will make this every Christmas!"
"1","5","the easiest and best thing EVER!!! i didn't have a lot of white chocolate so i just drizzle it over the cake and they were beautiful and delicious."
"1","4","I'd give these 5 stars in taste--very decadent treats. But I'ving 4 stars because they were a pain to make. I froze my cake/frosting mixture and it was still a mess to work with. For some reason I used 20 oz. of almond bark, even after I started making the balls bigger. Not sure if I'll make it again. Maybe if I figure out what I was doing wrong with the coating."
"1","5","yummy! i did german chocolate cake with coconut pecan frosting i did use the whole can so as to be sure all cake was moist to mix well.( doing while still warm is a must) to hold together well. i then froze them for 20 min. then dipped them. I used tooth picks and fork -did some in chocolate dip and some in white dip. the chocolate dip was better as my bowl fit in the simmering water pan better and that kept it melted i microwaved it first then in pan of water to dip. The party is Sun. so I'll update and let you know how they went!"
"1","5","I just made these tonight and they were a lot of fun! They don't look as pretty as the ones in the picture, but yummy just the same! I used Duncan Hines devil's food cake and Betty Crocker Whipped chocolate frosting. I let the cake cool for about 15-20 minutes and then mixed it with the icing. I tried the cookie scoop to shape the balls, but it's a lot easier to use your hands. After cooling in the fridge for around 30 minutes they were ready for dipping! I used milk chocolate chips (it took two bags) and decorated them with sprinkles and Heath Bar bits. They're not a quick recipe to make, but if you enjoy being creative they're the perfect recipe!"
"1","5","I made these last night for Bunco night, and everyone was really impressed and asking for the recipe. They turned out awesome; they taste like something Hostess would make! I used a chocolate cake mix, vanilla frosting (the Christmas kind that comes with the sprinkles), and white coating. While the coating was still wet, I topped them with the sprinkles and they turned out so pretty and festive. Next time, I'm going to make them into shapes and decorate them. You could get really creative with this recipe! One thing I highly recommend is keeping most of your cake mixture in the freezer and working with only a small amount of it at a time. It starts getting too warm and comes apart in the coating if the balls aren't cold enough."
"1","4","I used a red velvet mix with cream cheese. It was a lot of work to bake a cake, then patiently wait for the cake/frosting to chill, then roll into balls...I think the white almond bark just gave it a bad flavor. I'm going to try using less frosting next time and a better dipping chocolate.  NEW RATING- I had to try this recipe again. I used Red Velvet cake. If you like a more cake like texture use LESS frosting, I used only half a can and let it chill in the freezer until it gets kinda firm, then put on a wooden kabob stick and dip in melted white chocolate chips! Doing it this way made them perfect to me :)"
"1","3","I made this and the taste was pretty good but after they set in the fridge overnight they still weren't 'set.' When I went to pick them up to eat them the fell apart in my hand. Not sure why they didn't set properly..."
"1","3","I followed almost all of Lexi's advice - which was very helpful - the cooling periods, the toothpicks, the alternate chocolate idea but we were still only so-so on the result. The kids liked them but the adults passed after one. I was optimistic after seeing all the positive reviews but I still have half a tray leftover and uneaten. Thanks anyways!"
"1","3","I was intrigued by the recipe, but we were not pleased with the end result. My downfall was probably using the waxy dipping chocolate they sell in grocery stores. That stuff should not be used for food you're going to eat! I did end up with some edible ones that I just rolled in powdered sugar. They tasted like chocolate doughnuts!"
"1","2","I did not like the texture of these. I love cake and icing, but when mixed together, they are mushy and unappealing. The taste was okay."
"1","4","You just have to try it, but it was messy and yet very edible---it was devoured quickly by visiting grandchildren and adults. will try again with other flavors."
"1","3","We used white cake with white icing and dipped in white almond bark. They are time consuming, not my favorite, but my coworkers loved them."
"1","4","yummy!"
"1","5","This recipe is very easy but it does take a while to do. It takes a while to dip all the balls, etc... but it is worth it. Everybody loves these. Be creative and use different flavors!"
"1","5","Yum! Make sure the cake mixture is cool before dipping it into the chocolate."
"1","4","My balls turned out good! However to make 36-40 balls it took about 16 oz of chocolate instead of the 3 oz the recipe specified."
"1","5","I took these to a party at a friend's house. I used white cake and creamcheese frosting and chocolate almond bark. They were gone in a few minutes. The guys really loved them. I made the cakeballs 3 days before the party and froze them.Before I coated them, I put a toothpick into each ball. This made them a lot easier to dip. You can remove the toothpick and cover the little hole with additional almond bark of a different color. Use a fork to drizzle the bark-makes them look very pretty."
"1","1","Will not make again, didn't even finish coating the balls."
"1","4","I used chocolate cake with butter cream icing dipped in milk chocolate and then drizzled with white chocolate. Very chocolaty, but Delicious!"
"1","5","very good but very time consuming"
"1","5","These were very good and very easy. I used a German Chocolate cake with the pecan coconut icing with milk chocolate on the outside. Because I froze the balls before dipping, it was super easy! I will make these again, trying new combinations. I'm thinking orange with chocolate."
"1","5","We did chocolate cake with white icing and semi sweet chocolate chips to dip them. WOW!!! All the way through the recipe I kept thinking they were going to be awful - they looked awful until done."
"1","4","I had to make dessert for 60-70 people at a shower and knew I would be pressed for time. I made these Cake Balls a week before and froze them (with coating and all). I took them out of the freezer 2 hours before the shower and they were fantastic! I made the recipe exactly as stated and then a carrot cake with cream cheese icing. I added toasted pecans to the icing/cake mixture and the texture on them were phenomenal. Very nice to make ahead! 4 stars because they still took a long time to make, and were very rich. You couldn't eat more than 1 (maybe two). I might would make them more bite size next time as well as the cake gets on your teeth when you eat them. They were ALL EATEN! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","3","I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. I followed other reviews and allowed the cake to cool before I mixed in the frosting, and also cooled the cake balls before I coated them with chocolate, but I still found the inside too gooey for my liking. The flavor was good, but I think if I were to make them again I would only use about half the frosting for the inside."
"1","4","These are very good. I made these with the Betty Crocker chocolate fudge cake mix and the cream cheese frosting recipe from off this website dipped in white chocolate. I was having a cupcake themed birthday party so I found this idea on a website (http://bakerella.blogspot.com/2008/01/chocolate-cupcake-lollipops.html) and shaped them into baby sized cupcakes instead of balls and dipped the tops of them with white chocolate and sprinkles and m and m's for the cherry...then I put them on the ends of a sucker stick, so then they looked like suckers."
"1","2","Sorry to say good taste, but awful texture very wet and mushy. I will not be making these again."
"1","2","Months ago, my teenage daughter raved about 'cake balls' she had at a friends house. She explained them to me...but I just couldn't seem to grasp the concept. Lo and behold, I stumbled upon this recipe. I made lemon cake/cream cheese frosting, dipped in white chocolate. Review: too time consuming, toooo sweet. Great idea, but it just didn't work for me. I won't make them again.....but my daughter liked them."
"1","4","NEXT DAY UPDATE: When I originally reviewed this recipe I gave it 2 stars but after being told by over 30 people that they are amazing I have to bump it up to four. I still think they are a pain to make but I will actually try it again using some one of the suggestions of taking it in steps that may take a day or more. So sorry for the original super negative review. ORIGINAL:It's 2am and I just finished a large batch of 'cake balls'. It took me four hours and a huge mess to make something that doesn't taste that great. They look nice and even with the chocolate hardened they just taste like processed, mushy cake with nice chocolate on them. They looked so amazing in the many pictures submitted that I had to try them. Sigh. Very sad...wanted an amazing 'truffle' sort of dessert."
"1","5","The hardest part was covering them with almond bark. I froze them overnight, thinned my bark with just a LITTLE vegetable oil, and drizzled it over top. Once the coating had set up, I set the bottoms down in a puddle of bark to coat them underneath. I made these for a baby shower, and everyone wanted the recipe."
"1","4","I'm going to be fair and say I'm not a huge fan of cake balls, but I'm glad I gave it a chance anyway! I mixed 1c. mini marshmallows and a few chocolate chips into my warm cake and that was enough to make it all stick together rather than having to use storebought icing (I know it's bad for you, and for some reason something makes me think marshmallows are better than icing for your health). Dipped my balls in almond bark and wish I would've dipped them instead in white chocolate. Just a weird sort of mix."
"1","5","gosh these are amazing! i 'double dipped' them in chocolate so after they were frozen i dipped them again! it tasted amazing!"
"1","4","These taste amazing. Definitely plan on a lot of waiting. It is a drawn out process but utilizing the fridge/freezer makes these so so much easier. If you have trouble finding the almond bark, micheal's or a craft store should have it. I used 'Melts.' I will definitely make them again."
"1","5","These were wonderful and are a great use for leftover cake! I had about 1/2 of a homemade frosted cake that was leftover in the freezer, so all I did was place the cake in a bowl, mix it up, roll into balls, freeze, and then dip into chocolate bar that I had melted. Absolutely divine!"
"1","3","Ok. I was disappointed!I read the reviews and was very excited to try this out. I think what went wrong was that I was expecting something different. I did not like the 'mushy' texture. Personal preferance. I used a swiss chocolate cake and buttercream frosting dipping them in white chocolate. A friend of mine loved the few I made, but I did not finish dipping them and threw out the rest. Not going to keep this one."
"1","5","I rated this 5 stars because they are delicious; however, I must have done something wrong. It's such an easy recipe that I don't know how I could have messed it up. These did not stay in the shape of balls. It was a big mess! I ended up spooning them into cupcake wrappers and pouring the chocolate on top. My son can't get enough, and I thought I was going to be sick after all that I ate!"
"1","5","I messed it up by putting the cake a frosting in my food processor being lazy, it turned into a paste like play-dough. So I only made a couple to try before commiting to a whole batch. Even with my blunder they are delicious. I used strawberry cake and cream cheese frosting. Its like a strange chocolate covered strawberry."
"1","3","I thought these cake balls looked great judging from the pics posted by others. They also got really good reviews. However, I didn't think they were worth the time. Perhaps it was due to the combination of flavors we used (white cake with rainbow chip frosting) but my husband said it reminded him of cake that has sat for too long and gotten soggy. The finished product was cute and it was fun to make with my two year old. If you are I die hard cake lover you'll probably love this too. Otherwise it might fall a tad short of expectations."
"1","5","This whole concept is amazing! These were so easy to make and they are absolutely wonderful. The possibilities are endless with the cake, frosting flavor combinations! I used milk chocolate candy making wafers instead of the bark."
"1","4","These are soooo good. Everyone loves them - lemon with white confectioner's coating were my biggest hit. They are quite a pain to make, though. I have decided it is absolutely necessary to freeze the balls for at least an hour (but as long as overnight) before coating them. I use a fondue fork to dip them which seems to work better than anything else. People are constantly asking me to make these. Fortunately, the recipe makes a TON of them. Unfortunately, they never last long!"
"1","5","AWESOME RECIPE! If you have a lot of people at your work or school you want to treat, this is a great way to do so!"
"1","4","This was good. Alot of work but the results looked nice and tasted good. I used the Dark Chocolate Cake I and Cream Cheese Frosting II recipes for the cake and icing. I followed many reviewers suggestions and 1. cut back on the amount of icing used (I agree if you use to much it gets too soggy... hit a few spots where there had been to much icing), 2. refrigerated overnight before forming into balls, 3.freezing balls for approx. 2 hours before dipping in chocolate (choc. chips + shortening, liked the idea of coffee mug and microwave... cut down on mess and time) Will have to try with a chocolate icing and do a mix of white and milk chocolate as coatings. Thanks for the good recipe."
"1","5","Oh so good! I made chocolate with chocolate icing the first time and yellow with german chocolate next. I chose to coat them in confectioners sugar/milk icing. So good especially straight out of the freezer!!"
"1","5","Such a basic recipe for such an outstanding result! People were raving over these! I used funfetti cake mix with funfetti icing. After making the balls, I refrigerated for over an hour. I then dipped them in white chocolate and put colorful sprinkles on top. Will DEFINITELY make again!"
"1","5","I was at first skeptical about making this but I am glad I did. It is a bit messy, but cooking with a 6 year old and a little help fromthe one year old always is.... any way these were delicious. We did need more of the chocolate confectioners coating than called for and we used only half the frosting. Following other suggestions we also froze the balls before diping in chocolate. Very good recipe!"
"1","5","Made this today and was very pleased. I used devils food cake mix, cream cheese icing and chocolate almond bark. I used all of the icing, froze the balls (that I shaped by hand-messy but it workd great) about an hour and they turned out perfect. I can see how this recipe can become addictive - I want to try the red velvet/white chocolate ones next and I KNOW that I will be making these for the holidays ! Thank you for the great recipe!"
"1","2","I was not thrilled with these... the texture is gooey and there was no where near enough chocolate for coating these in the recipe. I tried red velvet with cream cheese frosting for the inside and milk chocolate on the outside. I dont' think I'll ever make these again. They were edible but they were definitely the last ones to go."
"1","3","I actually didn't like these, maybe because I was expecting a different texture in the middle, more like cake. The flavor was okay, but the consistency was kind of gross, I felt like I was eating cake batter in the middle. The only variation I could handle was the german chocolate, maybe because the german chocolate frosting was a different. They weren't a big hit at the party either, so I won't be making them again."
"1","5","Yummy, I made dark choco. cake with homemade creamcheese frosting, and I used german choco. and white choco. for dipping. The choco. on choco. tasted like Ho Ho's withought the icky white stuff (crisco with sugar). My husband helped and we had a lot of fun."
"1","3","There were so many mixed reviews on this one. I used the Duncan Hines Devils Food. I only used 1 cup water and 1/4 cup oil when making the cake. I also let the cake cool before mixing. I cut in half as there is only two of us. I crumbled the cake in bowl and I mixed in 1 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of DOVE Chocolate Ice cream topping. I like the concept but knew we would not like the frosting. I mixed this with my dough beaters and then by hand. I used my scoop to make half round balls, with flat bottoms. I put in fridge for a hour. Half a cake made 20 nice size balls. I then melted 1/2 cup semi sweet chips and added 1 tbs peanut butter. I dipped 10 of them, put back in fridge. I served them with Ice Cream for dessert, topped with the Dove topping on the ice cream. I iced the other half of the cake with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. These were good this way. I was going for a kinda Reeses, cake ball."
"1","4","ok this was a very hard one to make. Please everyone make sure that you put them in frig for at least 1 or 2 hrs before dipping."
"1","5","So good! I made a red velvet cake and added homemade cream cheese frosting to it. After making these a few times, I think the key is not adding to much frosting. If you're using store bought, a 16 oz container is way too much. You want just a little more than enough to hold the cake together when you smash it but any more and they turn into mush. These little bite size treats are great for a party and you can dress them up to be as fancy as you want!"
"1","5","Great recipe, but be sure to use the store-bought frosting. I tried to make my own and ended up using too much which ruined the recipe. I had to start all over. Also, wait for the cake to COMPLETELY cool before crumbling. Don't try to do it while it's still warm or you'll end up with a mess. Also, they roll easier if you refridgerate them for at least an hour beforehand."
"1","5","These tasted AWESOME! I had some trouble with the coating, but that was my fault, so I still give it 5 stars. I used the chocolate candy coating, it took me 16 ounces and it STILL didn't cover all of them! The coating was SUPER thick. Like I said, they tasted great, but the coating was more of a shell... Anyone have any suggestions on how to thin the coating? Email me at Courtney6831@yahoo.com subject: cake balls. Thanks so much!!!"
"1","4","I was super excited to make these. I love to bake (cakes in particular) and this fun spin on candy and cakes seemed like too much fun. I used a small cookie scoop to get make the balls, and it worked fairly well, but I still had to get one hand dirty making sure they would hold shape. I also never seemed to figure out how to dip them properly, but in the end a pair of small tongs and some rolling around worked well. This recipe is fun if you and your friends have some time and don't mind getting a little messy. Delicious anyhow."
"1","5","This recipe is excellent. I used German Chocolate Cake with Carmel Pecan frosting. I dipped them in milk chocolate and then swirled white chocolate on top, all 3 hours before bringing them to my mom's house."
"1","5","Oh my gosh. These are amazing! This is probably THE best dessert I have ever made. I am big on sweets and I don't think I have ever come across something so delish! I used red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting. I started off melting semi-sweet chocolate chips, and when I ran out of those I went to the store and bought the candy dipping chocolate that comes in the microwavable container. This was a bit easier. I used 2 of these containers and still needed more chocolate! I guess I coated mine very thick. I tried my best to get them looking nice and smooth, but soon realized it didn't matter what they looked like cause they tasted sooo good! These are a bit time consuming but soooo worth it!!"
"1","5","I made red velvet cake balls. I have a favorite red velvet cake recipe and cream cheese frosting so I made them from scratch. They were a HUGE HIT!!! SO DELICIOUS! I also made german chocolate cake ones (out of a bit and canned frosting) and they too were very good! A must try recipe!!"
"1","5","OMG!! These were the best. They taste like the perfect brownie bites. Make them small...they are very rich!"
"1","4","I was looking for something sweet and good that I could do at home and take as treats to work for valentines day. These were fairly easy to make and the flavor combinations are limitless. This is the first time I have done dipping so that was a bit of a challenge. One thing is I used tons more dipping choc. than was called for but that could be because I was am a novice. I used a pound of both white and milk choc. for two cakes but I think I ended up wasting a lot of it. Turns out that didn't matter. They were very good and very sweet."
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful! I fixed them for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them. They keep well, too."
"1","4","Great recipe! I mixed french vanilla cake mix with french vanilla icing and coconut milk and threw in 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut flakes. Covered in white chocolate and rolled in more coconut flakes.  Brought them for Thanksgiving. My brother who eats like a football player had one word to describe them- DECADENT  Only 4 stars because it can get pretty time consuming and messy rolling the balls"
"1","5","Just made two batches of these using strawberry cake mix with cream cheese frosting with a white chocolate dipping bar, and chocolate fudge cake with chocolate fudge frosting, with a double chocolate dipping bar. Added red sprinkles to the MELTED white chocolate and crushed walnuts to the MELTED chocolate. For dipping I used a candy dipper from a cake company.. SUPER easy. did not spend more than two hours from start to finish. These are truly delicious."
"1","5","Very rich, very addictive, and crumbling the cake up after it comes out of the oven can actually be a little theraputic!"
"1","5","OK, So I just made these and they were like the easiest and guickest party snack ever!!! My friends and family were amazed. They thought I spent hours working on them. Awesome with a capital A!!!!!!"
"1","5","The first time I made these I used spice cake, cream cheese frosting and white chocolate. The second time I used fudge cake, fudge icing and added a little peppermint extract and coated them with semi sweet chocolate. They are really good but extremely time consuming! They are even good frozen, which my husband discovered! Great recipe if you have a lot of time on your hands :)"
"1","4","i made these with chocolate chocolate chocolate and thought it was to much. Then i made them with lemon lemon vanilla and they were delicious. the cake gets really sticky and tricky to roll but they are fun to eat and the kids like them."
"1","4","Very tasty but very sweet. These were fun for the kids to make and the family loved them. Instead of dipping the entire ball, I just drizzled the tops with melted almond bark. They looked pretty and this reduced the sweetness to a tolerable level!"
"1","5","These were a little time cosuming but worth making! I made chocolate with chocolate and then dipped them in white chocolate and also made strawberry with cream cheese and then dipped them in chocolate. Some tips I found helpful don't break the cake when it firsts comes out because it seems gooey when you mix it with the frosting and takes longer to set, I actually allowed my first batch to sit in the refrigerator overnight and they came out perfect! also instead of using a melon baller my Mom and I both used a ice cream scoop. I used a small one and she used a medium sized one and they came out perfectly shaped. I will definetely be making these again."
"1","5","I used 2 whole (16oz?) packs of the confectioner's coating for each double dipped batch. Fork dipping worked the best for me, I tried the egg separator and spoons also. One problem I had that I didn't see mentioned here was the cold cake expanding and oozing out of the coating as it hardened. That's why I had to double dip to cover up the holes.  2/13/08 ETA: I tried a new flavor combo that I don't think was mentioned here yet... S'MORES!!! I still used chocolate cake and chocolate confectioner's coating but I used a 16oz (yes, the big one) container of Marshmallow Fluff instead of the icing and mixed in a 10.5 oz package of mini marshmallows into the slightly hot cake, if it's too hot the marshmallows just melt in. I rolled the balls into crushed graham cracker crumbs, then dipped in the coating. You have to be ok with the fact that the coating will not be smooth after some crumbs get mixed in it. The marshmallow flavor does kind of gets lost in the chocolate but I think the extra gooeyness makes up for it and when you bite into it and get a bit of marshmallow it's great. **If anyone else attempts this please note it is much harder to form the cake into balls because they're so much stickier, I could only do 5 or 6 before I had to put the mix back in the freezer."
"1","3","Even though this sounded like an odd recipe, I thought I'd give it a try because of all the positive reviews--I wish I had gone with my instinct. I made the Red Velvet/cream cheese icing combo, and that part is okay; but once it was dipped in the almond bark, it was WAY too sweet. Also, little crumbs fell off into the bark and made a red mess. Sorry, this just wasn't my taste."
"1","5","The resipe sounds strange to me, but I had to make them because of all the great reviews. I made a yellow cake with choc frosting. Them I dipped some in white choc, milk and dark choc. They were SOO good. And I put them in the freezer for a ate night snack. They are evn better when they come out of the freezer. Next time, I want to make a lemon cake with lemon frosting and dip them in whit choc. Easy recipe."
"1","5","Wow! This recipe was just weird enough that I had to try it. I used spice cake with cream cheese frosting and coated them with white chocolate coating. While messy, it was REALLY easy. Make sure that you freeze the balls though before dipping. I am unsure how anyone could successfully coat them when freshly made into the balls. Way too mushy to take the warm coating. I made 1' balls and got about 4 dozen or so out of one cake. These are REALLY yummy though. Everyone wanted to know what exactly they were as it was hard to dicipher ingredients."
"1","4","very addictive! won't be making them again...they were very tedious...but worth the time! not making them again b/c i want to fit into my jeans!!!!"
"1","5","To Die For!! I made chocolate, spice cake, and lemon so far. I use chocolate chips mixed with a few tbs of shortening instead of the coating candy. These are a hit wherever I take them! I'm going to try peppermint ones for the holidays."
"1","5","These are so yummy. I found the recipe to be very easy and it worked like a charm. I did follow the advice of others and put my cake into the freezer before making the balls. I then placed them in the freezer overnight until I could make time to dip them. I used chocolate cake/chocolate icing and dipped into raspberry/chocolate chips that I melted with a bit of oil. Worked great and were to die for!!! I am now going to dip my yellow cake/white icing balls into coconut that I have put into the food processor to create more crumbs than shredded coconut. Thanks so much for the recipe."
"1","5","Soooo simple and inexpensive yet looks like you went all out!! Made these to add to my goody bags last Christmas! Used devils food cake mix with chocolate frosting and chocolate almond bark and sprinkled with chocolate jimmes. I also made a strawberry cake mix with vanilla frosting and vanilla almond bark. These I sprinkled with red and green sugar. Used the toothpick method, and also added a bit of crisco to the almond bark. May try spice cake w/crm cheese frosting and vanilla bark this year! THANKS for the awesome recipe!!"
"1","5","This things are wonderful and the varieties are endless!! I have them on my permanent cookie/candy list for Xmas!!! This are easy enough that someone who doesn't cook can make them without difficulty."
"1","4","I used the mixer to mix the cake/frosting, makes for a smooth 'batter', the melon baller makes them to small, used a teaspoon and my hands, froze the batch for about 2 hours, and dipped using a fork, i have no idea how you are suppose to coat all those balls with 3 oz of coating, i used a pound package and that was just about right. Overall a very good receipe, something different for the holidays, I am going to make a batch at Christmas using red and green sprinkles on top."
"1","3","I tried this recipe with red velvet cake and a cream cheese icing. While I felt the plain cake balls were quite delicious when I used a vanilla flavored almond bark on a few, they were too sweet and the bark was too heavy for my tastes. Maybe I used the wrong kind of confectioners coating but that was the only kind I knew to use. I think a nice, soft cream cheese icing (maybe one you would use with carrot cake and that is almost a pourable consistency) could also work as a replacement and result in a much nicer and more familiar cake recipe. I will definitely be trying a different type of coating the next time I attempt the cake balls or will just make them plan without anytime of coating."
"1","5","Try with red velvet cake mix--Great!!!"
"1","4","They do taste really good, but I'm giving it four stars because they are such a hassle to make. And it does create a mess."
"1","5","I had a boxed cake mix and container of frosting in my pantry that I was trying to find something interesting to do with because I typically like to make those from scratch, and this was quick, easy, and so impressive! The possibilities on the combination of different flavors is endless. I'd like to try red velvet and cream cheese, and pumpkin and cream cheese next!"
"1","5","I make these and bring them to work. The woman I work with love them. I have made devils food cake with chocolate icing, german chocolate with pecan coconut icing, and carrot cake with cream cheese icing ( this one I coated with white almond bark). All were wonderful. Be sure to thin the bark with shortening and freeze dough then balls for easy handling and dipping. The balls freeze well if you want to make days ahead."
"1","5","So Good & SO Easy!!!"
"1","5","Fabulous! I used yellow cake mix with milk chocolate 'whipped' frosting and 6 oz box Baker's brand Premium White Chocolate Baking Squares to dip and multi-colored sprinkles. I removed the crusty edges of the cake before mixing in the frosting and used a cookie scoop to make the balls (tapped the scoop on the counter to release the balls), not time consuming in my opinion. I put the balls in the freezer for a few hours before dipping. Made about 3 dozen balls and only had enough dip for half of them. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","mmmmmmmmmmmmm....i've made chocolate/chocolate/chocolate, and strawberry with vanilla frosting and dipped in choc. sooooo goooood!"
"1","5","Adults and kids both loved these! It's a bit time consuming to make a million bite-size balls but well worth it!!"
"1","4","Well, I used spice cake instead of chocolate cake - but everything else the same... I found it easier to crumble it all together in my food processor - but then it became a really sticky mess. I found it easier to work with once I refrigerated it for 15 minutes or so - then I could just roll them into a ball in my hands and then I could just dip them into the melted chocolate using a toothpick - it was just so very time consuming - but they were tasty little treats... not sure i'd do this again."
"1","5","This recipe is a keeper! Time consuming but well worth the effort. I made the recipe to the rolled ball stage and stored them in the refrigerater for about 10 hours. They were the perfect hardness for dipping in the chocolate. I used dark chocolate with a approx. 3 tsp. of canola oil to thin, the thinned chocolate is best for dipping. I also used a butter cake w/ white chocolate frosting. Everyone at the open house wanted the recipe. Will make again next month for graduation!"
"1","2","After reading all the stellar reviews, these were a disappointment. Perhaps I should have used less than the 16 oz. tub of frosting called for, or refrigerated the mix first. The mix wouldn't hold together well enough to form balls, and I ended up throwing it out. I used cherry cake, cream cheese frosting, and almond bark coating. The almond bark coating tasted 'off', so if I try these again I may go with chocolate chips."
"1","5","Awesome recipe! :) Time consuming, but well worth it. EVERYONE loved them. I made a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and then covered half of the balls in white chocolate and the other in milk chocolate. Right after I took the cake out of the oven, I combined it with the tub of frosting and it held together well. I still froze the mixture for about an hour after, then rolled them into little balls. Put them in the freezer again just for a couple of minutes and dipped them in the melted chocolate. I couldn't find 'almond bark' or 'confectioners candy coating' at the grocery store, so I just used chocolate chips and a little shortening. like I said, AWESOME!"
"1","5","These are amazing! My husband loved them. I made them with funfetti cake mix and icing. I will definetly make these again! I love how many variations you can make!"
"1","5","I made such a mess making these that I didn't even finish making the entire batch. After we tasted them me and my ENTIRE family were very sorry I didn't finish! So delicious. Next time I will read the reviews first and follow all of the tips because these were sinfully good. I will definetely be making these again. YUMMMM!"
"1","5","These are really good. I did freeze the cake and frosting mixture overnight and it made it much easier to work with the next day. YUM!!!"
"1","5","YUM! I made these for Christmas and everyone could not believe what they really were. They thought I had spent a lot of time and effort making candy. I used a german chocolate cake mix and coconut pecan frosting. Even my sis-in-law who HATES coconut loved these! I can't wait to do a lemon/white chocolate one! Oh and i had a few left after the holidays, so i stuck them in my freezer and they are still great! in fact, they taste really good cold!"
"1","5","I have made these many times and they always get great reviews. They really do taste just like a donught hole - but better! I have made them with choc. cake and choc. frosting and also with german cake and pecan coconut frosting. Next, I'm going to try carrot cake and cheesecream frosting...can't wait!"
"1","5","These were great! I was amazed at how easy they are to make and how good they taste. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to making something this good and this easy! This is a keeper!"
"1","5","This recipe was forwarded to me by a friend, and these are absolutely sinful. I used devil's food cake mix, dark chocolate and raspberry frosting, and chocolate almond bark. I also chilled the filling before rolling. After some trial and error with the melon baller/toothpick method (I just couldn't get them compacted enough to stay together once they hit the hot almond bark and I started rolling them around), I ended up just using my hands, tossing them into the glass bowl and rolling them up the side with a fork. I'm sure I used a lot more almond bark because of the method, but I don't see how 3 oz would cover them all. I used about 16 oz of almond bark, and got 60 super-ball sized cake balls. Yes, it was kind of messy. Totally worth it!"
"1","4","This is a fun recipe, but it can get messy to make. Even after freezing the balls, the cake still kept sticking to my fork when I dipped in the chocolate, resulting in cakey chocolate, and messy looking balls. But I loved how fancy the good ones look, and the taste is rich and yummy."
"1","4","Meh, these were OK. Maybe it was the type of cake mix/frosting I used (red velvet/cream cheese frosting), but I really didn't think these were anything to get excited over. Cute, yes, but I won't be making them again."
"1","5","Had these at my MIL house last week... They are fantastic! I cannot WAIT to make some for DH and I!"
"1","5","These are a huge hit!! Although a bit time consuming, Cake Balls are fun to make and well worth the effort. I recently made them using a spice cake mix with cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate. Great for entertaining or bake sales."
"0","1","It was a total disaster the cake in the icing do not stick together well"
"0","5","I loved them!!! They were very easy to make and super delicious! Can't wait to make them again! ;) Thanks for the recipe and the video! The video helped a lot."
"0","5","These are a lovely gift for anyone who likes to give cookies and treats during the holidays."
"0","5","One of the best ways, I've found to melt and keep the chocolate at the right temp. is to put it on a bowl and then into my slow cooker with about an inch of water. Cover the bowl so water doesn't get inside and set to HIGH. Mine took about 1-1/2 hrs to get to where it was perfect for dipping. Once it's where it needs to be, switch temp. to LOW.   Also, frozen 'dough' dips a lot easier. It sets almost instantly."
"0","5","These are awesome! I made the red velvet cake and mixed in cream cheese icing. After baking, I let it cool about 10 minutes. Then, I used about 2/3 of the icing container. My family loved these! My son even said, 'These are so good you could sell them and make a lot of money!'"
"0","3","It was simple to mix the crumbled cake with the dough, but I didn't read the reviews and know to freeze the balls before dipping. I found the cake balls were very mushy and would warp whenever I tried to dip them in the chocolate. I had to drizzle the hard chocolate instead since I couldn't dip it.  I'll try freezing the mix the next time I attempt this."
"0","3","These are very time consuming. I made these for a holiday work party and everyone raved about them and they were all gone when it was time for me to take the tray home. The flavor was very good but maybe next time I should use a food processor to crumble up the cake or discard the overly cooked edges."
"0","1","What a pain to make! I followed the 'most helpful' reviewer suggestions, still extremely disappointed in the final product."
"0","2","Tried this recipe. Didnot work for me. I baked cake as directed. Cooled completely. Then used food processor. Placed cake in processor with just enough frosting to make truffle like consistency. Rolled into balls, cooled for 20 minutes, or until firm enough to handle. Then dipped in coating. Found that if frozen and dipped into warm coating, they had a tendency to crack. This is a real trial and error recipe. Not as easy as they make it sound."
"0","3","This recipe is delicious but extremely time consuming and a huge pain in the tush! Also, I couldn't even get a tooth pick to stay on while I was dipping it so I can't imagine them staying on a pop stick. The time and effort is why I will never make them again."
"0","4","I have made these and taken them to work 3 times now - every time they've gotten raves! The first time I used a strawberry cake mix, chocolate frosting and chocolate bark; second time was chocolate cake with a little bit of Kahlua flavoring, chocolate frosting and vanilla bark; and this last time was cherry chip cake mix, vanilla frosting and chocolate bark. You could really do just about anything with this recipe. I form them with a cookie dough scoop and usually freeze them overnight before dipping. I will say, though, that a whole can of frosting mixed with the cake is too much. I use a half can or just slightly more and that's plenty. Otherwise they get goopy and don't want to harden very well."
"0","5","The grandkids just loved them! I dipped half in white chocolate and half in dark chocolate, then drizzled them with opposite flavored chocolate. Even the adults loved them especially since you can have just one if you want. The little kids liked sprinkles on top. Your imagination can really go wild with all the different cake, frosting and decorating combinations. Thanks Alison!"
"0","4","My kids have done this for years, they love them. Big hit at Christmas time."
"0","5","These are so easy to make and so good. I only just discovered the recipe about 6 wks ago and I have made them for my family twice and twice for co-workers."
"0","4","some tips to keep in mind is that the cake you choose should be moist and dense, this will not work for a fluffy and sponge like cake.  when turning your cake into crumbs make sure it is well crumbed. it is eaiser to place in a blender or food processor. for a weel dence cake let cake batter sit out for at least ten minutes before placing in oven. when adding frosting mis with hand of spatula. becarefull not to add to much frosting because it will come out to mushy and gross. last of all remember good cake goes well with good frosing so makesure that the flavors of your cake and frosting go wee together on more thing, your frosting cant be to light such as buttercream frosting or whipped cream. when dipping your cake in the chocolate, you can add a liitle shortning to thin out the chocolate"
"0","5","This is AWESOME! It's easy and fast, just loved it!"
"0","5","Easy to make and delicious to eat. Makes a truffle like cake ball."
"0","5","These are very delicious! I had trouble keeping the balls together when I dipped them in the chocolate (red velevet covered with white chocolate). I took some suggestions and froze the balls then dipped them, but small pieces kept falling off and by the time I finished there were small flecks of red velvet in my white chocolate. It didn't affect the taste, but it just didn't look as pretty as I wanted. Maybe I did something wrong?"
"0","5","Made these for a kid's party. Easy and a hit. Felt like I was cheating. Next time I will add some kind of 'spirit' to make them adult rated. Mmmm (hic)..."
"0","5","I've made these many times. I've tried all kinds of combinations....Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and white coating....Lemon cake with lemon frosting and white coating...red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and dark chocolate coating. Let me tell you, they are a HUGE hit at Church suppers!!!"
"0","2","Sounded like a good idea at first.... Someone else mentioned that it reminded them of eating cake that had already been chewed and that's pretty much dead on. The texture of the cake and frosting mixed is really unappealing. And I had a hard time dipping these in the chocolate. They just fell right off the toothpicks. Ended up looking nothing like the picture... Overall, mine were edible, just not great.  If I try these out again, next time I will use a blender to mix the cake and icing together instead of what I did originally (used a fork). The picture makes it look like a malted milk ball or something; maybe mixing it with a mixer will get that effect and make the inside a little more appealing.  Also, you need to have either a fondue set or something to keep the chocolate hot and melty while you dip these. In my experience, the toothpick dipping method didn't work very well - the balls tend to just fall off and your left with a big hole in the center. Someone mentioned using the tool you use when dying Easter eggs - that might be a good idea."
"0","1","turned out horrible...not tasting just horrible as in crumble all over and was very very hard to dip in chocolate."
"0","5","This recipe is so fun ! :) I made my own frosting, so I didn't measure how much I used. I froze the cake balls before dipping in chocolate. It makes it easier to dip.(especially in the heat of the summer) I have made these twice within a week. Got great reviews on both batches. Vanilla cake and chocolate cake both with chocolate coating. The combinations are endless. Thank you so much for such a fun and delish recipe."
"0","4","I made these this weekend for my dads birthday and there were the party favorite.  However, I had a bit of trouble with the cake.I let it cool, and added the frosting but they crumble turning quickly into mush. However, I put the batter in the freezer over night and then next morning dipped them and chocolate and it worked so well! I just scooped and hand rolled them and the process was made simple! Also, the night I stuck my mix into the freezer I was in panic and made another batch that was yellow cake and chocolate frosting (the previous being strawberry and cream cheese frosting). I let the yellow cool over night but had a hard time getting them to stay on the stick, so I plopped them in the freezer and took out the strawberry. Freezing them seemed to help a lot! And then after they were all dipped I put them in the fridge and they came put perfectly!"
"0","5","Best dessert I've made in a long time. I did have to freeze the balls to get them to hold together during the dipping. I have frozen several for future snacks. Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","5","Very good!"
"0","5","I made these for easter and it was a hit i used white cake mix and white frosting (I used half of the can) and i used bark coating instead of confectioners bar chocolate and used pretzels has sticks and rainbow sprinkles. I did leave the cake mix and frosting in a ball shape with the pretzel in the fridge over night as 1 reviewer suggested and then placed the coating it dries up fast so u wanna put the sprinkles on right away because i did the coating in a rushing time i put them in the freezer for 2hrs and off i went to our easter party! they were all gone before the actual party started =) Thanks!"
"0","4","Tasty and a hit at my recent family party! I found the instructions to be a bit too vague and it would have been easier to chill the cake balls rather than try to work with them warm. Delicious however!"
"0","5","this recipe was awesome!! So much fun to make and they look really cute when you are done with them!"
"0","5","Very easy and delicious! I made them along with several homemade bake goods, and THESE were the favorite of everyone by far."
"0","3","These were okay - simple enough to make when you follow other people's changes, just freezing the balls before you dip them. The chocolate coating was not enough to cover all the balls though. They were just too rich for my taste but other people enjoyed them."
"0","5","Incredible!!! I used lollipop sticks dipped in Candy Melts then stuck into the ball. Let it set in the fridge for just a few minutes then dip the ball into the Candy Melt. Great for kids parties! Less mess than regular cake and cupcakes. The stick really helps since they just eat it off the stick. The Candy Melts are made to melt and then harden around things and they come in all colors--making green ones for St Patty's Day!"
"0","5","Very good and very easy. It's easy to switch types of mixes and frostings for different flavors."
"0","5","I have made these a couple of times. The first batch I used a white cake mix and added 1/2 can of funfetti vanilla frosting. They were good. The next batch I made were made with choc. cake and 1/2 can of choc. frosting. I dipped them in white choc. The choc. ones were awesome!!! Super easy to make...be sure to freeze before dipping in melted chocolate."
"0","1","I got some of these as a gift for Christmas from a friend and they were FABULOUS! I just tried to make them and have a gooey mess on my hands, the cake/frosting mix is so moist the chocolate coating won't set up! I will never make a recipe without reading the reviews again. I also think that if so many people suggest refrigerating/freezing the balls before coating then that should just be added to the recipe! This is also a very time consuming process...doubt I'll try these again!"
"0","5","These came out great. They are sweet so the kids LOVED them! I did put the balls in the freezer for 4 hours before coating them as others suggested. Thank you so much!"
"0","5","I love these! I Make them all the time... so many different ways to make these. Great recipe to get you started!"
"0","5","Very simple and super easy to make. I made these for a small party of 5 people and there were none left at the end of the night. I was asked to make them again for our next get together."
"0","3","Decent, easy enough, but not all that impressive. Probably won't make again."
"0","4","A time consuming recipe but well worth it! Didn't have any issues with it at all and made a lot of people happy during the Holidays!"
"0","4","Like a lot of reviewers said... these are *very* time consuming!! They would be a great project for small children, though. I rolled the balls and refrigerated overnight (i'm sure a few hours would have been fine). The coating part was what was so time consuming! But the family loved them, especially the boys and especially the vanilla. I may make them again but not for a while!"
"0","3","Fun, messy, tastes like donuts"
"0","5","These are incredibly good and easy. My son has already requested them for his birthday in 4 months."
"0","5","This is so easy to make and it turns out wonderfully. Everyone loved it. IT tastes great!"
"0","3","ok, to be fair, these taste great and are so easy to make (the actual cake/frosting part). But I had a horrible time making these by no fault of the recipe submitter. haha. I had set out to make pumpkins, but my melted chocolate seized up and wouldn't coat the cake balls. I ended up putting blobs of melted chocolate, a swirl of icing and crushed pretzels on top. They were not cute (partygoers named them 'chocolate meatballs' haha) but they were yummy!"
"0","5","Very addictive, as the combinations are endless. Labor intensive, but always a huge hit!"
"0","5","My family loves these, thank you SO MUCH!"
"0","3","good recipe"
"0","5","Great recipe!"
"0","5","These were absolutely fantastic! They turned out great and were a huge hit. Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe!"
"0","5","I switched out the chocolate for vanilla so it wouldn't be so rich. A huge hit at work, and gone in 5 mins. One of my fav recipes."
"0","4","Very good. Thanks for sharing."
"0","4","we made this but i thought the chocolate were too rich... but thats just me we changed the recipe to white cake, vanilla frosting and the chocolate bar and it was delicious but we actually didnt use this recipe we found it on the food network channel and thought it sounded good... its excactly the same though and still very good.:) But again if you rlly like chocolate use this recipe im just not a chocolate girl:)"
"0","3","They are a fun idea and really cute. I made them for my daughters 8th grade graduation party and some people loved them ... some thought they were ok... probably would experiment to make them more flavorful.."
"0","4","These were super yummy, if a little messy. I would have given 5 stars, but very time consuming to make. I used whipped cream topping instead of the icing to cut down on some of the sugar and I think it added to the moistness of the cake. Overall - would totally make it again if I had time."
"0","5","These were not my favorite thing, but everyone else gobbled them up. My dad hates cake and generally refuses to eat it, but he liked these cake balls! I think the best combination is red velvet cake with cream cheese icing."
"0","5","Very yummy and addictive. A little time-consuming but well worth it. I followed lots of others advice and froze the balls before dipping them in melted chocolate chips/vegetable oil mixture. Everyone loved them."
"0","5","So easy to make and there are so many different flavor combinations to try! What a great idea!"
"0","4","I made these with German chocolate cake and coconut pecan frosting. For me it was no simple task to roll or dip them in chocolate. I ended up spooning the chocolate over top of them and sprinkling toasted coconut on top of them. They tasted really good but I can't be so sure if they were worth all the fuss and mess. I may try again and let them freeze longer before I try coating them."
"0","5","This recipe worked perfectly as written. It is an amazing recipe and will be my new dish to take to gatherings. I can only imagine the combinations you can use! Yummmm"
"0","2","I made these with red velvet cake with cream cheese icing. The cake balls themselves were tasty, but trying to get the chocolate onto them was a complete nightmare. 3 oz. is nowhere near enough to cover 36 of these...it covered about 4 of them. I may just not melting the chocolate to the right consistency but it was just a big mess. Will not do this again."
"0","4","recipe is really easy and good but making the balls... is soooo time consuming! makes a ton at a time though!"
"0","5","This was very easy to follow. I have made them a few times and everyone loves them! Thanks so much!"
"0","5","These are amazing!!! I made 2 batches: chocolate & red velvet. It took about 4 hours and I have about 60-70 balls. I could have made more but the first ones were a little big. I forgot to half the icing/frosting but they still turned out great. I was able to heat my almond bark over the stove on the lowest setting and it took about 7 minutes. I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil because I didn't have Crisco and it really helped to thin out the chocolate. They are in my freezer waiting for me to take them to a party. Thank you so much! I'm sure my family will be impressed :)"
"0","5","Make assorted Cake Balls and attach to a lollipop stick (available at any craft store) then put a little plastic lollypop bag over and tie with pretty ribbons. Arrange as an edible bouquet in any fun basket or tin! We had these as favors for a friends bridal shower! Beautiful and soooo easy. You can also switch the frosting for cream cheese. Sooo yummy!"
"0","5","I looooooooove cake balls (red velvet is my favorite!)"
"0","3","This is a hard one to rate because it'll depend on what cake/icing you use. I'd printed the recipe out in Dec 2006 & just got to trying it. Back then many suggested German Choc cake & Carmel Pecan frosting, so that is what I used. I think using a Choc Fudge cake with Fudge icing would work great because it could maybe taste like a truffle. Mine needed many blocks of almond bark to coat all the balls & it was a mess. I froze them before coating which helped & still keep frozen now. They taste better from the freezer & after a day. I probably should've read recent reviews, but had a short circuit in the brain & forgot to. Will make again with the fudge cake & frosting & then I'd like to try maybe either confetti cake or a lemon cake with cream cheese or white icing. I'm not much of a German Choc cake person so that is why it got 3 stars - hopefully I'll give it more the next time I make it."
"0","5","We made the cake and frosting from scratch, but loved the idea of cake balls. Our whole family LOVED them!!!"
"0","5","All the neighbors and my family loved these. YUM!"
"0","5","These have become my go-to dessert. My suggestions: 1 can frosting to less than a full cake (usually take out two pieces for myself and husband), chocolate cake and frosting mix very easily while white and lemon cakes don't. To make it easier to mix, I like to break up the cake when it's still warm. Then mix, mix, and mix some more until the consistency is as creamy as possible. Like others, I refrigerate the mix before rolling into balls, then freeze the balls before dipping. These are a huge hit. Yes, these are very sweet but that's why they're perfect little bite-sized treats."
"0","5","Made the mistake by not letting the cake mixture cool so it could form into balls. It was still good mushy!"
"0","5","WOW...What can I say....I made these a couple of times and each time they come out better and better,,,easy to make...but alittle messy....still havent found a easy way to dunk the balls into the melted chocolate. Other then that problem...they are VERY good and very rich."
"0","4","I love mashing my frosting into my cake whenever I eat it so I was really looking forward to this recipe. But when you follow the directions and combine your cake/frosting while the cake is still warm you end up with balls that have the same texture as gooey, raw dough. even my husband who never questions any food you put infront of him said 'don't you need to cook these before you eat them?'. Ill make these again but ill wait until the cake has cooled completely before mixing it with the frosting."
"0","5","These tasted amazing but didn't look too pretty! Will try again."
"0","5","I can not believe you only need three ingredients. They are so good they taste almost like donut holes."
"0","4","I used strawberry cake mix with cream cheese frosting and chocolate coating. I have used WAY more then 3 oz of chocolate. I don't know how you could make these without freezing them. I have been working in small batches and it has become very time consuming. The flavor combo is awesome. This will be used as a learning experience and I will try again."
"0","3","These are delicious, but kinda time consuming to make, and did not produce the perfect balls pictured. I ended up using my pampered chef small baller to make all of the balls. Then I froze them. The next day, I dipped them in the chocolate. Even thought they were frozen, I still had a hard time getting them in the melted chocolate quickly enough, without leaving crumbiness in the melted chocolate. As a result, not all of the balls looked smooth on the outside? Mmmmm...they are delicious, though."
"0","5","my mom's been making these for a couple of years, since she heard about them from girls at work, and i've been making them for a year or so. they're absolutely delicious, and yes, i found out the hard way that you MUST let the cake cool before mixing the icing into the crumbled cake! i like to get a second thing of icing, and add just a little bit more icing to mine. makes them even MORE moist and delicious. i made them for people at work and friend,s, family, etc; they ALL loved them, and ranted and raved about them--they called them 'mary's chocolate balls.' hahha among the 'ball' recipes they're probably the easiest--i prefer oreo truffles now, but they take longer, to make. and in the end, i started off with cake balls!"
"0","5","These are a HUGE hit with my family and friends. I have tired a few different combinations so far and each has been great. Red Velvet w/ cream cheese icing, Carrot cake w/cream cheese icing, and Butter Pecan w/ cream cheese icing. I used the white chocolate chips for my coating and it turned out great. I made 2 batches of these for a recent meeting and there were hardly any leftovers to bring home for the family."
"0","4","Made them for a cocktail party and got good reviews. These are perfect for a 'finger' dessert. The only bad thing was that it took me about two hours to prepare. Very easy though."
"0","4","Excellent recipe and big hit at my daughter's sports banquet. Hubby coated the balls and didn't like the way the coating was working so he thinned it with milk. Cake Balls were still very moist and good. Will definitely make again and will try coating with melted chocolate. This is a keeper."
"0","5","I love making these messy things! I melt good quality choc. chips for the coating, but I've used meijer brand choc. chips too. They taste good, but don't look as pretty. I also add a teaspoon of corn syrup to the chocolate to give it a shine. German chocolate cake and coconut frosting is delicious. Tastes like an Almond Joy! I dip them with a fork, and push them onto a cold cookie sheet with a toothpick."
"0","4","I made these, it took 4 hours, and I move quickly. I followed everyones suggestions, let me add 2 things. 1. I used devils food cake, and it bled into the white coating, so I added chocolate chips and I was ok, but be careful. 2. I noticed some people had a flat ring of coating on the bottom. I used styrofoam, put wax paper over it, and stuck the ball after it was coated with the toothpick in it until it hardened. Worked great. A lot of work though! I did it from scratch, cake, froasting abd Ghiradelli and chocolate chip coating with a little shortening."
"0","5","I just made these with german chocolate cake mix and coconut pecan frosting. Very rich, very sweet & very good. I mixed the freshly baked cake in my mixer until it turned into a dough consistency & then added the frosting. I froze them before dipping as others suggested. I melted chocolate chips to dip them in & I think this made the coating a little too thick. I just googled how to thin melted chocolate & it said to add a small bit of shortening so I think I'll try that next time. It makes alot of cookie balls. I got 48 large balls out of this batch. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
"0","5","I did Carrot Cake/Cream Cheese Icing and covered them in the white almond bark. I tried white chocolate chips at first and these didn't do too well,almond bark is definately the way to go!"
"0","5","AWESOME!!! cant wait to try dif flavors! a lil time consuming but very worth it! Half way thru I got lazy and just drizzled the choc on instead of fully coating. I used yellow cake, choc frost & choc. That's what's so neat is you can use whatever you have in the cabinet! if you dont have frosting, whip up a batch. thank you for this recipe!"
"0","5","I felt guilty serving these - they were so easy! Got Rave reviews!!! I used reduced sugar chocolate cake mix, and frosting and put them in the refrigerator for 2 hours - used a chocolate ganache recipe from this site instead of the candy quick - only because I did not have it. They were a hit!!! Making them again 2 days later for a meeting!"
"0","5","Delish! I made cherry centers dipped in chocolate. Thank goodness for the comments left by others though.... freeze the balls overnight before dipping in chocolate! And I used the whole bag of confectioner's bark."
"0","4","I needed something to bring to a party and had a coupon for Betty Crocker cake mix & frosting so ... I made cake balls for the first time! I will make this again with different flavor combinations and homemade cake."
"0","5","YES!  I made the original chocolate recipe, but used triple chocolate chip frosting. One thing, I did put the cake and frosting mixture in te fridge for about an hour because it was so warm in my little kitchen. :-/ It helped alot.  I am going to try marble fudge cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate and vanilla coating and white cake with buttercream frosting and vanilla coating. These are effin awesome!"
"0","4","I used devil's food cake mix with german chocolate icing, then dipped in chocolate almond bark. Delish!!!!"
"0","3","Eh, ok. I think I prefer something like oreo balls, etc. This would be great with cream cheese instead of frosting. I just didn't 'get' it. They were difficult to dip and mine wanted to fall apart, even though I froze them first, as suggested by PP. Not sure if I'll give it a second shot."
"0","4","A big hit! Thanks."
"0","4","These were pretty good! The only thing I did different was use cream cheese icing instead of chocolate icing...which I'm glad I did because these were REALLY sweet!! Very tasty, though! Everyone loved them and didn't believe that I made them myself. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","I'm giving 4 stars because of taste. But, these are too much of a hassle to make and I will not be making them again."
"0","5","I love love LOVE this recipe. I have made several batches of these, all of them different cakes and icings. You never have to make the same ones twice unless you want to. I did tweak the recipe a bit. I did not use the entire container of icing in a batch. It was just too much. Also, unless you like them really rich, I would suggest NOT using a chocolate icing and a chocolate cake. It was just too sweet for my family. We'll definitely keep making these!"
"0","4","FREEZE these! Or refrigerate for a few hours. It will save you a lot of trouble! I've made these a few times. They are super easy. You really do need to freeze or refrigerate before you dip in chocolate, though. I've made yellow cake/choc icing/choc dipped & strawberry cake/white icing/which choc dipped. I prefer the strawberry bc they are less sweet. For me, they are way to much trouble in that they make a mess (too many dishes for me) and are too sweet for me to enjoy, so I won't be making them again. But they are easy and are really fun to serve. And it's fun coming up with different combos."
"0","4","These were by no means gourmet, but they were fun and tasty. I used yellow cake and vanilla frosting, dipped in melted semisweet chocolate chips, and decorated with sprinkles. Because of the negative feedback about sogginess, I did not add the entire can of frosting. Just enough to hold the cake together, after crumbling it into very small crumbs. I also added some good vanilla to the frosting to counteract the canned taste. I wish I'd had enough time to freeze the balls before dipping them, because they really did fall apart in the chocolate. Freezing would have made all the difference."
"0","4","Maybe it was because I made the cake and frosting from scratch, but sometimes the balls didn't hold together and fell apart while dipping in chocolate. One addition I made was adding coconut to the frosting and cake mixture and it was very delicious."
"0","5","These are very good- I have made with carrot cake and cream cheese icing and my husband love love loved them. I am making them for a work party soon."
"0","5","excellent recipe for a kids party - love it - i would suggest a few things - once you roll them place in the refrigerator until you are ready to dip in the chocolate it helps - watch your icing to cake ratio - and last let kids help to decorate - my son had a blast..."
"0","4","Really easy. Very good! Not five star good in my opinion but still very good. I would make them again. I made these with red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting, and chocolate almond bark. I think I would try and use real white chocolate next time, which could potentially make these five star."
"0","4","These reminded me of a truffle. They are good but deff not worth all the work. I will not make these again. They taste better when leaving them in the fridge."
"0","3","A pain in the butt to make...but they were pretty good...I doubt I will be making these again though just b/c the outcome was not worth the time it took to make them"
"0","5","AMAZING!"
"0","5","These were very good!! Just be sure to have the balls chilled before dipping in the chocolate or they will fall apart. I also found the easiest way to dip them was to simply use a fork. Don't bother with trying toothpicks - too time consuming. I will definitely make these again."
"0","5","My family went crazy for this dessert. I made some small changes which worked well. Refrigerated the cake/frosting mixture overnight, formed the balls and froze them for a minimum of one hour. This allowed me to dip them in the chocolate without fear of them falling apart. Used chocolate cake w/chocolate frosting, dipped in white and yellow cake w/white frosting dipped in chocolate. Gave as holiday gift treats."
"0","5","Sooooo good, and an easy recipe (takes some time, and kinda messy, but not difficult at all). I've only made them in all chocolate, but everyone loves them!!"
"0","4","I don't like them, but everyone goes crazy over them!"
"0","5","Superb! I loved those! I covered my cake balls with chocolate and coconut flakes for a great taste and a nice presentation. Thanks!"
"0","5","I made these for Christmas party and everyone loved them. Per other reviews, I used hand mixer to crumble cake. It worked well, pushing the bigger pieces to the top to hand crush. We thought they were better after a couple days in fridge. I used a small melon baller, and froze them a few hours before dipping. Great, simple recipe. Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","I made these to give to people around Christmas they turned out to be a huge hit. I used yellow cake mix with chocolate icing. I baked normal and then waited like 45ish minutes before stirring the icing in. I mixed it right in the pan which worked great for me. I put it in the fridge over night then made the balls the next day. Froze those for a bit then dipped them. It definitely made a lot- probably around 70.... but they are goooood."
"0","4","They are absoluetely delicious, but after looking at all of the pictures I dont understand why mine look nothing like that. Mine turn out really ugly like clump chocolate on the outside, I used almond bark which I dont like the taste of so much."
"0","5","Yummy, but time-consuming when you count the waiting time. I found it difficult to dip these no matter how long they had been frozen. I rolled them in toasted coconut, crushed toasted walnuts and powdered sugar (individually, not all on the same ball) and they were much easier and the family loved them!"
"0","1","In theory it sounds great, but the cake balls were too moist to stay together while being dipped, so refrigerating them for a while before hand would probably help."
"0","3","Not really worth the work. I found that it was impossible to make them look perfect(like a lot of the pics), which was very frustrating."
"0","4","I love this recipe. It's as simple as making a cake."
"0","5","wow unbelivable!!! Loved it... 10 stars"
"0","4","I wasn't overly impressed with the workability of the mixture. I followed the recipe to a T and the cake and frosting was very soft and gooey. We weren't able to dip them in chocolate, we ended up bathing them in chocolate while balancing them on a fork. Next time I will freeze the balls (as per another review) before attempting to dip them in the chocolate. Besides the difficulty dipping, everything went beautifully and they taste great. Thanks!"
"0","5","So simple and so good! I made these my 'rum balls' by adding raspberry liquor. Also, skipped the chocolate coating and rolled in powder sugar and also ground nuts."
"0","2","Didn't like these, took a long time to roll into all the little balls, and a long time to dip them in the chocolate. I found them way too sweet. Will not make again."
"0","5","great recipe. it was fast and simple to make. i made this for a church potluck and everyone, especially the kids loved them. I coated some with crushed candy cane.some with melted choc chips and sprinkles. some more grown up with choc and nuts. Lots of fun. Have imagination."
"0","4","Very rich, but easy to make and really good! Makes a lot."
"0","5","I love making these to give as favors at parties. They're a little time consuming and can be messy, especially if you're still trying to develop your technique like I am. They're great though because you can switch up the recipe and use any flavor cake mix/icing combo you like and decorate them according to your color choices."
"0","5","This recipe was very simple and worked out great for me. I couldnt find what all of the other reviewers were having problems with. :) i loved them and so did my wife and my coworkers. i think i may try a brownie rendition... 5stars"
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","Very good recipe! I used red velvet cake to make eyeballs for halloween. I also tinted some yellow cake mix to make green and made ghosts out of them."
"0","5","Delightful, kid-friendly, and endless combinations."
"0","4","Everybody I gave one to went on and on about how good they were...I wasnt crazy about them but that was just me!"
"0","5","Delicious and the options are endless!!"
"0","5","I give this 5 stars because of the taste and the dessert altogether.These cake balls came out perfectly, until the chocolate. I found it un-neccasary to let the cake cool completely. I waited only about 5 mins. until I mixed the icing. I made a red velvet cake and had to use a whole container of whipped cream cheese icing. I also didnt need to chill the mixture before forming it into balls. I didnt have a melon baller, but a tablespoon worked just as well. I made enough to fill one cookie sheet and put it in the fridge while the I formed the other ones. Then it was time for the chocolate. On other reviews I read that if you use chocolate chips, you have to add shortening. I didnt have shortening, so I used margarine. It seized up, so I used milk. That was a mess, so I microwaved it. It came out more like a glaze, which, I want too disappointed. I dipped them with little problems, other than not having enough glaze and put them back in the fridge. I was happy with the overall taste and didnt really care about the look. These were great, and I will be making another batch soon."
"0","3","These were very pretty. I had to put the cake and frosting in the fridg over night to get them to stay together well enough to dip. They look very pretty but are WAY too sweet to eat. Won't be making again."
"0","5","Easy and great tasting! I have tried several varieties, but so far my favorite is orange cake with vanilla frosting, dipped in chocolate. Yum!"
"0","4","I love how versatile these are! I make a lot of cakes so have scraps galore or whole cakes from trying a new recipe that 'just wasn't perfect'. These are the perfect solution! To make these adult desserts, try mixing flavored liquers in the icing. Kahlua (and a bit of coffee), Amaretto and Bailey's were my favorites. I used homade vanilla buttercream and vanilla cake, but store-bought would work just as well. Also, orange extract and a bit of orange coloring, or nutella (in choc cake) would be great. Cover in chocolate and YUM! They were a little squishier than i would have liked, but I just attribute that to my inexperience and probably overmixed or added too much of the wet ingredients."
"0","5","My husband loves these. I used Gluten Free Yellow Cake from the site (but made it strawberry with jello) to make the cake. I used Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from the site for the icing and I used Milk Chocolate Chips to dip it in! Yummy!"
"0","5","I love these. Taste like mini cupcakes. They are great for toddlers who make messes with cupcakes."
"0","4","I personally don't care for these too much, they taste really artificial (and I don't mind boxed cake and canned icing). But I'm giving 4 stars since most people seem to like them. If you're looking for something similiar to these in shape, I'd suggest the Oreo Truffles (I also use Reeses Peanut Butter Cups)...both are good, but very rich."
"0","5","these were sooo sooo sooo good! These were brought to school for a fiesta and everyone slaved over them! they were gone in like 10 min! they were the #1 hit there! great recipe!"
"0","3","What saved this recipe was the tedious dipping! Simple ingredients; however, I'm not sure I liked the balls because the texture was doughy. After dipping it into semi-sweet chocolate, it was OK. I haven't craved it since making it. I used strawberry, cream cheese frosting and melted chocolate. Will make it again if I get a desparate request from kids."
"0","5","Really Really Good!! Everyone raved about these. I used fudge cake, dark chocolate icing dipped in white almond bark...end result tasted like the oreos they put out at christmas time!!"
"0","5","This was an absolute HIT! I used German chocolate cake and then I used the Coconut Pecan frosting.... Dipped them in chocolate and topped off with Pecans.... TOTAL HIT! I am going to try red velvet next! :-)"
"0","5","Such a great little treat and the possibilities are endless. Already, I have made several different types for several different occasions. These are a real crowd pleaser. Read past reviews for some great tips!"
"0","5","I made about 4 different cakes worth of balls and had soooo many. They are so good and cheap!!"
"0","4","5 stars for taste, but 3 stars for the amount of effort and time these cake balls take. Also, can anyone think of a more creative name for these little things than 'cake balls' ??"
"0","5","I love these and they are so easy to make :)"
"0","4","Extremely tasty, but cumbersome to make. I had many difficulties dipping them, despite freezing the cake balls overnight before dipping. Could not get a thin covering of chocolate and used way more chocolate than the recipe states. Will make again if I can work up the inspiration to do them for special occasions."
"0","5","These are absolutely delicious! Very time consuming and messy, but the end result is worth it. I used cherry chip cake mix w/cherry frosting and chocolate covering. Do NOT use chocolate chips for the covering - way too thick! I used Bakers semi-sweet chocolate."
"0","5","I took one of the other reviewers suggestions and followed her idea of letting the cake cool for 30 minutes and then placing in the refrigerator to set. I was running out of time so instead of 3 hours in the fridge I put the cake in the freezer for an hour. An hour and a half would have been perfect. And then after rolling them I did put them in the freezer for another hour to set and them dipped them in chocolate. For this time I made Lemon Cake Balls and Red Velvet Cake balls. Very yummy! Just plan to spend quite a few hours."
"0","5","These are awesome! They were a bit time consuming but definitely worth it... and the combination's are endless. I ended up using carrot cake mix, cream cheese frosting, dipping them in white chocolate and then rolling them in crushed pecans and coconut. The end result looked like they were bought at an expensive candy shop. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!"
"0","4","What do I say about these...a cross between a truffle and a piece of cake? I couldn't really put my finger on it. It tasted faintly of cake mix. I absolutely hate canned frosting so I made my own cream cheese frosting and paired it with a devil's food cake which seemed to be a good combination. They turned out beautfully and I didn't find them to be THAT much work. I've made bigger messes with more mediocre treats. Would I make them again? Only if requested but I doubt that will happen."
"0","3","Made these for a cookout and nearly all of them were left. They were rather mushy but I made as directed. Not sure I will try again even with other review modifications."
"0","5","Great recipe and easy to make."
"0","1","More trouble than they are worth but if you are at a party and they are served and you like them, pay the hostess to make them for you."
"0","5","No one can get enough when I make these! There are endless combinations to satisfy everyone's personal tastes."
"0","5","Awesome recipe. Made for a party and not only did I not have any leftover, but everyone wanted the recipe. These are so simple, and the possibilities are endless. Will definately make again, and again and again! Thanks for the recipe"
"0","5","Yum, Yum! My husband is not a big fan of sweets, but I made these for his birthday dinner. He loved them. I used white cake mix and cream cheese frosting and dipped them in white chocolate and they turned out delicious. Be careful, they are addicting. I will definately make these again... they would be perfect for playgroup, bake sale or holiday get together"
"0","3","It sounded better than it was. Sad to say."
"0","5","Awesome recipe- I didn't change a thing and everyone raved."
"0","4","I give this recipe a four, primarily due to how it's supposed to work out (*laughing*), and biased only slightly by my recipe intervention... Ingenious, and surely a party-pleaser, I skipped the normal use for this recipe and hopped right on over to Earth Day Celebrations! Given my first time, I'm glad that I only made this for the kids I nanny for, and not a party. However, they didn't turn out a total trainwreck! Using an extra-moist cake mix, I baked it(of course), and totally ignored the frosting mixing into the ripped-apart-cake. Still luke-warm, and burning my palms slightly in the heat, I made the best spheres that I could - hey, I'm not artist - and shoved them in the fridge until I thought they were d decently firmed up. My 'frosting/glaze' is simply milk and powdered sugar, peppered with some dots of food coloring(blue for the water, green for the land). So, completely coat your little earths in the water(blue), and stick 'em in the freezer until they're not all melty and runny. I then found myself a little paintbrush(with bristles that weren't all falling out!!! - and dabbed some Picasso-esque land masses with the green. Repeat in the freezer, and then glaze with some wispy white glaze for the icecaps and clouds! Voila!!!"
"0","3","Used strawberry cake mix and vanilla frosting. I liked these but my son gave them 2 thumbs down. :("
"0","5","I made these for a party and everyone raved about them! They are time-consuming and I would have two people working on it to make it go faster, but other than that I think that this one is a keeper."
"0","3","It takes a lot of work...but it was alright. I think I may try it again someday."
"0","5","I actually just picked this recipe for some variety to add to my Christmas candy gifts, but it turned out to be one of the favorites. They were easy to make (even if they were a little messy) and fun to decorate. My four year old helped put on icing stripes, sprinkles, and candy buttons."
"0","5","These are great tasting and sooooo easy to make!!!"
"0","5","Heaven in your mouth. It has a very dough like consistency. No one can pass these treats up."
"0","5","Fantastic! I tried this recipe w/ Banana Cake and white chocolate....yum!"
"0","5","The best, easiest recipe-I bake often and am a little embarrased something so easy is such a crowd pleaser!"
"0","5","Very Addictive! Made it a few times now and came out perfect every time. Those who ended up with gooey mess - be patient! That's the key. Make the cake a night before and refrigirate then form balls and FREEZE for 2-3 hours. For more elaborate sprinkling, give chocolate 15-20 min to cool in a separarte dish (the dish you've melted it in might still be hot)this will allow you a better control. Also use real chocolate or morsels. Those jars that you stick in a microwave doesn't cover very smooth."
"0","3","Cake balls are definitely not a replacement for a homemade cake, but if you are used to the boxed variety then they would be an acceptable replacement. My 12 yr old son exclaimed 'awesome' when he popped the first one and was quickly crushed to find out that the rest were to be taken to a birthday party! I assured him I would make them again. I used only 3/4 c frosting in the first batch of yellow cake/fudge frosting. In the second batch of german choc/german choc frosting I ended up using the entire can because the cake wasn't as sweet on it's own. I used nestles semi sweet chips and shortening to coat. On the german choc balls, I only dipped half the ball and then rolled that end in chopped pecans. All in all they were worth the effort and look nice, but are no match for a real cake!"
"0","5","I used devil's food cake with whipped vanilla frosting. After I mixed it all together I was able to make the balls. I didn't have any problems maybe because I didn't add the whole container of frosting..just enough to bind it all together..probably about 3/4 of the container. I put one tray in the freezer while I was making more balls and started to melt the chocolate in my double boiler. I used 1 pk of milk chocolate chips, 1 pk of semi-sweet chips. I didn't think I would have enough chocolate so I added dark chocolate mint chips that I had on hand. I would put the whole ball in the chocolate and fish it out with a fork where I would tap it on the side of the pot to get the excessive chocolate off. Then I would use a toothpick to remove the ball from the fork and onto wax paper. It worked perfectly for me. I brought them to a bake sale at work and everyone loved them and was asking for the recipe."
"0","5","I made these this past weekend and they were outstanding! I made a Devil's Food cake with the cream cheese frosting and dipped in milk chocolate. These went FAST. One of my guy friends ate 12 within 5 minutes and would've eaten the rest if the other's hadn't gotten their hands on them. I will DEFINATELY make these again!"
"0","5","what a great idea. I made these over the weekend for a bake sale and I am still getting calls for the recipe. So simple yet so delicious. Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","I just made them tonight for my daughters 11th B-day party tomorrow. The 1-3 star reviews, your doing something wrong. They are the best!!!Thank you for posting the recipe"
"0","4","I made these for a baby shower and everyone thought they were store bought because they were soo soo pretty! I personally dont think they taste all that great but they definatley look great!"
"0","4","Much work, however, the end result is worth it. I did these little treats in stages, and that really seemed to help. Baked the cake the night before, and let it sit out (I used strawberry, a moist cake to start with)to dry out a little. The next morning, added frosting and mixed BY HAND (this really helped decide how much frosting to use), using just enough to hold it together. Froze the balls just like everyone recommended and dipped them in white chocolate and milk chocolate. You will have to warm up the chocolate more often than say for strawberries because the cake balls are so cold. I used a toothpick to remove from the chocolate, and covered the hole with the opposite chocolate in the drizzle on the top. Everyone at the party raved about them!!!"
"0","5","I made this recipe for my little sisters prom after-party. I got so many compliments. My fiance even requested that I make some more the next night for me and him. Great Recipe! Thanks!"
"0","4","This looked fun and easy enough, mine came out way too sweet and squishy. I also melted chocolate chips with a little bit of oil and it was too thick. I let the cake cool completly and used a whole can of frosting then put the balls in the fridge before dipping. I think next time I'll roll the balls when the cake is warm with less frosting and try freezing them before dipping."
"0","2","didn't work out too well for us, too sweet, gooey and messy."
"0","5","Really good, much easier to refrigerate cake balls before dipping in chocolate!"
"0","3","Very time consuming, but fun to make! Although, I think I'm going to give them all away (bring them to a gathering) and hope that someone will eat them all because they are way too sweet for my taste. Also, its very hard to get the coating on right so it looks pretty... or maybe I'm just too amateur :("
"0","3","Pretty good, nothing special. I used Devil's Food cake and vanilla frosting. Dipped the balls in melted white chocolate, sprinkled in green sugar and sprinkles for St. Patrick's Day. The dipping was most time consuming. I think baking a cake and frosting it is a better option for the amount of effort required."
"0","4","These are actually pretty good, if a little mushy. I used a little more than half a container of chocolate icing with a devil's food cake mix (which I baked as a healthy cake; egg whites, applesauce). I also refrigerated the mixture and then froze the balls for about an hour. I burned my fingers a few times while coating the balls, but that's pretty common in my kitchen! :p They were good, but a little bit too much work to warrent making them too often."
"0","5","This was a hit!!! I read the reviews and left the mix overnight in the fridge. It made it so much easier to roll into balls. Next time we're going to try different flavors. My wife love spice cake so I'm going to try that with cream cheese frosting."
"0","5","I can't wait to try. I need to know has anyone tried freezing the finished balls. I need to make ahead"
"0","3","I thought that these tasted awesome, however, I am rating a 3 based on time consumption and difficultness. I was okay until it was time to dip. Froze the balls, no problem, but dipping just was frustating and looked messy, unlike many of the pics attached. Not sure what would have made it easier. Not sure that I would make these again, just based on spending a huge part of my day on this."
"0","4","These taste so good! I used German chocolate cake mix with the matching frosting and white confectioner's coating. Wow! I've tried it with spice cake and cream cheese frosting too. I would like to know how to coat the balls evenly. It looks messy when I do it, but the taste is worth it."
"0","5","I rated this 5 stars because everyone that at them loved them! I thought they were too rich/sweet, but then who am I to argue with the masses! These were very easy to make; a definite kid-friendly treat~"
"0","4","These are very rich. I made them with Devils food cake, which made them a little too moist. I couldn't dip the balls into chocolate, so I had to drizzle the chocolate over the cake balls."
"0","5","These things are so addictive!!!! I took these to school and half of them didn't make it off the bus! I felt happy all day after that."
"0","5","This was easy using the original recipe. The taste of these is just something you can't describe - but must try!!"
"0","3","These are two sweet for me. Good, but far too rich."
"0","4","These tasted good and people were impressed by them, but they were a bit time consuming and messy to prepare. I did what other reviewers suggested and prepared the cake and cut off the ends. I only used 1/2-3/4 of a can of frosting and I used the whipped kind, and the amount seemed to be perfect. I also froze the cake balls before dipping them into the chocolate coating. The mashed up cake tasted wonderful on its own, and I think the chocolate coating made them a bit too sweet for me. I coated several balls and kept the rest frozen for another occasion. I used a spice cake/cream cheese with vanilla coating and a devil's food cake/buttercream with chocolate combination. I would make again for the people that love sweets."
"0","4","it turned out good.i gues it all depends on the cake and frosting you use.will definitely do it again with diff variations."
"0","3","I used a chocolate super moist boxed cake mix, vanilla frosting, and regular chocolate coating bark. It wasnt as sweet as I would have liked. Although I think I like my icings/treats more rich than most people it is just my opinion. In my second batch-i divided it into three out of the recipe-i added a 1/2 C of powdered sugar. That helped some. In my last i added peanut butter. It was harder to make the balls but everything is better with peanut butter."
"0","5","These are soooo much fun and really quite elegant! I used mint chocolate chips to dip them in and and sprinkled it with dark chocolate powder/powdered sugar....mmmmmmm!"
"0","4","Very good & very easy! Didn't need much frosting mixed with the cake crumbs."
"0","5","These are delicious. We've tried a few different kinds and love them all. Once we added peanut butter to the chocolate mix we coated the cake/frosting mixture in, and it was delicious."
"0","4","One container of frosting would have been too much. With half a container, it was heaven on earth. I used triple chocolate cake mix, cream cheese frosting, and dipped them in white chocolate. It makes a lot more than listed, but trust me-- they're gone pretty fast!"
"0","4","I used this recipe 3 times in 2 months. It's easy... a little work, but real easy. You can mix and match cake and frosting, white or chocolate bark. It's great and EVERYONE loves them. Can't eat too many in one sitting as they are really sweet, but that's just me. My brother ate about 6 or 7 at once."
"0","5","These are so good, but deathly sweet. I can only have one at a time!"
"0","5","Super easy to make. also a great recipe for little kids to help out with. I used a small melon baller to form the shapes!"
"0","5","These are great! I did chill the cake balls just a little before dipping. Will make again."
"0","5","My kids and I made these with spice cake and cream cheese frosting then dipped them in white chocolate. They were great and everyone gave them rave reviews."
"0","5","This is just so easy and so good! I ended up making two batches of this because we ate the first one so fast. I used the whole container of frosting and also found it helpful to freeze the balls before attempting to coat them in the chocolate. I used double fudge frosting with devil's food cake and it was really good. Then I used a yellow cake mix with coconut pecan frosting. That was good, but I don't think anything will beat the chocolate!"
"0","5","I used cherry chip cake mix with cherry frosting. They were great, but time consuming."
"0","5","I've made these twice now...very easy, doesn't take too long. Took some to a baby shower and they were devoured. Everyone loves these, and they look like you bought them from a bakery. I used german choc. with the pecan frosting, also used a pineapple cake with vanilla frosting that i added sweetened coconut to. I used the vanilla almond bark to coat those. Awesome. next time I want to make cherry flavored cake and frosting and add a marachino cherry in the middle!"
"0","5","I had no trouble with this recipe--just didn't add all the frosting--about half or little over of the can. It came out perfect. I broke the cake up into a stainless steel bowl, added frosting and used a stainless steel spoon to press & mix the frosting into the cake. Used a cookie scoop to form similar sized balls, rolled and put on wax paper. Froze for about 30 min and dipped into melted chocolate chips with a tbls or two of shortening to thin out. Everything worked perfectly and they are delicious! I used chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. YUMMY~!"
"0","5","This recipe is EXCELLENT. Very easy to make... jus a little time consuming. I agree with the readers who said you should freeze the cake balls before dipping them in the chocolate. If you don't you'll end up with a mess ( ok a yummy mess) but I don't think that's the look you're going for. Love this recipe!!!"
"0","5","This is my new favorite recipe! First I used it with carrot cake, cream cheese frosting and vanilla almond bark and that was very, very good. Then I used the recipe with German chocolate cake, coconut pecan frosting and chocolate almond bark. I am not a chocolate person, but that was out of this world. Everyone who has tasted these think they are wonderful. I took these to a meeting and even had a guy come up to me the next meeting weeks later to say how great they were. I love the versatiity of the recipe. One is only limited by his imagination. My most recent effort was with cherry chip cake with cherry icing stirred in (both Betty Crocker) and a half marachino cherry inside, then dipped in the vanilla almond bark. I also dipped the cherry chip cake mixture in chocolate icing, creating a 'chocolate covered cherry' confection. Thanks so much for this recipe!"
"0","4","Fun and easy"
"0","5","These were great. I used a orange cake mix with half a container of vanilla frosting and it was a big hit. Am going to try the German chocolate cake next."
"0","5","I make these every year at Christmas and they are such a HUGE hit. Often times I put some in cute tins and give out as presents."
"0","5","I'm giving this a 5 because my daughter LOVED making them and my husband actually enjoyed them!! They were super simple to make and my daughter took part in the entire process. The cleanup was the hardest part! I used white cake mix and used fluffy whipped vanilla frosting and I ended up using the entire can. I was not going to because of other reviews but since it was whipped, it needed it. I was aiming for just enough frosting to hold the cake together and it was perfect. I put the mixture into the fridge for about 1 hour and then proceeded to dip them into a ganache that I made! Wonderful recipe!"
"0","4","I made these with a white cake mix and coconut frosting, dipped in dark chocolate. They were ok, but not as good as I was hoping they would be. Maybe another flavor combination would be better."
"0","5","I SAW THIS RECIPE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SAVED IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT LOOKED INTERESTING AND THE INGREDIENTS WERE SIMPLE. AFTER GOING BACK AND FINDING THE RECIPE, I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE REVIEWS BUT DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY. EVERYONE JUST LOVED THEM!! I USED A CHOCOLATE BUTTER CAKE MIX AND MILK CHOCOLATE FROSTING AND MELTED SEMISWEET MORSELS. I DID FOLLOW SOME OTHERS ADVICE AND USE ONLY HALF THE FROSTING. MINE DID NOT TURN OUT GOOEY INSIDE LIKE OTHERS COMPLAINED OF. I HAD PLANNED ON FREEZING SOME OF THEM, BUT THEY WENT TOO FAST AND NEVER MADE IT TO THE FREEZER!! THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE AND I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY DIFFERENT CAKE MIXES AND FROSTINGS!!"
"0","3","I am giving this recipe 3 stars, simply because I gave it as gifts and everyone who received them loved them. However, they did not hold their shape well, and therefore were hard to dip, which resulted in a lot of covered mush. They tasted okay to me, not wonderful, so I don't know that I'll make them again. In short, time-consuming, and only okay."
"0","4","These taste great but are a real pain in the . I made them for my kids Christmas parties and I'm 100% sure I'll never do that again."
"0","5","This was a great recipe.Everyone loved them and it makes so many."
"0","5","These are fabulous!! I've done chocolate fudge cake with cream cheese frosting, coated with semi sweet chips, their like fudge truffles!!! I've also done white cake w/ coconut pecan frosing, and white choc coating. Yellow cake mix w/ choc and vanilla frosing mixed together dipped in chocolate. YUM, YUM!"
"0","4","These are great. They are time consuming, but worth it if you have the time. I found that refridgrating the cake mixture for a couple hours really made it a lot easier to work with."
"0","5","I used a lot less icing after reading other reviews. I didn't have any problems and the cake balls turned out beautiful... I didn't freeze or refrigerate either. If you aren't a fan of gooey goodies, I wouldn't try this one:)"
"0","5","Oh how addicting! I should have never even opened this recipe! A hit all around. I used devil's food cake with caramel frosting. Love them!"
"0","4","I was excited about making this recipe because it seemed very hands on. Also because I was spending the day in the kitchen anyway! It was a lot of work, but they came out looking fabulous. I used way more melted chocolate than it called for, and for the top of the ball I dripped white chocolate. They were good, but not excellent. They tasted like donuts! Next time I'll try a different cake flavor."
"0","5","These were a hit at both parties I took them to. I made one batch with strawberry cake and cream cheese frosting, with some dipped in white chocolate and some dipped in dark chocolate. I made another batch with yellow cake and chocolate frosting, dipped in milk chocolate. I let the cakes cool for about 20-30 minutes before crumbling. I used 1/2 to 2/3 of the can of frosting. I refrigerated the mixture for a couple of hours, then formed into balls and froze for another couple of hours. Turned out great."
"0","5","This recipe was great. A few things I found to be helpful, if you let the cake cool, you should use about 3/4 of the frosting. If you mix within 30 minutes of the cake coming out of the oven, only 1/2 can is needed. We rolled these into balls without putting them in the fridge first, then we froze the balls for at least 4 or 5 hours, overnight is best. These are a great versatile treat that you can change with the season. These are certianly going to continue to be an addition to all my seasonal treats. They are worth the extra work and were loved by all."
"0","5","I made these for a cookie exchange last weekend and they were really yummy!!! I had a hard time forming perfect ball shapes, so they were a bit lumpy looking and when I dipped them in the almond bark, crumbs would fall in the pan, causing the melted bark to become thick and hard to dip. But overall, it was super easy and very tasty! My bfriend loved them!"
"0","4","I've made these types of truffles before, but with homemade cake instead of the boxed kind, I prefer the texture of homemade cake, plus I hate making anything from a box, but these were delicious, easy, and will impress anyone who doesn't know how to bake. I used real milk chocolate for dipping and I think a whole can of frosting is two times too much. Next time I make these the cake and frosting will be from scratch because I actually enjoy putting forth the extra effort, the end product and feeling of achievement are worth it. But this is a great recipe for anyone without the time or know-how."
"0","4","These are very addictive. They are incredibly time-consuming, but they can be made to be pretty for a party. I used a red-velvet cake and mixed in some cream cheese frosting. My cake was very moist, I would recommend a more dense cake. I had some issue covering the cake balls with white chocolate. The chocolate did not melt very well in the microwave. I think this problem is alleviated by using the bark, but I am not sure. While the chocolate didn't melt well, the cake balls still tasted very good. Good served cold only."
"0","5","These weren't my favorite, but everyone else who ate them loved them! I made two different kinds: German Chocolate Cake using pecan frosting dipped in melted chocolate and White Cake with white/vanilla frosting dipped in white chocolate. The White Cake ones were the biggest hit. I recommend making the balls small... if not, after dipping they will be too large. Dipping them is the biggest challenge. Here's my suggestions: FREEZE the balls before trying to dip them. Only take a few out of the freezer at a time to dip; remove more as you are ready to dip. Insert a toothpick into each ball and then dip, leaving a small area around the toothpick uncovered. Let excess chocolate drip off as much as possible and place on waxed paper. Do NOT remove the toothpick until the cake has softened enough to remove the toothpick by gently twisting without touching the balls. After you remove the toothpicks, use a small spoon and drop a small amount of melted chocolate over the area that was not previously covered. You can make a little 'swirling' motion when you drip the chocolate ontop which makes it a bit 'fancier' looking. I tried to use my candy dipping tools but it was impossible since the frozen balls caused the chocolate to harden quickly and stick to the tools. It was a mess. I almost gave up totally until I hit on the individual toothpick method."
"0","5","Everyone who ate these LOVED them. Did chocolate cake/chocolate frosting, chocolate dip} White cake, green tinted frosting, mint extract, chocolate dip with mint extract} red velvet, cream cheese frosting, almond bark} The possibilities are endless and they make a lovely presentation. Thanks for sharing. Oh, don't forget to freeze balls before dipping and don't make them too big or they look like boulders. 1-1/4 inch balls were perfect and easy to handle. Freeze well after dipping also so you can make them ahead. Did I say I LOVED these balls?"
"0","5","This recipient was super easy! The trick is to go easy with the frosting and add to your cake mixture little by little until you get your desired consistency. Also, do refrigerate the cake balls untill chilled and roll them by hand after scooping them to get a nice 'truffle-like' look. I used Devil's Food with Whipped Chocolate Forsting. It was great. Everyone loved it. I'll try a different combo next time."
"0","5","I did everything as directed. Used strawberry cake with vanilla icing and milk chocolate and it tasted like a choc-covered strawberry. You could even used strawberry icing for an even richer taste. Excellent recipe."
"0","5","I made the red velvet cake and the chocolate covered strawberry versions so far, and have been getting requests ever since. Thank you!"
"0","5","I made these this Christmas and they were a huge hit! I had many requests for the recipie."
"0","5","Special for the holidays, I made these with red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting. (I only used about 3/4 of the icing as suggested and I did freeze them about 30 minutes before coating in the melted chocolate.) Half of them, I covered in white chocolate that I made red with a few drops of food coloring. The other half, I dipped in milk chocolate bark. I used a toothpick to do this and so I used crushed candy canes to conceal the toothpick holes I created. They were a HUGE hit!"
"0","5","I have given this recipe out 10 times since the 17th of December. I made a batch for a christmas party and a Batch for christmas eve and for presents. It was amazing. I bought mini cupcake holders red tissue paper and small tins and it made the perfect gift. I did Red velvet cake with Cream cheese frosting dipped in Hersheys milk chocolate chips and Devils food cake with Milk chocolate frosting dipped in Hersheys white chocolate chips. I topped them each with either Red and green sprinkles or Colored sugar. they were excellent"
"0","5","These were a total hit at a party I catered...I used many different flavors of cake and icing, and even though they were time consuming, they werent terribly difficult...the melon baller was useless, but using my hands was easy. I made hundreds of these and instead of using the almond bark, I used rasta colored candy melts--they were so colorful on the table and finished off beautifully with coordinating sprinkles. Got way too many good comments to count..."
"0","5","easy to make, tastes great, both work and family loved it."
"0","3","As written this rates about a 3. I froze them and dipped them in the almond bark. But truthfully these don't appeal to my palette. Mediocre in taste although the presentation was pretty. Almost tasted like a donut and that's not what I was looking for. Thanks for sharing the idea though. I do love to experiment."
"0","5","YUM! I followed the directions and used some advice from other reviews...Crumbled the cake when it was still slightly warm, added 3/4 can of frosting. Formed into balls, froze them and then dipped in chocolate. This worked well. It was messy and a little time consuming but well worth it. My favorite combo was carrot cake and cream cheese frosting with white chocolate coating, rolled in walnuts. YUM! I used white chocolate chips, not bark or melting chocolate and it worked fine. Also freezing the balls on the cookie sheet and then dipping them and placing them back on the cookie sheet when it was still cold allowed them to set very quickly which was very convenient."
"0","4","EDIT: I just finished these and they look very cute - however I used too much frosting and mine taste a bit gooey/undone, but still yummy. think of them as creamy truffle-like treats. If you are using an electric mixer to cream the cake and frosting together, it helps to spray the whisks with a little cooking spray to avoid build-up. I experimented and made one batch with the 30 minute cool-off period, and another batch straight out of the oven, and I find that it's easier to mix when the cake is still hot, but it DOES yield a 'gooier' batter.   NOTE: if you're using chocolate chips to coat these, you'll need to add shortening OR butter to liquify the chocolate enough. I noticed a lot of people were complaining about this step and thought it should be mentioned!"
"0","5","Very good recipe, almost like a truffle type treat. Everyone asked for the recipe. The kids had a great time experimenting with different types of toppings. The options are limitless! Our favorite cake/frosting combo by far was Dark chocolate cake mix with a chocolate fudge frosting.... SOOOOO GOOOD!!!!"
"0","5","Yummy, easy, but looks impressive. Don't add food coloring to the almond bark, that doesn't work! I learned it the hard way. I also took others advice to freeze before dipping, it worked great."
"0","5","Oh Fantabulous!!!!Followed the advice of others and froze first before dipping in chocolate. I used WAY more than 3oz of chocolate for the coating. Also didn't use the chocolate bark stuff (didn't want a waxy aftertaste), so I used the bakers dipping chocolate. Super Easy and soooooo Good. My 5 and 3 year old have already told me they want cake balls in place of a regular cake for their upcoming birthdays. Two thumbs up!"
"0","3","I only had 'okay' results with this recipe. I had the best result with rolling the cakes balls into rather small balls - the texture was a real turn off when I made the balls bigger than large marble size. It's a good recipe but I would have to tweak it to give it a better score."
"0","4","I used red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting, and vanilla almond bark. Very tasty, but difficult to make. Make sure to let cake cool for at least 30 minutes. Then mix in frosting and refrigerate for about 3 hours. Then form into balls using cookie scoop. Place on cookie sheet lined with wax paper and place in freezer for about an hour. Then dip into melted almond bark. If they aren't frozen, they will fall apart in the almond bark."
"0","5","These are really great and simple! I made one batch with an orange cake mix and cream cheese frosting dipped in chocolate! Soooo good! I do wish I could have found an orange frosting to make them a little more orange flavored. Then I made a chocolate with chocolate frosting dipped in chocolate. I also added a few chocolate chips in the cake mixture just before it cooled so they would keep their shape, then rolled in coconut and dipped in chocolate! YUM!"
"0","4","the recipe i have is, after u mix cake with frosting,freeze it for about 1/2 hour to 2 hours. this makes it easier for the balls to stay together. then make your balls and freeze again for about 2-3 hours. this really helps in keeping the balls together. then i stick toothpics in all of the balls, and then dip them into chocolate. i found parafin (gulf wax) in the chocolate helps the chocolate stick better AND give chocolate a beautiful gloss. i remove the toothpics after the balls have hardened"
"0","5","This recipe was great. For the most part it was very easy to make. I am not a good chocolate dipper so I just drizzled the chocolate and it looked much better and was easy. I recieved lots of compliments and they disappeared at our buffet."
"0","5","Wonderful ! love this recipe, Its gonna come in handy year round. I used a cherry chip cake and vanilla frosting. I made the little balls and put them into the fridge for about 45 minutes before dipping them in the chocolate, this helped to keep them together. It was easy and oh so yummy. Thank you so much"
"0","5","awesome!!"
"0","3","While I agree that this recipe could be great, it just wasn't for me. I used a lemon cake mix with lemon frosting and a small cookie scoop for uniformity. I chilled them after scooping and used white candy melts. The cake left a lot of crumbs in the candy melts and was so hard to roll around that I didn't think this was worth the effort."
"0","5","Make some last night with a boxed strawberry cake mix that has lived in the pantry forever... Cake failed to rise but tastes great as cake balls (chocolate icing w/ almond bark covering)!"
"0","4","These are delicious, but not as easy to make as I hoped. Also, mine were pretty ugly. I had no luck w/ the toothpick and ended up just spooning the melted bark over the balls. Also I had to roll the balls by hand which is messy. They look like brown clumps but taste delightful. I do, unlike others, think they need the whole can of frosting. Beware, I did chocolate cake, frosting, and bark and they are soooo rich. I think the right combo would be worth of 5 stars but the all chocolate one I tried is just cocolate overkill. I'll opt for yellow cake or something different next time. Also, if you want them as pretty as some of the pictures it is going to take some patience."
"0","4","I love this recipe. Next time I will make sure they are smaller. I made mine, a little too much cake for the chocolate, senario. I used devil's food cake and chocolate lover's with chips in it. MMMMM! I also refrigerated them before making them into balls, only because I had to leave to go to work. I would suggest making them into balls first. Them freeze them as others said."
"0","5","I took the advice of a previous reviewer and let the cake mix sit in the fridge overnight. You can not make these balls warm or room temp, they fall apart. If cold though, they turn on beautiful.  VERY SWEET"
"0","3","What did i do wrong. I used a red velvet with cream cheese frosting. I froze the balls as other viewers suggested because it was messy making the balls. When I tried to cover them in white chocolate it just made a crummy mixture of chocolate and the balls were frozen over night. the taste was not all that my husband even said not sure about it I would like to try again but need advice on covering in chocolate. next time i will use a different flavor cake."
"0","5","These are wonderful, a little time consuming but well worth all of it. So many combinations you can try."
"0","5","This is an awesome recipe!! Even if you don't decorate them they still come out looking nice. You can use a melon-baller to make bite-size balls or a small cookie scoop to make larger balls. Either way, they are really good and a hit."
"0","5","OMG! You have no idea how ridiculously easy and GOOD this is. I did the chocolate cake and tripe fudge frosting..and they taste like ding dongs.. SOOO GOOD. I honestly thought how can these possibly be good by reading the recipe..boy was I wrong..you will not regret making this one. I just wish Id made it a long time ago! Everyone whos tried it feels the same after getting the recipe. The response is basically whats in this? NO?! really?"
"0","3","These were just ok. I used strawberry cake and french vanilla icing. I tasted the 'batter' after I mixed the cake and the icing together, and it was fantastic. After chilling and dipping in chocolate, they weren't so good anymore. Not even my 4-year old liked them. Due to all the good reviews, I will still include them in my cookie gift bags for Christmas. Hopefully other people will like them more than I did."
"0","3","Yikes! The holidays are crazy enough as it is, and these little babies just made things worse! However in all fairness after reading the many reviews I did decide I was going to use some really 'good' chocolate and temper it myself, none of this almond bark stuff!....big mistake. After the whole tempering fiasco I gave in and bought some dipping chocolate at Michael's. This did work really well and produced good results. However, chocolate aside, I still found the cake mixture very difficult to work with. It has to be very firm, almost frozen, in order for it to not fall off the toothpick when dipping. Then once it's placed on the wax paper the toothpick will inevitably take some cake & chocolate with it when it comes out, so I kept a spoon in the dipping pot and just drizzled a little extra on top of each one. The end result was a nice firm chocolate shell with a soft lucious inside. However the taste I found to be just okay. Unfortunately I just don't think these are worth the hassle."
"0","4","This was pretty good - I just made a bunch to give away as holiday presents. I would suggest that anyone interested in trying this use a fairly dense cake - I made a devil's food/chocolate frosting batch and a spice cake/cream cheese frosting batch, and the spice cake combo was a bit tough to hold together.   Either way, they came out really well. Will definitely make these again. Super easy, and with a little practice the finished product looks very impressive."
"0","5","Time consuming but delicious. I refrigerated the cake/icing overnight before rolling into balls."
"0","5","I made this for my kids' classes at school and everyone loved it and asked for more! I agree with the other reviewers that you need to refrigerate your cake mixture before rolling into balls then freeze balls before dipping-this makes this recipe very easy!"
"0","5","I made spice cake with vanilla coating, and lemon cake with vanilla coating. The turned out great. I did freeze the balls for an hour or so before dipping. I had a hard time with the vanilla chips melting and being way to thick so I added a spoon full of shortening, worked like a charm!"
"0","4","4 stars, since I would give 3 and my husband would give 5.  I used white cake and before dipping in white chocolate I tested one and it reminded me of eating the cake 'skin' left on the bottom of the board/pan when you lift off a slice of cake. I froze them before dipping and that worked well (although dipping anything in chocolate is always a pain, in my opinion) They also set up quick from being frozen and then set back on the cold/frozen pan. My husband declared that none of these were leaving the house on a cookie tray--he wants them all for himself (lol) so I am guessing I will be making them again.  Once chocolate covered they are pretty good. This is one of those recipes you'll just have to try for yourself."
"0","4","Super great- so easy to make and look so impressive when you are done with the task. Quite rich, but a big hit!"
"0","4","I tried a few different ones. The one that turned out the best were the german chocolate cake one. They weren't as soggy more like cake. I will make those again!"
"0","3","I made this with strawberry cake mix and vanilla frosting dipped in milk chocolate. This was way too rich. I generally don't meet a sweet I don't like, but this was just so so for me. Maybe it was just the type of cake combo I used."
"0","4","Good, a little tough to make. I refrigerated the cake mixture before rolling into balls. Also used my ganache recipe to coat and then froze."
"0","5","These were great! I made two different kinds - strawberry (strawberry cake mix and strawberry frosting, coated with semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprinkled with red decorating sugar) and German Chocolate (German Chocolate cake with caramel coconut pecan frosting, coated with milk chocolate chips and drizzled melted caramel). They were the hit of the party!"
"0","4","This is a great recipe that I cannot stop making in effort to perfect. The issue I have is trying to dip the balls to get a nice smooth, not to thick coating. Great, versatile recipe!"
"0","5","I was going to give this a 2 star at first, since I used a 'yellow cake mix' when I just used the Cake Mix from Scratch recipe from this site (thank god for that recipe) So it just made it chocolate cake, which was okay, but I had problems with the crust, which turned out to give it a slight crunch, had to stop the mixing once a while just to beat the crumbs into small pieces, I was kinda meh about this recipe BUT once I covered it in chocolate, it was so good. Will be making this again"
"0","4","These were not as good as I was hoping. Maybe it was my cake and frosting choice...I used what I had on hand (yellow cake with chocolate frosting) and it was nothing outstanding. A whole container of frosting is WAY too much. I used 3/4 and still thought it was too much. I baked the cake, mixed it with frosting, formed the balls, froze them overnight and then dipped them in the chocolate. I'll try them one more time with a more exciting cake and frosting combination."
"0","5","So good! Favorite combo so far is the red velvet and cream cheese frosting with white chocolate coating and a few pecan pieces on the top - but that is tied with strawberry cake with lemon icing, white chocolate coating and sprinkles on top (three-year-old loves these!) I used two forks to dip these, letting excess coating drip before setting on wax paper."
"0","5","Yummy Yum Yum! These were really good, my husband made himself sick from eating so many of them! You only need about 1/2 or 2/3 tub of icing...too much makes them squishy. Freezing before dipping is good, just be prepared to work FAST! The chocolate hardens quick and if you're putting srinkles on, it helps to have a co-baker on hand. I used melted chocolate chips...I still can't find whatever almond bark is. Every grocery store I tried didn't have any so I had to improvise. I melted white chocolate and swirled it on the tops....they looked so cute!"
"0","5","I made these last week, and my family and friends flipped for them! I made mine with German chocolate cake mix, chocolate frosting and chocolate coating. I added a little caramel drizzle to the top and they look more like bonbons. There are so many endless combinations, and I'm excited to try them all!"
"0","5","I was planning on making a regular cake from 'scratch' but the cake totally fell apart when I tried to take it out...so I let the cake cool for quite a few hours and then made a ruch chocolate orange frosting. I did freeze the balls for about ten minutes before dipping. They tasted wonderful with white chocolate and coconut."
"0","4","Really easy, really messy but worth it. Everyone likes these and they are cheap to make! A keeper"
"0","4","Great idea! I made it with strawberry cake mix and (highly recommmended)cream cheese icing. I wasn't so satisfied with the chocolate portion. First, I melted a whole bag of milk chocolate chips, but they were too thick. The chocolate overpowered the cake balls when dipped. I tried that 'candiquik' for the first time and it didn't melt correctly in the microwave. So, I finally did the research melted the chocolate chips again, but mixed about the same amount of shortening with it. It thinned it out perfectly! Only problem is that they're a tad oily after setting. Maybe I'll use less shortening next time."
"0","3","The recipe was really easy to make but I found it rather difficult to get the cake balls to stay on while I was dipping them in the chocolate. So I ended up freezing them, then dipped them, and put them back in the freezer. My friends like them better frozen!"
"0","5","Follow others' advice! freezing the cake balls before dipping makes this so much easier. I made it with white cake/lemon frosting, and a white chocolate coating. I then topped the cake balls with crushed almonds, crushed pecans, toasted coconut, and some with just sprinkles. Sweet & yummy. I think i may have eaten have of the cake/icing mixture before it made it to the coating!"
"0","1","I could not make the balls, the recipe did not work for me. Don't know what I did wrong, consider revising the directions please."
"0","5","These were great,and pretty. I used Duncan Hines Red velvet cake mix with cream cheese frosting and dipped in white chocolate.Very pleased. I also did some white cake mix with vanilla frosting,dipped lightly in vanilla almond bark and rolled in coconut. Will make more of these."
"0","4","i made these as a trial.. they turned out great.. i baked a chocolate cake and vanilla cake.. used half of both.. left rest for kids to eat.. crumbled the halfs.. then added vanilla frosting..dipped them in dark chocolate..i used a review advice..put them in fridge over night.in freezer.then dipped in chocolate.my guests liked them.thank u for this lovely recipe..Rana"
"0","4","Easy to follow. Thanks for all the helpful tips. I would definitely recommend keepoing your hands moist when forming the balls. I re-wet my hands every 4-5th ball."
"0","5","I made a cake that completely crumbles so we saved it by using this recipe. My whole family loved them. They didn't even last long enough to freeze any for later."
"0","4","These were really messy, but they were good. I will leave this to someone else to make."
"0","3","i made this before, and it was a huge mess! lol They were good just very funny looking!"
"0","5","These are a hit. I used strawberry cake, french vanilla frosting and melted chocolate chips for the dipping. A little work but well worth it."
"0","5","These are so good! They really take some effort to make, but they're worth it! They are very much like Petit Fours. I used white cake mix, lemon frosting, and vanilla almond bark. I made them for a Halloween party and called them candied eyeballs. They were a huge hit. Will be making them for Christmas!"
"0","4","I substituted 8 ounces of softened cream cheese for the frosting so the taste wasn't my favorite, but everyone else loved them and wanted more. I used a white cake and dipped them in melted milk chocolate and dark chocolate."
"0","3","These were pretty and tasted okay but i will never make them again. I froze the balls as suggested by others but once they hit the melted chocolate they instantly started to melt. I used red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting dipped in white chocolate and had quite a red and white mess! It took forever to get them to look okay. I much prefer the cookie balls from this site for taste, texture and ease in making."
"0","5","I'm giving this 5 stars because people were gobbling them up. They loved them! I actually didn't care for them too much, but I guess everyone else did. They were a huge hit!"
"0","4","Well, we didn't let the cake set so they were super gooey. Good, but could be better if the insides were a little less dense."
"0","4","Very rich! These are like super moist and rich decadent donut holes! Very easy to make, I actually forgot the recipe at home but mom and I just winged it. We used both white and chocolate coating for the outside, and I think the plain chocolate is much better. We only let them cool in the fridge for 1/2 hour before forming balls, then another 1/2 hour or so before dipping. They could have chilled/froze longer, but it worked fine and none fell apart until the very last one. I usually have a huge sweet tooth and have no problem eating sweets, but these were too sweet and rich to consume a lot, maybe 1 or 2 and stick a fork in me! My dad, who normally isn't big on sweets, absolutely LOVES them, he can't stop eating them! I can't wait to try different variations!"
"0","5","Everyone loved these! I have made them twice. Once with strawberry cake and icing dipped in dark chocolate. Then with funfetti cake, cream cheese icing, dipped in white almond bark. YUM!! They freeze well too."
"0","5","These tasted so good and were a lot easier to make then I had imagined. The freezing step really did the trick, I think. I did yellow cake with chocolate frosting and then dipped some in milk chocolate and some in dark chocolate. I used the Baker's Dippers bowls of chocolate you can buy at the grocery store (baking aisle), and needed 2 bowls to cover the whole batch. I topped the finished balls with sprinkles to add a little pizzaz. They were a big hit at my goddaughter's 17th birthday party."
"0","5","Can't even begin to say how good these were!!! I'm always looking for something different to 'wow' my family, and these cake balls definitely fit the bill!! I used yellow cake and chocolate icing, which is our favorite, but we spent the whole evening discussing different combinations that we want to try!!"
"0","4","I used coconut cake and white icing. I used the entire can of icing and added some shredded coconut. As others suggested, I froze the balls for a couple of hours before dipping, then rolling in more coconut, then storing in the fridge. I made these for my husband for his birthday and he loved them. To us, they are really more like candy than a cake. Very good and pretty easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","As is, I gave it a 4. I cooled my cake for awhile instead of mixing it with the frosting while it's still warm. I didn't want it to get mushy. I also froze the balls before I dipped them and then I froze them again after dipping. They turned out great - we call them Cake Truffles in our house!"
"0","5","awesome recipe...i've been making these since last year! the best thing about them is the versatility of mixing and matching that can be done (choc cake/choc frosting/choc chips, red velvet cake/cream cheese frosting/white choc chips, yellow cake/vanilla frosting/choc chips...it's endless!) thank you so much for this awesome way to serve cake!"
"0","3","Not sure what I did wrong, but my ball wouldn't hold together. Tasty but crumbly."
"0","5","Made these last night for work and they were gone before the end of the day. Thanks to everyone for their great suggestions- as I found it easier to mold the cake into balls once it was frozen. Then I placed them in the freezer for about an hour before coating them with chocolate. Also, I found that using half of the frosting container was more than plenty so be aware of that when adding the frosting to the cake. They were delicious and moist, Devil’s Food Cake with chocolate fudge frosting and chocolate coating. Can’t wait to make these again but will make sure I have plenty of time before taking on the project. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","4","I made these for the first time exactly as written to take on a trip with me and did not like them at all. I thought they were way too sweet, sickeningly sweet if you ask me. I almost threw them all away because I thought no one would eat them...then I decided to take them with me anyway, and to my surprise most people thought they were delicious. Out of a house of 12 people, 10 raved about them and even asked me for the recipe. I made a huge batch that was supposed to last the week and they did not even last more than a few hours! I will definitely be making these again to bring to parties, but not for myself to keep around the house. FYI - I had a hard time with the chocolate coating, even after freezing the cake balls for about 30 mins, so instead of completely dipping each cake ball and I layed them out on a cookie sheet and drizzled melted milk and white chocolate over them, then sprinkled my toppings on by hand. I cooled them and then flipped all of the cake balls over and repeated the drizzling and sprinkling on the other sides. They had less chocolate coating that way and they turned out looking very pretty. I served them in individual mini-cupcake wrappers. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","these are amazing and addicting. i roll mine in coconut and pecans. though i am very inconsistent with what size i make them and whether or not i completely dip them in chocolate, the taste is always fabulous."
"0","5","I have made this several times and always get rave reviews!! They think a professional did them (which I find most flattering since I am SO NOT :-)) and comment on how addictive they are!! Definitely follow previous reviews on freezing before dipping! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","These are very good. Yes I will make them again.I had to use 1 1/2 choclate bark to cover them.Everyone really like them very much."
"0","4","i didnt have everything it called for made my own frosting and made my own dip  pretty good wanted them to be more donut-hole like but still good  dipped mine in variety glaze chocolate sprinkles sugar jam so everyone can get one they like  i want to try making marble ones like in the picture  definitly a messy recipe but i dont mind that  i dont recommend if you dont like a mess"
"0","4","made these using red velvet, cream cheese frosting and hard chocolate glaze from this site---didn't have the choco almond bark on hand. i wasn't a huge fan b/c i felt that they were too mushy, but everyone else seem to like it, especially the kids. also, i prefer it eat these cold."
"0","5","Great idea and recipe. I've made these twice, once with a white cake mix and pistacho (sp?) pudding for a green cake and white coating, the next with cherry chip cake, white frosting, mini chocolate chips and white coating. I found that when I left the crust from the cake out of the cake ball mixture (so you didn't have the brown bits in it), you had to decrease your frosting, otherwise you didn't have the same cake like consistency. Love the idea and will be making again."
"0","5","Talk about crazy good! I've made two batches on these so far; One lemon/cream cheese and one white/blackberry buttercream. They were both so good and so rich, the plates were totally devoured! This is going to the top of my party food list!"
"0","4","Made these for Christmas. Everyone loved them and they freezed extremely well. Only trouble was assembly and decorating/dipping. It was extremely messy and time consuming. Any tips on how to speed up/simplify this process, because I would love to make them again."
"0","5","OMG these are to die for. I love them. I used dark choc. cake, van. frosting, and choc. almond bark. 1/2 of my balls did not receive chocolate outer coating due to the fact that I ran out of chocolate bark but for these ones I kept in the freezer and OMG they were amazing without it even. Thanks."
"0","5","Followed some reviewers' suggestions. I was in a hurry, so made cupcakes instead, and placed all the cupcakes in a gallon ziplock back, crumbled it and put it in the freezer while I cleaned up kitchen. Then used the 8 oz cream cheese, one cup powdered sugar, tsp of vanilla as suggested by one reviewer (since I didn't have any frosting, and love cream cheese and don't really love premade frosting) and mixed it all up. As I formed the balls, I placed them on a plate, and I placed that plate in the freezer. Melted my coating in a coffee mug, and rolled cold balls into the coffee mug, placed on waxed paper. Melted some chocolate chips in a ziplock baggie and drizzled on top white-coated balls. I can't eat them, but the neighbors and family really liked them and asked me to leave the three leftover balls. Left some of them frozen in the freezer and I'll coat them for a special treat sometime. Seems like they'd be a good thing to have on hand for a quick dessert. Took quite a bit of coating chocolate to do all those balls. Looked yummy."
"0","4","This is a great recipe. They are hard to master though. My first batch did not come out very smooth looking. After following other reviews going to try them again but this time use a cookie scoop and egg seperator to dip them. They sure taste good though!"
"0","4","I made these in an egg shape for Easter and they came out really nice. They are sort of truffle-like...very moist inside and hard outside. I used devil's food cake and chocolate frosting with semi-sweet chocolate to coat them. I split the mixture and added some peanut butter to part of it (yum!) and some mint extract to the other part (YUM!). I must say they were an awful lot of work and the only time I might ever use this recipe again is if I ever have a cake disaster and need a way to use crumbled cake. Otherwise I don't think it's worth all the time and trouble."

"0","5","Super fun! We did the red velvet cake for Valentines day!"
"0","5","These are great.. I made them this year for Christmas.. I used the red velvet cake and vanilla frosting.. Then dipped them in the white chocolate and let my kids sprinkle them with red and green sugar sprinkles.. Everyone loved them.."
"0","5","So many easy variations. Fun and Easy!!! I often make a batch and after I make the balls I freeze them on a cookie sheet. Once frozen I put them in a baggie. That way I can make them fresh whenever I'm ready! Some flavors that worked great, Banana cake and cream cheese frosting, choc cake choc frosting and mint extract, strawberry cake cream cheese or vanilla frosting, german choc and pecan coconut frosting, red velvet with cream cheese frosting. I have tried many more as well, and nothing has been bad! The egg seperator from pampered chef does work great for dipping!"
"0","3","These sounded so good and looked so pretty in the picture----but they were very messy to make and mine did not hold together well for dipping----even after chilling. Too messy to try again but since the majority of posters had success, maybe it was my technique"
"0","5","AWESOME! WE love these and have made them many times now! Very easy..I must suggest putting them in the refrigerator after making them into balls for about an hour. Then dip into Chocolate. My husband is a firefighter and he took some to the station! They were gone in 5 minutes! They requested more!"
"0","4","These taste amazing. I loved the strawberry cake with butter cream frosting and white bark outside. YUMMY! Very sweet, but yummy!  I am having issues with how much bark to use. Recipe says 3 oz. I have already used 1 lb and still have half the cake balls to cover. Mine taste good, but don't look pretty."
"0","5","Great. My kids and I made these for christmas, everyone thought we worked very hard!!!! It was too easy. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","4","These are waaay rich, but I suppose that's a give-in when you are making something called a cake ball. :) I used white cake and chocolate frosting, since that's all I had on hand. I used chocolate almond bark and then drizzled white chocolate on top. I added peppermint extract and green food coloring to some of the white chocolate, which was very pretty and had a nice subtle mint flavor. Not something I would eat all the time, but nice for the holidays."
"0","5","I made these for a tea party and used a home-made chocolate frosting. Literally everyone wanted to know the recipe! I dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate. They are great fro something like like a baby or bridal shower."
"0","4","I made a couple different kinds, and they are very good, but very time consuming. They reminded me a lot of truffles which is definitely a plus."
"0","5","Wow - This can be very addictive."
"0","3","These were good...but I was unable to dip them right after making them. Freezing them before dipping worked some of the time, but they still fell apart. I probably wouldn't make them again."
"0","4","Although easy enough to make, these balls are very time consuming. The first time I made these balls was a nightmare as I didn't freeze the balls. Make sure to freeze the balls prior to dipping in chocolate or else the balls will break apart while dipping and your left with a big mess. These balls are very yummy and you can make so many variations to suite everyones tastebuds...just make sure to freeze first lol."
"0","5","i just made these for my first Christmas party (huge success) and everyone was very impressed with these. They are incredible with a cup of coffee or espresso. This is a slightly labor intensive recipe, but it really helps break it up to refrigerate the mix overnight or so. I used 3 6oz cups of the microwaveable dipping chocolate to dip the balls in which was easy and delicious! it helped minimize clean-up. This is a rich and elegant recipe with endless creative avenues. I will definitely be making these again."
"0","5","My neighbor and I just made these yesterday. They are amazing. We created our own mixture for the holidays. We made a devils food chocolate cake mix and crumbled it. Then, we added 1 and 1/2 jars of chopped marchinio cherries, about 1 Tablespoon of marchinio cherry juice, and 1 container of vanilla frosting. Once everything was mixed together, we chilled for about 1/2 hour. We used the pampered chef cookie scoop (small) and put them on a pan. Then we froze them before dipping. Outstanding. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","Made with chocolate cake and chocolate icing and then dipped in white almond bark. My husband and kids didn't like them and i thought they were ok, but I brought them to a bake sale and they were sold out in 20 minutes. Was asked for the recipe the next day so I guess it really depends on your taste. Much better than the fudgy truffle recipes."
"0","5","Why didn't i know about these sooner? Makes a ton, extreamly simple, and so good. Everyone at work loves them and I am sure that they'll be a hit at my cookie exchange."
"0","5","I made this recipe once and passed them around. Everyone loved them, especially the chocolate lovers. Needless to say I'm a victim of my own success, because I have been asked to make this recipe about 6 different times these holidays. The dipping in the chocolate step might take doing it a few times to get it right, but once you get the feel for them you can whip these out with ease. Great sweet snack"
"0","5","This recipe was a wonderful addition to my annual assortment of christmas candies. I used a red velvet cake and vanilla frosting. This year it's what everyone is asking for. Also very easy."
"0","5","This was an excellent recipe. I used cherry chip cake mix and cream cheese frosting. I used a small ice cream scoop to form the balls and placed them on a cookie sheet, covered them and put them in the freezer for about an hour. Then I rolled them in my hands to prevent crumbling when dipped in the chocolate. They tasted like cherry cordials. Yummy!"
"0","5","I came across this recipe about 4 years ago and it has become a holiday favorite. Don't be afraid to experiment with flavors....recently made fudge cake, mixed in peppermint chips and fudge frosting. Dipped in dark chocolate - yum. Also a big hit is lemon cake mixed in white chocolate chips and lemon frosting, dipped in white chocolate. Be creative and follow your taste buds!"
"0","5","This is one of the easiest recipes ever! The kids LOVED them - they look great - they taste awesome and I'm excited to serve them at my Christmas dessert buffet."
"0","5","I just made this recipe today, and it is amazing!!! I will be including them in my holiday cookie tray. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","5","Fantastic recipe!! I've made these a couple of times now, and everyone marvels. The taste is good, they're always moist, and if you take your time, they look incredible. I will admit... a little tedious. There's alot of rolling, dipping and drizzling that goes on."
"0","5","THESE ARE THE BEST!! YUMMY, YUMMY!"
"0","5","I tried these at a party and wanted to recreate them at home. This was the perfect recipe. I used vanilla cake/cream cheese frosting and vanilla almond bark. I rolled some in coconut. Delicious! Definitely use some vegetable oil to thin the almond bark. I can't wait to try other cake mixes/frostings!"
"0","3","My kids ate them, but I didn't care for them. Wouldn't make again-sorry!"
"0","4","These were pretty good, but quite messy and a lot of work. My husband liked them though. They reminded him of those little debbie snack cakes."
