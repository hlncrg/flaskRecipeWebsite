"1401","5","These cookies taste great when made just the way the recipe is written.  But, if you're like me and your cookies always turn out flat, here's how to make these cookies turn out taller, just like the ones in the picture. First, turn the oven temp down about 10 degrees. Second, don't soften the butter before mixing, just cut it into 1 tbsp pieces and mix with the sugar. Third, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the dough. Finally, once you've filled the thumbprints with jam, put the whole cookie sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. The first time I followed the recipe and my cookies were so flat the jam leaked through the bottom, and the second time I made these adjustments and the cookies not only tasted delicious, they looked perfect, too!"
"439","5","I think I figured out why some people have trouble with this recipe. Made one batch, followed recipe exactly. They turned out great. Made another, but decided to substitute vanilla for the almond extract. BIG MISTAKE! They turned out flat as a pancake, so I'm attributing the cause to the switch in the extracts because I made a third batch, like the first (with the almond extract) and they were perfect. Also followed another reviewer's advice and used a chapstick end to make the hole. These are delicious and attractive IF you follow the recipe exactly."
"355","5","Have been making these for Christmas since they first appeared in a Pillsbury Classic cookbook many years ago. They are a tender, buttery, melt-in-your mouth cookie that also look pretty on the plate. They do spread a bit, so I always chill the dough first and roll the dough into balls a little smaller than the recipe suggests. This is simply a perfect Christmas cookie."
"232","5","I've made these cookies a half-dozen times now. They've been DELICIOUS every single time, but here's a few words of advice: First, do not leave out the almond extract or sub it with vanilla. The almond adds a great flavor and its very distinct. Second, pull the cookies out of the oven midway through cooking, take a spoon and lightly spread the jam outwards and even it out into a circle. This way, the cookies will look much prettier when done. The first time I made them, the jam had bubbled all over the cookie and wasn't evenly spread. The flavor was the same of course but the jam likes to go its own direction and I like them to look pretty. Great recipe!  ETA: I have found that once the cookies are ready to be put in the oven, if you put them in the fridge for ~15 minutes, it will eliminate the need to 'fix' the jam half-way through baking. Also, because shortbread is naturally so white, it is easy to burn these without realizing that the bottoms are browning. So, carefully watch the edges and when they turn light brown, they are done (even if they don't look like it!) Also, use the back of a teaspoon to make perfect little holes to fill."
"222","5","These are so fabulously simple and great. Although... it did take 3 tries in the oven before I figured out how to eliminate the jam from spreading all over my cookie sheets and creating a mess! (even the messy looking cookies tasted great though) I should have listened to other reviews... In the end... I made the cookies like small little buttons - about the size of a quarter, rolled them into a ball, like another reviewer and then made a nice indent for the jam. You don't need a lot of jam... when you use too much, the jam will destroy your cookie sheets... suggestion for novice bakers like me... use parchment paper the first few rounds so you don't have to deal with the mess in the event you don't use the right amount of jam or push the indent enough to hold the jam... Anyhow, I baked the really small cookies for only 12 1/2 minutes and they turned out fabulously. Each oven is different though... that much I've learned... so I started to look for golden brown edges and then pulled the cookies out .... makes for a tasty shortbread cookie! even my husband, who is a die-hard chocolate chip cookie lover and told me 'i don't like sugar/shortbread type cookies'... well... he has managed to eat close to a dozen of the little button cookies in the past few hours!"
"180","5","Wow - a simple cooke with a absolutely decadent flavor! I mean these are really, really good. the key to these is chilling the dough, rolling them small and taking the genious advice of using a chapstick cap to make the indentions. Whoever thought of that little trick deserves a medal! These cookies definitely melt in your mouth. I used glaze featured with the recipe, but you can definitely change this up with melted white and dark chocolate - YUM!"
"155","5","The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any butter on hand and used margarine (Can't Believe It's Not Butter). Although I typically never bake with margarine - I was surprised at how well it worked for this recipe. Although the recipe works as stated - I've found a way to 'improve' it a bit.   By adding 2 egg yolks and 2 extra tablespoons of flour - it creates a tastier cake-like cookie. The trick is to beat the butter by itself until the butter is very pale - then add the sugar and beat again until very very pale. Add the eggs and flavoring - then add the flour.  I don't use extract because I don't use any alcohol - I have found an almond emulsion for bakers (alcohol free and much better than extracts) and these cookies are PHENOMENAL with the almond flavoring. Vanilla works well too - but the almond is the best!   Of all the cookies I bake these are the most requested cookies.   I use a cookie scoop to have even sized cookies - shape them into round balls and only use my thumb to make the indentation. Fill a plastic ziplock bag with the preserves and snip the corner of the bag - and pipe the preserves into the center of the cookie (less fuss and mess)... if you have any extra preserves you can just squeeze it back into the jar. Be sure to use parchment paper, rotate half way through baking, and remove from oven when the bottoms begin to brown (the tops of the cookie shouldn't brown)."
"87","5","The best and easiest holiday cookie out there. I have been making this for a few years now. I make equal batches of Strawberry and Raspberry. These cookies spread. After you roll your cookies and put your jam in put them back in the fridge for about 20 min. makes a huge difference."
"82","5","These cookies are not only impressive, they are mouth watering delicious! I made the 'thumb print' indentation with a wine bottle cork, and filled the centers with a seedless raspberry preserve that I heated on the stove for an easier consistency. I alternated the drizzle every other cookie with a semi-sweet chocolate and the almond glaze, using a zip lock baggie to pipe the glaze. This has got to be the most simple, yet impressive cookie I have ever made!"
"81","5","These didn't turn out exactly how I was expecting, however, the taste made up for the appearance. Make sure to space the cookies far enough apart on the cookie sheet so they don't end up molded together. AND...make your thumb print indentions deep enough so the raspberry jam doesn't run out. Mind did just that and made a mess on my cookie sheet. I suggest using your little finger instead of your thumb...so the indentions look a little more delicate. I sprinkled poppy seeds in my dough before baking to give the cookies a little 'something'. I had to use a little more than 1 tsp of milk to make a glaze. I poured my glaze into a ziploc bag, cut off a corner and drizzled the glaze on the cookies. Again, despite the runny jam, these did taste really good and I do recommened them:) Thanks for sharing Dee. P.S. The second batch I made, I used the top of a chap-stick container to make my indentions...they turned out great!!"
"62","5","Wonderfully easy and yummy! Made these for a cookie exchange and found that even when made with the same exact ingredients the temperature of these ingredients can effect the expansion of the cookies...the cooler the dough before you put it in the oven, the less I found these to expand."
"29","5","I added 1/4 cup of flour and lowered the oven temperature to 325F. I scooped the dough with my smallest cookie scoop and rolled them in my palms and flattened them slightly. I held the ball in a cupped palm and gently pressed the handle end of a large wooden spoon into the dough to create a round imprint. This method kept the dough from cracking. The balls were slightly bowl shaped on the bottoms when I placed them on the cookie sheet but they cooked down...without any cracks. I used a baby spoon to fill the indentation holes with blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry jellies. I put the first batch in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking and I alternated pans in the freezer and oven during cooking times. I baked them for 20 minutes. They need to brown SLIGHTLY, otherwise the dough will be raw under the jelly. After baking, I chipped off the crispy crumbles that formed around the cookies. I used 2 1/2 teaspoons milk in the icing to thin it to a drizzle consistancy. DO NOT ice these until they are completely cool or your icing will melt and won't look drizzled. Although, next time I'll probably skip the icing because it makes the cookies way too sweet. I'll also probably decrease the amount of almond extract in the cookies and omit it from the icing alltogether. Makes 30 beautiful and delicious cookies."
"20","5","OMG! I have never been able to get these cookies to work...these did! Based on reviews I changed a few things. 1. Rolled the dough into small, teaspooned sized balls. 2. Used the lid of a chapstick container to make the indentation for the jam. 3. Placed jam in a baggie and snipped end so I could squeeze into hole without getting it all over. (Worked perfectly!) 3. Placed in fridge for 15 minutes. 4. Baked for 10 minutes and then added just a tad more jam to the cookies cuz a lot melts (I like a lot). 5. Placed back in oven to finish cooking. 6. Used the baggie method again to drizzle on the icing. I can't wait til the next time to make these cookies! Yummy!!"
"20","4","Why in the world should you bother to find a chapstick container and clean off the lid when you can just use the lid to the almond extract? That's what I did, and it worked perfectly!"
"19","3","I was very dissapointed in these cookies! I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with flat cookies! They looked more like saucers than cookies, the jelly spread everywhere. I will try these again sometime but will look through reviews on how to make them like the picture."
"17","4","This is a great recipe, though I made a small change in the interest of saving time: I plopped the dough balls on the cookie sheets, made the 'thumbprints' using a wine cork (worked wonderfully), and put the cookies WITHOUT JAM into the oven for 10-12 mins. I took them out just before the bottom edges started to get brown (note: the 'thumbprints' inflated a bit, so they were pretty shallow by the time they came out of the oven). As soon as the cookies were out of the oven, I filled the indentations with raspberry jam. The cookies came out beautifully and were even tastier the next day, after the cookie and jam had settled together. In my opinion, no need to bake the cookies WITH the jam--this way, you can avoid the need to refrigerate the cookies beforehand, and there's no worry of a jam mess in the oven."
"16","5","I love these cookies. I chilled them overnight and baked them today. I found that putting the jam in a ziploc bag to pipe helped keep from making a mess and made the jam easier to handle--squishing it in the bag warms it up. I think they look adorable and they taste delicious! *Update*: I made these once with the hand mixer. I won't ever do that again! It makes the butter melt and they don't turn out. Use a pastry cutter like I usually do and they will turn out very well."
"15","5","Very easy cookie to make and the results are delicious. The dough was extremely easy to work with, no chilling necessary. I added the flour in 4 parts and mixed everything till just blended with a plain fork. The first time, I made them big...I used a tablespoon to measure out the dough and pressed out shallow centers down with my fingers till it made 1.75' size cookies. The next time, I used a teaspoon and pressed out a deeper center and ended up with 1' cookies. The smaller ones looked cuter, but they both tasted good. I didn't see any seedless preserves at my local Trader Joe's, so i just used seeded raspberry preserves. I used a non-insulated dark baking sheet and I had no problems with spreading. I did not make any of the icing. The cookies were crisp at first, but after sitting out for about an hour, the texture was softer. (I uploaded photos of the finished cookie)."
"13","5","Thanks for the fabulous recipe, Dee! Easy and delicious! Thanks also to the various reviewers who suggested using a chapstick cap to make the indentations. I coated my hands with powdered sugar to roll the balls (about an inch in size) and then dipped the chapstick cap in powdered sugar as well -- worked perfectly. You need to be sure and leave enough dough under the indentation so that the jam doesn't seep through it while baking. For fun, I tried all the jams in our fridge -- strawberry, apple, blackberry and raspberry. Because the cookie isn't highly flavorful on its own, you need to use a strongly flavored jam. Raspberry was perfect. I made these for my husband and didn't expect to like them myself since I don't care for raspberry. But I just LOVED the raspberry in this recipe! The other jams I tried just didn't have the same 'oomph,' so I'd definitely recommend sticking with raspberry or a similarly strongly flavored jam."
"12","5","This recipe was excellent. I made it last Mothers Day. I used cookie cutters to shape them like flowers. I baked other cookies as well shaped as cookies, stuck them on skewers, and made a cookie bouquet! I wrapped the raspberry & almond shortbread thumbprints in colorful saran wrap and tied them with ribbon's (since they couldn't stand on the skewer's). My mom absolutely loved it!"
"10","5","These turned out great! I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and used the chapstick cap for the indentations (seriously, I have little hands and my thumb would have made too large of spaces) and chilled the cookies in the fridge about 10 minutes before I threw them in the oven. Also, I had to add another teaspoon of milk as one teaspoon just made a glaze the consistency of a thick glue that wouldn't drizzle. Other than that followed the recipe and they turned out perfect!"
"10","4","Very good!!! I filled a Ziploc baggie with jam & cut a hole at one of the corners & piped the jam in (No Mess!!), chilled the cookies (with the jam inside) for about 10 min before baking...and used a cookie scoop to make the cookies...only giving me 27 cookies. Also, my first batch, I waited about 5-10 min before glazing the cookies & it melted/didn't look so pretty. The second batch, I waited almost an hour before glazing them, and they looked much nicer. Very yummy!!! (A 5-Star with these changes!!)"
"10","5","Delicious! Sometimes I make these by forming a 1/2' log ... flatten it out a little and use your finger to make indentations across about every inch or so. Then fill those indentations with the jam. When the come out, give them a few minutes, then when they're still warm cut them into slices. It's actually easier that way instead of rolling a whole bunch of balls."
"10","5","Have made these cookies several times, and they are without a doubt my favorite. The only tip I can give is not to make the glaze to runny as it tends to puddle in the middle. Thicker glaze stays put and makes for a pretty cookie. I use 2-3 tsp. water instead of milk."
"9","5","Awesome recipe! Very easy to make. Turned out very well."
"8","5","I wish people would take into account the reviews before reviewing. If the majority of people give something 5 stars don't one star because baking isn't your forte. These are delicious. I added the extra 1/4C of flour, used raspberry, apricot and strawberry jam, rolled some in crushed almonds and put them in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking..they came out picture perfect!"
"8","5","5 star recipe all the way, I find it works better if I do not soften the butter. Different flavor of jam work well too (blackberry is a favorite!) and I generally leave off the icing they are yummy without it."
"8","4","the 1st batch I made I took another reviewer advice of adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour forget that! Took me so long to get the cookies to roll into a ball. The second batch I followed the recipe as stated turned out great. I did put the cookies in the freezer before baking though."
"8","5","I LOVE these cookies and have been making them for years at Christmas. I have a convection oven and cook three trays at once and they always turn out perfectly. I use insulated cookie sheets and adjust my oven according to the manufacturer's directions (for mine, I turn the oven down 25 degrees). Also, I drizzle the top of my cookies with melted white chocolate instead of the confectioner's sugar glaze. Pure heaven!"
"8","5","They came out excellent! I was able to halve the recipe without a problem. I also did the following: 1) Added two extra tablespoons of flour 2) Added 1/4 teaspoon BAKING POWDER! (this helps them from spreading out and becoming super flat) 3) Took the cookies out midway through baking and added more raspberry filling so it wouldn't crust up and get chewy. I followed other reviews and used parchment paper as well. Irresistible cookies!"
"8","5","These are delicious! The shortbread part is exactly how shortbread should taste. I did find that they cooked in 10-12 mins instead of 14-18. I was scared the almond would be too much, so I didn't quite fill up the measuring spoons when measuring it. Turned out perfect for me! Make sure to fill the holes all the way up to the top with the jam for a prettier cookie. NOTE: For me, these cookies do NOT turn out when it's raining. I've made them a dozen times and when it is raining or humid out, the cookies turn brown at the edges and run. If it is dry and sunny, they turn out PERFECT."
"8","5","I made these for my cookie exchange this Christmas, and everyone raved about them! They are so easy and taste 'fancy,' but to make them even more special, I added an almond slice to the top after baking (centered over the jam) and then drizzled the glaze over the whole thing. I also tinted some of the glaze green to make it more Christmas-y, but I think I prefer the white glaze! This simple cookies also freeze well if you wait until the glaze is 'set' and then separate layers with waxed paper."
"8","1","Since I didn't have rasberry jam, I used strawberry, and omitted the sugar glaze and instead rolled the uncooked cookies in coconut. Unfortunately, something went wrong and while cooking, the cookies expanded to huge, flat, red blobs. I didn't make them very big, so I don't know what happened. Be very careful when rolling the balls, (make them SMALL) and only add a BIT of jam, I think I added to much. I may try again, but am discouraged by the fickleness of these cookies."
"7","5","These are lovely. Don't burn your tongue on the hot jam, while eagerly trying to shove a fresh-out-of-the oven cookie in your mouth."
"7","4","Very good cookies, and easy to make too! Make sure the dough is cold before putting in the oven, or they will flatten out too much. I used a seedless raspberry jam and the cookies turned out perfectly. The only thing I had to do different was use WAY more milk for the glaze. One teaspoon is not even close to being enough. I ended up having to use at least 5 tsp. I'd also wait at least 5 mins before drizzling the cookies. Otherwise the cookies are too hot and the glaze ends up melting and pooling in the middle of the cookie."
"7","5","I followed the recipe to the letter and didn't have any troubles with spreading, like some other reviewers mentioned. These are delicate and beautiful. My whole family loved them."
"7","5","I have to say that I just made these 4 hours ago, and they are all gone! Obviously a huge hit. I got scared about adding to much jam by all the reviews that said it bubbled over, but I just put them in the fridge for a couple minutes like everyone else said, and they didn't run over at all, I could have added more."
"7","5","These turned out beautifully. I halved the recipe and made 12 cookies. I rolled them into balls and used the end of a wooden spoon to make a deep hole. Then I expanded the hole with my thumb. I baked the cookies empty for 10 minutes then another 5 minutes after I put the jam in. Also I used a pestle to press the indent in again before I filled the cookies. It worked perfectly."
"7","5","This is a very easy, tasty cookie with an elegant look. I have made these twice now the second time ommitting the drizzle which cut the sweetness. Thanks for sharing."
"6","5","These were out of this world! I brought them into work for a birthday gathering and everyone couldn't stop raving about them. I didn't soften the butter - just cut it up and creamed it with the sugar cold. I used the other reviewer’s advice of making them smaller and using a chap stick cap for the hole. This worked out perfectly. Like other reviewers I also put the dough into the fridge for 15 minutes before cooking to help maintain the shape. They came out beautifully after just 12 minutes. For the glaze portion I found that my milk expired so used heavy whipping cream instead. I also found I had to use a little more then 1 teaspoon and wait about 5-10 minutes after the cookies came out of the oven to drizzle it on. On my first batch I waited just a minute or two and the glaze just melted into the cookie. I desired the stripes of glaze as in the picture."
"6","5","Yummy!!! I made this recipe for Christmas Eve. I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe! Thank you!!"
"6","5","I love these so much...I have made them many times and followed this tip from other reviewers: do not sub. the almond extract! I like to use apricot and SEEDLESS raspberry preserves for mine. YUM!"
"6","5","I LOVE the almond extract....more flavor than vanilla extract without being overbearing. I now use almond extract in different sugar cookies...great!"
"6","5","These were great. I did not add the almond extract or the glaze and followed a suggestion to use cold butter. It was a bit harder to mix at first but they did not go flat and jam stayed in the middle. And I made them with two toddlers helping me to shape the little balls and they turned out great. Keeper!"
"6","5","These cookies were an absolute hit! After following the recipe to the last detail, my first round turned out exactly as MarcieJ said they would... completely flat, and nothing like the picture. So as soon as I took them out of the oven, I started making some of the changes that MarcieJ suggested, to save the rest of the batch. I lowered the oven temp, added flour to the dough, and after shaping the cookies and adding the jam, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes. The second round were picture perfect. Don't bother sticking to the recipe on this one, or you'll be disappointed with the outcome. Make the changes, and your eyes and stomach will both be very happy."
"6","4","Based on the reviews, I added 1/4' flour and also put the cookies in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking so they wouldn't get flat. Great tips.   I thought the glaze made the cookies a little too sweet. Next time I make a batch, I'll omit the glaze."
"6","5","This cookie turned out great! I found the dough a bit too crumbly at first so I added milk a tablespoon at a time, as needed. If the dough gets too sticky, put it in the fridge and allow it to chill for a little while. It will be easier to work with"
"5","5","One of my favorite Christmas cookies! They are always the first gone off the tray!"
"5","4","Great cookies! Very easy to make! However, one thing I didn't care too much for was the STRONG almond flavor. It made them almost too sweet for me. I'd like to figure out how to change that. Also, I did follow the advice of others and refrigerated them for about 15 minutes before baking and they held up very nicely. I also used the advice of another review and used the end of a tube of chapstick to make the indentions for the filling. They turned out picture perfect!"
"5","5","Simplicity itself. Followed the original recipe with no problems. I've also made these using cherry preserves with equal success. Will definitely keep using this recipe!"
"5","4","Made these last night. The only changes to the recipe I made was that I added a little extra almond extract (used pure not imitation), and I also didn't mix the butter and sugar first. I added everything to my bowl all at once. They tasted absolutely wonderful, but were very very flat. Next time I'll be following the recipe with more precision."
"5","5","I don't understand the folk who substituted vanilla for the almond extract, 'almond' is in the title and it's a crucial ingredient. These cookies rock! We rolled them about an inch and only yielded 32 cookies. I don't see how we could have gotten 36 at the size suggested (1 1/2'). The next time I make these I will wait for the cookies to cool completely before drizzling because it puddled to the middle of the cookie and didn't really look appealing. (I say that because I gave them as a gift.) Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's now our 2nd favorite cookie."
"5","5","I absolutely love, love, love this recipe! It is so easy and versatile. I make these with so many different flavors of preserves and jellies. So far Ive done, raspberry, peach, mango, strawberry and orange marmalade. I think raspberry is my favorite, but I love them all! I use cold butter instead of softened, and I use either the top of a chapstick or the back of a 1/4 tsp to make the indent. Everyone loves when I make these, they taste like more work than they really are!"
"5","5","These were fabulous! I actually tried 4 different flavors of jam just to see what's liked best--strawberry, blackberry, apricot and raspberry. They are all a hit! My glaze was a bit too runny I think because it mostly just pooled in the jam or ran off the sides but the almond flavor really adds. I made with my 3 year old and they were much more fun than regular cookies."
"5","5","When I made these cookies, I happen to of made a batch and a half of the cookie dough, but after baking, the dough spread, and the jam ran. I had to throw out 2 pans of the cookies. I then added a 2/3's cup of flour to the remaining dough, using my hands to work the flour into the remaining cookie dough. The cookies then baked purfectly. If I were to rate this recipe, using the amount of ingredients as written, I would only give this recipe 1 STAR, but since I was able to make this recipe work, by adding more flour, I will give this rate this recipe with 5 STARS. The end results... this is a good tasting cookie, but my husband would of much preferred these cookies without the icing, but as for me, I liked them with the icing. One more thing I wanted to mention here, when it came to adding preserves to the cookie dough, I had used both apricot preserves and seedless raspberry jam. Both tasted great, but I thought the raspberry jam gave these cookies a lot more flavor, and when it came to baking the cookies, I baked them on my Pampered Chef Baking Stoneware for 16 minutes. Dee, thank you for the recipe!"
"5","5","These are truly delicious! I followed the recipe to a T and they came out wonderful. I have a tip for all who want to try these. I used my pinky finger to put the hole in the center of the cookie. I also used a ziploc bag to put the jam in and I cut a tiny bit off the corner for a hole. It made it very easy to put the jam in the hole without making a mess. Do not fill the hole all the way of else you will have a mess as the cookies bake. Very easy to make and delicious!"
"5","5","I found a little trick-if you use a teaspoon (a metal one seems to be the best) to make the indent it works perfect and don't fill the hole up completely. These are the best cookies!! I am not one to eat my own baking but these I cannot keep my hands off of."
"5","5","I love these cookies. The bottoms were perfectly browned and slightly crisp but also a little chewy. Perfect! Now, I have to say one thing about a previous reviewer making suggestions on how to keep the shape of the cookies; I dunno what she's talking about! Yikes, she put a lot of work into making hers higher by not softening the butter and adding flour and refrigerating before baking. Take my advice and don't waste your time. I was a little concerned that the dough wouldn't hold it's shape but if you look at the pic I took you'll see my concerns were unfounded. I mixed the softened margarine by hand and omitted the glaze. To make them look more uniform I used a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon, dipped the back in flour (to avoid sticking), and used that to make the 'thumbprint.' Mine aren't raspberry because I wanted to use some lemon curd I had and I also replaced the almond extract with lemon. Yum! This cookie is a real winner and a breeze to make."
"5","5","Very delicious and pretty cookies!! I followed everyone's advice and added 1/4 cup extra flour and an egg. I put the dough in the fridge before forming the cookies and then again refridgerated the whole cookie sheet before putting it in the oven. I put less almond extract but added a dash of lemon juice. The cookies turned out soft, tall, and delicious with no jam leaking out at all. UPDATE: I made these cookies again but this time filled with lemon curd...amazing!"
"5","1","These were A LOT of work, and I was not impressed with the end result. Maybe I'm just not used to shortbreads, but I found this way too greasy. The dough was also difficult to work with. Sorry, but I would not make this again."
"5","5","I have been making this recipe for several years and it is great! Just a few ideas to help in your cookie experience. Yes they spread as stated in other reviews. You will only need to make small balls the size of a quarter or less! I use a small cookie scoop to make my balls. The dough freezes well so if you are making many, roll them in balls and freeze them in a rigid container which is well sealed. To bake place balls on a cookie sheet, thaw slightly and push a small indentation in the cookies. (I use childs medicine spoon, anything small and round) My favorite Rapsberry fill is 'SOLO'. Using a cake decorating bag to squeeze the fill in the holes is quick and easy. I do not use the glaze, the cookies are great w/o."
"5","5","I have but one word for these cookies....AMAZING!!! I couldn't believe how delicious they turned out. I rolled some of the balls into crushed almonds before using the cap of my mascara (I made sure it was clean) to make thumbprints. They looked great! To top them off, I sprinked some crushed almonds on the raspberry center. I will definitely make these again!"
"5","5","Excellent! I rolled the balls in Sugar in the Raw before baking and used strawberry jam, it's all I had. Also, I put the glaze in a baggie and cut a small hole at the end for better control. Thanks so much for"
"5","5","12/2006 Update - Suggest making them in 1 inch balls....very good/sweet but bitesize is best! ************************* BEST cookie at the Cookie Exchange! My official 'taste-tester' (13 year old neighbor's son) told his Mom 'Be sure and get ALOT of those raspberry cookies for me at the party!' I kept them small (maybe 1-1/2 inch balls) used a small indent, and squeezed the jam from corner of 'baggie'. Used the baggie for drizzling too (best invention!) They turned out size of 50cent piece and were 2-bite wonders! Try them."
"5","5","These were really awesome and so easy to make...the only problem was that the confectioner sugar drizzle was too thick and I added more milk, not much I thought, but it came out too thin. I will definately make these again and work on the 'drizzle' part."
"5","5","This was a great cookie. I used lemon extract instead of the almond extract and lemon curd for the filling. My family loves this cookie! Be sure to set your timer and don't overbake. Mine were slightly brown on the bottom only. Land o lakes margarine worked great. No crumbly mixture as noted in previous reviews."
"4","5","These cookies are delicious and so easy to make! I didn't have any problems with them being flat or the jam spilling over. I placed the dough in the refrigerator for about one hour. Then I rolled the dough into 1' balls. I used a food scale, and each ball was 0.65 oz. I used the end of a chapstick to make the indent; the indent was pretty deep since I wanted a lot of jam. I piped the jam into the indent by putting the jam in a ziploc bag and snipping off a corner. I was generous with the amount of jam; I made sure each indent was filled to the top. After rolling and filling, I placed the whole cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper) in the freezer for about 8 minutes. Then I baked the cookies for about 14-15 minutes (until edges are lightly brown) and let the cookies rest on the sheet for about 2 minutes. They turned out perfect! I tried them with the glaze and prefer them without the glaze. Also, I used unsoftened salted butter (I made sure to whip the butter and sugar until fluffy)."
"4","4","The cookie dough recipe is exactly like LandoLakes recipe. Their glaze uses water instead of milk. 'Think milk's better. Also, their recipe is twice the glaze & it really only requires the amount on this recipe. I refrigerated my dough overnight. (That may be why more flour is required if you don't refrigerate). 'Used the joint (between knuckle & fingertip) to make the indentation. It's more consistent. Be sure to not push in too much or the bottom will be too thin when baked. It's okay to mound it a little, too, since it deepens while baking. Mine, 1' balls, were done in 17 minutes on a regular, non airbake, sheet. Both kids liked 'em. 'Used strawberry jam 1/8t - 1/4t per. Let the cookies cool before glazing - unless you like messes - well, more of a mess with warm cookies. Just place them on wax paper & transfer to serving or storage dish once it's dried. (BTW, Kroger butter won't work for this, but GV will, &, of course, LoL.) Gotta try lipstick trick & Autumn Leaves' comment of making a log, then slicing it. Big time saver! Three dozen balls of firm dough is rough on the hands! :) AND: Someone please address the almond extract in the glaze. It has to be 1/4t right? That's about what I did. I can't imagine that much extract for so little glaze."
"4","4","I grew up baking these every Christmas with my Mom. Instead of a thumb or other item, I make the indentation by pressing the bottom of a small measuring spoon into it. Makes a deep enough well that the jam doesn't run out and its a perfect circle.   We sprinkled w/sifted confectioner's sugar once they cooled. Problem with that is the conf sugar always 'disappears' with any moisture in the air, so I'm looking forward to trying the glaze."
"4","5","Delish! only thing I would change is that the ball size should be closer to 1' and I had to make an extra 1/2 batch of the drizzle."
"4","5","One of my favorite cookies EVER. I loooove them. I like to use rum extract instead of almond and strawberry jam instead of raspberry. Its like a daiquiri cookie!"
"4","5","I made these last Christmas (2010) with leftover jam in the fridge (I had both blackberry and sugar-free blueberry). I did not put the extra icing on top, because they are plenty sweet without and, despite the holidays, I do try to cut back where I can. Word of caution--- do not chill the dough. I made four batches of cookie dough ahead of time and then had a marathon baking day. These do not roll out well when chilled. They really need to be soft."
"4","5","These are delicious. My kids don't like Nana's thumbprints, but love these (I had to hide them). The touch of icing on top is a must."
"4","3","They were OK, but probably won't make again."
"4","4","I would rate these a 5 on taste alone, but took away a star because there has got to be a way to make the dough easier to deal with. I had several flat, runny batches (that still tasted incredible) I finally found that if I chilled the dough overnight, then tightly formed the cookie over the top of and around my fingertip, the cookies kept their shape fairly well. I would highly recommend trying these simply because they are delicious but understand that they might not turn out beautiful :)"
"4","5","These are excellent. I am going to make them again, but with lemon jam."
"4","5","OMG...What a great cookie! I am only sorry I didn't make more. These were sooooo good. Make sure you use Almond Extract. I like other's used other types of jams. I used Apricot, Orange, Strawberry and Raspberry. Raspberry was my favorite. These were sooo good! OMG, and I thought they were going to be horrible since some people here said that the jam went all over. Nope for me it was perfect. I used the back of a teaspoon to make the thumbprint and I added the jam and baked. They smelled so good too! I will certainly be making these again for any occasion. I got RAVE reviews. In time they get soft and just even better. This is the perfect tea time cookie!!!"
"4","5","outstanding!! My glaze was a little tricky as far as getting the consistency right....I added more milk than what was called for....and it was still hard to drizzle evenly and make them look as pretty as in this picture. Still, these cookies were a hit. (Oh....and I used a high quality raspberry jam that did have seeds...and I thought it was great!)"
"4","5","I have been making these cookies around Christmas for years. I definitely suggest putting the uncooked, ready cookie sheets in the fridge for about 15 minutes before going in the oven. This way the cookies won't spread out as much."
"4","3","I can't say these really turned out for me. Even when I froze the prepared cookie sheets for 15 minutes, they still turned out pretty flat. They tasted pretty good. Too bad I can't put them on the cookie tray because of how they look... at least it's an easy recipe!"
"4","5","These are so delicious. They are so pretty. I followed the recipe exactly except for the glaze. I needed to add a little more milk to make it drizzling consistency. I also used the chapstick lid to make the indentations! Will make every year from now on!"
"4","5","These were a huge hit for Thanksgiving! The ones that went the quickest, however, were the ones that I placed Reese's miniatures, Rolos, and Kisses on after they were cooked. I recommend these to anyone."
"4","5","Very good. I doubled the almond extract in the dough and in the glaze; we're almond fanatics. As some suggested, I used a chapstick tube for the indent and it worked wonderful. I made the indents half as deep as the lid."
"4","2","Too sweet, jam didn't solidify, just not my kind of cookie."
"4","5","Awesome recipe. I highly recommend using almond extract and raspberry jam. Something about this combination is just heavenly. Instead of drizzling with frosting, I cover the cookie part (not the jelly center) with powder sugar. It is always a crowd pleaser!"
"4","5","This shortbread base is delicious. I cannot rate the whole recipe, because I was actually just looking for a good shortbread cookie recipe for my holiday cookies. I usually buy the Ghirradelli shortbread cookies with chocolate in the middle, (they are my husbands favorite) but couldnt find them this year! So, I followed this shortbread cookie recipe exactly as the recipe states, but instead of jam, I put a hersheys kiss in the middle. This was the third shortbread recipe I tried, and the others turned out horrible...this one was absolutely perfect and delicious! No need to ever buy boxed again...This will be my new recipe for holiday shortbread cookies! Thanks!!"
"4","5","So yummy! I made 3 batches of these over the Christmas holidays. They were all eaten up very quick. Thanks for the recipe it will be on my Christmas cookie list from now on."
"4","5","I used my cookie scoop, and formed the ball from that so the dough didn't get too soft. I also used the back of a round 1/2 teaspoon to make the indent in the cookie. I used black raspberry fruit spread, (not as sweet) and after tasting them I decided it didn't need the glaze. I'll make these often!"
"4","3","Sorry, but these just didn't work for me. Even after chilling the dough, they still spread like crazy. The flavor was good, but the finished product wasn't something that I would serve to company."
"4","1","Total failure. These things are falling apart as soon as they are touched (even though more flour was added to make the sticky dough able to be handled). I used butter-flavor Crisco, and it should work just as well as butter, for which it was designed to be a substitute."
"4","5","This was great!! added a few extra TB of flour, baked at 340 for 13-14 minutes. Froze each batch for about 10 minutes before baking to help retain shape. Used a sterilized chapstick top to make 'thumbprints.' Used strawberry jam. Did not use sugar/milk drizzle."
"4","5","First, I took the suggestion of turning the oven down to 325 degrees; they were done at 30 minutes. I softened the butter and started to use a mixer for the butter & sugar, but ended up using a PASTRY CUTTER 'til the end (this is what creates the PERFECT CRUMBLEY COOKIE texture). You DON'T NEED to add 1/4 more flour if you use the pastry cutter & freezer/fridgerate the dough. DO NOT CUT DOWN ON THE ALMOND EXTRACT. It might seem strong in the batter, but the flavor dies down when you cook it. Push all the crumbles together with your hands or the back of a spoon to get a ball of dough. I first made the dough before dinner, then put it in the FRIDGE, so I could cook dinner & eat, then came back & started to roll the dough into little balls. I used the BACK OF A COOKING SPOON, & this created a perfect little hole, but I found it too small. NEXT TIME, I'm just going to use my thumb, so there is an equal ratio of jam & cookie. Also, put the jam in PLASTIC BAG & smash the jam if there are any chunks of fruit, then cut the end of the bag & squeeze into each hole. I would suggest filling the hole ALL THE WAY, because the jam deflates when they cook. Turn on oven to preheat (325 degrees) & NOW PUT YOUR UNBAKED COOKIES IN THE FREEZER FOR 10 MINUTES. I covered the cookie sheet w/ parchment paper just in case of any spills, but there were no messes. I DID NOT USE THE SUGAR TOPPING & BELIEVE, THEY DID NOT NEED IT. Perfection!"
"4","5","These are great. I made exactly as written, except I used homemade raspberry jam that had seeds and it was fine. Delicious."
"4","5","Great recipe, so easy and so tasty, no modifications needed (although I did use margarine instead of butter). I made 300 'bite size' cookies for a bake sale by making 3 batches and scooping the dough with a very small melon baller: rolled the dough into balls and used the flat end of a chopstick to tap down the center about 8 times. I put the jam in a ziplock, snipped a tiny hole in the corner, and filling the cookies was a breeze. I removed the cookies from the oven just as the bottoms were starting to turn golden. After the cookies cooled, I drizzled white chocolate on half of my product and semi-sweet chocolate on the others - I prefer the semi-sweet chocolate. Thanks for this great recipe!!"
"4","5","Goodness, these cookies are amazing! A pretty simple recipe that yields the most delicious cookies. I followed the advice of other reviewers-- I checked the cookies midway through the baking time to even out the jam to make sure it wasn't overflowing everywhere. I found not much need to fix anything. Just don't put too much jam in the cookies. Then it should be fine. Also, do not even think about substituting the almond extract with vanilla. The almond is key in making these cookies smell and taste wonderful!!! As for the icing, I would add a little extra milk to make it less thick for easier drizzling. However, I'd like to add that after drizzling 3 cookies with icing, my bf who has a big sweet tooth said he liked them more without the icing. It's too sweet with it and scrumptious enough without it. I'm definitely making these cookies again."
"4","4","These were very tasty, I liked the almond flavoring. I used raspberry and apricot Solo filling instead of jam."
"4","5","These are delicious. I only made two changes to the flavor of the cookie -- 1/4 tsp salt after tasting the dough, and rather than use a sticky confectioners sugar glaze, I made a glaze out of white chocolate with a bit of almond extract added and drizzled with that. I only changed the glaze because these cookies are on their way to a cookie exchange tomorrow and I was afraid the other glaze wouldn't set up. I did make two other functional changes to the recipe, after the first batch flattened too much in the oven. I reduced the temp to 325, and I refrigerated the cookies for fifteen minutes after I formed them and put in the jam. Then they didn't spread and were gorgeous. Excellent cookie and so beautiful!"
"4","5","Just delicous... I put a bit more of flour and refregirated them for half an hour before baking them (as seggested) and they didn't leak at all. Very quick and easy to make... no doubt I'll make them again."
"4","5","Wonderful!!! I registered just so I can write a review... I loved this recipe. I am the world worst baker, But this was easy and yummy! Supper buttery. I used vanilla extract because that’s all I had & also used raspberry spread but it came out great and it looked just like the pictures. I noticed that if I use my thumb the cookie dough cracked so I used a fork with a round handle and it was perfect.  Ok... so a few people wrote that the recipe didn't work for them and that the cookies didn't retain their shape.  I made a second batch a day after I wrote this review and found that if you wait too long to cook the cookies the butter starts to melt and the batter gets a bit gooey, so it didn't seem like the cookies would retain the shape so I used a mini muffin pan. IT CAME OUT GREAT."
"4","3","I tried this recipe because it had received so many glowing reviews. I doubled the batch, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. When I saw the consistency of the mixed dough, I tried one batch as instructed in the recipe. The resulting cookie spread out too much, and the texture was greasy. For the rest of the dough, I pressed them into mini muffin cups, added the jam, and froze them for 10 minutes before baking. The result was much better. I was left thinking that this recipe should have had more flour. What did I do wrong? 200 of you can't be wrong!"
"4","5","So good. Followed suggestions and chilled cookies just before baking. Made them small, about 1' and they came out perfect. Also used a chapstick (wrapped in plastic wrap) to make my 'dimples'. Worked perfect. Watch the time carefully. I baked mine only about 13 minutes tops. Cool just a bit before drizzling on glaze. Beautiful cookie! Thanks"
"4","5","This is a delicious buttery tasting cookie with a slight hint of the almond. I think I would increase the Almond extract by a 1/4 Tsp the next time I make them. I omitted the glaze, the cookies are great as they are without the glaze, although the glaze might make them a little more attractive. Freezing the cookies for 10 minutes before baking prevented them from spreading and I did use the chapstick hint provided by others which worked really well. A really great cookie recipe."
"4","5","yummy yummy cookies. I tested a couple cookies before making a full batch to avoid problems that other reviewers had. I used a good quality organic almond extract so the flavor is pure and not overpowering. I softened the butter (unsalted)just a little and cut it up in small pieces for creaming. I didn't need to add any liquid to the dough and I found working with it easy w/out chilling first. I used a generous heaping 1 tsp full of dough and like others used a chapstick cap fot the indentation. I tried putting them in the fridge at this stage for 10-20 min to firm up before putting them in the oven helps a little so they don't flatten out. I also baked them for 5 min WITHOUT the jam to prevent overflow. Then after putting the jam in I baked another 7-10 min until golden around the edges. I also lowered the temperature 10 degrees to 340 and baked on parchment paper to prevent burned bottoms. Don't forget to let them set on the cookie sheet upon removal (at least 5 minutes) before transferring to a rack otherwise the cookie bottoms are not set and the jam goes right through on your counters. (learned that the hard way). I opted to not use the icing because it is great just the way it is and the smell they make while baking is amazing. It could take a couple tries but well worth the time and effort to perfect these cookies. Even if they don't look picture perfect they are still delicious."
"4","5","I love these cookies and make them often. They taste just like wedding cake! On dry days the mixture can be a little too crumbly so I add 1 egg yolk and the dough comes together nicely."
"4","5","Fantastic cookie! I was short of butter so used 1/4 shortening to make up the difference and they were great. I actually make them that way all the time now to keep the cookie slightly soft. Also I fill with a fudge filling: 1 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips & 1/4 cup butter melted smooth. Use a teaspoon 'or so' on the cookies. To die for!!"
"4","5","A great, simple recipe. I changed mine a little, because we already sell too many cookies with raspberry filling. So we made then Cherry Almond Poppyseed cookies. I added 1/4 cup poppyseeds to the batter and filled them with cherry preserves. They went over big. Thanks, Dee."
"4","4","These were good and fairly easy, but i only gave it four stars because it didn't 'WOW!' me. The family did love them though, even the picky younger ones."
"4","5","I cannot say enough good things about this cookie. It was fantastic!!!So goooooood! I practiced with one or two to see how deep to make the indentions and how much jam to add without spillover. I used seedless black raspberry. I had to work with the glaze a bit to get the right consistency. Baked for 10 min. It did not make quite 3 doz. Will make again real soon!!! thanks Dee!!!"
"4","5","I thought these were outstanding cookies. I read other reviews and found it helpful to add the flour a little at a time. The dough wasn't crumbly at all and very easy to work with. I also didn't have any seedless jam, so I substituted strawberry preserves (with seeds) and it tasted great. I also had to add slightly more milk to the glaze to make it 'drippy' enough. I wouldn't skip the glaze. It adds a wonderul almond flavor. I made some without it to see if my family preferred them better that way. It was unanimous that the glazed ones were better. These are definitely a keeper. My family loved them. I will definitely make them again. Thank you, Dee."
"4","5","I made these cookies last Christmas. They were delicious. I also made a batch filled with strawberry jam and drizzled them with semi-sweet chocolate. Yummy!"
"4","5","These are great! Make sure you don't make them too big! They are wonderful"
"4","5","Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I filled a squeeze bottle with the raspberry preserves, which made filling the cookies really easy. I also drizzled with dark chocolate instead of the glaze. This is a permanent addition to my holiday baking!"
"3","5","I made these last week and they are the BEST!! I had tried another recipe 2 weeks prior and it was bland (less sugar, unsalted butter, pinch of salt and only almond extract). I shared these with family and friends and got a lot of compliments."
"3","5","Love this! Followed recipe to a tee. Well. . . I omitted the almond as I hate the taste but added fresh ground nutmeg. These came out perfect! I followed some reviews too. I froze the cookies filled with jam for ten mins before cooking and also used a Chapstick to make the indents. Genius!! I also chilled my dough before rolling into balls as I have very hot hands. Did not soften the butter first, just creamed with the sugar using an electric mixer. Threw all the flour in and mixed by hand with a wooden spoon in a plastic bowl. My cookies look beautiful. I also just put the jam straight from the jar (seeded raspberry) into a small Baggie and snipped the corner for piping. Perfect. Would recommend turning the oven down by 10 degrees too. But I'm in Niagara Falls and we had freezing rain tonight. Happy baking!!! These cookies are awesome"
"3","1","I am very disappointed considering all the positive reviews! I followed the recipe exactly as said, and twice did the cookies not work out. First of all, they did not hold their shape. Second, when I took them out of he oven to cool, they became rock hard. I don't know what went wrong!"
"3","5","Delicious cookies and really pretty too. I usually chill the dough for about half an hour to make it easier to work with. Strawberry jam is really nice in these as well."
"3","5","Simply amazing! I did make some adjustments right away - 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup of sugar, smaller dough balls, used the end of a wooden spoon to make the indents (perfect!) and I chilled the cookies for 20 minutes prior to baking, (zero flattening, looked just like in the photo!). The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more jam to the indents part way through baking as the jam does sink. No big deal though, I just ended up topping up the indents after they were done baking. I think if I hadn't made adjustments I'd be giving the recipe 4 stars. The cookies would be too sweet and definitely would have flattened out and not looked nearly as 'professional'."
"3","5","I made these for the first time years ago and they are absolutely delicious!! I'm going to make them again this week for Christmas. I would just like to say to the reviewers who alter the recipe and them give it a negative review because the cookies didn't turn out like they were supposed to. Of course it's not going to turn out right because you've created a new recipe by doing so. It's not fair to give a recipe a negative review when you've experimented by adding things such as coconut flakes or replacing almond extract with vanilla."
"3","4","I saw this cookie recipe in the Allrecipes magazine December/January 2014 issue on page. 43. I decided to finally try the recipe, as I have had it saved for quite some time in my recipe box. I wanted to see how it would work for a Christmas time cookie swap. I liked how the recipe was easy to follow and the cookies held up very well. I am not a big fan of almond extract, but the flavor was very mild in the cookie. My only surprise, was what a butter tasting this was compared to similar recipes. I didn't fill them too much, as I assumed the jam would boil over the cookie. It actually stayed exactly where I put it. Only change I made was reducing the almond extract by 1/3 on the icing and added 1.5 tsp. more of milk for the right consistency. I also waited after 15 minutes of cooling time to drizzle it on, so it didn't melt. The recipe yielded 2 dozen using a standard cookie scoop. It's a simple cookie, but overall it would add variety to a cookie tray especially if other jams were used. ty"
"3","5","I usually read a lot of reviews before I make anything, then I take advantage of many of the tricks/tips the other cooks have offered. First of all, this recipe was terrific just as written !!  The first tip I used was to use a melon baller (1.5') to get perfect, uniform sized cookies. I then hand rolled them to shape. The next was the chapstick lid to make the little holes, I had an old chapstick, but it was pretty grungy, but I had been to the dentist the day before, and voila (!!) the sample toothpaste cap was the same size, so used that. The third was piping the jam in, I put it in a baggie, and used one of my small pastry tips shoved through a corner (I hate cleaning my pastry bag, LOL.) Easy clean up, and you can squeeze any leftovers back in the jar. The warmth of your hand is enough to loosen even cold preserves. The fourth tip was the chilling of the dough before piping in the raspberry, but after scooping, rolling and indenting. 15 minutes was recommended, I went with 10. The fifth was to lower the oven temp just a hair, to about 230. It took the full 18 minutes. Using all those tips resulted in a superior cookie. My tip? fill the indents with just a tad more raspberry than you think you should. It doesn't run or bubble and they look great ! Thanks for the great recipe !"
"3","5","I love love love this recipe i always come back to this one and make it, so fast, so easy!!"
"3","5","First let me say that I've never cared for these types of similar looking cookies like the ones you see in the store.(always hard, never enough jam) but thought the hubby might like them so I made these for him last night and WOW!!! LIFE CHANGING!! Not only were they a huge hit with him, but this is by far, the best I've tasted....seriously, the flavors are awesome! Followed the recipe exactly except I chilled the dough 30 mins before rolling, and used apricot and seedless blackberry jams. I also made 2 cookies with plum jelly just as a test, and that was really good too! It made 36 beautiful, perfect looking cookies!! I had a lot of fun making these as he distracted me many times in excitement, :) ... My favorite thing about it is that i got to add the amount of preserves i want. ...My only regret? Is that i didnt take another reviewer's advice and make a second batch. To all those who said they only make these at holiday times once a year: I honestly don't know how you do it, but hats off, ladies-I'm not that strong. LOL I will be making another batch tomorrow cuz they're going fast...so irresistible..."
"3","4","Not too sweet, and they're moist. Easy to make, and they look elegant. FOR PEOPLE WITH FLAT COOKIES: try letting the dough chill, and rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour AT LEAST. Any type of dough should be let to rest after forming. Just cover/wrap it and pop it in the fridge. No need to add or adjust the ingredients."
"3","5","Very good and the almond glaze really adds to it. This is a great cookie to add to your Christmas list or anytime."
"3","5","I make these exactly as written (with one exception as to the forming of the cookies). They are delish! It's a great flavor and gets gobbled up quickly at our house. There was one thing I do differently: rather than make small cookies, I divide the dough into two logs, maybe an inch in diameter, 12 inches long, place them on a greased cookie sheet, then make a long 'trough' down the center (I use the handle of a wooden spoon), and fill that with jam. After they bake (for approx 18 minutes), I slice them diagonally and then drizzle on the frosting. It's very easy - less rolling - and so fast. They turn out pretty as well."
"3","5","These have been a staple in our holiday cookie trays for the past 3 years. They are soooo good and so pretty! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!"
"3","5","I've made these three times in two weeks, that's how great they are. :) The suggestions I took were to 1. add an extra 1/4 cup flour, 2. use cold butter, 3. use chapstick cap to make indentation for preserves, 4. freeze them for 10 minutes before baking. My cookies come out like the picture every time. Thank you so much for this recipe!"
"3","5","Very good! Mine flattened more than the ones in the pics, but still tasted very good. I am glad I added the glaze, as they look prettier and add a great taste to the cookie! Quite good!!"
"3","5","YUM! I absolutely love these! The only changes I made were to add 1/4 cup of extra flour, as another reviewer suggested, and I only used 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract for the glaze instead of 3/4. Mine did not spread at all, but after I pressed them and put the jam in the centers I popped them in the freezer for about 3 - 5 minutes before putting them in the oven. These are really delicious, and I'll be making them again!"
"3","5","I absolutely love these cookies, and so did everyone in my family! I did take the suggestion of another reviewer to chill the dough after making the indentation (I used the chapstick cap idea) and filling it with jam. I think this helped my cookies from spreading too much. These cookies took about 15 minutes in my oven, and are a beautiful addition to my cookie table this Christmas. Thanks for sharing!"
"3","5","Wonderful! Almond extract (not vanilla) is what makes them so unique in flavor. It is VERY strong though, so if you're not sure, cut back on it especially in the glaze. Chapstick cap was great idea to make the small indention. Oh, and use a good quality jam!"
"3","3","Not too bad...not the best i've had but my boyfriend loved them"
"3","5","LOVE these ! Refrigerated dough for few hours after making it. I used a pampered chef scoop (close to 1.5') to make rounded balls. Used 1/4 rounded tsp to make the indent. Refrigerated for approx. 15 minutes prior to baking. After 10 took them out of oven to smooth/add jam if needed to each cookie( didn't want to add too much; prevented running over this way)  Husband LOVES them and he is not a 'goody' eater by far.  A 10 start rating but you may only give 5 on this site.  Thank you for posting this delicious cookie recipe !!"
"3","5","WOW!!! So good! The best tips here: use the almond extract, make the indent with a chapstick top, pipe the jam in using a plastic baggie with the tip cut off, and refrigerate for a few minutes before baking. Mine were done in 10-11 minutes, but maybe that was my oven/size of cookies, but watch 'em. My first batch cooked a bit too long, but still tasted great, and then I adjusted the time."
"3","5","Fantastic! Buttery, melt in your mouth treats! Love the almond flavor."
"3","5","I made these for a surprise baby shower as well as some other cookies and these were the favorite! I did replace vanilla extract for the almond extract in the icing because the almond was a bit overwhelming. It was difficult to keep my husband away from them so I had enough to take to the shower!"
"3","5","Yum! I omitted the jam and nearly doubled the almond extract. I also put the cookie sheet in the freezer for 5 min before baking to help them keep their shape. Delicious Christmasy cookies! :)"
"3","4","These were good, the Almond extract wasn't as strong as I thought it would be & I used Strawberry preserves. Over all good and easy to make:)"
"3","5","I have been making these for Christmas cookies for the past few years and they are great! I haven't tried the glaze before, though, because I think they are great without it."
"3","5","I use this recipe without the rasberry jam or icing...if you like shortbread type cookies and almond extract these are amazing"
"3","5","i made these for Christmas and the recipe could not have been easier. seriously. It made an AWESOME tasting cookie, which was surprising, since there were so few ingredients. TIP: make sure the jam you use is really thick because it will ooze all over the cookie and they will be flat and crazy looking.. they were still good, though."
"3","5","really good. turned out great. a little sweet for my taste but i'll probably just cut the sugar down the next time i make them. and there will definitely be a next time!"
"3","5","These cookies were so easy to make. My family and friends loved them. I will make these over and over again. I do not like raspberries due to the tiny seeds so I used strawberry jam instead. I added chopped pecans to the cookie dough. The cookies were much better than the Pepperidge Farm version."
"3","5","This recipe is really really easy and really really good. I did refrigerate the cookies for 20 minutes after putting the jam into them. I had no spill over at all! The one thing I had trouble with was probably my fault...I had trouble getting the glaze to the right consistency. Everyone loved them and they are cute!"
"3","5","Perfectly simple recipe without any problems at all. I decided to add some grated meyer lemon rind to the butter/sugar mixture which gave it a little more depth of flavor. Everyone loved it when i made it last week so i had to make some more today in time for xmas."
"3","5","These are the best cookies ever and so simple! Only needs to bake for about 12 minutes (and they will be so soft. :D ) I used the back of a 1/2 teaspoon to make the perfect dent and found that about a 1/4 teaspoon of jam was the perfect amount so that it wouldn't overflow when baking."
"3","5","These cookies were perfect for a non-baker who participated in their first holiday cookie exchange. After the first batch, I realized I needed to follow the advice of the others and chill the cookies before baking for a more 'prettier' cookie. Using an 1/8 tsp. to indent my cookies and then again to fill with jam- every cookie looked great and tasted wonderful. They traveled well and kept moist until the party the next day at noon. Wow! Thanks for the great recipe!!"
"3","5","Perfect Cookies!"
"3","5","WOW these are fantastic. I was planning on making a double batch with my cookies this Christmas, tasted one, and immediately made a third batch to go along with them. I followed the recipe for the cookie exactly but didn't measure the jam; just put the (seedless) jam in a ziplock bag, snipped the end, and filled the holes I made with my pinkie fingertip to just as high as the rim. Not one leaked on me. Some cookies spread a little more than others, but all looked cute and tasted divine. I'm going to end up making these all though the year, thanks very much for sharing."
"3","5","This turned out great. Made exactly as written. Did read the reviews and used these tips from them that seemed to work. I used a chapstick lid to make the center holes, a zip lock bag with a hole cut at the end to use to fill the cookie with jam and I set them outside (I'm in Alaska) for then minutes before baking. Looked and tasted great. Thank you to everyone for their input."
"3","5","I read MarcieJ's rating and followed her tips: (First, turn the oven temp down about 10 degrees. Second, don't soften the butter before mixing, just cut it into 1 tbsp pieces and mix with the sugar. Third, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the dough. Finally, once you've filled the thumbprints with jam, put the whole cookie sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking) I used a measuring tablespoon to scoop the dough so that the cookies were uniform in size. To make the hole in the middle, I used the top of a small bottle of almond extract, floured the top so it wouldn't stick to the dough, and pressed it into the middle in a circular motion. It was the perfect sized hole for the jam. I also did 1/2 with apple butter and added chopped candied pecans to the top of each after they were done baking. So good!"
"3","5","Wowwww these are fabulous!!! I was too impatient to chill the dough balls before baking so mine did spread out and didn't look quite as pretty as the picture, but they are SO GOOD!!!!! The chapstick end worked very well for making the holes and the jam didn't bubble out or spread at all. The only change I made was add a little extra almond extract in the dough - almond is one of my favorites. I will definitely be making these again."
"3","4","These are great and super easy. I didn't have any flattening problems like several others mentioned and if you don't overfill them, you're not going to have any issues with leakage. I used vanilla instead of almond extract and they're really yummy. I used fresh blueberry and strawberry preserves from a local farm, and for the glaze, I added lemon extract...fantastic! I normally use the round end of a lemon reamer to make my thumbprints (my nails are way to long), but I tried the chapstick trick and it worked just as well. A keeper for sure."
"3","3","I really had troubles with this recipe, as it seems many of you have. I tried 2 different batches, chilling the dough before putting in the oven, etc... and they spread so badly they went right in the trash. After doing some research, I am thinking my issue resulted from using a silpat, which apparently can cause cookies to spread much more than they normally would. I will update my review once I try again on parchment. To the others who had a spreading issue, please let us know if you also used a silpat. I am giving the recipe the benifit of the doubt and giving it 3 stars for now. Update: It was not the silpat. The last thing I can think of is that my oven is getting way too hot. I will test this theory tonight"
"3","5","best thumbprint cookie ever. keep your butter COLD, cut into slices then pieces, use potato masher to mix with sugar (will be firm),use hands to mix with flour until pliable. chill filled cookies at least 20 min in fridge before baking. everyone will rave."
"3","4","Easy to make and few ingredients. My only complaint is the glaze...i'd either cut the almond extract in half or use vanilla extract instead or no extract at all. the almond is very over powering."
"3","5","I have been making these cookies for years and they always turn out astonishingly delicious. I had one of my friends almost cry on me when she found out they weren't Pepperidge farm and she couldn't just buy them any time. (That's a funnier story than it sounds ^_^) Anyway, there is a very simple trick to not have flat cookies- After mixing your dough cover your bowl TIGHTLY with foil or plastic wrap and refridgerate for 1 hour. The balls are a little harder to make but you wind up with perfectly puffy cookies. Also, make sure that you don't indent too deeply for your jam otherwise the bottoms won't hold together. If after you have baked them they don't look 'jammy' enough you can fill with a little more jam before I icing. (and to insert jam I always use a ziploc bag with on corner cut out)"
"3","5","I made these cookies this afternoon and they were very good. Having never made thumbprint cookies before I made a few mistakes. The first batch into the oven came out to flat and over done. So I corrected. The second batch I did not make the thumbprint so big and only cooked them 11 mins... much better. The third batch i only made the hole with my pinky and cooked 11 mins and they were perfect. Hub is presently trying to hurt himself and go on an all time sugar high. I did take the advice of others and put the cookies in the fridge for 10 minutes before cooking and it helps to retain their nice shape."
"3","5","great cookies. Received lots of compliments. They weren't too sweet. Looked great. Did not have trouble with the cookies coming out too flat. They came out just fine. Only mistake I did was didn't wait for the cookies to cool long enuff before adding the glaze. This caused the glaze to goop up a bit making the cookie less attractive. To avoid the cookies coming out too flat, only make a VERY light thumbprint. 5 stars!"
"3","5","Make sure to chill dough thoroughly before putting in oven so cookies don't collapse. A thimble worked wonderfully to create the holes in cookie and put the rasperry jam in a baggie with a small hole in corner to fill the corners. Also, use the almond instead of vanilla extract. I tried both ways and the almond was MUCH better!"
"3","3","The flavor was good, however for me I only got 24 cookies and i measured the balls to see if I was making them too big, and I wasn't. .. I also found them to be VERY crumbly and dry. I know shortbread is some-what dry I just wasnt expecting it to be to that degree."
"3","4","Ok...made these as written except used vanilla since I had no almond extract. Cookies are delicious, light and flaky...but mine spread WAY out...they didn't hold their shape nicely like in the picture. I am not new to baking, but admit I've never done thumbprints before...delicious, but not the dainty cookie I was expecting."
"3","5","I love the flavor of these. Yummy! Put them in the freezer for Christmas cookie handouts, so I haven't glazed yet. Used a cinnamon/pear and a strawberry/blackberry combo for the jams. Came out great, thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","So simple to make and taste delicious too. The only difference for me was I used strawberry jam."
"3","5","These are awesome cookies. My daughter's boyfriend said these are THE BEST cookies he's ever eaten. He calls them the Pop Tart cookies because he thinks that's what they taste like. The amazing thing is how easy & quick they are to throw together. I think it's very important to keep them small to keep the dough from splitting when you make the well for the jam. I use a 1/8 c measuring cup. This also helps make them all nice & uniform. I had some issues at first with the cookie really spreading more than I'd like while baking. I resolved that issue very quickly by, after making the indentation for the jam, I threw the cookies, sheet and all into the freezer for about 15 min. Then I took them out, filled them with jam & baked them. It resulted in very minor to no spreading at all. The cookies were so pretty! Also, for me the perfect 'thumbprint' maker is the end of the cap of an empty 1 oz extract jar. I just turn the bottle upside down, push the cap in a ways, give it a little twist & create a perfect little circle! I even tried this at first with a bottle with extract already in it & just cleaned off the bottle cap when I was done. I have a diabetic husband so I have made these cookies with Splenda & sugar free jelly & no glaze. My husband loves them and can barely make them last but a couple of days!"
"3","5","These cookies are delicious! The combination of raspberry, almond and shortbread makes your mouth water; everyone who tried these cookies loves them! To make a nice thumbprint, I used the back of my round 1/2 tsp. measure. It worked perfectly! I also made some smaller cookies using a rounded tsp. of dough. I used the 1/8 tsp. measure for these thumbprints. Thanks for a new Christmas cookie favorite!"
"3","5","I read all of the reviews and tried to compile the best of the best since so many people complained of problems. I added 1/4 more flour and 1 egg, per others' recommendations. Then I chilled the dough for an hour. I used my Pampered Chef scoop and rolled them into balls, flattening slightly so they represented saucers slightly larger than a quarter. I used the chapstick for the preserves as recommended - worked perfectly! I tried my first batch lowering the oven temp, but that didn't seem to work, so I baked them at 350 as directed. Mine took about 19 minutes each to bake. Maybe mine were larger? My batch yielded 32 cookies. I haven't tried the icing yet - they are delicious as is. But I might try it and see which I like better.  Every year for Christmas I try a new cookie. Some never make it to the dessert table and of those that do, most don't return the following year. But these are a keeper! They will be part of my cookie repetoire going forward!   Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","delicious, love the almond flavor. I used raspberry jam. I did chill for 20 min in fridge before putting in oven. Make double the glaze. Putting glaze in ziploc was helpful. Simple."
"3","3","I thought these cookies tasted great, but I didn't like the look of them at all. I took the advice of others and after putting them on the cookie sheet, I stuck them back in the fridge. They still spread out way too much. I wonder if adding a 1/2 tsp of baking soda or powder might help? Like I said, they tasted fabulous, but just not pretty after baking and spreading so flat."
"3","5","Definitely use more flour and keep the cookie sheet in the freezer between baking. I didn't have to freeze the dough the 2nd time I made these. Dough should be sticky, but not enough to stick to your hands."
"3","5","These cookies are a sure-fire hit with kids and adults alike! For my first batch, I used vanilla extract instead of almond (simply because I didn't have any around). Also, I found that I did have to add a bit of 1% milk to the dough to get it to form properly. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar as another reviewer recommended, and cut in the butter cold rather than softening it. Before doing anything, I refrigerated the dough for about a half hour - in the meantime, I made the glaze, which did require about 3 times the milk that the recipe calls for. After the dough had thoroughly cooled, I rolled it into about 1-inch balls. They looked huge at first, but baked to be the absolute perfect thickness. I should also mention that I greased my pan with the SLIGHTEST bit of Becel margarine and it gave the cookies the perfectly browned bottom that I love on shortbread. I made only about 20 cookies out of this recipe, but had no problem with them spreading out to be too wide. I used my pinky finger to make each hole - the key is to make the hole narrow at the bottom and increasingly wider at the top. Also, only make the fingerprint about halfway through the cookie - that way, when it spreads out, you won't have any jam leak-age! Lastly, I used 100% real fruit strawberry jam with no pectin and found that the tartness balanced out the shortbread to perfection. In the future, I would like to try an orange variety with a bit of orange zest added to the dough, orange juice"
"3","5","These were easy to make and yummy to eat..This is a keeper."
"3","5","I made these as stated and mine looked exactly like pictures and were fantastic!!Will do over and over!"
"3","5","Very good cookies! Very easy! great christmas cookies!"
"3","4","Great texture, but a little too sweet and too much almond flavor for me (and I looooooove almond flavor). I would reduce sugar a bit and use less, or no, almond extract in the glaze. Otherwise awesome."
"3","5","I received these cookies for a gift along with this recipe. I ABSOLUTELY declare this the BEST cookie I have ever had - even above anything chocolate! This recipe is at the TOP of my list for Christmas baking! These cookies are a must anytime throughout the year!"
"3","5","This is a really good recipe! I did make a few changes as advised by others so that the cookies wouldn't be flat. I also tweeked it so that they were as sugar-free as possible. I used spelenda for baking in the same amount as regular sugar, and then sugar-free jelly. For the frosting I used a mixture of cream cheese, spelenda, milk and almond extract. My boyfriend is diabetic and he LOVED these cookies!"
"3","5","pretty simple recipe and delicious results! everyone that tried them loved them! i had the same problem as others mentioned with the icing- i added about twice as much milk as it said in the recipe, and it turned out great! I did not have problems with the jam spilling out- I had the best success with using my index finger instead of my thumb and then made sure I didn't fill the jam above the level of the outside of the cookie. I also used raspberry preserves with seeds and it worked just fine. I definitely recommend this recipe!"
"3","5","Perfect cookie! Got rave reviews at work. I rolled them into relatively small balls and filled with a black cherry jam (also using a small baggie with a tiny hole cut out at the end to fill the indents in the cookies.) Mine did not spread very much at all in the oven - maybe because I made them a bit smaller. Icing was perfect. Thanks for this recipe."
"3","2","I always hate it when my experience contradicts so many other reviewers because I think I must have done something wrong, but I followed this recipe exactly and I didn't think these tasted so great. They were really bland...nothing like shortbread and I could not taste the almond flavour at all. Shame... because they looked lovely."
"3","5","This was so very good. I chilled my dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes as others had suggested and the cookies turned out great.  I used my own raspberry freezer jam that I bottled this summer and melted a little semi-sweet chocolate chips to drizzle lightly over top of the cookies. Raspberry and chocolate go together very well, and this was no exception!!!"
"3","5","i too used vanilla instead of almond. thougt these were good, and very easy to make. next time i will try the almond extract. i used the back of a melon baller to make the 'thumbprint'."
"3","5","I really like this recipe because it's a simple, no fuss cookie that looks nice. I substituted vanilla extract for the almond and baked the cookies for a little under 14 minutes (until the bottoms were golden brown). I really liked the texture--light, flaky and crisp. Personally, I thought the texture was much improved when I used margarine instead of butter the second time I made these. My roommate said that they taste just like Pepperidge Farm Verona cookies. I made half a batch (~20 cookies) late last night right before two of my roommate's guy friends came over, and when I woke up the next morning all the cookies were gone! Wow, what a compliment! =D"
"3","5","i've made these cookies three times in one week, they're that good. i didn't make the glaze because i didn't think it was necessary, and it wasn't. they're perfect as is. the only problem i had is every time i made them, the flour amount changed ( by very little, but still. )2 cups is about right, but make sure you gradually add the flour until you get the consistency required.   overall, excellent cookie. try them with guava preseves, those are the best."
"3","5","A very tender and easy cookie. I used the medium cookie scoop from Pampered Chef to scoop the cookies and didn't have any trouble working with the dough. This doesn't make three dozen cookies, then, but I had to double the recipe anyway because they were so good! Try apricot jam instead of raspberry. Delicious."
"3","5","These cookies were excellent. I followed the recipe almost to the letter. The only thing I changed was that I added a drop of green food coloring to the glaze to make them more festive for my Chrismas cookie gift baskets. I did not find them dry at all, they were very tender. I did watch them closely as I find that if you over cook shortbread they can become crispy and dry. Everyone who tried them enjoyed them. I will be making these again before the holidays are over. I used double fruit ultra light raspberry jam and it gave a more raspberry taste rather than a jam taste."
"3","5","These cookies are like no other! If you are looking for different..this is the way to go. They are perfect for tea parties and a nice addition to your holiday baking. They look very impressive. I couldnt eat more then 2 of these cookies at a time...due to the fact that they are very sweet."
"3","4","Like one of the other reviewers said you definately need to add some liquid to this or it's simply impossible to form. It just kept falling apart and then trying to press my thumb into the middle just made it fall apart. I added some water to it and that helped a lot. I started with 1/4 cup of water and added more as needed. It came out very good though. I'd make again, but maybe add a bit more sugar."
"3","5","These are excellent cookies, and worth the effort! The shortbread cookie is extremely light and delicate. Dough can be a little difficult to work with...add flour 1/2 cup at a time. When forming balls, warm dough in hands for a few seconds to prevent crumbling. Don't skimp on the raspberry preserves!"
"2","5","Very yummy"
"2","5","These are amazing cookies, always so incredibly tasty. These are definitely ones that get a lot of rotation. They are great to take to an event too because they look impressive and more taste good."
"2","4","These were good but difficult to make. Especially the glaze. Mine clumped out but I did not have a way to pipe so used a Baggie. The glaze got hard too fast would thin it out more next time"
"2","4","tasty even without the glaze drizzle, which i think makes them too sweet. would have given 5 stars if not for the slightly dry texture. i can't seem to press the thumprint without cracking them. but these are my son's favorite :) we make them all the time"
"2","5","We loved these cookies! I made the recipe exactly as-written, and they turned out absolutely delicious! I did add just a little touch extra milk to the glaze, because it made it a little easier for me to 'drizzle' it. A note I will offer to other cookie bakers: When it says soften the butter...you must ONLY soften the butter. Take a lot of care not to melt the butter.   The best scenario would be to have had two cubes of butter sitting out on the counter at room temperature and ready to go. Being that isn't very likely, using a microwave you need to take care not to melt the butter. If you melt it, the cookies will be flat, as some others have said. I put my cubes in the microwave on 20% power for 1 minute. After it stopped, I opened the microwave, removed the butter checked it for softness, and determined more time was necessary. I put it in at 30% power for 45 seconds. That got it pretty close...but to get it just a touch closer, it put it back in at 20% power for 35 seconds. Perfection. ;) My cookies turned out awesome! ENJOY~"
"2","5","I love this recipe!"
"2","5","This has become a family favorite. However, I did find the cookies to be done in 6 to 8 minutes, not the 14 to 18 stated in the recipe."
"2","5","I made these little gems yesterday just for a change in my Christmas baking, they are quick, simple and amazing, I shaped the dough into balls and refrigerated over night, the next day was a breeze the dough kept its shape didn't flatten out at all. Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly as written. Cookies were wonderful. Did notice that bake time was a bit too long, they were done in about 12 minutes. Can't wait to make them again :)"
"2","5","I absolutely love these cookies!Everything is perfect! I made a batch with almonds on top and they taste fabulous."
"2","5","This recipe is worth taking the time to rate. 5+ stars for sure. Wonderfully simple, beautiful, and scrumptious! I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed. One of my favorite things about these cookies is they are not too sweet. This recipe is going into my archives to make again and again. Thank you for sharing, Dee!"
"2","5","These are really good, with some great almond flavor. The cookie dough is really easy to make, the hardest part is getting the raspberry preserves in the middle of the cookie. Also I doubled the icing recipe because I didn't think there was enough on the top of the cookies."
"2","5","I loved this recipe. I changed it up a bit as people were saying that the cookies would spread and I already had a thumbprint cookie recipe that I made with buttercream frosting. I kind of combined the two by just adding more flour so that the cookies did not spread as much. I added more flour until the dough would stop sticking to my hands and would form nicely. I also used a Tbsp to make all of the cookies uniform in size. I used the almond extract, but for those of you who are wanting to use vanilla, you would have to add 4 tsp of vanilla instead of the 1/2 tsp that the recipe calls for with the almond extract. I like my cookies to be a bit softer as well so I only baked it for 10-12 minutes. I made raspberry filling and cherry. If you want to make butter cream frosting instead, the recipe I like to use calls for 2 Tbsp of butter (not margarine), 2 tsp of milk, and 1 c of powdered sugar. Just add more sugar to thicken the recipe or milk to smooth it out. Hope this is helpful!"
"2","5","WOW. Made with homemade strawberry jam and no glaze, but these are SERIOUSLY delicious!"
"2","5","AMAZING!!!First time I have ever made these. I followed instructions and took some advice AND put them in the freezer for about 15 mins, leading me to have to cook just a tad longer. bUT I AM VERY IMPRESSED! AND THEY TASTE GREAT!"
"2","5","I made these for the first time exactly as the directions stated and they were AMAZING! My husband keeps asking for more! I read some reviews and whoever said to use the chap stick cap to make the hole on top is genius! Thank you for that great tip and the great recipe!"
"2","5","i just made this recipe and it turned out wonderful but my only question is: Are you supposed to use Salted Butter or Unsalted Butter?"
"2","5","These came out perfect!! I followed other reviewers and put the cookie tray in the fridge for 15 mins before popping them in the oven. Maybe it was this that did the trick because the texture turned out great and the shape was just like store bought ones (perfect!).  Thanks for sharing the wonderful recipe - my girls loved it. The almond raspberry combo is super!!"
"2","5","I've made this recipe for 17 years. My glaze is 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract, and 2-3 teaspoons water. They are delicious. I have an annual cookie exchange where we trade a dozen cookies each. My guests always are asked if they would like to make smaller amounts to exchange and it's an overwhelming no because they all want a dozen of these cookies. I've NEVER had any difficulty with this recipe. I've even changed to vanilla extract for my husband, who does not care for almond. He loves them. I also make the glaze in a zippered bag and cut a small hole in the corner to put the glaze on the cookies. I do place waxed paper on the counter before drizzling the glaze. It's much easier to clean up, if my daughter doesn't get to it first."
"2","5","Love this easy recipe.I took other's advice and chilled them before baking.great tip.also,instead of jam,I used halved maraschino cherries.they looked so pretty.The colors will be perfect for Christmas cookies."
"2","5","My new favorite christmas cookie. They are so good!"
"2","5","I didn't have almond extract, so I substituted vanilla. I also ran out of butter and used 1/2 vegetable oil. I also used homemade raspberry jam that wasn't seedless. Reading these other reviews prompted me to try letting them hang in the freezer for a few minutes before baking. They took twice as long to bake, but were perfectly delicious!   I also tried adding some of my jam to the glaze so it came out bright pink. Cute and tasty, too!"
"2","5","I have been making these for years!!!! Everybody that has ever had these loves them... I think it helps if your butter is more cold than hot...not quite room temp. That is the trick to these"
"2","5","Anytime I bring these anywhere, multiple people ask for the recipe. That about sums it up!"
"2","5","Everyone loved these!!! TIPS... cut back oven to 325 degrees, used parchment paper, cut back butter to 3/4 cup, used hands for final mixing about 30 seconds, applied sugar to back of 1/4 tsp to press (keeps them from sticking), use the same 1/4 tsp to fill. My new favorite cookie. Only lightly golden where cookie meets the parchment. Omitted drizzle...sweet enough without. Still plenty of buttery taste with cut back and not too rich. PERFECT!!! Friends and family said they couln't stop eating them. Cooking time varies between 13 and 16 depnding on size. Used blackberry and strawberry from Cracker Barrel and my mom's homemade rasberry preserves. Homemade was best...thanks mom!!!"
"2","5","I made these with the ingredients exactly as they were in the recipe and they were delicious! After I rolled the dough and put the jam on, I put them in the refrigerator on the cookie sheet and they did not flatten out when cooking."
"2","5","I have been making these for almost 50 years. Chilling before cooking is good and always use almond extract. To make the dent , you don't have to go looking for chapstick, the handle end of a cheap wooden spoon works very well and if the spoon starts to stick ... dip it in sugar, makes a nice deep well for the jelly. Also, I have made these cookies minus the jelly and filled them with different butter icings for Christmas and Easter"
"2","5","My favorite cookie recipe EVER. Everyone I've ever made these for agrees that although the raspberry ones are good the apricot ones are PHENOMENOL… the bomb. I use a jar of Smucker's sugar-free apricot preserve. I find it easier to use my index finger instead of my thumb as the thumb leaves one side lower instead of an even indentation. Do yourself a favor, make a double batch."
"2","3","These were okay. If I made them again, I'd make them smaller (my fault they were too big) and go really easy on the glaze. But I won't likely make them again - there are lots of cookies I'd rather eat."
"2","5","These are the best tasting cookies. I love them at Christmas time. I recommend chilling each batch in the freezer before baking. They really spread otherwise."
"2","5","Very popular in my household and turned out fantastic!! Used by own homemade strawberry freezer jam and they were fantastic! Followed direction and did not double batch."
"2","5","delicious! Next time I will triple the batch. One batch was not enough!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe as is! Even better is the fact you can use the dough part of the recipe to make delicious shortbread cookies of any variety! I made this recipe with a slight alteration, I rolled half of each ball of dough in raw sugar, flattened it with a coffee cup, and viola! Delicious sugar crusted shortbreads. 1/10/15 addition. I made these for my niece who is ALLERGIC to dairy. I substituted Parkay squeeze margerin instead of butter in the same amount at the recipe and I used unsweetened almond milk in place of the milk in the drizzle ingredients. She loved them, they came out awesome."
"2","5","These cookies are so easy and so yummy, I think it's impossible to screw them up. Everytime I make them, they don't last more than a day. I increase the almond extract to a full teaspoon and I add about 1/4 cup nuts (chopped small) to the dough after it's all mixed. I've used a variety of jams and they all taste great."
"2","4","Easy to make. The cookies seemed to need a little salt. Next time I will try with salted butter. I used two long-handled dessert spoons to get the filling in the holes. Baby spoons would work as well"
"2","5","So easy, and so so good! These have never failed to please - no matter how many times I've made them, or who I've made them for."
"2","5","These were good. I followed another reviewer's advice and turned the temperature down 10 degrees, didn't soften the butter before cutting, and froze them for a few minutes before baking. Mine turned out still a little flat, so next time I might also add an extra 1/4 cup of flour, but they tasted delicious anyways! Oh, and I just used my forefinger to push the middle in, and I didn't have any jelly overflow..."
"2","5","I've made these several times and every time they are wonderful and everyone loves them. I don't alter the recipe except we use jams other than raspberry. I initially found this recipe due to a family members egg allergy but now I just make them because they're wonderful."
"2","5","Oh my goodness...these are delicious melt in your mouth cookies!!"
"2","2","Followed the recipe exactly (or tried to) and the cookies spread so much that they ran together. And 1 tsp milk isn't nearly enough for the icing - makes a paste rather than anything that can be drizzled over cookies. Very disappointed....."
"2","5","These were really yummy! I did add more flour, increase oven temp to 375, and refrigerated formed cookies prior to baking to help retain the shape...Came out beautiful!"
"2","5","Delicious! Made exactly as directed, perfect! These are my husbands favorite Christmas cookie!"
"2","4","These are great little cookies. Everyone who has tried them (and it's been a LOT of people) loves them. I often don't use the glaze. I like them both ways. Also, you can try some poppy seeds in the dough. Very pretty!"
"2","5","These sure are some delicious cookies! The almond and the raspberry goes great together. We made the recipe exactly as stated and it made a little more than 2 dozen cookies. We are going to have to make another batch because I can already tell that they wont last long! The flavor is so good! They do try to flatten and spread out a lot when baking, like many others have said. The best thing to do is when making your indent is to make it small and deep and leave the dough as much in a ball as possible, try not to flatten them much. Excellent recipe and this sure is a keeper! Thanks for this great recipe!"
"2","5","Delicious!"
"2","3","I found the dough did not stay true to form. I tend to like more jelly, but since the dough spead out so much, the jelly ran out of the cookie or ended up cooking on the cookie sheet. thou the flavor is out standing, the look of the cookie,, kind of a mess! the sugar topping, also out standing, but has to add more milk and extract then what the reciepe called for. all in all, great flavor, but not the easiest if you are doing this kind of cookie for the first time."
"2","5","Love these cookies! I planned on making 1 batch but ended up making another they were that good. If you generally find almond extract to be overwhelming I suggest using vanilla instead. My dough was crumbly the first time around so I kneaded the dough in my hands a bit before I rolled into a ball.  This did not happen on my second batch but I am certain that was because I only let my butter soften for an hour vs several the first time. My cookies had a 'cracked' appearance but I liked the look of them that way. I also used vanilla for the frosting instead of almond. I find too much can be overwhelming.  I can't wait to try these cookies with different jams!"
"2","5","This is a wonderful recipe! Make a batch this weekend and they were great! I used raspberry jam for the filling and because they are a soft cookie and I was putting on cookie trays I did not use the glaze on top because I was afraid it would make them softer. This will be used over and over again. Wonderful flavor and easy, easy for a cookie that looks like it took a long time! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","I owe you an apology! I found these last year and made them to go on my Christmas cookie plates for neighbors. I made them again in February because they looked beautiful for a Valentine's dessert. GK's and DH just loved them. I made them again in September for grandsons 3rd grade class. Not one has survived either occasion! Grape jelly, raspberry, strawberry and blueberry have been used with great success. I was just looking through my cookie list and saw them and knew that they'd be on this years cookie platters as well. My DH took Valentine Day cookie leftovers to work and i shared the recipe with 4 of the gals in his office. To say they are a favorite is an understatement. I'm softening some butter 'as we speak'! Thank you for a proven winner!!"
"2","5","These are perfectly simple and delicious cookies! I didn't have any of the issues mentioned by others and I didn't do anything special to any of the ingredients. My butter was frozen so I had to nuke it a bit to soften it. I mixed everything by hand. I used my thumb to flatten a middle part and then my fingertip to make another, smaller, dent - I think another reviewer's suggestion of using a small measuring spoon to make the indentation is a great idea! As long as you make sure the walls are closed, there should be no issues with the jam running. I didn't have any issues with the dough flattening - they baked into pretty much the shape I formed them in originally. I made 1/3 of the recipe for an even dozen to test these out and they were AMAZING with the blackberry jam I used! I can't wait to make more for the holidays with black cherry and apricot jams!"
"2","4","These were good and quick and easy to make."
"2","5","a little time consuming, but so good. Use good raspberry jam. Make sure the jam is good and cold before you assemble. These always please a crowd and will be making them at christmas every year :)"
"2","5","Refrigerate the dough! It makes all the difference. I used orange marmalade and green cake gel to make little pumpkin cookies for my daughter's preschool. So cute!"
"2","2","I cant even say how sad I was that this recipe didn't work for me at all. I made exactly as directed and even chilled the dough between baking and the cookies flattened out like pancakes. I'm not sure what went wrong. If I ever tried to make these again for kicks and giggles, I will use vanilla in place of the almond extract. To me the taste was overwhelming. Thanks for sharing though!"
"2","4","They taste wonderful but I had trouble with the icing and the dough cracking."
"2","5","These are sooo good. Make sure to make the balls VERY small or it just doesn't look as nice."
"2","5","Love, love, love these! My moms favorite cookies too! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"2","5","So yummy, and good to make with kids - they loved putting the holes in (using chapstick lid, thanks for the suggestion) and filling them with jelly. In my opinion, the more jelly the better."
"2","5","I made these cookies several times and altered the recipie based on other reviews. Based on one review, I did not soften the butter and had an aweful time trying to blend the butter and sugar together. Also, the batter turned out extremely crumbly and I had to add melted butter to it to get it to stick so I could shape it. The next time I made it I used margarine and simply softened it with the soften button on the mircowave and the batter turned out terrific and not crumbly at all! To make the thumb prints I took a 1/4 teaspon measuring spoon and used that to press the 'thumbprints' instead of my actual thumb. These cookies are delicious and were a hit with everyone! I will deffinitely make this recipie again and again!"
"2","5","I made these to take to the Veterans Home for Christmas. The only thing I changed was instead of raspberry jam I used Bosenberry. (It's all I had.) They turned out so good I did not frost them."
"2","5","These cookies were terrific and a dainty dessert to bring to my womans group! I did make the well larger and deeper for the jam, this way I had no issues with it running out of the cookie. Also, I drizzled the cookie with alot of melted white chocolate instead of a powdered sugar glaze, this worked very well and tasted even better. Finally for those who didn't like jam, I left a few wells empty while baking and simply topped them with chocolate chips while still warm after baking, and spread the melted chocolate around the hole. One thing to mention, perhaps it's my oven but I baked them less then the suggested time."
"2","5","Love these! So easy and delicious! To keep from spreading always cream the butter by hand, never in the microwave! The women in my family make cookies every Christmas and haven't added a recipe to the traditional ones until now! They are our new favorite!"
"2","2","Very disappointed, I bake cookies all the time, and put dough in fridge as recommended, and they still spread."
"2","5","Love these cookies. I make them all the time and am planning to try different jams soon."
"2","5","I made these for Christmas gifts. I got glowing compliments, and I didn't even add the icing! So much better than other raspberry thumbprint recipes I've used. The shortbread texture was perfect, and the almond makes it better. Terrific recipe! Thank you Dee for sharing it."
"2","5","One of my new favorites."
"2","3","Not very good...The cookies were a little denser than I thought they should be and didn't have a nice flavor."
"2","5","Delicious cookies added half tsp more of almond extract."
"2","5","Amazing as is."
"2","5","Our family recently put this on our favorite Christmas cookie list. And that's not easy!"
"2","3","these were ok. i really didn't like the almond extract flavor so in a second batch i used vanilla instead. still didn't blow me away. they looked pretty tho."
"2","5","First time making shortbread cookies, they are spectacular!! Easy recipe, I wouldn't change a thing."
"2","5","My husband found this recipe and made them himself! They were soooo good. Some of the best cookies I have ever tasted."
"2","4","Delicious recipe, thanks. Definitely chill the cookies before baking, helps to keep their shape. I also had better luck using a cookie pan with sides versus my flat air-bake sheet. Don't crowd them when baking. Tried several varieties of jam, all were great."
"2","4","I haven't quite gotten the hang of these cookies yet. made them twice and they seem to come out flat. otherwise the taste is spot on! I will keep trying :)"
"2","5","SoOo good!!! These cookies look so adorable and also taste incredible. The glaze is absolulty amazing. The cookies are sweet and gorgeous!!! I will def. make these again soon:)"
"2","5","These are wonderful and easy to make. I love the hint of almond. I used strawberry jam and they were perfect."
"2","5","Wow! Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but found that when I made the glaze that it was really thick so I needed to add more than 1 teaspoon of milk. Also that didn't make much glaze, so I ended up whipping that up three times (for every sheet that came out of the oven). We liked them more frosted, so you could probably get away with just doing it once and using it for all the cookies, but I have to say the more drizzle the better they were. They are SO delicious and will be a total hit over Christmas. Thanks for the great recipe."
"2","5","These cookies are delicious and perfect for the season. I followed the suggestions of other users, making the 'thumbprint' with my chapstick container and putting these in the refrigerator for 10m right before I put them in the oven. They turned out beautifully and taste great!"
"2","5","SO delicious. Definitely follow the recommendations on the first page. My first batch was flat and the jam ran like crazy but after I made the adjustments they were perfect. I used raspberry rhubarb jam and vanilla extract. I loved these!"
"2","5","These cookies are amazing! I made them exactly as the recipe calls for and had no problems. When making the imprint, think less thumbprint and more poking a hole with your index finger. If you create a small volcano like shape and make sure to press any visible “cracks” in the dough together before filling and baking you should be fine. The shortbread is so rich and not too sweet. The combination of almond and raspberry is delicious! These are now taking a place with the rest of my traditional Christmas Cookies on the cookie platters."
"2","5","Phenomenal cookies. These came out perfectly on the first try, following the recipe almost exactly, besides using margarine in place of butter, since I had no real butter at the time. Surprisingly they still came out perfectly. I made this recipe for my mother, who says her grandmother used to make them. I'm not usually a fan of shortbread cookies, and especially not almond flavorings, but these were just delicious, even I couldn't say no to them. I made three batches: lemon, banana and strawberry. The lemon are my favorite :)"
"2","5","FINALLY SUCCESS!! I had almost given up on these cookies--though they are super delicious, I have had marginal success with them in the past. The first year I made them, they were perfect, then each year after that I have had disappointing results with them flattening out, the dough drying out, etc. to where they were embarrassing to serve. I didn't change anything about how I made them, so I couldn't understand why this kept happening. But thanks to the suggestions posted in the reviews, this year they came out picture perfect and delicious as ever. Special thanks to 'sdk' for her summary of changes to the recipe. I will continue to make them with the adjustments from now on."
"2","3","Tasty, rich and melt in your mouth. The picture looks so pretty but when I made my indents the dough broke apart. I was hoping for a more presentable cookie since I was making them as a gift. The flavor was great so I had no choice by to eat the ugly ones! Darn. I would try again but soften my butter a little more and perhaps a little less flour??? The almond really makes the cookie so don't substitute!"
"2","5","I love the simpleness and taste of good shortbread and these did not disappoint. Followed recipe except for subbing vanilla extract and I also put the unbaked cookies in the freezer while pre-heating the oven. Instead of the almond-flavored drizzle, I melted about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1 tsp. of butter in the microwave and then used a fork to drizzle the chocolate glaze over each cooled, cookie. Love the raspberry/chocolate combo in any dessert. If you want true shortbread DO NOT add eggs or any other ingredients."
"2","5","Make sure you put the jam into a ziplock bag for piping it into the cookie centers, it makes it a million times easier!"
"2","5","ALERT!!! Do not try to bake these cookies without first chilling for at least 10 minutes...longer if you have the time. No tweaking is needed to this recipe other than that. I made my balls out of heaping tablespoons made the deep indents with a AA battery (funny I know), filled them with the jam and chilled them for 10 minutes. Cooked them for 16 minutes at 340 and they were perfect. Also I sprinkled them confectioners sugar instead of the drizzle. Sprinkle while warm and it melts in the jam but stays visible on the cookie and looks so nice!"
"2","2","The flavor of the cookies is good, but getting them to come out like the picture using the original recipe is impossible. I tried using cool cookie sheets lined with parchment, chilling the dough...I wanted to remain faithful to the recipe. They were still flat and leaky. They taste good, but they are not pretty enough for me to give as gifts. I'm sure there are better recipes out there, so I'm not going to bother with this one again."
"2","5","I made these delicious cookies for a cookie exchange and they were wonderful! The dough was rather dry and crumbly but they baked up beautifully and were very similar to sugar cookies. I filled mine with blackberry jam using a 1/4 tsp. to spoon out the jam. Apricot and strawberry jams are next!"
"2","3","Tastes like a pop-tart. Really. I made these and was pretty excited, but was underwhelmed once I tasted the cookies. If a home-made, better-for-you version of a pop-tart is what your looking for than go for it. Honestly, it just wasn't what I was looking for."
"2","5","Amazing!"
"2","1","Oh, my..... I am an avid baker and these were not good. My cookies spread and were crumbly. I tried chilling the dough AND chilling the filled cookies."
"2","5","These are wonderful. In my version, I changed the sugar to 1/3 white and 1/3 light brown, added more extract, 2 yolks & 1 TB water. Also the glaze needs a little more than 1 tsp milk. Yield: 39 I've been playing around with this recipe and with Rosenmunnar (also this site). This one is better IMO. Based on my experience and the comments of others, I think the trick with this is cold dough and this means 30 minutes or so in the frige & using stick butter/margarine, not tub or easy-spread. If it becomes overly softened, chill to re-firm before proceeding. Wait for the cookie sheet to cool completely before loading the next batch. After figuring this out, I had no problems with spreading."
"2","5","These were delicious. I made them for a cookie sharing party and they ended up being my favorites from that night (and several others' favorite as well). Delicious!"
"2","5","These are super yummy cookies!! In order to make the jam a bit more easier to work with I put it in a zip lock bag, just like the icing part. And put it in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds. This made it easier to handle and fill the cookie cups. I also did the same with the confectioners sugar icing part, which I really almost think you don't need because the cookies are sweet enough with the jam. They are good either way though! I did not change the recipe at all although being a novice cooker for this type of cookie, I did put them in the freezer after putting the jam in there and they did not spread at all. They look beautiful and taste super yummy!! thank you for a great recipe!!!"
"2","5","Great kid friendly recipe. I used Nutella spread, peanut butter, and lemon curd instead of jam."
"2","4","Stuck the dough in the fridge like others have suggested which made for better looking cookies. Like another reviewer said, these cookies taste better the next day instead of fresh out of the oven. These were good, but I liked another recipe that I had for jam thumbprints instead."
"2","5","This is a wonderful recipe for thumbprint cookies. I altered the recipe a little bit adding 2 egg yolks (thanks to a review) and using unsalted butter. Instead of using raspberry for the whole batch, I split it up and apricot, apple butter, lemon curd, and blackberry. They were all fantastic. This is a recipe I will keep for a long time. Thanks!"
"2","5","I made these cookies after seeing them in the Photo of the Day section of this website. They are absolutely delicious! The only change that I made, was using strawberry preserves instead of raspberry. My husband gobbled them all up! 5 stars!!! :~)"
"2","5","WOW - these are FABULOUS! I'm not much of a cookie person, but I ate these fresh out of the oven and could not stop! Made the recipe exactly as stated other than adding about 1/2 t dried lemon peel. Highly recommend! (They do taste best on the day you make them.... )"
"2","5","To die for!!! These are melt in your mouth DELICIOUS! I didn't change a thing ingredient wise, I just put them in the freezer 15 minutes before baking because I was worried they would get too flat without chilling. They came out beautiful and tasted even better."
"2","4","They were good, but a little too buttery for me. I think next time I will reduce the amount of butter and add a little milk to make the dough a little more workable. Otherwise, they smelled delicious baking in my house and were easy to make."
"2","5","ONLY MADE 20 COOKIES! Nowhere near the 3 dozen that the recipe was supposed to make. That being said, these things are terrific! They look just like the picture and taste delicious. If you need more cookies, double the recipe."
"2","5","These turned out fantastic. I did follow some of the suggestions and chilled the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes and used a chapstick to make the indentation for the jam. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. Fill the jam all the way to the top of the indentation, if you chill before baking, the jam will not spill over the cookie. I did not double the glaze and found that it was plenty for a light drizzle on these cookies. Delicious and can't wait to make them again."
"2","5","Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out exactly like the picture. I used the end of a lipstick to make my indents into the shortbread balls and the end of a spoon or fork to load the the jelly in. The trick for the jam not to spill is to leave them as little balls then just press in your indent. They will flatten a little while baking. Thanks"
"2","5","Excellent! I left the glaze off since they were already quite sweet. Just be sure to wipe the baking sheet off between batches- any butter on the sheet makes them spread enormously and become very thin, sad cookies."
"2","4","I followed it to a T and my cookies were flat but tasted good. Next time Iam going to follow MarcieJs review. Oh and use a baby spoon to put the jam in the cookies. It works wonderful!"
"2","5","Seriously great shortbread recipe. Flavor and texture are spot-on. I made the slight change of adding one egg yolk and maybe 1/4 cup of extra flour. Next time I think I may cut the almond extract back to 1/4 tsp and add 1/2 tsp of vanilla, as the almond flavor is a little strong for me."
"2","5","LOVED THEM !!! Even my mother whom I can never impress liked them. ~N~"
"2","5","Excellent recipe. I doubled the almond extract and rolled the cookie dough in white sugar before putting it on the cookie sheet. I used a melon baller to measure out the cookies and then used the smaller melon baller to do the indent. Looks a lot harder than it is."
"2","3","Very nice tasting cookie, however, the dough was very crumbly, and as suggested by others, I needed to add milk to bind. Also, was only able to get 24 cookies out of this recipe, not 36."
"2","1","I have regular looking flat cookies with blobs of my homemade strawberry jam in the middle of them sitting on my stove now. I don't have almond extract so I used vanilla, and I wouldn't think that would impact it. I also used freshly milled soft wheat for my flour (which I used a few hours prior for pancakes that turned out just fine). If these don't at least taste decent I'm going to be really ticked about using a whole cup of butter on a recipe that is worthless. And yes, I popped the cookies into the freezer before I baked them like other reviewers had mentioned."
"2","5","Very easy and very good. I had to add more milk, but other than that, stuck to the recipe exactly. There are so many reviews, the only helpful tip I can give is I used a tbsp of dough for each 'ball' I rolled. It yielded EXACTLY 24 cookies. And the icing was EXACTLY enough. Not one drop more was left of either dough or icing. That kind of surprised me for some reason."
"2","5","I was happy to find this recipe as my aunt makes these and I always liked them. They are pretty and taste so good. There are never any left when I make them. After making them several times I have learned not to use too much jam or make the 'thumbprint' to deep or the jam will seep threw the bottom of the cookie and make a sticky mess. The jam spreads out when it's in the oven too so keep that in mind and try to use a small round measuring spoon to apple to the cookie so they will be uniform. I have the glaze down now too and after trial and error in found it works best to use a very small ziplock bag and poke a very small hole in the corner to pipe it out with a safety pin. Using parchment paper is a must too."
"2","5","These cookies were wonderful and would be perfect for Christmas or Valentine's day. The dough seemed really dry at first so I worked it with my hands and that helped it come together. Then I refrigerated it for about 30 minutes. Form into tight balls. When making the indentions, press down slowly to reduce cracks. I drizzled mine with melted white chocolate!!!"
"2","4","Boy, other reviewers are sure right on the almond extract thing. I only had vanilla on hand, and though they were pretty good, they were missing something. Almond extract is a must! I used raspberry jam in some, apricot in others. Drizzled melted chocolate on the apricot, and the other reccomended glaze on the raspberry. I also refriged the prepped cookies as suggested before baking. They came out nice and tall, held their shape perfectly. I was thinking it might be interesting if I took some almonds and pulverized them in my mini food processor and added a bit to the cookie dough. A nice holiday/anyday cookie. Another idea would be to use orange extract and fill with apricot or orange marmalade. Fun,pretty,and easy to make."
"2","5","These cookies came out beautiful and they taste great too! To prevent the cookies from cracking, make sure to make the thumbprint right after you roll them. I used a 1/4 teaspoon to make the thumbprint and it worked really well."
"2","1","Doesn't taste a thing like shortbread. I was sorely disappointed. I expected so much better after reading so many raving reviews. I will not make these EVER again!"
"2","5","i've made these a few times now. the first time i didn't soften the butter (like the most popular review said), and i think that while it marginally improved the cookie texture, it sure as heck made them a pain to get the dough together, and stay together. as such, it makes for much larger cookies. and often the jam would leak out as the cookie came apart in the oven. if you soften the butter first, you can make smaller cookies, and easily mold them. i made balls, and then pushed my pointer finger in to make the dents, thumb on the outside, while spinning the little balls, to get a nice deep indent, but maintaining the integrity of the edges. also, you don't need to pipe the jam in. just get a really small measuring spoon. you can scoop the jam like icecream, and plop the dollop into the indent. AND you don't need to freeze them. just refrigerate until cold. especially because you don't want to risk the smell of freezer burn. and i double the milk in the icing, because it just wasn't runny enough to spread on nicely initially."
"2","5","Ten Stars! These are awesome! I took some great advice from others. I used a sandwich baggie to pipe the jam into the cookies and put in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. I also dropped the temp to 340. They taste delicious and turn out so pretty."
"2","3","I read the tips on how to chill the dough beforehand and increasing the oven temp to 375* to prevent flattening. Well, they still turned flat on me! Oi! I'm disappointed but found out that a cookie recipe with too much grease tend to spread. Therefore, I will try again with less butter. Oh, and LESS SUGAR...maybe 1/2 cup! These were a little too sweet for my Asian tastebuds."
"2","1","I have no idea what I did wrong but the dough flattened out on me. I wanted them to keep there shape in the oven. I was not happy with my results with this recipe."
"2","4","Perfect and easy when the suggestions are used. I added 1/4 cup of flour, placed in freezer for 10 minutes and baked at 340. Also, I used small sandwich bags with small cut to fill and to add drizzle. Make sure cookies are 'totally' cool before using drizzle. Will make again."
"2","5","very very good! it is really amazing what butter, sugar, and flour turn in to. My husband can't get enough of these cookies. I make them without the glaze too, they are very tasty!"
"2","5","Every christmas someone would bring cookies like these to our house and the were always my favorites. I decided to make them one year and my mom and I LOVE them. Thenks for the recipe!"
"2","5","Excellent, used the advice of others and rolled the balls the circumference of a quarter then used the top of a chapstick container to form the indent in the middle to put the jam in. I used blackberry jam and it was wonderful!!!"
"2","5","WOW! Perfect! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and chilled the cookies for 15 mins. in the fridge before baking. I also used a 1/2 tbsp scoop to measure out the cookies, and a chapstick top to make the indent. I did not experience any trouble with the jam overflowing or with the cookies spreading too much. I followed the recipe amts and ingredients exactly, and I will definitely be making these again."
"2","4","Very, very good. I did follow other reviewers' advice and changed a few things, such as adding a little extra flour, and not fulling the cookies to the top with raspberry jam... I actually wish I did, because they ended up not having enough jam in each. The shortbread is delicious though so it's alright. Mine cracked like crazy but I'm guessing it's because I'm an amateur... but they still held together. Also, for the glaze, I absolutely cannot imagine how 1 tsp is enough to get the right consistency... I added 1 1/2 tsp more to mine and it was perfect."
"2","5","Awesome, although next time i make them i might reduce the sugar a little bit. It seemed like a bit much!"
"2","5","I have been making this recipe for years. I chill the dough, then make into little balls. I use the end of a wooden spoon to make the indentations, and pipe the jam in the indentations with a pastry bag. Quick, easy and perfect every time!"
"2","5","These cookies were flawless! So easy to make yet so tasty you'd think they'd be more difficult. I substituted vanilla extract for almond since I didn't have any in the house."
"2","5","I thought this recipe was excellent. I rarely use white, all-purpose flour to make my recipes healthier, so I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the all-purpose, which really gave these cookies a nice 'nutty' flavor along with the almond extract. Because I used the whole wheat flour, I added 1/4 c. of butter (I used margerine), increased the almond extract in the dough to 3/4 tsp., and baked them 18-20 minutes. They were easy to form and fill and they turned out delicious!!! I will be making these a lot--next time I'll try them with blackberry preserves."
"2","5","I've been making these for a few years and they are always a hit on the Christmas Cookie Platters, plus one of my personal favorites. Some recommendations, make the cookies smaller than recommended, make only a shallow indentation to keep the jam from cooking through the bottom, put in fridge for a few minutes before baking to keep the cookies from spreading too much, remove from oven when edges just start to brown, and make double the glaze. Cookies are pretty and taste even better."
"2","5","These cookies are delicious. I must have made my cookies too large because I ended up with 2 dozen instead of the 3 dozen that the recipe yields. At first, I had trouble working with the dough, but the warmth of my hands made it easier to work with. You just need to hold the dough and work with it for a few extra seconds. If the dough cracked when I put my thumbprint in it, I picked up the dough and tried it again. They came out beautiful. I made several kinds of cookies for Christmas this year, and these were the first ones to disappear."
"2","5","OMG! The BEST thumbprint cookies ever!!! I was probably too busy baking and eating these last Christmas so it's been a year and I forgot to put up a review for this recipe! I followed other reviewers' tips (i.e. extra 1/4 cup flour, making small balls, using end of handle of wooden spoon to perfectly indent the balls, and chilling in fridge before baking) and my cookies came out perfect-looking and delicious! These are melt in your mouth goodness and one batch is never enough. In fact, I think I made 3-4 batches of these last Christmas and I may have only given away 1 of those batches in my cookie gift boxes because I kept the rest all for me---yes, me!!! This is sooo good, it should be illegal!"
"2","5","I just made these cookies today and they turned out beautifully. I followed another reviewer's suggestions to lower oven temp, add more flour and chill dough. They were perfectly sweet and delicious. Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","The recipe is perfect as it is. My fiance inhaled these cookies! Don't let their 'whitish' colour fool you - they are not meant to get extra golden, so don't overbake."
"2","5","WONDERFUL! However it took me two batches to get the shape right. I learned in the second batch to make much smaller dough balls. They really grow. Plus the smaller they are the less cracks you get when you thumb em. Plus I put the jam in a ziploc, kneaded it a bit and cut a tip. Squeezed into the cookie. Looked much neater and spread much better then glooping it in with a teaspoon. I also found that not chilling the dough and just keeping a damp tea towel over it to keep it moist worked out much better. When the dough was chilled it cracked when I thumbed em. I also put the glaze in a ziploc and cut a tip. I can't tell you how many people honestly thought it was the best cookie they ever had! Oh and even if they still look raw in the oven take them out at 14 minutes let set for a minute on the cookie tray and remove to a wire rack. This keeps them really soft, if you perefer softer cookies. Thanks for a great recipe!!!"
"2","5","I made all the changes MarcieJ suggested, and the cookies turned out perfect on my first try. Marcie's suggestions were: don't soften butter, just cut into 1TBSP and then beat it, add 1/4 c more of flour, put in freezer for 10 minutes before putting in oven, and bake for 14 minutes at 340 degrees. I also used chapstick cap to make the indentations and used strawberry jam.  For the glaze, I had to use 2 1/2 tsp of milk to get the right consistency and then I used a small syringe to glaze over the cookies (you can get one at a pharmacy counter - make sure it has a good suction). Great cookies and very pretty!!!"
"2","5","my grandmother and mother made these for christmas every year . they would use grape jam and then when cookies came out of oven would sprinkle powder sugar on them . you should chill dough first."
"2","5","I used vanilla extract and had no problem. My husband LOVES these. BC I had no almond extract I ground up almonds, and rolled the cookie dough in the cruched almonds before making the imprint and fillign with jam. Turned out GREAT!"
"2","5","Very nice, easy & tasty. A great cookie for someone who is looking to bake without eggs. Thanks :)"
"2","5","These cookies are delicious. They have become a christmas favorite in our house. I first made them after I got the recipe from a Land O Lakes cookie booklet several years ago. For those that think it has to much almond extract, I think it is because this recipe calls for it in the glaze, which is easily omitted. YUM!"
"2","5","I made these in mini muffin tins they are adorable."
"2","5","This recipe was so easy and the cookies were delicious! I didn't have almond extract, so I used vanilla and had no problems. The only things I did differently from the recipe was to use butter flavor Crisco and also put the cookies w/ jam in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking them."
"2","5","These are the easiest most delicious cookies ever!! I prefer them without the sugar drizzle on top...I think the icing is nice for presentation but doesn't really add much to the cookie itself except extra sweetness, which it doesn't really need. I would suggest baking these on parchment paper. They tend to get too brown on the bottoms if you don't and lose their delicate texture. I cannot get enough of these!!"
"2","5","Oh my goodness, these are amazing and remind me of my childhood. I didn't have almond essence but they turned out amazing anyway and taste superb. I noticed that even though the shortbread was a bit crumbly, it still help up in the oven really well and had a nice crunch. Once they cooled, you couldn't stop my husband from eating them, rofl."
"2","5","These remind of Pecan Sandies! I cut the recipe in half, added 1/4 cup of almond flour, and a couple of teaspoons of lemon zest. The dough was very easy to form into balls. I put them in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking, but this made them hardly drop at all, so I ended up mashing them down with a fork 10 minutes into baking. I didn't do the filling or glaze; they were great as is."
"2","5","These cookies were so easy to make. My biggest suggestion is to refirgerate the dough for atleast an hour before rolling into balls and making the cookies. Remember, they do expand a bit in the oven. So even though they may look a bit small before baking, they come out beautiful and delicate from the oven. And lastly, don't over fill the centers with too much jam. A little goes a long way."
"2","5","Very delicious recipe! The dough was WAY tastier than we expected, thus the recipe yielded several fewer cookies than expected. Do not leave these cookies or this dough unattended for long. :D"
"2","5","They were great made them for a family get-together(easter) and everyone loved them the great thing is you van use whichever jam flavor you prefer and it still taste fabulous, make sure to let your dough sit in the refriderator so it isnt sticky and hard to shape :)"
"2","5","An excellent recipe! Mine turned out quite well. I did have to add a small bit of water to the dough and some more milk to the glaze (which is optional).  Most importantly, I LOVE these cookies with a single fresh, crushed raspberry in each cookie in place of the jam. It gives it a more natural, unique flavor, and it's even more beautiful."
"2","5","Excellent cookie! I used Polaner blackberry sugar free jam....Yum!"
"2","1","Something went terribly wrong in my attempt to make these cookies. The end result was like eating a glob of jelly out of a sandbox... Extremely dry! I didn't even finish baking the rest of the mixture. Dissapointing."
"2","4","I'm only giving four stars because I had to make a few improvements. I had to add water to the dough, which came out way too crumbly. I added just enough to make a dough ball. I also had to add additional milk to the icing, as it was not even close to being drizzly.  On the plus side, everyone loved these cookies! I will definitely make these again!"
"2","5","I am a chocoholic at heart, but these little morsels have turned my head! I used a 1/4 teaspoon to fill the thumbprint with jam (perfect size!) and then put the entire cookie sheet in the freezer. Didn't need to bake them as long as the recipe says, need to watch them closely not to overbake. Used the trick of putting the glaze in a ziploc bag and cut the end off to drizzle over the cookies. Made them look very professional."
"2","5","I made these the other day for my son's bakesale at school and they got rave reviews! I followed the recipe exactly and got good looking and tasting cookies! Will be making these again. Thank you!!"
"2","5","These cookies were great. Very easy to make. My husband said I did not have to make any other cookie ever again. If you have trouble with getting jelly all over, try using a piping bag. Works great."
"2","4","This was a very tasty and easy recipe. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added about 2Tbsp. more flour, then chilled in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking them off at 340F. For the glaze, used 2 tsp. milk. My only tip is NOT to add the glaze until the cookies are almost completely cooled. The glaze just kinda melts into them if too warm. End result, a pretty and festive looking cookie."
"2","5","Fantastic.....the only thing I did different was to add a full tsp. of pure almond extract instead of the 1/2 tsp. I did need to add a little bit more milk also to the glaze to make a nice drizzling consistancy. Family loved these cookies, very pretty and flavorful."
"2","2","these turned out horribly"
"2","4","This recipe is the EXACT cookie recipe from Land O Lakes Butter recipe site (which is also posted on this website). The only difference is the glaze measurements. I've been making this for the past few holiday seasons. It's a very delicate cookie but very good."
"2","5","These were absolutely delicious, not to mention cute as a button! I substituted strawberry jam, and vanilla extract. Update: December 18th, 2007; I LOVE LOVE LOVE these with apricot preserves."
"2","5","I have made this recipe numerous times over the years and they are amazing. Everyone always raves about them and talks about them months (and even years) later. I follow the recipe exactly except I use strawberry jam due to preferrence. I also use a Pampered chef small cookie scoop to help make them perfectly round. Seriously, this is probably the most popular recipe I have ever made."
"2","3","I'm not sure if the dough would make a great thumbprint cookie but as a sugar cookie it's really good. It spread alot before it got golden and the jam turned more candy-like when eaten. Overall this recipe is good but not great. I will try the addition of flour as other reviewers has suggested and revise this review. In the meantime it's just 3 stars."
"2","5","These are the best cookies ever! I used vanilla extract with strawberry and pineapple preserves. The back of a rounded measuring teaspoon works perfectly for the thumbprint."
"2","5","These ended up being not at all what I was looking for, but delicious all the same. I added an egg and bumped up the flour by 1/4 C. I took them out after 10 minutes and they were perfect."
"2","5","Dee, thanks for a great recipe. I made these for Christmas last year and people inhaled them! I wait to pipe the glaze (keep it thick) unti the cookies/jam are cool; otherwise, it just gets absorbed into the hot cookie/jam. These freeze really nicely as well."
"2","5","My officemates requested that I bake cookies for our boss' despedida merienda. I searched this site for a unique cookie recipe that was easy to make and I thought I'd give this one a try. I baked a trial batch (18 pcs)and since I didn't have any raspberry jam at home, I used blueberry, strawberry, and apple cinnamon jams. I also twice the amount of milk for the glaze. They were a hit with my boyfriend and my officemates."
"2","5","Great cookies. I made these and several other cookies last year for a cookie exchange. This is the only recipe I'm re-using this year. I may reduce the almond extract a little as it was very strong."
"2","5","DELICIOUS!"
"2","5","These are nice sweet treats. Mine did crack a little, but they still looked good. I added 1/4c more flour and baked at 340 for 20 minutes. Very pretty and tasty."
"2","1","Oh, these were just awful. I'm making packages for Valentine's Day, and I wanted to include these, but they didn't turn out well at all. As a Southern cook from a long line of Southern cooks, I never thought I say this, but these cookies had way too much butter. Even after being chilled, they spread far too much. I tried increasing and decreasing the size, the amount of jam, the baking time, everything, but no matter what I tried, they turned into shapeless blobs. When I tried one, they were greasy and the almond flavor was barely noticeable. It's a shame, because almond and raspberry make a lovely combination of flavors, but not in this recipe. I won't be making this again."
"2","4","This is a very good cookie. I made it twice. The first time, I followed the directions exactly and the cookie lost its shape and swallowed the jam. The second time, I refrigerated the cookie after shaping it and it baked up great. Will make again."
"2","5","These cookies are AWESOME!!! My mother in law is diabetic, and I have made these several times. I subtitute Splenda for the sugar and sugar-free preserves for the jam, and they are just wonderful! They come out perfect every time. Thank you for sharing the recipe! They also look very pretty on a holiday tray!"
"2","5","absolutely wonderful recipe. I made 6 cookie recipes from this site for Christmas tins for co-workers. This one got rave reviews from everyone!!"
"2","5","My husband said that these are the best thing I've ever made. I didn't change a thing - Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!"
"2","5","AWESOME AWESOME..do use a chapstick or something similar to make your indention. And chill the dough for about 20-30 minutes to prevent spreading. They look better that way. I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of milk to the glaze. These are a keeper"
"2","5","Wonderfull, these are the best and so easy to make. I used a little vanilla and almond, left off the icing, it's excellent with out it. What I always do when trying a new recipe is just put about 3 cookies in the oven at first to see how they turn out. It's better to make temp, changes, size of cookie etc. with just a couple than a whole pan full. You really should try these and they stay nice and moist for quite a while. Thank you for shareing."
"2","5","These cookies were awesome. I made a few changes - i used black cherry jam and omitted the glaze. They were a perfect hoilday cookie!"
"2","5","Delicious cookies. Recipe needed salt, I added 1/8 tsp. As suggested, this dry dough also needed 1 egg yolk to hold it together better. The almond extract and homemade raspberry jam absolutely made these cookies sing."
"2","5","Excellent recipe! These cookies have become a family favorite, and the recipe is sooooo easy anyone can make them. I've made these cookies for parties and family gatherings. I like to make 'colorful' batches, by using raspberry, blackberry/blueberry, and apricot jams. You can use almost any flavored jam and the cookies will taste great."
"2","5","So pretty and oh my gosh...YUM YUM! I made these with a friend for Christmas and when I saw her at work the next day she said OH MY GOSH! THOSE ARE SO GOOD!' EVERYONE that eats them LOVES THEM! They are addicting! Once you eat one, you can't stop! My whole family is coming over for New Year's Eve and my brother in law requested these cookies. I found that I had to make the little dough balls TEENIE TINY to make the recipe stretch. If you want to make allot, double the recipe.  Update - EVERY TIME we make these people RAVE about them and say 'Those were THE BEST cookies! Can I have the recipe?' They are the best!!!"
"2","5","My cookies didn't look NEARLY as nice as any of the photos of this recipe. My first thought when I took the first batch out of the oven was that I was going to give it a bad review because they looked so...well...not pretty! But as soon as I tasted them I knew it was a 5 star recipe!!!!! I think these might be the best cookies I've ever made! I skipped the glaze (too much trouble) and discovered that by NO stretch of the imagination could you get 36 cookies if you rolled the dough into 1 1/2 inch balls. AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. BUT.... I got about 20 cookies from the recipe (dough rolled into 1+ inch balls) and they are so good that I'm not complaining. I'll definitely make this again! FABULOUS!!!!!!!! (I'd give it more than 5 stars if that was an option!)"
"2","5","Yummy! I took the advice of another user and used the back of my chapstick to make a hole and it works perfect! You can always make the hole bigger by swirling the chapstick in circles."
"2","5","I use vanilla instead of almond, and whatever jam I have handy - I have given these out at Christmas and enjoyed them in the summertime, they're so easy to make. I have made these so often - thanks, Dee!!!"
"2","5","Easy, delicious. I had to increase flour by 1/4 c. though."
"2","5","these are the best cookies i've ever tasted. i added more milk and almond extract for the drizzle to make it liquid.  but seriously, these are some good cookies."
"2","5","Very nice recipe. For half of the recipe, I dipped rolled ball in an egg wash, and then in coconut, then pressed a dent in the cookie, and added jam. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Dee!!!"
"2","5","WOW. I make lots of cookies and have to say that this is one of the best recipes I've ever made. It is: 1). Easy--most homes have the ingredients on hand. 2). Tasty. VERY good flavor combinations and the texture is perfect. 3). Beautiful. The cookies look like miniature Danishes! 4). Versatile. I used cherry, raspberry and strawberry jam and each was unique and delicious. As others have reported, you could also use chocolate to glaze, substitute vanilla for the almond, or use frosting to fill. One of my all-time favorites!"
"2","5","This is an absolute crowd-pleaser. I've made these cookies year after year for Christmas, and everyone insists I continue! They're easy and worth the effort. However, you will need way more milk than the icing recipe calls for. It's easy to guess as you stir, though."
"2","5","Excellent! Loved by all in my home. I substituted a half and half mix of vanilla and almond extract in both the cookie and the glaze instead of using the almond extract at full strength. My almond hating daughter was none the wiser and the rest of us still enjoyed a hint of almond flavor."
"2","5","I used two tablespoons of the flour for cornstarch. They turned out great. I also used unsalted butter even though it doesn't call for it. Best to chill the dough for sure and really don't over do it with the preserves - it will go all over if you over fill. 1/2 cup is plenty for the recipe. The hole you make for the preserves should be small but deep but not so deep it touches the bottom of the cookie sheet. Fill that with preserves but don't let it mound up at all with jam or you'll be cleaning that off your cookie sheet and oven probably. I used the end (cleaned) of a chap stick tube like another reviewer suggested and that worked well."
"2","5","These cookies were delicious! I should just mention that you might want to put some extra milk into the icing--there is no way 1 tsp. is enough. Maybe 1.5 tsp?"
"2","5","This is a yummy cookie! It looks pretty too. The jam is definitely a great alternative to candied cherries. I found the 1 1/2 inch balls made too big a cookie, so we made them about 1 inch. We also found the almond extract a bit overpowering so we didn't put any in the icing and just added more milk."
"2","4","These were lovely little jewels -- used vanilla instead of almond extract. I also used cherry, raspberry and apricot jams. Sprinkled with powdered sugar. My only complaint is that they flattened. Maybe next time I will refrigerate the dough."
"2","5","Delicious! Thanks a lot."
"2","5","These were very, very good. Be very careful not to overcook them, however. Also, with the icing: for some reason, mine was just a lot of crumble. I had to use about a tablespoon of milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract to make it runny enough for a glaze. And for the thumbprints, I wouldn't press your thumb flat on top of it. Try doing an upside-down thumbs-up, and stick your thumb in tip-first. One more thing: the dough has to be at an almost specific temperature to be easy to work with. For me, it was letting it sit in the fridge for a couple hours, taking it out, and microwaving for 15 seconds."
"2","5","SO GOOD!!!! I exchanged the Almond Extract with Vanilla!!! VERY GOOD!!! People want me to make this cookie over and over!!! GREAT RAVES!! Jessie"
"2","5","This was my first recipie that I've tried from this awesome website, and I used it as part of my Christmas baking. What a hit! The cookies were the first ones eaten, and the ones most often complimented out of a cookie assortment provided by three different bakers! It seems the recipe is pretty versitile as well... I used Boysenberry jam instead of Raspberry and I also glazed some of them and left some without glaze... it didn't effect the cookie's wonderful flavor either way. This cookie will be a permanent addition to my recipe file."
"2","5","Of the seven cookies I made for Christmas, this was the only one of which I made a second batch. These were so tasty. My only difficulty was getting the cookie bottom not to burn. I used powdered confectioner's sugar and doubled the milk for the icing. Yummy."
"1","5","These are the most delicious cookies, so buttery tasting. I made them exactly as written but I used my small cookie scoop and my mini muffin pan.....using the 'chap stick trick', they came out beautifully. I didn't use the glaze, just sprinkled them with a little powdered sugar. They make a beautiful gift."
"1","5","My husband and I loved them! They are so delicious. The only thing I changed was the glaze. I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract so the almond flavor wouldn't be too strong."
"1","5","These might be one of my favorite cookies!Mmm buttery goodness! So simple and delicious! TIP: after imprinting the dough with your thumb, put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes then fill with jelly and bake. They help keep it's shape better more like the picture. ??"
"1","5","My son has a food allergy so I had to use vanilla. My cookies came out perfect! I rolled them into balls (about 1 - 1 1/2 inches) and make the indent using the back of a melon scoop sprayed with some Pam. I also added some variety using blueberry and strawberry preserves in addition to raspberry. Everyone raved about these cookies! This is the second year I've used this recipe, it is now a staple in my Christmas cookies."
"1","5","Exceptional! I used a full tsp of Almond extract and refrigerated for 5-10 minutes prior to baking."
"1","5","Used half margarine and half butter. Used blueberry preserves, peach preserves as well as the raspberry. Sifted confectioners on top instead of the drizzle frosting. They taste better if they get just a hint of brown around the edges while baking. Had no problems with spreading or getting messy while baking. Used the half teaspoon on measuring spoons to make the indent. They were perfect."
"1","5","Follow the recipe and you will have no trouble making the perfect little bites of heaven. If you like, you can substitute margarine for butter with no problems. I have even used 2 chocolate chips in the middle instead of jam. They are perfect every time."
"1","5","Excellent. Used red cherry jam as filling. YUM! The second time I added 1/2 tsp salt to the butter and sugar and I liked them even more."
"1","5","The recipe is perfect as written. To prevent your cookies from baking flat, simply refrigerate the assembled cookie (IE, rolled and filled) for 30 minutes before baking. You do not have to add extra flour - this will only yield a tougher cookie."
"1","5","Um, it's insane how delicious these cookies are! I used blackberry jam this time and am excited to try other jam flavors. I was nervous at first because many people reported their cookies going flat and winding up with a messy jam situation the first try and I was out of parchment paper! Fortunately, followed a lot of the great advice from other reviewers and had no problem. I made the indentations using a chapstick cap and piped the jam in using a baggie snipped at the corner. Then chilled the cookies for 10-15 min in the fridge before putting them in the oven. For some reason I was hesitant to use the icing, I thought it would be over kill or something, and only iced half of the cookies. But I will not make that mistake again! The icing is a fantastic addition! The only thing I would do differently in the future is roll the dough balls a little bit smaller for a better jam:cookie ratio."
"1","5","At the last minute my daughter needed cookies for a class project. I was out of almond extract (used vanilla) and the powdered sugar and they turned out pretty good. I followed MarcieJ's (dec '06 review) and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, chilled for at least 10 minutes and they turned out nice & fat. I had a tray of dough in the fridge (for 20 mins) as I ran out of room in the freezer and they turned out a bit flat and the jam didn't contain as well. ;0( My 9 y/o son who helped with the rolling and indenting (used the cap of the extract) now wants these for his class holiday party. Going back to the store for more supplies."
"1","5","I really enjoyed these cookies, made them with raspberry and apricot. Next time I won't do the drizzle, it was just a little too sweet with it."
"1","5","Fantastic!!! Made these for our cookie exchange. I think it's gonna be a hit. They melt in your mouth."
"1","5","This is the BEST,jelly filled cookies I have ever baked and tried. Thanks"
"1","5","I have made these before but had a different recipe that called for egg yolks.   I substituted vanilla extract for almond because I didn't realize I had no almond extract. If you do this for the glaze, only add about 1/8 tsp of vanilla otherwise, it's WAY too overpowering, I also found I needed to add more milk until I got the correct glaze consistency.  OVerall this recipe is nice because it's less ingredients and healthier. I did add crushed almonds to the cookie dough and on top of the jam before baking which I would do again. Great flavor."
"1","5","I have made these for a few years now and everybody raves about them. The only thing I have changed is the drizzle. I melt white chocolate and drizzle that instead. Its much less messy and easier to pack and it tastes great. Susan T"
"1","5","I make these cookies every year at Christmas and they are always the first to disappear off the plate! I make several batches using different flavored jams or preserves - raspberry, cherry, strawberry and apricot are huge favorites!!"
"1","5","I tried several different recipes to know which we were making for Christmas this year. This is a definite one. I followed other reviews and refrigerated the dough and used the chapstick for indentions and they turned out perfect."
"1","5","These are easy and delicious cookies! I placed the cookie batter in the fridge for 1 hour prior to baking. Otherwise followed exactly. Did not have a problem with crumbly dough. I rolled into balls and then pushed down my 1/4 tsp bottom to create a small dent in the center to fill with with the jam. I baked for less time than directions called for. Like sugar cookies, you don't really want this to brown on the bottom or they will be hard."
"1","4","These were fantastic! I did have some spillage though, but that did not effect the taste, only the presentation."
"1","4","Really good, I've used raspberry, strawberry and boysenberry for the filling! Easy to make too!"
"1","5","This recipe was fantastic they tasted amazing. A little tip make sure there are no cracks in the cookie because the jam spilled out of the cracks while it was baking but some of them were ok."
"1","5","First thing I ever tried off of AR! Don't give it a second thought - just MAKE THESE COOKIES! I heeded the advice of Marcie J. in the comments, and even thought I substituted blackberry preserves for the raspberry jam, everyone loved them!"
"1","5","Very, very good! I love that they only have 4 ingredients for the dough. I made them with apricot preserves and they were delicious. Needed to make more of the glaze, so I would increase those ingredients to 1.5X. I also had to add more milk to make it the consistency I wanted. They look so pretty and taste so buttery. Great cookie to make as a gift!"
"1","5","These were sooooo yummy! The dough was extra crumbly and a little harder to work with, but it was worth it!"
"1","4","I halved this recipe, which yielded 20 cookies with my 1 tbsp scoop, the cookies baked in 16 minutes. I omitted the almond extract due to allergies and replaced with 1 tsp vanilla, I also used apricot jam instead of raspberry. These were a big hit with my Uncle and the nurses at the hospital."
"1","5","Simple and delicious. I have made them many times and people always rave. I use whole wheat pastry flour and freezer jam. Skip the glaze, you don't need it."
"1","4","Made these to round-out Christmas cookie tray. Very tasty, but a little more difficult to make- i am a novice so can use more practice. Like others recommended, used top of chapstick to make jelly holes- worked well- smaller/deeper wells were better than the ones i used my thumb with. Also, if i overstuffed the cookie with jam or made wide holes,the cookies cracked & separated. Will drizzle glaze over cooler cookies next time to keep from disappearing"
"1","5","These were outstanding !!! Deliciously perfection !! I didn't change a thing !! They were great ! Family loved them and they were gone fast:)"
"1","5","I meant to make these for Christmas, but never got around to it. Believe me, I will next year! Made the exact cookie recipe and used melted white chocolate for the glaze. Very light and delicate. I used a small cookie scoop, refrigerated the dough about 10 minutes after scooping; hollowed the center with the chapstick cap(!) and squeezed a dab of seedless raspberry jam in the pockets. Baked for 13'. No seeping, no breaking. Made about 4 dozen."
"1","3","I thought these were OK. My husband and son each took just one bite."
"1","2","It lacked richness in flavor. The shortbreads were edible, looked presentable, but the taste was way to sugary and not very good. Suggestion:  Maybe very fine crumbled almonds or pecans in the dough could add for a better flavor? I am guessing: 1/2 cup of fine crumbled almonds + 1 cup of flour (instead of 2 cups of flour)."
"1","5","Scrumptious goodness is a small bite. I used quart size zip lock bags (end cut off) for the jam and the frosting."
"1","5","I made a trial batch using other reviewers comments. Added 1/2 cup flour and put them in the freezer for a few hours before baking (with the raspberry jam in them). They turned out amazing! My husband would not stop eating them, I had to make two more batches. Took them to Christmas Eve and had multiple requests for the recipe. Sitting on a table full of other desserts, they were gone in minutes."
"1","5","With this recipe, I've just discovered a new FAVORITE! These are so easy to make, it really surprises you at first! And they are fabulous. They taste like they came from the finest bakery. And they're very pretty. I used 100% natural, high quality, preserves: Cranberry Marmalade, English Apricot and Raspberry preserves. All were really delicious. I rolled the dough into the full recommended inch and a half balls. I used the class shaped/standard 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to make my indentations for the jam. No spreading. No leaking. Just enough jam/preserves for great flavor and a beautiful cookie. And perfectly round even indentation. An incredible recipe and a hit with everyone. Rich buttery taste. Old fashioned. I will make time and again! Thank you."
"1","5","These are my new favorite Christmas cookies. I'd advise chilling the dough for about an hour, making 1 inch balls rather than 1 1/2', and using the end of a big wooden spoon, chapstick end, or 1/2 inch dowel to make the indentation. Be sure to use parchment paper; it helps them brown properly and prevents sticking. I used a sandwich bag for the jam, squeezing it through a snipped-off corner. I'd also double the batch, because they're popular and they freeze well. Don't substitute vanilla for the almond extract; it makes a difference."
"1","5","I am baking my cookies as I write my review. The dough was nice to work with. I didn't have any problem with crumbling. I didn't soften the butter too much before starting. I didn't feel the need to change the recipe by adding more flour or changing the oven temp. Really glad I didn't. The shortbread is BEAUTIFUL on the tongue! So flaky and buttery. I used the almond extract lid to make a dent in the tsp. sized balls of dough. I baked for 14 minutes and then put the jam in immediately after baking with a baby spoon. EASY PEEZY! I used Smuckers raspberry, but any flavor you like best would be great! I highly recommend making the recipe as is. On my next batch I'm putting them jam in while baking to see if it's just as easy. Thanks so much!"
"1","5","These are absolutely fabulous! Made them exactly as written, except refrigerated each batch about 15 minutes before baking. Used raspberry, blueberry and apricot jams. Next batch, going to add Nutella. Yum! If you are making these for someone else, plan on baking an extra batch for yourself- they're that good!"
"1","5","They are perfect!"
"1","5","i've made this cookie a few times over the years using regular raspberry jam and raspberry filling specifically for baking. the one for baking made a huge difference and didn't bubble over at all. i added one egg yolk this year, and the cookie didn't spread as much as in previous years. i also molded the cookies first and then refrigerated the dough before filling and baking. i like it best with vanilla extract for the icing, almond for the cookie. i put the icing in a zip lock baggie and cut a tiny hole in the corner to drizzle on the cookies. these cookies are a HUGE hit at the dessert table!! don't be intimidated by the multi-step process if you're an amateur baker. they really aren't difficult, at all. enjoy!!"
"1","5","Don't soften the butter. Chill the filled cookies before baking. Use a chapstick cap to make indentations for jam."
"1","1","the cookies turned out flat and thin, even though i followed the recipe exactly."
"1","5","These cookies were great! They turned out just like they look in the picture. Everyone that tried them wanted the recipe, even the men that had them. I made them 4 times this year already. I tried different jams, some I liked and some I didn't like as much. Try these they are wonderful and easy."
"1","5","These cookies were AMAZING!!!!! They're perfect as written, and I love the fact you can also experiment with different jam flavors :)"
"1","5","I printed this recipe years ago and have been making it since. It is wonderful. the only change I make is that I do not add the glaze. They are delicious without it. After the cookies cool, store them in an airtight container and they keep very well for days! Good make ahead cookie."
"1","5","These cookies are Great! I don't bake and they came out wonderfully! Did read the reviews and refrigerated them before baking. Came out just like the picture and tasted wonderful! They were so good I forgot the glaze but didn't need it!"
"1","5","I replaced the almond extract with vanilla extract because I am allergic. Can't stop eating them! :)"
"1","5","Awesome. I substituted vanilla for almond extract in dough, and rasberry extract for almond In drizzle. Rolled them in almond crumbs before filling and a powdered. I kept them verticle so wouldn't go flat. Keep em high. Freeze them whwn ready for ten minutes. Cooked at 340 for 16 min."
"1","5","Lovely recipe! I didn't have a problem with messy jam because I used raspberry topping instead. It is a little less sweet than jam and also a little cheaper."
"1","5","Delicious! I can't wait to make them again. :)"
"1","5","Quick, easy to make... and yummy. What's not to love?"
"1","4","I made these exactly to recipe and they came out perfectly! They didn't flatten out, and the jam didn't run. I do think I made them twice as large as they should be though, because it only made 15 cookies and they're pretty big. I baked them for twice as long (about 30 minutes) and they came out nice and light brown with bubbly jam. I waited a bit too long to put the glaze on them, so the glaze was a bit hard to spread... I'd put the glaze on right after you take them off of the cookie sheet while they are still warm. Next time I think I would put a bit less almond flavor in the glaze, because it's a little overwhelming."
"1","5","Simple and tasty, what more could you ask for?"
"1","2","Followed the recipe exactly; after adding the second cup of flour the dough turned into the shape of peas. Trying to make balls I had to dip my fingers in water because the balls were falling apart. Trying to make the hole, the cracked and fell apart. Also after 18 minutes baking, not anywhere near done. I kept checking the recipe to see if I forgot something. Also, the icing. You cannot drizzle the icing with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and only 1 teaspoon of milk. I will never make these again!"
"1","5","I've been a huge fan of sweets that use almond extract, but (at least in the areas I grew up) they weren't widely available. These cookies taste fantastic, have a very light weight and texture (I sift my flour), and satisfy both my almond and raspberry cravings.  I did have to make one alteration - I need to use 1 TABLEspoon of milk for the drizzle portion, or I'd wind up with very sweet cement that didn't make it on to my cookies until I added more milk and popped it in the microwave to 'melt' the hardened sweetness.  You DO have to use Almond Extract, and I highly recommend drizzling the frosting stuff on top (again, using the extract) as it helps with the flavor as well as making them look lovely.  They spread a good bit in the oven, but I had no problems with jam spreading and escaping the cookie surfaces - I just made sure the dips for them were deep enough, and didn't let it rise higher than the rim. One of my spatulas has a rounded end on the handle, I use that to form the dips.  The first couple of times, I got odd numbers of cookies - I've switched to splitting the finished dough into quarters and pinching off 8 cookies per quarter (adding and removing to make their sizes closer to equal) before rolling them into balls. It goes faster than pulling out a small chunk at a time and then looking at a lot of different sized dough spheres on the cookie sheet."
"1","5","First thing, these are GREAT! Now for the rest. Read a lot of reviews and here's what I did to get these perfect. Used ingredients as listed no more no less. I DID NOT use the icing and I'm glad I didn't as these have a taste you do not want to cover up. After mixing up the dough I did stick the dough in the refridge for about 10 minutes. Dough will be crumbly but the heat of your hands rolling out the balls will make everything OK. Fixed two cookie sheets (got 24 cookies total out of this)and after putting the raspberry filling on I put the trays back in the refridge for another 10 minutes. Because of this they took 19 minutes to cook. It's worth noting that the refridge time played a critical roll in the cookies retaining their shape. I used the end of a small juicer for the depression in the cookies and as a couple of folks suggested put the jam in a sandwich baggie, cut a very small corner off the bag and squeezed the filling out into the cookie depression. Works really well. Don't wait for Christmas to fix these...get in there now and fire up the oven!"
"1","5","My 6yr old daughter says, 'We really liked it a lot! Because the cookie comes all together with the nice sweet flavour of the jelly!' We watch a lot of food network together, hah hah. Really great recipe. So simple to do and tastes GREAT! My 6yr old basically did this recipe on her own. After the cookies were formed and filled, I did put it in the freezer for 15min to re-harden the dough (the balls were a little warm from too much rolling). No issues with the cookie falling flat in the oven. Ingredients were not changed. Texture was crumbly and cookie, delicious."
"1","5","These were great for Christmas."
"1","5","These were very good. Next time I will make them a bit smaller."
"1","5","Soooo easy to make but tastes like you spent hours making them! EXCELLENT COOKIE!"
"1","5","I loved the almond taste to these cookies. I will be making them again."
"1","5","I have to give it 5 stars because everyone went nuts over these. Made a double batch for Christmas. Don't think I altered anything in the recipe except when I was running out of icing into the second batch, I got lazy and just mixed powdered sugar and milk omitting the almond extract. I do think it's 'almondy' enough. These are wonderful and way easier than making Kolackys which are similar. People mistook these for kolackys. :) Will definitely be making these again and again."
"1","5","These are so simple to make! I looked over the recipe quick and printed it out as I was in the middle of a holiday cookie baking marathon. When I got to the kitchen I almost thought the recipe was wrong, no eggs no baking powder or soda- 5 ingredients that's it! I also suggest chilling the formed dough balls before cooking to help them not spread. Yummmm!"
"1","5","This was absolutely wonderful and was enjoyed and devoured as quickly as it was set out. We did substitute raspberry paste for raspberry jelly because the raspberry flavor is more concentrated and we like it much better. Also, we put the raspberry paste into a zip lock bag and snipped off a small corner to fill the holes with no mess or overfilling. This worked out beautifully, so we did the same thing with the glaze only with a smaller hole to add pretty stripes of glaze. Thanks for a keeper recipe."
"1","5","I have made these a few times now and they are so delicious! The first time I made them, I followed the most helpful review and added extra flour. Big mistake! Maybe that would work if you lived under water, but I live in a dry climate and ended up with a bowl of dry crumbs that I could not get to stick together no matter how much I tried. I has to add some water to get it to stick, it luckily they still turned out fine. Now I just follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great!"
"1","5","Yummy. Very easy recipe. Some of my taste tests it was hard to taste the preserves but it was still good. Did not add icing and it totally doesn't need it. Baked at about 335 instead of 350 for about 14 minutes."
"1","5","These are wonderful! As suggested by other reviews, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, did not soften the butter, and baked at 340 degrees. They came out perfect."
"1","5","Super yum. My husband loves these. I omitted 1/3 sugar and the glaze to make them less sweet. It was a definite hit with the family than my first batch. My first batch was exact according to recipe. Still very good just a touch too sweet"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious. I love the crumbly buttery texture. I agree with the other reviewers. Chill the dough before baking. I put it in the fridge for 15 minutes after I made it. Also, use a chapstick tube to make the indentations. It makes a little well that keeps the jam contained. Also, putting the jam in a plastic bag and squeezing it into the indentation is a very helpful tip. One comment I have is that I don't think the milk amount for the glaze is enough. I think it should be one tablespoon of milk. When I use the ratios as written the glaze was just crumbly. I had to add more milk to make it smooth. Overall, a delish recipe. Might be my new go-to recipe for X-mas cookie exchanges."
"1","5","We love this recipe! It is an annual tradition in my home to make these around the holidays. I do switch up the jam this year it's TOE (tangerine, orange and elederberry) jam and Blueberry jam from a local mennonite shop."
"1","5","Followed recipe exactly. I did put the batter in the fridge to chill before baking them. They turned out great. This was such a easy recipe and oh so delicious. Definitely a keeper"
"1","4","These were yummy. I love almond, so I increased the almond extract to 1 tsp. Dough was easy to work with, and the cookies came out perfect. They had a nice light crunch after they cooled, but by the next day, they had a softer crumb due to the moisture of the jam. I had stored them in a loose container, but maybe I should have left them uncovered altogether?"
"1","5","Love - love- love this recipe. So simple and the shortbread cookie can be used in so many ways, not just for jam. I have made the cookie with no jam, have coated with chocolate...so many options. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!"
"1","5","quick & easy to prepare.I made 6 doz. of these for Christmas cookies.In each 1/3 batch I used either pineapple,strawberry or blueberry preserves.They were almost as pretty as stained glass window cookies.this recipe is definitely a 'keeper'!"
"1","5","I made this exactly like the recipe, nothing different, and it came out exactly as it should and looked decadent. I got fooled by the colour, shortbread is usually white so it always looks like it is not done as yet so be sure to follow the time."
"1","5","Usually I don't think to make these cookies until Christmastime. I wonder why? This recipe has simple delicious ingredients. The jam makes them perfectly sweet while the shortbread melts in your mouth. I used a non-stick mini muffin pan dropping the dough into the wells after rolling into 1 inch balls. Making the dough balls smaller decreased the baking time to 9-11 minutes. After removing the tray from the oven I immediately made the 'thumbprints' with the flip side of my pestle, floured. I let them cool in the pan. The cookies came out of the non-stick beautifully. Filled the wells with seedless raspberry jam and drizzled with the icing."
"1","5","Why did I wait so long to make these....yumm! Fun and easy to make. Made as is except used vanilla extract instead of almond. To make the indents, I went through my kitchen drawers and found one of those infant/toddlers spoon medicine measuring device (spoon top w/ round bottom). Although, I think I went a little deep on the indents because while the cookies were baking, it stretched and the jams didn't quite fill in the hole. Or maybe I didn't fill enough or stick with the chapstick cap idea. I wanted to drizzle icing on them but the hungry people couldn't wait to taste."
"1","5","Delicious !!!! Follow recipe as it is for cookies.. didnt use the glaze part just sprinkle a little confecctioner sugar on the top. They taste so good... hard to saving them for my party tomorrow !!!"
"1","5","Great flavor and easy to make! I used cherry pie filling at my husband's request and they came out great! I used a previous reviewer's suggestion of the chapstick to make the hole and it was wonderful!"
"1","5","I used boysenberry preserves (Trader Joe's) instead of raspberry, vanilla extract instead of almond, and omitted the glaze. I didn't have the problem with the cookies spreading like other users have experienced. All of my friends loved them! One even said it was the best cookie I've ever made. I want to try using other fillings. I saw a recipe in a random blog with dulce de leche filling with a chocolate drizzle. I think that will be my next attempt at these"
"1","5","I use the cap off of the vanilla extract bottle to ensure a consistent, perfectly round indentation for the jam filling, makes the cookies look professional. This is a tasty recipe as written, but also good with apricot preserves instead of raspberry."
"1","2","I have yet to try these cookies, but I just took them out of the oven and they look like giant bloody eyeballs! Also, the jam spilled out on a few of them, which was my fault. I also skipped the glaze. But, overall, they look more halloween appropriate than teacher appreciation week appropriate. I might change my mind after I try them, though!"
"1","5","Made these for a 'High Tea' today. I had 63 women telling me they were the best cookies they have ever tasted. I did not even drizzle the icing since I had so many other things to do. I used the Chapstick as someone suggested and it worked like a gem. The cookies looked perfect. Thanks a million."
"1","5","Excellent-don't overbake or they don't stay as soft."
"1","5","We made them once with a white chocolate drizzle and another with the sugguested drizzle (confectioners' sugar, almond extract, and milk). The homemade topping was so much better. We used soy milk instead of milk but it still came out so tastilicious."
"1","5","Wow!! Quite possibly my favorite cookie of all time, and I just love how easy, quick, and the low amount of ingredients needed. I did press down the center a little too much on a few in the first batch and the jelly went through. The 2nd batch I pressed lighter and they came out great. And just a tip... space them apart enough or they'll run in together."
"1","4","Great cookies! I had such a hard time putting the dough together so I took about a tsp of butter and rubbed with my hand and worked the dough. Chilling the dough definitely helps -- I chilled it before I shaped into small balls AND after I got them ready to be baked. I used jam, almond, and chocolate pieces for 'topping' (of course not all together, my cookies were too small for even 1 tsp of jam. I used about 1/4 tsp of jam per cookies.). My family liked them all!"
"1","1","I made these for my dad because every Christmas, he tells us all about his grandma's thumbprints. They were dry and crumbly and overall, just not that good. My family LOVES Christmas cookies and usually devours anything, but these were still around on New Year's Day, so they got pitched. I really wanted this simple recipe to work, but it didn't, and needs some more of the classic shortbread ingredients."
"1","5","Exactly what I was searching for! Big hit at an adult Christmas party as well as with the kids. I wait until the cookie is thoroughly cooled before drizzling the sugar mix. A Wilton tip / bag worked better here than a Ziploc bag with the corner cut. These disappear quickly, so make a second batch!!!"
"1","3","I made these for xmas and i did several small batches to try to get them to set up right but it never happened but still tasted yummy"
"1","5","I used guava paste in the center and taste great, the texture was great."
"1","5","I made these for Christmas and they were a big hit. Everyone asked for the recipe and they vanished from the plate. Thanks for the yummy recipe!"
"1","5","Used black-raspberry seedless preserves: very good!"
"1","1","I followed the recipe except followed recommendations of others (for example I used butter straight from the refrig and didnt soften it, and also I put the dough in freezer before and after shaping into cookies). I didnt have any problem with cookies flattening at all. My problem only is that no one though cookies tasted good. I think I would take someone elses advice and use vanilla flavoring instead of almond...or find another recipe. Sorry...."
"1","5","Loveee these cookies sub the almond with vanilla followed other reviews and chilled them before baking these were gone within 15 or less minutes making another batch now yumm"
"1","5","Simple and delicious! First attempt, cookies came out flat. Second attempt I rolled the cookies into the 1/2 inch balls which worked beautifully! Allow the cookies to cool completely before drizzling the icing. MMMM MMMM Good!"
"1","5","Yum! Easy to mix up and hard to put down! I do not possess great baking prowess, but I followed some of the hints from previous reviews and these were a big hit! Kept the balls small, used a lip-balm lid to make jam wells, chilled prior to baking, and was careful not to over-bake them, removing them from the oven when the edges barely began to brown. The only disappointment was that I ran out of ingredients and couldn't make a 3rd batch!"
"1","5","Best cookies!!! These are the first cookies to go at Christmas parties!"
"1","1","I'm glad this cookie worked out for some people. I was VERY disappointed in the outcome. They spread out everywhere and made nothing but a mess. I was not happy to waste all the ingredients. They spread out so much I didnt even let them finish baking. NEVER making again."
"1","5","This is a really good cookie!!! Made it just as the recipe is written. I took some advice and chilled the dough in the fridge a bit before rolling the balls. Mine did flatten out some but there was not any jam spill over at all, I just filled the hole I made to the top and as the cookie spread the jam filled it nicely. This was the fastest cookie I have ever made, I made it for a cookie exchange and I had to bake over 90, it was fast!! Good luck not eating the dough before it is baked:) YUMMY!!!"
"1","5","very easy and oh so good...i will make these again .."
"1","5","Great combo of flavors with the almond, raspberry and shortbread. Recommend chilling the dough and making one inch rounds for a daintier and higher cookie. Needed to double the icing. Great for the holidays. Very showy for gift presentation."
"1","5","Perfect. using vanilla extract for the icing is soooo much better. too much almond made me gag. CROWD FAVORITE!"
"1","5","I love these! Made them as the recipe describes and they are delicate, they melt in your mouth and have a rich buttery, almond flavor and then the raspberry just adds more flavor.. Excellent."
"1","1","I absolutely love thumbprint cookies and shortbread, but I was very disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted like pure sugar, I couldn't even taste the butter. The texture was crumbly (like a shortbread) but not melt in your mouth (like a shortbread). I couldn't even finish 1 cookie before I threw it away, just because of the taste. My husband felt the same way. I'm no novice to baking, people love my baked goods and breads, so I'm assuming it was the recipe itself."
"1","2","the first time i made it, it turned excellent just little burned. but the second time i made it[ i was going to make it for a party over 126 people] it didn't work for me. it didn't cook it flatten into a pancake so it looked like a cake with jelly holes. i ended up giving the guests nothing. totally a rcipe you dont wnat to share with your family."
"1","5","These are a delicious cookie that are quick and easy to make...I used peach jam instead of raspberry. My family loved them."
"1","5","One of my favs :)"
"1","5","These are wonderful! They are super easy to make and I already had all of the ingredients on hand, except for the raspberry jam. I substituted blackberry jam and they were delicious!"
"1","5","Really good and easy"
"1","1","They just aren't very good. Spend your time making almost anything else."
"1","5","This cookie is awesome. The flavor is wonderful. Make sure the indention is big enough in the cookie and then I use and decorating bag, cut off the end of it to put the jelly in, it makes it easier and less mess. I also use a bag for the glaze. This is my number one selling cookie in my shop. Thank you for the recipe. There is no need to change anything, except a little more milk in the glaze. I'm gonna make them just plain next time, sure it will be just as good."
"1","5","Super little cookie! Just make sure you use a good jam to fill them with (I used a cheap apricot jam & they would have been so much better with a good jam). I didn't add the drizzled icing as they were sweet enough as is."
"1","5","My go to shortbread cookie! But for some reason this time they went flat. Here is why. When I got done I saw that I still had flour left in my measuring cup. So not only did I NOT add an extra 1/4 cup I excluded about 1/4 of a cup! They came out flat but delicate and delicious! I have made this with vanilla in the past and never went flat. It was the flour...No doubt. I made another batch this morning, added the EXTRA 1/4 of a cup and they came out like they were supposed to. Vanilla or Almond extract works fine. FLOUR IS THE KEY. Happy baking!!! Oh yea, I also reduced the sugar a tiny bit...the sweet from the raspberry is perfect."
"1","5","I had trouble making these round, they tended to look like playdoh globs. (probably my fault!) So what I did was poured all the dough onto parchment paper lining in the cookie sheet, then slapped another piece of parchment paper on top and rolled them to about 1/4 an inch thick. then i cut them into squares (about 1 1/2 inch) and pushed my thumb into them to make an oval impression. hold the edge side opposite your thumb and they should retain their nice shape. Filled it with a little glob of jam - mine didnt spread, publix brand raspberry seedless. As a finisher, I drizzled white chocolate over the whole batch in thin stripes. They look lovely and knock your socks off."
"1","5","The BEST cookies on this site. My mom literally orders me to make these for here for her birthday, mother's day, Christmas...the list goes on! They are delicious."
"1","4","These little babies are so delicious! I used salted butter bc that's all I had on hand although I usually always use unsalted but you couldn't taste the saltiness at all, I used my homeade strawberry jam that I make in the summer on half of the cookies and then a sugar free storebought black cherry jam on the other half. I made the dough, shaped into 40 quarter sized balls and put them on a parchment paper lined sheet tray, I made indents with a chapstick like others had advised and baked them 12 minutes. Oh, I also used one Cup ap flour and one cup cake flour which I really think made a difference. Next time I make these I will make deeper indentations and double the glaze recipe bc th first batch only covered half of my cookies. I ended up having to add a little more jam to each cookie after they baked bc there wasn't enough but that wasn't a big deal. They were buttery and soft with just enough crisp. So good! For such a little cookie these little sweeties sure pack a lot of flavor! I will definetly be making these again."
"1","5","Great recipe! I substituted some fudge frosting for the raspberry preserves and they turned out great! Followed the recipe to a t and baking time was exactly 14 mins! Thanks so much for sharing! I also submitted a picture with the chocolate frosting."
"1","5","Followed everything, except I replaced almond extract with vanilla. Not a fan of almond. Didn't do frosting either. THIS IS DELICIOUS. (and very easy)"
"1","5","To die for! Totally buttery and melt in your mouth awesome!"
"1","5","One of the best cookie recipes I have ever made!!!!"
"1","5","I made these to go in my Christmas goody gift bags for staff & clients. Oh my gosh. These little things are good. They're tender & literally melt in your mouth. I was thinking that the raspberry wouldn't be that good, but OH MY GOODNESS...amazing. Everyone raved about them!"
"1","5","Wonderful!"
"1","4","followed recipe the only thing wrong is the icing it should be a tblspn instead of tspn"
"1","5","Awesome cookies! I made one batch and they are so good I had to make a second. I added one tsp of vanilla to the recipe, so so so good. I also did not use the glaze but im going to try it next time."
"1","5","Delicious!"
"1","4","These cookies were ok, I've had much better shortbread cookies. I followed the recipe and these cookies held their shape. They did not spread like others wrote and I was hoping they would spread. To make them taste better I dipped them in chocolate. That worked wonders."
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. I cannot figure out how people made this. I chilled the dough. Added 1/4 cup extra flour. Only used real butter. The cookies spread EVERYWHERE. They didn't hold their shape at all. I'm never making this again."
"1","5","The Danish side of my family love these cookies!!! Easy and delicious. Before baking them I put them in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up, otherwise they fall flat while baking (happened to me last week.) This recipe is a keeper! Thank you:)"
"1","5","A great holiday cookie. As I have a child that is allergic to all nuts, I exchanged vanilla extract for the almond extract. This turned out just fine. I also make homemade strawberry jam, so used it instead of raspberry. Wonderful cookie. Tasted fantstic and looked beautiful, too."
"1","5","I've made a lot of cookies but I have to tell you these are the best cookies I've ever made"
"1","5","These cookies are DELICIOUS! Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the ones in the picture (they cracked a little), but they tasted awesome. This recipe is definitely one of my favorites and will be a regular in my Christmas cookie making. Thanks for the great recipe! P.S. I needed to add more milk in the glaze."
"1","5","These were delicious - easy- made from pantry items and looked so pretty on my Christmas cookie trays! I had leftover pastry fruit filling so I divided the dough in 3 portions. I added lemon extract to the lemon curd cookies, Almond extract to the cherry and vanilla to the apricot cookies. Will make again!"
"1","5","These were yummy and everyone at work LOVED them! I took the others reviewers advice and froze the cookies prior to baking. I still managed to have them look a little messy, but with the dizzle, you could hardly tell."
"1","5","These are excellent! First time making thumbprint cookies and I made some mistakes. On batch 3 in 5 days and love them. Do listen to the yield - 36 cookies for the recipe... balls slightly smaller than described. Make balls, add hole (I use the flat end of a wine stopper), reform cracked edges if necessary, refrigerate for 10 minutes, fill with 1/4 TSP heated jam (I used boysenberry), don't overcook! I drizzled with bittersweet chocolate chips melted with a dab of butter. Perfect!"
"1","5","Super-easy and absolutely delicious! I agree with CuppaTeaGirl; add the jam after they've baked for best results and you'll have no need to modify recipe or worry about cracks or running. A holiday favorite, thank you!"
"1","5","These were delicious and easy to make. I did not add more flour as others did and had no problem with the dough until the last few cookies - I think the dough had warmed up too much because they spread quite a bit and were very unattractive. But the rest were fine! I ended up using a teaspoon measuring spoon (very round, bowl-shaped) to make the indentations, and I found stirring up the preserves made it easier to fill the cookies. Great cookie!"
"1","3","I wouldn't add more flour, as this made the dough really difficult to shape into balls despite chilling as well as possibly causing the cookie to taste like pie crust made with shortening. Use a good quality jam."
"1","5","These are really delicious. I chilled the dough for 20 minutes after forming the cookies and that helped them not to spread. Also, make them small - they won't spread that way."
"1","5","Made only 1 modification, added an additional 1/4 cup flour to help keep the dough from spreading too much. Worked perfectly! The cookies were great, not too sweet."
"1","5","This is a keeper! I used home made strawberry jam & raspberry jam as filling. The raspberry jam was the best it tasted like Fisher's Scones! Thank you for the best cookie recipe!"
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!!! These were so good! I did put them in the freezer for about 7 minutes so they would not spill over the sides and that worked. Mine don't look quite like the picture, probably need a bigger cookie scooper so I can make a bigger indentation. But they taste great!"
"1","5","These cookies are divine! A new favorite for the Holidays at our house. Made no changes, except to add a little more milk for the glaze. I added a slivered almond before baking for presentation. I took the advice of another member and refrigerated them between batches and they did not spread as much and rose beautifully. My batch yielded 46 petite cookies. UPDATE!! WARNING. Do not use an air bake cookie sheet. My last bach still wasn't brown on the bottom after 20 minutes. Use a traditional sheet."
"1","5","Follow the tips below. Chill dough before forming and before baking. AA battery is the right size for the center. Vanilla or Almond extract is personal preference. A baggie with a clipped corner fills the cookies perfectly."
"1","4","Just made these cookies and they're great, Had 3 of them within 10 minutes. Although I subtracted one star because of the inconsistency of the glaze recipe. Needs WAY more liquid to make the confect. sugar a glaze than stated. I just eyeballed more milk and almond extract (about 1/4 a teaspoon at a time each) to make it the right consistency. Other than that the recipe is perfect and I followed it as is. I didn't think I'd like a shortbread cookie nor have I ever made one but this recipe had so many positive reviews and looked so simple and w/ ingredients that I basically always have on hand that I had to try it. I don't think one has to worry about the 'seedless' part in the raspberry jam thing. I used red raspberry preserves (with seeds) and they still turned out great. Used a home-made ziplock bag piper to make the distributing of the preserves into the thumbprints easier. Speaking of thumbprints. I followed the instruction of many reviews and chilled the dough before rolling into balls which I then 'thumbprinted' with the end of my oxo good grips 4 1/2 inch santoku knife. some cracked while making the indentions but I kinda formed them back into a full circle so I wouldn't have any leakage. Also bake for the amount of time stated. Mine took 16 mins exactly. They still look a little too softish even though they're done but don't worry, the harden a bit when they're cooled."
"1","5","Can't believe anyone would have trouble making this cookie - you DO have to watch the edges but these are one of the easiest cookies EVER and are absolutely WONDERFUL."
"1","5","These cookies turned out great for me. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 c flour and 1 egg and used cold butter (1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine). I chilled the dough and used a scoop to scoop it. Put 1/8 t jam in each and then I drizzled chocolate on top- -they taste great!"
"1","5","YUM! These were super easy to make and soooo yummy. A new staple in my recipe book for sure! Even my boyfriend loved them and he hates shortbread and raspberry jam!!"
"1","1","These spread all over the pan and the jam spread out too - mine looked NOTHING like the picture! Didn't taste that great either - I won't use this recipe again."
"1","5","Yummy! These are beautiful, easy, and delicious! My kids loved them! I used vanilla extract instead of almond b/c I didn't have almond and I thought the kids might like them that way. I was right! Big hit! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","AMAZING!! I used Baker brand Raspberry dessert filling instead of jam. The dessert filling isnt super sweet like the jam, and it also doesnt spread out like jam does when you bake it."
"1","5","Holy cow, are these ever good! The only thing I changed was that I used Door County cherry preserves. I will make these every chance I get."
"1","5","they looked great in the picture and they turned out perfect. I froze them without the jam and when i was ready to bake i dropped in the jam and they turned out wonderful! yes and please don't substitute the almond for vanilla....not the same!"
"1","5","So simple and so delicious. These were my brothers favorite of all the holiday cookies I made. I used vanilla instead of almond extract and I didn't bother with the frosting. Too easy. They were awesome."
"1","5","This exceeding my expectations of a buttery cookie. Not too sweet, which is perfect for me and just enough tartness in the raspberry, which works well for my husband (he loves raspberry). Next time I'd probably hold back on how much I used of the extract just because it could be overpowering but not excessive. That was my fault though. I didn't have the right measuring spoons. Otherwise, they taste just like they look - mouthwatering!"
"1","1","These cookies looked much better then they tasted. The dough got dry and cracked as i was making the thumbprint, had to reshape them with my hands. some of the filling poured out while cooking. They did expand but held their shape. Like i said they looked better then what they tasted. They tasted very sweet, jam was very over powering and i can taste the sugar crystals in the cookie."
"1","5","awesome thank you. just finished baking them"
"1","4","Tastes good, but look nothing like the picture. After baking, they lost their shape and basically melted flat to the pan."
"1","5","I followed the suggestions of MarcieJ - didn't soften the butter, added 1/4 cup of flour and put the cookies in the freezer before cooking and they turned out PERFECT! Thank you Dee and MarcieJ!!"
"1","5","I don't know what everyone is saying about their cookies falling flat. The best remedy for this is after you make the dough...put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before you start rolling them into balls. Keep putting the dough back in the fridge until you have baked them all. They are delicious and a very handsome looking cookie. You can use different variations by changing the jams, or the extracts, nuts....try pure vanilla extract instead of almond, pineapple preserves with the dough rolled in coconut and macadamia nuts."
"1","5","I have been making this recipe for several years at christmas without the drizzle and they are always a huge hit."
"1","5","Yum! I love thumbprint cookies. And the lil one loves to help!"
"1","2","Made exactly. Too buttery, thin and crispy. Needs something to make them more cakey-like. Needs more almond extract / flavour."
"1","5","WOW. these are delicious. the 'almond' makes the cookie. i am using these for a cookie exchange & very excited on how they turned out. so scrumptious. Also, i used huckleberry jam & OHHH so tasty. followed the recipe but next time will use 1/4 more flour to keep the cookie from cracking."
"1","5","Everybody loves these cookies!!!! Here are a few tips-- use a small round measuring spoon to make indent- putting jam in a squeeze bottle makes for easy filling of indent and always allow them to cool on baking sheet for 1 - 2 minuets, this will allow cookie to set and you will not get break through with the jam. Add some almond slices before icing."
"1","4","Almost perfect! I did as others suggested and put the cookies on a baking sheet then in the fridge for 10 minutes before I filled with jam. And I added probably a tablespoon or 2 of milk (like I normally do with any shortbread recipe) for a better dough consistency. I had no issues with spreading or leaking jam. And I used a spicy plum jam that was home made by a friend. The sweet and spicy combo with the almond icing is simply amazing!"
"1","5","Delicious!! I used raspberry and tangerine jam. Next time I make them I want to try to make the thumbprints a little bigger."
"1","5","So GOOOD! I used sugar free jam and about 5 table spoons was plenty...i also used only 1/4 of the confectioners' sugar for the icing. For lighter calorie use Smuckers sugar free jam and Blue Bonnet light butter sticks."
"1","5","Amazing the way the recipe is written!. I used raspberry seedless jam and drizzled melted white chocolate chips over them. Also used strawberry and drizzled melted milk chocolate chips... wonderful!"
"1","5","made these at christmas time i loved them well make every ear thank you :)"
"1","5","Easy and delicious! I followed the advice of the reviewer that says to stick the prepped cookies in the refrigerator for about a half hour-they came out lovely. I've tried them with vanilla and almond extracts and they both turned out well (although I personally prefer the vanilla). Awesome little cookies, and everyone thinks you're a genius."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious cookies - the jam on top makes it out of this world! My jam turned a bit sticky on the top after being baked but that's what made it so delicious. I opted out of the icing drizzle just because I thought it would be sweet enough and glad I chose to. Great cookies - they are always a hit!"
"1","5","Delicious! They do take a little time, but the effort is worth it. Made these for a wedding cookie table and they added a lot of color. A new 'keeper' for the cookie file."
"1","5","Amazing! Did not make with glaze, and switched raspberry for blackberry. A yummy plain shortbread standby with a jammy center- Delish!"
"1","5","I read the reviews for this and was a little worried. However, I made the recipe exactly as it said. Used the end of a chapstick tube to put the hole in the cookie and used 1/4 teaspoon for the jam. These came out perfect without putting them in the fridge or making any other adjustments. They will be a regular cookie in our home!"
"1","4","These tasted delicious but were the biggest mess ever. Apparently my architecture of the cookie was flawed because i had raspberry jam everywhere. Will rethink my design if i make these again."
"1","4","They're pretty good. I also did not soften the butter. I guess I just hoped they would be a little sweeter."
"1","4","really tasty, super easy and so pretty. I made 1 1/2 in. balls like it said and only got about 2 1/2 doz. so do slightly smaller balls if you want the full 36. I also used two different kinds of jam and that made it pretty too."
"1","5","These were awesome!! I follows the directions exactly, but doubled the recipe and added a 1/4 cup extra flour as one review suggested. They tunred out perfect and had amazing flavor!"
"1","5","This is one of my favorite recipes! My mom submitted it to Taste of Home some time ago and they published it too!! They are addictive and make great Christmas cookies. They are also good if you replace the almond with vanilla and fill them with melted semisweet chocolate chips! yummy!"
"1","5","This has become one of my favorite recipes. I always make more than the recipe says. EVERYONE LOVES THESE COOKIES!!!!"
"1","5","I love this recipe! I use homemade cherry jam instead of raspberry and I leave off the glaze, but that is just personal preference. Also, I noticed on another thumbprint cookie recipe, someone wondered how to get an even hole for the jam. I use the cap of the almond extract, dipped in flour, then just press it into the dough ball. Works like a charm!"
"1","5","These were great! I followed the recipe ingredients as is but I did change the instructions a bit. As did others, I chilled the dough after step 2 for 10 minutes. Also, I put the raspberry jam in a ziploc bag, cut off about 1/4 inch of the corner and squeezed the jam into the hole of the cookie. That made it a lot easier! Then I baked the cookies on a cookie sheet lined in parchment paper. They came out perfectly."
"1","5","If 885 folks have reviewed this recipe, you have to know it's something out of the ordinary! To say these are pretty special treats is an understatement. I DID find the dough to be too dry so the addition of 2 tsp. milk made it workable. Otherwise it was crumbly and didn't adhere. DIVINE cookies!"
"1","5","I made these cookies on Easter Sunday. I found the recipe and was set on making them. Unfortunately, i realized i had no jam or almond extract. So i went down to the Chinese supermarket to see if they had any of the missing ingredients, but i was out of luck. As a last resort, i went to a gas station, where they had jam! But, they only had strawberry jam. I took what i got and bought the ridiculously expensive jam. I followed the recipe as well as i could, but found that the dough was very loose and dry. So i added some milk, until it was the right consistency. I rolled them out and filled them with the strawberry jam. I baked them for around 15 min. with the convection on. I tentatively took a bite, and they were really good. The change in jam and lack of extract made no difference. They also held up their shape very well and didn't spread too much. A very good recipe. My family loves them, and my husband, Harry, demands i make them every Easter."
"1","5","Very quick and easy. Yummy!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!!! These are among the best cookies I've ever had. Seriously. I used margarine instead of butter and my mother's homemade quince jelly instead of the raspberry preserves. YUM. Thank you so much for sharing!"
"1","5","amazing!!"
"1","5","I have made these cookies numerous times. They are AWESOME. I follow the directions to the tee, although sometime I change the flavor of the preserves..but, I find that raspberry is always the best!!..I have never had any leftover cookies when I display them."
"1","5","So tasty! Make sure to freeze the cookies for 10 min before baking. I skipped the sugary glaze and they were delicious as is."
"1","5","Yummy... I wish I would have used something wider than a wooden spoon handle to make the holes because the jam didn't spread out as much as I'd hoped... but flavor was great!"
"1","5","the jam leaked out a bit sometimes when the cookie would crack but over all these were cute, easy and delicious!"
"1","5","These were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. I have tried many thumbprint recipes and this is one of the best!"
"1","5","Awesome. I made these little gems for Christmas and they went over extremely well. I did however, follow some of the tips in the comments section, refrigerating the dough for 20 -30 minutes after it was mixed and then again after the cookies were shaped. As a result, the cookies didn't spread as much and I didn't have any jam disasters in my oven."
"1","5","So good & easy! Made it into a giant cookie."
"1","4","Really good and hubby loved them too! Had the issue where they got really flat, but it didn't hurt anything. I also made a batch without jelly, and put chocolate frosting on them after baking, and the cookie wasn't as good. I think the glaze helps a lot!"
"1","4","I would give these I three, but everyone who tried them would rate a five. They were just to sweet for my taste. They went quick, and all wanted more. Instead of raspberry I used Peach jam, since thats what I had."
"1","5","Decided to give these a try, and I followed the recipe verbatim, and got great results! I used a brand new AA battery to make the well for the jam, lol...oh, and I put the cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes before baking...everyone I gave them to raved about how good they tasted and looked."
"1","4","They were good but I dont think they need the icing on top, just makes them too sweet. I would make again but with no icing."
"1","5","I used a recipe very similar to this one from a Land O Lakes Cookbook. It was pretty much the same with just some different proportions and water instead of milk in the glaze. It was a hit! Everybody loved these and they stayed soft for days! will definitely make again!"
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out really well. This is an easy recipe that didn't take very long but the cookies look like you spent a lot of time in the kitchen!"
"1","5","I do not consider myself a master chef/baker by any means, but these looked easy enough! I tried them out using both raspberry and apricot jam - DELICIOUS!!!! Brought them in for coworkers and they were a big hit!! Tips: 1) Make sure to put the indentation in the dough right after forming the ball, if the dough it sits while you make make each ball, it tends to crack when making the indentation. I used the top of the almond extract bottle for a perfectly round center. 2) Agreed with the other reviewers, refrigerating the dough before baking helps it keep its form. 3) I added a little extra milk to the drizzle to make it a more 'drizzle-able' consistency, and then piped it on through a plastic baggie with the edge snipped off."
"1","5","These cookies are FANTASTIC!!! I made them a little smaller than the recipe says using a 1/2 TBSP measuring spoon for consistency. It took 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven for them to be perfectly brown on the bottom with no browning around the edges, and they came out to what I think was a perfect size. At the advice of another reviewer, I used a chap stick end to make the 'thumbrints' and it worked beautifully. What a pretty (and great tasting) little Christmas cookie! These are definately a keeper!! Thanks to Dee for sharing the recipe :D"
"1","5","I just tried this recipe today and it is great and fairly easy to make. These tasty morsels should be a bit hit with my family on Christmas Eve. I have now added this to my collection!"
"1","5","Exact same recipe that is on the Land O Lakes website for the cookie base, only difference is the icing. Delicious! My son asks me to make these very year for Christmas!"
"1","3","I couldn't find the recipe I usually use so I decided to go with this one. I followed the recipe exactly; I wish I had run a test batch before putting a whole cookie sheet full in the oven. My first ones came out flat, thes spead like crazy. I turned down the over to 325 (I have an electric stove) and the second batch was in the fridge with the first one were baking. They still spread out but were not as flat as the first. The 3rd were also put in the fridge and they came out the best but still nothing like the photo. I do like the flavor of these cookies but don't like how flat and wide they got."
"1","5","These are very good and easy. Some tips I learned that may help: keep the dough cold it wont spread as much. Try the back of a wooden spoon and make a well deeper than wide. Mix the jam in a small bowl until its smooth and almost pours into the well. Bake by time, looks can be deceiving. By the time they look cooked their over done. Enjoy!"
"1","5","First off can I say I hate when someone changes a recipes then complains that it didn't turn out right. This is a very good recipe, always turns out good for me. The only 'change' I make is to chill the dough a bit before baking."
"1","5","just perfect!"
"1","5","I can't stop eating these! I used the lid from the almond extract bottle to make the indent."
"1","4","The jam did seep out on a few, but wasn't horrible. At first the glaze seemed really thick, but I added a little extra milk and then it was too thin. I would suggest letting the cookies cool before glazing otherwise all the glaze congregates in the center and you don't get the drizzle effect. I ended up with 24 cookies."
"1","5","This shortbread recipe is delicious. I have been making these for a few years now for christmas and are always a big hit. Some people said their cookies spread too much when cooking. I found using land o lake butter seems to help prevent this."
"1","5","Love these cookies. No need to change the recipe, it is perfect as written."
"1","5","YUM YUM! I used jam with seeds in it because it was so much cheaper than the other kind. The dough was so dry, I wasnt sure these were going to work. I skipped the icing because they were just great without it. I will be making these again and again."
"1","5","The flavor was great, but when baked they spread out and laid flat. This was a real disappointment, but the taste was so good just sliced them like bars."
"1","4","Decent flavor but difficult dough!! Used 1/4tsp of almond extract and reduced flour by 1/3C and still needed to add about 1-2Tbsp. of milk just to get dough workable. Couldn't shape cookies without using the milk...too dry and crumbly. Overall tasty...thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Very good and easy to make cookies. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and rolled them in a ball and used a chapstick to make the hole for the raspberry preserves. I also used waxed paper and they came out perfect. Will add to my holiday cookie list!"
"1","5","Very good!! I used several reviews to get a perfect cookie!! I used 1/4 cup extra flour and 2 tsp milk. Set the dough in the fridge for 20 min and then rolled small balls and placed on my cookie sheets. I then used an end to a Sharpie and made the well for the jelly, I rounded out the top of the hole to make it bigger. I then placed jelly in each well and set in the freezer. I baked at 325 for 30 min and had a perfect cookie!!"
"1","5","Excellent Holiday cookie recipe! Everyone loved these and they were so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't run into any of the problems that other reviewers experienced with flattening and the filling running out. I will definitley make these again!"
"1","5","Just made these last night. I halved the recipe but still made 30 decent size shortbreads. I lowered the oven temp to 325F, and baked them for 15 mins. I did put the dough in the freezer for 15 mins before baking and they all turned out great. No spilling at all."
"1","5","This recipe is delicious! Made my first batch in a friend's kitchen without my usual appliances and it still turned out amazingly. Someone in the reviews suggested you use the end of a chapstick tube for the 'thumbprints' and I'm very glad I did. They were just the right size! I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry and they still turned out fantastic, and I plan to experiment with various types. Cheerio!"
"1","5","I made several batches for a large party and everyone raved. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the frosting.. For a beautiful presentation I gently brushed the tops and sides of the balls with egg white and rolled just the edges of the ball in finely chopped almonds. In the center I made my wholes... After several batches I found the skinny, deeper holes (I used back of permanent marker) work the best so the preserves dont run all over. . I also filled with different flavors of preserves so that they would also present a color variety. They looked store bought and taste delicious!!!"
"1","5","Made this with no modifications. I had never attempted to make a shortbread recipe. This was incredible!! My Significant Other is a huge shortcake fan so I was very nervous when he began to eat them. He says that these cookies are now his favorite!! Awesome recipe, easy, and the end result is rewarding!"
"1","5","The shortbread cookie itself is delicious, and with the jam and frosting, it's outstanding. However, the appearance and baking process did not go as well for me. It may have been my fault, I used a uniform scooper to drop them (that's ball-shaped, right?!) and they baked much larger than expected and turned flat and strawberry jam leaked all over my cookie sheets. However, I didn't follow instructions to the letter, next time I will actuallt take the time to roll them into tiny balls and see what happens! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","These cookies are super easy - but always get rave reviews! First found them in a land o'lakes cookie book. To prevent cookies from spreading - ensure butter is not too soft - just soft enough to mix. Also do not add extra extract - and definitely chill for at least an hour. I use a cookie scoop - shape and indent the cookies and stash them in the freezer while I roll the next batch - then switch trays to add the jam. They keep shape well and look beautiful. I have used raspberry and strawberry jam - and even Nutella (careful - burns easily) - but my most requested is with Guava Jam - yummy and sweet (I will usually omit glaze with these.) Everyone should try these!"
"1","5","I was really attracted to this recipe because there were so few ingredients! Still, these were wonderful. You can't rush baking, and I agree that the dough should be cold before going into the oven. Plus, it's important to make the cookies extra tall, so they don't spread too much. These were easy, beautiful, rich, and delicious."
"1","4","Great cookies! But I will admit I omitted the almond extract from the icing... it smelled too artificial. All my guests enjoyed these cookies..."
"1","5","These were FANTASTIC! I used blackberry jam and they turned out wonderfully. I made two batches in one night because they were so popular in our household! Thanks for a terrific recipe!"
"1","5","These were soooo yummy. I made 2 batches within one week. The first batch was perfect. The second batch I added a little too much almond extract to the cookie mix and they came out too soft so now I know next time to stick to the original recipe. I did not put the glaze but they were still very delicious without it."
"1","5","These were super easy to make and taste delicious. I didn't make the glaze and I added vanilla instead of almond extract. My daughter made the thumbprints. Fun, kid friendly, yummy!"
"1","5","Excellent!!"
"1","5","Wonderful! My husband called them Marzipan cookies because of the rich almond taste. Make sure to chill before you bake so the jam has a firm place to rest."
"1","5","These cookies are addictive! I've made them for Christmas gifts, for cookouts, for parties, and everyone asks for the recipe. I follow the recipe just as it is. One thing I watch is the softness of the butter. Don't let it get oversoft on the counter. It should be a bit firm when you're creaming with the sugar. This prevents the cookies from flattening out. And using a really good raspberry jam is a must! I love the taste of almond, so you could add a bit more to the glaze if you like. Excellent cookies!"
"1","4","Very good! Do not substitute the almond extract with vanilla though; every time i did, the cookies came out flat!"
"1","2","Tasted like rancid butter with overcooked raspberry jam. I made them exactly as the recipe called for, and was quite disappointed. They puffed nicely, didn't spread too much...Sigh. A waste of half a pound of butter."
"1","5","Very nice tasting cookie, I DBL the recipe, I replaced one stick on butter with crisco, I baked the cookies 5 five mins at 350 before I put my trumbprint and jelly on the them. they turned out really nice...I made 45 cookies by DBL the recipe. The Almond really make these cookie GO, I dont think vanilla will make it taste as good."
"1","5","These cookies were delicious and the dough was an absolute dream to work with. I followed the recipe exactly, but added more almond extract in the frosting because I love almond extract! Be sure to make really small balls and not to make the thumbprint too deep, otherwise the jelly will bake right through the bottom. Otherwise- absolutely delicious!! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","These cookies were just what I was looking for! I wanted to try shortbread cookies (my first time) and these seemed easy enough. I made a few modifications, and they turned out great! I didn't have almond extract, so I used vanilla (slightly less than the recipe called for) and I wanted chocolate, so I used melted semi-sweet chocolate instead of jam and filled the thumb print when the cookies came out of the oven. Perfect!"
"1","5","Get these lil stinkers away from me!!! They are addicting!!! I didn't have any almond extract so I used vanilla and let's just say they were awesome and pretty too!"
"1","5","these were so easy and absolutely tasty. it helps to roll all of the dough into balls at once and punch wholes in them then once you have a pan ready you can just grab them from the bowl and place the jelly in them. I used a strawberry jelly and it has a great sweet taste. Also freezing the cookies for about 5 minutes before the oven really helps them keep their shape. One this i found helpful as well is when your punching the holes in your dough if you experience the cookie cracking just knead the dough in your hands for a bit.and i dashed a bit more almond extract in the icing, it makes them really fragrant."
"1","5","These were terrific! We used homemade blackberry jam. MMMMM."
"1","5","I made this with strawberry jam and those of us who like jam cookies loved them! The almond flavor shortbread is nice... I was skeptical of almond and jam together. The icing can be omitted, but it's not hard to make and really dresses up the cookie. So good."
"1","5","Amazing cookie! I use a little more almond flavor than recipe calls for, but that is just my taste. These go over great anywhere I take them. I've yet to meet someone who does not like them."
"1","5","This recipe is easy and tasty just as it is. Ran out of Raspberry jam half way through and used strawberry and marionberry and it was just as tasty. The family liked that there was no egg in the dough so they could sneek the raw dough when they thought I wasnt looking (so they thought) Im not a big fan of almond extract, but this recipe has the right amount, not too overwhellming."
"1","5","Words cannot describe how easy and delish these were. I made these at the last minute for SuperBowl Sunday and they were a hit!! Now, I didn't plan out to make this, (it was decided on a whim) so I didn't have almond flavoring. I substituted with Amaretto liqueur in the shortbread and the glaze. I'm glad I did it, too. Also, I forgot about the raspberry jelly (again, I was very unprepared) but I did have strawberry jam. I'm not too fond of strawberry jam, but the hubby is and it was great enough for me to overcome my dislike. I did triple the batch (don't know why I did that, either) so I had plenty of left overs. I got lazy about over half way through and just squashed the dough w/o putting jam on. Again, still good that way, too. Next time, I plan to be prepared and buy the raspberry jam, but I'm keeping the Amaretto liqueur ;-)"
"1","5","Simple,delicious delicate cookie, Thank you!"
"1","4","Good cookie! I don't know if it was just me or what, but i put one batch on a silpat, and they were completely flat and just ran together. The other batches i baked on parchment turned out fine..."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","perfect thumbprint recipe! i had strawberry jam at home so i used that and it was very tasty! we aren't huge raspberry fans!"
"1","5","I was looking for a thumbprint recipe and these are so delicious! I ended up putting them in the fridge for 15 mins (or until firm) before popping them in the oven. Came out perfectly shaped! My first batch I tried adding the egg and the 1/4 C extra flour and it came out tasting more like flour than almond. So I recommend sticking to the recipe exactly except refrigerating them for 15 mins (with the jam/preserves in place) then putting them straight into the oven."
"1","5","I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these cookies. I have made them over and over and I keep making them for myself and friends and family. I used different kinds of spreadable fruit and everyone raves about them. I can't get enough of them."
"1","5","They were perfect without changing anything. Very easy to make and were delicious! Update: I found that using a pastry bag and piping the batter in circular motion leaving a small indintation for the jam worked out best for me. It took much less time to prepare and turned out very pretty. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","I just made these for the 1st time. Followed the recipe, rolled each ball into crushed almonds and used the end of my muddle-r to make the 'thumbprint'. I used my 1/4 teaspoon to fill each. Came out PERFECT and taste PERFECT! These are def a keeper for my xmas cookies! I cant wait to share them on Christmas day! YUM-O!"
"1","5","I baked over 500 cookies for the holidays this year and tried 7 different recipes. This is the recipe I am pulling back up because even a double batch went so fast I need to make more! (Ok, so maybe I was the main offender!) I like my cookies on the light side, so I only cooked them for about 12 minutes and I also needed to add a little more milk to the glaze. Definitely my favorite this year!"
"1","5","Never again will I cheat and make these from the Betty Crocker bag! After the first batch, I realized that I wasn't going to get anywhere near 3 dozen cookies. So, I rolled the dough into about 1 inch or smaller in size. From experience, an actual thumbprint is too wide and shallow which sometimes causes an overflow of jam. So, I poke a hole halfway through the ball using the back end of my spatula which is a bit wider than my pinky finger. The dough will spread a bit which results in a thumbprint size crevice of jam. I noticed that my last tray spreaded 2x as much as the first tray. I believe it was from over handling the dough as I was constantly reshaping them to get a full dozen. Next time, I will pop the loaded tray in the fridge in between baking."
"1","5","I am not a fan of shortbread cookies, but somehow I liked these-alot! I think it is the little touch of almond that makes these so good to me. I had no problems with the jam running all over. I just made the dough into very small balls(should yield 36!), and used the end of my wooden spoon to make the indentation halfway down into the cookie. I skipped the icing, I think they are tasty without, although I'm sure they would be superb with it as well. I will make these again."
"1","5","These cookies turned out wonderful and they taste great. I made the dough in my food processor which worked up very nicely. I used my middle size cookie scoop to scoop out the dough on the cookie sheet (walnut size) and a 3/4 inch diameter wooden spoon to make the indents about 1/4 inche deep and being careful to squeeze the dough back together if it split a bit. When they baked they flattened nicely and turned out perfect. Thank you so much for a great recipe."
"1","1","These do not hold their shape, even after chilling the dough and the cookie sheet! I have used other thumbprint recipes that do not flatten out at all. I will stick to my old faithful."
"1","5","Okay these Cookies TASTE delicious, BUT even with the tips from MarcieJ (putting in more flour and putting them in the freezer before baking), they still came out flat, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  Update: I made these again tonight and added 2 1/4 cups of flower and an egg and refrigerated the dough for about a half hour before rolling into little balls. That seemed to help a lot, because they didn't come out flat :)"
"1","5","Mmmmm... tasty! For those having trouble with the flattening out, try using a mini muffin pan instead of a cookie sheet. They are great this way; more to bite into at once and they look fabulous:) I used half with apricot preserves and the other half with a home-made raspberry sauce with a recipe from this site.. will be making this over and over again.***I made these again and took the suggestion of adding an egg; big mistake. They did come out a little puffier but the taste was not as buttery and they lacked that 'melt-in-your-mouth' effect. They were also crispier with the egg, which I didn't like. They were still good, they're just much better w/o the egg. I still recommend using a mini muffin pan because you can make the indentations much deeper which means more filling and when you bite into them the sauce will slowly drip out! They're soo good!!"
"1","5","I'm in the process of making these cookies now - using sugar free apricot preserves because I had it on the shelf ... and OMG! These are wonderful!! Such a nice buttery favor!!! YUM!"
"1","5","Used seedless black berry jam... was so yummy!!"
"1","5","These thumbprints were a big hit at my yearly cookie exchange. They looked beautiful and tasted even better! An added bonus is that they were easy to make! I put the prepared dough with the jam in the freezer for about 30 min. as well before baking and this worked well. They did spread out a bit more than I had expected, so you can make them small if you need to make a lot like I did."
"1","5","Fabulous and so very easy. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and refrigerated the dough prior to filling holes with jam and then baking. And I did need to add approx. 2 more tsp of milk to get a good consistency for the drizzle/glaze. Also, made use of 2 ziploc baggies - one for the jam and one for the glaze which made for quick and neat piping. Perfect cookies - impressive look and phenomenal taste!"
"1","5","If you aren't getting great results when making this, you're doing something wrong. I followed the recipe to the T up until the preserves. I added Strawberry instead of raspberry.(never cared for it much) Anywho, I got 32 good size cookies. And they were soft, moist, and DELIOCIOUS! A great/easy/fun recipe and I'll recommend it to anyone!"
"1","5","These are excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I used a cork as I think someone suggested in another review for the 'thumbprint' and used a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon to put the jam in with. I didn't have any problem with the jam running. Excellent cookies and very easy. I'm taking them to a cookie exchange but making an extra batch to keep at home! Love that subtle almond flavor with the slightly tart raspberry and sweet glaze."
"1","4","Taste is great, but my dough was very flaky and would not roll into balls very easily. I guess next time I'll try adding a little milk and kneading more? And my cookies spread out too much."
"1","5","after reading all the reviews...i was leary about making these thinking they would become flat and run all over....but i followed the review of kikigirl and omg these r to die 4....they came out perfect...thanks 4 the great recipe & the great review....only made 1/2 of recipe but going back to make another double batch yum adding to my every year cookies cant wait till hubby come home to taste.."
"1","5","The dough is very tasty. My second batch came perfectly. If your cookies come out flat it's probably because the balls are a bit too large or you've set the temperature of the oven too high. I made smaller balls the second time around and chilled them for about 45 minutes. The cookies stood tall and there wasn't any leaking."
"1","5","I made it without the almond extract in the cookies and the icing. Still taste amazing. Def a keeper!"
"1","4","This recipe was so easy and the cookies were so delicious. I also used blackberry preserves. I will be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe"
"1","5","Awesome and super easy! There's only two of us at home so I made a half a recipe. Here I am two days later making another half batch! Be generous on the raspberry jam. I also made double the icing but the original amount is sufficient enough. MMM!"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious! And so easy! Next time I make them I am going to try putting the preserves in after I cook the cookie because of the strange texture of cooked preserves. Otherwise a hit in my household!"
"1","5","I made these cookies last year for a cookie exchange and people STILL remember them and are asking for me to bring them again. They come out so beautifully and look like something from a magazine. And they have so few ingredients and are really quite easy!"
"1","5","OMG THESE COOKIES ARE SO GOOD I LOVE THEM CANT WAIT TO MAKE THEM AGAIN THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS I THOUGHT THE DOUGH WAS A LITTLE HARD TO WORK WITH."
"1","5","This is so incredibly delicious, made so even more by its simplicity. Love it!! fave recipe of the moment...my family really enjoys this treat after a long day at the office!"
"1","5","These were fantastic and so easy to make. Don't skip the glaze - it really adds to this cookie."
"1","5","Used strawberry preserves and vanilla extract instead."
"1","5","Delicious!!!! I've made these several times and everyone that has tried these cookies say they are the best cookies they've ever had. Thanks!!!"
"1","5","Delicious and easy - I love recipes with so few ingredients. I couldn't get the drizzle to, well, drizzle, so I left a few without - they were equally good either way. I did the first batch according to recipe, and the second batch I added some more flour like others suggested and it worked a little better."
"1","5","I just finished making these and they turned out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and froze them for 10 mins before baking like some others had suggested. I will definetly be baking these again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","These are excellent! I followed the advice of others and added about 1/4 cup of flour to what the recipe called for. I also put the indented dough balls in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. I wanted to fill them with frosting, so I left out the jam. I also rolled the balls of dough in finely chopped walnuts before making the indentions. After they cooled I filled them with a simple icing (cream 1/2 stick butter until smooth; add 2 cups powdered sugar; add milk to desired consistency). The result was amazing! They were easy to make and delicious to eat. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","A little hard to form the cookies, but it just takes time and patience. Totally worth the work. Perfect flavor. Previous reviews helped a lot. This is my new favorite cookie!!!!"
"1","5","Made these for Mother's day and she LOVED them! I didn't have raspberry so I used strawberry jam. I reduced the temp. a little and none of them spilled over. About halfway through I addd a tiny bit more jam to each, then smoothed it out. When they were done I drizzled a vanilla glaze on half and a chocolate glaze on the others. They came out perfect. :)"
"1","5","Amazing recipe! These cookies disappear FAST.  - I substituted vanilla extract for almond (personal preference.) - the second time I made these I skipped the glaze and they were delicious both ways. Just make sure that you use cold butter and blend the dough thoroughly to prevent the cookies from spreading."
"1","4","I didn't have any problems with this recipe although I did make a few changes flavor wise. I used a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of almond extract. I used melted white chocolate chips for the glaze and sprinkled some sliced almonds on the top.  Some tips... keep mixing in mixer on low until dough comes together. It looks crumbly at first but will eventually form if you are patient. I also used the back side of a melon baller to make indentions. About halfway down is good.  These cookies do flatten out a bit so you make them on the small side if you don't want a large cookie.  Overall, good recipe. Very pretty of you are looking to impress."
"1","5","My boyfriend made these cookies for me for valentines day and they were amazing! He followed the recipe exactly and they did spread quite a bit, but it did not take away from how good these were. Thanks for posting this one. We will definitely add this to our recipe box."
"1","5","These are actually really fast to make, but they look fancy. Someone told me they looked like they should be served at a wedding. I didn't have raspberry jam, so I used blackberry and it was awesome. I was worried because of the people who had to make all of the changes for these to turn out, but I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect."
"1","5","Excellent....tried this because of the almond flavor since I've already made thumbprint cookies....reminds me of linzer tarts"
"1","5","THESE ARE HEAVENLY!!!! I made them with margarine and raspberry preserves and they still came out irresistible! I can't stop eating them! I made them thick and got about 16 cookies out of a batch...I hope I can leave at least one for my hubby when he gets home from work...lol"
"1","4","Made this Christmas - turned out beautiful and everyone enjoyed them! I was expecting the cookie part to have more of a shortbread taste and texture, it wasn't crispy as shortbread. Perhaps I didn't have the butter at the right temperature or over mixed the dough."
"1","5","I knew after tasting these - this recipe is going into my permanent cookie file. I put them into the fridge for 10-15 minutes before baking. Baked perfectly for me at 13 minutes. Be careful not to let them brown too much. I used strawberry jam rather than raspberry. Good without frosting, but better with it! My guests loved them, too. They look and taste great!"
"1","5","These were so good and easy! I followed the recipe exactly and then refridgerated the dough before baking and they turned out perfect. After tasting one without the glaze I thought they were great without it so I left it off since I was adding them to cookie trays for xmas and thought they'd be to messy with it, but then I got home and added glaze to the ones I kept for ourselves and they were absolutely amazing with the icing. I felt like I cheated my friends and family out of an even better cookie than what they already were. Planning on making another batch soon cuz they went way to fast!"
"1","5","Amazing recipe. My family and friends request these cookies all the time. I make them a little smaller than recommended and stick them in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking.   Also, they make GREAT volcano cookies for a luau party. Shape the cookies to look like little volcanoes (higher sides) and cook as directed (make sure to chill before baking so they do not spread out!). Then, add orange food coloring to the glaze and have it run down the sides of the 'volcano' to look like lava. Was a big hit."
"1","5","I absolutely love this recipe. I've avoided shortbread recipes in the past after a disastrous attempt in my youth! This recipe is easy, delicious and looks great. I substituted vanilla for almond extract and used a white chocolate and cream glaze."
"1","5","Great cookies! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions like not softening the butter. I used a 1/8 teaspoon to put holes in the cookies and I bought a squeezable bottle of seedless rasberry spread. Yum!"
"1","5","everyone's favorite cookie in my family. perfect."
"1","5","I just made the rasberry and almond shortbread thumbprints and they were amazing! I didnt make mine as big as the recipe said to though. I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls, made a very deep hole and used a ziplock bag to squeeze in the jam!I also added some green food coloring to the glaze and put a sliced almond in the middle. They look like little christmas wreaths!"
"1","5","I found this recipe inside the label of Land O Lakes butter. This quickly became a traditional Christmas cookie at our house. I didn't change a thing."
"1","4","Delicious!! These cookies taste awesome! They disappeared quickly! The dough was a bit crumbly. I did stick it in the freezer before baking, as suggested, and added a small amount more flour."
"1","4","It's a great recipe and comes out great the first time, but the measurements on the glaze are a bit off: double the milk or you just have sugary crumbles."
"1","5","I made these for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved them. I lined the cookie sheets with foil. Clean up was easy. I baked them for 12 minutes"
"1","5","I made the recipe just as it is written (except I used strawberry instead of raspberry) and they turned out great! I made them with my nephews and they loved making the thumb prints."
"1","4","Very tasty! Definately refrigerate the dough before using it. It helps w/ the spreading. For my first batch I made the balls on the smaller side and I did not like the size. For the second batch I make the dough balls a little larger, and bingo! Perfect!"
"1","5","Everyone I've made these for adored them. I've tried to not make this that often because they're so bad for you. :D  As per the annoying-reviewer-syndrome, I modified the recipe. Instead of almond, I used vanilla extract and have tried both blackberry and strawberry jams. It's a pretty basic recipe so it worked out well. I also didn't use the glaze.    I used a small cookie scoop to help portion out the cookies. Then I rolled them into a ball shape before flattening and making the indentation. Just try to remember to not be too enthusiastic with the thumbprinting as it's easy for the dough to break and have the jam leak though.  These also seemed to ship well."
"1","4","I made this as a cookie without the jam. SO light and buttery. Instead of almond essence, I substitute it with 1 tsp vanilla essence. The dough turned out sticky and was not easy to roll so I stuff them into a piping bag and piped them all out. LOVELY!"
"1","5","This is an amazing cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and IT WAS AMAZING!!! Everyone ate these out at an amazing fast seed!!"
"1","5","Made these twice, they're fab. If you want a flatter cookie, add less flour, if you want them to hold their shape, add more."
"1","4","I followed the other ladies' advice and added 1/4 cup of flour and chilled the jam filled cookies before baking...they turned out perfectly! There was no spreading and the jam didn't leak. This batch yielded almost 50 cookies but I made them really small, about 1' balls. Perfect bite size!"
"1","5","These were absolutely delicious!! I made half the batch to kind of test it out, I loved it. I am doubling the recipe tomorrow to make for my sister in law who just had a baby. I used strawberry jelly instead of raspberry because thats all I had. Very good, definitely going to add as one of my favorites."
"1","5","Sinfully rich buttery cookies with just a hint of sweetness! I used my cookie scooper to form balls and came up with about two dozen cookies. I also used strawberry jam which is my favorite flavor. These were so good that my husband and I ate all of these cookies by ourselves. I will make some for the holidays; otherwise, they aren't safe around my house! Great recipe, Dee!"
"1","5","Delicious! Used some raspberry jam bought from the farmer's market..."
"1","4","This turned out pretty well --- and they were so cute! My sister loved them."
"1","5","These were a HUGE hit! Even my mom who isn't a fan of shortbread couldn't stop herself! She finished them all in 2 days!"
"1","5","This is good even without the glaze!"
"1","5","always a hit!"
"1","5","SO GOOD! I added a little brown sugar, to make the shortbread a little more fun."
"1","5","Wow, these little guys are tart! Very good and very pretty."
"1","2","I was totally unimpressed by these cookies. Mine came out ugly - not like the picture. Also, there was no flavor to the cookie part and I even added a dash of vanilla. I had to cook them longer than the suggested time. These were a huge waste of time, ingredients, and energy. I will not make these again."
"1","5","These are also delicious by adding lemon extract instead of the almond and using lemon curd instead of raspberry preserves. I have used these cookies when I do my business marketing and they are ALWAYS popular."
"1","5","very delicious cookies!! I will definitely make again!"
"1","5","Love the recipe. Personally the glaze made the cookie too sweet for me, so i will be making these again without the glaze."
"1","5","Love the taste! The combination of almond and raspberry is excellent. I put the dough in the freezer 10 minutes to chill, and it handled beautifully. But beware when making the thumprint and filling with raspberry jam: what you see is what you will get. The cookie doesn't change at all while baking. If it's a little messy looking when you put it in, it will come out the same way. Oh, also used at least a tablespoon of milk for the glaze. Probably more. I wanted a very thin, light glaze, and loved the result."
"1","4","Really good and not at all hard to work with. They were kind of crispy at first, but after I put them into an airtight container, they softened up and became chewy.....mmmmmm! Definitely use the almond extract, it does make a difference. I did need about a teaspoon more milk in the glaze to get the right consistency, otherwise this recipe is right on!"
"1","5","I loved these! I used my corn-on-the-cob holders to make a perfect round indent for the jam. I didn't have seedless either and they were fine. I would however make more of the icing sugar topping, I ran out for the last couple cookies"
"1","4","I made these today with my children and they turned out great! I'd read the reviews and as a result I added an extra 1/4 C. of flour. Since this was my first time making them, I'm not sure what it improved, but the consistency was very easy to work with.  I also added a touch of extra milk to the *doubled* portion of the icing. Otherwise it was too thick.  Refrigerating the dough for about 20 minutes prior to shaping really helped with its form. I used a melon baller covered with seran wrap to make the indentations as mentioned by someone. It worked well."
"1","5","So easy, So good! Making another batch now!! Pressed tiny Reese's cups and Pecan halves into 2/3 of them, awesome! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Mmmm thank you MarcieJ for the recommended modifications! I did use an extra 1/4c of flour, and let them chill in the freezer for 10. They look perfect, and they taste fantastic. They barely lost their shape. I also used a chapstick to make the indent. I wraped it up in that new glad seal saran wrap and had no troubles with it sticking (i didn't use icing sugar or flour to prevent sticking to note).   I did drizzle a lil dizzle (icing) on them, it makes them look sweeter and taste sweeter. I stored mine in muffin/cupcake wrappers now they really good athentic. Thanks again for the tips, first try and they turned out perfect!!"
"1","5","If not for all the advice everyone gave, I'm sure I'd have thrown in the towel on these cookies. I so rarely bake that I forgot that a cup of butter was not one but two sticks and had to ditch the first batch. I did refrigerate the batter and freeze the cookies for 10 minutes prior to baking and the jam didn't run nor did the cookies spread too much. I added the extra 1/4 cup of flour and tried to use the chapstick, which gave the best looking cookie of all if dipped in confectioners sugar, but I could see the sugar in the impression and wasn't sure if that would affect the taste too much. When I didn't dip the chapstick in confectioners sugar and tried to pull it out of the cookie, it pulled the dough with it, so I just used my little finger. I tried the suggestion to bake the cookies without the jam for 7 mins and then fill; that worked, but the hole nearly disappeared and I had to press the middle down again to put the jam in. Those cookies were a bit flatter than the others and didn't look quite as good. They also contained a lot more jam. They all tasted delicious, however. I thought the cookies were relatively time-consuming to make mainly because the thumbprints are so tiny to try to fill. I don't know how people managed to do it with a cut-off baggie. They were delicious though."
"1","4","I followed others' suggestions as to how to save the cookies from turning out flat, but they still spread in the oven. They don't look pretty but they taste great; thankfully none of my friends care when it comes to presentation so they'll be getting flat shortbreads for Christmas at any rate :)"
"1","3","These cookies were good, but they didn't seem like shortbread. I used two cookie sheets, and varied the bake times, but they only turned out crunchy if they were dark brown. (burnt) They were too soft if i only baked them for 15 inutes, and chewy in the middle. Wont be making them again."
"1","5","Very good... I made some variations (using different jam, crushed almonds, etc etc) and they were delicious. Very easy to make. I left out the glaze though, and that was probably a good thing.  Oh, and also, (at least for mine) it tastes better the day after, when it gets softer."
"1","5","This is the first time that my thumbprint biscuits have been up to standard. Tasty, light and totally yummy. I used seedless blackberry jam. It only made 12 cookies for me. My kids loved them and they were very easy to make. Make sure your butter is softened before you use it. I had to add about 1 tbsp of milk to make dough hold together instead of crumbs."
"1","5","This recipe is fantastic! Every time I make it, people beg me to bake more. Love!!"
"1","5","VERY GOOD COOKIE! Husband also loved these easy to make jam filled cookies. Dough was a little dry so I added a touch of water to make the dough stick to itself. would make again and again anytime!"
"1","5","These are great! I didn't use the glaze though. My other alteration is, I rolled the cookie dough balls in a little egg white, and then in some crushed almonds before pressing the centers down, and baking. Turned out great. Nice toasted almonds all the way around. YUM!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies and extremely easy to make. Works just as well rolling out dough and using cookie cutters to make shapes instead."
"1","5","Wow, these were good! They were easy, fast, and made very few dirty dishes. I recommend refrigerating the dough for 10-15 minutes for easier handling. If your thumb sticks to the dough when making the thumbprint, dip your thumb in flour first. I had to add another tsp. or so of milk to the glaze to make it easier to work with. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! Be sure and not make the balls too big or they spread too much when baking - being little is what makes them cute! The second time I made these, I used apricot jam - wonderful as well! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","These had a great taste. But watch out that you dont make you dough to arge because the really spread out. Next time I'll make sure that I put the on the cookie pan so they're skinny and tall so the hold the jam. I used blackberry and rasberry. Yummy!"
"1","5","I have tried several thumbprint cookie recpies but these were my favorite. The glaze makes them look festive and adds to the flavor. I would suggest using a high quality raspberry jam for optimum taste."
"1","5","FABULOUS!!! I used vanilla in place of almond and had them turn out just fine. The dough just needed some extra work to come together. We used Seedless Black Raspberry Jam and they are so outstanding! Yum yum yum."
"1","5","These were great and relatively easy to make! Ended up with about 20 instead of 36. I actually made my thumbprint with a small plastic ball after I realized my thumbs were too tiny to make a nice thumbprint. Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","I loved these cookies, very tender and stayed soft. The dough was slightly hard to work with but I found it easier to form into dough balls after being refrigerated for an hour. I used seedless blackberry jam and vanilla extract and had several requests for the recipe."
"1","5","These were amazing!! I tried this just Friday and took 6 dozen to a cookie exchange. Everyone loved them!"
"1","5","These cookies tasted good and had a nice shortbread texture--however, after baking for 14 minutes they were quite a bit darker and crisper than I would have liked. They might need a shorter baking time."
"1","5","Very pretty and really good. They look very pretty with the drizzled glaze across the top. Very easy!"
"1","5","This really calls for 10 stars. I made it just as recipe calls except for the filling. I only had chunky cherry preserves, but I wouldn't have changed it. These are tryly orgasmic!!!! I am an experienced baker and so happy I found this recipe. These are exceptionally easy to make, and the end results can charm even a cookie despiser. Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yom!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","This was a wonderful recipie.. I made several batches at christmas and I think the ones that went over best were ones that I made with lemon curd instead of the preserves."
"1","5","Great cookies and so easy. Even after reading all the great reviews I was still pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are. I had to add a little more milk to the icing to make it drizzley. Will definately make again."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! They were so easy to make and everyone loved them. I will definitely make these again. Thanks."
"1","5","Seriously good cookies! We substituted lemon extract for the almond extract and made smaller cookies than recommended. By using just the tip of our fingers, we made small indentations and filled them with raspberry preserves. This makes wonderful bite-sized cookies that you can't resist!"
"1","5","Loved these cookies!! I brought them to a Christmas party and they were the first cookies gone. I made them with apricot and raspberry jelly. They look really fancy with the icing on top."
"1","5","This was the first thumbprint shortbread cookie I've made, so thank you:) I used margarine (out of butter), filled some with raspberry, apricot and peach jam...Lets just say I could not keep myself from having another and another! I rolled them into balls, patted ~1' then thumb printed (did not think the wet dough would roll well for me), came out fine. The cookie was tender and tasty. Thank you."
"1","5","These are very delicious and fun to make. I used a few different jams for variety and color. I made a couple of dozen as gifts and they were very well received!"
"1","5","These cookies are great. I use all kinds of fruit preserves. I prefer the smukers 100% simply fruit. Its also good in strawberry and bluberry. What I do is put a little bowl of flour next to me and dip the tip of my finger into the flower then make the indentation in the cookie. I use my finger not my thumb, and make it deep. I have also used a chocolate and strawberry cookie frostings to fill these with instead of fruit, and everyone loved it! I never use the glaze."
"1","5","So quick, easy and delicious! The cookie dough was smooth, soft and creamy, and the almond flavor was spot-on. I used Smuckers seedless raspberry jam which is quite expensive but delicious. Like other reviewers, I used more milk in the glaze. My husband took two batches into work, and they got rave reviews. Great recipe, Dee!"
"1","5","These cookies are excellent! It took me a couple tries to get the depth of the thumbprint just right. Definately make the dough balls 1.5' and the hole shallow and wide leaving about a quarter inch of dough at the bottom. Also, do not forget to let the cookies cool ON THE SHEET before removing. I cooked mine until the edges were golden and let them sit about 5 minutes to let them firm up."
"1","5","these cookies turned out great but the almond flavor was a little overwhelming. next time, i might try using vanilla instead of almond extract in the shortbread and see how that turns out. i was worried about spreading so i used half butter, half shortening. maybe i should try all butter next time and see if it does spread. definitely chill the dough to make it easier to work with. i thoughts 1 1/2 inch balls would be too big so i scooped the dough wtih an ice cream scooper and divided each ball in half. that seemed to work out well. next time, ill try filling the cookie halfway through the bake time b/c the cookie did not seem to hold its shape too well when there was a lot of filling in it. all in all, the recipe and flavor of the cookie is really good, i just made a couple changes to the process."
"1","5","Great recipe! After dough hardens a bit in the fridge, just put it in microwave on defrost for 20-30 seconds and its fine. You can also wet your hand to work with the dough. Defnitely a keeper recipe.. dangerous to have around, b/c they are addictive!"
"1","5","It seems that, like everyone else, I loved this recipe. Family couldn't stop eating. Followed recipe except used evaporated milk in the glaze."
"1","2","I had such high hopes for this recipe, but it just didn't happen. The cookies came out flat as pancakes with jam centers. I was even sure to refrigerate the batter (and I say batter because it was SO wet and sticky) before rolling it. I ended up adding in an extra cup of flour before the cookies would hold their shape. 2 cups of flour just doesn't seem like it can be the right amount to be combined with a cup of butter. The recipe I used prior to this one called for 3/4 cup of butter and 3 1/2 cups of flour, but I thought I'd try this one because I wanted something less flour-y tasting. With the addition of the extra flour these came out just fine, but I'm still going to look for the perfect thumbprint recipe."
"1","5","I didn't have any almond extract so I used vanilla in the cookies and lemon juice in the glaze. I strained freezer raspberry jam for the filling to get rid of the seeds. My husband loved them!"
"1","3","They're tasty, but hard to keep from flattening out and staying togther. They're almost...too short...several of them fell apart. Very tasty, but will use a different recipe next time."
"1","4","I found the cookies very easy to make. The only thing I would change is that I would use vanilla instead of almond."
"1","5","Simply wonderful! Nobody can eat just one of these cookies! It may take a little more work to make them, but it doesn't take any time at all for them to disappear!"
"1","5","THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES EVER! Sometimes my cookies don't turn out but these ones are hard to mess up. The drizzle makes them perfect don't leave it out! I substituted almond for vanilla and they taste wonderful. I like them so much I am going to make another batch!!!! THANKS DEE!!!"
"1","5","One of the best cookie recipes here. I changed it a little and rolled it with chopped pecans and added a double chocolate chip in the middle or thumbprinted it with jam. Also tried rolling it in white sugar, but it turned out a little harder than the others. Still a very good recipe. Thanks Dee!"
"1","5","wonderful quick recipe--I will make it again and try chocolate kisses instead of jam for variety"
"1","5","These were really good. My husband couldn't stop eating them. For variation, I added really finely chopped pecans along with the jam. On some, I drizzled some melted milk chocolate."
"1","5","Fabulous! I needed to add a bit of extra milk to the confectioners' sugar."
"1","5","These are great. Easy and delicious."
"1","5","These cookies taste great and look so impressive!"
"1","5","A very cute cookie, yummy & easy to make."
"1","5","Yummy!!! These are very good. I was surprised at how easy they were too. I made them for a Valentine's potluck and got lots of compliments. I could not find seedless rasberry jam so I used an all fruit starwberry jam. Who knew something without chocolate could be so good!!!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! EVERYONE LOVES THEM! THE BEST RASPBERRY COOKIES I'VE EVER HAD!"
"1","5","These are fabulous!!! What a change from the traditional christmas cookies! I made them a little too large so I would make the balls smaller and add less jam but they are absolutely scrumptious!!!!! They had to be handed out to nieces/ nephews so there would be enough for everyone to try one.... triple batch next year!"
"1","5","I futzed with this a little...I didn't use raspberry jam or the glaze. Instead, I used sour cherry preserves and they were a hit! I took three dozen to work and they were gone in a flash. The absolute most wonderful recipe for thumbprint cookies I have ever tried - thanks Dee!"
"1","4","These were very simple to make...I tried them with apricot preserves and they came great too! The consistency is like a linzer tart, but better!"
"1","5","This is now my all time favorite Christmas cookie! I have never liked thumbprint cookies but couldn't resist trying it after reading the reviews - omigosh! DELICIOUS! Next time I'll make a double recipe so I'll have enough for guests ... THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE."
"1","2","After all tyhe raves, I couldn't wait to make these. They were flat, tasteless and the only good part was the jam! I should have realized 4 1/2 cups of flour was an awful lot since the rest of the ingredients are usually listed for use with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of flour. I just reread the recipe, I made a BIG mistake. Sorry. Will try them again Very disappointed!"
"1","4","We loved this recipe. We changed a few things. We don't like almond extract so instead we did vanilla extract. And we didn't have raspberry jam so we used strawberry. They turned out great!"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe! My husband doesn't like raspberry so I used a bunch of different jams in the cookies. Turned out great. I would also add more almond extract and keep a watchful eye on the flour. These cookies bear an extremely close taste to linzer cookies, but more delicate, and without all the work. I'm sold on them."
"1","5","Great cookie! Really delicious and very easy. I had a problem with the glaze though. I added more milk for easier consistency and I waited until cookies were cool to prevent drizzled glaze from spreading all over the cookie. If you're new to baking (like me) this is an awesome recipe!"
"1","5","Best cookies ever, easy and delicious, I sprinkled confectioner sugar instead of glaze and went a little heavier on the almond extract, also used jam from a squeeze jar, easier for me and the kids. Highest recommendation!"
"1","5","This recipe turned out great but the only problem was being able to roll the dough into balls-it seemed to crumble when I tried. I added just a little bit of water and it helped."
"1","5","This is a great cookie. The kids eat them as fast as they're made."
"0","5","Everyone's favorite when I make these. It's absolutely best when you make your own raspberry jam."
"0","5","I LOVE these cookies -- and so does the rest of the family! Brought them twice for kids' school events as well, and they were a hit. At the suggestion of a friend, I added lightly toasted sesame seeds on top prior to baking -- perfect!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! I made them for some company earlier this year and they were a hit!"
"0","5","AwSome just made them mmmmmmm"
"0","5","These little cookies turned out to be a huge hit!"
"0","5","Heavenly. Added one fresh raspberry (from our backyard) to the center of each cookie, right on top of the jam -- charming effect to this attractive cookie. Had no problems with them coming out flat, but I did not soften the butter. After baking them with my daughter an hour ago, I just made *another* batch -- they're that good. Kudos to Dee for this delicious recipe!"
"0","5","I have tried making these cookies many times and they were delicious! My only suggestion is to add two times the amount almond extract in the cookie dough."
"0","5","I use this recipe all the time for receptions, showers and special events. I have found to not use chilled jam as it will cause a flat cookie. As well as cooking too long will cause a flat cookie. Keeping with the lower time of 14 minutes & following the directions will result in a fluffy cookie as the picture shown. One of my favorites to bake & eat."
"0","5","So easy, yet so beautiful and delicious!"
"0","5","better than anything I have ever bought!"
"0","5","This was an easy recipie where the end product looks amazing, much more effortful, and tastes amazing. My husband's kids loved them. This will definitely be a keeper for me."
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","Yum, followed exactly and was perfect!"
"0","4","These cookies are labor intensive, but they are worth it! However, they are not that difficult to make. I followed others suggestions about refrigerating them and on average do so for 10-20 minutes. My first batch, which I chilled without the jam for roughly 15 minutes then I added the jam and put them back again for exactly 10 minutes to cool down the jam, came out perfectly round. The second batch which I assembled and chilled for exactly 10 minutes did flatten a bit. I want to think that it was the pan which is a light colored one which tends to get hotter than my dark ones....So I would say do the chilling in a 2 step approach first without jam for 10 minutes then fill them up and put them 5 to 10 minutes more in the fridge for optimal results. One thing I noticed was that I was having a hard time getting the dough to compact so I added 1 to 2 tbsp of water and VOILA! I could use my 1.5' scoop and ended up with exactly 36 cookies! My suggestion to mix the dough would be to use a pastry blender and use the butter straight out of the fridge but also cut them in small pieces. The temperature of the butter is the key for shortbread. If it is too warm, your shortbread won't come out right and will flatten out. Also add the extra 1/4 cup of flour to get them thicker and less prone to flattening out. EDIT: I decided to try the recipe again following the recipe as is and the cookies came out a flat but not extremely. My recommendation is definitely go with the suggestions."
"0","5","These were simple and fun to make with the kids because it has so few ingredients and were very hands-on. I used a plastic bag for the jam with just a tiny bit of end snipped off so the kids could squeeze just the right amount of jam in each cookie without making a mess. We also used the Chapstick tip. I had to add an extra 1/2 C of powdered sugar to the frosting to make it stiff enough. I think I inadvertently added too much milk. We used a fork to drizzle but the bag trick would probably work a little better."
"0","5","Amazingly good! Perfect exactly how it's written."
"0","5","OMG...These were fantastic! Hugh hit with the few who were lucky enough to snag one. I loved how pretty they were...really made my cookie trays gorgeous! Sometimes pretty are not the best tasting...Not the case with these. YUMMY! :-) Kinda a pain to make, but sooooo worth it! Used wooden spoon handle to make indent. Put glaze in baggie and cut off corner to drizzle glaze...I doubled the recipe and still could have eaten more! :-) :-) Lite, delicate, delish! :-) :-) :-) :-)"
"0","5","I used vanilla instead of almond extract. These are great."
"0","5","Easy, fast and delicious!! I'm a novice baker and found it super easy to do.. The only bad thing about these cookies is that I loved them and I almost ate them all by self. Eating them the following day makes them taste better. Yummy"
"0","5","I liked this recipe. Easy to make, yummy enough! It was a bit too much sugar to my liking, but I it's my thing with all the recipes, always. So if you're like me, reduce sugar to 1/4 of a cup. Also, I didn't do the icing, still was delicious"
"0","5","Made these for Christmas...they were a huge hit. Going go make them for Valentine's Day."
"0","5","I loved this recipe, it's easy and so good. Everyone loves these cookies when I take them somewhere, This is a keeper!!"
"0","5","Delicious, really tasty"
"0","5","I just made it today my family love this.thank you for this recipe"
"0","5","I wanted to try making different cookies for Christmas this year. THIS was the cookie that everyone LOVED!!! I will be making these again."
"0","5","Absolutely amazing! They are so yummy and delicious. I can never get the white coating to come out right but you honestly don't even need it!"
"0","5","Made this every year for xmas, everyone loves it especially my children"
"0","5","Amazing! Made recipe exactly but did use parchment paper and did make fairly small cookies, these were delicious- my entire family LOVED these!"
"0","5","Scrumptious! They were a hit at the office party."
"0","5","These were by far the best edition to my Christmas baking list in 2014! Some I made as written, some of the dough I made plain without the jam. Those I dipped half in chocolate or placed icing in the center and added sliced almonds. THANK YOU so much for posting this recipe."
"0","5","I made these for the first time and they were a big hit. My husband don't usually like sweets except for chocolate chip cookies. These are now one of his favorites. Like other reviewers said, I made into balls and put them in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Took them out and used a wine cork for the center and then put the jam in a ziplock bag to pipe into the center. Those tricks help a lot so you don't get the jam all over. I also did use parchment paper on the cookie sheets to be on the safe side. Great recipe."
"0","2","The dough tasted wonderful, but the cookies ran flat in the oven, even though I put them in the fridge for 20 min prior to baking, as some suggested. After baking they tasted too buttery (I guess that is possible) and too oily in texture."
"0","5","This recipe was delicious!! I didn't have any trouble with the dough and I had melted the butter, although not completely. I used a little medicine dropper/pusher to do the drizzle. The drizzle required just a little bit more milk. The almond flavor is subtle but distinct, and absolutely wonderful!!"
"0","5","Just made for the second time and they turned out beautiful like always. I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I used Welch's Red Raspberry spread, which seems to have a thicker consistency. Also, I make 1 1/2 times the glaze, when designing the cookies with the glaze I use a continuous line from cookie to cookie, which I find much easier. Everyone that has tried these cookies has loved them."
"0","3","I tried the various hints to keep the cookies from spreading (my butter wasn't soft, refrigerated the dough overnight, and even put in freezer after shaping them), yet they still spread."
"0","5","these cookies are great but whatever you do DO NOT cook on parchment paper, i did this and the bottom of the cookies burned and the top was uncooked ):"
"0","4","Great, exactly what I was looking for"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, used the end of a chapstick to make the indents, and chilled for 10-15 min prior to popping in the over per reviewer recommendations, and they came out perfect! Yum!"
"0","5","New favorite cookie"
"0","5","wow these were so simple and easy to make. one thing that i found was that when you make the thumbprint, if it cracks make sure you redo that one or the jam leaks out when cooked. I am going to skip the glaze as we found it way tooo sweet and too strong a almond flavor. 3/4 of a tsp is way too much for only 1/2 cup of icing sugar, I also had to add more milk to make the drizzle work."
"0","5","These are phenomenal. I did not have raspberry jam so I used blackberry. Delicious. I will be making again and again."
"0","5","Husband claimed it was the best dessert I've ever made. I did double the crust recipe and add a little nutmeg per recommendations."
"0","5","These cookies were so good. My favorite from all of the cookies I have ever made! The almond flavor was so good! Will keep this recipe for years to come!"
"0","5","Wonderful Recipe! delicious Cookies! I substituted strawberry jam because it was all I had at the time, I do not recommend. The raspberry really makes the cookie! wonderful recipe, Thank you for sharing!!"
"0","5","I made 2 batches for a holiday party in addition to other cookies like chocolate chip and tangerine butter cookies - these thumbprint cookies were the biggest hit by far! They came out amazing and tasted like they were bought fresh at a bakery. Will definitely be making these again!"
"0","5","I made these yesterday and everyone absolutely loved them! Easy to make, and pretty to look at. I did use the suggestion made by Marcie (December 2006) Often when I bake, my cookies have a tendency to flatten out as she mentioned and her suggestions were spot on!"
"0","5","I have been making these cookies for years. They are EVERYONES favorites. They are even fantastic when made with gluten free flour. The only change I make is using water in the icing instead of milk. I have three tips. 1) Do not use cheap butter. Every time I've used Costco butter or off brands, the cookies spread out and burned on the bottom. 2) Use parchment paper. 3) Use jam with seeds."
"0","5","Just completed a batch and my husband and I thought 'very good'. Mine don't look like the pic above as the drizzle was messier. I couldn't find seedless raspberry jam so I used Polaner All Fruit (seedless) and it worked great. A little less than a 1/4 teaspoon on each. I used the top of the extract bottle to make my indent for the fruit and it was the perfect size. Used a melon baller for cookie size. Wish I had refrigerated before baking as recommended by Sherry G. Then the jam might not have run on some. No problem though cause we'll eat those. Can't wait to share."
"0","5","These are so yummy! I just made these with my daughter-- so easy and they taste yummy too.. Very tender crisp cookie. Be careful not to press the cookie too much because they spread out when you bake them. These are delicious!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome,I love them.I am making cookies for Christmas and was looking for ideas.I came across this recipe and I thought I would give it a try.I made one batch and tried one,and I thought they were great,and then I made another batch of them.I did what many people suggested to do by putting the cookies in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking,and they turned out perfect."
"0","5","LOVED IT! I'm usually in charge of making cookies every Christmas, and I decided to try these out this year. They are perfect! I used vanilla extract instead of anise, since I couldn't find any. My boyfriend loved them as well. Even my roommate had to comment on how good they smelled since he couldn't eat any."
"0","5","Very tasty and delicious! I thought the first batch was a little sweet so I took a little sugar off the top when making the second dough batch. Would highly recommend."
"0","5","One of our favorite cookies! I always make them around Christmas as a special treat!"
"0","5","these were amazing mine did not look as pretty though but going to make another batch to try again"
"0","4","You CAN use vanilla extract in this recipe, I don't know why others had trouble with that unless they used imitation vs real. I did use an extra bit of flour (1/4c) as previously mentioned just in case,and they came out just fine. If your cookie dough gets cracks in the sides as you form the depression in the center, its a bit too cold, use your fingers to seal those cracks or your jam will seep out."
"0","5","Delicious but spread out. Wish I had read the reviews before cooking. Next time will take others advise and use 1/4 c. more flour, smaller cookie scoop and chill dough before cooking. Absolutely delicious."
"0","4","Very good. Sweet enough without icing on top. But just my preference. Kids loved them. I used crabapple jelly."
"0","5","Love these cookies, I'm going to try them without the glaze next time. Just a tad too sweet with the glaze!"
"0","5","I baked for 12 minutes and they cane out perfectly! I followed recipe exactly otherwise."
"0","5","These were terrific! I made them exactly like the recipe said. We used a chapstick container like another person suggested and it was the perfect size. The glaze made them perfect."
"0","5","Everyone loves these and I'm sure they will be a seasonal favorite in the cookie gift tin."
"0","5","Perfection... my new favorite christmas cookie! Dont change a thing. Looks so pretty and tastes delish."
"0","5","I tried this recipe with Becel instead of butter because it is what I had on hand. I really enjoyed this recipe. It was simple to do and fun. I would recommend using butter if you have it because the taste is wildly different if you use anything else. I still enjoyed them without using butter, but if you want to have the perfect little shortbread, you must use butter."
"0","5","This is my favorite cookie, not to sweet."
"0","4","Easy to make with a great taste."
"0","4","My husband chose this recipe for me to make for his birthday and I was skeptical at first because I am not that good at working with shortbread type recipes. But with a little help from some reviews of those who have tried before me., I was very impressed with how they came out! Very tasty, delicate, and pretty! I highly recommend refrigerating the dough for 20 minutes before forming into balls. That does seem to help with the handling and keeping them from cracking while baking. Also, dont over-fill the holes with preserves. I had a Nivea chapstick thing (long) that I used to make the holes and it did a great job because I had more leverage to twist the hole with. Turned out nice and round and deep enough to hold a good amount of jam. But you really have to treat these cookies with a gentle touch once out of the oven. Dont man-handle them especially while they are still warm or they will break on you. I definitely recommend them! They were pretty easy too!"
"0","5","Amazing cookies and elegant"
"0","5","So easy and delicious."
"0","5","What a great easy recipe! We decided to get a bit adventurous and place some pepper jelly in a few...WOW, think I've found a new FAV!! The spicy and sweet was a perfect pair."
"0","5","I use homemade apricot or plum or blackberry jam (whatever I'm using from storage) .Yum yum! Always a hit."
"0","5","these cookies came out fabulous. prepared exactly as stated except I used a small ice cream scoop, put the cookie sheet with raw dough into freezer as oven was preheating. do not make too deep an impression for jam. now I have to go exercise because they are so rich and wonderful. enjoy! (make these cookies!)"
"0","5","So good! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sweet tooth. :D"
"0","5","A word of advice about cookies like these - do not substitute margarine for the butter; that will make them flatten out. I made the dough as written and then tossed it in the frig for a couple of hours. The dough got a little hard and I had to handle it a bit to get it softer - perhaps just an hour in the frig would have been better! I used the handle of one of my kitchen knives to make the hole in the middle. None of my cookies were flat and none leaked. Make sure the cookie sheet is cooled before putting your second batch on it or you may see some flattening! I did have to use more than 1 tsp of milk for the glaze."
"0","5","Very simple and delicious"
"0","5","These are so close to a Sunset magazine recipe. I had years ago for rich roll cookies with raspberry jam. But these are even tastier and so much easier! It is my holiday go to now"
"0","4","Cookies came out really well. The only change I did was use strawberry jam. My family greatly enjoyed them. Will definitely make this soon again :)"
"0","5","I loved this recipe, had no trouble with it at all, so good, I will definatly be making more in the future."
"0","4","These cookies were a huge hit at work! I think next time I might use a little less almond extract, just for personal preference. I substituted raspberry preserves for strawberry, simply because I didn't have any. They turned out delicious anyway! No issues with them being flat."
"0","5","This recipe came out PERFECTLY. I used 1/2 tsp of lavender extract and 1/2 vanilla and I put peach preserves in the center (I really just made a completely different cookie). One thing that I think helped is that I added an egg yolk to the dough.. Delicious!"
"0","5","Fabulous cookies! I made them for the first time when I was hosting Christmas at my house. I made 7 different kinds of cookies and these were by far the most popular! I followed the recipe exactly except added 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond flavoring to the glaze. Wonderful! Today I am going to make them with lime juice in the dough and lime curd in place of the preserves."
"0","2","Mix with mixer. I mixed by hand and it came out way too dry. Fell apart on me"
"0","5","Made these at Christmas time and they were Awesome and so quick and easy to make! Great recipe if you are in a hurry."
"0","5","Sooooo good!"
"0","5","Tried this recipe. My younger girls loved it. I made them for a to share at a live nativity evening and they were gone the fastest and some asked me if I'd make more for the next evening."
"0","4","First time baker. Not too bad. I used the end of a 1/2 tablespoon to make the indent. My jam exploded too after reading the reviews a lot of people had this problem. Although my jam exploded still came out pretty good."
"0","5","These cookies turned awesome and the family loved them."
"0","1","This wasn't even dough it ended up being sand!! Would not hold it's shape,tried to roll it into balls and it just fell apart!!"
"0","5","We made these cookies for Christmas this year. Loved them! Took the suggestion from another reviewer by decreasing the oven temp by 10 degrees, added 1/4 cup more flour, and placed the cookies in the freezer for 10 mins before baking. They turned out perfect!"
"0","4","I thought these were very good, simple cookies. I chilled the dough in the fridge as suggested in other recipes, and the cookies didn't become overly flat and the jam stayed in place. The icing came out in one big ball though, so I kept having to add milk to thin it out. I'd love to try adding chopped walnuts to this to give it a little something extra!"
"0","4","After reading other reviews, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour (but needed a tiny bit of milk for moistness), I rolled the balls small and used a chapstick to make the indentation. I then put them outside (it's winter in the Yukon...no need to use the freezer to chill!) for 10-15 mins and baked for 15 mins, turning pan around about 1/2 way through. They were so pretty and turned out perfect. Delicious!"
"0","5","What many people fail to realize when baking is that different flours have different absorbtion rates. It is better to put in a little less than check the consistency. If it is too wet than add more flour until it all holds together but is not dry. Refrigerating any butter based cookie dough usually makes it less sticky and easier to roll into balls. Also, chilling before baking helps them not flatten so much. This is an exellent recipe. I used melted white chocolate instead of the frosting for the tops. I don't like almond flavor so I used vanilla and I always use brown sugar instead of white when I can, I just like the flavor better. I have been baking for 50 years and I do know cookie doughs."
"0","5","great recipe. cookies came out as expected. would make these again."
"0","4","fell apart so i molded with my hands into ball, flattened ball with bottom of cup, fixed the sides that cracked, used small measuring spoon for a perfect 'thumbprint'. liked without frosting. frosting too sweet"
"0","5","Loved these!"
"0","5","The taste was delicious! Not overly sweet, but very buttery. Followed others suggestions and made the cookies, then put them in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to baking. Used small cookie scoop (2 tsp), yielded 2 1/2 dozen. The 'icing' measurements were incorrect. I used 1.5 Tbsp milk to make it workable."
"0","5","Great Cookie. Easy make."
"0","5","Instead of butter I used Margarin (I can't believe its not butter worked great). During the mixing of the butter and sugar I placed the mixture in the microwave for 30 secs to soften the Margarin further. I used a whisk to beat it till smooth. I then added the flour 'slowly' while whisking it in until the the last 1/2 cup I had to use a wooden spoon. Dough came out great and even the cookies came out fantastic with 2' dough balls (though I keep with 1 and 1/2 inch balls to make a better yield). Instead of a chap-stick cap I used a cap from a hairspray bottle (almost the same size as a chap-stick cap then measured in 1/2 teaspoon of Raspberry jam. I doubled the recipe and it yielded approximately 28 tasty cookies. Deeeeeeeeeelicious !!!"
"0","4","This is a decent recipe. I also had some spreading of jelly but my oven is terrible (in a rental). I cooked them at a lower temp and just remembered to take them out BEFORE browning. This recipe doesn't have eggs so there is no worry about getting sick if they are a bit under done."
"0","5","Made these as part of my Christmas mix. They are almost gone. My BF loves them. I will have to make more so they can go on the tray and also some for him. These are to die for."
"0","5","Delightful! So easy and great flavor. I made them with my niece for Thanksgiving. They were a huge hit. My son begged me to make more because they were the first to go. I'm adding them to my list of Christmas cookies this year. The almond extract gives them a very distinct almond/buttery flavor. If you like almond you'll love these cookies. Great with coffee. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","These were Fabulous !!! I took the advice of others and put them in the fridge for about 15-20min before baking. Popped them in the oven and they turned out just like the picture. We included them on our Christmas plates for friends/family and they were everyones favorite :) Thanks for sharing the recipe"
"0","5","These were lovely! I used 1/4 cup of almond flour in addition to the 2 cups of flour and they came out fine. I also used blueberry preserves and added a little bit after they were baked because I was afraid to put in too much to begin with. Ive made these before (another recipe) and I always overfilled them and made a huge mess!"
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful! I am always looking for new cookies to add to my Christmas collection. I'm sure these will be requested for years to come. Thanks!"
"0","5","This is a perfect cookie. Don't even think about messing with this."
"0","4","Some of the cookies sprung a leak, so didnt all look good. Taste was great and the ones that didnt break lloked nice."
"0","5","Love this! I substituted reduced sugar cherry jam as I had no raspberry but I think the raspberry will be even better as it'll be a tad sweeter (making a second batch as I write this). My husband and son couldn't get enough of it and were so disappointed when there were none left. The funny thing is that I don't usually like anything with almond extract but in this one it worked perfectly. And so easy to make. Thanks!"
"0","5","They are delicious! I used the tube of chapstick method (thanks previous reviewer!) to make the hole in the cookie and used small spoons to put the jelly in the hole. I will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","These are delicious! Tips: use welch's natural raspberry spread. It did not run at all and tasted so good. Might be because no corn syrup. Also, I had to experiment with almond amount because the recipe was unclear about quantity of almond in cookie dough as well as the glaze. Also I had to experiment with glaze because when I used quantities in recipe it was firm and not runny enough so I added extra milk. Cookies do flatten out but that didn't bother me."
"0","5","It took me two batches to figure it out - I had to add a tablespoon of water to the mix as it was crumbly for me. I kept the rolled ball in my hand and then made the hole with chapstick tube. My hand kept it from being too crumbly and held the dough together. I did as suggested and chilled the dough before putting it in the oven. It really did stay puffed up and didn't flatten out. I used melted white chocolate for the drizzle over the cookies. Very tasty! I'd make again."
"0","5","Easy and delicious!"
"0","5","I can't say how much I love this cookie! My husband doesn't like shortbread or almonds...but ate a plate full the first day. And asked me to make more. That doesn't happen often. Its definitely a keeper."
"0","4","I Followed The Directions And After Reading Through A Bunch Of ReviewsThe End Results Were Pretty Good. I Did Have A Slight Issue Forming The Rolled Balls. But Overall, Cookies Were Moist And Tasty. I Did Take The Advise And STIck The Cookies In The Freezer For Ten Minutes. PresentatioN WIse they Cracked Slightly But Over Happy With Recipe"
"0","4","The recipe was ok...flavor great...But I wanted something more with pizzaz so I left the almond extract out of the glaze and added 1/2 tsp coconut extract...the almond, raspberry, and coconut was a great combination."
"0","5","Excellent cookie! Made them for the first time. One piece of advice - make the balls smaller than 1 1/2 inches - my cookies (while delicious) were way too big. This is supposed to be a 'tea time' type cookie - not a huge one. Also, I only had unsalted butter but added maybe a pinch of salt - I didn't have any issues with taste/dough rising. Great cookie!"
"0","5","Amazing...very easy and verrry good"
"0","5","Love this cookie. Pretty and actually very easy. I did add about 1/4 more flour and I used a rounded measuring teaspoon to scoop out the same amount each time. I rolled half into little balls and stuck them in the fridge while I rolled the second half of the dough. Once done rolling the first 1/2 of little balls were nice and chilled. I placed them on parchment to bake and since I didn't have a handy chapstick I used the bottom of one of my daughter's markers to make the indention.Came out perfect and yummy."
"0","5","Tried the recipe. Loved it. Do remember to chill dough. Also for a little change of pace, I used sour patch cherry drops instead of jam. The kids loved it (me too!)"
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely foolproof. I don't do anything different to the recipe except besides the raspberry filling, I also do apricot and blueberry and they are amazing. Best thumbprint recipe in years!"
"0","3","I wasn't wowed with this recipe. They were ok. I used unsalted butter and Polaner All Fruit seedless raspberry jam."
"0","5","I followed the directions for this recipe EXACTLY, and they turned out amazing. They are delicious and will be on my holiday baking list from here on out."
"0","5","Loved it. Followed it closely, but did NOT add preserves before baking. I used a baggie and piped the jam in AFTER baking. Also piped the icing sugar. The almond flavour in the cookie as well as the icing is lovely. I also pulled the tray out of the oven a couple minutes before they were done to 're-indent' the thumbprint, which I made with the end of my wooden spoon. Will bake these every Christmas. Might buy some mint jelly next time to make red AND green cookies!"
"0","5","I gave this recipe 5 stars for taste and ease in preperation. However, I found that if I refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours (or overnight) before making the balls of dough, the cookies hold their shape much better. Otherwise, they do tend to be a bit flat. Tried it with strawberry jam as well as a vanilla extract and blueberry jam variety...all were delicious!"
"0","5","I make these all the time! using Strawberry LOW SUGAR jam. They're delicious! I prepare them, jelly and all and place them in the fridge for maybe 15 minutes, so they won't flatten."
"0","2","Too sweet. The glaze is not able to drizzle with only 1 tsp of milk and 3/4 tsp almond. The 3/4 tsp of almond is overpowering for the glaze and the cookies are so sweet that they don't need glaze anyways. Otherwise they came out right. I used home made cranberry which made them look festive."
"0","5","YUM! Super easy, super tasty!"
"0","5","These cookies are melt in your mouth good! I prefer to make them plain without the raspberry and they're still unreal!"
"0","5","I LOVE these cookies, they always turn out so great! I always add a little more almond extract to give it a little more flavor."
"0","3","These were just ok - a little dry for my taste. If you like shortbreads, you may like these."
"0","1","the tough is too sticky and loose to be rolled into a ball. Would not use recipe again."
"0","5","Mine turned delicious:) My only complaint was the amount of almond extract for the glaze (too strong) other than that they were so tasty. You can also create your own cookie shapes, excellent for halloween."
"0","5","really enjoyed this recipe, I have made it many times. This last time I used peach/apricot jam instead of raspberry. The cookies turned out great and were a nice change."
"0","5","Delicious! The texture is great! I added about a 1/2 teaspoon extra to both the dough and the icing. Also I followed the recommendation of chilling the cookies for a few minutes and reducing the temperture to 340 to avoid flattening ( I also had to bake these an extra 6 or 7 minutes). I used the chapstick trick recommended to make the thumbprint. These came out great and did not flatten!"
"0","5","So good, I just had to add a little more almond extract o the cookie, these were gone in 2 minutes, I have made them 3 times in the last week. They are sooooo easy and quick to make."
"0","5","I LOVE THESE! They are pretty easy to make, and are sooo yummy. They always disappear really quickly in my family! I like using Smucker's sugar free raspberry jelly in them. I've made these 3 times now. Last time I made them, hours after baking the jelly in the middle remained runny and wouldn't solidify, and I have yet to find out why this happened.. But they still tasted awesome.  Make sure not to fill the thumbprints too full with jam, it'll spread in the oven."
"0","5","turned out great. Used the end of my wooden handled spatula to make the holes and 1/2 tsp of raspberry jam. Will definitely make again"
"0","5","Very Yummy no changes needed."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, my entire family wanted more and I had no more left. This was a big hit and delicious too!!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I've made it couple times and they are amazing everytime. I put them in the fridge before baking like others. And added more milk to the drizzle and put it in a ziploc bag and cut the corner. Amazing!"
"0","5","This is the 1st time i review a recipe but, after trying this cookie it didn't feel right not to say something. I have always heard the term 'melt in your mouth' but i haven't really understood it until i made this recipe, they were heavenly, i followed the reviewers suggestion and put it in the freezer before baking so it'll hold its shape, will definitly make again, thank u for sharing."
"0","2","They tasted good but stuck to the pan and got really flat. I'll try making them again and hopefully they come out better next time"
"0","5","Taste great! I used strawberry preserves because I didn't have raspberry. So good I didn't need the drizzle"
"0","4","I tried this recipe and made it with a twist. Instead of raspberry jam, i put Pineapple jam, and instead of just plain milk, I added lemon juice. and let me tell you, my family enjoyed them."
"0","5","I make these almost every other week! I vary the jam flavor, using apricot or rasberry and we get the best results every time. To cut the sugar content, I don't add the drizzle on top and they are still always a big hit at home and at work!"
"0","5","Okay. I just made these. I used grape preserves because it's what I had. They are simply amazing! I need to make the a little smaller next time, but they still taste wonderful. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","4","Very delicious and buttery. I would however say that the drizzled icing makes it a bit too sweet for my taste. I will leave that part out next time."
"0","5","These are a very delicious and beautiful cookie. I did not change a thing. They looked so pretty on the Christmas cookie tray. Will definately make again."
"0","5","I loved this recipe. I did make the holes for the jam a tad smaller and chilled in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes before baking."
"0","5","These were delicious! The extra time was worth it."
"0","5","My new favorite cookie!! I added green food coloring and made mine Christmas trees! With peach, raspberry, and blackberry fillings. Added more milk to my icing too! LOVE THEM!!!"
"0","4","I made the recipe as written. They were a bit flat and oozy so I put the dough for the second batch in the freezer after I pressed and filled the impression with preserve. Chilling the dough helped it keep its shape while cooking. I pull them out as they are barely browning. This is a keeper."
"0","5","Love these cookies!!! The only thing I had to change was the amount of milk to make the glaze... I ended up using 1 TBSP rather than 1 TSP as the recipe calls for."
"0","5","These little cookies are PHENOMENAL!! The almond flavor makes these. They do flatten out while baking, so pop them in the fridge for about 10 minutes before baking. Other than that, they taste oh so delicious."
"0","5","I make theses cookies every year, for my works cookie swap. Everyone loves them, they ask me to make them all year. Sometimes I use strawberry jam."
"0","3","These tasted great but they spread out and didn't stay in the shape of thumbprints. I put them in the fridge like others suggested after assembling."
"0","5","Followed recipe to a T, delicious cookies!"
"0","3","What did I do wrong????? The dough would not come together, so I put it in the frig. and still won't. I did cut cold butter into the sugar and then used the mixer on the rest. Was this it? Hoping I can post this without leaving stars cuz it seems to be just me?"
"0","5","So delicious, no changes needed"
"0","5","I followed the recipe, but refridgerated the dough for at least an hour. Using the chap-stick tube to make the indents and I put the jam in a bag, cut the corner and squeezed the jam in the indent. I also use parchment paper. I've used melted choc for drizzling too. These always turnout great, I even used apricot jam for a pretty color combo. Geat recipe, thank you so much!!"
"0","5","VERY good cookies! They are a nice, crunchy shortbread, not soft, which some people (like my husband) do not appreciate. I love the hint of almond flavor in the dough. I rolled some of the balls in sugar before filling them with jam and that was nice, especially since I chose to leave off the glaze. My tips are to fill the thumb print with more jelly than you think you will need, and bake until the cookies are light golden so they're firm enough to hold up to the wet jam. Made mine 12 hours ago and they're still just as crisp as they were with no signs of sogginess from the jam, but that may change. Regardless, these are definitely a repeat for me and maybe next time I will try the glaze!"
"0","5","Perfection!! (I did add 1/4 tsp salt.)"
"0","5","These are delicious! But don't press your thumb in too deep otherwise the bottoms will almost fall out when they bake and spread out. And definitely wait until you see golden brown. I took mine out just too early so that also made the bottoms not set up fully. But the next batch I got just right at 18 minutes and they were absolutely delicious!!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! They melt in your mouth and disappear from the cookie tray as fast as I can make them. The only thing I highly recommend is to chill your dough for at least an hour, but overnight worked best in my case. The cookies turned out pretty flat when I didn't chill the dough. Once the dough is very firm and chilled, roll them up, use the end of a clean pen or pen cap to make your hole, and fill halfway with preserves. I added more preserves once they were out of the oven, waited a half hour before drizzling with icing, and everyone asks me for this recipe now. Just minor tweeks to this fantastic recipe is all that's needed!"
"0","5","Very good and such an easy recipe. One reviewer mentioned not softening the butter and just cutting it into the sugar as one method to ensure cookies aren't flat. I can not stand cutting in butter so I opted to just go with the original recipe first and I am so glad i did cos they turned out perfect without all that work. I made small balls and used a Chapstick to make the indentions. I didn't fill the indentions completely full, worried that they'd overflow, and now I know to fill them completely full cos the holes do open up more when baking. I put the prepared cookies in the freezer for at least 10 minutes before cooking. I think that is what made them hold up so well. I was really worried about overlooking them and I think I took some out too early. Next time I will wait til they get obviously lightly browned and then take them out - or else they are too fragile. Around Christmas time I plan to add green food coloring to the icing and these cookies will be real festive then. Oh, and I had to add quite a bit more milk to the icing to make it runnier - put it in ziplock Baggie, cut corner, and piped icing on. Next time I might add just a touch more almond extract too since I'm adding more milk. Thanks so much for this recipe!!"
"0","5","This recipe was very simple, easy to make, and delicious. Cookies are soft and delicate and not too sweet. We made a double batch and used blackberry, boisenberry, apple, and strawberry jams which were all very good. The cooking time was a bit off. I found I needed to keep them in the oven for about 25 minutes instead of 18 minutes. Oh, and my 9 year old daughter absolutely loved making the thumbprints and filling them!!!"
"0","1","I made theses twice and did not like them. They were greasy and had very little flavor. I did use almond extract and not vanilla so that was not the problem."
"0","5","Really tasty! Made recipe exactly as stated. Didn't take the time to refrigerate dough before baking. Didn't have any problem with spreading. I made small cookies - probably 1 1/2' in diameter before baking.   I didn't have a chapstick lid with me, so used a wooden spoon handle to make the 'thumbprint.' Worked great."
"0","5","Easy and taste fantastic! I used my pinky finger to make the hole in the center which worked perfectly. I made exactly as directed but added double the milk in the glaze and poured the glaze into a small plastic baggie and made a TINY hole in the bottem corner to make a great drizzle size. Defintely wait until the cookies cool completely before glazing to keep it looking pretty."
"0","4","I live in a hot & humid country. Nearly all cookie recipes I have come across requires me to add more flour. If I didn't, I'd only get a thick batter and a dough would never form, even after refrigeration. Same goes for this recipe, it needed an additional 1 cup of flour & refrigeration to get it to a workable consistency. Other than that, I would have used vanilla extract instead. To get the almond flavour, I rolled the dough in toasted almond nibs before making the indentations. I would make this again :)"
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful!! I used all natural strawberry jam instead of raspberry and I used pure lemon extract instead of almond and they were a BIG hit."
"0","5","Awesome, awesome, awesome....These cookies were super easy to make, my 2 year old helped me and had a blast making the thumb imprints and filling them with our homemade raspberry jam. They were the perfect consistency and perfect amount a sweetness. The blending of the almond and raspberry flavors will blow your mind! I will continue to make these for years to come! (I followed the recipe exactly except adding 2 tsp milk to the glaze to thin it out a bit)"
"0","5","I make these often and also always add about 1/4 cup extra of flour. They turn out great and taste AMAZING!"
"0","5","These are one my family's absolute favorites!! Try them!!"
"0","4","I put half almond extract and half vanilla because the full amount was too strong. Otherwise it was very good."
"0","5","Wow!! Excellent! I did use half butter half shortening held their shape soooooo Good!"
"0","5","wonderful recipe but I substituted raspberry preserves or you can use the solo raspberry filling as I do in Kolachkys to avoid the spread of jam. I've also used allfruit preserves - Yummy"
"0","5","These cookies were so good! I'm not usually a huge fan of cookies with fruit or jams but I was in the mood to try something new and stumbled upon this recipe. The almond extract gives the cookies a very nice flavor! I will definitely be making these again in the future! Thank you for the recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! They are a must every year at Christmas."
"0","5","Big hit! We used strawberry jam instead of raspberry but it turned out good(:"
"0","4","I haven't try one baked yet but if it is 1/2 a good as the raw dough, I know it will be great. I used the back of a 1/2 tsp spoon to push in and used the same spoon to fill with strawberry jam. this make more consistant look. My mom made this recipe at christmas and used alternating green and red marachio cherries for a more festive look"
"0","5","My family loves these cookies. I have a son with allergies to nuts so I sub vanilla for almond. Also to keep them from spreading I add a couple tblsp extra flour, lower the oven by 5 degrees and place the dough in the freezer while I wait for the oven to come up to temp! They are really great with apricot jam!"
"0","5","Very tasty! I used Polaner's All Fruit Seedless Raspberry for my filling."
"0","5","Great cookie. I substituted raspberry cake & pastry filling for raspberry jam. I put in refrig for 15 min before rolling into balls. I used my tip of my little finger to press into the cookie. I did not have any problems with the filling running."
"0","5","Fantastic! Rolled in chopped pecans/almonds mixture. Used apricot jam. Delish! Took a pic and sent to my SIL - told her they were 'Apricot Amaretto' cookies. She was VERY jealous! Seriously, very good!"
"0","5","A great cookie! I only started making these this year and so far have had to make 4 batches as they keep disappearing into everyone's mouth!!  I followed the advice to add an extra 1/4 cup flour and haven't had the jam run over or cookies crack. The problem I have is with the glaze. It seems to melt into the jam no matter how long I let them cool. Any advice?"
"0","5","A friend brought these to a cookie exchange and they were the best I'd had in a long time. I had to have the recipe to add to my holiday baking schedule. I usually make 6-8 kinds at Christmas and now I have one more to add."
"0","5","can't go wrong with this one. i put 1/4 cup ground almonds in dough and decorate with sliced almonds. then i put icing on. yummy"
"0","5","So delicious! Only modification I made was to use vanilla extract, not almond. I added 2 tsp of vanilla sugar to the icing (you can find that in the baking aisle in little packets). I had to double the icing mix - I am a big icer! I used a ziploc bag and cut the corner off of it to drizzle the icing easily. I like sweet cookies and these were sweet and definitely a keeper of a recipe!"
"0","5","very good. better than moms recipe"
"0","5","These are ALWAYS a hit. I highly recommend you just double the batch and freeze the other half. Believe me, they will get gobbled up so fast you will be thankful you have more! These make an impressive and pretty holiday cookie!"
"0","4","This is the second Christmas I've wanted to try these but I just expected a huge mess with lots of wasted butter and whats left of my raspberry jelly. This is a very simple recipe just the way it is. I formed my little balls, made the indents, stuck them in the fridge, went and watched the beginning of Saturday Night Live, took them out of the fridge, put the jam in and popped them in the oven and perfection. I baked the first tray a couple minutes too long. Seriously this is simple. I dropped a big glob on the floor when I was cleaning my KitchenAid paddle and my dog inhaled the dough!"
"0","5","I have been asked to make this recipe so many times now it has become my signature cookie. Even kids love it as well as the adults. It is easy to make and is so delicious!!"
"0","5","This is a delicious recipe! The cookies did flatten out a little bit, but the jam stayed in place. The glaze adds a great look and extra sweetness. It was easy to make and I'll definitely be making this again."
"0","5","I.LOVE.THESE!! My mother and I used to make these all the time during the holidays! The only difference is, I think we used to use jam with seeds."
"0","5","One word AWESOME!!"
"0","5","The ONLY change I made was to add about a 1/4 tsp of salt because that's just how I like my cookies, but I LOVE the raspberry jam and almond extract! Oh, I also left off the glaze - not a fan of glazes. Great base recipe with a lovely interpretation!"
"0","5","I've made these a couple of times. Sometimes they come out picture-perfect, sometimes they come out a little flat and cracked. I don't do anything differently, it almost seems to be hit or miss. I do think that popping them in the freezer before baking helps them keep their shape. No matter how they look though, they always come out delicious!"
"0","5","Made these with my family at Christmas for cookie trays. These were my personal favorite of all of them. And so pretty too! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","We've made this four times in the past month for various occasions, and it's been a hit every time. You can substitute in strawberry jam too."
"0","3","I'm not sure if I added the sugar correctly or not, but it ended up oozing out of the dough in the oven. After the cookies cooled, the final texture was very brittle and overly sweet/oily."
"0","5","All I can say is MWAH! These were perfect in their texture and flavor. We tried a couple of seedless berry jams as well as peach and apricot. All of them were consumed too quickly! I ended up making 4 different batches just so I could complete my holiday gifts! My kids would eat any broken cookies, broken meaning a little jelly had bubbled over the top of the thumbprint well. The good thing is, them eating the cookies kept me from eating the cookies! :)"
"0","5","Amazing cookies!!! They are gone quickly at my house!!"
"0","5","I have made these cookies several times with different jam. I must raspberry tasted the best! I also used vanilla instead of the almond extract. They still tasted good, but I prefer to use almond extract instead. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Fantastic cookie. I've made these several times, twice for Christmas and once for a teacher/staff luncheon. I always make extras for my family. They are without a doubt one of the favorites and always get compliments from everyone. A must try recipe!!"
"0","1","Excellent cookies and so easy to make. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Fantastic! A new favorite I will make often!"
"0","5","yum so delicious!"
"0","4","Flavor was great, Caleb loved to lick out the centers."
"0","5","WoW!!"
"0","5","The best!"
"0","3","I needed these cookies to be very pretty for a tea. Followed recipe exactly (for first batch), and the edges cracked a lot -- not so pretty. They also tasted too much like flour. For the second batch, I added 2 egg yolks to dough. After shaping and filling, I put them in the freezer for 3 minutes before baking. Much prettier result, easier to work with, and they taste better, too."
"0","5","Love, love, LOVE this recipe! Had no problems at all, and made them exactly as written, with the exception of using LEMON extract instead of the almond, only because I didn't have any almond extract. The lemon extract was delicous in these cookies! Got soooo many compliments on these! This recipe is sooo going on my 'go to' cookie list!!! Thanks!"
"0","5","Made this recipe exactly as written, came out PERFECT. I had a cookie exchange at work and everyone raved these were the best! A KEEPER :)"
"0","5","These are phenomenal cookies! Very tasty and easy to make."
"0","5","Great recipe. I always do an assortment of jams. Yum Yum!"
"0","5","Super, super easy. Used Dove Caramels. They fit the pretzel best. On my permanent 'Xmas Baking List'!"
"0","5","Followed recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I didn't have to freeze or refrigerate anything like others have said. Everyone that ate them loved these cookies!"
"0","4","These were good, I did use margarine instead of butter only because that was all I had. They did come out flat, not like the picture, but still very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","amazing"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! These were the first time I tried 'thumbprint' cookies. Followed recipe exactly and baked about 16 minutes. Did not look brown and were fairly soft, but let cool and they are perfect. I can see I will need to make another batch before Christmas. :-)"
"0","5","I love P.B. Twix and since I can not find them anymore, I used this recipe as the shortbread base for the cookie and topped it with a peanut butter mixture and dipped it in chocolate...EXCELLENT!!! The peanut butter mixture I use is a jar of vanilla icing mixed with a small jar (160z) of Peanut Butter"
"0","5","These came out excellent. Just be sure to not make the jelly well too big and follow the directions exactly, and they bake up prefectly. Top with a few sliced almonds for a little bit extra."
"0","5","I made them as stated and they turned out wonderful! Very easy. I look forward to making them again!"
"0","5","Very delicious!!"
"0","5","Awesome cookie recipe! They have the perfect texture and taste. My cookies spread out too much and flattened when I baked them. Next time I think that I'll use my cookie scooper instead. That will result in smaller balls that are handled less so the dough will stay chilled when I put them in the oven. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","Delish!! Followed recipe exactly, used 4 different jellies....sooo tasty! I think they messed up on how big to make your balls... they came out too big... make your balls 3/4 of an inch... and you will have a bite-size cookie."
"0","5","My son has egg allergies and it is hard to find cookies that he cant eat that also tatse great...These cookies are awsome! They are great tasting and easy to make. I followed the advise of other reviews and put the cookies in the refridgerator for about 10-15 minutes prior to baking them. I did not have runoff from the jam but I have made a type of thumbprint cookie before and know you have to make the indentation deep enough. I also had to add some more milk to the glaze but just eye-balled it. These cookies are easy to make, they dont take along time to prep or bake and have simple ingredients that you likely have around the house. Thats a great cookie to me!"
"0","5","YUMMY!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. I substitute 1/2 cup of ground almond meal for the flour, to make really delish. I usually don't do the glaze either and they are fantastic without. Really festive looking."
"0","5","these are the best.... ps if you microwave the iceing in a bag of 10 sec. it goes on really easy!"
"0","1","Made a long time ago don't remember them being such a mess on pan different recipe the pan was a bitch to clean jelly was more on sheet then anything else and I didn't over fill them wouldn't make them again don't even taste that great."
"0","5","My husband even said he wasn't a big fan of shortbread but he loved these!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe. I skipped the glaze and used strawberry jam instead and the cookies turned out perfect. I would suggest to add a pinch of salt to give a bit more flavor."
"0","5","My favorite Xmas cookie. Raspberry Jelly looks better than Rasp. jam which tended to 'bleed' for me. Very easy to make."
"0","5","Perfect every time. Thank you!!!"
"0","5","Amazing! I mostly followed the recipe . I used strawberry jam. I put the cookies in the freezer 10 minutes prior to baking. I also used a 1/8 measuring teaspoon to scoop out dough and make room for the jam. I used the same teaspoon to fill the cookies with jam. Nothing spilled out."
"0","5","These are my absolute FAVORITE cookies to make and EAT! YUMMMYY!! Thanks for the delicious recipe! =)"
"0","1","Didn't turn out well. Followed the reciped to a T but the dough was far too dry. I thought I goofed up and so I made another batch. They turned out awful. if you put any pressure on the dough, it breaks because it is too dry. So the 'thumbprint' cookies couldn't handle any pressure. I had to improvise and shape them on the cookie sheet itself. I cooked them and they were nothing to rave about. Very dry and completely void of flavor (except for the jelly spot) Wouldn't recommend."
"0","4","These cookies were great. The recipe was easy to follow and my 4 year old son loved them."
"0","2","I agree with previous reviews- these cookies flattened when they were baked. I added an extra 1/4 C of almond flour to the last half of the batch (after baking the first half), and refrigerated them as well, which helped."
"0","5","Easy recipe for delicious cookies!"
"0","5","So easy, so delicious."
"0","5","EASY A+ I got it right the first time, but instead of almond extract I used vanilla. I don't know why others had the flat issue, but mine was great and kept there shape. I filled them with chocolate and drizzled them with white vanilla icing."
"0","3","These turned out kind of flat and the flavor was ok but not great. I read some of the other reviews and will try them again using some of their suggestions."
"0","5","These are amazingly good, you won't beleive it!"
"0","3","Okay but would probably not make again."
"0","5","This is by far the best cookie I have ever made. People are always asking me to make them, however the recipe that I make uses way more jam then a half a cup. I make my own jam and use almost a whole jar when I make them which amounts to around a cup. But an easy cookie to make and even better to eat!"
"0","5","Great recipe...everyone loved it...the only thing I changed was the extract to vanilla and they come out fine. I also used margarine since that is what we always have in the household and it worked fabulous."
"0","3","I wasn't too sure about how the dough turned out, I found it was crumbly and didn't stick well togethe on the pan at first, but I seen on one of the reviews to freeze or chill the dough first, I might try that and see how it does? If I'm wrong could someone give me a newb cook/baker some pointers? I'm also wondering if it could be the amount of flour or substituting the almond extract for vanilla. I know others have done that and have been successful with thier adjustments. Tasty recipe though over all."
"0","5","These were fabulous! Perhaps I rolled them on the larger size because the recipe only yielded around 20 cookies. I too used vanilla in place of the almond extract only because it is what I had on hand without running to the store just for almond extract and they turned out wonderfully! I used homemade strawberry jam and used orange extract for the glaze. Yum!"
"0","5","Just made a variation of this recipe and it came out great. Instead of almond extract, i used vanilla. and instead of raspberry jam, i used orange marmalade (i love the sweet/bitter thing). I splashed in a little amaretto liquer as well. Also a quick tip...make sure you use salted butter. It gives it a balanced flavor. Enjoy!"
"0","5","If I could give it more stars I would! If they last 2 days in my house....Absolutely wonderful!"
"0","5","I've made this recipe a few times now, and they never have turned out flat. I once read in a review in order to ensure cookies will hold their shape in the oven, it's necessary to chill them in the fridge first. I do this for all the cookies I bake now, and never have the flattening issue anymore. My favorite variation on this recipe is substituting vanilla for the almond and using homemade vanilla blackberry jam :) Thanks! These are just like my Grandma used to make!"
"0","4","These were not what I was thinking of. I didnt care for the raspberry jam. The cookie was good!"
"0","5","These are fantastic. Absolutely delicious! The dough is so good though, it's hard to get them all in the oven. Mine turned out very large, so will make smaller balls next time."
"0","5","These were the best cookies ever!!! Tasted just like lora doone's shortbread cookies with black raspberry jam. It was delicious! The reason others were having theres turn out flat is because they were over mixing DONT over mix and you cookies will turn out right! Thanks for the awesome recipe! Will be making these again soon! :D"
"0","1","Wow - this recipe didn't work for me at all."
"0","4","These cookies are very easy to make. Follow the tips about refrigerating the dough and jam about 15-20 minutes before baking. Works like a charm. Make sure you don't over-bake them! I baked my 1-inch cookies for about 10-11 min and they were perfect. I used too little jam. I guess I was afraid that it'll overflow like it did for the other reviewers, but I just added more jam after baking and it still tasted good."
"0","4","These were delicious, they melted in my mouth, but the next day they were hard as a rock. They harden very easily!"
"0","5","Made these along with several other cookies at Christmas time to give to friends and family. I had so many positive comments on these. My children and I will make these each Christmas from now on."
"0","5","I used vanilla instead of almond extract, and did not add the glaze. They were delicious filled with cherry preserves on most and peach jam on a couple. Baked on parchment paper."
"0","5","Come to mama!! These are the fastest, bestest, most delicious cookie ever!! I used blackberry jam. So easy!! I will definately put this in my 'Hey mom, I need cookies in 30 minutes file'!!"
"0","5","This recipe for shortbread was delicious. I put a little extra sugar (maybe a Tbsp or two) to flatten out the cookies, then dipped in melted chocolate."
"0","5","Mine were definitely not pretty, but oh so delicious!"
"0","5","Delicious! I've made these cookies for holiday and other parties and they're always a hit. Once, I brought them to a catered office Christmas party and everyone said they were better than the ones from the caterers. Oops! Since I'm allergic to almonds, I use vanilla extract with no trouble. Also, I've tried a few different jams (apricot, blackberry) but the consensus seems to be raspberry. I actually prefer it with the seeds. Oh, and I definitely recommend using something (I use the top of the extract bottle) instead of a thumb to make the holes for the jam. Highly recommended."
"0","5","I made these cookies exactly as the receipe stated and they are sooo unbeleivablely good. So Easy to make, I made some cranberry walnut Jam last year and was trying to run down my stock, It made a wonderfully tasty treat. And looked beautiful !!!! I will be adding this cookie to my Christmas platter :)"
"0","5","Love these, grew up with them, the flavor comes out more when they have been sitting than warm and fresh. Yum!"
"0","3","These turned out very flat, nothing like a thumbprint cookie. I was really excited to try this out with the good star rating but will not use this one again."
"0","5","Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture, but they were delicious! I served them at a party and got rave reviews!"
"0","5","Excellent....my great Aunt even asked me for the receipe and she is a cookie expert!"
"0","5","This is a delicious, easy-to-make cookie that I've enjoyed making several times. I like it with Marionberry jam, but otherwise followed the recipe and directions exactly. Thank you, Dee!"
"0","5","I make these every year at Christmas and they are always a big hit, everyone loves them. I have to be careful or I will eat the whole batch."
"0","5","An excellent holiday cookie."
"0","5","These are great, easy, and surprisingly quick to make. Simple and sweet cookies that are perfect for a tea party! The only suggestion I have is to be careful with the Almond extract - it can be very strong if you use too much. I think I will use less Almond extract the next time I bake these. I may leave it out completely from the glaze, just to take the edge off."
"0","1","I have been making this recipe for years.. It is a great recipe..I make it every year at Christmas."
"0","5","Amazing! A perfect cookie in every way!"
"0","3","These weren't as good as I had expected. I added minced pecans to the dough and 1/2 tsp vanilla. OMG.....so much better! Everyone loves these and keeps requesting them. With a couple tweaks they are an easy 5 stars"
"0","5","Amazing cookie! My husband's new favorite cookie! He even says its slightly better than his grandma's christmas fig cookies (Gasp!) For best results, after you put the cookies onto the pans and add in the jam, pop them in the fridge until they are cold. After you chill them, you can then put them in the oven. This will keep them from going flat while baking."
"0","5","Awesome cookies!"
"0","5","Very delicious!"
"0","3","Although I liked this cookie quite a bit, I might have added a little too extract. Also, I found the dough a little tough to work with. It baked up quick which was nice. Although the taste was good, I would love if I could find a lighter version of this. Its a good way to use up jam, but consciously its too rich for me. I made the recipe as is, except that I used homemade blackberry jam, which did taste good."
"0","5","So easy, so yummy. I made mine without the glaze on top, and they were still amazing!"
"0","5","I made these cookies for Christmas and I thought they were delicious.I loved the flavor of the almond extract with the rasberry jam.They were not only easy but fun to make as well.Definately a keeper!"
"0","5","Excellent, but only made about 16 cookies and I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","awesome!!! i loved these cookies"
"0","4","These were pretty good. I wasn't OMG but thought they were tasty. I did something a little different. Instead of putting the jam in the center, I avoided the thumb print and just left them as a round cookie then dipped them halfway in some bittersweet chocolate and stuck them into the fridge to cool. Pretty good!"
"0","5","I haven't baked in over 20 years and found this recipe because my department was having a cookie bake-off and I had to bring something in. I did use one of the variations that a reviewer submitted - thank you. My goodness, these cookies are so delicious!!! They came out very buttery and just melted in your mouth. Everyone raved about how good they were and couldn't believe that this was my first time baking them. Everyone couldn't get enough cookies to eat, even my husband complained that I didn't leave enough for him. ."
"0","5","These are amazing little cookies! The almond and raspberry flavors are awesome together. I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 tsp. salt. I did soften the butter before mixing, but I then chilled the dough before baking. I found the handle end of my pestle worked great for making the thumbprint. I piped the jam from a baggie into the thumbprints. For Valentine's day I made some heart-shaped by hand - just make sure you chill the dough so they won't spread out."
"0","5","So Yummy!! I used strawberry. They turned out great!!"
"0","4","Best thumbprint ever!"
"0","5","Sooooooo Tasty! I've been lookling for a great short bread cookie recipe. This is the one! I didn't put the iceing over the top because i'm not a huge fan of iceing! I'm just in love short bread! Thank You for sharing!"
"0","5","These quickly became my family's favorite cookies- awesome recipe!"
"0","5","yumm-o"
"0","5","these cookies are my favorite and even though my familly doesnt like them as much, they certainly love them without the jelly which tastes good both ways!!"
"0","5","First time making a cookie like this and it was favored above all our old family Christmas favorites! Pretty and a welcome relief from all the heavy chocolate this time of year."
"0","5","I decided to make this recipe for my coworkers over Christmas break. Had I known that they would have been so good I would have doubled the recipe!! I found that the recipe made about 24 cookies instead of the 36. The only changes I made were with the icing. I had to add more milk than what the recipe called for. Overall, I loved these cookies! Definitely 5 stars! I'd have put 10 stars if available!"
"0","5","My Mom and I made these cookies every year for Christmas when I was growing up. She called them 'poundcake cookies' and I long ago lost the recipe so I was glad to find this again. They are among my and my friends' favorite cookies each year. Another version Mom made was to top each one with a pecan rather than the jam. Excellent cookie!"
"0","5","One of the best tasting cookies I have ever made! Keep the dough cold and this recipe turns out perfect!"
"0","5","THE BEST!"
"0","5","Fantiastic shortbread cookies. I didn't add the almond extract and they still worked perfectly. No unruly jelly or anything. I will absolutely make these cookies again and again."
"0","5","I made these for the past two Christmases and everyone loves them. These will stay on my list of cookies to bake every year. Pretty and delicious!"
"0","5","My family likes traditional Italian Christmas cookies, and I like to try new things. 10 days before Christmas I made one batch of these and set them out on the counter to see what the general reaction would be, and by the time Christmas came and went, I had to make 3 more batches! This has now joined our list of cookies each year. Thanks so much!! : )"
"0","5","Wonderfully easy recipe. Shortbread light and airy. Watch for the first sign of brown rim and take out of the oven to cool on rack. Can see how some would like with and without icing - make it both ways...but the iced version is very decadent and regal looking. I loaded in the jam...can fill without bubbling over. The almond extract made the recipe. Will be my special festivity cookie recipe."
"0","5","Delicious! One note (don't overly soften the butter or the cookies won't turn out)"
"0","5","Yum! I'm going to give this 5 stars (although i made it with vanilla extract and no icing). These were really good- i'm going to use almond next time though."
"0","5","Loved by everyone! Great with seedless raspberry jam."
"0","5","absolutely delicious! i used real butter and so it's a given that the cookies will spread more than if i used marg. worth the taste though. stuck in the freezer for 10min pre-bake and they turned out quite nice... not a single one leaked jam."
"0","3","These shortbread cookies turn out very crumbly, but they do taste delicious. They were a lot of work to get right, definitely follow the advice of other reviewers and make the holes carefully, making sure they are deeper than they are wide, so the jam does not run off of the top and make a mess. They turned out ok but I think I'll try a different shortbread recipe next time."
"0","5","Delicious!!! I used boysenberry jam and kept everything the same...best i've ever had, my grandma used to make them but the jam would be chewy and the cookie hard (must have been overcooked) the jam stayed soft and so did the cookie."
"0","5","Soooo delicious! Used the exact recipe and the chap stick top idea for making the hole....just the right size. I also baked them for 7 minutes (with the hole already pushed in without the jam), and then took them out of the oven, filled them with the jam using the zip bag cut with a small hole in the tip, and baked them for 7-8 more minutes. These will be a holiday favorite from this moment on!"
"0","5","Used apricot preserves in half and raspberry in the other. DELISH!!!! ***Update*** I used lemon extract instead of almond this time... WAHOO was it ever good!!"
"0","5","This was Perfect!!! I Didnt have Almond extract so i used Vanilla. Just as my Mother made them long time ago."
"0","5","These are simply delicious! They don't even need the drizzle on them. The shortbread is buttery and light and they were simple to make. I did pop them in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes before rolling into balls and also used the chapstick trick other users have suggested. I piped the jelly into the centers using a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off. I will make these again!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe just as it is!"
"0","4","Great taste. And yes, they do spread. Need to be refrigerated for a bit. But not too long because it gets pretty stiff. The chapstick hint really helped! :) Thank you!"
"0","5","My boyfriend said this was the best cookie I've ever made, will definately make this again."
"0","5","Awesome! Didn't even bother with the glaze, they are good enough without it. Used black cherry preserves. Delicious!"
"0","5","Have followed the recipe exactly many times and they always turn out delicious. I find the dough seems dry at first but as you work it into balls it comes together. My favorite jam to use (instead of raspberry) is red plumb. Peach is great too. This year I took other reviewers' suggestions to use a chapstick lid to make the indentation for jam, and to put the jam into a baggie then squeeze out from a cut corner. Both made the job much easier. When it's time to glaze them I always need more than the suggested amount of milk. I put the glaze in a baggie and cut a corner in that as well - makes glazing them all easy. I never have to freeze them prior to baking. It's easy to make these too big - I always have to make sure I'm making them small enough (1 in). My favorite cookies!"
"0","5","This is the second time I have made these cookies. They turn out great I have even tried the shortbread dough with other jams. Taste great with all I have tried so far!"
"0","5","Added these to a cookie exchange last year and they were specially requested again this year. Note: Do make the prints as you roll; otherwise I found they crack/crumble more easily. Delicious & travel will w/out the glaze too. Yum!"
"0","4","Very good cookie! I didn't glaze them...seemed over the top. They are great without the glaze. I added about 1/4 cup extra sugar and 1/2 tsp. baking soda. Turned out very yummy. Will deffinately make them again."
"0","5","This is the BEST cookie recipe! I make it every year and get RAVE reviews! I make MANY MANY batches each year."
"0","5","Very nice! I think I made mine too big because it only made 21 cookies. I also had to add more milk to the glaze to get it thin enough to drizzle. They were a huge hit!"
"0","5","wow! Thank you these were wonderful , I cant have gluten so I made them with bobs red mill gluten free baking flour and they came out perfect !"
"0","5","YUMMY!!!!! My whole family just loved these cookies. I love to cook and have been for many years but baking is a new thing for me. I took advise from others and cooked at 340 and froze for 10 min. before baking. I also added 1/4 cup more flour. I used lemon curd for half of them and raspberry for the other. They both turned out great! I will for sure be making many more of these. In fact I will be making lots more this week to give as gifts. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","Cookie is very buttery. My batch yielded 26 cookies. I used a sugarless jam (with Splenda) on my first cookie sheet, then I used a homemade jam on my 2nd sheet and a regular store bought jam on my final sheet. The sugarless jam held together well, however the homemade & store bought jams drastically spread out. However they are a tasty cookie."
"0","5","wow! Made these today, and liked them so much I ran back to the store to get more butter to make another batch. So easy, and so good!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious cookies!!! My whole family loved them and now I'm baking another batch!"
"0","5","My sister-in-law made these last year and I really loved them so I decided to make them this year. My husband and his co-workers loved them! I used melted white chocolate chips instead of the glaze b/c that's how my sister-in-law made them last year and I love the combination of white chocolate and raspberry."
"0","5","This is absolutely the best recipe ever. I make them every year and my family and friends just love them. I do different toppings too."
"0","5","I didn't have any problems with these cookies. Actually, they were quite easy to make. Mine are not as pretty as the picture, but taste great. They definitely will make a good cookie for gifting."
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic. I followed other reviews with one batch of cookies. After I put the jam in the center I placed them in the fridge for about 15 minutes. They were full and perfect."
"0","2","not impressed. overall not a very good cookie."
"0","5","This cookie is great tasting, easy to make, and beautiful. Great for giveaways at Christmas. I have made this cookie from this recipe for years and my family always requests them."
"0","3","These cookies are very tasty, but mine didn't come out like the picture. The jelly bled into the dough and the cookes looked like blood shot eyes. So other than the appearance- and was going to give them as gifts, they had to use for the family- they didn't mind thou."
"0","5","Made these for a cookie exchange and loved the ease of these and took advice by keeping the butter chilled and not softened which in turn helped the jam stay in the indent. My husband who rarely eats sweets now could not keep out of these. Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
"0","5","These were so good! Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly."
"0","5","Many reviewers have commented on how to make perfect holes for the jam. I use the end of a wooden spoon and it makes a nice well, smaller that the picture, but holds the jam nicely"
"0","5","Good, easy recipe. Works best if you use your hands to knead all the dough before forming balls. I tried it before and after kneading, and the first ones flattened out."
"0","5","These weere GREAT, followed recipe exactly!"
"0","5","these are awesome! I ended up having to use a small amount of milk and a little extra butter, my dough was very crumbly!I did chill the dough or a few minutes, and actually shaped the balls into little 'bowls'! First time I have ever made a cookie such as this and will be making these often! Super easy and super tasty!"
"0","5","These were fantastic! Easy and delicious! I used raseberry on some and apricot on others, both were great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Love these, I've wanted to find a shortbread/jam recipe for a few years and finally gave it a shot. I used a cherry/strawberry/raspberry blend for the jam filling and it was delish!"
"0","5","Oh these are soo good. The only change I made was by using cherry preserves instead of raspberry. Half were eaten about 2 mins out of the oven! A very good recipe! Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","O' yum!!!! Ive never been a big cookie eater but we made raspberry preserves and I was looking for something to make with it and this looked easy enough. It was very easy and so Delicious. There is eleven people in my family and its a miracle when we all like something but these cookies are it. We made them twice in the first week and will add them to our favorites. We did do something different we drizzled white chocolate over them and loved it!!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome...followed the recipe as written - get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe every time I make them. Makes an impressive presentation!"
"0","4","These are delicious. The batter was a bit dry and could use more butter (1/4C) but turned out well. and tasted great.The only change I made was add drizzled white chocolate instead of the icing... will make again for sure"
"0","4","LOVED these cookies! They taste almost exactly like the Pepperidge Farm Verano cookies - except not as chewy. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly - but I used a leveled TBSP to size the balls of dough and used a 1/4 tsp. to fill the center of the cookies with preserves. If you're thinking about leaving off the drizzle - don't! It's delicious!"
"0","5","Soooo good! What a great combo of flavors. I can't say that I can taste the almond too much, so I'll add more next time. I used strawberry jam and it was so yummy!!!"
"0","5","Really yummy. I did not frost them"
"0","5","This is one of my absolute most favorite recipes ever! They taste so divine for such a simple recipe. Everyone who tries them loves them too, and they've become my 'signature cookie'. ;) Thanks!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe. Perfect for a holiday cookie exchange."
"0","5","Love these! Always on my Christmas cookie tray."
"0","5","I made these for our church fellowship one day and they were a HUGE hit!!! So easy to make too! Thank you! :)"
"0","5","The BEST cookies ever!!!"
"0","5","Really enjoyed the almond extract. The dough was a little too moist to work with so I chilled it for 30 minutes. I put the jam in ziploc bag and snipped the corner, which worked out great. I baked it at 350 for 14 mins. Really, you don't need the icing because it is delicious just as it is."
"0","4","I gave this 4 stars only because it takes more effort than a drop cookie, but other than that, it was fun to make and delicious! My hint: I rolled them in a barrel shape, used the end of a Sharpie to make the hole, and then I put the jam in a plastic sandwich bag with a tiny tip cut off to fill them neatly. I also stuck them in the refrigerator as other reviewers have said to do, so they don't get flattened out too much. Excellent!"
"0","5","Simply divine. These were melt in your mouth delicious!"
"0","5","These were great!"
"0","4","This cookies weren't too difficult to make. Some turned out picture perfect, others cracked a little and the jam melted out. I wasn't a personal fan of the almond extract but they did go quickly with the rest of my family and guests."
"0","5","SO YUMMY! I just used margarine as I wasn't looking for a true shortbread at the time, but I whipped it for awhile and it was so melt in your mouth delicious."
"0","5","scrumptious - even without the glaze."
"0","3","these spread like crazy for me and i am an experienced baker. the taste and texture was good but the spreading really messed up my plan."
"0","5","LOVE THESE! I have been making these for a few years now and they are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious! They are great with other flavors of jam as well. Thanks for posting. :)"
"0","4","They tasted good once they turned out like the picture. :) A lot of them turned out flat and I ended up having to toss them. I think it is how the butter and almond extract is mixed. I'll have to try again to get them all to turn out pretty and delicious."
"0","5","These are delicious and turned out beautifully! Thank you for sharing!"
"0","4","I made these last night and we could not stay out of them! I followed the recipe exactly but I did bake @ 340. They stayed just perfect, did not go flat and my jam did not run on a single cookie. I may add more almond extract next time--I love that flavor!"
"0","5","Yummy! So lite,pretty and easy. Thank you."
"0","5","Great recipe, made them a couple of times with simply wonderful results. I would recommend making the cookies a bit smaller than the recipe suggests but other than that it's perfect! Thank You."
"0","5","I have made these multiple times and they are simple and delicious. I do sometimes use lemon curd for my filling in part of the batch, although my favorite is the raspberry. These are always a hit."
"0","5","These are the easiest cookies to whip up. Every event I have people RSVP requesting I make these. Try different preserves and jams- cherry is great but stay away from citrus jams they don't mesh well"
"0","5","I love these cookies! They take no time at all to whip up and completely satisfied my pregnancy cravings!! I have made these at least 10 times already, and as others have reviewed...less is more with the jelly!"
"0","5","excellent! for more of a 'shortbread' style of cookie, after i make my dough i normally cover it and stick it in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. it makes them so delicious and they end up tasting just like professionally made ones!"
"0","5","I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I added a bit more flour, about 1/4 cup and also didn't warm my butter up all the way, and instead of almond I used Hazelnut and instead of raspberry I used blackcurrent jam. They turned out amazing! They remind me of German cookies I had last time I was there."
"0","5","I leave out the drizzle, but these are great."
"0","4","Made these exactly as written and they turned out great. I did take Sarah's suggestion and when the cookies were ready to bake I put them in the fridge for about 15 mins.."
"0","5","These are really yummy! I actually used the dough (minus the almond flavoring, jam, and glaze) to make strawberry shortcake!! Delicious! Just roll the cookies out into 15 balls, put on cookie sheet, and flatten. bake as directed. Let cool and top with strawberries and whipped cream, add another cookie and repeat strawberries and whipped cream! It's excellent!"
"0","4","Delicious! I used homemade strawberry and blueberry jam and they turned out amazing! I wasn't careful enough to put them away when my hubby's friends came over, and came back to find the entire plate polished off! Will have to be more careful next time..."
"0","5","I just wanted to add myself to the hundreds who think this recipe is AWESOME!!! They should rename it the 'Oh My Gosh' cookies because everytime someone takes a bite they get that wide-eyed, open-mouthed double-chined look on their face, and 9 out of 10 times they utter 'Oh...My.....Gosh!'"
"0","5","My fiance says these are the best shortbread thumbprint cookies he's ever tasted! They are the best I've tasted too! I cooked them at their minimum time and they're a bit chewy in the middle, which I like. They have such a great almond buttery taste to them."
"0","5","I love shortbread and thumbprint cookies so when I found this recipe, I was so excited to try them. Needless to say, I LOVE these cookies and will be making them again and again. I usually never alter recipes but I'm not a huge fan of almond extract so I change it to 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I also used lemon curd and topped some with just powdered sugar and some with the glaze.YUMMY!"
"0","5","Yummy I added Raspberry Preserves for mothers day it was awesome!!"
"0","5","I've had trouble with shortbread before, but these turn out perfectly! I used vanilla instead of almond, added a little extra flour and then put the assembled cookies in the freezer for about 15 min before baking. I didn't bother with the icing and I cant imagine I was missing much, they were perfect! Also, while they were great straight out of the oven, they were even better about an hour later. The outsides were delicate and buttery while the middle was perfectly gooey with jam. I will definitely be making these again."
"0","5","This cookie recipe saves me lots of headaches. . . easy and fast to make and all my friends love them."
"0","5","Delicious! I used strawberry jam and ran out of almond flavoring so I used vanilla."
"0","5","These went together well, although they did spread a bit. (I will put dough in freezer or fridge as suggested for a while next time.) I'm always looking for simple recipes my toddler can help me make, and this certainly fit the bill, especially since there is no egg to worry about."
"0","5","Amazing! I put them in the freezer for a little bit before the oven. They were great. Seriously great."
"0","5","I am allergic to nuts so I used vanilla extract instead of almond. It only made about 2 dozen cookies for me, but these were probably the best cookies I have ever made!!! Absolutely delicious. Everyone gobbled them up."
"0","5","Fantastic recipe,the whole family loved them. I used plum jam instead of raspberry and it was DELICIOUS"
"0","5","these were excellent! i followed reviewer MarcieJ's advice on keeping the cookies firmer and making them look like they do in the photo, and they come out wonderful. i only had one stick of butter left and had to mix it with a stick of margarine, but they still came out fine. i also used lemon juice in place of the almond extract, and strawberry jam instead of raspberry. if i made these again i would like to see how they are with all the original ingredients, but even how i made it they came out excellent."
"0","5","My favorite non chocolate cookie. And it always disappears before i get even a few of my own!"
"0","3","These cookies spread out way too much for me. The cookies got flat and the jelly ran out onto the cookie sheet and made a mess. They looked terrible but they tasted pretty good anyway. I'm not sure I would make them again."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! I made this exactly as the recipe says, and they turned out great! They tasted, looked, and smelled amazing! Thanks for this addition to my cookie collection!"
"0","5","Made these for a present but we ate them all before I could wrap them up so I had to make them again! Super easy and delicious!"
"0","5","these are now the family fav especially with my 2 year old who love to make them with me"
"0","5","I recommend adding a little less almond extract to the dough - maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp. instead of 3/4 tsp. And I only had to bake 10-12 minutes before these were done. Otherwise, perfect recipe!"
"0","5","Amazing!!!"
"0","3","I tried making these for a cookie exchange and I must not have had the proper thumb- but most of the cookies the jam ran out or the cookie absorbed it. didn't look like the pictures. I didn't serve them. But I did snack on them."
"0","5","I followed MarciJ's recommendations but my dough wouldn't come together. I ended up adding 3T of milk and then it did. Otherwise the revisions worked perfectly. Of note, I used a cookie scoop and only got 18 cookies. These were delectable and we'll definitely make them again."
"0","5","So delicious!! They turned out perfect!"
"0","4","Overall, I loved these cookies. Great taste. I used vanilla in place of the almond extract because I never have that stuff. I used margarine and still think they taste fabulous. The only complaint I do have is that when I went to make the 'thumbprint' the cookie dough crumbled and cracked and I was just so frustrated."
"0","5","I made these with some homemade chocolate raspberry jam a friend of mine makes - they're fabulous!"
"0","4","I think my jam to cookie ratio was off. I would make them smaller next time because they do spread out and then there's not enough jam. Other than that they tasted about a 4. It's not like a cookie is ever unedible though!"
"0","5","Just like cookies from the bakery!"
"0","4","Well...not really what I was looking for. I wanted more of a 'shortbread' taste. These were to 'cookie' tasting. I didn't use any jam I used chocolate frosting. I made these to big, they should be more like 1/2' - 1' size balls. I used vanilla instead of almond. My boys did like them. But I was looking for more of a 'fudge susan' type cookie."
"0","5","Wowie, these things are tasty and pretty! My husband, not a cookie freak like me, can't even resist them. I had no problems and followed others suggestions in chilling them before baking. The jelly didn't ooze...the glaze was easy! Life is good when you can get this excited over a cookie! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","4","I noticed the cookies I rolled, quickly, came out much less flat that the ones my four-year-old rolled. The butter melts quick and makes the cookies flat. The taste was still great!"
"0","5","Awesome...my highest rated cookie from all my cookie gifts!"
"0","5","Easy, tastes great and looks amazing when done. I usually make them with raspberry jam and have discovered it tastes the best!"
"0","5","I followed other reader recommendation to put the cookie tray in the fridge before baking -- except, I put only the cookies with NO JAM in the fridge. by doing this, it was so much easier to put the jam filling in and the cookies came out nice and yummy"
"0","5","i love this recipe..... i just made some and some how they are gone already ...haha the only thing i did differently was omit the sauce you pour on top, one day i used smackers raspberry jelly and ohhhh ... yummy .. never use anything else with it again. thank you so much !"
"0","5","These are sooo good. I made several batches at Christmas time with all different kinds of jam."
"0","5","These cookies are fantastic! My husband could not stop eating them!"
"0","5","These are amazing almost everytime i make them! There has been one or two times when the texture doesn't turn out quite right but when it does, these cookies are gone faster than they are made!"
"0","5","Awesome! Easy to make and a great light taste! Thanks!"
"0","4","These cookies received a thumbs-up from my husband! I didn't realize I was out of almond extract until after I started making them, so I substituted vanilla. I didn't have problems with flat cookies--although I did use cold butter and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. I think they would taste even better with almond extract so I plan to try these again."
"0","5","Made these for Christmas and they were fantastic! They will definitely be on my Christmas cookie list from now on."
"0","5","I saw this exact recipe in a holiday cookie magazine two Christmases ago and made them. They're fantastic!"
"0","5","These cookies were a big hit with my friends and family for the holidays! I used seedless blackberry jam for the filling. Everyone really loved them."
"0","5","My family loved it! I will be making this over and over again! Thank you so much! Only thing different is I used strawberry jam and I melted it first for better consistency and then I used water instead of milk for the 'frosting'."
"0","5","Made these for Christmas. Yummy the best cookie I ever had not too sweet just right very buttery. The whole family loved these. I'm going to try again with diff. flavors of jam."
"0","5","Followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup extra flour. These didn't look cooked when I first took them out but then they hardened up a little once they cooled. Used strawberry jam and turned out great!"
"0","5","seriously good, can use apricot as well (I use fruit only jam)"
"0","5","AMAZING cookies!! I didn't make the drizzle (I had to make 16 dozen) & they were awesome. Got nothing but rave reviews from the cookie exchange I went to. Will def keep this one! I followed the few other reviews by adding the extra flour & they were buttery & perfect! :)"
"0","3","I followed the recipe exactly. I had to cut back on the baking time though. My first batch looked nice, but were too crumbly and fell apart when bitten into. Removing them from the oven a couple of minutes early produced tender, gorgeous shortbread cookies. I made these for a Christmas gathering and received only a couple of compliments. My immediate family were not impressed."
"0","5","I did not have a problem with my cookies turning out flat. I followed the recipe to the letter. I used the chapstick lid that another reviewer suggested to make the indentations in the cookies. I found it helpful to put a dab of butter on the lid first. Then, I stuck the lid into the middle of the cookies and began moving it around in a small circular motion with the circles getting a wee bit wider to get the indentation to become bigger and deeper. Worked like a charm! Filled it with jam. Do not fill it to the brim or it will overflow, but don't be stingy about the jam either. The raspberry jam tastes much better than the strawberry one. I also used jam with seeds, and it was still good, but some people don't like seeds. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of the cookies after they come it. It's much easier with a pastry brush."
"0","5","AWESOME cookies!! I have trouble baking cookies but these turned out perfect and such a great taste and texture. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with the sweet jam gooey perfect. I sprinkled powerdered sugar over them b/c I didn't want to make the glaze and the sugar melted into the cookies so I don't recommend that.. but they are just find w/o any glaze or extras.... yuummy! My best Christmas cookies this year."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful!!! Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","I used less butter than the recipe calls for and it was plenty enough. Great recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is great just as it is! I almost always turn my oven down about 10 degrees so the cookies don't burn."
"0","5","I was going to give these a lower score because they were hard to shape as I made them, but after I tasted them, it made it all worthwhile. Very, very good!"
"0","5","Wow! This is an amazing recipe. The Almond Extract really stands out - do not use Vanilla. I took the advise of previous reviewers and chilled the dough in the fridge, used the end of a Chapstick for the hole, and filled a ziplock for piping the jelly in (would have worked better if not for the chunks in my preserves!). I thought the glaze was too thick so I thinned it out(too much!). All in all, an excellent recipe that I will be making again. Thanks!"
"0","4","This recipe was tasty. I used homemade peach jam for the filling...really nice. Thank you!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and and made them slightly larger which made about 2 1/2 dozen. I absent-mindedly dumped the flour and sugar in a bowl, forgetting to cream the sugar and butter first. I ended up mixing it with my hands and just rolling it into balls, (did not chill) and used my thumb for the hole. They turned out great!"
"0","5","I've made about 40 dozen of these cookies as party favors and gifts in the past 4 months. They are a huge hit and I'm getting special requests to make more. I make the cookies a bit smaller and do not use raspberry filling but instead fill after they've cooled completely with colored icing. For this icing, I use 2 c confectioners sugar, 3/4 tsp almond, and milk to just runny consistency. The icing will set overnight. I recommend using salted butter."
"0","5","One word: EXCELENT...don't need glaze."
"0","5","These cookies are AWESOME!! My husband loved them! I followed the recipe except I added vanilla extract instead of almond. The dough was great to work with. I will be making these again :) Thanks"
"0","5","All I have to say is 'mmmmm'!! I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!"
"0","4","Excellent cookie--just make sure your use a nice jelly and not a preserve; preserves have too much liquid and make the cookie soft."
"0","5","These are wonderfully light and melt-in-your-mouth yummy!!! I made two batches of these today, using homemade raspberry freezer jam and marachino cherries in the thumb print. Thank you for this recipe. The taste is buttery and so good! Very easy to make. I didn't change the recipe at all, well... except for the cherries. These may work with kisses or rolos in the center too. I'll have to try that. Again, wonderful shortbread cookie recipe. We will enjoy it for years to come"
"0","5","These were simple and delicious. I too, added 1/4c more flour and used the top of a chapstick to make the holes. I baked at 335 for 16 min each. They may not last until my holiday visitors come this week."
"0","4","These taste really good, but not easy like others are saying... When you have to change the instructions to get a cookie to turn out right, it shouldn't get 5 stars... As written, these cookies are difficult to work with as far as getting the jelly indents in them without the cookie falling apart. Had to shape them, fill them, reshape them, then bake them... time was spot on, though. These do taste really really good, but I doubt I make them again. Even after following the recipe, then following advice to chill the dough... at least 3 per sheet spread to the point that they were ugly (but tasty) and since I give cookies as gifts, these have to be considered a failure. As the shortbread itself is wonderful and melt in your mouth, might try to make the dough and do something with it besides thumbprints."
"0","5","I have to say these were the easiest cookies I've ever made, I didn't change a thing. I made them for a cookie exchange, but took some extras to work today and people loved them!"
"0","5","These cookies are crazy good! My first time making them and I did learn after the first batch to use a tablespoon to measure out the dough on the cookie sheet and I used the bottle of almond extract turned upside down (with lid on) to stamp out a perfect hole to fill in the raspberry jam. Filled the frosting in a plastic baggie and they looked amazing and tasted so good. Just takes time to prep them before putting in the oven, but dont rush. If the dough breaks while stamping with the bottle, use your fingers to carefully reshape dough around the lid. These are keepers!"
"0","5","These cookies are incredibly easy to make with few ingredients. I had to make cookies for my work's potluck and I chose these based on difficulty. Not only that, but the almond extract glaze that you drizzle over the top takes these cookies to another level. They are incredible! I had to slap my mother's hand away from them a couple of times so I would have enough for work. The chapstick lid idea worked like a charm (thanks other reviewers!), make sure if the chapstick gets stuck in the little dough ball you rub the lid with a little flour to get them out easily. I used a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to scoop in the raspberry jam so none would run out during baking. Delicious! Thank you for this recipe!"
"0","5","I love these cookies. They are dangerous to have in the house because they are addictive! I make them every year and give them out for Christmas. They are a hit."
"0","5","My kids love Knotts Berry Farm strawberry shortbread cookies, so I've been searching for a similar recipe. This is the closest I've found so far. I didn't use the icing, and I used Solo filling instead of jam. I also found the cookies flattened a little more than I would have liked, so next time I will chill the dough first. We're having our Christmas open house this Sunday, and these cookies will be on my table. Well, if I don't eat them all first, they'll be on my table!"
"0","5","Yes, 'the best!' Everyone loves these and wants the recipe."
"0","5","Another year and I am still using this recipe. I noticed that I saved this recipe in 2003! It has been a family favorite ever since. These are to die for and are SO EASY to make! Don't be fooled! Family members are often 'wowed' by my baking skills when they see these, but in reality these are simple to pull together. Often I will cut out the second step of glazing for ease and the cookies are still great. Also, try substituting the raspberry for another jam, jelly or preserves. My family really likes the cookies with blackberry preserves as well as the raspberry. Around my home, these cookies are regularly baked and have become the new 'chocolate chip' cookie!"
"0","5","A bit flat as some other reviewers said, but nothing that can't be remedied. They were absolutely delicious. The batch was not big enough! I might try a few other types of jam next time."
"0","5","Wow, these are fantastic. I did find that I needed to add a bit more flour because my first batch was flat. This is definately in my rotation of Christmas cookies now."
"0","5","I made this recipe just as written and it couldn't have turned out more perfectly. Absolutely the best cookie I've had! Very easy to make, pretty and very perfect for the holidays. Great job and great recipe!"
"0","3","These cookies are good but like other posters said, the ingredients have to be adjusted for the glaze. Plus, mine were sort of flat but I attribute that to the dough not being cold enough when I cooked them. I thought 3/4 tsp was too much almond extract. I also had to use about a tsp or two more milk. Good cookies. Had to adjust things a little though."
"0","5","Very good. Don't overfill the rasberry. It will leak out and burn on the pan."
"0","5","This recipe is so simple and so good. I baked about 5 types of cookies, breads and other goodies to give away for Christmas and these thumbprints are the best ones I've made! They're so easy, look so pretty and taste so good."
"0","5","This turned out absolutely perfect ... I just followed the directions and the rest took care of itself!"
"0","5","Soooo good...I made this recipe exactly as written, and they came out golden and buttery! Will DEFINITELY make again!"
"0","5","I made this cookie last night and they are fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of almond extract but followed the directions and the almond is very faint and adds a nice mellow flavor. The only 2 changes I made was to swap out pomegranate, grape and apricot jams for the raspberry since I wanted a variety of flavors. And I also skipped the almond extract in the frosting, just made a plain powd. sugar frosting. This is going in my recipe box for a quick, easy cookie recipe!"
"0","5","exellent! Used strawberry jam also"
"0","5","Delicious. very buttery. Although I followed the suggestions of MarcieJ (using chilled butter) I wouldn't do it again. The cookies were too crumbly and were difficult to form into a ball. As a result they cooked really flat and broke really easily. Great taste though."
"0","5","I started making these cookies for Christmas last year and my family and friends absolutely love them!   Now i'm obligated to make them for my husband's colleagues as well. People can't get enough of them."
"0","2","This recipe calls for too much almond extract and the dough does not hold up well at all (and I chilled for hours!)."
"0","5","Tasted Great! However, follow the advice of a previous reviewer. Chill the dough balls with the filling for 1/2 hour in the freezer. This will keep the cookie pretty and together. First time shortbread ever worked for me!"
"0","2","I am not sure what I did wrong, made them exactly as directed and the cookies just all spread out together in the pan. I am sure they would have good flavor, but who can tell when now I have a big mess on my hands."
"0","5","A couple tricks: 1. Roll the dough balls into ground almonds. 2. Use a the back of a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon to create a dent in the cookie for the filling. It seemed to be the perfect size. 3. Microwave your jam for several seconds to make it a little thinner--you can then just drop it into the center of the cookie. These were fantastic. Rolling them in the almonds in addition to the drizzled icing makees them look so pretty--and so much more difficult then they really are!"
"0","4","These cookies were good. I made them for a girl scout cookie swap. I think it is a great basic cookie but does need something else to enhance it. Maybe rolling the cooking in some nuts before baking would be great."
"0","5","I never thought I would be able to make these cookies, but at the end they are a lot easier than I had imagined. The only change I made was to replace the white sugar for Splenda. It used a little more flour I guess, but the end result was fantastic. The raspberry preserves I used were also sugar-free. I made them for my husband at first and he loved them! Today I brought a new batch to the office and the guys absolutely enjoyed them,too. Thank you for a simple, nice recipe."
"0","5","This is very yummy and very easy. I put my jam in a decorating bag, the kind for icing cakes, which made getting just the right amount of jam easy."
"0","5","Great, I had no problems with this recipe. I was a little nervous when I read the reviews, but I decided to stick to original recipe, and it worked out great. My kids love them. So, please try recipe as is. Thanks"
"0","5","Taste great! But mine turned out flat :( I'll follow the suggestion next time to freeze them for 20 min before baking."
"0","4","Make sure not to cook these cookies until lightly brown because that makes them TOO HARD. I think these cookies are supposed to be more white in color from looking at pictures online. They aren't very fluffy, if that's what you were looking for then maybe you should try adding egg to the recipe. but the ingredients were all tastey :)"
"0","3","My husband really liked this recipe, but I won't be making it again. It was like eating a slab of butter. My fault for thinking this would come out differently. I guess that's what shortbread is supposed to taste like."
"0","5","I've baked & eaten many, many cookies in my day & these have to be the absolute best. Hands down. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Perfect recipe."
"0","5","This are very good and easy to make. I decided to use margarine instead of butter to have less spreading. They turned great."
"0","5","Really great!  Don't skip the glaze, it definitely adds a little extra something to the cookie."
"0","5","I couldn't get enough of these cookies! The combination of shortbread, raspberry and almond is just perfect in every single bite! I made these as part of my Christmas baking last year, and I will continue to make them year after year! Not only are they delicious, but they are such a pretty cookie for the holidays!"
"0","5","This recipe was exceptional and easy. I am amazed at the simplicity of ingredients and the flavor. They were so good I had to start giving them away so I would not eat them all. Definitely a keeper."
"0","4","Definitely too much almond extract. Half would be nice. Be sure not to make these too big- or youll get flat, messy cookies! Keep in mind that this recipe makes 36!"
"0","5","Great cookie. I like that it's easy, uses basic ingredients that I always have on hand and looks pretty. It's similar to one I have made for years except the other used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter and also used a maraschino cherry in the center instead of jam. I'll use this recipe from now on."
"0","4","Very tasty, a little too much almond extract for my taste, maybe a little less next time!!"
"0","5","This recipe came from the Taste of Home magazine and has always been a favorite at my Christmas Open House every year. I have a friend who is allergic to nuts, so I replaced the almond extract in the cookies and glaze with vanilla for her sake. My personal preference is almond, but they are just about as good with the vanilla."
"0","5","OH MY! These were unbelievable. I followed some other reviewers tips - oven down 10 degrees, don't bring the butter to room temp, put the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking, adding 1/4 more flour, use a chapstick tube for the holes. I got a little bit ahead of myself - I wanted to taste them!! - and put the glaze on when the cookies were a little too warm. I ended up with a cloudy little pool on top of the jam and kind of a shiny coating on the rest of the cookie. It doesn't matter though - I halved the recipe and made them yesterday and they are already gone!!"
"0","5","These by far are my FAVORITE cookie!!! So yummy, I cannot eat just one!"
"0","5","These cookies are very good, always a hit. I've used various fillings other than raspberry and they are all good. It's easier to apply the icing when the cookies are cold, it turns out prettier, otherwise you just get an icing blob in the middle."
"0","5","These cookies are perfect! Do not change a single thing in the recipe!"
"0","5","These were so very easy to make....the dough came together so easily......As I read some of the viewers comments about the dough being hard to work with I was very puzzled. I think the reason my dough came so easily together was because I used extra fine sugar....that's always a must in shortbread.......I made the cookie balls 1' round and yielded 31 cookies......very good, and a very pretty cookie at that!"
"0","5","Good flavors of almond and raspberry. I used the Smuckers brand seedless raspberry jam. They aren't the prettiest, but they are tasty."
"0","5","Turned out great. I didn't do anything different than what was called for except for when making the drizzle. It was way too thick to 'drizzle' so I had to add 2 more tsps of milk, and I sprinkle some cinnamon in it."
"0","4","This is such a delectable cookie. I refrigerated the dough a little like suggested. I gave it four stars because I thought the dough is a little hard to work with, but the cookie came out amazing. It likes to break apart some what. It's my first go around...will try to master it next time. Great tasting!!!"
"0","4","This cookie was pretty good. I used strawberry and blackberry jam, but it was a little too crunchy for my liking."
"0","5","My family ADORES these cookies! They are so easy to make and take so few ingredients I whip them up for an after-school snack. I have even done an orange extract and marmalade cookie that wasn't terrific but still gobbled up!"
"0","5","These are so delicate and so good. Yum!"
"0","5","So, so, so good. I was forced to make a couple changes, however, based on the ingredients I had on hand: no almond extract, so I used my top notch vanilla extract in both the dough and icing. I also used a four-berry preserve (strawberry, raspberry, blueberry and blackberry) that I had around; very tart and not too sweet, which really complimented the buttery/sweetness of the dough. Even though I stuck the dough in the fridge after mixing AND froze it after rolling and filling, my cookies spread out somewhat, but the jam didn't overflow. Three dozen as advertised and perfectly cooked after fourteen minutes. Delish!"
"0","5","P E R F E C T!!   A nice change from the typical cookie. This one is a keeper for me."
"0","5","Love would not change a thing. I did put them in the freezer for 10 min per another reviewer and they came out perfect! Will make again for sure."
"0","5","Great! Big hit with all the men in my family who aren't crazy about chocolate."
"0","5","I made these a bit differently. I baked the cookies and then half way through I spread blackberry jam and honey on each one. After they finished baking I let them cool for a few minutes and then sandwiched them. After they cooled I then drizzled melted dark chocolate with ameretto overtop of them. Wow! They were heavenly! Next time I'm gonna try the original way but with honey too!"
"0","5","I am so glad to have found this recipe again. These cookies are delicious. Make them exactly as the recipe states and you won't be disappointed. The almond extract is ESSENTIAL in these -- if you leave it out, they won't be the same."
"0","4","These are delicious but it takes a little work to make them 'look good.' I would try them as a home treat before baking them for a party, etc. They are good without the drizzle, too."
"0","5","These cookies were the best! I amde a plate of them for my father in law and he always asks when he will get another ration of them. I ran out of butter and ended up using margarine so they were more dense and chewy than they should have been, but the flavor was absolutely amazing. I used seedless rasberry jam, but I think any flavor preserves or jam would have tasted just as good."
"0","5","I don't care for almond extract, but in the glaze it is delicious! Since Christmas of 2007 I have made over 16 dozen of these cookies. Today I am subsituting the raspberry preserve for huckleberry preserve...I can't wait to try it!"
"0","5","Mmmmm!!! Okay so my hubby LOVES these!! They are his new fave!! He says they remind him of refined fair scone....(okay??!). They were perfect, just two things to note 'not' to do...don't use unsalted butter, you need that salt or else it will just taste bland, also don't think your cute by making little cookies they tend to spread out and get too thin, make them a good healthy looking 1 inch to 1 inch and a 1/2. Good luck!"
"0","5","These were very good. I used 1 stick butter, 1 stick margarine and 1 teaspoon of almond extract in the dough. I shaped into 24 balls and then refrigerated dough for 24 hours. I wish I had put the imprint in before I refrigerated, but I didn't. I used a small water bottle lid I had in the kitchen to make the imprint. Put my raspberry filling (mine happened to have seeds and it was filling not jam)into a ziploc bag snipped the corner and piped into the imprint. Baked and let cool then put the glaze into a ziploc and piped it over the top. They turned out very good, no problems with the cookie spreading too much either. I will try these again maybe with lemon and raspberry....lots of options."
"0","5","These turned out great. I did use strawberry jam instead of raspberry and vanilla instead of almond. I guess mine were Strawberry and Vanilla Shortbread Thumbrints. Oh so good though!!!"
"0","5","Very tasty! I double the almond extract to enhance the almond flavor"
"0","5","After these came out of the oven I wanted to give the recipe a three, some of the jam had spilled out and they didn't look the best. However, after one taste, my family was hooked and we all gave the cookies 5 stars for taste."
"0","5","Mmmm delicious! They did fall flat a little as well (I didn't bother freezing the dough) but the taste is too good for me to care."
"0","5","I love these cookies! They are so easy to make and they look beautiful."
"0","5","I made these cookies to bring in to my sustaibable development class, as an alternative to processed . Everyone in the class loved them and a few people asked for the recipe. I am going to continue to work with this recipe to find out the carbon footprint it leaves behind, for what has been cooked. Thanks for a great, yummy recipe."
"0","5","My family loved these cookies! I made them with different types of jam (blackberry and strawberry) and drizzled melted chocolate over them instead of the glaze. I made one batch for Easter on Friday...and ended up having to do two more because we ended up eating the first one."
"0","5","I have been told that this might possibly be the best cookie recipe ever!!! I always bring them to parties, showers and dinners and they are always a hit!! Thanks for a truly simple and scrumptious recipe."
"0","1","just sweet.. no any other taste at all.. I will delete it my stuff"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe. Very each to make, and I made it for a get-together at my cousin's place. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again!!!"
"0","5","Yummm! These are delicious and easy to make. Exact recipe of the Land O Lakes recipe. I dont always use raspberry jam. I sometimes use apricot, strawberry or whatever jam I happen to have in the cupboard or fridge!"
"0","4","these did not come out exactly how i expected them, too but they were still really good. my friends ate them up pretty fast. i made a few different kinds with all the different jams and stuff i had in my fridge... mango, raspberry, strawberry and apricto! they looked pretty bc of all the diff colors and also it was more fun to eat them w all the diff flavors"
"0","5","I made these with my fifth graders and they were a HIT! They REALLY enjoyed making them. I used pure almond extract because this makes the difference. They could choose between Nutella and Strawberry jam for filling."
"0","2","I followed the recipe using MarcieJ's recommendations (like many others here) but when I mixed the flour into the sugar/butter mixture, the resulting mix was extremely crumbly and difficult to work with. When I went to roll up some of the dough into a ball, it would crumble, making it impossible to put a thumbprint indentation on the dough. I had to wind up sprinkling some water on each ball so that the dough would stick. The end product was good, but it was rather on the buttery side and became very overwhelming after the last few bites. After baking, I had to add more raspberry jam to each cookie to even out the strong butter flavor. I doubt that I will make these again."
"0","5","I did exactly what marcieJ did and they were awesome. Great with my tea!!"
"0","5","AMAZING COOKIES! I say this from being the cook who doesn't really like to eat her profits, but loves to see other people enjoy them. They are very light/chewy, the preserves taste like candy (but not too sweet) and don't skip the glaze that makes them look very professional and adds a different sweet flavor to them. I noticed in the picture that the cookies are very tall, but mine came out flatter (I didn't care too much) . I think this was because I was very careful adding flour. I added just enough to lift the dough off the sides of the bowl and into a clump. Maybe I'll try a bit stiffer dough next time. I also used vanilla extract instead of almond (practically the same thing). A very tasty recipe."
"0","5","These were not only very easy to make but absolutely delightful! I use imitiation almond extract that was a lot cheaper than the real deal. You won't notice the difference after one bite!"
"0","5","These cookies are great and easy to make! The almond and raspberry is a great combo. I don't use the icing over the top. I think they look pretty without it, besides I think it makes them taste a little to strong of almond, since you put almond extract in the icing."
"0","4","My best friend makes a cookie like this and they are the most amazing cookies I have ever had -- I was very excited to find this recipe, but it paled in comparision to hers. The taste isn't quite right, the cookies flatten when they cook (as per other reviews) and the recipe is just off. I would have rated this three stars, but I had them out for company last night and everyone liked them - so they get 4 stars. But I won't be making these again -- I'm on the search for another recipe."
"0","5","awesome recipe, turned out perfectly, tasted wonderful."
"0","3","Spread too much and were greasy... don't know what I did wrong - maybe the dough needed more chilling."
"0","5","I used the suggestion of freezing these before baking them to slow down the baking process and these came out beautifully. The only difference I would make is to use something larger than my thumb for the print because my digits are kind of small."
"0","5","Best tasting cookie ever. This is my new favorite! I love this recipe. The taste is Breath taking!"
"0","5","Sooo yummy! To make these look perfect, dont make them too big. I rolled them into balls, used my index finger to make a deep hole which I filled with seedless preserves, then I refrigerated the entire cookie sheet for about 10 minutes. I baked them for about 7-8 minutes, then transferred them to a wire cookie sheet to cool. I omitted the glaze and decided to sprinkled them with powdered sugar. I get requests for these all the time from my friends who really dont like chocolate cookies."
"0","5","I've made these TONS of times"
"0","4","Very good cookie, and easy to make. I made for a cookie exchange party, they were a hit! I swapped apricot-peach jam because my mom loves this kind. I will make with raspberry next time, I'm sure it will be even better."
"0","5","I wish I could give this 10 stars. Everybody flipped for this cookie!! I baked for 13 minutes and they were perfect. I added more milk to the frosting but that was the only change. Good and EASY to make!! Great recipe."
"0","4","These are really, really yummy... however, I found the raspberry jam to be not quite the right flavor. Try it with red plum jam: much better in my opinion!"
"0","5","Take a little time, but worth it!"
"0","5","This recipe is a keeper! The only thing I had to do different was add a little more milk for the icing. Made 2 batches; 1 w/raspberry and the other w/strawberry for dessert to take to a New Years Eve party. My daughter helped which is also good."
"0","5","Great cookies!!! Very easy to make. Will keep this on my list. Thanks"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious! It is very easy to make. I used a large frosting tip for the dough for a fancy look."
"0","4","These were really good and very easy to make. I made them for a cookie exchange party that I went to and there were none left at the end of the party. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the almond flavor was a little bit much for me. I think I will reduce it by just a little bit next time."
"0","5","I made these cookies exactly as the recipe says, and they were perfect. Everyone raved about them, so I'll be making them often. This is a very quick and easy recipe, too. Delicious!"
"0","5","This cookie is wonderful with black raspberry jam. I have been making for 2 years now and including in my christmas cookie trays it always gets rave reviews."
"0","4","My first time making shortbread cookies and it turned out great. Simple and easy. Like others I substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract instead and for fun, I molded the cookies into hearts with strawberry jam in the center. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","These turned out really yummy!!! I made a batch a few days before Christmas and I only had about 5 to bring with me Christmas day because we ate them all!"
"0","5","This was my first time at making any type of thumbprint cookie and we all truly enjoyed this recipe. I followed exactly as described. I used raspberry filling and it was wonderful."
"0","5","This was my first time making shortbread cookies so I'm not sure if it was just me but the dough seemed a bit too crumbly. I ended up adding a few splashes of milk to form it. Also, perhaps I was making the cookies too big but I only got approx. 24 cookies, and the recipe calls for 36. Nevertheless, these turned out fabulously and I ended up making a whole other batch. Great Christmas cookie!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome!! :-) I made 3 dozon of them, the first dozon I used strawberry jam, the second dozon I used Palmagranite jam, and the third dozon I used raspberry jam. Also added about 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The only ones that didn't turn out as good were the palmagranite ones, but it was the jam's fault (my mother in law didn't use enough pectin when making the jam so it was pretty runny) not the dough's fault. And I didn't use the glaze either, becuase they were sweet enough w/ the jam. They are awesome though!!!"
"0","5","Sooo yummy! I added the extra flour and chilled the cookies prior to baking as others had suggested. I also needed to add more milk to the icing and skipped out adding more almond extract to it as well and it turned out great!! Thanks for this one...perfect and pretty for the holidays!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe! I did add more milk, but would make this recipe again! They tasted SO GOOD!"
"0","5","Buttery and Easy! I did use strawberry preserves and left them unfrosted. I also made a batch with vanilla extract and apple pie preserves! These are soo tasty! Thumbprints will now be on my annual cookie list!"
"0","5","I substituted vanilla for teh almond....very yummy."
"0","4","Overall yummy flavor, but mine flattened out too much (even after chilling). Next time I will follow other reviews and add more flour. Also, I won't add the almond extract to the icing."
"0","5","I make these often with different flavorings and different jams. Wonderful every time! Let them cool before you drizzle a glaze over them if you want it to show up well...but they're really great no matter what!!"
"0","4","VERY GOOD. I HAD TO ADD MORE MILK THAN IT CALLED FOR. OTHER THAN THAT, GREAT RECIPE!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing and very easy to make! The only thing I had a problem with was not enough milk in my glaze."
"0","5","Okay I don't think I could have messed this recipe up any more than I did last night - too much butter, too much flour, you name it I did it wrong (thats what happens when you make 5 different kinds of cookies in one night!) and guess what? They still tasted fantastic! Thats why this gets 5 stars from me. Also I subbed lemon for any of the almond flavors."
"0","5","I have wanted to make these for years but always stuck to what I know is good. What in the world was I waiting for? THESE ARE AMAZING!!! My new Christmas cookie for years to come. I made a batch last night and they were all gone before I got to put the frosting on. I'm making a batch today too. I used raspberry seedless jam and I put it in a pastry bag as mentioned by another member. These are so easy and delicious!"
"0","5","These are fabulous and so simple! I didn't have any butter on hand so I substituted non-hydrogenated margarine, and they still turned out great. I thought the almond flavour might be overpowering, but it was just right! Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
"0","5","The BEST cookie recipe I've ever made. Everyone raves about them!"
"0","4","delicious cookies, but the glaze needs quite a bit more milk to be runny enough. had no problem with the cookies spreading, the consistency was just right. I made them a bit smaller & got 4 doz. Den, Courtenay, B.C."
"0","5","These are super yummy and easy, my picky boyfriend loves em...I have to say though they spread out kinda thin, this could be just me though. Taste great and are pretty."
"0","4","Great cookie recipe but the glaze recipe is NOT."
"0","4","These weren't incredible but were good. I think you need to be really good at making shortbread (which I am not!)to make this cookie sucsessful. My cookies turned out a little bit flat but the jam stayed in place. I will make these again but use the suggestion from a pp of putting the cookies into the freezer before cooking. Also didn't use the icing. No need - the jam makes this sweet enough."
"0","5","HEAVENLY!!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it's just the best cookies ever."
"0","5","I loved these cookies. They were easy to make and didn't require much time to prep. I tried sugar free jam and they tasted just as good. Thanks for the receipe."
"0","5","Okay these have got to the best cookies I have ever eaten! Delish! I make these quite often, even my picky husband who doesn't eat much sweets LOVES these cookies! I have tried them with other jams, and they are all good, but raspberry is the best."
"0","5","These were delicious! I highly recommend these if you want to make a dessert that will impress everyone."
"0","5","I served them to our church group. I love to sit back and watch what everyone fancies. Not only were their comments kind, but their delightful expressions spoke volumes. So many people enjoyed this cookie.....and for good reason, it is absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","Yum! Wouldn't be the same without the almond extract!"
"0","5","I just made these and they are amazing!!! I followed the recipe exactly, just take them out when the bottom just starts to brown (14 minutes). They are delicious!!!"
"0","5","Spft and buttery! I filled about half of the cookies with a jam and made indentations in the rest to fill with a frosting. Very yummy either way. Great recipe and very versatile!"
"0","3","Mixed reviews on these. Mom thought they were to die for, hubby only had one and I couldn't quite decide. May try them again with anise flavoring instead and see how that goes over."
"0","5","WOW these were good. I used the freezer trick suggested by other reviewers, and it worked like a charm. I also didn't frost them. I wish they didn't have so much butter in them so I would not feel so guilty about eating almost the whole batch in two days. I'd better not make them too often... :)"
"0","5","THEY WERE S0 G00D THE BEST THiNG i EVER TASTED!"
"0","5","These cookies are totally delicious! I left out the almost extract and the icing, and I can't imagine how they could have been better! My husband claims they taste just like the raspberry cookies his mother used to make when he was a kid! :-) Will definitely make these again."
"0","5","We love these cookies!! They turned out great!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","So chewy and sweet. I even omitted the glaze and dusted the cookies with powdered sugar. The cookie goes nicely with other preserves as well. Great recipe, thank you! :)"
"0","5","The type of jam you use is crucial, I discovered. I used some Stonewall Kitchen jam and it had too much liquid in it, so it ran. When I used a store brand product it worked great and the cookies held their shape. Regardless, these are a sweet cookie. I did not bother to drizzle them with icing consequently and nobody seemed to notice. They disappeared lickety-split. They were easy to make and tasty."
"0","5","These are the best cookies ever. Everyone loves them including me and they are a 5 star rating and more!"
"0","5","So good! Came out perfectly and I followed the recipe to a T! A keeper, thanks!"
"0","5","The week before Christmas I ended up baking 3 double batches of these... couldn't keep my boys hands off them."
"0","5","These were wonderful! I made it for company and they were gone within an hour!"
"0","5","I'll never eat store bought again! If you only have vanilla extract, they are still good, and if you don't feel like icing them, don't worry about it. Using parchment or wax paper makes this super fast, easy, and quick to clean up."
"0","5","This recipe is a hit with everyone I know. They love them, including me! Easy to make and so tasty. If I don't want to spend the few minutes to actually make the icing, I just cover them with powdered sugar. I hate to say this, but if you are making these cookies and they aren't coming out good, you are doing something wrong. Try it again, this is a wonderful recipe. :)"
"0","5","I make these every year for Christmas and my family loves them. I use strawberry jam because I don't like rasberry that much."
"0","3","I found this recipe to be really time consuming and stressing. My cookies did not spread out too much, but I did have problem with cookies cracking and jam burning on cookie sheets and causing cookies to weld to pan.....I strongly suggest parchment paper. Cookies did taste better 2nd day."
"0","5","These are a lot like my Mother's recipe for Jam Delights which involved cutting pastry & cris-crossing it over the jam, much easier! I used seedless raspberry preserves and some low-sugar strawberry. I wouldn't reccomend low-sugar, it was too runny, but the raspberry was delicious!"
"0","4","These cookies tasted very good, however they did nto retain their shape; they spread out a little, and the jam seeped through onto the cookie sheet, but other than that, they were good"
"0","2","I was disappointed in these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of chilling the dough slightly as per other reviewers' recommendation. They spread out into large cookies, rather than retaining their shape, and in my opinion, were just flavorless and not very good. I also had to cook them a bit longer to get them to 'golden'. I won't make again."
"0","5","This Christmas I filled huge tins full of all kinds of homemade cookies and gave them to everybody who came to visit us. This was everyone's favorite! Thankyou!!!"
"0","4","I made these last night. I could only find Raspberry Jam, not preserves so I used the jam on half of the cookies and Cherry Preserves on the other half. Both were good, but extremely sweet as some others had mentioned. On my second batch I melted white chocolate and drizzled across the tops and they were much better."
"0","5","I love this cookie. I make it for a cookie swap at Christmas every year. It is by far the most requested cookie in the bunch"
"0","5","These are perfect made just as the recipe is written. Always use pure extracts of almond or vanilla and you will be happier with the end result."
"0","5","I followed the recipe - made 6 batches total - they were great!"
"0","4","Taste is good, but cookies are a little harder compared to recipes that incluce 2 egg yolks."
"0","4","easy to make and taste good."
"0","5","a huge hit - beautiful and tasty! very buttery! the hint of almond essence really makes a difference. i, too, found putting the cookies in the freezer helpful in retaining their shape."
"0","5","Probably the best thumbprints I've ever had - certainly the best and easiest I've ever made. I followed others advice and refrigerated 1/2 hour while on cookie pan before baking and let them set for 5 minutes on pan before removing. I also made them a little smaller - maybe one inch in diameter instead of 1 1/2. They did spread a little while baking. I baked all my cookies this year on parchment paper - it makes life so much easier. Definitely a keeper."
"0","5","Yummmm! These tasted fabulous and looked just as pretty! I followed the recipe exactly and would recommend everyone else doing the same. If you don't like almond flavoring, try a different recipe! You're not doing justice to this recipe if you alter it in any way. The almond flavoring gives this cookie a distinct taste that makes it stand apart from most traditional holiday cookies. While I give these a five star rating because I enjoyed them so much, I have to be honest and say I didn't receive many compliments from others about their taste, although everyone did comment on how pretty they looked. Again, I think the almond flavoring is something people either like or don't like... and I definitely like it!!! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","3","Left out the frosting, used vanilla extract (I didn't have almond), raspberry preserves w/seeds(that's all I had) and they were plenty sweet. I put them in the freezer, as suggested by others, but they were still crumbly, so they didn't look very pretty were I put my thumb print. Kind of had to reform them. Tasted good, but alittle more work than initially thought."
"0","5","Yummy and pretty and easy! Wow! I made these for the holidays and they were a hit! Since I did not want to spend the extra money on expensive seedless jam, I used regular raspberry jam and took the seeds out by pushing it through a sive with a spoon. I will be making these every year now."
"0","5","These cookies were terrific. I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry. I made my thumbprints a little too deep on some of the cookies so they cracked after they cooked. They turn out great if you don't press too deep!! This will be a regular Xmas Cookie for me."
"0","5","Served these at a holiday tea and they were a favorite!"
"0","5","I made these cookies for Christmas. They were so goood! I think they are my 'new' favorite holiday cookies. They were easy to make and everyone loved them. Thank you for a great recipe."
"0","5","I took the reviewers' advice and chilled my dough before starting to cook. I also baked the cookies 7 mins before putting the preserves in... then used a squeezie bottle of Welch's Raspberry Preserves for easy and quick filling, then baked them for 7 mins more. Chilling and squeezing the jam in made these cookies look as fab as the pictures, great recipe!"
"0","5","so easy and so good!! will make these again and again. I did make them small and used my pinky finger to form the little well to put the rasp jelly in. They looked nice on the Christmas trays and were delicious!"
"0","3","The flavor in these cookies were way too overpowering. They looked good but I wasn't too thrilled with the texture of them, but on the other hand they are shortbread. The almond and the raspberry are a good combo but I think that the almond is just too much. Maybe cut back a little or use vanilla. I probably will not use again"
"0","5","Unbelievably delicious. Easy, fast and so impressive to look at, too. I used strawberry preserves, and they were excellent. These are a keeper."
"0","5","I read through many of the other reviews, and noted the suggestions, but decided to give it a try as-is. I have to say...I had no problem with the recipe as it's written. I let the butter soften a little, but not too much. I made half the batch with cherry pastry filling, and the other half with raspberry preserves. Both came out great! I used a saran wrap-covered chpstick to make the imprints...& used the 1/4 tsp spoon to fill the cookies. They baked for about 20 mins in my oven. I made the glaze, as directed...& it also came out great! In my opinion, they taste best once cooled. Everyone enjoyed them & I'll definitely make them again. I found them pretty quick to assemble. The dough was easy to handle. I didn't put the dough in the fridge, nor the cookies in the freezer, as some of the others have done. Maybe my kitchen was cooler, so the batter didn't get quite as soft. ? Anyway....tasty cookies...& easy to make! Gonna try other fillings too! Thanks"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. Added extra milk to the drizzle and it was great."
"0","1","Not enough flavor in cookie and it spread out alot making it unpresentable. I made two batches following directions exactly on the first one, I found the dough easy to handle. I did chill the second batch for 30 minutes because the first batch spreaded out so much, but it only slightly helped with the spreading and was still unpresentable and not tasty."
"0","5","very good and buttery. i used vanilla extract instead. they spread out on pan and were a bit larger than i expected. next time i would chill the dough before baking and perhaps make them a little smaller than 1 1/2 inch balls. but excellent cookie! thanks"
"0","3","The family did not like these cookies. The almond flavoring was to overpowering. I tried the cookies with vanilla flavoring and the family still would not eat these cookies. Over all the taste of the cookie was bland. I also did not care for the texture of the cookie. I used homemade blueberry, peach, and pear preserves as these were the only ones available. Will not make these again."
"0","5","I am rating a recipe for the first time but this one definitely needs a five star.I followed Marcee's suggestion about keeping in the frezer for 10 min after filling the jam and I lowered the temp as well.They turned out nice and I didnot use almond extract instead vanilla.I also kept the dough in the refrigerator for about halh an hour. I guess that helped as well. All in All a gr8 recipe...Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","Made these as gifts for Christmas. They really are very good! Tastes even better after you leave them overnight in an airtight container. I refrigerated the dough for a good hr so they cookies came out nice and round just like the picture."
"0","5","YUMMY!!!!No drizzle, cookies turned out awesome, I have to practice to make them look pretty. But everyone loved them!!"
"0","5","This, to me, is the best thumbprint recipe on the site. I've tried several, and was always left with bland, blah cookies. I followed the recipe to the letter, except 1.) I added an egg, and 2.) I chilled the dough before baking because I had run out of kitchen time.  The almond extract is key in this recipe, and brings the otherwise 'meh' shortbread to life.  I will never be a huge fan of plain butter cookies, but these are the best of this site's offerings."
"0","4","Definitely passed the test - my husband ate 5 before I even had a chance to put the 'drizzled' icing - only problem -the icing was a huge clump, so I had to add milk>"
"0","5","Excellent - I used vanilla instread of almond and strawberry and apricot jam instead of raspberry."
"0","5","I used wheat flour for this recipe and it turned out yummy."
"0","5","Delicious and super easy to make. Everyone loved them. I will try them again with different jams. Also, I made a batch where I switched out to vanilla extract and squished a hershey kiss into the cookie immediately after baking. These are great!"
"0","5","these were really good. i didn't have any almond extract so i had to use vanilla. they still turned out great and everyone enjoyed them."
"0","5","Excellent! I did as others suggested and chilled the dough before baking and they didn't spread at all. I used a 1/2 teaspoon to make the indent so that it was even and consistent."
"0","5","You don't even need the glaze. These are out of this world!"
"0","5","I made this recipe for a Christmas bake exchange...Ten dozen is A LOT of cookies! The recipe doubled (and then some) very nicely and it wasn't very difficult at all, but the results were phenomenal!"
"0","5","These were super simple to make, but a little bland for my liking. I will try making them bite-size next time so all the flavors are together. These are a keeper for parties because they are so easy to make and look very presentable. I doubled the icing and added 4tsp of milk and drizzled the icing over the cookies using a ziploc bag. Great for presents :)"
"0","5","I love this recipe, but I use lemon extract instead of almond and always add a little more than the recipe states. And I've never made the frosting/drizzle because they don't seem to need it. Highly recommend!"
"0","5","Absolute heaven! My favorite cookies!"
"0","5","These turned out really well! They spread a little bit more then I expected, but they tasted really good."
"0","5","This is by far the best recipe I've found for shortbread. I had to add an additional tablespoon of milk to the icing to make it more 'drizzleable'. A definite keeper in my recipe box!"
"0","5","These cookies were easy & delicious. The only thing I did differently was add 2 teaspoons milk instead of 1 for the drizzle."
"0","4","Yummo! These cookies are fabulous! I also omitted the glaze and they are still super yummy. Didnt make any changes!"
"0","4","These were great! I found the dough a little crumbly when I made the indentaton. But overall they were great!"
"0","5","These were fabulous! I plan to make these a Christmas tradition!"
"0","5","Mine spread a little too much, but they taste awesome. This is the only cookie my husband requested to make again soon. Thanks for recipe."
"0","5","heavenly, goes great with a cup of tea. and its absolutely fool proof! they're elegant, and you can definetely try different jams and fillings, but i wouldn't recommend anything like chocolate and peanut butter because the shortbread is much too delicate for it, and it takes away the taste of the shortbread. its definetely a 'melt-in-your-mouth' kind of recipe! i'm just a teen, experiencing with baking, and i'm a definete chocolate person not a shortbread person at all, but these are just great! and i managed to make them! they are just so easy! i like them best without the almond drizzle, the simpler the better! everyone should try these!"
"0","5","I made these for my co-workers cookie swap and they were the hit of the office !! Great recipe..  although I must admit that I got tired and used sugar cookie dough for some of the cookies instead of the homemade dough !"
"0","5","Delicious is all i can say about these and super easy to make"
"0","5","WONDERFUL! I saw the rave reviews and decided to try these -- I was not disappointed! These are so easy to make, and come out so pretty and delicious! I used vanilla instead of almond & they still came out great. Also substituted margarine. Used raspberry fruit spread, which was thicker, so it stayed in place v. well. My cookies did not spread much at all, stayed fairly small, so I made the next batch larger. They taste just like the scottish shortbread I love to eat! And what a great way to start our Christmas celebrations!! Thanks, this recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","These cookies were very easy to make and very tasty. I used blackberry jam instead since I didn't have raspberry and they were also good. Will make them again."
"0","5","EXCELLENT cookies. My first time making shortbread and they were a HIT at the office. Thank you. Will be trying them out with strawberry preserves tonight!"
"0","5","These turned out great! I'm not much of a baker but these were so simple and easy. The glaze makes a great presentation and also adds really good flavor."
"0","5","Didn't change a single thing with the recipe. The cookies came out perfect! This is a keeper."
"0","4","Simple and delicious, but not like the shortbread I'm used to having. I think it needed eggs. I'll probably try a different recipe next time."
"0","5","These cookies really are great. I made one batch and it went so quickly that I had to make another. Like a lot of people have said, don't omit the almond extract...it really adds something to the somewhat plain flavor of the shortbread. Also, on my second batch, instead of just using the frosting made of confectioner's sugar and almond extract and milk, I made a chocolate-raspberry frosting by heating them together in a pot with a tiny bit of milk. It made the cookies a lot more like a dessert and a lot more indulgent. Very good after refrigerated."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious. I didn't make the glaze but they really didn't need it. They freeze well, too!"
"0","5","OMIGOD SO GOOD! I try a new christmas recipe every year. This one is a keeper. It replaces all other shortbread recipes I have ever used. I used smuchers triple fruit in the center. I baked them 2 sheet at a time on convetion and they were perfectly doen in 14 minutes. I want to eat them all myself!"
"0","5","These were a big favorite at my annual cookie exchange last Christmas."
"0","5","yum yum...these are my favorite cookies...they are easy to make and taste delicious!! I LOVE them!!"
"0","4","Very good...I made these for my son's kindergarten class and they loved them. The cookies that came out of the oven with lightly browned bottoms tasted much better than the ones with no brown at all. I too added a little more milk to the glaze."
"0","5","this was the perfect cookie for a tea party that I attended. This cookie is very rich and tasty and would go well with either tea or coffee. I have added this recipe to my Christmas cookie collection. Divine!!!"
"0","5","Easy recipe to follow. Quick to make and they taste wonderful."
"0","3","The cookies do look pretty, but they taste ok. These are not the best shortbread cookies I've had, so I'll probably stick to some of my other shortbread recipes."
"0","3","These are ok, not great. The cookie depends too much on it's glaze/topping for the flavor."
"0","5","My sister made these today and they were excellent. I love the almond flavoring and shortbread flavor."
"0","5","easy and so YUMMY. Just what I was looking for!"
"0","5","These cookies are AMAZING! Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. This is definitely my go to cookie recipe from now on! YUM!"
"0","5","I lost my godmother's recipe for her fabulous almond thumbprints. Although hers required a lot more ingredients and time, this has been a great substitute. I can't count how many times I've made these cookies. I'll make a batch or two by request, which happens a lot! I love to bake cookies and this has been a very frequent visitor to the cookie jar."
"0","5","These are lovely - I just made them and they're delicious. I thought they looked just like the picture (maybe even a little nicer!). I was just looking for a quick, eggless dessert recipe for a dinner party tonight and these hit the spot. I did substitute vanilla for almond (we didn't have any) and used my housemate's rasp preserves with seeds with no problems."
"0","5","These cookies are absolutely terrific. They look beautiful and taste fantastic. I took one reviewers hint and heated raspberry up and that made it very easy to fill. They take a little time to form balls but it is definitely worth the effort!"
"0","5","My daughter and I made these cookies, lots of fun to make and delicious."
"0","5","FANTASTIC!! Made them as the recipe states...Wonderful! I got so so so many compliments on them...Perfect Holiday cookie."
"0","3","Didn't much care for it and apparently my guests didn't either. They would try one but went back for more on anything but this. I wouldn't make again. Wish I had my grandmothers thumbprint recipe."
"0","5","Found this recipe about 4 years ago. Easy to make, taste great and look like you spent a lot of time in the kitchen. My sister requests these cookies as her Christmas gift each year."
"0","4","Good cookie. Mine spread an awful lot though. I didn't like they way they looked, too flat."
"0","5","loved it!!! will use every x-mas. thank you so much!!!"
"0","5","mmm. tasty and oh so fatty."
"0","5","These are excellent and smell so yummy while baking. I had trouble with the dought, though. It would not come together so I had to add small amounts of milk at a time just until the dough came together, and they turned out just fine. I used raspberry jam and also made some with strawberry. My daughter loved helping me make the 'thumbprint' (we used the back of a plastic measuring spoon) and sliding the jelly off of the spoon and onto the cookie. This recipe is a keeper!!"
"0","5","Excellent. I used strawberry jam, and apricot/pineapple jam instead of Rapberry I also did not use the glaze, but i dusted them with powdered sugar. They turned out really good and pretty."
"0","5","This was my first time making thumbprints... and WOW... what a great cookie! I didnt glaze them. I lightly sprinkled powdered sugar on them instead. They looked and tasted amazing... not to mention my guests devoured them! This will become a staple cookie! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I had these cookies at a store once and ever since have been searching for the recipe. Thank you. I made my cookies a little to big for the first batch so I ended up with 24 instead of 36, yummy either way."
"0","5","YUMMY! They were also very easy to make! My picky husband loved them! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","These were some of the best cookies I've ever made. I absolutely loved them. I used vanilla instead of almond extract, and left off the glaze. I also used red plum instead of raspberry jam. My 18 month old even helped out with the thumbprinting. Be sure and make these small as other suggested as they do get much bigger."
"0","5","My family is ranting and raving. I've made thumbprints a number of different ways and this one is the best by far."
"0","5","This is a great and easy recipe. I have also filled the cookies with apricot preserves, using vanilla instead of the almond extract."
"0","5","Spiffeh! :D This recipe was simple, and my roomie thought they were 'yummy'! I substituted rum extract for the almond, and used apricot preserves, since that's all we had on hand. Great recipe!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice. The first time, the cookies spread out too much even though I chilled the dough like the recipe said. This last time, I used extra flour as one reviewer suggested - 1/4 cup or so, chilled it two hours. They came out much much better! My husband loves the taste of these cookies and they are really pretty if you take the time to frost them. I am going to perfect these and add them to my Christmas cookie collection. Great recipe! Thanks!"
"0","4","this was pretty good. i dont like that much almond in my cookies though."
"0","5","Wow! Amazingly delicious & pretty to look at! This would be a perfect 'tea' cookie. I followed the recipe exactly & these cookies turned out great! I used seedless raspberry 100% fruit spread with no added sugar. I will be making these cookies a lot!!!!!!"
"0","5","This was my first attempt at baking 'filled' cookies and they came out perfect! My family (who was skeptical of my baking abilities) raved when they tasted these delicious treats. A must try!"
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic! They don't need the glaze! I'm not a big fan of almond extract, so I used 1/4 tsp of it and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Topped with apricot jam. Great!"
"0","5","it was amazing, except somehow maybe the butter melted a bit, so it was seriously difficult to roll into balls so i just spooned them on thickly. not as pretty but tastewise, seriously good. my sis and i love them! oh, and if you spoon them on too thinly, they spread out and its not good. i didnt use the glaze and it came out great still.a little on the sweet side though."
"0","5","These were so good I couldn't stop eating them! The best part is that I already had all the ingredients on-hand. I plan to make these as my birthday treats for the office later this week and I'm sure they'll be a big hit."
"0","5","I'm not a cookie girl. But I just couldn't help myself. I made these for my neighbors at Christmas time and ended up eating half of them myself!!"
"0","3","The cookies tasted wonderful, but they look awful. I the hole with a small amount of jam so it wouldn't overflow, but the cookie's center puffed up so the hole disappeared and the jam was just a glob. Unless I did something wrong - these were just ok. Not presentable for anyone outside of the family."
"0","5","These are incredible! I made them for my co-workers, for a Christmas party, and for a cookie exchange and haven't heard anything but praise. I did use vanilla extract instead of almond and I didn't glaze all of them - they were great either way! Thanks Dee."
"0","5","really yummy!!! i made this for my BBQ, and my friends all loved it!!!"
"0","5","Excellent - quick and easy. This is the perfect for those who need an easy yet super delicious cookie for a cookie exchange!"
"0","5","i just made these today and they were a hit with the family. my mom liked them too and asked how much butter went into them 'no wonder its so rich'. the dough had less flour compared to other shortbreads i've tried to make the but it was also more flavorful. the almond extract made all the difference. i made smaller sized balls and filled the hole with jam in a bag with a corner snipped off. i omitted the icing. i will definitely make these again."
"0","5","These are easy to make and are very yummy! I made some for Valentine's day, and shaped the 'thumb print' into a heart."
"0","5","Extremely Delicious!! I have made it many times and everytime people think that these are some speciality store bought cookies. They find it hard to believe that these cookies are very simple to make. I have never made the glaze - too lazy - but these are the very best!!"
"0","4","These cookies are delicious. The first year I made them though, I must have put too much rasberry in each cookie and it boiled over the sides as the baked. Now I just use less and they come out perfec."
"0","5","This is just about the best cookie receipe ever. I have sent it to numerous other people, who also rave just as much about it!!"
"0","5","These cookies were great and really easy. I did find that making them 1 1/2 inches round was too big. I also added a bit more raspberry jam. Delicious!"
"0","4","Good recipe. I used huckleberry jam and substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract and they came out good! Only measurement discrepancy I found was I had to add an additional 1.5 teaspoons of milk to the glaze to make it thin enough to drizzle. Cookies impressed the in-laws ;)"
"0","4","These were really very good, but I think next time I will definitely use butter (I used margerine and they seemed to spread a bit). I left out the glaze to make them easy for lil hands to not make messes. I also made a few with hershey kisses in the middles:) These were great for my son with an egg alergy! Thanks!"
"0","4","Very very tasty and quite easy to make. I didn't put the almond extract in, nor did I use vanilla. But I used both seedless rasapberry and seedless strawberry jam and they both turned out very well.  They were a big hit!"
"0","5","My son told me these were the best cookies I made this year - surpassing all his old favorites! Wonderful."
"0","5","This was perfect. It came out really pretty and very tasty. Almost as perfect as fancy store bought cookies. I first rolled up the dough into balls then i made the thumbprints deep rather than wide. Follow this recipe and you won't regret it!!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!!! I rolled out the dough a little larger than the recipe called for and had to leave them in the oven for about 20 minutes, but they turned out well. The almond and raspberry were perfect! I may add in a little more almond extract next time. I also used leftover white butter frosting from decorating the christmas cookies on the thumbprints. I just stirred in some extra almond extract and used a plastic baggie with one tip cut out to do a zig-zag with the icing. They were the biggest hit this holiday season. I'll be making more for valentines day! Thanks!"
"0","4","Not sure what I did wrong...I tried the recipe twice. The first time I baked it right away...and the second after some time in the fridge. It came out somewhat flat. But it tastes very good and looks better after the glaze. Also I've already been asked for the recipes. But I think I'll try some other cookies before coming back to this again."
"0","3","Not too bad. The part that gave it a 3 star is the glaze. I thought it had too much almond flavoring in it. I could have done with just 1/4 teaspoon or none at all. Other than that, it is great."
"0","5","very easy and very good"
"0","5","Great cookie recipe! Fast and easy to do with a group of Brownie Girl Scouts and they were yummy as well! Very 'kid friendly' recipe that tastes great!"
"0","5","These cookies were extremely easy to make and are absolutely delicious! They will look great on my Christmas cookie tray."
"0","4","these cookies were in bad shape coming out of the oven, and i just realized why...never use 'insulated' cookie sheets! the cookies spread too quickly and the jam started boiling off and going crazy.  some were salvagable, and the taste was great. a little too rich, maybe i'll try half-butter half-shortening next time. overall yummy and festive."
"0","5","One of our families favorite cookies! Has a delicious buttery taste too it. Usually do not last for over a few hours after I make a batch."
"0","5","Really great. I prepared the dough ahead of time and froze it for a few weeks so Chritmas baking wouldn't be so crazy. (If you decide to do this, thaw the dough in the fridge overnight.) I replaced the almond extract with vanilla and used apricot preserves instead of raspberry jam. I also drizzled the cool cookies with white and milk chocolate. TONS of raves.  I found the easiest way to make the thumbprints is to roll the dough into balls, place on sheet and push the back of a wooden spoon straight down (careful not to break through the bottom). After that, widen the hole with your index finger, leaving at least a 1/4' rim on the top of the cookie. Fill 'em up and bake away. They're really wonderful!"
"0","5","These are relatively easy to make and they are a very pretty finished cookie as well as a delicious one. Next time I would make the balls only about 1' as I found the larger balls spread too much. I also found they worked better when the hole for the jam was deeper rather than wider. I agree that the glaze requires some thining to drizzle properly. I took other reviewers suggestion to use a plastic bag with a tiny hole in the corner to drizzle the glaze. The only down side to these cookies is that on storing they lose their crisp edges and become soft--but some people like their cookies that way."
"0","5","Wow...I had to make 3 batches of these cookies 'cuz we were eating them as fast as I was making them! At first I thought the drizzle was a little over the top, but it really does add an elegant touch. The best thumbprint cookies that I've ever had!!"
"0","3","This cokie was very tasty, but in general, not a pretty cookie to look at. Make these if you're baking for your family, but not to give away to someone. They don't make a very nice show"
"0","5","Well my husband and I ate about 10 of these cookies before the entire batch was done baking. Nough said!!"
"0","5","I just finished making these cookies, and I wouldn't change a thing. They were great!! I really liked the almond flavor, and the icing was the perfect touch. I agree that just about any flavored preserves would taste great. Thank you so much for this recipe. The kids helped me make these for Santa this year, and I think they are perfect because of the red and white color on the cookies. Thanks again."
"0","2","Cookies were delicious but did not hold their shape at all - needed to chill dough which is not listed in the recipe and still some cookies spread out too thin. Had to throw out about half."
"0","5","I made these cookies for a work party and they were a HUGE hit. The only thing I did differently was I used cherry jam instead of raspberry. The cherry and almond compliment each other very well. Also, a caveat: after I chilled the dough it was VERY hard, impossible to work with. I actually had to let it warm up a bit before I could roll it. Next time I make these, I'll take the dough out of the fridge 45 minutes or so before I want to roll the cookies."
"0","5","these are shortbread through, and through! with a hint of almond and raspberry they're fantastic!!! I'm sure I'll be making these again!"
"0","5","These are great and easy to make. My family loved them so much I made two batches in one week"
"0","5","I just made these cookies and they are wonderful. I didn't even put the glaze on yet. I doubled the recipe so I can share them with the fam, if I don't eat them first. I will definitly be making these again and again. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","I used seedless raspberry jam. The glaze is what really makes these special, however we had to make a little bit more than the recipe called for. A great change from the usual shortbread cookies."
"0","2","hmmm...interesting...not good, but not bad."
"0","5","I followed recipe exactly except for using 1 1/2 tsp. milk for icing. It did not make 36 cookies based on a 1 1/2 inch ball. Next time will make 1 inch balls and make smaller hole (since it did spread quite a bit). Very good. Final product looks like it would have been difficult but it was easy."
"0","5","WOW!! I was a little nervous about using almond extract because my kids are not big fans of almond. They loved it. Very easy to make, and SOOO tastey!"
"0","5","Delicious! Followed the recipe using raspberry and apricot jam and they were a big hit!"
"0","5","my son loved these..I made it with strawberry jam and vanilla extract (it's what I had)..big hit.."
"0","5","This cookie reminds me of marzipan! I was told by my friends and family that it was very yummy, and I definitely enjoyed them, too. I managed to make exactly 36 cookies (an amazing feat for someone who always gets the servings messed up) and filled 1/3 of the cookies with blackberry jam, 1/3 with strawberry, and 1/ with grape. I could have done without the icing because I could taste the powdered sugar, but everyone else said it was delicious. I might reserve a small amount of icing next time to thin out with more milk. Great overall!"
"0","5","These cookies are great!! I made them for my daugters school thanksgiving celebration and now all the teachers are offering to pay me to make them for them."
"0","5","Yummy. I made these with Smuckers Seedless Strawberry Jam. I used the end of the handle on my wooden spoon to make the indentation. I pushed it in about a half an inch and twirled it to make the hole about the size of a dime. This recipe was very quick and easy to make. Next time I will probably double it."
"0","5","Very good. I added 1/4 cup finely ground almonds to the dough. Instead of the glaze, I used melted almond bark/white chocolate."
"0","5","Excellent cookies yummy and pretty!"
"0","4","These were way too sweet for my taste, next time I won't add the frosting from this recipe. Otherwise, it was good--I substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract because my family is not a fan of almond extract."
"0","5","I love this recipe. I have made it for the past two years for Christmas and now all my friends are asking for them again. This is one of the best recipes for filled cookies that I have ever tasted."
"0","5","This is my most requested cookie at family gatherings and church events. I actually made them for my cousin's wedding to go along with the wedding cake and people were eating them before they even hit the dessert table. Just excellent. The only subsitute I made was changing the almond for vanilla. I am not crazy over the almond flavor."
"0","5","These cookies were perfect!! When you add the icing, it adds just the right amount of sweetness. These cookies are great for my family, because many of them are allergic to chocolate. They LOVED these!"
"0","5","These were great! I used vanilla extract because I'm not a big fan of almond. I also did not use the glaze and just dusted them with confectioners sugar. Still tasted great!"
"0","5","a very easy cookie to make. I used a jam with seeds and it worked out fine. I also took the advice of another review and used chocolate instead of glaze. I coated the bottom of the cookie and drizzled more chocolate on top. They looked very elegant and made perfect gifts."
"0","5","This recipies is excellent. The glaze really brings all the flavors together. I found that the 1 1/2 ball with less filling and a shallower hole works best. Also I made 1 1/2 times the amount of glaze, because it was so unique."
"0","5","Thanks for the great recipe. I made these to take to our church coffee hour and the people kept coming back for more. It's hard to eat only one. I filled a cookie decorator with the jam and it made filling the cookies a snap!"
"0","5","These were awesome. I had made them for a cookie reception and people couldn't stop talking about them. Thanks for this great recipe. I didn't change a thing."
"0","5","Dangerously good!! I made these for Christmas to give to family and ended up making a double batch because they are sinful! Everyone loves them and they don't last."
"0","5","these cookies turned out great! the dough was a little crumbly, but after working it with my hands it came together quite well. i should have listen to other people's advice about making small indentations--i think it would like better in terms of presentation. i love the almond/raspberry combo. next time i'll try vanilla with something else."
"0","5","OMG!!! These are soooo good! Super easy to make and look beautiful! Excellent xmas cookies. The only thing I recommend is to add more milk to the icing so the consistency is less thick. Will definately make again!"
"0","4","It's a good recipie. It worked well for me the first time I made it, but - and probably out of personal flaw - never worked out right again. (They bake out much flatter than intended.) I found that replacing the almond extract with vanilla extract makes a more universal setting for almost any form of preserve or jelly. Try this recipie with vanilla extract and orange marmalade, topped with white chocolate chunks."
"0","5","These cookies were amazing! No need to say more. I made them for a party and several people raved about them and asked me for the recipe. I'll definitely be making them again!!!! They were simple to make, yet really impressive looking and tasting. The almond extract is the key! Delish . . ."
"0","4","These were great cookies, the dough even tasted good by itself. I used strawberry and grape jam since I didn't have rasberry, they tasted delicious. My girlfriend and kid loved them, which by the way it's a great cookie to make with kids since it's very simple. The little guy enjoyed the mixing and filling with jam. Next time I will be sure to double up on the recipe since it doesn't make very many."
"0","4","YUM...everything turned out wonderful. I too used about 1T of milk for the glaze. I also substituted Butternut flavor for the almond. I made my cookies quite larger and they turned out pretty good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the filling was a little weird but it may have been the brand I used."
"0","5","I've made these cookies (without the glaze) twice and they were a hit both times. Do not bake until brown, or else cookies are very hard - 18 min is just right. An amazingly easy to make and delicious cookie. Thanks!"
"0","5","I got this recipe from a Land O'Lakes brochure. Yum!!! A little more work than I'm used to with cookies, but definitely worth it. One of the best cookies I've ever had. I received rave reviews and a few people thought I picked them up at the bakery."
"0","4","I made this recipe for the holidays, and they came out delicious. I used vanilla extract because the store didn't have almond extract, and they were still loved by those who ate them."

"0","5","Great cookie! So EASY and quick to make! Very pretty. First ones gone at church function! I always use REAL unsalted butter too."
"0","4","Not to bad of a cookie."
"0","5","We loved these cookies, and will continue to make them. Very easy. Very quick. Do not substitute Butter Flavored Crisco for butter. Will come out ok, but not the same when using butter. Very light. Looked good. Tasted Good. It made much more than three dozen. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","This is a variation of a recipe I've used before at the holidays. The only difference between the two that I rememeber is that the other one makes the cookie in the shape of a bar. The cookie itself is a light, buttery shortbread. The jam makes it a little sweeter, but overall very good."
"0","3","Made these last yr for a road trip from TX to FL. I ate most of them on the way. Too sweet for my small children, but just right for me! Making them to send to my G.mother for Christmas!"
