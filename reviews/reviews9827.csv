"761","5","These are EXCELLENT!!! Some of the best cookies I have ever made. I did make a few changes--half margarine/half shortening (I do this with all of my cookies...for some reason my cookies can turn out flat as frisbees, this prevents that from happening), and I did half brown sugar/half white sugar. The end result? OMG, cookies of divine chocolaty-ness, to die for. Better than the local bakery's chocolate chocolate chip cookies. I'd give it more stars if I could. Happy eating!"
"607","5","Great recipe just as written. Whenever a cookie recipe calls for butter I always chill the dough for an hour or so before baking as this prevents a flat cookie. The taste of butter can't be beat! The chocolate chips and nuts can be substituted with any variety of options...this time I used two King Size Hershey Bars with almonds, but vanilla chips, dried cherries, etc. could also be fun to try. Great recipe, great cookie. Thanks for sharing!"
"444","5","Ooo-ooo-oooh! Marvelous little bites of chocolate heaven. After reading previous reviews I was concerned about dryness after the first day so I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening for the fat. Since I was using a small cookie scoop, I used mini chocolate chips (baked for 8 minutes)...all I can say is they are perfect for a chocoholic like me. For those who don't know this tip: Line your baking sheet with regular old aluminum foil and you'll have no problem with cookies sticking. Use a new sheet each time then slide the foil onto newspapers to cool slightly before removing cookies to wire racks. Thank you for the perfect recipe!"
"313","4","A little update - it has now been more than three days, and the cookies are still wonderfully soft and chewy in my airtight cookie jar. Also, if your cookies do dry out, try putting a slice of raw apple in there with them. They'll soften up soon. This apple trick also works for gingersnaps or any other cookie that gets hard quickly. It also works for brown sugar that has hardened. Don't leave the apple in there so long that it spoils, of course!"
"165","5","I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2c shortening instead of the 1 cup of butter and they came out similiar to the wonderful 'Otis Spunkmeyer' cookies! Very tasty...be sure to use the lesser cooking time as they continue to cook on the sheet."
"150","5","These cookies are great! They are very soft and chewy with a nice rich chocolate flavor. In fact, they taste just like little brownies. I was concerned they would not turn out because the dough seemed thick and sticky, but baking at 350 degrees for exactly 8 min produced a perfectly plump and shiny cookie! Using half chocolate and half white chips makes these so cute! I will probably add chopped nuts next time I bake these which is sure to be soon!"
"141","5","Long review alert! Yes, even after 1000+ reviews, I am going to leave one! Deep chocolate flavor, pleasantly (but not overly) sweet, soft texture but not too gooey, perfect height(not flat) and just downright irresistible! I read through 100's of reviews and made the following tweaks to this recipe: 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup solid shortening instead of 1 c butter, 3/4 c white sugar & 3/4 c dark brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 c white sugar, 1 T vanilla instead of 2 t vanilla, used dutch processed cocoa, 1 t baking soda instead of 3/4 t, and added 1 t baking powder and 1 t instant coffee. In addition I used aluminum foil to line the pans and that eliminated any sticking. The dough was not sticky at all and it held together well without spreading (I didn't even refrigerate the batter between batches!). Several tips for cookie novices (I learned from previous reviewers): Mix the butter & shortening until fluffy, then add the eggs and vanilla and beat with a mixer until blended to death! When you think it's ready, do an extra minute. Mix(by hand, not mixer) the dry ingredients before adding to the wet ingredients. Mix the wet and dry ingredients with a wooden spoon until the dry ingredients are just mixed in. THEN, using a hand mixer, continue to blend the ingredients until you don't see a speck of dry material! At this point add the chips and nuts by hand. I made 40 cookies at about 2 1/2 inches across. Death by Chocolate! Whoo-hoo!"
"118","5","These are so chocolatey it's ridiculous! Not a bad thing, but I'm definitely going to add more nuts next time. They aren't dense, and they stay very soft. The only change I made to this recipe was to follow the suggestion to use 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar (light brown, very lightly packed), and it's perfect. Co-workers are giving thumbs-up!"
"89","5","I thought that these cookies were really good. Great flavor, my boyfriend loved them. Just make sure that you underbake them or they will get a bit hard."
"77","4","These were just what I needed to satisfy the chocolate craving! They were more like cake than cookie and the faster you can eat them the better cause they do get dry and crumbly after a day GREAT TASTE!"
"65","5","Wonderful cookies!"
"45","4","HELPFUL TIPS: I found no need at all to split this half white sugar/brown sugar especially since this is already perfect and sweet!!! I've tried it both ways. It's true that any combo of half butter/half shortening or all butter makes NO DIFFERENCE. So if you're trying to decide what will make the better product, don't let this consume you. Nice thick cookies = after mixing batter, stick it in the fridge for an hour+. Take out and bake. Took me 10 min and I usually use my batter the next day or two. You can ALWAYS freeze whatever you don't plan on eating in a week. Then just take out what you want the next week. Will taste exactly the same and your family will love you! :) I doubled the recipe because I freeze extras, and only used 2.5C of chocolate chips (mixed semi and milk chocolate) and it was PLENTY!!! I can't imagine putting more in. SO... if I were to make 1 batch, I'd just use a heaping CUP. This goes with any chocolate chip cookie recipe fwiw."
"25","5","These cookies are to die for! I followed the recipe for the most part, substituting 1 cup of margarine for 1 cup of butter, using 1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips, and needed an extra 1/4 cup of flour (however, that's just because I use my KitchenAid stand mixer to mix the dough). Instead of dropping by spoonful, I rolled into 1-ish inch balls and slightly flattened. Let them bake for 10 minutes until the top started cracking. And they were heaven! Soft and moist and full of flavour."
"24","2","these are waaayyyy to sweet!!!!!!!!!! it over powers the chocolate flavor. and they don't stay soft..... next time, if I decide to make these again...i will cut the sugar and replace some of it with brown sugar!!!!!1"
"22","5","these were soooo good, I used dark chocolate chips and baked them for about 8 mns exactly and let then cool, tasted like little mini brownies. GREAT"
"17","5","These cookies are AMAZING! Even after they're cooled, they still have that melt-in-your mouth quality and the chips are still soft. They taste like brownies. Awesome awesome recipe just as it is!"
"14","5","This was a wonderful chewy yummy cookie. I didn't find it to be cake like at all. It has a very chewy fudgy taste. Like a brownie...but with cookie taste and texture. I did change a couple of things though. I used 1c. white sugar and then used 1/2c. brown sugar. I also didn't have any nuts, so I decided I'd add 1/2c. coconut. It was almost like a chewy chocolate macaroon, and the cookies stayed soft for as long as they existed in my house."
"12","5","Great Cookies!!! I made a double* batch. I used 50% Butter and 50% Shortening. 2* cups White sugar and 1* cup brown sugar. I baked them for 12 minutes (made 2.5 inch diameter cookie). I also used walnuts. Each cookie has came out perfect."
"11","5","These cookies are really good! I found it best to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes before cooking--these makes the dough easier to manage and not quite as sticky. I used my cookies to make icecream sandwiches. Ofcourse to do that, just take 2 cookies and mash 1 scoop of softened icecream between them. Wrap up and freeze! :-)"
"10","5","Woowwwwww awesome!! I followed the recipe exactly minus the walnuts (didn't have any in) but cannot wait to try w/ the walnuts...or maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to make them again- sooo good!"
"10","5","These are very nice cookies. My little sister, age 10, wanted to make double chocolate cookies, and this is the simplest recipe I could find, but we had to half it as we didn't have enough ingredients. In particular, we had no semisweet chocolate chips--so what I did was chop up the bittersweet chocolate I had into small chunks. The result were cookies that, because they weren't too sweet, were more grown-up than kids, in my opinion; but everyone loved them, especially my sister. This one's a keeper!"
"9","5","Deliciously rich and decadent. These are so good right out of the oven."
"9","5","Whoa these are good! Definate keepers! I only changed a couple of things: I used only half the butter called for and I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour. You can't taste the difference and they end up being a lot less greasy! These cookies aren't cakey at all, they are very moist and fudgey...as long as you don't overbake them!"
"9","5","If you're skeptical about this recipe, DONT BE!! This is by far the best cookie recipe I've ever made and tasted. I get all my cookie recipes on here and there has been soo many times a cookie recipe has had great reviews and they turn out horrible. But this is wonderful,especially if you love chocolate!!I did what many people said to do, use 1 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I can't say it enough,these are delicious!!!!:)MUST TRY!"
"9","3","Good cookie. Good taste, but too crunchy. Definitely the kind of cookie to eat right out of the oven if you prefer them to be good and chewy!!"
"8","5","Yummy yum yum. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar."
"8","5","I used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips, and added pecans instead of walnuts. My kids were crazy about them!"
"7","5","Used 1/2 C shortening and 1/2 C butter. Used a half/half mixture of brown and white sugar. Moist inside, crispy out. Very tasty."
"7","4","This recipe was pretty good! I took the advice of the people who didn't like this recipe and added a little more flour so that they wouldn't flatten as much. I would also make half the sugar brown sugar rather than white. (I didn't do that. I was out of brown sugar, which is why I chose this recipe.) They are a little brownie-ish, but not as brownie-ish if you bake them a little longer."
"7","5","Oh my gosh! These are the best cookies I've ever had. I am a certified choc-o-holic and even I could only handle 2 of these cookies at a time. They are so rich and so soft. Even a week later they are soft. This is my new favorite recipe.  I didn't have any white chocolate chips (I don't care for them anyway, because chocolate isn't chocolate unless it's brown!) but they tasted wonderful and they didn't lack in taste in any way. Everyone who tasted them asked for the recipe!"
"7","5","Amazing, I would rate these higher if I could also. Unfortunately I am home alone and no one knows I have made them as yet, so it is taking a bucket of willpower not to eat them ALL. Divine and thoroughly decadent. Thanks for this keeper Kathy."
"6","1","Made these cookies several times and typically use half white sugar and half brown sugar. Have used different extracts for flavoring (almond once, mint once with mint chips). Always get asked for the recipe."
"6","5","OMG !! These were soooo good!! I made these for a dinner. I ended up having way too much dough so I wrapped it in parchment paper into a log and then wrapped it in cling wrap and when I wanted cookies I would cut out a few and bake. Really yummy and the frozen dough stayed well for a couple weeks (didn't last long!! LOL!!)"
"6","4","4 stars because they arent PERFECT but they are really good espcially when you take into account the most reveiwed review..."
"6","3","The batter was very thick and sticky, and didn't melt down into a normal cookie shape, the cookies pretty much just stayed weird lumps even after baking. I may flatten them with a spoon next time."
"6","5","The best! Kids love it, my husband loves it! Very quick and easy."
"6","5","I made these cookies for my family and these are by far the best double chocolate cookies I have ever tasted. I did the recipe just as it is written (I didn't think to look at the reviews first) and they came out wonderfully."
"6","5","Delicious! Definitely satisfies a chocolate craving. I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Also, used a whole cup of chopped nuts - just didn't seem like enough compared to the choc. chips otherwise. Used Ghiradelli's big semi sweet chips - they were great! I've kept mine in an airtight container and they are just as fresh as the day I baked them."
"6","5","These are fabulous! I substituted the sugar with Splenda (cup for cup) and the chocolate chips with sugarfree baking chips and they are still delicious. I can't eat sugar but my kids can, so I finally found a recipe that I can split in half and accomodate all of our needs!"
"6","5","great chocolate chocolate chip cookies! We added 2 tsp. peppermint extract and came up with mint chocolate chocolate chip cookies for a holiday twist!"
"5","5","Awesome!!!! My kids adore them."
"5","5","Very soft and chocolatey. Baked for 10.5 minutes. Good with coffee"
"5","5","Wow, almost 2,000 reviewers can't be wrong! Marvelous cookies. I used dark chocolate chips and cocoa on the second batch and they were even better."
"5","5","sooooo wonderful, used choc chips ad peanut butter chips. WOW!!! Also at Christmas time used this with mint chips, again, WOW!!!"
"5","5","Fixed my chocolate cravings!"
"5","3","These cookies were good, but boaring. I'm sure there is a better recipe. They were perfect, but boaring"
"5","5","yum!! i hope you make more recipes like this!!"
"5","5","Delicious! These cookies are amazing, like a mix of a cookie with brownie texture! I always add some white and dark chocolate chips."
"5","3","I followed the recipe with the butter and had no problem with the consistency. I have found that the main way to keep a cookie chewy is to completely melt the butter, whip in the sugar, and then let it cool down as much as possible without resolidifying before adding the eggs. It keeps the fat in the cookie consistent instead of little melting pockets of fat in the oven. My problem had more to do with the taste. The beauty of a cookie is its simplicity but this still needed something extra-either an extract, cherries, or caramel or SOMETHING other than chocolate chips. Even my husband turned his nose up. I did use dark chocolate cocoa powder because I prefer that extra depth but that didn't help. I like chocolate chips in chocolate cookies but these were a little too much for me. Thank you for posting (I enjoyed making them with my three year old) and I do suspect that it was a personal preference issue."
"5","5","These are one of my all time favorite cookies!!! The texture is perfect, the taste is perfect. The only think that I don't like is that every time I make them I never get any because they are all gone before I get a chance!!!"
"5","5","OOOoooohhhhhh! These are soooo yummy! Decadent, rich and gooey! I will DEFINATELY be making these again and again and again!"
"5","5","Easy to make, great cookies. I used 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup dried cherries."
"5","5","OMG!!! THESE WERE THE BEST COOKIES MY KIDS HAVE EVER HAD!! I CAN'T MAKE 'EM FAST ENOUGH! THEY ARE EATING THEM FASTER THAN I CAN MAKE THEM!! THANKS SO MUCH...NOW WE ARE ALL CHOCOHOLICS! FOLLOWED RECIPE TO A 'T' AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A MORE BROWNIE LIKE COOKIE AS SOME REVIEWS SAID...MAYBE I DID SOMETHING WRONG? ANYWAYS, THESE ROCK AND WILL MAKE THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER.....!!!!"
"5","5","A baker- I am not- but it's impossible to mess these up! The kids (one who doesnt usually like cookies??) LOVED them! I've made them twice already in the last 2 weeks! Soft and chewy, and SO GOOD!"
"5","5","Very good! I had a huge craving for chocolate and these satisfied it! I replaced 1/2c of white sugar with brown, as several people suggested. I also only baked each batch for 8 minutes. The batches I baked for longer we hard and crumbly the next day, while the 8 min batches stayed soft."
"5","5","Wow - I've been looking for a good chocolate cookie recipe and now I've found it! Soft and tastes like my favorite brownies! I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening, 1 C chocolate chips and 1 C peanut butter chips...they were great!"
"5","5","This is an awesome cookie! It truly is my favorite. Thank you for submitting this recipie! Edited 11/15/2007: I still make these after all these years, it is one of my favorite cookie recipes of all time and I make a lot of cookies. If I could give it more stars I would. I never used nuts due to my nut allergies."
"4","5","DELICIOUS AND RICH! Added m&m's to some of the cookies per my son's request. Did not add as many chips as called for, may have only used about 1 1/4 cups or so. Did use nuts, they were good in there. Also used 1 c of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 c of white sugar, turned out great that way, will do that again. 9 min was about perfect in our oven. Refrigerated batter when I wasn't using it to keep it from getting soft, but it was a really stiff batter."
"4","2","My hubby liked these but my 6 yr old took one bite and won't eat them. won't make again!"
"4","5","Loved these! I made a double batch and froze some into little pucks to take out and cook up whenever I had a chocolate craving :)"
"4","5","I used a mint cocoa powder and added a bit of peppermint flavor. My family doesn't care for nuts in their cookies so I left them out."
"4","3","I would give these 3.5 stars - they were just OK to me. I think next time I would make sandwich cookies with frosting in the middle to make them more exciting."
"4","5","Yummy! I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and omitted the nuts. I otherwise made these as written and they were devoured quickly!"
"4","5","these cookies are great i love them and all my friends do too!!! i found that they come out very thick so it helps to take a spatula and pat them down when the are still warm. enjoy!!!"
"4","3","I dunno, these weren't bad, but if I'm looking for chocolate-chocolate chip cookies, I want them to be seriously rich and dark. Since these only have cocoa powder in them, they turned out light and cakey, and kind of wimpy on the chocolate taste. Guess I'll have to look for something using real baking chocolate."
"4","5","Followed this recipe exactly (without the walnuts) and it was fantastic! This was a huge hit with everyone - the grandparents, my husband, and my son!"
"4","4","This is a good recipe on its own, but I substituted half a stick of butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 a cup of butter (to contain spread during baking). Added in both white and brown sugar, used Ghiradelli's dark chocolate chips, 3/4 cup of slivered almonds, and one packet of Starbucks VIA Italian Roast instant coffee. I had to beat off the kids with a stick (...translation: I had to make three batches)"
"4","5","There is no such thing as too much chocolate and this prooves it! I also made this recipe using white chocolate chips instead of the regular chocolate chips"
"4","5","Wonderful recipe! These make great soft cookies and have a wonderful chocolate flavor! My niece made them for us and now the whole family has claimed the recipe. Thank you for submitting this recipe. It is our new favorite."
"4","5","I've gotta say these are the stars of this years Christmas cookies, well these and the beautiful Chocolate Crinkles III because they look like they're covered with melting snow. I upped the ante with a couple of ounces of chopped unsweetened solid chocolate and a few grains of course salt on top. WOW is the most common response after the first bite."
"4","4","Very yummy! I did make a few changes - I used all brown sugar instead of white (brown sugar will make for a moister cookie while white sugar makes the cookie crunchier) and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Other users complained of flat cookies so they integrated shortening...I didn't do this and my cookies came out great. How flat your cookies are relates to how runny and sticky the batter is. If you use slightly softened butter and beat the sugar/egg/butter mixture really well, the batter holds up and you get chewy, slightly flattened cookie but still holds it's shape very well. If you nuke the butter in the microwave or bake on a hot day where your butter has melted to or almost to liquid form, the cookies will be thinner. Try cooling the batter in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes then re-beating before adding in the flour mixture, and proceed as normal. Also, I used 1/2 semisweet chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. Next time I will incorporate white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips to really give a variety of chocolate flavors."
"4","5","these are completely heavenly, with the recipe prepared exactly as written. needs no substitutions or changes. my 3 year old and i made them this afternoon and haven't stopped munching on them since!"
"4","1","I'm sorry but this is truly the worst chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever used. I followed the recipe to a t- the cookies are dry and flavorless. There is no salvaging this recipe, just try another one."
"4","5","Fair winner! My 9yo son made these as written and entered them in the county fair. He won best chocolate chip cookie, and was a finalist for best of show out of all children's cooking entries received. We lvoed eating the left overs later. Plus, since he only had to enter 6 cookies per recipe, we froze half of the dough. It thawed and cooked just fine weeks later."
"4","5","I gave this 5 stars for delivering exactly what it promises-a tasty, cakey, chocolaty cookie. My personal preference for a richer chocolate taste is to use bittersweet chips instead of semisweet and to use Ghiradelli cocoa powder instead of Hershey cocoa powder. We also used this recipe substituting mint/chocolate chips for the semisweet, and that was delicious."
"4","5","These are definitely my favorite cookies and are always a big hit with everyone! I make the recipe as is, which is the exact same as the one in my Hershey's cookbook (to a tee!). I have substituted peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips before, and they are always a crowd pleaser! Enjoy!"
"4","5","These are AMAZING cookies! I used the half brown half/white sugar AND half butter/half shortening suggestions and the cookies came out gorgeous. I also stirred in some Reese's pieces. SUPER YUM! I love this recipe!"
"4","5","Very good. I like to refrigerate my cookie dough. It seems like they always turn out looking nicer and it makes them hold their shape really well. Just scoop out a spoonful of cold dough and roll into a ball. Also, baking on parchment paper ensures they won't get too brown or overcooked on the bottom."
"4","4","pretty good. i would stick with regular tollhouse chocolate chips. i used the expensive ghirardelli chocolate chips and they didn't seem to taste very good for some reason. and i think it needed a touch more salt because they seemed to be flavorless, like someone else had mentioned. or maybe more sugar was needed. still, not bad."
"4","5","These cookies were PERFECT! Soft and chocolatey! I made a few adjustments. I used 3/4 cup white sugar, and 3/4 cup brown sugar packed. Also 2 TBSP of vanilla. I cooked them for 9 minutes and they are perfect! I just made these again and this time I used mini hershey's kisses chocolate chips and white chocolate chips and OMG!!!! If you are a chocolate lover...you'll pretty much orgasm in your pants."
"4","5","'MMMmmm!!!' They are so delicious! DEFINITELY let them cool on the cookie sheet before transferring them to the cooling rack. I made the mistake on one cookie on the first batch and the cookie crumbled. So, I left the rest alone to cool on there own before transferring them."
"4","5","Wow.... these cookies are just... well, the name says it all. I would like to share my own little take on these, which is perfect for anyone looking for the only possible way (in my humble opinion, anyhow) to improve upon these delights: 1. replace the chocolate chips with more or less the same amount of roughly chopped mexican chocolate, either bitter or semi-sweet (note: I'm not actually sure where you can find this... probably in food specialty stores, if not in your average super dooper market. For those of you who have never tried it, it is very grainy and sweet, filled with lots of cinnamon and spice)  2. add in a touch of extra cinnamon if you so desire  3. and for the ultimate twist... chop up 1-4 whole dried cayenne or other small red peppers very finely (remember to remove the seeds) and pop them in! It should add a really special and spicy note to the cookies that doesn't have to be overpowering. I understand that this isn't for everyone, but you should walk on the wild side and give it a go!"
"4","5","Very tasty! I took this to an office bakeoff and they were very popular."
"4","5","Wow! Unbelievable. Do not go near this recipe if you are on a diet! I used dark chocolate chips instead (they are 'health food' you know). I should be super-'healthy' now ;)...! My kids said I was the best cookie-maker EVER! Thank you for the great recipe!"
"4","5","These are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out moist, chocolately, and delicious. I made them to send to boyfriend deployed with the military. When he got them he said he had to hide them from everyone, definitely one I will use again."
"4","4","While it is still hot...it does taste like brownies...YUMMY.... I would have rated it 5star, but then my husband wanted a more crispy cookies...so, ...."
"4","5","These were awesome! the batter is thick, so the cookies dont spread everywhere when you cook them, i love that. I used m&ms instead of chocolate chips :)"
"4","5","I was concerned when my first batch was so thick. No need to worry as these cookies are amazing. Taste like little brownies. The only change I made was  1 1/4c white flour and 3/4c whole wheat(instead of 2c white) Cookies look a little underdone when they come out but are super moist when cooled."
"4","4","A week ago I took the top six Chocolate Chip Cookies from this website and made all of them. I took the cookies to work and my church social, and asked people to tell me which cookies were their favorite. This recipe got about seven percent of the vote. Not terrible, but I didn't care for the cocoa-y flavor myself personally."
"4","1","Yummy!"
"4","5","Great recipe! They really are soft and have a wonderful chocolate flavor. I added white chocolate chips instead and they were awesome!! I will definitely be making these cookies again!"
"4","5","Definetely 5 stars. A delicious cookie. I just finished baking them and it's hard to stop myself from eating them all straight out of the oven. The batter couldn't have been easier to make. Perfect for chocaholics!"
"4","5","So delicious! Keep them small so they don't disappear so fast!"
"3","5","I made this for my wife and son last week, chocolate chip cookies are her favorite and they both swooned over these. I added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to the batter which deepened the chocolate flavor more towards a dark chocolate cookie with semisweet morsels. Outstanding."
"3","5","The only problem with these is that you'll want to eat way more than you should! Yummy!"
"3","5","Yum! Very chocolately and rich - which you want from this recipe. stayed soft. Exactly what I want in a cookie. KEEPER!!"
"3","5","These cookies are very good. I recommend cutting flour by 1/4 cup as 2 cups of flour plus cocoa powder make for lumpy cookies."
"3","5","These are so good. I did use white chips and no walnuts. The chocolate is almost brownie like but still a perfect cookie. I'm almost sorry I found this recipe, it's absolutely perfect as written, but I want to eat a 1/2 dozen right now! They are going to work tomorrow so we won't be tempted here at home. * Update after taking them to work. I got so many compliments, and one of my co-workers said it truly was the best tasting, best texture and best aftertaste that he'd ever had in his 50 some odd years!! I take that as a high compliment. thank you Kathy for such a wonderful, easy recipe that made me look good :)"
"3","5","Made the exact same recipe from the Hershey's website. Made it as written, except that I substituted pecans for the walnuts, and used half white chocolate and half semisweet chocolate chips. This is an excellent recipe. I would give it more stars if possible. Thanks so much for sharing this!"
"3","5","These were yummy....added dried cherries which was awesome! Also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as other suggested and refrigerated the dough for 1 hour prior to scooping."
"3","3","At first, straight from the oven, these cookies are amazing! Like brownie cookies...  Then, when cooled, they smell weird and taste more like dry biscotti...  And then, after a few days, they smell funky..... i don't think I'll be making these again...."
"3","5","These cookies are delicious and taste just like brownies!! Reading some of the reviews I did 1 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I cooked each batch for 8 minutes exactly and they were delicious. Also chilled the dough for an hour before cooking."
"3","5","Definitely a make-again. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful."
"3","5","Soo good! wouldn't change a thing."
"3","2","Maybe I did something wrong, but these cookies did not spread at all and were hard as rock after two days."
"3","5","these cookies are yummmmmmmmmmmmmm"
"3","5","My new favorite cookie! I like to double the cocoa powder and the chocolate chips. This is so easy to make and super delicious."
"3","5","Great cookies, no complaints. a bit extra cocoa is nice and rich. Option: replace the vanilla with peppermint flavoring and they are nice and minty!"
"3","4","These were delicious. Like brownies in cookie form!"
"3","5","WOW,I'm a chocoholoic, and am always looking for that chocolate treat that is lower in calories, carbs, and fat. This is it! I also used half margarine and half butter flavored Crisco so they won't go flat...I also used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also love to eat my cookies FROZEN. THIS MY NEW CHOCOLATE TREAT!!!!"
"3","5","I don't think we'll ever make regular chocolate chip cookies again! Delicious! Everyone loved them."
"3","5","Lovely cookies! Totally satisfies the chocolate craving. I made them as directed and they were great, very rich. Now I cut back on the sugar (1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown) and I use 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat which hides well in chocolate. Still great!"
"3","5","Wonderful! I have been looking for a chocolate chocolate chip recipe that is not dry for a long time, and this one is so moist and chocolaty. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","These were so great! I did take the advice and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. There were perfection!"
"3","5","Recipe was fantastic. I used half white sugar and half coconut palm sugar. Everyone loved them and I will definetly make them again. Thank you for the great recipe!"
"3","5","Out of this world!!!! Only changes I made were splitting the sugar...half white, half brown and used 1 cup chips and about 1 cup toffee chips. Next time might try dividing flour...half white, half wheat. Best cookies ever!"
"3","5","Very, very tasty cookies. This one's a keeper. The only changes I made to the recipe were halved butter (replaced with applesauce and veg. oil), Eggbeaters instead of egg, and 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 brown. When I took them out after 8 minutes or so, they were complete mush - THIS IS OK! It took me 2 batches to figure out that they would firm up after I let them cool on the sheet. They turn out chewy this way. For a more crunchy cookie, I cooked them just a little longer on a lower heat."
"3","5","worked out great used m&ms instead of chocolate chips! thanks!"
"3","5","This is my family's favorite cookie. I'm asked to make these at least once a week :D"
"3","5","Followed this to the tee and they turned out delicious! Light, fluffy and chewy - just perfect! Thank you for the great recipe!"
"3","4","amazing recipe! i substituted 1 cup butter with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine. Also, 1 1/2 cup white sugar with 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 white sugar and it turned out so yummy. thanks!"
"3","5","I baked these cookies tonight and they were great!the family loved them! The only thing I changed was I added raspberry choc chips......thanks for the great recipe!"
"3","5","I took the tip to refrigerate the dough for a bit before spooning onto the pan. I also went ahead and sprayed the pan so it wouldn't stick. Eight minutes and VOILA! Delicious. They were a hit."
"3","5","awesome! i used reeses pieces instead ofchocolate chips and they came out AMAZING!"
"3","4","Someone said these were bakery quality, and I believe I have to agree. They are like a crisp and chewy chocolate chip cookie with a chocolate base. Only thing is I oddly prefer a cakey and not chewy cookie. These are quite sweet to. I can see why these have wide appeal though. I made 1/2 recipe and got about 2 and a half dozen using a standard cookie scoop. I was even 1/4 cup short on the chocolate chips and there still seemed to be plenty. I made them for a work office and I am certain they will all get eaten."
"3","5","These turned out just as well as those I buy at the bakery! Very easy to make; I didn't change anything in the recipe. They were moist and chewy; a perfect cookie!"
"3","5","These are super yummy! I used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and 3/4 cup dried cranberries. DEEE-lish!"
"3","5","Just great! And so easy to make!!"
"3","5","leave out the walnuts, unnecessary. split the sugar into half white, half brown. follow the rest of the recipe exactly. NO FAIL - best cookies i've ever made."
"3","3","I'm not going to deny that they were tasty, but to be honest I am disappointed with these cookies. I expected something completely different. They taste like boxed chocolate cake... I hope that they will taste more like real cookies once they are chilled."
"3","5","OMG These are so delicious!!!! They didn't flatten or spread much, almost cakelike. I used 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. These are going to be a red like cookie for me. Rich mmmmmm so good. KEEPER!"
"3","5","Just baked these. So glad I did. YUM. My 15 year old told me these are his new favorite cookie! So rich and fudgy. Who would give these less than 5 stars?"
"3","5","this recipe was delicious. but im gonna try something different with this after we r done eating the rest of these cookie. im gonna coat the top with sugar and just flatten it a little so it'll be crunchy and hopefully soft in the inside"
"3","5","Good!"
"3","5","So I've been trying not to eat dessert lately after admitting to myself that I had A Problem. But today, I needed a chocolate fix. A VERY chocolatey fix.  I made these and they're perfect for what I was looking for. Soft, some crunch from the walnuts, gooey chocolate morsels in the center - delicious.  Changes I made: 1. I kept the amount of sugar the same, but divided it between white and brown sugar. 2. I halved the entire recipe because if I make 4 dozen cookies, I'll eat at least half of them. 3. I didn't have a cup of chocolate chips at home, so it was more like 1/2-3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips, and the rest were Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chips.  The recipe yield was 17 cookies in the end (instead of 24), probably because I consistently make cookies a little bigger than they should be, and my boyfriend kept eating batter as I was plopping it onto the baking sheets.  Bake for 8 minutes exactly; don't worry if they look undercooked. That keeps them gooey + amazing."
"3","5","Awesome cookies! I used half butter half shortening, the cookies came off the cookie sheet much easier than with just using all butter. They also retained their shape better so keep that in mind if using shortening. I didn't take the time to make the dough balls pretty, they look somewhat like dog piles but hey, they taste great! Used 1 cup white sugar and half cup brown. Will most definitely be making these again, thanks!"
"3","5","If you are a chocoholic, these are the cookies for you! They are so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and the cookies came out perfect. I made them for a gathering and everyone is begging me for the recipe. Soft, chewy, decadent, delicious and super easy! I baked them on parchment paper just until set. Sure they deflate a little, but so do most cookies. They look just like chewy chips ahoy. Delicious even a few days later."
"3","5","Very, very chocolaty! I added 3c. chocolate chips instead of 2 and 3/4 cup of almonds. The first batch was a little dry so we took them out sooner the next time. Very good!"
"3","5","Everybody loved this cookie. I did add 1 Tablespoon of milk at the end of the mixing because I thought it was too thick. Delicious!"
"3","5","I decided to make these for my sick friend who said she was craving chocolate. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding M&Ms instead of chocolate chips (I wanted them to be a little more colorful!). She said they were the 'best cookies ever!' I took the leftovers to other friends, and they all loved them, too. I got 5 dozen cookies out of the recipe, and I cooked each batch for 8 minutes."
"3","5","Chocolate heaven!!! Used half butter and half shortening and added an additional half cup of flour. Cooked for full 10 minutes and cooled on pan for 5 minutes. Make these and you will not be disappointed!"
"3","5","these are awesome!!!! I made them exactly as written and they turned out awesome!!!!"
"3","5","These were some of the best chocolat chocolate chip cookies I have ever eaten! Easy to make but they were a little thin, and the kids loved them.  Thanks"
"3","5","These cookies are a chocolate lovers dream!!"
"3","4","Great basic chocolate cookies but I'm still looking......"
"3","5","DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted half the butter for shortening. They are amazing."
"3","5","Very Good!!! Good texture and I might add some white chocolate chips to the recipe next time to add some color."
"3","5","This is a supper cookie. I did a couple of minor changes. cut the salt in 1/2 and used only 1 cup of sugar."
"3","5","OH MY GOODNESS!... I found heaven on earth! These are incredibly chocolaty, rich and delicious cookies! Easy to make and they are nice and soft, not hard cookies. Mmmmm....so good!"
"3","5","I didn't change a thing and these cookies were AWESOME!!! I will be making these again!"
"3","5","Excellent recipe. Added some butterscotch chips to make it a little more interesting. :)"
"3","5","Very chocolatey. I made as written but substituted some of the chocolate chips with PB chips. I put the dough in mini muffin cups then when cooled topped with home made PB frosting."
"3","4","Great recipe, be careful not to over mix the dough as it will make the cookies too dry and crumbly."
"3","5","Really good, but could use some more chocolate chips!!"
"3","5","This is an outstanding recipe. Following other reviews, I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and because I used all butter, I chilled the dough for an hour. I also added dried cranberries, which is a great combination with the chocolate. Also, I was careful to underbake them (about 8 minutes) to keep them soft. After 3 days, the cookies remain soft, even the chocolate chips. If you happen to overbake an item, you can put it/them in a plastic bag and add a slice of bread. I usually place the bread on a piece of wax paper so it doesn't sit directly on the item. If it physically touches the item, the item will get very soft and a bit mushy. Thanks for the great recipe. Everyone loved them."
"3","5","OMG! These were wonderful! Added miniature marshmallows on top of each cookie. Yummy!"
"3","5","I made these as per the recipe once, and once using 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar. They come out soft either way, and we liked the batch with the brown sugar better. Either, way, delicious!"
"3","5","perfect!! really easy recipe with easy ingredients. I added m&m's to a third of the batter, reese's peanut butter chips to another third and chocolate chips to the rest. All of the variations turned out great!"
"3","5","These are chocolate truffle cookies...nothing less. Very rich, great flavor when they are just slightly warm. They are especially flavorful if you make them with half brown and half refined sugar (3/4 cup for both)."
"3","5","This was perfection!!!!! I would change nothing!!!! The only thing is the amount needs adjustment. I scaled the recipe to yield 72 and came out with 52. so those needing a certain amount should make the necessary adjustment to how ever many cookies they need."
"3","5","I replace some of the chocolate with white chocolate, and use pecans instead of walnuts... i've been asked for the recipe far too many times to count now"
"3","4","I only put in about 1 cup chocolate chips and put in one cup of peanuts, and put in 3/4cup brown sugar, 3/4cup white sugar, instead of just white sugar."
"3","5","Awesome!"
"3","5","Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I made these cookies exactly as the recipe states and they were perfect; soft, chewy and the ideal size. The recipe made exactly 48 cookies. (I used a cookie scoop for uniformity.) These cookies were such a hit with my family they only lasted two days in our house. I asked my husband how many cookies he had eaten and he told me that he had lost count after 30. I am going to make another batch today with one change. I am going to use half white chocolate chips and half semisweet. I think that the cookies will be more appealing visually. Thank you again!"
"3","5","I had a feeling these cookies would be good when I noticed the unusually high number of reviewers who consider themselves 'expert.' Such rave reviews from so many experienced cooks! I was not disappointed. I have made lots of cookies from this site and this is the first recipe I have written down and tucked away for future use. Even though the ingredient list is short (I even used store brand ingredients!) and the method is pretty basic, they came out perfectly round, they didn't spread, they retained their nice shape after cooling, and they're still nice and soft the next day. Just a perfectly wonderful cookie."
"3","5","Incredible! The only change I made was to put 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, baked for 8 minutes on a tin foil lined cookie sheet so they wouldn't stick. They came out of the oven looking very puffy, but quickly settled into the perfect cookie. Hours later, they are still wonderfully soft in the middle, with just a bit of crunch on the outside. I will definitely be making these again."
"3","5","SO DELICIOUS! 5 people asked me for this recipe the first time I made it."
"3","4","These cookies are quite good but a bit ordinary - I used finely ground almonds instead of flour, since I try to avoid flour and often get very good results with the ground almonds. I would NEVER use margarine as one rater substituted - any kind of vegetable oil that has been heated (whether in processing or in cooking) becomes hydrogenated and therefore a transfat. You are wreaking havoc on your bodies!!! Two oils that are safe to heat are coconut (buy organic virgin or extra virgin) and butter (preferably organic, but I know how expensive it is.) But PLEASE people, stop deluding yourselves with margarine!!! At least do it for the sake of your children."
"3","5","1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 dark choc chips and 1/2 white choc, baked for 8 minutes and they were all gone!!"
"3","5","11/1/11: I made these cookies again and added amaretto and dried cherries. They were delicious! So soft and rich and flavorful! I can't wait to make them again! I plan to add M&Ms next time and make another batch with the Andes Mint chips. I can't wait! This recipe is probably one of the best cookie recipes I've ever used!  These are really good! I will definitely make these cookies again. I used SR flour instead of AP flour, etc. and they turned out fine. I made mint chocolate chip cookies using about half a bag of mint chocolate chips and one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips...the mint flavor is not too strong. I used the large pampered chef scoop and baked the cookies for 13 minutes or so. I was really pleased with the creaminess and prettiness of the mixture before I added the cocoa. I may use brown sugar and leave out the cocoa just to see how regular chocolate chip cookies would turn out using this recipe as a base. Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","This is a really good recipe. I did not use walnuts or any nuts. Put an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla, pure vanilla never the substitute in this house! I also used whte/dark chocolate swirl chips. Highly recommend."
"3","1","I've made a lot of cookies, and these just didn't work! Wouldn't flatten on pan, stayed in a ball, and bottoms burnt. I modified with much better results by doubling eggs, and adding 1 tsp baking soda and cooked for 10 min instead of 8. And they flattened perfectly without burning."
"3","5","Perfect! Used margarine instead of butter and 1 tsp vanilla because that's all I had on hand. Baked for 10 minutes on insulated sheet. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and oh so chocolatey! Need a tall glass of milk with these ones. This one is definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","My choc-aholic boyfriend loved these. As I am not a huge chocolate fan, I thought they were very rich. But, they were easy to make, and had a good texture, very moist- almost brownie like. I will make again."
"3","4","Great cookies that stayed chewy even when left uncovered."
"3","5","I usually find chocolate chocolate chip recipes to be heavy and dense, but this recipe is not. Very yummy. For anyone who wants to make bars out of it, I made 1 1/2 times the recipe, used half shortening and half butter, spread the mixture in a jelly roll pan, and baked in a convection oven for 20 minutes. Less messing around than cookies."
"3","5","these cookies are fabulous!! I may never make plain chocolate chip cookies again. Seriously phenomenal cookies!   i didn't add the nuts though, in my opinion the ONLY thing that could make this recipe better is using mint chocolate chips. Adding the mint chocolate chips made this the best cookie I have ever eaten."
"3","4","this cookies are good but they werent cooked when we took them out of the oven you should cook it for more than 10 minutes and they were so sweet try putting less sugar and chocolate chips"
"3","5","These cookies were so yummy! I didn't change a thing with this recipe."
"3","5","Great recipe - my husband is overseas and these are his favorite! Tip for keeping cookies soft for shipping: put in a slice of white bread, seal container with packing tape."
"3","5","It's a shame there are not 6 stars available.These are totally fantastic cookies...I'm a bloke in England and like to try to bake things (much to the distress of my wife as I'm enthusiastic about the mixing but tend to be rather less than 100% on the tidying up).I used the reducer to make 20 and got 25 superb cookies although by the time they had cooled down I only had 22 and my wife was doing a good impression of a hampster and blaming Henry (our springer)for eating them !!!! Oh well,whatever. This was a fantastic,inexpensive and easy recipee (must be for me to make it!!!!)Congratulations to the author and many many thanks."
"3","5","I was looking for a chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe one day and selected this one after reading some reviews. I am so glad that I did! They are awesome and so easy to make! I kept them up on my screen until they were done in order to decide if they were worth keeping the recipe or not. Well, they were! I just made them for a second time in one week and had to become a member so that I could let everyone know that this recipe is totally worth making! As someone wrote before, be patient and wait for them to cool before you enjoy!"
"3","5","Of all the cookie recipes I've tried (and I've tried about 20), these BY FAR is my favorite! My husband's coworkers have tried all of them too, and they vote this one as the best. I like to use half white chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips. I also bake them for 11-12 minutes, or else they come out undercooked in the center. It helps to smush the dough balls down after dropping them on the baking sheet, too. Thanks for a super yummy recipe!"
"3","4","These were very good but not quite 5 star for my family. Very easy to make. My 10 year old made them with very little assistance. They are very, very rich, and do get crumbly quickly."
"3","5","This was soooooooo good!!!! I was looking for a cookie to make for my son's Christmas party at school and this is the winner. I did add 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Also used Nestle semi-sweet dark and white chocolate morsels and 1 cup of cocoa powder. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!!!"
"3","5","My kids loved these. I used M&Ms instead of chocolate chips. Will make again."
"3","5","WOW!!! Better than I expected! I followed the recipe exactly and believe me when I say that this is THE BEST chocolate chip cookie I've EVER had!!! Everyone raved about them! I definately recommend that you try this recipe!!! This is my new favorite cookie recipe and it can be your's too! :D"
"3","5","These cookies are great. I added 1/4 c brown sugar to make them more chewy."
"3","5","Came upon this recipe today while looking for another addition to my upcoming holiday baking list...I made two changes: used half light brown sugar in place of white, and didn't used nuts. This is a excellent recipe, not overpoweringly chocolately, just enough...they baked up crispy on the edges and tender inside, just like a cookie should be! I am definitely adding this to my holiday cookie list!"
"3","4","Yummy right out of the oven. These cookies go stale really fast. Great for about 24 hours after you make them."
"3","5","Delicous! The best cookies on this site. I followed the recipe exactly only without the nuts. Make sure you cook them for 8 mins, they will seem underbaked at first but will firm up & won't be dry. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
"3","3","Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT use splenda in this recipe. I used 1 cup splenda and 1.5 cups of white sugar, and the cookies turned out very bitter."
"3","5","I made these with big M&M's and they turned out excellent! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and baked for 11 minutes."
"3","5","This recipe was included in the chocolate lovers cookbook that allrecipes sent me for free when i bought the 'dinner tonight' cookbook. My husband actually baked these and although they tasted too chocolately right out of the oven ('cause the chips were melted and gooey) in my opinion these are best the next day when they are cooled down. I baked them for just 8 minutes, they looked undercooked but they'll end up nice and chewy. We used chopped pecans instead of walnuts."
"3","4","I have tried this several times, now with wht. choc. chips as well. I would say stick with semi-sweet choc. chips. Conclusions I have made-Definitely add another 1/4 C flour. Exchanging 1/2 C wht. sugar with brown is best. These cookies actually turned out better on my air bake pan then on my Pampered Chef baking stone. And add a piece of bread in with your cookies in an airtight container. The cookies draw the moisture out of the bread keeping them softer, fresher longer. This works with any cookie or pastry."
"3","3","These cookies are good but not exceptional. I've made them before following the exact directions and they were way too sweet. I gave them another shot and made them w/o the cocoa on another occassion and used half the amount of choc. chips and they still turned out OKAY."
"3","5","great flavor - I made these for some of the folks at my wifes work, next thing you know, she is getting complaints from people because they did not get any! I ended up making cookies 3 nights in a row to make enough! A very good cookie, easy to make, and well worth the time."
"3","5","Great, simple cookies. Don't over cook!"
"3","5","I could open a cookie store with this cookie! They are so good. I can't say enough. I did put 1 bag of semi sweet chips and 1 bag of white chocolate chips and they are awsome! I cooled them on a paper grocery bag because they are so soft, but cooled they stiffen up. Thank you, thank you !"
"3","4","Because of my boyfriend's egg allergy, I substituted 4 Tbsp water + 2 Tbsp vegetable oil + 4 tsp baking powder for the 2 eggs. The cookies still turned out great, though a little grainy, probably from the egg substitute. I also found 2 cups of chocolate chips to be far too much, especially since when the cookies were warm they were prone to fall apart because of the melting chocolate. Next time I make them I will use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 2. These are great, though I still prefer traditional chocolate chip cookies."
"3","1","I baked these cookies exactly as followed and they tasted like unsweetened cocoa! They also turned out with a 'cake like' consistency. I prefer crisp on the outside & soft in the middle. I won't bake these again."
"3","5","Excellent! Very moist, soft cookie. I made them exactly as the recipe states. I absolutely love these. They are very rich! My boys haven't tried them yet, but who cares, I will just keep them all for me! Thank you for a winner!"
"3","5","These are awesome. Soft and chewy,just the way my family likes them. I did use half dark brown sugar. I will make one change next time. I will use Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet. Since the batter uses unsweetened cocoa powder, the batter does not taste as sweet as a traditional cookie. I think the milk chocolate chips would improve the overall taste. Of course, this is a personal preference. Either way, I think you will enjoy this very tasty cookie. My teen daughter said this was definitely a keeper recipe."
"3","5","These are perfect for those times when you need a serious chocolate fix. They are easy to whip up. I made them without walnuts, and I made one batch into about 46 cookies (heaping tablespoons). If you make them this big, you'll need to bake them for about 12-14 minutes."
"3","5","These cookies are delicious! I made them without the nuts so my  2 year old son would be able to eat them and he loves them. Quick  and easy."
"3","5","I made these for an outdoor summer potluck picnic, and people just gobbled them up! This is the first time I've baked in a long while so I was surprised how well they turned out :). A suggestion: half a teaspoon makes good bitesized cookies."
"3","5","Very rich but good and not dried out like a lot of chocolate cookies."
"3","5","These are great! Soft and chewy and very chocolatey!"
"2","2","It was like eating cake; I didn't flatten my dough balls and they just poofed up and stayed there. Storing them in a glass cookie jar left sticky moisture residue on the inside which grossed me out, making me think they should've been refrigerated. 2 cups of chocolate chips is WAY too much on top of 1.5 c. of sugar and my head was dizzy after eating one, and I'd even reduced the chocolate chips to maybe 3/4 c., if that. My daughter liked them, comparing them to a brownie, but if I want a brownie, I want that crackled top and crispy corner, not an overly-sweet poofy cookie hybrid thing."
"2","5","Its perfect! no nuts needed :)"
"2","5","Absolutely freakin chocolatey deliciousness!!!"
"2","5","These turned out amazing!!! Used 1/2 brown sugar and made them about 1/4 C mounds so they would be nice and big and had to bake closer to 12 min. Definitely making more of these soon!"
"2","5","this recipe is awesome! love love love it!!! though i did reduce the amount of coco by a couple tablespoons, just based on some of the previous reviews. in the past my cookies have turned out flat (even when making sure not to over mix) but these turned out perfect and definitely NOT flat, which i loved!! Im glad to say i will never look for another chocolate chip cookie recipe ever again!"
"2","5","This is my go-to chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe."
"2","5","This is s great go to recipe. I substitute half off the butter for shortening and I leave out the nuts. My children love these. That are very easy to make and of course eat."
"2","4","Chewiest chocolate cookies I've ever tasted and my sister, an insanely picky eater, gave them thumbs up . I didn't have chocolate chips so I just added extra cocoa powder and some almond milk, which gave them a nuttier softer taste."
"2","5","These were incredible! I subbed butterscotch chips for chocolate, and wish I would have chilled the dough as a reviewer recommended, but they still turned out irresistible. This is going into the family recipe book. Thank you for a great recipe!"
"2","5","These are so amazingly good. I've made them with mint chips (delish!) and M&Ms (also wonderful). I freeze the dough in TBSP balls and then pop them still frozen in the 350 oven for 10 minutes. Great for surprise company or portion control (because it is actually possible to eat the whole batch in one night)."
"2","5","This basic chocolate dough recipe can make a ton of different cookies. Coconut, mint, caramel, well you have your own imagination. I love this recipe."
"2","3","These are so good, but a little goes a LONG way. These are almost too chocolate-y, even for this chocoholic! Husband and son both just had one and said no way on the rest."
"2","5","These hit the spot! Perfect for a chocolate craving. I halved the recipe and used slightly less sugar. I also goofed and used baking powder instead of baking soda, but they turned out lovely. I baked them on parchment paper so there were sticking issues. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for future use!"
"2","5","Made this recipe exactly as printed, except I halved it so that my chocoholic son and I wouldn't hurt ourselves...:) Fantastic!"
"2","5","I made these with two friends and everyone wanted some! We didn't use walnuts, and I wouldn't recommend them. Overall, these were delicious and totally non-hassle."
"2","5","We used white chocolate chips and they did not last long. Hubby requested I never make them again because he couldn't control himself!"
"2","4","Delicious! The only change I made was the use 1 t of vanilla and 1 t of almond extract... I do that with nearly everything I bake. I left them on the counter overnight (not on purpose, I fell asleep reading), and they were still deliciously soft this morning. Next time I might add just a little bit more cocoa, the cookie part could have had a little stronger chocolate flavor for me. Will definitely make again!"
"2","5","I have been making this recipe for years and it is great! They are rich and have great flavor."
"2","4","These cookies tasted delicious but came out very flat when I made them. I followed directions and read comments, but they came ou so flat it was kind of disappointing since obviously the appearance does matter too."
"2","5","very good cookie! used 1 c. semisweet + 1 c. white choc. chips. and no nuts. otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I chilled the dough for 20 min before shaping into 32 choc. balls :)"
"2","5","These cookies were great! I made them for my college age son who is a total chocoholic! This is now his very favorite cookie!!"
"2","1","I found the cookies to be very bland.... not very flavorful..."
"2","4","I followed the recipe closely. I did half brown and white sugar and left out the walnuts. These were good but cakey. I love chocolate cookies but its always hard to tell exactly when they are done because you can't see them brown. I will try these again and cook them less."
"2","5","Delicous, even the dough is sooo good. They were the perfect chocolatey dessert. I did change the recipe to 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 shortening. Also I added 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown. They were very chocolatey (not a bad thing) but I did cut back a little on the chocolate chips. They ended up being spectacular!!!"
"2","5","I have made these cookies several times with pecans and they are AWESOME!"
"2","5","These cookies were amazing!! Me and my family cannot stop eating them - they are very chocolaty and i cut back on the chocalate chips to 1 3/4 cups. Awesome cookies, and i will make them again!!"
"2","5","Added chocolate chips and mini m&ms. These cookies look pretty, taste great -- crispy on the outside, chewy inside.  In our oven, these needed 11 minutes to bake."
"2","3","I only rated these a 3 because, they are really cake like. They are like miniature cakes, instead of cookies. They taste good and look good, but honestly way to cake like. I don't know how this could of been avoided.. but I wish I knew before I cooked them, maybe if I give them a day they will dry out a bit, but way to cake like for me."
"2","5","I kept the recipe as-is, and I thought they were delicious and fudgy- exactly what I was looking for in a double chocolate chip cookie recipe! I was diligent about taking the cookies out after only 8 minutes. They do seem underdone at first, but I have a brownie recipe that is similar in terms of underbaking. Sometimes you just have to trust the chef!"
"2","4","I made these for my chocolate loving son. They were delicious. A little too chocolatey for my taste, but I wouldn't expect anything different based on the name. They were really easy to make."
"2","4","Mine comes out crumbly and doesn't go together. I increased the butter and it helped a bit. This tastes awesome though. Great with vanilla ice cream. :)"
"2","5","Sooooo yummy! Thank you for the recipe!"
"2","5","CHOCOLATE ADDICTS BEWARE!  If you're a true choc-a-holic (like me!) you do NOT want to make this recipe! One bite, and you're going to be going back to rehab!  Seriously, this is a VERY yummy chocolate chip cookie recipe. I omitted the walnuts (don't like 'em and didn't have 'em), but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. The cookies came out soft and chewy, and oh so good! I doubt this batch is going to last more than a day or two and there's only myself and my wife!  Thanks for sharing! DEFINITELY a keeper!"
"2","5","Amazing! I added just about a tablespoon of oil to the batter to help moisten it and make it easier to stir. The cookies were super moist and gooey! LOVE them!"
"2","5","Perfect!!   I used one cup chocolate chips, one cup butterscotch chips and no nuts.   I also added an extra 2 tbsp of flour to have a rounder cookie.   These are great!!!!"
"2","5","added the bigger, darker chocolate chips. These are like the best brownie, only in cookie form. Took them to work & everyone wants the recipe. BEST chocolate cookies I have ever eaten."
"2","5","best recipe, loved it!!!!"
"2","5","If you like chocolate like I like chocolate you will LOVE these."
"2","5","These are amazing! Soft and chocolately perfection. I chilled the dough for a few hours before I baked them, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. So very yummy."
"2","5","Great cookies for chocolate lovers like me!!! :)"
"2","5","Excellent! I just can't Jeep them around... They go to fast!"
"2","5","These cookies were great! I looked at the reviews and made sure to use half butter and half vegetable shortening. Then I added some pecans. While I was making them I added a little extra salt on accident (I made it a heaping 1/4 tsp, probably closer to 1/2 tsp) and it was a wonderful mistake. The salty-ness and the chocolate and pecans and chocolate chips went together very well. My husband and people at his work LOVED it! :)"
"2","4","Great chocolate cookie recipe - the texture is almost like a brownie. I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white, and i used dark chocolate chunks and dried cherries. Wish I made more."
"2","4","To scoop, I used a big ice cream scooper, and I baked for about 13 mins, and the inside was gooey and the chocolate was melting. Very rich, but great. Best cookies I ever made!! Made about 12 because each cookie was very big. Putting this one in my favorite!"
"2","5","I made these with whole wheat flour and I thought the dough was too dry, but the end result was a-ma-zing! Perfect, chewy, chocolate cookies."
"2","5","AWESOME COOKIES! I added coconut on top and used white chocolate chips instead! DELISH!"
"2","4","This recipe was pretty good! I substituted chocolate chips for white chocolate chips, and personally, I though it made it taste better - but the point it is I will totally make these again. :)"
"2","5","We love these, but we don't add the chocolate chips. We feel like there's already enough chocolate in there...delicious!"
"2","3","Very puffy and cakey. Good taste, but almost seems like more of a brownie."
"2","5","These cookies are really easy to make and are absolutely DELICIOUS! My cookies turned out a bit flat, but I baked them on a rainy Seattle day and next time I'll add a bit more flour. Yum!"
"2","4","Good very chocolatey cookie."
"2","3","Not a bad cookie,not one of my favorites,followed the recipe to a tee and they came out dry and broke to pieces with the chocolate chips still hard and the bottoms dark,kids will definitely love them,I'll try them again and hopefully they will turn out better next time!"
"2","5","I added more walnuts and vanilla"
"2","5","I just made three different types of cookies using three different recipes I found on this website and I had to make an account just to say how amazing these cookies turned out! I followed the recipe exactly and shared them with at least 8 friends by now, all agreeing that these cookies came out absolutely great. They are so soft and chewy. !I don't usually bake and the directions were easy to follow as well. I didn't change anything except I used white chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolate chips.Also this made over three dozen for me so I had plenty to share. This recipe was definitely the best one."
"2","5","The best cookies for a chocolate lover, I use the hersheys dark cocoa, it makes the cookies so dark and rich!!!"
"2","5","OMG these are so good!"
"2","5","Perfect Cookies!!!! This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Very fudgy!"
"2","5","So wonderfully moist they remind me of two-bite brownies. Substituted oil for butter and they still turned out wonderfully. I will need to try adding some coconut sometime."
"2","5","Excellent cookies! We loved them. I actually mixed 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup chocolate chips and they were awesome!"
"2","5","These were absolutely delicious. They tasted just like brownies.. Used 1 cup semisweet choc. chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips. I will definitely make these again!"
"2","5","wonderful and easy! They were a little chocolately/runny even after they sat on the cookie sheet for awhile so I stuck them in the fridge to cool them down before putting them in a container. These are great when craving a good piece of chocolate with coffee or wine."
"2","5","I am confident this recipe is spectacular as written. Of course, we all like to read reviews and put our own spin on things. I used half brown sugar, half white sugar. 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 1 t baking powder and 1 t baking soda. I used toasted pecans. I also added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, which gave a nice kick that starts about halfway through eating the cookie. It may have been a bit much for those who don't like spice and certainly not for children. However, my household and my neighbors thought they were amazing. Perhaps 1/2 t of cayenne would be perfect for those who like a little 'wow' but not too much."
"2","5","These are delicious!! I used white chocolate chips instead, half brown sugar half white sugar, and no nuts. So yummy and they stay nice and thick. I baked 6 huge 3.5' cookies for 16ish minutes and they look like huge bakery cookies! And the rest made 3 dozen regular cookies. I'll be making these again!"
"2","5","Wowsers, I have never seen a plate of cookies disappear so fast before! I found I made them too big and had to leave them in the over a bit longer. They were great! We made them without the nuts though."
"2","5","Awesome recipe. Followed the recipe with one minor adjustment I used one stick of butter and one stick of margarine. I also used ghirardelli semi sweet chips which made the cookies taste even richer. I will definitely use this recipe again."
"2","4","I substituted Sugar for Splenda, and also used 3/4 cups brown sugar, 3/4 cups Splenda, with no walnuts, came out fabulous!"
"2","4","I just made these for the first time and they came out great! I actually didn't use cocoa powder because I accidentally bought sweetened powder and was too lazy to go exchange it, but they were still delicious! My only complaint is that 2 cups of chocolate chips might be a little much, but you can never REALLY have too many chocolate chips, can you?"
"2","4","Very chocolately. I would give five stars but they were a tad dry."
"2","5","Good stuff!"
"2","5","So yummy!!! I have made this now with both peanut butter chips and another batch with mint chips, both times they turned out great!!"
"2","5","These are by far my new favorite cookie! So moist and chocolately, its almost like a brownie in a cookie! I didn't have any butter on hand, and so used margarine, so they are a little flatter than in the picture, but I usually use margarine in my cookie recipies anyway! I also didn't add any nuts (a few haters in my family) Otherwise followed recipie to a 'T' and I have not had any issues with crunchiness, a very chewy cookie"
"2","5","My chocoholic husband declares these to be awesome. I followed the tips in the comments (replaced sugar with 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar, replaced half of the butter with butter flavored shortening, cut vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp baking powder, and increased to 1 tsp. baking soda. I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips, and refrigerated the dough before baking. This one is a keeper."
"2","5","added 1 more cup of bitter sweet choco chips and 1 cup chopped almonds, superb."
"2","5","My family loved these. Great recipe!! The only change I made was I used half white sugar and half brown. Its preference really. Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!!"
"2","5","These were so yummy! Made them this morning in a rush for a Christmas party and they turned out great. Here are my changes: 1/2 c. apple sauce, 1/2 c. butter; 3/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. white; 1 t baking soda and 1 t. baking powder ; added a splash of milk after chilling dough; only 1 c. of chocolate chips is plenty for one serving (I used green and red M&Ms on a different batch for Christmas spirit and those turned out great too!). Solid recipe with the changes, thank you for a good bases!"
"2","5","The perfect cookie for any chocolate lover. They were hard to tell when they were finished baking because they're so dark, but I managed to get it right and they were delicious!"
"2","3","Made these to give away during the holidays. I didn't change anything except I left out the nuts. My cookies turned out really soft and more cakey than I prefer. I like cookies chewy / crunchy if that makes sense! The flavor is good but the texture is not my thing!"
"2","5","This recipe is absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was I put Andes Candies chips in them instead of chocolate chips to get that chocolate/mint flavor for the holidays! Great work and fabulously yummy."
"2","2","very sweet"
"2","5","i love these cookies. soo yummy and chocolatey! i followed the directions exactly since i'm just a beginner and they were the best cookies i've ever tasted. i did put them in a little bit longer in the oven (12 mins) because of the airbake sheets i have. and used parchment paper. using one bowl to mix everything was convenient and clean up was also a breeze. thanks for a delicious recipe. people will think i've been baking for years!"
"2","4","Followed recipe exactly, very good."
"2","5","Great cookies! I just made a few simply modifications and these cookies were a huge hit. I used about 1/4c more cocoa, used half butter and half butter crisco, used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 dark brown sugar, 2 tbs of fresh espresso instead of the vanilla, used 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder. 12 minutes was perfect for baking, let them cook on the cookie sheet For Christmas I dipped half of the cookies in almond bark and sprinkled them with festive sprinkles. Perfect addition to our cookie exchange this year! :)"
"2","5","Fantastic! Just made these with my kids and they came out perfectly. We followed the recipe with the exception of the chocolate chips. We did half semi and half white. They look great. Definitely a keeper."
"2","4","Great cookie. For my personal tastes I added twice the amount of walnuts and reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1-1/3 cups. Everyone loved them!"
"2","5","Perfect."
"2","5","My husband if a lover of chocolate and he absolutely loves these. I've made several cookie recipes off this site and he and his co-workers love these!"
"2","5","made these tonight I was just wanting chocolate... it's almost 1AM and hubby and I are loving them... I changed NOTHING... I think I might add more nuts next time but it's an AMAZING cookie!!!"
"2","5","OMG they are amazing!!! First time I tried this recipe and it turned out great. I did make some changes from another reviewer and used half shortening/ half butter and used half semi sweet/ half white chocolate chips. I rolled them into teaspoonfuls and made about 70 cookies. Can't stop eating them. Thanks for sharing!!"
"2","5","This cookie is WONDERFUL! Some chocolate cookie recipes call for melted chocolate to add to the dough, but this cookie tastes fabulous and I think a lot of that has to do with the flavor that the cocoa powder adds. I followed this recipe exactly, except for one small change! I used white chocolate chips in a batch and Ande's Mint pieces is another. I will always use this chocolate cookie as a basic recipe!"
"2","5","This is a great tasting cookie, just like a brownie with a cakelike consistency. I made no changes except for adding white chocolate chips. The batter was very wet and I was worried about it spreading too much, so I placed it in the freezer for about 30 min before using my small cookie scooper and they did not spread too flat at all. I will be using this recipe again. My kids really enjoyed it."
"2","5","Yum! Love this recipe. I used Hershey's milk chocolate mini kisses & Reese's peanut butter chips in lieu of semisweet chocolate chips, and they turned out great!!! Chocolate, chocolate, and peanut butter... So delicious..."
"2","4","These are quite fudgy. Very similar to a recipe I already have and they are just as good. Will make these again."
"2","5","Fabulous cookies. My family loves them! I've made a few modifications - used Hershey special dark chocolate so they're to die for rich, plus I use at least 1 cup whole wheat flour (or whole wheat spelt) and sometimes 2 cups. The cookies are so rich, no one can really tell that they're wholewheat! I've also cut back to 1/2 cup butter along with 1/8th to 1/4 cup coconut oil. This really gives a rich flavor but you will taste coconut if you do this. Anyway, fabulous cookies, thanks for sharing!!"
"2","1","I follwed the recipe exactly and they turned out too bitter. I feel like I wasted my time and ingredients making these cookies."
"2","5","Awesome!!!! A+"
"2","5","These cookies are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as is and they are great. Even my picky husband was eating the batter while I was baking them."
"2","5","My new favorite chocolate chip cookies. I was a little low on the chips, so I cut up some Hershey's milk chocolate bars to make up the difference. Delicious!"
"2","5","Very nice! Gone in a flash!"
"2","5","THE BEST COOKIES WE'VE EVER MADE or bought for that matter! So soft and perfect. These are our new favorites!!"
"2","5","Amazing and easy!!"
"2","5","Yum, Yum, Yummy! I used 1/2 brn and 1/2 white organic sugars, and half shortening and half butter. Next time I will try using all butter, cause I had to flatten these out with the bottom of a glass dipped in water. They hardly spread out at all in the oven. Chocolatey deliciousness!"
"2","5","Oh my geez- WOW! These cookies are so freaking good. My 7 yr old said they taste like brownies- and they do. I did the half butter and half butter shortening. I also did half white and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. They came out soft and gooey on the inside. No need for me to ever buy pre-made cookie dough again. Love!"
"2","5","After 1800+ reviews, another is probably pointless, but these were so good that I just had to chime in! I veganized these using Ener-G egg replacer and Earth Balance margarine, and I used whole wheat pastry flour and raw cacao powder in place of their respective counterparts. The results were fantastic - a crispy, chewy cookie that no one would ever guess was eggless. I will most definitely make these again!"
"2","5","I made the recipe as is only with white and dark chocolate chips and then chilled for about 30 minutes before baking. Wonderful cookies!! Everyone at work was also very pleased. :)"
"2","5","Delicious! I made these for culinary class and they were gone before the end of the period! XD they taste best if you mix white chocolate chips in with semi-sweet chip. :)"
"2","5","Excellent cookie. Very easy to whip up and didn't change a thing about the recipe. Omitted the nuts and didn't miss them."
"2","5","I just finished making this recipe, and it turned out fantastic. A most delicious and moist cookie!"
"2","5","This was EXACTLY what I was looking for in a chocolate cookie recipe!! Rich chocolate flavor, and moist and chewy texture. Didn't change a thing, they came out great. A great 'chocolate base' to add any type of chips/nuts/coconut...anything you like. Thanks for sharing...will definitely make these at Christmas. A new favorite!"
"2","5","A great, easy cookie recipe. Note that it makes 4 dozen. We have a small family so next time I may half it."
"2","5","Very good! and very addicting! We couldn't stop eating them...so very gooey and yummy. I recommend these."
"2","4","Just made these. They are wonderful, but I guess the only complaint I may have is that they are more like brownies than cookies. They are really, really rich! If you like chocolate these are for you! I followed the recipe as written and omitted the nuts because I didn't have any right now. Don't hesitate to make this scrumptious recipe!"
"2","5","tastes just like a brownie, in the shape of a cookie. very chocolatey indeed, we dropped the cookies by the tablespoon."
"2","4","Great cookies and very easy to make. A group of about 12 friends made them all disappear in about 15 minutes. If you cook them all at once, you'll need to leave them in the oven longer than 10 minutes."
"2","5","They ARE the best cookies! We used 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and replace 1/2 c of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour."
"2","4","delicious. my husband and I ate them up... and the batter was fun to lick! A little too cakey, but we still loved them ;)"
"2","5","These were so good! I used pecans instead of walnuts, because we have allergies to walnuts and peanuts. Otherwise made as stated and these are to die for! My kids are going to be so happy to eat these! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe."
"2","5","these cookies are amazing!!! i didnt have any eggs so i used a tbsp of cornstarch 3 tbsp of water, and they turned out great! i also put in way more chocolate chips than the recipe called for brcause im a chocoholic :) will definitely make again!"
"2","5","These are absolutely delightful! My kids love them! I was looking for a chocolate walnut cookie recipe and nothing caught my interest. Then I found this one and decided to keep the batter as is and substitute 2 cups chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips. I don't know how long I baked them for - I just waited till the tops weren't glossy anymore. I loved the mousse-like batter. I don't think I got 4 dozen cookies - I couldn't keep my fingers out of the batter! I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing for sharing your much loved recipe, Kathy!"
"2","5","These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (not adding the nuts) then my little boys and I ate them warm with vanilla icecream~yummy! I might have to try the white chocolate chips next time!"
"2","4","Not bad at all! Dough is very thick. Don't use Crisco in place of all the butter or you'll have a very dry cookie."
"2","5","Just baked them and they are delicious. 'The best cookie I have ever tasted' my 4 year old said and I absolutely agree with her."
"2","4","Nice flavor...chewy like a brownie. Added semi-sweet, milk, and white chocolate chips. Came out a little flat though. Will try combo butter and shortening next time."
"2","5","We LOVED these. They're almost brownie-like. So good and didn't change a thing except omitting the optional walnuts."
"2","5","Every one loved these, I make them with white chocolate chips but they are fantastic."
"2","5","WOW! These are great! I had a Cookie Making Party for some kids on summer break & this was one we made. Super good, gooey, and chocolatey. Rave reviews by everyone! I followed the recipe as listed and refrigerated the dough for about an hour and it will be a keeper!"
"2","5","These cookies are sooo good. Very chocolatey and delicious. I have to control myself when I make these because I could probably eat half the batch myself. That is how good they are. Highly recommended."
"2","4","Definitely yummy!!! It seemed like they were missing something so I topped a few with fronting. definitely perfect! I recommend the fronting for a chocolate overload!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great. I did not use half shortening or half brown sugar as many reviews advised and had no problem with the cookies flattening or getting stale quickly. In fact, I forgot to cover the cookies overnight and they were still soft the next morning. I did use 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to add a little contrast, but I think all semi-sweet would taste better. Trust the recipe as written!"
"2","5","Yummy. I rolled mine into balls before baking because I like a thicker cookie."
"2","5","I used half white sugar and half brown sugar as well as all whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. I also used some shortening, some butter, some oil and some margarine. Also I only had 1 egg so I used 1T of water and 1t of oil and 1t of baking soda and a piece of banana roughly and it worked out great! :)"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! My husband gave these 5 stars, I used Pecans instead of walnuts, had to cook them about 13 minutes"
"2","5","These were wonderful!!  After reading through some of the comments, I subbed 3/4 cup of brown sugar for half of the white...they were delish! My family gobbled them up.  Also--I only use real butter when baking, and the tip to chill the dough for one hour before baking worked wonders!! No more flat cookies--these turned out thick and fabulous!"
"2","5","I followed other reviewers' suggestions. I substituted some white sugar for brown sugar. Then to make sure they were going to stay soft and chewy, I added a box of vanilla pudding. Also, I used Guittard mint chips instead of chocolate chips and they tasted like Andes mints, but in cookie form. Great chocolate cookie base and the mint made it a wonderful combination."
"2","5","Amazingly chewy and VERY chocolatey"
"2","5","Ohmygod..I LOVED these cookies!!! I had a craving for something SUPER chocolaty, and this sure did the trick! I used half brown/half white sugar, 1/3 c regular cocoa powder and 1/3 hershey's special dark cocoa powder, and a bag of choc chunks. OMG these were so intensely chocolate and I LOVED them!! I will def be making these again and again :~)"
"2","5","So good! Made as written and the dough was very thick. I cooked one batch but ran out of time so I had to refrigerate the rest and cook it later. Both batches cooked the same with just another minute on the refrigerated batch. This recipe is a keeper!"
"2","5","A stellar cookie! I substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips (I think white chocolate chips would be awesome too!) and added a bit of coconut. Just eyeball it! Can't go wrong!"
"2","5","I must say, these are pretty delicious. I didn't use chocolate chips or walnuts, but instead opted to make white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies with this. They were amazing! I did make a few small changes. I used 3/4 c. white sugar and 3/4 c. packed brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 c. white sugar. Also, I baked mine on 375º for about 10 minutes (though I line my sheets so it takes a wee bit longer than normal). Thanks for sharing this....just what I was looking for."
"2","5","Yummy, yummy, yummy. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were absolutely delicious! A keeper for sure!!!"
"2","5","These cookies are excellent, but they should definitely come with a disclaimer:  **If you do not have mixing equipment, the batter is REALLY hard to stir!**  My arms are exhausted from stirring, even after I added almost a cup of milk. The milk (which the recipe did not call for) also contributed to my cookies being flat as pancakes instead of nice and chunky like in the picture. Bottom line- excellent cookies if you have mixing equipment or a really strong man!"
"2","5","Very good! I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. Also, I creamed the butter and sugar together first before adding the eggs and vanilla. Other than that, I followed exactly! Baked for about 9 mintues. Used white chocolate chips."
"2","5","by far, my favorite cookie recipe!"
"2","5","We loved them, just don't over bake"
"2","5","This recipie is amazing! I made these for friends at school and they loved them. I did the 1/2 and 1/2 sugar and brown sugar for it too. Fantastic!"
"2","5","I thought these seemed too simple, but they were really, really good. And easy, which is great!"
"2","5","I don't usually say this, but this recipe really is good enough to give more than 5 stars. I bake A LOT and I would say this is one of the best if not the best cookie recipe I've ever tried. I tried it with mint and chocolate chips which were our favorite. I also tried them with peanut butter chips (in my opinion, the only way to do this justice is to LOAD up on the peanut butter chips) and toffee bits. The cookie has the perfect texture when cooked at 8 minutes and then cooled for several more on the cookie sheet."
"2","5","These turned out so well! They were moist and a bit chewy and oh, so chocolatey. I froze them after cooking and they were also good, just not as chewy. Got lots of complements on them. Followed the recipe without any changes and it worked. Would definitely make again."
"2","4","nice and gooey, tasted good and easy to make. they did spread very thin though."
"2","5","All little bit of Chocolate Heaven! I modified this recipe in the following ways: I used 1 c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar, rolled the dough into balls, baked for 10 minutes to allow for the extra thickness and about 3 minutes after I pulled them out of the oven, I pressed a Hershey's Kiss into the tops of each one. Oh My Gosh!!! So good! So rich! So YUMMILICIOUS!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Kathy! I'm 100% positive I'll be making these cookies again and again and again! Great for sharing...I'm giving a batch to my mailman for Christmas!!"
"2","5","Very good cookie. Soft, chewy and chocolatey. I used dutch process cocoa, and split the sugar between white and brown. For Christmas, I dipped half the cookie in white chocolate and crushed peppermint. Overall..thumbs up."
"2","5","These cookies are amazing! I followed everyone's reviews and suggestions and I used... 1/2 cup Crisco (shortening) w/3 tablespoons water 1/2 cup Margarine 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar I also used 1/3 semi sweet chocolate chips, 1/3 Peanut butter chips and 1/3 milk chocolate chips. I refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes to make sure they didn't come out 'Flat' and they turned out PERFECT! If you love chocolate cookies this is the most delicious recipe to use!"
"2","5","Great and easy recipe! Didn't even use a mixer. Only advice is to chill them for 20-30mins before baking so to avoid flat cookies!"
"2","5","These were delish! My 15 yr old daughter made them and we loved them. We added a partial bag of Andes Mints pieces (hubby wouldn't stay out of the bag). They tasted similar to a 'Thin Mint' cookie."
"2","5","I've made several batches of these cookies and everyone absolutely loves them! To make them a little more festive for Christmas, I substituted red and green M&M's for the chocolate chips. My husband really likes how they're light and fluffy and I like how they're super chocolaty :)"
"2","5","These are the best cookies on the PLANET!!! I use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar.Also a tablespoon of water before I add white chocolate chips, 60% cocoa chips from Ghiradelli, and 3/4 cup of chopped macadamia nuts to help make the batter more moist. Oh and HALF THE BUTTER!!! My husband and father in law were blown away at how tasty these cookies were!!!"
"2","5","So yummy! Used half whole wheat half white flour. More walnuts, less choc chips. Wonderful;"
"2","5","These are ridiculously good. I wanted to replicate the cookies from subway and tried these with white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. These turned out a million times better than the ones at subway. Not only that, but they're so chocolatey I can't eat more than one or two at a time before my chocolate craving is satisfied for quite a while. I had to bake them for s few minutes extra, otherwise they'd be mushy in the middle, but that was no problem to adjust."
"2","5","These were delicious. I plan on making them for a girlfriend's b-day picnic. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with the cookies drying out, not even the day or two afterwards."
"2","5","Awesome! I'm going to make some ice cream and make ice cream sandwiches with these!"
"2","5","Heavenly."
"2","5","Very, very good cookies!! Two tips: First, make small cookies. These are rich chocolate cookies and they cook better if you do as the recipe says and make them “rounded teaspoon” size. Second, if you add nuts (I prefer pecans but walnuts also work) chop them finely and take a couple of minutes to roast them in a skillet over a low flame. Doing this intensifies the flavor and changes the comments from “Hey, are there nuts in these?” to “Wow, the nuts and chocolate really make a good combination!” After roasting spread them out and let them cool before adding to batter or you will melt the chocolate."
"2","5","Oh my, these are brownie cookies. I LOVE them and am trying to restrain myself from eating the entire batch!"
"2","4","do not over bake"
"2","4","These stayed wonderfully soft... but seemed to get a little dry after a few days, like all the homemade cookies I've ever made. I can't figure out what's different about this recipe that makes them stay so soft and chewy, but it's good! These are wonderful if warmed in the microwave for 5-7 seconds... makes the chocolate melt and the cookie even tastier."
"2","5","I made these with white chocolate chips and they were great! Just be careful not to overcook them, its difficult to tell when they're done because the dough is so dark."
"2","4","Need to chill the dough or else the cookies turn out pretty flat."
"2","5","If you love chocolate, you have to have this recipe. The cookies come out soft and chewy, and extra chocolately! LOVE IT!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! They came out so soft and chewy. I actually used 1/2 cup brown sugar (as other reviewers suggested) and 1/2 cup Splenda blend. Other than that...as is! Also, I baked these for exactly 8 minutes and they were perfect. Thank you..."
"2","5","These are THE MOST gorgeous chocolate chip cookies I have ever had in my life!! WOW wow wow!! The chocolate oozes out of them , its divine! 10 out of 10! I used 1 slab of dark chocolate though and 1 slab of nutty chocolate as opposed to choc chips. Magnifique!"
"2","5","OMG!!!!!!!!!!!! These cookies are the deliciousness things that were ever created on earth!!! haha they are so deliciously yummy! If you see this recipe you have to save it! I made these cookies and they were gone in less than 5 minutes! I can't stop even eating the cookie dough, its sooooo delicious even before it's made! It is your duty to create these cookies of awesome deliciousness! haha :D"
"2","5","LOVED THESE COOKIES!!! I did use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, but they turned out AWESOME, and I got rave reviews on them from everyone as well! Thanks for sharing!!"
"2","1","I have been baking for over 20 years and I did not care for this recipe."
"2","5","This was a great recipe but I did change it up a little bit. I was trying to duplicate some cookies I had about a year ago. I subed half the butter with butter shortening in a doubled batch. Instead of choc chips I used snack size packs of Reeses cups, snickers and milky way bars cut into chunks. They were awesome!"
"2","5","These are the best, after reading a few reviews I did make some changes, first split the sugar, instead of all white I did 3/4 c brown, 3/4 white, next I did 1/2 & 1/2 of butter and shortening, and used 1 c milk chocolate chips, 1 c white chocolate chips, once done, I used a med size scoop to form the cookies and put them on the cookie sheet, i chilled the whole pan and dough for about 1 hr while doing other things, then I baked them in the oven, they did not flatten out like some other people mentioned, it helps chilling the dough prior to baking. I'll be making these next christmas.. I only bake once a year and I go nuts when I do, these will be on the Christmas list for years to come. Thanks for sharing. Happy Baking!"
"2","5","I personally would have given these cookies a 4 because they were SO RICH..although the next day the flavors did blend a bit more. I gave them a 5 because I sent these into work with my hubby to share and they were a HUGE hit. I even got a phone call Thanking Me for these cookies...Be prepared to share this recipe!!!"
"2","3","Although this recipe was very chocolatey and I could tell it would be excellent if made as the recipe states...I am trying to bake a little healthier and replaced the sugar with granulated Splenda. The cookies didn't really spread/rise much and after they were cooled they were pretty dry, but still edible. I'll definitely try this one again with real sugar, I can tell the potential was there for this to be an excellent chocoholic's dream cookie!"
"2","5","Excellent!!! Soooo yummy and chocolatey. Will make these again and again."
"2","5","I use dark chocolate chips and they are to die for. Everyone always begs me to make these for them!!!"
"2","5","Wow...perfect cookie! You had better like chocolate to eat one of these! Chocolate truffle cake cookie is the perfect description...not too rich though."
"2","3","I thought this recipe was just ok. These cookies tasted more like very sweet, homemade brownies. I think I was expecting something less sweet. Also, they were kind of cake like - not what I really wanted from a cookie recipe. Not bad, just not what I wanted."
"2","5","This is the best homemade cookie recipe I've tried! I didn't change a thing and they turn out perfect every time. They're my entire family's current favorite and we've been making them weekly!"
"2","4","Delicious! I did half butter and half shortening. And half brown sugar, half white. The cookies stayed moist even the next day! To make sure your cookies don't flatten put the dough as well as the cookie sheet in the freezer for a few minutes prior to baking."
"2","5","Soooo good! I used half brown sugar half white sugar, and milk and white chocolate chips. They taste more like brownies, delicious fudgey brownies!"
"2","5","I have made these cookies many, many times and everyone always loves them. They are soft, oh-so-chocolatey and absolutely delicious. I do usually have one small adjustment to the recipe: I use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar. I found this makes the cookies even softer, and it's more in tradition with a chocolate chip cookie recipe. I have found, also, that you can substitue almond extract for vanilla (or a combination of the two) for a little variation on the flavor and it's still delicious. I'm going to go enjoy one of these babies now ;)"
"2","5","I have tried 3 or 4 different cookie recipes from this site, and none of them turned out good. This one is the BEST! I did halve the butter(not sure how it would've turned out otherwise) and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Also,you should underbake them a tad so they don't dry out. Next time I'm trying this recipe w/peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips!"
"2","5","very good. i left out the choc. chips and nuts and used andy's thin mint chips. simply devine."
"2","5","SO HERE'S THE DEAL: for years I've been looking for the perfect soft cookie recipe, and it's this recipe plus a fortunate accident! Halve the butter and you will have the loveliest soft cookies you could ever want!"
"2","4","These were delicious! Definitely a bit tricky with bake time - half of my cookies came out burned on the bottoms, half came out fine. Definitely watch them carefully while you're making them. However, they are well worth it! I definitely plan on making these again."
"2","5","I made these exactly as the recipe describes. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. These cookies are divine, full of flavor, with a perfect gooey inside and crisp outside."
"2","5","WOW! Followed others' advice and used 1/2 c butter & 1/2 c shortening, 1 c sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar. Also used semisweet chunks & bittersweet chips. Lisa's chocolate fix was totally cured after eating these :-) Thanks for the killer recipe!"
"2","4","I was craving chocolate and boy did this satisfy my craving!! These goes down with a good cup of milk. I followed the recipe as is and didnt find anything wrong with it. Thanks"
"2","5","Loved these cookies! Will definitely make again and again!"
"2","5","A-MAZ-ING! Straight from the oven it was like a gooey brownie. So delicious!"
"2","5","Made as recipe stated. Loved it. A slight crunch on the outside, but nice and soft inside. The flavor was very chocolaty."
"2","5","this is a great recipe the cookies were extra moist and very tasty. i loved them. The Best"
"2","5","My husband begs for these cookies. They're excellent for bribing him into helping with housework."
"2","5","I have been making this recipe often for over a year now and everyone loves them! I send them to work with my husband and they are always begging for more. Definately a keeper!"
"2","5","I made these two weeks ago and just now getting back up off the recliner to write about them. I was going to take them to my neighbors pancake supper, but found them to be so good that I ate them all in one sitting. I really would recommend these cookies for sure. Evelyn"
"2","5","Too good for words! These are the most chocolaty cookies ever! Substituted the nuts with mini morsels instead for extra decadence. Followed the rest of recipe as written. Used air bake cookie sheets and baked for exactly 10 minutes. Agree with earlier review that the cookies will look unbaked but don't let that fool you. Definitely let cool on the sheet for about 4 minutes before transfering to a rack and they will be perfect! My family devoured them."
"2","5","Whoa! If you are looking for a double chocolate experience, this is it! Just made these for my sweetie for Valentines Day. I know he's going to love them."
"2","5","Wow, simply amazing. Made it just like the recipe asked. Look forward to making again soon."
"2","5","I was a little skeptical about only cooking these cookies for 8-10 minutes. At about 10 minutes they still looked really soft but I took them out anyway to let them cool. After letting them cool, I tried one and I have to say these are the best cookies I have ever had! Ten minutes is perfect!"
"2","1","Did not turn out at all. I ended up with barely baked cookies after following the directions exactly. I had to increase the temperature 25 degrees and bake them for 11 minutes. They taste all right, but not worth the mess."
"2","5","these cookies are sooo yummy! I used Hershey's cocoa and Hershey's chocolate chips. MMMMMMM - where have you been all my life?!!!"
"2","5","By themselves, these were amazing. The second time I made them, I went a little nuts and added not only the semi-sweet chips, but some Peanut butter Chipits, chopped macademia nuts, and some all natural peanut butter. They weren't as fluffy, but I thought they were even tastier. These will be my contribution to the 10 or so guys here tomorrow for the Superbowl."
"2","5","This recipe is wonderful! The cookies are very, very rich and chocolatey, so it is hard to stop at just one! I skipped the nuts (my sister is allergic) and used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips; I stirred the remaining half cup of chips in towards the end of shaping. I do this because the last few cookies are usually short on chocolate! My family really liked these cookies, and I will make them again. Thanks for a yummy recipe!"
"2","5","Made with King Arthur Organic White Whole Wheat Flour, these cookies were fabulous. Even the most whole wheat phobic would never suspect that they were 100% whole wheat. I did make them slightly larger (I got 36 cookies out of this recipe) but found that they were perfect after 10 minutes in the oven. They look like they are not done, but will firm up and remain chewy and moist. I am looking forward to using other types of chips in this wonderful recipe."
"2","5","very easy recipe!!! came out great on my first time doing choc/choc chip cookies. delicious flavor, not overly sweet. if you bake for 8 min's, inside they keep the consistency of brownies, if you bake for 10 min's they get crunchier. i used organic/natural cane sugar and a little less vanilla extract (because i ran out), but they were still delicious... ALSO i made a few 'Spicy' ones by adding a little cayenne/cinnamon spice. they were great! so very versatile recipe too."
"2","5","they are sooooooo good!!! enjoy them!"
"2","4","These are very good. I omitted the walnuts and added a couple handfuls of dried cranberries for a tartness to go with the chocolate flavor. Yum!"
"2","5","Yum! Very rich cookies so you can't really eat more than one but that's okay with me! My batter looked really dry so I added a smidge of oil but they probably would've been fine without."
"2","5","HOLY COW! Great cookies, great taste, great consistency. I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for the recipe. It's definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","Revised review after doing the batch in full--great cookie! I tried halving the batter and for some reason the first batch came out dry. When I did the whole thing at once (and sent the cookies to hubby's office lol) they were fantastic. Adjusted add-ins to 1.5 c chocolate chips (kept walnuts the same) so I could add in .5 c dried cranberries. Really good contrast to the sweetness of the cookie."
"2","5","I love recipes that use ordinary ingredients to make extraordinary results and this is a perfect example of that. I love these and so does my family. Thanks!"
"2","5","These cookies turned out perfectly! Do not listed to that last review about flat as pancakes...if they turn out flat as pancakes it's b/c your baking soda is bad. Use baking soda that is not out of date and hasn't been opened and sitting in your fridge for more than a couple months and these will plump up perfectly! I used half brown sugar, half white sugar. Bake these! They're good!"
"2","5","Half and half white sugar and brown sugar, baked for 8 minutes! Perfection."
"2","5","These are so good!! I didn't change a thing and we were very impressed with how good they were. Will make again and again."
"2","5","These cookies turned out GREAT!   I made the dough with half butter, half margerine. Then, I wouldn't have to worry about the cookies spreading. I also used the miniature chocolate bars that I'd cut into bits in place of the chocolate chips, for a bigger chocolate flavor. When I was done with the dough, I covered it and stuck it in the fridge to firm up overnight.  When I made the cookies this morning, I stuck some extra chocolate chunks on top, for a prettier finish.   These are great for a choco-holic like my husband and really aren't difficult to throw together. They make for a pretty cookie. These would go quickly at a bake sale.  I'll have to remember this cookie recipe the next time I have PMS and need a chocolate fix."
"2","5","Wow! These are amazing! I made them with a friend, and the cookies were so delicious and chewy! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","4","Man, I thought I loved chocolate, but these were almost too much. Next time, I'll cut back on the chocolate chips and add more nuts, but that's a personal preference. These would be good with white chocolate, peanut butter or chocolate mint chips. I'm sure I'll make these again."
"2","4","Good cookie, great texture. I'd probably increase the salt next time to 1/2 tsp. Nice and chewy though, definitely satisfied my craving!"
"2","5","Wow! These are great! I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts because I like the flavor better but otherwise followed the recipe. Others are right - dough is very thick, thank goodness for kitchenaid stand mixers."
"2","4","These came out nicely. I would use a bit less cocoa next time."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly. Yes, the batter was thick as others said. But I used a handmixer and was able to mix it up just fine. Stirring in the chips was tough but worth it since the taste was fabulous! I had to bake these 10 min exactly."
"2","4","This recipe is pretty spectacular, but it was WAY too thick when I made it as per directions (which I followed to a T). I added a bit of vegetable oil until the consistency allowed me to mix in the chocolate & butterscotch chips and almond slivers I was using.  Other than that, they're amazing. Took me a bit longer, 10+ minutes to get them cooked.  Thanks so much! They have the best taste of any chocolate cookie I've made."
"2","5","The kids were begging to bake and this is the cookie they chose. I did, however, substitute the 1 and1/2 c sugar for 2 cups of splenda then sprinkled powdered sugar on top. They turned out wonderful! Thanks."
"2","5","These are the best chocolate/chocolate chip cookies ever! I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I used dark chocolate chips and no nuts. SOOOO GOOOD!!! I did find that my oven took longer than the 8 minutes though. It could be that I was using a scoop though, so the cookies were kind of ball like when I put them on the cookie sheet. I had them in the oven for about 10 minutes."
"2","5","These cookies are awsome, i did tweak the recipe a little though. I added a little extra cocoa, vanilla, and one egg. They came out lovely. My family loved them. So did all my friends. They asked for me to make a couple more batches!"
"2","5","These cookies were EXCELLENT! By the time I was done baking them half were already gone! So chewy, moist, crisp crust, JUST YUMMY!"
"2","5","These are absolutely wonderful cookies. Even better, you can freeze the balls in ice cube trays, and they will stay well in the freezer. To cook those, preheat oven to 350, put frozen cookies on tray, and bake for 10 minutes. They will be delicious: crisp on the outside, and melting goodness on the inside."
"2","5","these were to die for. i was making them as a gift for someone but ended up eating a bunch myself. i subbed out white sugar for brown and added an extra egg yolk. it makes for really chewy cookies. i also used margarine instead of butter and added white chips as well as regular semi-sweet. they were absolutely perfect."
"2","5","My husband and I really liked these cookies. I usually make Chocolate chip cookies, but once I saw this recipe, I had to try it. Let me just say, they didn't last long in our house! Haha!"
"2","5","Great cookies! I'm a novice at best, these are easy to make and delicious! I followed the directions exactly except added 1/2 cup more walnuts and baked them for 15 minutes. I guess each oven will vary with cooking times. Thanks for sharing this!"
"2","4","not what i was looking for, but really good... like light brownies. (we're six in a household, and i only made half the batch, everyone only had one mini cookie...)"
"2","5","WOW!!!!! I can;t think of much more that can be said for these, WOW!!! pretty much covers it Thanks for this recipe"
"2","5","This was awesome! I added peppermint chips (Ande's) instead of chocolate chips and they turned out great! Thanks for sharing!"
"2","5","These are sinfully delicious. I almost wish I hadn't made them because I've eaten almost all of them! My husband said they are the best cookies he's ever eaten. I used peanut butter and chocolate chips and halved the recipe with no problem. These will definitely be on our Christmas cookie list."
"2","5","These cookies are so good! I brought them to work, and everyone loved the soft and chewy texture.  I did make some alterations to the recipe. I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour. I also substituted 1/4 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar and 1/4 of the white sugar for Splenda."
"2","5","fantastic! we loved them thanks."
"2","5","This was awesome!!! My kids who LOVE chocolate couldn't get enough--neither could my husband. I did use half white sugar and half brown sugar and the cookies turned out perfect, tasting great even several days later."
"2","5","These are great and they freeze well. Thanks Kathy!"
"2","5","Out of all the chocolate cookie recipes on this site, this is the one to try! Made mine with butterscotch chips..."
"2","5","I think these are like brownies in cookie form. Absolutely delicious! The walnuts are a must. I made these for a party and the entire batch was almost devoured. The best part is that the few I took home stayed perfectly soft till the next day."
"2","5","Great Cookie!! I added 1/2 cup of coconut in the batter and iced the cookies with cream cheese icing. YUMMY! Will be making these again, and again. Thanks for the recipe....."
"2","5","So delicious and rich! These cookies disappear fast at parties. I use chocolate chunks and sometimes add Heath Bar bits. Lately I have been microwaving them and serving them with ice-cream on top. Yum!"
"2","5","I thought I had found the ultimate recipe from another recipe on this site...until I tried this one. WOW. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. My kids and husband couldn't get over how good it was. Can't say enough about them!!! Thank you!"
"2","5","To die for! I added a couple of tablespoons of instant coffee, in one batch, and threw blueberries into the next. Even though I generally lust after the darkest chocolate possible, I loveloveloved these with mini chocolate Kisses."
"2","3","I don't understand the 5-star reviews most users gave this cookie; they are not that good at all! The amount of sugar makes them sweet enough, but they really lack flavor! I didn't even enjoy eating the dough, and that's pretty much unheard of for me. The only flavor is from the chocolate chips...I doubt I'd make this cookie again, but if I did, I'd try something other than just cocoa powder. On top of that, I couldn't get the cooking time right...8 minutes they definitely were not done, 10 and they appeared done but wouldn't come off the cookie sheet without crumbling, 12 and they got a bit burnt. Of course, they are edible, but I think I'd be embarrassed to put them out saying I made them. Very attractive cookie, though."
"2","5","These came out wonderful. There was a rich chocolate flavor, and the cookies came out chewy and stayed chewy for quite a few days."
"2","4","Great cookies! I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. My butter was salted so next time I'll either reduce the added salt or omit it all together. I also used mint chocolate chips. SUPER YUMMY!. Maybe next time I'll try peanut butter chips."
"2","1","maybe i didn't do it right or somthing. I didn't care for this."
"2","4","I added a little more salt and substituted chocolate chip for Andes mint bits. They were good. Do not cook longer than 8 minutes or they coming too dry. Overall I good cookie though."
"2","5","What yum-alicious cookies! They are a bit sweet but I'm only blaming myself for overindulging on them (they were so good I couldn't stop myself from eating 4 of them). I followed the advice of previous posters and used 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar but did not up the cocoa as others had suggested. These cookies are definitely keepers."
"2","5","Yummy! I used milk chocolate chips since that was what I had at home. I added a bit of vanilla, and used half a cup of brown sugar instead the last half cup of white sugar. My husband loved them. I'm guessing they would be super with peanut butter chips as well!"
"2","5","This was a great cookie! I used the tip of using 1/2 cup brown sugar and reduce white sugar to 1 cup. They turned out great! They are a little richer than the traditional chocolate chip cookie, but my kids don't argue with me when I only give them 2! I will make these cookies often!"
"2","5","These were awesome!! My daughter would not stay away from them.She ate seven cookies as soon as I got them out of the oven. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. That was the only thing I changed. They were delicious!!!"
"2","5","This is a really good cookie and easy for kids to do"
"2","5","YUMMY!!! MMMMMM"
"2","4","For not being a big fan of Chocolate chocolate chip cookies, these are very good. They remained soft the next day which was a plus."
"2","3","I think the flavor was lacking a bit in these. Next time I would try using melted bittersweet chocolate instead of cocoa powder."
"2","5","I made these last night and they are awesome. I had some black cocoa powder that I had gotten from King Arthur and used 1/3 cup of that and 1/3 cup regular cocoa powder. I also used the swirled milk and white chocolate chips. These cookies didn't flatten out like most cookies that use butter and in fact I used a cookie scoop and then had to flatten them out with my fingers so they would bake better. I have a convection oven and lowering the temp 10 degrees and doing them for 9 minutes they came out crunchy on the edge and chewy in the center. These are definately a hit with chocoholics!"
"2","5","My husband is a chocolate chip cookie addict, but I prepared this batch and he was raving about them. You don't have to eat many cookies, it's a delicacy that you can fully enjoy in only one cookie."
"2","4","Ultimate chocolate satisfaction! Very nicely textured cookie -- soft & moist. My only complaint is that after a day or so, they become hard & crumbly. If they last that long, that is. My kids love to help me make these; they're very easy and tasty."
"2","3","These had a nice flavor, but for the life of me I could not get them to get done without burning! I followed the recipe exactly. I tried my regular oven, and my convection toaster oven. I tried making them smaller and flattening them a little before baking, but they went from gooey dough to burnt on the bottom in seconds. I wanted to give them to the neighbors as gifts but was too embarrassed. I will not make these again."
"2","5","Outstanding cookie! I don't usually even go for double chocolate cookies, but my husband requested them, so I went to Allrecipes.com and printed out the one w/ the highest ratings. Am I glad I did! (So are my husband and son! My son told me, 'Mom, you really are the best, and I'm not even saying it just to make you feel good.' Ha, ha, ha!) Anyway, as is my norm, I tweaked the recipe just a little...used 3/4 C. butter, replaced 1/2 of the granulated sugar w/ light brown sugar, increased the cocoa to 3/4 C., left out the walnuts, and accidentally added 1 C. Butterscotch Chips to the 2 C. milk chocolate. Excellent! I'll add this recipe to my 'cookie rotation'. Wow!"
"2","5","I just finished making this recipe and it is terrific. Very flavorful and chewey. I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I think is the fastest easiest chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever done. I used parchment paper and didn't burn a single cookie bottom."
"2","5","These cookies were great! I especially enjoyed them they next day."
"2","4","These were great - I used 1/2 c. brown, 1 c. white sugar as per other reviews and think next time, I'll do half and half. I'll also use a full cup of cocoa to up the chocolate 'shock' and use the nuts, which I left out this time. Great recipe!"
"2","5","Best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted...I can't imagine using any other recipe again. My 5 year old son, Max, agrees!!!!"
"2","5","As close to Mrs. Fields' version as I've found! I followed the recipe exactly and used dark dutch process cocoa. They turned out perfect! Just don't overcook them! Mine were small so were baking in 6-7 minutes."
"2","4","I WAS LOOKING FOR A CHOCOLATE COOKIE RECIPE THAT I COULD ADD PEANUT BUTTER CHIPS TO TO MAKE REESES PIECES COOKIES. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I PULLED UP . THE TEXTURE WAS NICE AND MOIST AND HAS A GOOD FLAVOR . WHAT I REALLY WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A MUCH RICHER CONSISTENCY . ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA ? I WAS THINKING OF TRYING EITHER A HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE SYRUP OR , MAYBE , EVEN AN ICE CREAM FUDGE TOPPING ."
"2","5","These cookies were very moist and delicious!! My family loved them. when I made them they were gone in about two hours and I had to make another batch! just loved them. For sure a keeper."
"2","5","Very good cookie! Not too sweet so you can enjoy many of them!! I will definately use this recipe all the time!"
"2","3","I tried these twice. The first time I followed the recipe and they came out way too dry, almost like cake or something (not good!). The second time I took the advice of some others and used 1cp of flour instead of 2. The cookies came out extremely moist and soft. I gave this 3 stars because they still weren't very sweet and required a lot of tweeking, including changing sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. I think I will look for another recipe and ditch this one."
"2","5","You know how I know this is a good recipe? I'm a college student and live with four other girls. The cookies lasted approximately 25 minutes. Lol, next time I'll have to double the recipe. I did as other suggested and used both brown and white sugar, and the cookies came out great! Thanks!"
"2","5","Fantastic! I made several batches of these during the holidays and they were gone in a flash. Definitely is a keeper. Be sure to decrease white sugar to 1 cup and add 1/2 cup of brown sugar as mentioned in several reviews...makes such a difference."
"2","5","The best double chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten!! Everybody loves these and I can't stop eating them!"
"2","5","YUMMY & oh so chocolatey!!!! I added white chips & semi sweet chips along with the new swirled chips for a little color. This recipe is most certainly a keeper."
"2","4","Not the best cookie ever but pretty good. I made them for my childrens daycare which is nut free so i left out the nuts, I also had to add about another 1/4 cup of flour. overall a great quick recipe that kids will love mine wanted one after the other till they were gone. i will be making these again thanks for the recipe."
"2","5","I made these for my nephews and they were a huge hit. I didn't have enough cocoa powder so I substituted with hot chocolate powder and they turned out great. I later made them with only cocoa powder and I thought they were a little too intense. Next time I'll stick with half cocoa powder and half hot chocolate powder. A definite keeper!"
"2","5","These were excellent! Chewy, with crunchy edges, light, super tasty.... I used Reese's Pieces instead of chips, which I highly recommend- they made the cookie even better (if possible)."
"2","5","This is a wonderful recipe...Baked them the first time today and my daughter loves them as much as I do! Great!"
"2","5","These are fantabulous! I did alter the recipe a bit though: I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar. I also added 1 bag of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips AND 1 bag of the Nestle Swirled chips (chocolate and caramel). They are gone as soon as I make them!!"
"2","5","Great recipe, easy and quick to make!"
"2","5","These were great! We all loved them. And they aren't even dificult to make(even thought since I didn't have any chocolate chips I had to cut a chocolate bar to pieces myself).  I didn't have cocoa powder or vanilla extract, so I used both nesquick and ovomaltine(both chocolate mixes with vanilla aroma to add to milk) and it worked well.  5 stars recipe - Thanks for sharing ^^"
"2","5","GOOOOOD. My husband took this to work and his crew love them they asked for more again.."
"2","1","I don't know what I did wrong but these cookies were way too flat and broke apart as soon as I took them off the pan. I used margerine instead of butter but otherwise I kept the recipe the same."
"2","2","This recipe needs a lot of help. It has too much butter, should have half white sugar/half brown sugar, needs more salt, and many less chocolate chips."
"2","5","AMAZING! They didnt last more then a night... My friends would keep wandering in to the kithchen pretending to need something inorder to sneak in another cookie!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I am making another batch tonight! Sweetbees daughter (who never bakes a thing!)"
"2","5","Using this recipe, I just made the most amazing cookies!! If you are looking for the perfect cookie recipe...look no furthur...this is IT!!! Thanks Kathy!"
"2","5","My husband and I have only been married a little over 9 months now. We had a long distance relationship for a while, and I used to send him cookies. He LOVED them, he said they were the best cookies he's ever had. Well, since finally being together, and getting married, I hadn't baked any mind-blowing cookies for him. Till I tried these ;-). He LOVED these sooo much! (How could I blame him! I think they're amazing too!) We'll definitely keep this recipe close at hand! They're absolutely delicious! :)"
"2","5","These cookies are awesome! Every time I make them, they are gone within a few days. I put some in the freezer to keep for later and they taste really good frozen. I make them all the time."
"2","5","These cookies were really good. I added a little less sugar, butter and flour than the recipe called for because I didn't have enough of them, and they still turned out great but I did notice other reviewers saying that they were chewy. Mine had a more cake like texture, with crispy outside. I prefer chewy so next time i guess I'll have to make sure that I have enough of everything but if you prefer crispier cookies, try adding less sugar, flour and butter. :) thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","Very easy to make! A great recipe for chocolate lovers! It's true that they are better the 1st day, but there will hardly be any left after the 1st day anyway. I will be making these again!"
"2","2","Extremely dry! Followed recipe to a T. Would not make again."
"2","5","I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I also used semi-sweet chocolate chunks(cut up semi-sweet baking bars). They are so good! I made them a couple weeks before Christmas and had to put them in the freezer so we'd have some left for when Christmas got here!"
"2","5","Scrummy!"
"2","5","Absolutely amazing....soft and chewy!"
"2","5","Excellent, even without nuts!"
"2","4","These are good, soft and somewhat cakey. The only change I made was instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I used 1 cup of semi-sweet chunks and 1 cup of white chocolate chunks. Overall, it is great. I am still looking for a less cake-like cookie that is more on the chewy side."
"2","5","My husband is the cookie maker in our family, and he made these for some friends of ours. Everyone was complimenting me, so I had to look up the recipe. These cookies are soft, and oh, so sinful. I don't like many cookies, but this recipe is a winner."
"2","5","I've been looking for a good chocolate chocolate chip recipe for years and this is the best! Loved them! Thanks!"
"2","5","I made these twice in a period of a week and both times the batch lasted a day. Everyone complimented them."
"1","5","Just made them and will make often .very easy and the batch is almost0gone already."
"1","5","I've made these cookies so many times, and they always turn out and are devoured. One thing I did, when my friend really wanted mint chocolate cookies for her birthday was just use mint chocolate chips instead, the were delicious!"
"1","5","I subbed a half cup brown sugar, and used half shortening half butter, but kept the rest according to recipe. Chilling the dough does help keep them from going flat. I got 3 and a half dozen out of a batch. The whole family loved them, Mom even called them decadent!"
"1","4","these were delicious. made 54 cookies. mine did not spread out. they stayed in the same shape"
"1","5","These cookies are so good! Expected them to be too chocolatey but they weren't. Excellent and make them often! My teenagers request them!"
"1","5","The perfect impromptu comfort food- I had a very bad day so I didn't want to leave the house to pick up any fancy ingredients, but I needed a chocolate fix. I found these and whipped them up (sans walnuts) and oh WOW! These little drops of heaven melt in your mouth, perfect flavour for a chocolate fan. I strongly advise sifting the cocoa powder/flour mixture- it wasn't in the directions but I did it anyways and the dough came out beautifully smooth. I didn't make any other changes to the recipe, but when I make these again, I'm thinking chopped up hazelnuts or unsweetened coconut shavings might go really nicely in place of the walnuts... (You can't go wrong with chocolate and hazelnuts)  These are so easy and the ingredients are so basic, these cookies are a must-try for any chocoholic."
"1","5","I reduced the original recipe by half and ended up with a dozen large cookies - perfect! I also used 3/4cup of raw sugar (not superfine) and 1/4 cup brown sugar. The sweetness is right in the middle, just enough and not too sweet. They also stayed soft the next day! Definitely adding this to the book!"
"1","5","The family loved these! And they were so easy to make which I loved!!"
"1","5","these were the best ever! chocolately in the middle, and perfect on the outside!!"
"1","5","My 4 year old charge and i made these one day. He said he could eat them all day long! Coming from a 4 year old that's quite a compliment! We didn't use two sticks of butter though. I'd say more like 1."
"1","5","I usually don't review on things.. But this was to great not to!! I did what many other reviewers suggested and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and also used half butter and half shortening. They turned out AMAZING- thick, soft, and chewy! Like a mini brownie! I used half semi-sweet chocolate chunks and half semi-sweet chocolate chips as well just to give it a more chocolate feel. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
"1","3","I thought the sugar was too much - should of listened to my instincts! Cut down to 1 cup and they will be great!"
"1","5","These cookies are delicious!"
"1","5","I was very skeptical about making these cookies based on the consistent complaints about the cookies not staying moist. I still made the cookies and followed the recipe. I added salt by just adding a pinch and mixing it in, tasted the batter to see if it needed more and just went by that(just made sure it didn't taste too much of salt).  The cookies came out super tasty and moist, the cookies weren't as moist on day three but most cookies won't. However, if you're looking for a tasty chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe then give this a try! I am going to probably make another batch today.haha"
"1","5","WOW. I love baking and chocolate chip cookies have always been my go-to. This is definitely my new go to cookie recipe!!  So chocolatey and delicious, they are by far the biggest temptation to me out of all the things i bake. Soft, rich, and not super fluffy but not flat, just right! The only thing i did differently was just to refrigerate the dough for an hour as another reviewer suggested. Wouldn't make a single change to the recipe otherwise, they're PERFECT. For further info, i didn't put in walnuts, didn't change the amount of sugar, and used the full cup of butter softened but not melted. I baked them for about 8 1/2 minutes so they would still be soft, and it turned out great that way. The perfect soft dark-chocolatey cookie. This is a winner!"
"1","5","If I have ever made a better cookie I can't remember when. They were so good I felt compelled to say it after 3000 others have already. I made no substitutions aside from one cup semi-sweet chips and 1 cup white chocolate because my daughter insisted they were too brown. Who can argue with a 4 year old, I mean, really who can?"
"1","5","This was a great recipe and it tasted great! one of the problems that I had was the fact that it was too dry, but I solved the problem by adding a little bit of milk and the problem was solved."
"1","4","This is a awesome recipe so easy anyone can do it even kids :)"
"1","5","These cookies are absolutely heaven. The only change I made was 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown. Even my daughter loves them and she's not a cookie person! I do put a piece of bread in with the cookies in an airtight container and they stayed soft and delicious until they were gone. Making them again tonight......thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
"1","4","this so hit the spot! i had been craving something sweet since yesterday and luckily found this.. i scaled the recipe down to 12 servings, worrying if i made the full yield i'd eat the entire thing in one sitting [i think i've eaten 4 or 5 so far!].. i used a full egg instead of 'half' and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.. this came out light and fluffy rather than dense and chewy or crispy.. i'm sure bf [who isn't much into sweets either] will enjoy these when he gets home [if there's any left ;) ].. ty for the recipe"
"1","5","I take this recipe, and double it.  Half gets Hershey's Special Dark powder, and the other half gets milk chocolate powder.  Into a container goes 2 chopped up bars of baking chocolate (I use 1 bar Baker's semi-sweet and 1 bar Baker's German), and up to 5 full 12 oz bags of chips. I mix my brands, as each brand adds a different flavor. Ghiradelli white vanilla chips give a nice counter note as well. Shake them up REALLY well. You should end up with 8 cups of chips.  Put half into each batch of dough. You'll want to mix in this many chips by hand, as most mixers can NOT handle something this dense, even when using dough hooks. Use a spatula you don't mind breaking if you don't want to hand mix. I have learned these lessons the hard way. :P  Spoon onto cookie sheets (I let them sit covered in the fridge for a day or so, but that's me), sprinkling each cookie with a pinch of cinnamon. Depending on the number of chips, you may have to bake a couple half-dozen test batches first. I start with 8 minutes, then work my way up to no more than 15. These cookies will go from done to burnt VERY quickly!  These end up being incredibly rich, incredibly chocolaty cookies that melt in your mouth. They've been described as more chip than cookie. Thank you, Kathy, for an excellent base recipe!"
"1","5","Perfect recipe! Dough will be stiff when all flour and cocoa are added - need lots of muscle to finish the mix. Refrigerate for an hour. Used a 2' cookie dough ball scoop - made perfect size for a holiday party."
"1","5","I didn't use any walnuts, and used 1 1/4 cups of dark chocolate chips and 1 1/4 white chocolate chips. I also did heaping two-tablespoons and increased the time to 13 minutes. I would also suggest the use of parchment paper, as they tend to fall apart when they have so many chips and are so large! The parchment allowed me to slide them off to cool completely (whilst on the parchment paper) on a wire rack. I sent them to work with the husband and his office gobbled them up!"
"1","5","This recipe was great! I subtracted half a cup of sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet and the cookies still tasted perfect. The cookies were a bit cakey and thick, even though I didn't refrigerate the dough."
"1","3","I thought the recipe was OK. Other reviewers suggested it was the perfect fix for a chocolate craving, but didn't do it for me. It was a nice idea, but the only difference between this and my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe is pretty much just the addition of cocoa powder. I thought it was a little overpowering in the cocoa department and had the powdery aftertaste. Wouldn't suggest for use as a chocolate craving fix."
"1","2","They were very cakey. They may be taste with some ice cream though."
"1","4","Made 56 small-ish cookies. Followed the changes suggested by user TIAAKE and other reviewers. They look really nice, but mine ended up being soft and not chewy at all. Not too sweet, which is nice."
"1","5","I was looking for a really good chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe, and wow! I found it! These cookies are fantastic! My kids Loved them, and said I was the best mom ever in the entire world lol, better than anything from the grocery store, and so delicious! they added. I followed the recipe to a T, and they came out perfect. Thank you for the recipe, I'll most definitely be making these cookies again:)"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe! I did what others suggested and used 1/2 shortening 1/2 real butter (no margarine in this house!) and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. So soft and chewy. Next time I will use different flavored chips, maybe mint chips for the holidays. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Added an extra 1/2-cup of chocolate chips. Made sure to beat the butter and sugar for about 4 minutes with a hand mixer so it was extra light and fluffy. Chilled the dough overnight for ease in scooping. Will definitely make again."
"1","5","these cookies are the best!! i used dark chocolates on my first try because i dont have semi sweet chocs and the outcome was super awesomeeee!"
"1","5","Yes,I love these!!! my GF thinks I am the worlds greatest baker :) So please dont tell her how easy these are ;) lol"
"1","5","We don't often make cookies at all. Or any kind of sweet. But I really wanted cookies... these turned out amazing. Mykids were able to help make them, which is always good. The dough was a little wet looking so we added about another quarter cup flour and a bit more cocao powder. Used Andes mint pieces instead of chocolate chips. They are chewy, soft, and full of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","We felt like eating choc choc chip cookies tonight and found this recipe with so many great reviews. Excellent recipe. Very rich chocolate flavor and chips add to the whole chocolate experience. I try to cut down on sugar so I used about 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I usually make my choc chip cookies with more chips than batter but in this case, I reduced the chips to 1 1/2 cups. Cookies turned out perfect for us. Melt in your mouth drops of chocolate. Next time,I might reduce sugar a little bit more though the salt might have to be nixed as well to balance. The chocolate flavor is more accented then and the chips really pop. Definitely a cookie recipe to keep. Thanks."
"1","5","AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","If you put baking powder in like I did and use half brown sugar with half white sugar, it makes for the PERFECT texture. Also, I found no need for chilling the dough before baking. The end product was fabulous."
"1","5","I make these cookies all the time my family loves them. We love walnuts so I use a full cup of largely chopped walnuts instead of a half a cup. I use organic & all natural ingredients like Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips & Valrhona cocoa powder. I follow this recipe exactly & the cookie dough has the thickest consistency I've ever seen. The cookies don't spread out too flat they stay a bit puffed up beautifully. When we want to change it up a bit I add 1/2 cup to a whole cup of dried cherries...mmmm so good. Love this recipe it will always be a staple in our house. Thanks for the great cookies."
"1","5","I loved the cookies they were really easy.forgot about a dance bake sale and I made the cookies at 10 pm. they were simple and took no thought! and they were really good some of the best cookies I have ever made."
"1","2","Nothing special . Had no cocoa powder , maybe that's why it was tasteless. Won't make them again."
"1","5","These cookies are a chocolate lovers dream come true! I wish I could give this 10 stars instead of just 5. They are so moist, creamy, and have a great texture to them. Followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out excellent. I'll have to watch out on how many I eat, because they're very addicting :) Will definitely be making this again."
"1","5","Omg! I made these cookies last night and they were awesome!!!! They were moist and very, very chocolaty. I followed the recipe exactly and the results were amazing. I highly recommend this recipe to chocolate lovers. I made 24 cookies and I only ate 2. The next morning I found 13 left!!!! My family attacked them! That's just how good they were. I saw some people put the cookie dough in the fridge to chill for a few hours to prevent the cookies from flattening out. Since I really wanted this"
"1","5","I made the recipe exactly as written and we couldn't get enough of them. They lasted about 5 days and were still soft by the 5th day in a sealed container. These were so chocolaty and good, whole family loved them."
"1","5","Amazing, didn't change anything and it turned out perfectly. So soft and chocolatey, my husband and daughter loved them."
"1","5","Just made these. Fantastic. I gave the recipe 5 stars. Perfect for the ever present chocolate cravings."
"1","5","Best recipe ever! This is a total keeper. I made them one night and my family ate about 20."
"1","5","These might be my new favorite! I even did it wrong, and they still turned out awesome!"
"1","5","YES! This is the BEST chocolatey chip cookie recipe that I have made! I did what other reviewers suggested and used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. The cookies puffed up a little bit AND stayed moist and chewy for the next day!   I used dutch-processed cocoa and I really think that the higher quality cocoa made all the difference in this cookie. I also used REAL PURE vanilla. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!   I immediately wrote this recipe in my personal recipe book and will use this for YEARS to come!  Thanks for this amazing recipe!  And thanks to Allrecipes.com for emailing me this recipe this week! What a wonderful way to try new recipes without doing a bunch of work to get there! :)"
"1","5","This is seriously the best cookie recipe I've tried!"
"1","5","Just made these and ey turned out sooo good! They are definitely for he chocoholic- very rich and gooey! Eat with a glass of milk! I loved how many cookies the recipe made. I would suggest doing VERY small balls, they will spread to just the right amount! After I separated out my balls I then cut them in half! Also, I refrigerated after they were in balls for 15 mins or so. Very glad I did. Delicious recipe! Definitely a keeper thank you so much!!"
"1","5","This was fantastic!"
"1","5","These were chocolatey and delicious. I used 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup white chocolate chips. My family loved them!"
"1","5","This is our favorite cookie! I like to add extra vanilla, and I use Ghirardelli chocolate chips with 60% cocoa content. Yum! Sometimes, we bake them for only 5-6 minutes on 375 so that they're a bit crisp on the outside but gooey on the inside."
"1","5","It's perfect, my whole family absolutely enjoys them, they don't last more than 15 minutes at my house, and the word 'leftovers' doesn't exist with this recipe. The one time that there WERE leftovers (5 cookies total, but only because I doubled the recipe), they stayed moist and tasted just as good the day after, but of course they always taste better having just come out of the oven ;)"
"1","5","To address some of the concerns noted below: I used to get flat cookies whether I used butter, margarine, or shortening. That changed when I started using a cookie scoop. Maybe it's because the heat from my hands doesn't transfer to the dough, or the cookie dough is nice and rounded so it spreads less.   With this batch, I used butter. I didn't chill the dough for the first half, I put the second half in the freezer for 10 minutes, and I used both light and dark cookie sheets and they all came out the same -- Perfect! I didn't change a thing from the recipe, and I did take them out just when set (as the recipe says). Although I thought they would be underdone, they were wonderful after cooling on the sheet for 2-3 minutes then being transferred to a wire rack to cool some more. I got lots of compliments."
"1","5","This recipe is perfect a written. Baked these for my family and they were hit! I chilled them for half an hour and they didn't flatten out (which is great). They stayed well formed. No changes needed to the recipe."
"1","4","I'm giving it four stars because when I made them as directed they came out very cakey and I didn't like them. However, when I used half brown sugar and half white and baked them at 375 for 10 minutes they came out like extra chocolatey chocolate chip cookies."
"1","4","Used only 1 cup of sugar (1/2 cup white, 1/2 brown) they are plenty sweet. As written, I feel like they would be too sweet. I used a bag of dark choco and mint chips. Also added a bit of peppermint extract. Used a bit less flour. They turned out really well!"
"1","5","I mixed it up a little to try and save some calories. I used 1 c. butter and 1/2 c. applesauce, used spelenda instead of sugar and 1 c. whole wheat flour with 1 c. unbleached flour. Cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips and I can call these healthy :) I baked two batches for 7 mins for 'mushy gushy' middles and 9 mins for cake like middles. Both were a hit in our house. And I can have two since they're sort of healthy!"
"1","5","So if you add 1/4 of milk and 1 tablespoon of shortening it makes a great Muffin recipe!!!!"
"1","5","All I can say is yum yum yummy"
"1","4","My family and I really liked this recipe. Everything went perfect! I had some unwanted peppermint extract left over from a past recipe, and wanted to use it up, so I replaced the 2 tsp. Vanilla with 2 tsp. Peppermint, and made some delicious mint chocolate cookies. Definate will make again."
"1","1","I think this all depends on the cocoa powder you use.... Use one that is more top shelf that you really enjoy."
"1","5","Satisfies a chocolate craving!! I substituted part of the sugar with Splenda and it was still perfect. -L"
"1","5","These cookies are really great! Please be sure to cream your butter and sugar well and use really good cocoa! Enjoy!"
"1","5","I just tried this for the first time and they turned out great, and taste even better. Not too sweet, just right!  Julie"
"1","5","These turned out top-notch! Followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing next time!"
"1","5","Loved it! I made these cookies and it was a hit! My family loved them they were so yummy!!"
"1","5","The BEST cookies!!!"
"1","5","These are super yummy. I added an extra ingredient to mine though. Peanut butter! I didn't have any walnuts so I just added the chocolate chips. Next time I'm going to add some strawberries. There are just so many possibilities with these cookies."
"1","5","YUM! Delicious! So chocolatey!"
"1","5","I wanted to share a modification to this recipe that turned out heavenly. I used 2 cups chocolate covered raisins from Bristol Farms instead of chocolate chips. And no nuts. It's what I had on hand. Wow! I loved the cookies and didn't want to share (but I did). Moist, chocolate rich cookies. I looked, and the ingredients on the chocolate covered raisins included chocolate liquor and chocolate butter. I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","With well over 2K reviews already, it isn't quite necessary for me to add my 2 cents, but I love these cookies SO much, it'd be wrong not show my support. Ok, so if you're looking for, not only an extraordinary Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, but a recipe for just a 'really, REALLY AMAZING cookie', this is it! I've made these twice now, and both times the only change I made was cutting the recipe in half, as I only needed a small amount of cookies each time. With some recipes, halving results in failure, but not this one. You can successfully make a 1/2 batch, and I'm sure it would double just as easily. Moving on, this is a super flexible recipe - use any type of chip you want: semi-sweet, milk or white chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch, mint, cinnamon, etc. Also, if nuts are your thing, these would be SO good with walnuts or pecans - with the chips, or by themselves. Dried berries - cranberries, cherries, blueberries, etc. - would also be yummo and my next batch will be white chocolate chip with dried cranberries & walnuts. Additionally, the consistency of this dough is a dream to work with. It's pretty stiff, so it scoops nicely, although I DO suggest flattening the dough a bit prior to baking and again once they are done, as they do not spread much. Finally, I use my 2 tsp. scoop and both times I have made these, I have found that the 1/2 batch yields 18 thumbprint-sized cookies. Overall, these really are the perfect cookies... Easy, consistent & DELISH!"
"1","2","found the cookies simply fell apart and did not have a great outstanding flavour....just your basic"
"1","5","These cookies are officially my new vice...my daughter dubbed them 'a bite of heaven in your mouth!!'. Only change I made was subbing chocolate extract for the vanilla & I left out the nuts (which were optional). Baked at 350 for 8 minutes, making 68 cookies out of this batch (we prefer small cookies for nibbling). I had to flatten mine slightly after pulling them out of the oven, as the cookies baked fairly high (I think it 's because I live at sea level & cookies generally cook so quickly they don't spread very much in my oven). BEWARE... These are highly addicting even if you don't generally have a sweet tooth. Thanks Kathy for this wonderful recipe...It is definitely going in the recipe book I am building for my kids. :-)"
"1","5","I had a note from family to not forget to write this recipe down and file with my best recipes. Circumstances resulted in a few changes that I believe made this recipe even better. I used two sizes of chocolate chips - the mini and regular - because it was what I had on hand. I also had to put the cookie dough in the fridge (about three hours)because I cleaned my oven which took longer than I anticipated. I used half Penzey's Cocoa and half Hershey's Dark (again that is what I had.) I used margarine instead of butter to accommodate a food allergy. I always, always swap the baking sheet locations half way through cooking time when using two sheets. Because the dough was chilled, I did not chill again after shaping, but I would do this just like the video to keep the nice puffy shape. There is a crunch on the outside and soft cookie inside - like a chocolate soufflé. The chocolate really pops."
"1","5","I used un sweeten cocoa powder and followed the recipe. They came out soooo good. Best chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have made."
"1","5","Very good made it for the family and they loved it"
"1","5","perfect exactly as is."
"1","5","Perfect Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookie!!!"
"1","5","The cookies turned out really nicely. I have to say I'm fairly new to baking but this was easy to follow understand and made a good 36 fair sized cookies. Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","Just the consistency and taste I was looking for, awesome!"
"1","5","My daughter asked if we could make chocolate chip cookies but all I had were peanut butter chips. So I went looking for a chocolate cookie recipe that I had the ingredients for and found this one. After reading some of the comments I made these changes. 1 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Then the dough wasn't thick enough so I added 1/3 cup more flour, and that did the trick. I left out the nuts and like I mentioned I only had peanut butter chips. Then I chilled it in the refrigerator for about half an hour, and baked them for 8 - 10 min. Let me tell ya... these are sooo good. I gave it 5 stars even though I changed it up a little."
"1","4","Very yummy! I made a few alterations since I really felt like adding 1/4tsp cayenne and an ounce of kahlua, which I'm pretty sure was a WONDERFUL idea, as it turns out. I also subbed brown sugar and whole wheat flour and almonds for walnuts and used dark ch. chips. The only thing I would do next time is reduce the amount of ch. chips since some cookies kind of fell apart out of the oven because of it..."
"1","5","These are AMAZING. Mine were nice and fluffy, but I did refrigerate the dough for an hour."
"1","2","My husband was craving choc. chip cookies and decided to have our son make them. He used light butter, and they turned out as flat as can be, and stuck to to the pan. We added more flour. We had a better texture. I suggest to anyone making this recipe, first make ONE cookie. If it turns out flat, then add flour. I think the light butter and margarines in general need more flour added to the recipes. If your looking for chocolate, then use Brookes Brownie, they are EXCELLENT, and we've never had any problems. They have the crunch and the moisture. We make them at least once a month, they are so good. In addition, we even tried them with white choc. chips, which gave them a different flavor. We won't be making these cookies again."
"1","5","Flawless. Used half butter, half shortening as well as half brown sugar, half regular sugar. They're like brownie cookies."
"1","5","Excellent! My grandaughter loves them. We bake them together every time she visits. We did not use the nuts and we used a whole bag of mini chocolate chips."
"1","5","These cookies are really good. Nice and chocolatey."
"1","5","Great with half white chocolate/half semi-sweet chocolate chips! Definitely add the walnuts."
"1","5","Excellent! Baked 10 min @ 350. Spray cookie sheets as they stick even to non-stick sheets. Remove from cookie sheet right away."
"1","5","SOFTEN your butter, don't melt it, and your cookies will be perfect. I used all butter, no margarine like some reviewers said. Melted butter does not make good cookies. Even half melted will mess up your dough. This is why some reviewers said it works better if it's put in the fridge... they melted it too much. If you don't take your butter out in time to soften just put a stick in the microwave for 2-3 seconds per side and it's perfect. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Be sure to press the brown sugar FIRMLY when measuring. Dough was very thick and I used a small scoop and then pushed down slightly so it wasn't just a ball. They don't expand much nor do they flatten like a pancake. Once again, that's a too soft/melted butter issue. WONDERFUL COOKIES. I used Ghiradelli (sp) cocoa powder. You want to make sure to use a good quality cocoa powder; it really makes a difference. Remember, take your BUTTER out of the fridge ahead of time and your baking will be perfect. Thanks for the wonderful recipe :-)"
"1","5","Yummy. Careful not to overtake as they will dry out. Not sure if this is the best recipe for this type of cookie, but pretty darn good."
"1","5","Very nice! So chocolate-y and good! Made small cookies and they were done in 8 minutes exactly, and the cookies were a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Ten minutes and they were slightly burnt. I think I will try again at a slightly lower temperature and longer time."
"1","5","Excellent! Easy, quick and delicious. Everyone who eats these says 'yum!'"
"1","5","I had some Andes Creme de Menthe Baking Chips that I needed to use so gave this recipe a try, a little on the rich side but delicious. I used 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar, 1 t of vanilla, 3/4 cup of chopped pecans and of course the baking chips in place of chocolate chips. The first batch I baked for 10 min, this was not enough so I baked the remaining batches for 12 minutes, perfect. I got a total of 73 cookies, using a cookie scoop (the one that is like an ice cream scoop)."
"1","4","Delicious! I made it with the chopped walnuts, and they were so good! I may play around with the butter content next time. I think I may try the half margerine/shortening next time. But, very pleased :-)"
"1","5","Family loved them, didn't change anything. 8 min in convection oven and came out perfect."
"1","5","These are amazing! Everyone who has tried them has asked for more. They are delicious!!"
"1","5","I have used this website for years without signing up for an account. Yet, I made an account today because these were maybe the best cookies I have EVER made (and I bake about once a week.) So soft, so chewy, so perfect.   The changes I made: used half brown, half white sugar, and instead of chocolate chips I used about half a bag of Heath toffee bits. Since I wanted it to have more of a toffee cookie flavor, I doubled the salt (which I tend to do in cookie recipes anyway since I love a salty/sweet flavor.)"
"1","5","These are awesome! I didn't have any walnuts, but I did have some pistachios so I added them. I think they melted into the cookies! I was concerned about how to tell when they were done since they don't really brown (too dark already!) I baked in a convection oven 3 batches at a time for 8 mins at 325, had one pan left so baked that an additional 2 minutes, can't tell which is which! The creaminess of the chocolate chips covers up any mistakes, and it's all chocolate, so it's all good! Definately a keeper!"
"1","5","These cookies are amazing! really soft and so easy, my boyfriend makes them and they're still delicious!"
"1","5","These are great cookies. I made these cookies before and I added in some white chocolate because I wanted to use up some leftovers. It was awesome. This last time I used a bag of Andes baking chips. Let me tell you these were the best cookies I have had in a long time. :)"
"1","5","Making these now and the first batch is delecious! Baked for exactly 8 mins at 350. Uses half cup butter/half cup butter-flavored Crisco. Used 3/4 C white sugar and 3/4 C lightly packed brown sugar. Used a 10 oz pkg of Andes mint baking pieces and about a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Will be making these again for Christmas! Thanks!"
"1","5","Delicious! 2nd best chocolate cookies i have ever ate. will definitely make again. I did make one alteration to the original recipe: I used half white/half brown sugar.Ill try using 2/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown since i like my cookies sweet. i used hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder."
"1","5","These were excellent! I only made one change: I used 1 cup of white sugar, plus a half cup of brown sugar. Delicious!"
"1","5","I've made these several times. Usually substitute a small amt brown sugar. Love these, they don't last long, very chocolately."
"1","1","I definitely didn't overmix, it's just so cakey."
"1","5","Awesome recipie, I added dark chocolate and mint chips and it came out amazing, also i found adding a 1/4 cup of milk caused the cookies to spread more and not be so clumped."
"1","5","This came out even more amazing than I had expected! My husband was raving about it! They are delicious, especially for my first time baking from scratch!"
"1","5","Very easy to make. Husband loved them. A teaspoon makes a very small cookie but lots of them. Don't overbake or they will be too crunchy but still good"
"1","5","even the cookie dough i couldn't stop eating! amazing :)"
"1","5","Super good! Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks so much!"
"1","5","I am always picky about my cookie recipes. I tryed this on and it came out peeeerrrrrrrfect. Used mint and chocolate chips. Very happy i know have a great chocolate cookie recipe. Thanks for this one"
"1","5","good too much chocolate for me"
"1","5","ABSOLUTELY AMAZING COOKIES! i've made these so many times and they're always wonderful. i make them with 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips. i also make them larger than the recipe says- i end up with about 24 cookies. i just bake them for 12 minutes or so and they turn out great. they stay soft for several days but do eventually get a little harder. when that happens, i just throw them in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and they taste almost like they're freshly baked."
"1","5","Amazing cookies. I am not very good at making cookies but these turned out perfect and they are perfect for a chocolate lover like me."
"1","5","So great! I froze some batter to have on hand, and my hubby eats the frozen batter in the chunk ful! YUM!"
"1","5","This was a really good recipe and we'll contineu to use it. Instead of all butter, I use half butter, half shortening. For a oreo-like taste, use hershey's special dark cocoa and white chocolate chips. I use a cookie scoop to form the cookies and in my oven, these baked for 9 minutes and produced a cookie that flattened more as it cooled and was crisp on the outside and chewy inside."
"1","5","These are delicious! I did as some other reviewers suggested, and replaced 1/2 C of the white sugar with brown sugar. These cookies are really tasty. They are crispy around the edges and soft and fudgy in the center. I baked for 8 minutes, and they are perfect :)"
"1","5","Awesome stuff! Instead of the walnuts try some white chocolate chips instead!"
"1","5","These cookies are AMAZING! I'm kinda loving the chocolate w/sea salt thing...so I did a batch with coarse sea salt sprinkled on top. YUM YUM YUM! My family devoured them. These are truly good enough to give as gifts."
"1","4","I had a whole bag of chocolate chips lying around and found this recipe. It was delicious. My sister who absolutely hates cake, cookies and the lot, tried one and said 'mm, these are good!' and helped herself to more. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","3","I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out flat. Not sure what I did wrong. any suggestions?"
"1","5","I had been craving a really good chocolate cookie and this was it! Texture was really good and I followed the recipe as stated. I did refrigerate for at least an hour before baking! Awesome!!!"
"1","5","These were exactly what I was looking for! I used 1 cup white sugar and replaced 1/2 cup with packed brown sugar. I also subbed 1/4 cup of the butter for shortnening. Cooked for 10 minutes on the top rack of a 350 oven. The end result was a moist, fudgy cookie that was full of chocolate flavor. Perfect! Definetly a keeper of a recipe!!!"
"1","5","Made these for Christmas using chocolate and mint chips...YUMMY! Pure cookie heaven! A keeper for sure."
"1","5","These are the best! I used white chocolate chips and chopped pecans and baked for 10 minutes. Yummy!"
"1","5","***** I used hersheys special dark cocoa and these cookies are delicious"
"1","5","A delicious recipe! Soooo chocolatey, just what I was after!"
"1","5","Really like this recipe. My husband can't stop munching this."
"1","5","Heavenly taste!!! I had made them the period I was on breastfeeding. These delicious cookies were the best company when I was awake these long and dark nights. Thank you!"
"1","5","Big hit with all the cookie monsters I know."
"1","4","I had no issues with hardness (in fact, I found that they crumbled easily.) I did use whole white wheat flour.  Delicious and packed with chocolate flavor!"
"1","5","These are everything I ever want when I want chocolate. AMAZING! I like to do half butter and half shortening."
"1","5","My boyfriend loved these!! So moist and very chocolatey...just the way we like them. A keeper for sure!"
"1","4","Love this recipe! Like others I used 3/4c white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I live a chewy gooey cookie so I also added 1pckg chocolate pudding mix.  This is a great base recipe for an amazing chocolatey cookie"
"1","5","Ok my 4 year old had surgery on her foot so I have been trying to keep her busy, she wanted to make some chocolate cookies Now I dont like chocolate but these cookies are the BEST cookies I have ever had and needless to say the kids all love them.... Thank you so much."
"1","5","Yummy! I substituted 1/2 the butter for butter-flavored Crisco. At Christmastime, Andes Creme de Menthe chips are available, so I made this recipe with 1 cup Andes and 1 cup white morsels. They were a hit!"
"1","5","This recipe is simply amazing. I love making this recipe for my family, the cookies never last more than a day!"
"1","5","awesome!!! i followed the recipe exactly but no nuts, and put a few white snowflake sprinkles on top before baking to make them 'Holiday Cookies' and they look so cute! THANK YOU for the recipe!"
"1","5","I loved these cookies!! Imade them a few days b4 Christmas and my family loved them great cookies and suiper easy to make."
"1","5","very tasty yummy easy to make cookies! Made it exactly as is!"
"1","5","This recipe is very good and easy to make. Instead of chocolate chips though I used andes mint chips. Thet are great"
"1","4","These were very good, not great. I didn't include the walnuts and used half regular sugar and substituted with half brown sugar. My fiancee really liked them but I think there were too many chocolate chips."
"1","5","This cookies are soooooo.......good. Excellent. Easy to make. Kind of like a brownie cookie."
"1","5","Great recipe! These cookies are very soft and delicious. I used reeses peanut butter chips. Mmmm! :D"
"1","5","Holy Cow! These are amazing! I did 1 c. Choc chips and 1 c. crushed Andes Mints. Now, I can't stop eating them!"
"1","5","I use Andes mint chip instead of chocolate chips. Everyone loves them."
"1","5","These were soooo good. I have to confess something because this little mistake actually turned out delicious. I was just not with it the first time I baked these, I guess.. I put baking powder instead of baking soda. They ended up turning out like a homemade version of those brownie bites. Yummy!"
"1","5","I never do the full amount of butter in a cookie recipe (I did a half cup instead of a full cup) and they always turn out tasting delicious. In this recipe I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar to keep them moist, and substituted 1tsp soda to help with the rise (brown sugar and extra chips!) This time I added creme de mint baking chips for the Christmas holiday. They turned out great!"
"1","5","Amazing cookies! I followed the recipe exactly (added chopped pecans instead of walnuts) and they turned out perfect. Made 3 dozen as I made big cookies and only baked for about 7 minutes which made them soft and chewy. Family loved them, will make again."
"1","2","I have made these cookies twice, and both times the cookies were completely flat and seemed to be missing something. I tried refrigeration of the dough, which also didn't work. Finally I began adding extra flour in small increments and eventually they turned out looking closer to the picture. Can't seem to figure out what I did wrong. Twice!"
"1","1","I followed the recipe and my cookies came out flat and fritter like. :("
"1","5","Very yummy! I used half butter/shortening and half white/brown sugar. Also I added 1 tsp cinnamon. Again very yummy!"
"1","5","Delicious! I made mine exactly as it is written except for I used white chocolate chips and left out the nuts. It only made 3 dozen for me. I used a medium cookie scooper. I didn't refrigerate the dough and my cookies are nice and thick! I cooked mine for 9 minutes and they still weren't completely done in the center but the guys at my house LOVE cookies a bit undercooked. I will keep this recipe in my cookbook! Definitely a great recipe!"
"1","4","Wonderful!"
"1","5","GREAT cookie!!!!!!!! Love the easy recipe!"
"1","5","I'm not known for my baking, but I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of substituting 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of chocolate chips with butterscotch chips, and the result is fantastic! Just made them, and when others taste them, maybe I WILL be known for my baking!"
"1","5","Delicious cookies! I used 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c white sugar instead of 1 1/2 c of all white sugar. They came out GREAT!"
"1","5","I've made these cookies countless times and everyone loves them! They are gone within the day of baking them ;)"
"1","5","One word: 'YUM!'   I followed the recipe exactly as shown, and they tasted delicious.   One thing that really amazed me is how long it could stay moist! The cookies were soft for about a good 4-5 days after baking.  I just love the size of these cookies too!--It's just the right size to eat. Not too small that you'll have to share it with another person, and not too small either. BITE SIZE! Some suggestions: I added some extra walnuts in and it turned out great. I really love the nut taste. The cookie may have turned out too chocolate-ey. I dont how to avoid the overly chocolate taste...perhaps less cocoa powder or less chocolate chips? Anyways, the chocolate was a LITTLE overwhelming, but can probably be fixed.   Overall, I would give it five stars. Easy to make and fun to eat!"
"1","5","These were very good. If you have a chocolate craving these are for you. I accidently put in a little bit too much sugar but you couldn't tell. Yummy!"
"1","5","Amazing!!! So chocolatey and good!! Everyone who has had these love them."
"1","5","Phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal!! Thx. These are one of my fam favs"
"1","5","WOW! This is the first review Iim writing, and I have used lots of online recipes.. this one is fantastic! I used salted butter and omitted the salt, and did the half white, half brown sugar deal (just used to doing it that way, and we know everything is better with butter!). Wow! rich, melty, chewy, good!"
"1","5","These chocolate cookies are awesome! I have been looking for a long time for a chocolate cookie that doesn't get completely flat and spread a whole lot when baked, and I finally found it! Great chocolate flavor, but isn't too sweet. I will be trying this cookie in numerous ways, with peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips, etc. Great recipe, Kathy, thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","These are awesome cookies. I added a box of chocolate pudding mix for extra chewyness (but it made the batter very dry) and used dried cherries instead of nuts. OM NOM NOM!!"
"1","5","Very good cookies. They are not overly sweet."
"1","5","Very rich and chocolatey! I used mini-chocolate chips and will try regular ones next time. This is going to be my go-to chocolate cookie base. I plan to try adding all sorts of goodies into it (dried fruit, different nuts, marshmallows, peanut butter something, etc.)"
"1","5","Super yummy cookies, made per directions first time and had to make them again as soon as they were gone. Second time left out chocolate chips, added 2 cups of oats and only one cup of flour. Super great that way too. Will make these many times I am sure."
"1","4","I used agave instead of sugar and two table spoons of coconut oil (to reduce the bitterness of the agave). I also added 2/3 cup more flour, but this made them more like small cakes. (I'd probably only do 1/3 cup extra flour next time) They tasted great and were sugar free this way."
"1","5","Got more compliments on these than any cookies I've ever made for a potluck! I made these in advance, rolled the whole batch into balls and put them in the freezer; then the morning of, I thawed for a few min, flattened, and baked them -- but increased it to 400 for about 12 min."
"1","5","These are THE BEST cookies ever... I don't even know how many times I've made them. Sometimes you just get a crazy chocolate craving, and these are my go-to fix. MMMMMM!"
"1","5","This cookies are dangerous! Way to GOOD! I couldn't help but sprinkle them with powered sugar! Excellent cookies for a Holiday Cookie Exchange! I will caution you...every time I walk through the kitchen I can't help but eat one!!!! They are a Winner!"
"1","5","Awesome...they were gone quick! tY"
"1","5","These cookies are absolutely delicious. Great flavour, I made quarter of the recipe and wish i had made much more."
"1","5","I had a hard time figuring out how long the cookies needed to cook but once I figured that out - the cookies didn't last long!!"
"1","3","I followed directions exactly. The batter is to runny"
"1","5","I would put more stars if I could! These cookies are AMAZING!! I want to eat the entire batch!! I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of canola oil and also added mini marshmallows. My new favorite cookies!"
"1","5","Dear Kathy, Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I made choclate chip cookies for the first time in my life and it was described as the best cookies ever!!"
"1","5","While I am a completer chocoholic (everything is better with chocolate) I have never really had a chocolate chocolate chip cookie that I really liked. This recipe is awesome. These cookies are delicious."
"1","5","I didn't have any butter so I used half margarine and half golden shortening, sort of following along with other reviewers. Plus I used half white and half brown sugar because I once read that the brown sugar makes for a chewier cookie. As I was adding the sugar I was worried that they me be ultra sweet but they are quite chocolatey and not as sweet as you would think. I wonder what would happen if I reduced the sugar in an attempt to get an even more rich chocolate flavor? Any suggestions?"
"1","4","Good, but a little sweet for me, and i only added 1c of chocoloate chips. Next time i'll reduce the sugar and increase nuts."
"1","5","cookies were great! the only thing I did was remove the salt.(there is enough salt taste in the baking soda) other than that change, this recipe was GREAT."
"1","5","Perfect cookies."
"1","5","YUM! Had 'em with a tall glass of milk...just perfect! Thank you."
"1","5","These cookies are delicious. I switched mine up by using 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 cup white chocolate chips. The walnuts make these cookies out of this world! I did have to adjust the cooking time though. My oven usually runs hot, but 8-10 mins didn't cut it. I had to bake them for closer to 15 mins. Also could be because I used a small cookie scoop and they were thick to start with so took a little longer to cook."
"1","5","Excellent cookie. I used dark chocolate chips and almonds."
"1","5","Yum.....tasted like a brownie. Whole family was a fan!"
"1","5","Best cookies ever! Get lots of compliments. Just the right amount of sweet in every bite!"
"1","5","Great cookie! We split the sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Added white chocolate chips also. Turned out perfect!"
"1","5","these cookies are PERFECT! As a chocolate lover i give them 5 stars!"
"1","5","I have made this cookies many times and they are outrageous! I have used all butter and then half butter and half shortening. Definitely use half and half! So much better and the batter is so easy to work with. Many compliments on these cookies...great recipe!"
"1","5","These cookies are so good!!! VERY chocolaty. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips as I read that 2 was too much for a lot of people.... And trust me it is enough. I made 24 big cookies as I didnt realize it was for 48. I also followed a few reviewers when they said to chill the dough. I threw the cookie pan with the dough on it in the freezer for 10 minutes. The cookies were not flat at all. I cant wait to make these again with other things thrown in. :) Enjoy!"
"1","4","Good. Not as fudgey as I like, but good. Don't over bake! 8 minutes is enough or you will get a drier cookie."
"1","5","These are the best! I took two batches of these cookies to school for an end of the year treat on only recieved outstanding feedback. Several people helped themselves to 5 or 9 cookies each (and one of them was diabetic)! No alterations needed for this recipe."
"1","5","This recipe is on the back of the Hershey's white chocolate chip bag. My husband said that they were probably the best cookies he's ever eaten. Very moist and soft and delicious."
"1","5","Yum yum yum! I made no changes to the recipe and they are delicious! Had to cook a bit longer due to high humidity. After they cooled I made cookie sandwiches by spreading a layer of Jet Puff marshmallow in between two cookies. So good!"
"1","5","Wow, these are soo good! We can't eat dairy so substituted coconut oil instead of butter, and we also use brown sugar and whole wheat flour. So delicious and perfect texture. There are only four of us so I only made a dozen and then dropped the rest on cookie sheets in balls and froze them, then once frozen put them in a ziploc baggie. These cook really well from frozen too and it's nice to be able to just pull out half a dozen whenever we have a chocolate craving and throw them in the oven."
"1","5","Followed this recipe as is, and the cookies turned out SO good!! If you're a chocolate lover, then you'll love these cookies. I ate two after they had cooled down, and I wanted to eat more, but had the willpower to stop. I halved the recipe, but it still ended up making more than 3 dozen. I guess if you use tablespoonfuls rather than teaspoonfuls than it might've been closer to being two dozen. I also ended up baking them for the full ten minutes. I was afraid they might've been overcooked, but they were still nice and chewy! I didn't add the walnuts, and I used Hershey's special dark chocolate chip cookies. Oh yeah - make sure you have a glass of milk nearby!"
"1","5","These were delicious! I just made them and made a few changes but they were excellent! I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and used wheat flour instead of all purpose and they are a little crispy on the outside and filled with melted chocolatey goodness on the inside. Definitely recommend!"
"1","5","Delicious...but greasy! I might sub some applesauce for some of the butter next time."
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! This totally satisfied my daughter's and my craving for chocolate - YUMMY!!!!"
"1","5","Fantastic!! I omitted the walnuts and used white chocolate chips instead. They look great & taste great!"
"1","5","This was delicous and popular with the whole family. Easy to make. Highly recommend it."
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! Would not change a thing!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness, my taste buds just went crazy! These cookies are a buttery, chocolately HEAVEN! Rich and decadent, the amount of butter is a necessary step in my opinion. They are not too sweet, but due to how heavy they are I definitely recommend making small size cookies so as not to overeat and make yourself feel much too full. Definitely one of my favorite cookie recipes EVER! EDIT: To make them less bitter, more sweet, and much more rich (perfect for those chocolate loving sweet tooths!) I would use 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and also I would use 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips with 1 cup milk chocolate chips."
"1","5","Best cookies I've ever had, period. And not just cause I made them lol I was seriously surprised at the amazing outcome of these cookies, mostly because I am not the best or most knowledgeable cook on earth, but these turned out AMAZING. Make them. Now."
"1","5","These are FABULOUS. I used 1/2c butter 1/2c shortening as well as dark chocolate cocoa. The batter is like mortar but they bake and cool perfectly. One of my new favorites!"
"1","5","I love this recipe and so do my kids!! I wouldn't change a thing!!"
"1","5","Ok I have to say this is probably the best cookie i have ever made!!! i will be posting a pic soon. I will be making these again"
"1","5","I did half solid shortening + half melted margarine (whipped). It turned out perfectly!"
"1","5","So good and so chocolatey! I can't wait to take these to church tomorrow!"
"1","5","Hard to stir in the chocolate chips, I used my hands ; ) but worth the effort. We used a mixture of milk and semisweet chips."
"1","4","These cookies turned out great! Although we forgot the butter until the very end - and because of this thought the consistency was too dry so added an egg, things got messy - just adhere to the recipe and all will be good.  a big thanks to momma for finding this for us!!!  love"
"1","5","These cookies, once I had gone out and replenished my ingredients, were SO easy to make! I don't bake very often, and I usually have help, but I made these from scratch with no help whatsoever and they were DELICIOUS!  Since I'm allergic to milk, I used milk-free butter and semi-sweet dark chocolate Ghiradelli chocolate chips and everyone I shared them with said they were scrumptious. Even two days later they were still gooey and chocolately.  Also, from my experience this recipe and ingredients list made about 60 cookies, not just 48--and I used larger dollops. Enjoy!"
"1","5","This is a delicious and easy chocolate cookie recipe. We make these for almost every get together and there are never any leftovers! One of the most amazing cookie recipes we've tried!"
"1","5","These cookies are awesome! I've made them several times. I sometimes do half white chocolate chips and half semi-sweet. I've also added M&Ms for a little color."
"1","5","I needed a quick and easy recipe for cookies to take to work tomorrow. Preferably a recipe that didn't call for fancy ingredients I didn't already have in my pantry. I thought I'd try this one and WOW, they are delicious, and I got the approval from my 4 year old as well as husband (I hope they make it to work with me tomorrow...lol). They taste like a cross between a brownie & a chocolate chip cookie. They were very easy to make and I love that the recipe calls for butter because since switching to organic cooking I don't use crisco or other shortenings for anything. I followed the recipe exactly (including the optional chopped walnuts) and they turned out wonderful. I will definitely make these again."
"1","5","I love this recipe. It satisfies your chocolate cravings without overloading you with sugar. Absolutely delicious and fun to make."
"1","5","They are great just the way they are.I think they taste better within 2 days of being baked. I chilled the dough overnight , rolled into balls and slightly flattened before baking and they were perfectly baked in 11 mins."
"1","5","i actually spread this out in a greased pan(with a little help from some damp fingers but butter probably would have worked as well) and baked it for about 20 mins and they are GOOOOOOOD! make sure to let them cool completely before trying to cut and get out of the pan. i was impatient last night and wanted to try them and they completely fell apart but this morning they're perfect!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious! So chocolatey! This makes a lot of cookies!"
"1","5","These are very good but I will have to add nuts the next time. I used special dark chocolate chips and used 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup light brown sugar and they were amazing. Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","WONDERFUL very very chocolaty though, one will do your chocolate fix in! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar because I love what brown sugar does to cookies and I used a little more vanilla just to give it a serious flavor.. Love them! I will be making them again and again"
"1","5","I just made these cookies for the first time today and they were so yummy. I stuck to the recipe but instead of the semisweet chocolate chips I used dark chocolate chips and added heath toffee bar bits. They gave the cookies a bit of a crunch, I will continue to make these cookies for years."
"1","4","I made these cookies following the recipe, except I used Crisco butter flavored shortening. I used a cookie scoop and when I baked the cookies for 8 minutes, their shape didn't change at all and they looked a little undercooked. I left them in for a couple minutes longer and they came out good! The cookies were still round, but this helped the inside stay moist and cake-like. I kept the cookies in a tupperware for a few days and they didn't dry out! It was a little difficult for me to gage the cook time because at first I couldn't tell if the cookies were 'cooked' since they didn't change shape. Be careful not to overcook these or they might crumble! Overall, these cookies came out moist and they are good for those chocolate cravings!"
"1","5","Super chocolatey and delicious!"
"1","5","I just tried this recipe with my children and it was just super yummy! My one son has some special dietary needs so I substituted the sugar with 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda, and I also used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. This just makes it friendlier for his sugar. Even so, it was super tasty! We also used peppermint baking chips in place of the chocolate chips. Not only did they taste fantastic but they were really stunning too. Could have easily given them as Christmas presents!"
"1","4","Didn't quite yield 4 dozen, must have made them too big. Best recipe yet on this site! Took very little time and everybody loves them!"
"1","5","These are a HUGE hit with the household!! Thanks for posting this. The last batch I made I used 2 cups of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of macadamia nuts which I think made this recipe the best cookies I've ever eaten! I also baked them exactly 8 minutes because they will set if you leave them on the sheet for a couple of mins before cooling and this way they don't dry out at all. Nice and moist days later (if they last in the house that long!)."
"1","5","Added Ande's Creme de Menthe baking chips for half of the chocolate chips. Delicious Variation!"
"1","4","Wonderful cookies, but I may make a few adjustments to the next batch. Something was a little off in terms of flavor, but it may have been the brand of cocoa powder we used. Very addicting all the same! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Awesome cookies. I halved the recipe (I only had 1/2 cup butter) and I used 2/3 the amount of chocolate chips and then the remainder was peanut butter chips. They turned out great."
"1","5","i made these cookies for my finance's family for Christmas they were a big hit!! I let the dough rest in the freezer for about an hour then i rolled them in powdered sugar before baking."
"1","5","these are delicous!! i use reese's chips insteand of chocolate. i also have used chocolate and reese's that was yummy too. this is the only chocolate cookie recipe i use now i always have compliments on these"
"1","5","These are my favorite cookies EVER! I can rarely have anything ready by the time the oven preheats, but not in this case! They are easy to make and so quick! I bake them right on my pizza stone and they come out absolutely perfect. I use Baker's chocolate broken into bits because I never have chips in the cupboard. The chunks of ooey gooey chocolate are amazing. Yum! Thank you for the great recipe!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and these came out amazing! I completely didn't have high hopes as cookies usually don't come out so decent here in CO but no issues what so ever. Will be making these again for sure!"
"1","5","Great recipe! After reading other reviews, I made a few changes. Mine were not flat and were chewy in the middle with a little crisp on top and crunch from the added candy cane. I used 1/2 cup butter Substituted 1 cup of the sugar for brown sugar used a full teaspoon of baking soda Added peppermint abstract and 4 smashed candy canes. Added a cup and a half of choc chips. Next time I'll use peanut butter instead of butter and still use choc chips:)"
"1","5","Delicious cookies! I used half butter half margarine as that was what I had on hand and the cookies as others have mentioned do flatten a lot so you do really need to chill the dough before dropping spoonfuls onto prepared tryas, to prevent forming one giant cookie!! I will try it next time with all butter to see whether that was what my problem was. Otherwise beautifully moist and chocolatey cookie one of my faves flavor wise."
"1","4","An excellent recipe! They did dry out *slightly* by day 3, but really it was kind of a miracle that they lasted that long anyway! Believe it or not, I did not use white flour at all, and you would never have known it. I did 1 cup whole spelt flour, and 1 cup kamut flour (very fine grained, looks and acts like white flour, but it is a whole grain). For the sugar I did 3/4 white and 3/4 raw cane. Next time I will substitute 1/3 of the butter with 1/3 cup of apple sauce. (That has worked for all of my other cookie recipes)"
"1","5","Easy & extra yummy! These cookies are for the chocolate lover. They turned out perfect; not flat, etc. I did have to cook them a bit longer than what is suggested, but I made my cookies larger than what is described. Great recipe!"
"1","4","i thought these were just ok. i used all real butter and half brown/half white sugar. mine were not flat at all but seemed very sugar-y."
"1","5","I added andes mints and the family named them 'crack cookies' because everyone was hooked!!!"
"1","5","These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they taste great. Next time I might try other reviewer suggestions to use half shortening and half brown sugar to see if that improves texture or appearance. I followed reviewer suggestions and only baked 8 minutes to make sure they stayed soft."
"1","4","My husband and I both enjoyed these - the flavor was good. The only thing I would change next time is to take other reviewers' advice and use half butter/half shortening. Even though I live at a low altitude, my cookies still came out flat - almost as flat as the cookies I made when I lived in Colorado, which is pretty darn flat. I'd definitely try this recipe again, though!"
"1","5","I first made these for a family car trip to Colorado this past summer. So delicious! The perfect picnic cookie! They stayed good in tupperware our entire week long trip--nice and soft. I will be making these this Christmas for friends and family."
"1","5","These are super tasty!!! However, I have not actually tried the real recipe. Instead I use have the butter and substitute it with a little bit of shortening and milk and I added 1 cup white sugar and then 1/2 cup brown sugar. Thanks KATHY!!"
"1","4","These turned out absolutely delicious, and not overwhelmingly chocolatey as I was concerned. My boyfriend is a chocoholic and just ate these right up!"
"1","5","Yummy!! I had a bag of mint M&Ms that i wanted to use in a chocolate cookie, and they were so tasty in this recipe. I followed the recipe except used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown as per some other reviews. I did follow some other reviewers and under baked them slightly, so they turned out a delicious cake/brownie consistency. This recipe is definitely a keeper."
"1","5","And this folks, is a cookie. No words......Mmmmmmmmmm"
"1","5","This recipe is AWESOME! Love it, so delicious. Only thing I did differently was that I put the dough in the refridgerator for atleast 1 hour and they were nice and thick."
"1","5","these are amazing best cookies ever i didn't do the nuts"
"1","5","YUMMY!!! These cookies are fabulous! My lil' Olivia and I made a batch today. We love chocolate, so was an excellent cookie recipe for us! I followed the advise of some of the other reviews and used half butter and half shortening and also half brown sugar and half white sugar. So good we will defiantly make these again!"
"1","5","Delicious! I added 1/2 cup ground flax seed in place of 1/2 cup of flour to add fibre. Does not change the taste and you can't even tell it's in there. Also, if you keep your chocolate chips in the freezer, after the cookies cool the chocolate chips are still a little runny....YUMMY!"
"1","5","I made these exactly as written. I used Guittard cocoa rouge. I'm not a huge cookie fan in general, but these were to die for! They're my new staple since they're ridiculously easy and a real crowd pleaser."
"1","5","Oh wow! I made these for a bake sale at scool and they were literally THE FIRST thing to go. I had people buy a couple, then come back to get more. Then we ran out and still had people looking for them! The only thing is that I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. YUMMY!"
"1","5","My family loved these cookies! They were easy to make and were still soft and delicious the next day. I used half shortening and half butter. These were a lot like a recipe I have used in the past that used a brownie mix. These were better!"
"1","5","Followed others directions and used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white sugars, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup creamed shortening. Took them out of the oven just before they were done, so they remained a bit crispy on the outside and gooey chewy on the inside. Mine flattened out perfectly to the way we wanted them. Wouldn't say they were like brownies as some have said. I think mine really came out like chocolate chip cookies in chocolate batter. What a great combo! Oh, and dough was delicious, too!"
"1","5","Amazing! Tried with mini M&Ms instead of chocolate chips the second time I made these, and they were equally as excellent, and had a little extra crunch. Perfect for any chocolate lover!"
"1","4","These are very very good. The reason for the 4 star is because they are SO chocolate filled that you can't eat more than one without getting sick. But very good none the less. I found that using stoneware bakeware (with a sheet of parchment paper on) I had to bake them for 10 minutes and let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes. This seemed to be the perfect cook time."
"1","3","I would give these a 3.5. We didn't find them especially great. The cocoa powder flavor was a little too strong. Maybe they'll be better tomorrow?? If so, I'll update!"
"1","5","Everyone loved these! I made a few changes based on past reviews. I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar, left out the walnuts, and baked them at 375 for 8 minutes. They came out deliciously chewy and tasted like brownies!"
"1","5","I have made these so many times. So soft and yummy!"
"1","5","Great recipe! I will make again for sure!"
"1","5","I took these cookies with me to a dinner party and was told they were the best cookies they have ever had in Michigan, had some native new yorkers present. This is an amazing base recipe, my advice in this recipe is to use high quality cocoa and high quality semi sweet chocolate chips.. It really makes a difference"
"1","5","Excellent cookies! Took the advice of others and modified it just a tad.. I halved the recipe and did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening and did 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4th cup of brown sugar. Also used egg substitute since my daughter has an egg allergy - used ENER-G egg substitute. I'm pretty sure this is what caused the cookies to not 'spread' and look like cookies.. they just remained as-is - so looked just like clumps of cooked dough, but nevertheless, they tasted heavenly!"
"1","4","Excellent! I used milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening. Thank you."
"1","5","WOW this is a great cookie. As with any recipe, I made some changes based on personal preference and on what I had in the cupboard. I didn't have cocoa powder, so instead I replaced 1/2 cup sugar with a packet of chocolate pudding mix, and used 2 2/3 c flour to make up for the lack of cocoa. Secondly, I always freeze my cookie dough before baking to give me thick, moist, chewy cookies. With these two changes my cookies came about absolutely AMAZING, and they stay that way for longer. What a great recipe to use as a base. My next experiment: pistachio chocolate chip cookies using pistachio pudding mix. yumm!!"
"1","4","These cookies are yummy! I only made a half recipe. I used applesauce instead of butter to cut down on the fat, and they turned out great! Since the applesauce makes it a little sweeter, I only used 1/2 c sugar. I also added baking powder in addition to the baking soda (1:1), and only used 3/4 c of chocolate chips."
"1","5","Excellent cookie. I did 1 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar and did 1 C chocolate chips, 1 C toffee chips. They were a big hit!"
"1","5","These cookies are amazing! Instead of semisweet chocolate chip's I used white chocolate chips so they were more domino cookies and I also omitted the nuts. I found it worked really well to make really large cookies and to cook them for 12 minutes"
"1","5","If your not afraid of fat or calories (and why would ya be?), fold in 1 cup of peanut butter with your wet ingredients while keeping all the other ingredients the same. These cookies will melt in your mouth...adding that extra cup will yield 5 dozen."
"1","5","With only 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of mini-chocolate chips (to better spread the chocolate goodness), these cookies are one of my favorites. I freeze them and have one whenever a chocolate craving hits me."
"1","4","it is good with the mint green cips from cappods"
"1","5","I have used this recipe multiple times with various chocolate and nut mixtures and they always turn out fabulous. Very good basic cookie recipe. The dough freezes well which is great to have on stand by. I did change the the sugar to 3/4 a cup white sugar and 3/4 cup mixed light and dark brown sugar and they came out even better!"
"1","4","Really good cookies."
"1","5","I just tried this today and my cookies came out very good. They were actually better after they cooled. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but substituted the coco powder for unsweetened strawberry coulis. A great base recipe that I'll use again!"
"1","5","Wow, these were super easy and better than I expected. Kind of like a brownie style cookie, great flavor. I ended up using mini dark chocolate chips and made them into ice-cream sandwiches. A great treat in our 100+ degree weather!"
"1","3","The taste was great, but my cookies were so flat they were almost 2-dimensional, and I followed the recipe exactly."
"1","4","I added maraschino cherries and cherry syrup to these. They are tasty but I may cut down on the cocoa powder next time as they are a bit TOO chocolaty."
"1","5","These are awesome. I just made them gluten-free (with Jules GF Flour mix). I used 1/2 shortening (Spectrum palm oil kind- non-hydrogenated) and half butter, and also used 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar as recommended by another reviewer. They were so good out of the oven that even my non-GF family members raved about them. They are super chocolatey but fluffy at the same time. Will definitely make again!"
"1","5","Flavor was good, not outstanding. I gave this recipe 3 stars because of the dryness factor. I was thinking they would be more moist and chewy like a chocolate chip cookie. Any ideas that can make this less dry? *********** UPDATE!******** Im changing from a 3 star to a 5! As I was nearing my last batch of dough to scoop and bake, I thought and thought what I could do to make these more moist. So I went to the one ingredient that I use in place of oil for cakes...unsweetened applesauce! I stirred in about 1/2 cup worth of unsweetened applesauce. The dough then became very soft but not too soft that it didnt hold a round shape when I droped them onto the cookie sheet. These came out AMAZING! Absolutly wonderful, still very chocolaty and delicious, but soft and chewy. These altered cookies have more of a brownie like texture, so if thats not what you want for these, I wouldnt use the applesauce. Otherwise I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND using ALL the ingredients listed, but also add about 1 1/4 C unsweetened applesauce. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!"
"1","4","These were delicious, but tasted more like cocoa powder cookies than chocolate cookies. They were very moist and chewy which I love, and all those chocolate chips were the saving grace for these cookies."
"1","5","Oh my, these are sinful! So rich, chocolatey, and ooey gooey good! I followed the advice of others and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I also used half semisweet chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips. I'll definitely make these cookies again!"
"1","5","Yum! I think that there is way too much butter for this recipe. I am eating a cookie as I type and the butter overpowers the rest of the ingredients. it's a good dessert with Coffee!"
"1","5","these cookies are really good. I made a half of batch for a gift. I used margerine (all i had) with no problem. I skip the nuts due to preference. I did refrigerate the dough for easier handling. I've never made chocolate cookies before and idk they're something impressive looking about these cookies. The baking time was right on. I think i'll use white chocolate chips next time to suit my tastes. Or even dipping one half of the cookies in white chocolate."
"1","3","The flavour was super, but mine turned out too flat...not sure what went wrong!?"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious as is--no modifications needed. The only thing that I always do when I use butter in a cookie recipe that isn't mentioned here is to refrigerate the dough for about an hour before dropping onto the cookie sheets. This seems to make them hold their form much better and not come out flat.  ETA: Just finished eating this batch, 5 days later and they are still nice and soft! Stored them in a rubbermaid container. Making another batch tomorrow!"
"1","5","These cookies are fantastic! My cookies tend to go flat. So i used 1/2 cup REAL butter and 1/2 shortening. I also took the advice of another review and did half brown,and half white sugar. I won't be buying cookies anymore. :o)"
"1","5","Awesome! Made the following modifications: Used shortening, not butter. 1 C brown sugar, 1/2 C white. Added 3/4 t baking powder. Used 1+1/2 T real vanilla. These turned out perfect. Heads up - they are a nice fluffly cookie, so if you prefer them to settle a bit, give them a gentle tap after you've rolled them into balls - push them to about 1/2-3/4' high."
"1","5","amazing cookies that satisfy any chocolate cravings. i cut this recipe in half and used milk chocolate chips, no nuts, and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. this recipe is a keeper."
"1","5","These cookies are amazing! I just pulled a batch out of the oven and love them! There perfect when there warm and gooey."
"1","4","Wonderful! My husband calls them his brownie cookies. The whole family loves them."
"1","5","I made these cookies today with chopped dark chocolate, and mini chocolate chips, and boy were they moist, and rich!! What a great recipe- I'll keep this one in my arsenal for sure!!"
"1","4","This dough is VERY thick. My Kitchen Aid mixer handled it just fine though. The cookies are very good and worth the effort. They are very rich and chocolatey...Just the way we like them."
"1","4","The dough was kinda hard to work with, but well worth it!"
"1","5","This recipe is one of my favorites! Simple to follow, I've made it dozens of times without the help of a handmixer and it still comes out great. I use a silicone baking mat which makes them come out even; the hardest part is pulling them out of the oven after only 8 or so minutes, as long as the edges are set and the middle looks done, the cookies stay chewy. Kudos to whoever added this recipe."
"1","5","i was in the mood for chocolate and decided to give this recipe a try. i followed the advise of other reviewers and used 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c shortening 1/2c butter. the cookies are amazing. just what i was looking for. i think they turned out a little too sweet with milk chocolate chips. thinking they might be amazing with mint chips too. great recipe."
"1","5","These cookies are really really fabulous. I am always on the lookout for the perfect recipe for each kind of cookie - sugar, peanut butter, chocolate chip, etc. This recipe is definitely the PERFECT recipe for chocolate chocolate chip cookies. I didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand, so I halved the recipe, and it came out great. It is really really easy to make too. I wanted to try the other readers recommendations of a white sugar/brown sugar combo, but I was out of brown sugar. I used all white, as the original recipe calls for, and I can't imagine it being improved upon with the substitution of some brown. One of my favorite things is the shape of these cookies. They come out looking nicely mounded and chunky. 8 minutes in the oven = a perfect, soft, chewy cookie. Amazingly.. I liked them even more the next day than right out of the oven, b/c they are so rich. Straight out of the oven when the chips are all melty, is a lot of chocolate to handle!!! Everyone that has tried these is super impressed. Finally, the only difference I made is with the chips. I didn't have a bag of semisweet chips on hand. I did have, however, a bar of Ghirardelli semisweet and a bar of their 60% cacao bittersweet too. So I chopped those up, and used them in place of standard semisweet chips. I actually think I liked that better, since it made it more of a 'chunk' cookie, rather than a 'chip' cookie, and the chunk seemed better suited to this recipe. 5 stars all the way!!!!"
"1","5","Delicious, only change I did was use butterscotch chips. Will be making these again!!"
"1","5","Excellent and easy!"
"1","5","these are so yummy thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Hit the spot. Had hard day at work and came home craving chocolate! I subbed semi-sweet for dark chocolate chips and subbed walnuts for macadamia nuts. This is my new go-to chololate cookie recipe!"
"1","2","Its was ok... I followed the directions, just not one of my favorites. Probably wont make again."
"1","5","Best chocolate chip cookies i've ever made. Everybody who had 1 (or more) loved them. they where moist and soft lots of flavor"
"1","5","These cookies were delicious! This recipe is a keeper. I got 2 Silpat mats for Christmas and I've been dying to use them. They worked wonderfully! I changed a few things that made the cookies that much better: I too used half butter/half shortening and half brown/half white sugar like I saw in someone's review. It made the cookies thick and very moist. I used a heaping melon ball scooper and got 4 dozen cookies. We added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to half of the batter and the cranberries just put these cookies over the top for me! My fiance prefers the ones without cranberries but he liked both and he usually won't eat cranberries. 8 minutes left the cookies a little too moist. Just shy of 10 minutes seems to be right with my oven. I added a teaspoon of butter flavoring to enhance the shortening and a teaspoon of chocolate flavoring since I was a little short on cocoa powder. We will make these again soon!"
"1","5","Pour yourself a big glass of milk. This cookie is yummy. I even made some 'healthier' changes including:dark choc. chips, smart balance butter, 1 cup wheat flour (and the other cup all purpose), and sugar in the raw. My three children have devoured these cookies. They are superb. Thanks."
"1","5","These were very good, I did use 1/2 Brown Sugar. I added a special topping that made them even better though...about 2 minutes prior to being done baking.... I pulled them from the oven and squished 3 mini marshmallows onto them, popped them back in the oven to finish cooking. Once cooled I covered the tops with a chocolate cream cheese frosting...So good!"
"1","4","Incredible! Just the texture/flavor I was looking for but better. I halved the recipe, subbed 1/2 mashed banana for the egg since I was out, used 1/2 c. brown sugar + 1/4 c. white sugar, and left out the cocoa powder and walnuts. Yum yum :)"
"1","5","Made exactly as recipe states (without the walnuts), and they are super duper good. Like a brownie, but in cookie form."
"1","3","The first time I made these cookies they were amazing. They had a brownie texture so chewy in the middle and a nice complimentary texture on the outside. I have since tried to remake this cookie without success. They still tast great but I couldnt recreate that chewiness that made me fall in love with them the first time."
"1","5","These cookies have become my signature item! Everytime I get together with my friends, they ask my to bring 'the cookies' I make them exactly as the recipe calls for but I prefer my cookies to be moist on the inside so i do not cook them as long!"
"1","5","Rich and moist! Puffed up nicely. I've always had a problem with flat cookies, but I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening, chilled the spoonfuls of dough on the pan for a few minutes before baking each batch, used foil and changed it each time. Definitely bake only 8 minutes. Mine were moist, but I feel even 1 more minute and they would've started drying out. I made the original recipe, minus the nuts and divided it: added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips to a quarter of the dough (tasty, but a bit too rich--next time I'll reduce the amount of chocolate chips when I mix the two); added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to a half of the batter (still felt I could have added another 1/2 cup)."
"1","4","Wonderful! Per previous reviews I used half/half shortening/butter and brown sugar/white sugar. I also subbed 1 2/3 cups peanut butter chips then an additional 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Delicious. They came out thick and delicious."
"1","3","I think these were so-so. I followed the recipe exactly except I used half sugar/half splenda, so I am not sure if that created a flat taste. I will try to make these again with full sugar and see."
"1","4","For people concerned about flat cookies the solution is simple -- add more flour than the recipe calls for, form the cookie into a ball, and chill it sufficiently before baking. I guarantee your cookies will not be flat."
"1","5","These were awesome. I used a baking margarine and a quality dark chocolate chip. This is enough chocolate for a true chocolate lover. They almost have a fudge brownie feel to them."
"1","5","I just made these and they were just FANTASTIC! There are similar cookies at a bakery nearby that I wanted to copy and I thought it would take me forever to find a recipe that was close and yet I found them on my first try! I didn't change the recipe at all except for maybe adding slightly more chocolate chips to the batter and then I put a few more on top of each cookie before they went in the oven. My only criticism would be that it took a long time to beat the wet ingredients until the batter was smooth, and I found the dough very messy to work with but the result was well worth it!"
"1","5","Very good."
"1","5","I just made and ate one of these. They are probably the best cookies I've ever had, and I will definately be making these again! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, with the only change being that I substituted about a 1/4 cup of coconut inplace of that much chocolate chips. Adult & kid approved here! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Oh, these cookies are to die for! This makes a nicely sized batch, too, even if you go by rounded T's instead of t's. These all had to be given away as gifts (sadly), but of course I sneaked a few for myself! So very chocolatey and moist. Because I like less-sweet chocolate, I'd cut back on the sugar next time. Take them out of the oven after about 8min, 30sec. They won't look or feel done, but that is the key to a moist cookie. Let them cool almost completely on the baking sheets; that keeps them chewy. Thanks a lot! This is going in my recipe book!"
"1","5","I live in Switzerland where I have to chop up my own chocolate bars into chunks. My Swiss colleagues and friends love their chocolate and they can't get enough of this cookie! I sprinkled a little bit of candy cane on the top for Christmas and voile! Perfect holiday cookie and wonderful cookie overall."
"1","5","Made these for the first time for a cookie exchange. Very easy to make and delicious. Sort of a brownie-like cookie. Along with the chocolate chips and nuts, I added some white chocolate chips. Delish!"
"1","5","These cookies were AMAZING! My kiddos gobbled them up, and they were very easy to make. Based on the other reviews I used half crisco, half butter, and half white half brown sugar."
"1","3","This was good. I won't make them again, but I wouldn't say it was a waste. I think the chocolate flavor was less than acceptable, it just seemed a bit off."
"1","4","I made some adjustments to the recipe. I halved the recipe since I only had 1/2 cup butter left, used 1 3/4 cups of whole wheat PASTRY flour, 1/2 black/brown sugar, 1/4 cane sugar, and 1/4 honey, used 60% cocoa chips (since I prefer dark>milk), and since I used pastry flour I also used 1/2 baking soda & powder. The outcome was very good, but I would use less black/brown sugar next time since it was a bit too sugary for my taste, and it has a distinct flavor to it. Overall 4/5, I would make this recipe again. :)"
"1","5","Easy, quick, delicious cookies... They taste like brownies!"
"1","5","I added 1/3 cup extra cocoa and reduce the flour by 1/3 cup to make these even more rich. I love that, because you can eat less and still get that chocolate fix. Great with milk. Simple the best cookie recipe I have ever found. Baked for exactly 9 minutes."
"1","5","These cookies are great! The longer you let them sit in the fridge (within reason of course) the better they are! I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups white and everybody loved them...I will get a pic of these when i make them this weekend...."
"1","5","Nat's MS cookies - especially good when they are warm"
"1","4","We loved it! It's like a cross between a cookie and a brownie."
"1","4","I made these with PB chips, and everyone loved them....not my favorite, but that may be because I don't really like a chocolate cookie anyways. They were easy to make and looked nice."
"1","4","Very rich chocolate flavor! I personally am just a regular choco chip girl.. but none the less, this recipe is pretty awesome.. they cookies stayed soft for me for a few days."
"1","5","These cookies are amazing!! I did replace 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar and they turned out so good! I will definitely make these again. Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","love subbed a 1/2 C of brown sugar and did 1/2 butter flavored crisco and 1/2 butter...the perfect cookie for me!"
"1","5","These are so fabulous. I used half brown and half white sugar.I also used 1 1/2 c. semisweet chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips. These are a real treat. I will be making these instead of regular old chocolate chip cookies!!!:)"
"1","5","The cookies were fantastic!!!"
"1","5","WOW! This certainly hit the chocolate craving right on target! I am a half brown sugar/half white sugar kind of girl, so I split it 3/4 each. This produced a light cookie. It doesn't seem like it will be light because it is DENSE, but when they come out of the oven...perfection! Thanks for posting!"
"1","4","forgot to add the baking soda and still came out great...took 1 star away tho cuz liked better when i did half butter half shortening i also did half white and half brown sugar and i used milk choco chips cuz i like em better than the semiseet ones"
"1","5","WOW!!!! These are AMAZING!!!! We are unable to eat dairy so I've not had choc chip cookies in a long time and these didn't disappoint! I made some modifications for our allergies and these were out of this world!!!! I used spelt flour (1 3/4 c) and 1 c white 1/2 brown sugar as others had suggested. I used all shortening, and used a bag of Enjoy Life chocolate chips. I also had to bake mine for 10 minutes. THANK YOU for such an amazing recipe!!"
"1","5","OMG. Omitted nuts, and switched chocolate chips for peppermint chips. Replaced 1 tsp. of vanilla extract with pure peppermint extract. Subbed half white sugar with brown sugar. These were to DIE for. If you are having a chocolate fit, these will sooooo fix it. Yes, they should be a bit soft at the end, they cool and are perfect. I did 10 minutes and they were good. I did 11 minutes and they were even better - it gave the edges a chewiness that was awesome. Thanks for this recipe - will be a keeper forever. :)"
"1","4","My 8 year old son, and 4 year old daughter really liked these. My 4 year old who normally passes up any cookie, ate 2 of these! I did make a couple changes, I used half brown sugar, half white, half butter, half Crisco. I like the fact that this only makes 4 dozen, because I really don't like making cookies, so this was just enough."
"1","5","Awesome chocolate cookie!!! I used half butter, half shortening but other than that I would not make any changes to it. I did use a bit less choc chips than called for. Thanks for the amazing recipe!"
"1","5","These cookies were really good! The family loved them. I made them as bars, so I was able to use oil instead of butter. I also substituted 1/2 c. of the white sugar with brown, and used half white chocolate chips and half regular. Be careful not to overbake, these need to be soft."
"1","5","Very good cookies! They are a little too chocolatey for me but that's because i'm not a huge chocolate fan but overall the cookies are fantastic!"
"1","5","Ahhh! These cookies were soft, chewy, and everything I could ask for. They disappeared in record time! There was the perfect balance of chocolate chips and cocoa flavor...I will make 'em again and again. And use mint flavored chips with this recipe too, it is astounding!"
"1","5","i had fun making and eating these. soooo much chocolate i didn't mind at all!"
"1","5","I cannot believe how FANTASTIC these turned out. I even used half the cocoa and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe Kathy."
"1","5","Delicious cookies with a texture similar to a brownie. I substituted the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips and added macadamia nuts. I also used half white and half brown sugar and butter flavored crisco. The texture and taste (not too sweet) were such a perfect combo that even my guy friends asked for more."
"1","5","I have the biggest sweet tooth and these hit the spot! This has to be one of my all time favorite recipes. Definitely made for chocolate lovers. My husband, who isn't the biggest fan of chocolate, LOVED them. A favorite!! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Everyone loves these cookies!!!! Very easy to make too!"
"1","5","Everytime I make these, people rave about them! The best!"
"1","5","Very Good. I love to make these huge, they set up really good. Thanks"
"1","5","I loved these!!!! I ate way to many! Thanks, I will make these lots more in the future!"
"1","5","I used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 baking powder, added 1 cup of oats instead of the nuts and baked 12 mins and it was good, crispy on the outside. Next time I'd try a tsp of instant coffee and use 1/2 brown sugar like others suggest."
"1","5","I loved these so much I shared them with people all over my village, including the owners of the coffee bar. Great cookie recipe. I also used 1/2 c. white chocolate chips and 1 1/2 semi sweet chips."
"1","5","I thought these were perfect! These are thick bakery style cookies which I prefer over the thin version. This is my new go to chocolate chip recipe! Thanks so much."
"1","4","Exactly what you'd expect from a chocolate chocolate chip cookie - this recipe delivers! I made as written, subbing in some white chocolate chips or peanut butter chips to use up some of the ingredients i had in my pantry. I erred on the side of caution and underbaked slightly...chocolate cookies tend to dry out sooner, I think. All the coworkers enjoyed!"
"1","5","Love these, so yummy! Will make these ones again, so far my favorite."
"1","5","Fabulous! I also added 1 tsp instant coffee to bring out the chocolatey flavour. 4 days later, the cookies are almost all gone and still very soft and wonderful!"
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!!! These were sooooooooooo good! I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. Instead of chocolate chunks or chips I added Peanut Butter chips... AMAZING! 4 people ate a full batch in one night, lol. Also, they took closer to 14 minutes to cook... I think because I made them larger."
"1","5","These were great! After a few minutes out of the oven they were rich and gooey, my brother loved them. I followed the recipe exact, except I didn't use nuts and I did half white and half brown sugar like everyone says. I put them in my convection bake oven for 6 min. Yummy!"
"1","5","these were so good. i went a little heavy on the salt and i think it made them even better. i upped the cocoa as everyone suggested. they came out great although i had to cook mine a solid 12 minutes. they were still chewy and everything."
"1","5","I hate chocolate, so honestly I did not even try to taste one of these. HOWEVER everyone who did loved them and kept talking about how wonderful they were...which is why I gave the 5 stars. Thank you for the recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome cookies!! The only thing I did different was substitute 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 cup of the granulated sugar (I still used 1/2 cup of gran. sug). I make these for a group of college boys that come over every week and they continue to ask for more!"
"1","5","Delicious! I did half butter and half butter-flavored crisco, then substituted 1/2 cup light brown sugar for white sugar, and pecans instead of walnuts. Cooked for exactly 10 minutes. They looked just like the picture and tasted oh so chocolately!"
"1","5","A great chocolaty cookie. I didn't change a thing except add a few M&M's to the batch. Chewy and delicious!"
"1","5","definitely a keeper!!!!! a heaven for all the chocoholics...just like me! I have baked them with 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar as other suggested...yummy yummy!!!!"
"1","5","These cookies are incredible! They were hit! I made these cookies two days ago and only crumbs are left! I followed the instructions as is! The only thing i did differently was instead of 1 1/2 cup of white sugar, I did 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar! I definite must try! You won't be disappointed! They are so soft and chewy! Yummyyyy!!!!!"
"1","4","These were very good! I chilled the dough and didn't have any trouble with it being sticky as others have reviewed. I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it is, and the cookies came out great! The dough was really sticky, but it didn't spread too much in the oven, to my happy surprise. (: I made a batch of these for my little sister's party, and they were gone within minutes, literally! I will definitely be making these little brownies again."
"1","5","WOW! These are so good they are dangerous! I substituted reeses peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips and they taste awesome. I definitely will make these again."
"1","5","We loved this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","We have been making this recipe for a couple of years & it's always a favorite. I substitute chocolate chips for Reese's Peanut butter chips & I sub the nuts for toffee bits."
"1","5","These are excellent and still soft and chewy a day later. I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c butter-flav shortning and didn't have enough cocoa so I put some nestle chocolate milk mix in. Absolutely delicious."
"1","5","Followed the recipie exactly and they came out amazing. Not to sweet and very moist. 5 stars!"
"1","5","I made this without making any changes and it turned out great! I did not use the optional nuts."
"1","4","Made these in a 13x9 inch pan to save time. They came out like chewy brownie/cookies. Very good. They dry out quick so be sure to keep the pan covered. Will surely make again!"
"1","5","These are amazing!! Try using half almond extract and half vanilla! SOOO GOOD!"
"1","5","These are great! I always use margarine for baking and added walnuts and they are so yummy."
"1","5","LOVED them. they were absoulutely fantastic. i did make a few changes. as i do with all of my cookies i used half regular all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. i also added 3 table spoons of coldmilled flax to make it just a bit healthier. lovedd these cookies."
"1","5","I made these this weekend and they are all gone.I have to say these are really yummy,I didn't add walnuts but wish I had.I will be saving this recipe!!!!"
"1","5","Awesome! Made as listed."
"1","5","Delicious, nice fudgy taste. I used the chocolate and white swirl chips from Nestle. Cannot keep my family out of them as I am baking them."
"1","5","I did as others suggested and used butter and shortning. They were great! One of the best cookies I've ever made!! I will use this recipe as a base to make other cookies!"
"1","5","I made these almost exactly how the recipe states 3 times now. Every time they are excellent. The only changes that I make are the choc. chips - I either use white choc. chips, m&ms (they add color for holidays & are soo good after being cooked into the cookies). Everyone's favorite addition though were the Andes Mint Chips - soooooooo amazing - mint choc. cookies! Yummy, I highly suggest trying that if you like mint choc. anything! :o)"
"1","5","A-mazing. I used one cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and one cup mint chocolate chips and they were wonderful (I didn't add any nuts)."
"1","5","Deep chocolate flavor! WAY WAY WAY better tasting than the recipes that call for chocolate pudding. No nasty artificial flavors . We like these almost as much as homemade brownies and that's saying a lot! :)"
"1","4","IT was a really good cookie. It stayed moist for days. These are the things I did to change the recipe. 1. I substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown. 2. I used 1/2 cup of shortening and a 1/2 of softened butter. 3. I also did half semi-sweet and half white chocolate chunks. It was awesome. Although I think I should have sifted the dry ingredients because there was chunks of cocoa powder in the cookie."
"1","5","I had no idea I was capable of making cookies that are THIS good. They're seriously the best cookies I've ever had. They turn out so moist and soft every time!"
"1","5","Liked this recipe as I never have chocolate squares the other recipes call for. Do not over bake, as it is hard to tell how they are doing with such a dark color. The minute I saw cracking on the top I took them out for a chewy moist cookie."
"1","5","This were SO rich and chocolatey. Easy to make although I needed to keep them in the over for closer to 20 minutes."
"1","5","These were the best and very Bakery like cookies. Such chocolate goodness."
"1","5","The best chocolate cookie dough ever - only had pecans and milk choc chips but these cookies were awesome. Didn't change anything in the recipe. That picture above does not do them justice either - mine came out nearly black - yummy!!"
"1","4","This makes a lot of cookies. I used 1/2 semi-sweet chunks and 1/2 white chips. If you want a brownie-like chocolate cookie, this is for you. I still prefer my standard doubletree chocolate chip cookie recipe - hands down."
"1","5","Everyone LOVED these cookies. The recipe made so many, that I took half in to work after they were 3 or 4 days stale and they begged for more! These are chewy and wonderful. Great for satisfying that chocolate craving."
"1","5","LOVE THESE! These were the best cookies on the christmas cookie platter!  UPDATE: Dec 2009 Still making them!"
"1","5","used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. also used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. added a few white choc. chips."
"1","5","If you like chocolate these are the cookies for you,I used simi sweet chips.and sub.1/2 cup of white sugar with brown. made half without nuts and half with.....delish both ways.thanks for a great chocolate fix.I will make these many many times."
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for a few years now. A definite staple for me. You can change it up a bit by adding, a few white chocolate chips or macadamia nuts. They will impress anyone who like a good chocolate cookie. Thanks a million!"
"1","5","It's not like this recipe needs another review, but they are the best!!!!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness, these are fantastic! Best Choc-choc-chip cookies I've made by far. I used the Hershey's dark cocoa and semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Not only are the cookies loaded with antioxidant-goodness, but they're fudgey and stick-to-the-roof-of-your mouth delicious. I'm glad I made them small, because I can't stop eating them! Definitely serve with a tall glass of cold milk. OR with vanilla ice cream -- oh, yeaaah. That's what I'm talking about!"
"1","4","I just made these and they were an absolute hit! I didn't have cocoa available, so I used Ghiradelli's hot cocoa mix and it worked just fine. Nice and gooey in the middle and ridiculously chocolatey! Be sure to grab a glass of milk to accompany these delightful treats!"
"1","5","These are awesome!"
"1","5","Awesome and easy recipe! Thanks for sharing! The only ingredient I was missing was the cocoa.. so I improvised and used instant hot chocolate.. They came out light in colour, but still extremely moist and very tasty. I used less chocolate chips than the recipe called for (about half) but it didn't compromise the chocolatey taste at all!"
"1","4","If you like a more cake-like cookie (which I don't but many others do) this is a great recipe. They were a big hit at our bake sale at work (first cookies to be sold out). I used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because I like the contrast of flavor and texture. This is also a very easy cookie dough to work with."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out great! Make sure to take them out when they're just firm - they'll stay nice and soft."
"1","5","the best"
"1","5","I made these for a church event and all the ladies raved! They were chewy and chocolaty and so yummy! I think next time I might add some dried cherries!"
"1","4","I made extra large cookies using an ice cream scoop and baked them for 16 minutes. I got about 11 large cookies. I'll have to make them again to acurately review them. I used unsalted butter that I had in the freezer and they tasted as if perhaps the butter was freezer burned. I will also use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar next time to acheive a chewier texture. These were almost cake-like."
"1","5","I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter as many suggested. These cookies are GREAT and YUMMY!! One of my favorite recipe ever!!"
"1","5","Very good cookie! I used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar as many suggested. I baked the cookies for exactly 10 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet. I let them cool about 4-5 minutes before transferring to the cooling rack. I must have a small teaspoon because I got 70 small cookies out of this recipe. But I like the cookies small since I can never eat just one cookie. Note - These cookies seemed like they were RAW when I took them out of the oven. Don't keep cooking them, they really will firm up. They cook a little longer on the sheet even after you take them out... Yum yum! Just tried them so I can't say how they will be in a few days. I doubt there will be any left!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out lovely. I even added the walnuts and they looked great! The dough is really sticky when you make it so be sure to refrigerate it before you put it on the cookie sheet (if you're planning on cutting them into specific shapes)"
"1","5","Amazing! They don't last nearly long enough in my house!"
"1","5","This is the best cookie recipe and it's soooo easy! I actually just put peanut butter chips in instead of nuts and I only cook them for about 7 to 8 minutes. I've made these so many times and everybody loves them."
"1","4","I halved the recipe but followed it exactly. It has a fudgy texture, and tastes so good with nuts. The cookie dough itself is not too sweet, but the chocolate chips counter that. Next time I think I'll sub the white sugar with brown sugar. I'll probably bake them longer too because they got too soft the next day."
"1","5","This recipe if wonderful. I did however use 1/2 cup of golden, brown sugar and only 1 cup of white sugar. Yum!"
"1","5","I've made these for the children and grandchildren, passed on the recipe to friends and family. Everyone loves them, including my 86 year old father. There a hit in my family!!"
"1","5","I've been baking cookies from scratch for over 15 years, and these are THE BEST ONES I HAVE EVER MADE, HANDS DOWN! Incredible right out of the oven. I'm having people over tomorrow, and they will worship me forever once they bite into my new favorite cookies. Big fat chewy chocolate chip cookie, you can bow down to these!!!! :-D"
"1","5","Sooo good! Someone brought these to a get together and I had to make them because I wanted more (a hazard of being pregnant). I think they're even better a day or two later."
"1","5","sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out great."
"1","5","Wow, did I get my chocolate fix or what after trying one of these. My friend and I made these and they were insanely addicting. We followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect. We did however take them out a bit early because they like their cookies chewier. I think I will try these with white chocolate chips next time, and then they will taste like the Panera cookies- but way cheaper!"
"1","5","This recipe makes fabulous cookies. Although, I didn't use regular chocolate chips like it calls for, because I ran out. I chopped up 2 squares of semi-sweet baking chocolate and used 1 cup of butterscotch chips. With the 1 cup of chopped walnuts, these cookies were really awesome, better than any bakery."
"1","5","This was absolutely the best cookie ever! My kids and husband couldn't stop eating them. They did stay very soft and cake-like. They got the most comments on in all of the cookies I made for Christmas this year. This is a definate keeper!"
"1","5","Wow, these cookies turned out great. I made these a few years ago, using Ghirardelli chips. This time, I used mint chocolate chips, as those were all I had. I also cut down the white sugar to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions. I used a fork to blend the eggs, sugars, etc., as I find that there are way fewer lumps. Bake for eight minutes, and you've got a yummy cookie!"
"1","5","OMG!!!This recipe is awesome!! I was shopping, seen in a cookie shop a chocolate cookie begging for me but I refused to pay the price for a cookie!! I found this recipe and it looks just like the cookie I seen and it taste as great as I knew that cookie in the mall would have. My 4 Boys love this and have requested it be made again and again(we are only on the first batch,just made them) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe it will be used in many years to come and for future grandchildren(hopefully I will have a few of those!!)Thanks again!!!!"
"1","5","An easy recipe that my 4 and 6 year old daughters can make with me. So fun and delicious, I will look no further for a delicious cookie."
"1","4","I've been looking for a chocolate, chocolate chip cookie for a long time. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I was alo happy with the number of cookies I got from one batch...didn't count but it was a lot!"
"1","5","THE BEST COOKIES IN THE WORLD EVER! A LITTLE TASTE OF AMERICA FOR US ALL IN THE UK! THANKS FOR SHARING XXX"
"1","1","Okay, so I am making the cookies and I followed a few or the reviewers advice to add half butter and half shortening....well, the cookies have been in the oven now for 13 minutes and are still raw inside. I am not sure what I did wrong!"
"1","5","This is the first *chocolate* cookie i've ever made. It was fabulous. I was looking for a butterscotch cookie recipe and got bored with what i saw. I stumbled upon this. Used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flav.crisco. cooked exactly 8 min. They are beautiful, warm, gooey. Just sent some next door, they LOVE them. Thank you soo much for this."
"1","4","Made as directed....good!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe. Made it with half butter (room temp) and half shortening. Used 1 c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar. Very good."
"1","5","these were very good! stayed chewy til the last cookie was eaten"
"1","5","Great Recipe! I have made chocolate cookies for years and sometimes they held their shape and sometimes they were flat and it doesn't seem to matter if you use the tricks of chilling the dough or adding flour. I used peanut butter chips and they were much more fun to bake when I did not have to worry about them holding their shape and they tasted great. My son that requests the chocolate peanut butter chip cookies thought they were also the best ones I have made. Thanks!"
"1","5","These cookies rock! The original recipe is fine, but I've made a few modifications to my own. I use sliced toasted almonds instead of walnuts, and I use dark chocolate shavings as my 'chips' that I then lightly fold in. I also like to use white chocolate shavings. MMM! Going to go bake some now!"
"1","5","This recipe was great! I did half brown and half white sugar and added just a little extra water to make the perfect texture. Then instead of regular chips I did mint Chocolate chips and they were a hit at the office!"
"1","5","These cookies are to die for. Way better then any chocolate cookie at the store. I underbaked them a little and they were soft and amazing!"
"1","5","These are the bomb!! Everyone absolutely loves these cookies :)"
"1","5","My favorite treat! Dangerously delicious."
"1","5","These taste like cookie brownies! They're amazing!!"
"1","5","VERY DELICIOUS COOKIES! I love this dough and use anything in them from peanut butter chips to mini M&M's! The possibilities are endless!"
"1","4","These cookies were good, but I would bake them different next time. I followed some of the other suggestions and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Every time I tasted the batter I thought, 'Gross' b/c of the shortening flavor. It kinda ruined it for me even after the cookies were baked... it was like I could still taste the underlying shortening flavor. Next time I will use the 1 cup of butter as the recipe indicates. I also added about 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips - this definitely saved the recipe and gave it the 4 stars.I also only baked the 8 minutes so they would remain a little gooey!"
"1","1","The only cookie recipe that has ever failed on me. Flat as pancakes and wouldn't come off the trays."
"1","5","Yummy! I made them per the other suggestions with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white. I also nixed the walnuts and just added white chocolate chips instead."
"1","4","Very good, I used Dark Chocolate cocoa powder because that's what I had. Very chocolatey. I mailed some to my brother in Georgia, so we'll see how they hold up. My Daughter (2), Husband, Mom, and Dad, loved them. However my Nephews (10, 8) and Niece (4) didn't, they're pickier. Will definately make again. I got 5 dozen smaller cookies out of the batch."
"1","5","A wonderful recipe. AMAZING CHOCOLATE COOKIE!"
"1","5","Very good cookies. Family loved them. I left out the nuts but I bet it would be great with them. If you love chocolate then you'll love these."
"1","5","great recipe, I added a cup of Ande's Peppermint chips and lazily put the whole thing in a 9x12, adjusted the cook time. They were chewy and minty, and GONE!"
"1","5","These are wonderful!!! My husband & 2 daughters can't get enough....I've made them 2x in 3 days!! The only change I did was to take the advice of someone and use 1/2c. margarine & 1/2 c. shortening. Thanks for the recipe!!!"
"1","5","These cookies are very tasty. The are very moist. i made 60 servings and the ingredients measurements were kindda funny + 1 tsp lol"
"1","5","Fantastic! Not too sweet and look and taste like they are store bought! My bf couldn't resist eating a second one after they came out of the oven."
"1","5","VERY GOOD COOKIES,I HAVE USED DIFFERENT CHIPS AND THE COOKIES ARE VERY GOOD EVERY TIME"
"1","5","Excellent! I sub. peppermint extract for vanilla and the only thing I can say is 'OOOOh mama!!!'"
"1","5","best cookie recipe ever!! they taste like subway cookies"
"1","5","These are so good. Everyone in my household loved them. Thank you for the wonderful chocolately sinful treats."
"1","5","This recipe is awesome. I made it with walnuts, but made no other changes. My entire family loved these!"
"1","5","Excellent cookie! I too made some changes though. I did leave out the nuts, and replaced with 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips, 3/4 cup semi-sweet chips, and 3/4 cup white chocolate chips. A+ recipe!"
"1","5","perfecto!  BUT i had much better texture (non-goopy-raw, even though who doesn't like brownie batter?) with 11-12 minutes of baking. perhaps because of my silicone baking pads? they became perfectly soft, chewy brownie-cookies - yum!!  i also used my usual mix of semi-sweet, milk & white chips"
"1","5","OMG!!! Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips to get a 'peanut butter cup' taste. These were awesome! Soft, good texture, and amazing taste! This is my new favorite cookie recipe!"
"1","5","I am 14 years old, and i made this recipe and thought it was delicous!!!! my siblings nicknamed them 'brownie cookies' because i left them in the oven for about 15 minutes and for some reason they tasted and looked doughy but had a crunchy edge which we loved. We couldn't stop eating them!!!"
"1","5","This recipe has made it into the family recipe book! Kathy You are now part of the Simoncini family. :)  Hint: add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and it just puts it over the edge! Add some coconut for a mounds deluxe!"
"1","5","i supervised a 7 year old in the making of these cookies. they were a hit!i ran out of sugar so i just used brown sugar.we made 6 huge cookies per pan . make these cookies you will love them!"
"1","5","These cookies were fantstic! I followed the recipe exactly and they are moist and chocolatey. 9 minutes in the oven is perfect. The cookies will be very soft when they come out, but they set up nicely.   I brought them to work for a party and they were inhaled - the first things to be finished even though I brought a lot of them!"
"1","5","These are some of the best cookies I've ever made. I made no changes to the recipe. They're so soft and yummy, that I'm making a second batch to give away, cause I'm too greedy to share my own batch. :)"
"1","5","These were awesome! A wonderful 'once a month' cookie for the ladies. =D~ I used mini semi sweet chips, peanut butter chips and some heath bits. I was cleaning out the baking cabinet and had a bit of each. I also used a half a cup of brown sugar in place of the white. Fabulous cookies! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","My family absolutely loved these cookies! My 4yo actually asked me to make these again instead of buying a very popular chocolate and creme centered cookie at the store.   I followed the directions exactly as written with one exception. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup vegetable shortening.   The cookies turned out soft and oh so full of chocolate! Absolutely delicious! A recipe I will make again and again."
"1","3","These cookies were just OK for me, but I experiment with a different cookie recipe almost daily lately, so I am little critical with cookie recipes. (I am on a baking kick). So in comparison with the other recipes that I have been making, this recipe was somewhere in the middle. It didn't really 'wow' me, but I have to say that if you are craving chocolate, this will definately take care of it. I recommend the minimum baking time. I left mine in a minute longer, and they were a little more crisp than I would have liked."
"1","5","I've made these cookies so many times... and every time it amazes me how fast they go!! I add dried cherries instead of the walnuts and they're so yummy!!!"
"1","4","Stayed nice and chewy! They made good ice cream sandwiches too."
"1","5","zomg i luvz these cookies! they r my bff yo"
"1","4","These were great! I used 60% cocoa chips. I only got 28 cookies though. I suppose if you made them small then you could get 48, but why make them small if you don't have to? :0) I baked them for 8 min and they were VERY soft. Anything less than 8 min they wouldn't hold their shape. These would be freaking awsome with peanut butter chips too!"
"1","4","Bust out the milk for these yummy cookies! They taste great, being chewy on the inside. :)"
"1","5","Very very good! Exactly 8 minutes gave a crispy outside and gooey inside. I did half vanilla extract and half mint extract (1 tsp each) and used mini York peppermint patty baking bits instead of chips. It's chocolate, it's peppermint, it's delicious, it's very refreshing!"
"1","5","These are delicious! They set up nicely and stay soft, which is just how I like cookies! I used dark chocolate cocoa powder and they had a really nice deep chocolate flavor. Me and my husband can't stay out of them!"
"1","5","These cookies were very good--came out soft and chewy. I used half brown sugar, half white, only because I couldn't imagine a chocolate chip cookie without brown sugar! I dropped each cookie by a teaspoon into a 'chunky ball' and cooked them for exactly 8 minutes, every batch. They don't spread much--which makes them thicker and very tasty!"
"1","5","Amazing!"
"1","5","these were excellent! took them to a biblestudy and everyone loved them!"
"1","4","Flavor was chocolatey and delicious, however, I had issues with the actual structure of the cookie. I followed the recipe as written (though after reading a few other reviews wish I had reduced the fat), and the dough was really sticky. I baked the cookies for 10 minutes and let them cool on the pan, but they fell apart very easily (from being too soft). After the first two batches I added about 1/3 C. more flour, then the cookies wouldn't spread (they just came out little half-spheres). I think it's a recipe worth tweaking since the taste is so good, but as written I can only give it four stars."
"1","5","I was a little worried about the amount of cocoa in this recipe. I thought that it might make the cookies taste bitter but when they came out of the oven, they were perfect! I also used half chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips which balanced out the chocolate taste. These are cookies that I will for sure make again."
"1","5","It was too dry to stir, so I added a bit of water and vegetable oil, no biggy. They were absolutely delicious!"
"1","5","these cookies are amazing!!! if you are craving a chocolate fix, look no further! the only thing i did different was added 1/4 c. of flour (as they seemed really runny), cooked on parchment paper, and used a cookie scooper as they were pretty sticky. try these cookies as you won't be dissapointed!!! thanks for sharing this recipe."
"1","5","A Chocoholic's DREAM! THANK-YOU! I used all brown sugar...other than that, followed the recipe...beat the butter/sugar mixture a long time - the result was a PERFECT chocoholic cookie! I bet they taste great from the freezer...sure tasted awesome from the oven! Bless you!"
"1","5","This is divine. My lovely sister searched the internet for me and found it.. I played with it a little, trying to cut down on some fat, calories and carbs, so I used sifted soy flour, 1 stick butter and one half pint size promise, white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, chopped walnuts and baking powder. I also used brown sugar, I really just threw ingredients in a bowl and came out with another version of this, it was so delish I couldn't resist eating a big honkin spoonful of batter with a big cup of low fat milk. Spray your pan with Canola oil. One of the best cookies I've ever had, I make them big so only two side by side on the cookie sheet otherwise they slide into each other. Best thing about these cookies, I'm the only one in the house that eats walnuts. Hehehehee"
"1","5","The best cookies ever. These were so soft and chocolaty."
"1","5","Made these for a party and guests were eating them off of the sheet as they came out of the oven. Followed the recipe as written except I had refrigerated the dough so had to bake them a few minutes longer. Once cooled they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a great chocolate flavor - this one's a keeper!"
"1","5","These were very good. I made one version without nuts and one with nuts. I received a lot of compliments for these!"
"1","3","The only real issue I had with these cookies is that 2 cups of flour was not enough. I added at least 1 1/2 cups extra. A decent cookie."
"1","4","I make these all the time, for home, school, or any event. They are delicious out of the oven, but don't keep for very long. Best eat them in the first day or two."
"1","5","This recipe is Perfect! I used macadamia nuts as they were a special request from a coworker, what a hit. =)Everyone loved them and I will use this recipe again and again."
"1","1","These came out very flat and without any great choc chip cookie flavor. I won't make them again."
"1","5","These are the BEST chocolate cookies I have ever made or had! I doubled the recipe and it made over 7 dozen! I used mini Reese's pieces in place of the chips. I was a bit short on the cocoa, so I melted unsweetened baking chocolate for the difference. (1 block + 1 Tbl shortening for 3 Tbl cocoa) I had to bake 9 min. 8 min was still a bit doughy in the middle. Highly recommend this recipe!"
"1","5","These are really good cookies!! They are so simple to make, and they taste great! I doubled the amount of vanilla called for (I always do – it’s just my personal preference) and I used M&M’s instead of chocolate chips, they look cute and very festive for Christmas cookies. I have also made these with white chocolate chips and walnuts and they look and taste like bakery quality cookies ? Thanks for the recipe !!"
"1","5","These where the best Chocolate chip Cookies I have ever had. My Family loved them to. Thank YOU so much for sharing it with us, its in our recipe box for good."
"1","5","YUMMY!! These were great. Didn't use any nuts and changed the choco chips to peanut butter chips and they were delicious! Thanks"
"1","5","I made these with my grandson and they were delicious. He could not stop eating them and wanted to take the recipe to his mother."
"1","5","WOW. I jazzed it up for Christmas by using chopped dark Toblerone instead of chocolate chips, and no walnuts. They are the best chocolate cookie I've ever made. I'm sure with the choc. chips it would still be exceptional!!"
"1","5","Thanks for this recipe. These cookies are absolutely delicious!!!!"
"1","5","Turned out VERY well! I don't like chocolate chocolate chip cookies, but these were great! Nice and fudgy. My husband wanted white chips in them, so I did half white half semi sweet. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","So delicious and chocolatey. I like crispy cookies so I had to bake them about twice as long, they definitely were still raw on the inside at 10 minutes. I also used all butter (no shortening) so they really spread out. But if you're a chocolate lover these really hit the spot!"
"1","5","Excellent. These taste like brownies. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper, then baked for 12 minutes. Let cool on the sheets for a minute or 2. 8-10 minutes isn't long enough baking time."
"1","5","These were delicious. I baked them on a stoneware pan and had to bake them for about 13-15 minutes. Batches that were cooked with a shorter time were plump when I took them out, but then flattened and crumbled when cool. With the longer baking time they were perfect."
"1","4","Mine definitely needed longer to cook - about 5 minutes more than suggested. The few that I manage to prise off my kids tasted great!"
"1","5","This recipe is to die for! soo sinful. I ran out of white sugar, so I subtituted in 1/2 cup of brown and it turned out great. I also put in a mix of semi-sweet chocolate chips, chopped dark chocolate and milk chocolate as well the walnuts. They turned out moist just like the recipe said. Best chocolate chip cookies I have ever baked."
"1","5","My son loved them they are so soft and chewy..Everyone loved them..I substituted chocolate chips and used chocolate M&M's instaed a true chocolate candy induldgence..Love them must try this recipe..."
"1","5","Incredible! Wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","5","These are amazingly chocolately!! The only change I made was using half browna nd half white sugar. Perfect for any chocoholic!!"
"1","4","Oh Soo Good! Also Try making them with peanut butter and chocolate swirl chips! Yummyness!"
"1","5","Fantastic! I love that they stay soft & chewy."
"1","5","This is the BEST Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookies recipe there is. Just Try!"
"1","5","We used white chocolate swirl chips, which probably only makes a slight difference, but they were amazing."
"1","5","Very Easy to make, my girl's group made it as a team. Cookies are very very very soft and very yummy... Definitly doing this again and again!"
"1","5","Delicious. I needed a recipe that didn't use brown sugar because I didn't have any at the time, and these cookies came out wonderful. I followed the directions exactly, but of course everyone's oven is different... therefore, different baking times! Just make sure to watch your cookies, and you'll be fine. The cookies were moist, very chocolatey (which I loved, but some people said they were TOO chocolatey... pffft). ;o) Thank you for the recipe! [Recipe Box]"
"1","5","Fantastic recipe!! These stayed soft for over a week and tasted just as fresh as the day they were baked."
"1","5","I used Ghirardelli brand semisweet cocoa powder and semisweet chocolate chips along with plain margarine sticks instead of butter. THESE COOKIES ARE SO DELICIOUS THEY'RE STUPID!!! Best cookie recipe on this site, hands down.  Edit: All this time I've been using margarine instead of butter, but today I finally used butter and margarine at once plus chocolate chunks and these cookies are even better!!! Who knew that was possible? YUMMY!!!"
"1","5","Great cookie recipe-destined to be a family favorite- tied with good old chocolate chip cookies."
"1","4","very tasty. but i made a few healthy changes. i used 1/2 the amount of butter, 2/3 of the sugar, less salt, and about 1/2 of the chocolate chips. and i also used mostly whole wheat flour rather than all-purpose. and the cookies came out GREAT. next time, i want to use walnuts."
"1","4","Very good. But not excellent. I got closer to 60 smaller cookies. They are pretty soft and delicate and very chocolatey, almost like brownies in flavour but certainly moist and tender after 9-10 mins in a preheated 350 oven on light non-stick pans. I only used half a regular sized bag of chocolate chips (maybe about 1 cup is all I had) and did not think it needed more. My daughter (2.5yrs) loved them so much she stole a fourth cookie after I told her to wait until later to have another and refused to give it up and totally mashed it in her hand as I tried to take it away. Then she tried to eat the crumbs off the floor..."
"1","5","These are great. Similar to the Chewy Brownie Cookies...good when you don't have shortening on hand. These disappeared instantly! I put in semi-sweet and white chocolate chips and they were beautiful and delicious"
"1","5","I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and they came out perfectly. Delicious chocolate flavor, soft, decadent!"
"1","4","This is a very nice recipe. This was my first time making chocolate chocolate chip cookies. My family is loving them."
"1","5","I followed this recipe to a T and they were perfect! Very best I've ever had."
"1","5","these cookies were very choclatey. the baking time was short tho for me. it took about 20minutes. but otherwise, very good cookies."
"1","5","Mmmmm, these are awesome!! I added white chocolate chips and semisweet. Delicious!!!!!"
"1","5","These cookies are so good!! They are so easy to make and they taste absolutely delicious! I made them with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, soooo good!!"
"1","5","Just made these and they were SUPER!!! Made them for a friends B-Day. I asked her what she wanted, and she said Choc. Choc. chip. She was not dissapointed thanks"
"1","5","I thought these were great. I cooked them on a stone and had to leave them in the oven an extra 5 minutes. I made ice cream sandwiches with them. They were delicious. This is the first cookie my husband gave 5 stars."
"1","5","When I made these tasty cookies, I used all organic ingrediants and substituted the regular all purpose flour for Whole Wheat flour and it really gave it a nice and hearty taste! I noticed that my dark cookie sheets burned these cookies much quicker than usual, just something to think about when making them! This is a great recipe! No wonder all the great ratings! Enjoy them! We did!"
"1","5","OK to Good, I thought they were a little salty, and not all that sweet. UPDATE: I first reviewed these while hot out of the oven, Give them a little time and they are wonderful!"
"1","5","These are very good. My wife and daughter both say they're the best I've made! Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome!! Tastes just like soft brownies!! Will make again!"
"1","5","My kids would give these cookies 6 stars if they could. I was glad some people warned me about the extremely thick battter, if not, I too, would have thought I had messed up royally. I also did as others suggested and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I cooked for the full 10 minutes and they turned out great!! I like them right out of the oven because then the middle is like a brownie. But they are still very good later too."
"1","5","Ask my eldest son what cookies he would like me to bake this week for school lunches, chocolate chip was the one, stumbled across this reciepe, followed the tips about brown sugar. This is cookie is yummy, I have already had two cookies to eat, just enough chocolate flavour to satisfy my chocolate cravings. I am positive my kids will love these cookies and my husband , who loves chocolate just as much as I do. Will keep this receipe"
"1","5","I cant seem to get enough of these cookies if there were more stars i would give more"
"1","5","I took these cookies to a kids Valentines dance and served them another time to my hubby's friends. The plate was cleared within 10 minutes of being at the dance and my hubby's friends comments were 'mmmmm, is it ok if I have more?' We love them! Thank you for the recipe."
"1","5","Soo good, although I made some changes :) First I used VERY good quality cocoa (from Williams & Sonoma), Decreased the flour by 1/8 cup, Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Creamed the butter and sugar first then added eggs and vanilla. I then added about 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. I then baked the cookie at 325 for 9 minutes. It was like a decadent chocolate brownie in a cookie form!"
"1","3","These were just okay. They actually tasted a lot like brownies. Nobody asked me to make them again like they do with a lot of the 5 star recipes from this site so I was suprised. I'll try tweaking the recipe a bit next time."
"1","5","THE BEST COOKIES I'VE EVER MADE!!THANK FOR SHARING THE RECIPE!"
"1","4","Ok, so until I make these as written, I can't fully give 5 stars. Instead, I have to admit that I love the versatility of this recipe. I only made a half batch and I substituted peanut butter for cocoa, and used butterscotch and dark chocolate chips...YUMMY! Will keep making these (this is my 2nd batch in 2 weeks!)."
"1","5","I made these for my class and they absolutely loved them. It made quite a bit so I had a few left over to offer some adults I teach with and they all demanded the recipe. Excellent."
"1","4","These were delicious but a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I will add half the amount of sugar to these."
"1","5","Everybody loves these! They're like brownies and cookies at the same time. Don't overcook..."
"1","5","These cookies came out really well. I got the best results when I took the cookies out of the oven appearing slightly underbaked. They were still soft for a few days in an airtight container."
"1","4","I realized half way through making these that I didn't have any cocoa powder. I left it out and they still turned out like perfect chocolate chip cookies. I'm impressed!"
"1","5","Read the reviews and had to make them. Wow!! What a powerful punch of chocolate in a small cookie. It's a great turn on the traditional chocolate chip cookie."
"1","5","So good. They were fluffy and chewy, just how I love them. I did 1/2 c butter flavored shortening and 1/2 c butter just for fun. I am sure they would have been fabulous even w/ just butter, as in the original recipe."
"1","5","Very good cookies. I deviated from the reciple a little; used 1 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar, omitted the nuts, and used some very pretty mint chocolate swirled chips. They were quite good, soft in the middle and a little crunchy on the edges."
"1","5","My husband said these were the best cookies he ever had! Need I say more? I would give these 10 Stars if I could. I like to use the chocolate chunks instead of chips. Also very good with peanutbutter chips or white chocolate chips & macadamia nuts! Be sure not to overcook."
"1","3","I followed this recipe exactly and they baked nicely, great texture and great flavor but after a couple of days of being stored in a zip lock bag they became very dry and crumbly. I threw out half of the batch, they were falling apart."
"1","5","Perfect! So glad I made these....kids love them, I love them, husband loved them. I would not change a thing! Perfect!!!"
"1","5","These are without any doubt the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. And they stay soft too! I skipped the walnuts. The cookies taste great without them."
"1","5","I made these for my husband's coworkers, and they LOVED them. I personally thought they would be more chocolatey. I substituted half brown sugar and half white like many had written, maybe that's why I thought it wasn't sweet enough. I'll try it the regular way next time. These are great with a tall cold glass of milk!"
"1","5","These were delicious!! It was like chocolate decadence!! I did use white and brown sugar instead of all white like others suggested. I also use 1 cup of cocoa, sweetens them up just a little more. I baked for only 8 minutes and let them stay on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing them to cooling rack. They came out perfectly, not burned on the bottom and very moist. Kept them in a sealed plastic tub and were still fresh 5 days later!! My son pops them in them in the micro for about 10 seconds to get them warm again and eats them with a cold glass of milk!! Delicious!!!"
"1","5","So good, i was looking for a cookie like this one that was soft and gooey. My family loves them, i baked them for the holidays and my husband keeps taking them to work and i have had to make 2 more batches! Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"1","5","yummy cookies. I leave out the chocolate (its too sweet) and use half shortending and mostly brown sugar and butter)"
"1","5","This was delicious! However, I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and only 1 cup of sugar."
"1","5","This recipe is wonderful!! I actually lost it for awhile and couldn't remember the recipe's name. I used other similar recipes and nothing came close to this one. Everytime we make this, we get requests to make it again!"
"1","5","I was looking for another cookie and came across this one. It is delicious. So chocolaty! I will absolutely make this one again!"
"1","5","Very good! I added some peanut butter as well; like a brownie in the form of a cookie :)"
"1","5","These are really delicious! I did as others said on their reviews to use half granulated sugar and half brown sugar. I will definitely make these again!"
"1","5","I made these for my daughter's fund raiser and they SOLD OUT!! Everyone LOVED them! I have another fund raiser this weekend so this is for sure on my list of items to bake! Thanks!"
"1","4","This was a nice soft cookie, however not as much chocolate taste as I expected."
"1","5","I also made this with half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also, peanuts make such a great addition to these cookies! I was bummed to pull out my walnuts to discover they had gone rancid. I desperately wanted nuts in my cookies, so I searched my pantry for any type of nuts I could find. The only thing I had was roasted salted peanuts, so I rubbed as much salt off as possible and added them to my cookies. I got rave reviews at my church picnic!"
"1","5","these are the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. They were a big hit with my family and coworkers. Thanks!"
"1","4","this cookie was not as 'rich' as everyone made it out to be, as a chocoholic I was hopeing it was going to be as rich as a brownie the way people talk. and its not.. but they still tasted good I saw many people say that they dry out fast, if you store them in an air tight container they will stay soft and moist for DAYS!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","Oh my goodness are these ever GREAT!!!! If you are a chocoholic you will love these. Thank you for the recipe Kathy...I will be making these often Im sure!"
"1","5","I really like this cookie. But I used half sugar/half brown sugar, like my traditional c.c. cookie recipe. I also baked them at 375 degrees instead of 350, as I do not care much for chewy cookies. Will definately be making these again!"
"1","4","So yummy! Very very rich but very tasty. Best right out of the oven! But definitely halve the recipe -- this makes SO MANY COOKIES!"
"1","2","texture was nice but not as chocolatley rich as i had hoped. plus these cookies go stale VERY fast! eat same day as you make them!"
"1","5","Excellent recipes. VERY chocolatey. My kids loved them, and I loved them. My husband said they were 'too' chocolatey (as if!!). He thought they would be good with peanut butter chips in place of the chocolate chips.  I left the cookies in for 9 minutes and they were perfect. Chewy and soft!"
"1","4","Cookies stayed soft and chewy. Very chocolatey. Thank you for posting."
"1","5","We LOVE these cookies! We think they are WONDERFUL! My Dad isn't a cookie fan, but he LOVED these!"
"1","5","wow!!! absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS!! best cookie i've ever had!  looked undercooked out of the oven, but real nice, moist and thick after cooling. add some mint chips for a nice twist. :)"
"1","5","This is one of my most favorite cookie recipes!! Thank-you! I used pecans instead of walnuts and baked the cookies for 13 minutes. They were delicious! My kids and husband ate them as fast as they came out of the oven."
"1","5","They came out very soft and fudge-like. They will satisfy your chocolate cravings! I had to send them away with some people because my chocoholic husband kept eating them."
"1","3","I used half brown and half white sugar and might have used a bit more cocoa powder than needed. They were a real chocolate bomb, so rich even I couldn't eat more then one in one go. My friends ate them, but said they were just ok"
"1","5","So yummy and soft a huge hit in this house"
"1","5","great cookies i reduced the cocoa to 1/3 cup and used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white sugar and used smarties instead of chocolate chips they turned out very moist and chewy-just the way our family likes them-yummy!!"
"1","5","These were delicious! My 13 y.o. daughter, who never tries to cook ANYTHING came home one afternoon and wanted to bake storebought cookie dough, only to find out that it had been in the fridge too long, and gotten dry. She asked for a recipe. I found this one, printed and gave it to her. She made them all by herself. I was really worried about how they would turn out because she wasn't worried at all about being precise with the amounts! LOL! I really believe this is the first time she has EVER made anything with a recipe by herself! They came out wonderfully and she was SO proud of her cookies! Thanks!"
"1","3","These cookies were a little dry and the chocolate flavor was not great - I used Hershey's cocoa."
"1","4","In an attempt to soften the butter, we melted it. We used it anyway and just added a little more flower to compensate. The cookies actually turned out really good. Soft and chewy. We used white chocolate chip cookies."
"1","5","inspiring"
"1","4","Another hit at the fire academy! The recruits ate them all, and the only complaint my husband heard, was that he didn't bring enough! Next time, I'll make them a bit larger, though - I dropped them onto the cookie sheet with a rounded teaspoon - and they came out 'bite sized.' Next time I'll add a little extra dough!"
"1","5","One of the BEST cookie recipes I have ever made. I used only 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown like other people suggested. Instead of nuts I added coconut. I also store mine in a tin instead of a Tupperware container. If there are any leftovers to store that is. These will sure dissapear fast!"
"1","5","We couldn't stay away from these. After their first bite my kids said this is to die for. Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe!"
"1","4","Great cookies. everyone loved them! They almost have a brownie like consistency. Thanks!"
"1","5","This is a fabulous chocolate chocolate chip recipe! I make it frequently.   The only change I make on a regular basis is to substitute 1/2 c. of the white sugar with brown sugar. I think this give it a little more rounded-out flavor.   I also usually use 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour and don't notice any change in flavor at all (this is an easy way to add nutrients to any dish).  It's great as-is though, the whole family will love it! Everyone in the house thinks these are great cookies."
"1","5","These cookies are delicious! I substituted mint M&Ms in Christmas colors and they were the favorite cookie this Christmas."
"1","4","MUST LOVE CHOCOLATE!!!"
"1","4","realy chewy and moist"
"1","5","Love this recipe. Didn't taste the best right out of the oven and I thought they were too doughy. I added about 4 minuits to the time and they turned out fantastic. just need to let them cool."
"1","3","After baking half of the cookies, I decided to add flour since they were so flat. Next time I will add 1 cup to the whole batch. The second half was much better. These were good, but the I actually like the recipe I had better. If I had nothing to compare these to, they might get a better rating."
"1","5","These are awesome!! I didn't have any nuts to put in them but they were still really really good. I am a chocoholic and these really hit the spot. Defintately need a glass of milk with these."
"1","5","Wow these were phenomenally good! I didn't have chocolate chips but was craving chocolate big time. I used vegetable margarine for butter and egg replacer for the eggs because I'm adopting a vegan diet (although I did use white sugar) and rolled them into balls flattening with a fork and they taste great! I ate 7 today! My two male non-vegan roomies loved them too! Thanks a bunch! :)"
"1","5","I really enjoyed these cookies. I used milk chocolate chips as that is all I had. Everyone enjoyed them! Thanks for the great recipe."
"1","5","easy to make and really good"
"1","5","This is a great cookie recipe if you LOVE chocolate. It was fantastic. I did use milk chocolate chips because my husband doesn't like semi-sweet. I didn't think it was too chocolatey. I had to bake the whole 10 minutes and I let it cool on the baking sheet a couple minutes before transferring to cooling rack. It made 3.5 dozen cookies for me."
"1","5","These are wonderful! I cooked the 1st batch a little longer before i realized they needed to cool, to crisp up. I will make these again for sure :)"
"1","5","I only used 1 1/4 cup sugar and left them in for 10 mins and they still turned out super. Next time I'll take them out at 8 mins so they're not as dry. Somehow half the tray was gone b4 my kids got home from school!"
"1","5","The recipe I've been looking for! These were delicious - soft, a bit chewy, very chocolately without being bitter. They weren't overly sweet, and they did a great job carrying milk chocolate M&Ms. They do seem a little sensitive to baking times, though, because a little too long and they get dry. Take them out when they're set but still soft for them to be perfect.  Will make this again and again! Thank you!"
"1","5","What can I say.....AMAZING!! I always use the 'old stand by' recipes but wanted something new. Well these will be made a lot!! Only thing I did different was I changed the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips. I didn't have enough chocolate chips on hand lol! BRAVO!!"
"1","5","very good! We used Halloween chips (had orange colored white chocolate and chocolate chips) and they tasted great. I can't help but wonder how the peanut butter chips or the new mini mini peanut butter cups would taste...i am thinking yummy!"
"1","5","My 8 year odl daughter and I cannot get enough of these! They are especially devine if you eat them while they are still warm! We did leave the mini M&MS out because there was already so much chocolate and they turned out amazing."
"1","5","These cookies are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!!! My new favorites, for sure! They are soft and chewy and just plain delicious! Highly recommend! I cut the sugar to only 1 cup, and they are GREAT!! Thanks so much :)"
"1","3","Made the recipe as stated, scaled it to make half. Nice dough. Did not care for the flavor though. Too much vanilla falvor & over all they were way too sweet. Would not make again."
"1","2","I am not sure if the consistency was right. I switched the recipe to bake half and it came out too runny. It sounded like a great cookie, I might have to try again for the full amount."
"1","5","I almost ate the whole bowl of batter before I baked them! YUMMY!!!!!"
"1","5","This cookie is quickly becoming one of my most requested recipes. I've made it for a girls' softball team, bake sales and family get-togethers. It tastes like a brownie. Make sure to bake them long enough otherwise they fall apart. I always add Mini M&Ms as well as the chocolate chips! Absolutely sinful!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely the cure for PMS! You can never have too much chocolate in my book. I added mini m&ms instead of nuts! Thanks a bunch!"
"1","5","Great cookie! I used whole wheat flour and didn't add the nuts. They turned out great! My children ate them up! I will make this one again!!"
"1","5","THESE COOKIES ARE THE BEST CHOCOLATE COOKIES EVER!!!! i'm allergic to nuts so i don't put in any nuts but these are the best!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!!!!!"
"1","4","this recipe was fantastico... i eat them when i where a banana on my head. these cookies inspire me to wear a bathing suit. i hope you are inspired by these cookies!"
"1","5","The best double chocolate chip recipe I've tried. Cookies come out moist and chewy and they don't thin and flatten out too much like some other cookie recipes. A keeper for sure."
"1","5","Our favorite from now on. Per other reviews I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco, 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown, decreased the cocoa by 2 T. and baked 8 min. with 2 min. to cool on the sheet. They were gooey and soft. Did flatten out some, just what we wanted. We don't care for the more cake type that are mounded. These won't last long, thanks Kathy."
"1","2","I followed the recipe except for substituting some cocoa powder for chocolate powder.   The mixture was very very sticky but not dry. When baking, the cookies starting expanding and deforming and soon all of them were stuck together. I find the cookies quite tasty but way too sweet and they're very flat and chewy like cake =("
"1","5","We renamed this the PMS cookie. Excellent for the chocolate craver or lover. To those who are finding the cookie dries out, the secret is to bake them the least amount of time and then to immediately put them in an airtight container as soon as they are completely cooled."
"1","5","I have been reading the reviews of this cookie recipe and can't believe some people thought they were dry. I did have one problem when making them -- they were sooo soft when they came out of the oven and I tried to take them off the cookie sheet before they were cool. Not a good idea, because they were too soft. I found that I had to bake them a little longer than the 8-10 min. suggested, but every oven is different. I was afraid they would be too chocolaty so cut down on the cocoa powder by a tablespoon or so, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll use the full cocoa powder amount, as they were not too chocolaty. They were very easy, very moist, and were absolutely delish!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!"
"1","5","Excellent cookies. The only alterations I made were to use 1 stick of butter plus 1 stick of Nucoa margarine and substituting brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the sugar called for. These have a nice chewy/crisp texture - very rich."
"1","5","these ROCK!!! when you need chocolate, these are it! i usually make them small, so i can justify eating a few... ;0)"
"1","5","These were great! I didnt think id like them, i usually dont like cookies, but these came out soft and chewy, aven after being in the fridge for a whole night. I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar (my son insisted), and left out the nuts- were not big on crunchy cookies. I only make a dozen at a time and keep the rest in the fridge, its kept for 4 days very well."
"1","5","These are wonderful! I used 1/2c margarine, 1/2 butter shortening, as well as 1/2 cake flour since I ran out of all-purpose. They are such an indulgence! Great recipe!"
"1","5","I copied this recipe yesterday and then made them today. I read quite a few of the reviews and decided to use 1/2 c butter & 1/2 c butter flavoured shortening, as is my practice when preparing regular chocolate chip cookies. I also used 1/2 c packed brown sugar and 1 c white sugar. I remembered reviews that these cookies can be dry when I had finished mixing the batter and realized that even the batter is stiff and dry. I decided to add a heaping tablespoon of liquid honey, which I made sure to incorporate well. I was worried but OMG these cookies were excellent. I always get complements on my cookies, but just as Kathy reported, people said I should sell these!! Thanks Kathy!"
"1","5","Terrific chocolate cookie. I made them for a group of friends and there were none left over. Easy and delicious recipe!"
"1","5","I made these cookies for my boyfriend's office, and they were a HUGE hit. They wouldn't stop praising him (he lied and said he made them). They have an amazing brownie-like texture that stays moist. Simply delicious.   When I made them, I ran out of bittersweet morsels, so I used up some peanut butter and butterscotch morsels I had. I would not recommend using the butterscotch because it was too sweet for such a rich cookie. Next time it will just be the bittersweet chocolate and some nuts. Also, be sure to let them cool completely before you move them around too much. They are very, very soft and prone to breaking apart when they first come out the oven. 9 minutes was perfect for my baking time."
"1","4","Made over the weekend for tins as Christmas gifts. I like these well enough, made them exactly as written. I doubt I would be in a giant rush to make them again though. But thank you."
"1","5","These cookies are terrific. I have tried adding dried cranberries and white chocolate chips, which turns makes a somewhat sophisticated cookie, as well as reeces pieces and white chocolate chips - also very yummy!"
"1","5","These are the best cookies ever! I have stopped my cookie search here. Thanks for the great recipe. I havent let my kids try them yet because I want them all for myself. :) But I am sure they will love them as much as I do!"
"1","5","These cookies are wonderful! I will DEFINITELY make these again."
"1","5","Excellent cookies- Easy to make and delicious! Thanks"
"1","5","Great cookies! I made them with peanut butter rather than chocolate chips and they turned out wonderfully, despite using 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c vegetable oil spread (I'm a butter snob usually!). Will use again."
"1","5","loved these cookies. Substituted 'Andies' mint chips for the chocolate chips and left out the nuts. Yummy."
"1","5","I added white chocolate chips as well. Dee-lish! Very easy and quick to make."
"1","5","these cookies are like moist, gooey brownies. Delicious!"
"1","5","Per previous suggestions, I used 1/2 c. butter-flavored shortening and 1/2 c. butter to try and retain moisture. I also used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar. The cookies turned out great - wonderful taste! Be careful not to overbake (8 minutes was definitely enough). Also, eat quickly; they get just a little dry in the days after they're made - even if they're sealed up."
"1","5","The BEST chocolate chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Not too sweet, just perfect!"
"1","4","Being in the UK the ingredients differed slightly. I used a salted butter and ommited the salt. Then I had 50% more butter and then they were perfect. Soft and chewy! If any English people make these cookies I suggest you use anchor butter and cut chunks of bournville © I found that worked well! I will definately add this one to the recipe book."
"1","5","Very good - simple easy to follow recipe. Delicious chocolatey cookies, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - will definitely make again. I am freezing these for use in school lunches."
"1","5","Very, very good! They were cake like and very moist. If you don't like an all chocolate and soft cookie then these are not for you. If you can't get enough of chocolate like me then try these. Easy to put together in no time. Next time I want to try adding peanut butter chips!"
"1","5","Fabulous recipe! Everyone raves about them at gatherings and they are super easy to make."
"1","5","I added Peanut Butter chips and they were delicous!! I took the chocolate chips and put half of what it says and added the other half left for peanut butter chips!"
"1","4","Good soft cocoa-chocolate chips cookies. They're very quick and easy to prepare."
"1","5","This is an excellent cookie recipe for chocolate lovers! My 1 year old is a picky eater and absolutly loved it! I added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips for a different twist. (Instead of 2 cups chocolate chips.) Thanks for a fabulous recipe! We will be making this cookie recipe again!"
"1","2","These cookies didn't meet my expectations. The were 'ok' when they first came out of the oven, but after a few hours, they just weren't that tasty. I will not be making these again and continue searching for the best cookie recipe."
"1","5","Funny story behind this... Being new to cooking from scratch, I'm not yet familiar with what you can (or can't) substitute in terms of ingredients. When I first tried this recipie, I didn't have cocoa powder, so I figured I'd use some vanilla malted milk instead. Ouch. I'm sure all the experienced cooks out there are rolling their eyes at my mistake. For future refrence... don't use malted milk in cookies. I then tried the recipie again when I got some cocoa powder and WOW! Super soft, chewy, melt in your mouth good! I love this recipie, especially now since I have a funny story to go with them now! lol I have since used powdered chocolate Ovaltine in place of the cocoa powder and it was equally as delicious. YUMMY! Thanks :)"
"1","5","wouldnt change a thing! i did bake them the full 11 minutes at 350 and my oven tends to be true."
"1","5","These cookies were 'melt in your mouth' gooey right out of the oven. They were best the first day but were still tasty the second. They were a definite hit with my husband and kids. Next time I will try milk chocolate chips."
"1","5","I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of 1/2 of white sugar and melted the butter. I added 1/2 cup of mint chocolate chips. This is a great recipe. My boyfriend loves them."
"1","5","Excellent! Chocolatey and delicious. Great for days afterwards. Stayed chewey and tasty! Great work!"
"1","5","This recipe was YUMMY!! The cookies tasted like soft chocolately brownies. I added milk chocolate candy bar (chopped) instead of walnuts. I will definately make again and again!"
"1","5","MMMMM GOOD! These cookies are so incredible. So rich and lucious. They are very soft and gooey. I added even more chocolate chips for some extra mmmmm! I would recomend this recipe to anyone who loves chocolate."
"1","5","Wonderful cookies! They hardly spread at all resulting in a chewy, rich, thick, perfect cookie. I used half butter, half margarine and they turned out great."
"1","5","excellent"
"1","5","These are great. I had no chocolate chips, so did them without them and powdered them with confectioners' sugar when they were done. Looked nice and Christmassy :) A friend said they could have been sweeter and that he'd have added more powdered sugar to the batter, maybe that is worth a try -- I kind of liked them as a more dark-chocolate flavour though. Keeping this recipe, may try it with white chocolate chips some time."
"1","5","Perfect in every way. They are the best!!! We left out the nuts and used gourmet cocoa. Man are they good!!"
"1","5","yummy yum yum... they were easy and my kids could help, finally a recipe w/out having to melt chocolate! Thanks"
"1","5","VERY GOOD!! Me and my 8 year old twin girls had a blast making these and they are disappearing out of the cookie jar quickly!!"
"1","5","great cookie"
"1","5","MMMMMMM Perfect Chocolate Cookies!! Tried these cookies with semi sweet chocolate chunks. These cookies are definately for the chocoholic cookie monster (s) in your family. Cookies were soft in texture and chocolatey, much like a brownie. I rate these a 10+. They were absolutly wonderful, even the next day if they last that long. :)"
"1","3","I just made these cookies and they are like little brownies. Mine didn't flatten out and they are very cake like. The chocolate factor is right on though. When I make cookies I want a cookie, not a little brownie. The flavor was good, but I will keep looking."
"1","5","Absolutely fantastic. I needed the chocolate chips for another recipe so I added Reese's Pieces instead. Even better than they would have been I'll bet. I found a time of 8 minutes just right for small cookies (level tablespoon) and a bit longer for bigger cookies. For small cookies you can probably get 6 dozen out of the recipe, I ended up doing about 2 dozen small ones then making the cookies a bit bigger. Ended up with a total of 52 cookies"
"1","5","These cookies came out so good! my whole family loves them and they are still chewy the next day."
"1","5","These cookies are excellent - not only the flavor, but also the texture. Very moist and chewy."
"1","5","I made these for the high school students I'm teaching and they were all very very enthusiastic about the cookies. They just melt in the mouth! I used Nestle Chocolate Chunks. I also reduced the recipe by 3/4 and it worked just fine. This recipe is a winner!"
"1","5","These are great cookies for chocolate lovers! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white, and used whole wheat for 1 cup of the flour (NO ONE noticed!). Try Ghiradelli double chocolate chips for a really chocolately treat."
"1","5","Really good! I lined my cookie sheets with foil which really helped because these cookies are very delicate when they come out of the oven. It helps to let them sit for 5 minutes on the sheet before trying to remove them. I used chopped large milk and dark chocolate candy bars instead of chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. These are like chewy, crispy brownies. YUM!"
"1","5","WOW. These were fantastic. Definitely fits the bill when you need a quick chocolate fix."
"1","3","These did not turn out so well for me. I'm sure it was more me than the recipe though. I don't think I will try these again for my own self esteem issues!"
"1","5","Really chocolatey....its a hit with my family !!"
"1","5","These are so addictive! Very delicious. I melted the butter slightly to make the cookies a little more chewy. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!!! :)"
"1","5","outstanding recipe. these worked really well with white chocolate chips."
"1","5","OH MY GOSH! These cookies are the tasting cookie ever. I was concerned they were too gooey after 10 minutes of baking but I let them cool slightly before removing them from the pan. They turned out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. I difinately will make them again and again and again. You have to try these!"
"1","5","These cookies are good. I'm sure they would have been better if I had used real chocolate chips as opposed to the reduced fat ones with Salatrim. I added pecans to this recipe and they added to the flavor. Perhaps next time I make these cookies I will add apple sauce or something to make them more moist--because they get dry after a day--which makes them taste like really good biscotti."
"1","4","A very good recipe"
"1","5","These cookies are awesome! They were also quick and easy enough to make so that my 3 month old was entertained during the whole process! Thank you!"
"1","5","Great recipe! The cookies are moist, light, and there is just the right amount of chocolate."
"1","5","These cookies are the best! I could just eat the dough, but my husband prefered them cooked."
"1","5","THESE COOKIES ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER TASTED!!! I bake a lot and these cookies were by far the best. Very chewy and moist but not gooey. Extremely easy to make. I added 1/2 cup sliced almonds instead of the walnuts. The cookies were gone in 1 day!! Thank you for this recipe--it is a definate keeper in my file. I wish I could give it more stars."
"1","5","I loved them and the kids did too. EXCELLENT!"
"1","5","I found the recipe very good and will make it again . It gives the chocolate lover just enough of a chocolate fix to make one happy. My husband has a nice smile on his face. It also has a nice cake like texture inside. Thank you for this recipe . Ally 2"
"1","5","my housemates- who are the willing guinea pigs of my overzealous and sometimes disastrous baking have deemed these the nbest creation yet. i predict they will be gone before the night is over."
"1","5","Man, these cookies are a serious recumbentibus! Trust me, I'm no ultracrepidarian on the subject of cookies."
"1","5","Great cookie! I used a full bag of chocolate chips (mini Kisses actually) and a full bag of Peanut Butter Chips... they're chock full of 'YUM!' I threw all the ingredients into my stand mixer, baked and cleaned in about an hour. I can't wait to make this again... perhaps I will tonight!"
"1","5","These were absolutely eximious."
"1","5","Excellent!!! These were just VERY VERY Yummy! I almost forgot the butter (hehe left it in the microwave and was wondering why it looked real dry for a cookie mixture hehe) I ended up adding it in the very end (after folding in the chocolate chips) But they turned out great! It was VERY chocolatey. These are for chocolate lovers out there!"
"1","5","I love this recipe!! I substituted half of the amount of white sugar with Splenda to reduce calories a *little* bit. Also, you can try using Ovaltine instead of standard cocoa -- I used 'Rich Chocolate' flavor and it came out wonderfully. Another favorite recipe in my book ... too bad I'm on a diet! LOL."
"0","1","Even though I didn't chill the dough for one of the batches, it was the same as one of the batches I had chilled. The cookies got slightly burnt at the bottom even though I  had kept it in for exactly 8 mins. Taste was good even though I didn't use shortening and actually, I had used 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 unsalted butter without adding salt separately because I didn't have enough unsalted butter"
"0","4","These are just like another reviewer described, little brownies. The are light and moist. We only used 1/2 cup of sugar because of all the chocolate/ peanut butter chips. In addition to the cocoa we added 2 tablespoons of powdered peanut butter. When using all butter vs the butter/shortening it was necessary to chill the batter between batches to make it easier to spoon on the baking sheet. It only yielded 36 cookies for us. Will bake again."
"0","5","I make substitutions to make these gluten, dairy and egg free. I also leave out the nuts. This recipe lends itself very well to alterations as my family has multiple food allergies. I use Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose baking flour, Earth Balance Soy Free Dairy Free Buttery Spread. To replace the eggs I use 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 mashed ripe banana. I use EnjoyLife Mini Chocolate Chips. Everyone who has had these LOVES them and can't believe they are free of so many things :)"
"0","4","I love this double chocolate chocolate chip recipe! My only complaint is I find it a little rich and would cut back on the chocolate chips."
"0","5","Followed the recipe except I use half brown and half white sugar. Very good!"
"0","3","They are good, and my chocolate loving daughter is a big fan. Although, I agree with some of the other reviews (I made the recipe as is) and they are really, really sweet. After the first batch I was already planning to have the kids share them with our neighbors as 1-2 is about all you can eat before it's a sugar overload."
"0","5","Best chocolate cookies! I made them with white and milk chocolate chips. Turned out amazing and everyone loved them at our neighborhood bbq! thanks!"
"0","5","Delish! Perfect chocolaty cookie. I'm usually terrible at making cookies, but this was soft and raise perfectly. I used someone's suggestion of half margarine and half shortening. I'm so proud! Great recipe!! Thanks."
"0","5","excellent cookie!"
"0","5","This is a great basic recipe to have some fun with! ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A CHOCOLATE JUNKIE! I use two different types of cocoa powder, different type of vanillas, ive put about every type of premium chip in, EXCEPT WHITE! Spices from cinnamon to cayane. ESPRESSO! Have fun!"
"0","5","Yummy! Fudgy and one of my favorite types of cookies. Be careful not to overbake because they still look raw ish when ready."
"0","5","The name is a true match to its chocolate taste!!!! I added a few MnM's which gives it another element of chocolate,,"
"0","5","Made the recipe exactly as written. Cookies turned out great and were a big hit! Everyone wanted the recipe! I made the batter a day ahead and refrigerated overnight. Some reviewers mentioned the cookies being dried out by the next day...I did not find this to be true. The cookies still taste great 2 days after being baked!"
"0","4","Made a half batch and added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips. Loved it"
"0","5","They turned out wonderful! Not only are they delicious, but they look delicious too! I did alter the recipe a bit by cutting down on the butter and sugar. This lack of liquid was covered by a few teaspoons of milk. I displaced the chocolate chips with the walnuts too. Overall, a great recipe that everyone loved!"
"0","5","This cookies were amazing!!"
"0","5","Great cookies. 9 minutes is perfect in my oven."
"0","5","My granddaughter & I made these and we LOVED them! I did as so many others suggested, using half butter & half shortening and (with a halved recipe) used 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 cup regular. Ours required no refrigeration, baked up beautifully in 9 minutes, and had just the right amount of chocolaty flavor. Thanks so much for recipe!"
"0","5","Loved the cookies. I used white chocolate chips because I was out of chocolate chips and I left out the nuts. I was worried they wouldn't be done but they were and they were delicious. I had no problem with the cookies rising or sticking. Great recipe, will make again and again."
"0","5","Sooo good!!! Huge hit at my husbands office :)"
"0","5","I like nice chunky cookies so I used half butter half shortening to minimize spreading. I didn't want those to be too sweet like some reviewers said so I only used 1 cup white sugar and half brown. These are the best."
"0","5","Made the recipe as-is. These cookies are delicious and impressive, making these for the third time right now!"
"0","5","Awesome, easy recipe! Will definitely make again."
"0","5","They came out perfect. Somewhere between a cookie & a brownie with WOWc chocolate taste."
"0","4","these cookies are amazing. so sweet and chocolatey. I baked them a little too long and my cookies turned a bit hard. just remember not to over-bake them. these cookies are a little too sweet for me, I think I'll reduce the amount of sugar I use next time. but still, this is the best chocolate cookie recipe I've ever tried."
"0","5","these are simple to make and delicious. they taste like tiny brownies. I was tempted to make them bigger, because we like big cookies, but they are so rich that the small size is perfect. I was worried because the dough was very thick and dry but they turned out perfectly. they don't spread much so you can put a lot on one pan."
"0","4","I think the people who gave it bad reviews must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. I would make again, maybe with white chocolate chips next time."
"0","3","Needs more butter. After cookies cool there turn a bit dry."
"0","5","I baked this a little longer than the recipe requested because my husband likes a crunchy cookie. However, despite the added baking time, these still came out fudgy. I added a little espresso powder to enhance the chocolate favor and added extra chocolate chips. These were deliciously chocolate and perfect for us chocoholics."
"0","5","oh my...oh wow...so amazing! I got lazy and made mine into one big sheet cookie that I cut into squares with a pizza cutter and it still came out fantastic! Definitely making his one again...and again...and again..."
"0","5","Really chocolate-y!"
"0","5","I just made these cookies tonight and they turned out amazing without any tweeks to the recipe. Thank you for sharing!"
"0","5","Big favorite among my friends. Requested to make it all the time."
"0","5","Its so delicious but for me its too sweet! Its depens on your sweettooth for the sugar measurements. I like this recipe and this id SO easy!"
"0","5","The only adjustment we made to the recipe was using dark chocolate chips instead and that really set them off perfectly in my opinion. I made these for myself and for friends for Yule and they were so well received we're making them again already."
"0","5","These cookies are perfect. Just what I was looking for... a chocolate drop cookie with real chocolate flavor. I couldn't bring myself to add 2 cups of chocolate chips... I used only 1 cup of chips and no one complained. Yummy."
"0","5","By far the most amazing double chocolate chip cookies that I have ever made!"
"0","5","Love this recipe! These cookies are awesome!"
"0","4","Love these cookies! Well, they just came out of the oven, but I am sure I will love them in a day or two as well. (doubt they'll last that long!). They were easy and I had most ingredients on hand, Only had a cup of milk choc chips so I used half a semi sweet bakers bar chopped up. Also a cup butter and a cup shortening. They are so good, flat, gooey and chocolaty! Exactly they way I like them! The old mans gonna be so happy when he gets home! (again, if there are any left!) Thanks for sharing"
"0","5","The perfect recipe for every chocolate addict."
"0","5","Great recipe! Not too sweet and always fluffy."
"0","5","Mega yummy. I chilled the dough for 30-40 minutes as suggested by reviewers. I also did 50/50 brown to white sugar. Really, really good."
"0","5","I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and they were great. Excellent recipe."
"0","5","I have made these for years and every always raves about them! I am about to make them for the Super Bowl right now!"
"0","5","Tried the recipe but I reduce the sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cup. I prefer not too sweet. And I add almond instead of chestnut. Easy to made and it's taste fantastic."
"0","5","Yum! These are my go to bake sale contribution."
"0","4","These cookies really depend on your oven, and they are meant to be big cookies. I tried to make them bite sized, and they didn't spread. You really also want to make them room temp before baking. They were great, and not too much chocolate (which i don't like a lot of chocolate). I do recommend the walnuts, as they add a great texture!!"
"0","5","Great recipe though it was a little too sweet. I've reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup instead and it came out perfect. Great texture, slight crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside. Just the way a soft cookie should be."
"0","5","Awesome fudginess right out of the oven! I did adjust but only out of necessity - I was short on butter by 1/2 cup so I only used 3/4 cup of butter but I figured it wouldn't matter because I always have to reduce butter so my cookies don't come out flat (must be my oven). And I used white chocolate chip because that's what I had - these cookies were soft, chewy, not flat & yummy!"
"0","4","Yummy! I added white chocolate chips, skipped the nuts and used a gluten free flour mix so I could send the cookies to my kids school. They were a huge hit!"
"0","5","I will definitely make these again. I might try them with peanut butter chips next time."
"0","5","taste just like MOMS brownies"
"0","5","I was looking for a plain chocolate drop cookie recipe so I left out the chips and nuts. They were perfect. Beautiful cracked top, tender and chocolaty in the center, not too sweet.I used lard instead of butter and used equal parts almond extract and vanilla. Easy and delicious!"
"0","5","Love these cookies and my family is now officially addicted to them! It seems like a bit of an injustice to simply call them cookies - they're more like brownies in the body of a cookie. Underbake them a bit, for best results....."
"0","4","quite good 4-5"
"0","5","Halved the recipe- and used 2 parts white sugar, one part brown. I also used half mint chips, half regular. In short, awesome, crave-able, not too sweet. Delicious!"
"0","4","Super delicious! Did half white sugar half brown. Had to refrigerate the batter for about a half-hour so I could work with it otherwise it was way too sticky. Came out perfect texture and were not flat."
"0","5","I love these cookies they are just so delicious."
"0","5","Totally amazing! This is the first time I've ever baked cookies. However, things turn great! I'm really astonished to recieve so much compliments from my beloved ones. Wow! Thanks a lot for the really awesome-and-easy-to-bake cookie recipe :D I love it!"
"0","5","Everyone loves them. I used half butter half shortening, and cooked them for 15min."
"0","5","Chocolate deliciousness! I used 1/2 dark chocolate chips & 1/2 semi sweet! No other changes, yum!"
"0","5","Done the recipe as instructed. So yummy. I ate 2 before i could show them to my family"
"0","3","just ok. I like the 'Truffle Cookies' much better."
"0","5","These were out of this world-I used regular chocolate chips and white chocolate chips and they look great!"
"0","5","Just WOW.   I used the following suggestions from other reviewers:  1/2 c of extra flour, instead of all white sugar I put: 3/4 c brown sugar (level, not packed) and a little less than 3/4 cup white sugar, a full tsp baking powder. I added 1 tsp of instant coffee granules (dissolved in a tiny bit of water) with the vanilla. I refrigerated the dough for about an hour.  A little improv of my own: I separated the dough and made 1/2 with mint chocolate chips and 1/2 with semi-sweet chocolate chips so that we had some variety. I did not use a full 2 cups of chocolate chips. I am glad I didn't, because they would have been too sweet for us. Next time I will put more walnuts than the recipe calls for!    They came out perfect: soft, moist, rich, like brownie bites - but not too sweet. This is going in the family recipe book :)"
"0","5","amazing."
"0","5","My entire family loves these cookies!!!!! Easy recipe and uses things I already have .... we make these all year"
"0","5","These delicious cookies were fantastic. . Very soft and chewy. My kids love them and so did I."
"0","5","Super easy and fast recipe! Delicious.,"
"0","4","Great!"
"0","5","I make these often, they are excellent! Sometimes I add pecans instead of walnuts! They're very soft when you take them out, don't overbake them and they'll stay moist. Just let them cool off for a long time and they won't fall apart!"
"0","5","I've used the recipe a few times. This time I used mint chocolate chips instead of the regular chocolate chips & left out the nuts. Boy-o-boy! They taste just like girl scout thin mint cookies. I'm sure I'll be making them again. Soon!"
"0","5","These are really good, I used 1 1/2 cups mint chocolate chips and about 1/2 cup regular and they turned out amazing"
"0","5","Wonderful.....chocolate and addictive....Can't wait for my grandkids to get some.....it will be their fave. I didn't change a thing, except the cooing time.....I cooked them for 13 mins. and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe.....Rowena"
"0","5","I adore this recipe! Really easy to customize to anything you want. I substituted an avocado for a stick of butter and it made it very creamy on the inside while still being crispy on the outside. I also used Andes chocolate mint bits instead of chocolate chips, and it gives this such a nice touch. I highly recommend this!"
"0","5","This recipe lives up to its name! Oh so yummy! I'm at day three and they are still scrumptious... Maybe even better than day 1. The ingredients may be too much for some because they are so rich, but my husband and I loved them! We uses them for a thanksgiving dinner and guests loved them!   I followed the recipe with these exceptions: I used one stick of butter and one stick of margarine ( bc I ran low on butter). I used pecans because that's what I had in the pantry. And I let the dough sit in the fridge for one hour- this allowed the dough to RISE. I was impressed at how this trick works (followed tip from a fellow reviewer).  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will use again and again!!!  :)"
"0","5","Omg these cookies are to die for!!! Love them!!!"
"0","5","I loved these I actually lost my recipe for mine and decided to try this one. It was really good and I didn't have to change it too much, the only thing I did differently is melt the butter alittle so it would be more fudgey like brownies and put a bit more flour in like I do with my old recipe. My only regret is not making a double batch!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe!! They did not last long in my house. The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar. Next time I make it I will use even less. They were very chocolatey and really don't need much added sweetness."
"0","4","I wanted a chewy chocolate cookie base for some mint chocolate chips that I had on hand. These seem good, the results taste a lot like a mint chocolate cookie you might get from Girl Guides/Girl Scouts. I only altered it slightly, as a few comments had suggested. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup loosely packed brown sugar, 1 tsp instant coffee, and 1 tsp baking powder. I also used my electric mixer to beat it at multiple stages, to keep it fluffy, and chilled it a couple hours in the fridge.  These cooked in 9 minutes in my oven. DO NOT be afraid to take them out when they are still soft to the touch. They continue baking for 2-3 minutes on the pan before you remove them to a wire rack. I was worried that mine were still raw, but they firmed up perfectly after cooling.   Overall, they are yummy and seem to be still chewy the next day. I think next time I might up the cocoa powder and reduce the sugar slightly, but that's just personal preference -- I like a rich, dark chocolate flavour, rather than a very sweet cookie."
"0","5","These were great cookies! The only thing I changed was the sugar. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown. I used a small cookie scoop and baked them for 8 minutes. Will definitely make these again!"
"0","5","Awesome !!!!! But even more awesome with chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips"
"0","5","These are my family's and boyfriend's favourite cookies now (and are now nic-named PMS cookies as they are so chocolate-y). I would like to try mixing the chocolate chips with white or peanut butter chips in one of my next recipes. I have also found that I need to keep them in the oven for a few extra minutes, but it may just be the way my oven is."
"0","2","We were not fans of this. The chocolate was overwhelming."
"0","5","I brought this to soccer practice for afterwards! Everyone loved them! One of my teammates to about 10 for lunch and dinner the next day! Must bake!"
"0","4","Yummy."
"0","5","excellent!!!!!!!!!!! will definitely make these again!!!!"
"0","5","My family loved these cookies. I substituted one teaspoon of vanilla extract with one teaspoon of (pepper)mint extract. Delish!!!"
"0","5","Best cookies ever!!!! Absolutely delicious!!  I did tweak it a little the second time I made them! I added a little bit of half and half (it made the dough gooey but not to gooey before baking) and I added 3/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/4 mini reg. chocolate chips! Everyone at work absolutely loved them!  The next time I make them I may try adding a few white chocolate chips!  I am obviously a chocolate lover. ;) However, I am not as big on nuts so I didn't add those either time! I'll try and attach a photo if I think to take one the next time!!"
"0","5","This is my absolute go-to double chocolate chip recipe! I always get tons of compliments on it, and it gets two thumbs up from my brother, who's not a huge dessert person. I always almost completely melt my butter for extra chewiness, and that might be why I find this recipe not quite dry enough. A quick fix for this is to dip your spoon into flour before scooping out cookie dough. :) Go ahead, try to stop at just one!"
"0","5","Made these exactly as directed and they were very good, just like a brownie in cookie form."
"0","5","Love, love, love! Easy to make. I didn't use walnuts, didn't chill the dough, and they turned out amazing. I like that they don't flatten like most my chocolate chip cookie recipes do."
"0","5","Sweet baby Jesus these are amazing. I had the dough in the fridge for an hour and added another teaspoon of vanilla. Never buying store cookies ever again"
"0","5","The best cookie I have made. I used Stevia instead of sugar and organic cacao powder. Amazing chocolate goodness."
"0","5","Fabulous! Exactly what I was looking for! Super soft and gooey. As with any cookie recipe that calls for butter as it's fat, be sure to refrigerate dough for at least an hour before baking and throughout the handling process. Followed recipe exactly...cookies are still soft and scrumptious 3 days later. Baked for 10 min in my oven and came out perfect."
"0","4","I exchanged 1/2 cup of sugar for a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also only had just over a 1/4 tsp of vanilla, and used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of Andes Mint chunks.... Had to bake for 14 minutes but turned out AMAZING!!! Crispy bottoms and chewy inside."
"0","5","I followed the recipe as it's written with the small addition of a tablespoon of Kahlua, and they are delicious--nice and chewy and chocolaty!"
"0","5","Just perfect! Had a small problem at first with 'cup of butter' since i was used to things like '100g butter'.... Thanks for the recipe, we all love these cookies"
"0","5","Hands down THE BEST cookies I've ever made. So simple and so delicious.  Usually I bake for pure enjoyment and to eat some of the dough (which I did, of course) but the cookies themselves were so phenomenal, I had a hard time practicing self-restraint. Side note:I used crushed candy melts instead of the chocolate chips."
"0","5","This was just AWESOME. Since I don't like mixing things around with chocolate, I got rid of the nuts and put more chocolate chips in! I made them first with white sugar, which was kind of too sweet for me, so for the second time, I made them with brown sugar which was better. As if I was making a scone, I didn't fully melt my butter but just chopped it into very small pieces and mixed it with the batter. Also, I added one more egg, which made the cookies so soft... The cookies are super soft and like a cake when you just get them out of the oven (which tastes WONDERFUL), and will become chewy but not hard at all when you cool it down. The best chocolate-chocolate chip cookies I've ever baked in my entire life!"
"0","5","SOO FUDGING AWERSOME!! I BAKED IT AND UNEXPECTEDLY, IT MADE CRACKED DESIGNS:p, THEN I TOOK IT TO SCHOOL AND MY FRIENDS LOVED IT. IM PROBABLY GONNA BAKE IT AGAON TONIGHT SINCE IM ALMOST GRADUATING. THX!"
"0","5","I made this recipe and these cookies were delicious! I took the majority to work (much to the sadness of tmy children) and my co-workers raved about these. I did as I always do use 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. Instead of chocolate chips I used chocolate chunks, i felt this gave the cookie a better texture. The don't flat out a lot so keep that in mid. Overall I will make this again!"
"0","5","Wow, these are fantastic! The only problem is the recipe does not make enough!!! The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup coconut oil for 1/2 cup of butter. They are thick/puffy & when you bite into or break them open, soft & gooey!"
"0","5","These cookies were DELICIOUS! They were soft and super chocolatey. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cups because I didn't want it that sweet. Other than that, they were really good."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful, and a great recipe to do with kids because it's not fussy. We had a bunch of leftover chips from Christmas, so we actually made Chocolate Butterscotch / Peanut Butter / White & Regular Chocolate Chip cookies!"
"0","4","I love chocolate cookies! These are really good, but i changed some things. I reduced the sugar and the chocolate chips and added in more nuts. I use crushed almonds/macadamians. I sold them to my classmates and they love it!"
"0","4","We thought these were great. I made a half batch with the only deviation being chopped bittersweet chocolate instead of chips. I also made slightly larger cookies...yielding 15 instead of 24. Cooked as directed...10 minutes was perfect. Will make again."
"0","5","Very rich & chocolatey!! I subbed about half brown sugar for half of the white & replaced 1c of white wheat flour for 1c of white flour & still turned out wonderfully!! Made per recipe the first time."
"0","5","Delicious. I took them out right at 8 min, and they were perfect. I used mini chocolate chips b/c that's what I had and it worked."
"0","5","I made to specs except I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I chilled the dough in the fridge for about 6 hours and I am baking them now. I might have to tell husband that I 'broke' several of the cookies in the first batch. These are delicious! A great decadent dark chocolate cookie."
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! The only thing is that they are quite sweet and rich."
"0","5","Best cookie ever. I doubled it and it did great! I also used half shorting and half butter. White and dark chips!!!Thank you Kathy!!"
"0","5","SO GOOD!!!"
"0","5","These were amazing!Was craving a chocolate treat and these were the right fix. They're soft in the middle firm on the outside, not overly sweet. Left out the nuts and added white chocolate chips. Took them to work and they were instantly devoured by my co-worker."
"0","2","These were disappointing. More like a brownie than a cookie, way too sweet and I don't think I have ever said that in my life! They didnt melt down like regular drop cookies and I could taste the baking soda! I followed the recipe exactly."
"0","5","Amazing! Try them with mint chocolate chips."
"0","5","It's wonderful respice my family loved so much thank you so much"
"0","5","These cookis are delectably decadently rich, and stayed soft in an airtight container. My alterations: unsalted butter because that is what I had, 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground sea salt because that is what I had (added extra salt to compensate for unsalted butter) and ghirardelli dark chocolate chips, because that was my inspiration for finding a great chocolate chip cookie recipe. They took the full 10 minutes bake time in my oven. Things I will think about for next time: more walnuts, and swap out some of the white sugar for brown, as suggested. Unfortunately I did not read comments prior to baking...but they were perfect just the way I made them! Just a faint hint of sea salt, if you like sea-salted dark chocolate you will love the twist."
"0","5","Excellent, Excellent. Because of what I had on hand I made with 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and almost all brown sugar topped up with white to meet measurement. Perfect cookies."
"0","5","Very chewy and yummy!"
"0","5","A wonderful chocolaty cookie. Be sure to chill dough prior to baking for best results. I replaced 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. Get ready to blast off as these cookies are the best with a nice cold glass of milk. Kids were speechless and just wobbled their heads in pure delight when asked if they liked them. :)"
"0","5","My family fully enjoyed these cookies. I usually just bake a sheet and then freeze the rest and make later. I took a section and put the tiniest bit of peppermint flavoring - mmm. That was good too. I will definitely keep this in my rotation of cookies."
"0","5","Wonderful cookies! I always tweak recipes, so please forgive me - this is whole wheat, coconut oil instead of butter, not quite 1 cup of sugar, fewer chips, and a few hazelnuts. Everything else is the same. Organic."
"0","4","I needed a chocolate fix in a bad way so I decided to try these. They did not disappoint! I used half butter and half coconut oil that I softened. To the flour mixture I added 2 teaspoons of instant espresso powder and that just added a nice depth of flavor. I definitely didn't have the flat cookie problem that others had as mine didn't flatten at all. They stayed in the same shape in which I placed them on the cookie sheet. The next time I make them, I will decrease the sugar and flour a bit as they were a bit too sweet and dry after they cooled."
"0","4","Wow! These cookies are delicious! They so chocolaty, they practically melt in your mouth. I'd suggest baking them for longer than it says on the recipe. I used convection baking, which is supposed to decrease the time, but still had to bake them for longer than 10 minutes. Even then,these cookies come out soft and chewy in the center, which is a actually positive for some people. Still, don't expect a crispy crunchy sort of cookie..."
"0","5","Good God Gertie, are these great! Tried these for hubby for Valentine's Day and holy are they great!!!I put in 1 cup of walnuts and LIGHTLY sprayed sheets with Pam (no parchment paper available here in Mexico, cooked them 9 minutes. I also lightly formed dough into balls to keep theri form after reading other reviews and they held together nicely. Let them cool 5 minutes after taking out of oven. I would give this a 15 star if I could!"
"0","5","I have been making these for years. EXCELLENT! They really need to be slightly under cooked. I also used dark chocolate mint chips (Nestles Christmas Limited edition) and received even higher reviews. Bites of heaven!"
"0","5","These cookies turned out great! Very soft, even after a couple of days. My family loved them. I'll be making these again!"
"0","5","Everyone loved them, like other reviewers, the first time I made them they turned out pretty flat. So cutting down on the margarine helps. I also added almond extract instead of vanilla. It made them pretty delicious!"
"0","5","Great!"
"0","5","Super yummy! I made this recipe with 1.5 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of mint extract. SO yummy. It was a nice complement to the chocolaty goodness of this recipe."
"0","5","These cookies were easy to make, soft and extra chocolately. They were an instant hit with the kids and even the husband who is highly critical of everything I cook."
"0","4","I tried this and LOVED it, the whole family did. Upon reading the reviews beforehand, I decided to edit the recipe slightly. I halved the recipe, so I put 1/2 a cup of sugar and another 1/4 cup of brown sugar. That made the cookies nice and soft! I also chilled the dough beforehand. Overall this was an amazing cookie recipe!"
"0","5","I made mine with rye & buckwheat flour instead and added 2 tbl spoons of flax meal. Trying to add more fiber. It came out delicious!! Great recipe."
"0","2","I didn't think they were very good at all. The cookies tasted 'floury' and dry. I think they could use a tad more sugar."
"0","4","Very yummy. I exchanged 1 cup of crisco in place of the butter so that the cookies would not flatten out. I also used 3/4 Cup of sugar and 3/4 Cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 Cup of white sugar."
"0","5","I served this at work and everyone loved them"
"0","5","Awesome cookie! I followed the recipe exactly & got great results! I did mix up the chocolate chips because I had stray bags open of white chocolate, semi-sweet & milk chocolate(still equalling 2C.) Everyone loved these!"
"0","5","WoW! These are so good! Everyone loved them. I actually made half the amount and they were still so good! Half the amount made almost 3 dozen too!I made a couple changes though, I added 1teaspoon of baking powder and a tablespoon of vanilla. I baked them at 325 for 13minutes. I did, however, have to use my hands to roll them into a bit of a ball before putting them on the baking sheets. Such a great recipe! Can't wait to try them again :)"
"0","5","Sooo good!"
"0","4","Flavor was ok, but more cake like than I would like. I did not change a thing except I did not add the nuts. I upgraded this to a 4 (my original was 3) because my husband loved these."
"0","5","Just made these cookies, the family and I fell in love with them!~!! Very easy to make."
"0","5","Most excellent cookie. Righteous!"
"0","5","I love this cookie recipe!! I do white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chips and macadamia nuts instead of The walnuts!! My family loves them!! My family and neighbors always insist on these cookies!!"
"0","5","I was thrilled with these! I am an uber chocolate snob and they satisfied even me! I loved the idea of using half shortening/ half butter and the brown sugar/ white sugar combo was excellent. The brown sugar added a new dimension.Not for the faint of heart that doesn't love sweets!"
"0","5","We're calling these 'My New Year Resolution lasted 5 Days Cookies'! Wonderful! Per other reviewers, I used half white sugar and half brown. I used 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips, and 3/4 cup peanut butter chips. Increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon, and added some cinnamon. Used a 2oz cookie scoop, parchment paper, and 8 minutes in the oven later: cookie heaven!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I've made it twice-No major changes except for adding white chocolate chips instead of the nuts. Oh, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar after reading the other reviews.The cookie was chocolatey and delicious both times. It's my little boy's new favorite cookie."
"0","5","Truly scrumptious and chocolatey.Made these cookies for my co workers this Christmas and they loved them!"
"0","5","I made these cookies exactly to the recipe and they were easily the best cookies ever. I am now on to my second batch since the first one was gone before I could even package them up for Christmas. YUM!"
"0","5","I replaced the walnuts with English Toffee Bits, very good!"
"0","4","Not bad at all. We used peanut butter chips and reeses pieces instead of chocolate chips and nuts, but didn't change the batter. Kids really like them."
"0","5","Soo good!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Really good my family loved them"
"0","5","This is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!! I did 1 c. White sugar and 1/2 c. Light brown sugar.I also cooked them for 13 minutes but I did big scoops. I made a huge mess and had fun in the process. The only bad thing is cleaning up :)"
"0","5","These satisfied our chocolate craving! They are delicious and chewy cookies. I used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups and I thought it was a nice amount. The batter made exactly 3 dozen medium-sized cookies. I think these would be great with or without the walnuts."
"0","5","I tried this recipe exactly as written and live at 5,000 feet elevation band am always nervous baking at altitude, since most recipes are written for closer to sea-level. These cookies came out perfect!! They are absolutely the perfect little chocolate cookie beautifully balanced with an almost imperceivsble touch of salt. DELICIOUS!!!"
"0","5","A little dry, but overall, great."
"0","5","I used half butter and have shortening. Instead of 2 c choc chips I used 1 c of mini choc chi[s and 1 cup mini baking m&ms. They were great! They were gone pretty darn quick!"
"0","5","With this I made 11 dozen cookies and all of them turned out fantastic. The only difference is that I used less chocolate chips (and used white chocolate), rolled them in coconut before cooking and only cooked them for 5 minutes."
"0","5","I did this cookies for my daughter school bake sale and it came out very good. I chilled the dough for one hour and baked it. Thank you for posting this wounderfull recipe."
"0","5","Went exactly by the recipe minus the nuts and but used the whole 11oz bag of nestle toll house chips and it worked great. Baked for about 10-12 min Perfection!!!! Very quick and easy cookie. I got 2 dozen nice sized cookies."
"0","5","I love these cookies! I needed a recipe for chocolate cookies because all I had on hand was white chips. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderful. If you over cook them they will get hard. I baked mine for 8 minutes and let them cool on the pan about 3-4 minutes and they were perfect. I just went to the kitchen to put them away and they are almost gone."
"0","5","I was looking for a chocolate peanut butter chip recipe, but couldn't find one I liked. So I adapted this for my cookies. I read the reviews and took the advice and halved the white sugar and add equal amount of brown sugar, to keep them soft. I added Reese's Peanut Butter chips. OMG, these turned out so good. Everyone loved them. Friends want the recipe. These are one of our new favorite. -Wendy"
"0","5","These cookies are DELICIOUS! I took them to my office where everyone always tries to be super healthy and they were gone within a couple of hours. I followed other reviews and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I also underbaked them a tad and cooked them on parchment paper so I could slide the paper directly onto the counter as soon as I took the pan out of the oven. I will make these many more times!"
"0","3","I'm not sure I'd try this recipe again without a few modifications. The batter is very sticky and difficult to work with. Expect dirty, chocolatey fingers if you use a teaspoon to drop your batter on to the cookie sheet, or the need to rinse your cookie scoop between batches. I had no trouble with the cookies sticking to my cookie sheet (I used heavy, non-stick jelly roll pans by Chicago Metallic), but the cookies did stick to the cooling rack.   They were tasty (reminiscent of a brownie), but the butter flavor is overwhelming. I'd follow other reviewers' suggestions to use 1/2c of shortening in place of 1/2c butter. Unless you chill your batter before baking, your cookies will come out large and thin. I highly recommend not only chilling, but using a cookie scoop and maybe even a touch more flour.  My husband left a dish of cookies sitting out for 24 hours, and they remained crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, but the butter flavor comes through as stale. Bleh. They're also not the prettiest things to look at, as you can see from the user submitted photos, but using 1 cup of white chips and decorating the tops with 3 white chips before baking improved the appearance.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)"
"0","5","WOW! These cookies are addictive! I followed the recipe with the exception of the sugar, I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar. I used Starbucks Hot Cocoa. I divided the dough into half with Dark Chocolate Chip the other half I used Costco Semisweet Chocolate Chips. I made half of each type without nuts, and half with chopped English Walnuts, essentially ending with 4 types of cookies. This will be a great variety for the cookie tray. Hubby said they are the BEST I've EVER made. I will definitely be making them again for Christmas. High quality ingredients do make a difference! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! (Made 5 dozen 2' cookies)"
"0","5","I have made many different cookie recipes but this is by far one of the best! The only change I made was to substitute half of the semi-sweet chips with white chocolate chips and they turned out great! If you are looking for a thick, slightly gooey and chewy cookie then this is it! This will be one of my 'go to' favs for sure."
"0","5","Yum super easy :-) I put mint chips in them made a special treat"
"0","5","All loved this recipe. Followed exactly except used Hershey 's special dark cocoa powder and Hershey 's special dark chips. Accidentally baked first batch at 370 (didn't have glasses on). Still turned out. Refrigerated all but first batch and only for length of time prior batch was in oven. Will definitely do again. Would love to try with little instant coffee."
"0","5","Made the recipe exactly as posted using all butter, but I did half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half white chocolate chunks. These are soft, chewy and deliciously rich. They were a big hit at my work and I've been told it's a keeper."
"0","4","A good recipe, these biscuits are a cross between a biscuit and a brownie, perfect for adding things like choc chips, peanut buttern, cream cheese. I like the recipe, versatile, not quite five stars but a recipe that is good and worth cooking a few times. I think it would work well iced with frosting."
"0","5","I have attempted to make all sorts of cookies for years and regardless of my effort they taste terrible. This was the first time I was able to make delicious cookies! Thank you for sharing this recipe and for the great tips. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and refrigerated dough for one hour prior to baking. The cookies did not flatten and they were moist and delicious."
"0","5","best cookies i have ever made they were so good that as soon as they came out of the oven they were all gone people didnt even give them time to cool!"
"0","5","These are seriously yummy cookies. I used Kamut flour (it's a little easier on the tummy if you're sensitive to wheat) and anticipating that they'd be sweeter than they needed to be, I reduced the sugar to 1 C. They turned out SO well. The way I made the dough, it was easiest to form a loose ball and put it onto the cookie sheet that way. They only spread out a little, so it was easy to fit quite a few on my cookie sheet. I'm not sure if this would be the case if you regular wheat flour. The chocolate flavor was full and the cookie was sweet. Not TOO sweet, thank goodness! They stayed soft and almost brownie-like, when stored on a plate with some press and seal wrap over the top.  I will DEFINITELY make these again!"
"0","5","Hubby and kids loved them! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","These are awesome! Made the recipe exactly as written. I made up a batch for a fundraiser at work....and ended up eating a dozen before they left the house. Excellent, rich chocolaty chewy cookies"
"0","5","awesome!! Best cookies ever!!"
"0","5","Really liked these cookies! Hubby and I are trying to watch our waistlines (a losing battle), so I substituted with 3/4 cup splenda sugar blend and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend, 1 cup sugar free chocolate chips, half whole wheat flour, light butter and DARK cocoa powder for a bit more intensity. Even with all of these changes, cookies turned out great!!"
"0","5","Delish. They turned out great, sweet, but great."
"0","3","Mine turned out cakey and quite soft.is it supposed to be like that.what could have gone wrong"
"0","4","Made this for my wife and girls and they loved it.  The only thing that I changed with the recipe was the chopped walnuts. We did not have any when I made them so we used what we did have which was coconut. They came out beautifully. Chewing and delicious."
"0","4","One of those cookies you can't stop eating. Taste and texture of a good brownie. Didn't add nuts due to allergies."
"0","5","Love these! Super easy to make using a stand mixer. Based on other reviews, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, next time I'd try 1/2 cup of each as they are sweet with the 3/4 of each. I used 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped dried cherries. Absolutely divine!!!"
"0","4","These are delicious! Very chocolatey and soft. Very rich though, I could only eat about 2 of them. I added some marshmallows just to have something in there other than chocolate."
"0","5","I love these cookies! I only used one cup of chocolate chips and found that this was plenty!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I used M&Ms instead of chocolate chips- they turned out great!"
"0","4","I used 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar to help cookies stay soft."
"0","5","These were very easy to make and came out perfectly. They instruction about cooking them until they just set was right on the money. Also, I substituted almond extract for the vanilla. Delicious!"
"0","5","Excellent chocolate cookie! No problem with dryness, they were still very moist even after five days. I baked recipe as written except for the nuts, my grandson is allergic. They are like little brownie bites. I think I will try them with peanut butter chips."
"0","5","These were pretty awesome. They were very brownie-like, fudgy and soft. I would probably add another 1/4-1/2 tsp baking soda next time because these hardly spread out at all so they were tall and a little cakey. The upside of that is I fit more on the baking sheet at a time. I wanted a dark chocolate taste so I added 1/4 less sugar and used half brown and half white. I also added a pkg of sugar free instant chocolate pudding as I do to all my cookies to keep them soft. I burned my tongue eating these because I couldn't wait until they cooled because they are so good!"
"0","5","I couldn't decide whether to make cookies or brownies, so I compromised with these cookies. I'm glad I did. I used half brown sugar, half granulated white, and used cornstarch in place of baking soda. Turned out soft, moist and delicious!"
"0","5","YUMMY!! these cookies turned out soft and chewy. After mixing the dough I put it in the frig. for about 30 mins. and I used a tablespoon scooper so that the cookies were all the same size. I had to add five minutes to the baking time b/c I put the dough in the frig. But let me tell you- These cookies are SHOW STOPPERS!"
"0","5","Really great! Followed all of the ingredients perfectly, added a little bit less cocoa powder because that seemed like quite a bit and their soft, chewy, and double the chocolate. Who WOULDN'T love those?"
"0","5","I love them though I find them a bit too sweet (all US cake/cookies to be frank). I'll cut the sugar so the chocolate will stand out more."
"0","5","My sister wanted me to make chocolate cookies, and this recipe seemed promising. The only change I made was half white sugar and half brown sugar. The cookies were just so good, and I'm not one for chocolate cookies. It was like a cross between a brownie and chocolate cake! Yummy!"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous! I didn't change a thing and they were awesome! I decided to let my 11 year old try the recipe while I 'coached' her through it and did the actual baking. The recipe was easy enough for her to follow and all 6 of us were in choco-heaven! We ate a lot, but froze the rest for that moment when we just need a little chocolate! These will be a staple cookie in our home!"
"0","5","These are so good! I did change it to 1 cup white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Then refrigerated the dough for an hour. I am so glad I had to take them on my camping trip or my husband and I would have ate them all."
"0","5","best chocolate cookies ever."
"0","5","Excellent and easy. Used half shortening and only white chips."
"0","5","This was really great! Cookies stay soft and moist even after couple days! I cut back on the amount of chocolate chips by half when I made this recipe-that's just cause I'm not a fan of getting a large mouthful of choco chips when I bite into a cookie. I also used white chocolate chips instead to lessen the richness, and with these changes they turned out fantastic!!"
"0","5","If you are looking for a super sweet and yummy cookie this is a good one. It is not for those who like a light cookie by any means. I made it to the recipe with no alterations...well other than I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I used a chopped milk chocolate bar for the rest and didn't quite do the full two cups as the chocolate bar mad it quite rich. I also opted out of the optional nuts.   Pretty yummy :)"
"0","5","Wow--this is a definite new favorite! I can never make my mom's chocolate cookie recipe turn out, but these were perfect and I didn't change a thing! Thanks for a wonderful (and addictive!) after-school-snack!"
"0","5","Sometimes I change out the chocolate chips for mint chocolate chips - delicious either way!!!"
"0","4","I have made this recipe many times since first discovering it. Yesterday did a variation replacing choc chips with smarties."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! I used half shortening and half butter and made them with 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. I chilled the dough before shaping, and they stayed nice and puffy. Baking just until the tops begin to crack, as another user suggested, is perfect - these are soft and delicious."
"0","4","I tried this but made the following changes: only use 1/2 cup of cocoa, and change the sugar to half white & half brown. If you are using some shortening with the butter you need to add 1 tbsp. of water per 1/2 cup of shortening to equal 1/2 cup butter. This will help with the dryness factor that is a problem for some. Also, increase the salt to 1/2 tsp (you always want to use salt when you are using cocoa to make the chocolate flavour come alive). I also increased the baking soda to 1 tsp to help with the rise. The batter should be fairly moist when putting onto the cookie sheet (almost hard to shape) and they come out high and nice. Good luck!"
"0","5","Truly one of the best cookie recipes I have EVER tried!! For the next time, I'm going to try white chocolate chips. Thank you!!"
"0","5","Delicious and so chocolatey! The recipe is easy and also makes a good number of cookies. They are soft on the inside, but have a nice crunch when you bite into them. I HIGHLY recommend making these if you're a chocolate lover. But, have milk on hand!"
"0","5","These are the best cookies. We tried several recipes and this is our favorite. My 10 year old son asks for them at least 2-3 times a week. He would be on a constant sugar high if I would make them that often!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe for chewy cookies, especially if you and the peeps love chocolate. I followed the recipe to the T, only I used white chocolate chips instead, to give a nice color contrast. As a side note, would you believe my husband said they weren't very chocolatey? HA! Not only are his eyes and ears going, but his taste buds must be failing too;)"
"0","5","These cookies are really great! Made them exactly to the recipe (No ingredient changes) - just adjusted servings down to 2 dozen because it's only 2 of us. Dropped teaspoon size and baked exactly 8 min - Perfect! Such a good chocolate flavor and very moist/chewy. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Mmmm just made these and they turned out very well, even after I healthified them. I substituted the sugar with a mashed brown banana, a few tablespoons of honey, and approximately a quarter cup of brown sugar. I also used whole wheat flour. Very impressive, I'm sure I will make them again when I need another chocolate fix!"
"0","5","These are fantastic! Followed the recipe to the letter-without the walnuts. **note-do not overbake these!! I experimented with different times, and these were perfect at 8-8.5 minutes. 9 minutes were overdone, 8 minutes are just a tad too gooey. Used a Tablespoon measuring spoon-level. I'm a baker-but cookies have always been my Achilles heel....not these! Perfect!!"
"0","5","This was SOOOO GOOD!! I absolutely LOVED IT! ^w^"
"0","5","Used 2/3 cup white & brown sugars each, making it a 1&1/3 cups sugar. Delicious recipe!"
"0","5","The best chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe hands down. Be careful not to over bake. I used 1/2 cup of salted butter and 1/2 cup of butter shortening. Plump delicious cookies!!!"
"0","5","Yummy! I used mint m-n-m's and they were tasty! I baked mine for 10 minutes. These would even be good with no chocolate chips and a dusting of powdered sugar."
"0","4","Very good cookies, but I think they could be a little sweeter. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening, and they are soft and moist."
"0","5","I'm eating them while still warm. Flavor is amazing-I did leave out the nuts as no one will eat them here but me. The cookies do fall apart while still warm (small price to pay) but I'm sure will be solid once they cool more. I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as recommended and they didn't spread out as much which I think is a good idea."
"0","5","One word: Yummy!"
"0","5","Followed Diane M.'s changes of 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and subbed out half the butter with shortening. Also used milk Choc. Chips instead of semi sweet. Came out FABULOUS!!!!!!"
"0","5","Amazing cookies. Substituted peanut butter M&Ms for the chips and they were fantastic. Going to try adding hazelnut extract next time..."
"0","5","Great cookie recipe. Easy to follow. Very chocolatey and moist. Enjoying them a lot."
"0","5","Wow!!! My son made these for his friends for Valentine's Day. Lucky for us there were some left over. They are amazing!"
"0","4","Wish is was a little more crunchy - but I eventually left it in the oven longer - otherwise... hubby said it was delicious and refused to share!"
"0","5","MAKE THE ALL THE TIME, EVERYONE LOOOOOVES THEM! Trick to make them soft is cook them for 7 minutes at 320, then let them sit for an hour then pack them up and they will be soft for days!  MAKE SURE YOU MIX all the ingredients well or they won't turn out well, I mix for at least 10 minutes before I put the chocolate chips in."
"0","5","Some of the best cookies ever!"
"0","5","Yes,I've tried this recipe. My mom made these for us tonight. I loved them. They are amazing! We neede more cookie recipies like this! She is also a really good cooker so that might have made them all the more better! Love you, mom! (just like thses cookies haha, but more!)"
"0","5","I loved this recipe just as it is! The cookies were very chocolatey, but not too sweet. They tasted like brownies!!! I shared them with my family and they agreed that these were some really good cookies!"
"0","2","These were really disapointing. They turned out flat and rather dry. The egdes were burnt while the middel was still wet and runny. I gave them to my brother, who eats everything and he said they were okay. Also, they were really hard to get off the pan due to the flat-ness and ended up in pieces. They were aldo waaay to sweet.   On another note, they were easy to repair and edible :3"
"0","5","I split the dough and added white chocolate chips to half and mini chocolate chips to the other they turned out great!"
"0","5","Absolutely wondderful!!! I used unsweetened cocoa and only baked at 350 for 7 minutes! I will make these time and time again!!! Thank you the absolute DELISH recipe!"
"0","5","I came across this recipe. Tryed it and absolutely love them. This one is a keeper and will definately make these again. I replaced the butter/margerine with plain greek yogurt which cut half the fat out of the recipe and kept them soft and moist. Very yummy."
"0","5","Got great compliments at my book club meeting! As recommended by a reviewer I chilled the dough for an hour before baking and the cookies did not flatten too much. I rolled the dough in the shape of a 1.5 inch log wrapped in a piece of parchment paper prior to chilling, then I sliced into 24 cookies (I cut the recipe amount in half as 4 doz was too much for me) and baked for about 11 mins."
"0","5","Love the recipe as it produces wonderful and tasty cookies!"
"0","5","This is the most request cookie I have ever made. I follow the recipe ingredients exactly, but I have some suggestions to the prep to make this even better. First, do not use a mixer. Mixing by hand and not over mixing will create a tender moist cookie. Toats the nut first in a small pan with a dusting of salt. The flavors will be amazing. I bake by the teaspoonful at 350 for exactly 8 minutes the cookies will keep their shape so don't wait for them to flatten. Enjoy."
"0","4","I did use half semi-sweet, half dark chocolate chips, and pecans. I also used 1 cup sugar and half cup brown. I felt the batter was real sugary tasting so I added in another 1/4 cup flour. Cookies nice and soft but did get hard after a couple days and we had to microwave them for that softness again."
"0","5","Delicious!!!Made them exactly how it stated. Will make again!!!"
"0","5","Made these exactly as is, LOVED them. Simple enough for my kids to make! They are pretty sweet, so we kept them rounded teaspoon sized."
"0","5","I've made this several times and they are always a hit. I often use white chocolate chips instead of chocolate chocolate just for variety."
"0","5","I make these for Christmas every year and every year I get tons of requests for the recipe! I just direct them here! Tons of chocolate flavor and so perfect for Christmas!"
"0","5","Excellent!! Very addicting! I actually made these with a mix of peanut butter and chocolate chips. I will def. make again, as a matter of a fact, they have been added to my favorites:)"
"0","3","it's a good recipe i love chocolate,i doubled the recipe and let the dough set for 2hrs, i 1cup less chocolate chips and i added 2/3 cup of dried blueberries :) totally gave it a nice balance of all that chocolate :)"
"0","5","I can only assume this is what cocaine is like. Holy cow. Best cookie I've ever had, hands down."
"0","4","They were delicious, I used mint chocolate chips instead of regular."
"0","4","This is a super sweet explosion of chocolately goodness in your mouth. In fact, a little sweet for my taste, even though I liked it. My kids thought they were amazing. Followed other reviewers advice with half buttery shortening and half butter, also half dark brown sugar and half white sugar. Did a little bit of a twist with dark chocolate chips and white chocolate chips. This made it really good, next time to make it a little less sweet will just use dark chocolate chips. For big teasponfuls on the baking sheet, I baked them for 10 minutes. In my oven can only fit one sheet on a rack, so bake for five minutes and then switch racks and bake for five more, this helps bake two batches more evenly. Oh, and the nonstick aluminum foil is amazing. Cookies didn't stick and is reusable for multiple batches."
"0","5","Fantastic cookies. I have made them as they are here and with several modifications too. My favorite is as described in the recipe with the following changes: no nuts, no vanilla and 1 tablespoon of orange extract."
"0","5","I made these cookies just as the recipe reads (opting not to add walnuts) but I baked them as a bar (I hate babysitting the oven with cookies) and my family LOVES them. They were fluffy, moist, chocolatey and delicious. The whole pan only lasted 2 days in our house! Great recipe!"
"0","5","just made these with guittard mint chips and they are amazing. subbed brown sugar for 1/2 of the white sugar. crazy delicious!"
"0","4","I made these in the kitchen at school last week, and everyone loved them! I added extra chocolate chunks to make them more chocolaty, and they came out nice and gooey! The only drawback was that they did tend to fall apart a lot, but you're eating it with your fingers anyway, so who cares?"
"0","5","With the exception of using peppermint M&Ms instead of chocolate chips/nuts, I followed this recipe to a T. Cookies were delicious and perfect for the holiday!"
"0","4","Love these cookies! First time i made then i didn't have cocoa powder  so i used 1/3 a cup instead. Then i added peanut butter and havent tried the original way since!"
"0","5","These are the best cookies I've made in a long time! Definitely for the chocolate lover! I'll be making these regularly. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","They taste so great with white chocolate ;D yummy"
"0","5","Added Andes Peppermint Chips instead of chocolate chips for some holiday cheer. SOO GOOD, making them again this year!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing. Mine turned out crispy in outside and soft and very moist inside. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, and the flavor was very rich but not overpowering. My dought was very sticky so I added 2 tbs of milk. That did the trick. Perfect consistency. I will be making these again. Thank you for sharing the recipe."
"0","5","the boys loved them, not my thing."
"0","3","I used 'hershey's special dark reserve' for the cocoa powder and the batter turned black so i used white chocolate chips. i also rolled the dough out and used cookie cutters to cut them, they kept their shape very well. also, baked at 350 for 15 minutes and they were perfectly done inside. i'm not a huge fan of chocolate so i probably won't make these for myself again, but i would bet that my mom and other chocoholics will love them. 3 stars in my book. In the photo the left cookies are without nuts and the right are with. I would definitely recommend adding the nuts, the cookies were kind of blah without them."
"0","5","Fabulous! I added 1 handful of sweetened coconut. Delish! Also, I dropped by rounded TABLEspoon fulls, which got me cookies about the size of my palm (about a dozen) using half this recipe. Cook for 12-13 minutes for this larger size cookie. Definitely going in my recipe box..."
"0","5","The cookies turned out great! Instead of using 2 cups of chocolate chips I used 1 1/2 cups. Used this recipe a few times and my guests loved them!"
"0","4","Wanting to do a different cookie and this was it! Really good cookie. Even better right out of the oven. We will be making these again."
"0","5","These were moist, cake-like, and delicious! Not to sweet at all, although i added 1 1/4 instead or 1 1/2. I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN!!"
"0","5","I did some modification. 1) I use 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cup white sugar. 2)I use chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips. It turned out to be soooooooooo good! It's melting in my mouth. Every body love it!!! Will keep this recipe!"
"0","5","Baking is always tricky for me because I live in Colorado. But, the cookies came out perfect with no high altitude adjustements. These are yummy and soft and this is now one of my favorite cookie recipes!"
"0","5","I threw in some white chocolate chips for about half the chocolate. These were great."
"0","4","Yum! I did make some changes. 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup lightly packed best brown sugar. 2 1/4 cup flour. 1/2 cup cocoa. I also used Reese's Peanut butter chips. Yum. Its still a very soft dough. Chilling it first could help. I also incresed oven temp to 375"
"0","5","These cookies are great! I used 1 cup semi sweet chips and 1 cup white chips, plus 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup dried cranberries. I also mixed in about a 1/2 cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter. Delicious!"
"0","5","delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love it"
"0","5","Wonderful! I split the butter and instead of one cup of butter, I did one half cup of butter and one cup of virgin coconut oil. Also broke the cookie down into four batches: - cherries added - macadamia nuts added - orange zest added - little crystalized ginger chunks added They were delicious!"
"0","5","These are awesome! Instead of butter and eggs I did coconut oil and flax (1 T. flax to 3 T. water for each egg) to make it vegan, and then I used whole wheat flour and evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar. I also threw in some flaked coconut with my chocolate chunks to draw out the coconut flavor. Definitely a repeat recipe."
"0","4","Delicious. I used mint chocolate chips at my husbands request and he can't get enough. Thanks for sharing"
"0","4","Great cookies but not as moist as we might have liked."
"0","5","Yum! I didn't change a thing! ....except double the batch! ;)"
"0","5","Delicious!! I did the recipe exactly as written. It came out great! The dough was a little sticky, but the cookies came out beautiful! They have a wonderful flavor. Awesome!"
"0","4","Delicious Cookies. Everyone will love them."
"0","5","YUM! Need I say more? Great cookies I wouldn't change thing in this recipe."
"0","5","delicious!"
"0","4","Definitely delicious! They were at their best the very first day--especially warm out of the oven--but we're still yummy on day 2 and 3. I just recommend a tall glass of milk to dunk away!"
"0","5","Delicious!! I think these are the best cookies I've ever had."
"0","5","Delicious. Easy. Made as directed, only replacing 1/2 c white sugar with 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and adding some minced dried cherries. The colder the batter, the less flat these turned out. No matter, though: they are delicious regardless. Added a few grains Hawaiian red salt to a few and it truly elevated them - they rival the most expensive goodies out there. Will be making these again."
"0","5","Best cookies I have ever made, and I have made a LOT of cookies. The only think I changed was splitting the flour half whole wheat and half all purpose. Still tasted AMAZING. I will be making these again."
"0","5","one of the best cookies Ive ever made or eaten Followed recipe exactly and 8mins in gas oven. I will def make again soon- make them you wont be dissapointed, theyre simple and chewy and make the house smell amazing- Love!"
"0","5","OMG! These are fantastic. I did the sugar/brown sugar thing. Next time I'm going to add some peanut butter! And there will be a next time. I'm hooked."
"0","5","Followed advice of others and replaced half of the white sugar with brown sugar. Used semisweet chocolate chunks and no nuts. Stayed wonderfully soft when stored with half piece of bread."
"0","5","Yummy! My little boy and I made these with dark chocolate chips and mini marshmallows - the marshmallows were a little messy during cooking, but once cooled, the crispy bits on the outside tasted like toffee. I'll make these again for sure!"
"0","5","Mmmmm, chocolatey goodness!! I would recommend just one cup of semisweet chocolate (to cut up the calories and all)."
"0","5","theses are the first cookies i didn't burn,so good."
"0","5","Excellent! Very delicious... I've cut the sugar to 1 cup and chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cup, just to be a bit healthier...and they tasted very good......"
"0","3","I thought these were a bit too dry. They did taste great, but still too dry. They are something between a cake and a cookie."
"0","4","These are straight up tummy soothers....a glass of milk with these moist yummy tongue massaging, taste bud bullies put me right to sleep. I added chunks of semi sweet bakers chocolate and macadamia nuts. My children have been denied until the next batch, it's only fair."
"0","4","These were good. We used dark chocolate chips and added dried cherries."
"0","5","I took the suggestion of using 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I wanted to do something different so instead of using 2 cups chocolate chips and 1/2 cup walnuts, I used 2 cups of Reeses peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. They were very chocolatey and peanutbuttery! I made my cookies really big so it yielded 2 dozen, not 4 dozen. Also because they were bigger, they obviously took a bit longer to cook. They were AMAZING. I would make them again!"
"0","4","Delicious. Don't overbake. Tastes and smell great. We snuck them in the movie theater and I could hear growling stomachs in the row behind us. Chocolatey Deliciousness."
"0","5","The BEST chocolate cookies, period. I can't say enough good things about this recipe- the texture is perfect, not too sweet, just chocolatey enough.  I use Hershey's dark cocoa and milk chocolate chips- yum!"
"0","5","I made these cookies today (no changes whatsoever to the original recipe) and they are AMAZING! They certainly provide a satisfying fix for a gooey chocolate craving.   It was very humid where I was baking, and I think my butter may have been a bit too soft; the cookies were incredibly soft and delicate--no crispy edges--, even after baking for 12 minutes and cooling on the baking sheet. No complaints here, the cookies are still wonderfully delicious; however, next time I will try refrigerating the dough for a little while and not softening the butter as much in hopes of yielding more stable cookie.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
"0","4","I made a version of these cookies and I loved them! I didn't have exactly the right ingredients, so I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, and some whole wheat flour."
"0","4","these were very good. Everyone loved them, although i prefer a regular chocolate chip cookie myself. More walnuts would make it better. They kept well for me in an airtight container for up to a week."
"0","5","I also followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and used half white sugar and half brown sugar, as well as half butter and half shortening. These cookies are absolutely DELICIOUS! I brought them in to work, and everybody has said that they are amazing. Great recipe!"
"0","4","I used milk chocolate chips which made them too rich for my taste so definitely go with the semisweet."
"0","4","The cookies tasted incredible (how can they not when they're chocolate) BUT my brother and I felt it was tooo chocolatey, which made them dry (ur gna need a cup of water right after!). I didnt think much about the amount of cocoa in the recipe until i added the cocoa and got a very dark batter. Next time i will reduce the cocoa to a 1/2 cup."
"0","5","My family loved these. Just the right amount of chocolate for us. They also stay fresh a long time."
"0","5","How could anyone give this recipe 1 star?! haha, this turned out perfect! They are soooo chocolatey and the perfect texture, love them! I will definitely be making these again sometime!"
"0","2","These are very dry, and def have a cocoa taste. More cake like, I'd try a different cocoa reciepe"
"0","5","My kids and husband loved them thank you"
"0","5","Yum!!! Followed the recipe as written!  WARNING!!! Make sure you have a glass of milk! You'll need it for sure :)"
"0","4","Great recipe, with a couple of tweaks. I had to add about an extra half cup of flour to make these more like cookie dough and not cake batter. They were quite thin, even for drop cookies. I noted that some had 'rolled into balls' and I wondered how...lol. In any event, they are yummy and I added some peppermint extract along with a little vanilla for 'Mint Choc Choc Chip'. Mmmmmmm!!!!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe except I put 1 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips! Love this recipe! My daughter loved loved them!"
"0","5","I would put 1/4 cup more of the optional walnuts in the recipe. We finished them all within 4 hours of making them. Of course, that's between 6 kids and 2 adults. The recipe was easy and they baked up nice. The texture was soft and the cookies stayed together. They went fabulous with a cold glass of milk."
"0","5","I've had and made so many mediocre chocolate cookies. These are fabulous! I don't know why nobody can make a decent chocolate cookie when they are this easy. Rich and delicious!"
"0","5","Wow! Who ever gave these a bad rating either can't bake or hates chocolate. These are now my favorite cookie."
"0","5","THESE ARE MY FAVORITE COOKIES! i made these with a friend and they were amazing as written. while one batch was baking we were eating the dough, which is so delicious. the cookies were even better, thanks for such a wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","Just Awesome!"
"0","5","they were still excellent after days"
"0","5","These were great, I also used half brown sugar half white sugar, and half butter and half shortening. Makes for gooier flufflier cookies, perfect. I went one step further and coated them in chocolate! EXCELLENT for the chocolate lover in your house!! I know the one in mine is happy!"
"0","4","I thought these turned out really good however, the dough is very dense and became really hard to stir when i was trying to add the chocolate chips. I had followed the recipe exactly so i'm not sure what was with the consistency.   you HAVE to take these out of the oven while they are still not fully cooked (8 min) or they will be over cooked. I baked on waxed paper and just removed whole sheet to drying rack (had to leave on wax paper or would have melted through the rack, as the first batch did). After a few mins on the paper i removed it and finished cooling on the racks."
"0","5","Theses are really yummy! I did use 1 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar, only because I prefer the taste and texture the brown sugar gives a cookie. I was also out of vanilla extract, so I added a couple teaspoons of French vanilla instant pudding and that seemed to work out pretty well! Definitely fixed my chocolate craving!"
"0","5","i used half shortening and half butter as someone suggested,and they turned out as 'fat' as they look in the picture! i also substituted half a cup of brown sugar. I have to say these are absolutely the best double chocolate cookies ive ever eaten. I will use this recipe time and again :) thanks"
"0","5","Even better when adding coconut"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe. I used 1/2 Cup Butter, 1/2 Cup Shortening and the bite and spread of the cookie was fantastic. About 10 minutes in my oven worked perfectly. This chocolate batter would work well for any chip, nut or dried fruit mix-in. I will definitely make these again!"
"0","4","Super yummy, but I prefer them with less cocoa powder and half white, half brown sugar."
"0","5","Delicious!!! I added M&M's and used roughly chopped Ghirradelli semi sweet choc. chunks in place of the chocolate chips. I also took these cookies out of the oven after 7 minutes. Soft and chewy. Got rave reviews from family and only lasted a day. These are on my top 5 cookie recipes, for sure!"
"0","5","I added a full cup of pecans for nuts. They are now my favorite cookie"
"0","3","I made these EXACTLY as the recipe stated, but even after 15 minutes they weren't cooked all the way. I turned off the oven and let them cool completely in the oven before removing them and I still didn't get that chewy crunch on the outside. The flavor was great though, I love chocolate."
"0","5","Delicious cookies, very chocolate-y! I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. 8 minutes worked fine on my oven, they looked a bit undercooked when I took them out but finished cooking right on the sheet. I recommend chilling the dough as well, this kept my cookies from becoming flat. Thanks for the recipe, I really enjoyed these cookies."
"0","5","Great recipe! The cookies came out very soft and moist in the inside, crunchy on the outside and very chocolatey!Kids love them! Definitely a keeper, maybe with some nuts as well next time to vary the taste!"
"0","4","A Very good cookie! A little on the dry side but not awful. I used white chocolate instead of the semisweet to make it look prettier and hae a slight contrast in flavors."
"0","5","These cookies were AMAZING! I put peppermint extract in beside the vanilla and they were all gone in a day!"
"0","5","These are THE best cookies! I don't think I will ever make a normal choc. chip again."
"0","5","Yum!"
"0","5","OMG! These are SOOOOO good! I even forgot to add one of the sticks of butter then added it a the last minute and it STILL turned out good! I'm going to use this recipe to see if I can make regular chocolate chip cookies. AWESOME!"
"0","5","Yummy! I made these for the 2nd time last night to give out for Christmas to my co-workers. I used brown and white sugar instead of all white, and I also used a package of crushed Andes mint chocolates. They are perfect for the holidays! Or year round! I made them kind of small, about 2.5 inches in diameter so that yielded quite a bit of cookies - approx 7 dozen! And they do tend to be a little flat, but they're perfect for stacking and giving out. =) I will try it again with nuts next time."
"0","5","great cookies very easy"
"0","5","So simple. So perfect. I made half of the batch with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips and my little sister died and went to heaven."
"0","5","WOW WOW WOW!!! These are delicious! So chocolatey and great! I used half butter and half shortening and half brown sugar and half white sugar. Turned out perfect! I'm keepin this recipe. Thanks!"
"0","5","Love love love this recipe. My husband loves it, I have made this recipe many times already and I always get it as request for parties. I wouldn't change a thing in it."
"0","5","Delicious cookies! I topped the cookies with melted white chocolate chips and dashed a little bit of kosher salt onto it. (A tip I got from a Cooking Show) They turned out great and a batch was gone by the time they all got out!"
"0","5","Awesome cookies!! I added milk chocolate chips and and bittersweet also. Talk about a chocolate overdose!!"
"0","5","I made these without the walnuts and a bit less sugar, probably used 1.25 cups instead of 1.5 and they were fantastic. am about to make them for the second time, and will reduce the amount of chocolate chips because i thought there were a few too many. i'll probably use 1.5 cups instead of 2 cups. also, i have walnuts now too so will add them."
"0","5","I have made these 3 times now and always get rave reviews. I used shortening instead of butter because I never seem to have butter in the house and they still came out excellent."
"0","5","This recipe is excellent just as written. I used half margarine and half shortening, and baked for 8 minutes. When I took them out of the oven, I thought about baking another minute. I'm glad I didn't. After they cooled, they were perfect. I baked them for company coming the following day, but my husband and son almost finished them before the company got here!"
"0","4","Followed recipe to a T (but din add in the nuts). The texture of the cookie is amazing, crisp on the edges, soft on the inside. I like that it's not an overly sweet cookie... but overall, not chocolate-y enough! Next time, I'm gonna try using an entire cup of cocoa instead of just 2/3. Great chocolate cookie with lots of potential! Might try using 1/2cup semi-sweet choco chips and 1/2cup white chocolate chips next time to give it a lil extra OOMPH and to up the sweetness factor too. reminds me of a triple chocolate cranberry cookie i used to make back in highschool, but not as heavy. thanx for sharing dis recipe =)"
"0","5","The best cookies ever! The only changes I made was I split the sugar between half granulated and half brown sugar. And I put my dough in the freezer for about 20 miuntes before rolling it into small balls. My Husband thinks these were baught at a bakery they are so good!"
"0","5","These are EXCELLENT. Made today and put in mint M & M's for the holidays. I couldn't stop eating them!"
"0","5","Delish, soft cookies. Wouldn't change a thing!"
"0","5","WOW WOW WOW Absolute best cookies ever. Mix 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips too!"
"0","5","BEST cookies I have EVER had. Truly. A nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies. I made these 3 days ago and they are still wonderfully chewy and moist. My boyfriend and I cannot stop eating them. Brought them into work and my coworkers loved them as well. My boyfriend wants me to make these for the guys on his fire department. I will also be making them for Thanksgiving AND Christmas, thank you for the delicious recipe!!!!"
"0","5","I only made 1 dozen but followed the recipe exactly. Just make them - don't even question it. These are amazing!"
"0","5","These are SO scrumptious I can't stop snacking on them. The only thing I changed was using some mini white chocolate chips to get to the 2-cup mark (maybe 1/3 cup), since I didn't quite have enough regular chips. Added some more color."
"0","4","Just made these this morning and they are excellent. Made half with walnuts; half without and they're a hit!!!!"
"0","4","I love chocolate, and I loved these cookies!"
"0","5","I made these for a craft and bake gala at my sons school and everybody loved them!!"
"0","5","5 star great recipe, very moist and they were gone in seconds!!"
"0","5","Thank you for posting this recipe. Just made a batch. They are so soft and delicious, and very chocolate-y. Just thing I needed for today. I added a little more vanilla in my batch. I recommend this to anyone, try it. They turned out great. My bf had about 4 or 5 now."
"0","5","loved it!!! however, found a bit too sweet, how can I reduce the amount of sugar used in this recipe without messing up the consistency of dough?"
"0","5","I made these the night before our party and they were just as great the next day as they were right when they came out of the oven! They were very moist & chewy and did not dry out in the slightest. Everyone raved about these cookies!"
"0","5","Made this just as written. The second time used 1cup sugar, 1/2 dark brown sugar and added 1 cup dried cranberries. Also let the ingredients chill for an hour then rolled up ping-pong ball size and cooked for 11 minutes. Both are 5 star"
"0","5","I followed some of the previous suggestions -- I used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white and also undercooked them just a little. I also used mint chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and the result was delicious! If your a mint chocolate fan like me, I recommend it!"
"0","5","PERFECTION. 100%"
"0","5","OMG - YUMMMM. I followed ingredients exactly. I do chill any dough that has butter in it before baking. It helps keep the butter firm and keeps the cookies from spreading/flattening too much. My husband and I couldn't stop eating these."
"0","4","These were really rich and they were some of the best homemade cookies that I've had in a while, unfortunately i can only afford to make them every once in a while :) Great recipe for any chocolate lover!"
"0","5","Love love love this recipe."
"0","5","this was an awesome recipe! i put a splash of kaluha in and it was amazing!"
"0","5","My husband has officially dubbed these as the best cookies I have ever made! I used half butter and half shortening which gave them the perfect consistency. This may sound too sweet for a few of you - but I actually added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to this recipe. I felt like it needed a little boost - and they turned out great! 10 minutes is the perfect amount of time. They are still soft and chewy with melt in your mouth chocolate chips the next day!"
"0","5","LOVE these cookies! I've made them several times and everyone loves them! I made a few minor changes such as I use 1 cup of Crisco instead of butter (it makes them softer), I don't use the walnuts and I use Ghirardelli chocolate chips, because they are delicious"
"0","5","These ended up very fudgey for me but my family absolutely LOVES them...will cure ANY chocolate craving :)"
"0","4","Taste: Good. This dough was really tasty, although a little rich. Texture: Not a fan! They're too light and cake-like. I expected them to flatten out like cookies normally do, but they were lumpy & ugly. I decided to refrigerate the remaining dough & roll it into balls. Didn't work too well. Very messy & still lumpy. The texture is why I left off the 5th star. Not horrible, but not my favorite either."
"0","5","yum, yum, yum!!!!!!!!!!! DE.LI.CIOUSSS!!!!1"
"0","5","a major hit with any self-respecting chocolate lover. No shortage of chips, and the dough itself has a good chocolate flavor."
"0","5","These cookies were very moist and chocolaty. This is my new favorite cookie recipe. I made them with margarine because I had no butter and they turned out great."
"0","5","I use 100g of Macadamia instead of walmut. It comes out very delicious."
"0","5","Very nice! I too used half butter half shortening but cookies baked up lovely! Crispy outside, chewy inside."
"0","5","This is now my favorite cookie!!! Thank you!! :)"
"0","5","This was amazing! My kids loved it. This recipe is so simple and we had a blast baking them too!"
"0","5","Smelled wonderful, looked wonderful, and-best of all- tasted wonderful!!! this is a great recipe! i have no idea who WOULDN't like it!!!"
"0","4","My son loves this recipe. I used super fine sugar instead of regular ground sugar. As well, I used 1 cup of Milk chocolate chips. Then I used a meatball baller to scoop the cookies onto the cookie sheet and they did not go flat."
"0","5","I often double the recipe, excellent!"
"0","4","These cookies were pretty good! Very easy to make. They came out soft and brownie-like. I took the suggestion of others and made the cookies on the smaller side since they are rich especially with the chocolate chips."
"0","5","Phenomenal!! I used wheat flour and egg whites and halved the recipe. Everything turned out fabulous. I topped each cookie with chocolate ganache. Yum!"
"0","5","This recipe is Great! I love chocolate! With this recipe I make bar cookies and I like to use mini chocolate chips (1 cup instead of 2). Also goes really well with whipped cream on top- YUM. I'd recommend these cookies to anyone :)"
"0","5","OMG! Whenever I make these now they last less than two days! I make them small because they are so rich, but no one seems to mind. the other day I threw pecans in a batch and loved them even more!"
"0","4","caleb and oden liked, i wasn't that excited about them. soft band stayed soft"
"0","5","I baked these cookies twice now and they are delicious! I halved the recipe (Because it's just me and my fiance) but they were gone in a day or two! A few in the afternoon with tea or coffee is the perfect snack."
"0","5","Wonderful cookies. Instead of using 2 cups of semi-chocolate chips, I used 1 cup semi-chocolate and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips. Also I added chocolate pudding and did half of the sugar with brown sugar. They turned out great. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Mouthwatering good! These cookies are wonderful. I made them with 1 cup of chocolate chips and one cup of cappuccino chips and they were fantastic!"
"0","5","These are great super moist cookies. I used Special Dark Cocoa and it was big hit."
"0","5","I just made them and they are like a brownie cookie explosion. so yummy. i decided to put a bit of icing sugar on top with a sift and that made them even better."
"0","5","4.5stars This is the first time I made cookies and they tasted great! Just like those you buy outside! It was really crispy and a little soft in the centre, a little like brownies in fact! But REALLY nice! I used 250g sugar instead of the recommended 300g and it was a little sweet for me already."
"0","5","i made these for a couple of family gatherings and man oh man do they LOOVEE these cookies. I added dark chocolate so it wont be to sweet"
"0","5","these cookies are great! Super easy and very chocolatey! A big success with the kids!"
"0","4","Very good. I loved the texture of this cookie, soft yet firm. mmmm..good!"
"0","4","Very good, but they're a little crispier than I like my cookies. I think next time I'll have to pull them out sooner."
"0","5","These were great! I made some of the batter in cookie form and made the rest into a cake pan, so I had a large cookie square. It was the best cookie/brownie fusion I've ever had. I used about 3/4 of the batter and put it into a 8X11 glass baking dish. Then I baked it for 20 mins. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream on top. YUM!!"
"0","5","my husband and I love them, chocolate heaven!!"
"0","5","So yummy! I followed the recipe exactly except I used white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chips. I also used a small ice cream scoop to drop the batter so all the cookies were the same size and baked them for 9 minutes. The cookies turned out deliciously soft and chewy."
"0","5","These cookies are the best cookies I have ever made! I have made them about 15 times and they are never any left overs! Delicious! Also the cookie dough is awesome!"
"0","4","Easy and delicious! I brought them to a friend's BBQ and got many compliments!"
"0","5","easy recipe. these are great! i think dried cherries would go really good with these. this is def. a keeper :)"
"0","5","FANTASTIC!!!! i've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time and now this is the one that i will use!"
"0","5","Great recipe, refrigerating the dough helps keep cookies fluffy."
"0","5","Amazing! I used 1/2 of the butter and substituted applesauce for the other half. I think it made them more moist and almost brownie like and a little healthier."
"0","5","u know if you change the chocolate to chocolate WITH 75% coco, then these biscuits turn into the most delicious brownies i have EVER had.. and baked them in muffins cups, kept them thin and baked for 11 min.. try this, and u'd be glad u did :)"
"0","5","I tried this cookie recipe this morning...I have to tell you these are the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies we have ever eaten!! They are so moist and delicious. I will be bringing these cookies to a barbecue later this afternoon and I know they will not last long!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written...the only thing I added was about 2 cups of coconut which made them delicious. Try this recipe...you won't be disappointed. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!"
"0","5","these cookies were fantastic! i took note at what one reviewer said and did half butter half shortening; they turned out perfect! i also swapped the semisweet chips for peanut butter chips. it was like eating a reese's peanut butter cup, only better. they were to die for, will definitely make again!"
"0","4","So chocolaty and gooey. Delicious."
"0","5","I do not have the best record when it comes to cookies, but these came out great! I used peanut butter and chocolate chips because that's what I had and they are really yum. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious!! These are SO chocolately, gooey and soft - just like I like them! I used 100% natural cane sugar instead of white sugar and subsituted 2 oz bittersweet chocolate for the chocolate chips. They turned out excellent and I will definitely make them again!"
"0","5","Deeelish! Fiance and I love them! Chocolatey, but not too sweet. Perfect!"
"0","5","YUM! They are soft and melt in our mouth goodness. I added semi sweet and white chocolate chips as well as dried cranberries. I didn't change anything else in the recipe. They came out great. Be watchful with the baking time since they are dark and you can't tell if they are finished just by looking at them. 8-9 mins.= perfect cookies."
"0","4","I didn't like these that much, but my son did. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and I only had 1.5 cups, which seemed to be enough to me. They come out nice and soft if you don't over cook them."
"0","5","Amazing!!!! I added a cup of white chocolate and a cup of dark chocolate chips and they turned out fabulous! Highly recommend for chocolate lovers like me!"
"0","5","This is my favorite cookie recipe. They are irresistably good. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 c. of white sugar. This is the only change I made."
"0","5","Best cookies I have ever had--and I've heard this from others as well. Use both semi-sweet and white chocolate chips for a beautiful cookie. I've also put in peanut better chips, which were a huge hit."
"0","5","use green mint chips instead of regular. amazing. allys favorite in 2010!! used with reg. choc chips and that was good too."
"0","5","I did as a few other entries suggested and changed the sugar to 3/4c Brown Sugar and 3/4c white. I also used 1/2 cups of both shortening and butter. Instead of just 2 cups of chocolate chips, I did 1 cup of Reese peanut butter chips, about 3/4 cup of dark chocolate and a broken up Hersheys bar. They came out FANTASTIC! YUM :) Thick, soft, chocolately. The perfect chocolate chocolate chip cookie"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! No changes made to the ingredients. I did chill the dough for about half an hour before baking as recommended by another reviewer. The only problem with these, they are way too good and keep you coming back for more!"
"0","5","The best chocolate-chocolate chip cookies out there!"
"0","3","Okay cookie but I'll keep looking."
"0","5","Delicious cookie! I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I used a milk chocolate bar cut in chunks. Best double chocolate chip cookie I've ever made."
"0","5","Delicious!!! I popped the batter in the fridge to chill for about 20 minutes before I baked for 8 minutes. PERFECT cookies!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Almost like little cookie shaped brownies. This is a very rich, dark chocolate tasting cookie. Very suitable for chocolate amateurs!"
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","What a super chocolately treat. My four year old loved them, as did my husband and I. I made the whole recipe, and froze them into little balls so I could just pull a few out and bake whenever I need (or want!) them. It worked great. My favorite double chocolate cookie recipe!"
"0","3","Didn't really care for these too well. Probably would be better with a few changes but I'll just use another recipe next time."
"0","5","These are sinfully delicious! I'm not so good at cooking cookies but these turned out surprisingly well....not as flat as is typical for me :) I didn't change a thing...yummy!"
"0","5","My family loved them will be making them again shortly I'm sure."
"0","5","I will make these again and again. I used macadamia nuts, that was the only change that I made to this recipe. My husband was standing right next to me as the first pan came out of the oven. He couldn't stop 'mmmmmmmmmmming'."
"0","5","I used the recommendations from others and they tasted great!!! I didn't use semisweet chocolate chips, but white chocolate chips and butterscotch. Yum!"
"0","5","Wonderful Recipe. I put Mint chips in instead of chocolate chips. OMGosh! If you like mint chocolate chips, there you go. Thanks for the Recipe!"
"0","5","PERFECT....we didn't have walnuts, so we used pistachios....looked a little funky with the green, but it tasted really good!!!"
"0","5","I made these for a bake sale and they were gone in a flash! Super Yummy! Mine were a little dry, cake like. That's my preference. Not sure why they were."
"0","5","Excellent! I used half butter, half crisco. I also used half white sugar, half brown sugar."
"0","5","Used a full Tablespoon of vanilla, and replaced 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. Taste great. Cooking time fine at 8 mins."
"0","5","Really great recipe! My husband is French and finds traditional chocolate chip cookies lacking (we disagree on this!) but he LOVES these. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used half white sugar and half brown. And then I also used half white chocolate chips and half chocolate, just to be fancy! They are GOOD!"
"0","4","I was nervouse to make this recipe after reading some of the negative reviews. When they first came out of the oven I didnt think I liked them much, but after a few hours I found they were really tasty! They are still moist today 3 days later. Good recipe. I used margarine instead of butter as I do for most of my baking and the substitution worked fine."
"0","4","No as much flavour in the batter as you would expect. Freezes well."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out amazing and delicious!!!"
"0","4","these turned out great! very fluffy and delicious-very chocolatey! :)"
"0","3","Not as chocolate-y as I would have liked, and a tad too sweet. I also used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter as others had recommended, but rather I wished I hadn't. Probably would not make again."
"0","5","these cookies are delicious... i only substituted the chocolate chips for white chips, sold them in a bake sale and came out successful!!! thx Kathy"
"0","5","If I could give these 20 stars I would, So good. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and used pecans instead of walnuts. Oh my gosh- Make - these- cookies- today ! Thank you for a great recipe"
"0","3","This is a good recipe, however I cooked it for 8 min. and the cookies burned on the bottom. I reduced the cook time to 6 min with the same effect. I think a 4-5 min cook time should be max."
"0","5","These are AWESOME!!! I'm a true chocoholic, and these are not for the faint at heart. The only difference in my cookies were that I used Hershey's special dark cocoa instead of the regular cocoa to deepen the chocolate flavor. VERY rich! Love it! (I've made them with regular cocoa before as well and gave them as gifts. We and our recipients loved those too.) Also, I gently rolled the dough in my hands to shape it out before putting on the baking sheet. Made for perfectly round cookies. They didn't really spread at all, so shaping them makes a big asthetic difference. :)"
"0","5","WOW! Finally, a chocolate chip cookie that doesn't look like a frisbee! I did follow some suggestions and used 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugars and 1/2 cup margarine (one stick) and 1/2 cup shortening. P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!!"
"0","5","These were excellent. Followed the directions to the T."
"0","5","these were very good. if you really like the taste that cocoa powder can give to baked goods than these might not be for you but i thought they were very tasty and beware: they look hard and crunchy from the outside but they are really soft and chewy inside. UPDATE: the second day and days after these cookies are very cakey but still delicious"
"0","5","Used coconut oil instead of butter, whole wheat flour, one cup organic sugar and one cup chopped dark chocolate baking bar. Followed everything else. Turned out great (don't like excessively sweet food). Kids give it a thumbs up, say that warm they taste like a fudgy brownie almost. Haven't tried them cold yet. They hardly flattened when cooking, I had to flatten them with a spatula when they came out of the oven."
"0","5","I made this with white chocolate chips, like the cookies you get at Subway. If you live with family/roommates, save yourself some work and make a full batch-my half-batch was gone within the day."
"0","5","Best cookies I've ever made! The recipe calls for quite a few, so I made them on Valentine's day and took the leftovers out to visit some friends. Everyone was raving about them and ate almost all of them! I put them in a Ziploc on the counter and they stayed super moist and chewy for almost three days!"
"0","4","I made a half batch and they came out a little dry so I added another egg and some water...they still came out GREAT!! Who doesn't love chocolate??"
"0","4","Very good. I added some white chocolate chips as well. I, unfortunately, did not read the other reviews before jumping into this recipe. My cookies came out a little flat, so chilling it before hand should help (since I used butter). Great flavor though!!"
"0","5","SO GOOD!!! All I changed was subbing in a 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of using all white sugar based on other reviews. So easy, and everybody loved these!"
"0","5","I followed this recipe EXACTLY and my husband and I absolutely love these cookies. They are soft, chewy, and delicious. Thank you!"
"0","2","The cookies tasted okay, but they were incredibly crumbly and fell apart. They did not form like normal cookies, we had to flatten them with a spoon before sticking them into the oven. Over all the consistency is not what you would expect from a cookie."
"0","5","I made these with Reese's peanut butter chips instead of semisweet and they came out amazing!!! Didn't change a thing. It's a good idea to let dough sit in fridge for a while so that they don't come out flat."
"0","5","Very Yummy! I had to have a 'CH' word for my son's sharing at school, we made these to share with the class and what a big hit! We added 1/2 white chocolate chips, 1/4 regular choc. chips and the rest M&M's. (was almost out of reg. choco. chips) will definitely do it this same way next time! Other than the change of the choc. chips followed the recipe. Can't wait to make these again."
"0","5","Used half butter half shortening. I used PB chips in half the batch and mint chips in the other half. These cookies were great. Nice and crispy on the outside, soft and gooey in the middle. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Wow! Those really turned out fantastic! I halved the recipe and ommited the walnuts. I refrigerated them for a couple hours but they still turned out flat...However, this is a fast, easy recipe with a great taste so it deserves 5 stars in my book =)"
"0","5","Wow these are good. I did tweak the recipe a little. I used a tablespoon of shortening due to some of the reviews I read. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. I used dark chocolate chips and pecans. These are just great cookies. Thank you"
"0","5","I made this exactly as directed except I used 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips. I was a bit worried at first as the dough is rather thick. But WOW are they good! My family loved them. I will definitely make this over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","I just made these and they are perfect as written. I followed recipe exactly and they are PERFECT! So good!! My husband asked me to marry him again because he loved them so much. Make this recipe, you will not be disappointed."
"0","5","these are fab! They are like little brownie cookies. I used margarine (Stork brand as I live in the UK). I also used one pkg plain chocolate drops (Asda) and one pkg of Milk chocolate chips (Tesco)- because these were the ingredients I had on hand. I chilled the dough for an hour, and I turned down my oven to 150C because my oven tends to be very hot. They turned out brillant!! I love the tip someone put about lining your baking sheets with foil - EXCELLENT IDEA!! I cannot rave enough about these cookies. My family loved them!!! thankyou"
"0","5","Very delicious!"
"0","5","These cookies are fantastic! I usually add reeses pieces to them instead of chocolate chips and it is an addicting combination. So addicting that my friend nick named them crack cookies, because she could not stop eating them."
"0","5","They are great. I had compliments from my friends. Bake for 9 mins for a softer texture or up to 10 mins for more crisp and dryer cookies."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! I am a die-hard chocoholic, so these were made for me. I only made 1/2 batch (so I wouldn't gain too much weight when I ate them all). :o) I divided the sugar - used 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar. It didn't look chocolately enough to me, so I also added a little more cocoa and lessened the flour - to compensate. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I made the cookies with a small disher, so they were bigger than the recipe suggested. I cooked them 8 1/2 minutes, but they could have used another minute (being a bigger size). If I made them the suggested teaspoon size I definitely wouldn't cook more than 8 minutes. The recipe is terrific. Definitely a keeper!!!"
"0","5","These are AWESOME! We made ours with white chocolate chips - perfect!!! So delicious!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! So easy to make, as other reviewers suggested I did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white. I also refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking and they came out delicious. My oven had them done in about 10 min for soft chewy cookies."
"0","5","These are great cookies, will definitely make again."
"0","5","I also used 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter and I swapped half the white sugar for brown sugar. These were fabulous and SO SO chocolaty! Yum!"
"0","5","If these are eaten warm they are very very chocolaty once they cool they are very good. I won't change anything."
"0","5","Very tasty recipe. I substituted 2 things: 1) I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar per another reviewer's recommendation and 2) I used 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 chocolate chips. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the peanut butter taste in there!"
"0","5","second time in my life making cookies like this, and these ones came out the BEST!"
"0","5","One word: Yum. (If that is even a word.) My friends call these 'brownie cookies.'"
"0","4","These cookies are super easy to make and very good!"
"0","5","WOW! these are truly AMAZING!!!"
"0","5","mmm...i've made these cookies several time, and they have been great every time! The only difference is that I often use self rising flour and just skip the salt/baking soda. I have not had the drying out issue that I have seen in other reviews; didn't do anything special, just store them in an airtight container, and they stay yummy for a week!"
"0","5","Simply the best cookies ever!"
"0","3","i think it is a great consistency. it bakes up to make picture perfect cookies. I followed the additional salt and vanilla and baking powder. The dough itself didnt have much flavor. I will try another recipe."
"0","5","These were a huge hit with the family. I used a hand blender at the beginning for the butter/sugar/egg etc. and then hand stirred the rest which was quit a work out for the arms!! Otherwise very easy and will be making these again. Thanks!!!"
"0","5","Delicious. My boys loved them. I am not usually a huge chocolate chip cooie fan and found them melting in my mouth. Will definitely do them again and make it one of my regulars for desert. Also did the 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup shortening (only had 1/2 cup butter on hand, so it worked out well). Other then that everything the same."
"0","5","Ah-mazing! These cookies were the best choc. choc. chip cookies EH-VA!"
"0","5","These are wonderful...The family had them half gone by the time I got them all baked...We all enjoyed very much.."
"0","5","These have been warmly welcomed in our home, but we've renamed them to 'Malcolm's Favourites'"
"0","5","Wow! soft, chewy, chocolatey - without it being too much!"
"0","5","Very good! Turned out great! Very rich.. every time I pop one in my mouth, I cant stop eating and get sick because they are so sweet lol. I did what other people recommended and used half brown and half white sugar and also used half shortening and half butter. Really delicious and addicting! Great recipe, thanks for sharing."
"0","5","Excellent recipe Kathy! I didn't have choc chips so i did the recipe minus them and the nuts and they turned out YUMMY!!! I also did as other reviewers and did half white and half brown sugar. i love the taste of brown sugar in my cookies!!!"
"0","4","I just loved the taste of these cookies, the only disappointment was they turned out flat (even though I did my usual trick and put the dough in the fridge for 60 mins). I used 1/2 cup of oats instead of the nuts and used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar."
"0","5","subbed reese's pieces for chocolate chips, and used half a cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar. delicious! :)"
"0","5","These were AMAZING, the only thing that I changed was using half white sugar and half dark brown soft sugar. I also added 75g rams of melted cooking chocolate into the mixture. Absolutely fab!"
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful little browine bites."
"0","5","i chose to use chocolate chips and reeses peanut butter chips and they were delicious!! kids loved them!"
"0","5","These are great. Made recipe with ingredients listed. Came out nice a crinkled. Nice that you only need cocoa in this recipe. Give these a try!"
"0","5","These should be called...are you kidding me? cookies! They are incredible...chocolatey goodness. I had no trouble keeping them moist for the 3 days they lasted in the house. They were a little thin and required 12-14 minutes. I am making these again and trying to freeze the dough for 10 minutes so they may be thicker. I am also going to add dried cherries in some of them...can't wait!"
"0","5","So moist, so yummy! made with mint chips, and got rave reviews!"
"0","5","Great recipe! Black walnuts and large chocolate chips make it spectacular"
"0","5","Best cookies ever! Hint, soften the butter!"
"0","5","I made these last night and at the request of my 5 y/o, left out the nuts and chocolate chips, ' 'cuz nuts are yucky and you're apposed to eat chocolate chips, Mommy!' Anyway, these are the best chocolate cookies we've ever eaten! And this is saying a lot as I am addicted to the choc. cookies from Whole Foods!"
"0","5","Fantastic. Everyone raved."
"0","5","Awsome cookie. The little ones loved them and so did the big ones. Used the recipe just as is, including the walnuts. Cooked for 10 minutes to be safe and was still moist inside. Next time I'll use 1 and 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat - they'll never know!!!!"
"0","5","This is a super simple cookie recipe (with no fridge time, a plus for me). I used Andes Mint chips instead of regular chocolate chips and these cookies are to DIE FOR!! In a good way, that is. They come out fluffy and have great flavor. I will make these again, and again, and again."
"0","5","These cookies were excellent. I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar when I baked them. I added Nestle's half semisweet, half mint chocolate chips, and chilled the dough for about an hour. Almost all of them were gone within a day!"
"0","5","I ate waaaaaay too many of these already. Excellent recipe. Had to bake mine for a tad bit longer though. Also substituted chopped up Lindt chocolate for chocolate chips (received chocolate overload this Christmas). However, if you do that, you've got to watch the cookies carefully as Lindt chocolate burns pretty easily!"
"0","5","Great recipe, a definite keeper! i didn't have enough cocoa powder so i melted some leftover baking chocolate and added it to the mix, it made it sooo goey and yummy."
"0","5","YUMYUMYUM! I was searching for a good Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe for so long and now I've found it. These cookies are delicious and I'm impressed. Very rich mouthwatering chocolate taste. The best combo for me are half and half chocolate chips (black and white), and I'm not using the baking chocolate chips because they don`t taste well in Germany. Thats why I'm chopping my favourite chocolate bars. I chilled the dough for 2 hours to prevent flat cookies - like many other. It works fine! Thank you for this fanstastic recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious Delicious cookies. Make them for the chocolate love in your family."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I used milk chocolate chips and white chocolate chunks. The family loves them!"
"0","4","Near perfect and definitely for chocolate lovers! My cookies came out of the oven nice and puffy, but then became flat and chewy as they cooled. I may try as another review suggested and refrigerate the dough for an hour before baking and see if they come out more cakey. The flavor is awesome, though!"
"0","5","YUM! Super chocolatey and delicious. I had to cook them for 10 minutes though... even doing 8 and having them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes wasn't enough in my oven."
"0","5","So good! I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips and left out the walnuts."
"0","5","As a quick treat this was perfect. I threw these together in short order, since all the ingredients are pretty common was simple and effortless... maybe because I was eyeballing most of the measurements; but, regardless they were excellent!"
"0","5","We didn't want to make another trip to the store so we made it with what we had: light margarine instead of butter, egg substitute instead of eggs, and chopped Hershey's chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips. The result was a VERY soft, brownie/cake-like cookie. I could see them being too soft for some but they were delicious for us!"
"0","5","I've been looking for a really good chocolate chip recipe and I'm so thrilled to say I've found it! Like other reviewers, I adjusted the recipe to 3/4 C sugar and 3/4 C brown sugar, and 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C lard/shortening. I also beat the wet ingrediants for several minutes, until it was as light and fluffy as it could be. The batter was like a fluffy icing, I could've eaten it just like that. I baked for exactly 8 minutes, which was perfect--left them a bit underdone inside. I will SOOO be making these again. Thank you to whoever added this recipe."
"0","5","If your looking for Chocolate... This is the recipe for you! Very easy to make! I used parchment paper and had not sticking. Big hit with the kids and hubby!"
"0","5","Oh, WOW!!!!!! Dec - a - dent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","4","WOAH. So rich and delicious. They literally knocked us off our feet. I can't figure out why they are so rich!"
"0","5","Made these with half semi-sweet chips and half Hershey's Mini Kisses milk chocolate chips - beyond decadent. Make sure you've got a glass of milk ready!"
"0","5","A HIT!!!!!!! These taste so amazing! They are fluffy, chewy, and VERY delicious! I only did a few things different, I added half white chips, and half chocolate chips. I also followed some other reviews and used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. Then I split the sugars- 3/4 cup White Sugar, 3/4 cup Brown Sugar. I added a tiny bit more flour as well...maybe 1/4 cup more. MMMMMMMMM!!! The family ate them up! They even hid some!"
"0","5","Great recipe!The chocolate dough is the perfect sweetness, not too sweet, not too bitter. Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I added an entire bag of chocolate chunks AND an entire bag of Andes mint chips. Yum!!"
"0","5","These cookies are fantastic! they taste like brownies, I love nuts in cookies so I also added chopped pecans. Great recipe. Thanks"
"0","5","These were DELICIOUS after a minor adjustment. I LOVE chocolate but I don't like it too sweet, and to make it more healthy, I replaced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. MMM delicious. It even gives it a nicer aroma to it!"
"0","5","These are delicious!"
"0","5","butterscotch chips have a nice taste to them as well white chocolate chips too! refrigerate dough 30 minutes prior to baking bake for seven minutes"
"0","3","I did the 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening thing & my cookies still came out flat. I have been trying to find a cake-like soft chocolate cookie, I'm still looking. These have great flavor and the presentation is awesome, especially when you use the foil trick from another review."
"0","5","My kiddos and I made these per the recipe to put out for Santa tonight. YUM ! I can guarantee you that Old Saint Nick will be extra jolly after tasting these chocolately little gems. They are our new favorite cookies. If you are as much of a chocolate addict as we are, then these are your cookies. ENJOY!"
"0","5","By far, these are the BEST chocolate cookies ever to come out of my oven. Super easy to make. Instead of regular chocolate chips, I used some white chocolate chips mixed in with some mint chips- all I can say is 'Mmmmm... awesome!' I'd rave some more, but I have to go make up another batch to replace the dozens that mysteriously vanished from my kitchen!"
"0","1","I found these very dry. Would like to know what I could add to make them more moist."
"0","5","Fantastic, easy and delicious!"
"0","5","I use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa...fantastic. Love these cookies."
"0","5","I did as other reviewers suggested and did half brown sugar and half white. That's the only change I made other than omitting the nuts (only because I didn't have any) and these cookies were delicious."
"0","5","SOOOO GOOD. I mostly ate it in dough form. I made this really quickly, except that I had trouble with the butter--it was still cold when I put it in the mixer and crumbled. I fixed it by microwaving the mixture (in a different bowl of course)--perfect. I adjusted the recipe for 24 and used 6 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup applesauce--next time I'll try it with more applesauce to make it healthier. I used a little less sugar than called for. Besides that, pretty much followed the recipe to the t. It was nice and rich and gooey and soft--but not painfully sweet. YUM!"
"0","5","I followed the directions exactly, but I used a bag of mint and semisweet morsels instead (and no nuts), and these are hands-down my family's new favorite cookie! These are really fast to prepare and when served with a tall glass of refreshing milk can't be beat! THANK YOU."
"0","5","OMG- If you like cake-like or brownie-like cookies then these are for you! These are THE BEST cookies I have ever had. The only things I changed were using half white sugar and half brown, and half butter half shortening. Simply delicious! Thank you so much! These are a keeper! =)"
"0","5","I used 1/2 Cup butter and 1/2 Cup shortening, 1 Cup white sugar 1/2 Cup brown sugar. I also used white chocolate chips. My husband and son love them. My son says these are the best cookies ever!"
"0","5","YUM!! These cookies were the easiest to make, and were a huge hit with everyone! I used holiday M&Ms for festivity. I had to leave them in the oven for a couple extra minutes, but other than that, no changes need be made :) Enjoy!"
"0","5","I recently made these cookies for a cookie exchange party at my office and they were a HUGE hit! The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I used mint chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chocolate chips! The mint was an tasty surprise to everyone and really pleased the palate! I will definitely bake these cookies more often!"
"0","5","I just made these after seeing the recipe for the 2st time and OMG I luv them - and so does everyone else!!!!!!!! I have to make another batch already!"
"0","5","LOVED these cookies, but made some modifications. I sometimes get flat cookies like another reviewer, so I used 1/2 brown sugar in lieu of part of the white sugar. Good call. I also substituted chopped Andes Candies for choc chips. Magnificent! Next time will experiment with some dried cherries or cranberries with chocolate chips! Very simple and tasty cookie."
"0","5","Delicious! I also used half brown sugar/half white sugar."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious. You can't go wrong with chocolate on chocolate. My friends call them 'Feel Better' cookies and I'm always being asked to make more! I use chocolate chunks instead of chips, and I'm often baking them longer than 10 minutes."
"0","5","My picky 16 year-old-daughter begged me for something sweet. So I decided to make her 'comfort food' Chocolate chip cookies. The only problem is, I didn't have any brown sugar. I told my daughter I was going to try to make them without the brown sugar. She protested vehemently, we only had one (1) bag of chocolate chips and being that we were stranded in a blizzard in Iowa today with about 3 feet of snow piled up on our deck and wind gusts of 50 mph. I only had one chance to get it right. So I searched All Recipes and came across this recipe.I didn't tell her I was was just going to go for it. Anyway I made them, and added the first cup of flour the batter seemed pretty thick so I tested just one in the oven. I do that on recipes I find, so I don't waste the whole batch, the cookie was thin. So I added the rest of the flour as the reciped had suggested in the first place. The cookies taste excellent and they look perfect, just as another reviewer stated, just like something you would get from the bakery. The only thing I added was an extra 2 tsp of vanilla. My daughter was happy and I am still her hero. I saved the day in this crazy blizzard."
"0","3","My cookies didn't turn out very well. They were horribly flat and even after baking them 10 minutes they werent cooked in the center. Next time I think I will try half butter and half shortening."
"0","4","My husband gave them a five, I a four but it is a very good recipe. I do not care for chocolate chips, so I used double the cocoa powder. Any high quality dark cocoa powder will do. I used Dutch brand Bensdorp. Next time I would use no Vanilla extract, triple the cocoa powder and add one extra egg to keep the moisture in, then I would have the perfect moist cookie. I feel Vanilla, especially of the artificial variety, would and did kill this recipe. I won't add it again, it fights the chocolate for attention."
"0","5","I've made these a few times now and the recipe as-is is excellent. Very chocolately, and soft and tender on the inside, which is the way I like it. As some reviewers suggested I tried it with half sugar and half brown sugar and this gives a nice depth of flavour. I've also used 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks and 1 cup white chocolate chips instead of the nuts to make it a triple chocolate cookie! It's definitely worth a try for all you chocoholics out there =)"
"0","5","Loved them! I left out the nuts and exchanged one of the teaspoons of vanilla for a teaspoon of peppermint extract to give it a minty flavor, and they turned out really well! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","YUM."
"0","4","really tasty and easy to bake. i went with the half butter and half shortening and that really helped. but unfortunately i overcooked the first batch a little because they didn't look done at 8 minutes, but they turned out a little hard. i took the next batch out earlier and they were great!"
"0","5","These cookies are just what you'd imagine -- chocolate-y and delicious!"
"0","5","my boyfriend is in love w these cookies!.... and so does all my friends. but for the holidays (and since he likes minty flavored stuff) i grind up some candycanes and sprinkle them on top of the cookies before sending it in the oven. the result is a nice soft/chewy cookie and when u get to the candy canes, u get a crunch! NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!!! :-)"
"0","4","These were good cookies, super chocolatey, but they not as good as I expected them to be after reading all the wonderful reviews! They did stay soft for days though, so that was pretty good. I left the walnuts out this time, but if I make again I will be sure to add them. I think they would add a nice taste to the cookie."
"0","5","These cookies were very moist and delicious. Everyone loved them, needless to say they did not last long!"
"0","5","Love this recipe! I make it all the time and my friends always beg me to make more! I only change one thing though: instead of walnuts, I use about 1 cup of reeses pieces (more or less is fine - I don't measure it). The extra peanut butter kick is AMAZING. My roommate even claimed that they were the best cookies she had ever had (she's a huge chocolate/peanut butter lover). Try them! They're so quick and easy to make too!"
"0","5","excellent cookie"
"0","5","These are the most amazing cookies I've ever made. I did, however, take out the walnuts and make it half semi-sweet chips and half white-chocolate chips, to mimick Otis Spunkmeyer's cookies of this similar flavor. Everyone I make them for goes NUTS and becomes addicted!!!!"
"0","5","These are so good! I didn't have large egg so I use jumbo and I did 1 cup semisweet chocolate chip and 1 cup white chocolate chip. they came out moist.I lower the oven to 325 since; I had a dark nonstick baking sheet (i also use parchment paper). This is my first time baking chocolate chocolate chip cookies and they taste better than at the store!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe with White Chocolate Chips. It was excellent. Also if you drop the cocoa powder, I found that they result is also very good, not too sweet but just sweet enough so that you don't regret it later ;P. Still though simply amazing! I could barely manage to have one when I served them to my friends."
"0","5","Needs longer cooking time, 10 mins. But delicious"
"0","5","I Melted the butter and cooked 1 1/2-2 minutes less to make it more chewy and they're DELICIOUS!!!! Wonderful recipe"
"0","5","these cookies are nothing but great. everyone loves them. i put little less sugar and choped cooking chocolate instead of chocolate chips. everyone that tried them wants the recipe. good job :)"
"0","5","PERFECT! (We used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 regular sugar - 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening too! :) My 15 year old son made these and said they are BOMB! lol! :)"
"0","4","I made these with mint chocolate chips and they tasted like those mint thins. These are awesome."
"0","5","Yummy!!!"
"0","5","Excellent!!! Absolutely delicious! I almost forgot to say, but I only used 1 cup of sugar which was just perfect."
"0","5","These are incredible and a hit EVERYTIME I make them!"
"0","5","Love them, love them, love them. This made enough to last our family at least for a week (since my husband is on a diet)otherwise they would have been gone in 2 days. Great for kids school lunches, etc... Will definately make these again."
"0","4","i baked this and added half a yogurt can it was great"
"0","5","tasted great! I had a few problems. made some in my toaster oven and cooked too fast..turned it down to 250 n came out great. but when done in my big oven they flattened out too much. still tasted could but were crunchier and real thin."
"0","5","These are amazing cookies! Everyone absolutely loved them!! Thanks Kathy for a new addition to my cookie rotation."
"0","4","Very chocolatly and tasty! My daughter says they are 'the best'"
"0","5","these would have been totally out of this world if only i'd had baking soda, lol"
"0","5","So delicious!"
"0","5","These are awesome! They aren't my favorite since they are SO chocolatey, but the chocoholics can't get enough. I baked them for 10 minutes and they were still perfectly chewy--more like a brownie than a typical cc cookie. I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar but forgot to try 1/2 shortening for the butter. Next time I'd like to try white chocolate chips for a change."
"0","5","Ok so I am completely confident this recipe would be tops without any changes. Due to limited ingredients, I did make some adjustments. As suggested I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco. Then with limited sugar, I used 1/2 cup granulated and 1 3/4 cup powdered. I omitted the nuts and made these with 2 1/2 cups of mixed chips (semisweet, butterscotch and white chips.) They came out soooo good, that I would make them with the strange sugar combination again next time, but look forward to trying them again with another combination of chips. Maybe chocolate and peanut butter. YUM!"
"0","5","This is a keeper! Tastes like a cookie version of a brownie. I used crisco instead of butter, because I always do in cookies, and I used 1/2 C brown sugar, and 1 cup white sugar, just because it seemed like a good idea. I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","AWESOME. These are guaranteed to kill even the strongest of chocolate cravings!"
"0","5","perfect! i saved half the dough to make the rest for the hubs to take to work. they were even awesome w/o the walnuts."
"0","4","OMG - chocolate! I cut the sugar with Splenda, that's the only change I made. I could only eat one and everyone that knows me knows I love all that is chocolate so these are really rich. Taking them to work tomorrow as I'm afraid most will go to waste since a little goes a long way (good for satisfying your chocolate craving without adding to much to your waistline!)."
"0","4","Made them exactly as written. Very moist and yummy!!"
"0","5","These cookies were yummy! I made the recipe the same except I added a cup of white chocolate and a cup of dark chocolate chips for a little different taste. I recommend it...tastes so good!"
"0","5","Delightful cookies. The semisweet chocolate chips and the chocolate from the cookie give it a dark chocolate flavor for any dark chocolate lovers out there. It was extremely easy to make and definitely worth repeating."
"0","5","Very good! I made exactly as written. At first they had a bitter cocoa taste to them, but the next day they had mellowed and the right amount of chocolate to sweetness...yummy! Thanks, Kathy!"
"0","4","I made these vegan by substituting Earth Balance shortening for the butter and 3 Tbsp applesauce for the eggs and they came out great! Super easy recipe with very satisfying results; can't wait to make them again"
"0","3","Meh. Not a bad recipe by any means, but I found them too cocoa-ey. I'll keep using my double-chocolate cookie recipe which uses melted chocolate instead of cocoa."
"0","4","These were very rich and chocolaty. I followed prev. suggestions used half-brown and half-white sugar, and baked for only 8 minutes to keep them soft. Personally, I prefer a more chewy texture, but these were still a great chocolate fix. If I make them again I'll double the nuts - I hate it when you only get one or two in a whole cookie."
"0","5","I live in Denver, Colorado (high altitude). My teenage daughters and I made this recipe and we followed all the directions and ingredients exactly. These are some of the best cookies we have had. My brother and his girlfriend also loved them and they are very picky about their sweets."
"0","5","Really tasty cookies. They have a nice balance of chocolate and aren't too sweet. i took the advice and put the dough in the fridge for an hour before baking and the cookies didn't flatten out. super moist too, people called them 'brookies' b/c they were brownie-like cookies. I'll definitely keep this recipe."
"0","5","These cookies are just simply amazing. These are by far the best cookie I have ever baked. I made these with my 2 year old and she loved helping and enjoying the result. I kept the sugar the same, I used half Crisco and half butter and I only had half the amount of chocolate chips available so I used a broken up Ghirardelli chocolate bar too. Absolute heaven. I plan to impress and bribe with these!"
"0","5","I made this because I needed chocolate right away, but after starting to mix it up I realized I only had whole wheat flour in the house. Decided to make it that way anyway, and they tasted great!"
"0","5","These are amazing, especially when you make them as chocolate chocolate chocolate chip chocolate chip. To do this, use both semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips in equal amounts to meet the chip requirements and use Penzey's natural and Dutch Process cocoas in equal amounts to meet the cocoa requirements. In my oven they come out at about 8.5 minutes and I put the sheet on the cooling rack to cool it down as quickly as possible. The cookies stay moist for up to 3 days, if they last that long."
"0","5","I followed a previous poster's instructions and did half white half brown sugar and half margarine half vegetable shortening. Turned out great! Update: I made these again following the previous notation (except butter instead of margarine). I also replaced the cocoa with flour this time. THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES I HAVE EVER HAD."
"0","4","amazing flavor! i also used half shortening and half butter, and half brown sugar and half white. used white choc chips and semi sweet chips, they even convinced my sugar free friend to try one!"
"0","5","These disappear as quickly as I can bake them. Spectacular! Thanks Kathy."
"0","5","Outstanding cookie recipe, a lunch box must!! My family loves this recipe!! It deserves 5 stars and more!!!!!!! Chocolate lovers friend :)"
"0","5","Edited 10/11 Just made these again, this time all butter and actually cut back on the cocoa a bit and added two healthy squirts of Hershey's Syrup and they were AMAZING. Still 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. Previous review: Amazing. I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I think mine were a little big, made 3 dozen, so I cooked them 9 minutes. My husband, who doesn't have as much of a sweet tooth as me loved them! That says a lot, will make again."
"0","5","These are seriously delicious! Million thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","super chocolately which is exactly what i wanted! perfect for the chocolate lover or someone who is in the mood for a brownie/cookie! also great frozen :)"
"0","5","I too did have white half brown sugar instead of all white sugar, also did half butter half shortening. They are so chewy and moist they are great!"
"0","5","Great! They taste better than the ones i bought in the bakery."
"0","5","These are awesome!! The only negative is that it doesn't make as many as I was hoping. I got 36 small(ish) cookies instead of the 48 I thought I was going to get."
"0","5","These cookies are divine. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing with their almost brownie-like texture. We tried them with white chocolate chips as well and found them just as divine. These cookies will not disappoint!"
"0","5","I halved the recipe with great success. Very easy and super delicious!"
"0","5","We made this vegan, with egg replacer instead of eggs. We also used splenda, not sugar. We made them a few times and each time they turned out very well! They were super delicious! The cookie dough was also really yummy cold/frozen. We'll definitely keep making them."
"0","3","This was just an O.K. cookie for me. It was tasty but not outstanding in any way. My kids told me not to save this recipe."
"0","5","Everyone who tried these cookies loved them. They were thick and chewy, not flat and/or crispy. I halved the recipe, and instead of using 1 cup of chocolate chips I used 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup white/vanilla chips and no nuts. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar to make the cookies more chewy. Another reviewer suggested using half butter and half shortening to avoid the cookie flattening out - I used only butter and my cookies turned out fine (I did not chill the dough prior to baking). They took exactly 10 minutes to bake perfectly. Also, I don't use vanilla extract for personal reasons - so I just used 1 tsp water. The next time I make these, which will be soon, I'm going to add coffee - another nice flavour might be orange juice as oranges go nicely with chocolate. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies where a hit in my house, but to give it a little lift and moistness I add one package of instant white chocolate pudding or you can use any flavor, it makes the cookies even more delicious"
"0","3","We did not care for these; too salty tasting (don't know why with only 1/4 tsp salt, and kind of dry."
"0","5","The only thing chocolate my boyfriend has requested. Usually he's a fruity kinda sweet tooth type, but these he requests chocolate for a change."
"0","4","Very good cookies. I added a little more cocoa and a tad more vanilla for my tastes. They came out perfect! A little crisp on the edges, nice and soft in the middle."
"0","5","I skip the walnuts and add half mint chocolate chips and the other half regular, semisweet. A nice, minty variation!"
"0","4","An 'adult' cookie when made with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and semi sweet chips. Satisfies even the worst chocolate cravings with just one or two of these little cookies!"
"0","5","So tasty! It was hard to stop my family from eating them...I made the recipe exactly as followed, and baked them on parchment paper for easy cleanup. On parchment at least they took at least 10 min."
"0","4","Good cookies :)"
"0","4","Good but not great. I prefer chewy cookies with a little more flavor. Not sure what this recipe needs, but if I need a chocolate cookie fix, this would probably do the trick."
"0","5","Made these cookies on Father's day and they were a hit. Followed recipe to the tee and came out with super moist cookies. Just enough chocolate but not overwhelming, will definitely make again. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","Rich, chocolatey flavor! I substituted as follows: 1 cup sugar + 1/2 cup Splenda; 1 egg, 1/4 cup Egg Beaters; 1-1/2 cups butter + 1/2 cup applesauce. Also threw in cranberries instead of nuts."
"0","5","These are awesome. Perfect when made small for a little bite of chocolate. Yum!"
"0","4","These are great fast cookies!! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I made the recipe exactly how it said & they are a tad bit too soft! Next time I will havle the butter like everyone suggested!"
"0","5","The best cookie in the world. Love it x 10!!! I did a half and half mix of chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and they were AMAZING!!! Everyone who has tried these just beg for more."
"0","4","These cookies were great!! Tried to use half shortening and even put the dough in the fridge so prevent having flat cookies but this still did not help. Cookies were still delicious!! They should rename this receipe to 'gone in 60 seconds'"
"0","5","These are great! I didn't have my normal recipe and I found this one. I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar. My old recipe requires the dough to be refrigerated so I put these in the fridge for awhile. They came out perfectly! Everyone has been raving about them. I also noticed that people have had their cookies dry out. I store mine in tupperware and they are still extremely fresh. You can also freeze them. My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't make as many as it says."
"0","5","The BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies I have ever enjoyed. I used Hersheys Special Dark Chips. K.R. Sciba Roanoke, Virginia"
"0","4","First time making cookies- not bad! I used a hand wire whip as I dont have an electic mixer yet, so cant say I mixed the butter and sugar mix to 'light and fluffy'... I put lots of space in between the spoonfuls on the cookie sheet, thinking they would spread out and flatten, but they never did, they stayed nearly exactly as I plopped them out. Keep a good eye on them and dont cook them entirely, undercook, so they cool down soft. Much like a brownie, very chocolately, great with milk..."
"0","5","These are EXCELLENT cookies!!! I cannot stay out of them! Kids and adults love them!"
"0","5","I have never had soo many people ask me for this recipe! Totally biggest cookie recipe request ever! I will be baking these cookies for the rest of my life! Y-U-M-M-Y!!!"
"0","4","Mine did NOT turn out flat and I still used unsalted butter! I changed the recipe to 1 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder."
"0","4","These are very good cookies. My daughter is allergic to milk and eggs and I was able to make these cookies with all of the necessary substitutions (fleischmann's unsalted margarine & shortening, ener-g egg replacer, and Ghirardelli chocolate chips) and they still tasted great! Baked on a silpat for 8 minutes."
"0","4","I made these for my sons beaver scout sleepover! Hmm there very sweet & chocolatey but I didnt get chewy & I didnt get 48 out of the mixture. But other then that there nice enough for the kids! Way to sweet for me thou!"
"0","4","These cookies are awesome. I have made them several times. I however trade the chocolate chips for the little andes mint chips."
"0","5","These cookies are VERY good. I will make these again (and again, and again)."
"0","5","There's no such thing as too much chocolate!"
"0","4","These are delicious. I make them with both milk chocolate chips and white chocolate chips. It's like a hybrid of a brownie and cookie. Yum!"
"0","5","Yum! I will definitely make these again! I want to try making them with peanut butter chips and also with white chocolate chips. I think those would be so good. Great recipe!"
"0","5","SOOOOO Good!"
"0","4","VERY CHOCOLATEY AND DELICIOUS. I'm not a big fan of chocolate and i love it. My choco-lover friends can't stop eating these cookies. Made these several times, tried substituting 1/3 of the sugar with brown sugar produces extra 'moistness?' to the cookies and really complements the chocolate. Also love to add white chocolate chips. YUM. Have been succesful cutting the recipe in half. I find that 8 minutes in my oven makes perfect cookies."
"0","5","Sooo Good!! Perfect balance of cocoa and sugar, and I will definately be making these again!"
"0","5","Better than brownies!"
"0","4","Very moist and good cookies!.."
"0","5","Yum! Tastes like a great chocolate chip cookie. Very moist and the perfect amount of chocolate and sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used mini chocolate chips and cut the recipe in half. I got about 30 cookies."
"0","5","Yummy. My kids loved these, me too."
"0","5","Taste like brownies! I cooked them for 8 minutes then pulled them out of the oven and let them rest on the aluminum foiled pan until the next batch came out. Amazing with half marg and half butter."
"0","5","I am writing more in hopes to get help. I can't get the cookies to be soft, chewy or at least have a shape of a chewy cookie. My cookies always flat out, the moment they get hot in the oven I Just watch them get as flat as a disc. I try to put more flour but didn't help much. Can anyone give me suggestions? What am I doing wrong? Help!"
"0","5","best i have ever tasted i did what some people said and half butter half shortning sprinkeled icing sugar turned out amazing"
"0","5","These are awesome! The only thing I did differently was substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar to make the cookies softer. They almost have the consistency of a brownie, so good!"
"0","5","Quite the tasty cookie! I didn't add the nuts as I didn't have any and they turned out delicious. Will add white chips next time for a nice contrast."
"0","4","These were very good. I halved the recipe and ended up with 14 cookies. Cookies were very rich, very chocolaty, very soft. I took some other advice listed here and cut the sugar with brown sugar. The only detraction was that the cookies came on really strong. Milk to cookie ratio was 1 glass to 1 cookie. I might reduce the cocoa powder, sugar, and butter in the next round."
"0","5","These turned out great. Make sure not to overcook, thats key to keeping soft."
"0","5","Scrumptious! Couldn't have asked for a better cookie. I baked them about 10 minutes."
"0","5","This is now my 14 year old daughter's 'signature' recipe! Best cookie i've every tasted. My daughter omits the nuts and uses vanilla chips instead of chocolate. YUMMY!"
"0","5","These were wonderful! Nice & soft."
"0","5","I made these for my boyfriend and he loved them! Thanks for the great recipe! I took some of the cookies and dusted them with powdered sugar, it was delicious!"
"0","4","Very good. Chewy and tasty. Used mint chocolate chips."
"0","2","Too chocolatey...way too much cocoa powder! I would do 1/3 c next time instead of 2/3"
"0","5","I really enjoyed these cookies. I actually put them in the fridge and 2 weeks later they were even better than the 1st day."
"0","5","Followed recipe as is minus the walnuts...absolutely DELICIOUS!"
"0","5","I just made these and love them. They came out a little soft - just the way I love my cookies. I also appreciated a chocolatey recipe that didn't use melted bakers chocolate which can add up."
"0","5","And I normally don't like these cookies and I very rarely write a review, these were just too good. I used white and dark chips otherwise followed to a T!"
"0","5","it was awesome!!! it wasn't too sweet, the perfect amount of chocolate-ness!"
"0","5","I made this recipe tonight, and it was AMAZING! The edges were chewy and the middle was soft and chocolatey. I did not use walnuts and I substituted half of the semi-sweet chips for white chocolate chips, which was a perfect complement to the semi-sweet chocolate. A definite keeper!!"
"0","5","Amazing! Everyone loved these - even my friends who 'hate chocolate' loved them. I used 1/2 C brown sugar and 1 C white sugar. I also substituted half whole wheat & half regular flour, and I used half butter, half margarine. They even stayed soft for days!"
"0","5","Tried with nuts and without nuts. Good recipe either way."
"0","5","These are the best cookies I have ever made! I did follow the others suggestion of using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 c of white. Baked for 10 minutes. PERFECTION!"
"0","4","I wasn't too fond of the texture....I used Margarine maybe if that's why but everything else was the same....although I omitted the walnuts didn't think that would make a difference....it was too bland so i added a cup of white chocolate chips.....a bit too soft..."
"0","5","These cookies are wonderful! I made the 1 cup white sugar/1/2 cup light brown sugar subsitution that was recommended and baked until just set as the recipe called for. They're still soft on the second day."
"0","5","Awesome. Seemed a bit too soft still after 10 minutes so I left the first batch in 13. Those turned out good, but crunchy. I followed the directions for the rest and they turned out soft and chewy. Great recipe! I already printed it out and put it in my recipe box."
"0","5","I followed this recipe verbatim, and I think that the cookies were probably the best I have ever tasted! PERFECT! The chocolate chips that I used were white chocolate chip, though. So I guess I did change something :/! Oh well, they were still AMAZING!"
"0","5","I am a chocolate fanatic and these cookies totally satisfied my sweet tooth. Very delicious!"
"0","5","These cookies are the best. I didn't put nuts in and used mini chocolate chips. I also used dark chocolate cocoa.....delicious."
"0","5","These are spectacular. My sister made these cookies for me and wow they were delicious, so I went ahead and got the recipe and made some myself. I baked them for 8 minutes and they were nice and chewy. They didn't get hard. I've read a lot of reviews of people saying their hard, maybe they should cover the cookies after their baked so they don't get hard. I did the recipe exactly as it says. Thanks!"
"0","2","I decided to try this recipe because of the high rating, and because I am a chocoholic. The recipe was followed exactly, except for the addition of chopped dried berries. (Love them with chocolate!) I am somewhat disappointed, as ours seem 'dry' in the mouth, though the cookie is not overbaked or stale. It also has an aftertaste that we can't quite place, but it is slightly bitter and unleasant. The real statement came last night. I wanted a snack, and knew these were in the kitchen, but opted for a piece of candy instead. Never happens with me and cookies! I don't think we'll make these again..."
"0","4","these are VERY rich, but very good! they tend to work better when made smaller, and i actually used a bit less butter than the recipe calls for, but the cookie didn't suffer from it due to the added chocolate chips."
"0","5","Mexican Chocolate Cookies: I wanted to bring dessert for a Cinco de Mayo dinner at our church, so I took this basic recipe and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I didn't have chocolate chips in the house, but I had 4 squares of semi sweet chocolate, which I chopped up and mixed in. I left out the walnuts (I don't think they eat too many walnuts in Mexico). Anyway, the cookies came out very good...with just a hint of cinnamon, which is how I like Mexican hot chocolate. This is an interesting variation on a great recipe."
"0","5","Perfect for my chocoholic husband; he could not stop oooh-ing and ahhh-ing! I followed the recipe exactly and they were anything but dry, even days later. Delicious, delicious, delicious. I have already passed this on to friends and will certainly be making these regularly."
"0","5","Awesome! For all you vegans out there, I used vegan margarine (Smart Balance) and Ener-G Egg Replacer with Ghiradelli choc chips and these were to die for. They even spread out and looked like a 'regular' cookie!:) My hubby had no idea these were vegan!"
"0","5","My daughter and I renamed them brownie cookies because they are that goooooood!!! I used shortening instead of butter and I went 3/4white sugar and 3/4 brown. I found it most helpful to use the beaters when blending the dry into the wet a little at a time. It went in my recipe box :)"
"0","5","i love this recipe, its so easy to make and they still taste great without the chocolate chips, i've used this recipe about three times already and the family still cant get enough of them!!"
"0","5","I have made these cookies at least 3 times now and they are wonderful! I follow the recipe exactly, then bake them for about 7 minutes. A friend of my husband's was over the first time I made these and he still talks about these cookies months later! This recipe is now in my own favorite recipe book."
"0","5","Excellent. I did not change a single thing and they turned out perfect. We also made a batch to use for ice cream sandwiches. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
"0","5","ten stars!! these cookies are so AMAZING! i followed someone's suggestion and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown. i also used one cup white chocolate chips. it came to about 60-65 cookies and they sure went fast! i kept them in a airtight jar witha slice of apple and they stayed so chewy and soft!! love love this recipe and cant wait to make it again! thanks!! FOR ROSE: are your baking trays warm or hot when you put the cookies on? once i made cookies and as soon as the tray came out of the oven i removed the cookies and put the next batch on and they all went very flat..so maybe that could be it? also it might help to chill your cookie dough in the fridge?"
"0","5","LOVED IT!!!!"
"0","5","Fantabulous! If you have a need for chocolate... this is it! VERY GOOD!"
"0","5","unbelievably delicious, these were the best cookies I've EVER had, I'm not even exaggerating I would wake up in the middle of the night with a craving for these, chocolate dough with choc chips with nuts...i added walnuts AND slivered almonds...the most heavenly combination!"
"0","5","AMAZING! These cookied have a nice cruncy outside and a chewy inside. They are delicious!"
"0","5","These turned out great. I am thinking next time I might try peanut butter chips."
"0","5","Everyone loved them. I will use this recipe from now on."
"0","4","these were really easy to make, but my dough seemed kind of dry when all mixed up. The cookies themselves are not bad, but not the best either. I think I may add less flour next time...??"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!! I used only white chocolate chips and they were great! My daughter who will NOT eat regular chocolate chip cookies loved them! Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","I'm not a chocolate person. Made these during my visit to my boyfriend's, not quite sure what I did different, but the ones I baked kinda spreaded out, not quite anything like the picture showed, but they still turned out great! Boyfriend and his parents love it, it's all gone in less than a day! Thanks alot for sharing this recipe! =)"
"0","5","I've made these several times. I like to make them for my daughter when she travels. I pretty much follow the recipe exact and they are wonderful!"
"0","5","These were absolutely excellent and they were a lot of fun to make. My 3-year old helped me make them and she had a ton of fun. They tasted incredible."
"0","5","There aren't enough stars in the universe to rate this one! WOW!! I was out of butter so I used margarine, fearful that would have a negative affect. (It didn't.) Absolutely wonderful in all areas! (taste, texture, ease, convenient ingredients, etc...) Shame on me if I don't share these. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","Followed directions to a 'T' and it came out fantastic!! Moist..like a brownie. The husband did a cookie dance...he LOVED it!"
"0","5","These are great cookies, and they always turn out delicious. I use 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, but other than that, I stick to the recipe... Very good!!!"
"0","5","These are the best possible cookies ever!"
"0","5","Great recipe, no changes perfect as is!"
"0","4","i used half shortening and half butter. came out great."
"0","4","These cookies are so delicious. It's like a brownie but in a shape of a cookie. They were practically all gone as soon as they came out of the oven. Yum!"
"0","2","Not particularly thrilled with these. Way too cakey. More like a chocolate scone. But chocolate is chocolate so they weren't bad, just more like mini cakes."
"0","5","I've tried numerous double fudge recipes on the net, but this one is the best!! Moist chewy cookies. I doubled the batch without a hitch, took them to work and they disappeared! Everyone loved them!"
"0","5","Warning: get a tall glass of milk ready before attempting to eat these."
"0","5","I make these every week, they cannot be beat. I use 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white sugar. Otherwise no changes. ± They are perfect!"
"0","5","They are awesome just the way the recipe says."
"0","5","Chocolate Heaven! These were extremely simple to make and turned out fabulous. I did what some of the others suggested in that I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and they were amazing. My only suggestion would be to be sure you have a nice big class of cold milk to go along with them!"
"0","5","These cookies are unbelievably good! I didn't add walnuts, because I was too lazy, but I bet they'd be amazing with them. I also want to try it with peanut butter chips. They took a few extra minutes to bake than the recommended 8-10 minutes, and they came out perfect. I like my cookies soft and chewy, and even with the extra couple of minutes they were still perfect with no crisping."
"0","5","My family and friends love these cookies. They are especially good when they're warm when the chocolate chips are still gooey. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderful. Just make sure that when you're mixing in the chocolate chips that you don't clump them in one area, else some cookies would be exploding with chocolate while others lack the chocolatey goodness."
"0","5","This turned out to be a very good cookie. They were sweet and- if you like them like I like them- good and goey. They hardened after they cooled, so don't go over what the time limit was. Even my gooey faliures turned out to be a chewy sucess!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe. After reading the reviews I used half butter and half shortening. In an attempt to make this a little more healthy, I used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached all purpose. I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and added 3 tbs of milled flax. As opposed to chocolate chips I used the peanut butter and chocolate swirled chips. Rave reviews from my health nut hubby and our 4 and 6 yr old niece and nephew."
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! If I can make them, anyone can. I have always been a better cook than a baker. I have found that if you change the servings to 24, they turn out much better. If I do the full amount, I have to add a little more flour or they are more like brownie mix than cookie dough and are too runny to get off the pan. Thank you for the recipe, it is now a family favorite."
"0","5","i read the reviews and added 1/2 C. shortening and 1/2 C. butter as well as 3/4 C. brown sugar and 3/4 C. white. it tasted amazing! especially for valentines day :)"
"0","5","EXCELLENT"
"0","5","A great chocolate chocolate chip cookie. Great taste and form. A perfect cookie!"
"0","5","Terrific recipe. First time i tried to make cookies and had them work out! I halved the recipe and used hot cholocate mix instead of cocao (most likely just made it more sugary). Excellent!"
"0","5","I loved these cookies! I didn't use the Walnuts, I'm not a big nut fan. And I was about 1/4cup short on the cocoa but they still turned out awesome!"
"0","5","Excellent cookies! I cut the butter to 1-1/2 sticks and it turned out great! I also added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips to make them triple chocolate chip cookies. Best cookies ever!"
"0","4","I followed the recipe exactly - although I added a few more chocolate chips than absolutely necessary - and these cookies turned out delicious! They were very, very chocolatey and chewy. Definitely a good chocolate cookie recipe."
"0","5","I made a half batch and still got over 2 dozen cookies. I also lowered the amount of sugar and chocolate chips and found them still sufficiently sweet. This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","These cookies are AWESOME!!! I did sub. 1/2C. of brown sugar instead of all white. I also used all butter. I put the batter in the fridge for about 2 hours before I baked them.  I made these for my son's 1st grade class so I used M&M's instead of chips. Wow, they are so good, they have the brownie texture! Wonderful!"
"0","4","great tasting ,flavorable, cookies,perfect for a quick snack.very little work,"
"0","5","Without making any changes, these cookies are HEAVENLY. Seriously."
"0","4","Got lots of good reviews on this one. Used a double dutch dark chocolate cocoa powder for it which made the batter very rich and dark. It was a little sweet for my taste, but that must just be me because everyone else seemed to think they were awesome. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","These are the best cookies! I added 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1/4 and I also used 2 cups milk chocolate chips, 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips. Absolutely AMAZING!!! I also had some left over buttercream frosting from my daughter's birthday cake and made a few cookie sandwiches...very good! I used the recipe for Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting on allrecipes."
"0","5","This recipe is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all of my family loves it."
"0","5","Very rich and soft!"
"0","5","DELISH!! DELISH!! DELISH!! only advise is double the recipe right off the bat!! They disappear very fast!!"
"0","5","These cookies are dangerous! If you need a chocolate fix make these, but be prepared to indulge. I left out the nuts, otherwise I followed the recipe. Blissful chocolate heaven!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT"
"0","5","Sooooo soft inside. Not too rich and simple to make!!"
"0","4","I substitued the butter with one cup of mashed banana and the sugar with half splenda, half powdered suger. The cookies came out great! And it was nice having a lower fat version of such a tasty delight."
"0","5","These are positively sinful. Awesome recipe, didn't have to change a thing. Tried without nuts and added more choco chips and was just as good."
"0","5","This recipe was amazing. I made it exactly as written, except I used Andies Chips instead of chocolate chips, so they were chocolate-mint chip cookies. I made them over the holidays, and people are still asking for them! GREAT."
"0","5","Be ready for chocolate overload when you eat these puppies. Perfect as written, I wouldn't change a thing."
"0","5","Perfect for those days when you just NEED chocolate, because this cookie has plenty of it, and it's quick and easy. I love that it has cocoa in it instead of melted chocolate, because I always have cocoa powder and never have chocolate! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and changed half the sugar to brown sugar, and it turned out great."
"0","5","Great tasting cookie! I may have overcooked them a bit (thinking that they were undercooked at 11 minutes..wasn't thinking that they'd harden up) but they are still perfect! Lots of chocolate flavor!!"
"0","5","Sooooo good. I read some of the reviews and substituted 1/2 cup of butter for butter flavored shortening and also 1/2 of the sugar for Splenda, and they turned out great!"
"0","5","This was as good as everyone says it was, did not make any changes at it was as good if not better than the bakery...Thanks!"
"0","5","LOVE THIS RECIPE!! The cookies lasted a day in my house. I substituted the butter for shortening and used leftover toblerone chocolate bar (shredded 1 3/4 cup) for the chocolate chips. The result was incrediable, Highly recommend this recipe."
"0","4","These were very yummy and easy to make. My husband loved them, too!"
"0","5","These cookies were super yummy and very easy to make. I substituted peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips and left out the nuts. So good!"
"0","5","Wonderful! My family devoured them in less than a day."
"0","5","Good stuff! :) Perfect for a chocolate craving. I substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar with light brown, and they turned out beautifully. :)"
"0","5","Any chocolate lover would love this."
"0","5","I made these a couple weeks ago and just realized I hadn't left a review. WOWEEEEE these were SO GOOD>>>BEST COOKIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Really great super chocolatey cookies! They're very different than a typical cookie, almost cake-like. To cut down the fat and calories, I used half splenda, half sugar, and half butter/ half applesauce, but be sure to beat in the applesauce later, just before you add in the dry ingredients. Applesauce will only create a weird texture if beaten too much. I made one batch with white chips, and the other with dark chips and mini M&Ms. Delicious!"
"0","5","This is my favorite cookie recipe! I love to make them with the mini York Peppermint patties instead of chocolate chips. They're hard to find, but if I look hard at Christmas time I can find a few bags and stock up for these cookies. Otherwise, Andes mint pieces would be great too!"
"0","5","*WOW!!!* These are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white to make them extra chewy. I also underbaked them to make sure they were really gooey. I had to flatten them down with a fork a bit when they were about halfway done, but they turned out fantastic! This recipe is really decadent and delicious. Highly recommended."
"0","5","FFFFFFFFFFantastic recipe!!!!! I can't stop eating it! IT tastes just heavenly when slightly heated in microwave. Double chocolate! Is there anything better?"
"0","5","INCREDIBLY chocolate-y but not overtly sweet...will definitely be making again and again and again!"
"0","5","I'm not even a fan of chocolate chocolate chip cookies, and I loved these. I made a batch of these and another of regular chocolate chip cookies, and these were so much better that although I started out with the same number of both kinds of cookies, my friends plowed through these much quicker. I am going to make myself another batch, and may or may not share!   I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and had no problems at all. The dough seemed oddly sticky when I was getting ready to bake (after having chilled for a day), but they came out fine and rose beautifully."
"0","5","Very delicious recipe!!! Highly recommended. The cookies are very soft, moist, and chewy. They go great with a tall glass of milk or even coffee. They certainly satisfy any craving for chocolate!!! Great Cookies!"
"0","5","These cookies are crazy good- I make them 2-3 times a week. They're great plain, but they're even better with chocolate pieces and pecans mixed in. I took a sweet chocolate bar and crumbled it in, and reduced the sugar by a fourth of a cup to offset the chocolate's sweetness. They're perfect. I usually put about 1/4-1/2 tsp more of vanilla, or add in almond extract. The almond extract gives them a subtly different flavor which I l-o-v-e. Happy Baking!"
"0","5","Wow!! These are awesome! I used .5 cup brown sugar for part of the white. I also used .5 cup shortning and .5 cup butter instead of all butter. I also used 1 cup choco chips ans 1 cup toffee pieces. These were a great rich chocolate flavor and didn't last long. They really do taste just like a store bought cookie."
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and my cookies turned out great. This is definitely a recipe to keep!"
"0","5","Outstanding recipe! Made it per directions and used andes mint chips, semi sweet chocolate chips, and chopped walnuts. Definite keepers!"
"0","5","I thought this recipe was great. The only thing i changed was i added a cup of hersheys milk chocolate chips and a cup of andies mint candies cooking chips. They were soooo yummy..."
"0","5","Double stacked them in the oven and burnt those on the bottom rack. Turned down the heat a little and extended the time. Cookies were delicious."
"0","5","These cookies were incredible! I've only made cookies from scratch once before and these turned out sooo good. I used dark chocolate chips and peanut butter chips instead of just semi-sweet chips and had to substitute baking powder (looked it up on about.com for conversion). They were so moist for days afterward! Even leaving the bag open (oops). They did need to baked longer than the 10 minutes suggested though."
"0","5","Really good! Better when first out of the oven!"
"0","4","I followed the other suggestions to do half brown and half white sugar and the cookies were kind of flat, but chewy in the center. Definitely better after a few hours rather than right out of the oven."
"0","5","Fantasic! Not having nuts on hand I swapped them for white chocolate chips and they were great! Still beautifully soft and chewy days later. I'm making these again for New Years!"
"0","5","I've experimented quite a bit with this recipe changing up the chips, sugar, butter/margarine/shortening, and choice of cocoa. I have to say it is incredibly flexible! My personal favorite is all butter, white sugar Ghiradelli Unsweetened Cocoa and bittersweet chips with a tall glass of milk! I know they stay perfectly chewy for 2.5 days, but never had any last longer than that!"
"0","5","Really great, basic chocolate cookie recipe! It has a pretty fine crumb and a very rich, chocolate flavor. I used milk chocolate candy bars chopped into chunks, so it ended up sweeter than it would have been with semi-sweet chocolate chips, but it was still great. They don't spread much at all, so you can pretty much crowd the baking pan, leave them about an inch and a half apart, and you can use a tbsp rather than tsp for those big, chewy 'Starbucks' cookies that everyone loves. Yum! I'll be making this recipe for my chocolate-loving mom soon, but I'll add some toasted hazelnuts to the batter (Nutella impersonation =D)."
"0","5","Since you can make this recipe with ingredients most cooks typically have on hand, it's a quick and easy remedy for a chocolate fix. I also liked the 'cakey' rather than crunchy texture."
"0","5","These are great cookies. Like other's, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I found caramel chips, intended for melting for caramel apples, but used them in place of chocolate chips and they were yummy! I think they'd be great with any type chips, or none at all. The next day they are still chewy and good in my cookie jar. I did have to let them sit on the cookie sheets to cool quite a while, but that could be the caramel. This cookie is a keeper!"
"0","5","a must try"
"0","5","Followed the recipe as it is. This was full of chocolate and very very good! Will keep and make again! I did add 1 C semi sweet and 1 C white chocolate chips because I ran out of the semi sweet, but of course it was still amazing! Chocolate lovers will love this cookie! Very soft and great warm."
"0","5","This is one of the best cookies I have made. They were soft and chewy even the next day and delicious. My family loved them. This one is definitely on my regular Christmas cookie list."
"0","5","this recipe was so good! How can you go wrong with chocolate x2. I used milk chocolate chips because I like them better and it was very good. 'Santa' enjoyed a lot too!"
"0","5","These were fantastic! I, too, substituted half shortening/half butter, and used part brown sugar. I also added a splash of super strong coffee instead of vanilla. I made these for about 30 coworkers for Christmas, so I chopped up some peppermint bark and threw that in instead of chocolate chips. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also used 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup white chocolate chips. The multicolored chips made the cookies look even prettier. Instead of making 48 small cookies, I made 18 large cookies, which I baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. They turned out perfect: chewy in the middle and crisp on the edges. These cookies don't spread much if your butter is fairly cold. Make sure you beat the butter and sugar together long enough so that the mixture becomes light and fluffy; this step ensures that the texture of the cookie will be perfect. Overall, this recipe is wonderfully easy and produces delicious cookies. I'll definitely be using it again and again."
"0","3","After 25 mins they have turned out ok, a bit burnt on top and very soft in the middle more like a cake consistency, but they are still yummy and I put down the problem to my oven and changing the serving amount on the recipe"
"0","5","These cookies were yummy. I put in white chocolate chips. Thankyou"
"0","5","I just finished making these cookies and they are delicious!!!! I used White chips and I made them a little large. They turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe"
"0","5","These are the best chocolate cookies I've ever made, and I bake a lot! Texture is perfect, 8 minute baking time is perfect in my oven. I did remove them immediately from the pans, otherwise they stuck a bit. But delicious and a bit hit with my husband who said 'ummmmmmm' when I asked! Make 'em!"
"0","5","These were awesome!! I couldn't find the time to bake them, so they ended up refrigerated for 2 days, but they still baked up wonderfully. Everyone loves them!! Also, I did do 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening as suggested and took them out at exactly 8 minutes. These are perfect cookies."
"0","5","I have a family of chocoholics and was tired of paying so much for some of the great store cookies ($4 per dozen). Made this batch of cookies using 1/2 Cup of brown sugar and the remaining in white sugar. WHAT A HIT!!!!!! I intentionally left them out overnight to see if they would remain moist, chewy and so delectable. At 5AM today, I had 2 with coffee - how wonderful. Other than the change in sugars, I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 8 minutes. Came out just perfect. This recipe will be a 'keeper' in my collection. Thanks."
"0","5","Delicious. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, and omitted the nuts. They did not spread out much and came out thick and plump. They are so soft and chewy. Yum! I have a feeling these are gonna disappear quickly."
"0","3","These were ok. Not as soft and chewy as I like. I also didn't have baking soda so I used powder and used white chocolate chips. I'll have to keep messing with it."
"0","3","Wasn't overly impressed after such high ratings. But, found out that if you eliminate nuts and double the chocolate chips they come out MUCH better!"
"0","4","These cookies have an excellent flavor; however, they did not turn out chewy and soft but more like a sugar cookie in texture - very thin and crisp due to spreading while baking. I added white chocolate chips and peanut butter chips, and they tasted great, too! My only complaint is the texture and spreading - other than that, perfect!"
"0","5","These were the best cookies. I did use half butter and half shortning, I also used half chocolate chips and half Heath bar pieces. YUMMMY!!!!! Thank you for a great recipe"
"0","5","Really good cookies. I used half white chocolate chips and half semi sweet would have been better if I used all semi sweet chips."
"0","4","Very good. Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have to change a thing."
"0","4","Whoa! Super Chocolaty! (Never a bad thing!) Incredibly addicting. Almost brownie-like texture. The only thing I did differently was half brown sugar / half white sugar. Will make a wonderful addition to the Xmas cookie platter!"
"0","5","Oh my!! This is one of the best cookies I've ever eaten!! Just followed recipe with no alterations. It doesn't need to be altered!"
"0","5","I made these as written but with peanut butter chips. Yum!!!"
"0","5","Excellent cookie! Followed suggestions and used half butter, half shortening. Also, half sugar and half brown sugar. I also subbed in cake flour for the all purpose and they were very light and well shaped. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Very easy and GREAT tasting. I put in about 1 1/2 C choc chips and about 1/2 to 3/4 of a C of peanut butter chips. mmmm"
"0","5","Every time I make these cookies (which is more than I should), I am amazed. They get eaten too fast. One of the recipes where the actual cookie tastes better than the dough. We sometimes keep a frozen roll, and when the need arises, cut off a few pieces and bake them in our toaster oven! So fresh and delicious! Thank you!"
"0","5","Yum just what I was looking for! Ran out of cocoa powder and subbed in some chocolate milk powder and still came out great. Need a huge glass of milk for these they are sweet!!"
"0","5","We all l-o-v-e these. They are the best with white chocolate chips!"
"0","4","Easy to make as described in the recipe. Cookies are like brownies, so they are super rich and chewy. Delicious!"
"0","5","WOW! Super good cookies. Instead of chocolate chips we used Andes chocolate mint chips. Made them taste like a mint brownie."
"0","5","Now I know what to make to cure a chocolate craving! These are FANTASTIC! The whole family gobbled 'em up in no time! They are extra yummy with good quality cocoa powder and white chocolate chips. I would give them more than 5 stars if I could."
"0","5","Wonderful!"
"0","5","Awesome! I love cooking but baking is a challenge for me...I bought fresh soda for this and it rocks. BF insisted on butterscotch chips (ugh...way too sweet), but I'm still eatin em! Gonna try with dried banana chips and white chocolate chips...thank you much for a cookie that I can actually serve without apologizing for something!"
"0","4","yummy, cakey chocolate cookies. Just what I was looking for. =) only change I made was to decrease the sugar to 2/3 cup and halved the chocolate chips b/c it seemed like an awful lot."
"0","4","These tasted great. We loved them and they were soft enough but not too soft."
"0","5","Very good, the one's I added pecans to I didn't like as much."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing!! I used spread instead of butter because I didn't have any. Also, I used white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate swirled chips instead. The result? A deliciously rich chocolate cookie."
"0","5","These were AWESOME. The only thing I changed was to use 1 c of white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar. I also used white chocolate chips instead of chocolate.  Made them this morning and they're almost gone already! They're sweet and buttery, so so so good. I'll definitely make them again."
"0","5","This recipe turned out perfect. I was looking for a quick super chocolately cookie for my boyfriend, and they were just like making chocolate chip cookies. They even looked extra amazing. I cooked them exactly as described. They stayed soft (even sitting out on the table) for days."
"0","5","Amazing!!!"
"0","4","Very good flavor, but the cookies were very soft and sticky. I cooked the second batch 12 minutes instead of 8-10 and that helped."
"0","4","Very chocolaty! Very good. nice and soft & chewy. But I had a problem with the batter being so thick I couldn't mix in the chips. Had to add a little bit of oil & water. Also, they were very good, but something seemed to be missing."
"0","5","Oh my goodness these cookies are incredible!!! Everyone in our house loved them. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown suger too. These will be made often."
"0","5","This is one of those awesome cookie recipes. They were great even without the nuts but will add them next time. It was like eating the most mouth watering piece of yummy chocolate sensation in just one cookie...of course who could eat just one! Thanks so much."
"0","5","Could not have asked for a better cookie. I prefer these to regular chocolate chip cookies, the more chocolate the better.Mmmmmmmmmmm"
"0","5","I took the suggestions to use half butter/half margarine and half white sugar/half brown sugar. I also used half semi sweet/half white chocolate chips and one cup of walnuts. THESE ARE FABULOUS WITH MILK!!!! I actually cooked them for 9-10 minutes, and they were perfect, not hard and have stayed perfect for several days (in container)."
"0","5","These were GREAT! I did as others and used half brown sugar and added some white chips in some of the batch. Hubby really liked them."
"0","5","OMG! I love them! I was looking for a festive looking cookie so I baked mine with reese pieces on the top instead of the choco chips. The batter smelled so good while I was baking it that I couldn't resist nibbling it. The oven I am using is a little off kilter so the ones that I didn't bake on a baking stone turned out a little too done on the bottom. That said, this is the first thing that I have baked in this oven that came out so well!"
"0","5","I omitted the nuts, but the cookies were awesome! I served them warm with vanilla and chocolate ice cream. The cookies are chocolaty but not too sweet. The whole family enjoyed!"
"0","5","These cookies are fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone who's tried them loves them! As a chocoholic, they're my new favorite recipe. Very easy to make, try them right now!"
"0","5","Yummy! These were just as I imagined full of chocolate with creamy chocolate chips. I will make these again."
"0","4","Delicious! I'm not so big on chocolate but these are irrestistable. I stayed true to recipe, and they came out perfect first try. I just hope they stay soft and chewy."
"0","5","very good Used half white chocolate chips"
"0","5","Yum! I used white chocolate chips, and they turned out great! The only change I will make next time, if I again use white chocolate, is to decrease the sugar by maybe a 1/4 cup."
"0","5","as it says under 5 stars, these were 'the Best' cookies i've ever made. i thought, as a beginning cook, that they might not turn out quite as good on the first try, but they were totally amazing. i also substituted half of the butter for crisco and that worked great. take them out after 8 minutes! they'll still be soft, but then when they start to cool they won't get hard even the next day. i highly recommend these to any level cooking enthusiast"
"0","5","Excellent! Just what I was looking for in a cookie. Wonderful flavor, moist and chewy.   I actually didn't strictly follow the recipe. I didn't have the coco powder so I omitted it, but I did use everything else exactly as the recipe stated.   In case others want to know, I used this recipe to make cookie bars, instead of individual cookies and it came out great!  I just put all the batter into a 9x13 pan and cooked for 3o minutes. It did come out a tiny bit undercooked, but I actually like it that way so I'm not complaining. :)"
"0","5","WOW! I am not done baking these and have already eaten THREE! They are divine. I was looking for a chocolate cookie to add Andes mint chips to and this was perfect. I almost subbed peppermint extract for the vanilla but changed my mind last minute and am glad I did-they are nice and chocolatey with plenty of mint from the chips. I followed other reviewer suggestions and baked for exactly 8 minutes and removed them from the pan immediately. No problems with sticking or anything. Can't vouch for how long they keep but I can assure you it will be a non-issue. They will be gone within 24 hours."
"0","5","I'd add more nuts. Good and easy to make. Thx!"
"0","5","These are very, very good right out of the oven. They seem to get stale fast. I'd suggest freezing the dough and baking just a few at a time."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","amazing!"
"0","5","These cookies are dangerous. I can't stop eating them. They are SO good, so much better than I've ever had from any bakery. I subbed 1/2 C. brown sugar for white sugar, and used 1/2 C. Criso to replace 1/2 C. butter. 10 minutes and truly amazing, the best cookie I've ever had."
"0","5","Oh my...these are absolutely the best!!! Very delicious!!! I did not have semi-sweet chips on hand so I used milk chocolate chips...very rich but very good! I will definately make these again!"
"0","4","This is a great chocolate cookie recipe. I used shortening in place of butter & I used 1 Cup Semi-Sweet chocolate chips and 1 Cup Reeses Pieces candy. The peanut butter and chocolate are great! Peanut butter chips would work too but I used what I had at home. I will keep this recipe to make again. It was quick and easy to whip up a batch. I also got 60 good size cookies out of this."
"0","5","these cookies need a little more flattning.beacause you only need to bake the for 8 to 10 minets.so here what you do,get all the dough and put it on the cookie platei thingi then before you put it in the oven,get a flat edged cup. then SMOOSH IT ALL UP but not too much. and then bake 14 minets."
"0","5","Great cookies! I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate & nuts. YUMMY!"
"0","5","AMmmmmazing! They didndt even last an hour out of the oven in my house"
"0","5","These cookies are AMAZING!!! As a lot of people seem to have, I also used white choc chips. I have made them three times this week for various people and every time they have been eaten within minutes! I have been asked for the recipe so many times already! Will definitely be making them again!"
"0","4","Very nice and easy to make cookie, and very very soft. Although not the best looking cookie, it certainly is tasty! UPDATE: I have come to realise that soft cookies come from cookies with higher butter contents and by 'undercooking' the cookie. You must also remove the cookie from the heat source immediately. I bake my cookies for 8 minutes exactly and they are like store bought soft batches!"
"0","5","These cookies were awesome! Very soft and moist. I used 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips and left out the nuts. Delicious and easy."
"0","5","These cookies were by far, some of the BEST cookies I have ever made. I have my stand-by best ever chocolate chunk cookies but really wanted something different for a farwell party. These didn't make the party..the were gone way before the party started. I used about 1/3 c. white chocolate chips, about 1c. of milk chocolate chips and some dark chocolate bar that I chopped up. So this was the chocolatiest cookie ever. My hubby said the were dangerous because they were so addictive!! That is HUGE coming from my hubby. Thanks for this...it is a keeper!!"
"0","5","Really good recipe! Instead of regular chocolate chips, I added all the remnants of fancy swirled chips and peanut butter chips that were in the freezer. Also, being that I live in New Mexico, I had to add 3/4 tsp of Chimayo Chipotle Red Chile to the batter...for a subtle hint of spice!"
"0","5","Holy these are delicious!!! best cookies I think I have ever made I got excited when I was just mixing up the 'dough' it look wonderful only change I made was I used milk chocolate chips as well as just plain chocolate chips!   YUM YUM I will make this forever now  Can't wait to see what hubby thinks!"
"0","5","Brilliant! I have finally found the perfect cookie recipe for my chocoholic boyfriend. These are like little brownie/cookies from heaven. I followed the recipe exactly, and everything turned out swell. I'm thinking next time I might throw in some dried cherries and walnuts- although I'm sure chocholics will love this recipe just as it is."
"0","5","These are perfectly chewy and chocolatey! 8 minutes is just right for average sized cookies."
"0","3","I expected more from these. I followed directions exactly but they weren't as chewy as I would have liked."
"0","5","Made these for my boyfriend. He loved them, very chocolaty."
"0","4","My husband tasted these and said 'These are the best cookies I've ever had!' Not bad for a REALLY picky eater! Personally, I would have liked a sweeter taste to them, and will probably use milk chocolate chips next time. The biggest thing is that he liked them!!"
"0","5","Swell recipe. No changes. They turned out great."
"0","5","These were really good cookies! I added about 1/2 cup of dried apricots as well, really yum!!"
"0","5","Fabulous! I did not use any nuts and threw in a combination of milk chocolate and semi sweet chips (about 3 cups total). Very good!"
"0","5","So good and so chocolaty!"
"0","5","I made these for my Spanish class for a project, and everybody wanted more! This is probably my favorite cookie recipe.  Also: somebody made similar cookies to these but she added both milk chocolate and white chocolate, and they were so good! I'm going to add white chocolate next time!"
"0","5","These are pretty good. I made half of them soft and the other half crispy/crunchy to dunk in milk!"
"0","5","These are truly outstanding! Since we like chewy cookies around here, I will be sure to only bake them for 8 minutes next time. We left the first batch in an extra two minutes because they didn't look done. Big mistake! The first dozen was too dry. Eight minutes should be perfect."
"0","5","These are absolutely delicious!! The only thing I changed was lowering the amount of white sugar to one cup, and adding a half cup of brown sugar. The cookies came out perfectly after eight minutes. Very chocolate, moist, sweet, and brownie-like. My kids and I love them."
"0","4","followed to the tee, used earth balnance. DEFINETLY USE TSP to make the cookies. i did half with tblspn becaseu i like big cookies, and they crumbled a bit on removal.   this cookie tastes just like a brownie, delicous!"
"0","5","Sooo yummy! Rich, lucious flavor - definitely for the chocoholic! I experimented with half choc chips and half white choc chips, and they turned out really well, it helped to cut what could have maybe been too much chocolate -- although, can you ever really have too much?"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe. I went a little overboard when spooning them out so they all merged together into one giant cookie in the end, hehe, but still a brilliant soft cookie taste that I'll be sure to make again."
"0","5","These were wonderful! a total hit with my boyfriend. They were very quick and simple to make. Its a great recipe to calm cravings, the cookies were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. An over all success!"
"0","5","These are very good. They are moist with a bit of crunch. I did have to press them down a little. They didn't flatten at all when baking."
"0","4","chewy and soft and delicious"
"0","5","You can't go wrong with this much chocolate flavor! I omitted the nuts and used a good cocoa powder and Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Chips - heavenly! I made mine a little on the large size and ten minutes baking time was perfect."
"0","5","these make the best ice cream sandwiches and are perfect for white chocolate chips"
"0","5","My personal opinion on these cookies was that they were disgustigly rich and overpoweringly sweet. But I brought them to a 4th of July event and they were a hit (especially with little kids), so I'll give this recipe 5 stars. Something I would definitely make for company, but not for my family...we don't have a taste for incredibly rich and sugary things. Thanks though."
"0","5","This recipe was both delicious and had great texture and shape.   Thank you"
"0","5","these did not last long in my house at all. they were moist and soft and so chocolately. i didnt add the nuts and i added half a cup more of chocolate chips and a little bit extra vanilla essence but these were divine :o)"
"0","5","great cookie, only problem I had, they were gone before I knew it."
"0","5","These brookies or crownies, as we call them at work, are the best cookie we have ever had. We can't decide if they are cookies or brownies, but either way...i bake these for everyone's birthday and have become the greatly anticipated birthday treat."
"0","4","Pretty good although they could be chewier. I used white chocolate chips instead of regular and they were still really good!"
"0","5","Fabulous cookies! Perfect for the chocolate lovers in our family. So rich you got to have milk!"
"0","5","These are the best cookies I have EVER had. I used Ghirredela chochlate chips and they were amazing. Make sure you have milk in the house because you're sure going to want some! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","My husband gave these two thumbs up!!! I used chocolate chunks instead of chips for even more chocolate goodness!!! Yum!!"
"0","4","Good, but I would quite say amazing. I wasn't quite happy with the texture of the final cookie. (I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate ones.) I will try it again, though."
"0","5","I was looking for a recipe I could adapt to make mint chocolate chip cookies, and this worked perfectly. Add 2 tbsp creme de menthe liqueur, and two packages of chopped up Andes mints instead of the chocolate chips. They might need to cook for an extra minute with the additional liquid. Both the original version and my doctored version got rave reviews!"
"0","5","These cookies were really good I made them for my family and they Loved them."
"0","5","Yummy, yummy, yummy!!! Can you tell I loved them? Chocolate heaven, so moist and sweet - hit the spot. Kiddos keep asking when I'll make them again."
"0","5","Very good! I used 1 cup of pecans instead of 1/2 c walnuts (b/c that's what I had and I like extra nuts) and it was fabulous!"
"0","5","I was short flour, so mine turned out flat. The flavor was great, and next time I'll make sure I have enought ingredients! Thanks for sharing. Second time I had enough flour--these taste like the best brownie you've ever had. YUMMERS. Total keeper recipe."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful cookies. No changes needed. One time I didn't realize that I was out of chocolate chips until I was ready to add them, so I went without. My husband acted like I had broken some kind of law, but he still ate half the batch. I take these cookies over to friends houses and they request them over and over again."
"0","3","These cookies were good but I felt that it was missing something... Im not sure what but it was not as sweet as I thought it would be.. maybe I just prefer sweeter things but they were good over all..."
"0","5","These are the absolute best chocolate chocolate chip cookies EVER. I've been making them for about six or seven years now and people ask for the recipe every time. They also turn out wonderful with mint or peanut butter chips."
"0","5","I used whole wheat flour instead of white, decreased the cocoa powder by a bit, and used dark chocolate chips mixed with semi-sweet, but my boyfriend has declared these the best cookies that I've ever made. Great recipe!"
"0","5","Mmmm! These are AWESOME!! Very rich and chewy! Just how I like 'em. These cookies are very yummy with white chocolate chips added. I bet they would be great without anything added as the cookie itself is really, really good!"
"0","5","I made these with peanutbutter chips, and they were wonderful. I'll definately use this recipe again and again."
"0","3","The texture was great but I have to say, even as a chocolate lover, this had way too much cocoa. I dont know if I would make this recipe again but if I did, I would probably cut the cocoa by 1/3-1/2."
"0","5","Amazingly delicious. Astonishingly simple. I make these for new neighbors, baby showers, and other special occassions and always have people asking for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is a great one! The dough is so soft. I switched things up a bit by replacing sugar with 'splenda' (same measurements)and used mint chocolate chips (2 1/2 cups). They turned out excellent."
"0","4","There's no denying that these are good, but whoah, they are so rich! I mean, so rich that I couldn't enjoy an entire cookie! I didn't have walnuts, so I skipped that. I did use 1 1/2 cups semisweet chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, but that was just because that's all I had in my cupboards. :)"
"0","5","Pretty faultless really. Easy to make, and not as stiff to mix as I exected, but a little thick. I only had about 100g or so of chocolate chips left, so just used that. Next time I will add a little less cocoa. Easy made more than 24 cookies, but I like them small. Great cookies, nice texture! Thank you."
"0","5","I made these cookies exactly how the recipe said, they came out perfect. Everyone that tries them can't stop eating them, even the ones that don't like sweets. I would recommend them to any one."
"0","5","Excellent cookie. Followed recipe exactly and turned out perfect!"
"0","5","Excellent cookies. I did not expect them to turn out as good as they did, perfectly chewy and chocolately. I will make these for the rest of my cookie baking life!"
"0","5","Some of the best cookies I have ever made! Followed this recipe exactly and got fabulous results: really chocolatey without being unpalatably sweet! I recommend using this recipe."
"0","5","Great cookies and easy to make!! I used chopped almonds and I have to say it was very nice! My grandma loved it and she normally don't eat much cookies ^_^!"
"0","4","These cookies are easy to make and very tasty- i hardly got a chance to eat them because my sister and dad ate them all"
"0","5","Thank you so much for this amazing recipe. My boyfriends family was in town and they had a big family bbq. I figured since they were doing all the cooking, why don't I make some sort of dessert. Since my boyfriend loves chocolate chip cookies I decided to be brave and try making them from scratch for a change and your recipe was so easy to follow that I was done in no time.  They loved them!!! I added one ingredient to your recipe which was some hershey's chocolate syrup and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. The cookies were all eaten up by the next morning. I barely had one myself lol. I didn't mind though because it was such a big hit with the family that my boyfriend gave me some sugar of his own. So thank you again :)"
"0","5","My son wanted me to make these for his birthday but wanted peanut butter chips instead. Everyone loved them. I used less butter and they turned out great. I used my mixer since the dough it thick. I would definitely make these again...and again."
"0","5","Fantastic cookies and so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. They don't last very long in our house!"
"0","5","This recipe is great. The cookies turned out really moist and didnt dry out. I highly recommend this recipe!!!"
"0","4","These were really tasty, no doubt. But the batter is another story! Mine was so thick that I couldn't even stir it, so I had to blend with a hand mixer for a minute just to get it mixed up. My arm got a workout for sure. They also don't spread, but come out sort of thick and chunky. As someone else wrote, they are almost like a brownie. They are very tasty tho and definitely the answer to any craving for chocolate you might have. They are rich, chocolately and decadent. Served these at my sister's wine party, and everyone loved them."
"0","5","These are amazing so soft and chewy. I used 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup of butter and but 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar... They came out beautiful and delicious!!! SOOOO GOOOD"
"0","5","this is the most amazing cookie recipe ever!! Everyone ive given them to begs me for more. A while back someone suggested using white and brown sugar 2 to 1 which is what i do everytime. Also for the person who had a problem bcuz they were too soft...while one batch is cooking i put the next batch(on the sheet)in the fridge until the timer goes then i just keep switching the cookie sheets up till done. This should be done with all chocolate chip cookies. It makes them even chewier and they hold together better abd longer. Thx for the GREAT RECIPE."
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! I didn't add any walnut, and I used white and milk chocolate chips! Very, very good! Like brownies almost."
"0","5","Wow! These cookies are wonderful! The boyfriend LOVED them and said they're even better than his favorites at a local bakery! They don't keep well and are best eaten within 24-36 hours...don't worry, they won't last that long!"
"0","5","What a cookie should be- soft and chewy and delicious!!!"
"0","5","GREAT COOKIE!! MY FAMILY LOVED THEM...REALLY RICH CHOCOLATE!! V. TASTY!!"
"0","5","This is an amazing recipe! Everyone I shared the cookies with were amazed at how soft and delicious they were.   Instead of the walnuts, I added the same amount of toffee chips instead--it gives them a great crunch! This last time I also added some dried cranberries for some extra chewiness...and so I can pretend that they're healthy. :-)  To deal with the stickiness, I just put the dough in the fridge between batches--it hardened up enough to work with, but it didn't compromise the flavor or consistency.  Overall, these cookies are the best. Both times I've made them, I've done a double recipe...and they're still gone within two days!"
"0","3","At first when the cookies came out of the oven they were absolutely great, and they tasted chocolaty and delicious. However after only a day the cookies turned hard a began to crumble away into something that the kids I baby sat and my friends just wouldn't eat. These are better to be eaten with in a day of making them..."
"0","5","I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet and used half brown sugar, half white. Took longer to cook, I'd say about 15 minutes. I halved the recipe and it made 17 good-sized cookies. Delish!"
"0","5","These cookies are delicious. My husband and I made one batch yesterday and tonught we made a double recipe with chocolate chunks. Yum!"
"0","5","The BEST!!!! I made the recipe just as it reads. They tasted like yummy little bites of brownies. WOW"
"0","4","these are nice! they are very soft, almost cakey! it was hard getting them uniform though."
"0","5","This is awesome. I am ridiculously picky about my chocolate, but I've made this recipe at least four times already."
"0","5","These cookies were awesome... I made them for a weekly morning meeting we have at our house and they had many compliments. By noon, nobody wanted to eat the lunch we served because they had eaten too many cookies! I will definitely make them again..."
"0","5","So very good. My family loves cookies and these were eaten up in two days!!! Great recipe and one I go to very often for my 'Cookie Monsters'."
"0","5","I made a reduced-fat and healthier version, which I absolutely love! I use only 1/2 cup of butter and then a 1/2 cup of water (I'd like to try applesauce too). I also did not add chocolate chips the first time I made them because I did not have any. My roommates and I love the cookies without the chips as they are not overly sweet and contain a very low calorie content for cookies. We make them frequently now!"
"0","5","THESE WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS!! yummmm! They came out so perfect....just the right texture and everything! They come out really dark (and taste better in my opinion) if you use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. I love this recipe!"
"0","5","This cookie is sooo good, very rich and decadent. MY FAMILY LOVES THEM!!!"
"0","5","These cookies are the best! I made them for the first time the other day and am in the process of making more. They were eaten quickly! They're like brownies in cookie form. I also subbed half the butter for shortening. Delicious! A new favorite in my house."
"0","5","These were fantastic, I used a bit less butter, maybe 2/3 cup and they still turned out beautiful. It makes so much as well!! I took a dozen or more to work and they got wolfed down!! Thanks for the fantastic recipe. I also used chopped up Nestle Melts instead of chips (might be a New Zealand only ingredient?)"
"0","4","The cookies were great, just not what I (nor my husband) are used too. I decided to try a different recipe than the one that I usually use to make Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies. Since this one had such high scores I fugured, what the heck. Nothing wrong with them in general, they were tasty, just a a little more dry (crisp, I can't really say hard, but they were crunchy.) we prefer chewy and a little more dense. I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips. I doubled the batch and took a ton of them to work and they never lasted long!"
"0","5","these cookies were so easy to make and they made a big hit !!"
"0","5","I added white chocolate chips and pecan chips.(Don't care for walnuts) I wanted the brownie-like cookie so I cooled the dough as suggested on a previous review. Great cookie! Next time I'll try without chocolate chips. They would be perfect with a scoop of ice cream and a little chocolate syrup for a brownie sundae."
"0","4","Good ! A lighter version of a brownie. Not too sweet which is what we prefer. A nice variation from just the simple chocolate chip cookie."
"0","5","Amazing!!! I made these using Ghirardelli cocoa and used about 1 1/4 cup Andes peppermint crunch baking chips and 1 cup chocolate chunks for the chocolate chips. Absolutely delcious! Mine also made about 5 dozen cookies. Great to share and very festive!"
"0","5","Wow! What a wonderful cookie recipe. My family loves these. I reduce the sugar 1/4 cup. We like them a little less sweet."
"0","5","Excellent cookie-but I should have read the reviews first. I learned the hard way that these (at least in my oven) take much more than the 8 minutes...probably the range for my oven is 10-13 minutes. Great cookie though-absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","These cookies are so easy and yummy. I use those dark - non stick - double layer cookie sheets and I had to cook these for 11 min. Everything else was the same. Fantastic! Will definitely make these again."
"0","4","Cookies turned out great! My family really enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","4","I debated whether or not to give this recipe five stars. I ended up taking one off because they don't keep well. They're best served the day that they're baked. That said, my friends raved over how good they are. Just be sure NOT to over-bake them!"
"0","5","Great cookies!!! We doubled the recipe (using half butter and half shortening) and added a bag of York Mini Peppermint Patties and a bag of vanilla chips instead of chocolate chips. They smelled delicious and baked up great."
"0","5","I substituted peppermint chips for the chocolate chips in these. Everyone at church loves them. I'm making more right now."
"0","5","this recipe is wonderful! so rich and chocolaty...mine were done in 8 to 8.5 minutes, and turned out so great..a very easy cookie with great results, and an excellent rich taste! everyone loved them! try this, you will be hooked!"
"0","5","These cookies are amazing! I used all vegetable shortening instead of butter since that was all I had onhand, and I beat the shortening, eggs, vanilla and sugar for probably ten minutes to get it as creamy as possible before adding everything else. I put them in for 8 minutes, because I like a softer cookie, and my fiance and I have eaten about half of them already -- and the last batch is still in the oven!  Thanks for a great recipe -- this one's a keeper."
"0","5","Best cookie I've ever made."
"0","4","These were very good."
"0","5","Great recipe! My family has done nothing but rave about it! Thanks for sharing! I used pecans instead of walnuts because I don't like walnuts but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly! Thanks again!"
"0","5","Great recipe! I needed a quick, easy, tasty cookie for a cookie exchange. These baked up perfectly and are yummy!"
"0","5","I was looking for a chocolate chocolate chip cookie and was glad that I chose this one! This is an excellent recipe - the cookie is moist and delicious. You will not be disappointed if you make this recipe!!!"
"0","5","Ooey Gooey FABULOUS! Didn't change of thing other than I used all organic ingredients."
"0","5","Very good cookie! I substitued Ande mint chips for the chocolate chips."
"0","5","We love this recipe - kind of like brownies, only cookies with a bit of crunch on the edges when they are fresh. I used a bit less sugar - about 1 1/4 cups and a bit more salt - about 1/2 teaspoon. They got rave reviews from the employees at my husband's company."
"0","5","these were really good. The only thing bad about them is... I ate them all!"
"0","4","I enjoyed the cookies but they weren't eaten up as fast as I expected. I also experimented and added coconut to half of the batter, but that did not really work out so I would not recommend it."
"0","5","Raw ingredients to in my tummy in less than 30 minutes!!! WOW! these are great. I had all of the ingredients on hand and I whipped them up in no time. They have a wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except no walnuts. I also made them big and cooked for about 10 minutes. I am going to store the dough in the refigerator and make some more tomorrow. If I make them all now they'll be gone by the time I go to bed!"
"0","5","These cookies are awesome. I halved the recipe, and it worked really well. The only change I made was I added a half cup of chopped cranberries. Delicious!!"
"0","5","Easy and taste great. I went a little heavy on the coca powder. Mine did end up flattening as they cooled. I think they were cooked perfectly at 9 minutes…maybe I went too light on the baking soda. I was out of vanilla so I used almond extract, I think this helped give them such a great flavor."
"0","5","Fantastic! I made these following the recipe exactly and they are awesome cookies. They are very fudge like and the dough is very thick to work with... but the results are totally worth it. Next time i will add a teaspoon of espresso powder to the dough just because i like coffee with chocolate- but they are perfect as is!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
"0","5","Outstanding! I read the reviews before making this recipe, I just knew my husband would love them, especially having a consistency of brownies..."
"0","5","Very tasty recipe, works well with mint chips or alone as just a chocolate cookie! A big hit, my husband loved them."
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for ages now - just love it. Today I added some crushed chiles after the chips. Wow! I am addicted to a local restaurants chocolate chile dessert, and I always look for chile chocolates when I am in specialty stores. Finally I can get my fix at home."
"0","5","I made these last night and they are amazing. I cut the recipe in half and I added white chocolate chunks and raisins. I also added a drop of water at the end as the mixture was so dense. Had to cook them for 12mins, think that was probably my oven though!  They turned out lovely and moist, perfect! Thanks for a great recipe."
"0","5","Awesome is all my husband could say... I didn't change anything ... I just followed the instructions and these cookies are definitely my husband favorites right now!"
"0","5","THese cookies were so undeniably rich and delicious that even my health-nut mother, who is usually only interested in things if they're healthy, asked for the recipie. They are very much like brownies, so are best if left very soft, a little underdone."
"0","4","I followed the recipe exactly and they are quite good. I did flatten them before putting them in the oven, but other than that, a simple and yummy recipe."
"0","5","Wonderful cookie for chocolate lovers. You need some big biceps to stir in those chocolate chips and nuts! I ended up with 60something cookies. My only change was I used 1 cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar. I cooked them 9 minutes, at 8 minutes they were a little too soft for me."
"0","5","These are some of the best cookies I've made!"
"0","5","Wonderfully Naughty! We will never make regular chocolate chip cookies again! Probably the best cookies we have ever had!"
"0","4","These tasted too much like cocoa powder to me and I love chocolate. The texture was nice and soft once baked but the dough is pretty hard to mix by hand."
"0","5","Delicious!! Mine didn't come out quite as fluffy as the ones in the picture but I think it's because I took them out too early. Still incredibly delicious!!! Better than any you could buy in the store."
"0","5","Chocolate heaven!! These cookies were moist and so very good. Thanks for such a great cookie recipe."
"0","5","the dough is awesome,...and the cookies..omg..umm..excuse me..my sons heading that way...(i used blue bonnet instead of butter,)..."
"0","4","i kinda think these were little dry and there was too much of a brownie flavor."
"0","5","Excellent! I used 2 cups (200g) of chopped, 72% cocoa chocolate and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. Half raw sugar and half demerara (loose). They taste awesome!"
"0","4","These cookies are delicious! However, I added about 1/4 cup more flour than the recipe called for. I also had to bake the cookies for 3 minutes longer than the recipe stated. Overall this recipe is great."
"0","5","I loved these. Pumpkin is my favorite muffin flavor and the glaze gives it just the right sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly except the glaze I didn't measure the ingredients I just used the sugar and orange to my own consistency."
"0","5","yeah, awesome. really, really good. and i used half shortening, half butter."
"0","4","These are wonderful but took advice from others to watch the time. I left the in as stated but they did not hold up well at all. I recommend leaving them in longer."
"0","4","I LOVE THEM THEY WERE VERY MOIST AND CHOCOLATY...MMMMM"
"0","5","Good cookies! I was craving brownies, but didn't want to wait for them to cook, so I made these and they gave me the same taste in less than half the time. Yummy! - I omitted the chocolate chips, as I didn't have any, but I can imagine they would've been even better with!"
"0","5","These are incredible! The only problem is that I should've doubled the batch. My daughter's friends were over and pretty much wiped them out. Thanks, Kathy. Will definetely be making again."
"0","5","My Sister and I made these cookies, adding walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts. They came out terrific. I will definitally make them again."
"0","4","Yummy! Very chocolate-y... almost too much (and this is coming from a major choco-holic). I've made these several times and I cut the amount of chocolate chips in half, and double the walnuts which seems to balance the flavours better."
"0","5","Great recipe! I followed the instructions exactly, only leaving the walnuts out and baking for 12 minutes instead of 10."
"0","5","Even my health-nut mother, who usually will not eat things unless they are low-fat and low-sugar, tried these cookies, loved them, and repeatedly asked for the recipe. These are the best cookies I've ever eaten!"
"0","5","very rich cookie. when I make these I like to put the black and white Hersheys swirled chips in to add a little pop. they hold there shape a little better too. either way is excellent though."
"0","5","OH my gosh these cookies are the best! Just what I was looking for from a break from the regular chocolate chip, I will make these again no doubt!"
"0","5","i made these with half brown sugar and sprinkled white chocolate chips on top before putting them in the oven. DELICIOUS!! i'm making them again tonight."
"0","5","Great Cookie. I made a 2nd batch after loving the 1st. I cut back the cocoa powder & the chocolate chips just by a little because it was so chocolaty."
"0","5","These truly were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I made them and within a few hours, every one of them had been eaten. I had guests for souper and each guest ate about 10 cookies each, loll... They're actually 'dangerous', this is deffinatly a keeper... But I won't be making them too often; not unless intend on gaining 100 pounds or so... =P One word describes them best: irresistable."
"0","5","These cookies are really wonderful. Nice and soft. Great chocolate flavor. I used mini chocolate chips instead of large chocolate chips. I think they made the cookies even better. They tasted just like a brownie!!"
"0","5","Wow! These are magnificent!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and they were perfect. This recipe is a keeper."
"0","5","These are fantastic! I just made these to cheer up my husband, and boy o boy did it work!! :) Will definately make these again real soon."
"0","5","These are my boyfriend's absolute favorite cookies! I think I make a batch every week for him! I've also tried them with skor pieces and also with white chocolate chips (so that way they're triple chocolate cookies!)"
"0","5","Sooooo good I serve them to my friends at bring-a-plate parties. They love them andso do I, I almost can't bear to give them away. I like to make them with white chocolate chunks instead of plain choc chips. A beautiful contrast and extra tempting."
"0","5","These are the best chocolate chip cookies that I have EVER had!"
"0","5","THESE ARE SOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!  We baked them for 8 minutes and they came out sooo soft & gooey & 150% full of chocolate goodness!!"
"0","2","this is not the best recipie i've ever tasted"
"0","5","These are awesome!! I was also concerned about the batter being really dry, but it works. I found baking the full ten minutes turned out the best."
"0","4","Great! Really rich and were just as good a couple days later."
"0","5","Everyone in my family liked them a lot! They stayed moist in a Ziploc bag during the week. Overall a good cookie, will add more chocolate chips next time!!"
"0","5","Amaaaazing cookies! I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, and they are delicious... very rich!"
"0","4","MY HUSBAND IS A TRUE CHOCOLATE AND BROWNIE LOVER - HE LOVED THESE! HOWEVER, I THOUGHT THEY WERE A LITTLE TO CHOCOLATY FOR MY LIKING"
"0","4","This are pretty good cookies - really chocolatey! You definitly need a tea with them:) I was a little worried because the batter seems really dry, but they turned out great."
"0","5","Excellent...satisified our sweet tooths! Thanks for sharing :)"
"0","5","If you need a good dose of chocolate, these cookies are for you! We make these regularly using 1/2 white chips and 1/2 chocolate chips. These cookies are very rich, almost fudgy. They sure are yummy."
"0","5","My girls just loved the Double Chocolate cookies!!"
"0","5","I've made these several times now and always get compliments and requests for the recipe. Great cookie..doesn't last long at our house!"
"0","5","These were very good. My sons new favorite cookie."
"0","3","i made half the recipe, put extra cocoa, white chocolate chips, and macadamia nuts in it. i guess the extra dry ingredients stopped my cookie from spreading at all. they weren't that chocolatey flavored, was it because i used nestle baking cocoa?"
"0","5","the easys cookie recipe I ever made. I added baker's semi-sweet chocolate chunks plus chip and half the sugar and it turned out great. 10mins to make and 8mins to baked,"
"0","4","Yummy!!!!! Will make again. Very chewy and delcious."
"0","5","Totally awesome recipe! I took a batch to work and they were gone in the first ten minutes. I must say that near the end they are a little hard to stir but they make for a wonderful, not too sweet cookie! Thanks"
"0","5","This is the best chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found! I like to use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips from time to time, they are to die for! Also, white chocolate chips are good."
"0","5","Chewy, fudgy goodness! Lacking white sugar, I used a little bit of sucanat, and mostly maple sugar. Still fabulous!"
"0","5","I made these cookies for my team after a particularly hard week and they LOVED THEM. They stay VERY gooey and are very rich. I added a bit of Dime bar; that was a hit too."
"0","5","These are so good! Absolutely to die for!"
"0","4",": )!"
"0","5","Really good. I used milk chocolate chips instead and didn't use quite as much cocoa. My kids loved them!"
"0","5","VERY good cookies! They are soft and chewy, a bit rich, but delicious.  Thanks for sharing! This is a keeper and I will be sharing it with all my friends and family."
"0","5","Wonderful!!! Used Hershey's Cocoa, baking 9 minutes on the middle oven shelf was perfect timing, and they remained moist for days after. Single-layer store in a sheet cake-sized tupperware container to avoid crumbling - NOT ZIPLOC bags!! My only complaint..... cannot eat just ONE!!!"
"0","5","Absolutly FABULOUS!! The best I ever tasted.. thanks for sharing with us.. Jenni Proctor MN"
"0","3","These were a little too dry for my liking. But, flavor was good!"
"0","5","These cookies are GREAT and I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were that I unknowingly was out of vanilla and had already started making them. I was going to just leave it out, but the batter is very stiff and was difficult to stir by hand (I'll probably use a mixer next time) so I added a splash of milk. The other change that I made was I used 3/4 C chocolate chips & 1 1/4 C Reese's Pieces!! Delicious!! I will definitely be making these again- family & friends LOVED them. I also noticed that they didn't seem to spread very much, so I could fit 12-15 cookies on a tray (although it didn't quite make 4 dozen). Great recipe- THANK YOU!! :o)"
"0","5","These were superb, easy to make, and came out perfectly."
"0","5","very good! A little sweet for me, but everyone liked them. thanks for the great recipe!!"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe for chocolate chocolate chip cookies! The cookies are soft and yet still have a bit of crunch, and they're very tasty. These cookies were a hit with my family and people at my husband's office when I made them for an office party. They were also excellent when I tried them at the holidays with peppermint chips instead of the chocolate chips. (As a side note, I don't use the optional walnuts when I made these.) I would highly recommend this recipe!"
"0","5","I made these for a Chirstmas present for some family friends and they were SO SO SO YUMMY! Defintely a keeper!"
"0","5","wow! the only thing i would change the next time i make them is that i'll use an apron because cocoa stains. i also used less butter and added a little shortening. not bad. i will try it with butter next time to see the difference. thanks for the great recipe."
"0","5","I have been using this recipe for 2 years now. They are a favorite in my family. I usually make them as directed, but this year I have a request for white chocolate chips.  5 star recipe!"
"0","5","Chewy, chocolatey, and delicious. Wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","This is my favorite cookie so far. The first time they were made, was by my 11 year old daughter, it was her very first batch of cookies, and she beat me in the cookie department big time. We all love them, this recipe is a keeper."
"0","5","I got more compliments on this cookie. It is a wonderful, tasty cookie. Just the right amount of chocolate taste. I followed the recipe excatly and it came out great."
"0","5","Just made these cookies last night. Substituted in half of the brown sugar like many suggested. My husband said they were the best cookies I have made yet!! So chocolately delicious. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","THis recipe gives me new hope in making cookies, I goofed on the first batch making them much too large. Future reference always use a teaspoon to put dough on cookie sheet. Second batch came out perfect. I cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 of us and it was great."
"0","5","I would give these 10 stars if I could!!! AMAZING!!! I also used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar...also, I accidentally only used 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter the second time I made them and I couldn't tell the difference."
"0","5","My family LOVED these. Will make these again whenever possible."
"0","5","I loved this recipe! I didn't have cocoa powder, so I substituted two ounces baking chocolate, melted. Also, I don't like chocolate chips or nuts in my cookies, so I used two cups of oatmeal...chocolate oatmeal cookies! They were gone as soon as they came out of the oven..great recipe!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe!!! The chocolate flavor of the dough isn't too powerful, which is what i've run into in the past. Makes a very 'chubby' cookie that the whole family will love!!! I will continue to follow this recipe for years to come!"
"0","5","this recipe was good but I use 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and a cup of cocoa turn out very good"
"0","4","Very easy and tasty, my family just prefer them more chocolaty and crunchy."
"0","5","These are great!"
"0","5","Everyone loved them. I only had 1/3 C. of cocoa powder and they still turned out great. I can't wait to try them with 2/3 c."
"0","5","Wonderful!! Got many rave reviews from the guys! They are a bit too decadent for some, though. Maybe I will add less sugar next time."
"0","5","obviously just the best cookie recipe on this site!!! i've used it quite a few times now; it's just perfect!"
"0","5","very good. . .i had to increase the baking time by a couple of minutes but still moist, gooey and soo chocolatey"
"0","5","I´m a cooking girl vom germany and had been on quest for a really american style chocolate cookie. I´ve found it. It is endless choco and melts in mouth.....-> oral orgasm!!!!"
"0","3","the taste was good and had a strong chocolate flavour, but they are rich, it is good for young children mostly who like sugary taste. I did 1 cup white sugar, and half a cup brown, and i also added 1/4 cup flour, and reduced the chocolate chips. They took more than 10 minutes to be cooked, and seem like they were not cooked enough. They were chewy and i did not like their texture.   Netx time if i do them i will reduce the cocoa, and reduce sugar and chocolate chips! But i don't think i will do them again"
"0","4","These were really good...my boyfriend gobbled them up no problem!"
"0","5","Yummy! These are very moist and tasty. The dough is a little runny but the cookies turn out great. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","These were great, for a chocolate craving they hit the spot. Did not have any nuts in the house, but i think they would taste better with them, I will add pecans next time."
"0","5","These taste so good - I have made them every weekend this month! - the kids literally 'Eat them up as fast as they come out of the oven!'  Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","This is the best-tasting chocolate cookie! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious."
"0","5","My son says this cookies taste like oreo sans the cream they disappear very fast."
"0","5","These cookies are so good. Still moist two days later (though it's a miracle there are still any left)."
"0","5","My kids now want these instead of regular chocolate chip cookies!!"
"0","5","These are great cookies. The only thing I changed was that I used a bag of peanut butter and milk chocolate chips."
"0","5","Came out great with 1/2c sugar and 1/2c brown sugar as others have suggested. Also used mini M&M instead of chips and left out the nuts. Refrigerated dough for a few hours before baking. These were a big hit!"
"0","4","I used 1/2 c Crisco & 1/2 c Fleischman's margarine. On the sugar I used 1c of brown sugar and 1/2 c of white. I cut back on the cocoa to 1/3c and added 1/4 c of flour. I upped the soda to 1 tsp and the salt to 1/2 tsp. With 5 little kids, I dont have time to make 'cookies', so I put the batter into a jelly roll pan to make bars and baked for about 15 min (I like them gooey). They were absolutely d'lish! I guess this could be a new recipe, but the one Kathy had was a good base!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I didn't change a thing. Thanks!"
"0","5","Great recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar and it turned out very flavorful. My kids and hubby loved the cookies and gobbled them up!"
"0","5","Perfect for someone with an overactive sweet tooth like me. I accidentally picked up peppermint extract while I was looking for the vanilla but decided to put it in anyways. It added a nice hint of mint flavor mixed in with the chocolate."
"0","5","Just Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and they are just to die for! yummy!"
"0","5","Like a truffle in cookie form :) I made the following changes: substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with dark brown, used salted butter so eliminated the salt in the recipe, I used a cookie scoop that was heaping, so I baked for 10 minutes, didn't add nuts. Came out very chewy, gooey, rich and yummy."
"0","5","This Chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe is absolutely delicious! My four boys love them, and so does everyone else that has tried them. We make them for everything! They are so good!!!!!"
"0","5","I made these for my Bible study, and they loved them! I used pecans instead of walnuts. I wish there were some way to get caramel blobs in there, too; that would be AWESOME."
"0","4","hmm couldn't tell if the cookies were done yet since i tried to make them huge... so ended up making the first batch sort of hard. halved the recipe, added white chocolate chips, and replaced some of the white sugar with brown. the bf didn't like them as much as the best chocolate chip cookies on this site, but they were a bit different from the usual."
"0","5","These cookies were easy to make and the kids couldnt eat them fast enough.I will definately make these again."
"0","5","Wonderful! They don't flatten out too much, and look and taste like chocolate chocolate chip cookies: not too light or darkly colored/flavored. I used smart balance in place of butter and brown sugar in place of white sugar. The result... incredibly soft cookies that stayed soft for day (or would have, had they lasted that long)."
"0","5","I made these cookies for my honey & brother in law. I substituted 1/2 a cup of brown sugar for the white sugar & used peanut butter chips. I baked them for 12 minutes. They turned out incredible. Nice & soft. Great chocolate flavour. This recipe is a keeper, to add to my collection of thousands,lol."
"0","5","yum! halved the recipe and it worked just fine - used shredded coconut in place of optional nuts (used a full 1/2 cup even though I was halving the recipe) and also used part brown sugar for the white sugar - so chocolatey and good texture..."
"0","5","These are some of the most delicious cookies I've ever made. This recipie is wonderful! Thank you for posting a super-tasty, easy and quick recipie."
"0","5","So good! I too used 1/2 brown sugar and they turned out great. I think these cookies would be great even without the chocolate chips, maybe with a little powdered sugar on top. Either way, these are a hit!"
"0","5","This is the absolute best cookie recipe ever! I made them by the tablespoon because we like our cookies BIG! Even so, it still only took 10 minutes to set, and they are chewy and gooey after they cool down a bit. Next time I'm using I Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks to cut the calories. By making these big, the WW Points Plus was 5 per cookie, but if you make them by the teaspoon it will cut them to 2 or 3 PP."
"0","5","I would give these 4.5 stars. They were very good, but mine were NOT done after 8 mins. It took the full 10. I also used 1 stick butter and 1 stick of margarine. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Very good for a different kind of cookie, but definitely cook them the 10 minutes! Ally"
"0","5","Intensely chocolate-y! I've used half butter/half transfat-free marg., a combination of white and brown sugars and have even substituted some of the white flour w/finely ground whole wheat flour - they disappear quickly no matter which variation I make."
"0","5","They are wonderful, soft, and delicious! I used whole wheat flour and all brown sugar instread..and it worked out perfectly! Great recipe!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe. For a spicy treat, add about 1 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper. It may sound weird, but it just adds a bite to the taste, and goes surprisingly well with chocolate."
"0","5","These cookies were amazing! My husband and I love em! Thank You For Sharing!"
"0","5","These are a great treat - I don't make them very often because I can't stay out of them... I've usually eaten my weight in dough before I can even get them into the oven. Rich and chocolatey. I usually make them with white chocolate chips - makes them a bit prettier. Good recipe."
"0","5","These cookies were very good, but were not the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have had. I thought they could have been more chocolatey. I think next time I will use a whole cup of cocoa powder."
"0","5","Wow! These are awesome! My 15 year old daughter has made these twice this week because of family demand! But instead of making cookies she spread the batter onto an oven pan (14x13) and made brownie-like cookies. We live in Africa so the sizes of pans are different from the States, but I'm sure it would work with a 9x13 pan. I'm just not sure of the cooking time. They've turned out great each time and fun to make with kids. But they don't last long in the house! Very yummy!"
"0","5","Delicious"
"0","5","I added more chocolate chips because I'm a chocoholic. These cookies went fast. They are every chocolate lovers dream."
"0","3","My cookies didn't turn out like the ones in the picture because they went flat as soon as they came out of the oven. Nice taste but far too thin and un-cookie-ish."
"0","5","The best chocolate chip cookies!. To get them more crunchy you can bake it for 15 mins. My childern love it very much!"
"0","5","Very good cookies, moist and chocolatey. The recipe made lots of cookies too, I got about 3 dozen big cookies. I'll definitely make these again."
"0","5","very chocolatey, very good!!"
"0","5","So good, and simple to make! I don't even like chocolate chip cookies, but these are amazing."
"0","5","These cookies are soooo good,soft and chewy-yummy. Only problem I have is that I make them for my grandsons and I can't keep their grandfather out of them. By far the best chocolate-chocolate chip cookie I have tasted."
"0","5","REALLY GOOOOOD and easy to make  *ME LIKES COOKIES*"
"0","5","Wonderful recipe. I did as some suggested and traded 1/2 cup of the sugar with brown sugar, and I only used half of the suggested chips, because we don't like to overdo things in our family, and they were fantastic. They taste like little brownies. Hubby, who generally hates chips in general, pretty much ate everything left after the kids had their shot.  Gooooood cookie...."
"0","5","Quickly became a favorite."
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe!! Soft, rich, and moist. I used 4oz 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate bar (chopped) instead of 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips because that was what I had. It turned out great. I will probably use the same chocolate next time. Thank you Kathy. I think I will give this recipe to my family in Japan!"
"0","5","This is the BEST Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe ever! So far I've given this recipe to my mom, my grandma and my sister. My husband refuses all other cookies, except this one! The only thing I do slightly differently is add about 2 Tbsp of milk alternating with the dry mixture. Makes it a little easier to work with..."
"0","5","I was quite worried when I was making these cookies. I had read some of the negative comments on the page, and was thinking about a different recipe.  However, I made these cookies with the greatest ease. I made these at school for a class project and they turned out beautifully!  I made a batch of 20 and by the time I got home there were only 4 left! They were delicious and the perfect texture. Everybody loved them. Mmmmm...   A*****!"
"0","5","Delicious! They were gone so quick I tried baking another batch to put in the freezer (they do freeze well) but that didn't stop them from defrosting it themselves and gobbling it all up!"
"0","4","These cookies were pretty good. I took the advice of another reviewer & substituted 1/2 cup golden brown sugar and instead of the white sugar I added 1/2 Splenda for Baking. I also used Reses Peanut Butter Chips instead of chocolate chips. They came out very cakey, but good still."
"0","5","I love this one. Very Very chocolatie and a big hit with the co-workers."
"0","5","just 1 cookie satisfied my chocolate craving, but i had another because they tasted sooo good. but that was all i could handle, they are so rich and sweet. Dangerously Delicious!"
"0","4","Good, just a little too much chocolate."
"0","5","I have been trying for so long to make chewy cookies, and I finally succeeded with this recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies are my sons favorite. They are so chocolaty and sweet no one can resist! Definetly an A++++++. And theyre easy to make too! I really like to add some milk chocolate, dark and white chocolate chips to it! My favorite!"
"0","5","My kids and I love them. All that chocolate hits the spot. Thanks for such a good recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its good with milk.Also it takes about 14 mins to cook."
"0","5","all I can say is YUM. If you are having a chocolate craving, this will help!!"
"0","5","Probably the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made - I had to halve the recipe so I wouldn't eat them all! Good for kids, but the cocoa powder gives it an extra touch for adults as well."
"0","5","Awesome good! Loved these cookies. Angela"
"0","5","this is a great family recipe. It's fast and easy, but also tastey and delicious this is a great recipe for chocolate lovers."
"0","5","Amazing. If you are going to not eat them right away, I would suggest cooking them less than you would if you were eating them fresh. They stay gooeyer that way, and don't seem over done."
"0","4","After all the previous reviews I couldn't wait to try these. That being said, I didn't think they were excellent- but they were good. I found that they tasted better a couple of days later. My family really loved these so maybe it was me. The batter was really yummy, and they turned out beautiful. I would make these again if they were requested- but not on my own. :)"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous. No nuts, and I used Nestle Semi-sweet/white chocolate chips (a new chip from Nestle) and a some semi-sweet Hershey chocolate chips, also instead of butter I used shortening. Turned out perfect, I will make these again!!!"
"0","5","This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I've made these no fewer than 5 times in the past two months... I found these Andes Mint chips last week and thought they would go nice with these - - they are wonderful, if you like mint."
"0","5","This is the best recipe for chocolate cookies that I have tried so far."
"0","5","This recipe is GREAT!! I had all the ingredients on hand and it was no time before I had cookies to eat. My husband loved these cookies and I will make them again"
"0","4","These were easy to make and very good. They were very chocolaty and rich--maybe a little too rich for some people, but kids loved them."
"0","5","These are awesomely delicious!!! These cookies pass the test when it comes to an easy cookie recipe with little prep time & quick bake time as well. I used Nestle Cocoa Powder, because it was the least expensive one ( the unsweetened brand in my local vons was $8.39 opposed to $3.99 for Nestle. I also substituted the chips & used White Chocolate Chips to make an excellent Black & White Chipper Cookie. I didnt use nuts because I prefer the cookies without them. Love this recipe!"
"0","5","Great recipe and a no-brainer. I'm no ace when it comes to baking, but I made these cookies for a party, and they turned out wonderfully. The cookies were really moist and super chocolaty. My only mistake was not making enough. People quickly attacked my plate of cookies (foregoing even the tiramisu and cake that the host of the party served), and I ended up staring at an empty plate 5 minutes after I set the cookies down. I'd say that's a good sign."
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and these really are wonderful cookies. Most choc chip cookie recipes require brown sugar but I realized I was out and too lazy to go to the store. This recipe really gives a cookie that is just perfect. Thanks."
"0","4","I made them extra small drop cookies and cut the recipe in half, and they still came out great."
"0","5","the yummiest chewy cookie ever!slightly crispy edges chewy middles.everyone loves me for baking these cookies! I increased the flour by 1 cup,baking soda from 3/4 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon and cocoa powder from 2/3 cup to 3/4 cup.I chilled the dough for 2 hours.I rolled them into 4cm balls and baked them for 15 mins. it turned out well.they r not falt n they taste so chocolatey n nice!but they can only keep for 2 days or they'll get dry even though u don't open the cookie jar. I'll definitely bake these again.=)"
"0","5","Very easy and yummy. I Chilled the batter before baking, find it easier with any chocolate chip cookie recipe. Will bake these again!!!!"
"0","5","great cookies! and great recipe for space cakes! last time it was only 2 stars when I absolutely meant 5 stars.. sorry."
"0","5","These cookies are delicious and very chocolatey...exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect!!! My family just loved them. Thanks so much- I will be making these again."
"0","3","Not the most attractive cookies... I added mint extract and Andes mint chips...not bad, but not overly chocolatey."
"0","5","Wow! These cookies are so chocolately and so good - just like eating a brownie! All you chocolate lovers out there beware!!! Great recipe!!"
"0","5","Absolutely fantastic. Need to search no further for any other chocolate chip cookie recipes. Too bad we don't have six stars, only five."
"0","5","This is the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies I have ever tried!!! I omitted the walnuts and added a little more chips, the cookies were absolutely delicious, and addictive."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. The cookies are soft and very chocolatey! I got great results by using Ghirardelli cocoa. I also think the cookies turn out better if you refrigerate the dough for a few minutes, roll into balls and then immediately get them into a hot oven. I will definitely keep this recipe handy."
"0","5","WOO!! Am re-rating this to a 5 star cuz' it taste really yummy the next day!! Added M&M and extra choco chips and it is really fantastic!!"
"0","5","Awsome! The best double chocolate cookies ever!! everyone who ate them looved them. I am definately making these again!"
"0","5","These cookies were a hit with my friends. Used about a third less butter and only 1 cup of sugar and they still turned out chewy and chocolately."
"0","5","These cookies came out great. The only changes I made was use 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. I also put less cocoa powder in. They were still very chocolatey and yummy!! I think these are the best cookies I have ever made!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly, it's a keeper, thanks"
"0","5","These were fabulous, they turned out nice and soft and not hard, I am normally not a fan of nuts but I chopped them up into small bits and it was great."
"0","5","YUM! Cured my chocolate craving! Didn't change a thing in the recipe. Quick, easy, and delicious. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks!"
"0","4","Way tooooo chocolately for me; however other will love these. They come out soft & chewy and smell great! You have to LOVE chocolate to love these!"
"0","5","I just baked these. They are very rich and chocolatey! If it's chocolate you want, make these! Cookies baked up nicely, good texture and consistancy, and soft in the center."
"0","5","I've been using this recipe for over a year now, and I love it. We omit the nuts, but this is my new favorite cookie recipe! Really hits the spot when I need a chocolate fix! Try replacing 1 c. of the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips for a different taste. YUMMY!"
"0","5","Excellent! I baked chocolate chips cookies for the first time ever using this recipie (without modifying it) and I'm so pleased with myself.  The cookies are perfect and delicious, and I can't wait to impress all my friends with my fabulous baking skills."
"0","5","I made these cookies last night with my daughters, and my oldest mistook the measurement of 14tsp of salt for 3/4 tsp..We cooked them anyways and they came out still delicious!! These are the BEST choco-choco chip cookies that I have ever tasted!!! They are soft on the inside with crisp edges. I wouldn't divert from the recipie at all! Use butter not margarine, and I used a bit more extra choco chips! This recipie is a DEFINATE keeper! Kudos Kathy!!!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for this recipe, it's a regular in my cookie baking rotation."
"0","5","Great cookies. They are brownie-esque, only easier to make."
"0","4","Really good cookies! My boys and husband love them and I can't stop eating them. After reading reviews I did use 3/4 cup Blue Bonnet stick margarine and 1/4 cup Crisco. Also was careful not to overbake, only 8-9 minutes. Like any cookie they were very soft when they came out but firmed up nicely and have stayed soft and delicious! I will save this recipe."
"0","5","awesome!"
"0","5","Delicious! Very chocolatey and scrumptious, these were what I was looking for and more..I had been searching some time for a chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe, one that would turn out like the cookies in the store, and this was perfect!!! When they came out of the oven, they were so dark...Yum!!Just a question, where did you find this recipe?"
"0","5","Oh My!!! The best way to my kids hearts! and all of their friends. Extremely rich, and well, just to die for!"
"0","5","I just loved this recipe. I added white and milk chocolate chips. I also changed the sugar to 1/2 brown and 1 cup white. These will be a family fav."
"0","5","Very good cookies, I ate so many I got a tummy ache which is bad, but cookies are still good :)"
"0","5","My family loved these cookies, I did not have but 3/4 cup of chocolate chips so I put in a 1/2 cup quick oats and they were wonderful"
"0","4","great, easy to make... loved them!"
"0","5","Very delicious and rich...oozes chocolate when they are fresh from the over, and later become a soft inside/crunchy outside cookie. I followed this recipe to the T and didn't see any reason to expirement with it. This will cure even the worst chocolate craving. If you loooove chocolate, these are for you!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. For the first time ever I have made a really good chocolate chip cookie."
"0","4","well i guess it muz be too sweet so i'd reduced the sugar to 200g and its juz nice! yummmy and niceee... chocolatey and soft but not veh chewy and its still okae =)"
"0","5","What a great cookie! Everyone loved it!"
"0","5","Excellent cookies - kids are inhaling them as I write this! Left out the nuts."
"0","5","Excellent cookies! Received many compliments. Followed exactly except left out the walnuts."
"0","5","I adjusted the recipe to include 1 cup semi sweet choco chips.. and 1 cup white chocolate chips. My husband said this was the favorite of all the christmas cookies I baked this year!"
"0","5","Delicious. We love to make these for special occassions or we take some frozen balls out of the freezer to bake for an after dinner treat!"
"0","4","they were kinda dry, but nothing serious, i still like them. So far no one else has found them lol."
"0","4","These were good and chewy. Very sweet and very chocolatey! I would make them again for sure. We like to add Reese's Pieces instead of chocolate chips and make them in the fall."
"0","5","Our basketball team is having a Christmas party next week, so I decided to choose a recipe from this site to use to make chocolate chip cookies. This is the one I picked, and I'm very pleased with how the cookies turned out. They're delicious, I can't wait to see how my team likes them next week. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","I made this for my roommates and they LOVED them! I bake a lot, but these cookies got so many raves! All my roommates want the recipe."

"0","4","Very good. These cookies are better the next day. Cakey cookie that goes very well with a cup of coffee! Will make again."
"0","5","Delicious recipe! We made these cookies tonight and they are fantastic. This is the first time I have successfully made cookies (after many attempts), though I think the change came because I used a mixer instead of going by hand.  Wonderfully yummy!"
"0","5","These were amazing! The first time I tried them they turned out like I couldn't believe. The amount of chocolate was perfect and when they were added to the intermission refreshments table for a play I was in they disappeared within the first 10 minutes. Since then I've made them once more and they're still as good as ever (and they disappeared just as fast!)"
"0","5","Wonderful! I substituted peanut butter chips and they were delightful. I also like really big cookies, so I make 1/2 as many and added 4 minutes to the baking time. I also switched all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and it tasted just fine."
"0","5","Just finished and it was quick, fun and the kids love them. I had the kitchen cleaned by the time they were all baked. Thank you."
"0","5","This was an excellent recipe. I received rave reviews from my pre-natal class. I only used 3/4 C of butter, 1 C of sugar and no cocoa, and they were great! The walnuts really add to it. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","Definitely a hit with my family!"
"0","5","Yummy! I baked these a little longer, as I like to have a little crunch to my cookie. I also used 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Awesome taste and will make again!"
"0","5","This recipe was excellant! The result is a very moist and delicious and verrrry chocolaty cookie. This is my first time making a chocolate chocolate chip cookie. I ususally make the regular kind. The only thing I did different with this recipe is used only 1 C. of the chocolate chips instead of 2. I found it to be plenty."
"0","5","Excellent recipe! Best Chocolate chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. They cook fast, 8 minutes is plenty. I used milk chocolate chip instead and they tasted great. I will keep this recipe for the near future!"
"0","5","Big hit! Followed recipe as is without any difficulty. Spreads like a typical chocolate chip cookie. Lots of flavor."
"0","5","My family says these are the best cookies I've ever made. Chewey, chocolately, OMG THESE ARE DELICIOUS"
"0","5","I too cut the recipe in half and even baked them in my Oster toaster oven, though it took 12 to 14 minutes to bake. Man these are great! I used a size 30 ice cream scoop, which makes 14 cookies. So the calories per are about 250. Thanks"
"0","5","AWESOME!!! Definitely not for the faint of heart...very very rich."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. My 6 year old LOVES it, my husband loves it and I love it. Easy to make. The dough also freezes very well."
"0","5","I omitted the cocoa powder and substituted 4 1 oz. squares unsweetened chocolate. I reduced the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. I'm sure the reviews were right and the recipe is FAB as is, but I've been on a 'melted chocolate' kick recently and thought it might be good. It is rich and chocolatey with the right amount (for me) of sweetness. My 5 year old loves it, too. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","These cookies turned out great...they are better than anything you could buy in the store! I made half a batch and my wife and I both loved them! Just the right amount of chocolatey taste and so crispy on the outside!!! This recipe is a keeper!"
"0","5","FABULOUS!! Read most of the reviews first, the good reviews were absolutely true. Any bad reviews came from those who either don't know how to bake a cookie or don't like cookies to begin with! Didn't change a thing, this recipe works and is as good as everybody says it is! Way to go Kathy Brandt!!"
"0","5","Totaly sinful!!!! I added one cup of semi sweet chocolate and one cup of white chocolate. Makes a nice contrast."
"0","5","Because i'm allergic to egg, i used egg substitute. The cookies turned out perfectly and they went in about one and a half days. I'm going to make more of these DeLicIoUs cookies very soon..."
"0","5","Excellent cookie recipe. I could not even get them to cool long enough because everyone was devouring them. The ones that were left were very soft and full of chocolate flavor(exactly what I love in a cookie). This recipe is a keeper!!!"
"0","5","These cookies taste like the kind of cookies you would find in a bakery. A little crunchy around the edges and soft and chewy on the inside - perfect!"
"0","5","DELICIOUS!! Just what a chocolate cookie should be! I omitted the nuts (but will try slivered toasted almonds in the next batch). I also sifted together my dry ingredients because my cocoa powder seemed awfully lumpy, and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening instead of all butter. These would be good with a variety of chips, and even maybe a bit of chopped dried cherries... yum! They were chewy with barely crisp tops and sides after baking for 9 minutes. My only complaint...they don't make enough! Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","An excellent cookie. I'm not a fan of chocolate chip cookies, but this hooked me. My husband, a cookie-freak, loved them! Easy. Only omitted the nuts. Will make again and again. If you or someone you know needs a chocolate fix, this is it!"
"0","4","Very tasty, but maybe a little too sweet.. I think I could have used a little less sugar and they would have been just as good. I made exactly as written. Be sure to let then cool until they are room tempature before you touch them. If you don't, they will fall apart when you try to pick them up. I made the cookies a little larger than called for so I only had 36 cookies."
"0","4","These cookies are sinfully chocolatly cookie. Depending on your preference cook time could be move up to 11 0r 12 minutes. When I first tasted the cookie it tasted more like a brownie. My kids loved them and so did I."
"0","5","This recipe was great & fast! I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips. Yum! I've never made easier cookies!!"
"0","5","These cookies are sinfully delicious! And so easy to make too! I'm a novice baker and still thought this recipe was easy. I didn't have vanilla so didn't add it and it still came out great. Will be making these cookies over and over and over! Thank you Kathy!"
"0","5","Well I just don't know what to say but YUMMO!!These cookies are soooo easy and chewy,I'm glad I read the reviews.I used semi-sweet chocolate chips next time I'm going to use the white ones.My 4 kids love these cookies,will make again for sure.Thanks."
"0","4","Great cookie! Easy to whip up, fairly small ingredients list, and they come out great as advertised. I sprinkled a little confectioner's sugar on top, and left out the walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe, and they came off without a hitch. And I'm a total newby when it comes to baking.  Definitely a keeper...second only to the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe I found here."
"0","5","I'm usually not a fan of chocolate/chocolate but these are great!! They're really easy to make and taste fabulous."
"0","5","I really enjoyed this recipe. The cookies came out great, and weren't too chocolatey, but just right! Very Good!"
"0","5","These REALLY are just like brownie/cookies!!! Yum! Really moist, crisp edges, just the right amount of ingredients! I had to substitute 4 T. of margarine for part of the butter since I ran out of butter, but they were still wonderful!!!"
"0","5","Two thumbs up! A neighborhood favorite here. Will make these again soon."
"0","5","I found these cookies to be very moist with fudge-like flavor (although I used white choc chips). Still good on second day, too!"
"0","5","One of the best cookies I ever had. I added 1 cup of Chocolate chips & 1 cup of White chocolate chips. They taste like a brownie, so soft & yummy. Will make these often. 2 thumbs up!!!"
"0","5","Quite possibly the perfect cookie. Crispy and perfectly crackled on the outside, cake like and chewy on the inside. I am just packaging them up for co-workers right now...and I know they will be crazy about them. Thanks for sharing, Kathy!!"
"0","5","These are great cookies! Soft and chewy. Like others suggested I used milk chocolate along with some semi-sweet chips, which worked out well."
"0","3","Not bad, but not the best I have ever had. Batter looked a little dry and I was worried the cookies would be as well. I was right. They were nice and soft on the inside but after one cookie I felt parched. Taste was good but the dryness overwhelmed, will not make again."

"0","5","I baked these a few days ago and ended up with about 60 cookies!! I ate 10 myself... :D and then brought the rest to swim practice for my team! 50 of them were gone in 5 minutes! This is a wonderful recipe. One hint to beginner bakers: remember not to use your mixer with the powdered ingredients, it can get quite messy that way. Use a wooden spoon ;)"

The recipe as written made 36 medium sized cookies and the only change I did was add half semi sweet chips and half chopped up hershey bar. Very good, we'll have to see how many are still around when school lets out today."
"0","5","very yummy...the only thing i would change is using milk chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate chips"
"0","5","Scrumptious! This recipe is 1/2 brownie and 1/2 chewy cookie."
"0","5","Wow! These cookies are amazing! I only made half the recipe, which yeilded 2 1/2 dozen cookies more than the recipe said. Also, for a quarter of the semi-sweet chips, I substituted chunks of a large Hershey's milk chocolate bar to add variety and sweetness. These were triple chocolate-ity good!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"0","5","Excellent and easy recipe! I didn't have walnuts, so I used chopped peanuts instead - still were very good. Stayed soft after a few days in an air-tight container. It's hard to find a great recipe that always gives you good results, but this one will not disappoint you."

"0","5","I make cookies all of the time...but these cookies were the best I have ever made. I used half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco. I also used some mini-kisses as well as semi-sweet chocolate chips. Everyone loved them and begged for more!!! Enjoy!"
"0","5","I was a little short on eggs and flour, but I was dying for some cookies. Thank goodness we found these - AWESOME! It's just my husband and I, and I had read these cookies don't last long. We halfed the recipe and chopped up bittersweet baking squares. Left out the nutes, but next time (and there definitely will be a next time!) we are going to try subsituting the nuts for chunky peanut butter. I don't think we will ever stop eating them, we have already each had 3 and counting!"
"0","5","Delicious. Very chocolatety. A big hit."
"0","5","These cookies turned out great. I left out the nuts and instead of chocolate chips, I used raspberry chips (can be found during the holiday season at some grocery stores). They were a big hit when I brought them to work!"
"0","5","I used Hershey's raspberry flavored chocolate chips instead of the regular semi-sweets. The cookies tasted AMAZING!! I also did as one reviewer suggested and substituted 1/2 c. shortening for 1/2 of the butter and had no trouble with the cookies drying out. I will definitely make these again!!"
"0","5","Fabulous! Best cookies ever. Everyone asks me for the recipe."
"0","5","Turned out PERFECTLY! Super Recipe!"
"0","5","WOW! I can't make enough of these. They are not so sweet as your regular chocolate chip so they make a great 'adult' cookie. Add more cocoa for more of a bittersweet cookie - my favorite!"
"0","5","These are for the chocoholic only! Boy what rich deep flavor! I made them with freshly ground whole wheat flour and they came out perfectly even after freezing in little cookie dough balls and baking fresh from the freezer. They were a little to chocolatey for me, but my husband loves them."
"0","5","I MADE THESE COOKIES LAST NIGHT, YUMMY!! The shape and taste of these cookies were perfect!!!! I will be making these again."
"0","5","I tried several of the here published cookie recipes, but I definitely liked this one the best. I did not use as much caocao. (I am not that brave!), but they turned out more then rich enough! I fixed them for my (American) husband, who was going on chocolate chip cookie withdrawl. He loved them. 'A face-flusher', he said. Extremely yummy. Thank you for sharing and thank you for having a metric standard calculator!  Susanne (Germany)"
